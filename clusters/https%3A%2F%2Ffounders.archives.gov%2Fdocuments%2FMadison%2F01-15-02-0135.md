Resuming the train of his observations, he proceeded to explain the remedial operation of his propositions.  
First. They will make the British nation sensible that we can, by just and pacific means, inflict consequences which will make it her interest, to pay a just regard to our rights and interests.  
To enforce this tendency, he enlarged on the ideas he had formerly expressed in relation to the dependence of Great-Britain on the commerce of the United States, and the obvious and essential dependence of the British West-Indies, on the supplies of the United States.  
On the latter subject, he entered into a particular reply to the member from Massachusetts (Mr. Ames,) who had argued that the British regulation of the trade between the United States and the West-Indies, was conformable to the principles of the Colony system as established by the commercial nations of Europe, and could not therefore be reasonably complained of. 2. That the West-Indies could obtain supplies from other quarters, and did not therefore depend on the United States; nay, that there was danger, by forcing these supplies into other channels, of our losing that branch of trade altogether. 3. That the trade would hardly employ more than a dozen brigs, and was therefore not worth contending for.  
In answer to the first argument of Mr. Ames, Mr. M. undertook to shew, that Great-Britain had not pursued, but violated the principle of the colony system. The true spirit of this system, he said, was to confine the trade between the parent country and the colony, to their own vessels, and to allow as little trade as possible, between the colony and foreign countries; but when a trade with a foreign country became necessary to the colony, to allow the foreign vessels the same carrying privileges allowed to their own. Colonies, he said, were to be considered as parts of a common empire. The trade between one part and another, as between London and Kingston in Jamaica, was to be considered, equally an internal trade with the coasting trade between London and Liverpool, or the trade between different ports of the United States: and might, if deemed expedient, be equally restrained to domestic bottoms. But when a trade was opened between a colony and a foreign country, the case was changed: the foreign country became a party, and had a reciprocal claim to the use of its bottoms, as much in the trade with the colony, as with any other part of the empire, to which the colony belonged. In support of this doctrine, Mr. M. referred to the example of every nation in Europe, except that of Great-Britain, which had American colonies. Denmark, Sweden, the United Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal, had their colonies, as well as Great-Britain; and some of them, rigorously attached to the principles of the colony system: yet not a single one of these nations had refused, whenever a trade was permitted at all between the colonies and another country, to make the carriage common to the vessels of both the parties. Great-Britain alone had attempted a monopoly in such cases for her own vessels. Her example therefore was an innovation on the colony system, as well as an infraction of the rights of reciprocity.  
In answer to the 2d position of Mr. A. he denied that permanent supplies of provisions and lumber could be derived from any other part of the world than the United States: not from the northern parts of Europe, which either did not produce, or were too remote to send them: not from the southern parts of Europe, which depended themselves on the northern parts and on America: not from Great Britain, which imported bread, for her own use, amounting one year with another according to the report of the committee of the privy council, to the sum of near three hundred thousand pounds sterling, and was, certainly not an exporter of lumber: not from Ireland, which could not pretend to rival the United States in any article but that of salt provisions; and this was so much dearer that a prohibition alone of ours, could gain a market for hers. The gentleman had relied on the capacity of Ireland to extend her cultivation of wheat, so as to spare supplies of this article also. Such a revolution in her interior state was not very probable. But he ought at least to have remembered, that as the pasture lands of Ireland should be turned into wheat fields, her export of beef would decrease, in proportion as she might be enabled to export bread.  
It was a waste of time, Mr. M. said, to disprove by minute enquiries, the possibility of supplying the British West Indies from the old continent, on terms that would not be worse than abandoning them altogether. The truth was, that the gentleman, (Mr. A.) had, in this particular, gone beyond the most sanguine advocates of the British policy, Mr. Knox and Lord Sheffield themselves; who limited their ultimate hopes of supporting the West-Indies without the aid of the United States, to the remaining possessions of G. Britain on this continent. He would proceed, he said, to shew what foundation there was for the opinion of these gentlemen, and the gentleman from Massachusetts, in favour of this resource. And he was able to give the most full and decisive evidence in the case, by recurring to an authentic document of our own, from which it appeared, that the continental colonies of Great Britain, instead of being able to furnish the West India colonies, were themselves dependent for the very articles wanted there, on the supplies of the United States.  
In the official statement of our exports for the year as late as 1791, most of the articles sent to the British continental colonies, were of a sort and an amount so directly to the point, that he hoped the committee would excuse him for repeating them in detail. He stated them as follows:

The total of the exports, including a few articles under other heads, amounted to two hundred seventy thousand two hundred fifty and nine dollars.  
  
Here then, it is seen, that not only in the bread stuffs and meats of every sort, but in the articles of lumber and live stock, for which, by universal acknowledgment, the West Indies must depend either on the United States, or the British Continental colonies; the latter are so far from being a rival to us, or a resource to the West Indies, that they continue, at this day, to supply their own deficiencies from our market.  
Mr. M. said, that he should not have employed so much of the time of the committee on this head, if the gentleman (Mr. Ames) had not attempted to revive the arguments with respect to Canada and Nova Scotia, which had misled G. Britain in her political calculations and her present views. He had heard the language of the gentleman on this subject, with astonishment. That Mr. Knox and Lord Sheffield, British subjects, viewing the prospect with British eyes, at the distance of three thousand miles, in the year 1783, when little enquiry and no experiment could assist them, should have run into the error, was perhaps not so marvellous. But, that an enlightened Citizen of America, seeing with American eyes, living in the neighbourhood as it were of the scene, in a state whose wharves afford proofs of the daily dependence of the British Continental colonies for the necessaries of life, on the market of the United States, should, in the year 1794 adopt the opinion that those colonies could supply the Islands, after a trial of nine years had probably forced the authors of the opinion, Knox and Sheffield themselves, to abandon it, could not be heard without some surprize; and must be considered at least as the fullest proof, that the gentleman had not given sufficient attention to the present subject, to claim that weight which was in general due to his observations.  
Mr. M. said he was not less surprised at the 3d position of the gentleman from Massachusetts, viz. that the West-India trade could be carried on by a dozen brigs; and consequently, was not an object worth our pursuit. The plain answer to this argument was, to state the fact, that the shipping entered in one year from the British West-Indies, was not a dozen brigs, but 107,759 tons.  
Besides the immediate importance of this auxilliary resource for our navigation, he remarked, that there were two considerations which enhanced the value of the object: one, that as the West-India articles could be brought cheaper in American vessels, they would come cheaper to American consumers; the other, that as our supplies would at the same time be carried cheaper to the West-Indies, the people there could afford to consume the more of them.  
It had been urged that the proposed restrictions on the trade with Great-Britain would produce clamors here as well as there, and that Congress might be obliged to recede, before the British government would be under the necessity of doing so. To this Mr. M. replied, that he was under no such apprehension. He thought more favorably of the good sense as well as virtue of his fellow citizens. On the side of Great-Britain it had been shewn there would be the greatest distress, and the least ability to bear it. The people there were not accustomed, like the people of the United States, to self-denying regulations. They would not have the same confidence in the justice of their cause. And it was particularly worthy of remark, that the people of Great-Britain would be disheartened, and the government alarmed, by reflecting, that their losses from the shifting of commerce into other channels, and not only of their manufactures, but manufacturers, to other places, would be permanent and irretrievable; whereas on our side, they would be temporary sacrifices for durable and valuable acquisitions.  
Secondly. The resolutions would have the effect of increasing our marine, and thereby at once cheapening and securing the carriage of our productions, and providing for our safety. These advantages having been already sufficiently explained, need not, he said, be again developed.  
It had been remarked by a member from Massachusetts, (Mr. Ames) that if, as stated by a report of Mr. Jefferson, Great-Britain was so often at war, her wars, by depriving us of her shipping, would soon have the wished effect, of replacing it with American shipping. This reasoning Mr. M. said, supposed what was contrary to prudence and probability. What merchants would build ships, which a peace, always more or less in prospect, would throw out of employment; unless it were for special purposes, where the momentary gain might outweigh the eventual sacrifice.  
It had been said that our tonnage was proved by the official returns to be increasing with an unexampled rapidity. To this Mr. M. answered: that the increase ought not to be compared with other examples, but with our own natural faculties, and reasonable expectations—that the increase of our population required an annual increase of at least five per cent; that an assumption by foreigners of American names, had probably increased the apparent quantity of our shipping; that the war or preparations for it, by withdrawing foreign shipping, had probably also had some little temporary effect; that the principal cause of the increase, was the extension of our trade with the French dominions, which some members seemed so little inclined to secure and foster, by measures which appeared to him best fitted for the purpose.  
He reminded the committee of an argument, which had, on former occasions, been much pressed by several mercantile members, for encouraging our own navigation; to wit: that American vessels, from a spirit of enterprize, and a unison between private and public interests, would explore new fields of commerce, and new markets for our produce, which foreign carriers would leave unattempted. The trade to China opened by American vessels, had been often ascribed to this cause. Mr. M. said the argument seemed to be countenanced also, by the present state of our mediterranean trade; which had, since our independence, been confined by the Barbary corsairs to foreign bottoms. Previous to the revolution, when American vessels could be the carriers, the trade was very considerable. Since the exclusion of our vessels, though the carriage of our produce is safe to British, and several other foreign vessels, yet this branch of trade had withered as much as most others have grown. In 1790, the exports cleared for the mediterranean, were but 31,726 dollars; and in the year following, the imports no more than 11,522 dollars.  
Thirdly. Another effect incident to the proposed measure, would be an additional encouragement to domestic manufactures.  
A gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Dexter) had said, he could read no such tendency in the propositions. Mr. M. thought it impossible to read the propositions with attention, and not perceive, that they must have the like tendency with the other means, by which manufactures had been promoted. If the duties already laid, were calculated to produce this effect, an increase of those duties in any instance, must have a tendency to increase the effect. In answer to the objection that, a change in the policy of G. B. might put an end to the additional duties, and ensnare those who should proceed under the influence of them, he remarked, 1. That the same might be said in some degree of the regulations now in force. A treaty with Great Britain might stipulate changes which would affect our manufacturers. But as there was a just confidence, that the interests of this class of citizens would in this case be attended to by the government; it might be expected, that equal attention would be paid to them, in any other case. 2. The progress of things in this country, and the probable accession of foreign manufacturers, might be relied on to support whatever undertakings shall have once got a footing.  
4thly. The proposed resolutions would favor an advantageous competition and distribution of our trade among the manufacturing nations of Europe. At present, it may be said to be monopolized by one; so great is the disproportion of its manufactures which come to our market. That this is an evil, has been admitted, and cannot be doubted. It exposes us to the greatest and most sudden embarrassments from the caprice, the passions, the mistaken calculations of interest, the bankruptcies, and the wars of a single foreign country. Many of these embarrassments are felt at the present moment. If it were possible to liquidate them into a pecuniary statement, it would be found that, in a permanent view of our interest, there would be economy in making very considerable temporary sacrifices, for the purpose of dividing our custom among a number of competitors. It was not true, that G. Britain alone can supply the manufactures we want. France, the United Netherlands, and several other nations, are capable of supplying us with a variety of articles, as well as the nation from which they now come; and, if invited to our markets by prudent encouragements in the first instance, will soon learn to fashion their manufactures to the wants and tastes of this country. The policy of favouring particular branches of trade, even at some expence, in order to guard against the evil of depending on a single one, was exemplified by the conduct of G. Britain herself. Although he viewed her discriminations generally, respecting us, in the light he had explained; yet, he thought it possible, that in the instance of naval stores and ship-timbers, it might be her intention to foster a rivalship in a more distant quarter, in order to provide against a casual privation of the supplies of a nearer quarter. These articles are essential to the marine of G. Britain; as her marine is essential to her greatness. Were she to have no resource but in the Baltic, a war with the Baltic powers might be fatal to her. It may be wise in her, therefore, to keep open the American resource, even at the price of a tax on herself. In this case she must quarrel with both the Baltic powers and the United States at the same time, before the supplies will be cut off.  
A member from Massachusetts, (Mr. Dexter) had not, Mr. M. said, been very consistent in his reasoning on this subject. He had contended against all attempts to excite a beneficial competition, on the idea that no competition could be beneficial which would not spring up of itself; and yet he had warned us against the danger, that G. Britain, by exciting a competition against the United States, in those parts of Europe, which most resemble the infant situation of our country, might establish new sources from which supplies would afterwards spontaneously flow to her, without being ever again wanted from the United States. The same remark was applicable to the reasoning of the other gentlemen who had represented the danger of exciting a permanent rivalship for the West India market, in favor of Canada and Nova Scotia.  
Fifthly. The plan of the resolutions tended to conciliate nations in treaty, or disposed to be in treaty with us, into arrangements still more favourable to our commerce. This argument had peculiar weight in relation to France. It had been said that Great Britain was our best customer. The fact, he said, was that we were her best customer: but that France was our best customer. We consume more of British manufactures than any other nation in the world consumes. France consumes more of our productions, than any other nation consumes. He referred to the statements he had before offered for proof of this. Her consumption was also of the most valuable kind; and under favourable regulations would be a very growing one. It consisted of wheat and flour, salt provisions, and fish; articles which were not admitted by Great Britain; and which without the market of France, would glut every other. Of our fish she consumed five eighths of the whole exportation. Her use of our live animals was another important consideration. It amounted, in the list of our exports, to 352,795 dollars, for the year 1791. In the same year, the British demand amounted to no more than 62,415 dollars. The superior proportion of navigation we enjoyed in the French channels of intercourse had already been shewn. In examining the policy of cultivating and securing the French markets, he said it ought not to be forgotten, that the profits and revenue arising from the rum distilleries, depended on an article obtained almost, if not altogether, from the French dominions alone; and which was the only raw material of any consequence imported into the United States. It was paid for also, as had been much urged on other occasions by members on the opposite side, in the worst fish, which could find a vent in no other part of the world. The molasses imported into the United States in one year, amounted to upward of seven millions of gallons, more than one half of which went into the state of Massachusetts. He took notice also of the article of sugar, as rendered of great importance by our habits and our finances; and of which more than one half was supplied by the French West Indies. Out of 17,142,723 pounds imported, 9,321,829 pounds were received from that source. The residue came from the Danish, Dutch, and British dominions, in the following proportions. To wit, Danish, 2,833,016 pounds, Dutch 2,707,231 pounds, British 2,280,647 pounds. This statement was taken from the imports of 1790, the only year he had been able to examine on this point.  
It had been said, Why grant privileges before a mutual grant should be secured by positive stipulation? Why throw away, by a legal regulation, what ought to be the price of treaty? He answered, that the legal regulation threw nothing away, as it was always revocable: that in the present instance, it was only meeting the legal regulations of which France had set the example: that instead of being a bar to treaty, such a course of proceeding, more than any other, would smooth the way to it, by explaining the objects, and establishing a confidence, on both sides—that it would be happy, if in all cases, where treaties are in view, this open and conciliatory process, could take the place of that reserve and mysterious negociation, with which the parties approach each other. Were Great Britain desirous of forming amicable arrangements by treaty, he asked what readier or more prudent step could she have taken for the purpose, than to have followed the example set her, by holding out in her laws, the spirit in which she was willing to meet us in negociation?  
Having gone through these explanations, Mr. M. entered into a view of the principal objections to the resolutions proposed.  
  
1. It was said they would diminish the revenue, and endanger the funds.  
With respect to the public debt, his general ideas had been expressed by several who had spoken before him. He acknowledged that he had disliked and opposed the modification given to it; but after it had received the sanction of law, he had entertained no other wish on the subject, than that the debt might be honorably discharged, as fast as the circumstances of the country would permit. This he was well satisfied was the prevailing sentiment of the great body of the people. He did not believe, that there was a single state in the union, or any considerable part of a single state, that did not acquiesce (where they did not approve) in the provisions which had been made in behalf of the public creditors. At the same time, he was equally sure, that it never was either meant by congress, or understood by the public, that in mortgaging the impost for their security, it was to be an hostage to foreign countries for our unqualified acquiescence in their unequal laws, and to be worn, as long as the debt should continue, as a badge of national humiliation. The nature of the obligation could certainly import no more in favor of the creditors, than that the fund appropriated should be applied, as far as requisite, to their use; unless equivalent funds should be substituted; nor more against the public, than that all deficiencies in the fund should be made up, whether arising without, or in consequence of, a change in the laws. If it should happen, then, that in consequence of any measure, dictated by the general good, the impost should become inadequate to its object, all that could be exacted by the public creditors, would be some other provision that would supply the defalcation; and it ought not to be doubted, that the people at large, whose good was pursued, would readily support whatever other provision might become indispensible. He had made these remarks, however, with reference to an event, which he did not by any means admit to be probable. The more he had revolved the subject, the more clearly it appeared to him, that a very operative addition might be made to the duties on the enumerated articles, without endangering the aggregate product of the importations. And he entirely concurred in opinion with those, who had observed, that the greatest injury which could be done to the class of citizens holding the public paper, was to represent their interests as more to be regarded than any national considerations whatever; and to oppose to the latter, even the most imaginary contingencies to the former.  
2. It was objected, that the operation of the resolutions would be more favorable, in some instances to nations in treaty than was merited; and more unfavorable, in others, to nations not in treaty, than was p

If, in any country, the mercantile opinion ought not to be implicitly followed, there were the strongest reasons why it ought not, in this. The body of merchants who carry on the American commerce is well known to be composed of so great a proportion of individuals who are either British subjects, or trading on British capital, or enjoying the profits of British consignments, that the mercantile opinion here, might not be an American opinion; nay, it might be the opinion of the very country, of which, in the present instance at least, we ought not to take counsel. What the genuine American mercantile opinion would be, if it could be collected apart from the general one, Mr. M. said he did not undertake positively to decide. His belief was that it would be in favor of the resolutio

.  
4. It had been an objection to the resolutions, that they might deprive us of the aid of British capital and credit, which were necessary to the prosecution of our commerce.  
Mr. M. did not admit either that the effect would happen, or that it would be ruinous to our commerce.  
Unless Great Britain should, of her own choice, put a stop to the commercial intercourse with us, which for reasons before given would be so much more hurtful to herself than to this country, that it never could be presumed; the resolutions would operate only by abridging some of our importations, and by varying the channels of others. Her capital, as far as requisite here, might continue to be employed here.  
On the general question concerning our dependence on British capital and credit, he observed that it could not be denied that more use was made of them at present, than was either necessary or beneficial. Credit when extended to consumers, as was the case throughout the southern states, was extremely injurious; as had been well explained by a member of Virginia (Mr. Nicholas), and as he himself had equally witnessed. When confined to merchants, it might, within certain limits, be an advantage; but it was not only his own opinion, but that of better judges, that the credit given to our merchants, was at present excessive and injurious.  
In order to form a very precise judgment on this subject, it would be necessary, he said, to calculate the amount of our own capital, and its proportion to the amount of our trade. This was a thing he supposed, which could not well be done. If he had concurred in the doctrine, of which so much had been heard both within and without doors, that a funded debt and banks of discount, were equivalent to active capital, he should have a ready answer to the difficulty. The paper of the two kinds, in the United States, cannot amount to less than one hundred millions of dollars; whilst the amount of our exports or our imports, does not exceed one fourth of that capital. It is true, a part of both the public and the bank stocks, is in foreign hands; but, with the most ample deductions on that account, the residue, if operating in any considerable degree, as active capital, would be a competent resource.  
As he did not however view the doctrine in the particular light in which it had been painted; it would be more to his purpose, to observe, that there was certainly in this country a real mercantile capital to a very respectable amount—that this was fast increasing with our increasing population and wealth: that if the foreign capital of one country should be withdrawn, the vacancy would probably by degrees be occupied by that of other foreign nations; that if it should happen otherwise, there was reason to believe, that a restriction of our use of foreign credit, would be rather salutary than disadvantageous; that in fine, as long as we had twenty millions of dollars worth of produce, wanted by other nations; and were willing to take for it, twenty millions worth of what they wished to part with, he was under no apprehension that the means of effectuating an exchange, would not be found. Both merchants and capital would quickly be generated by such a state of things, if they did not previously exist.  
5. It had been observed by several members, in allusion to the alledged proportion of British manufactures consumed by us to the entire mass of her manufactures, that Great Britain would never part with her navigation act, in order to avoid a loss of four per cent. in the demand for her manufactures.  
To this objection he answered; that the comparison ought to be our consumption, not with the entire mass of her manufactures, but with the part entering into her foreign trade; and then the loss would not be four per cent, but, at least twenty per cent; that this would not be the only loss she would sustain, if she should be unwise enough to stop the intercourse between the United States and her dominions; that it had been already shewn, that when she apprehended a restrictive system on our part, she was willing to prevent it, by relaxing her restrictive system; that in times of war, when an adherence to that system would distress her, she frequently suspends her navigation act; that at this moment it is suspended in relation to the West-Indies; that there could be little doubt, if the temporary necessity, were likely to be made permanent by firm and judicious measures on our part, that the remedy for it would be made permanent also.  
6. It was objected that the present was an improper time for such resolutions.  
The principal reason given for this was, that the negociation between the secretary of state and the British minister here, was still depending. To shew that this reason was unsound, Mr. M. went into an historical view of what had passed in reference to commercial arrangements. He read the message of the President to the House of Representatives, on the 14th of February, 1791, acquainting them, that steps had been taken to ascertain the dispositions of the British court on the subject, and that there was no ground for favorable expectations. He stated, that in consequence of this communication, a committee was appointed, who reported that foreign vessels ought not to be allowed to bring into the United States any articles not of the produce or manufacture of the country to which they belong, and that an additional duty of twelve and an half cents ought to be laid on all distilled spirits, the production of any country or place from which vessels of the United States were not permitted to bring them; that it being very near the end of the session when this report was made, it was referred to the secretary of state, with an instruction to report to the next session an account of the foreign commercial regulations affecting the United States, with his opinion, &amp;c. that at the next session, a letter was received from that officer, intimating that in the actual state of circumstances, the report would not be given in, unless called for by the House; that at the present session, the report now before the committee, was given in, without being called for; and was therefore a proof, that the circumstances which had caused the delay had vanished, and that at present there was nothing in train, according to the opinion of the secretary of state, which ought to restrain the Legislature from proceeding in the business.  
In answer to suggestions, that the British minister had, in the correspondence with the Secretary of State, lately communicated by the President, manifested a favourable disposition, which had not been improved—Mr. M. recurred to the passages which related to this point. He read from the first letter of Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Hammond, dated Nov. 29, 1791, a paragraph requesting Mr. H. “to say, whether he was authorized to conclude, or to negociate arrangements with us which may fix the commerce between the two countries, on principles of reciprocal advantage?” To this request Mr. H. on the 30th of Nov. 1791, answered, “That the king was sincerely disposed to promote and facilitate the commercial intercourse between the two countries, and that he was authorized to communicate to this government, his majesty’s readiness to enter into a negociation for establishing that intercourse upon principles of reciprocal benefit.” On Dec. 6, he wrote to Mr. J. in order to prevent misapprehension, that although he was not yet empowered to conclude any definitive arrangement with respect to the commercial intercourse, he still meant it to be understood, that he was fully authorized to enter into a negociation for that purpose, &amp;c. The reply of Mr. J. on the 13th of Dec. informed Mr. H. that he had laid his letters before the President, and was ready to receive a communication of his full powers, for entering into the negociation, &amp;c. This was followed on the next day by a letter from Mr. H. stating, that he had no special commission to conclude any definitive arrangement upon the subject of commercial intercourse—but that he conceived himself fully competent to enter into a negociation, and the discussion of principles that might be the basis of such definitive arrangement—and that this opinion of his competency was founded on the instructions which were to regulate his personal conduct, and the general plenipotentiary character in which he had been sent and received.  
This letter, Mr. M. observed, closed the correspondence on the subject of commercial arrangements, being justly considered by the executive as a final proof, that the powers of Mr. H. were incompetent, and irrelative to the object; and that it would be improper to open a formal negociation with him, under them. His instructions might be a rule and a warrant to himself, but not being even exhibited, could be no evidence of his authority, to the executive. And his plenipotentiary commission in the ordinary form, could never be understood as relating to the special objects he proposed to discuss. According to the usage of nations, a special commission is, in such cases, always furnished and required. Mr. M. was persuaded, that no sovereign in Europe would listen for a moment to such a claim as that of Mr. H. and that the British court would have been offended at such an one from an American minister. He thought therefore that the executive had equally consulted dignity and prudence, in silently dropping the subject in the same manner they did, until Mr. H. should receive and produce adequate powers in the accustomed form; as might reasonably be expected, if his court was duly disposed to meet the United States, in an amicable arrangement of commerce, by treaty.  
That the construction put by Mr. H. on his powers, was inadmissible, appeared to Mr. M. to result from the construction itself. Either the general Plenipotentiary commission was to be taken in the technical and limited sense in which it is applied to the ordinary diplomatic objects of a stationary public minister; or, in a literal sense, without regard to such limitation. In the former sense, it clearly does not extend to negociations for a treaty. In the latter sense it would extend to the conclusion of a treaty, and not merely to negotiation, as Mr. H. explains and limits it.  
Mr. M. adverted next to the state of the correspondence relating to the treaty of peace. It appeared, he observed, that as long ago as the 29th of May, 1792, the Secretary of State had addressed to Mr. Hammond, a full explanation of our rights and demands, under that treaty—that on the 2d June, Mr. Hammond informed the Secretary, that he should transmit it without delay for the consideration of his court; and accordingly did forward it in the course of a few days; that on the 13th Nov. 1793, previous to the present meeting of Congress, Mr. H. was desired by the Secretary, in pursuance of a charge from the President, to let him know whether an answer could yet be given to the letter of May 29, 1792. Mr. H. replied that it could not; but that he was confident the delay was to be ascribed to the continuance of the cause alluded to in a former answer to a similar request.  
The cause alluded to was the interesting posture of things in Europe, which it was said, had diverted the attention of the British government to objects of a more pressing nature; and this consideration had been urged by several members, as an apology for the silence observed towards the United States. Mr. Madison thought very differently. The interval between the receipt of the letter written by the Secretary in May 1792; and the accession of Great Britain to the war against France, had been sufficient for the purpose of preparing and sending the proper instructions to Mr. H. Mr. M. added, that the prospect of being engaged in new controversies of a more serious kind instead of justifying an inattention to an existing one, ought to have quickened the efforts for a previous settlement of the latter. This is the course dictated by prudence, to nations as well as to individuals; and where a right disposition concurs, it is the natural course.  
It had been mentioned as a further reason against the commercial propositions, at this time, that they might draw upon us the resentments of the Combined powers. Mr. M. could see no ground for such an apprehension. The Combined powers were pretty fully occupied with France; they could have no pretext for concerning themselves with us, in a case where we did not concern ourselves with them; and there was the less room for imagining that the combination could misconstrue the measure into an offence against them; as two of the parties, Prussia and the United Netherlands were in treaty with the United States, and are favored by the propositions.  
7. It was finally contended that admitting our situation to be such as had been described, the mode proposed was an objectionable one.  
Mr. M. said he had no predilections for the mode that could prevent his giving a ready preference to a better, if a better should be offered. And unless it should be said, that the Legislature ought to adjourn without doing any thing for the public relief, he thought it incumbent on those who objected to one proposition to substitute another that would be less objectionable. By this he meant a proposition not merely better in itself; but one that would probably be thought so, both within and without doors; and be more likely to coincide with the sentiments of every part of the union, as well as to conciliate a majority of voices in the public councils.  
The first question, he said, was whether any thing ought to be done. If this be decided in the affirmative; as he presumed to be the sense of a majority of the committee; and if war was not in contemplation as of course was taken for granted; the next question could only lie between negociation, and commercial regulations. Negociation it had been shewn was in no train, or prospect, that could justify reliance on it. Commercial regulations alone remained. They would be pacific in their operation. They were the means best suited to the temper of our constituents. And he sincerely believed, that, if judiciously framed, they would be more likely to answer the reasonable purposes of the community, than any others that could be proposed

Retaining the train of his obfcrvation*,  
he; n.LCvxltd to explain the remedial ope­  
ravor of h:s proportions.  
  
lirji. They will make the British na­  
tion frnfiblc that wv can, by just and pa­  
cific means, inflict cOr.fequences which  
wih make it her interest, to pay a jult re­  
gard to our rights and interests.  
  
To enforce this tendency, he enlarged  
on the ideas &quot;he had formerly exprefled in  
relation to die dependance of Great Bri­  
tain on the eemmefee of the United States,  
and the obvious and eflential dependance  
of the British Weft-Indies, on the supplies  
of the United States.  
  
On the hitter fubjeft, he entered into a  
particular reply to the member from Maf­  
ldchufett* (Mr. Ames) who had argued  
that the lirttifh regulation of the trade  
bfctween the United States and the Weft­  
iYidies, whs conformable to the principles  
of the colony system as eftablilhed by the  
commercial nations of Europe, and could  
not therefore be reafonablr complained of.  
  
2d. That the Weil-Indies could obtain  
fiipr,lies irom other quarters, ar.d did not  
tin efore depend on the United States &#x27;r  
nay, that there was danger, by forcing  
tliele fupphYs into other channels, of our  
lo:&#x27; • !ie blanch of trade altogether.  
sd. That tli&lt; tiade would hardly em­  
ploy more than a dozen brigs, and was  
the efore not worth contending for.  
  
In anlwer to the firft argument of Mr.  
Ames, Mr. Madiion undertook to (hew,  
that Great Britain had not pursued, but  
violated the principle of the colony system.  
The truefpirit ofthis system, he laid, was  
to confine the trade between the parent  
country and the colony, to their own ves­  
sels, and to allow as little trade as poflible,  
between »•&gt;* colony and foreign countries ;  
but When a trade with a foreign country  
became necessary to the colony, to allow  
tit foreign vef/eis the fame carrying privileges  
ai -?i dto their own. Colonies, he said,  
were to be considered as parts of a com­  
mori empire. The trade between one part  
ami another, as between London and  
Kinglton hi Jamaica. wan to be consider­  
ed, equally an internal trade with the  
co.g trade between London and Li­  
verpool, or the trade between the difTer­  
ejit po.t:- ol the United Stales; and might,  
if d.e&quot;tied expedient, be equally restrained  
to domcttic bottoms. But when a trade  
was opened between a colony and a foreign  
country, the cafe was changed: the fo­  
reign country became a party, and had a  
reciprocal claim to the use of its bottoms,  
as much in the trade with the colony, as  
with any other part of the empire, to which  
the colony belonged. In support of this  
doctrine, Mr. M. referred to the example  
of every nation in Europe, except that of  
Great Britoifl, which had American colo­  
nies. Denmajk, Sweden, the United Ne­  
therlands, France, Spain and Portugal,  
had thei: colonies, a well as Great Bri­  
tain : and some of them, rigorously at­  
tached to the principles of the colony sys­  
tem : yet uot a finglc one of these&quot;nations  
had refuted, whenever a trade waspermit­  
t. at all between the colonies and another  
country, to make the carriage common to  
the veflels of both the parties. Great Bri­  
tain alone had attempted i monopoly in  
such cases for her own vefftls. Her ex­  
ample therefore was an innovation on the  
colony system, as well as an infraction of  
the rights of reciprocity.  
  
In answer to the 2d position of Mr. A.  
he denied that permanent {applies of pro­  
visions and lumWii could be derived from  
any. other pait of the world than the Unit­  
ed States: not from the northern parts of  
Europe, which either did not produce, or  
were too remote to tend them : not from  
the southern parti of Europe, which de­  
pended themlelves on the northern parts  
and on America: not from Great Britain,  
which imported bread, for her own use,  
amounting one year with another accord­  
ing to the repoit of the committee of the  
privy council, to the sum of near three  
hundred thousand pounds sterling, and  
wa% certainly not an exporter of lumber :  
not fmm Ireland, which could not pretend  
to rival the United Stales in anv article  
but that of fait provisions ; and this was so  
much dearer, that a prohibition alone of  
  
ours, could ga*n a market for hfrs. The  
gentleman had relied on the csnpacity of  
Ireland to extend her cultivation of wheat,  
so as to spare supplies of this article also.  
Such a revolution in her interior state was  
not very probable. But he ouvht at lealt  
tohave renumbered, that as the palture  
lands of Ireland should be turned into  
wheat lidds, her export of beef would de­  
crease, in proportion as Ihe might be ena­  
bled to export bread.  
  
It was a wafle of time, Mr. M. said,  
to disprove by minute enquiries, the pos­  
sibility of supplying the British Welt In­  
dies from the old continent, on terms  
that would not be worse than abandoning  
them altogether. The truth was that  
the gentleman (Mr. A.) had in this par­  
ticular, gone beyond the mod sanguine  
advocates of the Britilh policy, Mr. Knox  
and Lord Sheffield themfclves ; who li­  
mited their ultimate hopes of supporting  
the Weft-Indies without the aid of the  
United States, to the remaining pofTef­  
iions of Great Britrin on this continent.  
He would proceed, he said, to (hew what  
foundation there was for the opinion of  
these gentlemen, and the gentleman from  
MalTachufetts, in favor of this resource.  
And he was able to givt the molt full and  
decisive evidence in the cafe, by recurring  
to1 an authentic document ot our own,  
from which it appeared, that the conti­  
nental colonies of Great Britain, instead  
of being able to fumifh the Weft India  
colonies, were themselves dependent for  
the very articles wanted there, on the sup­  
plies of the United States.  
  
In the official statement of our exports  
for the year as late as 1791, moll of the  
articles lent to the Britift continental co­  
lonies, were of a fort and ail amount so  
directly to the point, that he hoped the  
committee would excuse him-for repeat­  
ing them in detail. He stated them as  
follows:  
  
Bread-Stuffs and Rools.  
Wheat, 3,125 bushels  
Rye, 2,201  
Barley, 32  
Indian corn, 80,734  
Oats, 314  
Buckweat, 26  
Peas and beanj

Pine, do. 17,0000  
Maple and beach, do. 7,5000  
  
The total of the exports, including a  
few articles under other heads, amounted  
to two hundred, seventy thousand, two  
hundred fifty and nine dollar*.  
  
Here then, it is seen, that not only in  
the bread fluffs, and meats of every fort,  
but in the articles of lumber and live  
flock, for which, by unvierfal acknow­  
ledgment, the Weft Indies mud depend  
either on the United States, or the Brit­  
ish Continental colonies j the latter are so  
far from being a rival to us, or a resource  
to the Weft Indies, that they continue,  
at this day, to supply their own deficien­  
cies fiom our market.  
  
Mr. M. said, that he should not have  
employed so much of the time of the com­  
mittee on this haul, if the gentleman,  
  
(Mr. Ames) had not attempted to revrve  
the arguments with refpeit to Canada and  
Nova Sfcotia, which had milled Great  
Britain in her political calculations and  
ptefent views.  
  
He had heard the language of the gen­  
tleman on this fubjeft, with allonidiment.  
That Mr. Knox and Lord Sheffield, Bri­  
tilh lubjefts, viewing the profpedt with  
British eyes, at the dillance of three thou­  
sand miles, in the year 1783, when little  
enquiry and no experiment could assist  
them, Ihould have run into the error, was  
perhaps not so marvellous. But, that an  
enlightened citizen of America, feeing  
with American eyes, living in the neigh­  
borhood as it were of the scene, in a (late  
whose wharves afford proofs of the daily  
dependance of the British Continental co­  
lonies for the neceflaries of life, on the  
market of the United States, fliould, in  
the year 1794. adopt the opinion that  
thofc colonies could supply the I Hands,  
after a trial of nine years had probably  
forced the authors of the opinion, Knox  
and Sheffield themselves, to abandon it,  
could not be heard without some surprize ;  
and mud be considered at lead as the ful­  
led proof, that the gentleman had not  
given fufficient attention to the present  
fubjecJt, to claim that weight which was  
in general due to his observations.  
  
Mr. M. said he was not less surprised  
at the 3d position of the gentleman from  
MaflachufetU, viz. that the Weft-India  
trade could be carried on by a dozen  
brigs; and consequently, was not an ob­  
jc£i worth our pursuit. The plain answer  
to this argument was, to state the fact,  
that the (hipping entered in one year from  
the British Weft-Indies, was not a dozen  
brigs, but 107,759 tHns-  
  
Besides the immediate importance of  
this auxilliary resource for our navigation,  
he remarked, that there were two confi­  
deratioin which enhanced the value of the  
object : one, that as the Weft-India arti­  
cles could be brought cheaper in Ameri­  
can ve&#x27;re!s, they would come cheaper to  
American consumers ; the other, that as  
our supplies would at the fame time be  
carried cheaper to the Weft-Indies, the  
people there could afford to consume the  
more of them.

It had been urged that the proposed  
reftri£tions on the trade with Great-Bri­  
tain would produce clamors here as well  
as there, and that Congress might be  
obliged to recede, before the Britiih go­  
vernment would be under the neceflity of  
doing so. To this Mr. M. replied, that  
he was under no such apprehension. He  
thought more favorably of the good sense  
as well as virtue of his fellow-citizens. On  
the fide of Great-Britain it had been (hewn  
there would be the greatest distress, and  
the least ability to bear it. The people  
there were not accustomed, like the peo­  
ple of the United States, to felf-denying  
regulations. They would not have the  
fame confidence in the justice of their caufr.  
And it was particularly worthy of remark,  
that the people of Great-Britain would be  
difheaitened, and the government alarmed,  
by reflecting, that their lofles fiom the  
ftlifting of commerce into other channels,  
and not only of their manufa&amp;ures, but  
manufacturers, to other places, would be  
permanent and irretrievable; whereas on  
our fide, they would be temporary facri­  
fices for durable and valuable acquisitions.  
Secondly. The resolutions would have  
the effect of encreafing our marine, and  
thereby at once cheapening and fecuririg  
the carriage of onr productions, and pro­  
viding for our fafety. These advantages  
having been already fufficiently explained,  
need not, he said, be again developed.  
It had been remarked by a member  
from Maflachufetts, (Mr. Ames) that if,  
as dated by a report of Mr. Jefferfon,  
Great-Britain was so often at war, her  
wars, by depriving us of her (hipping,  
would soon have the wished eflcft, of re­  
placing it with American (hipping. This  
reasoning Mr. M. said, supposed what was  
contrary to prudence and probability.  
What merchants would build snips, which  
a peace, always more or less in profpcCt,  
would throw out of employment ;&#x27; unlefg  
it were for special purposes, where the  
momentary gain might. outweigh the  
eventual facrifice.

It had been said that our tonnage was  
prored by the official returns to be in­  
creasing with an unexampled rapidity.  
To this Mr. M. answered ; that the in­  
crease ought not to be compared with o~  
tlier examples, but with our own natural  
faculties, and reasonable expe&amp;ations   
that the increase of our population requir­  
ed an annual increase of at&#x27;leaft five per  
  
cent ; that an a.Tumption by foreigners  
of American names, had probably increa­  
sed the apparent quantity of our (hipping ;  
that the war or preparations for it, by  
withdrawing foreign (hipping, had proba­  
bly also had some little temporary effeift ;  
that the principal cause of the increase,  
was the extenlion of our trade with the  
French dominions, whichi some members  
seemed so little inclined to secure and fof­  
ter, by measures which appeared to him  
belt fitted for the purpose.  
  
He reminded the committee of an ar­  
gument, which had, on former occasions,  
been much p&#x27;refled by several mercantile  
members, for encouraging our own navi­  
gation ; to wit: that American vefftls,  
from a spirit of enterprise, and a unison  
between private and public interests, would  
explore new fields of commerce, and new  
markets for our produce, which foreign  
carriers would leave unattempted. Tiie  
trade to China opened by American vel­  
fcls, had been often ascribed to this cause.  
Mr. M. said the argument seemed to be  
countenanced also, by the present state of  
our mediterranean trade j which had, since  
our independence, been confined by the  
Barbary corsairs to foreign bottoms. Pre­  
vious to the revolution, when American  
vessels could be the carriers, the trade was  
very considerable. Since the excluflon of  
our vessels, though the carriage of our  
produce is fafe to Britilh, and several other  
foreign vessels, yet this branch of trade  
had withered as much as most others have  
grown. In 1790, the exports cleared for  
the mediterranean, were but 31,726 dol­  
lars ; and in the year following, the im­  
ports no more than n,J22 dollars.  
  
Thirdly. Another efFect incident to  
the proposed measure, would be an addi­  
tional encouragement to domestic manu­  
factures.  
  
A gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  
Dexter) had said, he could read no fucli  
tendency in the propositions. Mr. M.  
Thought it impoflible to read the propo­  
sitions with attention, and not perceive,  
that they mud have the like tendency  
with the other means, by which manufac­  
tures had been promoted. If the dutiet  
already laid, were calculated to produce  
this effect, an increase of those duties in  
any instance, mull have a tendency to in­  
crease the effect. In answer to the ob­  
jection that, a change in the policy of  
Great-Britain, might put an end to the  
additional duties, and ensnare those who  
should proceed under the influence of them,  
he remarked, I. That the fame might be  
said in some degree of the regulations now  
in force. A treaty with Great-Britain  
might ftipulatc changes which would af­  
fect our manufacturers. But as there was  
a just confidence, that the intcrefts of this  
dafs of citizens would in this cafe be at­  
tended to by the government j it might  
be expetted, that equal attention would  
be paid to them, in any other cafe. 2.  
The progress of things in this country,  
and the probable acceflion of foreign ma­  
nufacturers, might be relied on to support  
whatever undertakings (hall have once got

4t&#x27;jfy. T.i* prjpofcd rcfolutions would  
favor an advantageous competition and  
dntribution ot our trade, among the ma­  
nufactqri ng nations of Europe. At pre­  
f nt, it may he said to be monopolized by  
one ; To great is tire di&#x27;proporlion of its  
m inufadtures which come to our market.  
I nat this is an evil, has been admitted,  
*;id cinnot be doubted. It exposes us to  
the greateit and molt sudden cmbarrafl*-  
tn« nts from th£ capiiee, the paiTuns, the  
mistaken calculations of mterelt, the bank­  
-1 nptc.es, and the wars of *a Jingle foreign  
country. Miny of embarrafTmcnts  
are felt at the present moment. If it were  
poflible to liquidate them into a pecuniary  
ltatement, it would be found that, in a  
permanent view of our interest, there would  
be economy in making very considerable  
temporary facritices, for the purp9fe of  
dividing our custom among a number of  
competitors. It was not true, that Great  
Britain alone can fupplvthe manufactures  
we want. Fiance, the United Netherlands,  
and fevcral other nat\&gt;ns, are capable of  
Supplying us with a variety of articles, as  
well as the nation from which they now  
come; and, if invited to our markets  
V prudent encouragements in the firft  
mlUuce, will soon lcain to faPnion their  
manufactures to the wants ar,d tailes of  
this country. The policy of favoring* par­  
ticular branches of ftracje, even at some ex­  
pence, in order to guard againlt the evil  
of depending on a single one, was exemp­  
lified by the condu6t of Great Britain her­  
iv lt. A •though he viewed her difci.imina­  
tions generally, refpeaing, us, in .the light  
he had explained ; yet, he thought it pof­  
fibie, that in the iiutance of naval stores  
a-.vl it might be her intention  
to fofler a ri/afeh:p ,n a dillant quar­  
ter, in order to provide against a casual  
pi tvation of the lupplics of a nearer quar­  
ter. 1 nefe artieies are central to the ma­  
rine of Great Britain ; her marine is  
eiTcntial to her greatuefs Were (he to  
have no reiource but in the Baliic, a war  
wfth the Baitfc powers might be fatal to  
hr. .It may be wife in her, therefore, to  
iteep ooen t.e American resource, even at  
tle p?ice of a tax on hei fe:r. In this&#x27; cafe  
(he mult&#x27; quarrel with both the Baltic  
powers and the United States at the fame  
time, be for? thefupplres will be cut off.  
A member from Maflachufetts, (Mr.  
D&amp;ter) had not, Mr. M. said, been very  
eo.uiltent in his i eafoning on this fubjedt.  
rich id contended againit all attempts to  
Excite .a beneficial competition, on the  
idea tli t no competition could be benefi­  
ci 1 .vhich would not spring up of itfelf;  
and yet he had warned us against the dan­  
ger, that Area&#x27;s Britain, by exciting a  
competition agair.ft the United States, in  
tiiofe parts of Europe, which mod refera­  
ble the infant situation of our country,  
might eftablilh new sources from which  
  
supplies would afterwards fpontaiieciufly  
flow tu her, without being «ver again  
w anted from the United States. The fame  
remaik was applicable to the leafoningof  
the other gentlemen who had represented  
the danger of exciting a permanent rival­  
(hip for the Weft-India market, in favour  
of Canada and Nofk Scotia.  
  
Fifthly. The plan of the resolutions  
tended to conciliate nation! in treaty, or  
disposed to be in treat)&#x27; with lis, into ar:  
rangemen:B still more favourable to our  
commerce-. This argument had peculiar  
weight in relation to France. It had been  
said that Great Britain was our belt cus­  
tomer. The fa£l, he said, was that we  
were her bell cullomer: but that France  
w;&#x27;,6 our best customer. We consume more  
of British manufactures than any other  
nation in the world consumes. France  
consumes more of oiir productions, than  
any other nation confurr.e3. He referred  
to the statement* he had before offered for  
proof of this. Her consumption was also  
of the most valuable kind ; and under fa­  
vourable regulations would be a very grow­  
ing one. It confiltcd of wheat and flour,  
kit provisions, and firh; articles which  
were not admitted by Great Britain ; and  
which without the market of France,  
would glut every other.  
Of ourfilh (he consumed si ve eighths of  
the whole exportation. Her use of our  
  
live animals was another important cohfi­  
deration. It amounted, in the lilt of our  
exports, to 352,795 dollars, for the year  
1791. In the fame the Britilh de­  
mand amounted to no more than 62,4.15  
dollars. The superior proportion of na­  
vigation we enjoyed in the French chan­  
nels of intercourfc had already been {hewn.  
In examining the policy of cultivating  
and securing the Fiench markets, he said  
it ought not to be forgotten, that the pro­  
fits and the revenue ariling from the rum  
diltilleries, depended on an article obtain­  
ed almoit, if not from thifc  
French dominions alone ; and which was  
the only raw material of any confequcnce  
imported into the United States. It was  
paid for also, as had been much urged on  
otiiei occalionsby members on the oppo­  
site lide, in the worll fifli, which could  
find a vent in no other part of the world.  
The MolafTes imported into the United  
Statcsin one year, amounted to upwards  
oi leven millions of gallons, more than  
one half of- which went into the state  
of MalTachufetts. He took notice also  
of the article of sugar, as rendered of  
great importance by our habits and our  
finances; and of which more than one  
half was fuppliedby the French Weft-In­  
dies. Out of 17,142,723 dollars impor­  
-9,32 dollars were received  
from that source. The residue came from  
the Danifti, Dutch, and British domini­  
ons, in the following proportions, to  
wit. Danish, 2,833,010 dollars, Dutch  
*»7°7»23 J dollars. Britilh 2,280,647  
dollars. This ltatement was taken from  
the imports of 1790, the only year he  
had been able to examine on this point.  
It had been said, why grant privileges  
before a mutual grant should be secured  
by positive stipulation ? Why throw away  
by a legal regulation, wtoat ought to be  
the price of treaty ? He answered, that  
the legal regulation threw nothing away*  
as i; was always recoverable : That in the  
p: „fer.t iiiftance, it was only meeting the  
legal regulations of which France had set  
the example : that inltead of being a bar  
to treaty, such a courie of proceeding,  
more than any other, would smooth the  
way to it, by explaining the objects, and  
eftabli/hing. a confidence, on both fides—  
that it be happy, if in all cases,  
where treaties are in view, this open and  
cone ilia t orjr -process. could take the place  
of that relerve and mysterious r   
on, with which the parties approach each  
Other. Were Great Britain deiirous of  
forming amicable arrangements by treaty,  
he affced what readier or more prudent  
step could file have taken for the purpose,  
thap to have followed &quot;the example set her,  
by holding out in her laws, the spirit in  
which Hie was willing to meet us in nego­  
ciation ?  
  
on Mr, M.iitjoiis  
  
Having gone through these explanati­  
ons, Mr. M. entered into a view of the  
principal obje&amp;ior.s to the &quot; resolutions  
proposed.  
I. It was said they would diminish the  
revenue, and endanger the funds.  
  
With refped to the public debt, his  
general ideas had been exprefled by several  
who had spoken before him. He acknow­  
ledged that he had disliked and opposed  
the modification given to it; but after it  
had received the fanchon of law, he bad  
entertained no other with on the fubjea,  
than th.it the debt might be honorably  
difeharged, as fact as the circumstances of  
  
ttye country would permit. This he was  
r well frtisfied was the prevailing sentiment  
of the great body of the people, lie did  
not believe, that there was a fingfe state  
in the Union, or any considerable part of  
a single state, that did not acquiesce (where  
they did not approve) in the provisions  
vyhich had been made in behalf of the pub­  
lic creditors. At the fame time he was  
  
equally sure, that it never was either meant  
-by Congress, or understood by the&#x27; public,  
that in mortgaging the import for their  
security, it was to be an hostage to foreign  
countries for our unqualified acquiescence  
in their unequal laws, and to be worrte,  
as long as the debt (hould continue, as a  
badge of national humiliation. The nature  
of the obligation could certainly import no  
more in favor of the creditors, than that  
the fund appropriated (hould be applied,  
as far as requisite, to their nfe ; unless e­  
quivalent funds (hould be substituted ; nor  
more against the public, than that all de­  
ficienrfiei in the fund (hould be made up,  
whether arising without, or in consequence  
of, a change in the laws. If it (hould  
happen,- then, that in consequence of any  
mcafure, dictated by the general good,  
the impofi: (hould become inadequate to  
its obje£t, all that could be exacted by the  
  
public creditors, would be some other  
provision that woiJd supply the defalca­  
tion ; and it ought not to be doubted,  
that the people at large, whose good was  
purfaed, would readily support whatever  
other provision might become indifpenfi­  
ble. He had made these remarks, how­  
ever, with reference to an event, which  
he did not by any means admit to be pro­  
bable. The more he had revolved the fub­  
jedl, the more clearly it appeared to him,  
that a very operative addition might be  
made to the duties on the enumerated arti­  
-cles, without endangering the Aggregate  
product of the importations. Ai.d he en­  
tirely concurred in opinion with those,  
who had observed, that the greatest injury  
which&#x27; could be done to the class of citi­  
zens holding the public paper, was to re­  
present their interests as more to be re­  
garded, than any national considerations  
whatever; and to oppose to the latter,  
even the most imaginary contingencies to  
the former.  
  
(Speech to be continued.)  
  
March 11  
  
Sundry petitions were presented and  
referred.  
  
The House went into committee of the  
whole on the bill to provide, for the de­  
fence of certain ports, See. and, after  
some time spent in the business, the bill was  
reported with amendments and pafled t

4. It had been an objc&amp;ion to   
folutious, that they might deprive us of  
the aid of British capital and credit, which  
were necessary to the prosecution of our  
  
commerce.  
  
Mr. M. did not admit either that the  
effect would happen, or that it would be  
ruinous-to our commerce.  
  
Unless Great Britain fbould, of her  
own choice, put a flop to the commercial  
intercourse with us, which for reasons be­  
fore given would be so much more hurt­  
ful to herfclf than to this country, that it  
never could be presumed ; the resolutions  
would operate only by abridging some of  
out importations, and by varying the  
channels of others, Her capital, as far  
as requisite here, might continue to be em­  
ployed here.  
  
On the general question concerning our  
dependence on British capital and credit,  
he observed that it could not be denied  
that more use was made of them at pre­  
sent, than was either necessary or benefi­  
cial. Credit when extended to consumers,  
as was the cafe throughout the southern  
states, was extremely injurious; as had  
been well explained by a member of Vir­  
ginia (Mr. Nicholas,) and as he himfelf  
h&#x27;ad equally witneffesj. When confined  
to merchants, it might, within certain  
limits, be an advantage ; but it was not  
only his own opinion, but that of better  
judges, that the credit given to our mer­  
chants, was at present excessive and inju-  
  
rious.  
  
In order to form a very precise judg­  
ment on this fubjeft, it would be necefTa­  
ry, he said, to calculate the amount of  
out own capital, and its proportion to the  
amount of our trade. This was a thing  
he supposed, which could not well be done.  
If he had concurred in the doctrine, of  
which so much had been heard both with­  
in and without doors, that a funded debt  
and banks of discount, were equivalent to  
affive capital, he should have a ready an­  
swer to the difficulty,. The paper of the  
two kinds, in the United Staffs, cannot  
amount to less than onehundred millions of  
dollars ; whilst the amount of our ex­  
ports or our imports, does not exceed one  
fourth of that capital. It is true, a part  
of both the public and the bank (locks, is  
in foreign hands ; but, with the mod am­  
ple deductions on that account, the residue,  
if ope:ating in any considerable degree, as  
attive capital, would be a competent re­  
source.  
  
As he did not however view the doc­  
trine in the particular light in which it  
had been painted ; it would he more to  
his purpose, to observe, that there was  
certainly in this country a real mercantile  
capital to a very refpe&amp;able amount;—  
that this was fall inereafing with our in­  
creasing population and wealth ;—that if  
the foreign capital of one country (hould  
be withdrawn, the vacancy would proba­  
bly by degrees be occupied by that of  
other foreign nations J that if it I&#x27;honld  
happen otherwise, there was reason to be­  
lieve. that a reftriftion of our use of fo­  
reign credit, would be rather salutary than  
disadvantageous ; that in fine, as long as  
we had twenty millions of dollars worth of  
produce, wanted by other nations; and  
were willing to take for it, twenty mil­  
lions worth1 of what they wished to part  
with, he was under no apprehension that  
the means of effefhiating an exchange,  
would not be found. Both merchants  
and capital would qiiickly be generated by  
such a state of things, if they did not pre­  
viously exist.  
  
5. It had been observed by fevcral  
members, in allusion to the alledged pro­  
portion of British manufactures consumed  
by us to the entire mass of her manufac­  
tures, that Great Britain would never part  
with her navigation ast, in order to avoid  
a loss of four per cent, in the demaud for  
her manufactures.  
  
To this obje&amp;ion he anfwercd; that  
the eomparifon ought to be our consump­  
tion, not with the entire mass of her ma­  
nufactures, but with the part entering in­  
to her foreign trade ; and then the loss  
would not be four per cent, but, at least  
twenty pet cent ; that this would not be  
the only loss (he would sustain, if (he  
(hould be unwise enough to (lop the in­  
tercourse between the United States and  
  
her dominions; that it had been ilreadf  
(hewn, that, when &#x27;.he apprehended a re­  
ftriftive system on our part, {he was wil­  
ling to pievent it, by relaxing herreftric­  
tive system ; that in times of war, when  
an adherence to that system would distress  
her, {he frequently suspends her navigati­  
on act; that at this moment it is suspend­  
ed in relation to the Wsft-Indies; that  
there could be little doubt, if the tempo­  
rary necessity, were likely to&#x27; be made  
permanent by firm and judicious measure*  
011 our part, chat the remedy for it would  
be. made permanent alio.  
  
6. It was objected that the present wa«  
an improper time for such rcfolutions.  
  
The principal reason given for this was,  
that the negociation between the secretary  
of state and the British minister here, was­  
ftill depending. To (hew that this reason  
was unsound, Mr. M. went into an histo­  
rical view of what had palled in reference  
to commercial arrangements. He read the  
mefiage of the Prelident tp the House of.  
Representatives, oh the 14th of February,  
1791, acquainting them, that steps had  
been taken to ascertain the difpofitionj of  
the British court on the fubjeft, and that  
there was no ground for favorable expec­  
tations. He dated, that in consequence  
of this communication, a committee was  
appointed, who reported that foreign vefc  
fels ought not to be allowed to bring into  
the United States any articles not of the  
produce or manufacture of the country to  
which they belong, and that an additional  
duty of twelve and an half cents ought to  
be laid on all diitilied spirits, the produc­  
tion of any country or place from which  
veflels of the United States were not per­  
mitted to bring them ; that it being very  
near the end of the session when this re­  
port was made, it was referred to the se­  
cretary of state, with an inftru&amp;ion to re­  
port to the next feflion an account of the  
foreign commercial regulations affecting  
the United Stales, with his opinion, &amp;o.  
that at the next feiiion, a letter was re­  
ceived from that officer, intimating that  
in the a&amp;ual state of circumstances, the  
report would not be given in, unless called  
for by the House ; tuat at the present ses­  
sion, the report now before the commit­  
te.&#x27;, was given in, without being called  
for; and was ther fore a proof, that the  
circumstances which had caused the delay  
ha J van fh :d, and t&#x27;.iat at present there  
was nothing in train, according to the o­  
pinlon of the secretary of state, which  
ought to r.ftrain the Legiflaturc from  
proceeding in the business.  
  
In answer to suggestions, that the Bri­  
tish minister had, 11 the correspondence  
with the secretary of state, lately commu­  
nicated by the President, manifefted a fa­  
vorab&#x27;e dif-ofitioi, which hid not been  
improved—Mr. M. recurred to the paf­  
fagc which related to this point. He read  
from the firft letter of Mr. Jeffcrfon to  
Mr. Hammond, dated Nov. 29, 1791, a  
paragraph requesting Mr. H. « to fay,  
whether he was authorized to conclude,,  
or to negociate arrangements with us,  
which may fix the commerce between the  
two countries, on principles of reciprocal  
advantage ?&quot; To this reqiieft Mr. H. on  
the 30th of Nov. 1791, answered, &quot;That  
the King was sincerely disposed to promote  
and facilitate the commercial intercourse  
between the two countries, and that he  
was authorized to communicate to this  
government, his majelty&#x27;s readiness to en­  
ter into a negociation for establishing that  
intercourse upon principles of reciprocal  
benefit.&quot; On Dec. 6, he wrote to Mr.  
J. in order to prevent misapprehension,  
that although he was not yet empowered  
to conclude aiiy definitive arrangement  
with refpeft to the commercial intercourse,  
he still meant it to be Understood, that he  
was fully authorized to enter into a ne­  
gociation for that puipofe, Sec. The re­  
ply of Mr. J. on the 13th of Dec. inform­  
ed Mr. H. that he had laid his letters be­  
for the President, and was ready to re­  
ceive a communication of his full powers,  
for entering into the negociation, See.  
This was followed next day by a letter  
from Mr. H. stating, that he had no spe­  
cial commiflion to conclude any definitive  
arrangement upon the fubjeft of commer­  
cial i ltercourfe—but that he conceived  
himfelf fully competent to enter into a ne­  
gociation, and the difcuflion of principles  
that might be the bafisof such definitive  
arrangement—and that this opinion of hit  
competency was founded on the instruc­  
tions which were to regulate his personal  
conduct, and the general plenipotentiary  
chara&amp;er in which he had been sent, and  
received.

Mr. H&#x27;s letter he observed, closed the  
correspondence on the fubjeit of commer­  
cial arrangements, being justly considered  
by the executive as a final proof, that the  
pawers of Mr. H. were incompetent, and  
irrelative to the object ; and that it would  
be improper to open a foi-mal negociation  
with him, under them. His inftruftions  
might be a rule and a warrant to himfelf,  
but not being even exhibited, could be no  
evidence of his authority, to the executive.  
And his plenipotentiary commission in the  
ordinary form, could never be underttood  
as relating to the special objects he pro­  
posed to discuss. According to the usage  
of nations, a special commission is, in such  
cases, always furnilhed and required. Mr.  
M. was persuaded, that no sovereign in  
Europe would listen for a moment to such  
a claim as that of Mr. H. and that the  
Britifli court would have been offended  
at such an one from an American minister.  
He thought therefore that the executive  
had equally consulted dignity aud pru­  
dence, in silently dnoppiug thy fubjeft in  
the fame manner they did, until Mr. H.  
should receive and produce adequate pow­  
ers in theaccuftomed form; as might rea­  
sonably be expected, if his court was c(uly  
disposed to meet the United States, in an  
amicable arrangement of commerce, by  
  
treaty.  
  
That the con ft ruction put by Mr. H.  
on his powers, was inadmissible, appeared  
to Mr. M. to lefult from theconftru&amp;ion  
itfelf. v Either thp general plenipotentiary  
commifiion was tp be taken in the techni­  
cal and limited ferife in which it is appplied  
to the ordinary diplomatic objects of a  
stationary public minister ; or, in a literal  
sense, without regard to fueh limitation.  
In the former sense, it clearly does not ex­  
tend to negociations for a treaty. In the  
latter sense it would extend to the concluji­  
on of a treaty, and not merely to negotia­  
tion, as Mr. H. explains and limits.  
  
Mr. M. adverted next to the state of  
the correspondence relating to the treaty  
of peace. It appeared, he observed, that  
as long ago as the 29th of May, 1792,  
the Secretary of State had addressed to  
Mr. Hammmond, a full explanation of  
our rights and demands, under that treaty  
—that on the 2d June, Mr. Hammond  
informed the Secretary, that he (hould  
transmit it without delay for the consider­  
ation of his court; and accordingly did  
forward it in the course of a few days; that  
on the 13th Nov. 1792, previous to the  
present meeting of Congress, Mr. H. was  
desired by the Secretary, in pursuance of  
a charge from the President, to let him  
know whether an answer could yet be  
given to the letter of May 29, 1782; Mr.  
H. replied that it could not, ; but that  
he was confident the delay was to be as­  
cribed to the continuance of the cause al­  
luded to in a former answer to a similar re­  
quell.  
  
The cause alluded to was the interetting  
po ft lire of things in Europe, which it  
was said, had diverted the attention of the  
British government to obje£ts of a more  
pressing nature ; and this consideration  
had been urged by several members, as  
an apology for the filerice observed towards  
the United Slates. Mr. Madifonthought  
very differently. The interval between  
the receipt of the letter written by the  
Secretary in May 1792 ; and the accelTi­  
on of Great Britain to the war against  
France, had been fufficieut for the pur­  
pose of preparing and fending the proper  
inftru&amp;ions to Mr. H. Mr. M. added,  
that the profpe£t of being engaged in new  
controversies of a more serious kind in­  
  
(lead &lt;jf juftifying an inattention to an ex­  
isting one, ought to have quickened the  
efforts for a previous settlement of the lat­  
ter. This is the courfc dictated by pru­  
dence, to nations as well as to individuals;  
and where a right disposition concurs, it  
is the natural course.  
  
It had beeii mentioned as a further rea­  
son ajainll the commercial proportions,  
at this time, that they might draw upon  
us the resentments of the Combined pow­  
ers. Mr. M. could fee no ground for  
such an apprehension. The Combined  
powers were pretty fully occupied with  
France ; they could have no pretext for  
conceining themselves with us, in a cafe  
where we did not concern ourselves with  
them ; and there was the less room for  
imagining that the combination could  
mifconllrue the measure into an offence  
against: them ; as two of the parties, Prus­  
sia and the United Netherlands were in  
treaty with the United States, and are  
favored by the propofitioris.  
  
7. It was finally contended that admit­  
ing our situation to be such as had beea  
described, the mode proposed was an ob­  
je&amp;ionable one.  
  
Mr. M. said he had no predilections for  
the mode that could prevent his giving  
a ready preference to a better, if a bfctter  
should be offered. And unless it (honld  
be said, that the Legislature ought to ad­  
journ without doing any thing for the  
public relief, he thought it incumbent on  
those who objected to one proposition to  
fuhftitute another that would be less ob­  
je&amp;ionable. By this he meant a propo­  
sition not merely better in itfelf; but one  
that would probably be thought so, both  
within and without doots; and be more  
likely to coincide with the sentiments of  
erery part of the union, as well as to con­  
ciliate a majority of voices in the public  
  
councils,  
  
The firft que!Kon,he said, was whether  
any thing ought to be done. If this be  
decided in the affirmative, as he presum­  
ed to be the Wenfe of a majority of the  
committee—and if war was not in con­  
templation as of course was taken for  
granted ; the next question could only lie  
between negotiation, and commercial re­  
gulations. Negociation it had been (hewn  
was in no train, or profpeft, that could  
juftify reliance on it. Commercial regu­  
lations alone remained. They would be  
pacific in their operation. They were  
the means belt suited to the temper of our  
constituents. And he fmcerely believed,  
that, If judiciously framed, they would be  
more likely to answer the reasonable pur­  
poses of the community, than any others  
that could be proposed

tuning the train of his observa­  
tions, he proceeded to explain the reme­  
dial operations ot ids proposition*.  
First,—They will make the nation  
sensible, that we can, by just and paci­  
fic means, inflict consequences which  
will make it her interest, to pay a just  
regard to our rights and interests.  
To enforce this tendency, he enlarged  
on the ideas he had formerly expressed  
in relation to the dependence of G, Bri- |  
tain on the commerce ot the U. States  
and the obvious .md essential dependance  
©f the British W.lndies, on the supplies !  
of the U. States.  
On the latter subject, he entered into i  
a particular reply to the member from j  
Massachusetts (Mr. Ames) who had I  
argued, that the British regulation of j  
the&#x27; trade between the U.S. and the W. j  
Indies, was conformable to the princi- i  
pies nf the colony system as established I  
r&gt;y the commercial nations of Europe, •  
ran-1 could not therefore be reasonably  
Complained of. 2. That the W Indies  
Cpuld obtain supplies from other quar- |  
t« rs, and did not therefore depend on j  
theU. States; nay, that there was dan- !  
per by forcing these supplies into other  
channels, of our losing that branch of  
tia.de- altogether. 3. That ihe trade  
would hardly employ more than a dozen  
ljh|&#x27;,s, and was* therefore not worth con­  
ti i.ding for.  
Iv answer to the first argument of Mr.  
Ames, Mr Madison undertook to shew,  
that G. Britain had not pursued, but  
violated the principles of the colony sys­  
um. The true spirit of this system, he  
said, w us to confine the trade between the j  
pareut country and the colony, to their j  
  
11 vessels, And to tXStrir ffs little trade I  
as possible, between li-.c jjolony and fo- j  
reign countries; but when a trarle with |  
h foreign country becarfll -&quot;V to ,&#x27;  
t&#x27;-i- colony, to allow the foi &lt;  
the same carrying priyiieges-a&#x27;iowed to ;  
their own. Colonies, he said, were to  
be considered as parts t f a c. ir.mQn em­  
pire. The trade between one part and  
another, as between London and King­  
ston in Jamaica&#x27;, was to be considered  
equally an internal tr:id&gt;- with the coast­  
ing trade between London £c Li­  
verpool, or the trade between different  
ports of the U. States ; and might, it  
led expedient, be equally restrained  
to domestic bottoms, but when a trade  
was openi • a colony and a fo­  
ri urn Country the case was changed ;  
the foreign country became a party,  
! and had a reciprocal claim to the use of  
its bottom , as much in the trade with j  
the colony, as with any other part of the  
re, to which the colony belonged.  
In supported; this doctrine. M&gt;. M dison  
referred to the example ofeverv nation |  
ope, except that of G. Britain,!  
which had American colonies. Den- J  
murk, Sweden, the IT. Netherlands, i  
Prance, Spain and Portugal, had their j  
colonies, as well as G, Britain ; and  
some of them rigovno-dv attached to the  
principles of thecolony system ; yet not  
■: of these nation-, had refu &gt;ed,  
■ ever a trad* was permitted at all  
between the colonies and another coun­  
try*, to make the carriage common to  
-ol both parties, G. Britain  
\ alone had* attempted a monopoly in Mich

&#x27;•oiefore was an innovation on the  
Stem, as well as an infraction

I In answer to the 2d position of Mr.  
Ames, he denied that permanent  
plies of provisions and lumber con&#x27;  
derived from any other par. of the * otid  
  
than the IT. H. : not from the northern  
parts of Europe, which either did not  
produce, or were to remote to send  
tu&#x27;an ; not from the southern parts of ,&#x27;  
Europe, which depended th&#x27; mseives on  
the northern parts and on America:  
not from G. hhjjtaio, which imported  
J bread, for hen&quot; own use, amounting one

to rival 1 her U. S. in any article-but thai  
of salt provisions ; n&#x27;nd this wassomuch  
dearer that a prohibition alone of ours,  
could gain a market for hers. The  
gentleman had relied on the capacity of  
Ireland to extend her cultivation of  
wheat, so as spare supplies of this arti­  
cle also. Such a revolution hi her inte  
rior state was not very prohabl&quot;. But  
he iHght at least to have ivinemiu

It was a waste of time, Mr. Madison  
said, to disprove by minute enquiries,  
the possibility of supplying the British  
W. Indies from the old continent, on  
terms that would not be worM than  
abandoning them altogether. The truth  
was, that the gentleman (Mi. Ames)  
had, in this particular, gone beyond the  
most sanguine advocates of the British  
policy, Mr. Knox and lord Sheffield  
themselves, who limited their ultimate  
hopes ot supporting the W. Indies with­  
out the aid of the U. S, to the remaining  
possessions of (i. Britain on this conti­  
nent. He would proceed, he said, to  
shew what foundation there was for the  
opinion of these gentlemen, and the  
gentleman from Massachusetts, in favor  
of this resource. And he was able t­  
give the most full and decisive evidence  
in the case, by recurring to an authen­  
tic document of our own, from which it  
appeared, that the continental colonies  
of G.Britain, instead of being able to  
furnish the W. India colonies, were  
themselves dependant for the very «rti­  
cles wanted there, on the supplies of the  
U. States.  
In the official statement of our exports  
for the year as late as 1791, most of the  
articles sent to the British continental:  
colonies we-re of a sort and an amount so  
directly to the point, that he hoped the !  
committee would excuse him for repeav j  
ling them in detail.  
He stated tuem as follows:  
  
Bread Stuffs and Roots.  
Wheat bushels 3,150
