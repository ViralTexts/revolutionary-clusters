I have duly recieved, dear Madam, your favor of the 10th with the eloquent Circular and Address to your patriotic and fair companions in good works. I well recollect our acquaintance with yourself personally in Washington, valued for your own merit as well as for that of your esteemed father. your connection too with the family of the late Colo Morgan is an additional title to my grateful recollections. he first gave us notice of the mad project of that day, which if suffered to proceed, might have brought afflicting consequences on persons whose subsequent lives have proved their integrity and loyalty to their country.  
The effort which is the subject of your letter is truly laudable, and, if generally followed as an example, or practised as a duty, will change very advantageously the condition of our fellow citizens, &amp; do just honor to those who shall have taken the lead in it. no one has been more sensible than myself of the advantage of placing the consumer by the side of the producer, nor more disposed to promote it by example. but these are among the matters which I must now leave to others. time, which wears all things, does not spare the energies either of body or mind of a presque Octogenaire. while I could, I did what I could, and now acquiesce chearfully in the law of nature which, by unfitting us for action, warns us to retire and leave to the generation of the day the direction of it’s own affairs. the prayers of an old man are the only contributions left in his power. mine are offered sincerely for the success of your patriotic efforts, and particularly for your own individual happiness &amp; prosperity.

MonTiCELLO, January 18, 1822.  
Mrs. Katherine D. Morgan:  
I have duly received, dear madam, your favor of  
the 10th, with your eloquent circular and address  
to your fair companions in good works. I well  
recollect yourself personally in Washington,  
valued for your own merit, as well as for that of  
your esteemed father. Your connection, too, with  
the family of the late Cola Morgan is an additional  
title to my grateful recollections. He first gave  
notice of the mad project of that day, which, if  
suftered to proceed, might have brought afflicting  
consequences to persons whose subsequent lives  
have proved their integrity and loyalty to this  
count-  
The effort which is the object of your letter is  
truly laudable, and if generally followed as an ex­  
ample or practiced as a duty will change very ad-  
vantageously the condition of our fellow-citizens,  
and do honor to those who shall have taken the  
lead in it.  
No one has been more sensible than myself of  
the advantage of placing the consumer by the side  
of the producer, nor more disposed to promote it  
by exumple. Lut these are how among the mat­  
ters which I must leave to others. Time, which  
wears all things, does not spare the energies either  
of the body or the mind of a presue octogenarian.  
whe I cold, I did what I could, and now acul­  
esce cheerfully in the law of nature which, by un  
fitting us for action, warns us to retire and leay  
to the generation of the day the direction of its  
own affairs. The prayers of the old man are the  
onty contiibution lelt in his power. Mine are  
offered sincerely for the success of your patri  
otic efforts, and particularly for your own indi  
viual napplness and prospeity  
IIIOML AS JEEE ERSON
