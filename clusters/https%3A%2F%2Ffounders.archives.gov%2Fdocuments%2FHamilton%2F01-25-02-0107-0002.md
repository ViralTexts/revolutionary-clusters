It only remained for the undersigned to quit France, leaving the United States involved in a contest, and according to appearances, soon alone in a contest, which it might be as difficult for them to relinquish with honor, as to pursue with a prospect of advantage; or else to propose a temporary arrangement, reserving for a definitive adjustment, points which could not then be satisfactorily settled, and providing in the mean time against a state of things, of which neither party could profit.
