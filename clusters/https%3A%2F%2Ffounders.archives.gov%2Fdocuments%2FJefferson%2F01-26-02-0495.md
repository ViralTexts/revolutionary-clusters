Sir  
Philadelphia July 24. 1793.  
  
Your favor of the 9th. instant covering the information of Silvat Ducamp, Pierre Nouvel, Chouquet de Savarence, Gaston de Nogeré and G. Beustier, that being on their passage from the French West Indies to the United States, on board merchant vessels of the United States with slaves and merchandize of their property, these vessels were stopped by British armed vessels and their property taken out as lawful prize.  
I believe it cannot be doubted but that, by the general law of nations, the goods of a friend found in the vessel of an enemy are free, and the  goods of an enemy found in the vessel of a friend are lawful prize. Upon this principle, I presume, the British armed vessels have taken the property of French Citizens found in our vessels in the cases abovementioned, and I confess I should be at a loss on what principle to reclaim it. It is true that sundry nations, desirous of avoiding the inconveniencies of having their vessels stopped at sea, ransacked, carried into port and detained, under pretence of having enemy goods aboard, have, in many instances, introduced by their special treaties, another principle between them, that enemy bottoms shall make enemy goods, and friendly bottoms friendly goods; a principle much less embarrassing to commerce, and equal to all parties in point of gain and loss: but this is altogether the effect of particular treaty, controuling in special cases the general principle of the law of nations, and therefore taking effect between such nations only as have so agreed to controul it. England has generally determined to adhere to the rigorous principle, having in no instance, as far as I recollect, agreed to the modification of letting the property of the goods follow that of the vessel, except in the single one of her treaty with France. We have adopted this modification in our treaties with France, the United Netherlands, and Prussia: and therefore as to them, our vessels cover the goods of their enemies, and we lose our goods when in the vessels of their enemies. Accordingly you will be pleased to recollect that in the late case of Holland &amp; Mackie, citizens of the United States who had laden a cargo of flour on board a British vessel which was taken by the French Frigate the Ambuscade and brought into this port, when I reclaimed the cargo, it was only on the ground that they were ignorant of the declaration of war when it was shipped. You observed, however, that the 14th. Article of our treaty had provided that ignorance should not be pleaded beyond two months after the declaration of war, which term had elapsed in this case by some few days, and finding that to be the truth, though their real ignorance of the declaration was equally true, I declined the reclamation, as it never was in my view to reclaim the cargo, nor apparently in yours to offer to restore it, by questioning the rule established in our treaty that enemy bottoms make enemy goods. With England, Spain, Portugal, and Austria, we have no treaties: therefore we have nothing to oppose to their acting according to the general law of nations, that enemy goods are lawful prize though found in the bottom of a friend. Nor do I see that France can suffer on the whole. For though she loses her goods in our vessels when found therein by England, Spain, Portugal, or Austria, yet she gains our goods when found in the vessels of England, Spain, Portugal, Austria, the United Netherlands, or Prussia: and I believe I may safely affirm that we have more goods afloat in the vessels of these six nations than France has afloat in our vessels: and consequently that  
France is the gainer and we the loser by the principle of our treaty. Indeed we are losers in every direction of that principle, for when it works in our favor, it is to save the goods of our friends, when it works against us, it is to lose our own, and we shall continue to lose while the rule is only partially established. When we shall have established it with all Nations we shall be in a condition neither to gain nor lose, but shall be less exposed to vexatious searches at sea. To this condition we are endeavoring to advance, but as it depends on the will of other nations as well as our own, we can only obtain it when they shall be ready to concur.  
I cannot therefore but flatter myself that on revising the cases of Ducamp and others, you will perceive that their losses result from the state of war which has permitted their enemies to take their goods tho’ found in our vessels; and consequently from circumstances over which we have no controul.  
The rudeness to their persons practised by their enemies is certainly not favorable to the character of the latter. We feel for it as much as for the extension of it to our own Citizens their companions, and find in it a motive the more for requiring measures to be taken which may prevent repetitions of it. I have the honor to be

YOUR favour of the gth inſt. covered the information of Silvat  
Ducamp, Pierre Neuvel, Chouquet de Savarence, Gaſton de No-  
gere, and G. Beauſtier, that being on their paſſage from the French  
Welt Indies to the United States, with ſlaves and merchandiſe of  
their property, theſe veſſels were ſtopped by Britiſh armed veſſels,  
and their property taken out as lawful prize. |  
  
I believe it. cannot be doubted, but that by the general law of na-  
tions, the goods of a friend found in the veſſels of an enemy, are free,  
and the goods of an enemy, found in the veſſel of a friend, are law-  
ful prize. Upon this principle, I preſume, the Britiſh armed veſ-  
ſels have taken the property of French citizens found in our veſſels,  
in the caſes above mentioned, and I confeſs I ſhould be at a loſs on  
what principle to reclaim it. It is true, that ſundry nations, deſirous of  
avoiding the inconvenience of having their veſſels ſtopped at ſea, ran-  
ſaeked, carried into port, detained, under pretence of having enemy&#x27;s  
goods on board, have, in many inſtances, introduced by their ſpecial  
treaties, another principle between them, that enemy bottoms ſhall make  
enemy goods, and friendly bottoms friendly goods ; a principle much  
lefs embarraſſing to commerce, and _ to all parties in point of gain  
and loſs; but this is altogether the effect of particular treaty, controul-  
ing, in ſpecial caſes, the general principle of the law of nations, and  
therefore taking effect between ſuch nations only as have ſo agreed  
to oontroul it. England has generally determined to adhere to the  
rigorous principle, having, in no inſtance, as far as I recollect,  
agreed to modification of ing the property of the goods follow  
that of the veſſel, except in the ſingle one of her treaty with France.  
We have adopted this modification in our treaties with France, the  
United Netherlands, and Pruſha ; and therefore, as to them, our veſ-  
ſels cover the goods of their enemies, and we loſe our goods when  
in the veſſels of their enemies. Accordingly, you will be pleaſed to  
recollect, that in the late caſe of Holland and Mackie, citizens of  
the United States, who had laden a cargo of flour on board a Britiſh  
veſſel, which was taken by the French frigate Ambuſcade, and  
brought into this port; when I reclaimed the cargo, it was only on  
the ground that they were ignorant of the declaration of war when  
it was ſhi | .  
  
You , ed, however, that the 14th article of our treaty had  
provided, that ignorance ſhould not be pleaded beyond two monthy-  
after the declaration of war, which term had elapſed, in this caſe, by  
ſome few days; and finding that to be the truth, though their real  
ignorance was equally true, I declined the reclamation, as it never  
  
  
was in my view to reclaim the cargo, nor in yours to offer to reſtore  
it, by queſtioning the rule eſtabliſhed in our treaty, that enemy bot-  
toms make enemy goods. With England, Spain, Portugal and Auſ-  
tria, we have no treaties; therefore we have nothing to oppoſe to  
their acting according to the general law of nations, that enemy  
are lawful prize, though found in the bottoms of a friend. Nor @&#x27;T  
ſee that France can ſuffer, on the whole, for though ſhe loſes her  
goods in our veſſels, when found therein by England, Spain, Portu-  
gal or Auſtria, yet ſhe gains our goods when found in the veſſels of  
gland, Spain, Portugal, Auſtria, the United Netherlands, or  
Pruſſia; I believe I may ſafely affirm, that we have more goods  
afloat in the veſſels of theſe fix nations, than France has afloat in our  
veſſels, and conſequently, that France is the gainer, and we the loſer,  
by the principle of our treaty ; indeed we are loſers in every direction  
of that principle ; for when it works in our favour, it is to fave the  
goods of our friends; when it works againſt us, it is to loſe our own;  
and we ſhall continue to lofe, while the rule is only partially eſta-  
bliſned. When we ſhall have eſtabliſhed it with all nations, we ſhall  
be in a condition neither to gain nor loſe, but ſhall be leſs expoſed td  
vexatious ſearches at ſea. To this condition we are endeavouring to  
advance ; but as&#x27;it depends on the will of other nations, as&#x27; well as  
our own, we can only obtain it when they ſhall be ready to concur.  
I cannot, therefore, but flatter myſelf, that on reviſing the cafes  
of Ducamp and others, you will perceive, that their loſſes reſult  
from the ſtate of war, which has permitted their enemies to take their  
— though found in our veſſels, and conſequently, from circum-  
ces over which we have no controul. |  
The rudeneſs to their perſons practiſed by their enemies, is cer-  
tainly not favourable to the character of the latter. We feel for it as  
much as for the extenſion of it to our own citizens, their compa-  
nions, and find in it a motive for requiring meaſures to be- taken,  
which may prevent repetitions of it. |

Your favor ef the 9th instant, covered the) in. 1  
formation of Silvat Ducamp, Pierre Nouvel, Chou- ;  
quet de Savarence, Gafton de Nogere, and G. 1  
Ben(ticr, that being on their paflage from the &#x27;  
French Well-Indies to the United Stated, on board 1  
veflHsof the United States, with (laves and mcr- &#x27;  
chandize of their property, thefc vefFels were (top- &#x27;  
ped by British armed vessels, and their property I  
taken out as lawful prize. 1  
I believe it cannot be doubled, but by tht general &#x27;  
low of uations, the goods of a friend found in the &#x27;  
vefTel of an enemy, are free, arid the goods of an 1  
enemy found in the -Bejel of a friend, art lawful prize. J  
Upon this principle, 1 prel&#x27;ume, the Britifo armed 1  
vessels have taken tile property of Trench citizens i  
found in our vessels, in the cases above-mentioned, 1  
and I confels I Jhould be at a loft on what principle &#x27;  
to reclaim it. ft is true, that sundry nations, ds­  
- of avoiding the incouveniencies of having  
their vessels Hopped at fca, ransacked, carried into  
port, and detained, under pretence of having enc­  
inies goods on board, have, in many infiancei, 1  
introduced, by tbeir special treaties, another prin­  
ciple between them, that enemy bottoms (hall make  
enemy goads, aod friendly bottoms friendly goods j

trolling&#x27; in fpccial cases, the general piinciplc  
v of the law of nations, and therefore taking oiFeft  
between such nation only as have f« agreed to con-  
Ce troul it. England lias generally determined to ad­  
,s&quot; here to the rigorous principle, having in no in­  
&#x27; fiance, as far as I recwlleAi agreed to the modifi­  
cation of letting the property of the goods fallow  
that of the vessel, except in the fingh one of her  
,j][ tieaty with Fiance. We have adopted this mo­  
dification in our treaties with Fiance, the United  
,]e Netherlands and Pruflia, and therefore, as to them,  
;n our vessels cover tlie jfoods of their enemies, and  
we-lofc our goods when in the vessels of their ene­  
]&#x27;r mies. Accordingly, you will be pleafcd to recol­  
jjt left, that in the cafe of Holland and Mackie, ci­  
-0 tizens of the United States, who had laden a cargo  
of flour on board a Britijh vessel, which was taken  
hy the French frigate Ainbulcade, and brought in-  
jlc .o this port tvhen I reclaimed the cargo, it was  
only on the ground that they were ignorant of the  
declaration of war when it was (hipped. You ob^  
served, however, that the 14th article of our treaty  
had provided that ignorance should not be pleaded  
a beyond two months after the declaration of war,  
n which term had elapsed, in this cafe, by some few  
days; and finding that to be the truth, thotiph  
t0 their real ignorance was equally true, I deslir.edthe  
vt reclamation, as it never was in my. view to reclaim the  
u cargo, nor in yours to offer to rejlort it, hy qutJUon­  
ing the rule ejlablijhed in our treaty, that enemy bot­  
toms make enemy goods. With Engla»d, Spain,  
Portugal and Austria, we have no treaties, there­  
fore WE HATE NOTHING TO OPPOSE to their afiing  
it according to the general law of nations, that tnemy  
ft- goods are lawful prize, though found in the bottoms  
lr cf a friend. Nor do 1 fee that France can fuffer  
r_ on the whole, for though (he loses her goods in cur  
vessels, when found therein by England, Spain,&quot;  
j Portugal or Au&lt;lria,yet Jhe gains our goods, when  
f found in the vessels of England, Spain, Portugal,  
j Austria, the United Netherlands or Pruflia ; and  
I believe I may fafely affirm, that we have more  
goods afloat in the vessels of these fix nations, than  
France has afloat in our vessels, and consequently,  
T THAT FRANCE IS THE GAINER, AMD WE THILOSER,  
by the principle or our treaty ; indeed we  
ate losers in every diredtion of that principle ; for  
j when it works in eur favor, it is to save #&gt;e goods  
P of our friends ; when it works against ui, it is to  
lose our own, and we (hall continue to lose, while  
J the rule is only partially established. When we  
shall have established it with all nations, we fball be
