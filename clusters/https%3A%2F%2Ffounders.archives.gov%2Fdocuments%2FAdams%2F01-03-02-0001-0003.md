r the Reparation of our Carriage, after Dinner We walked about the Village and visited the Church of Notre Dame de Halle, but saw nothing but what is very common. The Village is dirty and poor.... What a Contrast to the Villages of Holland.

Oct. 23. Wednesday.  
  
  
Rode to Mons in a great Rain, dined at the Couronne De L’Impereur, very well and very cheap, rode to Valenciennes and found our Axletree broken again. Put up at the Post house.  
Walked about the Town, the Churches all shut, and nothing remarkable.  
  
The bright rosy morning, peeps over the Hills  
With blushes adorning, the Meadows and Fields.  
  
  
The merry, merry, merry horn, calls come, come away  
Awake from your Slumbers, and hail the new Day.  
  
  
The Stag rous’d before Us, away seems to fly  
And pants to the Chorus of Hounds in full Cry.  
  
  
The follow, follow, follow, follow, the musical Chase  
While Pleasure and Vigour each other embrace.  
  
  
The day Sports being over, makes blood circle right  
And gives the brisk Lover, fresh Charms for the night.  
  
  
Then Let Us, Let us now enjoy, all We can while We may  
Let Love crown the night Boys, as our Sports crown the day.  
  
  
The Banks of the Dee.  
T’was Summer, when softly the Breezes were blowing  
And sweetly the Nightingale sang from the Tree  
At the Foot of a Rock, where the River was flowing  
I sat myself down on the Banks of the Dee.  
  
  
Flow on lovely Dee! flow on thou sweet River  
Thy Bank’s, purest Stream! shall be dear to me, ever  
For then I first gain’d the Affections and favour  
Of Jemmy, the Glory and Pride of the Dee.  
  
  
But now he is gone and has left me, thus mourning  
To quel the proud Tyrant, for valiant is he  
And Ah! there’s nae hope of his speedy returning  
To stroll here again on the Banks of the Dee.  
  
  
He’s gone hapless youth, o’er the wide roaring Billows  
The kindest the sweetest of all the young Fellows  
And has left me to wander among the green Willows  
The loneliest Lass, on the Banks of the Dee.  
  
But time and my Prayers may perhaps yet restore him  
Sweet Peace may return my dear Soldier to me  
And when he returns, with such Care, I’ll watch o’er him  
He n’eer shall again leave the Banks of the Dee.  
  
  
The Dee then shall flow all its Beauties displaying  
The Lambs shall again on its Ba

The ecchoing horn calls the Sportsmen abroad  
To horse, my brave Boys, and away  
The morning is up and the Cry of the hounds  
Upbraids our too tedious Delay.  
  
  
  
What Pleasure We find in pursuing the Fox  
O’er hills and o’er Valleys he flies  
Then follow, W’ell soon overtake him. Huzza  
The Traitor is seized on and dies.  
  
  
Tryumphant returning at night with our Spoils  
Like Bacchanals shouting and gay  
How Sweet with a Bottle and Lass to refresh  
And loose the Fatigues of the Day.  
  
  
With Sport, Love and Wine fickle Fortune defy  
Dull Wisdom all Happiness sours  
Since Life is no more than a Passage at best  
Let’s strew the Way over with Flowers.

Now the Hill Tops are burnished, with Azure and Gold  
And the Prospect around Us most bright to behold  
The hounds are all trying the Mazes to trace  
The Steeds are all neighing and pant for the Chase  
Then rouse each true Sportsman, and join at the Dawn  
The Song of the Huntsman, and Sound of the Horn.  
The Horn, The Horn, the Song of the Huntsman  
and Sound of the Horn.  
  
  
Wherever We go Pleasure waits on Us still  
If We sink in the Valley, or rise on the Hill  
See the Downs now we leave, and the Coverts appear  
As eager We follow, the Fox or the Hare.  
The Horn, The Horn, the Song of the Huntsman  
and Sound of the Horn.  
  
  
O’er Hedges and Ditches We valiantly fly  
For fearless of Death We ne’er think we shall die.  
Chorus.  
  
  
From Ages long past by the Poets we are told  
That Hunting was lov’d by the Sages of old  
That the Soldier and Huntsman were both on a Par  
That the health giving Chase made them bold in the War.  
Chorus.  
  
  
  
The Chase being over away to the Bowl  
The full flowing Bumper shall chear up our Soul  
Whilst Jocund our Songs shall with Chorus’s ring  
A Toast to our Lasses, our Country and King.  
Chorus.
