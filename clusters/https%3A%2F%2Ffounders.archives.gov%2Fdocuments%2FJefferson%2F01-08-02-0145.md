Paris June 7, 1785  
  
I have been honoured with the receipt of your letter of the 2d. instant, and am to thank you, as I do sincerely for the partiality with which you receive the copy of the Notes on my country. As I can answer for the facts therein reported on my own observation, and have admitted none on the report of others which were not supported by evidence sufficient to command my own assent, I am not afraid that you should make any extracts you please for the Journal de physique which come within their plan of publication. The strictures on slavery and on the constitution of Virginia are not of that kind, and they are the parts which I do not wish to have made public, at least till I know whether their publication would do most harm or good. It is possible that in my own country these strictures might produce an irritation which would indispose the people towards the two great objects I have in view, that is the emancipation of their slaves, and the settlement of their constitution on a firmer and more permanent basis. If I learn from thence, that they will not produce that effect, I have printed and reserved just copies enough to be able to give one to every young man at the College. It is to them I look, to the rising generation, and not to the one now in power for these great reformations. Th

I will beg leave to say here a few words on the general question of the degeneracy of animals in America. 1. As to the degeneracy of the man of Europe transplanted to America, it is no part of  Monsr. de Buffon’s system. He goes indeed within one step of it, but he stops there. The Abbé Raynal alone has taken that step. Your knowlege of America enables you to judge this question, to say whether the lower class of people in America, are less informed and less susceptible of information than the lower class in Europe: and whether those in America who have received such an education as that country can give, are less improved by it than Europeans of the same degree of education. 2. As to the Aboriginal man of America, I know of no respectable evidence on which the opinion of his inferiority of genius has been founded but that of Don Ulloa. As to Robertson, he never was in America, he relates nothing on his own knowlege, he is a compiler only of the relations of others, and a mere translator of the opinions of Monsr. de Buffon. I should as soon therefore add the translators of Robertson to the witnesses of this fact, as himself. Paw, the beginner of this charge, was a compiler from the works of others; and of the most unlucky description; for he seems to have read the writings of travellers only to collect and republish their lies. It is really remarkeable that in three volumes 12mo. of small print it is scarcely possible to find one truth, and yet that the author should be able to produce authority for every fact he states, as he says he can. Don Ulloa’s testimony is of the most respectable. He wrote of what he saw. But he saw the Indian of South America only, and that after he had passed through ten generations of slavery. It is very unfair, from this sample, to judge of the natural genius of this race of men: and after supposing that Don Ulloa had not sufficiently calculated the allowance which should be made for this circumstance, we do him no injury in considering the picture he draws of the present Indians of S. America as no picture of what their ancestors were 300 years ago. It is in N. America we are to seek their original character: and I am safe in affirming that the proofs of genius given by the Indians of N. America, place them on a level with Whites in the same uncultivated state. The North of Europe furnishes subjects enough for comparison with them, and for a proof of their equality. I have seen some thousands myself, and conversed much with them, and have found in them a male, sound understanding. I have had much information from men who had lived among them, and whose veracity and good sense were so far known to me as to establish a reliance on their information. They have all agreed in bearing witness in favour of the genius of this people. As to their bodily strength, their manners rendering it disgraceful  to labour, those muscles employed in labour will be weaker with them than with the European labourer: but those which are exerted in the chase and those faculties which are employed in the tracing an enemy or a wild beast, in contriving ambuscades for him, and in carrying them through their execution, are much stronger than with us, because they are more exercised. I beleive the Indian then to be in body and mind equal to the whiteman. I have supposed the blackman, in his present state, might not be so. But it would be hazardous to affirm that, equally cultivated for a few generations, he would not become so. 3. As to the inferiority of the other animals of America, without more facts I can add nothing to what I have said in my Notes. As to the theory of Monsr. de Buffon that heat is friendly and moisture adverse to the production of large animals, I am

See Jefferson’s Memoirs, vol. 1. p. 229. * As to the  
original man of America, I know of no respectable  
evidence on which the opinion of the inferiority of  
genius has been founded, but that of Don Uloa.  
Don Uloa’s testimony is the most respectable. He  
wrote of what he saw ; but he saw the Indian of  
South America only, and that, after he had passed  
through ten generations of slavery. It is very unfair  
from this sample to judge of the natural genius of  
this race of nen ; and after supposing that Don U-  
loa had not sufficiently calculated the allowance  
which should be made for this circumstance, we do  
him no injury in considering the picture he draws of  
the present Indians of South America, as no picture  
of what their ancestors were three hundred years a-  
go. It is in North America we are to seek their o-  
uiginal character; and I am safe in affirming that the  
proofs of genius given by the Indians of North A-  
merica, place them on a level with whites in the  
same uncultivated state. ‘The North of Europe fur-  
nishes subjects enough for comparison with them  
and for proof of their equality. Ihave seen some  
thousands of them myself, and conversed much  
with them, and have found in thema masculine,  
sound understanding. I have had much informa-  
tion from men who have lived among them, and  
whose veracity and good sense were so far known  
to me as to establish a reliance on their information.  
They have also agreed in bearing witnéss in favor  
of the genius of this people. As to their bodily  
strength, their manners rendering ii disgraceful to  
labor, those muscles employed in labor will be  
weaker in them than with the European laborer ;  
but those which are exerted in the chase, and those  
faculties which are employed in the tracing an ene-

I have supposed the black man in his present  
state might not be so ; but it would be hazardous to  
affirm that equally cultivated for a few genera-  
tions, he would not become so.’  
  
We believe that those who have observed and in-  
vestigated most closely, admit that man, under like  
advantages and disadvantages, is equal, in all na-  
tions and climes ; but it does appear to be a law of  
creation, that the admixture of different races of the  
same genus produce a superior individual. The

‘Tam not afraid that you should make any  
extracts you please for the Journal de Physique  
which come within their plan of publication.  
The strictures on slavery and on the constitu-  
tion of Virginia are not of that kind, and they  
are the parts which I donot wish to have made  
public, at least till I know whether their publi-  
cation would do most harm or good. It is  
possible that in my own country these stric-  
tures might produce an irritation which indis-  
pose the people toward the two great objects  
I have in view, that is the emancipation of  
their slaves &amp; the settlement of their constitu-  
tion on a firmer &amp; more permanent basis.”
