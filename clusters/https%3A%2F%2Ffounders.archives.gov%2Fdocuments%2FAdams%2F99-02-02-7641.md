ar Sir.  
Montezillo June 11th 1822.  
  
Half an hour ago I received, and this moment have heard read, for the 3d. or 4th. time, the best letter that ever was written by an Octogenarian, dated June the first. It is so excellent that I am under an almost invincible temptation to commit a breach of trust by lending it to a printer. My Son Thomas Boylston—says it would be worth $500—to any Newspaper in Boston—But I dare not betray your confidence.  
I have not strained my wrist, but both my hands &amp; arms are so overstrained that I cannot write a line.  
Poor Stark could remembered nothing and could talk of nothing but the battle of Bennington. Poor Thomson is not quite so reduced. I cannot mount my horse, but I can walk three miles over a rugged rocky Mountain, and have done it within a month, yet I feel when setting in my Chair as if I could not rise out of it, and when risen as if I could not walk across the room. My sight is very dim; hearing pretty good; memory poor enough.  
I answer your Question: Is death an evil? It is not an evil: it is a blessing, to the individual, and to the World—Yet we ought not to wish for it, till life becomes insupportable. We must wait the pleasure and convenience of the Great Teacher. Winter is as terrible to me as to you. I am almost reduced in it to the life of a Bear or a Torpid Swallow. I cannot read, but my delight is to hear (reading) others read, and I tax all my friends most unmercifully and Tyrannically against their consent.  
“The Ass” has kicked in vain—All men say the dull animal has missed the mark.  
This Globe is a Theatre of War. Its Inhabitants are all Heroes. The little Ells in vinegar, and the annimalculi in pepper water, I believe are quarrelsome. The Bees are as warlike as the Romans, Russians, Britains or Frenchmen. Ants Catterpillars and Cankerworms, are the only tribes among whom I have not seen Battles; and Heaven itself, if we believe Hindoo’s, Jews, Christians &amp; Mahometans has not always been at peace.  
We need not trouble ourselves about these things, nor fret Ourselves because of Evil-doers; but “safely trust the Ruler with his Skies.” Nor need we dread the approach of dotage. Let it come if it must!!!  
Thompson it seems, still delights in his four stories; and Stark remembered to the last his Bennington, and exalted in his Glory; the worst of the evil is that our friends will suffer more by our imbecility than we ourselves.  
Diplomatick flickerings it seems have not yet ceased. It seems as if a Council of Ambassadors could never agree. In wishing for your health and happiness I am very Selfish, for I hope for more letters. This is worth more than Five-hundred Dollars to me, and will continue to give me more than a Thousand.—Mr Jay who is about your age, I am told, experiences more decay than you do.  
I am your old Friend.

Winter is as terrible to me as to you. I  
am almost reduced in it to the life of a

This globe is a theatre of war; its inha-  
bifants are all heroes. The little eels in

water, [ believe are quarrelsome. The  
bees are as warlike as the Romans, Rus-  
sians, Britons, or Frenchmen. Ants, cat-  
terpillars, and cankerworms are the only  
iribes among whom I have not seen bat-  
tles; and heaven itself, if we believe Hin-

has not always been at peace. We need  
not trouble ourselves about these things,  
nor fret ourselves because of evil doers;  
but —_ trust the * Ruler with his skies.’

let it come, if it must. ®*** it seems, still  
delights in his four stories; and Stark re-

MR. ADAMS’ REPLY.  
Montezillo, June 11, 1822.  
DEAR Srr—Half an hour ago I received,  
and this moment have read for the third or  
fourth time, the best letter that ever was  
written by an Octogenarian, dated June 1st.  
* * * * * ~*~  
I have not sprained my wrist; but both  
my arms and hands are so overstrained that  
1 cannot write a line—Poor Starke remem-  
vered nothing and could talk of nothing but  
the battle of Bennington. ***** is not quite  
so reduced.—I cannot mount my horse, but  
I can walk three miles overa rugged rocky  
mountain, and have done it within a month ;  
yet I feel when sitting in my chair as if I  
could not-rise out of it; and when risen, as  
if I could not walk across the room: my  
sight is very dim, hearing pretty good, me-  
mory pocr enough.  
I answer your question—is death an evil ?  
—Iit is notanevil. It is a blessing tothe in-  
dividual, and-to the world; yet we ought  
not to wish for it till life becomes insupport-  
able. We must wait the pleasure and con-  
venience of the “‘ Great Teacher.” Winter  
is as terrible tome as to you. Iam almost  
reducec: in it to the life of a bear or atorpid  
swallow. I cannot read, but my delight is  
to hear others read; and 1 tax ali my  
friends most unmercifully and tyrannically  
azainst their consent.  
The ass has kicked in vain ; all men say  
the dull animal has missed the mark.

DaAa StBr-^Half an hour ago I received, and this moment have heard  
read, for the third or fourth time, the beat letter that aver was wriiiea  
by aa Octogenariati, dated June 1st.  
  
I have not sprained my wrist; but both my arms and hands are so over¬  
strained, that I canaot write a line.—Poor Starke remerobereci nothing,

feel when sitting in my chair at if 1 could not rise out of it ( and when  
risen, as if 1 could n6i walk across the room; my sight b very dini, heoV-  
ing pretty good, memory poor enough.  
  
1 answer your qnestion—it death an evil ? It la not an evil. It Is a  
blessing to the individual, and to the world; yet we ought not to wish  
for it till life becomes insupportable. We mutt wait .the pleasure and

I cannot read, but my delight la lt&gt; hear others read ; and iiax ail my

Thit globe b a theatre of war; Its Inhabitanb are all heroes. Tliw  
little eels in vinegar and the animalcules In penper-water, 1 believe, ara  
quarrelsome. The beea are as warlike aa the Romi^ns, Russians, Britons,

MR. ADAMS&#x27; REPLY.  
Montezillo, June 11, 1822.  
&quot;Dear Sir. Half an hour ago I received, and  
this moment have heard read for tho third or  
fourth time, the best letter that ever was written  
by an Octogenarian, dated June 1st.  
&quot;I have notwprained my wrist; but both my  
arms and bands are so overstrained that I can­  
not write aluie. Poor Stark remembered noth­  
ing and&#x27;eoow talk of nothing but the battle of  
Bennington I is not quite so reduced. I  
cannot mount my hourse, but I can walk three  
miles ov$r a rugged, rocky mountain, and have  
done ij-itlfrii a month; yet I feel when sitting  
in mycnair, as if I could not rise out of it ; and  
when risen, as if I could not walk across the  
room: ray sight is very dim, hearing pretty good,  
memory poor enough.  
&quot;I answer your question is death an evil? It  
is not an evil. It is a blessing to the individual,  
and to the world; yet we ought not to wish for  
it till life becomes insupportable. We must  
wait the pleasure and conveniance of the &#x27;Great  
Teacher.&#x27; Winter is as terrible to me as to you.  
I am almost reduced in it to the life of a bear or  
a torpid swallow. I cannot read, but my delight  
is to hear others read; and I tax all my friends  
most unmercifully and tyrannically against their  
consent.  
&quot;The ass has kicked in vain; all men. say the  
dull animal has missed the mark.  
&quot;This globe is a theatre of war : its inhabi­  
tants are all heroes. The little eels in Vinegar  
and the animalcules in pepper water, I believe,  
are quarrelsome. The bees are as warlike as  
the Romans, Russians, Britains, or Frenchmen.  
Ants, catterpillars, and cankerworms are the  
only tribes among whom I hsve not seen bat

MR. ADAMS&#x27; RePLy.  
MoNTEzILLO, June 11, 1822.  
&quot;Dear sir:-Half an hour ago I received, and  
this moment have heard read for the third or  
fourth time, the best letter that ever was writ­  
ten by an Octogenarian, dated June 1st.  
&quot;I have not sprained my wrist; but both my  
arms and hands are so overstrained that I can­  
not write a line. Poor Stark remembered  
nothing and could talk of pothing but the bat  
tle of Bennington. &quot; is not quite so reduc­  
ed. I cannot mount my horse, but I can  
walk three miles over a rugged, rocky moun  
tain, and have done it within a month; yet I  
feel when sitting in my chair, as if! could not  
rise out of it; and when risen, as if I could not  
walk across the room, my sight is very dim­  
hearing pretty good, memory poor enough.  
&quot;I answer your question,--is death an evil.  
It is not an evil. It is a blessing to the indi­  
cidual, and to the world; yet we ought not to  
wish for it, till life becomes insupportable.  
We must wait the pleasure and convenience of  
the &quot;Great Teacher.&quot; Winter is as terrible to  
me as to you. I am almost reduced in it to the  
life of a bear or a torpid swallow. I cannot  
read, but my delight is to hear others read; and  
I tax all my friends most unmercifully and ty­  
ranically against their consent.  
  
&quot;The ass has kicked in vain; all men say the  
dull animalhas missed the mark.  
&quot;This globe is a theatre of war; its inhabi­  
tants are all heroes. The little eels in vinegar  
and the animalcules in peper water, I believe  
are quarrelsome. The bees are as warlike as  
the Romans, Russians, Britons, or Frenchmen.  
Ants, caterpillars and cankerworms, are the  
only tribes among whom I have not seen bat­  
tles, and Heaven itself, if we believe Hindoos  
Jews, Christians, and Mahometans has not al­  
ways been at peace. We need not trouble

ought not to wish for it until life becomes in­  
supportable. We must wait the pleasure

friends most unmercifully and tyrannically  
against their consent.
