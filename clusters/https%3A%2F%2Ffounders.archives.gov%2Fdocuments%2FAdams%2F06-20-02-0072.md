tter of the 20th Inst. I had in mine of the Same date communicated to you my Ideas on that part of the constitution, limiting the Presidents power of negativing the acts of the legislature.— And just hinted some thoughts on the propriety, of the provision made for the appointment to offices, which I esteem to be a power nearly as important as legislation.  
If that was vested in the President alone, he might were it not for his periodical election by the people—render himself despotic.— It was a Saying of one of the Kings of England. That while the King could appoint the Bishops and judges he might have what Religion and Law he pleased.  
It appears to me the Senate is the most important branch in the government, for aiding &amp; Supporting the Executive, Securing the rights of the individual States, the government of the united States, and the liberties of the people, The Executive Magistrate is to execute the laws, the Senate being a branch of the legislature will  
  
naturally incline to have them duly executed, and therefore will advise to Such appointments as will best attain that end.— from the knowledge of the people in the Several States, they can give the best information who are qualified for offices, and though they will as you justly observe in Some degree lessen his responsibility, yet

ment is this: the Federal Government is the crea-  
ture of the States. They, being sovereign, made  
it. Within the sphere of its delegated powers they  
agreed that it should be supreme. They thereby  
did not relinquish their own sovereignty, but re-  
tained it fully and absolutely within the sphere  
of their reserved or non-delegated authority. But  
that I may not be deemed heretical, I will adopt  
the language of Roger Sherman:  
  
‘The Government of the United States being federal,  
and instituted bya number of sovereign States, they may be  
considered as so many pillars to support it.”  
  
I also adopt the language of the men who as-  
sisted in making the Federal Constitution, in their  
jointofficial report to Governor Huntington. They  
say:  
  
‘Those powers (those granted to Congress) extend only  
to matters respecting the common interests of the Union,  
  
and are speciaily defined, so that the particular States retain  
their sovereignty in all other matters.”

are innumerable. Let the defamers of their living
