14 Oct. 1774  
  
  
Whereas, since the close of the last war, the British parliament claiming a power of right to bind the people of America by statutes in all cases whatsoever, hath in some acts expressly imposed taxes on them, and in others, under various pretences, but in fact for the purpose of raising a revenue, hath imposed rates and duties payable in these colonies, established a board of commissioners with unconstitutional powers, and extended the jurisdiction of courts of Admiralty, not only for collecting the said duties, but for the trial of causes merely arising within the body of a county.  
And whereas, in consequence of other statutes, judges, who before held only estates at will in their offices, have been made dependent on the Crown alone for their salaries, and standing armies kept in times of peace: And it has lately been resolved in Parliament, that by force of a statute, made in the thirty-fifth year of the reign of king Henry the eighth, colonists may be transported to England, and tried there upon accusations for treasons, and misprisions, or concealments of treasons committed in the colonies; and by a late statute, such trials have been directed in cases therein mentioned.  
And whereas, in the last session of parliament, three statutes were made; “one, intitled “An act to discontinue, in such manner and for such time as are therein mentioned, the landing and discharging, lading, or shipping of goods, wares and merchandise, at the town, and within the harbour of Boston, in the province of Massachusetts-Bay, in North-America;” another, intitled “An act for the better regulating the government of the province of Massachusetts-bay in New England;” and another, intitled “An act for the impartial administration of justice, in the cases of persons questioned for any act done by them in the execution of the law, or for the suppression of riots and tumults, in the province of the Massachusetts-bay in New-England.” And another statute was then made, “for making more effectual provision for the government of the province of Quebec, &amp;c.” All which statutes are impolitic, unjust, and cruel, as well as unconstitutional, and most dangerous and destructive of American rights.  
And whereas, Assemblies have been frequently dissolved, contrary to the rights of the people, when they attempted to deliberate on grievances; and their dutiful, humble, loyal, and reasonable peti­tions to the crown for redress, have been repeatedly treated with contempt, by his majesty’s ministers of state:  
The good people of the several Colonies of New-hampshire, Massachusetts-bay, Rhode-island and Providence plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Newcastle, Kent and Sussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, justly alarmed at these arbitrary proceedings of parliament and administration, have severally elected, constituted, and appointed deputies to meet and sit in general congress, in the city of Philadelphia, in order to obtain such establishment, as that their religion, laws, and liberties may not be subverted:  
Whereupon the deputies so appointed being now assembled, in a full and free representation of these Colonies, taking into their most serious consideration, the best means of attaining the ends aforesaid, do in the first place, as Englishmen, their ancestors in like cases have usually done, for asserting and vindicating their rights and liberties, declare,  
That the inhabitants of the English Colonies in North America, by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English constitution, and the several charters or compacts, have the following Rights:  
Resolved, N.C.D. 1. That they are entitled to life, liberty, and property, and they have never ceded to any sovereign power whatever, a right to dispose of either without their consent.  
Resolved, N.C.D. 2. That our ancestors, who first settled these colonies, were, at the time of their emigration from the mother country, entitled to all the rights, liberties, and immunities of free and natural-born subjects, within the realm of England.  
Resolved, N.C.D. 3. That by such emigration they by no means forfeited, surrendered, or lost any of those rights, but that they were, and their descendants now are, entitled to the exercise and enjoyment of all such of them, as their local and other circumstances enable them to exercise and enjoy.  
Resolved, 4. That the foundation of English liberty, and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their legislative council: and as the English colonists are not represented, and from their local and other circumstances, cannot be properly represented in the British parliament, they are entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their several provincial legislatures, where their right of representation can alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity, subject only to the negative of their sovereign, in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed. But, from the necessity of the case, and a regard to the mutual interest of both countries, we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British parliament, as are bona fide, restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members; excluding every idea of taxation, internal or external, for raising a revenue on the subjects in America, without their consent.  
Resolved, N.C.D. 5. That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of that law.  
Resolved, 6. That they are entitled to the benefit of such of the English statutes as existed at the time of their colonization; and which they have, by experience, respectively found to be applicable to their several local and other circumstances.  
Resolved, N.C.D. 7. That these, his majesty’s colonies, are likewise entitled to all the immunities and privileges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters, or secured by their several codes of provincial laws.  
Resolved, N.C.D. 8. That they have a right peaceably to assemble, consider of their grievances, and petition the King; and that all prosecutions, prohibitory proclamations, and commitments for the same, are illegal.  
Resolved, N.C.D. 9. That the keeping a Standing army in these colonies, in times of peace, without the consent of the legislature of that colony, in which such army is kept, is against law.  
Resolved, N.C.D. 10. It is indispensably necessary to good government, and rendered essential by the English constitution, that the constituent branches of the legislature be independent of each other; that, therefore, the exercise of legislative power in several colonies, by a Council appointed, during pleasure, by the crown, is unconstitutional, dangerous, and destructive to the freedom of American legislation.  
All and each of which the aforesaid deputies, in behalf of themselves and their constituents, do claim, demand, and insist on, as their indubitable rights and liberties; which cannot be legally taken from them, altered or abridged by any power whatever, without their own consent, by their representatives in their several provincial legislatures.  
  
In the course of our inquiry, we find many infringements and violations of the foregoing rights, which, from an ardent desire, that harmony and mutual intercourse of affection and interest may be restored, we pass over for the present, and proceed to state such acts and measures as have been adopted since the last war, which demonstrate a system formed to enslave America.  
Resolved, N.C.D. That the following acts of Parliament are infringements and violations of the rights of the colonists; and that the repeal of them is essentially necessary in order to restore harmony between Great-Britain and the American colonies, viz:  
The several acts of 4 Geo. 3. ch. 15, and ch. 34.—5 Geo. 3. ch. 25.— 6 Geo. 3. ch. 52.—7 Geo. 3. ch. 41, and ch. 46.—8 Geo. 3. ch. 22, which impose duties for the purpose of raising a revenue in America, extend the power of the admiralty courts beyond their ancient limits, deprive the American subject of trial by jury, authorize the judges’ certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages, that he might otherwise be liable to, requiring oppressive security from a claimant of ships and goods seized, before he shall be allowed to defend his property, and are subversive of American rights.  
Also the 12 Geo. 3. ch. 24, entituled “An act for the better securing his Majesty’s dock-yards, magazines, ships, ammunition and stores,” which declares a new offence in America, and deprives the American subject of a constitutional trial by jury of the vicinage, by authorizing the trial of any person, charged with the committing any offence described in the said act, out of the realm, to be indicted and tried for the same in any shire or county within the realm.  
Also the three acts passed in the last session of parliament, for stopping the port and blocking up the harbour of Boston, for altering the charter and government of the Massachusetts-bay, and that which is entituled “An act for the better administration of Justice,” &amp;c.  
Also the act passed in the same session for establishing the Roman Catholick Religion in the province of Quebec, abolishing the equitable system of English laws, and erecting a tyranny there, to the great danger, from so total a dissimilarity of Religion, law, and government of the neighbouring British colonies, by the assistance of whose blood and treasure the said country was conquered from France.  
Also the act passed in the same session for the better providing suitable quarters for officers and soldiers in his Majesty’s service in North-America.  
Also, that the keeping a standing army in several of these colonies, in time of peace, without the consent of the legislature of that colony in which such army is kept, is against law.  
To these grievous acts and measures, Americans cannot submit, but in hopes their fellow subjects in Great-Britain will, on a revision of them, restore us to that state in which both countries found happiness and prosperity, we have for the present only resolved to pursue the following peaceable measures:  
  
Resolved, unanimously, That from and after the first day of December next, there be no importation into British America, from Great Britain or Ireland of any goods, wares or merchandize whatsoever, or from any other place of any such goods, wares or merchandize.  
  
1st. To enter into a non-importation, non consumption, and non-exportation agreement or association.  
2. To prepare an address to the people of Great-Britain, and a memorial to the inhabitants of British America, and  
3. To prepare a loyal address to his Majesty; agreeable to Resolutions already entered into.

HEREAS, fince the cloſe of the laſt war,  
  
W the Britiſh parliament claiming a power, of  
  
right to bind the people of America, by  
ſtatute in all caſes whatſoever, hath in ſome acts ex-  
prefily impoſed taxes on them, and in others under va-  
rious pretencss, but in fact for the purpoſe cl raiſing. a  
revaaue, hath impoſed rates and duties payable in  
theſe colonies, eſtabliſhed a board of commiſſioners  
with unconſtitutional powers, and extended the juriſ-  
dition of courts of admiralty, not only for colle&amp;ing  
the ſaid duties but for the trial of cauſes merely ariſing  
within the body of a county.  
  
And whereas in conſequence of other ſtatutes, judges,  
who before held only eſtates at will in their offices,  
have been made dependant on the crown alone for  
their ſalaries, and ſtanding armies kept in time of peace.  
And it has lately been reſolved in parliament, that by  
  
. force of a ſtatute. made in the thirty fifth year of the  
reign of King Henry the eighth, coloniſts may be  
tranſported to England and tried there upon accuſati-  
ons for treaſons and miſpriſions, or concealments of  
treaſons committed in the colonies ; and by a late ſta-  
tute, ſuch trials have been directed in caſes: therein  
mentioned,  
  
And whereas in the laſt ſeſſion of parliament, three  
ſtatutes were made : one entitled, An act to diſcon-  
« tinue in ſuch manner, add for ſnch time as are

another entitled, «+ An act for the impartial adminiſ-

ſtatutes are impolitic, unjuſt, and cruel, as well as un-  
conſtitutional, and moſt dangerous and deſtructive  
of American rights.  
  
And whereas, aſſemblies have been frequently diſ-  
ſolved, contrary to the rights of the people, when they  
attempted to deliberate on grievances ; and their du-  
tiful, humble, loyal and reaſonable petitions to the  
crown for redreſs, have been repeatedly treated with  
contempt by his Majeſty&#x27;s miniſters of ſtate.

ceedings of parliament and adminiſtration, have ſeve-  
rally elected, conſtituted, and appointed deputies to  
  
  
delphia, in order to obtain ſuch eſtabliſhment, as that  
their region, laws, and liberties may not be ſubverted :  
Whereupon the deputies fo appointed being now aſ-  
fembled, ia a full and free repreſentation of theſe colo-  
nies, taking into their. moſt ſerious conſideration the  
beſt means of attaining the ends aforeſaid, do in the  
firſt place, as Engliſhmen their anceſters in like caſes  
have uſually done, tor aſſerting and vindicating their  
rights and liberties, DECLARE, G  
That the inhabitants of the Engliſh colonies, in  
  
  
principles  
  
r  
  
7  
  
principles of the Engliſh conſtitution, and the ſeveral  
charters or compacts, have the following RIGHTS. —  
: Reſolved, N. G D. 1. That they are entitled to  
life, liberty, and property : and they have never ceded  
to any ſovereign power whatever, a right to diſpoſe of  
either without their conſent.  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 2. That our anceſtors, who  
firſt ſettled theſe colonies, were at the time of their  
emigration from the mother country, entitled to all the  
rights, liberties, and immunities of tree and natural  
born ſubjects, within the realm of England,  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 3. That by ſuch emigration -  
they by no means forfeited, ſurrendered, or loſt any of  
thoſe rights, but that they were, and their deſcendants  
now are, entitled to the exerciſe and enjoyment of all  
ſuch of them, as their local and other circumſtances  
enable them to exerciſe and enjoy.  
  
Reſolved, 4. That the foundation of Engliſh liberty  
and of all free government, is a right in the people to  
participate in their legiſlative council : and as the Eng-  
liſh coloniſts are not repreſented, and from their local  
and other circumſtances cannot properly be repreſented  
in the Britiſh parliament, they are entitled to a free  
and excluſive power of legiſlation ia their ſeveral pro-  
vincial Legiſlatures, where their right of repreſentatien  
can alone be preſerved, in all caſes of taxation and in-  
ternal polity, ſubject only to the negative of their ſove-  
reiga, in ſuch manner as has been heretofore uſed ard  
accuſtomed : But from the neceſlity of the caſe, and a  
regard to the mutual intereſts of both countries, we  
cheerfully conſent to the operation of ſuch acts of the  
. Britiſh parliament, as are bona fide, refirained, to the  
regulation of our external commerce, for the purpoſe of  
ſecuring the commercial advantages of the whole empire  
ro the mother country, and the commercial benefits of  
its reſpective members, excluding every idea of taxation  
internal or external, for raiſing a revenue on the ſubjects  
in America without their conſent. - 1  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 5. That the reſpective colo-  
nies are entitled to the common law of England, 4  
more eſpecially to the great and ineſtimable priviledge  
of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according  
te the courle of that law, Reſolved,  
  
—  
  
Prey”  
  
Reſolved, 6. &#x27;That they are entitled to the benefit  
of ſuch of the Engliſh ſtatutes, as exiſted at the time of  
their colonization ; and which they have, by experi-  
ence, reſpectively found to be applicable to their ſeveral  
local and other circumſtances,  
  
Reſolved, MV. C. D. 7. That theſe, his Majeſty&#x27;s, -  
  
colonies are likewiſe entitled to a!l the immunities and  
  
  
charters, or ſecured by their ſeveral codes of provincial  
laws.  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 8. That they have a right  
peaceably to aſſemble, conſider of their grievances, and  
Petition the King; and that all proſecutions, prohibi-  
tory proclamations, and commitments for the ſame,  
are illegal.  
  
Re ſolved. N. C. D. 9. That the keeping a ſtand-  
ing army in theſe colonies, in times of peace, witheut  
the conſent of the legiſlature of that colony in which  
ſuch army is kept, is againſt law. Is  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 10. It is indiſpenſibly neceſ-  
ſary to good government, and rendered eſſential by che  
Engliſh conſtitution, that the conſtituent branches of  
the legiſlature be independant of each other ; that.  
therefore, the exerciſe of legiſlative power in ſeveral  
colonies, by a council appointed, during pleaſure, by  
the crown, is unconflitutional, dangerous, and defiruc-  
tive to the freedom of American legiſlation,  
  
All and each of which, the aforeſaid deputies in be-  
  
half of themſelves, and their conſtituents, do claim, de-  
mand, and inſiſt on, as their indiſputable rights and  
liberties; which cannot be legally taken from them,  
altered or abridged by any power whatever, without  
their own conſent, by their repreſentatives in their ſe-  
veral provincial legiſlatures. |  
  
In the courſe of our inquiry, we find many infringe-  
ments and violations of the foregoing rights; which,  
from an ardent deſire that harmony and mutual inter-  
courſe of. affection and intereſt” may be reſtored, we

and meaſures as have been adopted ſince the laſt war,  
which demonſtrate a ſyſlem formed to enflave Ame-

—  
  
11  
  
Re ſolded, N. C. D. That the following acts of  
parliament are infringements and violations of the  
rights of the coloniſts; and that the repeal of them  
is eſſentially neceſſary, in order to reſtore harmogy be-  
tween Great- Britain and the American colonies, viz.  
  
The ſeveral acts of 4 Geo. III. ch. 15. and ch. 34.  
— 6c Geo. III. ch. 25. —6 Geo, III. ch. 52.—7 Geo.

might otherwiſe be liable to, requiring oppreſſive ſe-  
curity from a claimant of ſhips and goods ſeized, be-  
tore he ſhall be allewed to defend his property, and  
are ſubverſive of American rights.

charged with the committing any offence deſcribed in  
the ſaid act out of the realm, to be indifted and tried  
for the ſame in any ſhice or county within the realm.

WHEREAS, ſince the cloſe of the laſt  
war, the Britiſh parliament clauning a pow-  
er, of right, to bind the people of America  
by ſtatutes, in all caſes whatſoever, hath in  
ſome acts expreſsly impoſed taxes on them,  
and in others, under various pretences, but in  
fact for the purpoſe of railing a revenue, hath  
impoſed rates and duties payable in theſe co-  
lonics, eſtabliſhed a board of commiſſioners  
with unconſtitutional powers, and extended  
the juriſdiction of courts of admiralty, not  
only for collecting the ſaid duties, but for the  
  
trial of cauſes merely ariſing within the body  
of a county. |  
  
Axp whereas, in conſequence of other ſta-  
tutes, judges; who before held only eſtates at  
will in their offices, have been made depen-  
dant on the crown alone for their ſalaries, and  
ſtanding armies kept, in times of peace: And  
whereas it has lately been reſolved in parliament,  
that by force of a ſtatute, made in the thirty-  
fifth year of the reign of King Henry the  
eighth, coloniſts may be tranſported to England  
and tried there upon accuſations for treaſons  
and miſpriſions, or concealments of treaſons  
committed in the colonies ; and by a late ſta-  
  
tute, ſuch trials have been directed in caſes  
thercia mentioned.  
  
AND whereas in the laſt ſeſſion of parlia-  
ment, three ſtatutes were made; one entitled,  
An act to diſcontinue in ſuch manner, and  
for ſuch time as are therein mentioned, the  
landing and diſcharging, lading or 187

** of goods, wares and merchandize, at the  
„ town, and within the harbour of Boſton,  
in the province of Maſlachuſetts-Bay, in  
“ North-America.“ Another entitled, * An  
„ act for the better regulating the govern-  
% ment of the province of the Maſſachuſetts-  
&amp; Bay, in New-England.” And another entit-  
led, An act for the impartial adminiſtration  
* of juſtice, in the caſes of perſons queſtioned  
&amp; for any act done by them in the execution  
&amp;« of the law, or for the ſuppreſſion of riots  
« and tumults, in the province of the Maſla-  
&amp; chuſetts-Bay, in New-England.” And an-  
other ſtatute was then made, “ for making  
more effectual proviſion for the government  
« of the province of Quebec, &amp;c.“ All which  
ſtatutes are impolitic, unjuſt, and cruel, as  
weli as uncouſtitutional, and moſt dangerous  
and deſtructive of American rights.  
  
Axp whereas, aſſemblies have been fre-  
quently diſlolved, contrary to the rights of  
the people, when they attempted to deliberate  
on grievances ; and their dutiful, humble,  
loyal and reaſonable petitions to the crown  
for redreſs, have been repeatedly treated with  
contempt by his Majeſty&#x27;s miniſters of ſtate.

trary proceedings of parliament and admini-  
ſtration, have ſeverally elected, conſtituted,  
and appointed deputies to meet and ſit in ge-  
neral congreſs in the city of Philadelphia, in  
order to obtain ſuch eſtabliſhment, as that  
their religion, laws, and liberties may not be  
ſubverted: Whereupon the deputies ſo ap-  
pointed being now aſſembled, in a full and  
free repreſentation of theſe colonies, taking  
into their moſt ſerious conſideration the beſt  
means of attaining the ends aforeſaid, do in  
the firſt place, as Engliſhmen their anceſtors in  
like caſes have uſually done, for aſſerting  
and vindicating their rights and liberties,  
DECLARE,  
  
Tnar the inhabitants of the Engliſh colo-  
nies in North-America, by the immutable  
laws of nature, the principles of the Engliſh  
conſtitution, and the ſeveral charters or com-  
pacts, have the following RIGHTS.  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 1. Tur they are en-  
titled to life, liberty, and property: and they  
have never ceded to any ſovereign power  
whatever, a right to diſpoſe of either without  
their conſent.  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 2. Thar our anceſtors,  
who firſt ſettled theſe colonies, were at the  
time of their emigration from the mother  
country, entitled to all the rights, liberties,  
and immunities of free and natural born ſub-  
jects, within the realm of England.  
  
| Reſolved,

| Reſolved, N. C. D. 3. Tur by ſuch emi- vb  
  
gration they by no means forfeited, ſurren- nt  
dered, or loſt any of thoſe rights, but that  
they were, and their deſcendants now are, cn- AI  
titled to the exerciſe and enjoyment af all w  
ſuch of them, as their local and other cir-  
cumſtances enable them to exerciſe and enjoy.  
  
Reſolved, 3. Tnar the foundation of Eng-  
liſn liberty and of all free government, is a 1.  
right in the people to participate in their le—  
giſlative council: and as the Engliſh coloniſts |  
are not repreſented, and from their local and 1  
other circumſtances cannot properly be re- |  
preſented in the Britiſh parliament, they are  
entitled to a free and excluſive power of le  
giſlation in their ſeveral provincial Legiſlature 8,  
where their right of repreſentation can alone  
be preter ved, in all cafes of taxation and inter-  
nal polity, ſubject only to the negative of their  
ſovereign, in inch manner as has bcen hereto-  
fore uſed and accuſtomed : But from the  
neceſſity of the caſe, and a regard to the  
mutual intereſts of both countries, we  
cheerfully conſent to the operation of ſuch  
acts of the Britiſh parliament, as are bona fide,  
reſtrained to the regulation of our external com-  
merce, for the purpoſe of ſecuring the com-  
mercial advantages of the whole empire to the  
mother country, and the commerclal benefits of  
its reſpective members, excluding every idea  
of taxation internal or external, for raiſing a re-  
  
venue on the ſubjects in America without their  
conſent,  
  
1 Reſelved,  
  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 5. Tnar the reſpective  
colonies are entitled to the common law of  
England, and more eſpecially to the great and  
ineſtimable privilege of being tried by their  
peers of the vicinage, according to the courſe of  
that law, |  
  
Reſolved, 6. Tnar they are entitled to the  
benefit of ſuch of the Engliſh ſtatutes, as ex-  
iſted at the time of their colonization ; and  
which they have, by experience, reſpectively  
found to be applicable to their ſeveral local and  
other circumſtances,  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 7. Tur theſe, his Ma-  
jeſty&#x27;s, colonies are likewiſe entitled to all the  
immunities and privileges granted and confirmed  
to them by royal charters, or ſecured by their  
ſeveral codes of provincial laws.  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 8. Tür they have a  
right peaceably to aſſemble, conſider of their  
grievances, and petition the King; and that  
all proſecutions, prohibitory proclamations, and  
commitments for the ſame, are illegal.  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 9. Tamar the keeping a  
ſtanding army in theſe colonies, in rimes of  
peace, without the conſent of the legiſlature of  
that colony in which ſuch army is kept, is  
againſt law, |  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. 10. Ir is indiſpenſibly  
neceſſary to good government, and rendered

conſtituent branches of the legiſlature be inde-  
pendent of each other; that, therefore, the ex-  
erciſe of legiſlative power in ſeveral colonies, by  
a council appointed, during pleaſure, by the  
crown, is unconſtitutional, dangerous, and de-  
ſtructive to the freedom of American legiſlation.  
  
ALL and each of which, the aforeſaid deputies  
in behalf of themſelves, and their conſtituents»  
do claim, demand, and inſiſt on, as their indu-  
bitable rights and liberties; which cannot be  
legally taken from them, altered or abridged by  
any power whatever, without their own con-  
ſent, by their repreſentatives in their ſeveral pro-  
vincial legiſlatures,  
  
In the courſe of our inquiry, we find many  
infringements and violations of the foregoing  
rights; which, from an ardent deſire that har-  
mony and mutual intercourſe of affection and  
intereſt may be reſtored, we paſs over for the  
prelent, and proceed to ftate ſuch acts and  
  
  
which demonſtrate a ſyſtem formed to enſlave  
America,  
  
Reſolved, N. C. D. Taar the following acts  
of parliament are infringements and violations  
of the rights of the coloniſts; and that the re-  
peal of them is eſſentially neceſſary, in order to  
reſtore harmony between Great-Britain and the  
American colonies, viz.

The ConcrEess came into the following  
Resolutions.  
WHE RE AS, since the close of the lafp wars  
#be British parliament claiming a powers  
of right to bind the pesple of America,  
by Ratute in all cases whaifoever, bath in fume  
ails exprefly imposed taxes on them and in others  
under various pretences, but in fall for the pur-  
Pose of raising arevenue, bath imposed rates and  
duties payable in tbefs colomies, eflablifbed a  
board of commissioners with unconifitutional  
powers, aud extended the jurifditiion of courts  
of Admiralty, not only for colleiing tbe said  
duties, but for the trial of caujes merely arising  
within tbe body of a county.  
And whereas in&#x27;confequence of other Ratutes,  
Judges, who before beld only estates at will in  
sbeir offices, bave been made dependant om the  
crown alone for their salaries &amp;5 flanding armies  
kept in time of peace. Aud it bas been lately  
resolved in parliament, Ikat by force of a Ratute,  
wmade in the ithirty fifth year of the reign of  
King Henry tbe eightb, co&#x27;onists may be Iranf­  
ported to England and tried tbere upon accu/a­  
tions for treasons &amp; mifprifions,or concealments  
of treasons committed in Ihe colonies 5 and by a  
late Statute, such trials bave been direlled in  
¢afes therein mentioned.  
- Andwhereas in Ihe last session of Parliament,  
three flatutes were made : oncentitled, ** An al  
“ 10 discontinue in such manner, and for [uch  
¢ s ime as are therein mentioned, the landin; &amp;  
¢ dilcharging Jading or bipping of goods, wares  
and merchandize, at the town, and within the  
barbour of BoSton, in the province of Malfa­  
&lt; chufetts Bay in North America,”” Anotber  
entitled, ““An al? for the better regulating the  
¢ government of the province of the Mala­  
chufetts Bay, in New England.”’ And a­  
¢ nob.r éntidied, An all for the impartial ad­  
“ miniStration of justice, in the cases of persons  
S queflioned for any afi done by them in the ex­  
® ccution of the law, or for the fuppreflion of  
&lt; yiots and tumults, in the province of the Maf­  
¢ (achufetts Bay, in New England”’ And a­  
nother flatute was then made, ““ For making  
¢ more effeliual provifish for the government  
“of Quebec, ¢, Al which fatutes are  
impolitic, unjust, and cruel, as well as uncons7i­  
turional, and moS? dangerous and deStruliive of  
American righls.  
&quot; Andwhereas, affomblies bave been frequently  
diffolyed, comtrary to the rights of the People,  
swhen they attempted to deliberate on grievan­  
ces 3 and their dutiful, bumble, loyal and rea­  
sonable petitions 4o the crown for redress, bave  
been repeatedly ireated witk contempt by bis  
Majesty’s minifiers of State.  
The good people of the several colonies of  
New- Hampthire, Massachusetts- Bay, Rhode-  
Hland and Pravidence plantations, Connetti­  
cut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,  
New-Castle Kent and Sussex on Delaware,  
Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, and  
South Carolina, jultly alarmed at these arbi­  
trary proceedings of Parliament and Admi#  
niftration, have severally ele@ed, conttituted  
and appointed deputies to meet and [it in ge­  
_meral eongre(s in the city of Philadelphia, iy  
erder tor ebtain such eftablithment, as that  
their religion, laws and liberties may net be  
subverted : Whereupon the deputies so ap­  
pointed being now allembled, in a full and  
  
free representation of these Coloniet, taking  
inte their most {erious consideration the best  
means of attaining the ends aforefaid, do in  
the firft place, as Englishmen, their ancestors  
in like cases have usually done, for asserting  
and vindicating their rights add liberties,  
DECLARE,  
That the inhabitants of Englith colonies  
in North- America, by the immutable Laws  
of nature, the principles of the Englith con­  
fticution,and the several charters or compacts,  
have the following RIGHT 8.~ &#x27;  
Resolved, N. C. D. 1. That they are en­  
titled to life, liberty, and property ¢ and they  
have never ceded to any sovereign power  
whatever, a right to dispose of eith¢r without  
their consent.  
Resolved, N. C. D. 2. That our Ances­  
tors, who firft fettled these colonies, were at  
the time of their emigration from the mother  
country, entitled to all the rights,liberties, &amp;  
immunities of free and natural born fubjeéts,  
within the realm of Englaad. 2  
Resolved, N.C.D. 3. That by such emigra­  
tion they by no means forfeited, surrendered,  
or loft any of those rights,but that they were,  
and their defcendents now are, entitled to the  
exercise and enjoyment of all such of them,  
as their local and other circumstances enable  
them to exercise and enjoy.  
Resolved, 4. That the Foundation of En­  
glith liberty and of all free government, is a  
right in the peopleto participate‘in their le­  
gislative council : asd as the Englith colo­  
nists are not represented, and from their local  
and other circumstances cannot properly be  
represented in the Britith Parliament, they  
are entitled to a free and exclusive power of  
legislation in their several provincial Legisla­  
tures, where their right of representation can  
alone be preserved, in all cn[gs of taxation &amp;  
internal polity, fubjeét only to the negative  
ot their sovereign, &quot;in such manner as has  
been Ecrctofore used and accustomed : But  
from the neceflity of the case, and a regard  
to the mutual.incerefts of both countries, we  
cheerfully consent to the operation of such  
alts of theßritifh parliament, as are bona fide,  
restrained to the regulation of our external  
commerce, for the purpose of securing the  
commercial advantages of the whole empire  
to the mother.Country,and the commercial  
benefits of its respective members, excluding  
every idea of taxation internal or external,for  
raising a revenue on the fubjeéts in America  
without their consent. sas :  
Resolved N.C. D. 5.. That the refpeétive  
colonies are entitled to the common law of  
Englaod, and more especially to the great  
and inestimable privilege of being tried by.  
their peers of the vicinage, according to the  
course of that law.  
Resolved, 6. That they are entitled to the  
benefit of such of theEnglifh flatutes, as exis­  
ted at the time of their colonization © and  
which they have, by experience, refpeétively  
found to be applicable to their several local  
and other circumstances,  
¢ Resolved, N.C. D. 9. That these, hisMa­  
jefty’s colonies are likewise entitled to all the  
immunities and privileges granted and con­  
firmed to theny by royal charters, or secured  
by their several codes of provincial laws.  
Resolved, N.C. D. 8. That they have z  
right peaceably to assemble, confider of their  
grievances, and petition the King ; and that  
all prosecutions, prohibitory proclamations,  
and commitments for the fame, are illegal.  
Resolved N.C.D. g, That the keeping a  
standing army in thele colonies, in time of  
prace, withaut the confentof the legislature  
of that colony in which such Army is kept,  
is again{t law. -  
  
Resolved, N. C. D, so. It is indifpenfibly  
neceflary to good government, and rendered  
efiential by the English conflitution, that the  
constituent branches of the legiflature’ be in­  
dependant of each other ; that, therefore,  
the exercise of legislative power in several  
Colonies, by a council appointed; during  
pleasure, by the crown, is unconflitutional,  
dangerous, and deftruétive to the freedom  
of American legislation.  
All and each of which, the aforefaid de­  
puties in behalf of themf{elves, and their con­  
stituents, do claim, demaad, and iofift on, as  
their indubitable rights and liberties ; which  
cannot be legally taken from them, altered  
or abridged by any power whatever, without  
their own consent, by their representatives  
in their several provincial legislatures,  
In the course of our inquiry, we find many  
infringements and violadions of the foreges  
ing rights ; which, from an ardent desire  
that harmiony and mutual intercourse of af-’  
fetion and interelt may be reltored, we pass  
over for the present, and proceed to state  
such 2€ts and measures as have been adopt- -  
ed since the last war, which demonstrate a  
system formed to enslave America.  
Resolved, N.C.D. That the following aéts  
of parliament are infringements and violas  
tions of the Rights of the colonists ¢ 8 that  
the repeal of them is essentially necessary, in  
order.to restore harmony between Greate  
Britain and the American colonies, viz.  
The several aéls of 4 Geo, 111 ch. 15. and  
ch. 34.—5 Geo. IIL, ch, 25.—6 Geo. liL  
ch. ¢2.—7. Geo. lIL. ch. 41, and ch. 46.—  
8 Geo. 111. ch. 22. which impose duties sot  
the purpose of raising a revenue inAmerica,  
extend thepowers of the admuralty courts bz­  
yond their ancient limits, deprive the Ameris  
can fubje&amp; of tryal by jury,authorife the judz­  
es certificate toindemnify the prosecutor fromr  
damages, that he might otherwise be liable  
togrequiring oppressive security from aclaim­  
ant o?ﬂlips and goads seized, before he shall  
be allowed to defend his property, and are_  
{ubverfive of American rightss -  
Also 12 George HI. chap. 24, &#x27;mtimled’,  
« An at for the better securing hisMajefty’s  
¢ dock yards, ma%az&#x27;ines, ships, ammuni«  
“ tion and stores.”” Which declares a new  
offence in- America, and deprives the Ame­  
rican fubje&amp; of a conflitutional tryal by jury  
of the vicinage, by authorifing the trial of  
any person charged with the committing any  
offence described in the said act out of the  
realm, to be indi€ed and tried for the fame  
in any shire or county within the realm,  
- Also the three alls passed in the last ses­  
sion of parltament, for stopping the port and  
blocking up the harbour of Boston, for als  
tering the charter and government of Massa­  
chusetts Bay, &amp; that which is intituled, “‘An  
a&amp;t for the better administration of justice,”  
Also the a&amp; passed in the fame feflion for  
establishing the Roman catholic religion in  
the province of Quebec, abolishing the e­  
quitable fyftenr&#x27;of English laws, and ereting  
a tyranny there, to the great danger, from  
so total a diffimularity of religion, law and  
government to the neighbouring Britith co­  
loniés, by the affittance of whose blood and  
treasure the said country was conquered fronr  
France. |  
Also the 2&amp; pafied in the fame session,  
far the better providing suitable quarters for  
officers add soldiers in his Majesty’s service  
in North America.  
Also that the keeping a standing army 1o  
several of these colonies, in time of peacey  
without the consent of the legislature of that  
colony in which such army iskept, is against  
Law.

The good people of the several Colonies of New-  
Hampshire, Massachusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island, and  
Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York,  
New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Newcastle, Kent, and  
Sussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-  
Carolina, and South-Carolina, alarmed at the arbi-  
trary proceedings of the British parliament and ad-  
ministration, having severally elected deputies to  
meet and sit in general congress in the city of Phi-  
ladelphia, and those deputies so chosen being assem-  
bled on the Sth day of September, after settling se-  
veral necessary preliminaries, proceeded to take into  
their most serious .consideration the best means of  
obtaining the redress of grievances. In the first place,  
they, as Englishmen, (and as their ancestors in like  
cases, have usually done, for asserting and vindicat-  
ing their rights and liberties,) pectare,  
  
That the inhabitants of the English Colonies in  
North America, by the immutable laws of nature,  
the principles of the English Constitution, and the  
several Charters or Compacts, have the following  
RIGHTS:  
  
Resolved, nem. con. 1. That they are entitled to  
life, liberty, and property; and have never ceded  
to any sovereign power whaterer, a right to dispose  
of either without their consent.  
  
Resolved, n. c. 2. That our ancestors were, at  
the time of their emigration from the mother coun-  
try, entitled to all the rights, liberties, and immu-  
nities, of free and natural born subjects within the  
realm of England  
  
Resolved, n. c. 3. That, by such emigration, they  
neither forfeited, surrendered, nor lost, any of those  
rights.  
  
Resolved, n. c. 4. That the foundation of English  
liberty, and of all free government, is a right in  
the people to participate in their Legislative Coun.  
cil; and as the English Colonists are not repre-  
sented, and from their local and other circumstan-  
ces, cannot properly be represented in the British  
parliament, they are entitled to a free and exclu-  
sive power of legislation, in their several Provincial  
Legislatures, where their right of representation  
can only be preserved, in all cases of taxation and  
internal polity, subject only to the negative of their  
Sovereign, in such manner as has been heretofore  
  
used and accustomed; but from the necessity of  
the case, and a regard to the mutual interests of  
  
both countries, we cheerfully consent to the opera-  
tion of such acts of the British parliament as  
  
are bona fide restrained to the regulation of our  
external commerce, for the purpose of securing the  
commercial advantages of the whole Empire tothe  
mother-country, and the commercial benefits of  
its respective members, excluding every idea of  
taxation, internal or external, for raising a reve-  
nue, on the subjects in America without their con-  
sent. |  
  
Resolved, n. c. 5. That the respective Colonies  
are intitled to the common law of England, and  
more especially, to the great and inestimable privi-  
lege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage,  
according to the course of that law.  
  
Resolved, 6. That they are entitled to the benefit  
  
of such of the English Statutes as existed at the  
time of their colonization, and which they have, by  
experience, respectively found to be applicable to  
their several local and other circumStances.  
Resolved, n. c. 7, That these his majesty’s Colo-  
nies, are likewise entitled to all the immunities and  
privileges, granted and confirmed to them by Royat  
Charter, or secured by their several codes of Pro-  
vincial laws.  
Resolved, n. c. 8. That they have a right peace-  
ably to assemble, consider of their grievances, anc  
petition the king: and that all prosecutions, prohi-  
bitory proclamations, and commitments for the  
same, are illegal.  
  
Resolved, x. c. 9. That the keeping a standing  
army in these Colonies, in time of peace, without  
the consent of the legislature of that colony in which  
such army is kept, is against law.  
  
Resolved, n. c. 10. It is indispensibly necessary to  
good government, and rendered essential by the  
English constitution, that the constituent branches  
of the legislature be independent of each-other;  
that therefore, the exercise of legislative power,  
in several Colonies, by a council appointed during  
pleasure bv the crown, is unconstitutional, danger-  
ous, and destructive to the freedom of the American  
legislation. |  
  
All and each of which, the aforesaid Deputies, in  
behalf of themselves and their constituents, do  
claim, demand, and insist on, as their indubitable  
rights and liberties, which cannot be legally takea  
from them, altered or abridged by any power what-  
ever, without their own consent, by their represen-  
tatives in their several provincial legislatures.  
  
Resolved, n.c. That the following acts of par-  
liament are infringements and violations of the  
rights of the Colonists: and that the repeal of them  
is essentially necessary, in order to restore harmony  
between Great-Britain and the American colonies,  
viz.  
  
The sevaral Acts of 4 Geo. III. ch. 15. and ch. 34.  
—S Geo. IIE. ch. 25.—6 Geo. Hl. ch. 52.—7 Geo.  
Il. ch. 41. and ch. 46.—8 Geo. Ill. ch 22. which  
impose duties for the purpose of raising a revenue  
in America, extend the powers of the admiralty  
courts beyond their ancient limits, deprive the  
American subject of trial by jury, authorise the  
judges’ certificate to indemnify the prosecutor  
from damages that he might other wise be liable to,  
requiring oppressive security from a claimant of  
ships and goods seized, before he shall be allowed  
to defend his property, and are subversive of Ame-  
rican rights.  
  
Also 12 Geo. III. ch. 24. entitled, “An act for  
the better securing his, majesty’s dock-yards, maga-  
zines, ships, ammunition, «nd stores;’”? which de-  
clares a new offence in America, and deprives A-

Tory ministry of  
Oeorge III claimed in 1776 for the British Con­  
gress, sovereign power over our ancestors, the  
inhabitants of the British territories. The  
Republican party of ISoG claims the same  
power for an American Congress over our breth­  
ren in the American territories.  
But let us search history further. After a  
multitude of contentions upon the respective  
rights of the mother country and the colonies,  
a Congress was called &quot;to state their rights.&quot;  
It assembled in Philadelphia. Aad on the  
14th of October, 1774, the members of this gen­  
eral Congress declared with unexampled una­  
nimity :  
1. &quot;That they are entitled to life, liberty and  
  
prosperity ; and they never ceded to any for­  
eign power whatever a right to dispose of either  
without their consent.&quot;  
2. &#x27;&#x27;That our ancestors,who first settled these  
colonies, were, at the time of their emigration  
from the mother couutry, entitled to all the  
rights, liberties, and immunities of free and  
natural born subjects, within the realm of Eng­  
land.&quot;3. &quot;That by such emigration, they have by  
no means forfeited, surrendered, or lost any of  
those rights, but that they were, and their de­  
scendants now are, entitled to the exercise and  
enjoyment of all such of them, as their local  
aud othercircumstai.ee, enabled them to exer­  
cise and enjoy.&quot; .  
4. That tho foundation of English liberty  
and of all free governments, is a right in the  
people to participate in their legislative council;  
and, as the English colonists are not represent­  
ed, aud from their local and other circumstan­  
ces, canuot properly be represented in the  
British Parliament, they are entitled to a free  
and exclusive iowerof legislation, in their sev­  
eral provincial legislatures, where their right  
of representation can alone be prescind in all  
cases of taxation and internal policy, subject  
only to the negative of their bovercign in ucb  
a manner as has been heretofore used and ac  
customed.&quot; I&#x27;tlkin&#x27;s U. S. Vol. 12H5.  
Now we adopt this declaration of rights by  
our ancestors, as our argmneLt in favcr of the  
Democratic policy in the question of territorial  
  
governments. Itisonr argument in favor of

effectually drawn off by the exaction of duties

The declaration of rights by the continental  
congress of 1774, after claiming for the colonies  
free and exclusive legislation in all cases of tax­  
ation and internal policy; indicates that on the  
subject of external taxation there had been  
great change and progress of opinion.  
“But from ths necessity of the case, and a re­  
gard to the mutual interests of both countries,  
we cheerfully consent to the operation of such  
acts of the British parliament as are bona fide  
restrained to the regulation of our external com­  
merce, for the purpose of securing the commer­  
cial advantages of the whole empire to the  
mother country, and the commercial benefits of  
its respective members; excluding every idea of  
taxation, internal or external, for raising a rev­  
enue on the subjects in America without their  
consent.” It is safe to say that this distinction  
would soon have been found unsatisfactory;  
that some of the most oppressive of the laws *ot  
trade could not be said to have distinctly for  
tlieir object the raising of revenue, but to se­  
cure to the English subjects on the other side  
of the water monopolies iu trade and manufac­

England, and more especially, to the great and inestimable privilege of  
being tried by their peers of the vicinity, according to the course of

6. “ That they are entitled, to the benefit of such of the English statutes,

grievances, and petition the king; and that all prosecutions, prohibitory  
proclamations and commitments for the same, are illegal.”  
  
9. “That the keeping a standing army in these colonies, in times of  
peace, without the consent of the legislature of that colony, in which such  
army is kept, is against law.”  
  
10. “It is indispensably necessary to good government, and rendered  
essential by the English constitution, that the constituent branches of the  
legislature, be independent of each other; that, therefore, the exercise of  
legislative power, in several colonies, by a council appointed during pleasure,  
by the crown, is unconstitutional, dangerous, and destructive to the freedom  
of American legislation.”’
