Mr. Madison. In order to judge of the form to be given to this institution, it will be proper to take a view of the ends to be served by it. These were first to protect the people agst. their rulers: secondly to protect the people agst. the transient impressions into which they themselves might be led. A people deliberating in a temperate moment, and with the experience of other nations before them, on the plan of Govt. most likely to secure their happiness, would first be aware, that those chargd. with the public happiness, might betray their trust. An obvious precaution agst. this danger wd. be to divide the trust between different bodies of men, who might watch &amp; check each other. In this they wd. be governed by the same prudence which has prevailed in organizing the subordinate departments of Govt., where all business liable to abuses is made to pass thro’ separate hands, the one being a check on the other. It wd. next occur to such a people, that they themselves were liable to temporary errors, thro’ want of information as to their true interest, and that men chosen for a short term, &amp; employed but a small portion of that in public affairs, might err from the same cause. This reflection wd. naturally suggest that the Govt. be so constituted, as that one of its branches might have an oppy. of acquiring a competent knowledge of the public interests. Another reflection equally becoming a people on such an occasion, wd. be that they themselves, as well as a numerous body of Representatives, were liable to err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence agst. this danger would be to select a portion of enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness might seasonably interpose agst. impetuous counsels. It ought finally to occur to a people deliberating on a Govt. for themselves, that as different interests necessarily result from the liberty meant to be secured, the major interest might under sudden impulses be tempted to commit injustice on the minority. In all civilized Countries the people fall into different classes havg. a real or supposed difference of interests. There will be creditors &amp; debtors, farmers, merchts. &amp; manufacturers. There will be particularly the distinction of rich &amp; poor. It was true as had been observd. (by Mr. Pinkney) we had not among us those hereditary distinctions, of rank which were a great source of the contests in the ancient Govts. as well as the modern States of Europe, nor those extremes of wealth or poverty which characterize the latter. We cannot however be regarded even at this time, as one homogeneous mass, in which every thing that affects a part will affect in the same manner the whole. In framing a system which we wish to last for ages, we shd. not lose sight of the changes which ages will produce. An increase of population will of necessity increase the proportion of those who will labour under all the hardships of life, &amp; secretly sigh for a more equal distribution of its blessings. These may in time outnumber those who are placed above the feelings of indigence. According to the equal laws of suffrage, the power will slide into the hands of the former. No agrarian attempts have yet been made in this Country, but symtoms, of a leveling spirit, as we have understood, have sufficiently appeared in a certain quarters to give notice of the future danger. How is this danger to be guarded agst. on republican principles? How is the danger in all cases of interested coalitions to oppress the minority to be guarded agst.? Among other means by the establishment of a body in the Govt. sufficiently respectable for its wisdom &amp; virtue, to aid on such emergences, the preponderance of justice by throwing its weight into that scale. Such being the objects of the second branch in the proposed Govt. he thought a considerable duration ought to be given to it. He did not conceive that the term of nine years could threaten any real danger; but in pursuing his particular ideas on the subject, he should require that the long term allowed to the 2d. branch should not commence till such a period of life, as would render a perpetual disqualification to be re-elected little inconvenient either in a public or private view. He observed that as it was more than probable we were now digesting a plan which in its operation wd. decide for ever the fate of Republican Govt. we ought not only to provide every guard to liberty that its preservation cd. require, but be equally careful to supply the defects which our own experience had particularly pointed out

How is the danger, in all cases of interested coalitions to oppress

preservation could require, but be equally careful to supply the

be served by it. These were,—/irst, to protect the people  
against their rulers; secondly, to protect the people against the  
transient passions into which they themselves might be led.  
A people deliberating in a temperate moment, and with the  
experience of other nations before them, on the plan of gov-  
ernment most likely to secure their happiness, would first be  
aware that those charged with the public happiness might  
  
.betray their trust. An obvious precaution against this danger  
  
would be, to divide the trust between different bodies of men,  
who might watch and check each other. In this, they would  
be governed by the same prudence which has prevailed in  
organizing the subordinate departments of government, where  
all business liable to abuses, is made to pass through separate  
hands, the one being a check upon the other. It would next

occur to such a people, that they themselves were liable to  
temporary errors, through want of information as to their trae  
interest ; and that men chosen for a short term, and employed  
but a short portion of that in public affairs, might err from the  
same cause. This reflection would naturally suggest, that the  
government be so constituted as that one of its branches might  
have an opportunity of acquiring a competent knowledge of  
the public interests. Another reflection, equally becoming a  
people on such an occasion, would be, that they themselves,  
as well as a numerous body of representatives, were liable to  
err, also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence  
against this danger would be, to select a portion of enlight-  
ened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness, might sea-  
sonably interpose against impetuous counsels. It ought, finally,  
to occur to such a people, deliberating on a government for  
themselves, that, as different interests necessarily result from  
the liberty meant to be secured, the major part might, under  
sudden impulses, be tempted to commit injustice on the minor-  
ity. . . . No agrarian attempts have yet been made in  
thi scountry; but symptoms of a leveling spirit, as we have  
understood, have sufficiently appeared in a certain quarter to  
give notice of the future danger. How is this danger to be  
guarded against on republican principles; how is the danger,  
in all cases of interested coalitions to oppress the minority to  
be guarded against? Among other means, by the establish-  
ment of a body in the government, sufficiently respectable for  
its wisdom and virtue to aid, on such emergencies, the prepon-  
derance of justice, by throwing its weight into that scale. Such  
being the objects of the second branch in the proposed gov-  
ernment, he thought a considerable duration ought to be given  
it. He did not conceive that the term of nine years, could  
threaten any real danger; but, in pursuing his particular ideas  
on the subject, he should require that the long term allowed  
to the second branch should not commence till such a period  
of life, as would render a perpetual disqualification to be  
re-elected, little inconvenient, either in a public or private  
view.” * “Various have been the propositions, but my opin
