.That it is requested of them to make known to the Students that it is with great regret that some breaches of order, committed by the unworthy few who lurk among them unknown, render necessary the extension to all, of processes afflicting to the feelings of those who are conscious of their own correctness, and who are above all participation in these vicious irregularities. while the offenders continue unknown the tarnish of their faults spreads itself over the worthy also, and confounds all in a common censure. but that it is in their power to relieve themselves from the imputations and painful proceedings to which they are thereby subjected, by lending their aid to the Faculty on all occasions, towards detecting the real guilty. the Visitors are aware that a prejudice prevails, too extensively among the young, that it is dishonorable to bear witness one against another. while this prevails, and under the form of a matter of conscience, they have been unwilling to authorise constraint, and have therefore, in their regulations on this subject, indulged the error, however unfounded in reason or morality. but this loose principle in the Ethics of schoolboy-combinations is unworthy of mature and regulated minds; and is accordingly condemned by the laws of their country, which, in offences within their cognisance, compel those who have knolege of a fact, to declare it for the purposes of justice, and of the general good and safety of society. and certainly, where wrong has been done, he who knows and conceals the doer of it, makes himself an Accomplice, and justly censurable as such. it becomes then but an act of justice to themselves, that the innocent and the worthy should throw off with disdain all communion of character with such offenders, should determine no longer to screen the irregular and the vicious under the respect of their cloak, and to notify them, even by a solemn association for the purpose, that they will cooperate with the Faculty in future, for the preservation of order, the vindication of their own character, and the reputation and usefulness of an Institution, which their country has so liberally established for their improvement, and to place within their reach those acquirements in knolege on which their future happiness and fortunes depend. let the good and the virtuous of the Alumni of the University do this, and the disorderly will then be singled out for observation, and deterred by punishment, or disabled by expulsion, from infecting, with their inconsideration, the Institution itself, and the sound mass which it is preparing for virtue and usefulness.The Faculty shall have power, from time to time, to prescribe regulations of police, not inconsistent with the laws of the land, or the enactments of this board, which regulations shall be submitted to the Visitors, at their next succeeding meeting, and shall be in force till disapproved by the Visitors, or repealed by the Faculty.The Board, considering that it will be for the benefit of the school of Medecine that it’s Professor should have opportunities of keeping in mind, to a certain degree, the practical part of his profession, and of acquiring moreover a knolege of the peculiarities of disease incident to our climate and country, are of opinion that, besides the habitual practice within the precincts of the University, allowed by a former resolution, he be permitted also to act as a consulting physician elsewhere; so timing these avocations however as not to interrupt the regular business of the school.The 4. and 55/100 acres of lands purchased of Daniel A.

* At a meeting nf the Visiters of the U­  
.Diversity of Virginia, held at the saic  
University from October -3 to Octobei  
7,1825, at which were presentTHOMA:  
Jefferson, Rector, James Madison  
Jamf.s Bkf.ckf.nridge,Joseph C. Ca­  
bell, Jno. H.Cockk,Chapman John­  
son, and George Loyall—  
as follows:  
. -- - - - producing „  
®ite trom such Seminary, or other sa­  
tisfactory evidence to the Faculty, wit!  
tespect to his general good conduct.  
72. Intoxication shall for the first of­  
fence, be liable to any of the minor pun­  
ishments, and any repetition of the of­  
fence to any of the major uunishments  
Tlie Faculty shall have the pow­  
er, for offensive conduct, of removing  
the occupant from any dormitory.  
74. Although nocturnal absencesfrom  
their chambers,occasionally happening  
are not entirely forbidden, yet, if fre­  
quent, or habitual, or without excusable  
cause, they should be also noted, and re  
ported, with their special delinquencies,  
to the parent or guardian.  
75. No student shall appearout of his  
.dormitory masked, or disguised in any  
manner whatever, which may render  
the recognition of his person more dif­  
ficult, on pain of suspension or expul­  
sion by the Faculty of Professors.  
76. If a student be irregular in all his  
classes, for more than a month after his  
parent or guardian has been informed,  
the Faculty shall have the discretiona­  
ry power to dismiss him from the Uni­  
versity.  
77. Thd Professors being charged  
with the execution of the laws of the  
University, it becomes their duty to  
pui-sue pi-oper means to discover and  
prevent offences. Respect from the  
student to the Professor being at all  
times due, it is more especially so when  
the Professor is engaged in h’is duty.—  
Such respect, therefore, is solemnly en­  
joined upon every student; and it is de­  
clared and enacted, that, if any student  
refuse his name to a Professor,&quot;or, being  
required by him to stop, shall fail to do  
so, or shall be guilty of any other disre­  
spect to a Pi-ofessor, he shall be liable

processes afflicting to the feelings of  
those who are conscious of their own  
correctness, and who are above all par­  
ticipation in their vicious irregularities,  
While the offenders continue unknown,  
the tarnish of their faults spreads itself  
over the worthy also, and confounds all  
In a common censure. But that it is in  
their power to relieve themselves from  
the imputations aadpainful proceedings  
to which&#x27;they are thereby subjected,by  
lending their aid to the faculty on all oc­  
casions, towards detecting the real guil­  
ty. The visiters are aware that a pre­  
judice prevails, too extensively among  
the young, that it is dishonorable to bear  
witness one against another. While  
this prevails, and under the form of a  
matter of conscience,they have been un­  
willing toauthorise constraint, and have  
therefore, in their regulations on this  
subject, indulged the error,however un­  
founded in reason or morality. But  
this loose principle in the ethics of  
school-boy-combinations, is unworthy  
Of mature and regulated minds; and is  
accordingly condemned by the laws of  
then- country, which, in offences, with­  
in the!-cognisance, compel those who  
have knowledge of a, fact, to declare it  
for tin- purposes of justice, and of the  
general t oi l and safety of society. And  
certainly where wrong has been done,  
lie who’knows and conceals the doer of  
it, makes himself an accomplice, and  
justly cedsimable as such. It becomes  
•then’ but an act of justice to themselves,  
that the innocent and the worthy should  
thi-ow off with disdain all communion of  
character with such offenders, should  
determine no longer to screen the irre­

of an Institution, which their country

terred by punishment, or disabled, by  
expulsion, from infecting, with tbeir in­  
consideration, the Institution itself, and

tain degree, the practical pai-ts of his

knowledge of the peculiarities of dis­  
ease incident to Our climate and coun­  
try, are f opinion that, besides the ha­  
bitual practice within the precincts of  
the University, allowed by a fanner re­  
solution, he he permitted &quot;also to act as  
a consulting physician elsewhere; so ti­  
ming these avocations, however, as not  
to interrupt the regular business of the  
school.  
83. On a renewal of the leases of the
