3. 4. In proceeding to the 3d and 4th duties prescribed by the legislature, of reporting ‘the branches of learning which should be taught in the University, and the number and description of the Professorships they will require’ the Commissioners were first to consider at what point it was understood that University education should commence? certainly not with the Alphabet, for reasons of expediency and impracticability, as well as from the obvious sense of the legislature, who, in the same act make other provision for the primary instruction of poor children expecting doubtless that, in  other cases, it would be provided by the parent, or become perhaps a subject of future and further attention for the legislature. the objects of this primary education determine it’s character and limits. these objects would be  
to give to every citizen the information he needs for the transaction of his own business:  
to enable him to calculate for himself, and to express and preserve his ideas his contracts and accounts in writing:  
to improve, by reading, his morals and faculties:  
to understand his duties to his neighbors and country, and to discharge with competence the functions confided to him by either:  
to know his rights; to exercise with order and justice those he retains; to choose with discretion the fiduciaries of those he delegates; and to notice their conduct with diligence, with candor and judgment:  
and, in general, to observe, with intelligence and faithfulness, all the social relations under which he shall be placed.  
To instruct the mass of our citizens in these their rights, interests &amp; duties as men and citizens, being then the objects of education in the primary schools, whether private  or public, in them should be taught reading, writing &amp; numerical arithmetic, the elements of mensuration (useful in so many callings) and the outlines of geography and history. and this brings us to the point at which are to commence the higher branches of education, of which the legislature requires the developement: those, for example, which are  
to form the statesmen, legislators &amp; judges, on whom public prosperity, &amp; individual happiness are so much to depend:  
to expound the principles and structure of government the laws which regulate the intercourse of nations, those formed municipally for our own government, and a sound spirit of legislation, which, banishing all arbitrary, and unnecessary restraint on individual action, shall leave us free to do whatever does not violate the equal rights of another:  
to harmonise and promote the interests of agriculture, manufactures and commerce, and by well-informed views of Political economy to give a free scope to the public industry:  
to develope the reasoning faculties of our youth, enlarge their minds, cultivate their morals, &amp; instill into them the precepts of virtue and order:  
to enlighten them with Mathematical and Physical sciences, which advance the arts &amp; administer to the health, the subsistence, and comforts of human life:  
  
and generally to form them to habits of reflection, and correct action, rendering them examples of virtue to others, and of happiness within themselves.  
These are the objects of that higher grade of education, the benefits &amp; blessings of of  which the legislature now propose to provide for the good and ornament of their country, the gratification and happiness of their fellow citizens, of the parent especially, and his progeny, on which all his affections are concentrated.  
In entering on this field the Commissioners are aware that they have to encounter much difference of opinion as to the extent which it is expedient that this institution should occupy. some good men, and even of respectable information, consider the learned sciences as useless acquirements: some think that they do not better the condition of Man; and others that education like private and individual concerns, should be left to private and individual effort; not reflecting that an establishment, embracing all the sciences which may be useful and even necessary in the various vocations of life, with the buildings &amp; apparatus belonging to each, are far beyond the reach of individual means, and must either derive existence from  public patronage, or not exist at all. this would leave us then without those callings which depend on education, or send us to other countries to seek the instruction they require. but the Commissioners are happy in considering the statute under which they are assembled as proof that the legislature is far from the abandonment of objects so interesting. they are sensible that the advantages of well directed education, moral, political and economical, are truly above all estimate.  education generates habits of  application, of order, and  the love of virtue, and corrects, by the force of habit, any innate obliquities in our moral organisation. we should be far too from the discoraging persuasion that man is fixed, by the law of his nature, at a given point; that his improvement is a chimaera, and the hope delusive of rendering ourselves wiser, happier, or better than our forefathers were. as well might it be urged that the wild and uncultivated tree, hitherto yielding sour and bitter fruit only, can never be made to yield better. altho  yet we know that  the grafting art,  implant implants a new tree on the savage stock, producing what is most estimable both in kind and degree. education, in like manner, engrafts a new man on the native stock, &amp; improves what in his nature was vicious and perverse into qualities of  virtue &amp; social value. and it cannot be but that each generation, succeeding to the knolege acquired by all those who preceded it, adding to it their own acquisitions and discoveries, and handing the mass down for successive and constant accumulation, must advance the knolege and well-being of mankind, not infinitely, as some have said, but indefinitely, and to a term which no one can fix, or foresee. indeed we need look back only half a century, to times which many now living remember well, and see the wonderful advances in the sciences and arts which have been made within that period. some of these have rendered the elements themselves subservient to the purposes of man, have harnessed them to the yoke of his labors, and effected the great blessings of moderating his own, of accomplishing what was beyond his feeble force, and of extending the comforts of life to a much enlarged circle, to those who had before known it’s necessaries only. that these are not the vain dreams of sanguine hope, we have before our eyes real &amp; living examples. what, but education, has advanced us beyond the condition of our indigenous neighbors? and what chains them to their present state of barbarism and wretchedness, but a bigotted veneration for the supposed superlative wisdom of their fathers, and the preposterous idea that they are to look backward for better things, and not forward, longing, as it should seem, to return to the days of eating acorns and roots, rather than indulge in the degeneracies of civilization. and how much more encouraging to the atchievements of science and improvement, is this, than the desponding view that the condition of man cannot be ameliorated, that what has been must ever be, and that, to secure ourselves where we are, we must tread with awful reverence in the footsteps of our fathers. this doctrine is the genuine fruit of the alliance between church and state, the tenants of which, finding themselves but too well in their present position, oppose all advances which might unmask their usurpations, and monopolies of honors, wealth and power, and fear every change, as endangering the comforts they now hold. nor must we omit to mention, among the benefits of education, the incalculable advantage of training up able Counsellors to administer the affairs of our country, in all it’s departments, Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary; and to bear their proper share in the councils of our National government; nothing, more than education, advancing the prosperity, the power, and the happiness of a nation.  
Encouraged therefore by the sentiments of the legislature, manifested in this statute, we present the following Tabular view statement of the branches of learning which we think should be taught in the University, forming them into groupes, each of which are within the powers of a single Professor.

: these institutions, intermediate between the primary schools and University, might then be the passage of entrance for youths into the University, where their Classical learning might be critically compleated, by a study of the authors of highest degree. and it is at this stage only that they should be recieved at the University. giving then a portion of their time to a finished knolege of the Latin and Greek, the rest might be appropriated to the modern languages, or to the commencement of the course of science  for which they should be destined. this would generally be about the 15th year of their age, when they might go with more safety and contentment to that distance from their parents. until this preparatory provision shall be made, either the

equisite for it’s attainment. a language already fraught with all the eminent science of our parent country, the future vehicle of whatever we may ourselves atchieve, and destined to occupy so much space on the globe, claims distinguished attention in American education.  
Medecine, where fully taught, is usually subdivided into several professorships. but this cannot well be without the Accessory of a an hospital, where the Student can have the benefit of attending Clinical lectures, &amp; of assisting at operations of Surgery. with this Accessory, the seat of our University is not yet prepared, either by it’s population, or by the numbers of poor who would leave their own houses, and accept of the charities of an hospital. for the present therefore we we propose but a single Professor for both Medicine and Anatomy. by him the elements of Medical science may be taught, with a history &amp; explanations of all it’s successive theories from Hippocrates to the present day: and Anatomy may be fully treated. vegetable pharmacy will make a part of the Botanical course, and  mineral and Chemical pharmacy of those of Mineralogy and Chemistry. this degree of Medical information is such as the mass of scientific students would wish to possess as enabling them, in their course thro’ life, to estimate with satisfaction the extent and limits of the aid to human life and health, which they may understandingly expect from that art; and it constitutes such a foundation for those intended for the profession, that the finishing course of practice at the bedsides of the sick, and at the operations of Surgery in a hospital, can neither be long nor expensive. to seek this finishing elsewhere, must therefore be submitted to for a while.  
In conformity with the principles of our constitution, which places all sects of Religion on an equal footing, with the jealousies of the different sects in guarding that equality from encroachment and surprise, and with the sentiments of the legislature in favor of freedom of religion manifested on former occasions, we have proposed no Professor of Divinity; and the rather as the proofs of the being of a god, the creator, preserver, and supreme ruler of the universe, the Author of all the relations of morality, and of the laws and obligations these infer, will be within the province of the Professor of Ethics; to which adding the developements of

s of the professors; and the introduction also of other branches of science, when enabled by private donations or by public provision, and called for by the increase of population, or other change of circumstances; to establish beginnings in short, to be developed by time, as those who come after us shall find expedient. they will be more advanced than we are in science and in useful arts, and will know best what will suit the circumstances of their day.  
We have proposed no formal provision for the Gymnastics of the school, altho’ a proper object of attention for every institution of youth. these  exercises with antient nations, constituted the principal part of the education of their youth. their arms and mode of warfare rendered them severe in the extreme. ours, on the same correct principle, should be adapted to our arms and warfare; and the Manual exercise, military maneuvres, and Tactics generally, should be the frequent exercises of the Students, in their hours of recreation. it is at that age of aptness, docility and emulation of the practices of manhood, that such things are soonest learnt, and longest remembered. the use of tools too in the manual arts is worthy of encoragement, by facilitating to such as choose it an admission into the neighboring workshops. to these should be added the arts which embellish life, dancing, music, and drawing; the last more especially, as an important part of military  education. these innocent arts furnish amusement and happiness to those who, having time on their hands, might less inoffensively employ it. needing, at the same time, no regular incorporation with the institution, they may be left to accessory teachers, who will be paid by the individuals employing them, the University only providing proper apartments for  their exercise.  
The 5th duty prescribed to the Commissioners is to propose such general provisions as may be properly enacted by the legislature, for the better organising and governing the University.

gs.   4. the best mode of government for youth in large collections, is certainly a desideratum not yet attained with us. it may well be questioned whether fear, after a certain age is the motive to which we should have ordinary recourse. the human character is susceptible of other incitements to correct conduct, more worthy of employ, and of better effect. pride of character, laudable ambition, and moral dispositions are innate correctives of the indiscretions of that lively age, and, when strengthened by habitual appeal and exercise, have a happier effect on future character than the degrading motive of fear. the affectionate deportment between father and son offers in truth the best example for that of tutor and pupil; and the experience and practice of  other countries in this respect, may be worthy of enquiry and consideration with us. it will be then for the wisdom and discretion of the Visitors to devise and perfect a proper system of government, which, if it be founded in reason and comity, will be more likely to nourish, in the minds of our youth, the combined spirit of order &amp; self-respect, so congenial with our political institutions, and so important to be woven into the American character.   5. what qualifications shall be required to entitle to entrance into the University, the arrangement of the days and hours of lecturing for the different schools, so as to facilitate to the students the circle of attendance on them; the establishment of periodical and public examinations, the premiums to be given for distinguished merit; whether honorary degrees shall be conferred, and by what appellations; whether the title to these shall depend on the time the candidate has been at the University, or, where Nature has given a greater share of understanding, attention &amp; application; whether he shall not be allowed the advantages resulting from these endowments, with other minor items of government, we are of opinion should be entrusted to the Visitors; and the Statute under which we act having provided for the appointment of these, we think they should moreover be charged with  
the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally:  
that they should have power to appoint a Burser, employ a Steward, and all other necessary agents:  
to appoint and remove Professors, two thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal:  
to prescribe their duties, &amp; the course of education, in conformity with the law:  
to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land:  
to regulate the tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories they occupy:  
to prescribe and controul the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants &amp; others with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances &amp; other property and interests of the University:  
to draw from the literary fund such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution: and in general  
to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient

sembled as proof, that the legislatuie is  
far from the abandonment ot objects so  
interesting. They are sensible that the  
advantages ot well directed education,  
moral, political ami economical, are truly  
above all estimate.— I.dotation gene­  
rates habits of application, of order, and  
I ie love of virtue; ami contiouls, by the  
force of habit, any innate obliquities in  
our moral organization. We should be  
far too from the discouraging persir.wion,  
that man is fixed, by the law of Ins na­  
ture, at a given point; tiiat his improve­  
ment is a chimera, and the hope delusive  
ot rendering ourselves w iser, happier, or  
bettor than our forefathers were. A- well  
might it he urged that the wild and un­  
cultivated tree, hitherto yielding sour  
and bitter fruit only, can never be made  
to yield better. Yet we know that the  
grafting art, implants a new tree outlie

3. 4. In proceeding to the third and fourth duties prescribed by  
the legislature of reporting ‘ the branches of learning, which should  
be taught in the university, and the number and description of the  
professorships they will require,’ the commissioners were first to  
consider at what point it was understood that university education  
should commence? Certainly not with the Alphabet, for reasons of  
expediency and impracticability, as well as from the obvious sense  
of the legislature, who, in the same act make other provision for  
the primary instruction of poor children, expecting doubtless that,  
in other cases, it would be provided by the parent, or become per-  
haps a subject of future, and further attention for the legislature.  
The objects of this primary education determine its character and  
limits.—These objects would be,  
  
To give to every citizen the information he needs for the trans-  
action of his own busimess.  
  
To enable him to calculate for himself, and to express and pre-  
serve his ideas, his contracts and accounts in writing.  
  
To improve by reading, his morals and faculties.  
  
To understand his duties to his neighbours, and country, and  
to discharge with competence the functions confided to him by  
either.  
  
To know his rights; to exercise with order and justice those he  
retains; to choose with discretion the fiduciaries of those he dele-  
gates; and to notice their conduct with diligence, with candour and  
judgment.  
  
And, in general, to observe with intelligence and faithfulness all  
the social relations under which he shall be placed.  
  
To instruct the mass of our citizens in these their rights, inter-  
ests and duties, as men and citizens, being then the objects of edu-  
cation in the primary schools, whether private or public, in them  
should be taught reading, writing and numerical arithmetic, the  
elements of mensuration (useful in so many callings,) and the out-  
lines of geography and history; and this brings us to the point at  
which are to commence the higher branches of education, of which  
the legislature require the development: those, for example, which  
are&#x27;to form the statesmen, legislators and judges, on whom public  
prosperity, and individual happiness are so much to depend:  
  
fo expound. the principles and structure of government, the  
laws which regulate the intercourse of nations, those formed mu-  
nicipally for our own government, and a sound spirit of legislation,

108 Proceedings and Report of the Commisszoners  
  
which banishing all arbitrary and unnecessary restraint on indivi-  
dual action shall leave us free to do whatever does not violate the  
equal rights of another:  
  
To harmonize and promote the interests of agriculture, manu-  
factures and commerce, and by well informed views of political  
economy to give a free scope to the public industry:  
  
To develop the reasoning faculties of our youth, enlarge their  
minds, cultivate their morals, and instil into them the precepts of  
virtue and order:  
  
To enlighten them with mathematical and physical sciences,  
which advance the arts and administer to the health, the subsist-  
ence and comforts of human life:  
  
And generally to form them to habits of reflection, and correct  
action, rendering them examples of virtue to others, and of happi-  
ness within themselves.  
  
These are the objects of that higher grade of education, the be-  
nefits and blessings of which the legislature now propose to provide  
for the good and ornament of their country, the gratification and  
happiness of their fellow citizens, of the parent especially and his  
progeny on which all his affections are concentrated.  
  
In entering on this field, the commissioners are aware that they  
have to encounter much difference of opinion as to the extent,  
which it is expedient that this institution should occupy. Some  
good men, and even of respectable information, consider the learn-  
ed sciences as useless acquirements; some think that they do not  
better the condition of man; and others, that education, like private  
and individual concerns, should be left to private and individual  
effort; not reflecting that an establishment, embracing all the scien-  
ces which may be useful and even necessary in the various voca-  
tions of life, with the buildings and apparatus belonging to each,  
are far beyond the reach of individual means, and must either de-  
rive existence from public patronage or not exist at all. This would  
leave us then without.those callings which depend on education,  
or send us to other countries, to seek the instruction they require.  
But the commissioners are happy in considering the statute under  
which they are assembled as proof, that the legislature is far from the  
abandonment of objects so interesting; they are sensible that the  
advantages of well directed education, moral, political and econo-  
mical, are truly above all estimate. Education generates habits  
of application, of order and the love of virtue; and controls, by  
the force of habit, any innate obliquities in our moral organization.  
We should be far too from the discouraging persuasion, that man  
is fixed, by the law of his nature, at a given point; that his im-  
provement is a chimera, and the hope delusive of rendering our-  
selves wiser, happier or better than our forefathers were.—As  
well might it be urged, that the wild and uncultivated tree, hith-  
erto yielding sour and bitter fruit only, can never be made to yield  
better: Yet we know that the grafting art implants a new tree on  
the savage stock, producing what is most estimable both in kind

verse, into qualities of virtue and social worth; and it cannot be,  
but that each generation, succeeding to the knowledge acquired by  
all those who preceded it, adding to it their own acquisitions and  
discoveries, and handing the mass down for successive and con-  
stant accumulation, must advance the knowledge and well-bein  
of mankind, not infinitely, as some have said, but indefinitely, au  
to a term which no one can fix or foresee. Indeed, we need look  
back only half a century, to times which many now living remem-  
ber well, and see the wonderful advances in the sciences and arts  
which have been made within that period. Some of these have  
rendered the elements themselves subservient to the purposes of  
man, have harnessed them to the yoke of his labours, and effected  
the great blessings of moderating his own, of accomplishing what  
was beyond his feeble force, and of extending the comforts of life  
to a much enlarged circle, to those who had before known its ne-  
cessaries only.—That these are not the vain dreams of sanguine  
hope, we have before our eyes real and living examples. What,  
but education, has advanced us beyond the condition of our indige-  
nous neighbours? and what chains them to their present state of  
barbarism and wretchedness, but a bigotted veneration for the sup-  
posed superlative wisdom of their fathers, and the preposterous  
idea that they are to look backward for better things ard not for-  
ward, longing, as it should seem, to return to the days of eating  
acorns and roots, rather than indulge in the degeneracies of civili-  
zation? And how much more encouraging to the achievements  
of science and improvement, is this, than the desponding view  
that the condition of man cannot be ameliorated, that what has  
been, must ever be, and that to secure ourselves where we are, we  
must tread, with awful reverence, in the footsteps of our fathers.  
This doctrine is the genuine fruit of the alliance between church  
and state, the tenants of which, finding themselves but too well in  
their present position, oppose all advances which might unmask  
their usurpations, and monopolies of honours, wealth and power,  
and fear every change, as endangering the comforts they now hold.  
Nor must we omit to mention, among the benefits of education,  
the incalculable advantage of training up able counsellors to ad-

quisite for its attainment. A language already fraught with all the  
eminent science of our parent countrv, the future vehicle of what-  
ever we may ourselves achieve, and destined to occupy so much  
space on the globe, claims distinguished attention in American  
education.  
  
Medicine, where fully taught, is usually subdivided into several  
professorships; but this cannot well be without the accessory of  
an hospital, where the student can have the benefit of attending  
clinical lectures, and of assisting at operations of surgery. With  
this accessory, the seat of our University is not yet prepared, either  
by its population, or by the numbers of poor, who would leave  
their own houses, and accept of the charities of an hospital. For  
the present, therefore, we propose but a single professor for both  
medicine and anatomy. By him the elements of medical science  
may be taught, with a history and explanations of all its successive  
theories from Hippocrates to the present day; and anatomy may  
be fully treated. Vegetable pharmacy will make a part of the bo-  
tanical course, and mineral and chemical pharmacy, of those of  
mineralogy and chemistry. This degree of medical information  
is such as the mass of scientific students would wish to possess, as  
enabling them, in their course through life, to estimate with satis-  
faction the extent and limits of the aid to human life and health,  
which they may understandingly expect from that art, and it con-  
stitutes such a foundation for those intended for the profession,  
that the finishing course of practice at the bed-sides of the sick,  
and at the operations of surgery in a hospital, can neither be long  
nor expensive. To seek this finishing elsewhere, must therefore be  
submitted to for a while.  
  
In conformity with the principles of our constitution, which  
places all sects of religion on an equal footing, with the jealousies  
of the different sects in guarding that equality from encroach-  
ment and surprise, and with the sentiments of the legislature in  
favour of freedom of religion manifested on former occasions, we  
have proposed no professor of divinity; and the rather, as the  
proofs of the being of a God, the creator, preserver, and supreme  
ruler of the universe, the author of all the relations of morality,  
and of the laws and obligations these infer, will be within the pro-  
vince of the professor of ethics, to which adding the developments

establish beginnings, in short, to be developed by time, as those  
who come after us shall find expedient. They will be more ad-  
vanced than we are, in science and in useful arts, and will know  
best what will suit the circumstances of their day.  
  
We have proposed no formal provision for the gymnastics of  
the school, although a proper object of attention for every institu-  
tion of youth. These exercises with ancient nations, constituted  
the principal part of the education of their youth. Their arms and  
mode of warfare rendered them severe in the extreme. Ours, on  
the same correct principle, should be adapted to our arms and  
warfare; and the manual exercise, military maneuvres, and tactics  
generally, should be the frequent exercises of the students, in their  
hours of recreation. It is at that age of aptness, docility, and emu-  
tation of the practices of manhood, that such things are soonest  
learnt, and longest remembered. The use of tools too, in the ma-  
nual arts, is worthy of encouragement, by facilitating to such as  
choose it, an admission into the ne -ighbouring work-shops.—To  
these should be added the arts which embellish life; dancing, mu-  
sic, and drawing; the last more especially, as an important part  
of military education. These innocent arts furnish amusement and  
happiness to those who, having time on their hands, might less  
inoffensively employ it;—needing, at the same time, no regular  
Incorporation with the institution, they may be left to accessory  
teachers, who will be paid by the individuals employing them; the  
University only providing proper apartments for their exercise.

portment between father and son, offers, in truth, the best example  
for that of tutor and pupil; and the experience and practice of *  
other countries in this respect, may be worthy of inquiry and  
consideration with us. It will be then for the wisdom and dis-  
cretion of the visiters to devise and perfect a proper system of  
government, which, if it be founded in reason and comity, will be  
more likely to nourish, in the minds of our youth, the combined  
spirit of order and self-respect, so congenial with our political in-

of lecturing for the different schools, so as to facilitate to the  
students the circle of attendance on them; the establishment of  
periodical and public examinations; the premiums to be given for  
distinguished merit; whether honorary degrees shall be conferred?  
and by what appellations? whether the title to these shall depend  
on the time the candidate has been at the University, or, where  
nature has given a greater share of understanding, attention and  
application, whether he shall not be allowed the advantages re-  
sulting from these endowments; with other minor items of go-

and the statute under which we act, having provided for the ap-  
pointment of these, we think they should moreover be charged  
with  
The erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of  
the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the Uni-  
versity generally;  
That they should have power to appoint a Bursar, employ a Proc-  
tor, and all other necessary agents;  
To appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole num-  
ber of Visiters voting for the removal;  
To prescribe their duties and the course of education, in confor-  
mity with the law;  
To establish rules for the government and discipline of the stu-

To improve, by reading, his morals and faculties;  
To understand his duties to his neighburs and

And, in general, to observe with intelligence and  
faithfulness all the social relations under which

To instruct the mass of our citizens in these  
  
their rights, interests and duties, as men and citi  
zens, being then the objects of education in the  
primary schools, whether private or public, in them  
should be taught reading, weiting and numerical  
arithmetic, the elements of mensuration (useful in so  
many calling) and the outlines of geography and  
history. And this brings us to the point at which  
we are to commence the higher branches of educa-  
tion, of which the legislature requires the deve-  
hopement:—those, for example, which are  
  
To form the statesmen, legislators and judges, on  
whom public prosperity, and individual happiness  
are so much to depend;  
  
To expound the principles and structure of govern-  
ment, the laws which regul.te the intercourse  
of nations, those formed municipally for our own  
government, and a sound spirit of legislation,  
which, banishing all the arbitrary and unneces-  
sary restraints on individual action, shall leave  
us free to do whatever does not violate the equal  
rights of another;  
  
To harmonize and promote the interests of agri.  
culture, manufactures, and commerce, and by  
well informed views of political economy, to give  
a ‘ree scope to ihe public industry;  
  
To develope the reasoning faculties of our youth,  
enlarge their minds, cultivate their morals, and  
mstil into them the precepts of virtue and order;  
  
To enlighten them with mathematical and physical  
sciences, which advance the arts, and adminis-  
ter to the hea&#x27;th, the subsistence, and comforts  
of human life;  
  
or not exist at all. Thi- «ould leave us then without  
those callings which depend on education, or send  
us to other countries to seek the insiruction they  
require. But the commissioners are happy ii COn-  
sidering the statute under which they are assem-  
bled as proof, that the legislature is far from the  
abandonment of objects so interesting. ‘They are  
sensible that the advantages of well direcied edu.  
cation, moral, peliticai and economical, are truly  
above «ll estimate.—Education generates habits of  
application of order, and the love of virtue; and  
con&#x27;rols, by the force of habit, any innate obliqui-  
ties in our moral organ:zation. We should be far  
itoo from the discouraging persuauion, that man is  
‘fixed, by the law of his nature, at a given point;  
that his imprevement is a chimera, and the hope  
Celusive of rendering ourselves wiser, happi +, or  
better than our forefathers were. As well might  
it be urged that the -vild «nd uw culiivate tree,  
hitherto yielding sour ana bitier fruit only, can  
never be made to yield better. Yet we know that  
the grafting art, implants a new tree on the savage  
Stock, producing what is more estimable both in  
kind and degree. Education, in like manner, en-  
grafts a new man on the native stock, and improves  
what in his nature was vicious and perverse,  
into qualities of viriue and social worth. And it  
cannot be but that each generation, succeeding to  
the Knowledge acquired by all those who preced-  
ex! it, adding to it their own acquisitions and dis-  
coveries, and handing the maps down for succes-  
sive and constant accumulation, must advance the  
knowledge and well-being of wankind not in-  
finitelv, as some have said, but indofiritively,  
aid ioa term which noone can fix or foresee. In-  
deed, we need look back only halfa century, to  
‘imes which many now living remember well, and  
see the wonderful advances in the sciences and  
arts which have been made within that period.—  
Some of these have rendered the elements them.  
selves subservient to the purposes of man, have  
harnessed them to the yoke of his labors, and ef:  
fected the great blessings of moderating his own,  
of accomplishing what wasjbeyond his feebie force,  
and of extending the comfor:s of life to a much

the learned sciences as useless acquirements—Some  
think that they do not better the condition of man;

dual concerns, should be left to private and indivi-  
dual effort; not reflecting that an establishment,

which we copy as it stands in the Report.  
  
¢ Encouraged, therefore, by the sentiments of the legislature  
manifested in this statute, we present the following tabular state-  
ment of the branches of learning, which we think should be taught  
in the university, forming them into groupes, each of which are  
  
within the powers of a single professor.

To discuss thoroughly this plan of study would require us  
  
to go deeply into several questions, each of which would be  
  
enough for a separate article, particularly that of the relative  
  
importance of classical literature, as a part of learning. This  
  
subject is becoming daily more interesting in our country,  
and we shall need no apology for often calling the attention  
of our readers to it, in the subsequent numbers of this Jour-  
nal. We can afford at present only to make a few general  
  
remarks, on the plan of study here proposed.

and the privilege of the gentleman, but  
it was also the duty of the citizen. Its  
fruits were not to be ripened in studious  
seclusion ; they were to be borne in the  
tumult of public affairs. Culture was  
to find expression in politics no less than  
in literature and the arts. He defined  
the purposes of the higher education in

““(1.) To form the statesmen, legisla-

much to depend. (2.) To expound the  
principles and structures of government,  
the laws which regulate the intercourse  
of nations, those formed municipally for  
our own government, and a sound spirit  
of legislation, which, banishing all un-  
necessary restraint on individual action,  
shall leave us free to do whatever does  
not violate the equal rights of another.  
(3.) To harmonize and promote the in-  
terests of agriculture, manufactures, and  
commerce, and by well-informed views  
of political economy to give a free scope  
  
to the public industry. (4.) To develop

the reasoning faculties of our youth, en-  
large their minds, cultivate their morals,  
and instil into them the principles of  
virtue and order.  
  
(5.) To enlighten  
them with mathematical and physical  
sciences, which advance the arts, and  
administer to the health, the subsistence,  
and comforts of human life. (6.) And  
generally, to form them to habits of re-  
flection and correct action, rendering  
  
them examples of virtue to others, and  
of happiness within themselves.”
