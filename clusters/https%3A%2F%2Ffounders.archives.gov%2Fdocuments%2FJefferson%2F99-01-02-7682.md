Richmond March 22d. 1808  
  
I had the pleasure to receive your favor of the 11th. instant the day after I returned from Albemarle. It is very distressing to me to discuss with you the topicks on which it treats, but in the state in which things are it is certainly best to come to a perfect understanding on every point &amp; to repair on both sides any injury which may have been received. To do you an injury or indeed any one in the administration, never enter’d into my mind, for while I labour’d under a conviction, not only that I had been injur’d, but that the friendly feeling which you had so long entertained for me had ceased to exist, the only sentiment wh. I indulged in consequence of it was that of sorrow. At present I am happy to say that all doubt of your friendship towards me having experienc’d any change is completely done away, and that the only anxiety which I feel is to satisfy you, that the impression was not taken on light ground, nor imputable to communications made to me by persons out of the administration.  
The mission in itself, of Mr. Pinkney or any other person, would not have produc’d such an effect. It resulted from a chain of circumstances of which that measure was only a part. When I left Madrid I communicated to Mr. Madison, in aid of our publick dispatches every idea which I had formed of the state of our affairs there and in all their relations, by sending him a copy of my private journal, and adding in private letters what it did not contain. Altho’ it was my earnest desire to get home and look to my private concerns, which I proposed to do soon after my return to London, I intimated to him that I was willing in consideration of the existing crisis, to act in any situation in which I might be useful. On my return to London I found that the seizures which were commenc’d in my absence had imposed on me a new &amp; important Duty. I resisted them &amp; not without some effect. By announcing to the British minister my intention to return to the U. States that autumn, I assumed the character for every essential purpose, of a special Envoy, with which Mr Madison was made acquainted, as he was likewise with my determination to remain there till the business was concluded. The evidence before him seemed to be satisfactory that, as nothing could be gained of the existing ministry but by force, any change of the attitude taken on our part was likely to do harm, &amp; if the ministry retired that the danger if such an effect would be increased by a change of attitude. This latter idea was strongly urged in a private letter to him of July 2d. 1806. with my earnest advice against such a mission. As the ship by which that letter was sent arrived at Phila. on the 26th. of March I concluded that he had recd. it on the 30th. It was written in consequence of intelligence from the U. States that such a mission was decided on by the govt. As I had recd. no answer to any of my communications from Madrid, or London after my return, nor any acknowledgment of my services at either place, or expression of a desire that I would come home or remain there, it seemed by the measure alluded to, as if it was consider’d that I was rather in the way of than of use to the administration. Its reserve to me for so long a time, and appointment of an associate after the receit of my private letter of July 2d. &amp; a publick letter of nearly the same date, &amp; after the change of the ministry was known, made a strong impression on my mind to that effect. A special mission was never gratifying to that on the ground, and perhaps never will be, while men are governed by those useful passions which stimulate them to virtuous actions. Such a mission reduces the resident minister, however respectable for his talents &amp; character to a cypher, from the moment it is known that it is contemplated, and if it does not destroy him it is because his character is sufficiently strong to bear the shock. the footing on which I had left my country; a consciousness of the zeal and integrity of my conduct in the publick service, and of my personal attachment &amp; devotion to the administration, and a firm belief that no change could be made to advantage, most probably increased my sensibility to the measure. Had such an one been contemplated I thought that I shod. have been the first to hear of it in a private letter from yourself or Mr. Madison, but I had to gather the intelligence from the news papers, the correspondence of others, the hints of Lord Holland &amp; even of Mr. Fox. Mr. Madison’s first letter to me on that subject, or on any other important one of the kind alluded to, which enter’d at all into them, was of the 11th. of March 1806., almost 10. months after I had left Madrid, &amp; 8. after my return to London. It was recd. on the 25. of april. It seemed to be intended to apprize me of the proposed measure, and from its stile taken in connection with the preceding circumstances, contributed greatly to confirm the impression which they had already made. The facility which it afforded to my departure appear’d to me to be the strongest feature in it. The letter—which Mr. Pinkney brought me, which was delivered to him &amp; by him to me open, was in the same tone. It stated that I was included in the special mission, but that Mr. Pinkney had brought a separate commission with him to take my place in case I chose to return home. It expressed no desire that I should remain &amp; unite in the negotiation. The joint commission too seemed to be peculiarly adapted to favor my return, by authorising one commissioner—to act in the absence of the other, in which it differed from those which I had carried with me abroad, they giving that power to one in case only of the death of the other. I could see no reason for his bringing with him a separate comn. to succeed me in the ordinary mission, if my immediate return had not been contemplated, as sufficient time would have been allowed for supplying it, if I remained &amp; joined in the negotiation, before it could be concluded, as for the variance in the conditions of the joint one. All those circumstances tended to convince me, that the administration had withdrawn its confidence from &amp; really wished to get rid of me. I was struck with astonishment and deeply affected by the reflection, as it was utterly impossible for me to trace the cause. Had I followed the impulse of my feelings, it would have been to have withdrawn on the arrival of Mr. Pinkney, but many considerations of great weight admonished me to pursue a different course. I had had much communication with Mr. Fox, and entertained great hope that through him our affairs might be settled to advantage. It did not seem probable that any other person could derive the same aid from those communications that might be done by a party to them. By remaining I thought that I might give support to the administration at home, which I most earnestly wished to do. For these and other reasons of the same kind I resolved to remain &amp; unite in the negotiation, with such character as might be sent, of which I informed Mr. Madison in my letter of the 29. of April which was written a few days after the reciet of his of March 11th., and in which I gave him distinctly to understand that that measure would be no cause of disagreement between the admin. &amp; myself. I remained &amp; acted accordingly, &amp; did every thing in my power to accomplish the views of my govt. &amp; country, &amp; finally concluded with Mr. Pinkney, the best treaty which it was possible to obtain of the British government. In uniting in the negotiation &amp; signing the treaty I committed my reputation on the result, and it is only by the course which the business afterwards took, that any unpleasant occurrence has arisen between the admin. &amp; myself.  
These were the circumstances which produc’d the impression, which I have acknowledged in the commencement of this letter, that your friendship had been withdrawn from me. But the assurances which you now make me &amp; the perfect knowledge which I have of your rectitude &amp; sincerity have completely effac’d that impression and restord to my mind that entire &amp; friendly confidence which it had always been accustomed to cherish.  
I am perfectly satisfied that you never meant to injure me &amp; that a belief that I had suffered by any act to which you were an innocent party would give you great pain. Still the circumstance of my having signed a treaty, which was disapproved for imputed great defects; of having exceeded our powers in signing it, which I should not have done but in a firm belief that I promoted thereby the best interests of my country &amp; of the administration, while I exposed myself to great responsibility by the measure, have given a handle to those who have wield’d it with great effect against me. you can little imagine to what extent the mischief has been carried. I could give you many details which it would be as painful for you to read as for me to recite.  
When I saw that I was depressed in a country which I had so long served with fidelity &amp; zeal, I could not be indifferent either to the cause or the consequences resulting from it. My sensibility was naturally increased by the excitment of those on the ground, who, by taking part in my favor, had essentially compromitted themselves. I replied to the denunciation that was circulated against me here for improper purposes, to many of my friends who called on me, in decisive terms, and complained earnestly of the injury done me by it. The sum of these conversations which were always of a nature confidential, it is not in my power to recollect with precision. It is possible that in some cases I may have expressed myself with too much zeal, and in others been misconceived. You may however be assured that my sole object was to do justice to myself, in a case of peculiar injustice, &amp; that I never went beyond its just limit.  
I look with extreme concern to the violent course which is pursued in the discussion which now agitates the country &amp; trust that it will be possible to moderate it. this sentiment is excited in a peculiar manner by what I have seen in the Enquirer of friday last. I neither know the author of the piece or from whom he derives his information in the passage to which I allude, nor indeed do I recollect the circumstance on wh. he relies in one case.  
I feel happy that we have had this explanation with each other. It has satisfied me that I had misconceived your feelings &amp; disposition towards me. Nothing remains but to prevent as far as possible all further inquietude. From the period above alluded to of peculiar excitment I have been attentive to this object &amp; shall pursue it in future with still greater zeal. I estimate the acts of my friends by the intention only. Being satisfied on that point I can bear with patience any consequences which may casually result from them. I am aware that under free govt., it is difficult to avoid those of the kind alluded to, for perhaps no important good was ever altogether free from some portion of alloy. I am however equally aware that the evils which are incident to the system, if indeed there are any, even to the individual who suffers by them, are trifling when compared with the great blessings which it imparts. I am my dear Sir with the highest respect &amp; esteem your your friend &amp; servant

PS. From an expression in your letter—that you had not supposed that I had entertained any objection to the association of any one with me in the business at London, I percieve that you have not read or if you have read that you have forgotten my letter of Feby 2. 1806. I therefore send you a copy of it, which I have to request that you will be so good as to return me after perusing it

Richmond, March 22th, 1*08.  
IV.AS Sir,  
1 have the pl**asuieio receive your let­  
  
ter nl .he lO&#x27;.h inst. the nay alter my re.  
tVirnff in \lbenia*le. It is d-s ressing to  
11• l*« to d&#x27;^cuss wi h you the topics oil  
which it treats but in the .J&#x27;t&#x27;t »n which  
things arc, it is c- r amly best to come 10  
a perfect tinders- mdmg on every point,  
and to r*r&gt;air 01 b &gt;th sides any injury  
which may have been &#x27;Merited* ’I o d you  
an injurf, or indeed any one in the adnv.  
nistrati n never entered into my mind, lor  
while I labored under a conviction not on.  
ty that I had been injired, but that the  
friendly fe- li -g which you had so long en.  
tefiained f r me, had ceased to exist, I  
never indulged any other sentiment in con*  
sequence of it, &#x27;han that of sorrow. At  
present I am happy to say, that all do? bl  
of vour friendship for me, having expert  
•need any change iscnmpletely done aw ay,  
and (hat the only anxie&#x27;y, which i fed, is  
to satisfy yon, that the impression was no1  
taken on slight ground, nor imputable to  
communications made me by peisons out  
of the administration*  
The mission in itself of Mr. Pinkney,  
or any other person would not have pro*  
duccd such an effect. It resulted from a  
chain of circunvtances of which that me«*  
sure was only a part. When I left Ma*  
dtid. I communicated to Mr. Madison in  
aid of nur public di.-r* ches, every idea  
which I had fin. med of the sta&#x27;e of ouraf*  
furs there, in all lheir relations, by send  
l&gt;.g him a copy of my private journal, and  
adding in private letters what it did con  
tain. Although it was my earnest desire  
to get home, and look to my private con  
cerns, which I proposed to do, soon aftei  
my return to London, I intima ed to him  
that 1 was willing in consideration of th&lt;  
exiting crisis, to in a y situa ion, ii  
which 1 might be useful. On my returr  
to I.ond n, I found list the seizures who I  
had commenced in my ab ence, had im  
posed on me, a new and important doty  
I resisted them, and not without some ef  
feet. By announcing to the British mi  
iater, my intention to return to the U. S  
  
hat autumn,I assumed the chBivc&#x27;er for * t  
:very t-s ential purp se of a special envoy ; s  
v th winch Mi Madison wa - m-d: i cqo. ml t  
:d, as he waal k wise, wi&#x27;h toy dcteiuiiouii ,  
a lo remain «. herd lillthebu incss was con* (  
:l tided. The evidence b, lore biin seemed  
lo be satisfactory, thut as nothing could be &#x27;  
gained, of the existing ministry, but by &#x27;  
totcc, any change of the altiiude taken on  
our part, was likely to do harm, and that  
if the minis&#x27;) y retired, the danger of such  
an efledf, would be increased by a change {  
of a titude. This latter idea w as strongly  
urged, in :i private letter to him of ihe 2d i  
of Februao, 1806, with my earnest ad. j  
vice against such a mission. As th« ship  
by which that letter was sent, arrived at  
Philadelphia, on the S6ih of March, l con­  
cluded that he had itcciveditbv thc30tb.  
It was writ;en in consequence of inlelli&#x27;  
gence from the U. S. that such a mission  
was decided on by the government. As I  
had receved no answer to any of my coin  
municatinns from Madrid, or London, al­  
ter my return, nor a-ty acknowledgiuen  
of my service at either p ace. or express -  
on of a desite, that I should come hone  
or remain there, it seemed h&gt; the nieusui  
alluded to, as if it was considered, that i  
was ra&#x27;her in the way than of use, to the  
administration. Its reserve to me for so  
long a ime, and the appom mem of an as­  
sociate, after the teceipt of my private let.  
ter nf February 2,1, and a puljhc one of  
nearly the same dale, and after the change  
in the adminihtrai.nn was known nude a  
deep impiessinn on my mind oiha* fleet.  
Special missions were never well r«-c: ivrd  
by those on the ground, and perhaps ne_  
ver will he, while men are governed by  
those useful passions, which s&#x27;unulate  
them to vii tuous actions. Such a mission  
reduces the resident minister, howevej  
•esner ;,hle. for 111-l:tli-nl&lt;&lt; aiwt rlmrart.r ■«  
  
» Cypher, from the moment it is known  
hat it is contemplated, and if it does not  
destroy h m. it is bee use hischaratler is  
suf^- ;enlly srong to bear the shock. The  
footing on which I bad left my coun&#x27;ry, a  
consciousness of the Zealand integrity of  
my conduct tu the public service and ot  
my peixofcal aaaclnr.cnl and devotion to  
he administration, with a firm belief that  
no change could be made to advan age,  
may possibly have encreased m&gt; scnsibi­  
i’ty to the in*a-ure. Had such an one  
been contemplated, I thought »ha i ■ hould  
have been the first to hear of it in a pri.  
va&#x27;e letter from yourself or Mr. Madison  
but 1 bad to gather the in»eil gence ftom  
the new papers, the cotitsnontlence of  
others, the hints of Lord Holland, ami r.  
vt-n of Mr Fox Mi. Mad son&#x27;s first leltet  
|lo n.e on a iy important subject, v h ch  
was of the llth of March, 1*&lt;06. almost  
! 10 months after i bail left Madrid, and 8  
I after my return to London, was teceived  
Inn the 25 l» of April. It seemed to be  
i intended to announce, the proposed mea.  
l ure, and fmm iis stile, taken in c m.&lt; c&quot;  
tinn with the preceding circumstances,  
contributed gieatly to confirm the impres.  
vt»n which they bad already made. The  
facility which it affixded to ms dcpai :  
ure appeared to nic to be th-. strongest  
feature in it.  
The letter which M?. Pinkney  
brought me, which was delivered to  
him and by him to me open, was in  
the same tone. It sta ed that I was  
included in the spreid mission, bat]  
that Mr. Pinkney had i separate com­  
mission with hi in, to t .ke my place in  
case I chose to return mine. It ex­  
pressed no desire that I v, ould remain  
and join in the negotiation. The j &gt;int  
commission seemed also to be peculi­  
arly adapt&#x27;d to favor that object, as it  
authorised one commissioner to ac  
singly in the absence of the other, in  
which it differed from those which I  
had carried with me abroad, they gi­  
ving that power to one in case only of  
the death of the other. I could see  
j no reason for bis bringing with him a  
separate commission, to .succeed me |  
in the ordinary mission, if my immt - i  
diate retirn had not been conteinula. •  
  
red, as sufficient time would have been  
allowed for supplying it it I remained  
and joined in the negotiation, bt re t  
could be concluded, or foi th^: vmfi­  
ance iu the conditions of the jnjr.t one­  
All these circumstances tended o cm  
vince me that the arlmiui1 iration had  
withdrawn its confidence from me, and  
that it really wished to get rid of me.  
I was struck with astonishment at the  
idea, and deeply affected by it, as it  
was utterly impossible for me to trace  
the cause. If *d I followed the im­  
pulse of my feelings, it would love  
been, to have withdrawn on the arri\ /  
of Mr. Pinkney j but many considera­  
tions of great weight admonished me  
to pursue a different course. I had  
had mti&#x27;h communication with Mr.  
Fox, and entertained great hopes, that  
through him our affairs might be set.  
tied to advantage, it did not seem  
pro&#x27;able, that any other person could  
derive the same aid from those com­  
munications that might be done by a  
party to them. By remaining I tho’t  
that I might give supprort to the ad­  
ministration at home, which l most  
i earnestly wished to do. For these  
and other reasons of the same kind, 1  
resolved to remain and unite in the ne­  
( gociation with such chara&lt; ter as might  
be sent, of which I gave Mr. Madison  
information in mv letter, of the 29th  
, t»f Apr.l, which was written a few  
d»\ s after the receipt of his of March  
, the llth, and iu which i gave him dis­  
  
inctly to und:rstand that, that tnea- It  
ure would be no cause of disagree-n  
nervt between the administration and l  
nyself. I re nained and acted actor- ?  
lingly, and did every thing in my ,  
lower to acc&gt; npli^h the views of ir»v i  
government and country, aiul finally  
included with Mr. Pinkney, the best j  
treaty which it was possible to obtain  
af the British government* In uniting:  
in the negotiation and signing the  
treaty, I com niited my reputation on  
the result, and it is only by the course  
which, the business afterwards took,  
that any unple «sant occurrence has a­  
riaen between the administration and  
myself.  
These were the circumstances which  
produced the impression, which 1 have  
acknowledged in the commencement  
&gt;f this letter, that your friendship had  
been withdrawn from me. But the  
assurances which you now make me  
md the perfect knowledge which 1  
have of your rectitude and sincerity  
have completely effaced that impressi­  
on, and restored to my mind, that en­  
tire and friendly confidence, which it  
*iad always been accustomed to che­  
rish.  
I am perfectly satisfied, that you  
never meant to injure me, and that a  
belief, that I had suffered by any act, to  
which you were an innocent party,  
would give you great pain. Still tin  
circumstance of my having signed a  
treaty which was disapproved, for im­  
puted great defects ; in having exceed­  
ed our powers, in signing it, which I  
- U_1.1__ 1_ J_‘i_ • r  
  
..vv l»q»W UX/IIV, l/Ul III a Iirifl  
belief that I promoted thereby the best I  
interests of mv country, Sc of the admi-i  
nistration, wh&#x27;le I exposed mvself to  
great responsibility by the measure,’  
have given a h indie to those who have  
wielded it, with great effect against  
me. You can little imagine to what  
extent the mischief hns been carried.  
I could give you many details which  
it would be as painful lor \ou to read,  
as for me to recite.  
When I saw that I was depressed in  
a country which I had so long served  
with fidelity and zeal, 1 could rot he  
indifferent either to the cause, or the i  
consequences resulting from it. My  
sensibility was naturally increased, by  
the excitement of those on the ground,  
who, bv taking part 5n my favor, had  
essentially compromitted themselves.  
I replied to the denunciation that was  
circulated against me here for impro­  
per purposes to many of my friends,  
who called on me in decisive terms and  
complained earnestly of the injury  
done me^tiy it. The sum of these  
c mversatior.s, which were a&#x27;waxs of a  
nature confidential, it is not in m\
power to recollect with precision. It  
ts possible that on some cases l mav  
have expressed myself with too much  
/&#x27; al, and toothers been misconceived.  
u may however be assured, thatirv  
sol?.object was to d &gt; justice to my.  
sell in a case of a peculiar hardship,  
and that I never wen* beyond that li­  
mit. * *• * *■ &#x27; *•

siformed of the state oi&#x27;our nﬀairs there, in all

to do, soon after my return to London, I

-1 ter my return Iron; Albemarle. It is  
distrcs-i; g to me, to discuss with you  
the ti kvltich it treats, but ill tiie  
things are, it is certain­  
ly best to come to a perfect under­  
pii eVery point, and to repair  
j on both sides any injury which may  
have been received. To do you an  
injury, or indeed any one in the ad­  
ministration never entered into my  
!, for while I labored under a con-  
Mi not only that I had been injur­  
»ut thai the friendly feeling which  
you bad so lot 1 for me,  
, I never indulged  
other sentiment in consequence  
of it, than that of sorrow. At pre­  
! am happy to say, that all doubt  
of your friendship for me, 1 avirt&#x27;g ex­  
enced any change is   
y, and that the only anxiety,  
; which I fe*d, is to satisfy you, that  
the impression was not taken on slight  
ad, nor imputable to comrsiuni  
cations made me by persons out of. the  
j administration.  
The mission in itself of Mr. Pink-  
I ney, or any other person, would not  
&#x27; have produced such an effect. It re­  
sulted from a chain of cifcnms!..  
&#x27;of which &#x27; lire was only a p irt.  
When 1 left Madrid, I Co&#x27;mmunii  
to Mr. Madison in aid of our public  
dispatches, every idea which T had  
ed of t&#x27;.

my earnest desire to get home,  
and look to my private con­  
i, which I proposed to do, soon  
after my return to London. 1 iuti  
mated to him, that I was in  
consideration of the existing crisis to  
actio any situation in which 1   
useful. On my return to London, I  
found that the seizures which bail com­  
mencedin my -id imposed on  
me a new and important duty. [ re­  
sisted ttteYn and not without some  
effect. By announcing to the British  
minister, my intention to returi  
the United States that autumn.  
sumed the character for every essen­  
tial purpose of a special envoy ;  
with which Mr. Madison was made  
acquainted, as Ijie was likewise, with  
my determination to remain there  
till tiie business WaS concluded. The  
evidence before him seemed, to be I  
satisfactory, that as nothing could be]  
gained, of the existing ministry, but!  
by force, any change oi the atti  
taken on&#x27;our part, was likely to do |  
harm, and that it the. ministry re- ■  
tired, the danger of such an effect,;  
wnuld be 1 by a change of;  
attitude. This latlet idea wi  
ly urged, in a private i-cttcr to him  
of the 2d of Februa.iy, 1806, with  
my earnest acbj eh a-j  
mission. As the ship h that]

cluded that he had received il by the {

of intelligence from the United S  
that such a mission was decided on by \
the government. As I had received!

nUhmoxJ. March 22. ISaS.  
Dear Sir.  
I had thr picasorc to receive your  
lctur othe 10th inst. the day after  
jry icturn from Albemarle. It i  
distressing to me to discuss with you  
thetopicsoii which it treats, but in  
theSute-in which &quot;things arc, it is  
certainly hest lo cone to a perfect  
understanding on eyvry point, and  
to repair on liotli sides any injury  
tf hich may have been received. To  
do&#x27; you an injtirf, or indeed any one  
in the a Jrainisiralion, never entered  
into my mind, for while I laboured  
tinder a conviction, not only that I  
had betn injured, but lhat thefri-nd-ly  
feeling vr hich you had so long en­  
tertained (or mei had ceased to ex­  
ist, 1 nevrr indulged any other sen­  
Umetuin consequence of it, than Out  
of sorrow. At present I am kippv.  
toav, that all doubt of your friend  
hip fjr me having experienced any  
cluQc, b completely done aw jy,and  
that . the only anxiety which I feel, is  
to sat-ify you that the impression was  
no&#x27;t tuk.cn on slight ground, nor im­  
putable to communications mide me  
bv nctsons out of the administration.  
The mission in itclf ofM.Pinck­  
ucr, or .ny other person, would not  
have produced such an effect. It re­  
sulted fiomachatn of circumstances  
of which tht measure was only a  
pU When I left Madrid, I com­  
municated to Mr. Mad-son in aid of  
our public dispatches, every idea  
which I hud formed of the state of  
ourriuirs therein ail their relations,  
ljy sending him a copy of my private  
journal, arid adding, private let­  
ters w hit it did not conuin. Althu  
it was my earnest dcs.. c tb get home  
&#x27;and look tomy private concerns.  
sthttli I proiKjsed to- do soon after.  
mr return K Lohdon, I intimated !  
ti bim, that I was willing, in conside­  
rattan of the existing crisis, to act  
in any sntuation, iw which I m&#x27;th:  
be mrful. On my return to J.on­  
Ion I f ur.d that the setrures which  
&quot;hid commenced in my absence had  
imposed on me a new and impoitari  
dfty. IrctcJ them, and not with­  
nut sum-.: t feci. Bv announcing to  
the Ki:isb Minster my inten&#x27;ion to,&#x27;  
r.urn to the U. Stages that autumn,  
lY.i5sumed the character for every  
essential fmrjKseofa specialEnvny ;  
with which Mr. M.idion asmadc  
tvcquainlcd, a&amp; he wus likewise, with  
xny p&#x27;ctenninaMon to remain there  
iir.til.the business wi s concluded.  
The evidence before hhn seemed to  
be satisfactory, that as nothing could

ZVIiuiotty retired, life dangl&#x27;r of such  
an cflict would be increased by a  
cliang of attitude. Tnia latter idea  
btrtiik;ly urged, in a psivate Icttrr  
to him of the 2d Feb. 1806, with  
my earnest advice against such a  
inisMDn. as tre snip ny vhich that  
letter was f ent, arrived at Phifadel­  
phta on the SSih cf March, I conclu-  
t! d that he had received it by the I

ground,&#x27; and perhaps neverwill be,  
while men &#x27;ae( governed bythos&#x27;e  
useful passions, whiclr stimulate

mission rrducei the resident, Minis-  
f ter, however respectahle, for his ta-  
Icnt?tand character toacypnerfrom  
the rriomeni it&#x27;is knowb46at it is  
contemplated, and if it does not des­  
troy him. it Is&#x27;.becausd his charac  
I ter is sufficiently strong to bear the  
shock. . j.  
The Tooting on &quot;which I had left  
ray country a -consciousness of the  
zeal and integrity of myxonduct in  
the public service, and dF my per­  
sonal attachment and devotion to the  
admlnistratiin, wi&#x27;.h a firm belief that  
no change could be made to advan­  
tage, may possibly have encreased  
my sensibility to the measure; Had  
ftich an one been contemplated, I  
thought that I should have been the  
first lo hear of it in a private letter  
from yourself or Mr. Madison, but  
I. had to gather the intelligence from  
the newspapers, the currespondence  
of others, the&quot;hints of Lord Holland,  
.snd even of Mr. Fox. &#x27; Mr.Madi­  
son&#x27;trfist letterto me on any impor­  
tant subject, which was of the 1 1th  
March, 1806, almost 10 months af-  
ie I I ad left Madrid, and eight af­  
ter my return to London, was recei­  
ved on the 2 5th of April. It seem­  
ed to be intended to announce the  
proposed measure, and from its  
stile, taken in connection with pre­  
ceding circumstances, contributed  
greasy to confirm the impression  
which they had aln ady made. The  
facility which it afforded to my de­  
parture appeared to me to be the  
strongest feature in it. r  
The letter which Mr. l&#x27;inckney  
brought mi&#x27;, which was delivered to  
him and by him to me open, was in  
thv same tore. It stated th it I was  
included in ths special mission, but  
that Mr. Pmckoey had a separate  
commission with him to take mv  
place, in easel chost to return home.  
It exressed-no desire that I woult  
remain and join in the negotiation.  
The j lint commission seemed also  
peculiarly adapted to favor that ob  
ject, as it authorised one commis  
sioner to act singly in the absence  
of the other, fn which it differed from  
those which I had carried with me  
abroad, they giving that power to  
one in case only of the death of the  
other. J could see no reason for  
his bringing with him a separate  
commission, to succeed me in the  
ordinary mission, if my immediate  
retu&#x27;n hid not uecn contemplated,  
as sMfTicient time would have been  
allowed for supplying i: if I remain  
cd and joined in the negociation,  
before it could be concluded, or for  
the variance in the conditions of the  
pint one. All these circumstances  
tended to convince me, that the ad­  
ministration had withdrawn its confi­  
dence from rnc, and that it really  
wishvd to get rid of me. I was  
struck with astonishment at the idea,  
ic deeply afiectcdb) it, s itwasutterly  
impossible for me to trace the cause.  
Had I followed the impulse of my  
feelings, it would have been to hive  
withdrawn on the arrival of Mi.  
Pinckhey, but many considerations  
of reat weight admonished me to  
pursue a diflVent course. I had  
much communication with Mr. Fox,  
tnd entertained great hopes, that  
through him our affairs might be  
settled to advantjge. It did not seem  
piobabe, that any other person could  
derive the sarie aid from thrse com­  
munications that might be done by  
a partr to then!. Bv remaining I  
thought that I mi git &#x27;ive support  
a &#x27; I I  
ioine aurmniSTauon aKjiome, wnicn  
I most sincerely wished loado,. For  
these and other reasons of the same  
kind, I resolved to remain and uniu  
in nVgociation wi&#x27;.h such character as  
might he sent, of which I gave Mr.  
Mad. son information in mv letter of  
the 29th of April, which was wri ten  
a few days after the receipt of his  
of March 1 Ith, and in which I g ivi  
him distinctly to understand, that  
hat measure would t-c no cause&quot; td  
disagreement between the adminis  
tration and myself. I remained and  
acted accordingly, and dicl ever  
hinft in my power to accomplish

I am perfectly satisfied that ybu  
never meant .to injure me, and thai.  
a belief, that I had suffered byr any  
act, to which. &#x27;yojtt were an innocent  
pafty, woald give you great pain.  
Still the circumstance of my having  
signed a treaty &#x27;&quot;which was disap­  
proved for, imputed great defect; in  
having exceeded our powers, in sign­  
ing it; which! should not have done  
but in a firm belief that I promoted  
thereby the best interests of my  
country, and of the administration,  
whileI exposed myself to great res­  
ponsibility by ihe measure, have tri-  
ven a handle to these who have wield  
elwiih great enert against roe.  
You cap&#x27; little imagine U what ex­  
tent the mischief has been carried.  
I could giv you many details which  
t would be as painful for you to read  
Js for me to recite.  
When I sAv that I was depressed  
in a country which I had so long  
served with fidelity and zeal, I could  
not be indifferent either to the cause  
or the consequences resulting from  
it. My sensibility was naturally in­  
creased by the excitement of those  
f cn the ground, who, by taking p.irr  
in my tavor, had essenually comnro-  
initted themselves. I replied to the  
denunciation lhat was circulated  
against me here, for improper pur­  
poses, to many of my friends, who  
called on me in decisive terms and  
complained earnestly of the injnry  
done me by it. The sum of these  
conversations, which were always of  
a nature confidential, it is not in my  
oower to recollect wjih precision.  
It is possible that on some occas;ons  
I may fiave&quot; expressed myself with  
oo much zeal, and in others may  
ave been misconceived. You may  
however be assured, that my sole  
object was to do justice to mystlf  
in a rase of peculiar hardship, and  
that I never went beyond that Pmit.  
.  
I am happy that we have had this  
explanation with each othef. It has  
satisfied me that I had misconceived  
your feelings and disposition towards  
me. Nothing remains but to pre-  
.. A . f i i i r 7r  
cui as tar u possiuie, an runnel  
inquietude. From thp period above-  
mentioned of peculiar excitement, I  
have been attentive to this object,  
and shall pursue it in future with  
still greater zeal. I estimate the  
acts rjf&#x27;my friends by the intention  
only. Being satisfied on that point,  
1 can bear with patience any conse  
qaencts which may casually result  
irosn them, I am aware that und -r  
free governments it is difficult to  
avoid thoe of the kind alluded to,  
fr perhaps no important good was  
ever altogether free from some nor  
tion of alloy, I am however equally  
aware, that the evils incident to the  
system, if indeed there are any.even  
to the, individual who suffers under  
them, are trifling, when compared  
with the great blessings which it  
imparts.  
I am, my dear sir, Sec. &amp;c.  
JAMES MONROE.  
P. S. From an expression in your  
letter, that you had not supposed  
that I had entertained any objection  
to the association of any one with  
me, in the business at London, I  
perceive that you have not read, or

on our part, was iixeiy touo narm,  
l . tlwtif me ministry retired, the dan-  
. ger of such an effect would be increa­  
. &#x27; sed by a change of attitude. &#x27; This lat­

quence of intelligence from the United

ded on by the government. As I had  
-&#x27;-received no answer to any of my com-  
  
mubications from Madrid or London,  
, after my return, oor any acknowledg-  
  
mentof mr aervicet at eitherplace, or

the measure alluded to, as if it was  
considered x hat, I was rather : in the  
way than of use to the administration.  
Its reserwc to me for so long a time,  
and the appointment of an associate,  
  
after the receipt of my private jetter  
of FebrtlaryJidV and a &#x27; public &#x27;one of

minu ao umi tuau. special missions  
were ne ver well received by those on  
me ground, and perhaps never will be  
while men are governed by thoe use­  
, ful passions which stimulate them to  
virtuous actions. Such a mission re­  
duces the resident minister, however  
respectable,&quot; r for his talents; and cha  
  
racter, to a cvpner, irom, uit moment  
  
jt ts known that it is contemplated, Et  
if it does not destroy him, it is because  
  
it could be concludrd, or for the van  
  
ance in the conditions of the joint one.  
All these circumstances tended to con­  
vince me that the administration had  
  
withdrawn its confidence from me, c

tnax it reaiiy wisnea;p get ria-oi me.  
I&#x27;was struck witft-&#x27;nishniqit at the.  
idea, and deeply aUUitd by it,vas itwa  
utterly impossible fof me, to trace the  
cause. Iiad I followed the impulse  
of my feelings it would have been to  
have withdrawn on the arrival of Mri  
Pinckaey-but many considerations p f  
grpar weight&quot; admonished me to pur­  
sue a different couase I had m uch com­  
munication with Mr.&#x27; Fox, and enter­  
tained great hopes, that through him  
our affairs might be settled to advan­  
tage. It did not seem probable, that  
aav other person could derive the same  
aid from thovi communications that  
might be done, by a party to them. By  
remaining, I thought that I might give  
support tathe astration at hpme  
which I most earnestly wished to do,.  
For these and other reasons of the

unite in the negotiation with &quot;such cha­

gave Mr. Madison information in my

written a few days after the receipt of

gave him distinctly to understand that;

Dmi Six,  
-1 I had the nleaanre to receive  
yoor letter of tht lOth instant, the  
day after mv return- from Alha­

to discuss with you the topics on

things are, it h certain?  
be step come SO a perfect under­  
standingp^everv point, and to

To do you an injury, or indeed  
assy owe in th* administration, ne­  
wer entered into mv amnd| for  
while I laboured under a convic­  
only that ( had been in­  
jured, but that the friendly being  
which you had to long entertained  
forme, bed ceased to exist; f  
never indulged any other senti­  
ment in consequence of it, than  
that of sorrow. At present, f am  
happv to say, that all doubt of  
your friendship for me, having  
experienced any change, ia tom*  
plculy dose away ; aud that the  
only aoaicty, which I feel, is to  
satisfy you, that the impression

of tirtwnum W which

found that the teixure* which had

ftkposed bn aae a oew and impoe.

not without tome effect. By no*  
flouncing to the British minister  
my intention to retnrn to thy U­

turned the character for every ea­

with which Mr. Madison wi.

by a change of attitude. Thia  
lattrr idea was strongly urged let  
a private letter to bint of tbc 2d

cat advice against such 9 ihitsion.

prcaaioaa of a deaire that I ahould

public one nf nearly the. aaaae  
date, and after the rhtagn in the  
hdpftMlstratioti was known, made  
tdeep impression on my mind to  
that effect. Special miationa  
were never well received by those  
on thegronod, and perhapk never  
will be while men are gtaccncd  
by those useful pasaioom which  
stimulate them to virti/oua ac­

the resident minister, fcowcvta
