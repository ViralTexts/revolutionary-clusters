Sir.  
						Department of State, March 20th: 1807.  
					  
					I have laid before the President your letter of the 12th: instant, communicating the views of His Britannic Majesty in relation to the French decree of Novr: 21st: 1806, and the principle of retaliation, through the commerce of Neutrals; who may submit to  
						the operation of that decree; as also the measure actually taken, of prohibiting all Neutral commerce from port to port of his enemies, not only the ports of France, but those of such other Nations, as either in alliance with France, or subject to her dominion, have by  
						measures of active offence, or by the exclusion of British Ships, taken a part in the present war.  
					The President cannot be insensible, Sir, to the friendship &amp; confidence towards the United States, which are signified by His Britannic Majesty in this communication. In making this acknowledgment, however, the President considers it not less incumbent  
						on him, to reserve for a state of things which it is hoped may never occur, the right of discussing the legality of any particular measures to which resort may be had, on a ground of retaliation. At this time, it would suffice to observe, that it remains to be more fully  
						ascertained, in what sense the decree in question will be explained, and to what extent it will be carried into execution; and consequently, whether in any case, the United States, can be involved in questions concerning measures of retaliation supposed to accrue to one  
						bellegerent from such a proceeding by another. But it is worthy the justice and the liberality of the British Government to recollect, that within the period of those great events which continue to agitate Europe, instances have occurred, in which the commerce of neutral  
						nations more especially of the United States, has experienced the severest distresses from its own orders &amp; measures manifestly unauthorized by the law of Nations. The respect which the United States owe to their neutral rights, and the interests they have in maintaining  
						them, will always be sufficient pledges, that no culpable acquiescence on their part, will render them accessary to the proceedings of one bellegerent nation, through their rights of neutrality, against the commerce of its adversary.  
					With regard to the particular order issued against the trade of neutrals from one port to another of the enemies of Great Britain, no fair objection can lie against it, provided it be founded on and enforced by, actual blockades as authorized by the law of  
						Nations. If on the other hand, the order has reference, not to such a blockade, but to a supposed illegality of the Neutral trade from one to another of the described ports, the remark is obvious, that on that supposition, the order is superfluous; the trade being, as  
						interdicted by the law of Nations, liable at all times, without any such order, to the capture of British Cruizers and the condemnation of British Courts; and if not interdicted as such by the law of Nations, it canunclear otherwise be made illegal, than by  
						a legal blockade of the ports comprehended in the order. This inference is applicable even to the case of a neutral trade between the ports of France herself; since it is not a principle of the acknowledged law of Nations, that neutrals may not trade from one to another port  
						of the same bellegerent Nation. And it would be an innovation on that law, not before attempted, to extend the principle to a neutral trade between ports of different Countries confessedly open in times of peace as well as of war.  
					If the British order refers for its basis, to the principle of retaliation against the French decree, it falls under the observations already made on that subject, and which need not be repeated. I am &amp;c:

Depfrartment of State,  
March 20th, 1807.  
  
Sir—I have laid before the  
president your letter of the 12th  
inst. communicating the views of  
his Britannic majesty, in relation  
tothe l’rench decree of Novem-  
ber 21st, 1806, and the principle  
of retaliation, through the com-  
merce of neutrals, who may sub-  
mit to the operation of that de-  
cree ; as also, the measure actu-  
ally taken, of prohibiting all neu-  
tral commerce from port to port,  
of his enemies, not only the ports  
of France, but those of such  
other nations, as, either in alli-  
ance with France, or subject to  
her dominion, have, by measures  
ofactive offence, or by the exclu-  
sion of British ships, taken a part  
in the present war.  
  
The president cannot be insen-  
sible, sir, to the friendship and  
confidence towards the United  
States, which are signified by his  
Britannic majesty in this commu-  
nication. In making this ac-  
knowledgment, however, the pre -  
sident considers it not lessincum-  
bent on him, to reserve, for a  
state of things which it is hoped  
may never occur, the right of  
discussing the legality of any  
particular measures, to which re-  
sort may be had, on a ground of  
retaliation. At this time, 1t would  
suffice to observe, that it remains  
to be more fully ascertained, in  
what sense the decree in question  
will be explained, and to what  
extent it will be carried into exe-

can be involved in questions con-  
cerning measures of retaliation,  
supposed to accrue to one belli-  
gerent, from such a proceeding,  
by another. But it is worthy the  
justice and the liberality of the  
British government, to recollect,  
that within the period of those  
great events, which continue to  
  
agitate Europe, instances have  
  
occurred, in which the commerce  
of neutral nations, more especi-  
ally of the United States, has ex-  
perienced the severest distresses  
from its ewn orders and mea-  
sures, manifestly unauthorised by  
the law of nations. The respect  
  
which the United States owe to .  
  
their neutral rights, and the in-  
terest they have in maintaining  
them, will always be sufficient  
pledges, that no culpable acqui-  
escence on their part, will render  
them accessory to the proceedings  
of one belligerent nation, through  
their rights of neutrality, against  
the commerce of its adversary.  
With regard to the particular  
order issued against the trade of  
neutrals, from one port to another  
of the enemies of Great Britain,  
no fair objection can lie against  
it, provided it be founded on, and  
enforced by, actual blockades as  
authorized by the law of nations.  
If, on the other hand, the order  
has reference,notto such a block-  
ade, but to a supposed illegality  
of the neutral trade from one to  
another of the described ports,  
the remark is obvious, that on  
that supposition, the order is su-  
perfluous ; the trade being, as  
interdicted by the law of nations,  
liable at all times, without any  
such order, to the capture of Bri-  
tish cruisers and the condemna-  
tion of British courts ; and if not  
interdicted as such by the law of  
  
nations, it can no otherwise be  
made illegal, than by a legal  
blockade of the ports compre.  
hended in the order. This infer-  
ence is applicable, even to the  
case of a neutral trade between  
the ports of France herself, since  
it is not a principle of the ac-  
knowledged law of nations, that  
neutrals may not trade from ore  
to another port of the same belli-  
gerent nation. And it would be  
an innovation on that law, not be-  
fore attempted, to extend the  
principle to a neutral trade be-  
tween ports of different coun-  
trics, confessedly open in times  
of peace as well as of war.  
  
If the British order refers for  
its basis, to the principle of reta-  
  
liation against the French decree,  
  
it falls under the observations al-  
ready made on that subject, and  
which need not be repeated.

cree of November 21, 1806, and to

but those of such other nations, as, ci­

liation, supposed to accrue to on-&gt;  
belligerent from such a proceeding b»  
another. Hut, it is worthy the justie*  
and liberality of the British govern­  
ment, to recollect, that, within the  
period of ihose great events, which  
Continue to agitate Europe- instances  
have occurred, in which the com­  
merce of neutral nations, more espe­  
cially of the U. S. has experienced  
tlit-severest distresses from its own  
orders and measures, manifestly un  
authorised by the lawof nations. The  
respect which tne U. 5. owe to their  
neutral rights, and the inlereat they  
have in maintaining them, vvill always  
be sufficient pledges, that no culpable  
acquiescence, on their part, will ren­  
der them accessary to the proceed­  
of one belligerent nation, thro&#x27;  
their rights of neutrality, against the  
commerce of its adversary.  
1 With regard to the particular order  
issued against the trade of neutrals,  
J from one port to another, of the ene­  
! mies of li. Britain, no fair objection  
can lit against it, provided it be found­  
ed on, and enforced by actual bloc­  
kades, as authorised by the law of na- (  
tions. If, on the other hand, the or­  
der has reference, not to such a bloc­  
kade, but to a supposed illegality of j  
the neutral trade from one lo another j  
of the described ports, tiie remark is I  
Obvious, that on that supposition, the j  
order is SUpei&#x27;flUoU3 ; the trade being- |  
as interdict ed by the law of nations, j  
liable, al all times, without any such ,  
order, lo the capture of British crui­  
sers, and tbe condemnation of British i  
• -i  
court* ; and, if not interdicted as &#x27;  
such, by the law of nations, it can no I  
otherwise be made illegal, than by a j  
legal blockade of the ports coin pre- j  
bended in the order. This inference &#x27;  
jis applicable, even to the case of a \
| neutral trade between tbe ports of  
Prance herself; since it is not a prin­  
ciple of the acknowledged law of na­  
tions, that neutrals may not trade from •  
one to another port of the same belli- |  
gercnt nuiion. And it would be an j  
innovation on that law, not before at- I  
tempted, to extend the principle to a  
neutral trade, between ports of differ­  
ent countries, confessedly open in  
times of peace as well as of war.  
If the British order refers for its  
basin to the principle of retaliation a- j  
gainst the French decree, it falls un­  
der the observations already made on  
that subject, and a hich need not be  
repeated,  
1 have the honor to be, with great  
respect and consideration, sir, your  
moit obedient,

Mu. Madison to Mr. Erskike.  
Department of State, March 20th, 1807.  
Sir,  
I have laid before the president your letter of  
the 1 -2th instant, communicating the views of bis  
Brtaunick majesty, in relation to tha French decree  
of November 21st, JS06‘, and the principle of retali­  
ation, through the commerce of neutrals, who may  
submit to the operation of that decree; as also, the  
measure actually taken, of prohibiting all neutral  
commerce trom port to port, of his enemies, not on­  
ly the ports of France, hut those.of such other na­  
tions, as either in alliance with Trance, or suhjert  
to her dominion, have, by measures of active offence,  
or by the exclusion of British ships, taken a part in  
the present war.  
The president &lt;-annot be insensible, sir, to the  
friendship and confidence towards the United Slates  
which are signified by his Britannick majesty in  
this communication. In making this acknowledg­  
ment, however, the president considers it not less  
incumbent on him, to reserve, for a state of thing*  
which it is hoped may never occur, the right of dis­  
cussing the legality of any particular measures, to  
which resort may be had, on a ground of retaliation.  
At this time, it would suffice to observe, that it re­  
mains to be more fully ascertained, in what sense  
the decree in question will be explained, and to whai  
extent it will be carried into execution ; and conse­  
quently, whether in any case, the United States can  
be involved in questions concerning measures of re­  
taliation, supposed to accrue to one belligerent, from  
[suchaprocetding, by another. But it is worthy the  
  
just,re and the lib.-r.dily of tfl4 British government  
t«» lecoiU&#x27;t’T, th.:i witlnn t;*e priori of great  
events whirl, , online to agitate F.nrope, instances  
have occurred, ia which the commerce oi neutral  
nations, more especially of the l otted States has  
experienced the several distresses l.o.n its own or­  
•lers and measures, manifestly unauthorized by th*  
law oi nations. The aspect whirl, the United States

the enemies of Great-15, ttain, no fair objection can  
no aga&#x27;1,-,1 it, provided it be founded on, and enfurc­  
eo by,actual blockades as authorized!) the law of  
nations. If, on the other hand, the order has a re­  
ference, not to such a blockade, but to a supposed  
illegality of the neutral trade from one to another  
ol the desenoed ports, tl»e remark is obvious, that  
on that suppos t;on, the order is superfluoos; the  
trade being as interdicted by the law of nations,  
liable at all times, without any sach order, to the

whether, in any case, the United States can be  
involved in questions concerning measures of re­

worthy the justice and liberality of the British !  
government, to re collect, that, within the period  
of those great events, which continue to agitate  
Europe, instances have occurred, in which the  
commerce of neutral nations, more especially of:

i acquiescence on their pirt, will rrndei  
I them accessory to the proceedings o  
1 uue belligerent nation, through thtii  
  
rights of neutrality, against the com­  
merce of its adversary.  
With regard to the particular order  
issued againct the trade of neutrals  
from one port to another of the ene­  
mies of Great Britain, no fair objec­  
tion can lie against it, provided it be  
founded on, and enforced by actual  
blockades as authorized by the law of  
nations. If,on the other hand, the or­  
der has a reference, uot to such a Lloi k­  
ade, but a supposed illegality of the  
neutral trade Irom one to another of  
tiie described ports, the remark is ob­  
vious that on that supposition, the or­  
der is superfluous ; the trade being,  
is interdicted by the law of nations,  
liable at all times, without my such  
irder, to the capture of I3riti .li cruiz­  
;rs and the condemnation o! British  
courts; and if not interdicted as such  
i)r the law of nations, it can no other­  
wise be made illegal, than by a legal  
dock tide of the ports comprehended  
in the order. This inference is appli­  
cable even to the case oi a neutral trade  
&gt;etweeti tile ports of France herself;  
hnce it is not a principle of the ac­  
knowledge 1 law of nations, that neu­  
trals may not trade from one to ano­  
ther port of the same bel igerent nation.  
Ami it would be an innovation on that  
law, not before attempted, to extend  
tae principle to a tieutial trade between  
ports ol different countries confessed­  
ly open in times of peace as well as ol  
vir »t­  
  
It the liritish order refers for its ba­  
sis, to the principle of retaliation a­  
, ainst the French decrees, it fails un­  
der the observations already made on  
that subject, and which need not be  
repeated.

which the commerce of neutral aationa, more  
especially of the United States, has experi­  
enced the severest distresses from its own or  
ders and measures, manifestly unauthorized  
by the law of nation. The respect which  
the United States owe to their neutral rights,,  
and the interest they have in maintaining  
them, will always be sufficient pledges, that

With regard to the particular order issued  
against the trade nf neutrals from one part  
to another of the enemies of Great-Britain,  
no fair objection can lie against it, provided

is obvious,&#x27; that on that supposition, the or­

terdicted by the law of nations, liable at all  
times, without any such order, to thejcap-;  
tore of British cruisers and the condemnation  
of British courts r and if not Interdicted at  
  
such by .the law of niticm, it cannot other­  
wise be made illegal, than by a legal blockade  
of, the ports comprehended in the order.  
This blcrem e is applicablo even to the case
