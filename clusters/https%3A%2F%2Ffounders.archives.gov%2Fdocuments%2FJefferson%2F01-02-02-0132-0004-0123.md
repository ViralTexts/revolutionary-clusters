When the goods and chattels, taken in execution by virtue of a fieri facias, shall not be sufficient to satisfy the debt, damages, and costs, and the owner shall not have given such bond with security as aforesaid, for payment thereof, the sheriff or other officer shall, after the expiration of five days from the seizure, give public notice, in the manner before directed, both at the churches, and also at the court-house of his county, on the next court-day, and shall moreover give notice to the owner, if he be in the county, or otherwise to his agent, if any such be known, that at some time appointed in the notice, not less than ninety nor more than ninety-six days from the end of the said five days, the said lands, tenements, and hereditaments, will be exposed to sale by auction, on the premises, or at such  other place, in the same county, as the owner shall, by writing under his hand delivered to the officer, direct.

sale under execution, and that, under the statutes of Missouri,  
the sheriff’s deed was effectual in passing to the purchaser all  
the estate and interest which the debtor had at the time of the  
judgment. And the court used this language: “ Under the  
view we have taken of the sheriff’s deed, and the force and  
effect we have given to it, the title is in the defendants, and  
the judgment will be affirmed. This result as to the effect of  
the sheriff&#x27;s deed rendered it unnecessary to pass upon the  
other question presented by the record, but we have ruled  
upon them in order that there may be no embarrassment to  
either party in a review of this judgment in the Supreme  
Court of the United States.
