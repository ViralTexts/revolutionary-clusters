can printer the document, “which I have at last procured with great Difficulty, and with some Expense.” He added that he had generally inserted in the margins the name of the questioner “and where doubtful, whether he was a Friend or an Enemy.”  
Strahan stressed to the Philadelphia printer the effect of Franklin’s testimony: “To this very Examination, more than to any thing else, you are indebted to the speedy and total Repeal of this odious Law. The Marquis of Rockingham [first lord of the Treasury] told a friend of mine a few Days after, That he never knew Truth make so great a Progress in so very short a Time. From that very Day, the Repeal was generally and absolutely determined, all that passed afterwards being only mere Form, which even in Business the most urgent must always be regarded. Happy Man! In Truth, I almost envy him the inward Pleasure, as well as the outward Fame, he must derive from having it in his Power to do his Country such eminent and seasonable Service.”  
Strahan’s enthusiasm may be explained in part by his warm friendship for Franklin and also by the hope he expressed to Hall that this “Proof of his Patriotism” would “forever silence his Enemies with you.”

The EXAMINATION of Doctor BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, before an August Assembly, relating to the Repeal of the STAMP-ACT, &amp;c.  
[1] Q. What is your name, and place of abode?  
A. Franklin, of Philadelphia.  
[2] Q. Do the Americans pay any considerable taxes among themselves?  
  
A. Certainly many, and very heavy taxes.  
[3] Q. What are the present taxes in Pennsylvania, laid by the laws of the colony?  
A. There are taxes on all estates real and personal, a poll tax, a tax on all offices, professions, trades and businesses, according to their profits; an excise on all wine, rum, and other spirits; and a duty of Ten Pounds per head on all Negroes imported, with some other duties.  
[4] Q. For what purposes are those taxes laid?  
A. For the support of the civil and military establishments of the country, and to discharge the heavy debt contracted in the last war.  
[5] Q. How long are those taxes to continue?  
A. Those for discharging the debt are to continue till 1772, and longer, if the debt should not be then all discharged. The others must always continue.  
[6] Q. Was it not expected that the debt would have been sooner discharged?  
A. It was, when the peace was made with France and Spain— But a fresh war breaking out with the Indians, a fresh load of debt was incurred, and the taxes, of course, continued longer by a new law.  
[7] Q. Are not all the people very able to pay those taxes?  
A. No. The frontier counties, all along the continent, having been frequently ravaged by the enemy, and greatly impoverished, are able to pay very little tax. And therefore, in consideration of their distresses, our late tax laws do expressly favour those counties, excusing the sufferers; and I suppose the same is done in other governments.  
[8] Q. Are not you concerned in the management of the Post-Office in America?  
  
A. Yes. I am Deputy Post-Master General of North-America.  
[9] Q. Don’t you think the distribution of stamps, by post, to all the inhabitants, very practicable, if there was no opposition?  
A. The posts only go along the sea coasts; they do not, except in a few instances, go back into the country; and if they did, sending for stamps by post would occasion an expence of postage, amounting, in many cases, to much more than that of the stamps themselves.  
[10] Q. Are you acquainted with Newfoundland?  
A. I never was there.  
[11] Q. Do you know whether there are any post roads on that island?  
A. I have heard that there are no roads at all; but that the communication between one settlement and another is by sea only.  
[12] Q. Can you disperse the stamps by post in Canada?  
A. There is only a post between Montreal and Quebec. The inhabitants live so scattered and remote from each other, in that vast country, that posts cannot be supported among them, and therefore they cannot get stamps per post. The English Colonies too, along the frontiers, are very thinly settled.  
[13] Q. From the thinness of the back settlements, would not the stamp-act be extreamly inconvenient to the inhabitants, if executed?  
A. To be sure it would; as many of the inhabitants could not get stamps when they had occasion for them, without taking long journeys, and spending perhaps Three or Four Pounds, that the Crown might get Sixpence.  
[14] Q. Are not the Colonies, from their circumstances, very able to pay the stamp duty?  
A. In my opinion, there is not gold and silver enough in the Colonies to pay the stamp duty for one year.  
[15] Q. Don’t you know that the money arising from the stamps was all to be laid out in America?  
A. I know it is appropriated by the act to the American service; but it will be spent in the conquered Colonies, where the soldiers are, not in the Colonies that pay it.  
[16] Q. Is there not a ballance of trade due from the Colonies where the troops are posted, that will bring back the money to the old colonies?  
A. I think not. I believe very little would come back. I know of no trade likely to bring it back. I think it would come from the Colonies where it was spent directly to England; for I have always observed, that in every Colony the more plenty the means of remittance to England, the more goods are sent for, and the more trade with England carried on.  
[17] Q. What number of white inhabitants do you think there are in Pennsylvania?  
A. I suppose there may be about 160,000.  
[18] Q. What number of them are Quakers?  
A. Perhaps a third.  
[19] Q. What number of Germans?  
A. Perhaps another third; but I cannot speak with certainty.  
[20] Q. Have any number of the Germans seen service, as soldiers, in Europe?  
  
A. Yes,—many of them, both in Europe and America.  
[21] Q. Are they as much dissatisfied with the stamp duty as the English?  
A. Yes, and more; and with reason, as their stamps are, in many cases, to be double.  
[22] Q. How many white men do you suppose there are in North-America?  
A. About 300,000, from sixteen to sixty years of age.  
[23] Q. What may be the amount of one year’s imports into Pennsylvania from Britain?  
A. I have been informed that our merchants compute the imports from Britain to be above 500,000 Pounds.  
[24] Q. What may be the amount of the produce of your province exported to Britain?  
A. It must be small, as we produce little that is wanted in Britain. I suppose it cannot exceed 40,000 Pounds.  
[25] Q. How then do you pay the ballance?  
A. The Ballance is paid by our produce carried to the West-Indies, and sold in our own islands, or to the French, Spaniards, Danes and Dutch; by the same carried to other colonies in North-America, as to New-England, Nova-Scotia, Newfoundland, Carolina and Georgia; by the same carried to different parts of Europe, as Spain, Portugal and Italy. In all which places we receive either money, bills of exchange, or commodities that suit for remittance to Britain; which, together with all the profits on the industry of our merchants and mariners, arising in those circuitous voyages, and the freights made by their ships, center finally in Britain, to discharge the ballance, and pay for British manufactures continually used in the province, or sold to foreigners by our traders.  
[26] Q. Have you heard of any difficulties lately laid on the Spanish trade?  
A. Yes, I have heard that it has been greatly obstructed by some new regulations, and by the English men of war and cutters stationed all along the coast in America.  
[27] Q. Do you think it right that America should be protected by this country, and pay no part of the expence?  
  
A. That is not the case. The Colonies raised, cloathed and paid, during the last war, near 25000 men, and spent many millions.  
[28] Q. Were you not reimbursed by parliament?  
A. We were only reimbursed what, in your opinion, we had advanced beyond our proportion, or beyond what might reasonably be expected from us; and it was a very small part of what we spent. Pennsylvania, in particular, disbursed about 500,000 Pounds, and the reimbursements, in the whole, did not exceed 60,000 Pounds.  
[29] Q. You have said that you pay heavy taxes in Pennsylvania; what do they amount to in the Pound?  
A. The tax on all estates, real and personal, is Eighteen Pence in the Pound, fully rated; and the tax on the profits of trades and professions, with other taxes, do, I suppose, make full Half a Crown in the Pound.  
[30] Q. Do you know any thing of the rate of exchange in Pennsylvania, and whether it has fallen lately?  
A. It is commonly from 170 to 175. I have heard that it has fallen lately from 175 to 162 and a half, owing, I suppose, to their lessening their orders for goods; and when their debts to this country are paid, I think the exchange will probably be at par.  
[31] Q. Do not you think the people of America would submit to pay the stamp duty, if it was moderated?  
A. No, never, unless compelled by force of arms.  
[32] Q. Are not the taxes in Pennsylvania laid on unequally, in order to burthen the English trade, particularly the tax on professions and business?  
A. It is not more burthensome in proportion than the tax on lands. It is intended, and supposed to take an equal proportion of profits.  
[33] Q. How is the assembly composed? Of what kinds of people are the members, landholders or traders?  
A. It is composed of landholders, merchants and artificers.  
  
[34] Q. Are not the majority landholders?  
A. I believe they are.  
[35] Q. Do not they, as much as possible, shift the tax off from the land, to ease that, and lay the burthen heavier on trade?  
A. I have never understood it so. I never heard such a thing suggested. And indeed an attempt of that kind could answer no purpose. The merchant or trader is always skilled in figures, and ready with his pen and ink. If unequal burthens are laid on his trade, he puts an additional price on his goods; and the consumers, who are chiefly landholders, finally pay the greatest part, if not the whole.  
[36] Q. What was the temper of America towards Great-Britain before the year 1763?  
A. The best in the world. They submitted willingly to the government of the Crown, and paid, in all their courts, obedience to acts of parliament. Numerous as the people are in the several old provinces, they cost you nothing in forts, citadels, garrisons or armies, to keep them in subjection. They were governed by this country at the expence only of a little pen, ink and paper. They were led by a thread. They had not only a respect, but an affection, for Great-Britain, for its laws, its customs and manners, and even a fondness for its fashions, that greatly increased the commerce. Natives of Britain were always treated with particular regard; to be an Old England-man was, of itself, a character of some respect, and gave a kind of rank among us.  
[37] Q. And what is their temper now?  
A. O, very much altered.  
[38] Q. Did you ever hear the authority of parliament to make laws for America questioned till lately?  
A. The authority of parliament was allowed to be valid in all laws, except such as should lay internal taxes. It was never disputed in laying duties to regulate commerce.  
[39] Q. In what proportion hath population increased in America?  
A. I think the inhabitants of all the provinces together, taken at a medium, double in about 25 years. But their demand for British manufactures increases much faster, as the consumption is not merely in proportion to their numbers, but grows with the growing abilities of the same numbers to pay for them. In 1723, the whole importation from Britain to Pennsylvania, was but about 15,000 Pounds Sterling; it is now near Half a Million.  
[40] Q. In what light did the people of America use to consider the parliament of Great-Britain?  
A. They considered the parliament as the great bulwark and security of their liberties and privileges, and always spoke of it with the utmost respect and veneration. Arbitrary ministers, they thought, might possibly, at times, attempt to oppress them; but they relied on it, that the parliament, on application, would always give redress. They remembered, with gratitude, a strong instance of this, when a bill was brought into parliament, with a clause to make royal instructions laws in the Colonies, which the house of commons would not pass, and it was thrown out.  
[41] Q. And have they not still the same respect for parliament?  
A. No; it is greatly lessened.  
[42] Q. To what causes is that owing?  
A. To a concurrence of causes; the restraints lately laid on their trade, by which the bringing of foreign gold and silver into the Colonies was prevented; the prohibition of making paper money among themselves; and then demanding a new and heavy tax by stamps; taking away, at the same time, trials by juries, and refusing to receive and hear their humble petitions.  
[43] Q. Don’t you think they would submit to the stamp-act, if it was modified, the obnoxious parts taken out, and the duty reduced to some particulars, of small moment?  
A. No; they will never submit to it.  
[44] Q. What do you think is the reason that the people of America increase faster than in England?  
A. Because they marry younger, and more generally.  
[45] Q. Why so?  
A. Because any young couple that are industrious, may easily obtain land of their own, on which they can raise a family.  
  
[46] Q. Are not the lower rank of people more at their ease in America than in England?  
A. They may be so, if they are sober and diligent, as they are better paid for their labour.  
[47] Q. What is your opinion of a future tax, imposed on the same principle with that of the stamp-act; how would the Americans receive it?  
A. Just as they do this. They would not pay it.  
[48] Q. Have you not heard of the resolutions of this house, and of the house of lords, asserting the right of parliament relating to America, including a power to tax the people there?  
A. Yes, I have heard of such resolutions.  
[49] Q. What will be the opinion of the Americans on those resolutions?  
A. They will think them unconstitutional, and unjust.  
[50] Q. Was it an opinion in America before 1763, that the parliament had no right to lay taxes and duties there?  
A. I never heard any objection to the right of laying duties to regulate commerce; but a right to lay internal taxes was never supposed to be in parliament, as we are not represented there.  
[51] Q. On what do you found your opinion, that the people in America made any such distinction?  
A. I know that whenever the subject has occurred in conversation where I have been present, it has appeared to be the opinion of every one, that we could not be taxed in a parliament where we were not represented. But the payment of duties laid by act of parliament, as regulations of commerce, was never disputed.  
[52] Q. But can you name any act of assembly, or public act of any of your governments, that made such distinction?  
A. I do not know that there was any; I think there was never an occasion to make any such act, till now that you have attempted to tax us; that has occasioned resolutions of assembly, declaring the distinction, in which I think every assembly on the continent, and every member in every assembly, have been unanimous.  
[53] Q. What then could occasion conversations on that subject before that time?  
  
A. There was in 1754 a proposition made (I think it came from hence) that in case of a war, which was then apprehended, the governors of the Colonies should meet, and order the levying of troops, building of forts, and taking every other necessary measure for the general defence; and should draw on the treasury here for the sums expended, which were afterwards to be raised in the Colonies by a general tax, to be laid on them by act of parliament. This occasioned a good deal of conversation on the subject, and the general opinion was, that the parliament neither would nor could lay any tax on us, till we were duly represented in parliament, because it was not just, nor agreeable to the nature of an English constitution.  
[54] Q. Don’t you know there was a time in New-York, when it was under consideration to make an application to parliament to lay taxes on that Colony, upon a deficiency arising from the assembly’s refusing or neglecting to raise the necessary supplies for the support of the civil government?  
A. I never heard of it.  
[55] Q. There was such an application under consideration in New-York; and do you apprehend they could suppose the right of parliament to lay a tax in America was only local, and confined to the case of a deficiency in a particular Colony, by a refusal of its assembly to raise the necessary supplies?  
A. They could not suppose such a case, as that the assembly would not raise the necessary supplies to support its own government. An assembly that would refuse it must want common sense, which cannot be supposed. I think there was never any such case at New-York, and that it must be a misrepresentation, or the fact must be misunderstood. I know there have been some attempts, by ministerial instructions from hence, to oblige the assemblies to settle permanent salaries on governors, which they wisely refused to do; but I believe no assembly of New-York, or any other Colony, ever refused duly to support government by proper allowances, from time to time, to public officers.  
[56] Q. But in case a governor, acting by instruction, should call on an assembly to raise the necessary supplies, and the assembly should refuse to do it, do you not think it would then be for the good of the people of the colony, as well as necessary to government, that the parliament should tax them?  
A. I do not think it would be necessary. If an assembly could possibly be so absurd as to refuse raising the supplies requisite for the maintenance of government among them, they could not long remain in such a situation; the disorders and confusion occasioned by it must soon bring them to reason.  
[57] Q. If it should not, ought not the right to be in Great-Britain of applying a remedy?  
A. A right only to be used in such a case, I should have no objection to, supposing it to be used merely for the good of the people of the Colony.  
[58] Q. But who is to judge of that, Britain or the Colony?  
A. Those that feel can best judge.  
[59] Q. You say the Colonies have always submitted to external taxes, and object to the right of parliament only in laying internal taxes; now can you shew that there is any kind of difference between the two taxes to the Colony on which they may be laid?  
A. I think the difference is very great. An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost, and other charges on the commodity, and when it is offered to sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent, if not laid by their own representatives. The stamp-act says, we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry, nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums, and thus it is intended to extort our money from us, or ruin us by the consequences of refusing to pay it.  
[60] Q. But supposing the external tax or duty to be laid on the necessaries of life imported into your Colony, will not that be the same thing in its effects as an internal tax?  
A. I do not know a single article imported into the Northern Colonies, but what they can either do without, or make themselves.  
[61] Q. Don’t you think cloth from England absolutely necessary to them?  
A. No, by no means absolutely necessary; with industry and good management, they may very well supply themselves with all they want.  
[62] Q. Will it not take a long time to establish that manufacture among them? and must they not in the mean while suffer greatly?  
A. I think not. They have made a surprising progress already. And I am of opinion, that before their old clothes are worn out, they will have new ones of their own making.  
[63] Q. Can they possibly find wool enough in North-America?  
A. They have taken steps to increase the wool. They entered into general combinations to eat no more lamb, and very few lambs were killed last year. This course persisted in, will soon make a prodigious difference in the quantity of wool. And the establishing of great manufactories, like those in the clothing towns here, is not necessary, as it is where the business is to be carried on for the purposes of trade. The people will all spin, and work for themselves, in their own houses.  
[64] Q. Can there be wool and manufacture enough in one or two years?  
A. In three years, I think, there may.  
[65] Q. Does not the severity of the winter, in the Northern Colonies, occasion the wool to be of bad quality?  
A. No; the wool is very fine and good.  
[66] Q. In the more Southern Colonies, as in Virginia; don’t you know that the wool is coarse, and only a kind of hair?  
A. I don’t know it. I never heard it. Yet I have been sometimes in Virginia. I cannot say I ever took particular notice of the wool there, but I believe it is good, though I cannot speak positively of it; but Virginia, and the Colonies south of it, have less occasion for wool; their winters are short, and not very severe, and they can very well clothe themselves with linen and cotton of their own raising for the rest of the year.  
  
[67] Q. Are not the people, in the more Northern Colonies, obliged to fodder their sheep all the winter?  
A. In some of the most Northern Colonies they may be obliged to do it some part of the winter.  
[68] Q. Considering the resolutions of parliament, as to the right, do you think, if the stamp-act is repealed, that the North Americans will be satisfied?  
A. I believe they will.  
[69] Q. Why do you think so?  
A. I think the resolutions of right will give them very little concern, if they are never attempted to be carried into practice. The Colonies will probably consider themselves in the same situation, in that respect, with Ireland; they know you claim the same right with regard to Ireland, but you never exercise it. And they may believe you never will exercise it in the Colonies, any more than in Ireland, unless on some very extraordinary occasion.  
[70] Q. But who are to be the judges of that extraordinary occasion? Is it not the parliament?  
A. Though the parliament may judge of the occasion, the people will think it can never exercise such right, till representatives from the Colonies are admitted into parliament, and that whenever the occasion arises, representatives will be ordered.  
[71] Q. Did you never hear that Maryland, during the last war, had refused to furnish a quota towards the common defence?  
A. Maryland has been much misrepresented in that matter. Maryland, to my knowledge, never refused to contribute, or grant aids to the Crown. The assemblies every year, during the war, voted considerable sums, and formed bills to raise them. The bills were, according to the constitution of that province, sent up to the council, or upper house, for concurrence, that they might be presented to the governor, in order to be enacted into laws. Unhappy disputes between the two houses arising, from the defects of that constitution principally, rendered all the bills but one or two abortive. The proprietary’s council rejected them. It is true Maryland did not contribute its proportion, but it was, in my opinion, the fault of the government, not of the people.  
[72] Q. Was it not talked of in the other provinces as a proper measure to apply to parliament to compel them?  
A. I have heard such discourse; but as it was well known, that the people were not to blame, no such application was ever made, nor any step taken towards it.  
[73] Q. Was it not proposed at a public meeting?  
A. Not that I know of.  
[74] Q. Do you remember the abolishing of the paper currency in New England, by act of assembly?  
A. I do remember its being abolished, in the Massachusett’s Bay.  
[75] Q. Was not Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson principally concerned in that transaction?  
A. I have heard so.  
[76] Q. Was it not at that time a very unpopular law?  
A. I believe it might, though I can say little about it, as I lived at a distance from that province.  
[77] Q. Was not the scarcity of gold and silver an argument used against abolishing the paper?  
A. I suppose it was.  
[78] Q. What is the present opinion there of that law? Is it as unpopular as it was at first?  
A. I think it is not.  
[79] Q. Have not instructions from hence been sometimes sent over to governors, highly oppressive and unpolitical?  
A. Yes.  
[80] Q. Have not some governors dispensed with them for that reason?  
A. Yes, I have heard so.  
[81] Q. Did the Americans ever dispute the controling power of parliament to regulate the commerce?  
A. No.  
[82] Q. Can any thing less than a military force carry the stamp-act into execution?  
A. I do not see how a military force can be applied to that purpose.  
[83] Q. Why may it not?  
A. Suppose a military force sent into America, they will find nobody in arms; what are they then to do? They cannot force a man to take stamps who chooses to do without them. They will not find a rebellion; they may indeed make one.  
  
[84] Q. If the act is not repealed, what do you think will be the consequences?  
A. A total loss of the respect and affection the people of America bear to this country, and of all the commerce that depends on that respect and affection.  
[85] Q. How can the commerce be affected?  
A. You will find, that if the act is not repealed, they will take very little of your manufactures in a short time.  
[86] Q. Is it in their power to do without them?  
A. I think they may very well do without them.  
[87] Q. Is it their interest not to take them?  
A. The goods they take from Britain are either necessaries, mere conveniences, or superfluities. The first, as cloth, &amp;c. with a little industry they can make at home; the second they can do without, till they are able to provide them among themselves; and the last, which are much the greatest part, they will strike off immediately. They are mere articles of fashion, purchased and consumed, because the fashion in a respected country, but will now be detested and rejected. The people have already struck off, by general agreement, the use of all goods fashionable in mournings, and many thousand pounds worth are sent back as unsaleable.  
[88] Q. Is it their interest to make cloth at home?  
A. I think they may at present get it cheaper from Britain, I mean of the same fineness and neatness of workmanship; but when one considers other circumstances, the restraints on their trade, and the difficulty of making remittances, it is their interest to make every thing.  
[89] Q. Suppose an act of internal regulations, connected with a tax, how would they receive it?  
A. I think it would be objected to.  
[90] Q. Then no regulation with a tax would be submitted to?  
A. Their opinion is, that when aids to the Crown are wanted, they are to be asked of the several assemblies, according to the old established usage, who will, as they always have done, grant them freely. And that their money ought not to be given away without their consent, by persons at a distance, unacquainted with their circumstances and abilities. The granting aids to the Crown, is the only means they have of recommending themselves to their sovereign, and they think it extremely hard and unjust, that a body of men, in which they have no representatives, should make a merit to itself of giving and granting what is not its own, but theirs, and deprive them of a right they esteem of the utmost value and importance, as it is the security of all their other rights.  
[91] Q. But is not the post-office, which they have long received, a tax as well as a regulation?  
A. No; the money paid for the postage of a letter is not of the nature of a tax; it is merely a quantum meruit for a service done; no person is compellable to pay the money, if he does not chuse to receive the service. A man may still, as before the act, send his letter by a servant, a special messenger, or a friend, if he thinks it cheaper and safer.  
[92] Q. But do they not consider the regulations of the postoffice, by the act of last year, as a tax?  
A. By the regulations of last year the rate of postage was generally abated near thirty per cent. through all America; they certainly cannot consider such abatement as a tax.  
[93] Q. If an excise was laid by parliament, which they might likewise avoid paying, by not consuming the articles excised, would they then not object to it?  
A. They would certainly object to it, as an excise is unconnected with any service done, and is merely an aid which they think ought to be asked of them, and granted by them, if they are to pay it, and can be granted for them by no others whatsoever, whom they have not impowered for that purpose.  
[94] Q. You say they do not object to the right of parliament in laying duties on goods to be paid on their importation; now, is there any kind of difference between a duty on the importation of goods, and an excise on their consumption?  
A. Yes; a very material one; an excise, for the reasons I have just mentioned, they think you can have no right to lay within their country. But the sea is yours; you maintain, by your fleets, the safety of navigation in it; and keep it clear of pirates; you may have therefore a natural and equitable right to some toll or duty on merchandizes carried through that part of your dominions, towards defraying the expence you are at in ships to maintain the safety of that carriage.  
[95] Q. Does this reasoning hold in the case of a duty laid on the produce of their lands exported? And would they not then object to such a duty?  
A. If it tended to make the produce so much dearer abroad as to lessen the demand for it, to be sure they would object to such a duty; not to your right of laying it, but they would complain of it as a burthen, and petition you to lighten it.  
[96] Q. Is not the duty paid on the tobacco exported a duty of that kind?  
A. That, I think, is only on tobacco carried coastwise from one Colony to another, and appropriated as a fund for supporting the college at Williamsburgh, in Virginia.  
[97] Q. Have not the assemblies in the West-Indies the same natural rights with those in North America?  
A. Undoubtedly.  
[98] Q. And is there not a tax laid there on their sugars exported?  
A. I am not much acquainted with the West-Indies, but the duty of four and a half per cent. on sugars exported, was, I believe, granted by their own assemblies.  
[99] Q. How much is the poll-tax in your province laid on unmarried men?  
A. It is, I think, Fifteen Shillings, to be paid by every single freeman, upwards of twenty-one years old.  
[100] Q. What is the annual amount of all the taxes in Pennsylvania?  
A. I suppose about 20,000 Pounds sterling.  
[101] Q. Supposing the stamp-act continued, and enforced, do you imagine that ill humour will induce the Americans to give as much for worse manufactures of their own, and use them, preferably to better of ours?  
  
A. Yes, I think so. People will pay as freely to gratify one passion as another, their resentment as their pride.  
[102] Q. Would the people at Boston discontinue their trade?  
A. The merchants are a very small number, compared with the body of the people, and must discontinue their trade, if nobody will buy their goods.  
[103] Q. What are the body of the people in the Colonies?  
A. They are farmers, husbandmen or planters.  
[104] Q. Would they suffer the produce of their lands to rot?  
A. No; but they would not raise so much. They would manufacture more, and plough less.  
[105] Q. Would they live without the administration of justice in civil matters, and suffer all the inconveniences of such a situation for any considerable time, rather than take the stamps, supposing the stamps were protected by a sufficient force, where every one might have them?  
A. I think the supposition impracticable, that the stamps should be so protected as that every one might have them. The act requires sub-distributors to be appointed in every county town, district and village, and they would be necessary. But the principal distributors, who were to have had a considerable profit on the whole, have not thought it worth while to continue in the office, and I think it impossible to find sub-distributors fit to be trusted, who, for the trifling profit that must come to their share, would incur the odium, and run the hazard that would attend it; and if they could be found, I think it impracticable to protect the stamps in so many distant and remote places.  
[106] Q. But in places where they could be protected, would not the people use them rather than remain in such a situation, unable to obtain any right, or recover, by law, any debt?  
A. It is hard to say what they would do. I can only judge what other people will think, and how they will act, by what I feel within myself. I have a great many debts due to me in America, and I had rather they should remain unrecoverable by any law, than submit to the stamp-act. They will be debts of honour. It is my opinion the people will either continue in that situation, or find some way to extricate themselves, perhaps by generally agreeing to proceed in the courts without stamps.  
  
[107] Q. What do you think a sufficient military force to protect the distribution of the stamps in every part of America?  
A. A very great force; I can’t say what, if the disposition of America is for a general resistance.  
[108] Q. What is the number of men in America able to bear arms, or of disciplined militia?  
A. There are, I suppose, at least—[Question objected to. He withdrew. Called in again.]  
[109] Q. Is the American stamp-act an equal tax on that country?  
A. I think not.  
[110] Q. Why so?  
A. The greatest part of the money must arise from law suits for the recovery of debts, and be paid by the lower sort of people, who were too poor easily to pay their debts. It is therefore a heavy tax on the poor, and a tax upon them for being poor.  
[111] Q. But will not this increase of expence be a means of lessening the number of law suits?  
A. I think not; for as the costs all fall upon the debtor, and are to be paid by him, they would be no discouragement to the creditor to bring his action.  
[112] Q. Would it not have the effect of excessive usury?  
A. Yes, as an oppression of the debtor.  
[113] Q. How many ships are there laden annually in North-America with flax-seed for Ireland?  
A. I cannot speak to the number of ships, but I know that in 1752, 10,000 hogsheads of flax-seed, each containing 7 bushels, were exported from Philadelphia to Ireland. I suppose the quantity is greatly increased since that time; and it is understood that the exportation from New York is equal to that from Philadelphia.  
[114] Q. What becomes of the flax that grows with that flax-seed?  
A. They manufacture some into coarse, and some into a middling kind of linen.  
[115] Q. Are there any slitting mills in America?  
  
A. I think there are, but I believe only one at present employed. I suppose they will all be set to work, if the interruption of the trade continues.  
[116] Q. Are there any fulling mills there?  
A. A great many.  
[117] Q. Did you never hear that a great quantity of stockings were contracted for for the army, during the war, and manufactured in Philadelphia?  
A. I have heard so.  
[118] Q. If the stamp act should be repealed, would not the Americans think they could oblige the parliament to repeal every external tax law now in force?  
A. It is hard to answer questions of what people at such a distance will think.  
[119] Q. But what do you imagine they will think were the motives of repealing the act?  
A. I suppose they will think that it was repealed from a conviction of its inexpediency; and they will rely upon it, that while the same inexpediency subsists, you will never attempt to make such another.  
[120] Q. What do you mean by its inexpediency?  
A. I mean its inexpediency on several accounts; the poverty and inability of those who were to pay the tax; the general discontent it has occasioned; and the impracticability of enforcing it.  
[121] Q. If the act should be repealed, and the legislature should shew its resentment to the opposers of the stamp-act, would the Colonies acquiesce in the authority of the legislature? What is your opinion they would do?  
A. I don’t doubt at all, that if the legislature repeal the stamp-act, the Colonies will acquiesce in the authority.  
[122] Q. But if the legislature should think fit to ascertain its right to lay taxes, by any act laying a small tax, contrary to their opinion, would they submit to pay the tax?  
  
A. The proceedings of the people in America have been considered too much together. The proceedings of the assemblies have been very different from those of the mobs, and should be distinguished, as having no connection with each other. The assemblies have only peaceably resolved what they take to be their rights; they have taken no measures for opposition by force; they have not built a fort, raised a man, or provided a grain of ammunition, in order to such opposition. The ringleaders of riots they think ought to be punished; they would punish them themselves, if they could. Every sober sensible man would wish to see rioters punished; as otherwise peaceable people have no security of person or estate. But as to any internal tax, how small soever, laid by the legislature here on the people there, while they have no representatives in this legislature, I think it will never be submitted to. They will oppose it to the last. They do not consider it as at all necessary for you to raise money on them by your taxes, because they are, and always have been, ready to raise money by taxes among themselves, and to grant large sums, equal to their abilities, upon requisition from the Crown. They have not only granted equal to their abilities, but, during all the last war, they granted far beyond their abilities, and beyond their proportion with this country, you yourselves being judges, to the amount of many hundred thousand pounds, and this they did freely and readily, only on a sort of promise from the secretary of state, that it should be recommended to parliament to make them compensation. It was accordingly recommended to parliament, in the most honourable manner, for them. America has been greatly misrepresented and abused here, in papers, and pamphlets, and speeches, as ungrateful, and unreasonable, and unjust, in having put this nation to immense expence for their defence, and refusing to bear any part of that expence. The Colonies raised, paid and clothed, near 25000 men during the last war, a number equal to those sent from Britain, and far beyond their proportion; they went deeply into debt in doing this, and all their taxes and estates are mortgaged, for many years to come, for discharging that debt. Government here was at that time very sensible of this. The Colonies were recommended to parliament. Every year the King sent down to the house a written message to this purpose, That his Majesty, being highly sensible of the zeal and vigour with which his faithful subjects in North-America had exerted themselves, in defence of his Majesty’s just rights and possessions, recommended it to the house to take the same into consideration, and enable him to give them a proper compensation. You will find those messages on your own journals every year of the war to the very last, and you did accordingly give 200,000 Pounds annually to the Crown, to be distributed in such compensation to the Colonies. This is the strongest of all proofs that the Colonies, far from being unwilling to bear a share of the burthen, did exceed their proportion; for if they had done less, or had only equalled their proportion, there would have been no room or reason for compensation. Indeed the sums reimbursed them, were by no means adequate to the expence they incurred beyond their proportion; but they never murmured at that; they esteemed their Sovereign’s approbation of their zeal and fidelity, and the approbation of this house, far beyond any other kind of compensation; therefore there was no occasion for this act, to force money from a willing people; they had not refused giving money for the purposes of the act; no requisition had been made; they were always willing and ready to do what could reasonably be expected from them, and in this light they wish to be considered.  
[123] Q. But suppose Great-Britain should be engaged in a war in Europe, would North-America contribute to the support of it?  
A. I do think they would, as far as their circumstances would permit. They consider themselves as a part of the British empire, and as having one common interest with it; they may be looked on here as foreigners, but they do not consider themselves as such. They are zealous for the honour and prosperity of this nation, and, while they are well used, will always be ready to support it, as far as their little power goes. In 1739 they were called upon to assist in the expedition against Carthagena, and they sent 3000 men to join your army. It is true Carthagena is in America, but as remote from the Northern Colonies, as if it had been in Europe. They make no distinction of wars, as to their duty of assisting in them. I know the last war is commonly spoke of here as entered into for the defence, or for the sake of the people of America. I think it is quite misunderstood. It began about the limits between Canada and Nova-Scotia, about territories to which the Crown indeed laid claim, but were not claimed by any British Colony; none of the lands had been granted to any Colonist; we had therefore no particular concern or interest in that dispute. As to the Ohio, the contest there began about your right of trading in the Indian country, a right you had by the treaty of Utrecht, which the French infringed; they seized the traders and their goods, which were your manufactures; they took a fort which a company of your merchants, and their factors and correspondents, had erected there, to secure that trade. Braddock was sent with an army to re-take that fort (which was looked on here as another incroachment on the King’s territory) and to protect your trade. It was not till after his defeat that the Colonies were attacked. They were before in perfect peace with both French and Indians; the troops were not therefore sent for their defence. The trade with the Indians, though carried on in America, is not an American interest. The people of America are chiefly farmers and planters; scarce any thing that they raise or produce is an article of commerce with the Indians. The Indian trade is a British interest; it is carried on with British manufactures, for the profit of British merchants and manufacturers; therefore the war, as it commenced for the defence of territories of the Crown, the property of no American, and for the defence of a trade purely British, was really a British war—and yet the people of America made no scruple of contributing their utmost towards carrying it on, and bringing it to a happy conclusion.  
[124] Q. Do you think then that the taking possession of the King’s territorial rights, and strengthening the frontiers, is not an American interest?  
A. Not particularly, but conjointly a British and an American interest.  
[125] Q. You will not deny that the preceding war, the war with Spain, was entered into for the sake of America; was it not occasioned by captures made in the American seas?  
A. Yes; captures of ships carrying on the British trade there, with British manufactures.  
[126] Q. Was not the late war with the Indians, since the peace with France, a war for America only?  
A. Yes; it was more particularly for America than the former, but it was rather a consequence or remains of the former war, the Indians not having been thoroughly pacified, and the Americans bore by much the greatest share of the expence. It was put an end to by the army under General Bouquet; there were not above 300 regulars in that army, and above 1000 Pennsylvanians.  
[127] Q. Is it not necessary to send troops to America, to defend the Americans against the Indians?  
A. No, by no means; it never was necessary. They defended themselves when they were but an handful, and the Indians much more numerous. They continually gained ground, and have driven the Indians over the mountains, without any troops sent to their assistance from this country. And can it be thought necessary now to send troops for their defence from those diminished Indian tribes, when the Colonies are become so populous, and so strong? There is not the least occasion for it; they are very able to defend themselves.  
[128] Q. Do you say there were no more than 300 regular troops employed in the late Indian war?  
A. Not on the Ohio, or the frontiers of Pennsylvania, which was the chief part of the war that affected the Colonies. There were garrisons at Niagara, Fort Detroit, and those remote posts kept for the sake of your trade; I did not reckon them, but I believe that on the whole the number of Americans, or provincial troops, employed in the war, was greater than that of the regulars. I am not certain, but I think so.  
[129] Q. Do you think the assemblies have a right to levy money on the subject there, to grant to the Crown?  
A. I certainly think so; they have always done it.  
[130] Q. Are they acquainted with the declaration of rights? And do they know that, by that statute, money is not to be raised on the subject but by consent of parliament?  
  
A. They are very well acquainted with it.  
[131] Q. How then can they think they have a right to levy money for the Crown, or for any other than local purposes?  
A. They understand that clause to relate to subjects only within the realm; that no money can be levied on them for the Crown, but by consent of parliament. The Colonies are not supposed to be within the realm; they have assemblies of their own, which are their parliaments, and they are in that respect, in the same situation with Ireland. When money is to be raised for the Crown upon the subject in Ireland, or in the Colonies, the consent is given in the parliament of Ireland, or in the assemblies of the Colonies. They think the parliament of Great-Britain cannot properly give that consent till it has representatives from America; for the petition of right expressly says, it is to be by common consent in parliament, and the people of America have no representatives in parliament, to make a part of that common consent.  
[132] Q. If the stamp-act should be repealed, and an act should pass, ordering the assemblies of the Colonies to indemnify the sufferers by the riots, would they obey it?  
A. That is a question I cannot answer.  
[133] Q. Suppose the King should require the Colonies to grant a revenue, and the parliament should be against their doing it, do they think they can grant a revenue to the King, without the consent of the parliament of G. Britain?  
A. That is a deep question. As to my own opinion, I should think myself at liberty to do it, and should do it, if I liked the occasion.  
[134] Q. When money has been raised in the Colonies, upon requisitions, has it not been granted to the King?  
A. Yes, always; but the requisitions have generally been for some service expressed, as to raise, clothe and pay troops, and not for money only.  
[135] Q. If the act should pass, requiring the American assemblies to make compensation to the sufferers, and they should disobey it, and then the parliament should, by another act, lay an internal tax, would they then obey it?  
A. The people will pay no internal tax; and I think an act to oblige the assemblies to make compensation is unnecessary, for I am of opinion, that as soon as the present heats are abated, they will take the matter into consideration, and, if it is right to be done, they will do it of themselves.  
[136] Q. Do not letters often come into the post-offices in America, directed to some inland town where no post goes?  
A. Yes.  
[137] Q. Can any private person take up those letters, and carry them as directed?  
A. Yes; any friend of the person may do it, paying the postage that has occurred.  
[138] Q. But must he not pay an additional postage for the distance to such inland town?  
A. No.  
[139] Q. Can the post-master answer delivering the letter, without being paid such additional postage?  
A. Certainly he can demand nothing, where he does no service.  
[140] Q. Suppose a person, being far from home, finds a letter in a post-office directed to him, and he lives in a place to which the post generally goes, and the letter is directed to that place, will the post-master deliver him the letter, without his paying the postage receivable at the place to which the letter is directed?  
A. Yes; the office cannot demand postage for a letter that it does not carry, or farther than it does carry it.  
[141] Q. Are not ferrymen in America obliged, by act of parliament, to carry over the posts without pay?  
A. Yes.  
[142] Q. Is not this a tax on the ferrymen?  
A. They do not consider it as such, as they have an advantage from persons travelling with the post.  
[143] Q. If the stamp-act should be repealed, and the Crown should make a requisition to the Colonies for a sum of money, would they grant it?  
A. I believe they would.  
  
[144] Q. Why do you think so?  
A. I can speak for the Colony I live in; I had it in instruction from the assembly to assure the ministry, that as they always had done, so they should always think it their duty to grant such aids to the Crown as were suitable to their circumstances and abilities, whenever called upon for the purpose, in the usual constitutional manner; and I had the honour of communicating this instruction to that honourable gentleman then minister.  
[145] Q. Would they do this for a British concern; as suppose a war in some part of Europe, that did not affect them?  
A. Yes, for any thing that concerned the general interest. They consider themselves as a part of the whole.  
[146] Q. What is the usual constitutional manner of calling on the Colonies for aids?  
A. A letter from the secretary of state.  
[147] Q. Is this all you mean, a letter from the secretary of state?  
A. I mean the usual way of requisition, in a circular letter from the secretary of state, by his Majesty’s command, reciting the occasion, and recommending it to the Colonies to grant such aids as became their loyalty, and were suitable to their abilities.  
[148] Q. Did the secretary of state ever write for money for the Crown?  
A. The requisitions have been to raise, clothe and pay men, which cannot be done without money.  
[149] Q. Would they grant money alone, if called on?  
A. In my opinion they would, money as well as men, when they have money, or can make it.  
[150] Q. If the parliament should repeal the stamp-act, will the assembly of Pennsylvania rescind their resolutions?  
A. I think not.  
[151] Q. Before there was any thought of the stamp-act, did they wish for a representation in parliament?  
A. No.  
[152] Q. Don’t you know that there is, in the Pennsylvania charter, an express reservation of the right of parliament to lay taxes there?  
  
A. I know there is a clause in the charter, by which the King grants that he will levy no taxes on the inhabitants, unless it be with the consent of the assembly, or by act of parliament.  
[153] Q. How then could the assembly of Pennsylvania assert, that laying a tax on them by the stamp-act was an infringement of their rights?  
A. They understand it thus; by the same charter, and otherwise, they are intitled to all the privileges and liberties of Englishmen; they find in the great charters, and the petition and declaration of rights, that one of the privileges of English subjects is, that they are not to be taxed but by their common consent; they have therefore relied upon it, from the first settlement of the province, that the parliament never would, nor could, by colour of that clause in the charter, assume a right of taxing them, till it had qualified itself to exercise such right, by admitting representatives from the people to be taxed, who ought to make a part of that common consent.  
[154] Q. Are there any words in the charter that justify that construction?  
A. The common rights of Englishmen, as declared by Magna Charta, and the petition of right, all justify it.  
[155] Q. Does the distinction between internal and external taxes exist in the words of the charter?  
A. No, I believe not.  
[156] Q. Then may they not, by the same interpretation, object to the parliament’s right of external taxation?  
A. They never have hitherto. Many arguments have been lately used here to shew them that there is no difference, and that if you have no right to tax them internally, you have none to tax them externally, or make any other law to bind them. At present they do not reason so, but in time they may possibly be convinced by these arguments.  
[157] Q. Do not the resolutions of the Pennsylvania assembly say all taxes?  
A. If they do, they mean only internal taxes; the same words have not always the same meaning here and in the Colonies. By taxes they mean internal taxes; by duties they mean customs; these are their ideas of the language.  
  
[158] Q. Have you not seen the resolutions of the Massachusett’s Bay assembly?  
A. I have.  
[159] Q. Do they not say, that neither external nor internal taxes can be laid on them by parliament?  
A. I don’t know that they do; I believe not.  
[160] Q. If the same Colony should say neither tax nor imposition could be laid, does not that province hold the power of parliament can hold neither?  
A. I suppose that by the word imposition, they do not intend to express duties to be laid on goods imported, as regulations of commerce.  
[161] Q. What can the Colonies mean then by imposition as distinct from taxes?  
A. They may mean many things, as impressing of men, or of carriages, quartering troops on private houses, and the like; there may be great impositions, that are not properly taxes.  
[162] Q. Is not the post-office rate an internal tax laid by act of parliament?  
A. I have answered that.  
[163] Q. Are all parts of the Colonies equally able to pay taxes?  
A. No, certainly; the frontier parts, which have been ravaged by the enemy, are greatly disabled by that means, and therefore, in such cases, are usually favoured in our tax-laws.  
[164] Q. Can we, at this distance, be competent judges of what favours are necessary?  
A. The Parliament have supposed it, by claiming a right to make tax laws for America; I think it impossible.  
[165] Q. Would the repeal of the stamp-act be any discouragement of your manufactures? Will the people that have begun to manufacture decline it?  
A. Yes, I think they will; especially if, at the same time, the trade is opened again, so that remittances can be easily made. I have known several instances that make it probable. In the war before last, tobacco being low, and making little remittance, the people of Virginia went generally into family manufactures. Afterwards, when tobacco bore a better price, they returned to the use of British manufactures. So fulling mills were very much disused in the last war in Pennsylvania, because bills were then plenty, and remittances could easily be made to Britain for English cloth and other goods.  
[166] Q. If the stamp-act should be repealed, would it induce the assemblies of America to acknowledge the rights of parliament to tax them, and would they erase their resolutions?  
A. No, never.  
[167] Q. Is there no means of obliging them to erase those resolutions?  
A. None that I know of; they will never do it unless compelled by force of arms.  
[168] Q. Is there a power on earth that can force them to erase them?  
A. No power, how great soever, can force men to change their opinions.  
[169] Q. Do they consider the post-office as a tax, or as a regulation?  
A. Not as a tax, but as a regulation and conveniency; every assembly encouraged it, and supported it in its infancy, by grants of money, which they would not otherwise have done; and the people have always paid the postage.  
[170] Q. When did you receive the instructions you mentioned?  
A. I brought them with me, when I came to England, about 15 months since.  
[171] Q. When did you communicate that instruction to the minister?  
A. Soon after my arrival, while the stamping of America was under consideration, and before the bill was brought in.  
[172] Q. Would it be most for the interest of Great-Britain, to employ the hands of Virginia in tobacco, or in manufactures?  
  
A. In tobacco to be sure.  
[173] Q. What used to be the pride of the Americans?  
A. To indulge in the fashions and manufactures of Great-Britain.  
[174] Q. What is now their pride?  
A. To wear their old cloaths over again, till they can make new ones.  
Withdrew.  
The end.

? For what purpose are those taxes laid ?  
A. For ‘the support of the civil and rhilitary  
eftablithments of the country, and to discharge  
the hcar\;:ly debt contradted in the last war.  
9. How long are those taxes to continue,  
A. Those for discharging the debt are to con­  
tinue till 1772, and longer, if the-debt-{hould not  
then be all discharged. The others must always  
continue, &#x27; S  
9. Was it not expected that thie debt would  
have been sooner discharged ? &#x27;  
~ A. It was, when the peace was made&#x27; with  
- France and Spain—But a frefh war breaking out  
‘with the Indians, a frefh load of debt was incurred,  
-and the taxes of course continued longer by a  
new law. e . -  
9. Are not all the people very dble to pay  
those . taxes ? ‘  
A. No. The frontier counties; all along the  
continent, having been frequently ravished by the  
enemy, and greatly impoverithed, are able to pay  
very little tax. And therefore, in consideration  
of their diftrefles, our latetax laws do exprefly fa­  
vour those counties, excusing the fufferers : andl  
suppose the fame is done in .other governments.  
9. Are you notconcerned in the management  
of the Post Office in America ? _ :  
A. Yes.. lam Deputy Post Master General  
of North America. C TS ,  
9. Don’t you think the distribution of ffamps,  
by post; to all the inhabitants very. practicable, if  
there was no opposition ! Y  
&quot; A. The posts only go along the sea coafls ;  
they do not, exeept in a few instances, go back  
into the. country ;. and if they did, fending  
for framps by post would occasion an expence of  
, postage, amounting, in many cases, to much more  
thary that.of the stamps themf{elves. _  
9. Are you acquainted&#x27; with Newfoundland ?  
~~ A. I never was there. |  
9. Do you know whether there are any post  
roads on that island ? ; ot  
4. 1 have heard that.there are no roads at all;  
but that the communication between one settle­  
ment and another is by sea only. o e  
-8, Can you disperse the stamps by post in  
Canada ! . .  
. A. There is only a post between Montreal and  
Quebec:s The-inhabitants -live so scattered and  
remote from each other, in that vast country, that  
pasts cannot be supported among them, and there­  
fore:they cannot get stamps per post. The En­

9. Is the:~ not a ballance of trade due from  
the colonies where the troops are posted, that will

A. I think not. I believe very little would

it back. I think it would come from the colonies  
where it was spent direétly to England ; for I

A. Yes, I&#x27;have heard that it has been greatly  
obflruéted by some new regulations, and by the  
Englifb men of war ahd cutters stationed all along’  
the coast of America. &#x27; ; , ‘  
-9. Do youthink it right™ America should be  
prote&amp;ed by this country, and pay no part of the  
~QXp¢dce§ TN S iy &#x27;  
A. That s not the case, &#x27; The colonies raised,  
cloathed ‘and paid, during the last war, near 25,  
000 men, and spent many millions. * &lt;7  
9. Were you not reimbursed by parliament?  
A. We were reimbursed what, in your opipi­  
on, we had advanced beyond our proportion, or  
- beyond what might be reasonably expeéted from  
us; and it was avery small part of what we spent,  
Pennsylvania, in particular, disbursed about 500,  
oco pounds and the reirasburfements, in the whole,  
did not exceed 60,000 pounds, i e  
Q. You have said that you pay heavy taxes in  
Pennsylvania ; what do they amount to in the  
pound ? :  
A. The tax on all estates, real and personal, is  
eighteei pence in the pound, fully rated ; and  
the tax on the profits of trades and profeflions,  
with other taxes, do, I suppose, make full half  
a crown in the pound. -  
2. Do you kriow any thing of the rate of Ex­  
fhangeﬁ in Pennsylvania, and whether it has fallen  
ately X _  
A. Tt is comimonly from 170 to 175. 1 have  
heard that it has~fallen lately from 175 to-162  
and a half,owing, I fuppofe;totheir leflening theit  
orders for goods ; and when their debts to this  
country are paid, I think the exchange will pro«  
bably be at par. | ; i  
9.D0 not you think the people of America would  
{ submit to pay-the stamp-duty, if it was moderated.

| 9. Are not the taxes in Pehnfylvania laid on  
‘unequally, inl order ta burthen the Englith trade,  
‘particularly the tax on profeffions and business ?  
.~ A. It is not more burthenfome in proportion  
‘than the. tax on lands. = It is intended, and fup­  
.pofed to take an equal proportion of profits. -  
9. How is the assembly composed ?* Of what  
&#x27;kinds of people are the members, landholders or  
traders’ ! , et  
A. It is composed of landholders, merchants  
and artificers. :  
9, Are not the majority landholders ?  
A. 1 believe they are. :  
9. Do not they; as much as poflible, fhift the  
tax off from the land, to ease that, and lay the  
burthen heavier on trade ?-  
A’ 1 have .fieger understood it so. I never  
heard fuchk a thing fu&#x27;%eﬁed : and indeed an at­  
tempt of thdt kind could answer no purpose. The  
merchant or-trader is always skilled in fizures, and  
ready with hispen and ink. If unequal burthens  
are 13id on his trade, he puts an additional price  
on his gaods; and the consumers; who are chiefly  
la’ndhoﬁie‘rs, finally pay the greatest part, if not  
the whole, . ; !  
9. What was the temper of America towards  
Great Britain, before the year 1763 ?  
A. The best in the world. They submitted  
willingly to the government of the crown, and  
paid, in all their courts, obedience to acts of par­  
liament. Numerous ag the people are in the se­  
veral old provinces, &#x27;they cost you nothing .  
in forts, citadels, gdrrifons or ‘armies, to keep  
‘them in fubjeétion. They were governed by this  
‘countly at the expence only of a little pen, ink.  
and paper. They were led by a thread. They  
‘had not only. a refpe€t, ‘but an affeétion, for  
Great Britain, for its laws, its customs and man­  
ners, and even a fondnefs for its fafhions, that

tain were alw:gs treated with Particular regard ;  
to be an Old England man, was of itfclf, a char­  
alter of some respect, and gave a kind ‘of rank  
among us. :  
9. And what is their temper now ? :  
A. O, very much altered. ‘ .  
9. Did you ever hear the authority of parliament  
to grakc laws for America questioned ull lately ?  
. The authority of parliament was allow­  
ed to be valid in all laws, except, such as  
should lay internal taxes. It was never disputed  
in &#x27;]ayiﬁg duties to regulate commerce.  
9. In what proportion hath population increas­  
ed in America ? % e G A  
A. 1 think the inhabitants of all the provinces  
together, taken at a medium, double in about 25  
years. But their demand for Britith manufa&amp;ure  
increases much faftery as the consumption is not  
merely in proportion to their numbers, but grows  
with the growing abilities of the fame numbers  
to pay for them. In 1723, the whole importation  
from Britain to Pennsylvania, was but about 15,  
eool. sterling s it is now near halfa million  
9. In what light did the people of America  
use to confider the parliament of Great Britain ?  
A. They confideted the parliament as the great  
bulwark and security of their liberties and privi-  
Jeges; and always spoke of it with the utmost re­  
fpe&amp;t and veneration : arbitrary ministers, they  
thought might possibly, at times, attempt to op­  
press them, but they relied on it, that the parlia­  
ment, on application, would always give redress.  
They remembered,with gratitude,a strong instance  
of this, when a bill was brought into parliamen,  
with a clause to make royal instructions, laws in  
the colonies, which the house of commons would  
not pafsy and it was thrown out.  
2. And have they not still the fame refpet  
for parliament ? , . -  
A. No ; it is greatly leflened.  
5,. To what cause is that owing ? ,  
4. To a concurrence of causes 3 the restraints  
lately laid on their trade, by which the bringing  
of foreign gold and silver into the colonies was  
prevented 3 the prohibition of making paper money  
among themselves. ; and then demanding a new  
and heavy tax by stamps ; taking away at’ the  
fame time, tryals by juries, and rc%uﬁng to receive  
and hear their&#x27;humbf&#x27;e petitions. ,  
Q. Don’t you think they would submit to the  
flansp 2&amp;, if it was modified, the obnoxious parts  
taken out, and the duties reduced to some parti­  
culars of small moment ?  
A, No ; they will never submit to it.  
£. What do you think is the reason that the  
people of Awerica increase fafter than in England ?  
A. Because they marry yonnger, and more  
gcncral\l)&amp;. | 0  
r3‘ hy so ? L  
. Because any young couple that are industri­  
ous, may easily obtain land of their own, on which  
they can raifc a family. &#x27; e  
9. Are not the lower rank of people more at  
their ease in America than in England ? .  
A. They may be so if they are sober and dili­  
gent, as they are better paid for their labor.  
Q. What is your opinion of a future tax, im­  
ofed on the {ame principle with that es the  
Kamp at ;3 how would the Americans recgive it ?  
A. Just as they do this. - They would net pay it.  
. Q. Have you not heard of the resolutions of  
this house, and of the house o;(ﬁlérﬁs’,&#x27;&quot;&quot;&#x27;gifcrtinﬁ the  
right of parliament relating - to. America, includ­  
ing a power to tax the »peofple there ¢  
_ A. Yes, I have heard of such resolution.  
. Q. What will be the opinion of the Ameri­  
catis on those resolutions ¢ -  
_ A.&amp; They will think them unconftitutional,and  
unjust. o  
; JQ_ Woas it an opinion in America before 1763,  
that the parliament had no right to lay taxes and  
duties there ? :  
A. 1 never heard any obje&amp;tion to the right of  
laying duties to regulate commerce ; but a right  
to lay internal taxes was never {uppofed to be in  
parliament, as we are not represented there.  
- Q. On what do you found your opinion that  
‘the people in Americamade any such distinction ?  
A. 1 know that whenever the fubjet has oc­  
cured in conversation where I have been present,  
it has appeared to be the opinion of every one,  
that we could not be taxed in a parliament where  
we werc not ;gamfemcd. ‘But the p:;&#x27;ment of  
duties laid by 2t of parliament, as regulations of  
commerce, was never disputed.  
Q. But can you name any aé of aflembly, or  
  
public a&amp; of any of your governments, ghat made  
{uch diftin&amp;ion ? Vo, aul e :  
A. 1 do not know that there was any 3 I think  
there was never an.occafion to make any such a&amp;,  
till now that you have attempted to tax us ; that  
has occaﬁqa:i&#x27; resolutions of aflembly, declaring  
the diftin&amp;tion, in which I think every assembly  
on the ‘continent, and every member .in every  
aflembly, have been unanimous. - - .  
Q. What then could occasion convelfations on  
that fubje@ before that time ? aEs  
A, _&#x27;f!hjc,n: was in 1754 a proposition made (I  
think it came from hence) that in case of 2 war,  
which was then apprehended, the governors of  
the colonies should meet, and order the levying  
of troops, building of forts, and taking every  
other neceflary measure for the general defence ;  
and should draw on the treasury here for the sums  
expended, which were afterwards to be raised in  
the colonies by 2 genetal tax, to be laid-on them  
by a&amp; of parliament. This occasioned a good  
deal of conversation on the fubje€t, and the ge­  
neral opinion was, that the parliament neither  
would nor could lay any tax on us, till we were  
duly represented in parliament, because it was not  
just, nor agreeable to the nature of an English  
conflitution. . ;  
Q. Don’t you know there was a time in New-  
York, when it was under consideration to make  
an application to parliament to lay taxes on that  
colony, upon a deficiency arising from the assem­  
bly’s refufing or negle@ing to raise the necessary  
{upplies for the support of the civil government ?  
A. 1 &#x27;ncver&#x27;heanf of it. |  
Q. There was such an application under con­  
sideration in New-York ; and do you apprehend  
they could suppose the right of parliament to lay  
a tax in America was only-local, and confined to  
the case of a deficiency in a particular colony, by  
a]{efufal of its assembly to raise the neceflary fup­  
phes ! 33 %o :  
&quot; A. They could not suppose such a case, as that  
the aflembly would not raise the necessary supplies  
to support its own government, An aflembly  
that would refufe it must want common sense,  
which cannot be supposed. 1 think there was  
never any f{uch case at New York, and thatit  
must be 2 misrepresentation, or the fa&amp; must be  
mifunderflood. I know there have been some  
attempts, by ministerial inftru&amp;ions from hence,  
to oblige the assemblies to. fettle permanent salaries  
on governors, which they wifely refufed to do ;  
but I believe no assembly of New-York, or any  
other colony, ever refufed duly to support govern­  
ment by proper allowances, from time to time,  
to public officers. : L 2 e  
Q. But in case a governor, afting by instruc­  
tion, should call on an aflembly to raise the ne­  
ceflary supplies, and the aﬂ&#x27;emb?;&#x27; should refufe to  
do ity do you not think it would then be for the  
good of the people of the colony, as well as ne­  
ceflary to %ovemmem, -that the parliament. should  
tax them ! S TE: At  
- A. Ido not think it would be necessary. If an  
aflembly could possibly be so absurd as to refufe  
raising the supplies requisite for the maintenance  
of government among them, they could notlong  
remain in such a situation ; the disorders anﬁ  
confufion occasioned by it must soon bring them  
to reason. g ; i  
Q, If it should nat, ought not the right to be  
in Great Britain ofapplying a remedy ?  
A. A right only-tobewfed in such a cale, I  
should have no objection, to, supposing it to be  
used merely for the good of the people of the Co­  
lony. A g : &#x27;  
Q. But who is to judge of that, Britain or the  
Calony? 13  
A. Those that feel can best judge.

2 OU fay the Colonies have always sub­  
mitted to external taxes, and object  
e to the right of parliament only in lay­  
ing internal taxes ; now can you shew that there  
is any kind of difference between the two taxes  
to the Colony on which they may be Jaid ?  
A. 1 think the difference is very great. An  
external tax is a duty laid on commadities import­  
&amp;d ; that duty is added to the firft cost, and other  
charges on the commodity, and when it is oftered  
to sale, makes 2 part of the price. If the people  
do not like it at that price, they refule it ; they  
are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax  
is forced from the people without their consent,  
if not laid by their own representatives. The  
ftamp-aét fays; we shall have no commerce, make  
no exchange of property with each other, neither  
purchase nor grant, nor recover debts ; we shall  
neither, marry, nor make our wills, unless we pay  
-such &amp; such sums ; and thus it is intended to  
extort our money from us, or ruin us by the con­  
sequences of refufing to pay it. ‘  
9. But supposing the external tax or duty to  
be laid on the neceflaries of life imported into  
your Colony, will not that be the fame thing in  
its effets as an internal tax ?  
4. 1 know not a single article imported into  
the northern Colonies, but what they can either  
do without, or make themselves.  
9. Don’t you think cloth from England ab­  
solutely neceflary to them ? |  
&#x27;~ 4. No, by no means absolutely neceflary ;  
with industry and good management, they may  
very well {upply themselves with all they want,  
9. Will it not take a long time to eftablith  
that manufalture among them ? and must they  
not in the mean while {uffer greatly ?  
» A I think not. They have made a surprising  
progress alieady. And lam of opinion, that before  
their old cloths are worn out, they will have new  
ones of their own making.  
9. Can they poflibly find wool enough in  
Neorih- America ?  
A. They have taken fleps to increase the wool.  
They entered into general combinations to eat no  
more lamb, and very few lambs were killed last  
year. This course persisted in, will soon make  
a prodigious difference in the quantity of wool.  
And th- eftablithing of great manufattories, like  
those in the clothing towns here, is not neceflary,  
as it is where the business is to be carried on for  
the purposes of trade. The people will all {pin,  
and work for themselves, in their own houses.  
9. Can there be wool and manufature enough  
in one or two years ?  
» A. In three yecars, [ think they may.  
9. Does not the severity of the winters in the  
Northern Colonies, occasion the wool to be of  
bad quality ?  
A. No ; the wool is very fine and good.  
Q. in the more Southern Colonies, as in Vir­  
ginia ; do’nt you know that the wool is coarle,  
and only a kind of hair ?  
4. Idon’t know it. I never heard it. Yet  
I have been some-times in Virginia. I cannot  
“fay I ever took particular notice of the wool there, 4  
but I believe it is good, though I cannot speak  
positive of it ; but Virginia, and the Colonies  
{fouth of it, have less occaficn for wool ; their  
winters are short, and not very severe, and they  
can very well clothe themselves with linnen and  
cotten of they own raising for the reitof the year.

A. In some of the most Northern Colonies  
&#x27; they may be obliged to&#x27;do it some part of the  
winter. e  
9. Considering the resolutions of parliament,  
as to the right, do&#x27;you think, if the ffamp-act is re­  
pealed, that theNorth- Americans will be fatisfied ?  
A. 1 believe they will.  
9. Why do you think so ?  
4. 1 think the resolutions of right will give  
them very little concern, if they are never attempt­  
ed to be carried into prattice. The Colonies will  
probably confider themselves in the fame situation,  
in that refpeft, with Ireland ; they know you  
claim the fame right with regard to Ireland, but  
you never exercile it. And thev may believe  
you never will exercise it in the Colonies, any  
more than in Ireland, unless on some very extra­  
ordinary occafton.  
9. But who are to be judges of that extraor­  
dinary occafton ? Is it not the parliament,  
A. Though the pailiament may judge of the  
occafion,the people,will think it can never exercise  
such a right, till representatives from the Colonies  
are admitted into parliament, &amp; that whenever the  
occasion ariles, representatives will be ordered.  
9. Did you never hear that Maryland, during  
the iaft war, had refufed to furnifh a quota to­  
wards the common defence ?  
A. Maryland has been miflreprefented in that  
matter, Maryland, to my knowledge, never re­  
fufed to contribute, or grant aids to the Crown.  
The aflemblies every year, during the war, voted  
considerable sums, aud formed bills to raise them.  
The Bills were according to the conflitution of  
that province, sent up to the council, or upper  
house, for concurrence, that they might be pre­  
sented to the governor, in order to be enaéted into  
laws. Unhappy disputes between the two houses  
arising fiom the defeéts of that conftituion prin­  
cipally, rendered all the bills but one or two abor­  
tive. The proprietary’s council rejected them.  
It is true Maryland did not continue its propor­  
tion, but it was, in my opinion, the fault of the  
government, not of the people.  
Q. Was it not talked of in tlie other provinces  
as a proper measure to apply to parliament to  
compel them ?  
A. T have heard such discourse ; but as it was  
well known; that the people were not to blame,  
no such application was ever made, nor any step  
taken towards it.  
9. Was it not proposed at a public meeting ?  
A; Not that I know of.  
9. Do you remember the abolishing of the  
paper currency in New-England, by at of  
aflembly ?  
A. T do remember its being abolished, in the  
Maflachufetts Bay.  
9. Was not Lieutenant Governor Hutchiafon  
principally concerned in that transaction ?  
A. I have heard so.  
9. Was it not at that time a very unpopular  
law ?  
A. 1 believe it might, though T can fay little  
about it, as I lived at a distance from the province.  
9. Was not the scarcity of gold and silver an  
argument used against abolishing the paper ?  
A. 1 suppose it was.  
9. What is the present opinion there of that  
law ? Is it as unpopular as it was at firft ?  
A. 1 think it is not.  
9. Have not instructions from hence been  
(ometimes sent over to governors, highly oppres­  
sive and unpolitical ? A. Yes.  
9. Have not some governors dispensed with  
them for that reason ?  
A. Yes ; 1 have heard so.  
2. Did the Americans ever dispute the con­  
troling power of parliament to regulat¢ the com­  
merce ! 4. No, ,

9. Can any thing less than a military force  
carry the stamp a&amp;t into execution ?  
A. Ido not fee how a military force can be  
applied to that purpose, ; :  
Q. Why may it not ?  
A. Suppose a military force sent into America,  
they will find nobedy in arms 3 what are they then  
to do ! They cannot force a man to take flamps  
who chooses to do without. They will not find  
a rebellion ; they may indced make cone.  
Q. If the a&amp; is not repealed, what do you  
think will be the consequences ?  
A. A total loss of the refpe&amp;t and affeltion the  
people of America bear to this country, and of  
all the commerce that depends on that respect  
and affe&amp;ion. : :  
9. How can the commerce be affetted ?  
A. You will find, that if the a&amp; is not repeal­  
ed, they will take very little of your manufactures  
in a short time. :  
9. Is it in their power to do without them ?  
A. [ think they may very well do without them ?  
9. Is it their interest not to take them ?  
A. The goods they take from Britain are either  
neceflarics, mere conveniencies, or fuperfluities.  
The firft, as cloth &amp;c, with a little indufltry they  
can mzke at home ; the second they can do with­  
out, till they are able to provide them among  
themselves ; and the last, which are much the  
greatest part, they will firike off immediately,  
T&#x27;hey are mere articles of fafhion, purchaled and  
consumed, becaule the fathion in a respected coun­  
try, but will now be detested and reje€ted. I&#x27;he  
people have already struck off, by general agree­  
ment, the use of all goods fathionable in mourn­  
ings, and many thousand pounds worth are sent  
back as unsaleable. ;  
9. Is it their interest to make cloth at home ?  
A. I think they may at present get it cheaper  
from Britain, I mean of the fame finenefs and  
neatness of workmanthip ; but when one confiders  
other circumstances; the restraints on their trade,  
and the difficulty of making remictances; it is  
their interest to make every thing.  
9. Suppose an a&amp; of internal regulations, con­  
neéted with a tax, how would they receive it ?  
A. 1 think it would be objected to.  
9. Then no regulation with a tax would be  
submitted to ? ,  
A. Their opirion is, that when aids to the  
Crown are wanted, they are to be asked of the  
aflemblies, according to the old eftablifbed usage;  
who will, as they always have done; grarit them  
freely. And that their money ought not to be  
given away without their consent, by persons at  
a distance, unacquainted with their circumitances  
&amp; abilities. The granting aids to the Crown, is  
the only means they have of recomthending them­  
selves to their sovereign, and they think it ex­  
tremely hard and unjust, that a body of men, in  
which they have no representative, should make  
a merit to itfelf of giving and granting what is  
not its own, but theirs, and deprive them of 4  
right they esteem of the utmost value and impor­  
tance, as it is the security of all their other rights.  
9. Butis not the poft-office, which they have  
long received, a tax as well as a regulation ?  
A. No ? the money paid for the postage of a  
letter is not of the nature of a tax ; it is merely a  
quantum meruit for a service dene 3 no person is  
compellable to pay the money, if he does not chose  
to receive the service. A man may still; as before  
the a&amp;, fend his letter by a servant, a special mef~  
fenger, or a friend, if he thinks it cheaper and fafer.  
9. But do they not confider the regulations of  
the poft-office, by the a&amp; of last year, as a tax ?  
A. By the regulations of last year the rate of  
postage was generally abated near thirty per cent.  
through all America; they certainly cannot  
confider such abatement as a tax.

B. If an excise was Jaid by parliament, which  
they might likewise avoid paying, by not con­  
suming the article excised, would they then not  
‘object to it ? 3 |  
A. They would certainly objeét to it, as an  
‘excife unconneted with any service done, and is  
mmerely an aid which they think ought to be asked  
‘of them, and granted by them, if they are to pay  
it, and can be granted for them by no others  
whatsoever, whom they have not impowered for  
that purpose.  
9. You fay they do not objeét to the right of  
parliament in laying duties on goods to be paid  
on their importation ; now, is there any kind of  
difference between a duty en the importation of  
goods, and an excise on their consumption ?  
A. Yes ; a very material one; an excise, for  
the reafans I have just mentioned, they think you  
can have no right to lay within their country.  
But the sea is yours ; youmaintain, by your flcets,  
the fafety of navigation in it ; and keep it clear  
of pirates ; you may have therefore a natural and  
equitable right to some toll or duty on merchan­  
dizes carried throughout that part of your domi­  
nions, towards defraying the expence you are at  
in ships to maintain the fafety of that carriage.  
9. Does this realoning hold in the case of a  
duty laid on the produce of their lands exported ?  
and would they not then object to such a duty !  
A. If it tended to make the produce so much  
dearer abraad as to leflen thedemand for it, to be  
Yure they would obje&amp; to such a duty ; not to  
your right of laying it, but they would complain  
of it as a burthen, and petition you to lighten it.  
- 2. Isnot the duty paid on the tobacco exported  
2 duty of that kind ?  
4. That, I think, is only on tobacco carried  
coafltwife from one Colony to another, and appro­  
%x‘i,ated as a fund for supporting the college at  
‘Wi lliamfburgh, in Virginia. :  
2. Have not the affeniblies in the Weft-In­  
dies the fame natural rights with those in North-  
America ?  
A. Undoubtedly. ;  
2. And is there not a tax laid on their sugars  
exported, ? : -  
A. 1 am not much acquainted with the Weft-  
Indies, but the duty of four and a half per cent.  
on sugars exported, was, 1 believe, granted by  
their own assemblies. &#x27;  
Q. How much is the poll-tax in your province  
Yaid on unmarried men ?  
A. It is, I think, Fifteen Shillings, to be paid  
by every single freeman, upwards of twenty-one  
years old. :  
Q. What is the annual amount of all the taxes  
in Pennsylvania ?  
A. 1 suppose about 20,000 Pounds sterling.  
9. Supposing the stamp act continued, and  
enforced, do you imagine that ill humour will  
induce the Americans to give as much for worse  
manufaétures of their own, and use them, prefer­  
able to better of ours ?  
A. Yes I think so. People will pay as freely  
to gratify one paflion as another, their resentment  
as their pride.  
Q. Would the people at Boston discontinue  
their trade ?  
A. The merchants are a very small number,  
compared with the body of the people, and must  
discontinue their trade, if nobody will buy their  
goods. , :  
Q. What are the body of the people in the  
Colonies ?  
A. They are farmers, husbandmen or planters.  
Q. Would they fuffer the produce of their  
lands to rot ? %  
A. No ; but they would not raise so much.  
They would manufature more, and plough less,  
Q. Would they live without the administration  
of juttice in civil matters, and fuffer all the incon­  
veniencies of such a situation for any considerable  
time, rather than take the stamps, supposing the  
stamps, were proteted by a fufficient force, where  
every one might have them ? ;  
A. I think the supposition impra&amp;icable, that  
the stamps should be so proteéted as that every  
one might have them. &#x27;The act requires fub­  
diftributors to be appointed in every county town,  
diftri&amp;t and village, and they would be neceflary.  
But the principal distributors, who were to have  
had a considerable profit on the whole, have not  
thought it worth while to continue in the office,  
and f’tbink it impoflible to find sub-distributors  
fit to be trusted, who, for the trifling profit that  
must come to their share, would incur the odiym,  
  
and run the hazard that would attend it 3 and if  
they could be found, I think it impraclicable to  
prote&amp;t the stamps in so many distant and romote  
‘places. :  
3 Q. But in places where they could be prote&amp;t­  
ed, would not the people use them rather than  
remain in such a situation, unable to obtain any  
right, or ‘recover, by law, any debt ?  
A. It is hard to fay, what they would do. I  
can only judge what other people will think, and  
how they will a&amp;, by what I feel within myfelf,  
I bave a great many debts due to me in America,  
and I had rather they thould remain unrecoverable  
by any law, than submit to the stamp-act. They  
will be debts of honour. It is my opinion the  
people will either continue in that situation, or  
find some way to extricate themselves, perhaps by  
generally agreeing to pzoceed in the courts with­  
out stamps, £  
Q. What do {cm fhink a fufficient military  
force to prateét the distribution of the famps in  
every part of America. ,  
A. A very great force : I can’t fay what, if  
the disposition of America is for a general resistance.  
Q. What is the number of men in America  
able to bear arms, or of disciplined militia ?  
A. Thereare, I suppose, at least————  
[ Queflion thjecled to. He withdrew. Called in  
again. ]  
Q. Tls the American stamp-a&amp; anequal tax on  
that country ?  
A. I think not. Q. Whyfo?  
A. The greatest part of the money must arise  
from law suits for the recovery of debts, and be  
paid by the lower fort of people, who were too  
poor easily to pay their debts. It is therefore a  
heavy tax on the poor, &amp; a tax upon them for  
being poor. ;  
Q. But will not this increase of expence be a  
means of leflening the number of law suits.  
A. I think not ; for as the costs all fall upon  
the debtor, and are to be paid by him, they would  
be no discouragement to the creditor to bring his  
altion. ‘  
Q. ?W’ou!d it not have the effe&amp; of exceflive  
usury ?  
A}.’ Yes, as an oppression of the debtor.  
Q. How many ships are there laden annually  
in North-America with flax-feed for Ireland ?  
A. I cannot speak to the number of ships, but  
[ know that in 1752, 10,000 hogtheads of flax­  
feed, each containing 7 bushels, were exported  
from Philadelphia to Ireland. I suppose the  
quantity-is greatly increased since that time ; and  
it is understood that the exportation from New-  
York is equal to that from Philade!phia.  
Q. What becomes of the flax that grows with  
that flaxfeed ? - .  
A. They manufature some into coarse, and  
some into a middling kind of linen.  
Q. Are there any flitting mills in America ?  
A. I think there are, but I believe only one at  
present employed. I suppose they will all be set  
to work, if the interruption of the trade continues.  
Q. Are there any fulling mills there ?  
~ A. A great many. :  
Q. Did&#x27;you never hear that a great quantity  
of stockings were contra&amp;ted for, for the army  
during the war, and manufaGtured atPhiladelphia?  
- A. I have heard so,  
Q. If the ftamp-aél fthould be repealed, would  
not the Americafis- think they could oblige the  
parliament to repeal every external tax law now  
in force ? ;  
A. It is hard to answer questions of what peo­  
ple at such a distance will think.  
Q. But what do you imagine they will think  
were the motives of repealing the a&amp; ?  
A. If{uppofe they will think that it was repealed  
from a conviction of its inexpediency ; and they  
will rely upon it, that while the fame inexpedi­  
ency fubfilts, you will never attempt to make  
such another.  
Q. What do you mean by its inexpediency ?  
A. I&#x27;mean its inexpediency on several accounts;  
the poverty. &amp; inability of those who were to pay  
the tax ; the general discontent it has occasioned,  
and the impraclicability of enforcing it.

B oppofers of the stamp act, wonld the Co­  
lonies acquieflce in the authority of the legislature ?-

A 1 don’t doubt at all, that if the lepillature

9. But if the legislature should think fit to  
ascertain its right to lay taxzs, by an act laying 2  
finall tak, contrary to tlieir opinion, would they  
submit to pay the tax ? e Vea s  
A. The proceedings of the people in America  
have betn considered too much together. “The  
proceedings of the aflemblies have been very dif­  
forent from those of the mobs, &amp; should be diftin­  
guiffied; as having nd corinetion with each other.  
—The afiomblies have only peaceably resolved  
what they taketo be their rights ; they have taken  
no measures for opposition by force ; they have  
hot built a fort, raised a man, or provided a grain  
of ammunition, in oider to such opposition.—The  
zing-leaders of riots they think ought to be puni­  
shed ; they would punish them themselves, if they  
coeld. Every sober sensible man would wish to  
fee rioters punished, as otherwile peaceable people  
have no security of person or estate,. But as to  
any internal tax; how small focver, laid by the:  
Jegiflature herc on the people tßere, while the  
have no reprelencatives in this legislature, T thinz  
3¢ will never be submitted to.—They will oppose  
it to the Jaff.—They do not confider it as at sall  
neceilary for you to raise money o them by your:  
taxes, becanfe they are, &amp; always have been; ready  
to raise money by taxes among themfelvs, and to:  
grant sarge f&#x27;zms&#x27;, equal to their abilities, upon  
requisition from the Crown.—They have tiot only  
%;aﬂtcgf equal ta their abilities, but, during ail the  
Jaff war, they have granted far beyond thelr abili-:  
‘ties, and beyend their proportion with’ this coun-!  
try, you yourselves being judges, to&#x27; the amount  
.of many hundred thousand pounds, and this they  
did freely and readily, only on a fort of premise  
“from the feeretary of state, that it fhoald be re­  
‘comaaended to parliament to make them compén­  
f»ﬁo&quot;n. It was accordingly recommended to par-

“equal so those sent from Dritain, and far beyond

unwilling to bear a share of the burthen, did ex­  
ceed their proportion ; for if they had done less,  
or had only equall’d their proportion,there would  
have been no room or reason for compensation.—  
Indeed the fims reimbursed them, were by no  
‘means adequate to the expence they incurred be­  
yonid their propoition ; but they never murmured  
at that ; they esteemed their Sovereign’s approba­  
tion of their zeal and fidelity, the approbation of  
this Woufe, far beyond any other kind.of compen­  
sation 3 therefore there was no occasion for this  
a&amp;, to forcz money from a willing people ; they  
had not refufed giving money for the purposes of  
theaét © no requisition hiad been mede; they were  
always willing and ready to do what could rea­  
sonably be expedted from them, ind in this light  
they wilh to be considered. .  
9. But suppose Great-Britain {hould be en­  
gaped in a war in Europe, would North- America  
contribute to the support of it?  
A. Ido think ‘they would, asfar as their cir­  
cimftances would permit. ‘They confider them­  
selves as a part of the British empire, &amp; as having  
one common interest with it ; they may be looked  
on here as foreigners; but they do not confider  
themselves as such. They are zealous for the  
honour &amp; prosperity of this natiom, and, while  
they are well used, will always beready to support  
it, as far as their little power goes. In 1739 they  
were called upon to aflift in the expedition against  
Carthagena, and they sent 3000 men to join your  
army. It is true Carthagena is in America, but  
as remote from the Notthierns Colonies, as if it  
had been in Europe. They make no diftin&amp;ion  
of wars, a 3 to their daty of assisting in them. 1  
know the lalt war is commonly {poke of here as  
entered into for the defence, or for the fake of the  
RgOPIé of America. I think it is quite mifunder­  
tood. It began about the limits of Canada and  
Nova-Scotia, about territories to which the Crown  
indeed laid claim, but were not claimed by any  
‘Britith Colony ; tione of the lands had been  
granted to dny Colonist ; we had therefore no  
particular concern or interell in that dispute. Aas  
to the Ohio, the contest there began about the  
right of trading in the Indian country, a right  
you had by the treaty of Utrecht, which the  
French infringed ; they seized the traders and their  
goods, which were your manufactures ; they took  
1 fort which 4 company of your merchants, and  
their faltors and correspondents had ere@ed thers,  
to secure that trade. Braddock was sent with an  
army to re-take that fort (which was looked on  
here as another incroachment en the King’s ter­  
titory) and to proteét your trade. It was not till  
after his defeat that the Colonies were attacked..  
They were before in perfect peace with both French  
arid Indiahs 5 the troops were not therefore sent  
fist their defence. The trade with the Indians,  
‘ho’ carried ori in America, i$ not an American  
interest. The people of Auierica are chiefly far­  
mers and planters ; fcaree any thing they raise or  
produce is an article of commerce withthe Iridians.  
The Indian trade is a Britith interest ; it is carried  
on with Dritith manufadures, for the profit of  
British mierchants ‘and manufacturers 3 therefore  
the war, as it commenced for the defenee of terri­  
tories of the Crown, the property of no American,  
and for the defence of a trade ptirely British, was  
really a British war—and yet the people of Ame­  
rica made no fcrupleof contribitting their utmost  
towards carrying it ony and bringing it to a happy  
concinfion. _ 3, ‘  
9. Do you think then that the taking pofleflicn  
of the King’s territorial rights, and ftrength®ning  
the frofitiers, is not an American interest b  
A Not particularly, but tonjointly a British  
and an Amencan interest.

the war with Spain, was entered into for the fake  
of America ? Was it not occasioned by captures  
made in the American seas # - &#x27; :  
A. Yes 5 captures of ships carrying ca the  
Britith trade with British manufaQtures.  
9. Was not thednte war with thelndians, fiacg  
the peace with France, 2 war for America only 2  
4. Yes } it was more particularly for America  
thzn the former but it was rather a consequence  
or rtémains of the former war, the Indians not  
having been thoroughly pacified, and the Amerir  
cans bore by much the greatest fhareof theexpence.  
It was put an end to by the army under General  
Bouquet ; there were not above 300 regulars in  
that army, and abgve 1000 Penniylvanians.  
2. Is it not necessary to fend troops to Ame:  
rica, to defend the Americans against the Indians?  
A. Noj; by no nieans § it never was neceflary.  
They defended themselves -when thicy were but a  
handful; and the Indians much more numerous.  
They continually gained ground,and bave driven  
the Indians over the mountains, without any  
trodps sent to their assistance from this country.  
And can it be thought neceflary now. to feid  
troops for their defence from those diminishing  
Indian tribes, when the, Colonies are become fi  
populous, 2nd so strong ? There is not the lcag  
occasion for it j they arc very able to defend  
themflelves, . e e T  
9. Do you fay there were no more tham*3oo  
regular . troops employed in the late Indian war t  
A. Not on the Obio, or the frontiers of Pen­  
nsylvania, which was the chief part of the war  
that affced the Colories. There were garrisons  
a: Niagara, Fort Detroit, and -those remote posts  
kept for the fdke of your trade ; I did not reckon  
them, but I believe that on the whole the number  
of Americans;or provincial troops,etployed in the  
war, was greater than that of the regulars. lam  
not certain, but I think so. . : pnie  
9. Do you think the assemblies have a right  
to levy mioney on the fubjeét there; to grant to  
the crown ¢ - ; N :  
A. 1 certainly think so ; théy have always  
done it. . , el : s

rights ? and do they knaw that, by that ftatutey  
money is not to be raised on the fubje&amp;t but by  
consent of parliament ¢ = ,  
A. They are well acquainted with its =  
9. How then can they think they havea rigl:\f;  
to levy mioney for the Crown;. or for any other  
than local purposes ! | eLo e  
A. They underftarid that claiife to relate td  
fubje&amp;s only within the realm ; that no money  
can be levied on them for the Crown, but by cog+  
sent of parlizment. The Colonies are not fupgoﬂ?cl  
to be within the realm ; they have aflembhes of  
their own, which are their parliaments; and thgy  
are in that respect In tlie fame situation with Tre­  
land. When money is to be raised for the Clowri  
upon the fubjeét in Ireland, of in the Colonies,  
the consent is given in the parliament of Irelans  
or in the aflemblies of the Colonies. They think.  
the parliament of Great-Britain cannot properly |  
give that consent till it has representatives frohi  
America ; for the petition of right exprefly faysy®  
it is to be.by common consent in parliament, aﬁ&amp;  
the people of cha have no representatives in

A. That is a deep question.—As so my own  
opinion, I thould think myfelf at liberty to do it,  
and should do it, if I&#x27;liked the occafion.’ ;  
2. When money has been raised in the Colo­  
nies upon requisitions, has it not been granted to  
-the King ? , &#x27;  
A. Yes always ; but the requisitions have ge+  
nerally been for some service exprefled, as’ to raise  
cloath, and pay troops, and not for moncy only.  
2. If the a&amp; thould pass, requiring the Ame­  
rigan aflemblies to make compensation to the fuf­  
fercrs, and they {hould- disobey it, and then the  
parliament should, by another aét, lay an internal  
tax would they then obey it ?  
A. The people will pay no internal tax ; and I  
think an a&amp;t to oblige the assemblies to make com­  
pensation is unneceflary, for] am of opinion, that  
as soon as the present heats are abated they will  
take the matter into consideration, and, if it  
is right to be done, they will do it of themfclves.  
9. Do not letters ofien come into the poft­  
office in America, direted. to some inland town  
were no post goes? ~ A Yes.  
Q. Can any private person take up those letters,  
and carry them as direSted ? _ &#x27;  
* A. Yes ; any friend of the person may do it,  
paying the postage that has occurred.  
2. But must he not pay an additional postage  
for the distance to such inland town? 4 No.  
- 2. Can the post-master answer delivering the  
letter, without being paid such additional postage ?  
A. Certainly he can demand nothing, where  
he-does no service.  
9. Suppose a person, being far from home, finds  
a letter in a polt-office direted to him, and he  
lives in a place to which the post generally goes,  
and the letter is direted to that place, will the  
post-master deliver him the letter, without his  
paying the postage receivable at the place to which  
the lettér is direéled ? 7 - :  
A. Yes ; the office cannot demand postage for a  
letter that it does not carry, or farther than it  
does carry it. &#x27;  
Q. Are not ferrymen in America obliged, by  
act of parliament, to carry over the pests without  
pay ? ; A Yes, w 0 -  
9. Is not this a tax on the ferrymen ?  
&quot; ~A. They do not confider it as such, as they  
have an advantage from persons travclling with  
the post.  
&quot;~ 9. If the stamp-a&amp; should beiepealed, and the  
‘Crown should make a requisition to the Colonies  
“for a sum of moncy, would they grant it ?  
- 4. Ibelieve they would.  
© 9, Why.do you think so ?  
. A. I can speak for the Colony!llive in ? T had  
‘it in inffruétion from the aflembly to aflure the  
ministry, that as they always had done, so they  
thould always think it their duty to grant such aids  
“to theCrown as were {uitable to their circumstances  
_and abilities, whenever called upon for that pur­  
‘pofe, in the usual constitutional manner ; and 1  
had the honor of communicating this inftruéion  
“to that honorable gentleman then minister.  
- 2. Would they do this for a Britith concern ;  
as suppose a war in some part of Europe, that did  
not affe&amp;t them. - ‘ ‘  
A. Yes, for any thing that concerned the gene­  
-ral interest. They confider themselves as a part  
“of the whole. =~  
9. What is the usual confitutional manner of  
calling on the Colanies for aids ? *  
A. A letter from the secretary of slates -  
9, Is this all you mean, a letter from&#x27; the fe­  
creétary of state ? P Rl  
&quot;~ 4. I mean the usual way of requisition, in a.  
circular letter from the secretary of state, by his  
Majesty’s command, reciting ‘the occasion, ‘&amp; re­  
~commending it to the Colonies to ‘grant such aids  
&quot; as became their loyalty, and were suitable to&#x27;their  
abilities, . o g  
&#x27; 9. Did the secretary of state ever write for  
- money for the Crown&#x27;? &amp; = -  
~ A. The requisitions have been to taife, clothe  
&quot;and pay men, which cannot be done without  
,Amoney. - o :  
.. 2. Would they grant money alone, if called on?  
. -Aln my opinion they would, money as well  
as. men, when they have money, or can make it.  
2. I the parliament fhould&#x27; repeal the stamp­  
- a&amp;, will the assembly of Pennsylvania rescind their  
_refolutions ? = 4. T&#x27;think not.  
. .9, Befae there was any,_thought of the Ramp.  
aty, did they wish fer a representation in parlia-  
R e  
2. Doa’t you ki %Y, that there is, in the Pen-  
  
nfylvania charter, an express reservation of the  
right of parliament to’lay taxes there ?  
A, 1 know there is d clause in the charter, by  
which the King grants that he will levy no taxes  
on the inhabitants, unless it be with the consent  
of the assembly, or by a&amp; of parliament, ‘  
£, How then could the aflembly of Pennfylva­  
‘nia assert, that laying a tax on them by the ftamp­  
&#x27;act was an infringment of their rights ?  
4. They underfland it thus ; by the fame char­  
ter, and otherwise, they are intitled to all the pri­  
viltges ‘and liberties of Englithmen 3 they find in  
the great charters, and the petition-and declaration  
of nights, that one of the privileges of Englith  
fubjeéts is, that they are not to be taxed but by  
their common consent ; they have therefore relied  
upon it, from the firft settlement of the province,  
that the parliament never would, nor could, by  
colour of that clause in tite charter, assume a right  
of taxing them, till it had qualified itfelf to exer­  
cise such right, by admitting representatives from  
the people to be taxed, who ought to make a part  
of that common conferit. -  
£, Are there any words in the charter that  
juftity that construction ? A  
A. The common tights of Englithmen, as de­  
clared by Magna Charta, and the petition of  
right, all juflifyit. - °  
2. Does the diftinGion between internal and  
external (axes exist in the words of the charter?  
A. Na, I beieve not. ‘  
2. Then may they not by the fame interpre­  
tation, obfjc&amp; to the parliament’s right of external  
taxation |  
4. They never have hitherto. Many argu­  
ments have be:n lately used here to shew them  
that there is no difference, and that if you have  
no right to tax them internally, you have none  
to tax them ex:ernally, or make any other law to  
bind them. At -prel{nt they do not reafam so,  
but in time they may possibly be convinced by  
these arguments. . _ &#x27;  
2. Do not the resolutions of the Pennsylvania  
assembly fay all taxes #  
4. If they do, they mean only internal taxes ;  
the fame words have not always the fame meaning  
here and in the Colonies, By taxes they mean  
internal taxes ; by duties they mean customs ;  
these are their ideas of the language. :  
a% Have you not seen the resolutions of the  
Maflachufletts Bay assembly ?  
A. I have. R T &#x27;  
Q. Do they not fay, that neither external nor in­  
teral taxes can belaid on them by parliament?  
A. I.don’t know that they do ; I believe not.  
£; If the fame Colony should fay neither tax  
nor imposition could be laid, does not that province  
hold the powe# of parliament can hold neither ?  
4. 1 suppose that by the word imposition, they  
do not intend to express duties to be laid on.goods  
imported, as regulations of commerce.  
2. What can the Cclonies mean then by im­  
position as diftin&amp;k from taxes ? :  
4. They may mean many things, as imprefling  
of men or of carriagés, quartering troops on pti­  
vate houses, and the like ; there may be great im­  
positions, that are not properly taxes.  
Q. Is not the poft-office rate an internal tax  
laid by aét of parliament ?  
A. 1 have answered that.  
Q. Are all parts of the Colonies equally able to  
pay taxes. ? &#x27; i  
A. No, certainly ; the frontier parts, which  
have been ravaged by the enemy, are greatly dis­  
abled by- that means, and therefore, in such cases,  
are usually favoured in our tax laws, - :  
Q. Can- we, “at this ‘diftance, be competent  
judges of what favours are neceflary ?  
A. The parliament have supposed it, by claiming  
a right to make tax laws for America : I think  
it impoflible, |  
Q. Would the repeal of the stamp-a&amp; be any  
discouragement of your manufa@ures ? Will the  
people that have begun the mznufature decline it ?  
A. Yes, I think they will ; especially, if, at the  
fame time, the trade is opened again, so that re­  
mittances can be easily made, %have known se­  
veral instances that make it probable. In the war  
before laft,tobacco being low, &amp; making little re­  
mittance, the people of Virginia went generally,  
into family manufaCtures, ﬁftetwards, when ‘to­  
bacco bore a better price, they returned to-&#x27;the use  
of British manufaétrues. So fulling mills were  
very much disused in the last war in Pennsylvania,  
because ‘bills were then plenty, and remittance  
could easily be made to&#x27; Britain for English cloth  
  
and other goods. i |  
- Q. If the fiamp 24 should be repealed, woul  
‘it induce thezflemblies of Americato acknowledg  
the rights of parliament to tax them, and woul.  
they erafe&#x27;their resolutions 7 A. No, never.  
&amp; Is there no means of obliging themi to eras,  
those resolutions ?  
.~ A. None that I know of ; they will never de  
it unless compelled by force of atms.  
Q. Is there no power on carth that can force  
them to erase them ? - :  
A. No power, how great soever, can force mer  
to change their opinions. |  
Q. Do théy confider the poft-office as a tax,  
or as a regulation ? : ,  
A. Not as a tax, but a 5 a regulation and con­  
veniency ; every aflembly encouraged it, and sup­  
ported it in its infancy, by grants of money, which  
they would nototherwife have done ; and the peo­  
ple have always paid the postage.  
Q. When did you receive the inftru@ions ‘you  
menticned ? - : cia  
A. I brought them with me, when I came to  
England, 2bout 15 months since. =  
Q. When did you communicute that inftru@on  
to the minister ? el ~  
~A. Soon after my arrival, while the stamping  
of America was under consideration, and before  
the bill was brought in, , &#x27;  
Q. Would it be most for the interest of Great-  
Britain, to employ the hands of Virginia in to=  
bacco, or in manufaétures ¢ -  
A. In tobacco to be sure. e h)  
Q. What used to be the pride of the Americans ?  
A. To indulge in the fathions and manufac­  
tures of (3. Britain. . .

duty of Ten Pounds per head on all Ne-  
groes imported, with ſome other duties.  
  
Q. For what purpoſes are thoſe taxes  
  
laid ?  
B . Tor  
  
45  
  
„  
  
A. For the ſupport of the civil and  
military eſtabliſhments of the country, and  
to diſcharge the heavy debt contracted 1 in  
the laſt war.  
  
Q. How long are thoſe taxes to con-  
tinue?  
  
A. Thoſe for diſcharging the debt are  
to continue till 1772, and longer, if the  
debt ſhould not be then all diſcharged.  
The others muſt always continue.  
  
Q. Was it not expected that the debt  
would have been ſooner diſcharged ?  
  
A. It was, when the peace was made  
with France and Spain But a freſh war  
breaking out with the Indians, a freſh load  
of debt was incurred, and the taxes, of  
courſe, continued longer by a new_law.  
  
Q. Are not all the people very able to  
pay thoſe taxes ?  
  
A. No. The frontier counties, all along  
the continent, having been frequently ra-  
vaged by the enemy, and greatly impo=-  
veriſhed, are able to pay very little tax.  
And therefore, in conſideration of their  
diſtreſſes, our late tax laws do N  
favour thoſe counties, excuſing the ſu  
ferers; and J ſuppoſe the ſame is done 1 in  
other governments.  
  
Are not you concerned i in the ma-  
nagement of the Poſt-Office in America ?  
  
A. Yes. I am Deputy Poſt- Maſter  
General of North-America.  
  
  
  
1  
Q. Don&#x27;t you think the diſtribution of  
  
ſtamps, by poſt, to al: the inhabitants,  
very practicable, if there was no oppo-  
  
  
A. The poſts only go along the ſea-  
  
  
ſtances, go back into the country; and if  
they did, ſending for ſtamps by poſt would  
occaſion an expence of poſtage, amount-  
ing, in many cafes, to much more than  
that of the ſtamps themſelves.  
Q. Are you acquainted with New-  
  
  
A. I never was there.  
  
Q. Do you know whether there are any  
poſt-roads on that ifland ?  
  
A. I have heard that there are no roads  
at all; but that the communication be-  
  
  
ſea only.  
Q. Can you diſperſe the ſtamps by poſt  
  
in Canada?  
  
A. There is only a poſt between Mont-  
real and Quebec. The inhabitants live  
  
  
ſupported among them, and therefore they  
cannot get ſtamps per poſt. The Engliſh  
Colonies too, along the frontiers, are very  
thinly ſettled.  
  
  
+1  
  
Q. From the thinneſs of the back ſet-  
tlements, would not the ſtamp- act be ex-  
tremely inconvenient to the inhabitants,  
if executed?  
  
A. To be ſure it would; as many of  
the inhabitants could not get ſtamps when  
they had occaſion for them, without tak-  
ing long journeys, and ſpending perhaps  
Three or Four Pounds, that the Crown  
might get Sixpence.  
  
Q. Are not the Colonies, from their  
circumſtances, very able to pay the ſtamp  
duty.  
  
A. In my opinion, there is not gold  
and ſilver enough in the Colonies to pay  
the ſtamp duty for one year.  
  
Q. Don&#x27;t you know that the money  
ariſing from the ſtamps was all to be laid  
out in America? |  
  
A. I know it is appropriated by the act  
  
  
ſpent in the conquered Colonies, where  
the ſoldiers are, not in the Colonies that  
  
pay it.  
Is there not a balance of trade due  
from the Colonies where the troops are  
  
poſted, that will bring back the money  
  
  
A. I think not. I believe very little  
would come back. I know of no trade  
likely to bring it back. I think it would  
come from the Colonies where it was  
  
ſpent  
  
1  
  
ſpent directly to England; for I have al-  
ways obſerved, that in every Colony the  
more plenty the means of remittance to  
England, the more goods are ſent for, and  
the more trade with England carried on.  
  
Q. What number of white inhabitants  
do you think there are in Pennſylvania?  
  
A. I ſuppoſe there may be about  
160, ooo. 5  
  
Q. What number of them are Quakers?  
  
A. Perhaps a third.  
  
Q. What number of Germans?  
  
A. Perhaps another third ; but I can-  
not ſpeak with certainty. : |  
  
Q. Have any number of the Germans  
ſeen ſervice, as ſoldiers, in Europe?  
  
A. Yes, —many of them, both in Eu-  
rope and America.  
  
Q. Are they as much diſſatisfied with  
the ſtamp-duty as the Engliſh ?  
  
A. Yes, and more; and with reaſon,  
as their ſtamps are, in many caſes, to be  
double. |  
  
Q. How many white men do you. ſup-  
poſe there are in North-America?  
  
A. About zoo, ooo, from ſixteen to  
ſixty years of age.  
  
Q. What may be the amount of one  
year&#x27;s imports into Pennſylvania from  
Britain ? |  
  
A. I have been informed that our mer-  
  
: chants  
  
TT.  
  
chants compute the imports from Britain  
to be above 500,000 Pounds. I  
Q. What may be the amount of the  
produce of your province exported to Bri-  
tain ?  
A. It muſt be ſmall, as we produce  
little that is wanted in Britain. I ſuppoſe  
it cannot exceed 40,000 Pounds.  
Q. How then do you pay the balance ?  
A. The balance is paid by our produce  
carried to the Weſt-Indies, and fold in  
our own iſlands, or to the French, Spa-  
niards, Danes and Dutch; by the ſame  
carried to other colonies in North-Ame-  
rica, as to New-England, Nova-Scotia,  
Newfoundland, Carolina and Georgia;  
  
  
Europe, as Spain, Portugal and Italy. In  
all which places we receive either money,  
bills of Exchange, or commodities that  
ſuit for remittance to Britain ; which, to-  
gether with all the profits on the induſtry  
of our merchants and mariners, ariſing in  
thoſe circuitous voyages, and the freights  
made by their ſnips, center finally in Bri-  
tain to diſcharge the balance, and pay for  
  
  
Q. Have you heard of any difficulties  
lately laid on the Spaniſh trade ?  
  
  
TT.  
A. Yes, I have heard that it has been =  
  
greatly obſtructed by ſome new regula-  
  
tions, and by the Engliſh men of war  
  
and cutters ſtationed all along the coaſt in |  
  
America. |  
  
2. Do you think it right that America  
ſhould be protected by this country, and  
pay no part of the expence ?  
  
A. That is not the caſe. The Colo-  
nies raiſed, cloathed and payed, during  
the laſt war, near 25000 men, and ſpent  
many millions. e  
Q. Were you not reimburſed by parlia-  
ment?  
  
A. We were only reimburſed what, in  
  
your opinion, we had advanced beyond  
our proportion, or beyond what might  
  
_ reaſonably be expected from us; and it  
was a very ſmall part of what we ſpent.  
Pennſylvania, in particular, diſburſed a-  
bout 500,000 Pounds, and the reimburſe-  
ments, in the whole, did not exceed  
60,000 Pounds.  
Q. You have faid that you pay heavy  
taxes in Pennſylvania; what do they a-  
mount to in the Pound? _  
  
A. The tax on all eſtates, real and per-  
ſonal, is Eighteen Pence in the Pound,  
fully rated; and the tax on the profits of  
trades and profeſſions, with other taxes,  
  
do, I ſuppoſe, make full Half a Crown in  
the Pound.

Q. Do you know any thing of the rate  
of exchange in Pennſylvania, and whether  
it has fallen lately ? 7 og  
  
A. It is commonly from 170 to 175.  
I have heard that it has fallen lately from  
x75 to 162 and a half, owing, I ſuppoſe,  
to their leſſening their orders for goods;  
and when their debts to this country are  
E I think the exchange will probably  
  
e at par.  
  
Q. Do not you think the people of  
America would ſubmit to pay the ſtamp-  
duty, if it was moderated ?  
  
A. No, never, unleſs compelled by  
  
  
Q. Are not the taxes in Pennſylvania  
laid on unequally, in order to burthen  
the Engliſh trade, particularly the tax on  
profeſſions and buſineſs ?  
  
A. It is not more burthenſome in pro-  
portion than the tax on lands. It is in-  
  
  
Q. How is the aſſembly compoſed ? Of  
  
  
A. It is compoſed of landholders, mer-  
chants and artificers. D  
  
Are not the majority landholders ?  
  
A. I believe they are. |  
  
Q. Do not they, as much as PRION.  
  
WY x  
  
EF  
  
ſhift the tax off from the land, to eaſe that;  
and lay the burthen heavier on trade?  
A. I have never underſtood it fo. I  
never heard ſuch a thing ſuggeſted. And  
indeed an attempt of that kind could an-  
ſwer no purpoſe. The merchant or tra-  
der is always ſkilled in figures, and ready  
with his pen and ink. If unequal bur-  
thens are laid on his trade, he puts an ad-  
ditional price on his goods; and the con-  
ſumers, who are chiefly landholders, fi-  
nally pay the greateſt part, if not the  
whole. : |  
  
Q. What was the temper of America  
towards Great-Britain before the year  
1703? Saga  
  
A. The beſt in the world. They ſub-  
mitted willingly to the government of the  
Crown, and paid, in all their courts,  
obedience to acts of parliament. Nume-  
rous as the people are in the ſeveral old  
provinces, they coſt you nothing in forts,  
citadels, garriſons or armies, to keep them  
in ſubjection. They were governed by  
this country at the expence only of a little  
pen, ink and paper. They were led by  
a thread. They had not only a reſpect,  
but an affection, for Great-Britain, for  
its laws, its cuſtoms and manners, and  
even a fondneſs for its faſhions, that  
greatly increaſed the commerce. Natives  
  
  
7  
  
lo]  
of Britain were always treated with parti-  
cular regard ; to be an Old England-man  
  
  
and gave a kind of rank among us.  
  
Q. And what is their temper now.  
  
A. O, very much altered.  
  
Q. Did you ever hear the authority of  
parliament to make laws for America  
queſtioned till lately? |  
  
A. The authority of parliament was al-  
  
  
as ſhould lay internal taxes. It was never  
diſputed in laying duties to regulate com-  
merce. IN»  
  
Q. In what proportion hath population  
increaſed in America? 6  
  
A. I think the inhabitants of all the  
provinces together, taken at a medium,  
double in about 25 years. But their de-  
mand for Britiſh manufactures increaſes |  
much faſter, as the confumption 1s not  
merely in proportion to their numbers,  
but grows with the growing abilities of  
the ſame numbers to pay for them. In  
1723, the whole importation from Bri-  
tain to Pennſylvania, was but about  
15,000 Pounds Sterling; it is now near  
Half a Million. i .  
Q. In what light did the people of  
  
  
Great-Britain? 8  
A. They  
  
011]  
  
A. They conſidered the parliament as  
the great bulwark and ſeeurity of their  
liberties and privileges, and always ſpoke  
of it with the utmoſt reſpe&amp; and venera-  
tion. Arbitrary miniſters, they thought,  
might poſſibly, at times, attempt to op-  
preſs them; but they relied on it, that  
the parliament, on application, would al-  
ways give redreſs. They remembered,  
with gratitude, a ſtrong inftance of this,  
when a bill was brought into parhament,  
with a clauſe, to make royal inſtructions  
laws in the Colonies, which the Houſe  
of Commons would not paſs, and it was  
thrown out.  
  
Q. And have they not ſtill the ſame  
reſpect for parliament ?  
  
A. No; it is greatly leſſened.  
  
Q. To what cauſes is that owing ?.  
  
A. To a concurrence of cauſes; the  
reſtraints lately laid on their trade, by  
which the bringing of foreign gold and ſil-  
ver into the Colonies was prevented ; the  
prohibition of making paper money among  
themſelves; and then demanding a new  
and heavy tax by ftamps; taking away,  
at the ſame time, trials by juries, and re-  
fuſing to receive and hear their humble  
petitions. _  
  
Q. Don&#x27;t you think they would ſubmit  
to the ſtamp-aR, if it was modified, the  
  
| C 2 obnoxious  
  
22-3  
  
obnoxious parts taken out, and the duty  
  
  
ment?  
A. No; they will never ſubmit to it.  
N What do you think is the reaſon  
that the people of America increaſe faſter  
  
  
A. Becauſe they marry younger, and  
more generally.  
  
Q. Why fo?  
A. Becauſe any young couple that are  
  
  
own, on which they can raiſe a family.  
Q. Are not the lower rank of people  
  
  
lend! ?  
A. They may be Þ, if they are ſober  
  
  
Q. What is your opinion of a future  
  
  
Americans receive it?  
  
  
not pay it.  
Q. Have not you heard of the reſolu-  
tions of this Houſe, and of the. Houſe of  
  
  
relating to America, including a power to  
tax the people there?  
  
  
tions,  
Q. What  
  
[ 73 ]  
  
Q. What will be the opinion of the  
Americans on thoſe reſolutions ?  
  
A. They will think them unconſtitu-  
tional and unjuſt. 6p  
  
Q. Was it an opinion in America be-  
fore 1763, that the parliament had no  
right to lay taxes and duties there ?  
  
A. I never heard any objection to the  
right of laying duties to regulate com-  
merce ; but a right to lay internal taxes  
was never ſuppoſed to be in parliament,  
as we are not repreſented there.  
  
Q. On what do you found your opinion,  
that the people in America made any ſuch  
diſtinCtion ? |  
  
A. I know that whenever the ſubje&amp;  
has occurred in converſation where I have  
been preſent, it has appeared to be the  
opinion of every one, that we could not  
be taxed in a parliament where we were  
not repreſented. But the payment of du-  
ties laid by act of parliament, as regula-  
tions of commerce was never diſputed.  
  
Q. But can you name any act of aſſem-  
bly, or public a&amp; of any of your govern-  
ments, that made ſuch diſtin&amp;tion ?  
  
A. I do not know that there was any;  
I think there was never an occaſion to  
make any ſuch act, till now that you have  
attempted to tax us; that has occaſioned  
reſolutions of afſembly, declaring the diſ-  
  
| tinction,  
  
  
  
Q What then could occaſion conver-  
ſations on that ſubject before that time.  
  
A. There was in 1754 a propoſition  
made (I think it came from hence) that  
in caſe of a war, which was then appre-  
hended, the governors of the Colonies  
  
  
troops, building of forts, and taking every  
other neceſſary meaſure for the general  
defence; and fhould draw on the treaſury  
here for the fums expended, which were  
afterwards to be raiſed in the Colonies by  
  
  
of parliament. This occaſioned a good  
deal of converſation on the ſubject, and  
the general opinion was, that the parlia-  
ment neither would nor could lay any tax  
on us, till we were duly repreſented in  
parliament, becauſe it was not juſt, nor  
agreeable to the nature of an Engliſh con-  
ſtitution. |  
Q. Don&#x27;t you know there was a time  
in New-York, when it was under con-  
  
  
a deficiency ariſing from the aſſembly&#x27;s  
refuſing or neglecting to raiſe the neceſ-  
ſary ſupplies for the ſupport of the civil  
government?  
  
  
  
*  
W  
  
[ 25 ]  
A. I never heard of it. |  
Q. There was ſuch an application un-  
der conſideration in New-York; and do  
you apprehend they could ſuppoſe the  
right of parliament to lay a tax in America  
was only local, and confined to the caſe  
of a deficiency in a particular Colony, by  
a refuſal of its aſſembly to raiſe the neceſ-  
ary ſapplies? 5  
A. They could not ſuppoſe ſuch a caſe,  
as that the aſſembly would not raiſe the  
neceſſary ſupplies to ſupport its own go-  
vernment. An aſſembly that would re-  
fuſe it muſt want common ſenſe, which  
cannot be ſuppoſed. I think there was  
never any ſuch caſe at New-York, and that  
4t muſt be a miſrepreſentation, or the fact  
muſt be miſunderſtood. I know there  
have been ſome attempts, by miniſterial  
inſtructions from hence, to oblige the aſ-  
ſemblies to ſettle permanent ſalaries on  
governors, which they wiſely refuſed to  
do; but I believe no aſſembly of New-  
York, or any other Colony, ever refuſed  
-duly to ſupport government by proper al-  
lowances, from time to time, to public  
comcers. |  
Q. But in caſe a governor, acting by  
inſtruction, ſhould call on an aſſembly to  
raiſe the neceſſary ſupplies, and the aſſem-  
_ -bly ſhould refuſe to do it, do you Ls  
think  
  
  
164  
think it would then be for the good of the  
people of the colony, as well as neceſſary  
to government, that the parliament ſhould  
tax them?  
  
A. Ido not think it would be dane  
If an aſſembly could poſſibly be ſo abſurd  
as to refuſe raiſing the ſupplies requiſite  
for the maintenance of government amon  
them, they could not long remain in ack  
a ſituation; the diſorders and confuſion  
occaſioned by it muſt ſoon bring them to  
reaſon. TY  
  
Q. If it ſhould not, ought not the  
right to be in Great-Britain of applying  
  
  
A. A right only to be uſed in ſuch a |  
caſe, I ſhould have no objection to, fup-  
poſing it to be uſed merely for the good of  
  
  
Q. But who is to judge of that, Bri-  
tain or the Colony ? |  
A. Thoſe that feel can beſt judge. |  
You fay the Colonies have always |  
ſubmitted to external taxes, and object to  
the right of parliament only in laying in-  
  
is any kind of difference between the two  
taxes to the Colony on which they may  
be laid?  
  
A. I think rhe difference 1s very great.  
An external tax 1s a duty laid on _—  
| Itles  
  
| 1-27 4  
dities imported ; that duty is added to the  
firſt coſt, and other charges on the com-  
modity, and when it is offered to fale,  
makes a part of the price. If the people  
do not like it at that price, they refuſe it  
they are not obliged to pay it. But an in-  
ternal tax is forced from the people with-  
out their conſent, if not laid by their own  
repreſentatives. The ſtamp- act ſays, we  
ſhall have no commerce, make no exchange  
of property with each other, neither pur-  
chaſe nor grant, nor recover debts; we  
ſhall neither marry nor make our wills,  
unleſs we pay ſuch and ſuch ſums, and  
thus it is intended to extort our money  
from us, or ruin us by the conſequences  
  
of refuſing to pay it. 45  
  
Q. But ſuppoſing the internal tax or  
duty to be laid on the neceſſaries of life  
imported into your colony, will not that  
be the ſame thing in its effects as an in-  
ternal tax?  
  
A. I do not know a ſingle article im-  
ported into the Northern Colonies, but  
What they can either do without, or make  
themſelves. |  
  
Q. Don&#x27;t you think cloth from England  
abſolutely neceſſary to them?  
  
A. No, by no means abſolutely neceſ-  
fary ; with induſtry and good management,  
  
they may very well ſupply themſelves with  
all they want. WED, |  
D Q. Will  
  
  
Q. Will it not take a long time to eſta-  
bliſh that manufacture among them; and  
muſt they not in the mean while ſuffer  
greatly?  
  
A. I think not. They have made a  
ſurpriſing progreſs already. And I am of  
opinion, that before their old clothes are  
worn out, they will have new ones of  
their own making.  
  
Q. Can they poſſibly find wool enough  
  
  
A. They have taken ſteps to increaſe  
the wool. They entered into general  
combinations to eat no more lamb, and  
very few lambs were killed laſt year. This  
courſe perſiſted in, will ſoon make a pro-  
digious difference in the quantity of wool.  
And the eſtabliſhing of great manufacto-  
  
  
is not neceſſary, as it is where the buſineſs  
is to be carried on for the purpoſes of  
trade. The people will all ſpin, and  
work for themſelves, in their own houſes.  
  
Q. Can there be wool and manufacture  
  
  
A. In three years, I think, there may.  
  
. Does not the ſeverity of the winter,  
  
in the Northern Colonies, occaſion the  
wool to be of bad quality ?  
  
  
good, 8  
| Q. In  
  
\
  
[ 19 ]  
  
Q: In the more Southern Colonies, as  
in Virginia, don&#x27;t you know that the wool  
is coarſe, and only a kind of hair?  
  
A. I don&#x27;t know it. I never heard it.  
Yet I have been ſometimes in Virginia. I  
cannot ſay I ever took particular notice of  
the wool there, but I believe it is good,  
though I cannot ſpeak poſitively of it;  
but Virginia, and the Colonies ſouth of it,  
have leſs occaſion for wool; their winters  
are ſhort, and not very ſevere, and they  
can very well clothe themſelves with linen  
and cotton of their own raiſing for the reſt  
of the year. 5  
Q. Are not the people in the more  
Northern Colonies obliged to fodder their  
ſheep all the winter? ;  
A. In ſome of the moſt Northern Colo-  
- nies they may be obliged to do it ſome  
part of the winter.  
  
Q. Conſidering the reſolutions of par-  
liament, as to the right, do you think,  
if the ſtamp- act is repealed, that the  
North-Americans will be ſatisfied ?  
  
A. I believe they will.  
  
Q. Why do you think ſo?  
  
A. I think the reſolutions of right will  
give them very little concern, if they are  
never attempted to be carried into prac-  
tice. The Colonies will probably conſi-  
der themſelves in the ſame ſituation, in

that reſ ect, with Ireland; they know you  
  
re-  
land, but you never exerciſe it. And  
they may believe you never will exerciſe  
it in the Colonies, any more than in Ire-  
land, unleſs on ſome very extraordinary  
occaſion, |  
  
Q. But who are to be the judges of  
that extraordinary occaſion ? Is not the  
parliament ?  
  
A. Though the parliament may judge  
of the occaſion, the people will think it  
can never exerciſe ſuch right, till repre-  
ſentatives from the Colonies are admitted  
into parliament, and that whenever the  
occaſion ariſes, repreſentatives will be  
ordered.  
  
Q. Did you never hear that Maryland,  
during the laſt war, had refuſed to furniſh  
a quota towards the common defence ?  
  
A. Maryland has been much miſrepre-  
ſented in that matter. Maryland, to my  
knowledge, never refuſed to contribute, or  
grant aids to the crown. The aſſemblies  
every year, during the war, voted con-  
ſiderable ſums, and formed bills to raiſe  
them. The bills were, according to the  
conſtitution of that province, ſent up to  
the council, or upper houſe, for concur-  
  
  
governor, in order to be enacted into laws.  
  
Unhappy  
  
ſ 2x ]  
  
Z VUnhappy diſputes between the two houſes  
4 ariſing, from the defects of that conſtitu-  
tion principally, rendered all the bills but  
one or two abortive. The proprietary&#x27;s  
council rejected them, It is true, Mary-  
land did not contribute its proportion,  
but it was, in my opinion, the fault of  
the government, not of the people,  
Q. Was it not talked of in the other  
provinces as a proper meaſure to apply to  
parliament to compel them ? a  
A. I have heard ſuch diſcourſe £ but as  
it was well known, that the people were  
not to blame, no ſuch application was  
ever made, nor any ſtep taken towards it.  
Q. Was it not propoſed at a public  
meeting? |  
A, Not that I Know ok.  
Q. Do you remember the aboliſhing of  
the paper currency in New-England, by  
act of aſſembly? Ho |  
A. I do remember its being aboliſhed,  
in the Maſſachuſett&#x27;s Bay, 4  
Q. Was not Lieutenant-Governor Hut-  
chinſon principally concerned in that  
- trantaGione  
A. I have heard fo.  
Q Was it not at that time a very un-  
popular law ? f |  
A. I believe it might, though I can  
ſay little about it, as I lived at a diſtance  
  
N Q. Was  
  
from that province.  
  
[ 22  
  
Q. Was not the ſcarcity of gold and  
filver an argument uſed againſt aboliſhing  
the paper ?  
) d  
  
Q. What is the preſent opinion there  
of that law? Is it as unpopular as it was  
at firſt? Wah  
  
A. I think it is not.  
  
Q. Have not inſtructions from hence  
been ſometimes ſent over to governors,  
highly oppreſſive and unpolitical ?  
  
A. Yes. +  
  
Q. Have not ſome governors diſpenſed  
with them for that reaſon ?  
  
A. Yes; I have heard fo,  
  
  
controuling power of parliament to regu-  
late the commerce?  
  
A. No. | 7  
  
Q. Can any thing leſs than a military  
force carry the ſtamp- act into execution?  
A. I do not lee ha a military force  
can be applied to that purpoſe.  
  
Q. Why may it not? 1  
A. Suppoſe a military force ſent into  
America, they will find nobody in arms  
  
  
force a man to take ſtamps who chuſes to  
do without them. They will not find a  
rebellion ; they may indeed make one.  
Q. If the act is not repealed, what do  
you think will be the conſequences ?  
  
  
I  
A. A total loſs of the reſpect and af-  
fection the people of America bear to this  
country, and of all the commerce that  
depends on that reſpect and affection.  
. How can the commerce be affected?  
A. You will find, that if the act is not  
repealed, they will take very little of your  
manufactures in a ſhort time. |  
Q. Is it in their power to do without  
them ? Z  
A. I think they may very well do  
without them. PAN  
Q. Is it their intereſt not to take them ?  
A. The goods they take from Britain  
are either neceſſaries, mere conveniences,  
or ſuperfluities. The firſt, as cloth, &amp;c.  
with a little induſtry they can make at  
home; the ſecond they can do without,  
till they are able to provide them among  
themſelves ; and the laſt, which are much  
the greateſt part, they will ſtrike off im-  
mediately. They are mere articles of  
faſhion, purchaſed and conſumed, becauſe  
the faſhion in a reſpected country, but  
will now be deteſted and rejected. The  
people have already ſtruck off, by general  
agreement, the uſe of all goods faſhiona-  
ble in mournings, and many thouſand  
pounds worth are ſent back as unſaleable.  
Q. Is it their intereſt to make cloth at  
home?  
A.I  
  
f 24 1  
  
A. I think they may at preſent get if  
cheaper from Britain, I mean of the ſame  
fineneſs and neatneſs of workmanſhip ;  
but when one conſiders other circum-  
ſtances, the reſtraints on their trade, and  
the difficulty of making remittances, it is  
their intereſt to make every thing.  
Q. Suppoſe an act of internal regula-  
tions connected with a tax, how would  
they receive it ? get  
A. Irhink it would be objected to.  
Q. Then no regulation with a tax  
would be ſubmitted to ?  
A. Their opinion is, that when aids to  
the Crown are wanted, they are to be aſked  
of the ſeveral aſſemblies, according to the  
old eſtabliſhed uſage, who will, as they  
always have done, grant them freely.  
And that their money ought not to be  
given away, without their conſent, b  
perſons at a diſtance, unacquainted wit!  
their circumſtances and abilities. The  
granting aids to the Crown, is the only  
means they have of recommending them-  
ſelves to their ſovereign, and they think it  
extremely hard and unjuſt, that a body of  
men, in which they have no repreſenta-  
tives, ſhould make a merit to itſelf of giv-  
ing and granting what is not its own, but  
theirs, and deprive them of a right they  
eſteem of the utmoſt value and import-  
ance,  
  
[25]  
nice, as if is the ſecurity of all their other  
rights. ek,  
Qi. But is not the poſt-office, which  
they have long received, a tax as well as  
a regulation?  
A. No; the money paid for the poſt-  
  
  
tax ; it is merely a quantum meruit for a  
fervice dont; no perſon is compellable to  
pay the money; if he does not chuſe to  
receive the ſervice. A man may ſtill, as  
before the act, ſend. his letter by a ſervant,  
a ſpecial meſſenger, or a friend, if he  
thinks it cheaper and ſafer.  
Q. But do they not conſider the regu-  
tations of the poſt-office, by the a&amp;t of  
laſt year as a tax?  
  
A. By the regulations of laſt year the  
rate of poſtage was generally abated near  
  
  
they certainly cannot confider ſuch abate-  
  
ment as a tax.  
  
| __ an exciſe was laid by parliament,  
  
which they might likewiſe avoid paying,  
  
by not conſuming the articles exciſed,  
  
would they then not object to it ?  
A. They would certainly object to it,  
  
  
vice done, and is merely an aid which  
  
  
it, and can be granted for them by no  
E others

— — ye  
  
[ 26 ]  
others whatſozver, whom they have not  
impowered for that purpoſe. 5  
  
Q. You ſay they do not object to the  
right of parliament, in laying duties on  
goods to be paid on their importation;  
now, is there any kind of difference be-  
tween a duty on the importation of goods,  
and an exciſe on their conſumption?  
A. Ves; a very material one; an ex-  
ciſe, for the reaſons I have juſt mentioned,  
they think you can have no right to lay  
within their country. But the , ſea is  
yours; you maintain, by your fleets, the  
ſafety of navigation in it, and keep it clear  
of pirates; you may have therefore a na-  
tural and equitable right to ſome toll or  
duty on merchandizes carried through that  
part of your dominions, towards defray-  
ing the expence you are at in ſhips to  
maintain the ſafety of that carriage.  
Q. Does this reaſoning hold in the caſe  
of a duty laid on the produce of their  
lands exported ? And would they not then  
object to ſuch a duty? | 157  
A. If it tended to make the produce ſo  
much dearer abroad as to leſſen the de-  
mand for it, to be ſure they would object  
te {ich a duty; not to your right of lay-  
ing it, but they would complain of it ag  
a burthen, and petition you to lighten it.  
  
Q. Is not the duty paid on the tobacco  
  
exported a duty of that kind?  
| Ls 3 A. That,  
  
[ 27 }  
  
A. That, I think, is only on tobacco  
carried coaſtwiſe from one Colony to ano-  
ther, and appropriated as a fund for ſup-  
porting the college at Williamſburgh, in  
Virginia. |  
  
Q. Have not the aſſemblies in the  
Weſt-Indies the ſame natural rights with  
thoſe in North-America ?  
  
A. Undoubtedly,  
  
Q. And is there not a tax laid there on  
their ſugars exported ?  
  
A. I am not much acquainted with the  
Weſt-Indies, but the duty of four and a  
half per cent. on ſugars exported, was, I  
  
believe, granted by their own aſſemblies,  
Q. How much is the poll-tax in your  
province laid on unmarried men ?  
  
A. It is, I think Fifteen Shillings, to  
be paid by every ſingle freeman, upwards  
of twenty-one years old. „  
Q. What is the annual amount of all  
the taxes in Pennſylvania? |  
  
A. I ſuppoſe about 20,000 Pounds  
ſterling. | ep a .  
  
Q. Suppoſing the ſtamp- act continued,  
and enforced, do you imagine that ill-hu-  
  
mour will induce the Americans to give as  
much for worſe manufactures of their own,  
and uſe them, preferably to better of ours?  
  
A. Ves, I think ſo. People will pay  
as freely to gratify one paſſion as another,  
their reſentment as their pride.  
  
E2 Q. Would

[ 28 ]  
Q.: Would the people at Boſton, dife  
continue their trade ? 825  
A. The merchants are a very ſmall  
number, compared with the body of the  
people, and muſt diſcontinue their trade,  
if nobody will buy their goods,  
2. What are the body of the people in  
the Colonies? ; ?  
  
A. They are farmers, huſbandmen or  
planters. f | 3.1 6%  
Q. Would they ſuffer the produce of  
their lands ies 4  
A. No; but they would not raiſe fo  
much. They woke manufacture more,  
and plough leſs, |  
  
Q; Would they live without the ad-  
miniſtration of juſtice in civil matters, and  
ſuffer all the inconveniencies of ſuch a  
ſituation for any conſiderable time, rather  
than take the ſtamps, ſuppoſing the  
ſtamps were protected by a ſufficient force,  
where every one might have them? :  
  
A. I think the ſuppoſition impractica-  
ble, that the ſtamps ſhould be ſo protected  
as that every one might have them. The  
act requires ſub-diſtributors to be ap-  
  
pointed in every county town, diſtrict and  
village, and they would be neceſſary. But  
the principal diſtributors, who were to  
have had a conſiderable profit on the whole,  
| haye not thought it worth while to con-

ble to find ſub-diftributors fit to be truſted,  
who, for the trifling profit that muſt  
come to their ſhare, would incur. the  
odium, and run the hazard that would  
attend it; and if they could be found, I  
think it impracticable to protect the  
ſtamps in fo ANY diſtant and remote  
Mo. ---.-  
  
Q. But in places where they could be  
  
protected, would not the people uſe them  
rather than remain in ſuch a ſituation, un-  
able to obtain any right, or recover, by  
law, any debt?  
A. It is hard to ſay what they would  
do. I-can only judge what other people  
will think, and how they will act, by  
what I feel within myſelf. I have a great  
many debts due to me in America, and I  
had rather they ſhould remain unreco-  
verable by any law, than ſubmit to the  
ſtamp- act. They will be debts of honour.  
It is my opinion the people will either  
continue in that ſituation, or find ſome  
Way to extricate themſelves, perhaps by  
generally agreeing to proceed in the  
courts without ſtamps.  
  
Q. What do you think a ſufficient .  
tary force to protect the diſtribution of  
the ſtamps in every part of America?  
  
  
- — — — u . om * — =  
  
  
  
  
301  
  
A. A very great force; I can&#x27;t ſay what,  
if the diſpoſition of America is for a gene-  
ral reſiſtance, |  
  
Q. What is the number of men in  
America able to bear arms, or of die  
W militia ?  
  
A. There are, I ſuppoſe, at leaſt— |  
[Ruefion ohjected to. 2 e withdrew. Called |  
in again.]  
  
Q. Is the American ſtamp- act an n equal  
tax on that country?  
  
A. I think not.  
  
Q. Why ſo?  
  
A. The greateſt part of the money muſt  
ariſe from law-ſuits for the recovery of  
debts, and be paid by the lower ſort of  
people, who were too poor eaſily to pay  
their debts. It is therefore a heavy tax  
on the poor, and a tax upon them for be-  
ing poor.  
  
Q. But will not this jncreaſe of expence  
be a means of leſſening the number of  
law-ſuits?  
  
A. I think not; for as the LY all fall  
upon the debtor, and are to be paid by  
him, they would be no diſcouragement to  
the — to bring his action.  
  
Q. Would it not have the effect of ex-  
ceſſive uſury f  
A. Ves, as an oppreſſion of the 88

[ 31 1  
  
Q. How many ſhips are there laden  
annually in North-America with flax-ſeed  
for Ireland? — So LW 1 OTE  
A. I cannot ſpeak to the number of  
ſhips, but I know that in 1752, 10,000  
hogſheads of flax-ſeed, each containing 7  
buſhels, were exported from Philadelphia  
to Ireland. I ſuppoſe the quantity is  
greatly increaſed fince that time; and it  
is underſtood that the exportation from  
New-York is equal to that from Phila-  
delphia. | b  
  
Q. What becomes of the flax that  
grows with that flax-ſeed?  _  
  
A. They manufacture ſome into coarſe,  
and ſome into a middling kind of linen.  
Qi. Are there any ſlitting-mills in Ame-  
rica ? 6+ 8 1  
  
A. I think there are three, but I be-  
lieve only one at preſent employed. I  
ſuppoſe they will all be ſet to work, if  
the interruption of the trade continues.  
  
Q. Are there any fulling mills there?  
A. A great many.  
  
Q. Did you never hear that a great  
quantity of ſtockings were contracted for,  
for the army, during the war, and manu-  
  
factured in Philadelphia?  
  
A. I have heard ſo.  
  
Q. It the ſtamp- act ſhould be repealed,  
would not the Americans think they  
could  
  
L 32 ]  
could oblige the parliament to repeal e  
external tax-law now in force ? |  
  
A. It is hard to anſwer queſtions of  
  
what people at ſuch a diſtance will think.  
  
2 But what do you. imagine they will  
  
think were the motives of repealing the  
  
act?  
  
A. I ſuppoſe they will think that it  
was repealed from a 3 of its in-  
  
expediency; and they will rely upon it,  
that while the ſame inexpediency fabfifts,  
you will never attempt to make ſuch ano-  
ther.  
  
Q. What do you mean by its inexpe=  
diency?  
  
A. I mean its inexpediency o on ſeveral  
accounts; the poverty and inability | of  
thoſe who were to pay the tax; the gene-  
ral diſcontent it has occaſioned ; and the  
impracticability of enforcing it.  
  
Q. If the act ſhould be repealed, and |  
the legiflature ſhould ſhew its reſentment  
to the oppoſers of the ſtamp- act, would  
the Colonies acquieſce in the authority of  
the legiſlature ? What is your opinicin they  
TOO do?  
  
. I don&#x27;t doubt at all, that if the le-  
—_ repeal the ſtamp- act, the Colo-  
nies will acquieſce in the authority.  
  
Qi. But if the legiſlature ſhould think  
fit to aſcertain its right to lay taxes, by  
ny  
  
1  
  
  
S001  
any act laying a ſmall tax, contrary to  
their opinion, would they ſubmit to pay  
the tax?  
  
A. The proceedings of the people in  
  
  
together. The proceedings of the aſſem-  
blies have been very different from thoſe  
of the mobs, and ſhould be diſtinguiſhed,  
as having no connection with each other.  
he aſſemblies have only peaceably re-  
ſolved what they take to be their rights ;  
they have taken no meaſures for oppoſition  
by force ; they have not built a fort, raiſed  
a man, or provided a grain of ammunition,  
in order to ſuch oppoſition.—The ring-  
leaders of riots they think ought to be  
puniſhed ; they would puniſh them them-  
  
  
niſhed, as otherwiſe peaceable people have  
no ſecurity of perſon or eſtate. But as to  
an internal tax, how ſmall ſoever, laid by  
the legiſlature here on the people there,  
  
  
legiſlature, I think it will never be ſubmit-  
  
  
They do not confiderit as at all neceſſary for  
  
  
becauſe they are, and always have been,  
ready to raiſe money by taxes among  
themſelves, and to grant large ſums, equal

the Crown.—They have not only granted  
equal to their abilities, but, during all the  
laſt war, they granted far beyond their  
abilities, and beyond their proportion with  
this country, you yourſelves being judges,  
to the amount of many hundred thouſand  
pounds, and this they did freely and rea-  
dily, only on a fort of promiſe from the  
ſecretary of ſtate, that it ſhould be recom-  
mended to parliament to make them com-  
penſation. It was accordingly recom-  
mended to parliament, in the moſt ho-  
nourable manner, for them. America  
has been greatly miſrepreſented and abuſed  
here, in papers, and pamphlets, and  
ſpeeches, as ungrateful, and unreaſonable,  
and unjuſt, in having put this nation to  
immenſe expence for their defence, and  
refuſing to bear any part of that expence.  
The Colonies raiſed, paid, and clothed,  
  
near 25000 men during the laſt war, a  
number equal to thoſe ſent from Britain,  
and far beyond their proportion; they  
went deeply into debt in doing this, and  
all their taxes and eſtates are mortgaged,  
  
for many years to come, for diſcharging  
that debt. Government here was at that  
time very ſenfible of this. The Colonies  
were recommended to parltament. Every  
year the king ſent down to the houſe a  
written meſlage to this purpoſe, That his  
  
Maj eſty,  
  
L283  
Majeſty, being highly ſenſible of the zeal  
and vigour with which his faithful ſubjects  
  
  
oſſeſſions, recommended it to the houſe  
to take the ſame into conſideration, and  
enable him to give them a proper com-  
penſation. You will find thoſe meſſages  
on your own journals every year of the  
  
  
ingly give 200,000 Pounds annually to  
the Crown, to be diſtributed in ſuch com-  
penſation to the Colonies. This is the  
ſtrongeſt of all proofs that the Colonies,  
far from being unwilling to bear a ſhare  
of the burthen, did exceed their propor-  
tion; for if they had done leſs, or had  
only equalled their proportion, there  
would have been no room or reaſon for  
compenſation.— Indeed the ſums reim-  
  
  
to the expence they incurred beyond their  
proportion ; but they never murmured at  
that, they eſteemed their Sovereign&#x27;s ap-  
probation of their zeal and fidelity, and  
the approbation of this houſe, far beyond  
any other kind of compenſation ; there-  
fore there was no occaſion for this act, to  
force money from a willing people ; they  
had not refuſed giving money for the pur-  
poſes of the act; no requiſition had been

to do what could reaſonably be expected  
from them, and in this light they wiſh to  
be conſidered.  
  
Q. But ſuppoſe Great-Britain ſhould be  
engaged in a war in Europe, would North-  
Ane contribute to the ſupport of it?  
  
. I do think they would, as. far as  
cmeir circumſtances would permit. They  
conſider themſelves as a part of the Britiſh  
empire, and as having one common in-  
tereſt with it; they may be looked on  
here as foreigners, but they do not con-  
ſider themſelves as ſuch. They are zea-  
lous for the honour and proſperity of this  
nation, and, while they are well uſed,  
will always be ready to ſupport it, as far  
as their little power goes. In 1739 they  
were called upon to aſſiſt in the expedition  
againſt Carthagena, and they ſent 3000  
men to join your army. It is true Car-  
thagena is in America, but as remote from  
the Northern Colonies as if it had been in  
Europe. They make no diſtinction of  
wars, as to their duty of afliſting in them,  
T know the laſt war is commonly ſpoke of  
  
ore 2s entered into for the defence, or  
for the ſake of the people of America, I  
think it is quite miſunderſtood. It began  
about the limits between Canada and  
Nova-Scotia, about territories to which  
  
the

the Crown indeed laid claim, but were  
not claimed by any Britiſh Colony ; none  
of the lands bad been granted to any Co-  
toniſt; we had therefore no particular  
concern or intereſt in that diſpute, As to  
the Ohio, the conteſt there began about  
your right of trading in the Indian coun-  
try, a right you had by the treaty of  
Utrecht, which the French infringed  
they ſeized the traders and their goods,  
which were your manufactures ; they took  
a fort which a company of your mer-  
chants, and their factors and correſpond-  
  
  
trade. Braddock was fone with an army  
  
  
here as another incroachment on the  
King&#x27;s territory) and to protect your trade.  
It was not till after his defeat that the  
Colonies were attacked. They were be-  
fore in perfect peace with both French and  
Indians; the troops were not therefore  
ſent for their defence. The trade with  
the Indians, though carried on in Ame-  
rica, is not an American intereſt. The  
  
  
planters; ſcarce any thing that they raiſe  
or produce 1s an article of commerce with  
the Indians. The Indian trade is a Bri-  
tiſh intereſt; it is carried on with Britiſh  
manufactures, for the profit of Britiſh

merchants and manufacturers; therefore  
the war, as it commenced for the defence  
of territories of the Crown, the property  
of no American, and for the defence of a  
trade purely Britiſh, was really a Britiſh  
war—and yet the people of America made  
no ſcruple of contributing their utmoſt  
towards carrying it on, and bringing it to  
a happy concluſion.  
  
Q. Do you think then that the taking  
poſſeſſion of the King&#x27;s territorial rights,  
  
  
A. Not particularly, but conjointly a  
Britiſh and an American intereſt. mw  
  
  
ing war, the war with Spain, was entered  
into for the ſake of America; was it not  
occaſioned by captures made in the Ame-  
rican ſeas? 3  
  
A. Yes; captures of ſhips carrying on  
the Britiſh trade there, with Britiſh ma-  
nufactures. 3 88  
Q. Was not the late war with the In-  
dians, ſince the peace with France, a war  
  
  
A. Yes; it was more particularly for  
America than the former, but it was ra-  
ther a conſequence or remains of the for-  
mer war, the Indians not having been  
  
  
borg  
  
[39]  
bore by much the greateſt ſhare of the ex-  
pence. It was put an end to by the army  
under General Bouquet ; there were not  
above 300 regulars in that army, and  
above 1000 Pennſylvanians.  
  
Q. Is it not neceſſary to ſends troops to  
America, to defend the Americans againſt  
the Indians? |  
  
A. No, by no means; it never was  
neceſſary. They defended themſelves when  
they were but an handful, and the Indians  
  
  
ally gained ground, and have driven the  
Indians over the mountains, without any  
troops ſent to their aſſiſtance from this  
country. And can it be thought neceſſary  
now to ſend troops for their defence from  
thoſe diminiſhed Indian tribes, when the  
Colonies are become ſo populous, and ſo  
ſtrong ? There is not the leaſt occaſion for  
it; they are very able to defend them-  
ſelves. .  
  
Q. Do you ſay there were no more than  
zoo regular troops employed in the late  
Indian war? e  
  
  
of Pennſylvania, which was the chief part  
of the war that affected the Colonies.  
There were garriſons at Niagara, Fort  
Detroit, and thoſe remote poſts kept for  
the ſake of your trade; I did not reckon  
  
them,

them, but I believe that on the whole the  
number of Americans, or provincial troops,  
employed in the war, was greater than  
that of the regulars: I am not certain,  
but I think ſo;  
  
Q. Do you think the aſſemblies have a  
right to levy money on the ſubje&amp; there;  
to grant to the Crown ?  
  
A. I certainly think ſo; they have al-  
ways done it. 3  
  
Q. Are they acquainted with the de-  
claration of rights? And do they know  
that, by that ſtatute, money is not to be  
raiſed on the ſubject but by conſent of par-  
lament? METS |  
  
A. They are very well acquainted  
with it.  
  
Q. How then can they think they have  
a right to levy money for the Crown, or  
for any other than local purpoſes? _  
  
A. They underſtand that clauſe to re-  
late to ſubjects only within the realm;  
that no money can be levied on them for  
the Crown, but by conſent of parliament.  
The Colonies are not ſuppoſed to be  
within the realm; they have aſſemblies  
of their own, which are their parliaments,  
and they are, in that reſpect, in the ſame  
ſituation with Ireland. When money is  
to be raiſed for the Crown upon the ſub-  
ject in Ireland, or in the Colonies, the  
conſent  
  
[ ar 1  
  
conſent is given in the parliament of lre-  
land, or in the aflemblies of the Colonies.  
They think the parliament of Great-Bri-  
tain cannot properly give that conſent till  
it has repreſentatives from America; for  
the petition of right expreſsly ſays, it is  
to be by common conſent in parliament,  
and the people of America have no repre-  
ſentatives in parliament, to make a part  
of that common conſent. |  
Q. If the ſtamp- act ſhould be repealed,  
and an act ſhould paſs, ordering the aſſem-  
  
  
ferers by the riots, would they obey it?  
  
A. That is a queſtion I cannot anſwer.  
  
Q. Suppoſe the King ſhould require  
the Colonies to grant a revenue, and the  
_ parliament ſhould be againſt their doing  
it, do they think they can grant a re-  
venue to the King, without the conſent of  
the parliament of Great-Britain ?  
  
A. That is a deep queſtion.—As to my  
own opinion, I ſhould think myſelf at li-  
berty to do it, and ſhould do it, if I liked  
  
the occaſion.

Q. If the a&amp; ſhould paſs, requiring the  
American aſſemblies to make compenſa-  
tion to the ſufferers, and they ſhould diſ-  
obey it, and then the parliament ſhould,  
by another act, lay an internal tax, would  
was then obey it?  
  
. The people will pay no internal tax;  
and 7 think an act to oblige the aſſemblies  
to make compenſation is unneceſſary, for  
I am ot opinion, that as ſoon as the pre-  
ſent heats are abated, they will take the  
matter into conſideration, and if it is right  
to be done, they will do it of themſelves.  
  
. Do not letters often come into the  
polt- nerd in America, directed to ſome  
inland town where no poſt goes ?  
  
A. YES.  
  
Can any private perſon take u  
thoſe letters, and carry them as directed?  
  
A. Yes; any friend of the perſon may  
do it, paying the poſtage that has accrued.  
  
But muſt not he pay an additional  
poſtage for the diſtance to ſuch inland  
town?  
  
n  
  
Q. Can the poſt-maſter anſwer deliver-  
ing the letter, without being paid ſuch  
additional poſtage ?  
  
A. Certainly he can demand nothing,  
where he does no ſervice.  
  
Q. Suppoſe a perſon, being far from  
  
home, finds a letter in a poſt- office di-  
rected  
  
[ 43 ]  
rected to him, and he lives in a place to  
which the poſt generally goes, and the  
letter is directed to that place, will the  
poſt-maſter deliver him the letter, with-  
out his paying the poſtage receivable at  
the place to which the letter is directed.  
  
A. Yes; the office cannot demand  
poſtage for a letter that it does not carry,  
or farther than it does carry it.  
  
Q. Are not ferrymen in America obliged,  
by act of parliament, to carry over the  
poſts without pay?  
  
8  
  
Q. Is not this a tax on the ferrymen ?  
  
A. They do not conſider it as ſuch, as  
they have an advantage from perſons tra-  
velling with the poſt.  
  
Qi. If the ſtamp- act ſhould be repealed  
and the Crown ſhould make a requiſition  
to the Colonies for a ſum of money,  
would they grant it?! |  
  
A. I believe they would.  
  
Q. Why do you think ſo ? 9  
  
A. I can ſpeak for the Colony I live  
in; I had it in inſtruction from the aſſem-  
bly to aſſure the miniſtry, that as they al-  
Ways had done, ſo they ſhould always  
think it their duty to grant ſuch aids to  
the Crown as were ſuitable to their cir-  
cumſtances and abilities, whenever called  
upon for the purpoſe, in the uſual coniti-  
  
(7.2 tutional  
  
[ 44 ]  
tutional manner ; and I had the honour of  
communicating this inſtruction to that  
honourable gentleman then miniſter.  
  
Q. Would they do this for a Britiſh  
concern ; as ſuppoſe a war in ſome part of  
Europe, that did not affe&amp; them ?  
  
A. Yes, for any thing that concerned  
the general deer | They conſider them-  
ſelves as a part of the whole.  
  
Q. What is the uſual conſtitutional  
manner of calling on the Colonies for  
aids ?  
  
A. A letter from the ſecretary of ſtate,  
Q. ls this all you mean, a letter from  
  
the ſecretary of ſtate ?  
  
A. I mean the uſual way of requiſition,  
in a circular letter from the ſecretary of  
ſtate, by his Majeſty&#x27;s command, reciting  
the occaſion, and recommending it to the  
Colonies to grant ſuch aids .as became  
their loyalty, and were ſuitable to their  
abilities.  
  
Q. Did the ſecretary of ſtate ever write  
for money for the Crown ? |  
  
A. The requiſitions have been to raiſe,  
clothe and pay men, which cannot be done  
without money.  
  
Q. Would they grant money RN if  
called on ?  
  
A. In my opinion they would. money  
as well as men, when they have money,  
or can make it.  
  
  
„  
  
Q. If the parliament ſhould repeal the  
ſtamp- act, will the aſſembly of Pennſyl-  
vania reſcind their reſolutions ?  
  
A. I think not,  
  
Q. Before there was any thought of the  
ſtamp- act, did they wiſh for a repreſenta»  
tion in parliament ?  
  
A. No.  
  
Q. Don&#x27;t you know that there is, in the  
Pennſylvania charter, an expreſs reſerva-  
  
tion of the right of parliament to lay taxes  
there ?  
  
  
ter, by which the King grants that he  
will levy no taxes on the inhabitants, un-  
leſs it be with the conſent of the aſſembly,  
or by act of parliament.  
  
Q. How then could the aſſembly of  
  
  
ment of their rights?  
  
  
ſame charter, and otherwiſe, they are in-  
titled to all the privileges and liberties of  
Engliſhmen ; they find in the great char-  
ters, and the petition and declaration of  
rights, that one of the privileges of En-  
gliſh ſubjects is, that they are not to be  
  
  
have therefore relied upon it, from the  
firſt ſettlement of the proyince, that the  
| | | par -  
  
. E |  
parliament never would, nor could, b  
colour of that clauſe in the charter, Wd  
ſume a right of taxing them, till it had  
qualified itſelf to exerciſe ſuch right, by  
admitting repreſentatives from the people  
to be taxed, who ought to make a part of  
that common conſent.  
  
Q. Are there any words in the charter  
that juſtify that conſtruction ?  
  
A. The common rights of Engliſhmen,  
as declared by Magna Charta, and the pe-  
tition of right, all juſtify it.  
  
Q. Does the diſtinction between in-  
ternal and external taxes exiſt in the  
words of the charter ?  
  
A. No, I believe not.  
  
Q. Then may they not, by the ſame  
interpretation, object to the parliament&#x27;s  
right of external taxation?  
  
A. They never have hitherto. Many  
arguments have been lately uſed here to  
ſhew them that there is no difference, and  
that if you have no right to tax them in-  
ternally, you have none to tax them ex-  
ternally, or make any other law to bind  
them. At preſent they do not reaſon ſo,  
but in time they may poſſibly be con-  
vinced by theſe arguments.  
  
Q. Do not the reſolutions of the Penn-  
ſylvania aſſembly ſay all taxes?  
A. If they do, they mean only internal  
taxes; the ſame words have not N  
  
| tne  
  
L 47 J  
  
the ſame meaning here and in the Colo-  
  
  
by duties they mean cuſtoms; theſe are  
their ideas of the language.  
  
Q. Have you not ſeen the reſolutions of  
the Maſſachuſet&#x27;s Bay aſſembly?  
  
A. I have.  
  
Q. Do they not ſay, that neither ex-  
ternal nor internal taxes can be laid on  
them by parliament ?  
  
A. I don&#x27;t know that they do; I be-  
  
-  
  
heve not. |  
  
Q. If the ſame Colony ſhould fay nei-  
ther tax nor impoſition could be laid,  
does not that province hold the power of  
parliament can lay neither ?  
  
A. I ſuppoſe that by the word impoſi-  
tion, they do not intend to expreſs duties  
to be laid on goods imported, as regula-  
tions of commerce. EY  
Q. What can the Colonies mean then  
by impoſition as diſtinct from taxes?  
  
A. They may mean many things, as  
impreſſing of men, or of carriages, quar-  
  
  
like; there may be great impoſitions that  
are not properly taxes.  
Q. Is not the poſt-office rate an inter-  
nal tax laid by act of parliament ?  
A. I have anſwered that.  
  
Q. Are all parts of the Colonics equally  
able to pay taxes?

[ 48 ]  
  
A. No, certainly ; the frontier parts,  
  
  
are greatly diſabled by that means, \and  
therefore, in ſuch caſes, are uſually fa-  
voured in our tax-laws.  
  
Q. Can we, at this diſtance, be com-  
2 judges of what favours are neceſ-  
A. The parliament have ſuppoſed it,  
by claiming a right to make tax- laws for  
America? I think it impoſſible.  
  
Q. Would the repeal of the ſtamp- act  
be any diſcouragement of your manufac-  
tures? Will the people that have begun  
to manufacture decline it ? e  
  
A. Ves, I think they will; eſpecially  
if, at the ſame time, the trade is opened  
again, ſo that remittances can be eafily  
made. I have known ſeveral inſtances  
that make it probable. In the war before  
laſt, tobacco being low, and making little  
remittance, the people of Virginia went  
generally into family manufactures. Af-  
terwards, when tobacco bore a better  
price, they returned to the uſe of Britiſh  
manufactures. So fulling-mills were very  
much diſuſed in the laſt war in Pennſyl-  
vania, becauſe bills were then plenty,  
and remittances could eaſily be made to  
  
Britain for Engliſh cloth and other goods.  
- Q. It  
  
[49]  
  
Q. If the ſtamp- act ſhould be repealed,  
would it induce the aſſemblies of Ame-  
rica to acknowledge the rights of parlia-  
ment to tax them, and would they eraſe  
their reſolutions ?.  
  
A. No, never.  
  
Is there no means of obliging them  
to eraſe thoſe reſolutions? _  
  
A. None that I know of; they will  
never do it, unleſs compglled by force of  
arms.  
  
Q. Is there a power on earth that can  
force them to eraſe them?  
  
A. No power, how great ſoever, can  
force men to change their opinions.  
  
Q. Do they conſider the poſt-office as  
a tax, or as a regulation ?  
  
A. Not as a tax, but as a regulation  
and conveniency; every aſſembly encou-  
raged it, and ſupported it in its infancy,  
by grants of money, which they would  
not otherwiſe have done; and the people  
  
have always paid the poſtage.  
  
Q. When did you receive the e  
tions you mentionedꝰ  
  
A. I brought them with me, wh I  
came to England, about 15 months ſince.  
  
Q. When did you communicate that  
inſtruction to the miniſter ?

ſtamping of America was under conſidera-  
tion, and before the bill was brought in.

A. To be fure it would; as many  
of the inhabitants could not get ftamps  
when they had occafion for them, with-  
out taking long journeys, and {pending  
perhaps three or four pounds, that the

Q. Are not the colonies, from their

ftamp dury.  
  
A. In my opinion, there is not gold  
and filver enough in the colonies to pay  
the ftamp duty for one year.  
  
ral old provinces, they coft you nothing  
in forts, citadels, garrifons or armies,  
to keep them in fubjeétion. They were  
governed by this country at the expence  
only of a little pen, ink and paper.  
They were led by a thread. They had  
not only a refpeét, but an affeétion, for  
  
B Great Britain, for its laws, its cufoms  
  
and manners, and even a fordnefs for  
its fafhions, that greatly increafed the  
commerce. Natives of Britain were al-  
ways treated with particular regard ; to  
be an Old England-man was, of itfelf, a  
charagter of fome refpeét, and gave a

fifts, you will never attempt to make

titled to al] the privileges and liberties of  
Englifbmen ; they find in the great char-  
ters, and the petition and declaration of

G the firft fettlement of the province, that  
  
the parliament never would, nor could,  
by colour of that claufe in the charter,  
affume aright of taxing them, till it hd

iy of this nation, and, while they are well  
will always be ready to fupport it as  
wtheir little power goes. In 1779 they  
scilled upon to affift in the expedition  
Carthagena, and they fent 3000 men to  
yourarmy. It is true Carthagena is in  
nica, but ag remote from the Northern  
is as if it had been in Europe. They  
no diftinétion of wars, as to their du-  
  
of alifing in them, I know the laft  
i commonly {poke of here as entered  
lor the defence, ot for the fake of the  
of America. I think it is quite mif-  
  
: It began about the limits be-  
wa Canada and Nova-Scotia, about terri-  
wto which indeed the crown laid claim,  
vere not claimed by any Britith colony ;  
  
R of the lands had been granted to any co-  
  
j we had therefore no particular con-  
hw intereft in that difpute. As to the  
the conteft there began about your  
  
of trading in the Indian country, and  
  
“i you had by the treaty of Utrecht,  
athe French infringed: They feized  
balers and their goods, which were

of your merchants, and their factore  
wmrefpondents, had ereéted there,..ta fe-

Ww tll after his ‘feat then the colonies  
Mucked, They were before in perfect  
with both Freath and Indians; the  
  
&quot;we not therefore fent. for. their dée-  
  
ie trade with the Indians, though  
  
‘ ca, is not an American  
R. People of America are chiefly  
: j farce any thing that  
..“ produce is am article of com-  
iq ‘0¢ Indians, The Indian trade  
  
we Materef 5 it is Caitied on with  
  
Britih manufatures, for the profit of Britith  
merchants aad manufacturers ; theretore the  
war, a6 it was commenced for the defence of  
territories of the crown, the property of no  
American, and for the defence of a trade  
purely Britifh, was really a Britith war—and  
yet the people of America made no fcraple  
of contributing their utmoft towards carrying  
it on, and bringing it to a happy conclufion.  
  
- Do youthink then that the taking  
pofieffion of the king&#x27;s territorial rights, and  
ftrengthening the frontiers is not an Ameri-  
car intereft ?  
  
A. Not particularly, but conjointly a Bri-  
tifh and an American intereft.  
  
Q. You wiil not deny that the preceding  
war, the war with Spain, was entered inte  
for the fake of America; was it not occa-  
fioned by captures made in the American  
feas?  
  
A. Yes; captures of thips carrying on the  
Britihh trade there, with Britih manufac-  
tures.  
  
Q. Was not the late war with the Indians,  
fince the peace with Fiance, a war with  
America only ?  
  
A. Yes it was more particularly for Ame-  
rica than the former, but it was rather a  
confequence or remains of the former war,  
the Indians not having been. thoroughly pa-  
cified, and the Americans bore by much the  
greateft thare of the expence. It was put an  
end to by the army under General Bouquet :  
there were not above 300 regulas in that  
army ard above 1000 Pentylvanians.  
  
Q. Is it not neceffary to fend troops to  
America, to defend the Americans againft the  
Indians ?  
  
A. No, by no means; it never was necef-  
fary. They defended themfelves when they  
were but an handful, and tbe Indians much  
more numerous, They continua&#x27;ly gained  
ground, and have driven the lodians over  
the mountains, without any troops fent to  
their affiftance from this country, And  
can it be thought neceflary now to fend  
troops for their defence from thofe dimi-  
nifhed Indian’ tribes, when the colonies are  
become fo populous, and fo firong? there is  
not the leaft occafion for it; they are very  
able to-defend themfelves.

Q. But supposing the external tax or  
duty to be laid on the necessaries of life  
imported into your colony, will not that  
be the same thing in its effect as an inter-  
nal tax.  
  
A. I do not know a single article im-  
ported into the northern colonies, but what  
they can either do without, or make them-  
selves.  
  
Q. Don’t you think cloth trom Eng-  
land absolutely necessary to them ?  
  
A. No, by no means absolutely neces-  
sary ; with industry and good manage-  
ment, they may very well supply them-  
selves with all they want.  
  
Q Will it not take a long time to es-  
tablish that manufacture among them ;  
and must they not in the mean while suf-  
fer greatly.  
  
A. I think not. They have made a  
surprizing grogress already, — and 1 am  
of opinion, that before theirold clothes are  
worn out, they will have new ones of their  
own making.  
  
Q. Can they possibly find wool enough  
in North America.  
  
A. They have taken steps to increase  
the wool They entered into general  
combinations to eat no more lamb ; and  
vory few lambs were killed last year. —  
This course, persisted in, will soon make  
a prodigious difference in the quantity of  
wool. — And ilieestablishingof great man-  
ufactories, like in the clothing towns here,  
is not necessary, as it i» wlie&#x27;re the busi-  
ness is carried on for the trade. The  
people will all spin and work for them-  
selves in their own houses.  
  
Q. Can there be wool and manufacture  
enough in one or two years ?  
  
A. In three years I think there may.  
  
Q. Docs not the severity of the winter,  
in the northern colonies occasion the wool  
to be of a bad quality ?  
  
A No, the wool is very fine and good.  
  
Q. In the more southern colonies, as  
in Virginia, don’t you know, that the  
wool is coarse and only a kind of hair ?  
  
A. I Don’t know it — I never heard it.  
Yet I have been sometimes in Virginia —  
I cannot say I ever took particular notice  
of th? wool there, but I believe it is good  
though 1 cannot speak positively of it ;  
but Virginia and the colonies south of it,  
have less occasion for wool ; their winters  
are short and not very severe ; and they  
•can very welt clothe theiMelves with lin-  
en and cotton of their own raising for the  
rest of the year  
  
Q. If the act is not repealed, «*hat do  
you think will be the consequence ?  
  
A. A total loss of the respect and af-  
fection the people of America hear to  
fhis country, and of all the commerce  
  
*bf &#x27; depends on that respect and affec-  
tion.  
  
Q. How can the commerce be affcct-  
■ d ? ^  
  
A. You will find that if the act is not  
&#x27;•epealed, they will take very little of your  
manufactures in a short time.  
  
Q. Is it in their power to do without  
them ?  
  
A. I think they may very well do with-  
out them  
  
Q. Is it their interest not to take  
them ? «.  
  
A. Tile goods they take from Britain  
are either necessaries, or mere conveni-  
ences, or superfluities — The first, as  
cloth, Sec. with a little industry they can  
make at home ; the second they can do  
without, till they are able to&#x27;provide them  
among themselves ; and the last, which  
are nittch the greatest part, they will strike  
off immediately. — They are mere articles  
of fashion, purchased and consumed, be-  
cause the fashion in a respected country ;  
but will now be de’ested and rejected. —  
The people have already struck off, by  
general agreement, the use of all goods  
fashionable in mourning, and many thous-  
and pounds worth are sent back as unsala-  
ble.  
  
Q. Is it their interest to make cloth at  
home ?  
  
A. I think they may at^iresent get it  
cheaper from Britain, I mean of the fine-  
ness and neatness of workmanship; but  
when one consider other circumstances,  
the restraint on their trade, and the diffi-  
culty of making remittances, it is their in-  
terest to make every thing.

Q. Supposing the stamp act continued  
and enforced, do you imagine that ill hu-  
mour will induce the Americans to give  
as much for worse manufactures of their  
own, and use them, preferable to better of  
ours ?  
  
A. Yes, I think so. — People will pay as  
freely to gratify one passion as another,  
their resentment as their pride.  
  
Q. Would the people at Boston dis-  
continue their trade ?

number compared with the body of the  
people, and must discontinue their trade,  
if no body will buy their goods.

not the people use them rather than remain in such a situa-

4. It is hard to say what they would do. Ican only  
judge what other people will think, and how they will act,  
by what I feel within myself. Ihave a great many debis  
due to me in America, and I had rather they should remain

Parliamentary Committee relative to the repeal  
of the American Stamp act, was asked what  
was the temper of America towards Great  
Britain previous to 173. The Doctor replied,  
&quot;The very best in the world. They submitted  
willingly to the Government of the crown, and  
paid in their courts obedience to acts of Par­  
Hament. Numerous as are the people in the  
several old provinces, they cost you nothing in  
forts, citadels, garrisons or armies to keep them  
in subjection. They were governed by this  
country at the expense only of a little pen, ink  
and paper; they were led by a thread. They  
bad not only a respect, but an affection for  
Great Britain--for its laws, its customs, its  
manners, and even a fondness for its fashions,  
that greatly increared its commerce.&quot;  
If we go back ninety years and re-­  
view the political history of the colonies  
without prejudice, we shall see that, from  
the smallest and most apparently insignificant  
causes, the respect and love which our fore­  
fathers bore toward the old land was changed,  
in less than twenty years, to a feeling of the  
bitterest enmity. The earliest encroachment  
made upon the rights of the colonists was in  
1761, when the enforcement of the act levying  
duties upon sugar, molasses, &amp;c, was attempted  
by means of &quot;writs of assistance,&quot; which em­  
powered the Kings officers to search for a

Q. What was the tentper of America toward Great  
Britain before the year 1763?  
  
A. The best in the world. They submitted wil-  
lingly to the government of the crown, and paid, in  
their courts, obedience to the acts of Parliament.  
Numerous as the people are in the several old prov-  
inces, they cost you nothing in forts, citadels, garri-  
sons, or armies, to keep them in subjection. They  
were governed by this country at the expense only  
of a little pen, ink and paper; they were led by a  
thread. They had not only a respect, but an affec-  
tion for Great Britain; for its laws, its customs and  
manners, and even a fondness for its fashions, that  
greatly increased the commerce. Natives of Britain  
were always treated with particular regard ; to be an  
Old-England man was, of itself, a character of some  
respect, and gave a kind of rank among us.  
  
Q. And what is their temper now ?  
  
A. O, very much altered

Q. Don’t you think cloth from England absolutely  
necessary to them ?  
  
A. No, by no means absolutely necessary ; with  
industry and good management, they may very well  
supply themselves with all they want.  
  
Q. Will it not take a long time to establish that  
manufacture among them ; and must they not in the  
meanwhile suffer greatly ?  
  
A. I think not. They have made a surprising  
progress already. And I am of opinion, that beforo  
their old clothes are worn out, they will have new  
ones of their own making.  
  
.Q. Can they possibly find wool enough in North  
America?  
  
A. They have taken steps to increase the wool.  
They entered into general combinations to eat no  
more lamb; and very few lambs were killed last  
year. This course, persisted in, will soon make a  
prodigions difference in the quantity of wool. And

the clothing towns here, is not necessary, as it is  
where the business is to be carried on for the pur-  
poses of trade. The people will all spin, and work  
for themselves, in their own houses.  
  
Q. Can there be wool and manufacture enough in  
one or two years?  
  
A. In three years, I think there may.  
  
Q. Does not the severity of the winter, in the |  
  
northern colonies, occasion the wool to be of bad  
quality ?  
  
A. No; the wool is very fine and good.  
  
Q. In the more southern colonies, as in Virginia,  
don’t you know, that the wool is coarse, and only a  
kind of hair?  
  
A. I don’t know it. I never heard it. Yet I have  
been sometimes in Virginia. I cannot say I ever  
took particular notice of tHe wool there, but I be-  
  
lieve it is good, though I cannot speak positively of |  
  
it; but Virginia and the colonies south of it have  
less occasion for wool; their winters are short, and  
not very severe ; and they can very well clothe them-  
selves with linen and cotton of their own raising for  
the rest of the year.  
  
Q. Are not the people in the more northern colg-  
nies obliged to fodder their-sheep all the winter?  
  
A. In some of the most northern colonies they  
may be obliged to do it, some part of the winter.  
  
Q. Can anything Jess than a military force carry  
the Stamp Act into.execution ?  
  
‘A. Ido not see how a military force can be ap-  
plied to that purpose.  
  
Q. Why may it nat?  
  
A. Suppose a military force sent into America,  
they will find nobody in arms; what are they then  
todo? They cannot force a man to take stamps  
who chooses to do without them. They will not  
find a rebellion ; they may indeed make one.  
  
Q. If the act is not repealed, what do you think  
will be the consequences?  
  
A. A total loss of the respect and affection the  
people of America bear to this country, and of all  
the commerce that depends on that respect and  
affection.  
  
Q. How can the commerce be affected ?  
  
A. You will find, that if the act is not repealed,  
they will take a very little of your manufactures in  
a short time.  
  
Q. Is it in their power to do without them ?  
  
A. I think they may very well do without them.  
  
Q. Is it their interest not to take them?  
  
A. The goods they take from Britain are either  
necessaries, mere conveniences or superfluities. The  
first, as cloth, &amp;., with ‘a little industry they can  
make at home; the second they can do without, till  
they are able to provide them among themselves ;  
  
—  
  
| will strike off immediately. They are mere artichy  
of fashion, purchased and consumed because the  
fashion in a respected country ; but will now be de  
tested and rejected. The people have already struck  
off, by general agreement, the use of all goods fash  
ionable in mournings, and many thousand poundy  
worth are sent back as unsalable.

colonies in all cases whatever.” This  
assertion of power utterly annulled the  
right, heretofore maintained and exer-  
cised by the colonies, of exemption from  
all taxes not self-imposed. Pitt, in the  
House of Commons, defined the distine-  
tion between an external tax for regu-  
lating commerce, which he said was  
right, and an tnternal tax, extorted for  
revenue, which he condemned. When  
  
  
  
670  
  
Franklin was asked, at the bar of the  
Commons, how the colonies would re-  
gard this general, sweeping ‘“ Declara-  
tory Act,” he shrewdly answered, “The  
resolutions will give them very little  
concern, if they are never attempted to  
be carried into practice.” So Fox, in  
the debate on the Remonstrance, said,  
“The right simply is not regarded ; it  
is the exercise of it that is the object of  
opposition.” An attempt was made to  
exercise the right, and the consequence  
was that the British customs officers in  
the  
fishes in the harbor the duties on nearly  
four hundred  
  
Boston were left to collect from  
  
chests of tea, valued at  
  
about one hundred

Q. What is your Name and Place  
of abode?  
  
A. Franklin, of Philadelphia.  
  
Q. Do the Americans pay any con-  
siderable taxes among themselves?  
  
A. Certainly, many, and very heavy  
taxes.  
  
Q. What are the present taxes in  
Pennsylvania laid by the laws of the  
Colony ?  
  
A. There are taxes on all estates,  
real and personal, a poll-tax, a tax on  
all offices, professions, trades, and  
businesses, according to their profits ;  
an excise upon all wine, rum, and  
  
E. D.  
  
other spirits ; and a duty of ten pounds  
  
“per head on all negroes imported, with  
  
some other duties.  
  
Q. For what purposes are those  
taxes laid?  
  
A. For the support of the civil and  
military establishments of the coun-  
try, and to discharge the heavy debt  
contracted in the last war.  
  
Q. How long are those taxes to  
continue ?  
  
A. Those for discharging the debt  
are to continue till 1772, and longer,  
if the debt should not then be all dis-  
charged. The others must always  
continue.  
  
Q. Was it not expected that the  
debt would have been sooner dis-  
charged ?  
  
A. It was, when the peace was  
made with France &amp; Spain—But a  
fresh war breaking out with the Ind-  
ians, a fresh load of debt was incur-  
red; and the taxes, of course, con-  
tinued longer by a new law.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Literature, Quaint and Curious.  
  
Q. Are not all the people very able  
to pay those taxes?  
  
-A. No. The Frontier counties, all  
along the continent, having been fre-  
quently ravished by the enemy, and  
greatly impoverished, are able to pay  
very little tax. And therefore, in  
consideration of their distresses, our  
late tax laws do expressly favour  
these counties, excusing the sufferers ;  
and I suppose the same is done in  
other governments.  
  
Q. Are you not concerned in the  
management of the Post-Office in  
America ?  
  
A. Yes, I am Deputy Post-Master  
General of North America.  
  
Q. Don’t you think the distribu-  
tion of stamps by post, to all the in-  
habitants, very practicable, if there  
was no opposition ?  
  
A. The posts only go along the sea  
coasts ; they do not, except in a few  
instances, go back into the country ;  
and if they did, sending for stamps  
by post would occasion an expense of  
postage, amounting, in many cases,  
to much more than that of the stamps  
themselves.  
  
Q. Are you acquainted in New-  
foundland ?  
  
A. I never was there.  
  
Q. Do you know whether there are  
any post roads on that Island?  
  
A. I have heard that there are no  
roads at all; but that the communica-  
tion between one settlement and an-  
other is by the sea only.  
  
Q. Can you disperse the stamps by  
post in Canada?  
  
A. There is only a post between  
Montreal and Quebec.  
tants are so  
  
The inhabi-  
scattered and remote  
from each other, in that vast country,  
that posts cannot be supported among  
  
169  
  
them, and therefore they cannot get  
stamps by post. The English Colo-  
nies, too, along the frontiers, are very  
thinly settled.  
  
Q. From the thinness of the back  
settlements, would not the stamp act  
be extremely inconvenient to the in-  
habitants, if executed?  
  
A. To be sure it would; as many  
of the inhabitants could not get  
stamps when they had occasion for  
them, without taking long journeys,  
and spending perhaps Three or Four  
Pounds, that the crown might get six  
pence.  
  
Q. Are not the Colonies, from their  
circumstances, very able to pay the  
stamp duty?  
  
A. In my opinion, there is not gold  
and silver enough in the Colonies to  
pay the stamp duty for one year.

year’s imports into Pennsylvania from  
Britain ?  
  
A. I have been informed that our

Britain to be above 500,000 pounds.  
  
Q. What may be the amount of the

produce of your province exported to  
Britain ?  
  
A. It must be small, as we produce  
little that is wanted in Britain. I sup-  
pose that it cannot exceed 40,000  
Pounds.  
  
o a * * .  
  
Q. You have said that you pay  
heavy taxes in Pennsylvania; what  
do they amount to in the pound?  
  
A. The tax on all estates, real and  
personal, is eighteen pence in the  
pound, fully rated; and the tax on  
the profits of trades and professions,  
with other taxes, do, I suppose, make  
full half a crown in the pound.

Q. What was the temper of Amer-  
ica towards Great Britain before the  
year 1763?  
  
A. The best in the world. They  
  
submitted willingly to the government ~  
  
of the Crown, and paid, in all their  
courts, obedience to acts of parlia-  
ment. Numerous as the people are  
in the several old provinces, they cost  
you nothing in forts, citadels, garri-  
sons, or armies, to keep them in sub-  
jection. They were governed by this  
country at the expense only of a little  
pen, ink, and paper.

They were led  
They had not only a  
respect, but an affection, for Great  
Britain, for its laws, its customs and  
manners, and even a fondness for its  
fashions, that greatly increased the  
commerce. Natives of Britain were  
always treated with particular regard ;  
to be an Old England man was, of it-  
self, a character of some respect, and  
gave a kind of rank among us.

Q. And have they not still the same  
respect for parliament ?  
  
A. No; it is greatly lessened.  
  
Q. To what cause is that owing?”  
  
A. To a concurrence of causes:  
the restraints lately laid on their  
trade, by which the bringing of for-  
eign gold and silver into the colonies  
was prevented; the prohibition of  
making paper money among them-  
selves, and then demanding a new  
and heavy tax for stamps; taking  
away at the same time trials by ju-  
ries, and refusing to receive &amp; hear  
their humble petitions.  
  
Q. Don’t you think they would  
submit to the stamp-act if it was  
modified, the obnoxious parts taken  
out, and the duties reduced to some  
particulars, of small moment?

Q. Will it not take a long time to  
establish that manufacture among  
them? and must they not meanwhile  
suffer greatly ?

a surprising progress already. And  
I am of opinion that before their old  
cloths are worn out, they will have  
  
new ones of their own making

Q. If the act is not repealed, what  
do you think will be the consequences ?  
  
A. A total loss of the respect and  
affection the people of America bear  
to this country, and of all the com-  
merce that depends on that respect  
and affection.  
  
Q. How can the commerce be af-

out them ?  
  
A. I think they may very well do  
without them.  
  
(). Is it their interest not to take  
them?  
  
A. The goods they take from Brit-  
ain are either necessaries, mere con-  
veniences, or superfluities. The first,  
as cloth, &amp;¢c., with a little industry  
  
they can make at home; the second  
they can do without till they are able  
to provide them among themselves ;  
and the last, which are much the  
greater part. they will strike off im-  
mediately. They are mere articles of  
fashion, purchased and consumed be-  
cause the fashion in a respected coun-

jected.” The already

Q. If the stamp-act should be re-  
pealed, would it induce the assemblies

of parliament to tax them, and would

never do it unless compelled by force  
of arms.

can force them to erase them?

the privileges of English subjects is that they are not to be taxed but by their common consent;

Q. Was it an opinion in America, before 1763, that the Parliament had  
no right to lay taxes and duties there ?  
  
‘A. I never heard any objection to the right of laying duties to regulate  
commerce ; but a right to lay internal taxes was never thought to lie in Par-  
liament.  
  
‘*Q. On what do you found your opinion that the people of America make  
any such distinction ?  
* See letter of Chief of Bureau of Statistics, May 5, 1882.

360 THE WESTERN VIEW OF THE TARIFF.  
  
‘©A, I know that whenever the subject occurred in conversation it has  
appeared the opinion of every one that we could not be taxed by a Parliament  
where we were not represented ; but the payment of duties, laid as regula-  
tions of commerce, was never disputed.”

Ans. Thebalance is paid by our produce car

lands, or to the French, Spanish, Danes, and  
Dutch: by the same produce carried to other colo

working of foreign exchange. It was given  
by an American 120 years ago, and yet the

mastered it.

When Franklin was asked before the Committee of the Com-  
mons whether he could show any difference between the two  
taxes, he replied that the difference was very real and very  
great. ‘“ An external tax is a duty laid on commodities; that  
duty is added to the first cost and, when it is offered to sale  
makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that  
price they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an  
internal tax is forced from the people without their consent,  
if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act  
says, we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of prop-  
erty with each other, neither purchase, nor grant, nor recover  
debts ; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we  
pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort  
our money from us or ruin us by the consequences of refusing  
  
‘to pay it.&#x27; When it was suggested that a duty might be  
levied upon the necessaries of life and thus extort by an  
external tax the money of the colonists, Franklin replied that
