[6 February 1792]  
  
  
On 3 February 1792 the Committee of the Whole began consideration of the bill for encouragement of the cod fisheries. As passed by the Senate, the first section of the bill replaced the existing drawback (of the import duty on salt) to exporters of salted fish with a new one based on tonnage to owners of fishing vessels. Debate on 6 February centered on the advantage which the bill bestowed on New England and stressed the importance of the fisheries as a source of trained sailors in case of war.  
  
  
Mr. Madison. In the conflict I feel between my disposition, on one hand, to afford every constitutional encouragement to the fisheries, and my dislike, on the other, of the consequences apprehended from some clauses in the bill, I should have forborne to enter into this discussion, if I had not found, that, over and above such arguments as appear to be natural and pertinent to the subject, others have been introduced, which are, in my judgment, contrary to the true meaning, and even strike at the characteristic principles of the constitution. Let me premise, however, to the remarks which I shall briefly offer, on the doctrine maintained by these gentlemen, that I make a material distinction in the present case, between an allowance as a mere commutation and modification of a drawback, and an allowance in the nature of a real and positive bounty. I make a distinction also, as a subject of fair consideration at least, between a bounty granted under the particular terms in the constitution, “a power to regulate trade,” and one granted under the indefinite terms which have been cited as authority on this occasion. I think, however, that the term “bounty” is in every point of view improper as it is here applied, not only because it may be offensive to some, and, in the opinion of others, carries a dangerous implication; but also because it does not express the true intention of the bill as avowed and advocated by its patrons themselves. For if, in the allowance, nothing more is proposed, than a mere reimbursement of a sum advanced, it is only paying a debt; and when we pay a debt, we ought not to claim the merit of granting a bounty.  
It is supposed by some gentlemen, that Congress have authority not only to grant bounties in the sense here used, merely as a commutation for drawbacks, but even to grant them under a power by virtue of which they may do anything which they may think conducive to the “general welfare.” This, sir, in my mind, raises the important and fundamental question, whether the general terms which had been cited, are to be considered as a sort of caption or general description of the specified powers, and as having no further meaning, and giving no further power, than what is found in that specification, or as an abstract and indefinite delegation of power extending to all cases whatever; to all such at least, as will admit the application of money, which is giving as much latitude as any government could well desire.  
I, sir, have always conceived—I believe those who proposed the constitution conceived; it is still more fully known, and more material to observe, those who ratified the constitution conceived, that this is not an indefinite government deriving its powers from the general terms prefixed to the specified powers—but, a limited government tied down to the specified powers, which explain and define the general terms.  
The gentlemen who contend for a contrary doctrine are surely not aware of the consequences which flow from it, and which they must either admit, or give up their doctrine.  
It will follow, in the first place, that if the terms be taken in the broad sense they maintain, the particular powers, afterwards so carefully and distinctly enumerated, would be without meaning, and must go for nothing. It would be absurd to say, first, that Congress may do what they please; and then, that they may do this or that particular thing. After giving Congress power to raise money, and apply it to all purposes which they may pronounce necessary to the general welfare, it would be absurd, to say the least, to superadd a power to raise armies, to provide fleets, &amp;c. In fact, the meaning of the general terms in question must either be sought in the subsequent enumerations which limits and details them, or they convert the government from one limited as hitherto supposed, to the enumerated powers, into a government without any limits at all.  
  
It is to be recollected, that the terms “common defence and general welfare,” as here used, are not novel terms first introduced into this constitution. They are terms familiar in their construction, and well known to the people of America. They are repeatedly found in the old articles of confederation, where, although they are susceptible of as great latitude as can be given them by the context here, it was never supposed or pretended that they conveyed any such powers as is now assigned to them. On the Contrary, it was always considered as clear and certain, that the old Congress was limited to the enumerated powers; and that the enumeration limited and explained the general terms. I ask the gentlemen themselves, whether it ever was supposed or suspected, that the old Congress could give away the money of the states in bounties to encourage agriculture or for any other purpose they pleased. If such a power had been possessed by that body, it would have been much less impotent, or have borne a very different character from that universally ascribed to it.  
The novel idea now annexed to those terms, and never before entertained by the friends or enemies of the government, will have a further consequence which cannot have been taken into the view of the gentlemen. Their construction would not only give Congress the complete legislative power I have stated; it would do more; it would supercede all the restrictions understood at present to lie on their power with respect to a judiciary. It would put it in the power of Congress to establish Courts throughout the United States, with cognizance of suits between citizen and citizen, and in all cases whatsoever. This sir, seems to be demonstrable: For if the clause in question really authorizes Congress to do whatever they think fit, provided it be for the general welfare, of which they are to judge, and money can be applied to it, Congress must have power to create and support a judiciary establishment, with a jurisdiction extending to all cases, favorable, in their opinion, to the general welfare, in the same manner as they have power to pass laws and apply money providing in any other way for the general welfare. I shall be reminded, perhaps, that according to the terms of the constitution, the judicial power is to extend to certain cases only, not to all cases. But this circumstance can have no effect in the argument, it being presupposed by the gentlemen, that the specification of certain objects does not limit the import of the general terms. Taking these terms as an abstract and indefinite grant of power, they comprise all the objects of legislative regulation, as well such as fall under the judiciary article in the constitution, as those falling immediately under the legislative article; and if the partial enumeration of objects in the legislative article does not, as these gentlemen contend, limit the general power, neither will it be limited by the partial enumeration of objects in the judiciary article.  
There are consequences, sir, still more extensive which as they follow clearly from the doctrine combated, must either be admitted, or the doctrine must be given up. If Congress can apply money indefinitely to the general welfare, and are the sole and supreme judges of the general welfare, they may take the care of religion into their own hands; they may establish teachers in every state, county, and parish, and pay them out of the public treasury; they may take into their own hands the education of children, establishing in like manner schools throughout the union; they may assume the provision for the poor; they may undertake the regulation of all roads other than post roads; in short, every thing, from the highest object of state legislation, down to the most minute object of police, would be thrown under the power of Congress; for every object I have mentioned would admit the application of money, and might be called, if Congress pleased, provisions for the general welfare.  
The language held in various discussions of this house, is a proof that the doctrine in question was never entertained by this body. Arguments, wherever the subject would permit, have constantly been drawn from the peculiar nature of this government as limited to certain enumerated powers, instead of extending, like other governments to all cases not particularly excepted. In a very late instance, I mean the debate on the representation bill, it must be remembered that an argument much used, particularly by a gentleman from Massachusetts, against the ratio of one for 30,000, was that this government was unlike the state governments, which had an indefinite variety of objects within their power, that it had a small number of objects only to attend to, &amp; therefore that a smaller number of representatives would be sufficient to administer it.  
Arguments have been advanced, to shew, that because, in the regulation of trade, indirect and eventual encouragement is given to manufactures, therefore congress have power to give money in direct bounties, or to grant it in any other way that would answer the same purpose. But surely, Sir, there is a great and obvious difference, which it cannot be necessary to enlarge upon; a duty laid on imported implements of husbandry, would in its operation be an indirect tax on exported produce: but will any one say that by virtue of a mere power to lay duties on imports, Congress might go directly to the produce or implements of agriculture, or to the articles exported? It is true, duties on exports are expressly prohibited; but if there were no article forbidding them, a power directly to tax exports could never be deduced from a power to tax imports, although such a power might indirectly and incidentally affect exports.  
In short, sir, without going further into the subject, which I should not have here touched on at all, but for the reasons already mentioned, I venture to declare it as my opinion, that were the power of Congress to be established in the latitude contended for, it would subvert the very foundation, and transmute the very nature of the limited government established by the people of America: and what inferences might be drawn or what consequences ensue from such a step, it is incumbent on us all well to consider.  
With respect to the question before the house for striking out the clause, it is immaterial whether it be struck out, or so amended as to rest on the avowed principle of a commutation for the drawback, but as a clause has been drawn up by one of my colleagues, in order to be substituted, I shall concur in a vote for striking out, reserving to myself a freedom to be governed in my final vote by the modification which may prevail.

 drawbacks allowed on the  
exportation, that the government loses considera­  
bly on the one hand, and the filhermen still  
more on the other.  
After a variety of other remarks, he concluded  
by observing, that the filhery, however important  
to the ftace of Mafl&#x27;achufetts, is equally so to  
every other state in the union j that it is not the  
interest of particular Hates, but the national inter­  
est that is at stake j that in our competition with  
foreign nations, we are fighting them with such  
superior arms and with such superior strength as  
rnuft finally ensure us a due reward for all our  
struggles.  
Mr. Madison. In the conflict I feel between  
my disposition, on one hand, to afford every con­  
stitutional encouragement to the fiiheries, and  
my dislike, on the other, of the coniequences ap­  
prehended from foms clauses in the bill, I lhould  
have forborne to enter into this difcullion, if 1  
had not found, that, over and above such argu­  
ments as appear to be natural and pertinent to  
the fubjedt, others have been introduced, which  
aie, in my judgment, contrary to the true mean­  
ing, and even strike at the charadteriftic princi­  
ples of the exiftingconftitution. Let me premise,  
however, to the remarks which I (hall briefly of-  
Jer, on the do&amp;rine maintained by these gentle­  
men, that I make a material diftin&amp;ion in the  
present. cafe, between an allowance as a mere  
commutation and modification of a drawback,  
and an allowance in the nature of a real and po­  
sitive bounty. I make a diftin&amp;ion also, as a  
fubjeft of fair consideration at least, between a  
bounty granted under the particular terms in the  
constitution, &quot; a power to regulate trade,&quot; and  
one granted under the indefinite terms which  
have been cited as authority on this occasion.  
I think, however, that the term &#x27; bounty&#x27; is in  
every point of view improper as it is here applied,  
not only because it may be offensive to some, and,  
in the opinion of others, carries a dangerous im­  
plication, but also because it does not express the  
true intention of the bill as avowed and advoca­  
ted by its patrons themselves. For if, in the al­  
lowance, nothing more is proposed, than a mere  
reimbursement of a sum advanced, it is only pay­  
ing a debt ; and when we pay a debt, we ought  
not to claim the merit of granting a bounty.  
  
it is supposed tiy f ,me gentleman, that Con­  
gress have authority not only to grant bounties  
in the sense here used, merely as a commutation  
for drawbacks, but even to grant them under a  
power by virtue of which they may do any thing  
which they may think, conducive to the * general  
welfare.* This, fir, in rriy mind, raises the im­  
portant and fundamental question, whether the  
general terms which have been cited, are to be  
considered as a fort of caption or general descrip­  
tion of the fpecified powers, and as having no  
further meaning, and giving no further power,  
than what is found in that fpecification, or as au  
ab(tract and indefinite delegation of power ex­  
lending to all cases whatever ; to all such at  
east as will admit the application of money,  
which is giving as much latitude as any govern­  
ment could well desire.  
I,.fir, have always conceived --I Believe those  
vho proposed the constitution conceived- -it is  
till more fully known, and more material to ob  
erve, that thole who ratified the constitution con  
reived, that this is not an indefinite government,  
jeriving its powers from the general terms prefix­  
ed to the fpecified powers j but a limited govern­  
ment tied down to the fpecified powers, which  
:xplain and define the general terms.  
The gentlemen who contend tor a contrary  
jodtrine, are surely not aware of the conferences  
vhich flow from it, and which they must either  
admit, or give up their dodtrine.  
it will follow, in the firft place, that if the  
terms be taken in the broad fenle rhey maintain,  
the particular powers, afterwards so carefully and  
distinctly enumerated, would be without meaning,  
and must go for nothing. It would be absurd to  
&quot;ay, fir ft, that Congress may do what they please ;  
and then, that they may do this or that particular  
;hing. After giving Cong re fs power to raise mo­  
ney and apply it to all purposes which they may  
pronounce neceflary to the general welfare, it  
vould be absurd, to fay the lead, to fuperadd a  
sower to raise armies, to provide fleets, &amp;c. In  
fadt, the meaning of the general terms in question  
must either be fought in the subsequent enumera­  
tion which limits and details them, or they con­  
vert the government from one limited as hitherto  
supposed, to the enumerated powers, into a go­  
vernment without any limits at all.  
It id to be recolledted, that the terms &quot; com­  
mon defence and general welfare,&quot; as here uied,  
ire not novel terms firft introduced into this con-  
Vitution. They are terms familiar in their con­  
trudtion, and well known to the people of Ame­  
■ica. They are repeatedly found in the old ar  
;iclei of confederation, where, although they are  
&quot;ufceptibie of as great latitude as can be given  
hem by the context here, it was never fuppoled  
&gt;r pretended that they conveyed any such power  
is is now afiigned to them. On the contrary, it  
vas always considered as clear and certain, that  
he old Congress was limited to the enumerated  
)Owers j and that the enumeration limited and  
:xplained the general terms. I afkthe gentlemen  
hemfelves, whether it was ever supposed or fuf­  
)edted, th|t the old Congress could give away the  
money of the states in bounties to encouiage agri­  
&#x27;.ulture, or for any other purpose they pleaied. If  
&quot;uch a power had been pofTefied by that body, it  
vould have been much leJs impotent, or h,»ve  
&gt;orne a very different charadier from that univer­  
&quot;ally ascribed to it.  
The novel idea now annexed to those terms,  
ind never before entertained by the mends or  
memies of the government, will have a f&#x27;urthei  
:onfequence which cannot have been tak&lt;tn into  
he view of the gentlemen. Their conftrudtion  
vould not only give Congress the complete legi/la­  
:ive power I have stated $ it would do more $ it  
vould supersede all the reftridtions understood at  
&gt;resent to lie on their power with refpedt to a ju­  
liciarv. It would put it in the power of Con­  
gress to establish courts throughout the United  
states, with cognizance of suits between citizen  
and citizen, and in all cases whatsoever. This,  
fir, seems to be demonstrable : For if the cLufe  
in question really authorises Congress to do what­  
ever they think fit, provided it be for the genera  
welfare, of which they are to judge, and money  
can be applied to it, Congress must have powei  
to create and support a judiciary eftabliihmentj  
with a jurifdidtion extending to all cases, favora­  
ble, in their opinion, to the general welfare, in  
the fame manner as they have power to pas«  
laws and apply money providing in any other waj  
for the general welfare. I lhall be reminded,  
perhaps, that, according to the terms of the con­  
stitution, the judicial power is to extend to cer­  
tain cases only, not to all cases. But this cir­  
cumstance can have no effedt in the argument, il  
being presupposed by the gentlemen, that the Ipe­  
cification of certain objedts does not limit the im­  
port of the general terms. Taking these tcrnn  
as an abftradt and indefinite grant of power, they  
comprise all the objedts of legislative regulation,  
as well such as fall under the judiciary article in  
the constitution, as those falling immediately &#x27;un­  
der the legislative article ; and if the partial enu­  
meration of ofejedls in the legislative article does  
not, as these gentlemen contend, limit the gene­  
ral power, neither will it be limited by the partial  
enumeration of objedts in the judiciary article.  
There are consequences, fir, still more exten­  
sive which, as they follow clearly from the doc­  
trine combated, must either be admitted, or the  
dodtrine must be given up. If Congress can ap­  
ply money indefinitely to the general welfare, and  
are the sole and supreme judges of the general  
welfare, they may take the care of religion into  
their own hands j fcthey may establish teachers in  
every state, county, and parish, and pay them out  
of the public treasury j they may take into theii  
own hands the education of children, eftabli/hiwg  
in like manner schools throughout the union $  
they may alTume the provision for the poor ; the)  
may undertake the regulation of all roads, other  
than post roads : in ihort, every thing, from the  
highest objedt of state legislation, down to the  
most minute objedt of police, would be thrown  
under the power of Congress ; for every objedt 1  
have mentioned would admit the application of  
money, and might be called, if Congress pJeafed,  
provisions for the general welfare.  
The language held in various difcufilons of this  
House, is a proof that the dodtrine in question  
was never entertained by this body. Arguments,  
wherever the fubjedt would permit, have constant­  
  
y been drawn from the peculiar nature of this go.  
vernment as limited to certain enumerated powers,  
mflead of extending, like other governments to all  
cases not particularly excepted. In a very late  
instance, 1 mean the debate on the representation  
bill, it mult be remembered that an argumen&#x27;  
much used, particularly by gentlemen from Mal­  
fachufetts against the ratio of one for 30,000, was  
chat this government was unlike the state govern­  
ment, which had an indefinite variety of objech  
within their power, that it had a imall number 0/  
jbjefts only to attend to, and therefore that a  
mailer number of representatives would be fuffi­  
:ient to administer ir.  
Arguments have been advanced, to (hew, thai  
because, in the regulation of trade, indirect anc  
eventual encouragement is given to manuJaliures.  
therefore Congress have power to give money ir  
lired bounties, or to grant it in any other waj  
that would answer the lame purpose. But furelv,  
[ir, there is a great and obvious difference, which  
it cannot be necefiary to enlarge upon j a dut)  
aid on imported implements of husbandry, would  
n its operation be an indirect tax on exported pro­  
luce : but will any one fay that by virtue of 2  
Jiere power to lay duties on imports, Congress  
night go diredily to the produce or implements ol  
igriculture, or to the articles exported ? It is true,  
luties on exports are cxprefsly prohibited ; but il  
here were no article forbidding them, a power di­  
ettly to tax exports could never be deduced from  
1 power to tax imports, although such a power  
night indirectly and incidentally afteft exports.  
Jn short, fir, without going further into the  
übjed, which I should not have here touched on  
it all, but for the reasons already mentioned, J  
&#x27;enture to declare it as my opinion, that were the  
&gt;ower of Congress to be eftablilhed in the latitude  
:ontended for, it would subvert the very founda­  
tion, and transmute the very nature of the limited  
government eftabliflied by the people of America:  
ind what inferences might be drawn or what con­  
sequences ensue from such a step, it is incumbent  
&gt;n us all well to consider.  
With refpeft to the aueftion before the House  
:or striking out the clause, it is immaterial whe­  
:her it be struck out, or so amended as to reft on  
he avowed principle of a commutation for the  
Jrawback, but as a clause has been drawn up by

CONGRESS.  
  
PHILADELPHIA  
  
IiOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  
  
MONDAY, February 6.  
In committee of the, whole, on the F-ijhery Bill.  
[CONTI N U ED.*]  
MR. MADISON. In the conflict I feel be­  
. tween my disposition on one hand to afford  
every constitutional encouragement to the fiifhe­  
ries, and niy diflrke on the other, of the conse­  
quences apprehended from some clauses in the  
bill, I should have forborne to enter into this  
if 1 had not found that over and above,  
such arguments as appear to be natural and per  
tinent to the fubje&lt;ft, others have been introduc­  
ed, which are in my judgment, contrary to the  
true meaning, and even ltrike at the &#x27;chara&lt;fter­  
iftic principles the exiftihg constitution. Let  
me premise however to the remarks which I shall  
briefly offer, on the do&lt;ftrine maintained by these  
gentlemen,,that I make a material diiiindtion in  
theprefent cafe, between anallowanceas a mere,  
commutation and modification of a drawback,  
and an allowance in the nature of a real and po­  
sitive bounty. I make a diftincftion also, as a  
of fair consideration, at least, between a  
bounty granted under the particular terms in the  
constitution, &quot; a power to regulate trade,&quot; and  
one granted under the indefinite terms, which  
have been cited as authority on this occasion.  
I think however thatNthe term &quot; bounty&quot; is in  
every point of view improper as it is here appli­  
ed, not only beeaufe it may be offenfive to some,  
and in the opinion of others, carries a dangerous  
implication ; -but also because it does not express !  
the true intention of th«r bill as avowed and ad­  
vocated by its patrons themselves. For if in the  
.allowance nothing more is proposed than a mere  
reimbursement of the sum advanced, it is only  
paying a debt ; and when we pay a debt, we  
ought not to claim themerit of granting a bounty.  
It is supposed by some gentlemen, that Con­  
greft have authority not only to grant bounties  
in the ferife here used, merely as a commutation  
for drawbacks ; but even to grant them under a  
power by virtue of which they may do any thing  
■which they may think conducive to the &quot; gene­  
ral welfare.&quot; This, Sir, in my mind raises the  
important and fundamental question ; whether  
the general terms which have been cited, are to  
be considered as a fort of caption or general de­  
scription of the fpecified powers, and as having  
no further meaning, and giving no further pow­  
er, than what is found in that fpecification, or  
as an abftradt an-1 indefinite.delegation of pow­  
er extending to all cases whatever ; to all   
at least as will admit the application of money,  
which is giving as much latitude as any govern  
ment could well desire.  
  
J, Sir, ha«e always conceived,—I believe those  
who proposedtihe constitution conceived, and it is  
still niore stilly known, and more material toob­  
ferve, t{iat those who ratified the constitution  
conceived, that this is not an indefinite govern­  
ment, deriving its powers from thegeneral terms  
prefixed to the fpecified powers, but a limitted  
government, tied down- to the fpecified powers,  
which explain and define the general terms.  
  
The gentlemen who contend for a contrary  
doctrine are surely not aware of the consequenc­  
es which flow from it, and which they mull ei­  
ther admit or give up their do&lt;ftrine.  
  
It will follow in the firft place that if theterms  
be taken in the broad sense they maintain, the  
particular powers afterwards so carefully and  
cliftin«ftly enumerated would be without mean­  
ing, and tn nit go for nothing. It would be ab  
find to fay firft, that Congress may dowhatthev  
please, and then that they may&#x27;do this or that  
particular thing ; after giving Congress power  
to ra&#x27;rfe money and apply it to all put pofcs which  
they may pronounce neceflary to the general wel­  
fare, it would be absurd, to fay the least, fuper­  
add a power to raise armies, to provide fleets,  
&amp;c. In fact t&#x27; t meaning of the general terms in  
question niuft either be fought in the subsequent  
enumeration which limits and details them ; or  
they convert the government from one limitted  
as hitherto supposed, to the enumerated powers,  
into a government without any limits at all.  
  
lt is to be recollected that tht terms &quot; common  
defence and general welfare&quot; as here used, are  
not novel terms fir ft introduced into this confti  
tution. They are terms familiar in their con­  
ftrti&amp;ion and well known to the people of Ame­  
rica.  
  
They are repeatedly found in the old articles  
of confederation, where altho they are fufcepti  
ble of as great latitude as can be given theip by  
the context here, it was never supposed or pre-  
  
ended tliat they conveyed any such power as is  
  
now assigned to them. On the contrary, it was  
always cotifidered as clear and certain, that the  
old Congress was limitted to the enumerated  
powers ; and that the enumeration limitted and  
explained the general terms. I alk the gentle­  
men themselves whether it ever was supposed or  
  
ufpetfted that the old Congress could give away  
lie monies of che dates in bounties, to encou-  
  
rage agriculture, or for any other purpose they  
plea fed. If such a power had been pofTelTed by  
that body, it would have been much less impo­  
tent, or have borne a very different character  
from that universally ascribed to it.  
The novel idea now annexed to these terms,  
Sand never before entertained by the friends or  
enemies of the government, will have a further  
consequence which cannot have been taken into  
the view of the gentlemen. Their conftrudtion  
would not only give Congress the compleat legis­  
lative power 1 have dated : it would do more ;  
it would fupercede all the reftricftions understood  
at present to lie on their power with reipedt to  
the judiciary. It would put it in the power of  
Congress to establish courts throughout the Unit­  
ed States, with cognizance of suits between citi­  
zen and citizen, and in all cases whatsoever.  
This, Sir, seems to be demonstrable : for if the  
clause in question really authorises Congress to  
do whatever they think fit, provided it be for the  
general welfare, of which they are to judge, and  
money can be applied to it, Congress mull have  
power to create and support a judiciary establish­  
ment, with a jurifdidliori extending to all cases  
favorable in their opinion tothe general welfare,  
in the fame manner as they have power to pais  
laws and apply money, providing in any other  
way for the general welfare—l lhall be remind­  
ed perhaps, that according to the terms of the  
constitution the judicial power is to extend to cer­  
tain cases only, not to a&#x27;l cases. But this circurn­  
{tance can have no effect in the argument, it be­  
ing presupposed by the gentlemen that the fpe­  
cification of certain obje&gt;fts does not limit the im­  
port of general terms. Taking these terms as  
an abrtratfl and indefinite grant of power, they  
comprize all the objects of legislative regulation,  
as well such as fall under the judiciary article  
in the constitution, as those falling immediately  
under the legislative article ; and if the partial  
enumeration of objecfts in the legislative article  
does not, as these gentlemen contend, limit the  
general power, neither will it be limitted by the  
partial enumeration of objeifts in the judiciary  
article.  
  
There are consequences, Sir, still more   
five, which, as they follow clearly from the doc  
  
trine combated, mull either be admitted, or the  
dotflrine must be given up. If Congress cin ap­  
ply money indefinitely to the general welfare,  
and are the sole and (upreme judges of thegene­  
ral welfare, they may take the care of religion  
into their own hands ; they may eftabli/li teach­  
ers in every state, county, and parifli, and pay  
them out of the public treasury ; they may take  
into their own hands the education of children,  
establishing in like manner schools throughout  
the union ; they may undertake the regulation  
of all roads, other than pod roads : in short, eve­  
ry thing, from the higbeft objedl of state legisla­  
tion. down to the molt minute objecft of police,  
would be throwri under the power of Congress ;  
for every objecft I have mentioned would admit  
the application of money, arid might be called,  
if Congress pleased, provisions for the general  
welfare.  
The language held in various difcuflions of  
this house, is a proof that the dodtrine in questi­  
on was never entertained by this body. Argu­  
ments, wherever the fubjedt would permit, have  
constantly been drawn from the peculiar nature  
of this government as limitted to certain enume­  
rated powers, instead of extending, like other  
governments, to all cases not particularly except­  
ed. In a very late instance, 1 mean the debate  
on the representation bill, it must be remember­  
ed, that an argument much urged, particularly  
by a gentleman from Mafl&#x27;achufetts, againii the  
atio of one for 30,000, was t hat this government  
was unlike the state governments, which had an  
ndefinite variety of objects vmhin their power,  
that it had a fina.ll number of objects only to at­  
tend to, and therefore that a smaller number of  
reprefencatives would be fufficient to administer  
it.  
  
Several arguments have been advanced rofhew  
that becaiife, in tlie regulation of trade, indirect  
and eventual encouragement is given to manu­  
factures, therefore Congress have power to give  
money in direct bounties, or to grant it in any  
other way that would answer the fame purpose :  
But finely, Sir, there is a grea: and obvious dif­  
ference which it cannot be necessary to enlarge  
upon. A duty laid on imported implements of  
husbandry, would in its operation be an indirect  
tax on exported prod.uce ; but will any one fay,  
that by virtue of a mere power to lay duties on  
imports, Congress might go dire&lt;Ttlv to the pro­  
duce or implements of agriculture, or to the ar­  
ticles exported. It is true, duties on exports are  
expressly prohibited ; but if there were no arti­  
  
358  
  
ele forbidding them a power directly to tax e&gt;t.  
port&#x27;s could nev-r be deduced from a power t0  
tax imports, although such a power might direct­  
ly and iricidently affect exports  
  
In fhorc, Sir, without&#x27;going farther into the,!  
fubje*Tt, which I should not have here touched |  
at all but for the reasons already mentioned..^*®  
  
I venture to declare it as my opinio.n, that were  
power of Congress tobe established in the   
contended for, it would subvert the very   
on, and tranfinute the very natiure of the limit-■*!

Mr. Madifin, In the conflie Lfeel between my difpofition, on One hand, to afford  
  
every conttitational encourirement to the fisheries, and my diflike, on the other, of  
the confequences apprehended from fome claufes in the bill, I fuould have forborne  
to enter into this difcuffion, if had not found that in diicufling it, over ana above fuch  
arguments asappear to be natural and pertinent to the itubjet, others have been intro-  
duced, which are, in my judgment, contrary to the true meaning, and even ftrike at  
the characteriftic principles of the exifting conflitution. Let me premife, however,  
  
to the remarks which I thall bricfly offer, on the dodtrine maintained by thefe gentle  
  
men, that | moke a material diftinGion in the prefent cafe, between an allowance as  
a mere commutection and modification of a drawback, and an allowancevin the nature  
of areal and politive bounty. I make a diftinQion allo, asa fubjcct of fair confidera-  
tion at leaft, between a bounty granted under the particular terms in the conftite-  
tion, * a power to regulate trade,” and one granted under the indefinite terms,  
which have been cited as authority on this occafion, I think, however, that the germ  
  
“bounty ’ isin every point of view improper, as it is here applied, not only hedaule  
it may be ofenfive to fome, and in the opinion of others, carries a dangerous implic  
tion ; but alfo becaufe it docs ne: exprefs the true intention of the bill, as avowed  
and advocated by its patrons themfe!wes. For if in the allowance nothing more is pro-  
pofed than a mere reimburfement of the fum advanced, it is on!y paying a debt; and  
when we pay a debt, we ought not to claim the merit of granting a bounty.  
  
It is fuppoted by fome gentlemen, that congrefs have autherity not only to grant  
hounties, in the fenfe here ufed, merely as 2 commutation for drawbacks; but even to  
grant them under a power by virtue of which they may do any thing which they  
may think conducive to the “ general welfare.” This, fir, in my mind, raifes the im-  
portant and fundamental queftion ; whether the general terms which have been cited,  
are to be confidered as a fort uf capitation or general defcription of the fpecilied

wers, and as having no further meaning, and giving no further power, than what is  
re in that fpecification, or as an abitract and definite delegation of power extend-  
ing to all cafes whatever ; to all fuch, at leaft, as will admit the application ef money,  
which is giving as much latitude as any government could weil defire.  
  
1, fir, have always conccived,---I belicve thofe who propefed the conftitution con-  
ceived, and at is ftill more fully knowa, and more matcrial to obferve, that thele who  
ratified the confkitution conceived, that this is not an indefinite government, deriving  
its powers from the general terms prefixed to the f{pecified powers, but a limited  
government, tied down to the {pecilied powers, which explain and define the general  
terms.  
  
The gentlemen who contend for a contrary doctrine, are furely not aware of the  
confequences which flow from it, and which they mutt cither admi:, or give up their  
doctrine,  
  
It will follow, in the firft place, that if the terms be taken in the broad fenfe they  
maintain, the particular powers afcerwards, fo carefully and diftin&amp;ly enumerated,  
would be without meaning, and muf go for nothing. It would be abfurd to fay firft,  
that congrefs may do what they plcafe, and then that they may do this or that parti-  
cular thing ; after giving congrefs power to raife money, and apply it to all purpoles  
which they may pronounce neceflary to the general welfare, it would be ablurd, to  
fuperadd a power to raife armies, to provide fleets, &amp;c. In fad, the meaning of the  
general terms in queftion, muft either be feught in the fubfequent enumeration, which  
limits and details them ; or they convert the yovernment from one limited, as hither-  
to fuppofed, to the enumerated powers, intoa government without any limits at all.  
  
Iris to be recollected, that the terms “ common defence and general welfare,” as  
  
here ufed, are not novel terms, firft introduced into this confitution. They are terms  
familiar in their conftruction, and weil known to the people of America.  
  
They are repeatedly found in the old articles of confederatien, where, although they  
are fuceptible of as great latitude as can be given them by the context here, it was ne-  
ver fuppofed or pretended that they contained any fuch power as is now afligned to  
  
them. On the contrary, it was always confidered as clear and certain, that the old  
  
congrefs could not give away the monies of the flates in bounties, to encourage agri  
  
culture, or for any other purpofe they pleafed. If fuch a power had been poflefled by  
that body, it would have been much Iefs impotent, or have borne a very different cha-  
tacter from that univerfally afcribed to it.  
  
The novel idea now annexed to thefe terms, and never before entertained by the  
friends or enemieS of the government, will have a further confequence, which cannot  
  
have been taken into the view of the gentlemen. ‘Their conftrudiion would not only  
give congrefs the complete legiflative power! have flated: it would do more; is  
would fupercede all the reftrictions underftowd at prefent to lie in their power, with  
refpe&amp;t to the judiciary. It would put it in the power of congrefs to eftablith courts  
throughout the united flates, with cognizance of fuits between citizen and citizen, and  
in all cafes whatfoever. ‘This, fir, feems to be demontltrable: for if the claufe in  
  
quettion really authorifes congrefs to do whatever they think fit, provided it be for the  
  
general welfare, of which they are to judge, and money can be applied to it, congrefs  
muft have power to create and fupport a judiciary eftablifhment, with a jurifdiaion  
extending to all cafes favourable in their opinion to the general welfare, in the fame  
manner as they have power to pafs Jaws and apply money, providing in any other  
way for the general welfare—lI fhall be reminded perhaps, that, according to the  
  
terms of the conftitution, the judicial power is to extend to certain cafes only, not to  
  
allcafes, But this circumfance can have no effect in the argument, it being prefup-  
pofed by the gentlemen, that the {pecification of certain objects does net limit the im-  
port of general terms. Taking thefe termsas an abfira&amp; and indefinite grant of pow-  
er, they comprife all the objcéts of legiflative regulation, as well fech as fall under the  
judiciary articke in the conftitution, as thofe falling immediately under the legiflative  
article ; andif the partial enumeration of objects in the legiflative article does not, as  
thefe gentlemen contend, limit the general power, neither will it be limited by the  
partial enumeration of objects in the judiciary article.  
  
There are confequencet, fir, ftill more extenfive, which, as they follow clearly from  
the do&amp;trine combated, muft either be admitted, or the doétrine muft be given up.  
If congrefs can apply moncy indefinitely to the general welfare, and are the fole and  
fupreme judges yf the general welfare, they may take che care ef rcligion into theis own

hands; they may eftablith teachers in every flate, county, and parith, and pay  
them out of the public treafury; they may take into their own hands the edu-  
cation of children, eftablithing in like manner {chools throughout the union;  
they may undertake the regulation of all roads, other than poft roads: Ig  
fhort, every thing, from the higheft objec of Rate leyiflation, down to the moi mi-  
nute object of pouce, would be thrown under the power of congreis; for every ob-  
je@t I have mentioned would admit the application of moncy, and might be called, if  
&lt;qnyrefs pleaied, provifions for the general welfare.  
  
‘Phe language held in various difcoflions of this howfe, is a preof that the dorine  
in quetiion was never entertained in this body. Arguments, wherever the fubje@  
would permit, have conflantly been drawn from the peculiar nature of this government,  
as limited to certain enumerated powers, inftead of extending, like ether yovernments,  
to all places not particularly excepted. In a very late inftance, I mean the debate on  
the reprefentation bill, it muft be remembered, that an argument much urged, particu-  
larly by a gentleman from Maflachufetts, againft the ratio of one for 30,co0, was that  
this government was unlike the flate governments, which had an indefinite variety of  
objects within their power, that it had a fmall number of objects only to attend tw,  
and therefore that a imaller number of reprefentatives would be fuflicicut to adminil-  
tcr it.  
  
Several arguments have been advanced to fhew that, becaufe, in the regulation of  
trade, indirect and eventual encouragement is given to manufaGures, therefore con-  
grefs have power to give moncy in dire&amp; bounties, or to grant it in any other way  
that would anfwer the fame purpofe; but furely, fir, there is a great and obvious dil-  
ference, which it cannot be neceflary to en arge upon. A duty laid on imporied im  
plements of hufbandry, would, in its operasion, be an indirect tax on exported pro  
duce ; but will any one fay, that, by virtue of a mere power to lay duties on imports,  
congrefs might go direcly to the produce or impicments of agriculture, or to the ar  
ticles exported. It is true, duties on exports are exprcfsly rohibited; but if there  
were no article forbidding them, a power dire&amp;ily to tax e&gt; ports could never be de-  
duced from a power to tax impurts, although ijuch a power might dire@ly and ini-  
dentally affeQ exports.  
  
in thort, fir, without going further into the fubje@, which I fhould not have here  
touched on at all, but fur the reafuns already mentioned.—I venture to declare it a  
my © iaion, that, were the power of cougreis to be eftablifhed in the latitude contend-  
ed jor, it would fubvert the very foundation, and tranimute the vgry nature of the  
limited government cftablithed by the people of America :—and what inference  
might be drawn, or what confequences enfue from fuch a flep, it is incumbent on ws  
all well to confider.  
  
With refpedt to the queftion hefore the houfe, for friking out the c’aufe, it is imma-  
terial whether it be flruck out, or fo amended as to rett on the avowed principle ofa  
commutation for the drawback ; but as a claufle has been drawn up by my colieague,

ple of every trade and occupation may enter at the breach  
until they have eaten up the bread of our children.  
  
Mr. Mapison.—It is supposed by some gentlemen, that  
Congress had authority not onlyto grant bounties in the  
sense here used, merely as a commutation for drawback,  
but even to grant them under a power by virtue of which  
they may do any thing which they may think conducive  
to the general welfare! This, sir, im my mind, raises the  
important and fundamental question, whether the general  
terms which have been cited, are to be considered as a sort of  
caption or general description of the specified powers, and  
as having no further meaning, and giving no further pow-  
ers than what is found in that specification, or as an ab-  
stract and indefinite delegation of power extending to all  
cases whatever; to all such at least as will admit the ap-  
plication of money, which is giving as much latitude as  
any government could well desire. » ,  
  
I, sir, have always conceived—I believed those who  
proposed the constitution conceived-—it is still more fully  
known, and more material to obs that those who rati-  
fied the constitution conceived, that this is not an indes-  
nite government, deriving its’ powets from the general  
terms prefixed to the specified powers—but a limited go-  
vernment tied down to the specified powers, which explain  
and define the general terms.  
  
It is to be recollected, that the terms “ common defence  
and general welfare,” as here used, are not novel terms  
first introduced into this constitution. They are terms  
familiar in their construction, and well known to the people  
of America. They are re ly found in the articles  
of confederation, where, although they are susceptible of  
as great a latitude as can be given them by the context  
here, it was never supposed or pretended that they convey-  
ed any such power as is now assigned to them. On the  
contrary, it was always considered clear and certain, that  
the old Congress was limited to the enumerated powers ;  
and that the enumeration limi ed 4nd explained the gen-  
eralterms. [ask the gentlemen themselves, whether it  
ever was su or suspected, that the old Congress  
could give away the money of the States in bounties to  
encourage agriculture or for any other purpose they  
  
. Ifsuch a power had been possessed by any body,  
it would have been much less impotent, or have borne a  
very different character from that universally ascribed to it.  
  
The novel idea now annexed to those terms, and never  
before entertained by the friends or enemies of the go-  
vernment, will have a further consequence which cannot  
have been taken into the view of the gentleman. Their  
construction would not only give Congress the complete  
legislative power I have stated ; it would do more; it would  
supersede all the restrictions understood at present to lie  
on their power with respect to a judiciary. It would put  
it in the power of Congress to establish courts throughout  
the United States with cognizance of suits between citizen  
and citizen, and in all cases whatsoever. This, sir, seems to  
be demonstrable; for if the clause in question really author-  
izes Congress to do whatever they think fit, provided  
it be for the general welfare, of which they are to judge,  
and money can be applied to it, Congress must have pow-  
er to create and support a judiciary establishment, with a  
jurisdiction extending to all cases, favorable, in their  
opinion, to the general welfare, in the same manner as  
they have power to pass laws, and apply money providing  
it any other way for the general welfare. I shall be remind-  
ed, perhaps, that, according to the terms of the constitu-  
tion, the judicial power is to extend to certain cases only,  
not to all cases.  
  
*  
  
eis.  
a” =  
ae  
  
But this circumstance can have no ef- &#x27;  
  
men, that the specification of certain objects does not lirait  
the import of the genera! terms. ‘Taking these terms as  
  
an abstract and indefinite grant of power, they comprise  
  
all the objects of the legislative regulations, as well  
  
such as fall under the judiciary article in the constitution,  
  
as those falling immediately under the legislative article ;  
  
and if the partial enumeration of objects in the legislative  
  
article does not, as these gentlemen contend, limit the  
  
general power, neither will it be limited by the partial  
  
enumeration of objects in the judiciary article.  
  
There are consequences, sir, still more extensive, which,  
as they follow clearly from the doctrine combatted, must  
either be admitted, or the doctrine must be given up. If  
Congress can employ money indefinitely to the general  
welfare, and are the sole and supreme judges of the gen-  
eral welfare, they may take the care of religion imto their  
own hands; they may appoint teachers in every State,  
county and parish, and pay them outof their public treasu-  
ry: they may take into their own hands the education of  
children, establishing in like manner schools throughout  
the union; they may assume the provision for the poor;  
they may undertake the regulation of all roads other than  
post roads ; in short, every thing from the highest object of  
State legislation, down to the most minute objectof police,  
would be thrown under the power of Congress ; for every  
object I have mentioned would admit of the application of  
money, and might be called, if Congress pleased, provi-  
sions for the genera] welfare.  
  
The language held in various discussions of this house,  
is a proof that the doctrine in question was never enter-  
tained by this body. Arguments, wherever the subject  
would permit, have constantly been drawn from the pecu-  
liar nature of this government as limited to certain enu-  
merated powers, instead of extending, like other govern-  
ments, to all cases not partieularly excepted. Ina very  
late instance, I mean the debate on the representation bill,  
it must be remembered that am argument much used, par-  
ticularly by gentlemen from ‘Massachusetts, against the  
ratio of 1 for 30,000, was that this government was unlike  
the State governments, which had an indefinite variety of  
objects within their power, that it had a smaller number of  
objects only attended to, and therefore that a smaller  
number of representatives would be sufficient to admims-  
ter it.  
  
Arguments have been advanced to show, that because,  
in the regulation of trade, indirect and eventual encourage-  
ment is given to manufactures, therefore Congress have  
power to give money in direet bounties, or to grant it in  
any other way that would answer the same purpose. But  
surely, gir, there is a great and obvious difference, which  
it cannot be necessary to enlarge upon; a duty laid on  
unported implements of husbandry, would in its operation  
be an indirect tax on exported produce ; but will amy one  
say that by virtue of a mere power to lay duties on imports,  
Congress might go directly to the produce or implements  
of agriculture, or to the atticles exported? It is true,  
duties on exports are expressly prohibited; but if there  
were no article forbidding\them, @ power directly to tax  
oxports, would never &quot;Dohber age aaa @ power 4o tax. im-  
tally affect exports. :  
  
In short, sir, without going farther into the subject,  
which I should not have here touched on at all, but for the  
reasons already mentioned, I venture to declare it as my  
opinion, that were the power of Congress to be established  
in the latitude contended for, it would subvert the very  
foundation, and transmute the very mature of the limited  
government established by the people of America: and  
what inferences might be drawn, or what consequences  
ensue from such 4 step, it is incumbent on us all to con-  
sider.

and occupation may enter at the breach  
until they have eaten up the bread of  
car children.  
M a. M vtvson.—It is supposed by  
some gentlemen, that Congress had au­  
thority not only to grant bounties in the  
sense here used, merely as a commuta­  
tion for drawback, but even to grant  
them under a power by virtue of which  
they may do any thing they may think  
condueive to trie general welfare i This,  
sir, in tnv mind, raises the important and  
fundamental question, whether the ge­  
neral terms which have been cited, are  
t &gt; he considered as a sort of caption or  
general description of the specified pow­  
ers, and as having*no farther meaning,  
and «iving aa farther powers than what  
iS found in that specification, or as an  
abstract and indefinite delegation of  
power extending to all cases whatever;  
to all such at least as will admit the ap­  
plication of jr.oaey, which is giving as  
  
• miich latitude as any government could  
well desire.  
i, sir, always conceived—I believed  
those who proposed the constitution  
.! rAR&lt;v iveirl—it is still more fully known,  
;j arid more material to observe, that those  
&#x27; who ratified the constitution conceived,  
that this is not an indefinite government,  
j deriving its powers from the general  
I terms prefixed to the specified powers;  
; but (i limited government tied down to the  
; specified powers, which, explain and define  
the. general terms.  
it it. to he recollected, that the terms  
“common defence and general welfare,  
as here used, are not novel terms lirst  
introduced into this constitution, ’ he}&#x27;  
are terms familiar in their construction, j  
and v/edl known to the people of Ameri- j  
ca. They arc repeatedly found in the j  
articles of confederation, where, alt ho* !  
i they are susceptible of as great a lati-j  
tude as can be given them by the i:on- j  
1 text here, it was neversupposed or pre­  
tended that they conveyed any such pow­  
er as is now assigned to them. On the  
contrary, it was always considered clear  
and certain, that the old Congress was  
limited to the enumerated powers: and  
that the enumeration limited and ex­  
plained the general terms. I ask the  
gentlemen themselves, whether it ever  
was supposed or suspected, that tire old  
Congress could giveaway the money ot  
the States in bounties to encourage ag­  
riculture or for any other purpose they  
pleased. It such a power had been  
possessed by any body, it would have  
been much less impotent, or have borne  
a very different character from that uni­  
versally ascribed to it.  
  
The novel idea now annexed to those  
terms, and never before entertained by  
the friends or enemies of the govern­  
ment, will have a farther consequence  
widen cannot have been taken into the  
view of the gentlemen. Their con­  
struction would not on!) give Congress  
the complete legislative power 1 have  
stated; it would domore:it would su­  
percede a’ithe restrictions understood  
at present to lie on their power with ’  
respect to a judiciary. It would put it  
in*the power of Congress to establish  
courts throughout the United States  
with cognizance of suits between citi­  
zen and citizen, and in all cases what­  
soever. Tiii?, sir, seems to be demon­  
strable; for if the clause in question real­  
ly authorises Congress to do whatever  
they think tit, provided it be for the  
general welfare of which they are to  
judge and money can be applied to it,  
Congress most have power to ~c rente  
and support a judiciary establishment,  
with a jurisdiction extending to all ca­  
ses, favorable, in their opinion, to the  
general welware, in the same manner as  
they have power to pass&#x27; laws, and ap  
ply money providing it any ether way  
lot* the general welfare. I shall be re­  
minded, perhaps, that, according to the  
terms of the constitution, the judicial  
power is to extend to certain cases only,  
not to all cases- But this circumstance  
can have noefiect in the argument, itbe­  
ing^iresupposeci by the gentlemen, that:  
the &#x27;Specification of certain objects does j  
not limit tiie import of the general terms, j  
Taking these terms as an abstract and  
i defini te grant of power, they comprise  
all tile objects of the legislative regula­  
tions, as well such as fail u der the ju- j  
diciary article in the constitution, as!  
those failing immediately under the  
legislative article; and if tiie partial  
enumeration of objects in the legislative  
article does not, as these gentlemen con­  
tend, limit the general power, neither  
will it be limited by the partial enu­  
meration of objects in the judiciary ar­  
ticle.  
  
i uere are consequences,sir, still more  
extensive, which, as they follow dearly  
from the doctrine combatted, must either  
be admitted, or the doctrine must he giv­  
en up. If Congress can employ money  
indefinitely to the general welfare, and  
are the Sule and supreme judges of the  
general welfare, they may take the  
care of religion into their own hands;  
! they may appoint teachers in every  
State, county and parish, and pay  
them out of their public treasury: they  
may take into their own hands the edu­  
cation of children, establishing in like  
manner schools throughout the union;  
they may assume the provision for the  
poor; they may undertake the regula­  
tion of all roads other than post roads;  
in short, every thing from the highest  
object of State legislation, down to the  
most minute object of police, would be  
thrown under the power of Congress; for  
every object I have mentioned would
