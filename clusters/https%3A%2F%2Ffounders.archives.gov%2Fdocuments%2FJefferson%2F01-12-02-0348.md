his article.—I do not know whether it is to yourself or Mr. Adams I am to give my thanks for the copy of the new constitution. I beg leave through you to place them where due. It will be yet three weeks before I shall receive them from America. There are very good articles in it: and very bad. I do not know which preponderate. What we have lately read in the history of Holland, in the chapter on the Stadtholder, would have sufficed to set me against a Chief magistrate eligible for a long duration, if I had ever been disposed towards one: and what we have always read of the elections of Polish kings should have forever excluded the idea of one continuable for life. Wonderful is the effect of impudent and persevering lying. The British ministry have so long hired their gazetteers to repeat and model into every form lies about our being in anarchy, that the world has at length believed them, the English nation has believed them, the ministers themselves have come to believe them, and what is more wonderful, we have believed them ourselves. Yet where does this anarchy exist? Where did it ever exist, except in the single instance of Massachusets? And can history produce an instance of a rebellion so honourably conducted? I say nothing of it’s motives. They were founded in ignorance, not wickedness. God forbid we should ever be 20. years without such a rebellion. The people can not be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had 13. states independant 11. years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each state. What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it’s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it’s natural manure. Our Convention  has been too much impressed by the insurrection of Massachusets: and in the spur of the moment they are setting up a kite to keep the hen yard in order. I hope in god this article will be rectified before the new constitution is accepted.—You ask me if any thing transpires here on the subject of S. America? Not a word. I know that there are combustible materials there, and that they wait the torch only. But this country probably will join the extinguishers.—The want of facts worth communicating to you has occasioned me to give a little loose to dissertation. We must be contented to amuse, when we cannot inform.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Dear SiR.-I do not know whether it is  
to yourself or Mr Adams, I am to give my  
thanks for the oopy of the new Constitu  
tion. I beg leave, through you, to place  
them where due. It will yet be three weeks  
before I shall receive them from America,  
There are very good articles in it, and very  
had; I do not know which preponderate.  
W hat we have lately read in the history of  
lland, in the chapter on the Stadtholder,  
would have sufficed to set me against a  
chief magistrate eligible for a long dura­  
tion, if I had ever been disposed toward  
once; and what we have always read of the  
election of Polish kings should have for­  
ever excluded the idea of one continuable  
for life.   
Wonderfut is the effect of impudent and  
persevering lying. The British ministry  
have so long hired their gaze-teers to re­  
peat and model into every form lies about  
our living in anarchy, that the world has  
at length believed them; the English nation  
has believed them; the ministers them­  
selves have come to believe them; and  
what is more wonderful, we have believed  
them ourselves. Yet where does that ans  
archy exist--where did it ever exist, ex­  
cept in the single case of Massachusetts.  
And can history produce an instance of  
rebellion so honorably conducted. I say  
nothing of its motives; they were founded  
in ignoränce, not wickedness. God forbid  
that we should ever be twenty years with­  
out such a rebellion. The poeple cannot  
always be well informed. The part which  
is wrong will be misconstruced in  
proportion to the importance of the faets  
they misconceive. If the remain oifiet  
under such misconceptions, it is lethargy,  
the forerunner of death to the public liber­  
ty. We have had thirteen States indepen­  
dent for eleven years. There has been one  
rebellion; that comes to the rebellion in  
century and a half for each State. What  
country before ever existed a century and  
a half without a rebellion? And what  
country can préserve its liberties, if its  
rulers are not warned, from time to time  
that this people preserve the spirit or re­  
sistance.-Let them take arms; the remedy  
is to set them right as to facts. Pardon  
and pacily them. What signify a few  
lives lost in a century or two.The tree of  
 liberty must be refreshed from time to  
time, with the blood of patriots and trait  
ors--It is its natural manure.  
I am, with much affection, dear sir,  
your most obedient and most humble ser­  
an Thowas Terrseser
