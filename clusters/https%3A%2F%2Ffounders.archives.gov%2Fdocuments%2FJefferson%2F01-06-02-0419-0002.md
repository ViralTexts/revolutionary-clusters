are, whether land ‘is pro-  
perly denominated an island of the Ohio, unless it  
be surrounded with the water of the river, when  
low? and whether Kentucky was bounded on the  
west and northwest by the low water mark of the  
river, or at-its middle state? or, in other words,  
whether the State of Indiana extends to low water  
mark, or stops at the line reached by the river when  
at its medium height ?  
  
In pursuing this inquiry, we must recollect that  
it is not the bank of the river, but.the river itself, at  
which the cession of Virginia commences. She  
conveys to Congress all her right to the territory  
“situate, lying, and being, to the northwest of the  
‘river Ohio.” And this territory, according to express  
stipulation, is to be laid off into independent States.  
These States, then, are to have the river itself,  
wherever that may he, for their boundary. This is  
a natural boundary, and in establishing it, Virginia  
must have had in view the convenience of the future  
population of the country.

and principles, which we presume no candid  
or fairminded man will deny, we shall under.  
take to show, that the first objection is un  
founded.  
The Virginia cession was by far the most  
important, and because the others followed it  
out in their stipulations we will take that as  
the basis of our argument. This took place  
by an act of the Legislature of Virginia, of  
20th October, 1783, which was accepted by  
Congress March 1st, 1794. After proposing to  
&quot;Convey, transfer, assign and make over un­

&quot;benefit of the said States, all right, title and

&quot;Virginia charter, situate, lying and being, to
