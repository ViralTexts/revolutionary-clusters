apparent injury from frost or snow, and is transformed into a fly as soon as the weather becomes warm enough in the spring. The period of time in which this transformation is made will begin more or less early according as the season may be more or less forward, and generally continues according to our observations about three weeks: in the year eighty seven we observed it to begin about the sixteenth of april, and end about the first of may; and this we think may be considered as the usual time of its commencement and continuance in our climate. The fly disengages itself from the wheat, by boring a small round hole through its brown case, and through the leaf of the wheat just opposite to the place where it is lodged, and comes forth wrapt in a thin white skin, which it soon breaks, and is then at liberty; and this hole is to be seen in the stubble as long as it remains entire. Very soon after the fly comes out, it is prepared to spread itself every where in the field where it has lain during the winter, or to take its flight to more distant places in search of wheat on which to lay its nits or maggots; and it is at this time that it has an opportunity of going on the summer wheat, which would otherwise escape without being injured. The great variety in the time of its first becoming a fly in the spring, produces the like variety in the time of its laying the maggot on the wheat, but this we suppose may be generally placed between the twentieth of april and the tenth of may; and this period of

s be affected by bad weather and unfavourable winds, which may benumb the fly, or prevent it from taking its flight. The maggot is always found between the inside of the lowest part of the leaf, and the outside of the part which forms the stalk or straw, to which it closely adheres, and is generally, as near the root as possible; but to this there are some few exceptions for it is sometimes, tho’ very rarely, to be found a little above some of the upper joints. It appears at first like a very small white nit or egg; and as it grows larger becomes a sluggish, and almost inanimate maggot, or worm, of a white colour, and capable of very little perceivable motion. This is properly the first state or mode of existence with the insect, and is that in which it destroys the wheat; and altho’ it appears at first to resemble a nit or egg, yet we are inclined to suppose that the fly is viviparous, for we never could discover that any transformation took place from a nit to a maggot. In this state the proper and most natural food of the insect is the sap or juice of that kind of green wheat which has the most delicate straw, and next to this may be ranked the several kinds of wheat whose straw is more firm and solid, and last of all rye and barley: some have  affirmed that they have been found on oats, but of this we have no certain knowledge. The maggot obtains the juice altogether by suction, and has no means or faculty of corroding or consuming the solid part of the straw, and as it grows larger its whole body indents the straw, and prevents the rise of the sap, and the grain either falls down or perishes before it has grown to be of any considerable height. The size of the maggot when grown, and the time necessary to compleat its growth, depend in a considerable degree on the quantity of nourishment it may obtain from the grain, and the number of them that may happen to be on one straw; and this time according to our observations is somewhere between four and six weeks, and their growth will generally be compleated in the first part of June: but here the several causes of variety before mentioned conspire to render this time so various that some will be transformed into a chrysalis, whilst others are small, and this circumstance has led many skilful observers to suppose that there are two compleat generations of the insect before harvest.

A reflection here naturally arises, that nature appears to have fixt this transformation, to commence with, and continue through, the whole of that season of the year which is most proper for sowing wheat. The fly is the third and last state of the insect, and compleats what we term one generation: it resembles the moscheto in almost every r

We have before us a treatise on the Hessian  
Fly, written in 1792, by Jonathan N. Havens,once  
a member of the House of Representatives, a man  
of acute mind. He states, as the result of his ob-  
servations,there are two generations of this insect  
in the year—that it “ has no dependence upon the  
wheat in grain, either for food, or #s a place in  
  
which to deposit any nit or egg for the preserva. |  
| tion of its species : but is in the winter season a |  
chrysalie, and remains through the whole winter °  
  
in the field on the green wheat, without sufferin  
any apparent injury from frost or snow, cam  
is transformed into a fly, as soon as the weather  
becomes warm enough in the spring.’”? The time  
when this (ra sformation begins, depends upon  
the temperature of the air, and therefore varies in  
the same country : but he estimates this trans-  
formation to take place in an average period of  
about three weeks. ‘ The fly disengages itsclf  
from the wheat by boring a small round hole  
through the brown (chrysaline) case in which it  
is enclosed, and through the leaf of the wheat just  
een to the place where it is lodged, and this  
hole may be easily discovered as long as the stub-  
ble remains entire. The fly, very soon after it  
comes out, is prepared to spread itselfin the  
field where it has lain ¢  
  
going on to suningr wheat, which would other-  
wise escape without being injured. The great  
variety in the time of its first coming out, produ-  
ces the like variety in the time of its depositing  
the egg or the maggot, but this may be generally  
placed between the 20th of April and the 10th of  
May (in Jsong*istand ;) but this too depends up-

_ Mr. H. proposes, as a means of getting rid of  
it, or at least of circumscribing its ravages, Ist,  
to destray the stubble of grain soon after the harvest,  
by which most of the chrysalis will be destroyed :  
and, 2diy, to cultivate principally, the different  
sorts of bearded wheat—which have a more solid  
straw than the bald wheat, resists the impression  
made by the body of the insect, aad ina great  
measure prevents the injury, which arises from  
preventing the rise of the sap.

Early in autumn they pass into the

When tbe fly is about to issue from  
the pupa into the stale of pei feci insect,  
it disengages itself by boring a small  
round hole through the biown case in  
which it is enclosed, and through the

With regard to the time of undergo  
ing its final transformation the firs  
time in the season, Judge Havens ob­  
serves, &quot;The size of the maggot whet  
full grown, and the time necessary tc  
complete its growth, depend in a grca  
degree upon the quantity of nourish­  
ment it may obtain from the grain, &amp;  
the number of maggots that may hap­  
pen to be on one straw. This, aecor.  
ding to the best of my observations,  
I is somewhere between four and six  
weeks, which will bring the time, in  
which its growth will generally be  
completed, to the first part of June.  
But here the several causes in the va­  
riation in the time of its being laid in  
the wheat, and of its completing its  
growth, both conspire to render this  
time so various, that some will be full  
grown, and others transformed into a  
chrysalis [pupa], while others are  
small, and this circumstance has no  
doubt ted many skilful observers to  
suppose, that there are two complete  
generations of the insect before har­

the whole month of September, but by  
far the greater part of the species are
