rs, among whom he probably was not personally well acquainted with a single one.  
  
[November 29, 1766]To Messieurs the Public and Co.  
I Am one of that class of people that feeds you all, and at present is abus’d by you all; in short I am a Farmer.  
By your News-papers we are told, that God had sent a very short harvest to some other countries of Europe. I thought this might be in favour to Old England; and that now we should get a good price for our grain, which would bring in millions among us, and make us flow in money, that to be sure is scarce enough.  
But the wisdom of Government forbad the exportation.  
  
Well, says I, then we must be content with the market price at home.  
No, says my Lords the mob, you sha’n’t have that. Bring your corn to market if you dare; we’ll sell it for you, for less money, or take it for nothing.  
Being thus attack’d by both ends of the Constitution, the head and the tail of Government, what am I to do?  
Must I keep my corn in barn to feed and increase the breed of rats? be it so; they cannot be less thankful than those I have been used to feed.  
Are we Farmers the only people to be grudged the profits of honest labour? And why? One of the late scribblers against us gives a bill of fare of the provisions at my daughter’s wedding, and proclaims to all the world that we had the insolence to eat beef and pudding! Has he never read that precept in the good book, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn; or does he think us less worthy of good living than our oxen?  
O, but the Manufacturers! the Manufacturers! they are to be favour’d, and they must have bread at a cheap rate!  
Hark-ye, Mr. Oaf; The Farmers live splendidly, you say. And pray, would you have them hoard the money they get? Their fine cloaths and furniture, do they make them themselves, or for one another, and so keep the money among them? Or do they employ these your darling Manufacturers, and so scatter it again all over the nation?  
  
My wool would produce me a better price if it were suffer’d to go to foreign markets. But that, Messieurs the Public, your laws will not permit. It must be kept all at home, that our dear Manufacturers may have it the cheaper. And then, having yourselves thus lessened our encouragement for raising sheep, you curse us for the scarcity of mutton!  
I have heard my grandfather say, that the Farmers submitted to the prohibition on the exportation of wool, being made to expect and believe, that when the Manufacturer bought his wool cheaper, they should have their cloth cheaper. But the deuce a bit. It has been growing dearer and dearer from that day to this. How so? why truly the cloth is exported; and that keeps up the price.  
Now if it be a good principle, that the exportation of a commodity is to be restrain’d, that so our own people at home may have it the cheaper, stick to that principle, and go thorough stitch with it. Prohibit the exportation of your cloth, your leather and shoes, your iron ware, and your manufactures of all sorts, to make them all cheaper at home. And cheap enough they will be, I’ll warrant you—till people leave off making them.  
Some folks seem to think they ought never to be easy, till England becomes another Lubberland, where ’tis fancied the streets are paved with penny rolls, the houses tiled with pancakes, and chickens ready roasted cry, come eat me.  
I say, when you are sure you have got a good principle, stick to it, and carry it thorough. I hear ’tis said, that though it was necessary and right for the M——y to advise a prohibition of the exportation of corn, yet it was contrary to law; and also, that though it was contrary to law for the mob to obstruct the waggons, yet it was necessary and right. Just the same thing, to a tittle. Now they tell me, an act of indemnity ought to pass in favour of the M——y, to secure them from the consequences of having acted illegally. If so, pass another in favour of the mob. Others say, some of the mob ought to be hanged, by way of example. If so, ——but I say no more than I have said before, when you are sure that you have got a good principle, go thorough with it.  
You say, poor labourers cannot afford to buy bread at a high price, unless they had higher wages. Possibly. But how shall we Farmers be able to afford our labourers higher wages, if you will not allow us to get, when we might have it, a higher price for our corn?  
By all I can learn, we should at least have had a guinea a quarter more if the exportation had been allowed. And this money England would have got from foreigners.  
But, it seems, we Farmers must take so much less, that the poor may have it so much cheaper.  
This operates then as a tax for the maintenance of the poor. A very good thing, you will say. But I ask, Why a partial tax? Why laid on us Farmers only? If it be a good thing, pray, Messrs. the Public, take your share of it, by indemnifying us a little out of your public treasury. In doing a good thing there is both honour and pleasure; you are welcome to your part of both.  
For my own part, I am not so well satisfied of the goodness of this thing. I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. In my youth I travelled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer. There is no country in the world where so many provisions are established for them; so many hospitals to receive them when they are sick or lame, founded and maintained by voluntary charities; so many alms-houses for the aged of both sexes, together with a solemn general law made by the rich to subject their estates to a heavy tax for the support of the poor. Under all these obligations, are our poor modest, humble, and thankful; and do they use their best endeavours to maintain themselves, and lighten our shoulders of this burthen? On the contrary, I affirm that there is no country in the world in which the poor are more idle, dissolute, drunken, and insolent. The day you passed that act, you took away from before their eyes the greatest of all inducements to industry, frugality, and sobriety, by giving them a dependance on somewhat else than a careful accumulation during youth and health, for support in age or sickness. In short, you offered a premium for the encouragement of idleness, and you should not now wonder that it has had its effect in the increase of poverty. Repeal that law, and you will soon see a change in their manners. St. Monday, and St. Tuesday, will cease to be holidays. Six days shalt thou labour, though one of the old commandments long treated as out of date, will again be looked upon as a respectable precept; industry will increase, and with it plenty among the lower people; their circumstances will mend, and more will be done for their happiness by inuring them to provide for themselves, than could be done by dividing all your estates among them.  
Excuse me, Messrs. the Public, if upon this interesting subject, I put you to the trouble of reading a little of my nonsense. I am sure I have lately read a great deal of yours; and therefore from you (at least from those of you who are writers) I deserve a little indulgence. I am, your’s, &amp;c.

By your newspapers we are told, that God had sent a very  
short harvest to some other countries of Europe. I thought this  
might be in favour of Old England ; and that now we should get  
a good price for our grain, which would bring millions among  
us, and make us flow in money; that to be sure is scarce  
enough.  
  
But the wisdom of Government forbad the exportation.  
  
Well, says I, then we must be content witl: the market price  
at home.  
  
No, says my lords the Mob, you sha’n’t have that. Bring  
your corn to market if you dare ;—we’ll sell it for you for less  
money, or take it for nothing.  
  
Being thus attacked by both ends of the Constitution, the head  
and the tail of Government, what 2m | to do?  
  
Must I keep my corn in the barn to feed and increase the  
breed of rats? Be it so. ‘They cannot be less thankful than  
those I have been used to feed.  
  
Are we farmers the only people to be grudged the profits of  
honest labour? And why !—One of the late scribblers against  
us gives a bill of fare of the provisions at my daughter’s wedding,  
and proclaims to all the world that we had the insolence to eat  
beef and pudding! Has he not read that precept in the good.  
Book, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out  
the corn? Or does he think us less worthy of good living than  
our oxen ?  
  
O, but the manufacturers! the manufacturers! they are to  
be favoured ; and they must have bread at a cheap rate !  
  
Heark ye, Mr Oat.—The farmers live splendidly, you say.  
And pray, would you have them hoard the money they get?  
—Their fine clothes and furniture, do they make them them-  
selves, or for one another, and so keep the money among them ?  
Or do they employ these your darling manufacturers, and so  
scatter it again all over the nation ?  
  
My wool would produce me a better price, if it were suffered  
to go to foreign markets. But that, Messieurs the Public, your  
laws will not permit. It must be kept all at home, that our dear  
manufacturers may have it the cheaper. And then, having  
yourselves thus lessened our encouragement for raising sheep,  
you curse us for the scarcity of mutton !  
  
I have heard my grandfather say, that the farmers submitted  
to the prohibition on the exportation of wool, being made to  
expect and believe, that when the manufacturer bought his wool  
cheaper, they should have their cloth cheaper. But the deuce  
abit. It has been growing dearer and dearer from that day to

this. How so? Why, truly, the cloth is exported; and that  
keens up the price.  
  
Now, if it be a good principle that the exportation of a com-  
modity is to be restrained, that so our own people at home may  
have it the cheaper, stick to that principle, and go thorough-  
stitch with it. Prohibit the exportation of your cloth, your  
leather and shoes, your iron-ware, and your.manufactures of all  
sorts, to make them all cheaper at home. And cheap enough  
they will be, I will warrant you,—till people leave off making  
them.  
  
Some folks seem to think they ought never to be easy till  
England becomes another Lubberland, where it is fancied the  
streets are paved with penny rolls, the houses tiled with pan-  
cakes, and chickens, ready roasted, cry, ‘ Come, eat me!’  
  
I say, when you are sure you have got a good principle, stick  
to it, and carry it through. I hear it is said, that though it was  
necessary and right for the M y to advise a prohibition of the  
exportation of corn, yet it was contrary to law; and also, that  
though it was contrary to law for the mob to obstruct waggons,  
  
yet it was necessary and right. Just the same thing to a tittle.  
Now they tell me, an act of indemnity ought to pass in favour of  
the M——y, to secure them from the consequences of having  
acted illegally. If so, pass another in favour of the mob. Others  
say, some of the mob ought to be hanged, by way of example.  
If so—but I say no more than I have said before—when you are  
sure that you have got a good principle, go through with it.  
  
You say, poor labourers cannot afford to buy bread at a high  
price, unless they had higher wages:— Possibly. But how shall  
we farmers be able to afford our labourers higher wages, if you  
will not allow us to get, when we might have it, a higher price  
for our corn ?  
  
By all I can learn, we should at least have had a guinea a  
quarter more if the exportation had been allowed. And this  
money England would have got from foreigners.  
  
But, it seems, we farmers must take so much less, that the  
poor may have it so much cheaper.  
  
This operates then as a tax for the maintenance of the poor.  
A very good thing, you will say. But I ask, Why a partial tax?  
Why laid on us farmers only? If it be a good thing, pray,  
Messrs the Public, take your share of it, by indemnifying us a  
little out of your public treasury.. In doing a good thing, there  
is both honour and pleasure ;—you are welcome to your share  
of both.  
  
For my own part, I am not so well satisfied of the goodness  
of this thing. 1 am for doing good to the poor; but I differ in

opinion about the means. I think the best way of doing good  
to the poor is, not making them easy zn poverty, but leading or  
driving them ou of it. In my youth I travelled much; and I  
observed, in different countries, that the more public provisions  
were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves,  
and, of course, became poorer: And, on the contrary, the less  
was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and be-  
came richer. There is no country in the world where so many  
provisions are established for them; so many hospitals to re-  
ceive them when they are sick or lame, founded and maintained  
by voluntary charities; so many almshouses for the aged of  
both sexes; together with a solemn general law made by the  
rich to subject their estates to a heavy tax for the support of the  
  
oor. Under all these obligations, are our poor modest, hum-  
bie, and thankful; and do they use their best endeavours to  
maintain themselves, and lighten our shoulders of this bur-  
den? On the contrary, I affirm, that there is no country in  
the world in which the poor are more idle, dissolute, drunken,  
and insolent. The day you passed that act, you took away  
from before their eyes the greatest of all inducements to indus-  
try, frugality, and sobriety, by giving them a dependence on  
somewhat else than a careful accumulation during youth and  
health, for support in age or sickness.—In short, you offered a  
premium for the encouragement of idleness; and you should  
not now wonder that it has had its effect in the increase of po-  
verty. Repeal that law, and you will soon see a change in  
their manners. S¢ Monday and St Tuesday will soon cease to  
be holidays. Six days shalt thou labour, though one of the old  
commandments long treated as out of date, will again be looked  
upon es a respectable precept; industry will increase, and, with  
it, plenty among the lower people; their circumstances will  
mend ; and more will be done for their happiness, by inuring  
them to provide for themselves, than could be done by dividing  
all your estates among them.  
  
Excuse me, Messrs the Public, if, upon this znteresting sub-  
ject, | put you to the trouble of reading a little of my nonsense.  
I am sure I have lately read a great deal of yours ;—and there-  
fore from you (at least from those of you who are writers) I de-  
serve a little indulgence. Iam, yours, &amp;c.

harvest to some other countries of Europe. l thought this might  
be in favour of Old England; and that now. we should get a good  
price for our grain, which would bring millions among us, and  
make us flow in money; that to be sure is scarce enough.

But the wisdom of Government forbad the exportation.  
  
Well, says I, then we must be content with the market price at  
home.  
  
No, says my lords the Mob, you sha’n’t have that. Bring your  
corn to market if you dare;---we’ll sell it for you for less money,  
or take it for nothing.  
  
Being thus attacked by both ends of the Constitution, the head  
and tail of Government, what am I to do?  
  
Must I keep my corn in the barn to feed and increase the breed  
of rats? Be it so. They cannot be less thankful than those I  
have been used to feed.  
  
Are we farmers the only people to be grudged the profits of  
honest labour? And why!---One of the late scribblers against us  
gives a bill of fare of the provisions at my daughter’s wedding, and  
proclaims to all the world that we had the insolence to eat beef  
and pudding! Has he not read that precept in the good book,  
Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the  
corn? Or does he think us less worthy of good living than our  
oxen?  
  
O, but the manufacturers! the manufacturers! they are to be  
favoured; and they must have bread at a cheap rate!  
  
Hark ye, Mr. Oaf.---The farmers live splendidly, you say.  
And pray, would you have them hoard the money they get?---  
Their fine clothes and furniture, do they make them themselves,  
or for one another, and so keep the money among them? Or do  
they employ these your darling manufacturers, and so scatter it  
again all over the nation?  
  
My wool would produce me a better price, if it were suffered to  
go to foreign markets. But that, Messieurs the Public, your laws  
will not permit. It must be kept all at home, that our dear manu-  
facturers may have it the cheaper. And then, having yourselves  
thus lessened our encouragement for raising sheep, you curse us  
for the scarcity of mutton!  
  
I have heard my grandfather say, that the farmers submitted to  
the prohibition on the exportation of wool, being made to expect  
and believe, that when the manufacturer bought his wool cheaper,  
they should have their cloth cheaper. But the deuce a bit. It  
has been growing dearer and dearer from that day to this. How  
so? Why, truly, the cloth is exported; and that keeps up the  
  
rice.  
7 Now, if it be a good principle that the exportation of a commo-  
dity is tobe restrained, that so our own people at home may have it  
the cheaper, stick to that principle, and go thorough-stitch with  
it. Prohibit the exportation of your cloth, your leather and shoes,  
your iron-ware, ies | your manufactures of all sorts, to make them -  
  
all cheaper at home. And cheap enough they will be, I will war-  
  
rant you,---till people leave off making them.

I say, when you are sure you have got a good principle, stick  
to it, and carry it through, I hear it 1s said, that though it was  
necessary and right for the M y to advise a prohibition of the  
exportation of corn, yet it was contrary to law; and also, that  
though it was contrary to law for the mob to obstruct waggons,  
yet it was necessary and right. Just the same thing to a tittle.  
Now they tell me, an act of indemnity ought to pass in favour of  
the M , to secure them from the consequences of having act-  
ed illegally. Ifso, pass another in favour of the mob. Others  
say some of the mob ought to be hanged, by way of example. If  
so—but I say no more than I have said before—when you are  
sure that you have got a good principle, go through with it.  
  
You say, poor labourers cannot afford to buy bread at a high  
price, unless they had higher wages:—Possibly. But how shall  
we farmers be able to afford our labourers higher wages, if you  
will not allow us to get, when we might have it, a higher price for  
our corn?  
  
By all I can learn, we should at least have had a guinea a  
quarter more if the exportation had been allowed. And this mo-  
~~ England would have got from foreigners.  
  
ut, it seems, we farmers must take so much lees, that the poor  
may have it so much cheaper.  
  
This operates then as a tax for the maintenance of the poor. A  
very good thing, you will say. But I ask, Why a partial tax?  
Why laid onus farmers only? If it be a good thing, pray, Messrs  
the public, take your share of it, by indemnifying us a little out  
of your public treasury. In doing a good thing, there is both  
honour and pleasure;—you are welcome to your share of both.  
  
For my own part, [ am not so well satisfied of the goodness of  
this thing. I am for doing good to the poor; but I differ in opinion  
about the means. I think the best way of going gooa to the poor  
is, not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them  
out of it. In my youth I travelled much; and I observed, in dif-  
ferent countries, that the more public provisions were made for  
the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and, of course,  
became poorer: And, on the contrary, the less was done for them,  
the more they did for themselves, and became richer. There is  
no country in the world where so many provisions are established  
for them; so many hospitals to receive them when they are sick  
or lame, founded and maintained by voluntary charities; so many  
almshouses for the aged of both sexes, together with a solemn  
general law made by the rich to subject their estates to a heavy  
tax for the mppert of the poor. Under all these obligations, are  
our poor modest, humble, and thankful; and do they use their  
  
best endeavours to maintain themselves, and lighten our shoulders

of this burden? On the contrary, I affirm, that there is ne coun-  
try in the world in which the poor are more idle, dissolute, drunk-  
en, and insolent. The day you passed that act, you took away  
from before their eyes the greatest of «Il inducements to indus-  
try, frugality, and sobriety, by giving them a dependence on some-  
what else than a carefel accumulation during youth and health,  
for support in age or sickness.—In short, you offered a premium  
for the encouragement of idleness; and you should not now wonder  
that it has had its effect in the increase of poverty. Repeal that  
law, and you will soon see a change in their manners. St..Monda

ple; ‘heir circumstances will mend; and more will be done for  
their happiness, by inuring them to provide for themselves, than  
could be done by dividing all your estates among them.  
Excuse me, Messrs the Public, if upon this interesting subject,  
I put you to the trouble of reading a little of my nonsense. I am  
sure | have lately read a great deal of yours;—and therefore

stick to the principle and prohibit the exportation of cloth,
