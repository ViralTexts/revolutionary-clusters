Dear Sir  
Monticello Jan. 9. 16.  
  
Your favor of Dec. 21. has been recieved, and I am first to thank you for the pamphlet it covered. the same description of persons which is the subject of that is so much multiplied here too as to be almost a grievance, and, by their numbers in the public councils, have wrested from the public hand the direction of the pruning knife. but with us, as a body, they are republican, and mostly moderate in their views: so far therefore less objects of jealousy than with you.Your opinions on the events which have taken place in France are entirely just so far as these events are yet developed. but they have not reached their ultimate termination: there is still an awful void between the present and, what is to be, the last chapter of that history; and I fear it is to be filled with abominations as frightful as those which have already disgraced it. that nation is too high minded, has too much innate force, intelligence and elasticity, to remain under it’s present compression. Samson will arise in his strength, as of old, and, as of old, will burst asunder the withes, and the cords, and the webs of the Philistines. but what are to be the scenes of havoc and horror, and how widely they may spread between brethren of the same house, our ignorance of the interior feuds and antipathies of the country places beyond our ken. it will end nevertheless in a representative government, in a government in which the will of the people will be an effective ingredient. this important element has taken root in the European mind, and will have it’s growth. their despots, sensible of this, are already offering this modification of their governments, as if of their own accord. instead of the parricide treason of Bonaparte, in perverting the means confided to him as a republican magistrate, to the subversion of that republic, and erection of a military despotism for himself &amp; his family, had he used it honestly for the establishment &amp; support of a free government in his own country, France would now have been in freedom and rest, and ex her example operating in a contrary direction, every go nation in Europe would have had a government over which the will of the people would have had some controul. his atrocious egoism has checked the salutary progress of principle, and deluged it with rivers of blood, which are not yet run out. to the vast sum of devastation and of human misery, of which he has been the guilty cause, much is still to be added. but the object is fixed in the eye of nations, and they will press on to it’s accomplishment, and to the general amelioration of the condition of man.What a germ have we planted, and how faithfully should we cherish the tr parent tree at home!  
You tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependance on England for manufactures. there was a time when I might have been candidly so quoted with more candor, but within the 30. years which have since elapsed, how are circumstances changed! we were then in peace. our independant place among nations was acknoleged. a commerce which offered the raw material in exchange for the same material after receiving the last touch of industry was worthy of welcome to all nations. it was expected that those especially to whom manufacturing industry was important would cherish the friendship of such customers by every favor, by every inducement, and particularly cultivate their peace by every act of justice &amp; friendship. under this prospect the question seemed legitimate, whether, with such an immensity of unimproved land, courting the hand of husbandry, the industry of agriculture, or that of manufactures, would add most to the national wealth? and the doubt was entertained on this consideration chiefly, that to the labor of the husbandman a vast addition is made by the spontaneous energies of the earth on which it is employed. for one grain of wheat committed to the earth, she renders 20. 30. &amp; even 50. fold. whereas to the labor of the manufacturer nothing is added. pounds of flax, in his hands, yield on the contrary, but penny weights of lace.this exchange too, laborious as it might seem, what a field did it promise for the occupations of the ocean; what a nursery for that class of citizens who were to exercise and maintain our equal rights on that element. this was the state of things in 1785. when the Notes on Virginia were first printed;when, the ocean being open to all nations, and their common right in it acknoleged &amp; exercised under regulations sanctioned by the assent &amp; usage of all, it was thought that the doubt might claim some consideration. but who in 1785 could foresee the rapid depravity which was to render the close of that century the disgrace of the history of man? who could have imagined that the two most distinguished in the rank of nations, for science and civilisation, would have suddenly descended from that honorable eminence and setting at defiance all those moral laws established by the author of nature between nation and nation as between man and man, would cover earth and sea with robberies &amp; piracies, merely because strong enough to do it with temporal impunity, &amp; that under this disbandment of nations from social order, we should have been despoiled of a thousand ships, and have thousands of our citizens reduced to Algerine slavery. yet all this has taken place. one of these nations interdicted to our vessels all harbors of the globe without having first proceeded to some one of hers, there paid a tribute proportioned to the cargo, and obtained her licence to proceed to the port of destination. the other declared them to be lawful prize if they had touched at the port, or been visited by a ship of the enemy nation. thus were we completely excluded from the ocean. compare this state of things with that of 85. and say whether an opinion founded in the circumstances of that day can be fairly applied to those of the present. we have experienced what we did not then believe, that there exists both profligacy and power enough to exclude us from the field of interchange with other nations. that to be independant for the comforts of life we must fabricate them ourselves. we must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturist. the former question is suppressed; or rather assumes a new form: shall we make our own comforts, or go without them, at the will of a foreign nation? he therefore who is now against domestic manufacture must  be for reducing us either to dependance on that foreign nation, or to be clothed in skins, &amp; to live like wild beasts in dens &amp; caverns.  I am not one of these. experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independance as to our comfort: and if  those who quote me as of a different opinion will keep pace with me in purchasing nothing foreign where an equivalent of domestic fabric can be obtained, without regard to difference of price, it will not be our fault if we do not soon have a supply at home equal to our demand, and wrest that weapon of distress from the hand which has wielded it. if it shall be proposed to go beyond our own supply, the question of 85. will then recur, Will our surplus labor be then most beneficially employed in the culture of the earth, or in the fabrications of art? we have time yet for consideration, before that question will press upon us; &amp; the maxim to be applied will depend on the circumstances which shall then exist. for in so complicated a science as political economy, no one axiom can be laid down as wise and expedient for all times and circumstances, &amp; for their contraries inattention to this is what has called for this explanation, which reflection would have rendered unnecessary with the candid, while nothing will do it with those who use the former opinion only as a stalking horse to cover their disloyal propensities to keep us in eternal vassalage to a foreign &amp; unfriendly people.  
  
I salute you with assurances of great respect &amp; esteem  
Th: Jefferson

“Who could have imagined (says he) that the two  
most distinguished in the rank of nations, for science  
and civilization, would have suddenly descended  
from their honorable eminence, and setting at defi-  
ance all those moral laws established by the Author  
of Nature between nation and nation, as between  
man and man, would cover earth and sea with rob-

not then believe, that there did exist both profligacy  
and power enough to exclude the United States

MR. JEFFERSON’S ANSWER.  
  
Monticello, January 9, 816  
Dear Sir—I acknowledge with pleas-  
are your letter of the 9th Dec. last.  
  
Your opinions on the events which |  
have taken place in France, are entirely |  
just, so far as these cvenis are yet de- =  
  
veloped. But we have reason to sup-  
  
pose, that they have not yet re ached their |  
  
ultimate termination. ‘There is sull an  
awful void between the present, and  
what is to be, the dast chapter of that his-  
tory; and I fear it is to be filled with  
abominations as frightful, as those which  
  
have already disgraced it——That nauon |  
  
is too high minded, has too much innate  
force, intelligence and elasticity, to re-  
main quict under its present compression.  
Sampson will arise in his strength, and  
protably will ere long burst asunder  
the cords and webs of the Philistines.  
But what are to be the scenes of havoc  
and norror, and hew widely they may  
spread between the brethren of one fami-  
ly, our ignorance of the intericr feuds  
and antipathies of the country, places  
beyond our ken. Whatever may be the  
convulsions, we cannot but indulge the  
pleasing hope, they will end in the per-  
manent establishment of a representa-  
tive government; a government in  
which the wiil of the people will be an  
effective ingredient. This important  
element has taken root in the European  
mind, and will have its growth—Their  
  
rulers sensible of this. are already of- |  
  
fering this modification of their gove:n-  
ments, uncer the plausible pretence, that  
it is a voluntary concession on the ir  
  
part—Had Bouaparte used his legiti- |  
mate power hencstly for the establish. |  
  
ment and support of a free government,  
France would now have Deen In prosper-  
ity and rest, and her «example ope:ating  
for the bene fit of mankind ; every tation  
in Europ: weuld eveniually have fuund-  
ed a government over which the will of  
the peopie would have had a powerful  
control. His improper conduct however  
  
has«checked the salutary progress of |  
  
principle ; but the object is fixed in the  
eye of nations, and they will press to its  
  
accomplishment, asd to the general |  
  
amelioration of the condition of man.  
Whata germ have the Freemen of the  
  
United States planted, and new faithful- |  
  
ly should they cherish the parent tree at  
home. Chagrin and mortification are  
the punisiiments our enemies receive.  
  
You tell ne Iam quoted by those who  
wish to continue our dependance ov En-  
gland tor manufactures. There wasa  
time when I might have been so quoted  
witt, more candor. But within the thir-  
ty years which have since elasped, how  
arc circumstances changed? We were  
then in peace—wur independent piace  
among nations was acknowledged. A  
commerce which offered the raw mate-  
rials in exci.ange for the same material,  
after receiving the last touch ofindustry,  
was worthy the attention of all nations.  
Jt was expected, that those especially  
to whom manufacturing industry was  
important would cherish the friendship  
of such customers by every favour, and  
particularly cultivate their peace by  
crery act of juctice and friendship. Un-  
der this prospect the question scomed  
legitimate, whether with such an im-  
mensity of unimproved land, courung  
the hand of husbandry, the iudusiry of  
agriculture, or that of manufactures,  
would add most te the national wealth ?  
Avd the doubt on the utility of Ameri-  
ean manufsctures was entertained on  
this consideration chiefly, that to the  
labour of the husbandman a vast addition  
is made by the spontaneous energics of  
the earth on which it is employed. For  
one grain of wheat committed to the  
earth, she renders 20, 30, and even 5  
fold——W hnereas the labour of the manu-  
facturer tails in “most instances vastly  
beiow this profit —Pounds of flax in his  
hands, yieid but penny weights of lace—  
This exchange too, laborious as it might  
seem, what a field did it promise for the  
occupation of tke occan—what a pursery  
for that class of citizens who werc to ex-  
ercise and maintain our equal rights on  
that element? This was tie state of  
things in 1785, when the Notes on Vir-  
ginia were first published ; when the  
ocean being open to all nations, and u.cir  
common rights in it acknowledged and  
excrcised under rm gulations sanctioned  
by the assent and usage of all, it was  
thought that the doubt might claim some  
consideration. But whe in 1785, could  
foresee the rapid depravity which was to  
render the close of that century a dis-  
grace to the history of civilized society ?  
Whe could have imagined that the two  
  
most distinguished inthe rank of nations,  
  
for science and civilization, would have  
| suddenly descended from that honoura-  
| ble eminence, and setting at defiance all  
| those moral laws established by the Au-  
| thor of Nature between nation and na-  
tion, as between mai: and man, would  
cover earth and sea with robberies and  
pivacies, merely because strong enough  
to do it with temporal impunity, and  
| that under this disbandment of nations  
fiom social order, we should have been  
despoiled of a thousand ships, and have  
thousands of our citizens reduced to  
Algerine slavery ?—And all this bas tak-  
en piace. The British interdicted to our  
vessels all harbours of the globe, with-  
out having first proceeded to some of  
hers, there paid a éribute propurtioned to  
the cargo, ard obtained her licence to  
| proceed to the port of desiination. The  
French declared them to be iawtul prize  
if they had ¢ouched at the port or been  
| visited by aship of the enemy nation.  
  
‘Thus were we compictely excluded irom  
| the ocean. Compare this state of things  
with that of 785, and say whether an opm-  
jon founded in the circumstances of that  
day, can be fairly applied to those of the  
present.  
  
We have experienced what we did  
not then believe, that there cxists both  
profligacy and power enough to exclude  
us from the field of mnterchange with  
other nations—TZhat to be independeni

shall we make our own cOnorts, or gu  
without them at the wiil of a foreign

domestic manufactures, must be for ree |  
ducing us either to defrendance on that |  
natien or be clothed in skins, and to hive |  
like wiid beasts, in dens and caverns. [| |

an imme nsity of unimproved land, courting  
the hand of husbandry, the industry oj ag­

doubt on the utility of American mamif &gt;c­

Monticello, Jan. 9, 1816.  
  
Dean Str—I acknowledge with pleasure your  
letter of the 9th Dec. last.  
  
Your opinions on the events which have taken  
place in France are entirely just, so far as these  
evenis are vet developed. But we have reason te  
suppose, that they have not reached their ultimate  
termination. ‘There is still an awful void betwecnr  
the present, and what is to be, the last chapter of that  
history; and I fear it is to be filled with abomimations  
as frightful, as those which have already disgraced  
it. That nation is too high minded, has too much  
innate force, intelligence and elasticity, to remain  
quiet under its present compression. Sampson  
will arise in his strength, and probably will ere  
long burst asunder the cords and the webs of the  
Philistines, But what are to be the scenes of  
havoc and horror, and how widely they may spread  
between the bretaren of one family, our ignorance  
of the interior feuds and antipathies of the coun-  
try, piaces beyond our ken. Whatever may be  
the convulsions, we cannot but indulge the please  
ing hope they will end in the permanent establish-  
rent of a representative government; a government  
in which the will of the people wili be an effective  
ingredient. ‘This important element has taken  
root in the European mind, and will have its growth.  
Their rulers sensible of this, are already offering  
this modification of their governments, under the  
plausible pretence, that it is a voluntary concession  
on their part.—Had Bonaparte used his legitimate  
power honestly for the establishment and support  
ofa free gevernment, France would now have been  
in prosperity and rest, and her example operating  
tor the benefit of mankind, every nation in Europe  
would eventually have founded a government over  
which the wiil of the people would have had a  
powerful control. His improper conduct, however,  
nas checked the salutary progress of principle; but  
the object is fixed in the eye of nations, and they  
will press to its accomplishment, and to the general  
amelioration of the condition of man. What a

ments our enemies receive.  
  
You tellme I am quoted by those who wish ‘o  
continue our dependence on England for manufac-  
tures. There was a time when I inight have been so  
quoted with more candor. But within the thirty  
years which have since elapsed, how are circuin-  
stances changed? We were then in peace—our in-  
dependent place among nations was .cknowledged.  
A commerce which offered the raw materials in ex-  
change for the same material, after receiving the  
last touch of industry, was worthy the attention of  
all nations. It was expected, that those especially  
to whom manufacturing industry was important,  
would cherish the friendship of such customers by  
every favor, and particularly cultivate their peace  
by every act of justice and friendship. Under this  
prospect the question seemed legitimate, whether  
with such an immensity of unimproved land, court-  
ing the hand of husbandry, the industry of agricul-  
ture, or that of manufactures, would add most to  
the national wealth? And the doubt on the utility  
of American manufactures was entertained on this  
consideration chiefly, that to the labor of the hus-  
Dbandman a vast addition is made. by the spontane-  
ous energies of the carth on which it 1s employed.  
For one grain of wheat committed to the earth, she  
renders 20,30, and even 50 fold—Whereas the labor  
of the manufacturer fatls in most instances vastly  
below this profit. Pounds of flax in his hands,  
yield but penny weights of lace. This exchange too,  
laborious as it might seem, what a field did it Ppro-|  
mise for the occupation of the ocean—what a nur-  
sery for that class of citizens who were to exercise  
and maintain our equal rights on that element er  
This was the state of things in 1785, when the  
Notes on Virginia were first published; when the  
ocean being open to all nations, and their common  
tiehts on it acknowledged and exercised under re-  
culations sanctioned by the assent and usage ofall,  
it was thought that the doubt might claim some  
consideration. But who in 1785, could foresee the|  
rapid depravity which was to render the close of that  
  
side of the ugriculturalist. &quot;The former question is  
(suppressed, or rather assumes u new form. The  
igraid caquiry now is, shul/ we make our own com.  
forts, or go without them at the wili of a foreigzn na-  
tion? We, tierefore, who igs now against domestic  
manufactures, must be for reducing us either toa  
dependence on that nation, or be clothed in s&#x27;cins,  
and to live ike wild beasts in dens and caverns.—  
{ am proud to say, 1 am wor onze or THese. Ex-  
perience has taught me that manufactures, are  
now as necessary oO our mdependence xs to our  
comfori—and if those who quote me as of a differ.  
ent opinion, will keep pace with me in purchasing  
nothing foreign, where an equivalent of domestic  
fabric can be obtained, without regard to difference  
of price, it will not be our fialt if we do not have  
asupply at home equal to our demand, and wrest  
that weapon of distress from the hand which has so  
long wantonly wielded it. If it shall be proposed  
to go beyond our own supply, the question of ’85  
will then recur, viz: Will our surplus labor be Uren

planation to answer the cavils of the uncandid, who  
use my former opinion only as a stalking-horse to

Your opinions on tlie events wliicli have ta-  
ken place in France, are entirely just, so far  
as these events are yet developed. But we  
have reason to suppose, that they have not  
reached tfieir ultimate termination. There is  
still an awful void between the present and  
what is to he, the laei chapter of that history ;  
and 1 fear it It to be filled with ahommslions  
as frigiitful as those wliicli have already dis-  
graced It. That nation is too high minded,  
has too much innate force, intelligence and  
elasticity, to remain quiet under its present  
compression. Sampson w&#x27;ill arise in liis streng&#x27;h  
and probably will ere long burst asunder the  
cords and the webs of the Philistines. But  
what are to be the scenes of havoc and horror,  
and how widely they may spread between the  
brethren of one family, our ignorance of the  
interior feuds and antipathies of the country,  
places beyond our ken. Whatever may be the  
convulsions, we caznot but indulge the pleas-  
ing hope, they will end in the permanent es-  
tablisliment of a representative government j  
a government in which the will of the people  
will be an effective ingi-edient. This impor-  
tant element has taken root in the European  
mind, and will have its growth.  
  
The tillers, sensible of this, are already of-  
fering this modification of their governments,  
iimler the plausible pretence, that it is volun-  
tary concession on xheir part. Had Bonaparte  
used his legitimate power honestly for the es-  
tablishment and aui&#x27;port of a tree government,  
  
France would now have been in prosperity and  
Test, and her example, operating for the benefit  
of mankind, every nation in Europe would e-  
ventually have founded a government over  
which the will of tlie people would have had  
a powerful Control, His improper conduct,  
however, has checked the salutary progress of  
principle ; but the obiect is fixed in the eye of  
na’ions, and they will press to its accomplish-  
ment, and to the general amelioration of the  
condition of mao. What a germ have the free-  
men of the United States planted, and- how  
faithfully should they cherish the parent tree  
at home ! (Jhagrine and mortification are the  
piini.ahments ou.&quot; enemies receive.  
  
You tell me 1 am quoted by those who wish  
to continue our dependence on England for  
msniifactures. 1 here was a time when I  
might have been &#x27;-.o qu-oted wiih more candor  
But within the thirty years which have .since  
elapsed, how are cirtumstances changed ? We  
were then in peace— our independent place a  
mo&#x27;ig nations was acknowledged. A com-  
merce which ofiei r J the raw materials in ex-  
ch inge tor the same material, after receiving  
till- last touch of industry, was worthy the at-  
tention of all nations.  
  
It was expected that those especially to  
w&#x27; m manufacturing indus&#x27;ry was important,  
w mld cherish the friendship of such cust imers  
bv every favor, and particularly cultivate their  
peace by every act of justice and friendship.  
  
Under this prospect ’he question seemed le-  
gitimate, whether with such an immensity of  
unimproved land, c urling the hand of hus-  
bandry, the indxtttry of agritulturi or that of  
manu/acturei w uld add most to the national  
wealth 1 And the doubt on the utility of A-  
merican manufactures was entertained on  
this consideration chiefly that to the  
labor of the husbandman a vast addition is  
made by the spontaneous energies of the  
  
earth on which it is employed. For one grain r .i— i u _ - .

Your opinion on the events which have taken  
#lice in France are entirely just, so far as these  
erents ave yet developed. But we have no rea.  
#OOIO suppose, that they have yet reached their  
Ultimate termination. ‘Thereis siill an awful  
void between the present, and what is to be the  
I.AST ciIaPTER of that history ; and 1 fear it is  
to be filied wiih abominations as frightful, as  
those which have already disgraced it. That  
nixtion is too high minded, has too much ianate  
foree,intelligence and elasticity, to remain quiet  
uider ity present compression. . Sampson will  
rise i his swength, and will probably ere long  
buist assunder the cords and the webs of ihe  
Philistines. But what are ““o-be the scengs of  
Favoe and horror, and how widely they may  
spread beiween the brethren of one family, our  
ignorance of the interior feuds and antipathies  
of the country, places beyond @]edg&amp;_  
YWhatever may be the convulsiol¥, we cannot  
batinduige the pleasing hope, they will end in  
the permanent establishiment of arepresentative  
government ; a government in which the will of  
tie pecple will be an effective ingredient.—  
Fhis impo:tant element has taken root in the  
Frropean mind, and will have its growth.—  
Their rulers seosibie of this, are already offering  
this modification of their governments, under  
thie plausibie pretence that it is a/ voluntary con­  
eossion on their part. Had Bonaparte used his  
Lo gitimate power Lonestly for the establishment  
aad supporcof a free government, France would  
now have been in prosperity and rest, and her  
e xampie operated for the benefit of mankind,  
every nation in Burope would eventually have  
founded &amp; government over which the will of  
tue peopie would have had a powerful controul.  
His mmproper conduct however has chdcked  
the salutary progress of principle ; but the ob-  
Jeetis fixed in the eye of nations, and they will  
Jress to its accomplishment, and to the general  
amelioration of the condition of man. What a  
germ have the freemnn of the United States  
plinted, and how fuithfully should they cher­  
ishh the parent tree at home. Chagrin and  
mort.fization are the punishments our enemies  
receive.  
  
You tell me Tam quoted by those who wish  
to continue our dependance on England for  
manufactares. There was a time when I might  
liave been so quoted with more ecandour. But  
witisin the thirty years which have since elaps­  
ed, howarc circumstances changed ? We were  
then In peace—our independent place among na­  
tions was acknowledged. A commerce which  
offered the raw materials in exchange for the  
same material, after receiving the last touch-of  
industry, was worthy the attention of all na­  
tions, It was expected, that those especially  
to whom manulacturing ‘iidustry was impert­  
ant, would cherish the friendship of such cus­  
toraers by every favor, and- particularly culti-.  
vate theilr peace by every act of justice and  
Friendship. Uader this prospect the question  
scemed lepitimate, whether, with such anim­  
-laensily of unimproved land, courting the hand  
of husbandry, the industry of agriculture, or  
thui of mannfactures, would add mostte the na­  
tional weslth 2 And the deubt of the utiiity of  
American manufactufes was entertained on this  
consideration chiefly, that te the labor of the  
busbandman a vast addition is made by the  
sponianeous energies of the earth on which it is  
employed. FKFor one grain of wheat, committed  
te the earth she renders 20, 30, and even 50 fold  
—Whereas the labor of the manufacturer falls  
I most instances vastly below this profit.—  
Pounds of fax an his hands, yield but penny  
weights of lace. This exchange too, laborious  
as it might seem, what a field did it promise for  
the occupation of the ocean—what a nursery for  
  
that class of citizens who were to exercise and i  
maintain our equal rights on that element &#x27;—  
&quot;t&#x27;his Was the state of things in 17835, when the  
notes on Virgmia were fivst published jowhen  
the ocean being opén to allmations, and their  
common rights 10 it acknowledged and exepcis­  
ed under regulations sanctioned by the assent  
and usage of all, it was thought that the doubt  
might ciaim some geonsideration. But who in  
1783, could foresee the rapid depravity which  
was 1o render the ctosz ot that ceutury a dis­  
grace to the history of civilized Society 2 Who  
vould have imagined that the two most distin­  
guished in-the rank of nations, for sfence and  
civilization, would have suddenly descended  
from that honorable eminence, and setting at  
defiance all those moral laws established by  
the Author of Nature between natipn and na.  
tion, as between man and man, would cover  
earth and seawith robberies and piracics, mere­  
ly because strong enough to do it with tempo­  
ral impunity, and that under this disbandment  
of nations from special order, we shouid have  
Leen desnoiled -of a thousand ships, and have  
thiousands of our citizens reduced to Algerine  
stavery &#x27;—Auad all this bas taken place. The  
Biitish interdicted to our vessels all harbors of  
the globe, without having first proceeded to

to procecd to the portiof destination. The  
French declared them to be lawful prizesif  
they had touched at the port, or been visited  
by a ship of the enemy nation. Thus were we  
completely exciuded from the ocean. Com­  
pare this state .of things with that of &quot;85 and

Yoiir opinion on the events which have  
taken place in Prance, are entirely just, so  
far as these events are yet developed. But  
we have reason to suppose, that they haVe  
not reached their ultimate termination.—  
There is still an awful void between the  
present, and What is to he, the /-asf chapter  
of this history; and 1 fear it is to be filled  
with abominations as frightful, as those  
which have already disgraced it. That  
nation is too high minded, has too much  
innate force, intelligence and elasticity, to  
remain quiet under its present compression*  
Sampson will arise in his strength, and pro¬  
bably will ere long hurst asunder the cords  
and the webs of the Philistines. But what  
are to be the scenes of havoc and horror,  
and how widely they may spread between  
the brethren of one family, our ignorance  
of the interior feuds and antipathies of the  
country, places beyond our ken. What¬  
ever may be the convulsions, we cannot  
hut indulge the pleasing hope, they will  
ehd in the permanent establishment of a  
representative government; a government  
in which the will of the people wifi be an  
efiective ingredient. This important ele¬  
ment has taken root in the European mind,  
aiid will have its growth. Their rulers sen¬  
  
sible of this, are already offering this mo¬  
dification of their govern.nents, under the  
plausible pretence, that it is a voluntary  
concession on their part. Had Bonaparte  
used his legitimate power honestly for the  
establishment and support of a free govern-  
menr, France would now have been Jn  
prosperity and rest, and her example ope¬  
rating for the benefit of mankind, every na¬  
tion iu Europe would eventually have  
founded a government over which the will  
of the people would have had a powerful  
control. * His improper conduct, however,  
has checketl the salutary progress of prin¬  
ciple ; hilt the object is fixed in the eye of  
nations, and they will press to its accom¬  
plishment, and to the general melioration  
of the condition of mail. \i^hat a germc  
have (he Freemen of the U. Slates planted*  
and how faithfully should they cherish the  
parent tree at home! Chagrin Jaud mortifi¬  
cation are the punisbmeilt our enemies re¬  
ceive.  
  
You tell me I am quoted by those who  
wish to continue our dependence on  
England for manufactures. There was a  
time when I might have been so quoted  
with mofe candour. But within the thirty  
yeare which have since elapsed, how are  
circumstances changed ? We were then in  
peace—our independent place among na¬  
tions acknowledged. A commerce which  
offered the raw materials in exchange for  
the same material, after receiving the last  
touch of industry, was worthy the attention  
of all nations. It was expected that those  
especially to whom manufacturing industry  
was important, would cherish the friendship  
of such customers by every favour, and par¬  
ticularly cultivate their peace by every act  
of justice and ftiendship. Under this pros¬  
pect the question seemed legitimate, wheth¬  
er with such an immensity of unimproved  
land the industry of ascricuUure^ or that of  
manufactures,, would add most to the nation¬  
al wealth ? And the doubt on the utility of  
American manufactures was entertained on  
this consideration chiefly, that to the labour  
of the husbandman a vast addition is made  
by the spontaneous energies of the earth on  
which it is employed. For one grain of  
wheat committed to the earth, she renders  
20, 30, and even 50 fold—Whereas the la¬  
bour of the manufacturer falls in most in¬  
stances vastly below this profit. Pounds  
of flax in his hands, yield hut penny weights  
of lace. This exchan&lt;^e too, laliorious as i*:-  
might seem* what n field did it promise fo

occupation of the ocean—what a nurse-  
rjr for that class of citizens ho were to ex¬  
ercise and maintain our equal rights on that  
element ! This was the state of things in  
17S5, when the Notes on Virginia were  
first published ; when the ocean being open  
to all nations, and their common rights in it  
being acknowledged and exercised under  
regulations sanctioned by the assent and  
usage of all, it was thought that the doubt  
might claim some consideration. But who  
in 1785, could forsee the rapid depravity  
which was to render the close of that centu¬  
ry a disgrace to the history of civilized so¬  
ciety ? Who could have iraagined that the  
two most distinguished in the rank of na¬  
tions, for scUnce and civilizaiion^ would have  
suddenly descended from that honourable  
eminence, and setting at defiance all those  
moral laws established by the AutharofNa-  
ture between nation and nation, as between  
man and man, would cover earth and sea  
with robberies and piracies, merely because  
strong enough to do it with temporal impu¬  
nity, and that under this disbandment of  
nations from social order, we should have  
been despoiled of a thousand ships, and  
have thousands of our citizens reduced to  
Algerine slavery ? And all this has taken  
place. The British interdicted to our ves¬  
sels all harbours of the globe, without hav-  
iug first proceeded to some one of hers, there  
paid a tribute proportioned to the cargo, and  
obtained her license to proceed to the port  
of destination. The French declared them  
to he lawful prize if they had touched at the  
port. Or been vis’ted by a ship of the enemy  
nation. Thus were we completely excluded  
from the ocean. Compare this state of  
things with that of’85, and say whether an  
t&gt;pinion founded in the circumstances of that  
day, can be fairly applied to those of the  
liresent. We have experienced what we  
did not then believe that there exists both  
profligacy and fiower enough to exclude us  
from the field ofinterchange with other na¬  
tions. That to be independent for the com-  
foris of lifcy Tve mustfdhricate them ourselves.  
We must now place the manufacturer by  
the side of the Agriculturist. The former  
question is suppressed, or rather assumes a  
new form. The grand inquiry now is, shall  
we make our own comforts, or go without  
them at the will of a foreign nation ? He  
therefore who Ir notv a^Ainst domestic manu¬  
factures imst he for reducing us either to de¬  
pendence on that nation^ or be clothed in  
skins, and to live like wild beasts In dens  
  
551  
  
and caverns. 1 am proud to ^y, 1 am not  
one of these. Experience has taught me  
that manufactures are now as necessary to  
our independence as our comfort—and if  
those who quote me as of a different opinion,  
will lieep pace with me in purchasing noth¬  
ing foreign, where an equivalent of domes¬  
tic fabric can be obtained, without regard to  
difference of price, it will not be our fault if  
we do not soon have a supply at home equal  
to our demand, and wrest that weapon of  
distress from the hand which has so long  
wantonly wielded it. If it shall be propos*  
ed to go beyond our own supply, the ques¬  
tion of ’85 will then recur, viz: Will our  
suridus labour be then more beneficially em¬  
ployed in the culture of the earth, or in the-  
fabrications of art? We have lime yet for  
consideration before that question will press  
upon us; aiid the maxim to be applied will  
depend on the circumstances which shall  
then exist.—For in so complicated a science  
as political economy, no one axiom can be.  
laid down as wise and expedient for all  
times and circumstances. Inattention to  
this is what has called for this explanation  
to answer the cavils of the uncandid, who  
use my former opinion only as a stalking  
horse to keep us in eternal vassalage to a  
foreign and unfriendly nation.

be the convulsions, we cannot but indulge  
the pleasing hope, they will end in the  
permanent eitablishment of a representa-  
tive government: a government in which  
the wil! of the people will be an effective  
ingredient. This important element has  
taken root in the European mind, and  
will hav» its growth. Their ruiers, sensible  
of this, are already offering this modifi-  
cation 0: their governments, under the  
plausible pretence, that it is a voluntary  
  
‘concession on their part. Had Bonaparte  
  
used his legitimate power honestly for the  
establishment and support of a free go-  
vernment, France would now have been  
in prosperity and rest, and her example  
operating for the benefit of mankind;  
every nation in Europe would eventually  
have founded a government over which  
the will of the people would have had a  
powerful control. His improper conduct,  
however, has checked the salutary pro.  
gress of principle; but the object is fixed  
in the eye of nations, and they will press  
to its accomplishment, and to the geueral  
amelioration of the condition of man.

United States planted, and how faithfully  
should they cherish the parent tree at  
home.—Chagrine and mortification are  
the punishments our cnemies receive.  
You tell me I am quoted by those  
who wish to continue our dependance on  
England for manufactures. There was a  
time when I might have been so quoted  
with more candour. But within the thirty  
years which have since elapsed, how are  
circumstances changed! We were then  
in peace—our independent place among  
nations was acknowledged. A commerce  
which offered the raw materials in ex-  
change for the same material, after re-  
ceiving the last touch of industry, was  
worthy the attention of all nations. It  
was expected, that those especially to  
whom manufacturing industry was im-  
portant, would cherish the friendship of  
such customers by every favour, and par-  
ticularly cultivate their peace by every  
act of justice and friendship. Under  
this_ prospect the question seemed legiti-  
mate, whether, with such an immensit  
of unimproved land, courting the hand of  
husbandry, the industry of agriculture,  
or that of manufactures, would add most  
to the national wealth? And the doubt  
en the utility of American manufactures  
was entertained on this consideration

chiefly, that to the labour of the husband-  
man a vast addition is made by the spon-  
taneous energies of the earth on which it  
is employed. For one grain of wheat  
committed to the earth, she renders 20,  
30, and even 50 fold— Whereas the labour  
of the manufacturer falls in most instan-  
ces vastly below this profit. Pounds of  
flax in his hands, yield but penny-weights  
of lace.—This exchange too, laborious  
as it might seem, what a field did it pro-  
mise for the occupation of the ocean—  
what a nursery for that class of citizens  
who were to exercise and maintain our  
equal rights on that element! This was  
the state of things in 1785, when the  
Notes on Virginia were first published ;  
when the ocean being open to all nations,  
and their common rights in it acknow-  
ledged and exercised under regulations  
sanctioned by the assent and usage of all,  
it was thought that the doubt might claim  
some consideration. But who in 1785,  
could foresee the rapid depravity which  
was to render the close of that century a  
disgrace to the history of civilized society ?  
Who could have imagined that the two  
most distinguished in the rank of nations,  
for science and civilization, would have  
suddenly descended from that honourable  
eminence, and setting at defiance all those  
moral laws established by the Author of  
Nature between nation and nation, as be-  
tween man and man, would cover earth  
and sea with robberies and piracies, mere  
ly because strong enough to do it with  
temporal impunity, and that under this  
disbandment of nations from social order,  
we should have been despoiled of a thou-  
sand ships, and have thousands of our  
citizens reduced to Algerine slavery poo  
And all this has taken place. The Bri-  
tish interdicted to our vessels all harbours  
of the globe, without having first proceed-  
ed to some one of hers, there they paid 4  
tribute proportioned to the cargo, and ob-  
tained her licence to proceed to the port of  
destination. The French declared them to  
be lawful prizes if they had touched at the  
port, or been visited by a ship of the  
enemy’s nation. Thus were we completely  
excluded from the ocean. Compare this  
state of things with that of 1785, and say  
whether an opinion founded in the circum:  
stances of that day, can be fairly appli  
to those of the present. We have expe-  
rienced what we did not then believe,  
that there exists both profligacy and power

be independent for the comforts of life,  
we must fabricate them ourselves. We  
must now place the manufacturer by the  
side of the agriculturist. The former  
question is suppressed, or rather assumes

shall we make our own comforts, or go  
without them at the will of a foreign  
nation? He therefore who is now against  
domestic manufactures, must be for re  
ducing us either to dependence on that  
nation, or be clothed in skins, and to  
live like wild beasts iu dens and caverus.  
I am proud to say, I am not one of these.  
Experience has taught me that manufac-  
tures are now as necessary to our inde-  
pendence as to our comfort—and if those  
who quote me as ofa different opinion,  
will keep pace with me in purchasing  
nothing foreign, where an equivalent of  
domestic fabric can be obtained, without  
regard to difference of price, it will not  
be our fault if we do not soon havea  
supply at home equal to our demand, and  
wrest that weapon of distress from the  
hand which has so long wantonly wielded  
it. If it shall be proposed to go beyond  
our own supply, the question of 1785 will  
then recur, viz. Will our surplus Jabour  
be then more beneficially employed in  
the culture of the earth, or in the fabrica-  
tions of art? We have time yet for con-  
sideration, before that question will press  
upon us; and the maxim to be applied  
will depend on the circumstances which  
shall then exist.—For in so complicated a  
science as political economy, no one  
axiom can be laid down as wise and ex-  
pedient for all times and circumstances.  
Inattention to this is what has called for  
  
this explanation to answer the cavils of  
  
the uncandid, who use my former opinion  
only as a stalking-horse to keep us in  
eternal vassalage to a foreign and un-  
  
friendly nation.  
I salute you with assurances of great  
  
respect and esteem.

* You tell me | am quoted by those who  
wish to continue our dependence on England  
for manufactures. There was a time when I  
might have been so quoted with more can-  
dour. But within the thirty years which  
have since elapsed, how are circumstances  
changed ? We were theng@iiypeace—our in  
dependent place among nations)» It was ex-  
pected, that those especially to whom manu-  
facturing industry, wasimportant, would  
cherish the fricndship:of such customers by  
every favour, and particularly cultivate their  
peace by every act of justice and friendship.  
Under this prospect the question seemed le-  
gitimate, whether with such an immensity of  
unimproved land, courting the hand of bus-  
bandry, the industry of agriculture or that of  
manufactures, would add most to the na-  
tional wealth ? And the doubt on the utility  
of American manufactures was entertained  
on this consideration chifly, that to the Ia-  
bour of the husbandman a vast addition is  
made by the spontaneous energies of the  
earth on which it isemployed. For one grain  
of wheat committed to the earth, she renders  
20, 30, and even 50 fold.—Whereas, the la-  
bour of he manufacturer falls in most instan-  
ces vastly below this profit. Pounds of flax  
in his hands, yield but penay weights ot  
lace. This exchange, too, laborious as it  
might seem, what a field did it promise for  
the occupation of the ocean——what a nursery  
for that class of citizens who were to exer-  
cise and maintain our equal right on that el-  
ement ?——This was the state of things in 1785,  
when the Notes on Virginia were first pub-  
lished ; when the ocean being open to all na-  
tions, and their common rights on it ac-  
knowledged and exercised under regulations  
sanctioned by the assent and usages of all, it  
was thought that the doubt might claim some  
consideration. But who, in 1785, could fore-  
see the rapid depravity which was to render  
the close of that country a disgrace to the  
history of civilized society ? Who could have  
imagined that the two most distinguished ia  
the rank of nations, for sctence and civiliza-  
tion, would have suddenly descended from  
that honourable eminence, and seiting at de-  
fiance all those laws established by the Au-  
thor of Nature between nation and nation,  
as between man and man, wonld cover earth  
and sea with robberies and piracies, merely  
because strong enough to do it with tempo-  
ral impunity ; and that under this disband-  
ment of nations from social order, we should  
have been despoiled of a thousand ships, and  
have thousands of our citizens reduced to Al-  
gerine slavery? And all this has taken place.  
The British interdicted to our vessels all har-  
bours of the globe, without having first pro-  
ceeded to some one of theirs, there paid a  
tribute proportioned to the cargo, and ob-  
tained a license to proceed to the port of des-  
tination. The French declared them to be  
  
  
  
lawful prize if they had touched at a port,  
  
ey  
  
the price of fine hay,

nation. Compare this state of things with  
that of °85, and say whether an opinion  
founded in the circumstances of that day,  
can be fairly applied to those of the present.  
We-bave experienced what we did not then  
believe, that there exists both profligacy and  
power enough to exclude us from the field of  
interchange with other nations ; that to be in-  
dependent for the comforts of life, we must fab-  
vicate them ourselves. We must now place the  
manufacturer by the side of the agricultu-  
ralist. The former question is suppressed,  
or rather assumes a new form. The grand  
inquiry now is, shall we make our own corm-  
forts, or go without them at the will of a for-  
eign nation ? fe, therefore, who is now against  
domestic manufactures, must be for reducing  
us either to a dependence on that nation, or to  
be clothed in skins and to live like wild  
beasts, in dens and caverns.—lI am proud to  
say, | am Nor onR of THESE. Experience  
bas taught me that manufactures are now as  
necessary to our independence as to our com-  
fort—aud if those who quote me as of a dif-  
ferent opinion, will keep pace with me in  
purchasing nothing foreign, where an equiv-  
alent of domestic fabric can be obtained,  
without regard to difference of price, it will  
not be our fault if we do not have a supply at  
home equal to our demand, ard wrest that  
weapon of distress from the hand which has  
so long wantonly wielded it. If it shalt be  
proposed to go beyond our own supply, the  
question of ’85 will then reeur, viz : Will our  
surplus labour be (ben more beneficially em-  
ployed in the culture of the earth, or in the  
fabrications of art? We have time yet for  
‘consideration, before that question will press  
upon us; and the maxim to be applied will  
depend on the circumstances which shall  
then exist. For in so complicated a scieuce  
as political economy, no one maxim can be  
laid down as wise and expedient for all  
times and circumstances. Inattention to this  
is what is called for this explanation, to an-  
swer the cavils of the uncandid, who use my  
former only as a stalking-horse to keep us in  
eternal vassalage to a foreign und unfriendly  
nation.”

indepcmleiU for (he comforts of life, tee must fabri­  
rutc them ourselves.” We must now place the Ma­  
nufacturer by the side of the .lgricidluralist. The  
grand enquiry now is, seall we make our own com­  
forts or go without them at the will of a foreign na­  
tion?—tie, therefore, who is now against domestic  
manufactures, must be for reducing us either to a  
dcp tidance on that nation, or to be clothed in skins  
and to live like wild beasts in Dens and Caverns.  
1 am proud to say, 1 am not one of these. Ex­  
perience lias taught nic that manufactures are now  
as necessary to our independence as to our comfort,  
and if those who quote me as of a diderent opinion,  
will keep pace with me in purchasing nothing foreign,  
where an eqi&#x27;vnlcnt of domestic fabric can be ob­  
tained, without regard to difference of price, it will  
not be our fault if we do not have a supply at home

*i ou tell me • am quoted by those who wish to con­  
tinue our dependence on England for manufactures._  
There- was a time when 1 might have been so quoted  
with more candor. But within the thirty years which  
have since elapsed, how are circumstances changed?  
Wo were then in peace—our independent place aumn^  
r. i.tions waa acknowledged. A commerce which o/fer­  
cti t;.e raw materials in exchange fur the same materi­  
al, after receiving the last touch of industry, was wor- I  
l.ij the attention of all nations. It was expected, that;  
those especially to r.bom manufacturing industry was  
important, would cherish the friendship of such cus  
tumors by every favour, and particularly cultivate their  
peace by every act of justice and friendship. L&#x27;nder  
this prospect the question seemed legitimate, whether  
with such an immensity of unimproved land, courting  
the hand of husbandry, the intfustry &lt;f (ti^ricnltuc or  
tiial of m.nwftirUirr.*, would add most to t?,e national  
wealth? And the doubt on tho utility of American  
manufactures was entertained on this consideration&#x27;  
chiefly, that to the labor ot the husbandman a vast  
addition is made by the spontaneous energies of the  
oajlh ou which it is employed. For one grate of wheat  
committed to the earth, she renders 20, JO, and even  
hO fold: whereas the labor of the manufacturer fails  
inmost instances vastly below this profit. Pounds of  
flax in his hands, yield but penny weights of lace.  
This exchange too, laborious as it might serin, what  
a field did it promise for the occupation of the ocean_  
w hat a nursery fur that class of citizens who were to ex­  
orcise and maintain our equal lights oij that element?  
This was the state of things in 1 when the .Notes  
on Virginia were fust published; ivi.cn the ocean beino­  
open to all nations, anil tboir common rights on it ac°  
linowlodged and exercised under regulations sanc tion­  
e-.i by the assent and mage of all, it was thought that  
tii3 (iuiibl might claim some consideration. But who  
»u n.&#x27;i&quot;., could foresee (he rapid depravity which was1  
to render the close of that century a disgrace to the;  
history of civilized society? Who could have irn i  
gir.ed that the two most distinguished in (he rank of  
nations, for science and civilizuti&gt;m, would have suddenly j  
ciebcendpd Horn that liormiable eminence, and, settiri”  
a dfcjrince all those laws established bj the Anther of  
nature betwe -n nation aud nation, as bouvem man  
and man, would cover earth and sea with tobbe.ies  
aT.1 piracies, merely because strong enough to do it  
mUi (extpoial impunity; and that under this disband I  
muni of nations tro.n social order, we should have been :  
despoiled of a thousand -hips, and have thousands ofour &#x27;  
cilizens reduced to A&#x27;gcrine slaverx? And all this!  
Las taken place. ThctBntish interdicted to our vessels i  
:.ii harbors of the globe; without havin-r first proceeded  
1.. some one of hers there paid a tribute proportioned &#x27;  
to tlui cargo, a:u, obtained a license to proceed to the  
part of destination The French declared then to be  
pii/o if ihuy^h-d touched at the port, or been {  
visited by a ship of the enernj’s nation. Thus were  
completely excluded from the ocean. Compare  
this Slate of (lungs -with (hat of’ ,j, and say whether an  
  
oi‘&quot;&quot;un imioueu in «ne circumstances of that day, cau  
he fairly applied to those of the present.

thus rise higher and higher in the scale |  
of independent nations, OLD 76,  
JAnswer of Thomas Jefferson to Bewj. Justin,  
MoxTtic eLro, Jan, 9, 18206,  
You tell me I am quoted by those who  
wish to continue our dependence on En­  
gland for manufactures, There was a  
time when I unght have been so quoted  
with more eandor. But, within the thirty |  
years which have since elapsed, how are |  
circumstances changed 7 We were then |  
in peace—onr independent place among |  
pations was acknowledged. A commerce  
which offered the raw materials in ex- &#x27;  
change for the swine wmaterials, after re­  
cewing the last touch of industry, was wor­  
thy the attention of all nations. It was ex­  
peeted, that those especially to whom man­  
ufacturing ndustry was unportant, would  
cherish the friendship of such customers  
by every favor, and particularly cultivate  
their peace by every act of justice nnd&#x27;  
friendship. Under this prospect, the qaes  
tion seemed legitimate, which such an un  
mensity of unnnproved land, courting the  
hand of husbandry, the industry of JAgri  
culture, or that nl‘nuumﬁu-lurm, would add ’  
most to the national wealth ? And the doubt !  
on the utility of American manufactures  
way entertnined on this conideration, chief  
ly, that to the labor of the hushandman a  
vastnddition 19 made by the spontaneous  
cuergies of the earth on which it 19 em  
ployed, For one grain of wheat comnmit  
ted tothe earth, she renders 20, 30, and  
even H 0 fold : whereas the labor of the man  
ufucturer falls in gome istances vastly be  
Yow this profit. Pounds of flax yu his hands,  
yields but pennyweights ol lace, “T&#x27;his ex  
change too, laborious as it might seem  
what a field did it promise tor the oceupn  
tion of the ocean—what a nursery for tha  
cluss of citizens who were to exercise and  
waintain our equal rights on that element ¢  
T&#x27;his was the state of things in 1785, when  
the notes on Virgima were ficst published,  
when the ocean being open to all nations,  
and theircommon rights on it acknowledg  
ed and exercisod under regulations sane |  
tioned by the assent and usage of all, it wnw‘  
thought that the doubt might claim some  
coustderation. Buot who, in 1785, (&#x27;uulcl’  
oresee the rupid depravity which was to  
render the elose of that century a disgrace |  
to the history of civilized society ? \thl  
could have unagined that the twomost dis |  
tingmshed in the rank of nations, for sci  
ence and civilization, would have sud |  
denly descended from that honorable emi- :  
nence, and setting at defiance all those |  
laws established by the Author of natar |  
between nation and nation, as between man |  
and man, would cover earth and sca wnthg  
robberies and piracies, wmerely because |  
strong enough to do it with temporal im I  
punity, and that under this disbandment  
of nations from social order, we should have  
been despoiled of a thousand ships, and  
have thousands of our citizens reduced to  
Alrerine slavery 7 And all this has taken  
place. Tae British interdicted to our ves !  
sels all harbors of the globe, without hay  
ing first proceeded to some one of hers,  
there pad o tribute proportioned to the cdr- l |  
go. and obtained a hiecense toproceed to the |  
port of destination. The French declared |  
them %o be the lawful prize if they had |  
touched at the port, or be visited by a ship |  
ofthe enemy’s nation. Thus were we com t |  
pletely excladed from the ocean. Compare | .  
this state of things withthat of 85, and say, |  
whether opinion founded in the eirenme­  
stances ol that day, can be fairly applied to |  
those of the present, |  
We have experienced what we did not |  
then believe, that there exists both proth. ‘ |  
gney and power enough to exclude us from |  
the field of interchange with other nulions;!  
that to be imlrlmulrnl Jor the comforts of  
lire, we must fabricale them ourselves. We  
must now place the Manwfacturer by the&#x27;

“Yon tell me I am quoted by those who wish  
to continue our dependence on England for man­  
ufactures. There was atime when 1 might have  
‘been-so quoted with more candor. But within  
  
the thirty years which hava since elapsed, how  
are circumstances changed! We were then in  
peace; our independent place among nations  
was ackowledged. A commerce which offered  
*he raw material, in exchange for the saime mate­  
rial, afler receiving the last touch es iudustry,  
was worthy of welcome to all nations. It was  
expected, that those especially to whom manu­  
facturing indus!ry was important, would cherish  
the friendship ot such customers by every favor,  
and particularly enltivate their peace by every  
act of justice and friendship. Under this pros.:  
peet, the gquestion seemed legitimate, whether,  
with sweb an immensity of unimprovod land,  
courting the hand of liusbandry, the indwstry of  
agriculture, or that of manufactures, would add  
most to the national wealth. And the deubt on  
the utility of the American manufictures wasen­  
tertained on this consideration, ehiefly, that to  
the lubor of the husbandman a vast addition is  
made by the spontaneous energies of the earth on  
which it is employed. Fer one giain of wheat  
committed to the earth, she renders tweaty, thir­  
ty, and even fifty fold; whereas to the labur of  
the manufucturer nothing is added. Pounds of  
flax, in his Hands, on the contrary, yield but pen­  
ny weights of laee. This exchange, too, laberi­  
ous as 1t might seen, what a field did it promise  
for the occupation of the ocean; what a nursery  
for that elass of citizens who were to exercise and  
maintain our equal rights on that element! This  
was the s&#x27;ate of thingsin 1735, when the Noteson  
Virginia were first published; when, the oeean  
being apen to all nations, and their eoimnon right  
in it acknowledged and exercised under regula­  
tions sanctioned by the assent and usage of all, it  
was thought tiat the doubt might claim sonre  
consideration.”  
  
“But whn,” he continues, 1735, could  
{Oresee the rapid depravity which was to ren­  
der the elose of that eentury a disgrace to the  
history of man :_:L He tien adverts to-th

ters to a (riend, Mr. Jefferson remarks:  
&quot;You tell me 1 am quoted by those  
who wish to continue our dependence  
on England for manufactures. There  
was a time when i might have been so  
quoted with more candor. But with­  
in the thirty years which have since  
elapsed, how are circumstances chan­  
gedf We were then In peace; our in­  
dependent place among nations was  
acknowledged. A commerce which  
offered the raw materia!, after receiving  
the last touch of industry, was worthy  
of welcome to all nations. It was ex­  
pected that those especially to whom  
manufacturing industry was important,  
would cherish the friendship of such  
customers by every favor, and particu­  
larly cultivate their peace by every  
act of justice and friendship. Under  
this prospect the question seemed le­  
gitimate, whether, with such an immen­  
sity of unimproved land courting the  
hand of husbandry, the industry of ag  
riculture or that of manufactures would  
add most to the national wealth  
&quot;Thus was the state of things in  
1785, when the notes on Virginia were  
first published; when the ocean being  
open to all nations, and t!i eir common  
right in it acknowledged and exercised  
under regulations sanctioned by the  
assent and usage of all, it was thought  
that the doubt might claim some con­  
sideration. We have since experien­  
ced whet we did not then believe,  
that there exists both profligacy and  
power enough to exclude us Irom the  
field of interchange with other nations  
-THAT TO BE INDEPENDENT FOR THE  
COMFORTS OF LIFE WE MUST FABRI­  
CATE them ourselves. We must  
novT place the manufacturer by the side  
of the agncu&#x27;.&#x27;furist. The former ques­  
tion is suppressed, Of rather assumes a  
new form the grand enquiry now is,  
shall we make our own comforts, or go  
without them at the will of a foreign  
nation? He, therefore, w ho is now  
against domestic manufacture, must  
be for reducing us either to depen­  
dence on that foreign nation, or to be  
clothed in skins, and to live like wild

I impress it upon him if he be an agriculturist, that  
the reduced price of the chisel in this case, is taken

LETTER OF JEFFERSON TO  
BENJAMIN AUSTIN.  
MonlicelotJan. &#x27;9,1810.  
Dear Sir,  
I acknowledge with pleasure your Id­  
ler of the 9th of December last.  
Your opinions on the events which have  
taken place in France, are entirely jist,  
so far as these events are yet developed.  
But we have reason to suppose, that they  
have not reached their ultimate termina­  
tion. There is still an awlul void be  
tween the present, and what is to be the  
last chapter ol that history; and I fear it  
is to be filled . wi&#x27;.li abominations, as  
frightful as those w hich have already dis­  
graced it That nation is toohigh-minded,  
has too much innate force,intelligence  
and elasticity, to remain quiet under its  
present compression. Samson will arise  
in his strength, and probably will ere  
long burst asunder the cords and tha webs  
of the Philistines. But what are to be  
the scenes of havoc and horror, and Low  
widely they may spread between the  
brethren of one family, our ignorance of  
the interior feuds and antipathies of the  
country places beyond our view What­  
ever may be the convulsions, we csfnno!  
but indulge the pleasing hope, they will  
end in the permanent establishment of a  
representative government; a govern  
ment in which the will of the people will  
be an effective ingredient. This unpor.  
tant element has taken root in the Euro  
pean mind, and will have its growth.  
1 heir ru&#x27;ers, sensible of this, are already  
offering this modification of their govern-  
Tnents, under the plausible pretence that  
it is a voluntary concession en their part.  
Had Bonaparte used his legitimate power  
honestly, for the establishment and sup  
port of a free government, Franco would  
now have been in prosperity end rest,  
and her example opcating for the benfit  
of mankind,every nation in Europe would  
eventually have founded a government  
over which the will of the people would  
have had a powerful control. His im  
proper conduct, however, has checked  
the salutary progress of principlo; but  
the object is fixed in the eye of nations,  
and tiiey will press to its accomplishment  
and to the general amelioration of the  
condition cf man. What a germ have  
the freemen of the United States planted,  
and how faithfully should they cherish

emies receive.&quot; :  
You tell raa I am quoted by thoss who  
wish to continue our tiepenpence on Egr  
laiid for manufactures. ; &#x27;J&#x27;nere was a  
time when I inibt have been so q ioled

i!.e quest. oi seemed legitimate, &quot;whether.  
w:tb such un isnmonstty ol uninriproved  
land, courting the hand of husbandry, the  
industry of agriculture,, or that of maim­  
facturts, would add most to the iiaiioual  
wealth. , And the doubt on the of  
the American manufactures wan enter­  
tained on this consideration, chit-fly, that  
to the labor of the husbjiimjn a vast a i ii­  
t:on i3 made by ihe spontaneous energies

Fcr one grain ol wheat committed to the  
eaith, she renders twenty .thirty, and.eveii

manuficmrtr i x-thi&#x27;igis added. Pounds  
of flar, i-i liia h itid-&quot;, on the cor.trary,yieM  
but penny weight ot lace. This exchange  
too, laborious us it might seem, what a  
field d:d it promise fr the occupation of  
the ocean ; what a pursery for that class  
of citizens who wire to exercise end  
maintain our eqo.-i! ngh&#x27;.s on th;t element.  
This was the stat of ihings in l7S5,when  
tho Note on Viri.&#x27;.iu were first publish­  
ed ; when the ocesuj t.eig open to all na­  
tion?, and their co:nmon right in it ock-  
nowledgcd and ex-rcised under regula­  
tions sanctioned by the assent and usage  
of all, it was thought that the doubt wight  
claim soma consideration.  
But who, i i 1775, could foresee the  
rapid depravity which was to render the  
Ctcse -cr-tkj cen!u?v. a . disgrace to  
&quot;ined that tne two most distinguished i  
the rank of nations, for science Rud civi­  
lization, would have suddenly descended  
from that honorable eminence, and set  
ting at defiance all those moral lawa es­  
tablished by the Author of Nature be  
tween nation audna&#x27;icn, as between man  
and man, would cover tha earth and sea  
with robberies and piroces, meriiy be­  
cause strong enough to do it with tempo­  
ral impti.iily, and that under this djshan­  
dmeiit of nations from social order, we  
should have been despoiled cf a th iuaand  
ships, and have thousands of our cktzens  
reductd to Algerine shvery. Yet all  
th&#x27;s has take i place. The British inter,  
dieted to our vessels all harbors of the  
globe, without having first proceeded to  
some of hers, there paid a tribute propor  
tioned to the cargo, and obtained her li­  
cense to proceed to the port of destination.  
The French declared them to be the law­  
ful pjiza if they had touched -at the port,  
or been visited by a ship of the enemy  
nation. Thus were we completely ex­  
cluded from tho ocean. Compara this  
state of thing with that of &#x27;85, and say  
whether any opinion founded in the cir.  
cumstances of t hat day, can be fiirly ap­  
plied to those of ihe present. Vve have  
experienced, what we did not. then ba­  
lieve, that there exists both profligacy  
and power .enough to exclude us from  
the field of interchange with .other na  
tions. TJiat to be independent for the com  
forts of life, tee must fabricate them our  
selves. H c must now place the manufac­  
turer by the side cf the agriculturist., The  
former question is suppressed, or rather  
assumes a new form. . The grand inqui­  
ry dow is, Shall we make our own com  
forts, or go without them at the will of a  
foreign nation? He, therefore, who is  
now against domestic manufacture, must  
be for reducing us either to dependence  
on that foreign nation, or to be clothed  
in skins, and to live like wild beasts in  
dens and caverns. 1 am not one of these.

be our fault if we oo not soon have a sup­  
ply at home equal to our demind, and  
wrest that weapon of distress from the

ed it. If it shall be proposed to go be­

&#x27; &#x27;ïou tell me I am quoted by those who wish  
tocMntinue our dépendance on England for man­  
ufactures. There was a time when I might  
have been so quoted with more candor. Rut  
within the thirty years which have since elapsed,  
how are circumstances changed? We were  
Ilten in peace ; our independent place among na­  
tions was acknowledged. A commerce which of­  
fered tho raw material in exchange for the same  
material, aller receiving the last touch of Indus,  
try, was worthy of welcome to all nations. It  
was expected that those especially to whom ma.  
iiufacturing industry was important would cher­  
ish the friendship of such customers, by every  
favor, and particularly cultivate their peace by  
ovory act of justice and friendship. Under this  
prospect the question seemed legitimate, wheth­  
er, with such an immensity of unimproved land,  
courting the hand of husbandry , the industry of  
agriculture, or that of manufactures, would udd  
most to tho nationul wealth,&quot; * *  
&quot;This was the state of things in 1785, when  
tho notes on Virginia Were first published ; when  
the ocean being ojien to all nations, and their  
common right in it acknowledged and exercised  
under regulations, sanctioned by the assent and  
usage of all, it was thought that the doubt might  
claim some consideration. We have since ex­  
perienced what we did not then believe, that  
there exists both profligacy and power enough  
to exclude us from the field of interchange with  
other nations— That to hu Indei&#x27;emikkt »-ou

have imagined that we should have been despoiled of  
a thousand ships, and have thousands of our citizens re­  
duced to Algerine slavery! Yet all this has taken  
place. The British interdicted to our vessels all har  
bors of the globe, without having first proceeded to some  
of hers, there paid a tribute proportioned to the cargo,  
and obtained her licence to proceed to the port of des­  
tination. The French declared them to be law ful  
prizes, if they had touched at the port, or been visited by  
the ship ofthe enemy nation. Thus, were we complete  
ly excluded from the ocean.  
Cumpare this state of things with that of &#x27;36, (when  
he wrote his Notes on Virginia,) and say whether an o  
pinion founded in the circumstances of that day can be  
fairly applied to those of the present. &quot;We have expe

the field of interchange with foreign nations; that to be  
independent for the comforts of life, we must manufac  
  
ture them ourselves. We must then place the mnanu  
facturer by the side of the agriculturalist. The former  
question is suppressed, or rather assumes a new form.  
The grand inquiry now is, shall we make our own com  
forts, or go without them, at the will of a foreign na

manufactures, must be for redueing us either to depen­  
dence on that foreign nation, or to be clothed in skins,

not one of these. Experience has taught us that manu  
factures are now as necessary to our independence as to  
our comfort, and if those who quole me as of a different  
opinion, will keep pace with me in purchasing nothing  
foreign, without regard to differencecin price, it will not  
be our fault if we do not soon have a supply at home  
equal to our demand, and wrest that weapon of distress  
from the hand which has so long wantonly wielded it. If  
it shall be proposed to go beyond our supply, the ques­

more profitably employed in the eulture of the earth, or

ard to dilerence of price, scoures is apainst a  
relapse into foreign depenench  
Jefferson was thus an advocate not merely  
of political, but of industrial, independence  
of all foreign powers. He would not only  
employ protective duties and prohibitions of  
foreign articles in consummating that grand  
end, but he would stimulate every good  
citizen to a determination to use no foreign  
article which we could manufacture ourselves  
and that &quot;without regard to difference of  
price  
In a letter to Benj. Austin, esd dated Jan  
20, 1816, Mr. Jefferson says  
You tell me I am quoted by those who wish to  
continue our dependence on England for manu­  
factures. There was a time when I might have  
been so quoted with more candor, but within the  
thirty years which have since clapsed, how  
are circumstances changed!  
From Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Notes on Virginia&quot; an  
  
extract was frequently quoted about this  
time in proof that he favored free trade  
  
These &quot;Notes,&quot; containing this extract, were  
printed originally in 1785, before the adop  
tion of our present national constitution  
Under the confederation in 1785 no power  
existed in the Government to levy imposts for  
protection, and our industries, in consequence  
were in a very depressed condition. Mr  
Jefferson, in this letter to Austin, describes  
the situation, its difficulties and doubts, and  
  
states that the practical question then was  
whether with such an immensity of unim  
  
proved land, counting the land of the hus­  
bandman, the industry of agriculture or that  
of manufactures would add most to the na­  
tional wealth?&quot; He asks, &quot;Who in, 1785  
could foresee the rapid depravity which was to  
render the close of that century the disgrace  
of the history of man?&quot;--who the iniquitou

Jeffersonian.  
Thomas Jefferson, the father of  
simon pure Democracy, was a man  
who appreciated to the fullest the  
importance of national prosperity,  
and that as a nation we could not  
hope to prosper unless we developed  
the resources of our own country  
and become&#x27;producers.  
In a letter written in 1810 he  
used the folic wing language:  
“Experience has taught me that  
manufactures are now as necessary  
to our independence as to our com­  
„fort, and if those who quote me as  
of a different opinion will keep pace  
with me in purchasing nothing for­

fabric can be obtained without re­  
gard to difference of price, it will  
not be our fault if we do not have  
a supply at home equal to our de­  
mands and wrest that weapon of  
distress from the hand which has so  
long wantonly used it.&#x27;”

the doctrine enunciated by the  
statesmen from the south who tavor

unrestricted opening up of Ameri­  
can markets to European manufact­  
urers employing pauper labor with
