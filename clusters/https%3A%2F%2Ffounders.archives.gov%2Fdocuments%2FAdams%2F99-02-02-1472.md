o hear us.—We acknowledged the treaty of Fort Stanwix, twenty five years ago and that the Ohio river then agreed upon as the boundary, between their lands, and the lands of the White people. We then observed, that about seven years after, a quarrel broke out between the King of Great Britain, and the people of those colonies, which are now the United States. That by the treaty of peace, made with the King, about ten years since, the great lakes and the waters which unite them, were by him declared to be the boundaries of the United States.—That after peace was made with the King, it remained to make peace with the those nations, who had taken part in the war with th

hat the next treaty was made, about ninety days after, at Fort McIntosh with the half king of the Wyandots, Last Pipe and other chiefs in behalf of the Wyandots, Delawares, Ottowas, and Chippawa nations.—Afterwards treaties were made with diverse Indian nations south of the Ohio River, and that one was made with the Kahaipilathy here present, and other Shawanese chiefs, in behalf of the Shawanoe Nation at the mouth of the great Miami, which runs into the Ohio. The Commissioners further observed those treaties, made in behalf of the United States, were sent to the great council of the States, who supposing them satisfactory, to the situation treated with proceeded to dispose of large tracts of the the land they ceeded, and a great number of inhabitants from the United States, have settled among them, as well as many families of their ancient fathers, the French have come over the great waters, and have settled on parts of the same lands.—That after some time, it appeared, that a number of people in their nations were

t for the Chiefs of their nations. These propositions we considered as concessions on the part of the United States: but we did not stop here we formerly gave up a claim to their whole country south of the Great Lakes, as the property of the United States; in consequence of the treaty of peace with Great Britain; By telling them, the Indians, that we thought that an erroneous construction had been put on that part of our treaty with the King of Great Britain; as he had not purchased that country of them, consequently he could not give it away. That he only relinquished to the United States his claim to it—That claim was founded on a right acquired by treaty with other white nations, to exclude them from purchasing or selling in any part of their country; That this was the right which the King granted to the United States.—That before such a surrender, the king alone had a right to purchase of the Indian nations, any of their lands between the Great Lakes, the Ohio, and the Mississippi, excepting the part within the charter bounds of Pennsylvania. That the King, by the treaty of peace, having granted this right to the United States, they alone now have the right of purchasing, so that now neither the King, or any of his people, have any right to interfere in any respect to any part of these lands and that all their brothers the English knew this to be true: And it agrees with the declaration of Lord Dorchester at Quebec two years since—He tells the Indians when speaking on the subject of lands that the King granted no more than that &quot;he would not extend his interference&quot; beyound the line pointed out—That the Kings right to their &quot;territory were against the nations of Europe, those were resigned to the states&quot;—The Commissioners farther assured the Indians, that by express authority of the President of the Untied States, they acknowledged to them, that the property or right of soil of the great country above discribed to be in them, so long as they desired to occupy the same—That the United States only claimed particular tracts in it, as before mentioned, they admitted that the general rights granted by the King, as above stated and which is well known to the English and Americans, and called the right of preemption, or the right of purchasing of the Indians nations disposed to sell their lands, to the exclusion of all other white people what ever.—We concluded our answer by urging that they would soon conduct us to the place of treaty, for that with more care all difficulties, should any arise, might be removed.  
August 1st. In Council as last evening One of the Wyandot Chiefs arose and assured that they were all brothers whom we saw. That it had been three years since we desired to speak with them—that they heard us yesterday and understood perfectly well what was said—That they had a few words to say respecting the treaties of Fort Stanwix, Beaver Creek &amp; other places, which treaties were incompleat as there were but few Chiefs who attended them—that we had not bought their lands, that they yet owned them—that we have tried to draw off some of them.

Brothers. Money to us is of no value &amp; to most of us unknown and as no consideration whatever can induce us to sell our lands on which we get sustenance for our women and children we hope as may be allowed to point out a mode by which your settlers may be easily removed and peace thereby obtained.—Brothers, we know that these settlers are poor or they never would have ventured to live in a country which has been in continual trouble ever since they crossed the Ohio—Divide therefore this large sum of money which you have offered to us, among those people, give to each also a proportion of what you say you would give us annually over and above this very large sum of money and we are persuaded they would most readily accept of it in lieu of the Lands you sold them: if you add also the great sums you must expend in raising and paying armies with a view to force us to yield our own country, you will certainly have more than sufficient for the purpose of repaying those settlers for all their Labour and improvements.  
Brothers you have talked to us about concessions. It appears strange that you should expect any from us who have only been defending our just rights against your invasions—We want peace—Restore to us our own country and we shall be enemies no longer. Brothers you will make one concession to us, by offering us your money and an other by having agreed to do us justice, after having long and injuriously withheld it—We mean in the acknowledgement you have now made that the King of England never did nor ever had a right to give you our country by the treaty of peace—And you want to make this act of common justice a great part of your concession and seem to expect that because you have at last acknowledged our independence we should for such a favour surrender to you our country—  
Brothers you have also talked a great deal about preemption and your exclusive right to purchase the Indian Lands, as ceded to you by the King at the treaty of peace—  
Brothers we never made any agreement with the King, nor with any other nation, that we would give to either the exclusive right to purchase our lands, and we declare to you that we consider our selves free to make any bargain or cession of lands whenever &amp; to whomsoever we please. If the white people as you say made a treaty that none of them but the king should purchase of us land, that he has given that right to the United States, it is an affair which concerns you and him and not us: We have never parted with such a power. Brothers at our general council held at the Glaise last fall we agreed to meet Commissioners from the United States for the purpose of restoring peace, provided they consented to acknowledge and confirm our boundary line to be the Ohio: And we determined not to meet you untill you gave us satisfaction on that point, that in the reason we have never met.—We desire you to consider Brothers. That our only demand, is the peaceable possession of a small part of our one great country. Look back and view the lands from whence we have been driven to this point—we can retreat no farther because the Country behind hardly affords good for its present inhabitants, and we have therefore resolved to leave our bones in this small space, to which we are now consigned.—

a grand council of all the nations concerned in the question, they  
remarked the impracticability of breaking up the settlements on  
the disputed territory, and offered a large sum of money for a con-

shrewd ; part of it ran thus. “ BrotrHers—Monrney to us is of no

had ventured to live in a country which had  
been in constant trouble since they crossed the  
Ohio, they proposed to divide the large sum of  
money which had been offered to the Indians,  
among them; and also to give each a portion of  
the promised annuity, which they believed the  
settlers would readily accept, in lieu of the  
land They said further, that if in addition to  
this, the United States would give to those set-  
tlers, the great sums which must be expended  
in raising and paying armies, to drive the In-  
dians from their country, they would certainly  
have more than sufficient to repav them for all  
their labor and improvements. They said fur-  
ther, that the Commissioners had talked about  
concessions, but it appeared strange they should  
expect any from the Indians, who had been only  
defending their just rights against invasion. —  
_* We want peace,’ said they, ‘ restore to us our  
country, and we shall be enemies no longer.’  
  
** You make one concession, by offering us  
money, and another, by agreeing to do us jus-  
tice, after having long and injuriously withheld  
it  
  
, ‘*We maintain that the King of England  
| never did, and that he never had a right to give  
you our country, by the treaty of peace. Be-  
cause you have at last acknowledged our inde-  
pendence, you want to make that act of common  
‘justice, a ground for surrendering to you our  
country. You have talked also a great deal  
about pre-emption, and your exclusive right to  
purchase our lands, ceded to you, as you say,  
by the king, at the treaty of peace. We never  
made any agreement with the king to that effect,  
and we declare ourselves free to make any bar-  
gain or cession of lands whenever, and to whom-  
svever We please.” They said further, that at  
their general council at the Glaise, last fall, they  
agreed to meet Commissioners from the United  
| States, provided they consented to acknowledge  
and confirm the Ohio to be the boundary line,  
jandon no other condition. They affirmed, that  
their only demand was the peaceable possession  
,of the small part of their once great country,  
| which remained tothem. They entreated the  
Commissioners to look back upon the lands  
from which they had been driven. They al-  
leged that they could retreat no further : because  
the country behind hardly afforded food for its  
| present inhabitants ; and that they had therefore  
resolved to leave their bones in the small space  
to which they were then confined.”

Jated. The next treaty was made about ninety days after, at Fort  
McIntosh, with the Half-King of the Wyandots, Captain Pipe,  
and other chiefs, in behalf of the Wyandot, Delaware, Ottawa  
and Chippewa nations. Treaties were made afterward with di-  
vers Indian nations south of the Ohio river; and the next treaty  
was made with Ka-ki-pila-thy, then present, and other Shawanese  
chiefs, in behalf of the Shawanese nations, at the mouth of the  
Great Miami, which runs into the Ohio river.  
  
The Great Council of the United States — referring to  
Congress — had disposed of large tracts of land thereby ceded,  
and a great number of people had removed from other parts of  
the United States and settled upon them. Many families of their  
ancient fathers, the French, came over the waters and settled  
upon a part of the same lands. This had reference to the French  
settlement at Gallipolis.  
  
When it appeared that a number of the Indians were dis-  
satisfied with the treaties of Fort McIntosh and Miami, the Great  
Council of the United States had appointed Governor St. Clair  
Commissioner, with full powers, for the purpose of removing all  
causes of controversy, regulating trade and settling boundaries  
ketween the Indian nations in the northern departments and the  
United States. Governor St. Clair sent messengers to all the  
nations concerned to meet him at a Council fire which he kindled  
at the falls of the Muskingum. The fire was put out and so  
another Council fire was kindled at Fort Harmar, when near  
six hundred Indians of different nations attended. The treaty  
of Fort Stanwix was then renewed and confirmed by the Six  
Nations, and the treaty of Fort McIntosh was renewed and con-  
firmed by the Wyandots and Delawares. Some Ottawas, Chip-  
pewas, Pottawattamies and Sacs were also parties to this treaty  
at Fort Harmar.

THE DECREES OF THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF AUG. 13TH, 1793.  
  
The commissioners of the United States had formerly set  
up a claim to their whole country, southward of the Great Lakes,  
as the property of the United States. It was now conceded that  
the right of soil of all this country from the Great Lakes south-  
ward was in the Indian Nations so long as they desired to occupy  
the same. The only claim now made was that to the particular  
tracts and the general right of preemption, or the right of pur-  
chasing of the Indian Nations disposed to sell their lands — to  
the exclusion of white people whatever.  
  
The Indians denied that the treaties of Fort Stanwix, Beaver  
Creek (Fort McIntosh) and other places were not complete, and  
insisted that the Ohio river had been fixed as the boundary by  
Sir William Johnson, and that they would not give up the land.  
It was agreed between those deputed by the confederated In-  
dians and Governor St. Clair that no bargains or sale of any  
part of these Indian lands would be considered as valid or bind-  
ing unless ratified by a general council of the confederacy, and  
yet the treaty for the cession of an immense country was held  
with a few chiefs of two or three nations, who were in no man-  
ner authorized to make any grant or concession whatever. I

they should, in return for the favor surrender to their country.  
  
The Indians, with surpassing eloquence, resisted the con-  
tention that they had ever made any agreement with the king,  
or with any other nation, to give to either the exclusive right of  
purchasing their lands, and declared that they were free to make  
any bargain or cession of lands whenever and to whomsoever  
they pleased. If the white people made a treaty that none of them

but the king should purchase the land of the Indians, and had  
given the right to the United States, it is an affair that concerns  
the king and the United States. The power yet remains to be  
exercised by the Indians. They would retreat no further, and  
had resolved to leave their bones in the small space to which  
they were confined. Justice alone would be done by permitting  
the boundary line of the Ohio river to remain between the In-  
dians and the whites, and without such consent no conference  
would be held.  
  
THE OHIO RIVER CANNOT BE THE BOUNDARY.

the mouth of the Detroit river, sent the word to the chiefs and  
warriors of the Indian nations assembled at the foot of the  
Maumee Rapids, on the 16th day of August, 1793, that since it  
was impossible to make the river Ohio the boundary between  
the lands of the Indians and the lands of the United States the  
negotiations were at an end. It was a matter of much regret  
that peace could not be obtained, but knowing the upright and  
liberal views of the United States, which had been explained so  
far as an opportunity had been given, impartial judges would  
not attribute the war to them.  
  
A REVIEW OF THE NEGOTIATIONS.  
  
All negotiations with the Indian tribes of the Northwest to  
secure a permanent and lasting peace were now terminated.  
_ There was nothing left but the arbitrament of battle. The con-  
federate tribes would not lay down their arms except on the one  
condition that the Ohio river should forever be the boundary  
line between their people and the United States. No thought-

great councils of the Confederated tribes without being pro
