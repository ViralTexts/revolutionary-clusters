 the truth of which he does not acknowledge; has reserved for this paper several topic’s, which have more or less influenced the friends &amp; enemies of the bank-bill; and which ought therefore to be communicated to the President.  
1. The enemies of the bill have contended, that a rule of construction, adverse to the power of incorporation, springs out of the constitution, itself; that after the grant of certain powers to Congress, the Constitution, as if cautious, against usurpation, specially grants several other powers, more akin to those before given, than the incorporation of a bank is to any of those, from which it is deduced.  
  
This position they say, has been exemplified in four instances

s through out the United States: to fix the standard of weights &amp; measures; and to establish post offices and post roads.  
2. A Power is given to coin money; and yet is added a power to regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin; and to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the current coin of the United States.  
3. A Power is given to declare war; &amp; yet is added a power to grant letters of Marque and reprisal: to make rules concerning captures on land &amp; water; to raise &amp; support armies: to provide &amp; maintain a Navy: and to make rules for the government &amp; regulation of the Land &amp; naval forces.  
4. A Power is given to provide for calling forth the militia, to execute the Laws of the Union; and yet is added a power to call them forth to suppress insurrections.  
Whosover will attentively inspect the Constitution, will readily perceive the force of what is expressed in the letter of the convention; “That the Constitution was the result of a spirit of amity, and mutual deference &amp; concession.” To argue, then, from its Style or arrangement, as being logically exact, is perhaps a scheme of reasoning not absolutely precise.  
But if the Constitution were ever so perfect, considered even as a composition, the difficulties, which the above Doctrine has started may be solved by the following remarks.  
Those similar powers, on which stress is laid, are either incidental, or substantive, that is independent powers.  
If they be incidental powers, and the conclusion be, that because some incidental powers are expressed, no others are admissible; it wou’d not only be contrary to the common forms of construction, but would reduce the present Congress to the feebleness of the old one, which could exercise no powers, not expressly delegated. So that the advocates for the power of incorporation on the principle of incidentality to some specified power, would, notwithstanding this supposed rule of interpretation, be as much at liberty to insist on its being an incidental power as ever

The manner in which the Constitution is drawn is nearly as  
decisive against the latitudinarian construction which supports  
the protecting system, as if a uegative clause had been added  
in express words forbidding Congress to impose taxes for any  
other purpose than to procure the necessary revenue. If auy  
thing were to be left to implication, the Constitution would vot  
have superadded to the power to coin money, the power to  
regulate its value: or to the power to declare war, the power to  
grant letters of marque and reprisal; to make rules concerning  
cap:ures on land and water; to raise and support armies; to  
make rules for the governmeat aud regulavon of the land and  
paval forces; ta provide for the cabling out the militia; to repel  
invasion; and for the arming, organizing, and disciplining the  
militia.
