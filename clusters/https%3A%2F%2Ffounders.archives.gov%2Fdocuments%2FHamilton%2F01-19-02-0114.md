[New York, December 19, 1795]  
  
The course thus far pursued in the discussion of the 18th article has inverted the order of it as it stands in the Treaty. It is composed of three clauses the two last of which have been first examined. I thought it adviseable in the outset to dispose of an objection which has been the principal source of clamour.  
The first clause, or that which remains to be examined, enumerates the articles which it is agreed shall be deemed contraband of war. These are “all arms and implements serving for the purpose of war such as cannon, muskets, mortars, petards, bombs, grenadoers, carcasses, saucisses, carriages for cannon, musket rests, bandoliers, gun powder, match, salt petre, ball, pike, swords head pieces, cuirasses, halberts, lances, javelins, horse furniture, ho[l]sters, belts and generally all other implements of War; as also timber for ship building, tar or rosin, copper in sheets, sails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may serve directly to the equipment of Vessels, unwrought iron &amp; fir planks only excepted.” All which articles are declared to be just objects of confiscation, when attempted to be carried to an enemy of either party.

ird article of the Treaty of alliance and commerce between GB &amp; Denmark in 1670 the parties agree “not to furnish the enemies of each other with any provisions of War, as soldiers arms engines guns ships or other necessaries for the use of War nor to suffer the same to be furnished by their subjects.” An explanation of this article was made by a Convention dated the 4 of July 1780 which after enumerating as contraband the usual catalogue of military implements adds in the precise terms of our article “as also timber for shipbuilding, tar rosin, copper in sheets sails hemp and cordage and generally whatever may serve directly to the equipment of vessels, unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted.”  
In a series of Treaties between GBritain and Portugal down to the year 1703 I do not discover that there has ever been a regulation of the articles, which are to be tre
