In conformity to the mode, which you have pursued and suggested, I have now the honor of submitting to you an abstract of such particular acts of the United States, as appear to me infractions, on their part, of the definitive treaty of peace concluded between the King my master and the United States. The necessity of collecting from distant parts of this continent the requisite materials, of combining and arranging them has occasioned a much longer delay in presenting to you this abstract than I at first apprehended: I trust however that it will be found so comprehensive as to include every cause of complaint, resulting from the treaty, and so fully substantiated as to require no subsequent elucidations to prove and to confirm the facts which I shall specify.  
Many of the legislative acts and judicial determinations, which I shall adduce as violations of the treaty, having been common to a majority of the states, I have thought it expedient, in order to avoid repetitions, not to discuss the tendency and extent of their operation in the several states distinctly and separately, but to reduce the infractions under general heads, and to throw into the form of an appendix references to justify and explain the documents by which they are authenticated.  
Although I have employed every exertion in my power to acquire the most accurate and general information upon the respective points, comprehended in this abstract, it is still possible, that many materials may have been out of my reach, or that, in the extensive collection of laws and of other documents which I have been obliged to peruse and digest many objects may have escaped my notice. It is possible that acts of the states, of which I have complained, as militating against the treaty of peace, may have been repealed or modified by succeeding legislatures; and that decisions of the State Courts, which I have alleged as violations of the treaty, may have been rectified by subsequent determinations. I am not conscious of any errors or misrepresentations of this nature; but if any such should exist in the abstract, I desire you, Sir, to be persuaded that they have been totally unintentional on my part, and that I shall be extremely solicitous to have them explained and corrected.  
Immediately after the ratification of the definitive treaty of Peace, the Congress of the United States by a proclamation, announcing that event, and by a resolve dated 14 January 1784, required and enjoined all bodies of magistracy, legislative, executive and judiciary, to carry  into effect the definitive articles, and every Clause and sentence thereof, sincerely, strictly and completely—and earnestly recommended to the legislatures of the respective States, to provide for the restitution of all Estates, Rights and Properties confiscated, belonging to real British Subjects, and of Estates, rights and properties of persons resident in districts in possession of his Majesty’s arms between 30th November 1782 and 14th January 1784 who had not borne arms against the United States; and that persons of any other description should have liberty to go to any part of the United States, to remain twelve months, unmolested in their endeavors to obtain the restitution of their Estates, rights and properties confiscated. It was also recommended to the several states to reconsider and revise all laws regarding the premises, so as to render them perfectly consistent with justice and that spirit of conciliation, which, on the return of the blessings of Peace, should universally prevail—and it was farther recommended that the Estates, rights and properties of such last mentioned persons should be restored to them, they refunding the bonâ fide price, paid on purchasing any of the said lands, rights and properties, since the Confiscation.  
In consequence of the little attention which had been manifested to this proclamation and recommendation, and of the answer given (20th February 1786) by the Marquis of Carmarthen to the requisitions of Mr. Adams, respecting the posts and territories ceded by the treaty of Peace to the United States, the Congress transmitted, in April 1787, a circular letter, to the Governors of the respective States, recommending it to the different legislatures to repeal such acts, or parts of acts, as were repugnant to the Treaty of Peace between his Britannic Majesty and the United States or any article thereof, and that the Courts of Law and Equity should be directed and required, in all Causes and Questions cognizable by them respectively, and arising from or touching the said Treaty, to decide and adjudge according to the Tenor, true intent and meaning of the Same, any thing in the said acts or parts of Acts to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.  
In this circular letter, after inforcing in the most energetic manner, the regard due to solemn national compacts and the impropriety of the individual states attempting to contravene, or even discuss, stipulations, which had been sanctioned by their general government, the Congress farther declare, “they have deliberately and dispassionately examined and considered the several facts and matters urged by Great Britain, as infractions of the Treaty of Peace on the part of America; and regret that, in some of the States, too little attention appears to have been paid to the public faith pledged by the Treaty.”  
It is observable that Congress, neither in this proclamation nor  recommendation, take any notice of the fourth article of the Treaty of Peace, by which it was agreed, that Creditors on either side should meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in sterling money, of all bonâ fide debts, theretofore contracted; nor does either the proclamation or recommendation extend to the stipulations in the close of the fifth article, whereby it was agreed that all persons who have any interests in confiscated lands either by debts, marriage settlements, or otherwise, should meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.  
This omission of these essential points can only be ascribed to the conviction that Congress entertained that it was totally unnecessary to specify them, as they were stipulations positive and obligatory upon the individual states, and that no local regulation was competent either to confirm or invalidate them. It does not however appear that this proclamation and recommendation had any general and extensive effect upon the legislatures of the respective States, as, in consequence thereof, even the formality of a municipal adoption of the Treaty, either in the nature of a repeal of existing laws, repugnant to the Treaty of Peace, or of a declaratory law, establishing the Treaty of Peace as the supreme law of the land, seems to have been confined to a small portion of the several states.  
Having thus stated the measures pursued by Congress to give validity and effect to the engagements contained in the treaty of peace, it is now expedient to specify, in detail, the particular acts, which Great Britain considers as infractions of the treaty, on the part of the United States, and it will tend to simplify the discussion to make the following arrangement.  
Ist. To define what Congress has enforced or omitted.  
IInd. To advert to the conduct observed by the individual States generally, in respect to the Treaty of Peace,  
In not repealing laws that existed antecedently to the Pacification,  
In enacting laws subsequent to the peace in contravention of the Treaty,  
And in the decisions of the State Courts upon questions, affecting the rights of British Subjects.  
As to the first of these points, it cannot be presumed that the Commissioners, who negotiated the Treaty of Peace, would engage in behalf of Congress, to make recommendations to the legislatures of the respective States, which they did not expect to be effectual, or enter into direct stipulations, which they had not the power to enforce: And yet the laws were not repealed which Congress recommended to be repealed; nor were the stipulations enforced, which Congress was  absolutely pledged to fulfil. It does not appear that any of the State Legislatures repealed their Confiscation Laws, or provided for the restitution of all estates, rights and properties of real British Subjects, which had been confiscated, and of persons resident in districts in the possession of his Majesty’s arms, who had not borne arms against the United States—that persons of other descriptions, were at liberty to remain twelve months in the United States unmolested in their Endeavors to obtain the restoration of their confiscated Estates, Rights and properties—that the acts of the several states, which respected Confiscations, were in many of the states reconsidered or revised—nor finally, have British Creditors been countenanced or supported either by the respective legislatures, or by the State Courts, in their endeavors to recover the full value of debts, contracted antecedently to the Treaty of Peace. On the contrary in some of the States the Confiscation laws have been acted upon since the Peace, and new legislative Regulations have been established to carry them into effect. In many of the States, the subjects of the Crown, in endeavoring to obtain the restitution of their forfeited Estates and property, upon refunding the price to the purchasers, have been treated with indignity, menaced, exposed to personal danger, and in some instances imprisoned. Prosecutions have been commenced against his Majesty’s Subjects, for the part, which they had taken in the late war. In many of the States, laws have actually passed, delaying the legal investigation of just claims, and abridging the demands of British Merchants. Local Regulations, in respect to the tender of property, in discharge of just debts, have prevailed to such an extent as to amount to a prohibition of suits. Paper money, emitted by particular states, has been made at its nominal value, legal tender and payment for all debts, for the recovery of which actions were commenced at the time, when money of that description was greatly depreciated. Creditors too, in some of the States, were exposed to the necessity of taking real or personal property at a valuation made by a partial, prejudiced or interested neighbourhood, while in other States, when the question of alienage has been under discussion, the Courts of Law and Equity have determined that a subject of Great Britain residing within the King’s dominions, at and after the declaration of Independence, was not competent to acquire or hold real property within the United States. In many of the State Courts, decisions have taken place, reducing the amount of British debts, in violation of the terms of the original Contracts, and some of those Courts have positively refused to take cognizance of suits instituted for the recovery of British debts. These facts will be more fully illustrated under the next head of arrangement.  
  
IInd. To advert to the conduct observed by the individual States, generally, in respect to the Treaty of Peace.  
1st. In not repealing the laws that existed antecedently to the Pacification.  
During the war the respective legislatures  
  
  
Appendix A.  
  
of the United States passed laws   
  
No. 1 to 30 inclusive  
  
to confiscate and sell, to sequester, take possession of, and lease, the Estates of the Loyalists, and to apply the proceeds thereof towards the redemption of Certificates and Bills of Credit, or towards defraying the expences of the war—to enable Debtors to pay into the State Treasuries or Loan Offices paper money then exceedingly depreciated, in discharge of their debts. Under some of the laws, many individuals were attainted by name, others were banished for ever from the Country, and, if found within the state, declared felons without benefit of Clergy. In some States, the Estates and rights of married women, of widows and of minors, and of persons, who had died within the territories possessed by the British arms, were forfeited. Authority also was given to the executive department to require persons who adhered to the Crown, to surrender themselves by a given day and to abide their trials for High Treason; in failure of which the parties so required were attainted, were subject to, and suffered all the pains, penalties and forfeitures awarded against persons attainted of High Treason. In one State (New York) a power was vested in the Courts to prefer Bills of Indictment against Persons alive or dead, who had adhered to the King, or joined his fleets or armies (if in full life and generally reputed to hold or claim, or, if dead, to have held or claimed, at the time of their decease, real or personal Estate)—And upon notice or neglect to appear and traverse the Indictment, or, upon trial and conviction, the persons charged in the Indictment, whether in full life or deceased, were respectively declared guilty of the offences charged, and their Estates were forfeited, whether in possession, reversion or remainder. In some of the States confiscated property   
  
A. No. 31 &amp; 32  
  
was applied to the purposes of public buildings and improvements, in others   
  
No. 33  
  
was appropriated as rewards to individuals for military services rendered during the war, and in one instance Property mortgaged   
  
No. 34  
  
to a British Creditor was liberated from the incumbrance by a special act of the legislature, as a provision for the representatives of the mortgager who had fallen in battle.  
A general repeal of these laws, under the stipulated exceptions, would have been a compliance with the terms of the Treaty of Peace. But the restitution of the Estates, rights and properties, of real British Subjects, or of persons resident in districts in possession of his Majesty’s arms, and who had not borne arms against the United  States, was not provided for by any local law or general regulation, nor did any such law or regulation prevail to support persons of other descriptions in their endeavors to obtain the restitution of such of their Estates, rights and properties as had been confiscated. Some of the State legislatures, it is true, soon after the Peace, passed Acts, in conformity to the Treaty, to provide against farther Confiscations, and to deliver up, under certain conditions and assessments, such lands and tenements, the property of persons described in Confiscation Laws, as had not been confiscated by process of law. Other States have, in certain instances, upon application of the children or friends of attainted Persons, passed laws to restore the ownership of forfeited Estates, upon the payment of a given price in depreciated Certificates, and, in others, without exacting any consideration for the property restored. Acts of Pardon and Oblivion are also to be found in the Statute Book of some of the States, but fettered with such qualifications, exceptions and restraints, as to exclude effectually from the hope of recovery or restitution numbers who were expressly within the meaning and intention of the treaty.  
2nd. In enacting laws subsequent to the Peace in contravention of the Treaty.  
In stating the particular acts that relate to this head of arrangement, it will be proper to place them in three classes.  
  
1. Such as relate to the Estates of the Loyalists;  
2. Such as respect their persons; and lastly,  
3. Such as obstruct the recovery of debts due to the subjects of the Crown.  
  
1. Many of the confiscated Estates being undisposed of, not only at the time the preliminary articles of peace were signed, but even after the conclusion of the definitive Treaty, it would have been perfectly consistent with Justice, and that spirit of conciliation, which ought to have prevailed upon the return of the blessings of Peace, to have suspended the sales of property not then disposed of, to have repealed the laws of confiscation, under certain limitations, and to have restored the rights of married women, of widows and of minors: and though the policy of the different State Governments might exact a rigid adherence to forfeitures incurred by persons who had actually borne arms during the war, yet such a suspension of sales, repeal of laws and restitution of property might have been effected with great convenience in a number of instances, and might have been liberally extended to real British Subjects, and to persons, who had not borne arms against the United States, but who from local residence were liable to the imputation of offence and to the operation of severe penal laws.  
But immediately after the preliminary articles were signed, and for  many  
  
Appendix B  
  
years subsequent to the peace, acts passed the different legislatures   
  
No. 1  
  
of the United States—to confirm forfeitures and confiscations made by virtue of former laws   
  
No. 2  
  
—to secure in their possessions persons who had purchased forfeited lands, tenements, goods and chattels—to sell confiscated property   
  
No. 3 &amp; 4  
  
that remained unsold—to resell such as had been already sold,  
  
No. 5 &amp; 6  
  
and to which no title had been given—and to release   
  
No. 7  
  
from their bargains persons who had misconceived the modes of payment.  
  
No. 8  
  
In one State (Georgia) many years subsequent to the Peace, an act passed, to compel, under severe penalties, the discovery of debts due to merchants and subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, that had been sequestered by particular regulations. Under this act the Auditor of that state has published a formal notice, manifesting his determination to pursue the rigid letter of the law, and to sequester British debts, in   
  
No. 9 &amp; 10  
  
defiance of the solemnity of national engagements. In another State (Maryland) offers have even been held out by legislative authority to persons who, within limited periods, should make discovery of British property, to compound for the same by granting certain portions of such as should be discovered: And these legislative acts extended to forfeited rights and property, generally, without discrimination or distinctions of persons plainly defined in the treaty; distinctions which the spirit of conciliation and the feelings of humanity most forcibly recommended, and which the respective States were fully competent to establish and enforce, when applied to estates and property, either unsold at the period of the peace, or for which (owing to the default of the purchasers) no titles had been given.  
2nd. In respect to the persons who under the Treaty of Peace were to have free liberty to come to any part of the United States, the permission in their favor was in terms the most general and unqualified; and though the period, in which persons of one description were to remain in this Country, was restricted, none, however exceptionable their political Conduct might have been considered by the United States, were debarred from the means, of personal application, and of endeavoring to obtain the restitution of such of their estates, rights and properties as had been confiscated. As to those who, under the appellation of British Subjects had incurred no other imputation of criminality than that of adherence to their Sovereign, and as to others, who, though resident in districts in possession of his Majesty’s forces, had not borne arms against the United States, the express provision in the treaty for the restitution of the Estates and properties of persons of both these descriptions certainly comprehended a virtual acquiescence in their right to reside, where their property was situated, and to be restored to the privileges of Citizenship: This virtual acquiescence may  be justly assumed as an argument in favor even of those, who had borne arms against the United States, and who (if any instances of this kind existed) had been successful in their endeavors to obtain the restoration of their confiscated Estates on refunding to the purchasers the bonâ fide price that had been paid. Acts however of proscription, attainder and banishment, which had passed during the war, and which extended not only to those who had borne arms against the United States, but also to those who had borne arms against their allies; to persons  
  
Appendix C  
  
who had left particular states and gone off with the fleets or armies of Great Britain—to those   
  
No. 1  
  
who had attached themselves to, adhered to, or taken the protection of the government, fleets or armies of Great Britain; who were and still remained absent from the states; who had withdrawn themselves from and still resided beyond the limits of the United States—though repealed as to certain individuals therein named, remained in full force against numbers of every description of persons defined in the Treaty. And subsequent to the Peace, Acts passed several of the State Legislatures   
  
No. 2 &amp; 3  
  
for the purpose of asserting the rights of the States,   
  
No. 4  
  
for preserving their independence, and expelling such aliens   
  
No. 5  
  
as might be dangerous to the peace and good order of government, whereby persons who had left the States, gone off   
  
No. 6  
  
to or taken the protection of the government, fleet or armies of Great Britain, or aided, assisted or abetted the same, or had borne arms,  
  
No. 7 &amp; 8  
  
exercised or accepted military commands, or owned or fitted out armed vessels to cruize against the United States or their allies, or had been joined to the fleets or armies, or to any volunteer corps of the King, or had held any office at particular boards instituted during the war—and all other absentees named in divers acts   
  
No. 2  
  
of confiscation, or who had been banished, or sent out of the States, were forbidden to return without licence   
  
C. No. 2, 7 &amp; 8  
  
at their peril, or were subject to disqualifications, to prosecution and tedious imprisonment, if they remained after notice   
  
No. 6  
  
given to depart the State. In some States the ceremony of notice was dispensed with, and the parties upon being found therein were liable to imprisonment, to the confiscation of the property they possessed,  
  
No. 9 &amp; 10  
  
and in other States to the penalty of death. In some of the States, it is true, permission was given to certain individuals to return unconditionally but in others   
  
No. 12, 13, 14  
  
the indulgence was of momentary duration, and the unfortunate objects of it were then banished from their Connections and friends for ever.  
To this it may be added that though the Treaty of peace expressly declares that no future confiscations shall be made nor any prosecutions commenced against any persons for or by reason of the part which they might have taken during the war, confiscation acts  
  
No. 15  
  
have passed  since the preliminary articles were signed, and sales have been made of confiscated Estates long since the Peace; Acts have also passed for granting effectual relief in cases  
  
No. 16  
  
of trespasses, and pointing out modes for the recovery of property acquired while the King’s troops occupied particular districts, whereby it was made lawful for any inhabitants of the State, who had left their places of abode, and had not since voluntarily put themselves into the power of the King’s troops, to bring actions of trespass against any person who had occupied, injured or destroyed their Estate either real or personal within the power of the King’s troops, or against persons who had received or purchased such goods or effects; and the purchasers of property, under sales made in districts occupied by the Royal Army, were required to restore and deliver up the same under the penalty   
  
C. No. 17  
  
of forfeiting treble the value of such property, so obtained, and neglected to be delivered or restored; to the great inconvenience of many who had used, possessed, or acquired real and personal property, under the sanction of the only authority existing in the districts wherein the property was situated, an authority justified by the laws and usages of nations, and confirmed by the letter and spirit of the Treaty of Peace. The Persons who were the objects of the Trespass law were still more oppressed by it’s operation, in consequence of a subsequent act   
  
No. 18  
  
suspending prosecutions for acts done to promote the American cause, which was manifestly levelled at the friends of the Crown, and deprived them of the means of satisfaction for those acts of outrage, which had involved them in loss and ruin. And in order to provide for the enforcement of these Trespass laws   
  
No. 19  
  
against Absentees, the remedy of attachment against absconding Debtors was extended to the recovery of Damages sustained by the injury, destruction or occupancy of real or personal Estates during the war, whereby Absentees, though in a state of legal exile, were considered as absconding Debtors.  
3rd. The securing of the enormous debt due from the Citizens of the United States to the merchants of Great Britain, being an object of important consideration to his Majesty’s Government in arranging and discussing the terms of the Treaty of Peace, was expressly provided for in it; though stipulations of that nature are not usual in treaties between independent nations: as the engagements of individuals of different countries are not liable to the intervention of partial local regulations, but rest upon the sacred and permanent basis of universal justice. The magnitude of this object cannot therefore be better ascertained than by this circumstance and accordingly a solemn and unequivocal stipulation was introduced into the Treaty, “that Creditors, on either side, should meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full  value in sterling money of all bonâ fide debts heretofore contracted”; a stipulation as precise and definite as to the measure and mode of recovery and payment, as it was general and unqualified in respect to the debts to be recovered. “The full value in sterling money” could only mean the value, to be ascertained by the nature and terms of the original contract between Debtor and Creditor, and to be paid in sterling money, according to the rate of exchange prevailing between the two Countries. “All bonâ fide debts heretofore contracted” comprehended every species of debt, due to the Creditors on either side, contracted antecedent to, and which remained unpaid at, the period of concluding the Treaty of Peace.  
Hithertò Great Britain has anxiously, though in vain, expected from the United States the fulfilment of this article  
  
Appendix D  
  
in behalf of her suffering merchants: But prohibitions of suits and personal disabilities,  
  
No. 1  
  
created during the war, to commence actions remained unrepealed and have been protracted to periods subsequent to the peace. Acts   
  
No. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  
  
too have passed   
  
No. 7  
  
since the peace suspending for a time the recovery of debts and the issuing of executions. Courts have been authorized by law to direct and admit the reduction of interest;   
  
No. 8  
  
and the absolute reduction of interest for a limited number of years has been provided for. Laws   
  
No. 9  
  
which   
  
No. 10  
  
existed before the war, compelling Creditors to take the debtor’s land at an appraised value, remained unrepealed, notwithstanding the change of circumstances   
  
No. 11  
  
in the two Countries had, in some of the State Courts, tended to establish principles of alienage which have been carried to so rigorous an extent, applied to British Subjects, as to inspire doubts of their competency to acquire or hold real property within the United States. New tender and valuation Laws   
  
No. 12  
  
have been passed subsequent to the Peace, by the operation of which Creditors were reduced to the alternative,   
  
No. 13  
  
either of accepting under partial appraisements resulting from prescribed modes   
  
No. 14  
  
of valuation real and personal property which bore no proportion to the value of the original debt, and for which they could command no price whatsoever; or of having the persons of their Debtors protected from Arrests or discharged from executions.   
  
D No. 15  
  
British Subjects and their agents were compelled to give security to pay all just debts due from the Creditors to any citizen of the state, as far as the amount of the debts to be collected, before any debtor   
  
No. 16  
  
could be compelled to make payment. Paper money emitted and made current for a number of years was constituted legal tender for payment and discharge of any debt, bargain or sale, bond, mortgage, specialty or contract whatsoever “already made or hereafter to be made” either for sterling money, silver money, dollars or any species   
  
No. 17, 18, 19  
  
of gold or silver. Instalment laws   
  
No. 20  
  
have passed restraining for a time the  commencement of suits and then limiting the modes of recovering all debts due previous to the month of February 1782, and of obligations taken since that time for debts previously incurred, to three annual payments of one third of the principal and interest in each successive year:  
  
No.21  
  
These restrictions and limitations were afterwards extended to all debts contracted previous to the 1st January 1787; and when these limitations, in which the British merchants most patiently and benevolently acquiesced, were about to expire, a new Instalment Law   
  
No. 22  
  
was passed, protracting the period of payments five years longer and restraining the recovery even of bonds or notes, given payable according to the instalment prescribed by the former acts, to the manner directed in the last Instalment law.  
It is worthy of observation that this latter Instalment Law passed subsequent to the formation of the federal Constitution, which ordains that all Treaties, made, or which should be made, under the authority of the United States, should be the supreme law of the land, and that the Judges in each state, should be bound thereby and every Senator and Representative of the United States, members of the several State legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers both of the United States and of the several states, were to be bound by Oath or Affirmation to support that Constitution.  
3rd. The last point of discussion relates to the decisions of State Courts upon questions affecting the rights of British Subjects; in respect to which the dispensations of law have for the most part, been as unpropitious to the subjects of the Crown as the legislative acts of the different Assemblies throughout this continent: It must however be allowed that in one State (Massachusetts Bay) where great property was at stake, Justice has been liberally dispensed, and, notwithstanding a particular regulation of the State warranted the deduction of that portion of the interest on British debts which accrued during the war, the Courts, in conformity to the plain terms of the Treaty, have admitted and directed the Quantum of the demand to be regulated by the original Contract; and where the Contract bore interest, or the custom of the trade justified the charge, the full interest has been allowed to British Creditors, notwithstanding the intervention of war. On the other hand it is to be lamented, that in a more distant state (Georgia) it was a received Principle, inculcated by an opinion of the highest judicial authority there, that as no legislative act of the state existed, confirming the treaty of peace with Great Britain, war still continued between the two countries; a principle which may perhaps still continue in that state, as it is one of those that have not to this  moment, paid any municipal regard to the different recommendations of Congress to the several legislatures, to repeal all laws inconsistent with the Treaty of Peace.  
The decisions of the State Courts having affected the claims and persons of British Subjects, a short view will be taken of some of the most important decisions, under these two heads.  
1st. In the prosecution of claims, instituted by British merchants for debts contracted previous to the war, proof of the usage of the Trade to allow interest after the expiration of a year on the amount of the goods shipped, or of the specific contract between the Debtor and Creditor has been uniformly establshed; the full value of the debt, to be recovered, ought consequently to have been nothing short of the debt and interest according to the usage of the trade or to the terms  
  
Appendix E  
  
of the Contract:   
  
No. 1  
  
But under the direction of many of the Courts, Juries have invariably abated interest on the British debts for seven years and a half. Even the solemnity of obligations   
  
No. 2 &amp; 3  
  
has not been found of sufficient force to secure the Creditor from this deduction, it having been determined that obligations, which on the face of the Contract itself bore interest, were upon no better footing in this respect than Book Debts, in which the intervention of war and the prohibitory resolves of Congress were deemed sufficient Grounds to destroy the usage between the British and American Trader, by abating the interest for the period the war continued; and that as the Debtor was deprived of the means of making payment, unless by a violation of a positive restrictive law, prohibiting remittances as a means of strengthening the enemy, and as it would have been criminal to have remitted during the war, no man should suffer for his obedience to the laws, or be answerable for the interest while the laws of the land restrained him from remitting the principal. The treaty of Peace too has been considered as having no effect upon this question, it having been held that the Treaty only secured the mutual recovery of debts, when the amount was ascertained; but the amount of the debts was to be settled by the laws of the land.  
In one state particularly, in which the claim of interest  
  
E No. 4  
  
has been generally involved in the recovery of British debts, that had been paid in consequence of legislative acts into the State Treasury, the superior Court of the State determined, that the construction of the Treaty and the acts of the State intitled the Creditor to recover the principal of his debt and all interest thereon, which had not arisen during the war, and that as by the intervention of war the means of recovering British debts were suspended, the claim of interest during the suspension,  was inadmissible. It was admitted that notwithstanding the payments into the Treasury the Treaty of Peace restored the right of action; but interest was recoverable only from the date of the definitive Treaty.  
In one of the Southern States (Virginia) where debts to a very considerable amount are depending, the suits, that have been instituted for their recovery, have been referred to the district Courts of the State, and some of the Causes having stood for several years under a mere formal continuance upon the records have been adjourned, for difficulty, to the General Court, wherein they still remain undecided, and others, it is said, have been actually dismissed. The delay of Justice, operating equally  
  
No. 5  
  
as a denial of Justice, would have been effectually reformed in that State by the provisions of a particular law giving summary relief in determining disputes wherein Subjects of those Countries, which had acknowledged or should hereafter recognize the independence of the United States, were parties against the Citizens of that state; but unfortunately for the British Creditors, upon the conclusion of Peace, it was soon found that this summary relief extended to British debts in common with the claims of other foreigners whose Sovereigns had recognized the independence of the United States, and that some of the Judges favored the idea; and so much of the act as points out and authorizes the mode of proceeding in suits wherein foreigners were   
  
E No. 6  
  
parties, was repealed, and at this moment the means of recovery depend solely upon limitations and conditions   
  
No. 7  
  
created by local regulations, which are in direct opposition to the recommendatory resolves of Congress and palpable infractions of the fourth article of the Treaty of Peace.  
The few attempts to recover British debts in the County Courts of that State have universally failed; and these are the Courts wherein from the smallness of the sum, a considerable number of debts can only be recovered.  
A farther hardship, under which the British Creditors labor, is that they are answerable and proceeded against by Course of Law for every claim brought against them; when at this moment it is not a settled point whether even the federal Court, in that district, will entertain, in their behalf, suits to which that Jurisdiction is competent, the Circuit Court of the United States, after very solemn argument, having adjourned the Question.  
In addition to these observations it is necessary to mention, that in some others of the Southern States, there does not exist a single instance of the recovery of a British Debt in their Courts, though so many years have expired since the establishment of Peace between the two Countries.  
  
2nd. The proceedings of the State Courts upon points, which affected the persons of British Subjects have been equally repugnant to the Terms of the Treaty. In one State suits have been instituted under the acts  
  
E No. 8  
  
for granting a more effectual relief in cases of certain trespasses, for the recovery of damages resulting from the occupancy of estates, held in districts in the possession of his Majesty’s arms, by virtue of licence and permission from the Commanders in Chief; and though the licence and permission were pleaded, and it was stated upon the record that after the declaration of independence by Congress, there was open war between the two Countries—that the place where the Estates were situate continued in the uninterrupted Possession of the Royal Army during the whole period they were occupied under such licence and permission, and as long as the same remained in force—that by the Treaty of Peace the claim which the subjects or citizens of either of the contracting Parties had to recompence or retribution for injuries done to each other in consequence of or relating to the war, were mutually relinquished and released—that the Parties, against whom the suits were instituted, were subjects of the Crown, residing in a district occupied by the Royal Army, where the Estate in question was situate, under the protection of the King then at war with this Country: These Pleas were overruled by the Court as insufficient, and Damages have been awarded against the Parties for the time the Estates were so occupied by them, to the great injury of numbers who had during the war actually paid a competent rent for the property they occupied, under the authority of the Commander in Chief.  
In another State an indictment has lately been preferred against a  
  
E No. 9  
  
subject of the Crown for the murder of a citizen of the United States found under suspicious circumstances within the Royal lines. Though the Grand Jury did not find the bill of indictment against the party, as the facts alledged were not sufficiently proved, they postponed a farther inquiry to a future time, to give the prosecutor an opportunity of producing farther testimony, in which the Court acquiesced and refused to discharge the Prisoner, observing when the Counsel moved for his discharge, that the Commission for holding the Court of Oyer and Terminer did not expire for some months, and the Court would again sit before the Period expired. The Prisoner was however admitted to bail upon his own recognizance in £500 and two Sureties in £250 each; but as his friends doubted the disposition of the Court to determine according to the terms of the Treaty, they thought it more prudent to suffer the forfeiture of the recognizances, than to put his life again into jeopardy.  
In that state also actions of trespass have been instituted for taking  and driving off Cattle during the war, converting indictable offences into civil suits with a view of eluding the stipulations of the Treaty; but with what success has not been ascertained.  
Upon this last head of arrangement, it is only necessary farther to observe that the prosecutions in the cases specified are all direct and positive violations of the sixth article of the Treaty of Peace.  
From the foregoing detail it is evident—that the recommendations of Congress to the respective State-legislatures have in some of the states been totally disregarded, and in none have produced that complete and extensive effect which Great Britain, from the stipulations of the Treaty, was perfectly justifiable in expecting and requiring—that, since the Peace, many of the States have passed laws in direct contravention of the definitive treaty, and essentially injurious to the estates, rights and properties of British Subjects, in whose favor precise distinctions were clearly defined and expressed in the treaty—that although some of the States may have repealed their exceptionable laws partially or generally, yet in a majority of the states they still exist in full force and validity—and that in some of the State Courts actions have been commenced and prosecuted with success against individuals for the part they had taken in the war; which actions were in their origin positive contraventions of the sixth article of the treaty, and in their consequences materially detrimental to the rights and property of many subjects of the Crown of Great Britain.  
In consequence of the violation of the treaty in these particulars, great numbers of his Majesty’s subjects have been reduced to a state of penury and distress, and the nation of Great Britain has been involved in the payment to them of no less a sum than four millions sterling, as a partial compensation for the losses they had sustained.  
It is farther manifest that the stipulation in the fourth article of the treaty, which provides for the recovery of the debts due to the subjects of the two Countries respectively, has been not only evaded in many of the states, but that municipal regulations have been established in them in avowed contravention of it—and that in many instances the means and prospect of obtaining redress are nearly as remote as ever. Since in one State, in which a Sum far exceeding one million sterling is still due to British Creditors, the supreme federal Court has thought proper to suspend for many months the final judgment on an action of debt brought by a British Creditor, and since, in the same State, the County Courts (which alone can take cognizance of debts of a limited amount) have uniformly rejected all suits instituted for the recovery of sums due to the Subjects of the Crown of Great Britain.  
The delay, which has arisen in the administration of justice, has  with equal propriety been stated as equivalent to an infraction of the treaty: For by the effect of that delay many descriptions of his Majesty’s Subjects have been exposed not only to material inconvenience, but in various cases to the ruin and absolute loss of their property.  
The conduct of Great Britain in all these respects has been widely different from that which has been observed by the United States. In the former Country, the Legislature has never harboured the intention of enacting regulations, which might invalidate a national compact, or affect the sacred tenor of engagements contracted between individuals. And in the Courts of Law, the Citizens of the United States have experienced without exception the same protection and impartial distribution of justice as the subjects of the Crown. Examples can be adduced of judgment having been given in favor of American Creditors in actions of debt brought even against Loyalists, the whole of whose property had been seized by legislative acts of the States, in which it was situated, and appropriated in the first instance to the liquidation of the very description of debts, for which these suits were commenced against them in England.  
Such is the nature of the specific facts, which the King my master has considered as infractions of the Treaty on the part of the United States, and in consequence of which his Majesty has deemed it expedient to suspend the full execution on his part of the seventh article of that treaty. On this head also it is necessary to premise the following evident distinction—that the King has contented himself with a mere suspension of that article of the treaty, whereas the United States have not only withheld from subjects of the Crown that redress to which they were entitled under the terms of the treaty, but also many of the States have, subsequent to the peace, passed new legislative regulations, in violation of the treaty, and imposing additional hardships on individuals, whom the national faith of the United States was pledged, under precise and solemn stipulations, to insure and protect from future injury.  
On the grounds therefore of the irreparable injury, which many classes of his subjects have sustained, and of the heavy expence to which the British nation has been subjected by the non-performance of their engagements on the part of the United States, the measure that the King has adopted (of delaying his compliance with the seventh article of the treaty) is perfectly justifiable. Nevertheless his Majesty’s sincere desire to remove every occasion of misunderstanding has induced him to direct me to express his readiness, to enter into a negociation with respect to those articles of the treaty, which have not been executed by the two Countries respectively; and to consent to such  arrangements upon the subject, as, after due examination, may now be found to be of mutual convenience and not inconsistent with the just claims and rights of his subjects.—I have the honor to be, with sincere respect and esteem, Sir, Your most obedient and most humble servant,

sin,  
  
* conformity to the mode which you have purſued and ſuggeſted, I  
  
have now the honour of ſubmitting to you an abſtract of ſuch particular  
acts of the United States, as appear to me infractions, on their part, of the  
definitive treaty of peace, concluded between the king my maſter and the  
United States. The neceflity of collecting from diſtant parts of this con-  
tinent the requifite materials of combining and arranging them, has occa-  
ſioned a much longer delay in preſenting to you this abſtract than I at firſt  
  
  
include every cauſe of complaint, reſulting from the treaty, and fo fully  
ſubſtantiated as to require no ſubſequent elucidations to prove and to con-  
firm the facts which I ſhall ſpecify. |  
  
Many of the legiſlative acts and judicial aererminations which I ſhall  
adduce as violations of the treaty, having been common to a majority of  
the States, I have thought it expedicnt, in order to avoid repetitions, not  
to diſcuſs the tendency and extent of their operation in the ſeveral States

diſtinctly and ſeparately, but to reduce the infraftions under general heads,  
and to throw into the form of an appendix references to juſtify and explain  
the documents by which they are authenticated. .  
  
Although I have employed every exertion in my power to acquire the  
moſt accurate and general information upon the reſpective points compre-  
hended in this abſtract, it is fill poſſible, that many materials may have  
been out of my reach, or that, in the extenſive collection of laws and of  
other documents which I have been obliged to peruſe and digeſt, many  
objects may have eſcaped my notice. It is poſſible, that acts of the States,  
of which I have complained, as militating againſt the treaty of peace, may  
have been repealed or modified by ſucceeding legiſlatures; and that deci-  
ſons of the Rate courts, which I have alleged as violations of the treaty,  
may have been reEtified by ſubſequent determinations, I am not conſcious  
of any errors or miſrepreſentations of this nature; but if any ſuch ſhould  
exiſt in the abſtract, I deſire you, fir, to be perſuaded, that they have been  
totally unintentional on my part, and that I ſhall be extremely ſolicitous to  
have them explained and corrected.  
  
Immediately after the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace, the  
congreſs of the United States, by a proclamation, announcing that event,  
and by a reſolve dated 14th Jan. 1784, required and enjoined all bodies  
cf magiſtracy, legiſlative, executive, and judiciary, to carry into effect the  
definitive articles, and every clauſe and ſentence thereof, ſincerely, ſtrictly,  
and completely—and earneſtly recommended to the legiſlatures of the re-  
ſpective States, to provide for the reſtitution of all eſtates, rights, and pro-  
perties confiſcated, belonging to real Britiſh ſubjects, and of eſtates, rights,  
and properties of perſons reſident in diſtricts in poſſeſſion of his Majeſty&#x27;s  
arms, between the zoth Nov. 1782, and 14th Jan. 1784, who had not  
borne arms againſt the United States; and that perſons of any other de-  
ſcription ſhould have liberty to go to any part of the United States, to re-  
main twelve months, unmoleſted in their endeavours to obtain the reſtitu  
tion of their eſtates, rights, and properties confiſcated, It was alſo recom-  
mended to the ſeveral States to reconſider and reviſe all laws regarding the  
premiſes, ſo as to render them perfectly conſiſtent with juſtice, and that  
ſpirit of conciliation, which, on the return of the bleſſings of peace,  
ſhould univerſally prevail—and it was farther recommended, that the  
&lt;fates, rights, and properties of ſuch laſt-mentioned perſons ſhould be re-  
ſtored to them, they refunding the bona fide price paid on purchaſing any  
ef the ſaid lands, rights, and properties, ſince the confiſcation.  
  
In conſequence of the little attention, which had been manifeſted to this  
proclamation and recommendation, and of the anſwer given (20 Feb. 1786)  
by the marquis of Carmarthen, to the requiſitions of Mr. Adams, reſpect-

States, the congreſs tranſmitted, in April 1787, a circular letter to the  
governors of the reſpective States, recommending it to the different legilla-  
tures, to repeal ſuch acts, or parts of acts, as were repugnant to the treaty  
of peace between his Britannic majeſty and the United States, or any article  
thereof, and that the courts of law and equity ſhould be directed and re-  
quired, in all cauſcs and queſtions cognizable by them reſpeRtively, and  
ariſing from, or touching the ſaid treaty, to decide and adjudge, according  
to the tenor, true intent, and meaning of the ſame, any thing in the ſaid  
acts or parts of acts to the contrary thereof in any wiſe notwithſtanding.  
  
In this circular letter, after inforcing in the moſt energetic manner, the  
regard due to ſolemn national compatts, and the impropriety of the in-  
dividua! States attempting to contravenc, or even diſcuſs ſtipulations, which  
had been fanctioned by their general government, the congreſs farther  
declare * they have deliberately and diſpaſſionately examined and conh-  
dered the ſeveral facts and matters urged by Great Britain as infraftions  
of the treaty of peace, on the part of America; and regret, that, in ſome  
of the States, too little attention appears to have been paid to the pale  
faith, pledged by the treaty,  
  
It is obſervable that congreſs, neither in this oroclewetion nor recom-  
mendation, take any notice of the fourth article of the treaty of peace, by  
which it was agreed that creditors on either fide ſhould meet with nc law-  
ful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in fierling money, of all  
bona fide debts theretofore contracted; nor does either the proclamation  
or recommendation extend to the ſtipulations in the cloſe of the fifth  
  
  
confiſcated lands, either by debts, marriage ſettlements, or otherwiſe, ſhould  
  
  
This omiſſion of theſe eſſential points can only be aſcribed to the con-  
viction that congrels entertained, that it was totally unneceſſary to ſpecify |  
  
  
States, and that no local regulation was competent either to confirm or in-  
validate them. It does not, however, appear that this proclamation and  
recommendation had any general and extenſive effect upon the legiſlatures  
  
  
2 municipal adoption of the treaty, either in the nature of a repeal of exiſt-  
ing laws, repugnant to the treaty of peace, or of a declaratory law, eſta-  
bliſhing the treaty of peace as the ſupreme law of the land, ſeems to have  
been confined to a ſmall portion of the ſeveral States.  
  
Having thus ſtated the meaſures purſued by congreſs to give validity  
and effect to the engagements contained in the treaty of peace, it is now  
  
Aw © :« to *&lt;  
  
+» ST 8 BB” T7  
  
r  
expedient to ſpecify in detail, the particular acts, which Great Britain con-  
{ders as infractions of the treaty, on the part of the United States, and it  
will tend to ſimplify the diſcuſſion to make the following arrangement :  
I, To define what congreſs has enforced or omitted.  
II. To advert to the conduct obſerved by the individual States gene-  
rally, in reſpect to the treaty of peace, |  
In not repealing laws that exiſted antecedently to the pacification,  
In enacting laws ſubſequent to the peace in contravention of the treaty,  
And in the deciſions of the State courts upon queſtions affecting the  
gebts of Britiſh ſubjects. | |  
As to the firſt of theſe points, it cannot be preſumed, that the commiſ-  
foners, who negociated the treaty of peace, would engage in behalf of  
congreſs, to make recommendations to the legiſlatures of the reſpective  
dates, which they did not expect to be effectual, or enter into direct ſti-  
pulations, which they had not the power to enforce. And yet the laws  
were not repealed which congreſs recommended to be repealed, nor were  
the ſtipulations enforced which congreſs was abſolutely piedged to fulfil.  
t does not appear—that any of the State legiſlatures repealed their confiſ-  
cation laws, or provided for the reſtitution of all eſtates, rights and pro-  
perties of real Britiſh ſubjects which had been confiſcated, and of perſons  
readent in diſtricts in the poſſeſſion of his Majeſty&#x27;s arms, who had not borne  
ams againſt the United States—that perſons of other deſcriptions were at  
liberty to remain twelve months in the United States, unmoleſted in their en-  
deavours to obtain the reſtoration of their confiſcated eftates, rights and pro-  
perties, that the acts of the ſeveral States, which reſpected conſiſcations, were  
in many of the States reconſidered or reviſed—nor finally, have Britiſh cre-  
ditors been countenanced or ſupported either by the reſpective legiſlatures,  
or by State courts, in their endeavours to recover the full value of debts,  
contracted antecedently to the treaty of peace. On the contrary, in ſome of  
the States, the confiſcation laws have been acted upon fince the, peace, and  
neu legiſlative regulations have been eſtabliſhed to carry them into eſſect.  
In many of the States, the ſubjects of the crown, in endeavouring to ob-  
din the reſtitution of their forfeited eſtates and property, upon refunding  
tae price to the purchaſers, have been treated with indignity—menaced,  
expoſed to perſonal danger, and in ſome inſtances impriſoned. Prolecu-  
tions have been commenced againſt his Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects for the part  
which they had taken in the late war. In many of the States, laws  
have actually paſſed, delaying the legal inveſtig tion of” juſt claims,  
and abridging the demands of Britiſh merchants. , Local regulations, in  
reſpect to the tender of property, in diſcharge of juſt debts, have pre-  
Vailed to ſuch an extent as to amount to a prohibition of ſuits. Paper

legal tender and payment for all debts, for the recovery of which actions  
were commenced at the time when money of that deſcription was greatly  
depreciated, Creditors, too, in ſome of the States, were expoled to the  
neceſſity of taking real or perſonal property, at a valuation made by a

was not competent to acquire or hold real property within the United  
States. In many of the State courts, deciſions have taken place, reducing  
the amount of Britiſh debts, in violation of the terms of the original con-  
tracts, and ſome of thoſe courts have poſitively refuſed to take cognizance  
of ſuits inſtituted for the recovery of Britiſh debts. Theſe facts will be

1&amp;. In not repealing the laws that exiſted antecedently to the pacification,  
During the war, the reſpective legiſlatures of the United States paſſed  
laws to confiſcate and ſell, to ſequeſter, take poſſeſſion of, and leaſe the  
eſtates of the loyaliſts, and to apply the proceeds thereof, towards the re-  
demption of certificates and bills of credit, or towards defraying the ex-  
pences of the war—to enable debtors to pay into the State treaſuries,  
or loan offices, paper money, then exceedingly depreciated, in diſcharge of  
their debts. Under ſome of the laws, many individuals were attainted by  
name, others were baniſhed for ever from the country, and, if found within  
the State, declared felons without benefit of clergy. In ſome States, the  
eſtates and rights of married women, of widows, and of minors, and of  
perſons who had died within the territories poſſeſſed by the Britiſh arms,  
were forfeited, Authority alſo was given to the executive department to  
require perſons who adhered to the crown, to ſurrender themſelves by a  
given day, and to abide their trials for high treaſon ; in failure of which,  
the parties ſo required were attainted, were ſubject to, and ſuffered, all  
the pains, penalties, and forfeitures awarded againſt perſons attainted of  
high treaſon. In one State (New-York), a power was veſted in the  
courts, to prefer bills of indictment againſt perſons alive or dead, who had  
adhered to the king, or joined his fleets or armies (if in full life, and ge-  
nerally reputed to hold or claim, or, if dead, to have held or claimed, at  
the time of their deceaſe, real or perſonal eſtate). And upon notice or  
neglect to appear and traverſe the indictment, or, upon trial and convic - |

ings and improvements ; in others was appropriated as rewards to indivi-  
goals for military ſervices rendered during the war; and, in one inſtance,  
property mortgaged to a Britiſh creditor was liberated from the incum-  
brance by a ſpecial act of the legiſlature, as a proviſion for the repreſenta-  
tives of the mortgager, who had fallen in battle.  
  
A general repeal of theſe laws, under the ftipulated exceptions,  
would have been a compliance with the terms of the treaty of peace.

law or regulation prevail, to ſupport perſons of other deſcriptions in  
their endeavours to obtain the reſtitution of ſuch of their eſtates,  
nghts, and properties, as had been confiſcated.” Some of the ſtate legif-  
atures, it is true, ſoon after the peace, paſſed acts, in conformity to the  
treaty, to provide againſt farther confiſcations, and to deliver up, un-  
der certain conditions and aſſeſſments, fuch lands and tenements, the pro-  
perty of perſons deſcribed in confiſcation laws, as had not been confiſcated  
by proceſs of law. Other ſtates have in certain inſtances, upon application  
cf the children or friends of attainted perſons, paſſed laws to reſtore the  
ownerſhip of forfeited eſtates, upon the payment of a given price in de-  
preciated certificates, and, in others, without exacting any conſideration for

perſons who had actually borne arms during the war, yet ſuch a ſuſpenſion  
of ſal-s, repeal of laws, and reſtitution cf property, might have been ef.  
fecten with great convenience in a number of inſtances, and might have  
been liberally extended to real Bitiſh ſubjects, and to perſons who had  
not borne arms againſt the United States, but who, from local reſidence,  
were liable to the imputation of __ &quot;4 and to the operation of ſevere  
penal laws, |  
  
But immediately after the preliminary articles were peed, and for  
many years ſubſequent to the peace, acts paſſed the different legiſlatures  
  
  
virtue of former laws; to ſecure in their poſſeſſions, perſons who had pur-  
chaſed forfeited lands, tenements, goods and chattels; ro fell confiſcated  
property that remained unſold; to reſell ſuch as had heen already fold,  
and to which no title had been given; and to releaſe from their bargains,  
perſons who had miſconceived the modes of payment. In one ſtate  
(Georgia), many years ſubſequent to the peace, an act paſſed to compel,  
  
  
regulations. Under this act, the auditor of that ſtate has publithed a  
formal notice, manifeſting his determination to purſue the rigid letter of  
  
  
tional engagements. In another State (Maryland), offers have even been  
held out by legiſlative authority, to perſons, wha, within limited periods,  
  
  
granting certain portions cf ſuch as ſhould be diſcovered : and theſe legiſ-  
lative acts, extended to forfeited rights and property, generally, without  
diſcrimination or diſtinctions of perſons plainly defined in the treaty ; diſ-  
  
  
moſt forcibly recommended, and which the reſpective ſtates were fully  
competent to eſtabliſh and enforce, when applied to eſtates and property,

duct might have been conſidered by the United States, were debarred from  
the means of perſonal application, and of endeavouring to obtain the reſti-  
tution of ſuch of their eſtates, rights and properties as had been confif-  
cated. As to thoſe who, under the appellation of Britiſh ſubjects, had in-  
curred no other imputation of criminality than that of adherence to their  
ſovereign, and as to others who, though reſident in diftris&#x27;in poſſeſſion  
of his Majeſty&#x27;s forces, had not borne arms againſt the United States, the  
expreſs proviſion in the treaty for the reſtitution of the eſtates and proper-  
tics of perſons of both theſe deſcriptions, certainly camprehended a virtual  
acquieſcence in their right to refide, where their property was ſituated,  
and to be reſtored to the privileges of citizenſhip. This virtual acquieſ-  
cence may be juſtly aſſumed as an argument in favour even of thoſe who  
bad borne arms againſt the United States, and who (if any inſtances of  
this kind exiſted) had been ſucceſsful in their endeavours to obtain the  
eftoration of their confiſcated eſtetes, on refunding to the purchaſers the  
bona fide price that had been paid, Acts, however, of proſcription, at-  
tainder, and baniſhment, which had paſſed during the war, and which  
extended, not only to thoſe who had borne arms againſt the United States,  
but alſo to thoſe who had borne arms againſt their allies; to perſons who  
had loft particular ſtates, and gone off with the fleets or armies of Great  
  
  
protection of the government, flcets, or armies&#x27; of Great Britain; who  
were, and ſtill remained abſent from the States; who had withdrawn them-  
ſelves from, and ſtill refided beyond the limits of the United States, though  
repealed as to certain individuals therein named, remained in full force  
acainſt numbers of every deſcription of perſons defined in the treaty. And  
ſubſequent to the peace, acts paſſed ſeveral of the ſtate legiſlatures, for the pur-  
poſe of aſſerting the rights of the ſtates for preſerving their independence, and  
expelling ſuch aliens as might be dangerous to the peace and good order  
of rovernment : whereby perſons who had left the ſtates, gone off to, or  
taken the protection of the government, fleet, or armies of Great - Britain;  
er aided, aſſiſted, or abetted the ſame; or had borne arms, exerciſed, or  
  
  
gainſt the United States or their allies; or had been joined to the fleets or  
amies, or to any voluntcer corps of the King, or had held any office at  
particular boards inftituted during the war; and all other abſentecs named

ceremony of notice was diſpenſed with, and the parties upon being found  
therein were liable to impriſunment, to the confiſcation of the property they  
poſſeſſed, and, in other ſtates, to the penalty af death. In ſome of the  
ſtates, it is cue, permiſſion was given to cegtain individuals to return un-

ty acquired while the king&#x27;s troops occupied particular diſtricts, whereby it

property ſo obtained, and neglected to be delivered or reſtored. ; ta the  
great inconvenience of many who had uſed, poſſeſſed, or acquired. real and |  
perſonal property, under che ſanction of the only authority exiſting in the  
diſtricts wherein the property was ſituated, an authority juſtified by the  
laws and uſages of nations, and confirmed by the letter and ſpirit of the  
treaty of peace, The perſons who were the objects of the treſpaſs-law  
were ſtill more oppreſſed by its operation, in conſequence of a ſubſequent  
act, ſuſpending proſecutions for acls done to promote the American cauſe,  
which was manifeſtly levelled at the friends of the crown, and deprived  
them of the means of ſatis faction for thoſe acts of outrage which had in-  
volved them in loſs and ruin. And, in order to provide for the enforce- -

Vnited States to the merchants of Great-Britain, being an object of im-  
portant conſideration to his majefty&#x27;s government, in arranging and diſ-  
cuſſing the terms of the treaty of peace, was expreſsly provided for in itz  
though ſtipulations of that nature are not uſual in treaties between inde-  
pendent nations; as the engagements of individuals of different countries  
are not liable to the intervention of partial local regulations, but reſt upon  
the ſaered and permanent bafis of univerſal juſtice, The magnitude of  
this object cannot᷑ therefore be better aſcertained, than by this circumſtance;  
ind accordingly a folemn and unequivocal ſtipulation was introduced into  
the treaty, That creditors on either fide ſhould meet with no lawful im-  
« pediment to the recovery of the full value, in ſterling money, of all  
* bona fide debts heretofore contracted; a ſtipulation as preciſe and  
definite as to the meaſure and mode of recovery and payment, as it was  
general and unqualified&#x27; in reſpect of the debts to be recovered. « The  
* full value in ſterling money” could only mean the value to be aſcer-  
tancd by the nature and terms of the original contract between debtor  
md creditor, and to be paid in ſterling money according to the rate of  
exchange prevailing between the two countries. All bona fide debts  
* heretofore contracted, comprehended every ſpecies of debt due to the  
creditors on either ſide, contrafted antecedent to, and which remained  
unpaid at, the period of concluding the treaty of peace.  
  
Hitherto Great Britain has anxiouſly, though in vain, expected from  
the United States, the fulfilment of this article, in behalf of her ſuffering  
merchants : But prohibitions of ſuits and perſonal diſabilities, created  
during the war, to commence actions, remained unrepealed, and have  
been protracted to periods ſubſequent to the peace. Acts too have paſſed  
ince the peace, ſuſpending, for a time, the recovery of debts, and the  
ifuing of executions. Courts have been authoriſed by law to direct and  
admit the reduction of intereſt ; and the abſolute reduction of intereſt, for  
«limited number of years, has been provided for. Laws which exiſted  
before the war, compelling the creditors to take the debtor&#x27;s land, at an  
ppraiſed value, remained unrepealed, notwithſtanding the change of cit-  
cumſtances in the two countries had, in ſome of the ſtate courts, tended  
  
  
an extent, applied to Britiſh ſubjects, as to inſpire doubts of their compe-  
tency to acquire or hold real property within the United States. New

valuation, real and perſonal property which bore no proportion to the  
value of the original debt, and for which they could command no price  
whatſoever, or of having the perſons of their debtors protected from  
arreſts, or diſcharged from executions. Britiſh ſubjects; and their agents,  
were compelled to give ſecurity to pay all juft debts due from the creditors  
to any citizen of the ſtate, as far as the amount of the debts to be col-  
lected, before any debtor could be compelled to make payment. Paper  
money emitted and made current, for a number of years, was conſtituted  
legal tender for payment and diſcharge of any debt, bargam or ſale, bond,  
mortgage, ſpecialty or contract whatſoever © already made or hereafter to  
be made, either for ferling money, ſilver money, dollars or any ſpecies  
of gold or ſilver. Inſtalment laws have paſſed, reſtraining, for a time,  
the commencement of ſuits, and then limiting the modes of recovering all  
debts due previous to the month of February 1782, and of obligations  
taken ſince that time for debts previouſly incurred; to three annual pay-  
ments, of one third of the principal and intereſt in each ſueceſſive year.  
Theſe reſtrictions and limitations were afterwards extended to all debts con-  
tracted previous to the xſt of January, 1787; and when theſe limitations,  
in which the Britiſh merchants moſt patiently and benevolently acqui-  
  
  
the period of payments five years longer, and reſtraining the reco-  
very even of bonds or notes, given payable according to the inſtalments  
preſcribed by the former acts, to the manner direfied in the laſt inſtal -  
ment law.  
  
Ir is worthy of obſervation, that this latter inſtalment law paſſed ſub-  
  
  
all treaties, made, or which ſhould be made, under the authority of the  
  
  
in each ſtate ſhould be bound thereby, and every ſenator and repreſenta-  
tive of the Unitcd States, members of the ſeveral ſtate legiſlatures, and all  
executive and judicial officers both of the United States and of the ſeveral  
ſtates, were to be bound by oath or affirmation to ſupport that conſtitution;  
3d. The laſt point of diſcuſſion relates to the decifions of ſtate courts  
upon queſtions affecting the rights of Britiſh ſubjects; in reſpett to which  
the diſpenfations of law have, for the moſt part, been as unpropitious to  
the ſubjects of the crown as the legiſlative acts of the different aſſemblies  
throughout this continent : It muſt however be allowed, that in one ſtate  
(Maſſachuſetts-Bay) where great property was at ſtake, juſtice has been  
liberally diſpenſed, and, notwithſtanding a particular regulation of the ſtate  
warranted the deduction of that portion of the intereſt on Britiſh debts  
7 which

„ es a EIS  
of the treaty, have admitted and directed the quantum of the demand to be  
regulated by the original contract; and where the contract bore intereſt, or  
the cuſtom of the trade juſtified the charge, the full intereſt has been al-  
owed to Britiſh creditors,. netwithſtanding the intervention of war. On  
the other hand it is to be lamented, that in a more diſtant ſtate (Georgia)  
it was a received principle, inculcated by an opinion of the higheſt judicial  
zuthority there, that as no legiſlative act of the ſtate exiſted, confirming the  
  
  
countries; a principle which may perhaps ſtill continue, in that ſtate, as  
it is one of thoſe that have not to this moment paid any municipal regard  
o the different recommendations of Congreſs, to the ps cock to  
repeal all laws inconſiſtent with the treaty of peace. |  
  
The decifions of the ſtate courts having affeCted the claims and perſons  
  
  
tant deciſions, under theſe two heads:  
  
iſt, In the proſecution of claims inſtiruted by Britiſh — for  
lebts contracted previous to the war, proof of the uſage of the trade to al-  
low intereſt after the expiration of a year on the amount of the goods ſhip-  
ped, or of the ſpecific contract between the debtor and creditor, has been  
uniformly eſtabliſhed, the full value of the debt to be recovered ought  
conſequently to have been nothing ſhort of the debt and intereſt according  
  
  
retion of many of the courts, juries have invariably abated intereſt on the  
Briciſh debts for ſeven years and a half, Even the folemnity of obligations  
has not deen found of ſafficient force to ſecure the creditor from this de-  
duction, it having been determined—that obligations, which on the face  
of the contract itſelf bore intereſt, were upon no better footing in this re-  
ſpect than book-debts, in which the intervention of war and the prohibi-  
tory reſolves of Congreſs were deemed ſufficient grounds to deſtroy the  
vlage between the Britiſh and American trader, by abating the intereſt for  
de period the war continued—and that as the debtor was deprived of the  
means of making payment, unleſs by a violation of a poſitive reſtrictive law,  
prohibiting remittances as a means of ſtrengthening the enemy, and as it  
would have been criminal to have remitted during the war, no man ſhould  
ſuffer for his obedience to the laws, or be anſwerable for the intereſt, while  
the laws of the land reftrained him from remitting the principal. The  
treaty of peace too, has been conſidered as having no effect upon this queſ-  
tion, it having been held that the treaty only ſecured the mutual recovery  
of debts, when the amount was aſcertained; but the amount of the debts  
vas to be ſettled by the laws of the land.

In ope ſtate particularly, in which the claim of intereſt has been gene ·  
rally involved in the recovery of Britiſh debts, that had been paid in con-  
ſequence of legiſlative acts into the ſtate treaſury, the ſuperior court of the  
ſtate determined, that the conſtruction of the treaty, and the acts of che  
Rate, entitled the creditor to recover the principal of his debt, and all in-  
tereſt thereon, which had not ariſen during the war; and that, as by the  
intervention of war the means of recovering Britiſh debts were ſuſpended,  
the claim of intereſt, during the ſuſpenſion, was inadmiſſible.  
It was admitted, that notwithſtanding the payments into the treaſury,  
the treaty of peace reſtored the right of action; but intereſt was recoverable  
only from the date of the definitive treaty.  
  
  
ſiderable amount are depending, the ſuits that have been inſtituted for  
their recovery have been referred to the diſtrit courts of the ſtate; and  
  
  
tinuance upon the records, have been adjourned, for difficulty, to the  
general court, wherein they ſtill remain undecided, and others, it is faid,  
have been actually diſmiſſed. The delay of juſtice, operating equally as a  
denial of juſtice, would have been effectually reformed in that ſtate, by  
the proviſions of a particular law, giving ſummary relief in determining  
diſputes wherein ſubjects of thoſe countries which had acknowledged, or  
ſhould hereafter recognize the independence of -the United States, were  
parties againſt the citizens of that ſtate ; but unfortunately for the Britiſh  
creditors, upon the concluſion of peace, it was ſoon found that this ſum-  
mary relief extended to Britiſh debts in common with the claims of other  
Foreigners, whoſe ſovereigns had recognized the independence of the  
United States, and that ſome of the judges favoured the idea; and ſo muchot  
  
  
Foreigners were partics, was repealed, and, at this moment, the means  
of recovery depend ſolely upon limitations and conditions created by local  
regulations, which arc in direct oppoſition to the recommendatory reſolves  
of Congreſs, and palpable infrattions of the fourth article of the treaty of  
Peace.  
  
The few attempts to recover Britiſh debts in the county courts of  
that. ſtate, have univerſally failed ; and theſe are the courts wherein,  
from the ſmallneſs of the ſum, a conſiderable number of debts can only be  
recovered,  
  
A farther hardſhip, under which the Britiſh creditors labour, is that  
they are anſwerable, and proceeded againſt by courſe of law, for every  
claim brought againſt them; when at this moment it is not a ſertled  
  
point, u hether even the federal court, in that diſtrict, will entertain in  
their

of the United States, after very ſolemn argument, having adjourned the  
queſtion,  
In addition to theſe obſervations, it is een mention, that in forme  
  
  
recovery of a Britiſh debt in their courts, though ſo many years have ex-  
pired ſince the eſtabliſhment of peace between the two countries,  
  
2d. The proceedings of the State Courts, upon points which affected the  
perſons of Britiſh ſubjeAs, have been equally repugnant to the terms of  
the treaty, In one ſtate, ſuits have been inſtituted under the acts for  
granting a more effectual relief in caſes of certain treſpaſſes, for the reco-  
very of damages reſulting from the occupancy of eſtates, held in diſtricts  
  
  
from the commanders in chief ; and though the licence and permiſſion  
were pleaded, and it was ſtated upon the record, that after the declaration  
of independence by Congreſs, there was open war between the two coun-  
  
  
occupied under ſuch licence and permiſſion, and as long as the ſame re ·  
manned in force—that, by the treaty of peace, the claim which the ſubjects  
or citizens of either of the contracting parties had to recompence or retri-  
  
  
war, were mutually relinquiſhed and releaſed—that the parties, againſt  
whom the ſuits were inſtituted, were ſubjects of the crown, reſiding in a  
diſtrict occupied by the royal army, where the- eſtate in queſtion was  
ftuated, under the protection of the king, then at war with this country;  
theſe pleas were over-ruled by the court, as inſufficient; and damages  
have been awarded againſt the parties for the time the eſtates were ſo  
cccupied by them, to the great injury of numbers who had, during the  
  
  
the authority of the commander in chief.  
  
In another ſtate, an indictment has lately been preferred againſt a ſub-  
ect of the crown, for the murder of a citizen of the United States, found  
under ſuſpicious circumſtances, within the royal lines. Though the grand  
wry did not find the bill of indictment againſt the party, as the facts  
z/lcged were not ſufficiently proved, they poſtponed a farther enquiry to  
2 future time, to give the proſecutor an opportunity of producing farther  
teſtimony, in which the court acquieſced, and refuſed to diſcharge the pri-  
ſoner, obſerving, when the counſel moved for his diſcharge, that the com-  
miflion for holding the court of oyer and terminer did not expire for ſome  
  
months, and the court would again fit before the period expired. The

C. oo, and two ſureties in C. 250 each; but as his friends doubted the  
diſpoſition of the court to determine according to the terms of the treaty,  
they thought it more prudent to ſuffer the forfeiture of the recognizances,  
than to put his life again into jeopardy.  
  
In that ſtate alſo, actions of treſpaſs have been inſtituted, for taking and  
driving off cattle during the war, converting indictable offences into civil  
fuits, with a view of eluding the ſtipulations of the treaty ; but with what  
ſucceſs, has not been aſcertained. |  
  
Upon this laſt head of arrangement, it is caly &quot;neceſſary farther to  
obſerve, that the proſecutions, in the caſes ſpecified, are all direct and  
poſitive violations of the 6th article of the treaty of peace.  
  
From the foregoing detail it is evident, that the recommendations of  
Congreſs to the reſpective ſtate legiſlatures have, in ſome of the ſtates,  
been totally diſregarded, and in none have produced that complere and  
extenſive effect which Great Britain, from the ſtipulations of the treaty,  
was perfectly juſtifiable in expecting and requiring—that ſince the peace,  
many of the ſtates have paſſed laws in direct contravention of the defini-  
tive treaty, and eſſentially injurious to the eſtates, rights and properties of  
Britiſh ſubjects, in whoſe favour preciſe diſtinctions were clearly defined  
and expreſſed in the treaty —that although ſome of the ſtates may have  
repcaled their exceptionable laws partially or generally, yet, in a majority  
of the ſtates, they ſtill exiſt in full force and validity—and that in ſome  
of the ſtate courts, actions have been commenced and proſecuted with fuc-  
ceſs againſt individuals, for the part they had taken in the war; which  
actions were, in their origin, poſitive contraventions of the 6th article of  
the treaty, and, in their conſequences, materially detrimental to the rights  
  
  
quence of the violation of the treaty in theſe particulars, great numbers  
of his majeſty&#x27;s ſubjefts have been reduced ro a flate of penury and  
  
  
to them, of no leſs a ſum than four millions ſterling, 25 4 partial Wr  
tion ſor the loſſes they had ſuſtained.  
  
It is further manifeſt, that the ſlipulation in the 4th article of the  
treaty, which provides for the recovery of the debts due to the ſubjects of  
the two countries reſpectixely, has been not only evaded in many of the  
Kates, but that municipal regulations have been eſtabliſhed in them, u  
2vowed contravention of it—And that, in many inftances, rhe means and  
proſpect of obtaining redreſs are nearly as remote as ever; ſince, in ore  
ſtate, in which a ſum far exceeding one million ſterling is fil] due to  
Britiſh creditors, the ſupreme edere: court has thought proper to ſul-

by a Britiſh creditor; and ſince, in the ſame ftate, the county courts  
  
  
formly rejected all ſuĩts inſtituted for the recovery of ſums due to the ſub-  
ects of the crown of Great-Britain.  
  
The delay which has ariſen in the adminiftration of juſtice, han with  
  
  
For, by the effect of that delay, many deſcriptions of his majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects  
have been expoſed, not only to material inconvenience, but, in various  
caſes, to the ruin and abſolute loſs of their property.  
  
The conduct of Great-Britain, in all theſe reſpects, has been widely  
4fſerent from that which has been obſerved by the United States. In the  
  
  
cnacting regulations which might invalidate a national compact, or affect  
the ſacred tenor of engagements contracted between individuals. And in  
the courts of law, the citizens of the United States have experienced,  
  
  
juſtice as the ſubjects of the crown. Examples can be adduced, of judg-  
  
  
ſeized by legiſlative aQs of the ſtates in which it was ſituated, and appro-  
priated, in the firſt inſtance, to the liquidation of the very deſcription  
of debts for which theſe ſuits were commenced againſt them in England.  
Such is the nature of the ſpecific facts which the king, my maſter, has  
conſidered as infractions of the treaty on the part of the United States, and  
:n conſequence of which his majeſty has deemed it expedient to ſuſpend  
the full execution, on his part, of the 7th article of that treaty. On this  
head alſo, it is neceſſary to premiſe the following evident diſtinction:  
That the king has contented himſelf with a mere ſuſpenſion of that  
miele of the treaty; whereas the United States have not only withheld  
  
  
e terms of the treaty, but alſo many of the ſtates have, ſubſequentto the  
peace, paſſed new legiſlative regulations in violation of the treaty, and  
mpoſing additional hardſhips on individuals, whom the national faith of  
de United States was pledged, under preciſe and ſolemn ſtipulations, to  
inſure and protect from future injury.  
  
On the grounds, therefore, of the irreparable injury which many claſſes  
of his ſubjects have ſuſtained, and of the heavy expence to which the  
Britiſh nation has been ſubjected by the non-performance of their engage»  
ments on the part of the United States, the meaſure that the king has  
  
  
perfectly

the treaty which have not becn executed by the two countries reſpectively,

Soon another recommendation appeared concerning the  
property of those who had abandoned their allegiance to the  
States and passed over to the enemy. The property of all  
such persons, it was recommended, should be confiscated and  
the proceeds invested in loan-office certificates, which were  
to be appropriated as the States should direct. The recom-  
mendation was heeded, and all the States, during some  
period of the war, passed acts to confiscate and sell the  
property of loyalists, applying the avails in redeeming certif-  
icates and bills of credit, or paying other expenses incurred  
through the conflict with Great Britain. The debtors, also, of  
British creditors were enabled to discharge their debts by  
paying into the State treasuries or loan offices paper money  
in fulfillment of their obligations. “Under some of these  
laws,” says Schuckers, “many individuals were attainted by  
name; others were banished forever from the country, and  
if found within the State were declared felons without benefit  
of clergy. In some States the estates and rights of married  
women, of widows and minors, and of persons who had died  
within the territories possessed by the British, were forfeited.  
In New York the Courts were enjoined to prefer bills of  
indictment against persons, alive or dead, who had adhered  
to the King, or joined his fleets or armies, and who were  
the owners or claimants of property. In some States confis-  
cated property was applied to other than war purposes; i
