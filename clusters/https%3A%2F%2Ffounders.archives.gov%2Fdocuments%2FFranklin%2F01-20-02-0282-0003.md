Boston, August 1768.  
It is very necessary other information should be had in England of the present state of the commissioners of the customs than what common fame will bring to you or what you will receive from most of the letters which go from hence, people in general being prejudiced by many false reports and misrepresentations concerning them. Seven eighths of the people of the country suppose the board itself to be unconstitutional and cannot be undeceived and brought to believe that a board has existed in England all this century, and that the board established here has no new powers given to it. Our incendiaries know it but they industriously and very wickedly publish the contrary. As much pains has been taken to prejudice the country against the persons of the commissioners and their characters have been misrepresented and cruelly treated especially since their confinement at the castle where they are not so likely to hear what is said of them and are not so able to confute it.  
It is not pretended they need not to have withdrawn, that Mr. Williams had stood his ground without any injury although the mob beset his house, &amp;c. There never was that spirit raised against the under officers as against the commissioners, I mean four of them. They had a public affront offered them by the town of Boston who refused to give the use of their hall for a public dinner unless it was stipulated that the commissioners should not be invited. An affront of the same nature at the motion of Mr. Hancock was offered by a company of cadets. Soon after a vessel of Mr. Hancock’s being seized the officers were mobb’d and the commissioners were informed they were threatned. I own I was in pain for them. I do not believe if the mob had seized them, there was any authority able and willing to have rescued them. After they had withdrawn the town signified to the governor by a message that it was expected or desired they should not return. It was then the general voice that it would not be safe for them to return. After all this the sons of liberty say they deserted or abdicated.  
The other officers of the customs in general either did not leave the town or soon returned to it. Some of them seem to be discontented with the commissioners. Great pains have been taken to increase the discontent. Their office by these means is rendered extremely burdensome. Every thing they do is found fault with, and yet no particular illegality or even irregularity mentioned. There is too much hauteur some of their officers say in the treatment they receive. They say they treat their officers as the commissioners treat their officers in England and require no greater deference. After all it is not the persons but the office of the commissioners which has raised this spirit, and the distinction made between the commissioners is because it has been given out that four of them were in favor of the new establishment and the fifth was not. If Mr. Hallowell arrived safe he can inform you many circumstances relative to this distinction which I very willingly excuse myself from mentioning.  
I know of no burden brought upon the fair trader by the new establishment. The illicit trader finds the risque greater than it used to be, especially in the port where the board is constantly held. Another circumstance which increases the prejudice is this; the new duties happened to take place just about the time the commissioners arrived. People have absurdly connected the duties and board of commissioners, and suppose we should have had no additional duties if there had been no board to have the charge of collecting them. With all the aid you can give to the officers of the crown they will have enough to do to maintain the authority of government and to carry the laws into execution. If they are discountenanced, neglected or fail of support from you, they must submit to every thing the present opposers of government think fit to require of them.  
There is no office under greater discouragements than that of the commissioners. Some of my friends recommended me to the ministry. I think myself very happy that I am not one. Indeed it would have been incompatible with my post as chief justice, and I must have declined it, and I should do it although no greater salary had been affixed to the chief justices place than the small pittance allowed by the province.  
From my acquaintance with the commissioners I have conceived a personal esteem for them, but my chief inducement to make this representation to you is in regard to the public interest which I am sure will suffer if the opposition carry their point against them. I am with very great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,   
Tho. Hutchinson.  
  
August 10. Yesterday at a meeting of the merchants it was agreed by all present to give no more orders for goods from England, nor receive any on commission until the late acts are repealed. And it is said all except sixteen in the town have subscribed an engagement of that tenor. I hope the subscription will be printed that I may transmit it to you

I know of no burden brought upon the fair

trader finds the riſque greater than it uſed to be,  
eſpecially in the port where the board is con-

creaſes the prejudice is this; the new duties hap»  
pened to take place juſt about rhe time the com-  
miſſioners arrived. People have abſurdly con-  
nected the duties and board of commiſſoners,  
and ſuppoſe we ſnould have had no addirjo;:al

It is now pretended they need not to

though the mob befet his houfe, &amp;e.  
There never was that fpirit raifed agaiuft

of bofton, who refufed to give the life of  
tluiv liall for a public dinner unlefs it was  
ftipnlated that the commifthiners lliould

After they had witlulrawn, the town fig-

After all, it is not the perfons, but the  
ofiiee of the comminioners which has  
raifed this fpirit; and the diftimftion made  
between the eommiftioners is, becaufc it

I know of no burthen brought upon

ft he illicit trader finds the rilk greate;*  
tl:an it ufed to be, efj)eeially in the port  
w here the board is eonftantly held. An¬

Bojion, Augtifi 176s#  
  
SIR,  
  
“ IT is very nectfl&#x27;ary other informa¬  
tion fliould be had in England of the .  
prefent date of the coinmiflioncrs of the  
cudonib than what common fame will  
bring to you, or what you will receive  
from mod of the letters which go trom  
hence, people, in general, being preju¬  
diced bymanyfalfe reports and mific-  
preientations concerning them. Seven  
eighthi&gt;of the people of thecvmntry lup-  
pofe the board ilfclf to be unconditu-  
tional, and cannot be undeccivtd and  
brought to believe that a board has  
cxided in England all this century; and  
that the hoard edablilhrd here has no  
new&#x27; powers given to it Our incen¬  
diaries know it, but they indudtioully  
and very wickedly pubiifh the,contrary.  
  
much pains has been taken to preju¬  
dice the connlry againd the perfons of  
the contmifl&#x27;i mers, and their charaifler*  
have been mifieprefcnted and cruelly  
treated, efpecially tince thtir confine¬  
ment at the cadlc, where they aie not  
fo likely to hear what is faid of them,  
and arc not fo able to confute it.  
  
“ It is now pretended they need not  
to have withdraw-n; that Mr Williams  
had flood his ground without injury, al¬  
though the mob bcict his honk, &amp;c.  
There never was that fpirit raifed againd:  
the under oflicers againfl the commif-  
fioners, I mean four of them. They  
had a public affront offered them by the  
tow&#x27;n of B&#x27;ifton, who refuted tt&gt; give the  
ufe of their hall for a public dinner, un-  
lefs it was flipulated that the cvimmif-  
lioners fhould not be invited. An af-  
fiont of the lame nature, at the motion  
of Mr Hanc ck, tvas «ffered by a com¬  
pany of cadets. Sorm after, a vcflcl of  
M: Hancock’s being feized, the &lt; fficers •  
were mobbed, and the commiflioncrs  
Were informed they were threatened. I  
ow&#x27;n I was in pain for them. * I do not  
believe, if the mob had feized them,  
&#x27;there w&#x27;as any authority able and willing  
to have relcucd them. After they had  
withdrawn, the town fignified to the  
g &gt;vcrhor, by a meffage, that it was tx-  
p.dled, or defired, they flioidd not re¬  
turn. It was then the general *voicc,  
that it would not be fafe for them fo re¬  
turn. After all this, the fons of liberty  
fay they deferted or abdicated.  
  
“ The other officers of the cuflom*,  
in general, either did not leave the lowni  
  
or foon iTturnci to it. Some of th^m  
frem to be difeuntented uiih thccom-  
jn^CTioncrs. Gt cAl pains have been taken  
to iiKircai’e the diKx»nUnt. Their oface,  
by thefe means, is rendered extremely  
burdenfomc. Every thing they do is  
found fsuil with, and yet no p^rlicnlsr  
illcj^i^ity, or even irregularity, incnti*&gt;rj-  
ed. There is too much hautetir, lorrr  
of their olEcers fay, in the treatment  
tl&#x27;.ry receive. They fay they treat their  
c).T»cer» a» the commillioncrs treat their  
&lt;»diccrs in England, and require no  
|;rcater deference. After all, it is not  
the perfons, but the i lEec of thecom-  
miiiioners which has raifed this fpirit;  
and the diftinftion made beuvecn the  
commifii^uirs is, bccaufc it has been  
given oi*t that four cf them were in fa¬  
vour of the new eftabliftiment, and the  
fifth was m»t. If Mr Hallowell arrived  
fafe, he can infirm yon of manycircuin-  
ftiaees relative to thi&quot;* diftindtion, which  
J very willingly cxcufc mylclf horn men¬  
tioning.  
  
“ I kne w’ cf no burden broueht upon  
the fair trader by the new cRabliihment.  
The illicit tiader fiiuU the rilk greater  
than it uftd to be, eipeciaMy in the port  
where the hoaid conftanily held. Ati-  
othfT circumftancc which increaies the  
prejudice is this: The ne&#x27;’&lt;» duties hap-  
ptiUil t&lt;* »ike p!/icc juft about I’.jc time  
the coinmifTioners arrived. People have  
.-ihrurdly c*&gt;nr^ccted the duties and Uiard  
of COmmifioners, and foppofe we flio»»td  
f^ave k.id no additional duties if there  
J:.id l&gt;cen in) board to have the charge of  
colleiSing them. With ail the aid you  
*-aii give til it»e ofTicer* of the crown,  
they w ill have enough to do to maintain  
tne authoiity of government, and tocar-  
yy the hws i.nto execution. Jf they arc  
&lt;?irc&#x27;jiintenar.ced, ncgleftcd, or fail of  
fnpport frem you, they mufl fnh.nit to  
every thieg the prefent oppofrrs of oo-  
vrrnment think fit to require of them.  
  
“ I&#x27;here is no ufiiLe under greater  
difeonragements than fhtt of the coni-  
inifTioncrs. Some of my friends recom¬  
mended me to the minii&#x27;ry. 1 think iny-  
felf very happy that I am not one. In¬  
deed it w’ould have Keen incompatible  
with any poft *5 chief jnftice, and I mutt  
have declined it, and 1 fhould do it al¬

81 R, Boſton, Auguſt 1768.  
TT is very neceſſary other information ſhoutd be had in  
England of the pretent ſtate of the commiſſioners of the  
cuſtoms than what common fame will bring to you, or  
| what you will receive from moſt of the letters which go  
from hence, people in general being prejudiced by many falſe  
reports and miſrepreſentations concerning them. Seven  
eighths of the people of the country ſuppoſe the board it-  
  
  
brought to believe that a board has exiſted in England all  
this century, and that the board eſtabliſhed here has no  
new powers given to it. Our incerdiaries know it, but  
they induftriouſly and very wickedly publiſh the contrary.  
As much pains has been taken to prejudice the country  
| agairſt the perſons of the commiſſioners, and their cha-  
racters have been miſrepreſented and cruelly treated,  
eſpecially ſince their confinement at the Caſtle, where they  
are not fo likely to hear what is ſaid of them, and are not  
  
  
It is now pretended they need not to have was,  
that Mr. Williams had ſtood his ground without any injury  
although the mob beſet his houſe, &amp;c. There never was  
that ſpirit raiſed againſt the under officers as againſt the  
commiſſioners, I mean four of them. They had a public  
affront offered them by the town of Boſton, who refuſed  
to give the uſe of their hall for a public dinner, unleſs it  
was ſtipulated that the commiſſioners ſhould not be invited.  
An affront of the ſame nature at the motion of Mr. Han-  
cock was offered by a company of cadets. Soon afrer a  
| veſſel of Mr. Hancock&#x27;s being ſeized, the officers were  
mobb&#x27;d, and the commiſſioners were informed they were  
  
  
lieve if the mob had ſeized them, there was any authority  
able and willing to have reſcued them. After they had  
withdrawn, the town ſignified to the Governor by a meſ-  
ſage that | it was expected or deſired they ſhould not return.  
  
A  
It was then the general voice that it would not be ſafe for  
them to return. Atter all this, the ſons of liberty ſay, wy  
  
deſerted or abdicated.  
The other officers of the cuſtoms in &quot;general either did not  
  
leave the town, or ſoon returned to it. Some of them ſeem _  
to be diſcontented with the commiſſioners. Great pains  
have been taken to increaſe the diſcontent. Their office  
| by thele means is rendered extremely burdenſome. Every  
thing they do is found fault with, and yet no particular il-  
  
| legality or even irregularity mentioned. There is too much  
  
bautcur, ſome of their officers ſay, in the treatment they  
  
  
miſſioners treat their officers in England, and require no  
greater deference. After all, it is not the perſons, but the  
office of the commiſſioners which has raiſed this ſpirit,  
and the diſtinction made between the commiſſioners, is be-  
cauſe it has-been given out that four of them were in fa-  
vour of the new eſtabliſhment, and the fifth was nat. If  
Mr. Hallowell arived fafe, he can inform you many cir-  
cumſtances relative to this diſtinction, which 1 very wil-  
| lingly excuſe myſelf from mentioning,  
I know of no burden brought upon the fair trades by the  
new eſtabliſhment. The illicit trader finds the riſque  
greater than it uſed to be, eſpecially in the port where the  
board 1s conſtantly held. Another circumſtance which in-  
creaſes the prejudice is this; the new duties happened to take  
place juſt about the time the Commiſſioners arrived. Peo-  
ple have abſurdly connected the duties and board of Com-  
miſſioners, and ſuppoſe we ſhould have had no additional  
  
  
collecting them. With all the aid you can give to the  
officers of the crown, they will have enough to do to main-  
  
| tain the authority of government, and to carry the laws in-  
to execution. If: they are diſcountenanced, neglected, or |  
fail of ſupport from you, they mult ſubmit to every thing  
the  
  
EF A  
the preſent oppoſers of — think fit to require of  
them.  
| There is no office under greater diſcouragements than  
that of the Commiſſioners. Some of my friends recom-  
5 mended me to the miniſtry. I think myſelf very happy  
76 that I am not one. Indeed it would have been incompati-  
ble with my poſt as chief juſtice, and I muſt have declined  
it. and J ſhould do it although no greater ſalary had been  
_ affixed to the chief juſtice&quot; $ place, than the ſmall Pittance _
