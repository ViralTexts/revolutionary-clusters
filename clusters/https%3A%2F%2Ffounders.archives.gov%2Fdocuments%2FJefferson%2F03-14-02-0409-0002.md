In the spring of 1775, the leading characters of Mecklenburg county, stimulated by the enthusiastic patriotism which elevates the mind above considerations of individual aggrandisement and scorning to shelter themselves from the impending storm, by submission to lawless power, &amp;c. &amp;c. held several detached meetings, in each of which the individual sentiments were, “that the cause of Boston was the cause of all; that their destinies were indissolubly connected with those of their eastern fellow citizens; and that they must either submit to all the impositions which an unprincipled, and to them an unrepresented, parliament, might impose, or support their brethren who were doomed to sustain the first shock of that power, which, if successful there, would ultimately overwhelm all in the common calamity.” Conformably to these principles, Col. Adam Alexander, through solicitation, issued an order to each Captain’s Company in the county of Mecklenburg, (then comprising the present county of Cabarrus) directing each militia company to elect two persons, and delegate to them ample power to devise ways and means to aid and assist their suffering brethren in Boston, and also generally to adopt measures to extricate themselves from the impending storm, and to secure, unimpaired, their inalienable rights, privileges and liberties from the dominant grasp of British imposition and tyranny.  
In conforming to said Order, on the 19th of May, 1775, the said delegation met in Charlotte, vested with unlimited powers; at which time official news, by express, arrived of the battle of Lexington on that day of the preceding month. Every delegate felt the value and importance of the prize, &amp; the awful and solemn crisis which had arrived—every bosom swelled with indignation at the malice, inveteracy, and insatiable revenge developed in the late attack at Lexington. The universal sentiment was—let us not flatter ourselves that popular harangues or resolves; that popular vapour will avert the storm, or vanquish our common enemy—let us deliberate—let us calculate the issue—the probable result: and then let us act with energy as brethren leagued to preserve our property—our lives—and what is still more endearing, the liberties of America.—Abraham Alexander was then elected Chairman, and John M’Knitt Alexander, Clerk. After a free and full discussion of the various objects for which the delegation had been convened, it was unanimously Ordained—  
1. Resolved, That whosoever directly or indirectly abetted, or in any way, form, or manner, countenanced, the unchartered and dangerous invasion of our rights, as claimed by Great Britain, is an enemy to this country,—to America,—and to the inherent and inalienable rights of man.  
2. Resolved, That we, the citizens of Mecklenburg county, do hereby dissolve the political bands which have connected us to the Mother Country, and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British Crown, and abjure all political connection, contract, or association with that Nation, who have wantonly trampled on our rights and liberties—and inhumanly shed the innocent blood of American patriots at Lexington.  
3. Resolved, That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and independent people; are, and of right ought to be, a sovereign &amp; self governing association, under the control of no power other than that of our God and the General Government of the Congress; to the maintenance of which independence, we solemnly pledge to each other our mutual co-operation, our lives, our fortunes, &amp; our most sacred honor.  
4. Resolved, That as we now acknowledge the existence and control of no law or legal officer, civil or military, within this county, we do hereby ordain and adopt, as a rule of life, all, each, and every of our former laws—wherein, nevertheless, the crown of Great Britain never can be considered as holding rights, privileges, immunities, or authority therein.  
5. Resolved That it is also further decreed, that all, each, and every military officer in this county is hereby reinstated to his former command and authority, he acting conformably to these regulations.—And that every member present of this delegation shall henceforth be a civil officer, viz. a Justice of the Peace, in the character of a ‘Committee man,’ to issue process, hear and determine all matters of controversy, according to said adopted laws, and to preserve peace and union, and harmony, in said county; and to use every exertion to spread the love of country and fire of freedom throughout America, until a more general and organized government be established in this province.  
A number of by-laws were also added, merely to protect the association from confusion and to regulate their general conduct as citizens. After sitting in the courthouse all night, neither sleepy, hungry, or fatigued, and after discussing every paragraph, they were all passed, sanctioned, and decreed, unanimously, about 2 o’clock, A. M. May 20. In a few days, a deputation of said delegation convened, when capt. James Jack, of Charlotte, was deputed as express to the Congress at Philadelphia, with a copy of said resolves and proceedings, together with a letter addressed to our three representatives, viz. Richard Caswell, William Hooper, and Joseph Hughes, under express injunction, personally, and through the state representation, to use all possible means to have said proceedings sanctioned and approved by the general Congress. On the return of captain Jack, the delegation learned that their proceedings were individually approved by the members of Congress, but that it was deemed premature to lay them before the house. A joint letter from said three members of Congress was also received, complimentary of the zeal in the common cause, and recommending perseverance, order, and energy.  
The subsequent harmony, unanimity, and exertion in the cause of liberty and independence, evidently resulting from these regulations, and the continued exertions of said delegation, apparently tranquillized this section of the state, and met with the concurrence and high approbation of the Council of Safety, who held their sessions at Newbern and Wilmington, alternately, and who confirmed the nomination and acts of the delegation in their official capacity.  
From this delegation originated the Court of Enquiry of this county, who constituted and held their first session in Charlotte; they then held their meetings regularly at Charlotte, at col. James Harris’s, and at col. Phifer’s, alternately, one week at each place. It was a civil court founded on military process. Before this judicature all suspicious persons were made to appear, who were formally tried, and banished or continued under guard. Its jurisdiction was as unlimited as toryism, and its decrees as final as the confidence and patriotism of the county. Several were arrested and brought before them from Lincoln, Rowan, and the adjacent counties.

SHORT NARRTIVE.  
. In thspnng of 1775, the leading diame­  
ters of Mecklenbu-g county, North Carolina,

which elevates the mind above considerations

imnnsa-or suDDort thfir brethren wno were  
doomed to sustain the first shock of that pow  
er, which, if successful there, would ultimate  
ly overwhelm all in-the common calamity.&quot;  
Conformably to thej-e priuciple, ; Colonel Ti  
Polk, through solicitation, issued an order to  
each captain&#x27;s &#x27; company in the. county of  
Mecklenburg, (then comprising the- present  
county of Cabarrus. directing each militia  
company to elect two persons., and delpgate  
to them ample power to devise ways and  
means to aid and assist their surienng bretn  
ren in -Boston, and also generally to adop  
measures to extricate themselves fiem the irn  
pending storm, and to secure unimpaired  
their inalienable rights, privileges and liber  
ties, from the dominant eraso ol British irn  
position and tyranny-  
In conformity to said order, on the 19th o  
May, 1775, the said delegation met in Char  
lotte, vested with unlimited powers; at which  
time official news, by express, arrived cf the  
battle of Lexington on that day of the preced­  
ing month. Eve; y ; delegate felt the value  
and importance of the prize, and the awful  
and solemn crisis-which had arrived every  
bosom swelled with indignation at the malice,  
inveteracy, and insatiable revenge, developed  
in the late attack atXexington. The univer­  
sal sentiment was: let us not flatter ourselves  
that popular harangues, or resolves, that pop­  
ular vapor will avert the storm, or vanquish  
our common enemy let us deliberate let  
us calculate the issue the probable result ;  
and then let us act with energy.asa byethren

( A number of by-laws were also added,  
merely to protect the association from confu­  
sion, and to regulate their general conduct as  
citfzsr.f. Aftr sitting in the court house all  
night, neither sleepy, hungry, nor fatigued,  
and after discussing every paragraph, they  
were ail passed, sanctioned, and decreed,  
iinajiimously, about 2 o&#x27;clock, A. M., May 20.  
In afew days, a deputation of said delegation  
convened, when Capt. James Jack, of Char­  
lotte, was deputed as express to the congress  
at Philadelphia, with a copy of said resolves  
and proceedings, together with a letter ad­  
dressed to our three representatives there, viz:  
Richard Caswell, William Hooper, and  
JosErH Hewes under express injunction  
personally, and through the Slate representa­  
tion, to use all possible means to have said  
proceedings sanctioned and approved by the  
genera  
congress.  
On the return of Captain  
Jack, the delegation learned that their pro-  
ceeaings were maiviauaiiy approved by the  
members of congress, but that it was deemed  
premature to lay them before the house. A  
joint letter from said three members of con  
gress was also received, complimentary of the  
zeal in the common cause, and recommend­  
ing perseverance, order and energy.  
The subsequent harmony, unanimity, and  
exertion in the cause of liberty and independ­  
ence, evidently resultingirom these regula­  
tions, and the continued exertion of said dele­  
gation, apparently tranquilizcd this section of  
the State, and met with the concurrence and  
high approbation of the council of safety,who  
held their sessions at New Berne and Wil­  
mington, alternately, and who confirmed the  
nominations and acts of the delegation m their  
official capacity. !  
From this delegation originated the court  
of inquiry 6fthis county, who constituted and  
held their first session in Charlolfe-they then  
held their meetings regularly at Charlotte, at  
LOl. James Harris s, and at Col. Phifer&#x27;s, al  
ternatelv, one week at each nlace - It was a  
civil court founded on military proce. Be-

made to appear, who were formally tried and  
banished, or continued under uard. lis

County held several detached meetings, in which the sentiment  
was freely expressed that ‘‘ the cause of Boston was the cause  
of all,” and that the first shock of British power in its en-  
croachments on American liberty, if not resisted there, would  
ultimately overwhelm the people of the whole continent in a  
common calamity. In this state of public sentiment, and  
moved, it is said, by the solicitations of others, Colonel Thomas  
Polk, the commanding officer of the Mecklenburg militia,

invasion of our rights, as claimed by Great Britain, is an enemy to  
this country, to America, and to the inherent and inalienable rights  
of man.  
  
“ Resolved, That we, the citizens of Mecklenburg County, do hereby  
dissolve the political bonds which have connected us to the mother  
country, and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the  
British crown, and abjure all political connection, contract, or asso-  
ciation with that nation, who have wantonly trampled on our rights  
and liberties, and inhumanly shed the blood of American patriots at  
Lexington.  
  
“ Resolved, That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and indepen-  
dent people, and of right ought to be a sovereign and self-governing  
association, under the control of no power other than that of our  
God and the general government of the Congress ; to the mainte-  
nance of which independence we solemnly pledge to each other our  
mutual co-operation, our lives, our fortunes, and our most sacred  
honor.  
  
“ Resolved, That as we now acknowledge the existence and control of  
no law, or legal officer, civil or military, within the county, we do  
hereby‘ordaim and adopt as a rule of life, all, each, and every of our  
former laws, wherein, nevertheless, the crown of Great Britain never  
an be considered as holding rights, privileges, and immunities or  
authorities therein.  
  
“ Resolved, That it is further decreed, that all, each, and every mili-  
tary officer in this county is hereby reinstated in his former com-  
mand and authority, he acting conformably to these . regulations,  
And that every member present of this delegation shall henceforth

“ committee-man,” to issue process, hear and determine all matters of  
controversy, according to said adopted laws, and to preserve peace,

night of the 19th, and indeed it was not until two o’clock in  
the morning of the 20th of May that the work of the conven-

A few days afterwards, proceeds the chronicler (still pur-

Charlotte, was deputed as a messenger to convey a copy of  
these resolves and proceedings to the Continental Congress  
then sitting in Philadelphia, as also to deliver a letter addressed  
to the North Carolina members in that body, — Messrs. Rich-  
ard Caswell, William Hooper, and Joseph Hewes, — request-  
ing them “ to use all possible means to have the said proceed-  
ings sanctioned and approved by the general Congress.” On  
the return of Captain Jack, says the compiler of these annals,  
still professing to write under the date of the alleged Decla-  
ration, he reported that the proceedings were “ individually  
approved by the members of Congress, but that it was deemed

The nutwequent harmony, una­

resulting from these regulations and  
the coimuued exertions of said dele­

to accept it unquestionably, it the celebra­

linians an easy credulity is certainly to be  
recommended to them.

rectly abetted, nr in any way, form, or mauuer  
countenanced the unchartered and dangerous  
invasion of our rights, as claimed by Great  
Britain, is au enemy to this country, to

bands which have connected us to the Mother  
Country, and hereby absolve ourselves (rom all  
allegiance to the British Crown, and abjure all  
political connection, contract or association  
with that nation, who have wantonly trampled  
on our rights and liberties, and iubumauly shed  
the blood of American patriots at Lexington.

right ought to be, a sovereign and self-goveru­

government of the Congress; to the maintenance  
of which independence we solemnly pledge to  
each other our mutual co-operation, our lives,  
our tortuues, aud our most sacred honor.  
Resolved, That as we now acknowledge the  
existence and control of no law or legal officer,  
civil or military, within this comity, we do  
hereby ordain aud adopt as a rule of life, all,  
each and every of our former laws, wherein,  
nevertheless, the Crown of Great Britain never  
cau be considered as holding lights, privileges,  
immunities, or authority therein.

ings were held during the spring of  
1775, in which the leading characters of  
Mecklenburg resolved, among other  
things, “ that the cause of Boston was  
the cause of all; that their destinies  
were indissolubly connected wtth tho-e  
of their Eastern fellow-citizens, and  
that they must either submit to all the  
impositions which an unprincipled  
and to them an unrepresented, Parlia­  
ment might impose, or support their  
brethren who were doomed to sustain  
the first shock of that power, which,  
if successful then, could ultimately  
overwhelm all in the common calami­  
ty.&#x27;’ In one of these patriotic confer­  
ences Colonel Thomas Polk, an ances­  
tor of President James K. Polk, was  
requested to issue an order to each  
captain’s company in the county of  
Mecklenburg (then including the pres­

militia company to elect two persons  
and delegate to them ample power “to  
devise ways and means to aid and as­

and also generally to adopt measures  
to extricate themselves from the im­  
pending storm, and to secure unim­  
pared their inalienable rights, privi­  
leges and liberties from the grasp of  
British tyranny.’’  
Agreeably to Colonel Polk&#x27;s order,  
this delegation, invested with plena­  
ry powers, met in Charlotte, the  
capital of Mecklenburg county, on May  
19, 1775, when and where official news

claration of independence, made, as it  
was, one hundred years ago. The first  
thing in order is a prayer from Rev. Dr.  
Gaston.  
Rev. Dr. Gaston then offered up a  
prayer, hoping that in the union of  
hearts and hands they might go forward  
and erect the temple of freedom, to be a  
home for the oppressed and outcast of  
earth.  
At the conclusion of the prayer the  
band played an air, and at its conelu­

Captain N. D. Menken. (Cheers.

-&quot; North Cabouna, &quot;j j  
. I Mecklenburg County,&#x27;  
- ; - Maya), 1775. M f  
&quot; In thftEpriDgr of lT7o, the leading  
characters of Mecklentmrgr&#x27; county,  
stimulated by the enthusiastic pat­  
riotism which elevates the mind  
above considerations of individual  
aggrandisement, and scorning to  
shelter themselves from the impend­  
ing storm by submission to lawless  
power, &amp;c, &amp;c, held several detach­  
ed meetings, in each of which the in­  
dividual sentiments were Uthat the  
cause of Boston was the! cause of all ;  
that their destinies were indissolubly  
connected with those of their Eastern  
fellow citizens.and that they must ei th  
er submit to all the impositions which  
an unprincipled, and to them - an  
unrepresented parliament might im­  
pose or support their brethren who  
were doomed tosustain the first shock  
of that power, which if successful  
there, would ultimately overwhelm  
all in the common calamity. Con­  
formably to&quot; those principles, Col.  
Adam Alexander,&#x27; through solicita­  
tion, issued an order to each Captain&#x27;s  
company in the county of Mecklen­  
burg, (then comprising the present  
county of Cabarrus) directing each  
militia company to elect twopereons,  
and delegate to. them ample power to  
devise ways and means to aid and  
assist their suffering brethren In  
Boston, and also generally to adopt  
measures to extricate themselves  
from the impending storm, and to  
secure unimpaired their inalienable  
rights, privileges and liberties from  
the dominant grasp of British impo­  
sition and tryanny. i .-&quot;  
In conforming to said order, on the  
19th of May 1775 the said delegatioin  
met inCharlotte, vested with unlimi­  
ted power ; at which time official news  
by express, arrived of the battle of  
Lexington that day of the preced­  
ing month. Every delegate felt the  
value and importance of the prize, and  
the awful and solemn crisis which  
had arrived, every bosom -swelled  
with indignation at the malice, , in  
eteracy and &#x27; insatiable revenge de­  
veloped in the late attack at Lexing­  
ton. The universal sentiment  
was, let us not flatter ourselves that  
popular harangues or -resolvers;  
that popular vapor will avert the  
storm or vanquish our common ene­  
mylet us deliberatelet us calcu­  
late the issue the probable result;  
and then let us act with energy as  
brethren leagued to preserve our  
property our lives and what is  
stili more endearing, the liberties of  
America. Abraham Alexander was  
then elected Chairman and John Ma  
Knitt Alexander, Clerk. &#x27;After a  
free and full discussion of the vari­  
ous objects for which the delegation  
had been convened, it was unani­  
mously,&#x27;: . .iuvV,-..-

country to America and to the in  
herent and inalienable rights of

were individually approved by the  
members of Congress, but that it was  
deemed premature to lay them belore  
the House. A joint letter from said  
then members of Congress was also  
received, complimentary of the zeal  
in tne common cause and . recom­  
mending perseverance and energy.  
The &#x27;subsequent harmony, una­  
nimity and exertion in the cause of  
liberty and independence, evidently  
resulting from these regulations and  
the continued exertions of said dele­  
gation, apparently tranquilizer! this  
section of the State, and met with  
the concurence and high approbation  
of the . Council of Safety, whs held  
their sessions at Newberne and Wil­  
mington alternately and who con  
firmed the nomination and acta , of  
the delegation in tneir oX3l  
ty.-q;,;-. , . . r.....-..-  
From -this delegation originated  
the Court of Equity of this county,  
who constituted and held their first  
session in Charlotte ; they then held  
their meetings regularly at Charlotte,  
at Capt. James Harris&#x27;s and Col.  
Phifer&#x27;s alternately, one week at each  
place. It was a civil court founded  
on military process. Before this ju­  
dicature ail suspicious persons, were  
made to appear, who were formally  
tried and banished, or continued un­  
der guard. Its jurisdiction was as  
unlimited as toryism, and its decrees  
as final as the confidence and patriot­  
ism of the county. Several were ar­  
rested and brought before them from  
Lincoln, Kowan and the East coun­  
ties. r,-:y- . -a &#x27;. .---

to have been adopted on the 20th of

tion of the ties which bound them to  
Great Britain and did “ establish an in­

and that they must either submit to all  
.the impositions which an unprincipled  
and, to them, an un presented Parlia­  
. ment miht impose, or support their  
brethren who wert doomed to sustain  
the first shock of that power, which, if  
successful there, would ultimately  
overwhelm hlf in the common cala­  
mity.&quot;Conformably to these principles,  
Lol. Adam AlexaLder, through solici  
tatiou, issued an order to reach capi  
tal&#x27;s company in the county of Meek  
lenburg (then comprising the present  
county of Cabarras) directing each  
military company to erect two persons  
and delegates to them ample power to  
doyise ways and means 1o aid ana as­  
sist their suffering brethren in Bos­  
ton, and also generally to adopt meas­

impending storm, and to secure unim  
paired their inalienab&#x27;e rights, ptivi

grasp of British imposition and tjran.

views by express arrived of the bat&#x27;le  
of Lexington on that day of the pre

the value and imi ortance of the pi iz ,  
and the awful and solemn crisis which  
had arrived every bosom swelled  
with indignation at the malice, inve

oped in the late attack at Lenington.  
The universal sentiment was let us not  
flatt- r ourselves that popular haranj  
. gues or resolves, that popular vapour  
will avert the storms or vanquish our  
common enemy: let us deliberate; let  
us calculate the i issue, the probable  
result, and then let us set with energy  
as brethren leagued to preserve our  
lives, and what is still more endearing  
the liberties of America.

The following interesting article is  
clipped from an ancient volume owned

acters of Mecklenburg comity, North Car­

riotism which elevates the mind above  
considerations of individml aggrandize­  
ment, and scorning to shelter them­  
selves from the impending storm by sub­  
mission to lawless power, etc., etc., held  
several detached meetings, in each of  
which the individual sentiments were:  
&quot;That the cause of Boston was the cause  
of all; that their destinies were indis­  
solubly connected with those of their  
eastern fellow-citizens and that they  
must either submit to all the impositions  
which an unprincipled, and to them an  
unrepresented, parliament might impose  
or support their brethren who were  
doomed to sustain the first shock of that  
power, which, if successful there, would  
ultimately overwhelm all in the common  
calamity.&quot; Conformably to these prin­  
ciples a convention met at Charlotte, vest

1st Resolved, That whosoever directly or indirectly abetted or in any  
way, form or manner countenanced the unchartered and dangerous in-  
vasion of our rights, as claimed by Great Britain, is an enemy to this  
country, to America, and to the inherent and inalienable rights of man.  
  
2d Resolved, That we, the citizens of Mecklenburg County, do hereby  
dissolve the political bands which have connected us to the Mother  
Country, and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British  
Crown, and abjure all political connection, contract or association with  
that nation, who have wantonly trampled on our rights and liberties, and  
inhumanly shed the blood of American patriots at Lexington.  
  
3d Resolved, That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and inde-  
pendent people; are, and of right ought to be, a sovereign and self-  
governing association, under control of no power other than that of our  
God and the general government of the Congress ; to the maintenance  
of which independence we solemnly pledge to each other our mutual  
cooperation, our lives, our fortunes, and our most sacred honor.  
  
4th Resolved, That as we now acknowledge the existence and control  
of no law or legal officer, civil or military, within this county, we do  
hereby ordain and adopt asa rule of life all, each and every of our  
former laws, wherein, nevertheless, the Crown of Great Britain never  
can be considered as holding rights, privileges, immunities or authority  
therein. :  
  
5th Resolved, That it is further decreed that all, each and every mili-  
tary officer in this county is hereby reinstated in his former command  
and authority, he acting conformably to these regulations, and that every  
member present, of this delegation, shall henceforth be a civil officer,  
viz., a justice of the peace in the character of a ‘‘ Committee-man,”’ to  
issue process, hear and determine all matters of controversy according  
to said adopted laws and to preserve peace, union and harmony in said
