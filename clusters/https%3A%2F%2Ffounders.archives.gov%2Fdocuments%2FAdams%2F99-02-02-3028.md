, or less attentive to secure them advantages?—  
It was not difficult for me to perceive that if we entered into a serious contest with France, that the character of the War would differ materially from the last we were engaged in.—In the latter, time, caution, and worrying the enemy until we could be better provided with arms, and other means, and had better disciplined Troops to carry it on, was the plan for us.—But if we should be engaged with the former, they ought to be attacked at every step, and, if possible, not suffered to make an establishment in the Country—acquiring thereby strength from the disaffected and the Slaves, whom I have no doubt they will arm—and for that purpose will commence their operations south of the Potomack.—

It is an invidious task, at all times, to draw comparisons; and I shall avoid it as much as possible:—but I have no hesitation in declaring, that if the Public is to be deprived of the Services of Colo.
