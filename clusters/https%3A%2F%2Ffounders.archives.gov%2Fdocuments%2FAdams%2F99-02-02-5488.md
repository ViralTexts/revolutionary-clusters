Junius observes, that reproaches, he might as well have said he insinuations, have no power to give affliction but to “the man who, without firmness enough to avoid a dishonourable action, has feeling enough to be ashamed of it.” I am extremely sorry to find myself supported by truth in passing this judgment, on

mpel’d more by my disposition than is due to principle, to judge charitably. Although you have lately honoured him with the favour of your opinion, that he is not the lover of France, the hater of England, and the enemy of Commerce, which he has been represented to be, and with other testimonials, yet there is one recent fact which, if your patience will endure, I will state to shew why I think he feels partial to France and inimical to England. On the meeting of Congress last November, the Committee which draughted the Report on our Foreign Relations, speak (the most laboured document before Congress,) speak of “a proposition to repeal the Embargo, so far as relates to those powers which have not passed, or do not execute any decrees injurious to the neutral rights of the United States,” in the following manner:—“The true effect of the proposition,” say the committee, “would be to open an indirect trade with Great Britain, which, through St. Bartholemews and Havannah, Lisbon, Cadiz or Gottenburg, would receive at reduced prices by glutted markets, and for want of competition, all the provisions,” &amp;c.…  “Nor can it be doubted,” say they, “that a measure which would supply exclusively one of the belligents would be war with the other.” The Report was drawn high–priests who have instructed me at her holy altar, and when I bow at her shrine, I breathe their inculcations in the following apostrophe:—  
O Liberty! thy patron and thy opposer, are Order  
Nam’d and Anarchy. Benignant as Nature, thy rule  
Like her’s, is by establish’d laws. Abounding sustenance,  
And the exuberant ellegancies of life, on the subordination  
Of the satellites

—the concluding  
query to the Duke of Grafton as to  
the source of his influence :  
  
Or is it only that wonderful sympathy of  
manners which subsists between your grace  
and one of your superiors, and does so much  
  
honour to you both? Is the union of Blifil  
and Black George no longer a romance ?  
  
For insight into character and  
felicitous expression :  
  
Examine your own breast, Sir William,  
and you will discover that reproaches and  
inquiries have no power to afflict either the  
man of unblemished integrity or the aban-  
doned profligate. It is the middle com-  
pound character which alone is vulnerable :  
the man who, without firmness enough to  
avoid a dishonourable action, has. feeling  
enough to be ashamed of it
