fter agreeing on 14 April to resolutions to implement the treaties with Algiers and the Northwest Indians, the House, in a Committee of the Whole, then took up the remaining resolution of Hillhouse (Connecticut) that it was “expedient to pass the laws necessary for carrying into effect the Treaty lately concluded” with Great Britain.

This view of the subject naturally led him to take notice of the clause in the British treaty relating to provisions; which, to say the least, wore an ambiguous countenance that was extremely disagreeable, or which rather seemed to carry a necessary implication that provisions tho’ not bound to besieged or blockaded places, might according to the existing law of nations, be regarded as contraband. According to the genuine law of nations, no articles which are not expressly and generally contraband, are so, except in the single case of their going to a besieged place; yet it is admitted in the treaty, that there are other cases when provisions may be contraband, whence the implication results that one of the cases might be that which had been assumed &amp; put in force by Great Britain in relation to the United States.

stipulated; this feature of the treaty presents itself in a very serious light indeed, especially if the doctrine be resorted to as laid down by the executive, in the letter of the then secretary of state (Mr. Jefferson) to Mr. Pinckney, on the 7th September, 1793. This letter is a comment on the British instructions of June 8, 1793, for seizing neutral provisions. After stating the measure as a flagrant breach of the law of nations, and as ruinous to our commerce and agriculture, it has the following paragraph. “This act too tends directly to draw us from that state of peace in which we are wishing to remain. It is an essential character of neutrality to furnish no aids (not stipulated by treaty,” that is, said Mr. M. by a treaty made prior to the war) “to one party which we are not equally ready to furnish to the other. If we permit corn to be sent to Great Britain and her friends, we are equally bound to permit it to France. To restrain it would be a partiality which must lead to war; and between restraining it ourselves and permitting

eaty presented the third aspect under which he was to consider it. In the free intercourse stipulated between the United States and Great Britain, it could not be pretended that any advantage was gained by the former. A treaty was surely not necessary to induce Great Britain to receive our raw materials, and to sell us her manufactures. On the other hand consider what was given up by the United States.  
  
When the government came into operation, it is well known that the American tonnage employed in the British trade bore the most inconsiderable proportion to the British tonnage. There being nothing on our side to counteract the influence of capital and other circumstances on the British side, that disproportion was the natural state of things. As some balance to the British advantages, and particularly that of her capital, our laws had made several regulations in favor of our shipping, among which was the important encouragement resulting from the difference of ten per cent. in the duties paid by American and foreign vessels. Under this encouragement the American tonnage has increased to a very respectable proportion to the British tonnage. Nor has Great Britain ever deemed it prudent to attempt any countervailing measures for her shipping; well knowing that we could easily keep up the differences by further measures on our side. But by the treaty she has reserved to herself the right to take such countervailing measures against our existing regulations; and we have surrendered our right to pursue further defensive measures against the influence of her capital. It is justly to be apprehended therefore that under such a restoration of the former state of things, the American tonnage will relapse to its former disproportion to the British tonnage.  
When he turned his attention to the West India branch of the subject, [there was] still greater cause for wonder and dissatisfaction. As the treaty now stood, Great Britain was left as free as she ever had been, to continue the entire monopoly of the intercourse, to British vessels. Recollecting as he did, and as every member of the committee must do the whole history of this subject from the peace of 1783, through every subsequent stage of our Independence down to the mission of the late envoy, it was impossible for him to express his astonishment that any treaty of commerce should have ever been acceded to, which abandoned the very object for which such a treaty was ever contemplated. He never could have believed that the time was so near, when all the principles, claims, and calculations which have heretofore prevailed among all classes of people, in every part of the Union, on this interesting point, were to be so completely renounced. A treaty of commerce with Great Britain, excluding a reciprocity for our vessels in the W. India trade, is a phenomenon which had filled him with more surprise than he knew how to express

If a nation choose, they may prohibit all trade between a colony, and a foreign country, as they may between any other part of their dominions and a foreign country.

e on the minds of the committee the most serious reflections. Here he referred again to the passage he had read in the letter from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Pinckney; and asked, if as there stated by the Executive, our neutrality and peace were to be exposed, by permitting practices of that kind, what might be thought of our giving effect, in the midst of such practices, to a treaty from which a countenance might be derived by the nation for going on with them.  
He was aware that the Executive, notwithstanding the doctrine and policy laid down as above, had finally concurred in the treaty under such circumstances. But he did not consider that as invalidating the reasoning drawn from the present state of things. He might, he said, be stepping on delicate ground, but he could not think it improper to remark, that it was a known fact that the Executive actually paused for some weeks after the concurrence of the Senate, before the treaty received his signature; that it is fairly to be presumed that a renewal of the spoliations and a recollection of the light in which they had been represented, were a ground of the pause; that, on that supposition he was probably influenced in signing the treaty when he did, by an expectation that such a mark of confidence in the British government, would produce an abolition of the unlawful proceeding, and consequently, if it had been foreseen that the spoliations would have been continued as we find them to be the treaty would not have been then signed, or if it had not been then signed, it would not be signed, under the circumstances of the moment when it falls under our consideration.  
He should conclude he said, with taking notice of two considerations which had been much used as inducements to carrying the treaty i

interests of our merchants, in creating this new sort of con­  
traband lo starve a nution to surrender as if it were a be­  
sieged town ; but not a word is said to clear up the con­  
tested point made by President Washington, through our  
minister at London, denying the British pretext under  
which &lt;&gt;ur provisions going to France were stopped, and  
asserting that it violated our rights as a nation, and, if per­  
mitted by the United States, would justify France in ma­  
king war on the United States. Mr. Madison, noticing this  
clause, in Jay&#x27;s treaty, relating lo provisions, sayB &quot; it  
seemed to carry a necessary implication that provisions,  
lliough not bound to besieged or blockaded places, might,  
according to the existing law of nations, be regarded as  
contraband. According to the genuine law of nations, no  
articles which are not expressly and generally contraband  
are so, except in the single case of their going to a besieged  
place; yet it is admitted in the treaty that there are other  
enses when provisions may be contraband, whence the im­  
plication results that one of the cases might be that which  
had been assumed and put in force by Great Britain in rev  
lation to the United States.&quot; Mr. Madison, after reasoning  
the subject at large, refers to Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s letter to Mr.  
Pinckney denying the right of Great Britain to stop  
and appropriate provisions shipped to France, and asks  
&quot;if, as there stated by the Executive, our neutrality and  
peace were to be exposed by permitting practices of  
that kind, what might be thought of our giving effect,  
in the midst of such practices, to a treaty from which  
countenance might be derived by the nation going  
on with them?&quot; &quot;He was aware that the Executive,  
notwithstanding the doctrine and policy laid down as  
above, had finally concurred in the treaty under such cir­  
cumstances. But he did not consider that as invalidating  
the reasoning drawn from the present state of things. He  
might, he said, be stepping 011 delicate ground, but he  
could not think it impro|&gt;er to remark that it was a known  
fact that the Executive actually paused for some weeks,  
after the concurrence of the Senate, liefore the treaty re­  
ceived his signature; that it is fairly to be presumed that  
a renewal of the fqioliatiouH, and a recollection of the light  
  
in which they have been presented, were a ground of the  
pause; that on that supposition he was probably influ­  
enced in signing the treaty when lie did by an expectation  
that such a mark of confidence in the British government  
would produce an abolition of the unlawful proceeding,  
and, consequently, if It had been foreseen that the spolia­  
tions would hare been continued as we find them to be,  
the treaty would not have been then signed, or, if it had  
not then been signed, it would not be signed, under cir­  
cumstances of the moment, when it falls under our consti­  
tution.&quot;  
Hon. Pierce Butler, of South Carolina, in his speech on  
the address to the President in the Senate, confirms Mr.  
.Madison&#x27;s statement, that Washington at first refused to  
sign the treaty, though sanctioned by the Senate, on per
