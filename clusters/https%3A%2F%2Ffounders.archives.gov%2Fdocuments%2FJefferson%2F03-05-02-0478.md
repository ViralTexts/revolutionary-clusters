he narrow prejudices of the French &amp; English travellers preceding you, who, considering each the manners and habits of their own people as the only orthodox, have viewed every thing differing from that test as boorish and barbarous, that your work will be read here extensively, and operate great good.  
Amidst this mass of approbation which is given to every other part of the work, there is a single sentiment which I cannot help wishing to bring to what I think the correct one , : and, on a point so interesting, I value your opinion too highly not to ambition it’s concurrence with my own. stating in Vol. 1. pa. 63. the principle of difference between the two great political parties here, you conclude it to be ‘whether the controuling power shall be vested in this or that set of men.’ that each party endeavors to get into the administration of the government, &amp; to exclude the other from power, is true, and may be stated as a motive of action; but this is only secondary; the primary motive being a real and radical difference of political principle. I sincerely wish our differences were but personally who should govern, and that the principles of our constitution were those of both parties. unfortunately it is otherwise; and the question of preference between monarchy and republicanism, which has so long divided mankind elsewhere, threatens a permanent division here.among that section of our citizens called federalists, there are three shades of opinion—distinguishing between the leaders and people who compose it, the leaders consider the English constitution as a model of perfection, some, with a correction of it’s vices, others with all it’s corruptions &amp; abuses. this last was Alexander Hamilton’s opinion, which others as well as myself have often heard him declare, and that a correction of what are called it’s vices would render the English an impracticable government. this government they wished to have established here, and only accepted and held fast, at first, to the present constitution, as a stepping stone to the final establishment of their favorite model. this party has therefore always clung to England as their prototype and great auxiliary in promoting and effecting this change. a weighty minority however of these leaders, considering the voluntary conversion of our government into a monarchy as too distant if not desperate, wish to break off from our union it’s Eastern fragment as being in truth the hot bed of American monarchism, with a view to a commencement of their favorite government, from whence the other states may gangrene by degrees, and the whole be thus brought finally to the desired point. for Massachusets, the prime mover in this enterprise, is the last state in the union to mean a final separation, as being of all the most dependant on the others. not raising bread for the sustenance of her own inhabitants, not having a stick of timber for the construction of vessels her principal occupation, nor an article to export in them, where would she be, excluded from the ports of the other states, and thrown into dependance on England, her direct &amp; natural, but now insidious, rival? at the head of this minority is what is called the Essex junto of Massachusets. but the majority of these leaders, do not aim at separation. in this they adhere to the known principle of General Hamilton, never under any views to break the union. Anglomany, Monarchy, &amp; Separation then are the principles of the Essex federalists, Anglomany &amp; Monarchy, those of the Hamiltonians, and Anglomany alone that of the portion among the people who call themselves federalists. these last are as good republicans as the brethren whom they oppose, &amp; differ from them only in the devotion to England and hatred of France, which they have imbibed from their leaders. the moment that these leaders should avowedly propose a separation of the union, or the establishment of regal government, their popular adherents would quit them to a man, &amp; join the republican standard, and the partisans of this change, even in Massachusets, would thus find themselves an army of officers without a soldier.the party called republican is steadily for the support of the present constitution. they obtained at it’s commencement all the amendments to it they desired. these reconciled them to it perfectly, and if they have any ulterior view, it is only perhaps to popularise it further, by shortening the Senatorial term, and devising a process for the responsibility of judges more practicable than that of impeachment. they esteem the people of England &amp; France equally, &amp; equally detest the governing powers of both. this I verily believe, after an intimacy of 40. years with the public councils &amp; characters, is a true statement of the grounds on which they are at present divided, and that it is not merely an ambition for power. an honest man can feel no pleasure in the exercise of power over his fellow citizens. and, considering as the only offices of power those conferred by the people directly, that is to say, the Executive &amp; Legislative functions of the General &amp; State governments, the common refusal of these, &amp; multiplied resignations, are proofs sufficient that power is not alluring to pure minds, and is not, with them, the primary object principle of contest. this is my belief of it; it is that on which I have acted; and had it been a mere contest who should be permitted to administer the government according to it’s genuine republican principles, there has never been a moment of my life in which I should have relinquished for it the enjoiments of my family, my farm, my friends &amp; books.you expected to discover the difference of our party principles in Genl Washington’s Valedictory, &amp; my Inaugural addresses. not at all. Genl Washington did not harbour one principle of federalism. he was neither an Angloman, a monarchist nor a Separatist. he sincerely wished the people to have as much self-government as they were competent to exercise themselves. the only point in which he and I ever differed in opinion was that I had more confidence than he had in the natural integrity and discretion of the people; and in the safety and extent to which they might trust themselves with a controul over their government. he has asseverated to me a thousand times his determination that the existing government should have a fair trial, and that in support of it he would spend the last drop of his blood. he did this the more repeatedly, because he knew Genl Hamilton’s political bias, and my apprehensions from it. it is a mere calumny therefore in the Monarchists to associate General Washington with their principles, but that may have happened in this case which has been often seen in ordinary cases, that by often repeating an untruth men come to believe it themselves. it is a mere artifice in this party to bolster themselves up on the revered name of that first of our worthies.—if I have dwelt longer on this subject than was necessar

A weighty minority of these leaders, consi-  
dering the voluntary convertion of our gov-  
ernment into a monarchy, as too distant, if  
not desperate, wish to breale off from our  
Union its Eastern fragment, as being, in fact,  
the hot-bed of American monarchism, with  
a view to the commencement of their favor-  
ite government, from whence other States  
may gangrene by degrees, and the whole be  
thus finally brought to the desired point.  
  
**At the head of this minority is what is  
called the Essex Junta of Massachusetts.  
But the majority of these leaders do not aim  
at separation. In this they adhere to the  
known principles of General Hamilton, ne-  
ver, under any view, to break up the Union.  
Anglomany, monarchy, and separation, then,  
are the principles of the Essex Federalists ;  
anglomany and monarchy, of the Hamilto-  
nians ; and anglomany alone of the portion  
of people who call themselves Federalists.”  
  
In these extracts we have the testi  
mony of Mr. Jefferson that ‘this Mas-  
sachusetts party, finding that they  
could not mould the federal govern-  
ment to suit their views of centrali-  
zation and consolidation, determined

tablish a “ Northern Confederacy.”

government should have a fair trial, and  
that in support of it he would spend the last
