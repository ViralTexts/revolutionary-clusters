ter recommending, as a remedy, the appoint&#x27;  
ment of the judges for a term of years only, their  
re-appointment or re-election to depend upon  
previous conduct, Mr. Jefferson said:—  
“ At the establishment of our Constitution, the  
judiciary bodies were supposed to be the must

what way they were to become the most dan­
