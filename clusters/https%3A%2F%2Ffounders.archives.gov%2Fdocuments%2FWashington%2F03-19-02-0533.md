Dear Sir  
Middlebrook Mar. 20th 1779  
I have to thank you and I do it very sincerely, for your obliging favors of the 2d &amp; 16 Inst. &amp; for their several inclosures, containing Articles of intelligence.  
I congratulate you most cordially on Colo. Campbells precipitate retreat from Fort Augusta—what was this owing to—it seems to have been a surprize even upon Williamson. But I rejoice much more on acct of his disappointed application to the Creek Indians—this I think is to be considered as a very important event and may it not be the conjectural cause of his (Campbells) hasty return—this latter circumstance cannot but be a fresh proof to the disaffected in that Country that they are leaning upon a broken Reed. severe examples should in my judgment be made of those who are aggressors in this way the second time.  
The policy of our arming Slaves is in my opinion a moot point, unless the enemy set the example, for should we begin to form Battalions of them I have not the smallest doubt (if the war is to be prosecuted) of their following us in it, and justifying the measure upon our own ground. The upshot then must be who can Arm fastest—and where are our Arms? besides I am not clear that a descrimination will not render Slavery more irksome to those who remain in it—Most of the good and evil things of this life are judged of by comparison, and I fear comparison in this Case will be productive of Much discontent in those who are held in servitude—but as this is a subject that has never employed much of my thoughts, these are no more than the first crude Ideas that have struck me upon the occasion.  
  
I had [not] the smallest intimation of Monsr Gerards passing through Jersey till I was favoured with your letter and am now ignorant of this cause further than by conjecture. The inclosed I return as Mr Laurens left this some days ago for Philadelphia on his way to the Southward.  
Mrs Washington joins me in respectful compliments to you &amp; with every sentiment of regard &amp; attachment. I am Dr Sir Yr Most Obedt Servt  
Go. Washingto

on the gronnd that they had previously served  
in the army, and being dissatisfied at being  
disbanded there might be danger of their en-  
listing with the British forces. In 177&#x27;J, when  
the enlistment of negro slaves was suggested  
by Henry Laurens for the purpose of driving  
the British out of Georgia, Gen. Washington  
replied: &quot;The policy of arming our slaves is  
in my opinion a moot point unless the enemy  
set the example. For should we begin to form  
battalions of them, I have not the smallest  
doubt, if the war is to be prosecuted, of their

be, who can arm fastest. &quot;

Middlf.brook, Mar. 20th, 1779.  
Dear Sir:?1 have to thank you, and I doit  
very sincerely, for your obliging favors of the  
2d and 16th iust., and for their several enelcs

But I rejoice much more on account of his disappointed  
application to the Creek Indians?  
tuis, 1 think, is to be considered as a very important  
event, and may it not be the conjee  
tural cause offchis (Campbell&#x27;s) hasty return ??  
this latter eircum*tance cannot but be a fr*-ari  
proof to the disaffected iu that country that they  
are leauing upon a broken Heed.?Severe ex  
amples should, in my judgment, be made ol  
those who are aggressors 111 this way the second  
time.  
The policy of our arming slaves is, in my  
opinion, a moot point, unless the en^mv set  
the example; for, should one begin to form  
battalion* of them, 1 have not the smallest  
doubt (il the war is to be prosecuted) of their

Beside?, I am not clear that a discrimination  
wsli not render slavery more irksome to those

things of this life are judged of by comparison,

has never employed much of ray thoughts, these

I ha t not had the smallest intimation of  
Major Gerard&#x27;s passing through J&lt; rsey till 1
