Dear Sir  
Philada. Dec. 11. 1762  
I thank you for your kind Congratulations. It gives me Pleasure to hear from an old Friend, it will give me much more to see him. I hope therefore nothing will prevent the Journey you propose for next Summer, and the Favour you intend me of a Visit. I believe I must make a Journey early in the Spring, to Virginia, but purpose being back again before the hot Weather. You will be kind enough to let me know beforehand what time you expect to be here, that I may not be out of the way; for that would mortify me exceedingly.  
I should be glad to know what it is that distinguishes Connecticut Religion from common Religion: Communicate, if you please, some of those particulars that you think will amuse me as a Virtuoso. When I travelled in Flanders I thought of your excessively strict Observation of Sunday; and that a Man could hardly travel on that day among you upon his lawful Occasions, without Hazard of Punishment; while where I was, every on[e] travell’d, if he pleas’d, or diverted himself any other way; and in the Afternoon both high and low went to the Play or the Opera, where there was plenty of Singing, Fiddling and Dancing. I look’d round for God’s Judgments but saw no Signs of them. The Cities were well built and full of Inhabitants, the Markets fill’d with Plenty, the People well favour’d and well clothed; the Fields well till’d; the Cattle fat and strong; the Fences, Houses and Windows all in Repair; and no Old Tenor anywhere in the Country; which would almost make one suspect, that the Deity is not so angry at that Offence as a New England Justice.  
I left our Friend Mr. Jackson well. And I had the great Happiness of finding my little Family well when I came home; and my Friends as cordial and more numerous than ever. May every Prosperity attend you and yours. I am Dear Friend, Yours affectionately  
B Franklin

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. LI, 1762.  
  
Dear Sir: I thank you for your kind congratula-  
tion. It gives me pleasure to hear from an old  
friend—it will give me much more to see him. I  
hope therefore nothing will prevent the Journey you  
propose for next summer and the Favour you inténd  
me of, a Visit. I believe I must make a Journey  
early in the Spring to Virginia, but propose being  
back again before the hot Weather.  
  
From its peculiari-  
  
you expect to be here, that I may not be out of the  
way: for-that would mortify me exceedingly. _  
  
i should be glad to know what it is that distin-  
guishes Connecticut Religion from common Re-  
ligion ; Communicate, if you please, some of those  
particulars that you think will amuse me as a Vir-  
tuoso. When I travelled in Flanders, I thought of  
your excessively strict Observation of Sunday ; and  
that a man would hardly travel on that day among  
you upon his lawful Occasions, without Hazard of  
Punishment ; while where I was every one travell’d  
if he pleased, or diverted himself any, other way ;  
and inthe Afternoon both high and low went to the  
Play or the Opera, where there was plenty of Sing-  
ing, Fiddling, and Dancing. I look’d round for  
God’s Judgments but saw no Signs ef them. ‘Phe  
Cities were built and full of Inhabitants, the Mar-  
kets filled with Plenty, the People well favoured  
and well clothed ; the Fields were tilled; the Cat-  
tle fat and strong; the houses and windows were all  
in ‘repair ; and no old Tenor any where in the Coun-  
‘try; which would almost make one suspect, that the  
Deity is not so angry at that Offence as a New  
England Justice.  
  
I left our friend Mr. J. well, And I~ had the  
great Happiness of finding my little.Family well  
when I came home; and my Friends as Cordial and  
more numerous than ever. May every prosperity  
attend you and yours.  
  
Iam Dear Friend, Yours affectionately,
