We give the resolutions passed at the con-  
vention. It will be seen there is an apparent  
difference of opinion in regard to one subject—  
but we are persuaded it is more apparent than  
real.  
  
1, Resolved, That under the Constitution of Massa-  
chusetts, ‘the people have a right, in an orderly and  
peaceable manner, to assemble, to consult upon the com-  
mon good,’ and that in the exercise of this right, the Con-  
vention has met, and will express our views upon the mo-  
mentous interests involved in the Temperance reforma-  
tion.  
  
2. Resolved, That we gratefully recognize the Divine  
Goodness in directing the attention of the community so  
extensively to the numerous evils of using intoxicating li-  
quor as a beverage, or furnishing it to be used by others  
—and in leading such multitudes to abandon these vicious  
practices.
