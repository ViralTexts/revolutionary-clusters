It may be presumed, that, previous to the close of the present session, congress will be possessed of such further information in regard to our foreign relations, as will be necessary for forming an ultimate opinion on the expediency or inexpediency of a greater Augmentation of our Army than is now proposed; and, in the mean time, measures are to be taken for the recruiting service in different parts of the U.S.  
In the event of War it will, I presume be considered as necessary to arrange our military force into seperate departments and to have a commander to each department, and, of course to have no such officer as a commander in chief; and, until a larger Army shall be raised than is now proposed; it may not be adviseable to have any officers above the rank of Brigadier General, of that grade it may be proper to have four or five, as soon as a suitable proportion of the troops is raised

It may be presumed that previous to the close of  
the present session, Congress will be possesoed of  
such farther information in regard to our foreign  
relations @s wil! be necessary for forming an ult-  
mate opinion on the expediency or inexpedieacy of  
a greater augmentation of our army than is now pro-  
posed ; and in the mean time measures may be ta-  
ken for the recrui&#x27;ing service in different parts of  
the United Srates.  
  
In the event of war, it will I presume be consid-  
ered necessary to arrange our military force into  
separate departments, and to have a commander to  
each department, and of course, to have no such  
officer asa commander in chief ; and waril a larger ar-  
miy shall be ra:sed than ts now proposed, it may not  
be advisable to have any officers above the rank of  
Brigadser-Generals ;--of that grade it may be prop-

tion of the troops is raised.
