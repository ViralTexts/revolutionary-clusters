fter a very long passage is recieved, and with it the Map which you have been so kind as to send me, for which I return you many thanks. it is handsomely executed and on a well chosen scale; giving a luminous view of the comparative possessions of different powers in our America. it is on account of the value I set on it that I will make some suggestions. by the Charter of Louis XIV. all the country containing comprehending the waters which flow into the Missisipi were was made a part of Louisiana. consequently it’s northern boundary was the summit of the highlands in which the it’s Northern waters rise. but by the Xth art. of the treaty of Utrecht, France &amp; England agreed to appoint Commissaries to settle their the boundary between their possessions in that quarter; and those Commrs settled it at the 49th degree of Lat. see Hutchinson’s topographical description of Louisiana. pa. 7. this it was which induced the British Commrs in settling the boundary with us, to follow the wa Northern waterline to the Lake of the woods  at the latitude of 49° and then go off on that parallel. this then is the true Northern boundary of Louisiana.  
  
The Western boundary of Louisiana is, rightfully, the Rio Bravo, (it’s main stream) from it’s mouth to it’s source, and thence along the highlands &amp; mountains dividing the waters of the Missipi from those of the Pacific. the usurpations of Spain on the East side of that river have induced geographers to suppose the Puerco or Salado to be the boundary. the line along the highlands stands on the Charter of Louis XIV. that of the Rio Bravo, on the circumstance that when La Saletook took possession of the bay of St Bernard, Panuco was the nearest possession of Spain, &amp; the Rio Bravo the natural halfway boundary between them.  
On the waters of the Pacific we can found no claim in right of Louisiana. if we claim that country at all, it must be on Astor’s settlement near the mouth of the Columbia, and the principle of the jus gentium of America that when a civilized nation takes possession of the mouth of a river in a new country, that possession is considered as including all it’s waters. the line of latitude of the Southern  
			 source of the Multnomah might be claimed as appurtenant to Astoria. for it’s Northern boundary, I believe an understanding has been come to between our government &amp; Russia, w

country at all it must be ‘for other reasons.’ The last link  
in the chain of other reasons was completed in 1819, as we

the geographer, Jefferson sald: &quot;By the char­  
ter of Louis xIV all the country comprehend­  
ing the waters which flow into the Mis­  
sissippi was made a part of Louisiana. Conse­  
quently its northern boundary was the summit  
of the highlands in which its northern waters  
rise.&quot; Jefferson went on to point out, however.  
that by the tenth article of the treaty of  
Utrecht France and England agreed to appoint  
Commissioners to settle the boundary between  
their several possessions in that quarter, and  
those commissioners settled it at the 45th de­  
gree of latitude. &quot;This it was which induced  
the British Commissioners, in settling the  
boundary with us, to follow the northern water  
line to the Lake of the Woods at the latitude of  
19, and then go off on that parallel. This.  
then, is the true northern boundary of Louisi­  
ana.&quot; As to the western boundary of Louisi­  
ana Jefferson thought that this was rightfully­  
&quot;the main stream of the Rio Bravo, from its  
mouth tits suuree, and thence nlong the highe  
and mountains dividing the waters of the  
Mississippi from those of the Pacifle,&quot; Jeffer­  
son does not overlook the act that the usurda-  
tions of Spain on the east side of that river  
the ito Bravo) had induced geographers to  
 suppose the Puerco or Sala lo to be the bound-  
ary, but he directs attention to the circum­  
stance that &quot;the line along the highlands  
stands on the charter of Louis AlV in pursu­  
ance of that of the Rio Bravo for the reason  
that when La Salle took pos-ession of the Bay  
of San Bernardo, Panuco was the nearest pos­  
session of Spain, and the Hio Bravo the natural  
half-way boundary between them.&quot; Jeferson  
then makes a remarkable admission which  
many students of the subject have lost sight  
of: &quot;On the waters of the Pacifie we can found  
no claim in right of Louisiana. If we claim  
that country at all, it must be on Astor&#x27;s set­  
tlement, near the mouth of the Columbia, and  
the principle of the ius gentinm of America.
