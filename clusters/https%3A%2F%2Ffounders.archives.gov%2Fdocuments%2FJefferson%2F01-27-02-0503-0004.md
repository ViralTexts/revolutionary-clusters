The Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the House of Representatives the Report of a Committee on the written Message of the President of the United States, of the 14th. of Feb: 1791, with instruction to report to Congress the nature and extent of the Privileges and Restrictions of the commercial Intercourse of the United States, with foreign Nations, and the Measures which he should think proper to be adopted for the improvement of the Commerce and Navigation of the same, has had the same under consideration, and thereupon makes the following

To descend to Articles of smaller value than these would lead into a minuteness of detail neither necessary nor useful to the present object.  
The proportions of our Exports, which go to the Nations before-mentioned, and to their Dominions, respectively, are as follows.

These imports consist mostly of Articles on which industry has been exhausted.  
Our Navigation depending, on the same Commerce, will appear by the following statement of the Tonnage of our own Vessels, entering in our Ports, from those several Nations, and their possessions, in one Year, that is to say, from October 1789, to September 1790, inclusive, as follows.

Of our commercial objects, Spain receives favorably, our Bread stuff, Salted Fish, Wood, Ships, Tar, Pitch, and Turpentine. On our Meals, however, as well as on those of other foreign Countries when re-exported to their Colonies, they have lately imposed Duties, of from half a Dollar, to two Dollars the Barrel, the Duties being so proportioned to the current price of their own Flour, as that both together are to make the constant sum of nine Dollars per Barrel.  
They do not discourage our Rice, Pot and Pearl Ash, salted provisions,  
or whale oil: but these Articles, being in small demand at their markets, are carried thither but in a small degree. Their demand for Rice, however, is increasing. Neither Tobacco nor Indigo are received there. Our commerce is permitted with their Canary islands under the same conditions.  
Themselves, and their Colonies are the actual consumers of what they receive from us.  
Our Navigation is free with the Kingdom of Spain; foreign Goods being received there in our Ships on the same Conditions as if carried in their own, or in the vessels of the Country of which such Goods are the manufacture or produce.  
Portugal receives favorably our Grain, and Bread, Salted fish, and other salted provisions, Wood, Tar, Pitch, and Turpentine.  
For Flaxseed, Pot and Pearl Ash, though not discouraged, there is little demand.  
Our Ships pay 20 per Cent, on being sold to their subjects, and are then free bottoms.  
Foreign goods (except those of the East Indies) are received on the same footing in our Vessels, as in their own, or any others; that is to say, on general Duties of from 20 to 28 per cent, and, consequently, our Navigation is unobstructed by them. Tobacco, Rice, and Meals, are prohibited.  
Themselves, and their Colonies consume what they receive from us.  
These Regulations extend to the Azores, Madeira, and the Cape de Verd Islands, except that in these, Meals and Rice are received freely.  
France receives favorably our Bread stuff, Rice, Wood, Pot and Pearl-ashes.  
A duty of 5 Sous the Kental, or nearly 4½ Cents, is paid on our Tar, Pitch, and Turpentine. Our whale-oils pay six Livres the Kental, and are the only foreign whale oils admitted. Our Indigo pays 5 Livres the Kental; their own two and a half: but a difference of quality, still more than a difference of duty, prevents it’s seeking that market.  
Salted Beef is received freely for re-exportation; but if for home-consumption, it pays 5 Livres the Kental. Other salted provisions pay that Duty in all cases, and salted fish is made lately to pay the prohibitory one of 20 Livres the Kental.  
Our Ships are free to carry thither all foreign Goods, which may be carried in their own or any other Vessels, except Tobaccos not of our own growth: and they participate with theirs the exclusive carriage of our whale oils, and Tobaccoes.  
During their former Government our Tobacco was under a monopoly, but paid no Duties; and our Ships were freely sold in their ports and converted into national bottoms. The first national assembly took from our Ships this privilege. They emancipated Tobacco from it’s monopoly,  
but subjected it to duties of 18 Livres 15 Sous the Kental, carried in their own Vessels, and 25 Livres, carried in ours; a difference more than equal to the freight of the Article.  
They and their Colonies consume what they receive from us.  
Great Britain receives our Pot and Pearl Ashes, free, while those of other nations pay a Duty of 2s./3d. the Kental. There is an equal distinction in favor of our Bar-iron; of which Article, however, we do not produce enough for our own use. Woods are free, from us, whilst they pay some small duty from other Countries. Indigo and Flax-seed, are free, from all countries. Our Tar and Pitch pay 11d. sterling the Barrel. From other alien Countries, they pay about a penny and a third more.  
Our Tobacco, for their own Consumption, pays ⅓ sterling the pound, custom and excise, besides heavy expenses of collection: and Rice, in the same case, pays 7/4 sterling the hundred weight; which, rendering it too dear, as an Article of common food, it is consequently, used in very small quantity.  
Our salted fish and other salted provisions, except Bacon, are prohibited. Bacon and whale-oils are under prohibitory duties: so are our Grains, Meals, and Bread, as to internal consumption, unless in times of such scarcity as may raise the price of wheat to 50/.— sterling the Quarter, and other Grains and meals in proportion.  
Our Ships, though purchased and navigated by their own subjects, are not permitted to be used, even in their trade with us.  
While the vessels of other nations are secured by standing Laws, which cannot be altered, but by the concurrent Will of the three Branches of the British Legislature, in carrying thither any produce or manufacture of the Country to which they belong, which may be lawfully carried in any Vessels, ours, with the same prohibition of what is foreign, are further prohibited by a standing law (12. Car. 2. 18. §.3.) from carrying thither all and any of our own domestic productions and manufactures. A subsequent Act, indeed, has authorized their Executive to permit the carriage of our own productions, in our own bottoms, at it’s sole discretion: and the permission has been given from year to year by Proclamation; but subject every moment to be withdrawn on that single will, in which event, our Vessels having any thing on board, stand interdicted from the Entry of all british Ports. The disadvantage of a Tenure which may be so suddenly discontinued, was experienced by our Merchants on a late occasion, when an official notification that this law would be strictly enforced, gave them just apprehensions for the fate of their Vessels and Cargoes dispatched or destined to the Ports of Great Britain. The Minister of that Court indeed frankly expressed  
his personal conviction that the words of the order went farther than was intended, and so he afterwards, officially informed us: but the embarrassments of the moment were real and great, and the possibility of their renewal, lays our Commerce to that Country, under the same species of discouragement as to other Countries, where it is regulated by a single Legislator: and the distinction is too remarkable not to be noticed, that our Navigation is excluded from the Security of fixed Laws, while that Security is given to the navigation of others.  
Our Vessels pay in their ports 1/9 sterling per ton, light and Trinity dues, more than is paid by British Ships, except in the port of London, where they pay the same as British.  
The greater part of what they receive from us, is re-exported to other Countries, under the useless charges of an intermediate deposite, and double voyage. From Tables published in England, and composed, as is said, from the Books of their Custom-houses, it appears that of the Indigo imported there in the Years 1773,-4,-5, one third was re-exported; and, from a document of Authority, we learn, that, of the Rice and Tobacco imported there, before the War, four fifths were re-exported. We are assured indeed, that the quantities sent thither for re-exportation since the war, are considerably diminished, yet less so than reason and national interest would dictate. The whole of our Grain is re-exported when wheat is below 50/. the Quarter, and other Grains in proportion.  
The United Netherlands prohibit our pickled Beef, and Pork, Meals and Bread of all Sorts, and lay a prohibitary duty on Spirits distilled from Grain.  
All other of our productions are received on varied duties, which may be reckoned, on a medium at about 3 per cent.  
They consume but a small proportion of what they receive. The residue is partly forwarded for consumption in the inland parts of Europe and partly re-shipped to other maritime Countries. On the latter portion They intercept, between us and the consumer so much of the value as is absorbed by the charges attending an intermediate deposite.  
Foreign goods, except some East India Articles, are received in Vessels of any Nation.  
Our Ships may be sold and naturalized there, with exceptions of one or two privileges, which somewhat lessen their value.  
Denmark lays considerable duties on our Tobacco and Rice, carried in their own Vessels, and half as much more, if carried in ours; but the exact amount of these duties is not perfectly known here. They lay such as amount to prohibitions on our Indigo and corn.  
Sweden receives favorably our Grains and meals, Salted Provisions, Indigo, and whale oil.  
They subject our Rice to duties of 16 mills the pound weight, carried  
in their own Vessels, and of 40 per cent additional on that, or 22 4/10 mills, carried in ours, or any others. Being thus rendered too dear as an Article of common food, little of it is consumed with them. They consume some of our Tobaccos, which they take circuitously through Great Britain; levying heavy duties on them also; their duties of Entry, Town duties, and Excise, being 4.34 Dollars, the hundred weight, if carried in their own Vessels, and of 40 per cent on that additional, if carried in our own or any other vessels.  
They prohibit altogether our Bread, Fish, Pot and Pearl ashes, Flaxseed, Tar, Pitch, and Turpentine, Wood (except oak timber and Masts) and all foreign manufactures.  
Under so many restrictions and prohibitions, our Navigation with them is reduced almost to nothing.  
With our neighbors, an order of Things much harder presents itself.  
Spain and Portugal refuse, to those parts of america which they govern, all direct intercourse with any people but themselves. The Commodities in mutual demand, between them and their neighbors, must be carried to be exchanged in some port of the dominant Country, and the transportation between that and the subject-State must be in a domestic bottom.  
France by a standing Law, permits her West India possessions to receive directly our Vegetables, Live Provisions, Horses, Wood, Tar, Pitch, and Turpentine, Rice, and Maize, and prohibits our other Bread stuff: but a suspension of this prohibition having been left to the Colonial Legislatures, in times of scarcity, it was formerly suspended occasionally, but latterly without interruption.  
Our Fish and salted Provisions (except Pork) are received in their Islands under a Duty of 3 colonial Livres the Kental, and our vessels are as free as their own to carry our commodities thither, and to bring away Rum and Molasses.  
Great Britain admits in her Islands, our Vegetables, live Provisions, Horses, Wood, Tar, Pitch, and Turpentine, Rice, and Bread stuff, by a Proclamation of her Executive limited always to the term of a Year, but hitherto renewed from year to year. She prohibits our salted Fish and other salted Provisions. She does not permit our Vessels to carry thither our own produce. Her Vessels alone, may take it from us, and bring in exchange, Rum, Molasses, Sugar, Coffee, Cocoa-nuts, Ginger, and Pimento. There are, indeed, some freedoms in the Island of Dominica, but, under such circumstances, as to be little used by us. In the British continental Colonies, and in Newfoundland, all our productions are prohibited, and our Vessels forbidden to enter their ports. Their Governors, however, in times of distress, have power to permit a temporary importation of certain articles, in their own bottoms, but not in ours.  
  
Our Citizens cannot reside as merchants or Factors within any of the British Plantations, this being expressly prohibited by the same Statute of 12 Car. 2. c. 18, commonly called the navigation act.  
In the Danish-American possessions, a duty of 5 per cent is levied on our corn, corn-meal, Rice, Tobacco, Wood, salted fish, Indigo, Horses, Mules, and Live stock, and of 10 per cent on our Flour, salted-Pork, and Beef, Tar, Pitch and Turpentine.  
In the American Islands of the United Netherlands and Sweden, our Vessels and produce are received, subject to duties, not so heavy as to have been complained of: but they are heavier in the Dutch possessions on the contintent.  
To Sum up these Restrictions, so far as they are important.  
1st. In Europe.  
Our Breadstuff is at most times under prohibitory duties in England, and considerably dutied on re-exportation from Spain to her Colonies.  
Our Tobaccoes are heavily dutied in England, Sweden, and France, and prohibited in Spain, and Portugal.  
Our Rice is heavily dutied in England and Sweden, and prohibited in Portugal.  
Our Fish and salted Provisions are prohibited in England, and under prohibitory duties in France.  
Our Whale Oils are prohibited in England and Portugal.  
And our vessels are denied naturalization in England, and of late in France.  
2d. In the West Indies.  
All intercourse is prohibited with the possessions of Spain and Portugal.  
Our salted provisions and Fish are prohibited by England.  
Our salted pork, and Bread stuff (except maize) are received under temporary Laws only, in the dominions of France, and our Salted-fish pays there a weighty duty.  
3rd. In the Article of Navigation.  
Our own carriage of our own Tobacco, is heavily dutied in Sweden, and lately in France.  
We can carry no Article, not of our own production to the British ports in Europe.  
Nor even our own produce to her American possessions.  
Such being the Restrictions on the Commerce and Navigation of the United States, the Question is, in what way they may best be removed, modified, or counteracted?  
As to Commerce, two methods occur. 1. By friendly arrangements with the several Nations with whom these Restrictions exist: Or, 2. By the separate Act of our own Legislatures for countervailing their effects.  
There can be no doubt, but that of these two, friendly arrangement is  
the most eligible. Instead of embarrassing Commerce under piles of regulating Laws, Duties, and Prohibitions, could it be relieved from all it’s shackles in all parts of the world, could every Country be employed in producing that which Nature has best fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with others mutual surplusses, for mutual Wants, the greatest mass possible would then be produced of those Things which contribute to human life and human happiness; the numbers of mankind would be increased, and their condition bettered.  
Would even a single Nation begin with the United States this System of free Commerce, it would be advisable to begin it with that nation; since it is one by one only, that it can be extended to all. Where the Circumstances of either party render it expedient to levy a Revenue, by way of impost, on Commerce, it’s freedom might be modified, in that particular, by mutual and equivalent measures, preserving it entire in all others.  
Some Nations, not yet ripe for free Commerce, in all it’s extent, might still be willing to mollify it’s restrictions and regulations for us, in proportion to the advantages, which an intercourse with us might offer. Particularly they may concur with us in reciprocating the Duties to be levied on each side, or in compensating any excess of duty, by equivalent advantages of another nature. Our Commerce is certainly of a Character to entitle it to favor in most Countries. The Commodities we offer, are either necessaries of life; or materials for manufacture; or convenient Subjects of Revenue: and we take in exchange, either manufactures, when they have received the last finish of Art and Industry; or mere Luxuries. Such Customers may reasonably expect welcome, and friendly treatment at every market: Customers too, whose demands, increasing with their wealth, and population, must very shortly give full employment to the whole Industry of any Nation whatever, in any line of supply they may get into the habit of calling for from it.  
But should any Nation, contrary to our wishes, suppose it may better find it’s advantage by continuing it’s System of Prohibitions, Duties, and Regulations, it behoves us to protect our Citizens, their Commerce and Navigation, by Counter-prohibitions, Duties, and Regulations also. Free commerce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for Restrictions, and Vexations: nor are they likely to produce a relaxation of them.  
Our Navigation involves still higher considerations. As a Branch of Industry, it is valuable; but, as a resource of Defence, essential.  
It’s Value, as a Branch of Industry, is enhanced by the dependence of so many other Branches on it. In times of general Peace it multiplies Competitors for employment in transportation, and so keeps that at it’s proper level; and in times of war, that is to say, when those nations who  
may be our principal Carriers shall be at war with each other, if we have not within ourselves the means of transportation, our produce must be exported in belligerant vessels at the increased expense of war-freight and Insurance, and the Articles, which will not bear that, must perish on our hands.  
But it is as a resource for Defence that our Navigation will admit neither neglect nor forbearance. The position and Circumstances of the United States leave them nothing to fear on their land-board, and nothing to desire beyond their present rights. But, on their sea-board, they are open to injury, and they have there too, a Commerce which must be protected. This can only be done by possessing a respectable Body of Citizen-seamen, and of Artists and Establishments in readiness for shipbuilding.  
Were the Ocean, which is the common property of all, open to the Industry of all, so that every person and vessel should be free to take employment wherever it could be found, the United States would certainly not set the example of appropriating to themselves, exclusively, any portion of the common stock of occupation. They would rely on the enterprise and activity of their Citizens for a due participation of the Benefits of the seafaring Business, and for keeping the marine class of Citizens equal to their object. But if particular nations grasp at undue shares, and more especially, if they seize on the means of the United States to convert them into aliment for their own strength, and withdraw them entirely from the support of those to whom they belong, defensive and protecting measures become necessary on the part of the nation whose marine resources are thus invaded; or it will be disarmed of it’s defence; it’s productions will lie at the mercy of the nation which has possessed itself exclusively of the means of carrying them, and it’s politics may be influenced by those who command it’s Commerce. The carriage of our own Commodities, if once established in another Channel, cannot be resumed in the moment we may desire. If we lose the Seamen and Artists, whom it now occupies, we lose the present means of marine Defence, and time will be requisite to raise up others, when disgrace or losses shall bring home to our feelings the Error of having abandoned them. The materials for maintaining our due share of navigation, are ours in abundance. And, as to the mode of using them, we have only to adopt the principles of those who thus put us on the defensive, or others equivalent and better fitted to our Circumstances.  
The following principles, being founded in reciprocity, appear perfectly just, and to offer no cause of complaint to any Nation.  
  
1. Where a Nation imposes high Duties on our productions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be proper for us to do the same by theirs, first burthening or excluding those productions which they bring here, in  
competition with our own of the same kind; selecting next such manufactures, as we take from them in greatest quantity, and which at the same time we could the soonest furnish to ourselves, or obtain from other Countries; imposing on them duties, lighter at first, but heavier and heavier afterwards, as other channels of supply open. Such duties having the effect of indirect encouragement to domestic Manufactures of the same kind, may induce the Manufacturer to come himself into these States, where cheaper subsistence, equal laws, and a vent of his wares, free of duty, may ensure him the highest profits from his skill and Industry. And here, it would be in the power of the State-Governments to co-operate, essentially, by opening the resources of encouragement which are under their controul, extending them liberally to Artists in those particular Branches of manufacture, for which their Soil, Climate, Population, and other Circumstances, have matured them and fostering the precious efforts and progress of household manufacture by some patronage suited to the nature of it’s objects, guided by the local informations they possess and guarded against abuse by their presence and attentions. The oppressions on our agriculture in foreign ports would thus be made the occasion of relieving it from a dependence on the Councils and conduct of others, and of promoting Arts, Manufactures, and Population, at home.  
2.Where a nation refuses permission to our Merchants and Factors to reside within certain parts of their Dominions, we may, if it should be thought expedient, refuse residence to theirs in any and every part of ours, or modify their transactions.  
3. Where a Nation refuses to receive in our vessels any productions but our own, we may refuse to receive, in theirs, any but their own productions. The first and second clauses of the Bill reported by the Committee, are well formed to effect this object.  
4. Where a Nation refuses to consider any Vessel as ours, which has not been built within our territories, we should refuse to consider as theirs, any vessel not built within their territories.  
5. Where a Nation refuses to our Vessels the carriage even of our own productions, to certain Countries under their domination, we might refuse to theirs, of every description, the carriage of the same productions to the same Countries. But as Justice and Good neighborhood would dictate that those who have no part in imposing the restriction on us should not be the victims of measures adopted to defeat it’s effect, it may be proper to confine the restriction to Vessels owned or navigated by any subjects of the same dominant power, other than the Inhabitants of the Country to which the said productions are to be carried. And to prevent all inconvenience to the said Inhabitants, and to our own, by too  
sudden a check on the means of transportation, we may continue to admit the Vessels marked for future exclusion, on an advanced tonnage, and for such length of time only, as may be supposed necessary to provide against that inconvenience.  
The establishment of some of these principles by Great Britain, alone, has already lost us in our Commerce with that Country and it’s possessions, between eight and nine hundred Vessels of near 40,000 Tons burthen, according to statements from official materials, in which they have confidence. This involves a proportional loss of Seamen, Shipwrights, and Shipbuilding, and is too serious a Loss to admit forbearance of some effectual Remedy.  
It is true we must expect some inconvenience in practice, from the establishment of discriminating duties. But in this, as in so many other cases, we are left to chuse between two Evils. These inconveniencies are nothing, when weighed against the loss of wealth, and loss of Force, which will follow our perseverance in the Plan of indiscrimination. When once it shall be perceived that we are either in the System, or the Habit, of giving equal advantages to those who extinguish our Commerce and Navigation by Duties and Prohibitions, as to those who treat both with Liberality and Justice, Liberality and Justice will be converted by all into Duties and Prohibitions. It is not to the Moderation and Justice of others, we are to trust for fair and equal access to market with our productions, or for our due share in the transportation of them; but to our own means of independence, and the firm will to use them. Nor do the inconveniencies of discrimination merit consideration. Not one of the nations beforementioned; perhaps, not a commercial Nation on Earth, is without them. In our case, one distinction alone will suffice; that is to say, between Nations who favor our productions and Navigation, and those who do not favor them. One set of moderate Duties, say the present Duties, for the first, and a fixed advance on these, as to some Articles, and Prohibitions as to others, for the last.  
Still it must be repeated that friendly Arrangements are preferable with all who will come into them; and that we should carry into such Arrangements all the Liberality and Spirit of accomodation which the nature of the Case will admit.  
France has, of her own accord, proposed Negotiations for improving, by a new Treaty on fair and equal principles, the commerical relations of the two Countries. But her internal disturbances have hitherto prevented the prosecution of them to effect, though we have had repeated assurances of a continuance of the disposition.  
Proposals of friendly arrangement have been made on our part, by the present Government, to that of Great Britain, as the Message states:  
but, being already on as good a footing in Law, and a better in Fact, than the most favored nation, they have not, as yet, discovered any disposition to have it meddled with.  
We have no reason to conclude that friendly arrangements would be declined by the other Nations, with whom we have such commercial intercourse as may render them important. In the meanwhile, it would rest with the Wisdom of Congress to determine whether, as to those Nations, they will not surcease exparte Regulations, on the reasonable presumption that they will concur in doing whatever Justice and Moderation dictate should be done.

Our Navigation cepending on tfu:  
fame commerce, will appear by tha fol­  
lowing (latement of the tonnage of our  
vellels, entering in our ports, from thofe  
fcveral nations, and their potfeflions, in  
one year, that is to fay, from October  
1789, to September 1790, inclufrve, as

Of our commercial objeff#, Spain re­  
ceives favourably, our bread ftuif, falted  
fith, wood, fhipsj tar, pitch, and turpen­  
tine. On our meals, however, as well  
as on thofe ol other foteign countries,  
when re-exported to their colonies, they  
have lately impofed duties, of from half  
a dollar, to two dollars the barrel, the  
duties being fo proportioned to the cur­  
rent price of their own P. uir, as that  
both together, are to make the con­  
ftantfum of nine dollars per barrel.  
&#x27;ITiey do not difcourage our rice, pot  
and pearl afh, falted provifions, or whale  
m 1 : but thefe articles, being in fmall  
den.and at their markets, are carried  
thither but in a fmall degree. Their  
demand for riee, however, is increafmg.  
Neither tobacco, nor indigo are receiv­  
ed there. Our commerce is permitted  
with their Canary Illands, under the  
lame conditions.  
I Themfelves and their colonies are the  
  
j a&amp;ual confcimers of what they receive  
| froiii us.1  
Our navigation is free with the king■  
dam of -Spain ; foreign goods being re­  
ceived there in our Ihips, on the lame  
conditions 33 if carried in their own, or  
in the veflels of the country of which  
Inch goods are the m ami fa ft ure or pro­  
duce.  
Portugal receives favourably our  
grain, and bread, falted fifli and. other  
falted prtivilions, wood, tar, pitch, and  
turpentine.  
Frtr flax feed, pot, and pearl afh,  
though not difcouraged, there is little  
demand.  
Our fhips pay twenty per cent, on  
| being fold to their fubjefts, and are  
then free bottoms. , ,• . , .  
Foreign goods (except thofe of the  
Eaft-ludies) are received on the fame  
footing in our veflels, as in their own,  
or any others ; that is to fay, on general  
dh&#x27;ies of from twenty to twenty-eight  
per cent, tind, tonfequeutiy, our naviga­  
tion is unobftrufted by them. Tobac­  
co, rice,and meals, are prohibited.  
Tkern felves and their colonies con­  
furne .what they receive from us.  
Thefe regulations extend to the A -  
zores, Madeira,-and the Cape dc Verd  
1 (lands, except, that in thefe, meal&#x27;s and  
rice, are received freely.  
France receives favourably our bread­  
fin ft&quot;, rice, wOod, pot and pearl afnes.  
A duty of five fous the kental, or  
nearly four and an half cents, is paid  
on our tar, pitch and turpentine. Our  
whale oils pay fix Kvres the kental, and  
are the only foreign whale-oils admit­  
ted. Our indigo pays five livres the  
keiltal ; their own ;two and an half:  
but a difference of quality, itill more  
than a difference of duty, prevents its  
feeking that market.  
Salted beet is received freely for re­  
exportation y but if for home confump­  
tion, it pays five livres the kental.  
Other falted provifions pay that duty  
in all&#x27;cafes, and falted filh is made late­  
ly to pay the prohibitory one of twenty &#x27;  
livres the kental.- •  
Our ihips arc free to tarty thither all  
foreign goods, which may be carried in  
their own, or any othei vcffels, except  
tobaccoes not of our own growth : and  
they participate with theirs the exclu­  
five carriage of our whale-ous, and  
tobaccoes.  
During their fohrSer government, our  
tobacco was under a monopoly, but  
paid no duties; and our fhips were free­  
ly fold in their ports, and converted into  
national bottoms. The ftrft national af  
femb&#x27;ly took from ctir jfhips this privilege.  
They emancipated tobacco from itp mo­  
nopoly, but fukie&amp;cd it to duties of  
eighteen livres fifteen fous tile kental,  
carried in their own veflels, and twent)r­  
fivt livres, carried in ours ; a difference  
more than equal to Che freight of the  
article.  
They and their colonies confume  
what they receive from us.  
Great-Britain receives our pot and  
pearl allies, free, while thofe of other  
nations pay a duty of two fhillings and  
three pence the kental. There is an  
equal diftitieVion in favour of our bar­  
iron ; of which article, however we. do  
: not produce enough for our own ufe.  
Woods are free, iron, us, wljiift they  
p?y fome fmall duty from other con -  
tries. Indigo and flax feed, are free  
from all countries. Our tar and pitch  
pay, eleven pence fterling the barrel.  
From other alien countries, they pay  
about a penny and a third more.  
Our tobacco, for their own confump­  
ticfn, pays Is. 3d fterling the pound, cuf­  
tom and excite, belides&#x27; heavy expellees  
of collection. And rice, in the fame  
cafe, pafs 7s. 4d fterling the hundred  
weight; which, rendering it too dear,  
as ail article of common lood, it is con­  
fecjuently, ufed in very fmall quantity.  
Onr falted filh, and other provifions,!  
except bacon, arc prohibited. Bacon  
and whale-oils are under prohibitory du­  
ties : fo are our grains, meals, and bread  
as to internal confumption unlefs in times  
of fuch fcarcitv as may raife the price of  
wheat to $Qs. fterling the quarter, and  
other grains and mesfls in pi oportiori. !  
Onr fliips, though purchafed and navi- &#x27;  
gated by their own fabjetts, are not per- j  
mitted to be nfed, even in their trade  
with us.  
While the veflels of other nations are  
fecured by Handing laws, which cannot  
be altered, but by the concurrent will  
of the three branches of the Britiih le­  
giflature, in carrying thither any pro­  
duce or matiufa£lure of the country to  
which they belong, which may be law­  
fully carried in any veflels, ours, with  
the fame prohibition of what is foreign,  
are further prohibited by a Handing  
law (12. Gar. 2. 18. f. 3.) from car­  
rying thither all and any of our own do­  
mefttc produ&amp;ioris and manufa&amp;ures.  
A fubfequent aft, indeed, has autho­  
rifed their executive to permit the car­  
riage of our own ppoduftions in our own  
bottoms, at its fole difcretion : and the  
permiflion has been given from year to  
year by proclamation ; but fubjeft every  
moment to be withdjawn on that An­  
gle will, in which event, our veflels hav­  
ing any thing on board, ftand interdift­  
ed From the entry of all Britifli poits.  
The diftidvantage of tenure which may

Thegreater part of what they receive  
f&gt;&#x27;om Us is re-exported to other coun­  
tries, tinder the -u felefs eii arges ot an in­  
■t&#x27;*r&#x27;.\ &#x27;diate depofit, and double voyage.  
F*forn ft&#x27;iles pablifhed in England, and  
•compofed as is faid, from the books of  
their cuflom-houfes, it appears that of  
the &#x27;indigo k-.ported there in; che -years  
\ 77$***i——5, one third was re-exported.;  
and from a document of authority, we j  
learn, that, of the &quot;ice and tobacco im­  
ported there before the war, tour-fifths  
vere re-ex&quot;or.ted. &quot;We are af&#x27; are J in­  
cked,. that the quantities fent thither for  
•-v-xport itioii&#x27; tiucc the war, are • cou­  
iidei ab!) diminiik-&#x27;d, yet lei&#x27;s I&quot; than rcA­  
t &gt;n and national ihtereft would dictatc.  
The- whole of oer ,grain ,is re-exported  
*vhrn wheat k iieiow &amp;Oa, the cp-iarter,  
and other grain in proportion.  
■The&#x27;; Unit d Netherlands prohibit our  
pi&#x27;k&#x27;ed bbef and porir, meAla and bread  
of all forts, and lay a .prohibitory duty  
on fpirits difliiled from grain.  
Ail other of our productions are re­  
ceived on Varied duties, which may be  
re (ton***! ou a medium at about three  
per cent.  
They ennfume but a final 1 proportion  
of what they n*ceiye» 1. he refidue is  
partly forward jd for confumption in the  
inland puts of Kurnpf . and partly re­  
■/hipped to Other maritime -countries.  
On the bitter porti «n they intercept, be­  
tween us and the cmifmner, fo much of  
the value as i&amp; e.bforbrd by the charges  
att&quot;-.)dii;g an intermediate depobt.  
i&#x27;dre!/n goods, exc-pt fome E-ifl-In­  
dia articles, are reived in veiTels of any  
mt;»n.

Privileges) vitith fomewhat leily-n their  
&quot;value.  
i). mnark lays cohfidera&#x27;We duties on  
our tobacco and rice, -carried in their  
own yteflch, ?tftd half as much more, if  
carried in our-. ; but the ex.o,\ amount  
of thefe d&#x27;iti«B is not peikcUy khotfii  
Jlrre. They, lay fuch a?, amount ti pro­  
hibition* on our indigo and corn.  
Sweden receives favourably our grains  
and nieal.i, falted prbyiuuiw, ii&#x27;digo, and  
whale-oil.  
They fubjeft our r:ce to duties of fix­  
teen mills tli - pound weight, carried in  
their own veiTels, and of ferty per cent.  
f\dditijnvtl on that, or 22 4-10 th in ills,  
xarri d in ours, or any others. Being  
thus rendered too dear as an article of  
Tomnvm food, little ot it is continued  
-.v.ith them. They conl&#x27;ume feme of ipur  
tobacfioes, which they take circmtnoufly  
through Gi e;iu-B) itain , levying heavy  
duties on them alio ; their duties of en­  
try, town duties, and extyfe, being 4.  
24 dollars, the hundred weight, if car­  
ried in their own veiTek, and of lorty  
percent. on that additional, if earned  
in our own or any other veflels.  
They prohibit altogether our bread,  
£fh, pot and pearl-alhes, flax-leed, tar,  
pitch and turpentine, (vood (except oak  
timbir and mads) and all foreign manu­  
jaftures.  
Under fo many reflriftions and pro­  
hibitions, our navigation v/itb them is  
reduced almolt to nothing.  
With our neighbours, an order of  
things much harder prefects itfelf.  
Spain aiw-1 Portugal refufe, to thofe  
parts of America which they govern, all •  
direct inter ;ourfe with any people but  
themftdves. The commodities in mutual  
demand between-them and their neigh­  
bours, mvift be earned to be ejscbanged  
in fome port of the dominant country ;  
and the. traufportation between that and  
th£ fubject ilate mint be in a doSaeltic  
•bottom.  
France, by a (landing law, permits her  
Weft-India poffefu &gt;ns to receive dired­  
ly our vegetables., live pro%i&#x27;uons, borfes,  
wood, tar, pitch and turpentine, rice and  
maize, and prohibits our other bread­  
fluffs ; but. a fufpeniion of this probibi- ;  
tiou having been left to the colonial le­  
giil.tturcs, in times of fcarfity, it was  
formerly fufpevnded occafioually, but lat­  
terly without interruption.  
Our fifh and faked provisions (except  
pork) are received iu their iflands under  
a duty of thrcf. colonial livres the kental,  
and our veiTels are as free as their own to  
carry our commodities thither, and to  
bring away rum and molafFes.  
Great-Britain admits in her iflands,  
our vegetables, live provisions, horfes, j  
wood, tar, pitch and turpentine, rice and ;  
bread-fluff&quot;, by a proclamation of her exe- ,  
cutive, limited always to the term of a |  
year, but hitherto renewed from year to j  
year. She prohibits our falted fifti, and ■  
other falted provifions. She does not ;  
permit our veffels to carry thither our j  
own produce.—Her veftcls alone may  
take it from us, and bring in exchange, |  
rum, molafles, fugar, coffee, cocoa-nuts, I  
ginger, and pimento. There are, indeed,  
fome freedoms in the illand of Dominica, J  
but, under fuch circumftances as to be  
little ufed by us. In the Britifli conti­  
nental colonies, and iir Newfoundland,  
all our productions are prohibited, and  
our veffels forbidden to enter their ports.  
Their governors, however, in times of 4  
  
diitrefs, hav» l»ew«r to permit a. tempo* :  
, vary importation of certain articles, in .  
; their own bottoms, but not in ours.  
i Our citizens cannot raiide us mer- !  
: chants or fadtors within any of the Bri- j  
tHJi plantations, this being expr«fsly  
! prohibited by the. fame flatute of 1-2.Car. ;  
2. C. 18, commonly called tsfee naviga­  
tion aft. !  
In the Danifh Airtertcau poffeffions, a !  
! duty of five per cent, is levied on our  
j orn, corn-meal, rice, tobacco, wood,  
I falted fdh, indigo, horfes, mules and  
: live-flock ; and of ten per cent, on our  
! (lour, falted pork and beef, tar, pitch  
j and turpentine. j  
In the American fflands ot the Unit- ,  
; ed Netherlands and Sweden, our veffels I  
| and produce are received, fubjefted to  
j duties, not fo heavy as to have been  
complained of; but they are heavier in  
the Dutch polfeffions o&#x27;rt the Conhnißt.  
To fiim up thefe relh idions, fo far as  
they are important:  
if&#x27;t. In IT, 11 rope-—  
Our brpad-lhiff is at mofl times under  
prohibitory duties in England, and cori­  
fi l.erably dutieil on iT-exportation from  
Spiiu to her colonies.  
1 Our tobaccoes are heavily dutied in  
England, Sweden and l&#x27;Vance, and pro­  
hibited ifi Spain and Poriug.ii.  
Our rice i. heavily dutied in England  
and Sweden, and prohibited in Portugal.  
Our filh and falted provilion : are pro­  
hibited in England, and under prohibi­  
tory duties in France.  
Our whale-oik are prohibited in Eng­  
land and Portugal.  
And our veffels are denied naturaliza­  
tion in Engl ami, and of late iij Ti&#x27;ance.  
2d. fn the Weft indies.  
All iuterconrfg is prohibited with  
the polfelft&#x27;ous of SoaW r.tid P irtiignl.  
Our l ilted provifions and fifh are pro­  
hb ited by England.  
Our falted pork and bjtad-suff&quot;(ex-&#x27;  
cept maize) are received unuer tempora­  
ry laws only, in the dominious of. Prance,  
and our falted fifh pays&#x27; there a weighty  
duty. &#x27;  
3d. In the article of Navigation.  
Our own carriage of our own tobacco,  
is b.eavily dutied in Sweden, a;)d lately  
in France.  
We can carry up article, - not of our  
own production, &quot;to the Britilh ports iu  
Eoropr,.  
Nor even our own produce to her  
AmeriCaw poUfffious.  
Siicb being the reftrifkinns on the  
coni:nerce and navigation of the United  
States, tb® quellion is, in what way they  
may&#x27;bell be removed, modified, or cotm­  
tej acled ?  
As to commrrcc, two methods occur,  
f. By friendly arrangements with the  
feveral nation; with whom thefe reltric­  
tions exifl i O , 2. By the feparate aft  
oi&#x27;mir own legill.ttiries for countervail­  
ing their t lkft&quot;.  
The re can be no doubt, hut that of  
thefe two, friendly arrangement is th&lt;e  
mofl eligible. Irtftead of embartafrmg ■  
commer! e under piles of regulatinglaws,  
{futie;, and prohibitions, could it be re­  
lieved from all its fhackles in all parts of  
the world—could every country be em­  
ployed ill producing that which nature  
has befl fitted it to produce, a id each  
be fr*e to exchange with others mutual  
furplufles for mutual wants, the greateit  
mafs poffi6le would then be produced of  
thofe tilings which contribute to human  
life, and human happinefs ; the numbers  
of mankind would be iircreafed, and their  
condition bettered.  
Would even a fingle nation begin  
with the United States this fyflem of  
free commerce, it would be advilable to  
; begin it with that nation ; iince it is  
one by one only, that it can be extend­  
ed at all. Where the circumflances of  
either party render it expedient to levy  
a revenue, by way of impofl, on com­  
merce, its freedom might be modified,  
in that particular, by mutual and equi­  
valent meafures, prei&#x27;erving it entire in  
all others.  
Some nations, not yet ripe for free  
commerce, in all its extent, might flill j  
be willing to mollify its reflriftions and I  
regulations for 11s in proportion to the j  
advantages which an intercourle Avith ;  
jus might offer. Particularly they may j  
concur with us in reciprocating the du- (  
tics to be levied on each fide, or in com- ,  
penfating any excefs of duty, by epai- j  
valent advantages of another nature. ;  
Our commerce is certainly of a charadter ■  
to entitle it to favour in mofl countries. !  
The commodities we offer are either ne- |  
ceffaries of life, or materials for manu- i  
fafture, or convenient fubjefts of reve- &#x27;  
nue ; and we take in exchange, either !  
manufaftures, when they have received  
; the laft finifh of art and induflry ; or ,  
&#x27; mere luxuries. Such cuflomers may rea­  
i fonably expeft welcome, and friendly -  
| treatment at every market; cuflomers &#x27;  
j too, whofe demands, increaling with  
their wealth and population, muft very  
&#x27; fhortly give full enjoyme nt to the whole  
j induflry of any nation whatever, in any  
1 line of fupply they may get into the  
| habit of calling for, from it.  
! But fhould any nation, contrary to  
our wifhes, fuppole it may better find its  
. advantage by continuing its fyflem of  
prohibitions, duties and regulations, it  
behoves us t6 proteft our citizens, their  
commerce and navigation, by counter­  
prohibitions, duties and regulations alfo.  
Free commerce and navigation are not to :  
\ be given in exchange for reflriftions and  
  
i vexations; nor are they likely to pro­  
duce a relaxation of them.  
j Our navigation involves ft ill higher  
tonliderations. As a fcrmn.li of indu(hy,  
I if is valuable ; but, as a refource of de­  
finite, elfential.  
j Its value, as a branch of induftry, is  
. inhanced by the dependence of fo many  
! other branches on it. 111 times ol&#x27;gene­  
: ral peace it multiplies competitors for  
employment in tranfportation, and fo  
keeps that at &quot;its proper level ; and in  
times of war, that is to fay, when thofe  
nations who may be onr principal carri­  
eis, lb all be at war with each other, if  
! we have not within ourlelves the means  
; of tranfportation, our produce mull be  
; exported in belligerent vet .Vis at the in­  
crea fed ex pence of war-ii eiglu: and in­  
furance, and the .articles which&#x27;wo-H not  
bear that, inuft perifh on our hands.  
•But it is as a itToulce for defence that,  
our navigation will admit neither neglect.  
110 V forbearance. The-polition and cir­  
cumstances ot the United States leave  
them nothing to fear on their land-board,  
and nothing to deiire beyond their pre.-  
&#x27; lent rights. But, on their &#x27;ea-bo&#x27;.trd,  
they are open .to injury, and they have  
there too a commerce which mult be pro­  
tected. This can only be done by pof­  
feffing a body of citiv.en-leamen, and of  
a»*tilts and eltablifnmcdts in readinefs for  
lliip building-.  
Were the occa:l, which is the Com­  
mon property-sf all, open to theindudry  
of all, i&#x27;o&#x27;that every perl&#x27;on &amp; veffel Ihou&#x27;d  
be free to take employment wherever it  
cori&#x27;d be found, the United States would  
certainly not let the exam pie* of   
priating to t&#x27;nemfelves, exclulively, any  
portion of the common flock of occupa­  
tion. They would rely Oil the rnttr­  
prize and at&#x27;eivity of theircitisens for a  
due participation of tire benefits of the  
feaf.&#x27;.ring bulinefs, and for keeping the  
mai ins clafs of citizens equal to their ob­  
p&#x27;dt. But if particular nations grafp at  
(.mdir; fh irts, and more efpecially, if they  
feifcj on the means of tjie United States  
to convert them into&#x27;aliment for their  
own iirength, and withdraw them entire­  
ly from the fupport of thofe to whom  
they belong, defertlive and protedting  
meafures become neceffary on the part  
of th* nation whole marine resources  
are thus invaded, or it will be difarmed  
i of its defence ; its productions will lie  
at th ■ mercy of the nation which has  
pbflVfied itfelf i xclufnely of the means  
of can v&#x27;ing. them, and its politics may  
be influenced by thofe who coillmand its  
commerce. &#x27;I lie carriage of our own  
commodities, if once eflablilhcd in ano­  
ther channel, cannot be, refnmed in the  
moment we may deiire. If we lofe the  
feamen and artiP.s, whom it now occu­  
pies, we lofe the prefent means of ma­  
rine deffence, and time will be requifite  
to raife up other-;, when difgrace or  
lolTrs (hall bi ing horns to our feelings the  
error of having abandoned them. The  
materials for maintaining our due (hare  
of navigation, are ours in abundance ;  
and, ar; to the mode of ufing them, we  
have only to adopt the principles of thofe  
who thus pus us oti the deiVnlive, or  
others, equivalent and better fitted to  
our circumftanccs

( Concluded.)  
The following principles, being found­  
ed in reciprocity, appear perfe&amp;ly juft,  
and to offer no c&amp;ufe of complaint to any  
nation.  
1 ft. Where a nation impofes high du- .  
ties on our productions, or prohibits  
them altogether, it may be proper for  
us to do the fame by theirs, flrfl burthen­  
ing or excluding thole produttions which  
they bring here, in competition with our  
ov/n of the fame kind ; felefting next  
fuch manufaftures as we take from them  
ifi greateft quantity, St which at the fame  
time we tcwld the i&#x27;ooncft furnidi to our­  
felves, cr obtain from other countries ;  
impoling oft them duties, lighter at firll,  
but heavier and heavier afterwards, as  
other channels of fnpply open.&#x27; Such  
duties hav&#x27;ing the effect of indirect ch-  
Couragement to domellic manufactures  
of the fame kind, may induce the manu­  
fafturerto come himfelf into thefe ftatcs,  
where cheapcr fubiiftence, equal laws,  
and a vent of his waves, free of duty,  
may enfure him the higheft profits from  
his fkill and induftry. And here it would  
Be in the power of the liate governments  
to co-operate ellentially, by opening the  
fefources of encouragement which are  
under their control!, extending them  
liberally to artifls in thofe particular  
branches of manufacture, for v/hich their  
foil; climate, population, and other cir­  
cumßautes have matured them, and loi­  
tering the precious efforts and progrefs :  
of household manilfa£ture by fome pa­  
tronage fuiied to the nature of it 3 ob­  
jefts, guided by the local informations  
they poflels and guarded againfl abide  
by their prefence and attentions.&#x27; The  
oppfefftons on our agriculture in foreign ,  
ports would thus be made the occalion  
of relieving it frorn a de[&gt;endence on the  
councils and coilduft of others, and of  
promoting arts, manufactures and popu­  
lation at home.  
2d. Where a iUtiofl refufespermiffioft  
to our merchants and fadtors to reiide  
within certain parts of their dominions,  
we may, if it fhould be thought expe­  
dieiit, refufe rtfidente to theirs in any  
andSevery part of ours, or modify their  
trantaflions.  
3d. Where a nation reftifes to receive  
in our veflels any productions but our  
own, we may refufe to receive, in theirs,  
any but their own productions. The  
firft and fecond claufes of the bill report­  
ed by the committee, are well formed to  
effeft this objeCt.  
4th. Where a nation refufes to con­  
fider any veffe! as ours, which has not  
been built within our territories, we  
fhould refufe&#x27;to conlider as theirs, any  
veftel not built within their territories.  
sth. Where a nation retufes to our  
veflels the carriage even of our own pro­  
ductions, to certain countries under th&#x27;cir j  
domination, we might refufe to theirs,!  
of every defcription, the carriage of the .  
fame productions to the fame countries.&#x27;  
But as juftice and good neighbourhood .  
.would didtate, that thofe who have no |  
part in impofmg the relti iction on us, j  
lhoulcl not be the viCtiitis of meaiures j  
adopted to defeat its effeCt, it may be &lt;  
proper to confine the reftrietion to veflels  
owned or navigated by fubjeCts of  
the fame dominant power, other than &#x27;  
the inhabitants of the country to which j  
the laid productions are to be carried, j  
And to&#x27;prevent all inconvenience to the  
faklUnbabitunts, and to our own, by too 1  
fudden a check on the means of tranf- ,  
pwrtation, we may continue to admit the j  
vellels marked for future exclufion, on i  
an advanced tonnage, and for fuch j  
length of time only, as may be fitppol&#x27;ed  
neceffary to provide againft that incon­  
venience.  
The cftabliflrmicnt of fame of thefe  
principles by Great-Britain alone, has al­  
ready lolt us in ou&#x27;r commerce with that  
country and its poflellions,between eight  
and nine hundred vellels of near 40,000  
tons burtnen, according to ftatements  
from oliiciai materials, in which they 1  
  
MONDAY, DECEMBER 7tli, 1801.&#x27;  
  
have confidence. This involves a pro­  
, portional -lofs of fcamen, fiiip-v/rights  
1 and diip-building, and is too l&#x27;erious a  
lofs to admit forbearance of fome effec­  
tual remedy.  
It is true v/e muft expeCt fome:incon­  
venience ill priiCtice, front the eftablilh­  
mfcnt ®f difcriminatiug duties.—But in  
this, as in fo many other cafes, we are  
left to cliufe between two evils. Thefe  
inconveniences are nothing, when weigh­  
ed againft the lofs of wealth, and lofs of  
force, whfcth will follow our perfeverance  
in the pnui of indifcrimiuation. When  
once it Ihall be perceived that we are  
either in the fyftem, or the habit of giv­  
ing equal advantages to thofe who ex­  
tirtguilli our commcrce and navigation, !  
by duties and prohibitions, as to thofe  
■»rho treat both with liberality and juftiqe,  
liberality and juftice will be converted by  
all into duties and prohibitions. It i&amp;  
not to the moderation and juftice of  
others, we are to truft for a fair and  
etjual accefs to market with our produc­  
tions, or for ohr due fiiare in the trans­  
portation of them ; but to our own  
means df independence, and the firm will  
to ufe them. Nor do the inconvenienccs  
of discrimination merit confederation.  
Not one of the nations before mention­  
ed, perhaps not a coinmcrcial nation on  
earth, is without them. In our cafe,  
one diftinCtion alone will fuffice, that is  
to fay, between nations who favor our 1  
productions and navigation, and thofe 1  
who do not favor them. One fet of mo­  
derate duties, lay the prefentduties, for ■  
the firft, and a fixed advance 011 thefe, as 1  
to fome articles, arid prohibitions as to 1  
others, for the laft. j i  
Still it muft be repeated that friendly ]  
arrangements are preferable with all who  
will come into them ; and that we fhould  
carry into fuch arrangements all the li­  
berality and fpirit of accommodation,  
which the nature of the cafe will admit.  
France has, of her own accord propof- ]  
ed negociations for improving, by a new ]  
treaty, on fair.and equal principles, the i  
commercial relations of the two coun- (  
triej. But her internal difturbances have 1  
hitherto prevented the profecution of ,  
them to effect, though we have had re- j  
peatcd aflurances of a continuance of the ■  
difpofition. (  
Propofals of friendly arrangement have •  
been made 011 our part, by the prefent j  
government, to that of Great-BriuSui, aS •  
the mefTage ftatcs : but, being already 011 (  
as good a footing in law, and a better ]  
in faCt, than the moft favored nation, ■  
they have not as yet, difcovered any clif- ]  
,polition to have it meddled with. , 1  
We have no reafon to conclude   
friendly arrangeriients would be declin­  
ed by the other nations, with whom v/e   
have fuch commercial intercourfe as may ]  
render them important. 111 the mean ,  
while, it would reft with the wifdom ol (  
Congrefs to determine whether, as to j  
thofe nations, they will not furceafe ex­  
parte regulations on the reafonable pre­  
fumption that they will concur in doing (  
whatever juftice and moderation dictate ]  
Ihoukl be done.

veral cases, for which these remedies are

the Governor and Council of Jamaica ; and,  
here is the remedy he proposes. “ Wher

the Americans will adopt such measures to  
the certain diminution in the amount oi

ted Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden, and  
their American pofTelfions: and the articles of  
export which conftitute the hafis of that com­  
merce, with their refpeftive amounts, are—

To defccr.d to articles of fmaller value than  
thel&#x27;e, would lead into a minutenefs of detail  
neither neccffary nor ufcful to the piefcnt ob­  
ject.  
The proportions of our Exports, which go  
to the nations before mentioned, and to their  
dominions, refpc-ffively, arc as follows:  
In 1804.

Of our I&#x27;liTmercia! SPAIN receives  
I f.ivom iliiy, our bread tteft, lulled till:, wood,  
lliips, t.ir, pitch, and turpentine. On our  
meals, however* as well fts on tbofe of other  
foreign countries, when re-exported to their co­  
lonies, tiny have lately impofed duties, of from  
half a dollar, to t wo dollars the barrel, the duties  
being fo proportioned to the current price of  
their own flour, as that lx&gt;th together, are to  
make the conflant film of nine dollars per barrel.  
They do not difcoiiragc our rice, pot and  
pearl alb, failed provisions, or whale oil ; but  
thefe articles, being in final I demand at their  
markets, are carried thither but in a fmall de­  
gree. Their demand for rice, however, is in­  
erealing. Neither tobacco, nor indigo are re­  
ceived there. Our commerce is permitted with  
their Canary 111inds, under the lame conditi­  
ons.  
Themfelvrs, and their colonies are the atfu&amp;l  
confumem &lt;&gt;f what they receive from us.  
Our navigation is free with the kingdom of  
Spain; foreign goods being received there in  
our flops, on the fi ne conditions as if carried  
in their own, or in the veflels of the country of  
which fuch goods are the manufacture or pro­  
duce.  
  
PORTUGAL receives favourably our grain,  
and bread, falted tifli and other falted provif­  
ons, wood, tar, pitch, and turpentine.  
l&#x27;or Bax-feed, pot, and pear! afh, though not  
difeouraged, there is little demand.  
Our Blips pay twenty per cent, on being fold  
to their fubjcdls, and are then free bottoms.  
Foreign goods (except thofe of the Eatt-fn­  
dies) are received on the fame footing in our  
veffels, as in their own, or any others ; that is  
to fay, on general duties of from twenty to  
twenty-eight per cent, and, confequently, our  
navigation is uftobftrudled by them. Tobacco,  
rice rind meals, are prohibited.  
Themfelvcs and their colonies confume what  
they receive from us.  
Thefe regulations extend to the Azores, Ma­  
deira, and the Cape dc VcrJ I Hands, except,  
that in thefe, meals and rice are received free­  
ly*  
FRANCE receives favourably our bread-fluff,  
rice, wood, pot and pearl nfhes.  
A duty of five foi» the kental, or nearly four  
and an half cents, is paid on our tar, pitch and  
turpentine. Our vhale-oils pay fix livres the  
kental, and are the only foreign whale-oils ad­  
mitted. Our indig&gt; pays five livres the kcntal;  
their own, two ant ail half: but a difference of  
quality ftill more than, a difference of duty,  
prevents its feckiii) that market.  
Sailed beef is received freely lor rc-cxportati­  
tion ; but if for hdnc-confumption, it pays five  
livres the kcntal. Other falted provifions pay  
that duty in all cafes, and falted fiill is made  
lately to pay the prohibitory one of twenty li­  
vres the kental.  
Our Blips arc tee to carry thither all foreign  
goods, which rruy be carried in their own, or  
any other veffels, except tobaccoes not of our  
own growth: aid they participate with theirs  
the exclufive cariagc of our whale-oils, and to­  
baccoes.  
During their firmer government, our tobac­  
co was under a nonopoly, but paid no duties ;  
and our fhips w:re freely fold in their ports,  
and converted in o national bottoms. The firft  
national affcmbly took ftom our Blips this pri­  
vilege. They enancipated tobacco from its  
monopoly, but fibjeifled it to duties of eighteen  
livres fifteen fous t\e kental, carried in their own  
veffels, and twentr-five livres, carried in ours;  
a difference more than equal to the freight of  
the article.  
They and their colonies confume what they  
receive from us.  
GREAT-BRIT\IN receives our pot and  
pearl affies, free, while thofe of other nations  
pay a duty of two Trillings and three pence the  
kental. There is m equal diftindtion in favour  
of our bar-iron ; of which article, however, we  
do not produce enough for our own ufc. Woods  
are free, from us, whilft they pay fomc fmail  
duty from other countries. Indigo and flax­  
feed, are free from all countries. Our tar and  
pitch pay eleven pence fterling the barrel.  
From other alien countries, they pay about a  
penny and a third more.  
Our tobacco, for their own confumption,  
pays 1/it fterling the pound, cuftom and excife,  
befides heavy expenfesof colle&amp;ion. And rice,  
in the fame cafe, pays 7/1 fterling the hundred  
weight ; which, rendering it too dear, as an  
article of common food, it is confequently, u­  
fed in very fmail quantity.  
Our falted fifh, and other falted provifions,  
except bacon, arc prohibited. Bacon and  
whale-oils arc under prohibitory duties : fo  
are our grains, meals, and bread, as to inter­  
nal confumption ; unitfs in times of fuch fcar­  
city as may raife the price of wheat to 50/.  
fterling the quarter, and other grains and meals  
in proportion.  
  
Our flops, though purchafcd and navigated  
by their own fubjeihs, arc not permitted to be  
ufed, even in their trade with us.  
While the veflels of other nations are fccur­  
ed by (landing laws, which cannot be altered,  
but by the concurrent will cf the three branch­  
es of the Britilh legiflature, in carrying thither  
any produce or manufacture of the country to  
which they belong, which may be lawfully  
carried in any veflels, ours, with the fame pro­  
hibition of what is foreign, are further prohi­  
bited by a (landing law (12. Car. 2. 18. $. 3.)  
from cat ryiug thither all and any of our own  
dorm-flic productions and manufactures. A  
fubfequent aCt, indeed, has authorized their  
executive to permit the carriage of our own  
productions in our own bottoms, at its foie  
diferetion ; and the permiflion has been given  
from year to year by proclamation ; but fub­  
jeCt every moment to be withdrawn on that  
fingle will, in which event, our veflels having  
any thing on board, (land interdicted from the  
entry of all Britifli ports. The difadvantnge of  
a tenure which may be fo fudden&#x27;y difeontinu*  
ed, was experienced by our merchants on- a late  
occafion,* when an official notification that this  
law would be flriCHy enforced, gave them juft  
apprehenfions for the fate of their veffels and  
cargoes difpatchec! or deftined to the ports of  
Oreat-Britain. The minifter of that court in­  
deed frankly exprelled I119 perfonal conviction  
that the words of the order went farther than  
was intended, and fo he afterwards officially in­  
formed us: but the embarraflinents of the mo­  
ment were real and great, and the pofllbility of  
their renewal, lays our commerce to that coun­  
try, under the fame fpecics of difeouragement as  
to other countries, where it is regulated by a  
fingle legiflator : and the diftinCtion is too re­  
markable not to be noticed, that our navigation  
is excluded from the fecurity of fixed laws, while  
that fecurity is given to the navigation of o­  
lliers.  
Our veffels pay in their ports 1_/?). fterling per  
ton, light and trinity dues more t{&gt;an is paid  
by Briiifh flops, except in tlie port of London,  
where they pay the fame as Jbitifii.  
The greater part of wha&lt; they receive from ]  
us i-; re-ex ported to other rountric , under the*  
u(clefs charges of an intermediate depofite, and  
double voyage. From tables publilhcd in En­  
gland ; and com poll’d as is /aid, from the books  
&gt; ftlH ireuftom-boufcs.it appears that of the in­  
digo ir.porud there in the tears 177.3,-—-I,—,s,  
one thild was rc-cx-portcd ; and from a docu­  
ment of uulhori&#x27; y, wc learn, that of the rice and |  
  
*  
tobacco imported there, before the w.ir, four  
fifths were re-expote !. We are allured indeed,  
that the quantities fent thither fin re-txp&gt; matr­  
on fince the ivar, are coufiuerahly diminiihed,  
yet lefsfu than rcafon &amp; national intcicft would  
dictate. The whole of our erain i* re-export­  
ed when wheat is below 53/ the quarter, and u­  
ther grains in proportion.  
The UNITED NETHERLANDS prohibit  
onr pickled beef and pork, meals and bread of  
all forts, and lay a proliibitary duty on fpiriis  
distilled from grain.  
Ail other of our productions are received on  
varied duties, which may be reckoned, on a  
medium at about three per cent,  
Theyconfume but n finall proportion of what  
they receive. The refidue is partly forwarded  
for enufumption in the inland parts of Europe,  
and partly re-lhipped to other maritime coun­  
tries. Clin the latter portion they intercept, be­  
tween us and the confmner lb much of the value  
as is abforbed by the charges attending an in­  
termediate depofite.  
Foreign goods, except fome Eaft-India arti­  
cles, are received in vclfels of any nation.  
Oar fliips may be fold and naturalized there,  
with exceptions of one or two privileges, which  
(umewhat lelfim their value.  
DENMARK lays eonfiderahle duties on our  
tobacco and rice, carried in their own vefiVIs,  
and half as much more, if carried in ours ; but  
the exaCt amount of thefe duties rr. not perfectly  
known here. They lay fuch as .uuount to pro­  
hibitions on our indigo and corn.  
SWEDEN receives favourably our grains and  
meals, falted provifions, indigo, and whale-oil.  
They fubjeCt our rice to duties of fixteen mills  
the pound weight, carried in their own vefieb&#x27;,  
and of forty per cent additional on that, or 22  
4-10 milij, rallied in ours, or anyotheis. Be­  
ing thus rendered foo dear as an article of com­  
mon food, little of it is confumed with them.  
They confume fome of our tobaccoes, which  
they take circuitoufiy through Great-Britain ;  
levying heavy dut;rs on them alfo ; their duties  
of entry, town duties, and exeife, being 4.31  
dollars, the hundred weight, if carried in their  
own veflfels, and of forty per cent on that ad­  
ditional, if carried in our own or anv other vel­  
fels.  
They prohibit altogether our bread, fifli, pot  
and pearl allies, flax-feed, tar, pilch, and tur­  
pentine, wood, (except oak timber and malt*}  
and all foreign manufactures.  
Under fo many rcftriCtions and prohibitions,  
our navigation with them is reduced almofi. to  
nothing.  
With our neighbours, an order of tilings much  
harder prefents itfelf.

Of the Secretary of State, on tie Privileges and  
Ref rations on lie Commerce of tie United  
States in Foreign Countries.  
fccNCLvnun.]  
With our neigbours, an order of things much |  
harder nrefciits ilfelf.  
SPAIN and PORTUGAL refufe, to thofe  
parts of America wliich they govern, all direct  
intercourfe with any people&#x27;but themfdves.  
Tiie commodities in mutual demand, between  
them and their neighbours, mnft he carried to  
be exchanged in fomc port of the dominant  
country ; and the tranfportation between that  
and the fubjc&lt;5t-ftate mult be in adomeilic bot­  
tom.  
FRANCE by a Handing law, permits her W.  
India oofiefiions to receive directly our vegeta­  
bles, live provifions, horfes, wood, tar, pitch,  
and turpentine, rice, and maize, and prohibits  
onr other bread-fluff: but a fufpenfion of this  
prohibition having been left to the colonial !c­  
gifixtures, in times of fcarcity, it was formerly  
fufpended occafionally, but latterly without in-1  
lerruption.  
Our filh and falted provifions (except pork)  
are received in their iflmds under a duty of  
three colonial livres the kcntnl, and our veffcls  
arc as free as their own to carry commodities  
thither, and to bring away ruin and tnolafTes.  
GREAT-BRITAIN admits in her ifiands,  
our vegetables, live provifions, liorfes, wood,  
tar, pitch, and turpentine, rice, and bread-fluff,  
by a proclamation ofhtr executive, limited al­  
wavs to the term of a year, but hitherto renew­  
ed from year to year. She prohibits onr falted  
filh, and other filtcd provifions. She does not  
permit our vefiels io carry thither ourowti pro­  
duce. Her vcfills alone, may take it from uk,  
ami bring in exchange, rum,” molafles, fugar,  
coffee, cocoa-nuts, ginger, and pimento. There  
are, indeed, feme freedoms in the ifland of Do­  
minica, but, under fuch circumfiances, as to be  
little ufed by us. In the Britifh continental co­  
lonics, and in Newfoundland, all our producti­  
ons are prohibited, and our vc.Tels forbidden to  
enter their ports. Their governors, however,  
in times of difirefs, have power to permit a tem­  
porary importation of certain articles, in their  
own bottoms, blit not in ours.  
Our citizens cannot refide as merchants or  
factors within any of the Britilb plantations,  
this being exprefsly prohibited by the fame fta­  
tutc of 12. Car. 2. u. 18, commonly called the  
navigation aft.  
In the DANISII-AMERICAN poff ITions, a  
duty of five per cent, is levied on our corn, corn­  
naeal, rice, tobacco, wood, falted fi&#x27;h, indigo,  
horfes, mules, and live Hock ; and often per  
cent, on our flour, falted pork, and beef, tar,  
pitch, and turpentine.  
In the American i{lands of the UNITED  
NE j HERLANDS and SWEDEN, our vefiels  
and produce are received, fubjedl to duties, not  
lo heavy as to have been complained of&#x27;: but  
they are heavier in the Dutch poffdiions on the  
continent.  
  
To fum up thefe Restrictions, fo far as  
they are important:  
i ft. Is Europe—  
4 _ Our bread-fluff in at moff times under prohi­  
bitory duties in England, and confiderabiy tin­  
tied on re-exportation from Spain to her &quot;colo­  
nics.  
^ Our tobaccnes are heavily dutied in England,  
“&quot;&quot;&quot;Sweden and France, and prohibited in Spain,  
anti Portugal.  
Our rice is heavily dutied in England and  
Sweden, and prohibited in Portugal.  
Our fifh and falted provilions arc prohibited  
in England* and under prohibitory duties in  
France.  
Our whale-oils are prohibited in England and  
Portugal.  
And our veffcls are denied naturalization in  
England, and of late in Prance.  
2d. In the West-Indies.  
All intercourfe is prohibited with the pofTef­  
fions of Spain, and Pori ugal.  
Our falted provifions and fifh are prohibited  
by England.  
Our falted pork, and bread-fluff (except  
maize) arc received under temporary laws only,  
in the dominions of France, and our falted filh  
pays there a weighty duty.  
3d. In the Article of Navigation.  
Our own carriage of our own tobacco, is hea­  
J vily dutied in Sweden, and lately in France.  
P WV can carry no article, not of our own pro­  
duction, to the Britifh ports in Europe.  
Nor even our own produce to her American  
l- pofleflions.  
Such being the reftriftions on the commerce  
and navigation of the United States, the quefti­  
s on i.,, in what way they may bell be removed,  
modified, or counteracted ?  
As to commerce, two methods occur. 1. By  
4 friendly arrangements with the fevira! nations  
with whom thefe reftriClions exift : Or, 2. By  
the feparate aCt of our own legifluturcs for coun­  
tervailing their cffcCts.  
There can be no doubt, but that ofthefe two,  
friendly arrangement is the mofl eligible. In­  
field of embarraffing commerce under piles of  
regulating laws, duties, and prohibitions, could  
it be relieved from all its (hackles in all parts of  
the world—could every country be employed  
in producing that which nature hr.s be ft fitted  
it to produce, and each be free to exchange with j  
others mutual furoluffcs, for mutual wants, the  
g reate ft mafs poffible would then be produced  
of tbc.fe things which contribute to human life,  
and human happinefs j the numbers of mankind j  
would be incrcafed, and their condition better­  
ed.  
Would even a Angle nation begin with the U­  
nited States this fyftcm of free&#x27;commerce, it  
would beadvifable to begin it with that nation ;  
fin -c it is one by one only, that it can he extend­  
ed to all. Where the circumfr.inccs of either  
P &#x27;rty render it expedient to levy a revenue, bv  
way of imp- ft, on commerce, its freedom might  
be modi fit d, in that particular, by mutual and  
equivalent meafures, prcLrving it entire in all  
others.  
L Com na*ions, not yet ripe for free commerce,  
f In i&quot; it*&lt; xtent, migt t ftill be willin; to m llify  
its reftriflions and regulations for tld in p. ,por­  
tion to the advantages, which an intercourfe  
with us might offer. Particularly they may  
&#x27; concur with us in reciprocating the duties t.» bi  
levied on each fide, or in compenfatiug any ex  
1 cef* of duty, bv equivalent advantages of ano-1  
the, nature. Our commerce ij certainly «&gt;f a i  
cl«. ratlcr to entitle it to favour la rnoft conn-1  
tries. The commodities we offer, arc either  
Lecrflarie of life, or materi-.U f..r maiiiifaiftnre ; &#x27;  
01 convenient fubj of revenue : and we take I  
iu exchange,, citiur mannfafltires, when they!  
have received the laft f.niih of art ami irxluftry ;  
or me; c lux ai ics. Such cuftnmrrg may redo 1­  
a »ly exp. fi tv. Ico tie, ami friendly treatment at,  
c very mark’1 : cuftomcra loo, w!j.&gt;fo demands,  
if.erc«fi tg w.th tl.cir vvialiu, and population,;

li.u. of f m !y th.y m,.y get into the haiiit of  
CaHii.tf f,-.. fro. .it.  
I But flioniii a. v ua ion, contrary In our wilb­  
e . f.rypnii •; may bettt r fiml its advantage r»y  
eoulitiuiug its o» j&gt;,ohihuumr, duties, &#x27;  
  
if cl regulations, ?f behove! »n tonrofeft mjr ci­  
tizens, their commerce and navigation, 1 y coun­  
ter-prohibitions, duties, and regulations alfo.  
foce commerce arrl navigation arc not to be  
given in exchange for rvltrfolions, and vexati­  
ons ; nor arc they likely to produce a relaxati­  
on of them.  
Our navigation involves ft 11! higher conficlcr­  
atiors. As a branch erf induftry. it is valuable;  
but, ns a ref &gt;urce of nee, efTential.  
Its value, as a branch of induftry, is inhanced  
by the dependence of fo many other branches  
on it. In times of general peace it multiplies  
competitors for employment in tranfport.iliou,  
and fo Veeps tint at its proper level; ami in  
times of war, that is to fay, when thofe nations  
who may be our principal carriers, (hall be at  
war with each other, if we have not within our­  
fe-lvrs the means of tranfportation, our produce  
mull be exported in belligerent veficls at the in­  
created expcnce of war-freight ami infnrance.  
ami the articles which will not bear that, inuft  
perifh on our hands.  
But it i« a refourcc for defence that our navi­  
gation will admit neither neglect nor forbear­  
ance. The polition and circumftancea cf the  
United States leave them nothing to fear on the ir  
land-board, and nothing to delire beyond their  
prefent right s. But, on their fen-board, they  
are open to injury, ami they have there too, a  
commerce which mull be protected. This can  
only be done by poHelfing a rrfpcilablc body  
of citizen-feamcn, and cf artifts and ifiablifh­  
ments in rcadinefs f- r fttip building.  
V,Tere the ocean, which is the common pro­  
perty of ail, open to the induftry of all, fo that  
every perfon and veiled (hould be free to take  
employment wherever it could be found, the j  
United States would certainly not let the ex­  
ample of appropriating to themfebes, cxclu­  
fively, any portion of the common (lock of oc­  
cupation. They would rely on the enterprise  
and ailivity of their citizens for a due partici­  
pation of the benefits of the fea-faring bufiiiefs,  
and for keeping the marine clafs of citizens e­  
qital to their object. But if particular nations  
grafp at undue 111 a res, and more cfpecially, if  
they feizcon the means c&gt;f the United States to  
convert them into aliment for thi ir own  
ftrength, and withdraw them entirely from the  
fupport of thofe to whom they belong, defen­  
five and protecting meafures become r.ccefl&#x27;ary  
on the part of the nation whofe marine refottr­  
ces are thus invaded, or it will be difarmed of  
itsdcfcnce; its productions will lie at the mer­  
cy of the nation which has pofTelTcd itfelf ex­  
cliilively of the means of carrying them, and its  
politics may be influenced by thofe who com­  
mand its commerce. The carriage of cur own  
commodities, if once eftablilhed in an other  
channel, cannot be refumed in the moment we  
may difire. If we lofe the fcamen and artifts,  
whom it now occupies, we lofe the prifent  
means of marine defence, and time will be rc­  
quifite to raife up others, when disgrace or Ioff­  
es Ihall bring home to our feelings the error of  
having abandoned them. The materials for  
maintaining our due fliare of navigation, are  
ours in abundance ; and, as fo the mode of u­  
fi&#x27;ig them, we iiave only to adopt the principles  
of thofe who tints put us on the defenfive, or  
others, equivalent and better fitted to our cir­  
cumftances.  
  
The following principles, being founded in j  
reciprocity, appear perfectly juft, and to offer  
no caufe of complaint to any nation.  
lft. Where a nation impofes high duties on  
our productions, or prohibits them altogether,  
it may he proper for us to do the fame by theirs,  
firft burthening or excluding thofe productions  
which they bring here, in competition with our  
own of the fame kind ; felefting next fuch ma­  
nufactures a3 we take from them in greateft  
quantity, and which at the fame time we could  
the fooneft furnifh to ourfelves, or obtain from  
cither countries; impofing on them duties,  
lighter at firft ; but heavier and heavier after­  
wards, as other channels of fupply open. Such  
duties having the effect of indirect encourage­  
ment to domeftie manufactures of the fame  
kind, may induce the manufacturer to come  
himfelf into tbefe ftates, where cheaper fubfift.­  
ene»-, equal laws, and a vent of his wares, free  
of duty, tnav enfure him the higheft profits from  
his (kill and induftry. And here it would be  
in the power of the ftate governments to co-o­  
perate effentially, by opening therefources of  
encouragement which are under their controul,  
extending them liberally to artifts in thofe par­  
ticular branches of manufacture, for which their  
foil, climate, population, and other circumftan­  
c es, have matured them, and fofteriujf the pre­  
cious eliorts and progrefs of boujcbold inanu­  
faflure by fomc patronage fuited to the nature  
of its objects, guided by the local informations  
they poifefs, and guarded againfl abufe by their  
prefence and attentions. The oppreflions on  
our agriculture in foreign ports would thus he  
made the occafion of relieving it from a depend­  
ence on the councils and conduct of others, and  
of promoting arts, manufactures, and populati­  
on at home.  
2d. Whcrea nation refufes permiftion to our  
merchants and factors to refide within certain  
parts of their dominions, we may, if it fhould  
be thought expedient, refufe refidenceto theirs  
in any and every part of ours, or modify their  
tianfactions.  
»d. Where a nation refufes fo receive in our  
vt-.Tels any productions hut our own, we may  
refufe to receive, in theirs, any but their own  
productions. The firft and fecond claufes of  
the bill reported by the committee, are well  
formed to effect this object.  
4th. Where a nation refufes to confidcr any  
vt&#x27;ffc3 ns ours, w&gt; icli has not been built within  
our territories, we fit on Id refufe to confidcr ah  
theirs, any veffel not built within their territo­  
ries.  
ith. Where a nation refufes to our veffds  
the carriage even of our own productions, to  
certain countries under their domination, we  
might refuf: to theirs, of every deferiptiou, the  
carriage of the fame productions to the fame  
i countries. Hut as juftice and good nt-ighbmir­  
j hcod would dictate, that thofe who have no  
| part in impofing the reft rid ion on us, fimuld  
j not he the vidirr.3 of meafi.rrs adopted to do  
! feat it; effect, it may be proper t&lt;* r.mRn. ,t...  
j rrftriction to vt.Tds owned or navigated by an’*  
, fnbjeds of the fame dominant power, other  
j than the inhabitants of the country to which  
j tli. laid productions are to be carried. And to  
j prevent all inconvenience to the faid inhabi­  
j taut1, and to our own, by too Hidden a check  
j on the means of trarifportati n, we may conti­  
; nue to admit the veffds matktd for future tx­  
i elution, on an advanced tonnage, and for fitch  
1 length (*,r tone onh , as may be fuppofed ritcef  
I fare to provide ag.&#x27;inft that inconvenience,  
i lie t ft.ihlithment of feme of thefe principles  
I by Gitat-d,iti.in, alone, has already loft us in  
i our commerce with that country and its pof­  
j fv-ftions, between tight and nine hundred vel­  
fds of near 40,000 tons bin then, according to  
ftaft nents from official m iteiials, in which they  
hiv,- confidence. This involves a proportion’ll  
| i°^ feamen, iitip-wrights, and fhip-building,!  
auci is too fniousa lofs to admit fo.bearancc of  
tome effecflual remedy.  
I tiue we rmtft expert f* me inconvc itr.ee  
j in piaelicr, from the tftablifhinent of difcrirr.i*  
nati’ig clinics. Hut in this, j-j fo *na iy other  
r-ffer, we arc left to dime l.tween t«vo evils.  
: Tncfc iiJoMuc’ii&#x27;.i.cirs „.c uothiag, wh*n j  
  
weighed syninft the lofs of wcil&#x27;h, and 1 &gt;fs rf i  
furor, which will follow our ptrfcvcrnnee in the &#x27;  
plan of indiferimination. When one * it Iliad I  
he p revived that we are cither in the lyrtem, «»r ;  
the habit, of giving equal advantages to thofe  
who extinguifh our commerce and navigation,  
by duties and prohibitions, as to tin fc who  
treat both with liberality ami juftier, liberality  
and juftiee will be converted by all into duties \
and prohibitions. It is not to the moderation ;  
and juftiee of others, we are to trull for fair and j  
equal accefs to market with our productions, j  
or for our due (hare in the Iran (port a! ion of  
them; but toourown means of independence,  
am! the firm will to life them. Nor do the in.  
conveiiiencies of difcriinination merit consider­  
ation. Not one of the nations before mention­  
ed ; perhaps, not a commercial nation on earth,  
is without them. In our cafe, one diftir.Gion  
a&#x27;onc will fiifhce. that is to fay. between nations  
who favour oui &quot;.oducl ions and navigation, and  
thofe who do not favour them. One let of mo­  
derate duties, fay the prelent duties, for the  
tirll, and a fixed advance on thefe, as to fume  
articles, and prohibitions as toothers, for the  
laft.  
Still it nmft oe repeated that friendly arrange­  
[ ments arc preferable with all who will come in­  
to them 5 and ihat wo Ihould carry into f:ch j  
arrangements ali the liberality and I&#x27;pirit of nc- |  
commodation, which the nature of the cafe will ■  
admit.  
France has, of her own accord, prnpofed nc- i  
gotiations lor improving, by a new treaty on j  
fair and equal principle?, the commercial rela­  
tions of tlie two countries. Hut her internal I  
difturbances have hitherto prevented the profe­  
cutionof them to effeft, though we have had re­  
peated a durances of a continuance of the diipo­  
fition.  
Propofols of friendly arrangement have been  
made on our part, by the prefciit government, j  
to that of Great-Britain, as the meirtge dates: ;  
but, being already on as good a footing in law, j  
and a better infintt, than the moft favoured na- 1  
tion, they have not, as yet, d.{covered any tiif-1  
polition to have it meddled with. j  
We have no rcafon to conclude that friendly j  
arrangements would be declined by the other;  
nations, with whom we have fucli commercial j  
intcrcourfe as may render them important. Ini  
the mean while, it would reft with the wifdom  
of Congrcfs to determine whether, as to thofe •  
nations, they will not iurccafe exp.irte regulati-1  
ons, on tlie reafouabie prcfumptioii that they j  
will concur in doing whateverjuftice and mo-!  
deration, lhoitlJ be dene.

on is, “in what way may the. restrictions on  
t he commerce and navigation of the United  
Slates behest removed, modified and coun­  
teracted ?” It is plain, tfiat there are two  
methods which may be resorted to:. “1. By  
friendly arrangements with the several nati­  
ons with whom these restrictions exist_2.  
By the separate acts of our own legislatures  
for countei vailing their effects.”  
We agtee with the illustrious author of  
the Report of *93, that “friendly arrange­  
ment”^—(wherever it he practicable ; with  
G. B. it almost scents ridiculous to attempt  
it)—“ is the &gt;,u&gt;st eligible. Instead of em­  
barrassing commerce under piles of tegu­  
lulinglaws, duties and prohibitions, could it  
be relieved from all its shackles in all parts  
of the world, could every country be em­  
ployed in producing that which nature has  
best fitted it to produce, and each be free to  
exchange with others mutual surplusses for  
mutual wants, the greatest mass possible  
would then he produced of those things which  
contribute to human life and human happi­  
ness—the numbers of mankind would be in­  
creased and their condition bettered” Ilo

the House of Representatives, Mr. .letter­  
son, then Secretary ot State, made an  
able and highly important report, on the  
privileges and restrictions of oar com­  
merce in f.-reign countries, in which he  
s-vs—“ Our commerce is certainly of a  
character to entitle it to favor iii most  
countries. The commodities we offer are  
necessaries of life, or materials for maim- 1  
facture, or convenient subjects of reve- I  
nuc; and vve take in exchange either mu- j  
nut act ores, when they have received the  
last finish of art and industry, or mere  
luxuries. Such customers may reasona­  
bly expect welcome and friendly treat­  
ment at every market. Customers too,  
whose demands increasing with their  
wealth and population, must very shortly  
give full employment to the whole indus­  
try of any nation whatever, in any line  
of supply they may get into the habit  
ot calling for from it.”  
“ Hut should any nation, contrary to  
our wishes, suppose it may better find  
it« advantage by continuing its system of  
prohibitions, duties and regulations, it be­  
hoves us to protect our citizens, their  
commerce and navigation, by counter  
prohibitions, duties and regulations, also.  
I&#x27;ree commerce and navigation arc not to be  
Siren in exchange for restrictions and vexa­  
tion*; nor are they likely to produce u relax­  
ation of them.&quot;  
“Our navigation involves still higher  
considerations. Asa branch of industry  
it is valuable, hnt as a source of defence,  
essential.” fllow fully was this verified  
in our late war, by the brilliant achieve­  
ments ot our gallant nav v—so hohoraldi  
to our country—so glorious to our naval  
heroes !]  
Its value as a branch of industry is  
enhanced by the dependence of so man v  
  
other Inantlies on if. In times of gene­  
ral pester it multiplies competitors for em­  
ployment in transportation, and so keeps  
that at its proper level ; ami in times of  
war, that is to say, when those nations  
who may he our principal carriers shall  
he at war with each other, ifwr have not  
within ourselves the moans of transporta­  
tion, our produce must be exported in  
belligerent vessels at the increased ex  
pence of war freight and insurance, and *  
the articles which will not hear that must  
perish on our hands.”  
Hut it is as a resource of defence,  
that our navigation will admit neither  
neglect nor forbearance. The position  
and circumstances of the Tailed Slates  
leave them nothing to fear on their land  
hoard, and nothing to desire beyond  
their present rights. Hut on their sea*  
board they are open to injury, and they  
hove there, too, a commerce which must  
be protected : this can only be done by  
possessing ,\ respectable body of citizen  
seamen, and ol artists and establishments  
in readiness for ship building.

As to commerce, two modes occur. I. By friendly

Thera can bo no doubt, but that, of these two,  
friendly ormngemeut is the moat eligible. In-trad of  
rmbarnutpmg commerce under piles of regulating  
laws duties nnd prohibitions, could it be relieved from

a breach ol mJustxy, it u valuable; but m a re­  
source of defence, essential.  
Us value, as a brench of industry, is enhanced by  
lac dependence ofso many branches on it. Tn times  
of general peace it multiplies competitors for employ­  
mont in transportation, and -jo keeps that at its prop- 1  
or level, and in tunes of war—that iu to say, when !  
those uutions who may bo our principal carrier, shall j  
he at war with each other—if wo have not within our- j  
selves tho iiieans ot transportation, our produce must ;  
be exported in belligerent vessels, ut tlie increased  
expense of war freight and insurance; and tho nrti­  
olea which will not bear that niuet perish on our  
hands, hut it in as a resource of dotcuca that our  
navigation will not uxhuit of neglect or forbearance.—  
The position aud circumstaucoH of the United States ;  
li aye them nothing to tear on their land-board,and  
not.img to desire beyond their present rights. But, I  
on their fea-board, they arc ojh ii to injury, and they |  
MWtberu, too, a commerce which must bo protected.  
I his can only be done by possessing a rcsjicctable  
body of citizen seamen, and of urlists and establish- i  
inents ready for shipbuilding.  
\\ tre the occ&amp;n, which is tile common property of •  
all, open to tho industry of all, so that every person and ;  
vessel should be free to take employment&#x27;wherever it \
could he found, the l nited States would certainly not1  
set the example of appropriating to themselves, ex­  
clusively, any portion of the common stock of occu­  
pation. 1 hey would rely on tlie enterprise and activi­  
ty their citizens tor n due participation of the bene­

Suites to convert them into aliment tor their own

ing measures become necessary on the part of tho mo­  
tion whoso marine resources are thus invaded, or it

present means of marine defence, and time will be re­  
quisite to raise up others, when disgrace or losses shall  
bring h&lt;&#x27;nn* to our feelings the error of having abandon­

of navigation are our* iu abundance: and, as to the  
mode ot using them, we have only to adopt the princi­  
ples .T :bo&lt;«» who p it us on the defensive, or others  
cquivah ut an I b* Iter fitted to olir circuinstnnccs.  
The following principles, being founded iu reciproci­  
ty, appear perfectly jiiht, and to offer no cause of com­  
plaiut to anv nation.  
  
nuuoii imposes nigii duties on otlr pro­  
ductions,or prohibits them altogether, it rnuv Improper

qunn*ity, nnd which at the same time wc could soonest  
furnish to ourselves, or obtain frotii other enuntriop­  
imposiug uu them higher dutiefi at first, but heavier and  
heavier afterwards, hs other channels of supply open.  
Sufii duties having the indirect effect of enconrao-in«­  
domestic manufactures of tho mmo kind, may uidnee  
the manufacturer to come himself into these State?  
Where cheaper pubtdstenec, equal laws, and a vent of  
nte wares fro* of duty, may insure him tljc hichest pro­  
Uts from bis -kill and industry. “  
And here it will be in tho power ofthc State Gov­  
ernment* to co-operate, essentially, by openin&#x27;* the  
resources of encouragement which are under°tbeir  
control; cxiumling them liberally to artists in those  
particular brunches of manufacture for which their  
soil,climate,popul; tion,and other eircurastuni’oahave  
matured them; and fostering the precious efforts and  
progress of household manufacture, by some put mil­  
age suite J to the nature of its objects, guided by the  
local informations they possess, and guarded against  
abuse by l.ioir presence aud attentions; the oppres­

of State, under General Washington&#x27;s administration,  
Mr. Jefferson was called upon to report on the restric­  
tion* of foreign nations upon our commerce, and on  
the best mean* of countervailing them. On the 16th  
December, 1793, he made a report to the House, in  
which he proposes two remedies: countervailing mea­  
sures and friendly arrangements. After noticing their  
restriction* at length, Mr. Jefferson makes the follow­  
ing sound reflection*, which, we trust, will make a  
deep impression on all who cherish an honest desire to  
promote their country’s prosperity:  
“There esn be no doubt hut that, of these two. friend­  
ly arrangement is the most eligible. Instead of em­  
barrassing comm-rce under pil~« of regulations, duties,  
and prohibitions, could it be relieved from all its shack­  
les, in all parts ot the world; could every country he  
employed in produring that which nature has best fit­  
ted it to produce; and each be tree to exchange with  
othars mutual surpluses for mutual want*, the greatest  
mass possible would then be produced of those things  
which contribute to human life and human happiness:  
the numbers of mankind would be increased, and their  
condition bettered.  
“Would even a single nation begin with the United  
States this system ot free commerce, it would be advi­  
sable to begin it with that nation; since it is one by on«  
only that it can he extended to all. Where the circum­  
stances of either party render it expedient to levy a  
revenue, hy way of impost, on commerce, its freedom  
might he modified, in that particular, by mutual and  
equivalent measures, preserving it entire in all other*.  
“Some nation*, not yet ripe for free commerce in  
all its extent, might be willing to modify- its retdric  
tions ami regulations for ns, in propnnion to the advan­  
tages which an intercourse with us might ofl-r. Par­  
ticularly, they may concur with us in reciprocating  
the duties to be levied on each side, or in coiiipensa­  
tmg any excess ot duty by equivalent advantages of  
another nature. Our commerce is certainly of a char­  
acter to euti la it lo lavoi in most countries. The commod­  
ities we oiler are either necessaries of life or materials  
for inatiiil.ictiire, or convenient subjects of revenue;  
and we take in exchange, either manufactures when  
they have received the last imi-di ol art and industry, or  
mere luxuries. Such customers may reasonably ex­  
pect welc. me and friendly treatment at every market.  
Customers, too, whose demands increasing with their  
wealth and population, must ve:y shortly give full em­  
ployment &#x27;o th« whole industry ot any natian whatev­  
er in any I ne of supply they may get into iha habit ot  
calling lor Irotn it.”

“Such being the restrictions on the commerce ami  
navigation of the United States, the question i«, in what  
way they may be best removed, modified, or counter­  
acted ?”  
&quot; to commerce, two methods occur. I. By fritnd­  
ty arrangements with the several nations with whom  
those restrictions exist: or, 2. By the separate act ol  
our own legislature, lor countervailing their effects.”  
11 There can be no doubt hut that, of these two, frietid­  
If/ arrangrment is the most eligible. Instead of embar­  
rassing commerce under piles of regulating laws, du­  
ties, and prohibitions, could it bo relieved from all its  
shackles, in all parts ol the world—could every country  
be employed in producing that which nature has best lil­  
ted it to produce, ami each be free to exchange with  
others, mutual surpluses, for mutual wants, the greatest  
mass, possible, would then he produced, of those things  
which contribute to human life and human happines ;  
the numbers of mankind would be increased, and their  
condition bettered.”

cd States this system ol free commerce, it would be ad­  
visable to begin it with that nation; since it is onchyont  
only that it can he extended to all. Where the cir­  
cumstances of cither party render it expedient to levy  
a revenue, by way of impost on commerce, its freedom  
might he modified in that particular, by mutual and  
equivalent measures, preserving it entire in all others.”  
“ Some nations, not yet ripe Ibr free commerce, in all  
its extent, might be willing to mollify its restrictions  
and. regulations, for us, in proportion lo the advantages  
which an intercourse with us might offer. Particularly  
they may concur with us in reciprocating the duties

tions, counter prohibitions, duties, and regulations.” He  
says, in his report, When a nation imposes high duties on  
our productions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be  
proper for us to do the same by theirs.  
  
Mr. Jefferson never admitted that a system of protecting  
duties may be rightfully resorted to as the means of direct-  
ly promoting domestic manufactures. He states, what we  
have already admitted, that one of the incidental effects of  
such regulations, may be the promotion of manufactures,  
just as they always have received, and from the nature of  
things always must receive, the protection arising from a  
state of war, as incident to a system of duties imposed ex-  
clusively for reveaue. Speaking of such retaliatory pro-  
hibitions, he admits that “‘ such duties might have the ef-  
fect of indirect encouragement to domestic manufactures  
of the same kind.”

‘ Instead of embarrassing commerce under piles of regulating laws,  
duties,and prohibitions, couk: it be relieved from all itsshac kles, in all parts  
of the world, could every country be employed in producing that which  
natme has best fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with  
others mutual surplusses for mutual wants, the greatest mass péssible  
would then be produced of those things which contribute to human  
life and human happiness; the numbers of mankind would be increased,  
and their condidon bettered.  
  
* Would even a single nation begin with the United States this sys-  
tem of free commerce, it would be advisable to begin it with that na-  
tion, since it is one by one only, that it can be exte mded to all. Where  
the cireumstances of either party render it expedient to lay a revenue,  
by way of imposts on commerce, its freedom might be modified in that  
particular, by mutual and equivalent measures, preserving it entire in  
all others.  
  
‘Some nations, wot yet ripe for free commerce in all its extent, might  
stil be willing to modify its restrictions and regulations for as,in proportion  
to the advantages which an intercourse with us might ofler. Particularly  
they may concur with us in reciprocating the duties to be levied on each  
side, or in compensating any excess of duty by equivalent advantage of  
another nature. Our ccmmerce is certainly of a character to entitle it  
to favor in most countries. The commodities we offer are either ne-  
cessaries of life, or materials for manufacture, or convenient subjects of  
revenue, and we take in exchange either manufaetures, when they re-  
  
ceive the last finish of art and industry, or mere laxuries. Such cus-  
  
tomers may reasonably expect welcome and friendly treatment at every  
market. Customers, too, whose demands, increasing with their wealth  
and population, must very shortly give fall employment to the whole  
industry of any ni: tion whatever, in any line ef supply they may get  
into the habit of calling for from it.”

merce by various nations, says:  
&quot;Such being the restrictions on the commerce  
and navigation of the United States, the question  
is, in what way they may best be removed, modifi­  
ed, or counteracted?  
  
&quot;As to commerce, two methods occur: first, by  
friendly arrangements with the several nations  
with whom these restrictions exist; or, second, by  
the separate act of our Legislature for countervail­  
ing their effects. There can be no doubt of these  
two friendly arrangements as the most eligible,&quot; &amp;c.  
&quot;And, after arguing the benefits of navigation  
and commerce reciprocally free with all nations, he  
says:  
&quot;But, should any nation, contrary to our wishes,  
suppose it may better find its advantage by con­  
tinuing its system of prohibitions, duties, and regu­  
lations, it behooves us to protect our citizens, their  
commerce and navigation, by counter prohibitions,  
duties and regulations also. Free commerce and  
navigation are not to be given in exchange for re­  
strictions and vexations; nor are they likely to pro­  
duce a relaxation of them.&quot;  
&quot;And, again, in another part of the same report.  
he says;a aeee e  
&quot;The following principles being founded in re­  
ciprocity, appear perfectly just, and to offer no  
cause of complaint to any nation:  
&quot;First. When a nation imposes high duties on  
our productions, or prohibits them altogether, it  
may be proper for us to do the same by theirs.&quot; We.

tention of Congress that it might adopt such mea­  
sures as the interests of the country seemed to re  
quire. This communication wis referred to a telect  
ommittee, who made a report, which was submit­  
ted to the Secretary of State, IMr Jefferson, &quot;with  
instructions to report to Congress, the nature and  
extent of the privileges and restrictions of the com­  
mercial intercourse of the United States with for  
eign nations, and the measures which he should think  
proper to be adopted, for the improvement of the  
commerce and navigation of the same.&quot;  
On the 14th December, 1793, Mr Jesferson made  
his report, from which I have extracted the follow  
ing passages, in order that the committee and the  
country may see what were his viewrs of the con­  
stitutional powers and duties of the Government of  
he U. States. IAm. St. Papers, vol.1, p. 300I  
Hut should any nation, contrary to our wishes, suppose  
it may better find its advant ge by continuing its systemn o  
prohibitions, duties, and regulations, it behooves us to pro  
tect our citizens, their commerce and navigation, by coun  
ter prohibitions, duties and regulations also. Pree com  
merce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for  
restrictions and vexations, nor are they lixely to produce a  
relaxation of them.  
&quot;The following principles, being founded in reciprocity  
appear perfectly just, and to offer no cause of complaint to  
any natin;  
&quot;I. Where a nat&#x27;on imposes high dutles on our produe  
or prohihits them alegether, it may be proper for us  
do the same by theirs; first, burdening or exclud a  
these producuiops, which they bring here in competition  
with our own of the same kind, solecting next, such manu  
lactures as we take from themn in greatest quantity, and  
which, af the rame time, we could the soonert furnish to  
ourselves, or obtain from other countries; imposing on  
them duties, lighter at first, hut heatier and heavier after  
wards, as other channels of supply open. Such dutte,  
having the effect of indirect encouragement to domestie  
manufactures of the same kind, may induce the manuise  
tarer to come himself into these States, where chesper  
  
subsiatence, equal laws, and a vent of bis wares, free of  
duty, mnay ensure him the highest profits from his skill and  
indusny. And here it woull be in the power of the State  
Governments to co-operate essentially, by opening the  
resources of encouragement, which are under their oon  
trol extending them liberally to artists in thore partioular  
branches of manufacture, for which their soll, chinate  
population, and other ciroumstances, have matured them  
and fostering the precious efforts and progress of house  
hold manufacture, by some patronage, sulted to the natur­  
of its objects, gulded by the local information they possess  
and guarded against abuse by their presence and attentions  
The oppressions ou our agriculture, in foreign ports, would  
thus be made the occasion of relieving it from a depend-  
ence on the counsels and conduct of others, and of pro­

United Notherlands  
Denmarke 1e  
Sweden.  
After giving a sketch of the restrictions on our  
commerce imposed by these nations, Mr. Jeffer.  
son sums them up thus:  
&quot;First.In Europe.  
Our Bread Stuff is at most times under pro-  
hibitory duties in England, and considerably us  
tied on reexportation irom Spain to her colomies.  
Our Tobaccos are heavily dutied in England,  
Sweden and France, and prohibited in Spain and  
Portugal.  
Oor Kice is heavily dutied in England and Swe  
den, and prohibited in Portugal.  
Our Fish and Salted Provisions are prohibited  
in England, and under prohibitory duties in  
France.  
Our Whale Oils are prohibited in England and  
Portugal.  
And our veseels are denied naturalization in  
England, and of late in France.  
Second. In the West Indies.­  
All intercourse is prohibited with the posses.  
sions of Spain and Portugal.  
  
Our Salted Provisions and Fish are prohibited  
by England.  
Our Salted Pork and Bread Stuff texcept  
maie) are received under temporary laws only,  
in the domimions of France, and our Salted Fish  
pays there a weighty duty  
Third. In the article of Navigation.  
Our own carriage of our own Tobaceo is hea  
vily dutied in Sweden, and lately in France.  
We can carry no article, not of our own proe  
duction, to the British ports in Europe; nor our  
own produce to her American possessions  
Such being the restrictions on the commerce  
and navigation of the United States, the question  
is in what way they may be best removed, modi­  
fied, or circumvented.  
As to commerce, two methods occur:  
I. By fnendly arrangements with the severul  
nations with whom these restrictions exist; or  
2. By the separate act of our own Legislatures  
for countervailing these effects.  
There can be no doubt but that of these two,  
triendly arrungement is the most cligible. In,  
stead of embarrassing commerce under piles of  
regulating laws, duties and prohibitions, could it  
be relieved from all its shackles in all parts of the  
world, could every country be employed in proe  
ducing that which nature has best fitted it to proe  
duce, and each be free to exchange with others  
mutual supplies for mutual wants, the greatest  
masg possible would then be produced of those  
things which contribute to human life and human  
happiness; the numbers of mankind would be  
increased, and their condition bettered.  
Would even a single nation begin with the E.  
States this system of free commerce, it would be  
advisable to begin it with that nation; cince it is  
one by one ouly, that it can be extended to all,  
Where the circumstances of either party render  
it expedient to levy a revenue by way of an im,  
post on commerce, its freedom might be modified  
in that particular, by mutual and equivalent mea-  
sures, preserving it entire on all others,  
Some nations, nat yet ripe for free commerce  
in all its extent, might still be willing to modify  
its restrictions and regulations for us, in propor.  
tion to the advantages which an intercourse with  
us might offer.

rce of desence essential.  
The carriage of our own commodities, if once  
established in another channel, cannot be resumed  
in the moment we may desire. If we lose the  
scamen and artists whom it now occupies, we  
lose the present means of marine defence, and  
time will be requisite to raise up others, when dise  
grace or losses shall bring home to our feclings  
the error of having abandoned them. The mate-  
rials for maintaining our due share of navigation  
are ours in abundance. And, as to the mode of  
using them, we have only to adopt the principles  
of those who thus put us on the defensive, or  
others equivalent and better fitted to our circum.  
stances.  
The following principles, being founded in recie  
procity, appear perfectly just, and to offer no  
cause of complaint to any nation.  
I. When a nation imposes high duties on our  
productions, or prohibits them altogether, it may  
be proper for us to do the same by them; first  
burdening or excluding those productions which  
they bring here in competition with our own of  
those of the same kind; selecting next such man-  
ufactures as we take from them in greatest quan-  
tity, and which at the same time we could the  
soonest furnish ourselves, or obtain from other  
countries; imposing on them duties higher at  
first, but heavier and heavier afterward, as other  
channels of supply open. Such duties having  
the effect of indirect encouragement to domestic  
manufactures of the same kind, may induce the  
manufacturer to come himself into these States,  
where cheaper subsistence, equal laws, and a  
vent of his wares free of duty, may insure him  
the highest profits from his skill and industry.  
And here it would be in the power of the State  
governments to cooperate essentially, by opening  
the resources of encouragement which are under  
their control. The oppression on our agriculture  
in foreign ports, would thus be made the occasion  
of relieving it from the councils and conduct of  
others, and of promoting arts, manufactures and  
population at home.  
2. When a nation refuses permission to our  
merchants and factors to reside within certain  
parts of their dominions, we may, if it should be  
thought expedient, refuse residence to theirs in  
any and every part of ours, or modify their trans-  
actions.  
3. Where a nation refuses to consider any ves.  
sel as ours, which has not been built within our  
territories, we should refuse to consider as theirs,  
any vessel not built within their territories.  
5. Where a nation refuses to our vessels the  
carriage even of our own productions to certain  
countries under their domination, we might refuse  
to theirs of every description, the carriage of the  
same productions to the same countries. But as  
justice and good neighborhood would dictate that  
those who have no part in imposing the restric.­  
tion on us, should not be the victims of measures  
adopted to defeat its effect, it may be proper to  
confine the restriction to vessels owned or naviga.  
ted by any subjects of the same dominant power,  
other than the inhabitants of the country to which  
the said productions are to be carried.  
The establishment of some of these principles  
by Great Britain, alone, has already lost us in  
our commerce with that country and its posses.  
sions, between eight and nine hundred vessels of  
near 40,000 tons burden. This involves a pro-  
portional loss of scamen, shipwrights, and ship-  
building, and is too scrious a loss to admit for.  
bearance of some effectual remedy.

in the reign of Charles I foreign vessels were  
permitted to bring into the European ports of that  
kingdom, articles which were the growth or man  
ufacture of the country to which the vessel be.­  
longed; but this privilege was not extended to  
the Colonies. By an act subsequent to the recog.  
nition of American Independence, the Crown  
was authorized to extend this principle to the  
vessels of the United States, and the extension  
I had been made from year to year by proclamation.  
  
eaamsm  
The insecurity of the tenure by which this right  
was held, produced a discrimination between  
American and other foreign vessels, which though  
hitherto inoperative in fact, was irritating in its  
tendencies.

England, or his country more than party ;  
But should any nation, contrary to our  
wishes, suppose it may better find its ad.  
vantages by continuing its system of pro­  
hibitions, duties, and regulations, it be­  
hooves us to protect our citizens, their com­  
merce and navigation, by counter prehibi­  
Hons, duties and regulations also. Free  
commerce and navigation are not to be  
given in exchange for restrictions and  
vexations, nor are they likely to produce  
a relaxation of them.  
The following principles being foun.  
ded in reciprocity, appear perfectly just,  
and offer no cause of complaint to any  
nation :  
&#x27;1. Where a nation imposes high du­  
ties on our productions, or prohibits them  
altogether, it may be proper for us to do  
the same by theirs ; first, burdening or  
excluding those productions which they  
bring here in competition with our own  
of the same kind ; selecting next, such  
manufacturers as we take from them in  
greater quantity, and which at the same  
time, we could the soonest firnish to  
ourselves, or obtain from other countries ;  
imposing on them duties, lighter at first,  
but heavier and heavier afterward, as  
other channels of supply open. Such du­  
ties having the effect of indirect encour­  
agement to domestic manufacturers of the  
same kind may induce the manufacturer  
to come himself into these States, where  
cheaper subsisted, equal laws, and a vent  
of his wares, free of duty, may ensure  
him the highest profits for his skill and  
industry. And here it would be in the  
power of the State Government to coop­  
erate essentially, by opening the recourses  
of encouragement, which are under their  
control ; extending them liberally to ar­  
tists in those particular branches of man­  
ufacture, for which&#x27; iheir soil, climate,  
population and other circumstances have  
matured them; and fostering the prcious  
efforts and progress of houshold manufac­  
ture by some patronage, suited to the na­  
ture of this object, guided by the local in­  
formation . they posess, and guarded  
against by their presence and attentions.  
The oppressions on our agriculture in  
foreign imports would thus be made the  
occasion of rclieveing it from a depen­  
dence on the counsels and conduct of  
others, and of promoting arts, manufac.  
tures and population at home.

navigation of the U. States, M r. Jefk rson said:  
&quot;Thequestion is, in what way they way best  
be removed, modified, or counteracted.  
&quot;As to commerce, two methods occur: 1. By  
friendly arrangements with the several nations  
with whom &#x27;hese restrictions exist; or, jj. By the  
separate aci of our own legislatures for counter­  
vailing their cflecls.  
&#x27;?There can be no doubt but that, of&#x27;.hese two,  
friendly arrangement is the most eligible. Instead  
of embarrassing commerce under piles of regu­  
lating laws, duties, and prohibitions, could it be  
telieved from all its shaclfbs in all partsof the  
world; could cverv country l&gt;c employed in pro­  
ducing that which nature has best fitted it to  
produce, and each be free to exchange with  
others mutual surpluses tor mutn.,1 wants, the  
greatest mass possible would then be produce! ol

Where the circumstances of either part&#x27; render  
it expedient to levy a revenue by way oi impost  
on commerce, in freedom might be moiified in  
that particular, by mutual and equivalrnt mea­  
sures, preserving it entire in all others.

necessary to be adopted, he uses this language:  
  
“The following principles, being founded in reci.  
procity, appear perfectly just, and effer no cause of  
complaint to any section. Ist. Where a nation im-  
poses high duties on our productions, or prohibits  
them altogether, it may be proper for us do the same  
by them, first burdening or excluding those produc-

‘*‘When once it shall be perceived that we ars

advantages to those who extinguish our commerce  
and navigation by prohibitions, as to those who treat

and circumstances of the United States leave  
them nothing to fear on their land-board, and no  
thing to desire beyond their present rights. But  
on tree seaboard they areoptn toinjury; and they have  
there, too. a commerce which must be protected.  
  
This can only be done by possessing a respectable !  
body of citizens, seamen, and of artists, and establishments  
in readiness for ship-building.  
&quot;Were the ocean, which is the common property  
of all, open to the industry of all, so thut every person  
and vessel should be free to take employment  
wherever it could he found, the United Stales would  
certainly not set the example of appropriating to  
themselves, exclusively, any portion of the common  
stock of occupation- They would rely on the  
enterprise and activity of their citizens fur a due  
participation of the benefits of the sea faring business,  
and for keeping the marine class ol citizens  
equal to their objects. But if particular nations  
giasp at undue shores, and, more especially if  
they seize on the means of the United States&quot; (to  
carry our mails, for instance, and monopolize the  
postage,) to convtrt them for aliment of their own  
strcngt/i, and withdraw them entirely from the support  
of those to whom they belong, defensive and protective  
measures become necessary on the purt of the nation  
whosemarine resources are thus invaded; or it wilt be  
disarmed of its defence; its productions will lie at  
the mercy of the nation which has possessed itself  
exclusively of the means of carrying them; and  
its politics may be influenced by those who com  
mand its commerce.  
&quot;The carriage of our commodities, if once established  
in another channel, cannot bo resumed  
in the moment we desire. If we lose the seamen  
and artisans whom it now occupies, we lose the  
present means of marine defence, and time will  
be requisite to raise up others, when disgrace or  
losses shall bring to our feelings the error of having  
abandoned them. The material of maintain  
ing our due share of navigation answers in abundance;  
and as to the mode of usingthem, we have  
only to adopt the principles of those who put  
us on the defensive, oh oth e rs euu1v a le nt or  
better ritted to our circumstances.

iWhen a nation imposes high duties on our pro­  
ductions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be  
proper for us to do the same by theirs first, burden­  
ing or excluding those productions which they bring  
here in competition with our own of the same kind ;  
selecting next such manufactures as we take from them  
in greatest quantity, and which, at the same time,  
wc could the soonest furnish to ourselves or obtain  
from other countries ; imposing on them duties light­  
er at first, but heavier and heavier afterwards; as our  
channels of supply , open. Such dutjes, having the  
effect of indirect encouragement to domestic manufac­  
tures of the same kind, mntj induce the manufacturer  
himself to come htmseJ into these&#x27; States, where cheap­  
er subsistence, equal laws, and a vent for his wares,  
free of duty, may eusure him the highest profits for  
his skill and industry. And here it would be in the  
power of the State government to co-operate essen­  
tially, by opening the resources of encouragement which  
are under their control, extending them liberally to  
artiste in those peculiar branches of manufacture for  
which their soil, climate, population, and other cir­  
cumstances have matured them, and fostering the  
precious efforts and progress of household manufacture  
by some patronage suited to the nature of its objects,  
guided by the local information they possess, and  
guarded against abuse by their presence and atten­  
tions. The oppressions on Our agriculture in foreign  
ports would thus be made the occasion of relieving it

Thomas Jefferson on the Tariff,

Our navigation involves still higher con-  
  
  
  
  
  
siderations. As a branch of industry it is  
valuable, but as a resource of defense, essen-  
tial. Its value as a branch of industry is en-  
hanced by the dependence of so many other  
branches on it. In times of general peace  
it multiplies competitors for employment in  
transportation, and so keeps that at its  
proper level; and in times of war—that is  
to say, when other nations who may be our  
principal carriers shall be at war with each  
other—if we have not within ourselves the  
means of transportation, our produce must  
be exported in belligerent vessels, at the in-  
creased expense of war freight and insur-  
ance, and the articles which will not bear  
that must perish on our hands.  
  
But it is asa resource of defense that our  
navigation will admit neither of neglect nor  
forbearance. The position and circum-  
stances of the United States leave them  
nothing to fear on their land-board and  
nothing to desire beyond their present rights.  
But on their seaboard they are open to in-  
jury, and they have there, too, a commerce  
which must be protected. This can only  
be done by possessing a respectable body of  
citizen seamen, and of artists, and establish-

had natural advantages, and showed  
that thus the greatest mass and variety  
of products with the given amount o  
labor would be produced, and in conse­  
quence there would be for each indi­

&quot;Would even a single nation begin  
with the United States this system of  
free commerce,&#x27; it would be advisable  
to begin it with that nation; since it is  
one by one only that it can be extended  
to all. Where the circumstances of  
either party render it expedient to levy  
a revenue by w:iy of impost on com­  
merce, its freedom might be modified,  
in that particular, by mutual and equiva­  
lent measures, preserving it in all oth­  
ers.&quot;Some nations, not yet ripe for free  
commerce in all its extent might be  
willing to mollify its restrictions and  
regulations for us, in proportion to the  
advantages which an intercourse with  
us might offer. Particularly they may  
concur with us in reciprocating the du­  
ties to be levied on each side, or in com­  
pensating any excess of duty by equiva­  
lent advantages of another nature.

ties and regula­  
tions, also.&quot;  
The italics in the above and following  
quotations are ours. The reader will  
see in these clippings from Jefferson&#x27;s  
state paper the entire and exact origin­  
al of the protected-reciprocity doctrine  
now credited to Blaine. Jefferson  
continued his argument and from tho  
succeeding page (648) we quote:  
The following . principles, being  
founded in reciprocity appear perfectly  
ubi, nun vuer no cause 01 complaint  
o any nation i  
When a nation imposes h!ch duties  
on our productions, or prohibits them  
altogether, it may be proper for us to  
do the same by theirs; first burdening  
or excluding those productions which  
they bring here, in competition with  
our own of the same kind; selecting  
next, such manufactures as we take  
from them in greatest quantity, and  
which, at the same time, we could the  
soonest furnish to ourselves, or obtain  
from other countries; imposing on these  
duties lighter at hrst, but heavier and  
neavier afterwards as the channels of  
supply open. Such duties having the  
effect ol indirect encouragement to  
domestic manufacturers ho come him­  
self into these States, where cheaper  
subsistence, equal laws, and a vent for  
his wares, free of duty, may insure him  
the highest profits from his skill and in­  
dustry. The oppressions on  
our agriculture, in foreiorn Dorts. would  
thus be made the occasion of relieving  
it from a dependence on the councils  
and conduct of others, and of promot­  
ing arts, manufactures and population  
at home.  
Jefferson saw and stated that &quot;We  
must expect some Inconvenience in prac­  
tice from the establishment ef discrim  
inating duties. But in this, as in so  
many other cases, we are left,&quot; said he,  
&quot;to choose between two evils.&quot; The  
inconviences are nothing when weighed  
against the loss of wealth and loss of  
force, which will follow our persever  
ance in the plan of indiscrimination.

We are now reaping the fatal results of

tinent to ask. In the event of war, and a

Thomas Jefferson said on this snbjeot

&quot;It is true that we must expect some  
inconvenience in practice from the es  
tablinhoient of discriminating duties,  
But in this, as in many other oases, we

the loss of force which will follow onr

every Jeffersonian Democrat, for the control of  
our carrying trade is one of the robust principles  
of sound Jeffersonism. In his famous report to  
Congress in 1793, &quot;On the privileges and restrio­  
tions on the commerce of the United States in  
foreign countries,&quot; which is considered the ablest  
document on that subject ever written by an  
American statesman, Jefferson set forth the im­  
portance of navigation in these words:  
Its value as a branch of industry is enhanced by the  
dependence of so many other branches upon it. In  
times of general peace it multiplies the competitors  
for employment in transportation, and so keeps that  
at its proper level; and in times of war, that is to say,  
where those nations who may be our principal car­  
riers shall be at war with each other, if we have not  
within ourselves the means of transportation, our  
produce must be exported in belligerent vessels, at  
the increased expense of war freight and insurance,

in producing that which nature has best fitted it to produce, and

“Should even a single nation begin w’ith the United States this  
system of tree commerce, it would be advisable to begin it with  
that nation, since it is one by one only that it can be extended to  
all. Where the circumstances of either party render it expedient  
to levy a revenue by way of impost on commerce, its freedom  
might be modified in that particular by mutual and equivalent

le, it is  
time the general public knew the origin  
of that conservative and popular meas­  
ure, about which there has been so much  
dispute.  
Jefferson and Reciprocity.  
In 1791 Thomas Jefferson, while Secre­  
tary of State in &quot;Washington&#x27;s . first ad­  
ministration, was requested by tho House  
of Representatives to report on tho ex­  
tent and restrictions of our commercial  
relations with tho outside world and for  
suggestions for the Improvement of the  
same.  
In his reply, submitted in 1793, Jeffer­  
son entered into a full discussion of the  
principles which should govern our for­  
eign commerce. He said:  
Such being the restrictions on the commerce  
and rmigaticn of the United States, the ques­  
tion is. In what way may they be bfct r?movd,  
modified, or counteracted. As to commerce, two  
methods occur: First, by friendly arrangements  
with the ceral nations with uhom thce re­  
strictions exist; or, second, by the seintale aet  
of our own legislative for countervailing their  
effects. There can be no doubt but that, of these  
two, friendly arrangement is the mare iligible.  
Instead of embarrassing commerce under plica  
of regulating laws, duties, and prohibition,  
could it be relieved from all its shackles m all  
  
parts of the world; could every country be em­  
ployed in producing that which nature lus best  
fitted it to produce, and each lc free to exchange  
with others mutual surpluses for mutual wants,  
the greatest niasa possible would then bo pro­  
duced by those things which contribute to human  
life and human happiness, the numbers of man  
kind would be increased and their cordition bet­  
tered.Should even a single nation begin with the  
United States this ostein of free commerce, it  
would be advisable to begin it with that nation,  
since it is ore by one only that it can be extend­  
ed to all. Where the circumstances of either  
party render it expedient to levy a revenue by  
way of impost on commerce, its freedom might  
be modified in that particular by mutual and  
equivalent measures, preserving it entire in all  
others.  
But should any nation, contrary to our wishes,  
suppose it may better find its advantages by  
continuing its system of prohibitions, duties, ard  
regulations, it behooves us to protect our citi­  
zens, ,their commerce and navigation, by counter  
prohibitions, duties, and regulations, also. Free  
commerce and navigation are not to be given in  
exchange for restrictions and vexations, nor arc  
they likely to produce a relaxation of them.  
The following principles, being founded in reci­  
procity, appear perfectly jut, and to offer no  
cause of complaint to any nation:  
When a nation imposes high duties on our  
productions, or prohibits them altogether, it miy  
be proper for us to do the same by theirs, first  
burdening or excluding those productions which  
they bring here in competition with our own of  
the same kind; selecting next such manufac­  
tures as we take from them in greatest quantity,  
and which, at the same time, we could the  
soonest furnish to ourselves or obtain from other  
countries, imposing on them duties lighter at  
first, but heavier and heavier afterward, as other  
channels of supply open. Sucli duties, having  
the effect of indirect encouragement to domestic  
manufactures of the same kind, may induce the  
manufacturer to come himself into these States,  
where cheaper subsistence, equal laws, and the  
lent of his wares, free from duty, may insure  
him the highest profits from his skill and in­  
dustry.The Democratic Commercial Policy.
