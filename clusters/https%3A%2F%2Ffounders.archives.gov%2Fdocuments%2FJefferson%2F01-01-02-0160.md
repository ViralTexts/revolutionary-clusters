June 7. 1776. the Delegates from Virginia moved in obedience to instructions from their constituents that the Congress should declare that these United colonies are &amp; of right ought to be free &amp; independant states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is &amp; ought to be totally dissolved; that measures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers, and a Confederation be formed to bind the colonies more closely together.

y when the members were ordered to attend punctually at ten o’clock.  
Saturday June 8. they &lt;resolution proposed was&gt; &lt;house&gt; proceeded to take it into consideration and referred it to a committee of the whole, into which &lt;it&gt; they immediately resolved themselves, and passed that day &amp; Monday the 10th. in debating on the subject.  
It was argued by Wilson, Robert R. Livingston, &lt;the two&gt; E. Rutlege&lt;s&gt;, Dickinson and others.  
That tho’ they were friends to the measures themselves, and saw the impossibility that we should ever again be united with Gr. Britain, yet they were against adopting them at th&lt;at&gt; is time:  
That the conduct we had formerly observed was wise &amp; proper now, of deferring to take any capital step till the voice of the people drove us into it:  
That they were our power, &amp; without them our declarations could not be carried into effect:  
That the people of the middle colonies (&lt;Pennsylvania&gt; Maryland, &lt;Dela&gt; Delaware, Pennsylva., the Jersies &amp; N. York) were not yet ripe for bidding adieu to British connection but that they were fast ripening &amp; in a short time would join in the general voice of America:  
That the resolution entered into by this house on the 15th. of May for suppressing the exercise of all powers derived from the crown, had shewn, by the ferment into which it had thrown these middle colonies, that they had not yet accomodated their minds to a separation from the mother country:  
  
That some of them had expressly forbidden their delegates to consent to such a declaration, and others had given no instructions, &amp; consequently no powers to give such consent:  
That if the delegates of any particular colony had no power to declare such colony independant, certain they were the others could not declare it for them; the colonies being as yet perfectly independant of each other:  
That the assembly of Pennsylvania was now sitting above stairs, their convention would sit within a few days, the convention of New York was now sitting, &amp; those of the Jersies &amp; Delaware counties would meet on the Monday following &amp; it was probable these bodies would take up the question of Independance &amp; would declare to their delegates the voice of their state:  
That if such a declaration should now be agreed to, these delegates must &lt;now&gt; retire &amp; possibly their colonies might secede from the Union:  
That such a secession would weaken us more than could be compensated by any foreign alliance:  
That in the event of such a division, foreign powers would either refuse to join themselves to our fortunes, or having us so much in their power as that desperate declaration would place us, they would insist on terms proportionably more hard &amp; prejudicial:  
That we had little reason to expect an alliance with those to whom alone as yet we had cast our eyes:  
That France &amp; Spain had reason to be jealous of that rising power which would one day certainly strip them of all their American possessions:  
That it was more likely they should form a connection with the British court, who, if they should find themselves unable otherwise to extricate themselves from their difficulties, would agree to a partition of our territories, restoring Canada to France, &amp; the Floridas to Spain, to accomplish for themselves a recovery of these colonies:  
That it would not be long before we should receive certain information of the disposition of the French court, from the agent whom we had sent to Paris for that purpose:  
That if this disposition should be favourable, by waiting the event of &lt;another&gt; the present campaign, which we all hoped would be &lt;favourable&gt; succesful, we should have reason to expect an alliance on better terms:  
That this would in fact work no delay of any effectual aid from such ally, as, from the advance of the season &amp; distance of our situation,  it was impossible we could receive any assistance during this campaign:  
That it was prudent to fix among ourselves the terms on which we would form alliance, before we declared we would form one at all events:  
And that if these were agreed on &amp; our Declaration of Independance ready by the time our Ambassadour should be prepared to sail, it would be as well, as to go into that Declaration at this day.  
On the other side it was urged by J. Adams, Lee, Wythe and others  
That no gentleman had argued against the policy or the right of separation from Britain, nor had supposed it possible we should ever renew our connection: that they had only opposed it’s being now declared:  
That the question was not whether, by a declaration of independance, we should make ourselves what we are not; but whether we should declare a fact which already exists:  
That as to the people or parliament of England, we had alwais been independant of them, their restraints on our trade deriving efficacy from our acquiescence only &amp; not from any rights they possessed of imposing them, &amp; that so far our connection had been federal only, &amp; was now dissolved by the commencement of hostilities:  
That as to the king, we had been bound to him by allegiance, but that this bond was now dissolved by his assent to the late act of parliament, by which he declares us out of his protection, and by his levying war on us, a fact which had long ago proved us out of his protection; it being a certain position in law that allegiance &amp; protection are reciprocal, the one ceasing when the other is withdrawn:  
That James the IId. never declared the people of England out of his protection yet his actions proved it &amp; the parliament declared it:  
No delegates then can be denied, or ever want, a power of declaring an existent truth:  
That the delegates from the Delaware counties having declared their constituents ready to join, there are only two colonies Pennsylvania &amp; Maryland whose delegates are absolutely tied up, and that these had by their instructions only reserved a right of confirming or rejecting the measure:  
  
That the instructions from Pennsylvania might be accounted for from the times in which they were drawn, near a twelvemonth ago, since which the face of affairs has totally changed:  
That &lt;sin&gt; within that time it had become apparent that Britain was determined to accept nothing less than a carte blanche, and that the king’s answer to the Lord Mayor Aldermen &amp; common council of London, which had come to hand four days ago, must have satisfied every one of this point:  
That the people wait for us to lead the way &lt;in this step&gt;:  
That they are in favour of the measure, tho’ the instructions given by some of their representatives are not:  
That the voice of the representatives is not alwais consonant &lt;to&gt; with the voice of the people, and that this is remarkeably the case in these middle colonies:  
That the effect of the resolution of the 15th. of May has proved this, which, raising the murmurs of some in the colonies of Pennsylvania &amp; Maryland, called forth the opposing voice of the freer part of the people, &amp; proved them to be the majority, even in these colonies:  
That the backwardness of these two colonies might be ascribed partly to the influence of proprietary power &amp; connections, &amp; partly to their having not yet been attacked by the enemy:  
That these causes were not likely to be soon removed, as there seemed no probability that the enemy would make either of these the seat of this summer’s war:  
That it would be vain to wait either weeks or months for perfect unanimity, since it was impossible that all men should ever become of one sentiment on any question:  
That the conduct of some colonies from the beginning of this contest, had given reason to suspect it was their settled policy to keep in the rear of the confederacy, that their particular prospect might be better even in the worst event:  
That therefore it was necessary for those colonies who had thrown themselves forward &amp; hazarded all from the beginning, to come forward now also, and put all again to their own hazard:  
That the history of the Dutch revolution, of whom three states only confederated at first proved that a secession of some colonies would not be so dangerous as some apprehended:  
That a declaration of Independance alone could render it consistent with European delicacy for European powers to treat with us, or even to receive an Ambassador from us:  
That till this they would not receive our vessels into their ports,  nor acknowlege the adjudications of our courts of Admiralty to be legitimate, in cases of capture of British vessels:  
That tho’ France &amp; Spain may be jealous of our rising power, they must think it will be much more formidable with the addition of Great Britain; and will therefore see it their interest to prevent a coalition; but should they refuse, we shall be but where we are; whereas without trying we shall never know whether they will aid us or not:  
That the present campaign may be unsuccessful, &amp; therefore we had better propose an alliance while our affairs wear a hopeful aspect:  
That to wait the event of this campaign will certainly work delay, because during this summer France may assist us effectually by cutting off those supplies of provisions from England &amp; Ireland on which the enemy’s armies here are to depend; or by setting in motion the great power they have collected in the West Indies, &amp; calling our enemy to the defence of the possessions they have there:  
That it would be idle to lose time in settling the terms of alliance, till we had first determined we would enter into alliance: That it is necessary to lose no time in opening a trade for our people, who will want clothes, and will want money too for the paiment of taxes:  
And that the only misfortune is that we did not enter into alliance with France six months sooner, as besides opening their ports for the vent of our last year’s produce, they might have marched an army into Germany and prevented the petty princes there from selling their unhappy subjects to subdue us.  
It appearing in the course of these debates that the colonies of N. York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware &lt;&amp;&gt; Maryland &lt;had not yet advanced to&gt; &amp; South Carolina were not yet matured for falling &lt;off&gt; from the parent stem, but that they were fast advancing to that state, it was thought most prudent to wait a while for them, and to postpone the final decision to July 1. but that this might occasion as little delay as possible, a committee was appointed to prepare a declaration of independance. the Commee. were J. Adams, Dr. Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert R. Livingston &amp; myself. committees were also appointed at the same time to prepare a plan of confederation for the colonies, and to state the terms proper to be proposed for foreign alliance. the committee for drawing the declaration of Independance desired me to &lt;prepare&gt; do it. &lt;I did so&gt; it was accordingly done and being approved by them, I reported it to  
  
June 28.  
  
the house on Friday the 28th. of June when it was read and  ordered  
  
July 1.  
  
to lie on the table. on Monday the 1st. of July the house resolved itself into a commee. of the whole &amp; resumed the consideration of the original motion made by the delegates of Virginia, which being again debated through the day, was carried in the affirmative by the votes of N. Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusets, Rhode island, N. Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, N. Carolina, &amp; Georgia. S. Carolina and Pennsylvania voted against it. Delaware having but two members present, they were divided: the delegates for New York declared they were for it themselves, &amp; were assured their constituents were for it, but that their instructions having been drawn near a twelvemonth before, when reconciliation was still the general object, they were enjoined by them to do nothing which should impede that object. they therefore thought themselves not justifiable in voting on either side, and asked leave to withdraw from the question, which &lt;they had&gt; was given them. the Commee. rose &amp; reported their resolution to the house. Mr. Rutlege of S. Carolina then &lt;desired&gt; requested the determination might be put off to the next day, as he beleived his collegues, tho’ they disapproved of the resolution, would then join in it for the sake of unanimity. &lt;this was done&gt; the ultimate question whether the house would agree to the resolution of the committee was accordingly postponed  
  
July 2.  
  
to the next day, when it was again moved and S. Carolina concurred in voting for it. in the mean time a third member had come post from the Delaware counties and turned the vote of that colony in favour of the resolution. members of a different sentiment attending that morning from Pennsylvania also, their vote was changed, so that the whole 12. colonies, who were authorized to vote  
  
*July 9.  
  
at all, gave their voices for it; and within a few days the convention of N. York approved of it &lt;by their votes to&gt; and thus supplied the void occasioned by the withdrawing of their delegates from the vote.  
Congress  
  
July 2.  
  
proceeded the same day to consider the declaration of Independance, which had been reported &amp; laid on the table the Friday preceding, and on Monday referred to a commee. of the whole. the pusillanimous idea that we had friends in England worth keeping terms with, still haunted the minds of many. for this reason those passages which conveyed censures on the people of England were struck out, lest they should give them offence. the clause too, reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa, was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina &amp; Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on the contrary still wished to continue it. our Northern brethren also  I believe felt a little tender &lt;on that&gt; under those censures; for tho’ their people have very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others. the debates having taken  
  
July 3. 4.  
  
up the greater parts of the 2d. 3d. &amp; 4th. days of July were, in the evening of the last closed. the declaration was reported by the commee., agreed to by the house, and signed by every member present except Mr. Dickinson. As the sentiments of men are known not only by what they receive, but what they reject also, I will state the form of the declaration as originally reported &lt;is here subjoined&gt;. the parts &lt;omitted an

&amp; those inserted &lt;are&gt; by them shall be placed in the margin or in a concurrent column&lt;s&gt;.  
A Declaration by the representatives of the United states of America, in General Congress assembled  
When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate &amp; equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  
We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain inherent and inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness: that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, &amp; to institute new government, laying it’s foundation on such principles, &amp; organising it’s powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety &amp; happiness. prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light &amp; transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. but when a long train of abuses &amp; usurpations [begun at a distinguished period and] pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such  government, &amp; to provide new guards for their future security. such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; &amp; such is now the necessity which constrains them toalter [expunge] their former systems of government. the history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated [unremitting] injuries &amp; usurpations, [among which appears no solitary fact to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest but all have] all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world [for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood.]  
he has refused his assent to laws the most wholsome &amp; necessary for the public good.  
he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate &amp; pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; &amp; when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  
he has refused to pass other laws for the accomodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them, &amp; formidable to tyrants only.  
he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  
he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly [&amp; continually] for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  
he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise, the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without &amp; convulsions within.  
he has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, &amp; raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.  
he has obstructed [suffered] the administration of justice [totally to cease in some of these states] by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.  
he has made [our] judges dependant on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, &amp; the amount &amp; paiment of their salaries. he has erected a multitude of new offices [by a self assumed  power] and sent hither swarms of new officers to harrass our people and eat out their substance.  
he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies [and ships of war] without the consent of our legislatures.  
he has affected to render the military independant of, &amp; superior to the civil power.  
he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions &amp; unacknoleged by our laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us; for protecting them by a mocktrial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states; for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world; for imposing taxes on us without our consent; for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury; for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences; for abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging it’s boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies  [states]; for taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments; for suspending our own legislatures, &amp; declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  
he has abdicated government here  
  
by declaration us out of his protection &amp; waging war against us  
  
[withdrawing his governors, and declaring us out of his allegiance &amp; protection]  
he has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, &amp; destroyed the lives of our people.  
he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation &amp; tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidyscarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages&amp; totally  unworthy the head of a civilized nation.  
he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends &amp; brethren, or to’ fall themselves by their hands.  
he hasexcited domestic in surrections amongst us&amp; has  endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, &amp; conditions [of existence.]  
[he has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow-citizens, with the allurements of forfeiture &amp; confiscation of our property.  
he has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it’s most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant  people who never offended him, captivating &amp; carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. this piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian king of Great Britain. determined to keep open a market where Men should be bought &amp; sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce. and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them: thus paying off former crimes committed against the Liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.]  
In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injuries. a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people [who mean to be free. future ages will scarcely believe that the hardiness of one man adventured, within the short compass of twelve years only, to lay a foundation so broad &amp; so undisguised for tyranny over a people fostered &amp; fixed in principles of freedom.]  
Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extendan unwarrantable  [a] jurisdiction over us [these our states.] we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration &amp; settlement here, [no one of which could warrant so strange a pretension: that these were effected at the expence of our own blood &amp; treasure, unassisted by the wealth or the; strgngth of Great Britain: that in constituting indeed our several forms of government, we had adopted one common king, thereby laying a foundation for perpetual league &amp; amity with them: but that submission to their parliament was no part of our constitution, nor ever in idea, if history may be credited and,] wehave appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by [as well as to] the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably [were likely to] interrupt our connection and correspondence. they too have been deaf to the voice of justice &amp; of consanguinity, [and when occasions have been given them, by the regular course of their laws, of removing from their councils the disturbers of our harmony, they have, by their free election, re-established them in power. at this very time too they are permitting their chief magistrate to send over not only  souldiers of our common blood, but Scotch &amp; foreign mercenaries to invade &amp; destroy us. these facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection, and manly spirit bids us to renounce for ever these unfeeling brethren. we must endeavor to forget our former love for them, and to hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war, in peace friends. we might have been a free and a great people together; but a communication of grandeur &amp; of freedom it seems is below their dignity. be it so, since they will have it. the road to happiness &amp; to glory is open to us too. we will tread it apart from them, and]we must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our [eternal] separationand hold them as we hold the rst of mankind enemies in war in peace friends !  
  
  
We therefore the representatives of the United states of America in General Congress assembled do in the name, &amp; by the authority of the good people of these [states reject &amp; renounce all allegiance &amp; subjection to the kings of Great Britain &amp; all the good people of these colonies, others who may hereafter claim by, through or under them: we utterly dissolve all political connection which may heretofore have subsisted between us &amp; the people or parliament of Great Britain: &amp; finally we do assert &amp; declare these colonies to be free &amp; independant states,] &amp; that as free &amp; independant states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, &amp; to do all other acts &amp; things which independant states may of right do. and for the support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes &amp; our sacred honour.  
We therefore the represe

lonies are &amp; of right ought to be free &amp; independant states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them &amp; the state of Great Britain is, &amp; ought to be, totally dissolved; &amp; that as free &amp; independant states they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce &amp; to do all other acts &amp; things which independant states may of right do. and for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes &amp; our sacred honour.  
  
  
  
On Friday July 12. the Committee appointed to draw the articles of confederation reported them and on the 22d. the house resolved themselves into a committee to take them into consideration. on the 30th. and 31st. of that month &amp; 1st. of the ensuing, those articles were debated which determined the &lt;manner of voting in Congress, &amp; that of fixing the&gt; proportion or quota&lt;s&gt; of money which each state should furnish to the common treasury, and the manner of voting in Congress, The first of these articles was expressed in the original draught in these words. ‘Art. xi. All charges of war &amp; all other expences that shall be incurred for the common defence, or general welfare, and allowed by the United states assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the several colonies in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every age, sex &amp; quality, except Indians not paying taxes, in each colony, a true account of which, distinguishing the white inhabitants, shall be triennially taken &amp; transmitted to the assembly of the United states.’  
Mr. Chase moved that the quotas should be fixed, not by the number of inhabitants of every condition, but by that of the ‘white inhabitants.’ He admitted that taxation should be alwais in proportion to property; that this was in theory the true rule, but that from a variety of difficulties it was a rule which could never be adopted in practice. &lt;that therefore it&gt; the value of the property in every state could never be estimated justly &amp; equally. Some other &lt;barometer for&gt; measur&lt;ing&gt; e for the wealth of the state must therefore be devised, some &lt;measure of wealth must be&gt; standard referred to which would be more simple. he considered the number of inhabitants as a tolerably good criterion of property, and that this might alwais be obtained. &lt;yet numbers simply would not&gt; he therefore thought it the best mode which we could adopt, with &lt;some&gt; one exception&lt;s&gt; only. he observed that negroes are property, and as such cannot be distinguished from the lands or personalties held in those states where there are few slaves, that the surplus of profit which a Northern farmer is able to lay by, he invests in &lt;lands&gt; cattle, horses &amp;c. whereas a Southern farmer lays out that same surplus in slaves. there is no more reason therefore for taxing the Southern states on the farmer’s head, &amp; on his slave’s head, than the Northern ones on their farmer’s heads &amp; the heads of their cattle. that the method proposed would therefore tax the Southern states according to their numbers &amp; their wealth conjunctly, while the Northern would be taxed on numbers only: &lt;and&gt; that Negroes in fact should not be  considered as members of the state more than cattle &amp; that they have no more interest in it.  
Mr. John Adams observed that the numbers of people were taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the state &amp; not as subjects of taxation. that as to this matter it was of no consequence by what name you called your people, whether by that of freemen or of slaves. that in some countries the labouring poor were called freemen, in others they were called slaves; but that the difference as to the state was imaginary only. what matters it whether a landlord employing ten labourers in his farm, gives them annually as much money as will buy them the necessaries of life, or gives them those necessaries at short hand. the ten labourers add as much wealth annually to the state, increase it’s exports as much in the one case as the other. certainly 500 freemen produce no more profits, no greater surplus for the paiment of taxes than 500 slaves. therefore the state in which are the labourers called freemen should be taxed no more than that in which are those called slaves. suppose by any extraordinary operation &lt;of law or&gt; of nature or of law one half the labourers of a state could in the course of one night be transformed into slaves: would the state be made the poorer or the less able to pay taxes? that the condition of the labouring poor in most countries, that of the fishermen particularly of the Northern states is as &lt;painful&gt; abject as that of slaves. it is the number of labourers which produce the surplus for taxation, and numbers therefore indiscriminately are the fair index of wealth. that it is the use of the. word ‘property’ here, &amp; it’s application to some of the people of the state, which produces the fallacy. how does the Southern farmer procure slaves? either by importation or by purchase from his neighbor. if he imports a slave, he adds one to the number of labourers in his country, and proportionably to it’s profits &amp; abilities to pay taxes. if he buys from his neighbor, it is only a transfer of a labourer from one farm to another, which does not change the annual produce of the state, &amp; therefore should not change it’s tax. that if a Northern farmer works ten labourers on his farm, he can, it is true, invest the surplus of ten men’s labour in cattle: but so may the Southern farmer working ten slaves. that a state of 100,000 freemen can maintain no more cattle than one of 100,000 slaves. therefore they have no more of that kind of property. that a slave may indeed from the custom of speech be more properly called the wealth of his master, than the free labourer might be called the wealth of his employer: but &lt;both&gt; as to the  state both were equally it’s wealth, and should therefore equally add to the quota of it’s tax.  
Mr. Harrison proposed a compromise, that two slaves should be counted as one freeman. he affirmed that slaves did not do so much work as freemen, and doubted if two effected more than one. that this was proved by the price of labor, the hire of a labourer in the Southern colonies being from 8. to £12, while in the Northern it was generally £24.  
Mr. Wilson said that if this amendment should take place the Southern colonies would have all the benefit&lt;s&gt; of slaves, whilst the Northern ones would bear the burthen&lt;s&gt;. that slaves increase the profits of a state, which the Southern states mean to take to themselves; that they also increase the burthen of defence, which would of course fall so much the heavier on the Northern. that slaves occupy the places of freemen and eat their food. dismiss your slaves &amp; freemen will take their places. it is our duty to lay every discouragement on the importation of slaves; but this amendment would &lt;be&gt; giv&lt;ing&gt; e the jus trium liberorum to him who would import &lt;them&gt; slaves. that other kinds of property were pretty equally distributed thro’ all the colonies: there were as many cattle, horses, &amp; sheep in the North as the South, &amp; South as the North: but not so as to slaves. that experience has shewn that those colonies have been alwais able to pay most which have the most &lt;males&gt; inhabitants, whether they be black or white. and the practice of the Southern colonies has alwais been to make every farmer pay poll taxes upon all his labourers whether they be black or white. he acknoleges indeed that freemen work the most; but they consume the most also. they do not produce a greater surplus for taxation. the slave is neither fed nor clothed so expensively as a freeman. again white women are exempted from labour generally, which negro women are not. in this then the Southern states have an advantage as the article now stands. it has sometimes been said that slavery is necessary because the commodities they raise would be too dear for market if cultivated by freemen; but now it is said that the labor of the slave is the dearest.  
Mr. Payne &lt;desired&gt; urged the original resolution of Congress, to proportion the quotas of the states to the number of souls.  
Dr. Witherspoon was of opinion that the value of lands &amp; houses was the best estimate of the wealth of a nation, and that it was practicable to obtain such a valuation. this is the true barometer of wealth. the one now proposed is imperfect in itself, and unequal between the states. it has been objected that negroes eat the food of freemen  &amp; therefore should be taxed. horses also eat the food of freemen; therefore they also should be taxed. it has been said too that in &lt;making&gt; carrying slaves &lt;enter&gt; into the estimate of the taxes the state is to pay, we do no more than those states themselves do, who alwais &lt;m&gt; take slaves &lt;enter&gt; into the estimate of the taxes the individual is to pay. but the cases are not parallel. in the Southern colonies slaves pervade the whole colony; but they do not pervade the whole continent. that as to the original resolution of Congress to proportion the quotas according to the souls, it was temporary only, &amp; related to the monies heretofore emitted: whereas we are now entering into a new compact and therefore stand on original ground.  
Aug. 1. the question being put the amendment proposed was rejected by the votes of N. Hampshire, Massachusets, Rhodeisland, Connecticut, N. York, N. Jersey, &amp; Pennsylvania, against those of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North &amp; South Carolina. Georgia was divided.  
The other article was in these words. ‘Art. xvii. In determining questions each colony shall have one vote.’  
July 30. 31. Aug. 1. present 41. members. Mr. Chase observed that this article was the most likely to divide us of any one proposed in the draught then under consideration. that the larger colonies had threatened they would not confederate at all if their weight in congress should not be equal to the numbers of people they added to the confederacy; while the smaller ones declared against an union if they did not retain an equal vote for the protection of their rights. that it was of the utmost consequence to bring the parties together, as should we sever from each other, either no foreign power will ally with us at all, or &lt;that&gt; the different states &lt;would&gt; will form different alliances, and thus increase the horrors of those scenes of civil war and bloodshed which in such a state of separation &amp; independance would render us a miserable people. that our importance, our interests, our peace required that we should confederate, and that mutual sacrifices should be made to effect a compromise of this difficult question. he was of opinion the smaller colonies would lose their rights, if they were not in some instances allowed an &lt;single&gt; equal vote; and therefore that a discrimination should take place among the questions which would come before Congress. &lt;he therefore proposed&gt; that the smaller states should be secured in all questions concerning life or liberty &amp; the greater ones in all respecting property. he therefore proposed that in &lt;all&gt; votes relating  to money, the voice of each colony should be proportioned to the number of it’s inhabitants.  
Dr. Franklin &lt;seconded the proposition&gt; thought that the votes should be so proportioned in all cases. he took notice that the Delaware counties had bound up their Delegates to disagree to this article. he thought it a very extraordinary language to be held by any state, that they would not confederate with us unless we would let them dispose of our money. certainly if we vote equally we ought to pay equally: but the smaller states will hardly purchase the privilege at this price. that had he lived in a state where the representation, originally equal, had become unequal by time &amp; accident he might have submitted rather than disturb government: but that we should be very wrong to set out in this practice when it is in our power to establish what is right. that at the time of the Union between England and Scotland the latter had made the objection which the smaller st

 original agreement of Congress to vote by colonies, and therefore was for their voting in all cases according to the number of taxables &lt;so far going beyond Mr. Chase’s proposition&gt;.  
Dr. Witherspoon opposed every alteration of the article. all men admit that a confederacy is necessary. should the idea get abroad that there is likely to be no union among us, it will damp the minds of the people, diminish the glory of our struggle, &amp; lessen it’s importance, because it will open to our view future prospects of war &amp; dissension among ourselves. &lt;that&gt; if an equal vote be refused, the smaller states will become vassals to the larger;

ples.  
John Adams advocated the voting in proportion to numbers. he said that we stand here as the representatives of the people. that in some states the people are many, in others they are few; that therefore their vote here should be proportioned to the numbers from whom it comes. reason, justice, &amp; equity never had weight enough on the face of the earth to govern the councils of men. it is interest alone which does it, and it is interest alone which can be trusted. that therefore the interests within doors should be the mathematical representatives of the interests without doors. &lt;If A has £50. B&gt; that the individuality of the colonies is a mere sound. does the individuality of a colony increase it’s wealth or numbers? if it does; pay equally. if it does not add weight in the scale of the confederacy, it cannot add to their rights, nor weight in argument. A. has £50. B. £500. C. £1000 in partnership. is it just they should equally dispose of the monies of the partnership? it has been said we are independant individuals making a bargain together. the question is not what we are now, but what we ought to be when our bargain shall be made. the confederacy is to make us one individual only; it is to form us, like separate parcels of metal, into one common mass. we shall no longer retain our separate individuality, but become a single individual as to all questions submitted to the Confederacy. therefore all those reasons which prove the justice &amp; expediency of equal representation in other assemblies, hold good here. it has been objected that a proportional vote will  endanger the smaller states. we answer that an equal vote will endanger the larger.

d there were 4 larger, 4 smaller &amp; 4 middlesized colonies. that the 4. largest would contain more than half the inhabitants of the Confederating states, &amp; therefore would govern the others as they should please. that history affords no instance of such a thing as equal representation. the Germanic body votes by states. the Helvetic body does the same; &amp; so does the Belgic confederacy. that too little is known of the antient confederations to say what was their practice.  
Mr. Wilson thought that taxation should be in proportion to wealth, but that representation should accord with the number of freemen. that government is a collection or result of the wills of all. that if any government could speak the will of all it would be  perfect; and that so far as it departs from this it becomes imperfect, it has been said that Congress is a representation of states; not of individuals. I say that the objects of it’s care are all the &lt;representatives&gt; individuals of the states. it is strange that annexing the name of ‘State’ to ten thousand men, should give them an equal right with forty thousand. this must be the effect of magic, not of reason. as to those matters which are referred to Congress, we are not so many states; we are one large &lt;one&gt; state. we lay aside our individuality whenever we come here. the Germanic body is a burlesque on government: and their practice on any point is a sufficient authority &amp; proof that it is wrong. the greatest imperfection in the constitution of the Belgic confederacy is their voting by provinces. the interest of the whole is constantly sacrificed to that of the small states. the history of the war in the reign of Q. Anne sufficiently proves this. it is asked Shall nine colonies put it into the power of four to govern them as they please? I invert the question and ask Shall &lt;a&gt; two millions of people put it in the power of one million to govern them as they please? it is pretended too that the smaller colonies will be in danger from the greater. speak in honest language &amp; say the minority will be in danger from the majority. and is there an assembly on earth where this danger may not be equally pretended? the truth is that our proceedings will then be consentaneous with the interests of the majority, and so they ought to be. the probability is much greater that the larger states will disagree than that they will combine.

it is the right of the people  
to alter or to abolish it, and to institute  
a new government, laying its founda­  
tion on such principles, and organizing  
its powers in such form, as to them shall  
seem most likely to effect their safety  
and happiness, Prudence, indeed, will  
dictate, that governments long estab­  
lished should not be changed for light  
and transient causes; and accordingly  
all experience hath shown, that man­  
kind are more disposed to suffer while  
evils are sufferable, than to right them­  
selves by abolishing the forms to which  
they are accustomed. But when a  
long train of abuses and usurpations,  
begun at a distinguished period, and  
pursuing invariably the same object,  
evinces a design to reduce them under  
absolute despotism, it is their right,it  
is their duty, to throw off such govern­

the patient sufferance of these colonics;

of the present king of Great Britain, is  
a history of unremitting injuries and u­

the establishment of an absolute tyran­

He has excited treasonable insurrections  
of our fellow citizens, with the allurements  
of forfeiture and confiscation of our pro­  
perty.  
He has waged cruel war against human  
nature itself,violating its most sacred rights,  
life and li berty in the persons of a dis­  
tant people, who never offended him, cap­  
tivating and carrying them into slavery in  
another hemisphere, or to incur miserable  
  
death tn their transportation thither.—  
This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of  
infidel /towers, is the warfare of the Chris­

keep open a market where MEN should he  
bought and sold, he has prostituted his nr*  
I&#x27;d live for suppressing every legislative at­  
tempt to proh ibit or to restrain this execra­  
ble commerce: and that this assemblage of  
horrors might scant no fart of distinguish­

to rise in arms among us, and to purchase  
that liberty of which he has deprived /Ac//!,  
by murdering the peojtle upon whom he also  
obtruded them; thus paying off former  
crimes committed against the liberties of one  
people, with crimes which he urges them to  
commit against the lives of another.

peated injury. A prince whose cha­  
racter is thus marked by every act  
which may define a tyrant, is unfit to  
be the ruler of a people who mean to be  
free. Future ages will scarce believe, that  
the hardiness of one man adventured with­

to build a foundation so broad and undis­  
guised, for tyranny over a people fostered  
\ and fired in principles of freedom.  
Nor have we been wanting in atten­

warned them from time to time, of at­  
tempts by their legislature to extend a  
jurisdiction over these our statu. Wc

When in the course of human  
events it becomes necessary for  
one people to dissolve the politi-  
cal bands which have connected  
them with another, and to assume  
among the powers of’ the earth  
the separate and equal station to  
which the laws of nature and of  
nature’s God entitle them, a de-  
cent respect to the opinions of  
mankind requires that they should  
declare the causes which impel  
them to the separation.  
  
We hold these truths to be self  
evident; that all men are created  
equal; that they are endowed by  
their Creator with inherent and  
inalienable rights; that among  
these are life, liberty and the pur-  
suit of happiness; that to secure  
these rights, governments are in-  
stituted among men, deriving their  
just powers from the consent of  
the governed ; that whenever any  
form of government becomes de-  
structive of these ends, it is the  
right of the people to alter or to

it’s powers in such form, as to  
them shall seem most likely to  
effect their safety and happiness.  
prudence indeed will dictate that  
governments long established  
should not be changed for light  
and transient causes. and accord-  
ingly all experience hath shown  
that mankind are more disposed to  
suffer, while evils are sufferable,  
than to right themselves by abol-

are accustomed. but when along  
train of abuses and usurpations,

object, evinces a design to reduce  
them under absolute despotism, it  
is their right, it is their duty, to  
throw off such government, and  
to provide new guards for their  
future security. such has been  
the patient sufferance of these  
colonies; and such is now the ne-  
cessity which constrains them to  
expunge their former systems of  
government. the history of the

Declaration of Independence.  
“It appearing in the course of these debates,  
that the colonies of New York, New Jer*oy,’  
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South  
Carolina, were not yet matured for falling from ■  
the parent stem, but that they were fast advancing I  
to that state, it was thought mo&gt;t prudent to wait a j  
while for them, and to postpone the final decision J  
to July 1st: but, that this might occasiou as little j  
delay as possible, a committee was appointed to I  
prepare a Declaration of Independence. The!

i «_ oinnmiccs were also appointed, at the same tune,  
; to prepare a plan ol coiTtederation lor the colonies,  
’ aud to stale tho terms proper to he proposed tor  
foreign alliance. The Committee for drawing the  
Declaration of Independence, desired me to doit.  
It was accordingly done, and beiug approved by  
them, I reported it to the House on Friday the  
2$thof June, when it was read uud ordered to He  
on the table. On Monday, the 1st of July, the  
House re-oivcd itself into a committee ol the  
whole, and resumed the consideration ot the oiigi­  
nal inoiion made by the delegates ot Virginia,!  
which, being again debated through the day. was 1  
carried in the u.lirinative by the votes of New ]  
Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts:, Rhode!  
Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North]  
Carolina, and Georgia. South Carolina and Penn- •  
sylvania voted against it. Delaware had hut two  
members present aud they were divided. Tho!  
delegates fiom New York declared they were for]  
it themselves, aud wrre assured their constituents!  
were for it; but that their instructions having been j  
drawn near a twelvemonth before, when recPti- j  
ciliaiion was still the general object, they were j  
enjoined by them to do nothing which should iin- ]  
prde that object. They therefore thought them- J  
selves uot justifiable in voting on either side, and |  
a^ked leave to withdraw from the questiou; which i  
was given them. The committeo rose ond re­  
ported their resolution to the House. Mr. Ed­  
ward Rutledge, of South Carolina, then requested  
the determination might be put off to the next  
day, as he believed his colleagues, though they  
i disapproved of the resolution, would then join in  
: it fur the s.*hc of unanimity. The ultimata que»­  
I tion, whether the Iloueo would agree to the reso­  
lution of the Committee, was accordingly post­  
poned to tho next day, when it vrnr again moved,  
him! South Carolina concurred in voting for it. in  
the mean time, a third member had come post from !  
the Delaware counties, ami turned the voteol that  
colony in favor of tho resolution.. Members of a  
different sentiment attending from Pennsylvania  
alio, her vote was charged, so that the whole  
twelve colonies who were authoiized to vote nt;  
all, gave their voices for it; and, within a lew  
d ys, th? Convcr&#x27;. n of N * Yo.-k approved of it,  
and thus supplied the void occasioned by the with­  
drawing of her delegates from the vote.  
“ Congress proceeded tho same day to consider  
tho Declaration of Independence, which had been j  
reported and laid on tho table the Eriday preced- i  
mg, and on Monday referred to a Committee of the!  
whole. Tho pusillanimous idea that we had friends 1  
in England worth keeping terms with, still haunt­  
ed tho minds ol many. For this reason, those  
passages which conveyed censures on the people  
of England were struck out, lest they should give  
them offence. The clause too, reprobating the en-.  
slaving the inhabitants of Africa, was struck out  
in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia,  
who had never attempted to restrain the hnporta­  
tioi^of slaves, and who, on the contrary, still  
wished to continue it. Our northern brethren also,  
I believe, felt a little tender under their censures; !  
for though their people had very lew’ slaves them- j  
selves, yet they had been pretty considerable car-,  
riers of them to others. The debates having ta- \
ken up the greater parts of the 2nd, 3J, and 4th .  
days of July, were, on the evening of the last. i  
closed; the Declaration was reported by tho Coin- j  
mittce, agreed to by the House, and signed by ev-!  
ery member present except Mr. D&#x27;. kiniou. As  
the sentiments ol men are known not only by1  
what they receive, but what they reject aim, I &lt;

to wait a while for them, and to postpone the final de-

delay as possible, a committee was appointed to prepare  
a Declaration of Independence. The committee were  
John Adams, Dr. Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert R.  
Livingston and myself. Committees were also appoint-

“Congress proceeded the same day to consider the De  
laration of Independence, which had been reported an@  
laid on the table the Friday preceding, and on Monday re&quot;  
ferred to a committee of the whole. The pussillanimous  
idea that we had iriends in England worth keeping terms  
with, still haunted the minds of many. For this reason,  
those passages which conveyed censures on the people of  
England were struck out, lest they should give them  
offence. The clause, too, reprobating the enslaving the  
inhabitants of Africa, was struck out in complaisance to  
South Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted  
to restrain the importation of, slaves, and who, on the  
contrary, still wished to continue it. Our northern  
brethern also, I believe, felta littl tender under their  
censures; for though their people had very few slaves  
themselves, yet they had been pretty considerable car-  
riers of them to others. The debates ;having taken up  
the greater parts of the 2d, 3d, and 4th days of July,  
were, on the evening of the last, closed; the Declaration

‘ On Friday, July 12, the committee appointed  
to draw the articles of Confederation reported  
them, and, on the 22nd, the House resolved  
themselves into a committee to take them into  
consideration. On the 30th and 3Ist. of that  
month, and Ist of the ensuing, those articles  
were debated which determined the proportion,  
or quota, of money which each state should fur-  
  
nish to the cominon treasury, and the manner of  
  
voting in Congress. The first of these articles  
was expressed in the original draught in these  
words. ‘Art. XI. All charges of war and all  
other expences that shall be incurred for the  
common defence, or general welfare, and allow-  
ed by the United States assembled, shall be de-  
frayed out of a common treasury, which shall be  
supplied by the several colonies in proportion to  
the number of inhabitants of every age, sex and  
quality, except Indians not paying taxes, in each  
colony, a true account of which, distinguishing  
the white inhabitants, shal] be triennially taken  
and transmitted to the Assembly of the United  
States.’  
  
Mr. Chase moved that the quotas should be  
fixed, not by the number of inhabitants of every  
condition, but by that of the ‘ white inhabitants.’  
He admitted that taxation should be always in  
proportion to property, that this was, in theory,  
the true rule; but that, from a variety of difli-  
culties, it was a rule which could never be adopt-  
ed in practice. The value of the property in every  
state, could never be estimated justly and equal-  
Jy. Some other measure for the wealth of the  
state must therefore be devised, some standard  
referred to, which would be more simple. He  
considered the number of inhabitants as a tolera-  
bly good criterion of property, and that this  
might always be obtained. He therefore thought  
it the best mode which we could adopt, with one  
exception only: he observed that negroes are  
property, and as such, cannot be distinguished  
from the lands or personalities held in those  
states where there are few slaves; that the sur-  
plus of profit which a Northern farmer is able to  
jay by, he invests in cattle, horses, &amp;c., whereas  
a Southern farmer lays out the same surplus in  
slaves. There is no more reason therefore for  
taxing the Southern states on the farmer&#x27;s head,  
and on his slave’s head, than the Northern ones  
on their farmer’s heads and the heads of their  
cattle: that the method proposed would, there-  
fore, tax the Southern states according to their  
numbers and their wealth conjunctly, while the  
Northern wovld be taxed on numbers only : that  
negroes, in fact, should not be considered as  
members of the state, more than cattle, and that  
they have no more interest in it.  
  
Mr. John Adams observed, that the numbers

of people were taken by this article, as an index  
of the wealth of the state, and not as subjects of  
taxation ; that, as to this matter, it was of no  
consequence by what name you called your peo-  
ple, whether by that of freemen or of slaves;  
that in some countries the laboring poor were  
called freemen, in others they were called slaves;  
but that the difference as to the state was ima-  
ginary only. What matters it whether a land-  
lord employing ten laborers on his farm, gives  
them annually as much money as will buy them  
the necessaries of life, or gives them those ne-  
cessaries at short hand? The ten labourers add  
as much wealth annually to the state, increase  
its exports as much, in the one case as the other.  
Certainly five hundred freemen produce no more  
profits, no greater surplus for the payment of  
taxes, than five ;hundred slaves. Therefore the  
state in which are the labourers called freemen,  
should be taxed no more than that in which are  
those called slaves. Suppose, by an extraordi-  
nary operation of nature or of law, one half the  
laborers of a state could in the course of one  
night be transformed into slaves: would the  
state be made the poorer or the less able to pay  
taxes? That the condition of the laboring poor  
in most countries, that of the fisherman particu-  
larly of the Northern states, is as abject as that  
of slaves. It is the number of laborers which  
produces the surplus for taxation, and numbers,  
therefore, indiscriminately, are the fair index of  
wealth ; that it is the use of the word ‘ property’  
here, and its application to some of the people of  
the state, which produces the failacy. How  
does the Southern farmer procure slaves? Ei-  
ther by importation or by purchase from his  
neighbor. If he impcrts a slave, he adds one to  
the number of laborers in his country, and pro-  
portionably, to its profits and abilities to pay tax-  
es; if he buys from his neighbor, it is only a  
transfer of a laborer from one farm to another,  
which does not change the annual produce of  
the state, and therefore should not change its  
tax: that ifa Northern farmer works ten labor-  
ers on his farm, he can, it is true, invest the sur-  
plus of ten men’s labor in cattle ; but so may  
the Southern farmer, working ten slaves; that  
a state of one hundred thousand freemen can  
maintain no more cattle, than one of one hun-  
dred thousand slaves. Therefore, they have no  
more of that kind of property ; that a slave may  
indeed, from the custom of speech, be more pro-  
perly called the wealth of his master, than the  
free laborer might be called the wealth of his  
employer: but as to the state, both were equally  
its wealth, and should therefore equally add to  
the quota ofits tax.

two slaves should be counted as one freeman.  
He affirmed that slaves did not do as much work  
as freemen, and doubted if two effected more  
than one; that this was proved by the price of  
labor; the hire of a laborer in the Southern co-  
lonies being from 8 to £12, while in the North-  
ern it was generally £24.  
  
Mr. Wilson said, that if this amendment should  
take place, the Southern colonies would have  
all the benefit of slaves, whilst the Northern  
ones would bear the burthen: that slaves in-  
crease the profits of a state, which the Southern  
states mean to take to themselves ; that they al-  
so increase the burthen of defence, which would  
of course fall so much the heavier on the North-  
ern; that slaves occupy the places of freemen  
and eat their food. Dismiss your slaves, and  
freemen will take their places. It is our duty  
to lay every discouragement on the importation  
of slaves; but this amendment would give the  
jus trium liberorum to him who would import  
slaves: that other kinds of property were pretty  
equally distributed through all the colonies:  
there were as many cattle, horses and sheep, in  
the North as the South, and South as the North;  
but not so as tu slaves; that experience has  
shown that those colonies have been always able  
to pey most, which have the most inhabitants,  
whether they be black or white: and the prac-  
tice of the Southern colonies has always been to  
make every farmer pay poll taxes upon all his  
laborers, whether they be black or white. He  
acknowledged indeed, that freemen work the  
most; but they consume the most also. ‘They  
do not produce a greater surpius for taxation.  
The slave is neither fed nor clothed so expen-  
sively asa freeman. Again, white women are  
exempted from labor generally, but negro wo-  
men are not. In this then the Southern states  
have an advantage as the article now stands. It  
has sometimes been said that slavery is necessa-  
ry, because the commodities they raise would  
be too dear for market if cultivated by freemen :  
but now it is said that the labor of the slave is  
the dearest.  
  
Mr. Payne urged the original resolution of  
Congress, to proportion the quotas of the states  
to the number of souls.  
  
Dr. Witherspoon was of opinion, that the val-  
ue of lands and houses was the best estimate of  
the wealth of a nation, and that it was practica-  
ble to obtain such a valuation. ‘This is the true  
  
barometer of wealth. The one now proposed is  
imperfect in itself, and unequal between the  
states. It has been objected that negroes eat  
the food of freemen, and therefore should be  
taxed; horses also eat the food of freemen;  
  
therefore they also should be taxed. It has been  
said too, that in carrying slaves into the esti-  
mate of the taxes the state is to pay, we do no  
more than those states themselves do, who al-  
ways take slaves into the estimate of the taxes  
the individual is to pay. But the cases are not  
parallel. Inthe Southern colonies slaves per-  
vade the whole colony ; but they do not pervade  
the whole continent. ‘That, as to the original  
resolution of Congress, to proportion the quotas  
according to the souls, it was temporary only,  
and related to the monies heretofore emitted :  
whereas we are now entering into a new com-  
pact, and therefore stand on original ground.  
August 1. The questions being put, the  
amendment proposed was rejected by the votes  
of New Hampshire, Massschusetts, Rhode Is-  
land, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and  
Pennsylvania, against those of Delaware, Mary-  
land, Virginia, North and South Carolina.  
Georgia was divided. Vv.

“It appearing in the course of these debales,

_decision to July llst : but, that this mnight occa­  
sion as little delay as possible a commuitice was  
appointed to prepare a Declaration of [ndepen­  
dence. The Coinmittee were John Adams, Dr.  
Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert R. Livingston,  
and myself. Committees were appointed, at the  
same time to prepare a plan cf confederation for  
the colonies, and to state the terms proper to be  
proposed for foreign alliance. The comnittee  
for drawing the Daclaration of Independence,  
desired me to do ii. 1t was accordingly done,  
and being approved by them, 1 reported it to the  
House on Friday the 23th of June, when it was  
read and ordered to lie on the table. On Mon­  
day, the first of Ju!{y, the House resolved itsell  
into a comunittee of the whole, and resumed the  
consideration of the original motion made by the  
delegates of Virginia, which, beingagain debat­

New-York declared they were for it themselves,  
and were assured their constituents were for it ;  
but that their instructions having been drawn  
near a twelmonth before, when reconciliation was  
still the reneral object, they were enjoined by  
them to do nothing which should impeﬁe that ob­  
ject. They therefore thought themselves not  
Justifiable in voting on either side, and asked &#x27;  
leave to withdraw from the question ; which was  
given them. The Committee rose and reported  
their resolution to the House. Mr. Edward Rut­  
ledge, of South-Carolina, then requested the de­  
teriination might be put off to the next day, as  
he believed his colleagues, though they disap­  
proved of the resolution. would then join it for

they should give them offence. The clause re­  
probating the enslaving the inhabitants of Afri­

Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted

on the contrary, still wished to continue it. Our

not as subjects of taxation* that, as a. this matter, it was of no  
consequence by what name you called vour people, whether by 1

‘ On Friday, July 12, the committee appoint- j  
ed to draw the articles ot Confederation report­  
ed them, and, on the 22d, «he Houae resolved  
themselves into a committee to take them into  
consideration. On the 30th and 31st of that  
month, and first of the ensuing, these articles .  
were debated which determined the proportion,  
or quota, ot money which each state should j  
furnish to the common treasury, and the man- ■  
ner ol voting in Congress. The first of these j  
articles was expressed in tne original draught ,  
in these words: ‘ Art. XI. AH charges of war  
and all other expenses that shall be incurred  
for the common defence, or general welfare,  
and allowed by the United States ass- mbled,  
shall be defrayed ou; of a common treasuiy,  
which shall V supplied by the several colonies  
in proportion to the number of inhabitants of  
every age. sex and quali«y, except Indians not  
paying taxes, in each colony, a true accoun&#x27; ot  
vrhi&lt; h, distinguishing the white, inhabitants,  
shall be irienmally taken and transmitted to the  
i Ass- mbly of &#x27;he United S&#x27;ates  
Mr. Chase moved that the quotas should be  
fix&#x27;d, not by thenumbtrol inhabitants of eve­  
ry condition, but by that of the ‘ white inhab­  
itants.’ He admitted that taxation should be  
always in proportion to property; tha&#x27; this was,  
in theory, the true rule; but that, from a varie­  
ty of difficulties, it was a rule which could ne­  
ver be adopted in practice. The value of the  
prot efy in every state,could never be estima­  
ted jus-ly and equally. Some other measute  
for the wealth of the state must therefote.be  
devised, some standard referred to, which  
would be more simple. He considered the  
number of inhabitants as a tolerably good cri­  
terion of nioDeriy, anti that this might always  
  
hr obtained. Hr therefore thought it the best  
mode which we could adopt, with one excep­  
tion only; he observed that negroes are proper­  
ty, and as such cannot be distinguished from  
th- lauds ot personalities held in those stat s  
where there are a few slaves; that the surplus  
of profit which a Northern farmer is able to  
l.,y by, be invests in cattle, horses, 8tc. whereas  
a Southern farmer lays out the same surplus  
in slaves. There is no more reason therefore  
for taxing the Southern States on the farmer’s  
head, and on his slave’s head, than the Non**,  
ern ones on their farmet’s heads and the heads  
of their ca’tle;that the method proposed, would,  
therefore, tax the Southern states according to  
their numbers and their wealth conjunct)’,  
while the Northern would be -axed on numbers  
only; that negrors; in fact, should not be con  
side red as members «»f the s ate, mur1 than cat  
tic, and that they have no more interest in it.  
Mi John Adams observed, that ihe numbers  
of people were taken by this article, as an in­  
dex of the wealth of ib«- «;«&gt;** -■**&lt; »&lt;•  
m no consequence by what name you called  
your people, whether by that of freemen or of  
slaves; that in some countri&lt; s the laboring poor  
! were called freemen, in ot tiers they were called  
slaves; but that the difference as to the state  
was imagirary only. What matters it whether  
a landlord employing ten laboters on Ins farm,  
gives them annuallv as mu&lt; h money as will  
buy them the necessaries ot life, or gives them  
those necessaries at short haod? The ten la­  
borers add us much wraith annually &lt;o the  
sta&#x27;e, increase its exports as much, in the one  
cusc as the other, (&#x27;e/tainly 500 freemen pro  
duce no more profit, no greate: surplus for  
the payment of texrs, than file hundred slaves,  
fherefore the state in whir h are the laborers  
calted freemen, should be taxed no more than  
(bat in which are those called slaves. Suppose,  
by an extraordinary operation of na&#x27;ure or of  
law, one half the laborers of a state could in  
the course of one night be transformed into  
_ • • I... ..... L._I.. . I.__  
  
the less able to pay taxes ? Thai the condition  
of ih^- laboring poor in most countries, that of  
the fishermen particularly ol the Northern  
Slates, is as abject as that of slaves. It is the  
number ol laborers which produces the surplus  
for taxation, and numbers, therefore, indiscrim­  
inately, are the fair index of wealth; that it is  
the use of the word ‘property* here, and its  
application to s&lt;mc of the people of the state,  
wrhich produces ■ he faflacy. How does &#x27;he south­  
ern farmer procure slaves? Either by impor­  
tation or by purchase from his neighbor. If  
he imports a slave, he adds one to the number  
ol laborers in his country, and proportion.«bly,  
to its profi&#x27;s and abilities to pay taxes; if he  
buys from his neighbor, it is only a transfer of  
a laborei from one farm to another, which does  
not change the annual produce of the state, and  
therefore should not change its tax; that if a  
Northern farmer works ten laborers on his  
farm, he can, it is true, invest the surplus of  
ten men&#x27;s labor in cattle; but *o may ’he South- j  
ern farmer, woiktng ten slaves; that a state of  
one hundred thousand freemen can maintain  
no more cattle, than one of one hundred thou­  
sand slaves. Therefore, they have no morr of  
that kind of property; that a sla-e may indeed,  
from the custom or speech,, be more properly  
called the wealth of his master, than the tree  
laborer might be called the wealth of his em­  
ployer; but as to the state, both were equally  
its wealth, and should therefore equally add to  
the quota of its tax.  
“ Mr. Ildtrison propost d, as a compromise,  
that two slaves should be counted as one free­  
man. He affirmed that slaves did not do as  
much work as freemen, ;.nd doubted if two ef­  
fected more than one; that this was proved by  
the price of labor; the hire of a laborer in the  
Southern colonies being from 8 to 12/ while in  
the Northern it was generally 24/  
Mr. Wilson said, that if this amendment  
should take place the Southern colonies would  
have all the benefit of slaves whilst the Not th­  
em ones would bear the burihen: that slaves, in­  
ciease iht profits of a s&gt;me, which the Southern  
states mean to take to themselves; that they!  
also increase the burthen of defence, which j  
would of course fall so muc h the heavier »&gt;n ihe  
Northern; that slaves occupy thefplace of free- j  
  
meu and fat their food* Dismiss your slaves, St j  
freemen will take (heir places. It is our duty o  
lav every discouragement on the imporiaiton.of  
slaves: hut this amendment would give the^ua  
Irium liberorvm to him who would import slaves;  
that other kinds of property were pretty equa.ly  
distributed through all thefcolonies? there were  
as many cattle, horses and sheep, in ‘he North j  
as the South, and South as thr North ; but not  
so as to slaves, that experience has shown that ,  
those colonists have been always able to pay ,  
most, which have the most inhabitants, wheth-1  
er they be black or whi&#x27;e : »nd the practice ol|  
th&lt;|Soutlnrn colonies has always been to make j  
every farmer pay poll tax upon all his labour-1  
ers whether they be black or white. He ac- ,  
knowle- eed indeed, that freemen worked the  
most ; but they consume the most also. I hey  
Jo not produce a greater surplus t .r tax- ,  
ation. The slave is neither fed nor cl« bed so (  
expensive as a freeman. Again, white women  
are exempt from labour generally but negro  
women are not. In this then the southern  
states have an advantage as the article now  
Stands. It has sometimes been said that slave­  
ry is necessary, be.,use the commodities they  
rai-e would be too dear for market if cultivated  
by freenv u j but now it is said that the labour  
of the slave is the dearest.  
Mr. Payne urged -he original resolution or  
Congress, to propofi n the quotas of the states  
to the number of souis.  
Di. Witherspoon wa, of opinion, that the  
value of laliiis and houses was ‘he best esti­  
mate of tiie wealth of a nation, and that it was  
practicable toobtain sue h a valuation. &#x27;I his is  
the true ba ometer of wealth. 1 he one now  
proposed is imperfect in iiselk and unequal be­  
tween the sta’es. It has been object&#x27;d that  
negroes eat the food ol f *t men, and therefore  
should be taxed ; horses ai-o eat the food of  
firemen; tlieref re they also should b- taxed.  
It has been said 100 «hat in carrying slaves in­  
to the estimate the taxes ihe state is to p.y,  
we do n&lt;&gt; more than those states themselves do  
who always take the slaves imo the estimate  
of the taxes the individual is to pay. But thc  
cases are not parallel. In ‘he southern colonies  
&gt;laves pervade ’he whole colony; but they do  
  
not pei vace me wnoie cumuimi. » uoi ,  
the original resolution of Congress, 10 propor­  
tion the quotas according to the souls, it was  
temporary only, and related to tire monies here  
lofore emitted : whneas wc are now entering  
into a new compact and therefore stand on ori­  
ginal ground.

men&#x27; proposed was iejected by the votes ol New

New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,

to that state, it was thought most prudent  
to wait awhile for them, and to postpone  
the final decision until July tir-«f; hut, that  
this might occasion as lit»!e delay as pos­

pointed, at the same tim •, to prepare a  
plan of confederation, for the colonies, and  
to state the terms proper to be proposed  
for foreign alliance. The Committe for  
drawing the Declaration of Independence,  
desired me to do it. ft was accordingly  
done, and being approved by them, 1 re­  
ported it to the House on Friday, the’^th  
of June, when it was read and ordered to

Committee of the Whole, and resumed the  
consideration of the original motion made  
by the delegates of Virginia, which being  
again debated through the day, was earn

Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts,  
Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland,  
Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia.  
South Carolina and Pennsylvania voted  
against it. Delaware had but two men*­

delegates from New York declared they  
were for it themselves, and were assured  
their constituents were for it, but liial  
their instructions having been drawn neai  
a twelvemonth before, when reconciliation  
was still the general object, they were en­  
joined by them to do nothing which should  
impede that object. They therefore thoughl  
themselves net justifiable in voting on  
either side, and asfced leave to withdraw  
from the question; which was given them  
I’lie Committee rose and reported then  
resolution to the House. Ed. Rutledge,

serve*: “Tint the number of people were taken, by this  
article, as an m l . x ol the wealth id the State, and not n«  
subjects ol laxn&#x27;inn; that, as to this i.litter, it w as of uo  
consequence hy what name you called people, whether  
by that ol froomeu or slaves; that, in some couniiles, the  
laboring poor were called freemen, in others, they w ere  
called slaves; hut tint the difference, as to the State, was  
imaginary only. What matters it whether a landlord em­  
ploying ten laborers on hi* farm gives them annually as  
iriiiah money as wilt buy them the necessaries of life, or  
gives them those necessaries at short hand? The ten la­  
borer* add as much wealth annually to (lie State—increase  
its exports as much in the one case as the other. Cer­  
tainly, five hundred freeman produce no more profits, no  
greater supplies for the payment of taxes, than five hun­  
dred slaves. There lore, the Slate in which .&#x27;the laborers  
are called freemen, should be taxed no more than that in  
which they are called Haves. Suppose,by an extraordina­  
ry operation of nature, or of law, one-hall of the laborers of  
a State could, in the course of one night, be transformed  
into slaves; would the Slate he made the poorer, or leas  
able to pay taxes? That the condition of the lahoting poor  
iu most countries, fiat of the fishermen, particularly, of  
the northern States, is as abject as that of slaves,” Sic.

from the lands or personalities held in those states where  
there are few slaves. That the surplus of profit which  
a northern farmer is able to lay by, he invests in cattle,  
horses, &amp;c.; whereas, a southern farmer lays out the  
same surplus in slaves. ‘here is no more reason there-  
fore, for taxing the Souther states on the farmer’s head,  
and on his slave’s head, than the Northern ones, on their  
farmers’ beads, and the heads of their cattle. ‘That the  
incthod proposed would therefore tax the Southern states  
according to their numbers and their wealth, consequent-  
ly, while the Northern would be taxed on numbers only:  
that negroes in fact should not be considered as mem-  
bers of the state, more than cattle, and that they have  
no more interest in it.  
  
Mr. John Adams observed, that the number of people  
were taken by this article, as an index of the wealth of  
the state, and not as subjects of taxation, That as to  
this matter, it was of no consequence which name you  
called your people, whether by that of freemen or slaves,  
That in some countries the laboring ‘poor were called  
freemen, in others they were called slaves: but that the  
difference as to the state was imaginary only. What  
matters it whether a landlord, employing ten laborers on  
his farm, gives them annually as much money as will  
buy them the necessaries of Jife, or gives them those ne-  
cessaries_at short hand? ‘The laborers add as much  
wealth annually to the state, increase exports as much,  
in the one case as the other, Certainly five hundred  
freemén produce no more profits, no greater surplus for  
the payment of taxes, than five hundred staves. ‘There-  
fore the state in which are. the laborers called freemen,  
should be taxed no more than that in which are those  
called slaves. Suppose by any extraordinary operation  
of Nature or law, one half of the laborers of a state,  
could in the course of one night be transformed into  
slaves—would the state be made the poorer, or the less  
able to pay taxes?’ That the condition of the laboring  
poor in most countrics,—that of the fishermen, particu-  
larly, of the Northern states, is as alject as that of the  
slaves, It is the number of laborers which produces the  
surplus for taxation; and numbers therefore indiscrimi-  
nately, are the fair index of wealth. That it is the use  
of the word ‘property’ here and its application to some  
of the people of the state, which produces this fallacy.  
How does the Southern farmer procure slaves? Either  
hy importation or purchase fiom his neighbor. It he  
imports a slave, he adds one to the number of laborers  
in his country, and proportionably to its profits and abil-  
ities to pay taxes; if he buys from his neighbor, it is only

“Mr. Harrison (of Virginia,) proposed as a comprom-  
ise that two slaves shouldbe counted as one freeman.  
He affirmed that slaves did not do as much work as free-  
men, and doubted if two effected much more than one,  
That this was proved by the price of labor, the hire ofa  
laborer in the Southern colonies being from £8 to £12,  
while in the Northern it was generally £24,  
  
Mr. Wilson, (of Pennsylvania,) said that, if, this  
amendment should take place, the Southern colonies  
would have all the benefit of slaves, while the Noithern  
ones would bea: the burthen. ‘That slaves increase the  
profits of a state which the Southern states mean to take  
to themselves; that they also increase the burthen of de-  
fence which would of course fall so much the heavier on  
the Northern; that slaves occupy the places of freemen  
and eat their food, Dismiss your slaves, and freemen  
will take thei: places. It is our duty to lay every dis-  
couragement on the importation of slaves; but this  
amendment would give the jus trium liberorum to him  
him who would import slaves. ‘That other kinds of pro-  
perty were pretty equally distributed through all the co-  
lonics: there were as many cattle, horses and sheep in the  
North as the South, and South asthe North; but not so  
as to slaves: that experience has shown that those colo-  
nies have been always able to pay most, which have the  
most inhabitants, whether they be black or white; and the  
practice of the Southern colonies has always been to  
make every farmer pay poll taxes upon all his laborers,  
whether they be black or white. Ile acknowledged in-  
deed that freensen work the most; but, they consume  
the most also, ‘They do not produce a greater surplus  
for taxation. ‘The slave is neither fed nor clothed so  
expensively as a freeman, Again the women are exempt  
from labor generally, which negro women are not, In  
this then the Southern states have an advantage as the  
article now stands. [t has sometimes been said that sla-  
very was necessary, because the commodities they raise  
would be too dear for maiket if cullivated by freemen;  
but new it is said that the labor of the slave 1s the dear-  
  
st.  
  
Mr. Payne, (of Massachusetts,) urged the original re-  
solution of Congress, to projyortion the quotas of the  
State to the number of souls,  
  
Dr. Witherspoon, (of New Jersey,) was of opivion  
that the value of Jands and houses was the best e: timate  
of the wealth of a nation, and that it was practicable to  
obtain such a valuation, his is the true barometer of  
wealth. The one now proposed is imperfect in itself,  
and unequal between the States, It has been objected  
that negroes eat the food of freemen, and therefore  
should be taxed: horses also eat the food of freemen;  
therefore they also should be taxed, It h en said  
too, that in carrying slaves into the estimate r taxes  
the state is to pay, we do no more than those states them-  
selvesdo, who always take slaves into ‘the estimate of  
the taxes the individual has to pay. . But the cases aré  
not parallel. Imthe Southern colonies the slaves per-  
vade the whole colony; but they do not petyade the  
whole continent, ‘That as to the- original resolution of  
Congress, it was teniporary only, and related to the mo-  
nies heretofore emitted: whereas we are now entering  
intoa new compact, and therefore stand on original  
ground,”

are very forcible upon this point. According to Mr. Jeffer-

‘people are taken as an index of the wealth of the state,  
‘and not as subjects of taxation; that, as to this matter, it

‘of life, or gives them those necessaries at short hand? The  
‘ten laborers add as much wealth to the state, increase its  
‘exports as much, in the one case as in the other. Certainly  
‘five hundred freemen produce no more profits, no greater  
‘surplus for the payment of taxes, than five hundred slaves.  
‘Therefore the state, in which the laborers are called free-  
‘men, should be taxed no more than that in which the labo-  
‘rers are called slaves. Suppose by an extraordinary opera-

‘That the condition of the laboring poor in most countries,

On Friday, the twelfth of July, 1776, the committee appointed to  
draw the articles of Confederation reported them, and on the twenty-  
second, the House resolved themselves into a committee to take  
them into consideration. On the thirtieth and thirty-first of that  
month, and the first of the ensuing, those articles were debated  
which determined the proportion or quota of money which each  
State should furnish to the common treasury, and the manner of  
voting in Congress. ‘The first of these articles was expressed ip the  
original draught in these words :—  
  
“Article 11. All charges of war and all other expenses that shall  
be incurred for the common defence, or general welfare, and allowed  
by the United States assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common  
treasury, which shall be supplied by the several colonies in pro-  
portion to the number of inbabitants of every age, sex and quality,  
except Indians not paying taxes, in each colony, a true account of  
which, distinguishing the white inhabitants, shall be triennially taken  
and transmitted to the assembly of the United States.”  
  
Mr. Chase (of Maryland) moved, that the quotas should be paid, not  
by the number of inhabitants of every condition but by that of the  
“white inhabitants.” He admitted that taxation should be always in  
proportion to property ; that this was in theory the true rule, but  
that from a variety of difficulties it was a rule which could never be  
adopted in practice. The value of the property in every State could  
never be estimated justly and equally. Some other measure for the  
wealth of the State must therefore be devised, some standard referred  
to which would be more simple. He considered the number of in-  
habitants as a tolerably good criterion of property, and that this might  
always be obtained. He therefore thought it the best mode we could  
adopt, with one exception only. He observed that negroes are  
property, and as such cannot be distinguished from the lands or  
personalities held in those States where there are few slaves. ‘That  
  
v  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
10  
  
the surplus of profit which a Northern farmer is able to lay by, he  
invests iz cattle, horses, &amp;c.; whereas, a Southern farmer lays out  
that same surplus in slaves. There is no more reason therefore for  
taxing the Southern States on the farmer’s head and on his slave’s  
head, than the Northern ones on their farmers’ heads and the heads  
of their cattle. That the method proposed would therefore tax the  
Southern States according to their numbers and their wealth con-  
junctly, while the Northern would be taxed on numbers only: that  
negroes in fact should not be considered as members of the State,  
more than cattle, and that they have no more interest in it.  
  
Mr. John Adams (of Massachusetts) observed, that the numbers of  
people were taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the  
State, and not as subjects of taxation. That as to this matter, it was  
of no consequence by what name you called your people, whether by  
that of freemen or of slaves. That in some countries the laboring  
poor were called freemen, in others they were called slaves: but  
that the difference as to the state was imaginary only. What matters  
it whether a landlord employing ten laborers on his farm gives them  
annually as much money as will buy them the necessaries of life, or  
gives them those necessaries at short hand? The ten laborers add  
as much wealth annually to the State, increase its exports as much,  
in the one case as the other. Certainly five hundred freemen produce  
no more profits, no greater surplus for the payment of taxes, than five  
hundred slaves. Therefore the State in which are the laborers  
ealled freemen, should be taxed no more than that in which are those  
called slaves. Suppose, by any extraordinary operation of vature or  
of law, one half the laborers of a State could in the course of one night  
be transformed into slaves,—would the State be made the poorer, or  
the less able to pay taxes? That the condition of the laboring poor  
in most countries,—that of the fishermen, particularly, of the Northern  
States,—is as abject as that of slaves. It is the number of jaborers  
which produces the surplus for taxation; and numbers, therefore,  
indiscriminately, are the fair index of wealth. That it is the use of  
the word “ property” here, and its application to some of the people of  
the State, which produces the fallacy. How does the Southern  
farmer procure slaves? Either by importation or by purchase from  
his neighbor. If he imports a slave, he adds one to the number of  
laborers in his country, and proportionably to its profits and abilities  
to pay taxes; if he buys from his neighbor, it is only a transfer of a  
laborer from one farm to another, which does not change the annual  
produce of the State, and therefore should not change its tax ; that if  
a Northern farmer works ten laborers on his furm, he can, it is true,  
invest the surplus of ten men’s labor in cattle ; but so may the Southern  
farmer working ten slaves. That a State of one hundred thousand  
freemen can maintain no more cattle than one of one hundred thous-  
and slaves; therefore they have no more of that kind of property.

Mr. Harrison (of Virginia) proposed, as a compromise, that two  
slaves should be counted as one freeman. He affirmed that slaves  
did not do as much work as freemen, and doubted if two affected more  
than one. That this was proved by the price of labor, the hire of a  
laborer in the Southern colonies being from £8 to £12, while in the  
Northern it was generally £24.  
  
Mr Wilson (of Pennsylvania) said, that if this amendment should  
take place, the Southern colonies would have all the benefit of slaves,  
whilst the Northern ones would bear the burthen. That slaves increase  
the profits of a State, which the Southern States mean to take to  
themselves; that they also increase the burthen of defence, which  
would of course fall so much the heavier on the Northern ; that slaves  
occupy the places of freemen and eat their food. Dismiss your  
slaves, and freemen will take their places. It is our duty to lay  
every discouragement on the importation of slaves; but this amend-  
ment would give the jus trium liberorum to him who would import  
slaves. That other kinds of property were pretty equally distributed  
through all the colonies: there were as many cattle, horses, and  
sheep, in the North as the Sonth, and South as the North; but not  
so as to slaves: that experience has shown that those colonies have  
been always able to pay most, which have the most inhabitants,  
Whether they be black or white; and the practice of the Southern  
colonies has always been to make every farmer pay poll taxes upon  
all his laborers, whether they be black or white. He acknowledged  
indeed that freemen worked the most; but they consume the most  
also, They do not produce a greater surplus for taxation. The  
slave is neither fed nor clothed so expensively asa freeman. Again,  
white women are exempted from labor generally, which negro women  
are not. In this then the Southern States have an advantage as the  
article now stands. It has sometimes been said that slavery was  
necessary, because the commodities they raise would be too dear for  
market if cultivated by freemen; but now it is said that the labor of  
the slave is the dearest.  
  
Mr Payne (of Massachusetts) urged the original resolution of Con-  
gress, to proportion the quotas of the States to the number of souls.  
  
Dr. Witherspoon (of New-Jersey) was of opinion, that the value of  
lands and houses was the best estimate of the wealth of a nation, and  
that it was practicable to obtain such a valuation. This is the true  
barometer of wealth. The one now proposed is imperfect in itself, and  
unequal between the States. It has been objected that negroes eat the  
food of freemen, and therefore should be taxed. Horses also eat the  
food of freemen ; therefore they also should be taxed. It has been  
said too, that in carrying slaves into the estimate of the taxes  
the State is to pay, we do no more than those States themselves do,  
who always take slaves into the estimate of the taxes the individual

is to pay. But the cases are not parallel. In the Southern Colonies,  
slaves pervade the whole colony; but they do not pervade the whole  
continent. That as to the original resolution of Congress, it was  
temporary only, and related to the moneys heretofore emitted:  
whereas we are now entering into a new compact, and therefore  
stand on original ground.  
  
Aveust Ist. The question being put, the amendment proposed  
was rejected by the votes of New-Hampshire, Mass :chusetts, Rhode-  
Island, Conneeticut, New-York, New-Jersey and Pennsylvania, against  
those of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North, and South Carolina.  
Georgia was divided. Vol. I. pp. 27-8-9, 30-1-2.

further they had no right to go.  
  
The views of John Adams as expressed in the  
Congress of Confederation are so just, that they  
deserve attention on account of their bearing upon  
this subject. He remarked, “that the numbers of  
people are taken as an index of the wealth of the  
State, and not as subjects of taxation; that, as to  
this matter, it was of no consequence by what name  
you called your people, whether by that of freemen  
or of slaves; that in some countries the laboring  
poor are called freemen, in others they are called  
slaves ; but that the difference as to the State was  
imaginary only. * * * Certainly five hundred  
freemen produce no more profits, no greater sur-  
plus for the payment of taxes, than five hundred  
slaves. * * * Suppose, by an extraordinary  
operation of nature or law, one half the laborers of  
a State could, in the course of one night, be trans-  
formed into slaves, would the State be made the  
poorer or less able to pay taxes? ‘That the condi-  
tion of the laboring poor in most countries, that of  
the fisherman particularly of the Northern States,  
is as abject as that of slaves. It is the number of  
laborers which produces the surplus for taxation,  
and numbers indiscriminately, therefore, are the fair  
index of wealth.” When these observations were  
made, it had not then been decided that taxatio

now invited attention. The Xl Art coming up for con­  
sideration, &quot;Mr. Chase moved that the quotas should be  
&quot;paid, not by the number of the inhabitants of every con­  
&quot;dition, but by that of the white inhabitants. He admitted  
&quot;that taxation should always be in proportion to property.  
&quot;He considered the number of white inhabitants a good  
&quot;criterion of property, and that might always be obtained-  
&quot;the slaves of the south he considered no more as members  
of the State than the cattle of the north.&quot;  
Mr. Adams &quot;observed that the numbers of the people

&quot;State, and not as subjects of taxation. That, as to this  
&quot;matter, it was of no consequence by what name we call.

Five hundred freemen, he thought, produced no more

five hundred slaves--therefore, he argued that the slave and  
the free laborer were equally the wealth of the State, and  
should equally add to the quotn of its tax.  
&quot;Mr. Harrison proposed, as a compromise, that two  
&quot;slaves should be counted as one freeman. He asfirmed  
&quot;that slaves did not do as much work as freemen, and  
&quot;doubted if two effected more than one. That this was  
&quot;proved by the price of labor, the hire of a laborer in the  
&quot;Southern colonies being from 03 to C12, while in the  
&quot;North it was generally $24.&quot; It was admitted, at that

numbers. He said- &quot;We stand here as the representa­  
&quot;tives of the people. That in some States the people are  
&quot;many--in others they are few; that therefore their vote  
&quot;here should be proportioned to the numbers from whom it  
&quot;comes. Reason, justice and equity never had weight  
&quot;enough on the face of the earth to govern the councils of  
&quot;men. It is interest alone which can be trusted. That there.  
&quot;fore the interest within doors should be the mathematical  
&quot;representative of the interest within doors--that the indi.  
&quot;viduality of a colony has a mere sound. Does the individual.  
&quot;ity of a colony increase its wealth, if it doespay equally? If  
&quot;it does not add weight in the scale of the community, it can­  
&quot;not add to their rights, nor weigh in the argument. A has  
$50,B $500, C $1000, in partuership. Is it just they  
&quot;should equally dispose of the money of the partaership?  
&quot;It has been said we are independent individuals making

&quot;That, though they were friends to the  
measures, and saw the impossibility that we  
should ever again be united with Great Bri­  
tain, yet they were against adopting them  
at this time.  
&quot;That the conduct we had formely ob­  
served was wise and proper now, of defer­  
ring to take any capital step till the voice  
ofthe people drove us into it:  
&quot;That they were our power, aud without  
them our declarations could not be carried  
into effect:  
&quot;That the pcoplo of the middle colonies  
(Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, tbe  
Jerseys, and New York) were not yet ripe  
for bidding adieu to British connexion, but  
that they were fast ripening, and, in a short  
time, would join in the general voice of A­  
merica:  
&quot;That the resolution entered into by this  
House on the 15th of May, for suppressing  
the exercise of ali powers derived from the  
crown, had shown, by the ferment into  
which it had thrown these middle colonies,  
that they had not yet accommodated their  
minds to a separation from the mother coun­  
try:  
&quot;That some ofthem had expressly forbidden  
their delegates to consent to such a decla­  
ration, and others had given no instructions,  
and consequently no powers to ffive fauch  
content:  
&quot;That, if the delegates of any particular  
colony had no power to declare such coiony  
independent, certain they were the others  
could not declare for them the colonies be?  
ing as yet perfectly independent of each  
other:  
&quot;That tho assembly of Pennsylvania was  
now sitting above stairs, their convention  
would sit within a few days, the convention  
of New York was now pitting, and those of  
the Jerseys and Delaware counties would  
meet on the Monday following, and it was  
probable these bodies would take up the  
question of independence, and would declare  
to their delegates the voice of their State:  
&quot;That if such a declaration should now  
be agreed to, theso delegates must retire,  
and possible their colonies might 6eceds from  
the Union,  
&#x27;&#x27;That such a secession would weaken us  
more than could be compensated by any  
foreign alliance:  
&quot;That in the event of such a division,  
foreign powers would either refuse to join  
themselves to our fortunes, or haying us so  
much in their power as that desperate Dcc­  
larotion would place us, they would insist  
on terms proportjonably jnore hard and pre­  
judicial:  
&quot;That we had little reabon to expect an  
alliance with those to whom alone, as yet,  
we had cast our eyes:  
&quot;That France and Spain had reason to  
be jealous of that rising power, which would  
one day certainly strip them of all their A­  
merican possessions  
&quot;That it was more likely they should form  
a connexion with the British Court, who,  
if they should find themselves unable other  
wi6e to extricate themscives from their d.ffi­  
culties, would agree to a partition of our  
territories, restoring Canada to France, and  
tbe Floridas to Spain, to accomplish for*  
themselves a recovery of these colonies  
&quot;That it would not be long before we  
should receive certain information of the  
disposition of the French Courl, from the  
agent whom we had sent to Paris for that  
purposo:  
&quot;That if this disposition should be favor­  
able, by waiting the ovent of the present  
campaign, which we all hoped would be  
successful, we should have reason to expect  
an alliance on belter termsi  
&#x27;&#x27;That this would in fact work no delay  
of any effectual aid from auch ally, *a, from  
tbe advance of the aeason and distance of  
our situation, it was impossible we could  
  
&#x27;-i&amp;efidiHj&#x27;  
  
receive any assistance during this cam­  
paign:  
&quot;That it was prudent to fix among our­  
selves the terms on which wo would fbrm  
alliancc, before we declared we would form  
one at all events:  
&#x27;&#x27;And that if these were agreed on, and  
our Declaration of Independence ready by  
the time our Ambassador should bo prepared  
to sail, it would be as well as to go into  
that Declaration at this day.&quot;

turn now to the other 6ide, and read the co­  
gent arguments of the advocates  
of the Dec­  
laration, and who embodied in their reasons  
the views of that other and dominant clase  
who had resolved that, living or dying, ihey  
would bo independent­  
&quot;No gentleman.&quot; said the Adamses, Lee,  
Wrythe, Jefferson, and those on this side,  
&quot;had argued against the policy or tho right  
of separation from Britain, nor had supposed  
it possible we should ever renew our con­  
nexion thatthey had only opposed it bein®  
now declared:  
&quot;That the question was not whether, by  
a Declaration of Independence, we Bhou&#x27;d  
make ourselves what vve are not, but wheth­  
er we should declare a fact which already  
existe:  
&quot;That as to the People or Parliament of  
England, vve had always been independent  
ofthem, their restraints on our trade deriv­  
ing efficacy from our acquiescence only, and  
not from any rights they possessed of impo­  
sing them, and that, so far, our connexion  
had been fed eral only, and was now dissolved  
by the commencement of hostilities:  
&quot;That, as to the King, we had been bound  
to him by allegiance, but that this bond was  
now dissolved by his aeseut to the late act  
of Parliament, by which ho declares usout  
of his protection, and by his levying war on  
us, a fact which had long ago proved us out  
of his protection it being a certain position  
in law, that allegiance and protection are  
reciprocal, the one ceasing when the other  
is withdrawn:  
&quot;That James 11 never declared the peo­  
ple of England out of his protection, yet his  
actions proved it, and tho Parliament der  
clarrd it:  
&quot;No delegates then can be denjed, or ev­  
er want, a power of declaring an existant  
truth:  
&quot;That the delegates from the Delaware  
counties having declared their constituents  
ready to join, there are only two colonies,  
Pennsylvania and Maryland, whose dele­  
gates are absolutely tied up, anu that these  
had, by their instructions only reserved a  
right of confirming or rejecting the measure:  
&quot;That, the instructions from Pennsylva­  
nia might be accountcd for from the time in  
which they were drawn, near twelve months  
ago. since which the face of affairs has to­  
tally changed:  
  
I hat within that time, it had become  
apparent that Britain was determined to  
accept nothing less than a cartc blanch, and  
that the King&#x27;s answer to the Lord Mayor,  
Aldermen, and Common Council of London  
which had come to hand four days ago, must  
have satisfied every one of this point:  
&quot;That the People wait for us to lead the  
way:  
&#x27;•That they are in favor of the measure,  
though the instructions given by some of  
their representatives are not:  
&quot;That the voice of the representatives is  
not always consonant with the voice of the  
people, and that this is remarkably the case  
in these middle colonies,  
&quot;That the effect of the resolution ofthe  
15th of May has proved this, which raising  
the murmirs of some in the colonies of  
Pennsylvania and Maryland, called forth  
the opposiong voice ofthe freer part of the  
people, and proved them to be the majority  
even in these colonies:  
&quot;That the backwardness of these two col­  
onies might be ascribed, partly to the influ­  
ence of proprietary power and connexion,  
and partly to their having not yet beep at­  
tacKed by the enemy:  
&quot;That these causes were not likely to be  
soon removed, as therw seemed no probabili­  
ty that the enemy would make either of  
these tho seat of this summer&#x27;s war:  
&quot;That it would he vain to wait either  
weeks or months for perfect unanimity since  
it was impossible that all men should ever  
become of one sentiment on any question:  
&quot;That the conduct of some colonies, from  
the beginning of this contest, had given  
reason to suspect it was their settled poli­  
cy to keep in the rear of tlie confederacy,  
that their particular prospect might be bet­  
ter, even in the worst event:  
&#x27;&#x27;That, therefore, it was necessary for  
those colonies who had thrown themselves  
forward and hazarded all from the begin­  
ning, to come forward now also, and put  
all again to their own hazard:  
  
That the history of the Dutch revolu­  
tion, of whom three States only confedera­  
ted at first, proved that a secession of some  
colonies would not be so dangerous as some  
apprehended:  
&#x27;•That a Declaration of Independence a­  
.&#x27;one could render it consistent with Europe­  
an delicacy for European Powers to treat  
with us or even to receive an Ambassador  
from us  
&quot;That till thfen, they would not receive  
our vessels into their ports, nor acknowl­  
edge the adjudications of our courts of ad­  
miralty to be estimate, in cases of capture  
of British vessels:  
  
That though France &amp;c Spain may be jeal­  
ous of our rising power, they must think it  
will be much more formidable with the ad­  
dition of Great Britain, and will therefore  
see it their interest to prevent a coalition  
but should they refuse, we shall remain  
where we are whereas, without trying, we  
shall never kpow whether they will aid us  
or not  
&quot;The contemplated campaign may beun­  
sqccesgf&#x27;ul, and therefore we need never pro­  
pose an alliance while our affairs wore a  
hopeful aspect  
&quot;That to wait the event of this campaign  
will cretainly work delay, because, durir.g  
this summer, France may assist us effectu­  
ally, by cutting off those supplies ofprovisr  
ione from Eng&#x27;and and Ireland, on which  
the enemy&#x27;s armies here are to depend or  
by setting in motion the great power they  
have collected in the West Indies, and call­

ration. In their report, which was made on the 12th of July,  
1776, it was resolved, among other things, “ that all charges of  
war, and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common  
defense or general welfare, shall be defrayed out of a common  
treasury, which shall be supplied by the several colonies in pro-  
portion to the number of inhabitants of every age, sex, and quality,  
except Indians not paying taxes, ineach colony.” ‘The report was  
discussed in committee of the whole house. ‘The debates upon  
the article under consideration were partially preserved by Mr.  
Jefferson, and are published in the first volume of the Madison  
Papers. It was moved by Mr. Chase of Maryland, as an amend-  
ment to the resolution of the committee, “that the quotas should be  
paid not by the number of inhabitants of every condition, but by  
that of ‘ the white inhabitants.’’’ Mr. Chase remarked, that “he  
considered the number of inhabitants as a tolerable good crite-  
rion of property, and thought it the best mode of apportioning  
taxes, with one exception only. He observed that negroes are  
property, and as such can not be distinguished from the lands or  
personalities held in those where there are few slaves. There is  
no more reason,” he said, “ for taxing the southern states on the  
farmer’s head and on his slave’s head, than the northern ones on  
their farmer’s heads and the heads of their cattle.” Mr. John  
Adams, in reply, observed, “that the number of people were  
taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the state, and  
not.as subjects of taxation. ‘That as to this matter, it was of no  
consequence by what name you called your people, whether by

of itstax.” Mr. Harrison, of Virginia, proposed as a compromise,  
that two slaves should be counted as one freeman, as they did no  
more than the work of one. The amendment of Mr. Chase was  
rejected. ‘This was the first occasion, we believe, in which any  
question as to slaves was discussed in the councils of the nation.  
It was a question as to the productiveness of different classes of

Hpkins and Doctor Franklin, and tecorded at the  
t me by Mr Jeflerson, will be listened to, even at the pre  
sent day, with proper respect and attention.  
The quest m arose under the I 1th article of the pro  
posed confederacy, which declare that all charges of  
&quot;war and other expenes that shall be incurred for the  
&quot;commond lence, or general welfare, shall be defrayed  
&quot;out of a com non Treasury which shall be supplied by  
&quot;the several Colonies, in prop rtion to the number of in­  
&quot;habi ants of every age, sex and qoality, excepting in  
&quot;Ians not paying taxes.&quot;  
Mr. Chise, of Maryland, I roposed to amend the arti­  
ele by intreducing the word &quot;White&quot;- and his argn  
ment was as fol ows: He admitted th at laxation shauld  
be aheans in propertion to property, that this sects in  
theory the trne ealme, but tha fom, a vartety of difll u  
ties it was a rule which could oever be adop ed in prac  
tice. The value of the prperty in every State, could  
never te estimited jus ly and equally. S me otht  
mensure for the weaith of the State uust be devised  
Dome standard referred to which would be more simple  
He considered the pu nber of mhebitants as a telrably  
tion of property, and that this might always  
be obtained. He therefre thought it the best mode,  
they could adopt with one erception only. He obser­  
ved that negroes are proper y, and as such cannot be dis­  
roguished from the lands, or personalities hald in those  
States where there are few slaves. That the surplus of  
profit which a N rthern farmer is able to lay by, he  
invests in catile, horses &amp;c, whereas a Sou hern far  
mer lays out the same sorplus in slaves. There is no  
more reason therefore for taxing the Southern States on  
the farmer&#x27;s head and on his slave&#x27;s head, than the North  
ern ones, on their Farmer&#x27;s, heads, and the heads of their  
cattl; that the method proposed would therefore, tix the  
Southern Stales, according to their numbers and the I  
wealth conjointly, while the Northern would be taxed  
on numbers only; that Negroes, in fact, shoull not be  
consbdered as members of the stute more than cattle, and  
that they have no more interest in it.  
The reader will remark the admission that taxatimn  
an property should always accompany each other in pro­  
portion. He admits that numbers furnish a good grne­  
ral criterion of the subjects of taxation, with one exeeption,  
and that was that slaves were not to enter into the enn­  
meratien- and he assigns as good reasons for that proposi  
tiei, as ever could be or even have been addeced, frem  
  
prsent day. But that argoment in favour af  
Judge Chase&#x27;s one exception, was pat by Mf, John I  
ams, in the following way: He said &quot;that the  
of peotle were taken by this article, as an indey f  
wealth of the S ate, and not as subjects of taxat of the  
to this matter, it was of no consequence hif telint  
you called your people, whether by that of ftol etme  
that in s me cuntries the lahiring  
called free men, in others they were called slave ete  
that the difference as to the s ates was imaginarr but  
what matters it, whether a landlord empl ying ten totly,  
ers on his farm gives them annually as much m heyof  
with by them the necessaries of life of gives themy as  
necessaries at short hand? The ten laborers add as te  
wealth annually to the state, iners ase its ewgots a  
in the one case as the other. Certainly 500 treuch  
produce no more profit, no greater surplus f te  
ment of taxes than 500 slaves. Therefore the sty  
which the laborers are called free men should be evel in  
more than the se in which there are those calledslaveg Sno

are he index of that wealth and can there be a doutt that  
our Western brethren would insist on counting our slave  
population, exac ly as heir white populat on shoould ha  
counted and would they not be right in assuming that  
ground. Therefore the conveise, the right must b leng  
to eeeeee  
  
In the sime debate, Mr. Harrison from Virginia pr  
posed, as a compromise, that two slaves should he count  
ed as one free man; he affirmed that slaves dil hot dea­  
much work as free men and doubted if two effect d more  
than one; that this was proved by the price of labt, the  
hire of a laborer in the Sot thern col ntes being f om S  
to 1? while in the Northern it was genetally $4,  
Mr. Wilson from Pennsvlvania said that if thes a bend­  
ment should tike plice, the Southern laaboters would  
have all the benefit of slaves while the Nor hern ones  
would have the burthen; hat slaves increas the prefits of a  
S ate, which the Southerms ates mean to take t then selves  
that they also increase the bur hen of defence which  
would of course fal soo moch he heaviet on the Norh­  
ern; that slaves occupy the plice of freemen and eat their  
fod. Dismiss your slares and frcemen tcill take their  
places. It is our duty to Lry every discouragement on  
the importation of slaves; but this amendmen! wuld give  
he jus trium libororim to him who woald import the n  
ar. &quot;That exverience shows that those colonies have  
been always able to pay must, which have the tost in.  
habi an&#x27;s, whe ther they be black or white and the prac­  
tice of the Southern col nies has always been to make  
every, farmer pay fol tages, upon all his laborers  
whether they be black or whife.&quot; He acknow ledge i  
deed that freemen work the mest, but they consume the  
most also. They do not produce a greater surplus for  
taxation. The slave is neither fed nor clothed so expe  
sively as a free man--again whise women are exempted  
from labors generally, but negrn women are not. In ti  
then, the Southern States have an advantage as the ars  
ticle tow stands. It has some imes been said that sla  
very is necessary, because the commedities they raise  
would be too dear for market, if cultivated by free­  
men, but now it is said that the labor of the slave is the  
dearest. Mr. Payne, urged, the criginal resdution of  
Congress to proportion quots of the Stales to the number  
of sonts.  
D etor With rapoon of New Jersey was of opinion  
that the vabte of lands and huses was he best estimate  
of the weelth of a nation, that it was practicable to ob  
tain such a valualion. This is the true baromater of  
wealth. The one now progosed is imperfect in itsell  
and unequal b tween the states. It has been objected  
hat negroes eat the fo d of freemen and therefore should  
be taxed; horses also eat the food of freemen, therefore  
they also should be taxed. It has been said too that in  
cartying slaves into the estimate of taxes the slave is  
to pay. We do no more than those slaves themselves do  
who always take slaves into the es imate of the taxes the  
indivadual is to pay. But the cases are not parallel. in  
the Southern colonies shires perrade the whole colony  
but they do not perrade the whole continent, that as to the  
originid resolution of Congress to proportion the quetas  
according to the sonls it was temporary only and feluted  
to the monies heretofore omitted, whereas, we are now  
entering into a new compact and therefore stand on origi-  
nal ground.  
  
I he question being put the amendment was rejectd  
by the votes of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode  
Islnd, Connec icut, Ne York, New Jersey and Penn­  
svlvania, ag inst those of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,

each colony shall have one vole.&quot;  
Mr. Chase &quot;observed that this article was the most  
likely to divide us of any one proposed in the draught then  
under cinsideration, that the larger colonies had threa en  
ed they would not confederate at al, if their weight in  
Congress should not be equal to the numbers of people  
they added to the confederacy, while the smaller ones  
declared against a Union, if they did not retaln an equal  
vote for the protection of their rights. That it was of  
the utmest consequence to bring the parties together as  
(shou&#x27;d we sever from each other,)either no foreign p wer  
will ally with us at all, or the different States will form  
ltfferent alliances, and thus increased the horrors of those  
e nes of civil war and blood shed which in such a stale  
of s paration and independence would render us a misera­  
ble people. That our imprtance, our interest, our peace  
required that we should confederate and that unusual sac  
tifices should be made to affect a compromise of this difhi­  
cult question. He was of opinion the smaller colonies  
would lse their rights if they were not in some instances  
illowed an equal vote, and therefore that a diserimina,  
tion shou&#x27;d take place among the questions which would  
cme before Congress. That the smaller States should  
be secured in all qiestions concerning life and liberin.  
and the gr ater ones, in all respecting properly. He  
there fore proposed that in rotes relating to money, the  
soice of each colomy should be proportioned to the numbo  
of its inhahitots&quot;  
Docior Franklin &quot;thought that the rote should, be   
proportioned in all cases. He took notice that the Dela  
ware counties have bound up their delegates to disigree  
to this article. &quot;He thought it a very extraordinary lan­  
guage to be held by any stite that they wcould not con­  
federate tith us, unless tce would let them dispose of oln  
monen oeee oe a e a  
Certain&#x27;y if we vote equally we ought to pay equally  
but the snaller states, will hardly purchase the privelege  
at this price. That had he lived in as ate where the  
representation, originally equal had become unequal, b  
time and accident, he might have submitted rather that  
disturb the Government, but that we should be very  
wrong to set out in this practice when it is in our powcf

original agreement of Congress to vote by colonies and  
therefore was for their voting in all cases according to  
the number of taxables.&quot;  
D ctor Witherspoon contended &quot;that if an equal vote  
be refused, the smaller states will become the vassals of  
the larger.&quot; He admitted that equality of representa  
tion was an excellent principle, but hen it must be of  
things that are coordinate, that it is of things similar and  
of the same nature, that nothing relating to individuels  
could ever come before Congress, n thing but what  
would respect colonies, Ac, &amp;c.  
John Adams advocated the roting in proportion to  
numbers. He said that we stand here as the represer  
titives of the people; that in some states the people were  
many in o hers they are few, that therefore their vote  
should be proporlioned to the numbers from whom il  
comes. Reason, Justice, and equily never had wceight  
enough on the face of the earth to g rern the connci&#x27;s  
of men. It is interest alone ichich does it und if ts infer  
est alone which cun be trusted, that therefore, the inter  
ests within doors should be the mathemat cal represen­  
tatives of the interests withont doors, that the individu­  
ality of the Colonies is a mere sound. Does the individ  
uality of a Colony increase its wealh or numbers? It  
it does, pay equally. If it does not, add weight in the  
scale of the confederacy, it cannnt Add to their rights or  
weight in a gument. A. has $50, B.6500 and C.41000,  
in partnership, is it just they should equally dispose of  
the monies of the partnership?&quot; II held that &quot;all thos  
reasons whi h prove the justice and expediency of equal  
representation in other assemblics&quot; held a od ther  
Dr. Iush, argped, that a part of our rights is deposited  
in the hands of our Legislatures, there it tens admitled  
there should be an equality of representution. Another  
part of our rights is depesited in the hads of Congress.  
Why is it not equally nee ssary there should be an e

Mr. Chase moved that the quotas should be  
paid, not by tbo number of inhabitants of every  
condition, but by that of tho &quot; white inhabitants.&quot;  
Ho admitted that taxation should he  
always in proportion to property ; that this  
was. in theory, the true rule; hut that, from a  
variety of difficulties, it was a rule which could  
lover he adapted in practice. The value of the ,

od justly and equally. Some other measure  
or tho wealth of the State must therefore ho  
oviscd? some standard referred to ? which  
rould he moro simple. Ho considered tho  
umber of inhabitants as a tolerably good cri- I  
jrion of property, and that this might always  
0 obtained. Mo therefore thought it tho bo.-t &lt;  
&gt;ode wo could adopt, with ono exception only.  
le observed that negroes are property, and, as I  
joh, cannot be distinguished from tho lands or 1  
eraonalitioH held in those States where there , &#x27;  
ro few slaves ; that the surplus of profit which &#x27;  
Northern farmer is able to lay by, be invests  
1 cattlo, horsos. ire.; whereas a Southern j(  
inner lays out that same surplus in slaves. , &lt;  
&#x27;hero is no more reason, therefore, for taxing t  
10 Southern States on tho farmer&#x27;s bead and &#x27;  
n his slave&#x27;s head, than tho Northern ones on  
ieir farmers&#x27; heads and the heads of their 1  
attle; that tho method proposed would there- 1  
&gt;re tax tho Southern States according to their *  
umbers and their wealth, conjunctly, whilo 1  
le Northern would be taxed on numbers only: ?  
Itat negri?os, in fact, should not bo considered 1  
s members of tho State, more than cattle, and  
!iat they have no more interest in it.  
Mr. John A dams observed, that tho numbers 1  
f people were taken by this article as an inlex  
of the wealth of the State, and not as subects  
of taxation ; that, as to this matter, it was  
f no consequence by what name you called  
rour jieople?whether by that of freemen or of  
laveH; that in some countries tho laboring  
xtor were called freemen, in others they were  
jailed slaves ; hut that the difference as to the  
State was imaginary only What matters it,  
whether a landlord, employing ten laborers on  
his farm, gives them annually as much money  
as will buy them the necessaries of life, or gives  
them those necossaries at shnrt hand7 The  
  
ten laborers add as much wealth annually to  
the State?incroose it* exports as much?in the &#x27;  
one case as the other. Certainly, five hundred t  
froeinon produce no more profits?no greater j  
surplus tor tho payment of taxes?than five j  
hundred slaves Therefore, the State in which  
are the laborers called freemen should ho taxed  
no more than that in which are those called  
slaves. Suppose, by any extraordinary operation  
of nature or of law, ono half tho loiterers  
of a State could, in ono night, ho transformed  
into slaves ? would the Stato ho inodo tho  
poorer, or the less tilde to pay the taxes f That  
the condition of the laboring poor in most  
countries?that of the fi-hermen, particularly,  
of the Northern States?is as abject as that of  
slaves. It is tho number of laborers which  
produces tho surplus for taxation and numbers,  
therefore, indiscriminately, are tho fair  
iudex of wealth ; that it is the use of the word  
&quot;property &quot; here, and its application to some  
of the |&gt;eoplo of the Stato, which produces tho  
fallacy. How does the Southern farmer pro- j  
cure slaves &#x27; Kitlier by importation, or by  
purchoso from his neighbor If ho imports u  
slave, he adds one to the number of laborers in  
his country, and proportionally to its profits  
and abilities to pay taxes if lie buys from his  
neighbor, it is only a transfer of a laborer  
from one farm to another, which does not  
ehango the annual produce of tho State, and,  
therefore, should not ehango its tax that if a  
Northern l&#x27;urmvr works ten laborers on his  
farm, ho can, it is true, invest tho surplus of  
too men s labor in eattle ; but so may the  
Southern farmer, working ten slaves that a  
State of one hundred thousand freemen can  
maintain no inure oat&#x27;lo than one of one hun- I  
dred thousand slaves?therefore, they ha\? no  
more of that kind of property ; that a slave  
may, indeed, from the custom of speech, be  
more properly oalled the wealth of his master,  
than tne tree laborer ini ght be called tbe wealth  
of hia employer but, as to the State, both&#x27;wero  
equally its wealth, and should, therefore, equally  
add to the quota of its tax,  
Mr. Harrison proposed, as a compromise,  
that two slaves should he counted us ouo freeman.  
He uihrmed tlut slaves did not do us  
much work as freemen, and doubted if two  
  
KA, WASHINGTON,  
effected more than one. That thin wan proved  
j by the price of labor, the hire of a laborer in  
Southern Colonies being from ?8 to ?12, while  
in the Northern it wait generally ?24.  
Mr. Wilson said, that, if this amendment  
should take place, the Southern Colonies would  
have all the benefit of slaved, whilst the  
: Northern ones would bear the burden. That  
slaves increase the profits of a State, which  
the Southern States mean to tako to themi  
selves; that they also increase the burden of  
1 defence, which would of course fall so much  
the heavier on the Northern; that slaves occupy  
the places of freemen, and eat their food.  
Dismiap your slaves,&#x27; and freemen will take  
take their places. It is our duty to lay every  
discouragement on the importation of slaves;  
but this amendment would give the jus trium  
? *&quot; ivVio ironIH ininort slaves,  
  
That other kind* of profierty were pretty  
equally distributed through all the Colonies  
there were an many cattle, horses, and sheep,  
in the North as the .South, and South as tht  
North?but not so an to slaves. That experience  
has shown that those Colonies have been  
always able to pay most, which have the most  
inhabitants, whether they be black or white  
and the practico of the Southern Colonics hat  
always been to make every farmer pay poll taxei  
upon all his laborers, whether they be black  
or white. He acknowledged indeed that free  
men work the most; but they consume the  
most also.  
They do not produce a greater surplus foi  
; taxation. TheBlavels neither fed nor clothec  
j so expensively as a freeman Again, whih  
I women are exempted from labor generally  
which negro women are not. In this, then  
i the Southern States have an advantage, as th&lt;  
; article now stands It has sometimes been saic  
I that slavery was necessary, because the com  
modities they raise would be too dear for mar  
ket if cultivated by froemen; but now it is saic  
that the labor of the slave is the dearest.  
Mf. Payne urged the original resolution oi  
Coogfeaa to proportion the quotas of the Statei  
to the number of souls  
Dr. Witherspoon was of opinion that the  
  
i value ol lands una houses was the best estimate  
of the wealth of a nation; and that it wa*  
practicable to obtain such a valuation Tliit  
i is the true barometer of wealth. The one now  
i proposed is imperfect in itself, and unequal bo  
i tween the State&#x27;. It has been objected thai  
negroes cat the food of freemen, and therefore  
should be taxed; horses also eat the food ol  
freemen, therefore they also should be taxed  
It has been said, too, that in carrying slavw  
into the estimate of the taxes the State is tc  
pay, we do no more than those States themselves  
do, who always take slaves into the estimate  
of the taxes the individual is to pay  
Hut the cases are not parallol. In the Southern  
Colonies slaves pervade the whole Colony  
hut they do not pervade the whole continent  
That as to the original resolution of Congress,  
it was temporary only, and related to the moneys  
heretofore emitted; whereas we are now  
entering into a new compact, and therefore  
stand on original ground.

[Mr. Scmver] says that sterility tracks the

are the answers. But I appeal from the Mosaic  
whig of to-day to the genuine whig of 1776. I  
appeal to old John Adams, revered still in Bos­  
ton. He said, in 1776: &quot;That as to this mat­  
ter (the wealth of a State) it was of no conse­  
quence by what name you called your people,  
whether by that of freemen or of slaves. That  
in some countries the laboring poor were called  
freemen, in others they were called slaves;  
but that the difference as to the State was im­  
aginary only. What matters it whether a land­  
lord, employing ten laborers on his farm, gives I  
tliem annually as much money as will buy them  
them the necessaries of life, or gives them  
those necessaries at short hand? The ten  
laborers add as much wealth annually to the  
State, increase its export as much, in the one  
case as the other. Certainly five hundred free­  
men produce no more profits,, no greater sur­  
plus for the payment of taxes, than five hun­  
dred slaVes. Suppose by any extraordinary  
operation of nature, or of law, one-half the  
laborers of a State could, in the course of one  
night, be transformed into slaves. Would the  
State be made the poorer, or the less able to  
pay taxes ? That the condition of the laboring  
poor in most countries?that of the fishermen&quot;  
particularly of the northern States?is anabject  
as that of the slaves.&quot;?(Madison Papers, 1st

The committee rose and reported their reso-  
lution to the House. Mr. Edward Rutledge, of  
South Carolina, then requested the determination  
might be put off to the next day, as he believed  
his colleagues, though they disapproved of the  
resolution, would then join in it for the sake of  
unanimity.  
  
This “ request,” according to the journal,  
and according to Mr. Jefferson, Lord Mahon,  
with his usual facility, changes for something  
else better adapted to sustain his own views.  
With him it was not a mere “ request” to post-

amended by him it becomes a declaration the  
delegates of South Carolina *“ were induced”  
to make of their reasons for voting for the

paid in money, the representative of products—under ours in  
products themselves. One of your own most distinguished  
statesmen and patriots—President John Adams—said that  
the difference to the slave was ‘‘imaginary.’’ ‘*‘ What mat-

on his farm gives them annually as much money as will buy  
them the necessaries of life, or gives them those necessaries at  
shorthand?’’ All experience has shown that, if that be the  
measure of labor, it is safer for the laborer to take his wages  
in products than in their supposed pecuniary value. There-  
fore, if we pay in the necessaries and benefits of life more than  
any given amount of pecuniary wages will buy, then our  
laborer is paid higher than the laborer who receives tha

The pussillanimous idea th at we had  
friends in England worth keeping term  
ith, still haunted the minds of many.  
For this reason those parasges whichen  
censures on the people of England  
were struck out, lest they should  
them offence. The clause too, reprob  
enslaving the inhabitants of Af­  
rica, was struck out, in compliance of  
South Carolina and Georgia, who had  
never attempted to restrain the impori

as population. The Northern mem-  
bers judged differently. Among  
them was Mr, Adams.  
  
Mr. Adams said, “that it was of  
no consequence by what name you  
call your people, whether by that  
of freemen or of slaves; that in  
some countries the laboring poor  
were called freemen; in others,  
they were called slaves; but the  
difference to the State was imagi-  
nary only. What matters it whether  
a landlord, employing ten laborers  
on his farm, gives them annually as  
much money ag will buy the neces-  
saries of life, or gives them those  
necessaries at short hand? The  
ten laborers add as much wealth  
annually to the State, increase the  
exports as much in one case as in  
the other. Five hundred freemen  
produce no more profits, no greater  
surplus for the payment of taxes  
than five hundred slaves. * * *  
Suppose, by an extraordinary oper-  
ation of Providence, or of law, one  
half of the laborers of a State  
could, in the course of a night,  
be transferred into slaves, would  
the State be made the poorer?  
The condition of the laboring poor  
in most countries, that of the fish-  
ermen particularly in the Northern  
States, is as abject as that of slaves.  
* * How does the Southern  
farmer procure slaves? Either by  
importation or by purchase. If he  
imports a slave, he adds one to the  
number of laborers in the country ;  
if he buys from his neighbor, it is  
only the transfer of a laborer from  
one farm to another, which does not

change the production of the  
State. * * A slave may, from  
the custom of speech, be more  
properly called the wealth of his  
master, than the free laborer can  
be called the wealth of his employ-  
er, but as to the State, both are it

| Mr. John Adams observed, that the numbers of people  
were taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the  
State, and not as subjects of taxation. That as tothis mat-  
  
your people, whether by that of freemen or of slaves. That  
in some countries the laboring poor were called freemen,  
in others they were called slaves: but that the difference  
as to the State was imaginary only. What matters it  
whether a landlord employing ten laborers on his farm gives  
them annually as much money as will buy them the neces-  
saries of life, or gives them those necessaries at short hand ?  
The ten laborers add as much wealth annually to the State,  
increase its exports as much, in the one case as the other.  
| Certainly five hundred freemen produce no more profits, no  
greater surplus for the payment of taxes, than five hundred  
slaves. Therefore the State in which are the laborers called  
freemen, should be taxed no more than that in which are  
those called slaves. Suppose, by any oe opera-  
tion of nature or of law, one half the laborers of a State  
could, in the course of one night, be transformed into slaves,  
would the State be made the poorer, or the less able to pay  
taxes? That the condition of the laboring poor in most  
countries—that of the fishermen, particularly, of the north-  
ern States—is as abjectas that of slaves. It is the number  
| of laborers which produces the surplus for taxation; and  
numbers, therefore, indiscriminately, are the fair index of  
wealth. That it is the use of the word * | yay here, and  
its application to xome of the people of the State, which  
produces the fallacy. How does the southern farmer  
cure slaves? Either by importation or by purchase frem  
his neighbor. [f he imports a slave, he adds one to the  
number of laborers in his country, and propertionably to its  
So and abilities to pay taxes; if he buys from his neigh-  
, it is only a transfer of a laborer from one farm to an-  
other, which does not the annual produce of the  
State, and therefore should not change its tax; that if a  
northern farmer works ten laborers on his farm, he can, it  
| is true, invest the surplus of ten men’s labor in cattle; but  
#0 may the southern farmer working ten slaves. That a

more reason for taxing the Southern  
States on the farmer’s head and on his

 in the debates in the Convention which  
formed the first confederation, five years after  
the signing of the Declaration of Independence,  
Mr. Chase says &quot;the negroes are property, and  
as such cannot be distinguished from the lands  
or personalities held in those States where  
there are few slaves;&quot; and not only does Mr.  
John Adams, of Massachusetts, together with  
the whole assembly, acquiesce in this assertion,  
but Mr. Adams further says:  
It is of no consequence by what name you call your  
people, whether by that of freemen or of slaves. la  
some countries the iaboring poor are called freemen, in  
others they are called slaves; but the difference as to the  
state is imaginary only. The condition of the laboring  
poor in most countries, that of the fishermen particularly  
of the Northern States, is as abject as that of slaves.  
Mr. Lincoln will find this in vol. i. p.28 of  
Jefferson&#x27;s works, immediately following his  
autograph draft of the Declaration of Inde-­  
pendence.  
There is no gainsaying these facts and argu­  
ments. The parties to the Declaration of  
Independence were the white men of the  
colonies, and they asserted their equality with  
the white men of Great Britain who attempted  
to enslave them. They did not assert th

sis of the plan of Confederation reported by the  
committee, of whom Mr. Dickinson was chair  
man, on the 12th of July, 1776. And when  
did disunion begin? In the very first debate  
had on the report of the committee--on the 30th  
and 31st of the same July, whose founth day will  
ever be memorable for the Declaration thereon  
made. Article xi. read as follows--&quot;All charges  
of war and all other expenses that shall be incur­  
red for the common defence or general welfare and  
allowed by the United States assembled, shall be de  
frayed out of a common treasury which shall be  
supplied by the several colonies in proportion to the  
number of inhabitants of every age, sex and quaili-  
ty, except Indians not paying taxes, in each colonyg:  
a true accoult of which, distinguislen the white  
inhabitants, shall be triennually taken and transmit  
ted to the Assembly of the United States.  
Mr. Samue! Chase, elegate from Ma  
ryland, moved that the quotas should be  
paid, not by the number of inhabitants of every  
condition, but by that of the white inhabitants. He  
insisted, in support of his amendment, &quot;there is no  
more reason fon taxing the Southern States on the  
farmer&#x27;s head and on his slaye&#x27;s head, than the  
Northern ones in their farmers&#x27; heads and the heads  
of their cattle. That the method proposed would  
tax the Southern States according to their numbers  
and their wealth conjunctly; while the Northern  
would he taxed on numbers only; that negroes in  
fact should not be considered as members of the  
State more than cattle, and that they have no more  
interest in it.&quot; Mr. John Adams, of Massachu­  
setts, mpaisted upon the plan as reported by the  
Commitiee, and so also Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania,  
who sa. &quot;If this amendment should take place,  
the Southern Colonies would have all the benefit of

State, which the Southern States mean to take to  
themselyes; that they also increase the burthen of  
defence which, of course, would fail so much  
heavier on the Northern States; that slayes occu  
py the place of freemen and eat their food. Dismiss  
your slaves and freemen will take their places.&quot;  
It was wittily replied: &quot;It has been objected that  
negroes eat the food of freemen, and therefore  
should be taxed--horses also eat the food of free.

and reported the resolution to the House,  
Edward Rutledge, of South Carolina, moved  
a postponement to the next day (the I&#x27;d), in  
order to induce his colleagues to vote for it.  
On the 2d it was passed in Congress by the  
votes of twelve States, made up to that num­  
ber by the additional votes of South Carolina,  
Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s  
account of these I a it two votes is that a third  
member from Delaware had come post ex­  
pressly to vote for the resolution, and thus  
the vote of that State was cast for it;  
and he adds that &quot;members of a  
different sentiment attending that morn­  
ing from Pennsylvania g her vote was  
changed, so that the whole twelve colonies  
who were authorized to vote at all gave their  
voices for it; and within a few days (July !t)  
the convention of New York approved of  
it, and thus supplied the void occasioned by  
the withdrawing of her delegates from the  
vote.&quot; It is thus apparent that whether the  
vote of Pennsylvania was changed by a single  
member of her delegation, or, as Mr. Jeffer­  
son intimates, by more than one, there never  
was a moment in the whole proceeding when  
the resolution needed the casting vote of

&quot;clung to the pusillanimous idea that we  
had friends in England worth keeping  
terms with,&quot; and for this reason Congress  
delayed final action on the subject; and  
for this reason, also, observes the same  
writer, &quot;those passages which conveyed  
censure on the people of England were  
struck out, lest they should give them of­  
fense. The clause, too. reprobating the en­  
slaving the inhabitants of Africa was  
struck out, in compliance to South Caro­  
lina and Georgia, who had never at­  
tempted to restrain the importation of  
slaves, and who, on the contrary, still  
wish to continue it.&quot; On the first of July  
these changes were made, and. the adop­  
tion of the declaration was debated until  
the evening of the fourth, when it  
finally passed. And by the passage of this  
declaration at that time the fourth of July  
has become a memorable day. That great  
event also led to other glorious events  
that have resulted favorably to the ad­  
vancement of free government in this  
country.  
For these reasons the people of this  
country have cause to gratefully remem­

He has waged cruel war against human nature  
itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and  
liberty in the persons of a distant people, who  
never offehded him, captivating and carrying  
them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to  
incur miserable death in their transportation  
thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium  
of infidel powers, is the warfare of the CHRISTIAN  
King of Great Britain. Determined to keep open  
a market where MEN should be bought and sold,  
he has prostituted his negative for suppressing  
every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain  
this execrable commerce. And that this assem-  
blage of horrors might want no fact of distin-  
guished dye, he is now exciting those very people  
to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that  
liberty of which he has deprived them by murder-  
ing the people upon whom he obtruded them:  
thus paying off former crimes committed against  
the LIBERTIES of one people with crimes which he  
urges them to commit against the LIvEs of an-  
other. ;  
  
In every stage of these oppressions we have  
petitioned for redress in the most humble terms :  
our repeated petitions have been answered only by  
repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus  
marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is  
unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be  
free. Future ages will scarce believe that the  
hardiness of one man adventured, within the  
short compass of twelve years only, to build a  
foundation so broad and undisguised, for tyranny  
over a people fostered and fixed in principles of  
freedom.  
  
Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our  
British brethren. We have warned them, from  
time to time, of attempts by their Legislature to  
extend a jurisdiction over these our states. We  
have reminded them of the circumstances of our  
emigration and settlement here, no one of which

lf, violating its most sacred  
&quot;rights of life and liberty in the persons of  
&quot;a distant people, who never offended  
&quot;him, captivating and carrying them into  
&quot;slavery, in another hemisphere, or to  
&quot;incur miserable death in their trans  
&quot;portation thither. This piratical war­  
&quot;fare, the opprobrium of infidel powers,  
&quot;in the warfare of a Christian king of  
&quot;Great Britain. Determined to keep open  
&quot;a market where MEN should be bought  
&quot;and sold, he has prostituted his nega­  
&quot;tive for suppressing every legislative  
&quot;attempt to prohibit, or restrain, this  
&quot;execrable commerce; and that this as­  
&quot;semblage of horrors might want no fact  
&quot;of distinguished dye, he is now exciting  
&quot;those very people to rise in arms among  
&quot;us, and to purchase that liberty of which  
&quot;he has deprived them, by murdering  
&quot;the people upon whom he also obtruded  
&quot;them; thus paying off former crimes  
&quot;committed against the liberties of one  
&quot;people, with crimes which he urges  
&quot;them to commit against the lives of  
&quot;another.&quot;  
In every stage of these oppressions we  
have petitioned for redress, in the most hum­  
ble terms; our repeated petitions have been  
answered only by repeated injury. A  
prince whose character is thus marked, by  
every act which may define a tyrant, is  
unfit to be the ruler of a Ifree! people &quot;who  
&quot;mean to be free. Future ages will scarce  
&quot;believe that the hardiness of one man, ad­  
&quot;ventured within the short compass of  
&quot;twelve years only, to build a foundation  
&quot;so broad and undisguised, for tyranny over  
&quot;a people fostered and fixed in principles  
&quot;of freedom.&quot;  
Nor have we been wanting in attention  
to our British brethren. We have warned  
them, from time to time, of attempts made  
by their Legislature &quot;to extend a jurisdic­  
&quot;tion over these our States,&quot; I to extend an  
unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.I We  
have reminded them of the circumstances  
of our emigration and settlement here, &quot;no  
&quot;one of which could warrant so strange a  
&quot;pretension; that these were effected at  
&quot;the expense of our own blood and treas­  
&quot;ure, unassisted by the wealth or the  
&quot;strength of Great Britain; that in con­  
&quot;stituting indeed our several forms of  
&quot;Government, we had adopted one common  
&quot;king, thereby laying a foundation for per­  
&quot;petual league and amity with them; but  
&quot;that submission to their parliament was  
&quot;no part of our Constitution, not ever in  
&quot;idea, if history may be credited; and&quot;  
we Ihavel appealed to their native justice  
and magnanimity, &quot;as well as to&quot; tand we  
have conjured them byl the ties of our  
common kindred, to disavow these usurpa­  
tions, which &quot;were likely to&quot; I would in­  
evitably! interrupt our connexions and  
correspondence. They, too, have been  
deaf to the voice of justice and of consan  
guinity; &quot;and when occasions have been  
&quot;given them by the regular course of their  
&quot;laws, of removing from their councils  
  
&quot;the disturbers of our harmony, they have  
&quot;by their free elections re-established  
&quot;them in power. At this very time, too,  
&quot;they are permitting their chief magistrate  
&quot;to send over not only soldiers of our  
&quot;common blood, but Scotch and foreign  
&quot;mercenaries to invade and destroy us.  
&quot;These facts have given the last stab to  
&quot;agonizing affection, and manly spirit  
&quot;bids us to renounce forever these unfeel­  
&quot;ing brethren. We must endeavor to  
&quot;forget our former love for them, and to  
&quot;hold them as we hold the rest of man  
&quot;Kind, enemies in war, in peace friends.  
&quot;We might have been a free and a great  
&quot;people together; but a communication of  
&quot;grandeur and of freedom, it seems, is  
&quot;below their dignity. Be it so, since they  
&quot;will have it. The road to happiness and  
&quot;lo glory is open to us, too. We will  
&quot;climb it apart from them, and acquiesce  
&quot;in the necessity which denounces our  
&quot;eternal separation.&quot; IWe must, there­  
fore, acquiesce in the necessity which de­  
nounces our separation, and hold them as  
we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in

stage. By this means they will have daily  
information of what is transpiring at Washing-  
ton.  
The Original Declaration of Independ­  
he rough draft of the Declaration of  
Independence, in Jefferson&#x27;s handwriting,  
was signed by all the member of the Con­  
tinental Congress. This paper, after being  
signed, was revised and a number of  
changes made before it was re-signed and  
made public on the 4th of July.  
The most marked omission from the  
original draft was the closing paragraphs of  
the indictment drawn against the king.  
They read as follows, italics and &quot;small  
caps&quot; being marked in the manuscript:  
He has incited treasonable insurrections of  
our fellow-citizens, with the allurements of  
forfeiture and confiscation of our property.  
He has waged cruel war against human nature  
itself, violating its most sacred rights of life  
and liberty in the persons of a distant people  
who never offended him, cantivating and  
carrying them into slavery in another hemis­  
phere or to incur miserable death in their  
transportation thither. This piratical war­  
fare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the  
warfare of the Christian king of Great  
Eritain. Determined to keep open a market  
where Men should be bought and sold, he has  
prostituted his negative for suppressing every  
legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain  
this execrable commerce; and, that this as­  
semblage of horrors might want no fact of dis­  
tinguished dye, he is now exciting those very  
people to rise in arms among us, and to pur­  
chase that liberty of which he has deprived  
them by murdering the people upon whom he  
also obtruded them, thus paying off former  
crimes committed against the liberties of one  
people, with crimes which he urges them to  
commit against the lives of another.  
It is useless to speculate as to what  
would have been the result had these words,  
written by a slaveholder, been per nitted  
to remain in a paper most of the signers of  
which were slaveholders, but it cannot be  
doubted that if they had been retaine

greatest thing that ever emanated from  
the human intellect : — &#x27; When in the  
course o£ human events it becomes  
necessary for one people to dissolve the  
political bauds which have connected  
them with another, and to assume among  
the powers of the earth, the separate  
and equal station to which the laws o£  
Nature and of Nature&#x27;s God entitles  
them, a decent respect to the opinions  
of mankind requires that they should  
declare the muses which impel them to  
the separation. We hold these truths to  
be self-evident : that all men are born  
equal: they are endowed by their Creator  
with certain inherent and invulnerable  
rights : that among these are life and  
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness :  
that to secure these rights, Governments  
aro instituted among iuen, deriving  
their just powers from the consent of  
the governed : that whenever any form of  
Government becomes destructive to these  
ends, it is tlio right of the people to  
? alter or to abolish it, and to  
institute new Government, laying its  
foundation on such principles, and  
organising its powers in such form, as  
to them shall seem most likely to effect  
their safety and happiness. Prudence  
indeed will dictate that Governments  
long established should not be changed  
for light and transient causes ; and  
accordingly all inference hath shown  
that men are more disposed to suiter  
while evils arc sulTurablc, than to  
right themselves by abolishing the forms  
to which they arc accustomed ; but &#x27;  
when a long train of abuses and  
usurpations begun at a distinguished  
period and having invariably the same  
object, evinces a design to reduce them  
under absolute despotism, it is their  
right, it is their duty, to throw oif  
such Government, and to provide new  
guards for their future security. Such  
has been the patiout sufferance of these  
colonies, and such is now the necessity  
which constrains tliem to infringe&#x27;  
their former systems of Government. The  
history of the present action of Great  
Britain is a history of unremitting  
injuries and usurpations among which  
appears no solitary fact to contradict  
the uniform tenor of the rest but all lu  
&#x27;e in direct object the establishment oE  
an absolute tyranny over these States.  
To pio\e this, let facts be submitted to  
a candid i &#x27;oi &#x27;-l for the truth of  
which wo pledge a fntu yet unsullied by  
falsehood. He* has low-eel his assent to

together legislative bodies at places  
unusual, uncom^fortttble, and distant  
from the depository of their public  
records, for the sole purpose of  
&#x27;fatiguing them into compliance with his  
measures : he has dissolved  
representative Houses repeatedly, and  
continually, for opposing with manly  
firmness his invasions on the rights of  
the people ; he has refused for a long  
time to cause other.* to be elected  
whereby the legislative power, incapable  
of annihilation, has returned to the  
people at large for their exercise, the  
State remaining in the meantime exposed  
to all the dangers of invasion from

paying off former crimes committed  
against the libeiiit.n of one people,  
with crimes which ho urges them to  
commit against the lirrit of another. In  
every stage of those oppressions we have  
petitioned for redress in the most  
humble terms. Our repeated petitions  
have been answered only by repeated  
injuries. A Prince whose character is  
thus marked by every act which may  
define a tyrant, is unlit to be the  
ruler of a free people, who want to be  
free. Futur.j nges will scarce believe  
that the hardiness of one man&#x27;s  
adventure, within the short compass of  
11 years only, could mould a foundation  
so broad and undisguised for tyranny for  
a people fostered aud lixed iu principle  
and freedom. Nor have we been wanting in  
appealing to our British brethren. We  
have warned them from time to time of  
attempts by their legislature to extend  
an unwarrantable jurisdiction over  
these, our States. We have reminded them  
of the circumstances of our emigration  
and settlement here, no one of which  
could warrant so strange a pretension :  
that these were effected at the expense  
of our own blood and treasure,  
unassisted by the wealth or strength of  
Great Britain : that in constituting  
indeed, our several forms of government,  
we had adopted one common king, thereby  
laying a foundation for perpetual league  
and unity with them : but that  
submission to their parliament was no  
part or our cuiiautiiuuii. iiui I&#x27;vuiiu

and we have appealed to their native  
justice and magnanimity, and we have  
assured them as well as to the ties of  
our common kindred to disavow these  
usurpations which would inevitably  
interrupt our connection and  
correspondence. They, too. have been

that they should ever again be united with Great Britain, yet they were against adopt-

emigration and settlement here, [no one of which could warrant so  
strange a pretension: that these were effected at the expence of our  
own blood and treasure, unassisted by the wealth or the strength of  
Great Britain: that in constituting indeed our several forms of

Congress was a representation of States,

It is strange that annexiug the name of
