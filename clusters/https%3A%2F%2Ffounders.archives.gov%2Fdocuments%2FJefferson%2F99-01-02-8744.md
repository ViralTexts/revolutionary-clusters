Sep. 23. 08.  
  
To the Inhabitants of the Town of  Winchendon in legal town-meeting assembled.  
  
Your representation and request were received on the 22d. inst. and have been considered with the attention due to every expression of the sentiments and feelings of so respectable a body of my fellow-citizens. No person has seen, with more concern than myself, the inconveniences brought on our country in general, by the circumstances of the times in which we happen to live; times to which the history of nations presents no parallel. For years we have been looking as spectators on our brethren of Europe, afflicted by all those evils which necessarily follow an abandonment of the moral rules which bind men and nations together. Connected with them in friendship and commerce, we have happily so far kept aloof from their calamitous conflicts, by a steady observance of justice towards all, by much forbearance, and multiplied sacrifices. At length however, all regard to the rights of others having been thrown aside, the belligerent powers have beset the high way of commercial intercourse with edicts which, taken together, expose our commerce and mariners, under almost every destination, a prey to their fleets and armies. Each party indeed would admit our commerce with themselves, with the view of associating us in their war against the other; but we have wished war with neither. Under these circumstances were passed the laws of which you complain, by those delegated to exercise the powers of legislation for you, with every sympathy of a common interest in exercising them faithfully. In reviewing these measures therefore we should advert to the difficulties out of which a choice was of necessity to be made. To have submitted our rightful commerce to prohibitions and tributary exactions from others, would have been to surrender our independence. To resist them by arms was war, without consulting the state of things or the choice of the nation. The alternative preferred by the legislature of suspending a commerce placed under such unexampled difficulties, besides saving to our citizens their property, and our mariners to their country, has the peculiar advantage of giving time to the belligerent nations to revise a conduct as contrary to their interests as it is to our rights.   
  
“In the event of such peace, or suspension of hostilities between the belligerent powers of Europe, or of such change in their measures affecting neutral commerce as may render that of the United States sufficiently safe in the judgment of the President,&quot; he is authorised to suspend the embargo. But no peace or suspension of hostilities, no change of measures affecting neutral commerce, is known to have taken place. The Orders of England, and the Decrees of France and Spain, existing at the date of these laws, are still unrepealed, as far as we know. In Spain indeed a contest for the government appears to have arisen; but of it’s course or prospects we have no information on which prudence would undertake a hasty change in our policy, even were the authority of the Executive competent to such a decision.   
  
You desire that, in this defect of power, Congress may be specially convened. It is unnecessary to examine the evidence or the character of the facts which are supposed to dictate such a call: because you will be sensible, on an attention to dates, that the legal period of their meeting is as early as, in this extensive country, they could be fully convened, by a special call.   
  
I should, with great willingness have executed your wishes had peace, or a repeal of the obnoxious edicts, or other changes, produced the case in which alone the laws have given me that authority: and so many motives of justice and interest lead to such changes, that we ought continually to expect them. But while these edicts remain, the legislature alone can prescribe the course to be pursued.

To the Inhabitants of the Town cf Port­  
land, in the Dijbift of Maine, in le­  
gal to-am meeting ajfembled :  
YOUR reprefentation and requeft  
were received on the 29th inft. and  
have been confidercd with the atten­  
tion due to every exprefiion of the  
fentiments and feelings of fo refpeift­  
able a body of my fellow-citizens.—  
No perfon has feen with more con­  
cern than myfclf, the inconveniences  
brought upon our country in general,  
by the circucnftances of the times in  
which we happen to live ; times to  
which the hiftory of nations pre­  
fents no parallel. For years we have  
been looking as fpe&amp;ators on our  
brethren of Europe, afflicted by all  
thofe evils which necefiarily follow an  
abandonment of the moral rules  
which bind men and nations togeth­  
er. Connected with them in friend­  
fkip and commerce, we have happily  
fo far kept aloof from their calami­  
tous conflicts, by a fteady obfervancc  
of juftice towards all, by much for­  
bearance, and multiplied facrifices.—  
At length, however, all regard to the  
rights of others having been thrown  
afidc, the belligerent powers have be­  
fet the highway of commercial inter­  
courfe with edicts, which, taken to­  
gether, expofe our commerce and  
ifiariners, under almoft every defti­  
nation,a prey to their fleets and ar­  
mies. Each party, indeed, would  
admit our commerce with themfelves,  
with the view of aflociating us in  
their war againft the other; but we  
have wifhed war with neither. Un­  
der thefe circumftances were pafled  
I the laws of which you complain, by  
thofe delegated to exercife the powers  
of legiflation for you, with every  
fympathy of a common intereft in  
exercifmg them faithfully. In re­  
viewing thefe meafures, therefore,  
we ihouid advert to the difficulties  
out of which a choice was of notify  
to be made, io have fubmitted our  
rightful commerce to prohibitions &amp;  
tributary exactions, from others,  
would have been to furraidtr cur in­  
  
dependence. Tor,:1ft then.by aMis  
was war, without oonlutting the  
ftate of things, or the choice of the &lt;  
nation. The alternative preferred ,  
by the legiflature, of fufpending a  
commerce placed under fuch unex­  
ampled difficulties, bc/ides faving to  
our citizens their property, and our  
mariners to their country, has the  
peculiar advantage of giving time to  
the belligerent nations to revife a -  
conduft as contrary to their interefts^  
as it is to our rights.  
In the event of fuch peace or fuf- I  
penflon of ho&amp;ilities between the bet- &lt;  
ligerent powers of Europe, or of ]  
fuc\i change in their meafures afFeCk­  
ing neutral commerce as may render &#x27;  
that of the United States fufficiently,,  
iafe in the judgment of the Prcfideut, (  
he is authorized to fufpend the Em- (  
bargo. But no peace or fufpenhon  
of hoftilities, no change of meafures  
affeCting neutral commerce—is known  
to have taken place. The Orders of  
England and the Decrees of France  
and Spain, exifting at the date of  
thefe laws, are ftill unrepealed, as far  
as we know. Io Spain, indeed, a  
conteft for the government appears  
to have arifen ; but of its courfe or  
profpeCts we have no information on

- To the Inbabitants of the Town of BosTON, ir  
legal Town-Meeting assembled.  
Your representation and request  
were received on the 22d inst. and  
have been considered with the atten­  
tion due to every expreflion of the sen­  
timents and feelings of {o refpetable  
a body of my fellow citizens. No  
person has jeen with more concern  
than myfelf, the inconveniences bro’t  
on our country in general, by the cir­  
cumstances of the times in which we  
happen to live ; times to which the  
hitory offnations presents no parallel.  
For years we have been looking as  
fpe&amp;ators on our brethren of Europe,  
affliting with all those evils which ne­  
ceflarily follow an abandonment of  
the (moral rules which bind men and  
natiLns together.—Conne&amp;ed with  
thenm in friendfhip and commerce, we  
hav¢ happily so far kept aloof from  
theil calamitous confliéts, and by a  
steady observance of justice towards  
all, by much forbearance and multi­  
plied facrifices. At length however,  
all rpgard to the rights of others hav­  
ing been thrown aside, the belligerent  
powers have beset the highway of  
commercial intercourse with ediéts,  
which taken together, expose our com­  
merce and mariners, under almost ev­  
ery destination, a prey to their fleets  
and armies. Each party indeed would  
admit our commerce with themselves,  
with the viewof aflociating us in their  
war against the other. But we have  
wished war with neither. Under these  
circamftances were passed the laws of  
which you complain, by those delega­  
ted to exercise the powers of legisla­  
tion for you with every {ympathy of  
a common interest in exercising them  
faithfully. In reviewing these mea­  
sures therefore we fhouid advert to  
the difficulties out of which a choice  
was of neceflity to be made. Tohave  
submitted our rightful commerce to  
prohibitions and tributary exaétions  
from others would have been to sur­  
render our independence. To resist  
them by arms was war, without con­  
sulting the state of things or the choice  
of the nation. The alternative pre­  
ferred by the Legislature of suspending  
a commerce placed under such unex­  
ampled difficalties, besides saving to  
our citizens their property, and our  
mariners to their country, has the pe­  
culiar advantage of giving time to the  
- belligerent nations to revise a conduét  
as contrary to their interests as it is to  
our rights.  
¢ In the event of such peace, or sus­  
pension of hostilities between the bel­  
ligerent powers of Europe, or of such  
change in their measures affe&amp;ing neu­  
tral commerce, as may render that of  
the U. 8. fufficiently fafe, in the judg­  
ment of the President,”” he is author­  
ifed to suspend the embargo. Butno  
peace or suspension of hostilities, no  
change of measures affe@ing neutral  
commerce, is kmown to have taken  
place.—The Orders of England, and  
the Decrees of France and Spain exist­  
ing at the date of these laws, are still  
~unrepealed, as far as we know. In  
. Spain indeed a contest for the Govern­  
ment appears to bave arisen ;—but of  
its course or profpeéts, we have no in­  
formation on which prudence would  
undertake a hasty change in our poli­  
cy, even were the authority of the ex­  
ecutive competent to such a decision.  
You desire that, in this defe&amp; of  
power, Congress may be specially con­  
vened. Itis unnecefiagy to examine  
the evidence or the cHMara&amp;er of the  
faéts, which are fuppoled to di&amp;ate  
such a call : Because you will be sen­  
sible, on an attention to dates, that  
the legal period of their meeting is as  
early as, in this extensive country,  
they could be fully convened by a  
special call. . = SO

ternative preferred by the Legislature of  
suspending a commerce placed under such  
unexampled difficulties, besides saving to

“ In the event of such peace, or suspen­

l is authorised to suspend the embargo. But  
no peace or suspension of hostilities, no  
  
#

The Orders of Eng &lt;v;Ay and the decree*

To the inhabitants of the town of Boston, in legal

Your reprrsontution aril request were received  
on the 22d lost, and have l» en considered with tlir  
attention du. to every expression of the sentiments  
and feelings of so respectable a Imdy of ntv ^fellow

than nryself, tlie im onvenir nees brought on our  
country in general, by the circumstances of the  
times in whirl) we happen to live; times to which  
the history of nations presents no parallel, f or  
years we have heen looking as spectators on our  
brethren of Europe, afflicted with all those evils  
which necessarily follow an abandonment of the  
inorol rules which binJ tnen and nations together.  
Conner ted witl&gt; them in friendship and eommerre,  
we have happily so tar kept aloof fruiti their cala­  
mitous conflicts, by a steady observance of justice  
towards all, by much forbearance, and multiplied  
sacrifices. At length however, all regard to the  
rights of others having been thrown aside, the ! rl­  
ligerrnt powers have beset the highway of commer­  
cial intercourse with edicts, which taken together,  
expose our commerce and mariners, under almost e­  
vrry destination, n prey to their fleets and armies.—  
Each party indeed would admit our comm roe with  
themselves, with a viewed associating os in their  
war against the other, lfut we have wished war  
with neither. Under these circumstances were pas­  
sed the laws ol which you complain, by thos&#x27; dele­  
gated to exercise the powers of legislation for vou,  
with every sympathy of a common interest in ex­  
ercising them fuithiully. In reviewing these mea­  
sures therefore we should advert to the difficulties  
out of which a choice was of necessity to be made.  
To have submitted our rightful commerce to prohi­  
bitions, and tributary exactions from others would

and our marineis to their country, has the peculiar

it is to our rights.  
“ fn the event of such peace, or suspension of  
hostilities between the belligerent powers nt Europe,  
ornt such change in their measures affecting neu­
