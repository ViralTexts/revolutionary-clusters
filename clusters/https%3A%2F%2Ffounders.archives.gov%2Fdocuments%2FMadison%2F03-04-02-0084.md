of Governor Harrison, in leading the army

1811, the venerable James Madison, then  
President of the United States, in a message

ment,  
&quot; While it is deeply lamented that so many valu­  
able lives have been lost in ihe action which took

effects of a critical dtfeai and dispersion of a com­

Congress, dated December 18, 1811: “While it  
is deeply to be lamented,” says Mr. Madison,  
‘that so many valuable lives have been lost in the  
action which took place on the 9th ult., Congress  
will see with satisfaction the dauntless spirit and  
fortitude victoriously displayed by every descrip-  
tion ‘of troops engaged, as well as the collected  
firmness which distinguished their commander, on  
an occasion requiring the utmost exertion of valor  
and discipline.”  
  
It was no mean achiovement which could extort  
from the justice of the mild and upright Madison,  
a compliment expressed in terms of such decided  
approbation.

I lay before Congress two letters received from  
Governor Harrison of the Indiana territory, re­

ken in my corr.m initiation of November 5.
