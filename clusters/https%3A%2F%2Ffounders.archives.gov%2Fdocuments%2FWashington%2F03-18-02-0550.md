Lee’s asking for a court-martial, he was arrested.  
The verdict of that body was,  
  
First. That he was guilty of disobedience of or-  
ders in not attacking the enemy on the 28th of June,  
  
reeably to repeated instructions. Second. That he’  
ag y pe  
  
was guilty of misbehavior before the enemy on the  
same day, in making an unnecessary, and, in some  
few instances, a disorderly retreat. Third. That he  
was guilty of disrespect to the commander-in-chief  
in two letters. His sentence was, to be suspended  
from his rank for one year.  
  
We shall not go into a minute examination of the  
question whether this punishment was deserved.  
Our own opinion is that it was. We do not think  
Lee guilty in the retreat of any thing but an error in  
judgment, arising perhaps from want of confidence  
in his men. But he should have kept the commander-  
in-chief advised of his movements. It is probable  
that Lee considered himself a superior officer to  
Washington, for he was overbearing, proud, sullen
