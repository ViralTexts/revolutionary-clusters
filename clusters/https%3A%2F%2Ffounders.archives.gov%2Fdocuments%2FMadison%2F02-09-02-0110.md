er 19th.  
The procrastinations of the British Ministry in meeting you effectively, on the subjects proposed in your project for a Convention, betray a repugnance to some of them, and a spirit of evasion, inauspicious to a satisfactory result. Still your conduct was prudent, in winking at this dilatory policy, and keeping the way open for a fair and friendly experiment on your return from Madrid, which it is presumed will have taken place before this will reach London. The experience of every day, shews more and more the obligation on both sides, to enter seriously on the means of guarding the harmony of the two countries against the dangers with which it is threatened by a perseverance of Great Britain in her irregularities on the high seas, and particularly in the impressments from American vessels. The extent in which these have taken place since the commencement of the War, will be seen by the inclosed report required from this Department by a vote of the House of Representatives, and the call for it whilst negotiations on the subject were understood to be in train, is itself a proof of the public sensibility to those aggressions on the security of our citizens and the rights of our flag. A further proof will be seen in the motion also inclosed, which was made by Mr Crowninshield, and which will probably be revived at the next Session. This motion with his remarks on it, appear very generally in the Newspapers with comments proceeding from a coincidence of the sensibility out of doors with that within. A still stronger proof of impatience under this evil, will be found in the proceedings authorized by an Act of Congress just passed and which is likewise inclosed, against British Officers committing on the high seas trespasses or torts on board American vessels; offences manifestly including cases of impressment.  
In communicating these circumstances it will occur to you that whilst they may be allowed to proclaim the growing sensibility of the United States on the subject of impressments, they ought, by proper explanations and assurances to be guarded against a misconstruction into marks of illiberal or hostile sentiments towards Great Britain. The truth is, and it may be so stated by you, that this practice of impressments aggravated by so many provoking incidents has been so long continued, and so often, in vain remonstrated against, that without more encouragement than yet appears, to expect speedy redress from the British Government, the United States are in a manner driven to the necessity of seeking for some remedy dependent on themselves alone. But it is no less true that they are warmly disposed to cherish all the friendly relations subsisting with Great Britain; that they wish to see that necessity banished by just and prudent arrangements between the two Governments; and that with this view you were instructed to open the negotiations which are now depending. It is impossible for the British Government to doubt the sincerity of these sentiments. The forbearance of the United States year after year, and war after war, to avail themselves of those obvious means which without violating their national obligations of any sort, would appeal in the strongest manner, to the interest of Great Britain, is of itself a sufficient demonstration of the amicable spirit which has directed their public councils. This spirit is sufficiently manifested also, by the propositions which have been lately made thro’ you, and by the patience and cordiality with which you have conducted the negotiation. I might add, as a further proof to the same effect, that notwithstanding the refusal of which we have official information, from Glasgow and Liverpool particularly, to restore american seamen deserting their ships in British ports, the laws of many of the states have been left, without interruption, to restore British deserters. One of the states, Virginia, has even at the last Session of its Legislature, passed an act for the express purpose of restoring such deserters; which deserves the more attention, as it was done in the midst of irritations resulting from the multiplied irregularities committed by British ships in the american seas.  
Mr Merry has expressed some inquietude with respect to the clause in the Act above referred to, which animadverts on British trespasses on board American vessels; and his language on several late occasions has strongly opposed the expectation that Great Britain will ever relinquish her practice of taking her own subjects out of neutral vessels. I did not conceal from him my opinion that the terms “trespass &amp;c” would be applicable to the impressment of British subjects as well as others, or that the United States would never accede to that practice. I observed to him that every preceding administration had maintained the same doctrine with the present on that point, and that such were the ideas and feelings of the nation on it, that no administration would dare so far to surrender the rights of the American flag. He expressed dissatisfaction also, at the section which requires certain compliances on the part of British ships of War entering our harbours, with arrangements to be prescribed by the Collectors. He did not deny the right of the Nation to make what rules it might please in such cases; but apprehended that some of them were such as the Commanders might deem incompatible with their just pretensions, especially when subjecting them to the discretion of so subaltern an authority as that of the Collectors; and consequently, that the law would have the unfriendly effect of excluding British ships of War altogether from american ports. He was reminded, in reply, that the Collectors were, according to the terms of the section, to be guided in the exercise of their power by the directions of the President; and it was not only to be presumed, but he might be particularly assured, that the directions given would be consistent with the usages due to public ships, and with the respect entertained for nations in amity with the United States. He asked whether in transmitting the Act to his government, as his duty would require, he might add the explanation and Assurances he had heard from me. I answered, that without having received any particular authority for that purpose from the President, I could safely undertake that what I had stated was conformable to his sentiments.  
Inclosed is another Act of Congress restraining and regulating the arming of private vessels by American Citizens. This act was occasioned by the abuse made of such armaments in forcing a trade, even in contraband of war, with the Island of St Domingo; and by the representations made on the subject of that trade by the French Chargè des Affaires and Minister here, and by the British Minister with respect to abuses which had resulted or might result from such armaments in cases injurious to Great Britain. A report of these representations as made to the President is herewith inclosed. The act, in substituting a security against the unlawful use of the armaments in place of an absolute prohibition of them, is not only consistent with the obligations of a neutral nation, but conformable to the laws  
* See Act of Parliament 35 G. 3. C. 92 S 37–8 and Valens’ Commentaries Liv 1. Tit 10 Art 1.  
and ordinances of Great Britain and France themselves, and is consequently free from objections by either. The interposition of the Government tho’ claimed in behalf both of Great Britain and of France, was most pressed in behalf of the latter. Yet the measure, particularly as it relates to the shipment of contraband Articles for the West Indies, is likely to operate much more conveniently for Great Britain than for France, who cannot like Great Britain otherwise ensure a supply of these articles for the defence of her Colonies.  
In the project which you have offered to the British Government I observe you have subjoined a clause for securing respect to certificates of citizenship. The effect of this clause, taken as it ought to be &amp; as was doubtless intended, in context with the preceding clause, is limited to the case provided for in that clause. Still it may be well in order to guard against the possibility of its being turned into a pretext for requiring such certificates in other cases, that a proviso for the purpose be added, or that words of equivalent restriction be inserted.

e subject, that you may pursue it as far as any opportunity may present itself.  
Another subject requiring your attention is pointed at by the Resolutions of the Senate moved by General Smith on the subject of a British Tax on exports under the name of a Convoy duty. A copy of the Resolution is inclosed. A duty under that name was first laid in the year 1798. It then amounted to ½ of one ⅌Cent on exports to Europe; and one ⅌Cent on exports to other places, and consequently to the United States. The discrimination being evidently contrary to the Treaty then in force, became a subject of discussion between Mr King and the British Ministry. His letters to the Secretary of State and to Lord Grenville explain the objections urged by him and the pretexts in support of the measure alleged by them. The subject was resumed in my letter of 5th March 1804 to Mr King with a copy of which you have been already furnished. It was received by Mr Gore during the absence of Mr King on the Continent, and if any occasion was found proper by either for repeating the remonstrance against the duty, it appears to have been without effect. Whilst the Treaty was in force the discrimination was unquestionably a violation of its faith. When the war ceased, it lost the pretext that it was the price of the Convoy, which giving a larger protection to the American than to the European trade, justified a higher price for the former than for the latter. Even during war the exports are generally made as American property and in American vessels, and therefore with a few exceptions only, a convoy which would subject them to condemnation, from which they would otherwise be free, would be not a benefit but an injury. Since the expiration of the Treaty, the discrimination as well as the duty itself can be combated by no other arguments than those, which in the document referred to are drawn from justice, friendship and sound policy; including the tendency of the measure to produce a discontinuance of the liberal but unavailing example given to Great Britain by the regulations of commerce on our side, and a recurrence to such counteracting measures as are probably contemplated by the mover of the Resolutions of the Senate. All these arguments gain strength in proportion to the augmentations which the evil has latterly received; it being now stated that the duty amounts to 4 ⅌ Cent on the exports to the United States. These, according to Cockes answer to Sheffield amounted in the year 1801 to about 7 ½ Millions sterling and therefore levy a tax on the United States of about 1,300,000 dollars. From this is indeed to be deducted a sum proportioned to the amount of re-exportations from the United States. But on the other hand, is to be added, the increase of the exports since the year 1801. which probably exceed the re exportations.  
With the aid of these communications and remarks, you will be at no loss for the views of the subject most proper to be presented to the British Government, in order to promote the object of the Resolutions; and the resolutions themselves ought powerfully to second your efforts, if the British Government feels the same desire as actuates the United States to confirm the friendship and Confidence on both sides, by a greater conformity on that side to the spirit of the Commercial regulations on this.  
I have referred above to the inclosed copy of the motion made by Mr Crowninshield in the House of Representatives. The part of it which has relation to the trade with the West Indies, was suggested as appears in his introductory observations by the late proclamations of the British West India Governors, excluding from that trade vessels of the United States, and certain Articles of our exportations particularly fish, even in British vessels. These regulations are to be ascribed partly to the attachment of the present administration in Great Britain to the Colonial and navigation system, partly to the interested representations of certain merchants and others residing in the British provinces on the Continent. Without entering at large into the policy on which the Colonial restrictions are founded, it may be observed that no crisis could be more ineligible for enforcing them, than the present, because at none more than the present, have the West Indies been absolutely dependent on the United States for the supplies essential to their existence. It is evident in fact that the United States by asserting the principle of a reasonable reciprocity, such as is admitted on the trade with the European ports of Great Britain, and as is admitted even in the Colonial trade of other European Nations, so far at least as respects the vessels employed in the trade, might reduce the British Government at once to the dilemma of relaxing her regulations or of sacrificing her Colonies: and with respect to the interdict of supplies from the United States of articles necessary to the subsistence and prosperity of the West Indies, in order to force the growth and prosperity of the Continental provinces of Nova Scotia &amp;c; what can be more——— unjust than thus to impoverish one part of the foreign dominions which is considered as a source of wealth and power to the parent country, not with a view to favor the parent country but to favor another part of its foreign dominions, which is rather expensive than profitable to it? What can be more preposterous than thus at the expence of Islands which not only contribute to the Revenue, commerce and navigation of the parent state, but can be secured in their dependence by that naval ascendency which they aid, to foster unproductive establishments which from local causes must eventually detach themselves from the parent state and the sooner in proportion as their growth may be stimulated.  
Considerations, such as these ought to have weight with the British Government, and may very properly enter into frank conversations with its Ministry on favorable occasions. However repugnant that Government may be to a departure from its system, in the extent contemplated by Mr Crowninshields motion, it may at least be expected that the trade as opened in former wars, will not be refused under circumstances which in the present, particularly demand it: it may be hoped that the way will be prepared for some permanent arrangement on this subject between the two nations, which will be conformable to equity, to reciprocity and to their mutual advantage. I have the honor to be &amp;c

so enclosed, which was made by Mr. Grown­  
inshield, and which will probab!; be revived  
at the next session, This motion, with his  
remarks ot; it, appear very generally ir. the  
News-Papers, with comments proceeding  
from a coincidence, of the sensibility o it of  
doors with that within. A st ill stronger proof  
of impatience under this evil, will be found  
in the proceedings authorized i&gt; an art of  
Congress just passed, and which is likewise  
inclosed, against British officers committing  
on the high seas, trespasses or torts on board  
American vessels, offences manifestly inclu­  
ding cases of impressment.  
“ In communicating these circumstances,  
it will occur to you, that whilst they m^y be  
allowed to proclaim the growing sensibility  
of the United States, on the subject of im­  
pressments, they ought, by proper explana­  
tions and assn ances, to be guarded against a  
misconstruction into marks of illiberal or hos­  
tile sentiments towards Great-Britain. The  
truth is, and it ma be so stated by you, tlrat  
this practice of impressments, aggravated by  
so many provoking incidents, has been so  
long continued, anil so ofteil in vain remon­  
strated against, that, without more encou­  
ragement than yet appears to expect speedy  
red less from the British g. vernment, th U­

necessity of seeking for some remedy depen ■

true, that they are warmly disposed to die •  
i isb all the friendly relations subsisting with  
Great-Britain ; that they wish fosec thitnc­  
ccssivv banished !&gt;. just and prudent arrange­  
ment between the two governments; and.  
that with this view, you were instructed to  
open the negotiations which are no w depen

to avail thentse. ves of those obvious means,  
which, without violating their national obli­

gest manner to the interest of Great-Britain.  
is of itself a sufficient demons ration of the  
amicable spirit which has directed their  
public councils. &#x27;1 his spirit is sufficiently  
manifested also, by the propositions which  
have been lately made through you, and by  
the patience and cordiality with which you  
have conducted the negotiation. I might add,  
as a further proof to the same e. ect, that  
notwithstanding the refusal o&#x27;- wh-ch we hav*  
official information, from Glasgow and Li­  
verpool particularly, t&#x27;#* restore American  
seamen de.-erting their ships in British ports,

deserters. One of the states, Virginia, has

attention as it w as done in the midst of irri­

section, to be guided in the exercise «f  
their power by the directions of the Presi­  
dent ; and it was not only to be presumed,  
but he might be particularly assured, that  
the directions given, would be consistent

in transmitting the act to his government, as  
his duty would require, he might add the

from me. I answered, that without having

“Inclosed is another act of Congress, res­

which had resulted or might result from such

made to the president, is herewith enclosed.  
The act, in substituting a security against

doubtless intended, in context with the prece­

Another subject requiring your attention is  
pointed at. by the resolution’s ot the senate  
moved by general Smith, on the subject of a  
British tax on exports under the name of a  
convov duty. A cvpy of the resolution is in­  
closed. A duty under that name was .rirst  
laid in the year 1798. It then amounted to  
half of one percent, on exports to Europe, and  
one per cent, on exports to other places,  
and consequently to the United Suites. The  
discrimthatinn being evidently contrary to  
ti.c treaty then m force, became a subject of  
discussion between !r. King and the British  
ministry. 11 is letters to the secretary of state  
&amp; to lord Grcn. ille, explain the objections ur­  
ged b\ him, &amp; the pretexts in support of the  
measure a.ledged by them The subject was  
result! -u in ,.v letter of jth March, 1804, to  
Mr. King, with a copy of which you have  
been already furnished. It was received bv  
Mr. Gore, during the absence o: Mr. King  
on the continent; and if any occasion was  
found proper by either .or repeating the re­  
ntorurance again t t e fluty, it appeal’s to  
have been with*x.: effect Whilst tile trea­  
ty was in force, the iiscriihination was un­  
questionably a viola ,.n of ii.s faith. When  
the war ceased, ii blit the pretext that it  
w as the price of the convoy, whichgiviiva  
longer protection to *lie American Than to  
trie European trade, ju .tified a higher price  
for the former than for the latter. Even cl a  
ring war the e\p i ts arc generally made as  
American prop* ”*.y and in American Vessels,  
and then fire with a tew exceptions only, a  
co voy which would subject them to condem­  
nation, from which they would otherwise be  
free, would not be a benefit but an injury._  
Since the expiration ot the treaty, the dis­  
crimination as well as he duty itself can Ik*  
combated by no other a gamer.-s th in those,  
which in the document referred to are dr avn  
from justice, friendship, and sound police ;  
including rite tendency of the measure u&gt; pro­  
duce u discontinuance of the liberal but una­  
vailing example given to Gveat-Britain bv  
the regulations of commerce on our side, and  
£ recurrence to such counteracting measures  
as are probably contemplated by the mover  
of the resolution of the senate. All the se  
arguments gain sir vug i in proportion to the  
  
augmemaxio:is wmcn me evil Has latterly re­  
ceived ; it being now stated that lie duty a­  
monnts to fv uv per cent, on the exports to  
the U. Sta&#x27;&#x27; *. se, according to Cocke’s  
answer to brflit d, amounted in the year  
1801, to . c .» seven and a half millions ster­  
ling, and the ctore levy a taxon the United  
States, of about 1,300,000 dollars. Fiomthis  
is indeed to be deducted a sum proportioned  
to the amount of the re-exportations from  
the U. States. But on the other hand, is to  
be added the increase of the exports since  
the year 1801, which probably exceed the  
re-exportations.  
With the aid of these communications and  
remarks, you will beat no loss for the views  
of the subject most proper to be presented  
to the British government, in order to pro  
mote the object of the resolutions ; and the  
resolutions thenselves ought powerfully to se­  
cond your efforts, if the British government  
feels the same desire as actuates the United  
States, to confirm the friendship and confi­  
dence on both sides by a greater conformity  
or that side to the spirit of the commercial  
regulations on this.  
I have referred above to the inclosed copy  
of the motion made by Mr. Crcwninshield &#x27;in  
the house of representatives. The part of it  
which ha:, ’at on to the trade wbh the VV\
Indies, was suggested, as appears in hisin­  
troductoi v observations, by the late procla­  
mations of the British West-India governors,  
excluding from that trade vessels of the LT!  
States, and certain articles of our exportati­  
ons, particularly fish, even in British vessels.  
These regulations are to be ascribed partly  
to the attachment of the present administra­  
tion in G. Britain to the colonial and naviga­  
tion svstem, partly to the interested repre­  
sentations of certain merchants and others  
residing in the British provinces on the con­  
tinent. Without entering at large into tb#­  
policy on which the colonial restrictions are  
founded, it may lie observed that no crisis  
coaid lie more ineligible for enforcing them,  
than the present, because at none more than  
the present, have the W. 1ml. been absolutely

tial to their existence. It is evident in fact,  
that the U. States by asserting the prin­  
ciple of a reasonable, reciprocity, such as is  
admitted in the trade with the European ports  
of Great-Britain, and is admitted even in the  
colonial trade of other European nations, so  
tur at least as repects the vessels employed  
in the trade might reduce the British govern­  
ment at once to the dilemma of relaxing her  
regulations or of sacrificing her colonies ; and  
with respect to the interdict of supplies from  
the United States, of articles necessary to the  
subsistence aud prosperity of the West-In­  
dies, in order to force the growth and pros­  
perity of the continental provinces of Nova­  
Scotia, See. what can be more unjust than  
thus to impoverish one part of the foreign do­  
minions, which is considered as a source of  
wealth and power to the parent country, not  
with a view to favor the parent country, but  
to favor another part of its foreign dominions  
which is rather expensive than profitable to  
it? £V\ hat can be more preposterous than  
thus, at the expense of islands which not on­  
ly contribute to the revenue, commerce and  
navigation of the parent state, but can be se­  
cured in their dependence bv that naval as­  
cendancy which they aid to foster unproduc­  
tive establishments?  
Considerations, such as these, ought to  
have weight with the British government,  
and may very properly enter into frank con­  
versations with its ministry on favorable oc­  
casions. However repugnant that govern­  
ment may be to a departure from its system,  
in the extent contemplated by Mr. Orown­  
inshield’s motion, it may at least be expect­  
ed that the trade as opened in former wars,  
will notbe refused-under circumstances which  
in the present, particularly demand it. U  
’may be hoped that the way will be prepar­  
ed for some permanent arrangement on this  
subject between the two nations, which will  
be coniormable to equity, to reciprocity, and  
to their mutual advantage.  
J have the honor to be See.

commencement of the war will he seen by the in­  
closed repoii required from this department by a  
vote of the house ol representatives, and the call lor  
it whilst negotiations on the subject were understood !  
to be in train, is itself a proof ol the putdick sensi  
hility to those aggressions on theserumy of our ci­  
tizens and the rights of our Hag. A further prom  
will be seen in the motion, also inclosed, which was  
made by Mr. Crowumslueld, and which will proba­  
bly be levived at the next session, this motion,  
with his remarks on it, appear very generally hi  
the newspapers, with rmnmfiits proceeding from a  
coincidence of the sensibility out of doors with that  
within. A still stronger proof of iippatienre under  
this evil will be found in the proceedings authorised  
by an art of congress just passed, and which is like­  
wise inclosed, against British officers committing i  
on the high seas trespasses or torts on board Ame­  
rican vessels, odenees manifestly including cases of  
impressment.  
“ In communicating these circumstances, it wHI  
occur to you that whilst they may be allowed to  
proclaim the growing sensibility of the United  
States on the subject of impressments, they ought,  
by proper explanations and assurances, to be guar­  
ded against a miscohstiuctiun into marks of illibe­  
ral or hostile sentiments to\ ards Great-Britain.—  
The truth Is, and it may be slated by you that this  
practice of impressments, aggravated by so many  
provoking incidents, has been so long Continued,  
and so in vain remonstated against that, without  
morn encouragement than yet appears to expect  
speedy redress from the British government,* the  
United States are in a tnauner driven to the necessi­  
ty of seeking for some remedy dependent on them­  
selves alone. But it is no less true that they Hre  
warmly disposed to cherish all the friendly relations  
subsisting with Great-Britain; and they wish to  
see that necessity banished by just and prudent ar­  
  
r rMgMMatf betwee* tbs twofovernigeets rand&gt;thut  
with this view you are instructed to- open the nego  
tiatioos which&#x27; are now depending. It is impossi  
&gt;de for the British government lo&#x27;doubt the sincen  
&gt;y of these sentiments, th.e forbearance of the Unit­  
ed States year after year, and war after war, to  
avail themselves of those obvious means,1 whirl,  
without violating their national obligations of any 1  
sort, would appeal in the strongest maimer to the  
interest ol Great-Britain, is of itself a sufficient de  
illustration $f tbe amicable spirit which has di­  
rected their politick councils. This spirit is suffi­  
ciently manifested also by tbe propositions which  
have been lately made through you, and by the  
patience and cordiality with which yon have Con­  
ducted the negotiation. ‘I might add as a further  
proof to the same effect, that notwithstanding the  
reiusal of which we have official information, from  
Glasgow and Liverpool particularly, to restore A­  
| uteriran seamen deserting tlivir ships in British  
ports, the laws of many ol the stales, have been left,  
without interruption, to restore British deserters.  
One ol the slates,. Virginia, has even at the last  
session ol its legislature passed ail act for the ex­  
press purpose of restoring such deserters, which  
deserves the mure attention as it was done in flu  
midst ol irritations, resulting from the multiplied ir  
regularities conwiitted by British ships in the Amt  
rican seas.  
  
“ -^r- Merry has expressed some inquietude with  
respect to the clause in the art above referred to,  
wli:cb animadverts on British trespasses on board  
American vessels—-ami his language on several late  
occasions has strongly opposed the expectation that  
Great Britain will ever relinquish her practice ol  
taking hei own subjects out of feuiral vessels, I  
did not conceal from him my opinion that the  
terms “ trespass,” Ike. would be applicable to the  
impressment of British subjects as well as others,  
or that the United States would never accede to  
that practtre. I observed to him that every pre­  
ceding administration had maintained the same doc­  
trine with the present cm that point, and that such  
w-re the ideas and feelings of the nation on it, (hat  
no administration would dare so far to sue render the  
rights 01 the American flag, lie expresses dissa­  
tislartion also at the sectfon which requires certain !  
compliances on the part ot British ships ol war j  
entering our harming with arranaements to. be  
pi escribed by the roll, rtors. He did not deny the  
r ght id the nation to make what roles it might please  
in such cases, nut appii bended that some of them  
were such as the coni,H inders might deem incom­  
patible with then just pretensions, especially when  
subjecting them to the discretion ol $&lt;&gt; subaltern an  
auiliorily as that or tee collectors, and consequently  
tliai iliebt a -.mild have the unlnendly effect ol ex­  
cluding Br tiaii ships of war aftogether from Aine­  
r:e.,n pous. He wis remmdtd in reply that the  
Collectors acre lo b»guioed in the exercise of their  
power i,y the d re nous ol the president; mtd it  
was urn only in op presumed, but he might be parli­  
ru! nay assured, that the daemons given would he  
consistent w.tli the 11 age due to publicly ships, and  
with the nspect (iiiercaimd lor nations at amity  
with the United States, tie asked whether in trans  
muting the act to his government, as Ins duty  
would require, he might add the explanation and  
assurances he had heard Irotu me. I answered, that  
without having received any particular authority  
lor that purpose from the president, i could safely  
undertake that what 1 had stated was conformable  
to his semiments.  
Inclosed is another act of congress, restraining  
and regulating the arming of private vessels by A­  
menraii ciiizeus, ibis act was occasioned by the  
abuse made nt such auuaments in turcing a trade,  
even in contraband «f war, will, the island «{ Si.

against the possibility of us being turned into a

Another subject requiring your attention is point­  
ed at by the resolutions ot the senate, moved by  
gen. Smith, on the subject oi a British tax on ex­  
ports, under the name oi a convoy duty. A ropy  
ul the if solution is inclosed. A duty under that  
name was first laid in the year 17y». It then a­  
mounled to hall oi one per cent, on expmts to Ku­  
rope, and one per cent, on expmts to other places,

tween Mr. King and the British ministry. His let­  
ters to the secretary of state and to hud Grenville,  
explain the objections urged by him, and the pre­  
texts in support of Ihemeasureaifedgedby them. The  
subject was resumed in my letter ot 5ih Marc#  
1804, to Mr. King, with a copy of which you have  
been already furnished. It was received by Mr.  
Gore, during the absence of Mr. King on the con­  
tinent&#x27;; and if any occasion was found proper by  
either tor repeating the remonstrance agaiust the  
duty, it appears to have been without effect.—

All these arguments gain strength in proportion us  
the augmentations which the evil has Ultfriy ru. f  
cetved; it being now stated that the duty amount*  
to four per rent, ore the exports to the United Stales.  
These, accord.ng to Corks’* answei to Sheffield, a*  
minuted in the year 1801, to about seven aqd an 3  
hall millions sterling, nod therefore levy a tax on.  
the United Slates* of about 1,300.000 dollars.—•  
l i&#x27;oin this is indeed to be deducted a sum proportion*

&#x27;d Stales. Hut uni the otfier Hand is to be added  
the increase oi the exports since the vear 1801.

to the spirit ol the commercial regulations on this*  
I have referred above to the inclosed copy-of thw  
motion&#x27; made t&gt;y Mr. Crowningshield in* the boasts  
ot lepreseiu. lives. The part of it which has rein*  
turn to the trade with the West Indies, was sug—  
gested, as appears in his introductory observations* ’  
by the late proclamations of the British West In­  
dia governours, excluding from that tracts vessels  
ol the United Stales, and Certain- articles of our  
exportations, particularly fish, even in British ves­  
sels. 1 hese regulations are to be ascribed, partly  
to the attachment ot the preset adm nisiration of  
Great Britain to the colonial and navigation sys­  
tem, partly to the interested represent Hums of cer­  
tain merchants and others reefing iff the Bntislfc  
provinces on the com met. Without entering aft  
large into the pnltcv on which the colonial&#x27;ie«ine­

ly, such as is admitted in the trade with the Euro* M  
pean ports of Great Britain, and as is admitted its,  
the colonial trade of other European nations, stir  
far at least as respects the vessels employed in Ike  
trade, might reduce the British government at onen  
to the dilemma of relaxing her regulations or of sa­  
crificing her utlonies f and with respect to the in­  
terdict ol supplies from the United States, of arti­  
cles necessary to- the subsistence and prosperity of  
the W est Indies, in order to force the growth and  
prosperity of the continental provinces of Nova*  
Sroti.i, At*. what can be more unjust than thus tn  
impoverish ode part of the foreign dominions*  
which is considered as a source of wealth and pow- -  
er to the parent country, not with a view to favour  
the parent country, bat to favour another part of

than thus, at the expence of islands which not only  
contribute to the revenue, commerce and navigation  
of the present state, but fan be secured in their de­

instructions from Mr. Madison to Mr. Monroe, when the  
Jatter was ambassador at our court, dated 6th March 1805.  
  
“‘ The truth is,”’ says Mr. Madison, ‘ and it may be so stated by  
You, that this practice of impressments, aggravated by so many pro-  
voking incidents, has been so long continued, and so often in vain re-  
monstrated against, that, without more encouragement than yet ap-  
— to expect speedy redress from the British government, the

some remedy dependent on themselves alone. But it is no less true  
that they are warmly disposed to cherish all the friendly relations  
subsisting with Great Britain ; that they wish to see that necessity  
banished by just and prudent arrangements between the two govern-.  
ments ; and that, with this view, you were instructed to open the  
negotiations which are now depending. It is impossible for the  
British government to doubt the sincerity of these sentiments. The  
forbearance of the United States, year after year, and war after war,  
to avail themselves of those obvious means, which, without violating  
their national obligations of any sort, would appeal in the strongest  
manner to the interest of Great Britain, is of itself a sufficient demon-  
stration of the amicable spirit which has directed their public coun-  
cils. This spirit is sufficiently manifested also, by the propositions  
which have been lately made through you, and by the patience and  
cordiality with which you have conducted the negotiation. I might  
add, as a farther canal to the same effect, that notwithstanding the  
refusal, of which we have official information from Glasgow and  
Liverpool, particularly, to restore American seamen deserting their  
ships in British ports, the laws of many of the states have been left,  
without interruption, to restore British deserters. One of the states,  
Virginia, has even at the last session of its legislature passed an act  
for the express purpose of restoring such deserters ; which deserves  
the more attention, as it was done in the midst of irritations, result-  
ing from the multiplied irregularities committed by British ships in  
the American seas.”

Mr. Madison has long been content to be passive. Neither he nor any  
of his predecessors have ever been content to be passive on the subject  
for one moment. Thisis proved by the whole scope of the diplomatic  
correspondence ; but, in the disposition (to use the words of Mr. Ma-  
dison,) “to cherish all the friendly relations subsisting with Great Bri-  
tain, they have wished to see the necessity for seeking a remedy, de-  
pendent on themselves alone, banished by just and prudent arrange-  
ments between the two Governments;” and it is at a moment when

“The procrastinations of the British Minis­  
try in meeting you effectually on the subjects  
proposed in your project for a Convention, be­  
tray a repugnance to some of them, and a spi­  
rit of evasion inauspicious to a satisfactory re­  
sult. Still your conduct was prudent in wink­  
ing at this dilatory policy, and keeping the way  
open for a fair and friendly experiment, on your  
return from Madrid, which it is presumed,  
&#x27;t ill have taken place before this will reach  
London. The experience of every day, shews  
more and more, the obligation on both sides, to  
enter seriously, on the means of guarding the  
harmony of the two countries against the dan­  
gers with which it is threatened by a persever­  
ance of Great Britain in her irregularities on  
the high seas, and particularly in the impress­  
ment from American vessels.”  
The remainder of this letter is occupied  
with instructions on various topics connected  
with the general object suggested in the close  
of the foregoing extract, and which seem, evi­
