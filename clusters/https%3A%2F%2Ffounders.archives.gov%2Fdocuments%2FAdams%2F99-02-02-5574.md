.  
The character with which you are invested, sir, your wisdom and the confidence which I place in your principles and in your sentiments, engage me to communicate to you, the correspondence which I have had with Mr. Adams. You will find, I think, in the letters of this plenipotentiary, opinions, and a turn which corresponds neither with the manner with which I have explained myself to him, nor with the intimate connection which subsists between the King and the United States. You will make of all these pieces the use which your prudence will suggest to you. As to myself I desire that you would transmit them to congress, to the end that they may know the conduct which Mr. Adams holds towards us, and that they may judge, whether he is endowed, as much as the congress no doubt desires, with that spirit of conciliation which is suitable with a business so important and so delicate as that, which is confided to him.  
I have the honor to be, most sincerely sir, your most humble and most obedient servant,  
De Vergennes

I thought the statesmen in France ought to have more generous views and to be wiser politicians than such symptoms indicated. That they ought to know better the people they had to deal with. That they ought to avoid every thing that could excite jealousies in America, lessen the gratitude of our citizens and weaken or destroy their confidence in France. These sentiments I always expressed freely to Dr. Franklin, and it is for want of attention to these sentiments that we have been more than once in danger of a war with France, as we have been very lately if we are not at this moment. Though a war with France may become inevitable as it has been partially, in 1798, I own I know of no greater error that France can commit, than to force us into a war with her, nor any greater calamity that America can suffer, than to be forced into war with France and an alliance offensive &amp; defensive with Great Britain. This opinion and this sentiment determined me to embrace the first opportunity that presented in 1798, 1799 and 1800, consistent with the honor of the nation, to make peace with France. I should not have thought this of so much importance at that time, if I had not been apprehensive that the BRITISH PARTY would force us into an alliance with G. Britain, our perpetual rival in commerce and manufactures all over the globe, and the natural as well as habitual enemy of the United States, especially of New-England.

ation, and many limitations.  
To all those talents and qualities for the foundation of a great and lasting character, which were held up to the view of the whole world, by the University of Oxford, the Royal Society of London, and the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris; were added, it is believed, more artificial modes of diffusing, celebrating and exaggerating his reputation, than were ever before or since practised in favor of any individual.  
  
  
His reputation was more universal than that of Leibnits or Newton, Frederick or Voltaire; and his character more beloved and esteemed than any or all of them.  
Newton had astonished, perhaps forty or fifty men in Europe, for not more than that number probably at any one time had read him and understood him, by his discoveries and demonstrations; and these being held in admiration in their respective countries as at the head of the philosophers, had spread among scientific people a mysterious wonder at the genius of this perhaps the greatest man that ever lived. But this fame was confined to men of letters. The common people knew little and cared nothing about such a recluse philosopher. Leibnits’ name was more confined still. Frederick was hated by more than half of Europe as much as Louis the 14th was, and as Napoleon is. Voltaire, whose name was more universal than any of those beforementioned, was considered as a vain, profligate wit, and not much esteemed or beloved by any body, though admired by all who knew his works.  
But Franklin’s fame was universal. His name was familiar to government and people, to kings, courtiers, nobility, clergy and philosophers, as well as plebeians, to such a degree, that there was scarcely a peasant or a citizen, a valet de chambre, coachman or footman, a lady’s chamber maid or a scullion in a kitchen, who was not familiar with his name, and who did not consider him as a friend to human kind. When they spoke of him, they seemed to think he was to restore the golden age. They seemed enraptured enough to exclaim—  
Aspice venturo lætentur ut omnia seculo.  
To develope that complication of causes, which conspired to produce so singular a phenomenon, is far beyond my means or forces.—Perhaps it can never be done, without a complete history of the philosophy and politics of the eighteenth century. Such a work would be one of the most important that ever was written; much more interesting to this and future ages, than the decline and fall of the Roman empire, splendid and useful as that is. La Harpe promised a history of the philosophy of the eighteenth century; but he died, and left us only a few fragments. Without going back to Lord Herbert, to Hobbes, to Mandeville, or to an host of more obscure infidels, both in England, France, and Germany, it is enough to say, that four of the finest writers that Great Britain ever produced, Shaftsbury, Bolingbroke, Hume and Gibbon, whose labors were translated into all languages; and three of the most eloquent writers that ever lived in France, whose works were also translated into all languages, Voltaire, Rousseau and Raynal,

ese, and many more were professed admirers of Mr. Franklin. He was considered as a citizen of the world, a friend to all men and an enemy to none. His rigorous taciturnity was very favorable to this singular felicity. He conversed only with individuals, and freely only with confidential friends. In company he was totally silent.

When the association of encyclopedists was formed, Mr. Franklin was considered as a friend and zealous promoter of that great enterprise, which engaged all their praises—When the society of economists was commencing, he became one of them, and was solemnly ordained a knight of the order, by the laying on the hands of Dr. Quenay, the father and founder of that sect. This effectually secured the affections and the panegyrics of that numerous society of men of letters. He had been educated a printer, and had practised his art in Boston, Philadelphia and London for many years, where he not only learned the full power of the press, to exalt and to spread a man’s fame, but acquired the intimacy and the correspondence of many men of that profession, with all their editors and many of their correspondents. This whole tribe became enamoured and proud of Mr. Franklin as a member of their body, and were consequently always ready and eager to publish and embellish any panegyric upon him that they could procure. Throughout his whole life he courted and was courted by the printers, editors and correspondents of reviews, magazines, journals and pamphleteers, and those little busy meddling scribblers that are always buzzing about the press in America, England, France and Holland. These, together with some of the clerks in the compte de Vergennes’ office of interpreters, (bureau des interpretes) filled all the Gazettes of Europe with incessant praises of Monsieur Franklin. If a collection could be made of all the Gazettes of Europe for the latter half of the eighteenth century, a greater number of panegyrical paragraphs upon “Le Grand Franklin,” would appear, it is believed, than upon any other man that ever lived.  
  
  
While he had the singular felicity to enjoy the entire esteem &amp; affection of all the philosophers, every denomination, he was not less regarded by all the sects and denominations of christians; the catholics thought him almost a catholic; the church of England claimed him as one of them; the presbyterians thought him half a presbyterian, and the friends believed him a wet quaker. The dissenting clergymen in England and America were among the most distinguished asserters and propagators of his renown. Indeed all sects considered him, and I believe justly, a friend to unlimited toleration in matters of religion.  
  
  
Nothing, perhaps, that ever occurred upon this earth was so well calculated to give any man an extensive and universal celebrity as the discovery of the efficacy of iron points and the invention of lightning rods. The idea was one of the most sublime that ever entered a human imagination, that a mortal should disarm the clouds of Heaven &amp; almost “snatch from his hand the sceptre and the rod.” The antients would have enrolled him with Bacchus and Ceres, Hercules and Minerva. His Paratonneres, erected their heads in all parts of the world on temples and pallaces no less than on cottages of peasants and the habitations of ordinary citizens. These visible objects reminded all men of the name and character of their inventor: and, in the course of time have not only tranquilized the minds, and dissipated the fears of the tender sex and their timorous children; but have almost annihilated that panic terror and superstitious horror which was once almost universal in violent storms of thunder and lightning. To condense all the rays of this glory to a focus, to sum it up in a single line, to impress it on every mind, and transmit it to all posterity, a motto was devised for his picture, and soon became familiar to the memory of every school boy who understood a word of latin.

ity. He was considered to be in his heart no friend to kings, nobles or prelates. He was thought a profound legislator and a friend of democracy. He was thought to be the magician who had excited the ignorant Americans to resistance. His mysterious wand had separated the colonies from Great Britain. He had framed and established all the American constitutions of government; especially all the best of them, i. e. the most democratical. His plans and his example were to abolish monarchy, aristocracy and hierarchy, throughout the world. Such opinions as these were entertained by the Duke de Rochefoucault, Mr. Turgot, Mr. Condorcet, and a thousand other men of learning and eminence, in France, England, Holland, and all the rest of Europe.

the first philosopher. Although I am not ignorant that the most of his positions and hypotheses have been controverted, I cannot but think he has added much to the mass of natural knowledge, and contributed largely to the progress of the human mind, both by his own writings and by the controversies and experiments he has excited in all parts of Europe. He had abilities for investigating statistical questions, and in some parts of his life has written pamphlets and essays upon public topics, with great ingenuity and success—but after my acquaintance with him, which commenced in congress in 1775, his excellence as a legislator, a politician or a negociator, most certainly never appeared. No sentiment more weak and superficial was ever avowed by the most absurd philosopher, than some of his, particularly one that he procured to be inserted in the first constitution of Pennsylvania, and for which he had such a fondness as to insert it in his will.

&#x27;* When the affociation of encvilopsedifts  
was formed, &#x27;r. Franklin was coiifidercd  
as a friend and zealous promoter of that  
gieat eiuerprizc. wh ch engegejJ all their  
• raise&#x27;. V l ei) the fnciety ol vco&#x27;iomifts  
was coinmeiiting, he became one of them,  
and was solemnly ordained a knight of the  
Older, by the ayiiig on the hands of Dr.  
Quenay, thv lather and foun ier of that  
feet. This effectually fecur. d the affect-  
ions and the panegyrics of that numerous  
foiiety of men of letters. He had leen  
tducaiea a printer, and had practifed his  
  
art in Biiftcn. Philadelphia and London  
for many ye.irs. where he not only learned  
the fill) power of the prefs to exalt and  
spread a man’s fame, but acquired an  
intiinaty and correspondence of miiiy  
men of that prcfefiioii. with ail theii edi-  
tors and many of their corrcf.ioaidents.  
  
&#x27;1 his whole ti ibe bceanie enamoured and  
proud of Mr Franklin as a meinbei ot  
their body and were consequcntiy always  
ready anti eager to publish any panegyric  
upon him th-it they could procure.  
Throughout his whole life he courted and  
was courted by the printers, e &#x27;.»,ons and  
correspondents of review.&#x27;, magazines,  
journals and pamphlet ers, and these lit-  
tle bust mccHing scribblers that are always  
buzzing abcut the prtfs in America, Eng-  
land, France and Holland. These, togeth-  
er with I&#x27;omc of tlie clerks in the compte  
dr V- rgennes’ office of imerpteters, (b&#x27;J  
rc*\i dcs interpreics) filled all the gazettes  
in Kurope with inreffant praises of mi-n-  
lieu; Trankliii. If a collection could he  
made of all the gazettes of Europe for the  
I ittcr half of the 1 7th century, a greater  
number of panegyrical paragraphs upon  
&quot; Lc Grand F^oiklin,” would appear, it  
is believed, than Ujion any other man that  
ever laved.  
  
•&#x27; While he had the fingular felicity  
to enjoy the entire eft&#x27;em and aft&#x27;cctioii  
of all the philosopliers &quot;f every denomina-  
tion, he was not lefs regarded by all the sects  
tcdenomiiiationsofchrifti fns ; the catholics  
thought him almoft a catholic ; the church  
of Kiigland claim him as one of them;  
t&#x27;.c presb.i tei i.ir.s thought him Haifa pres  
byterun and the friends lelieve him to  
be a wet qiiaker. The diffrni ing clergj^  
men in F.ii. land and A mcrica were among  
ihe moft diftinguishtd afi’ertors and prop  
agators of his renown. Iin&#x27;erd all fects  
confidertd him and I believe juftly, a  
Tiend to unlimited toleration ‘ No

this earth was so well calculated to give  
any man an extenfive and uni e fil Ic.cb

&quot;Franklin&#x27;s rcmitation was more universal  
than that of Leibnitz or Newton, Frederick or  
Voltaire, and his character more beloved and es­  
teemed than any or all of them. His  
name was familiar to Government and people,  
to kiugs, courtiers, nobility, clergy and philoa-  
opiiers, as well as plebeian.-., to micu a ugree

lady&#x27;s chamfK-rinaid or a scullion in tho kitchen,  
who was not familiar with it, aud who did not  
consider bim a friend to human kind. When  
they spoke of him, they seemed to think he was  
to restore tho golden age. If a collec­

greater iium!er of panegyrical paragraphs upon  
U grand FraaUiu would appear, it is uelieed,
