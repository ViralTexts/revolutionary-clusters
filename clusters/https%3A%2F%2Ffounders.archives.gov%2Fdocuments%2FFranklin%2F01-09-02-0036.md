Dear Sir,  
May 12, 1760.  
  
Agreeable to your request, I send you my reasons for thinking that our North-East storms in North-America begin first, in point of time, in the South-West parts: That is to say, the air in Georgia, the farthest of our colonies to the South-West, begins to move South-Westerly before the air of Carolina, which is the next colony North-Eastward; the air of Carolina has the same motion before the air of Virginia, which lies still more North-Eastward; and so on North-Easterly through Pensylvania, New-York, New-England, &amp;c. quite to Newfoundland.  
These North-East storms are generally very violent, continue sometimes two or three days, and often do considerable damage in the harbours along the coast. They are attended with thick clouds and rain.  
What first gave me this idea, was the following circumstance. About twenty years ago, a few more or less, I cannot from my memory be certain, we were to have an eclipse of the moon at Philadelphia, on a Friday evening, about nine o’clock. I intended to observe it, but was prevented by a North-East storm, which came on about seven, with thick clouds as usual, that quite obscured the whole hemisphere. Yet when the post brought us the Boston news-paper, giving an account of the effects of the same storm in those parts, I found the beginning of the eclipse had been well observed there, though Boston lies N. E. of Philadelphia about 400 miles. This puzzled me, because the storm began with us so soon as to prevent any observation, and being a N. E. storm, I imagined it must have began rather sooner in places farther to the North Eastward, than it did at Philadelphia. I therefore mentioned it in a letter to my brother who lived at Boston; and he informed me the storm did not begin with them till near eleven o’clock, so that they had a good observation of the eclipse: And upon comparing all the other accounts I received from the several colonies, of the time of beginning of the same storm, and since that of other storms of the same kind, I found the beginning to be always later the farther North-Eastward. I have not my notes with me here in England, and cannot, from memory, say the proportion of time to distance, but I think it is about an hour to every hundred miles.  
From thence I formed an idea of the cause of these storms, which I would explain by a familiar instance or two. Suppose a long canal of water stopp’d at the end by a gate. The water is quite at rest till the gate is open, then it begins to move out through the gate; the water next the gate is first in motion, and moves towards the gate; the water next to that first water moves next, and so on successively, till the water at the head of the canal is in motion, which is last of all. In this case all the water moves indeed towards the gate, but the successive times of beginning motion are the contrary way, viz. from the gate backwards to the head of the canal. Again, suppose the air in a chamber at rest, no current through the room till you make a fire in the chimney. Immediately the air in the chimney being rarefied by the fire, rises; the air next the chimney flows in to supply its place, moving towards the chimney; and, in consequence, the rest of the air successively, quite back to the door. Thus to produce our North-East storms, I suppose some great heat and rarefaction of the air in or about the Gulph of Mexico; the air thence rising has its place supplied by the next more northern, cooler, and therefore denser and heavier, air; that, being in motion, is followed by the next more northern air, &amp;c. &amp;c. in a successive current, to which current our coast and inland ridge of mountains give the direction of North-East, as they lie N. E. and S.W.  
This I offer only as an hypothesis to account for this particular fact; and, perhaps, on farther examination, a better and truer may be found. I do not suppose all storms generated in the same manner. Our North-West thundergusts in America I know are not; but of them I have written my opinion fully in a paper which you have seen. I am, &amp;c.

Dear Siz, May 12, 1760.  
  
GREEABLE to your requeft,  
  
A I fend you my reafons for  
  
thinking that our north-eaft ftorms  
  
in NorthAmerica begin firft,in point  
of time, in the fouth-weft parts;  
  
That is to fay, the air in Georgia, the  
  
fartheft of our colonies to the fouth-  
  
weft, begins to move fouth-wefterly  
before the air of Carolina, which is  
the next colony north-eaftward ; the  
air of Carolina has the fame motion  
before the air of Virginia,which lies  
ftill mare north-eaitward ; and fo on  
north-eafterly through Pennfylva-  
  
nia, New-York, New-England, &amp;c.  
  
quite to Newfoundland.  
  
Thefe north-eaft ftorms are gene-  
rally very violent, continue fome-  
times two or three days, and often  
do confiderable damage in the har-  
bours along the coaft. They are at-  
tended with thick clouds and rain.  
  
What firft gave me this idea, was  
the following circumftance. About  
twenty years ago, a few moreor lefs,  
I cannot from my memory be cer-  
tain, we were to have an eclipfe of  
the moon at Philadelphia, on a Fri-  
day evening, about nine o’clock. I  
intended to obferve it, bat was pré-  
vented by a north-eaft ftorm, which  
came on about feven, with thick  
clouds as ufual, that quite obfcured  
the whole hemifptere. Yet when the  
polt brought us the Boftcn news pa-

per, giving an ‘account of the effects  
of the fame ftorm in thofe parts, |  
found the beginning of the eclipfe had  
been well obferved there, though Bof-  
ton lies N. E. of Philadelphia about  
400 miles. This puzzled me, be-  
caufe the florm began with us fo foon  
as to prevent any obfervation, and be-  
ing a N.E. ftorm, I imagined it muft  
have begun rather fooner in places  
farther to the north-eaftward than it  
did at Philadelphia. I therefore mén-  
tioned it ina letter to my brother,who  
lived at Bolton; and he informed me  
the ftorm did not begin with them  
till near eleven o’clock, fo that they  
had a good obfervation of the eclipfe:  
and upon comparing all the other ac-  
counts I received from the feveral co-  
lonies, of the time of the beginning  
of the fame ftorm, and fince that of  
other ftorms of the fame kind, | found  
the beginning to be always later the  
farther north-eaftward. I have not  
my notes with me here in England,  
and cannot, from memory, fay the  
proportion of time to diftance, but  
I think it is about an hour to every  
hundred miles.  
  
From thence I formed an idea of  
the caufe of thefe ftorms, which I  
would explain by a familiar inftance  
or ole. Dept a long canal of wa-  
ter topped at the end by a gate. The  
water is quite at reft till the gate is  
open; then it begins to move out  
through the gate; the water next the  
gate is firft in motion, and moves  
towards the gate; the water next to  
that firft water moves next, and fo on  
  
éfucceffively, till the water at the head  
of the canal is in motion, which is  
laft of all. In this cafe all the water  
moves indeed towards the gate, but  
the fucceflive times of beginning mo-  
tion are the contrary way, viz. from  
the gate backwards to the head of the  
canal. Again, fupoofe the air in a  
chamber at reft, no current through  
the room till you mtke a fire in the  
chimney. Immediately the air in the  
chimney being rarefied by the fire,  
  
7  
  
rifes; the air next the chimney flows  
in to Supply its place, moving towards  
the chimney; and, in confequence,  
the reft of the air fucceflively, ‘quite  
back to the door. Thus to produce  
our north-eaft ftorms, I fuppofe fome  
great heat and rarefaction of the air  
in or about the guiph of Mexico;  
the air thence rifing, has its place  
fupplied by the next more nor-  
thern, cooler, and therefore denier  
and heavier, air; that, being in mo-  
tion, is followed by the next more  
northern air, &amp;c. &amp;c. in a fucceflive  
current, to which current our coaft  
and inland ridge of mountains give  
the dire€tion of north-eaft, as they  
lie N. E. and S,. W.  
  
This I offer only as an hypothefis  
to account for this particuiar faét ;  
and perhaps, on farther examination,  
a better and truer may be found. I  
do not fuppofe all ttorms generated  
in the fame manner. Our north-

oR. FRANKLIN’S THEORY OF NORTH-  
EAST STORMS.  
  
Dr Franklin had hoped to observe an eclipse of  
the moon at Philadelphia, but was prevented by a  
north east storm that commenced at seven in the  
evening. This he afterwards found did not occur  
zt Boston till eleven, and upon enquiry, he had  
reason to suppose, it passed to the north east at  
the rate of about 100 miles an four. The manner  
in which he accounted for the current of uair’s  
commencing at the point of compass opposite to  
ihat from which it appeared to proceed, was as  
follows :  
  
“] suppose a long canal of water, stopped at  
the end bya gate. The water is at rest till the  
  
gate is opened ; then it begins to move out thro’,  
  
the gate; and the water next the gate is put in  
motion and moves towards the gate and so on suc-  
cessively, till the water at the head of the canal  
is in motion, which is last of all. In this case all  
the water moves indeed towards the gate; but the  
successive times of beginning the motion are in  
the contrary way, viz. from the gate back to the  
head of the canal. Thus to produce a north east  
storm, I suppose some great rarefaction of the air  
nor near the Gulph of Mexico; the air rising  
thence has its place supplied by the next more  
nortuern, cooler, and therefore denser and heavier  
air; a successive current is formed, to which our  
‘oast and inland give a north east direction.”

&quot; #* Agreeable to your request, I send you my reasons for thinking  
that our north-east storms in North America, begin first, in point of  
time, in the south-west parts: that is to say, the air in Georgia, the  
farthest of our colonies to the south-west, begins to move south-west-  
erly before the air of Carolina, which is the next colony north-east-  
ward; the air of Carolina has the same motion before the air of Vir-  
ginia, which lies still more north-eastward; and so on north-easterly  
through Pennsylvania, New York, New England, &amp;c. quite to New-  
foundland.”  
  
‘¢ These north-east storms are generally very violent, continue  
sometimes two or three days, and often do considerable damage in  
the harbours along the coast. They are attended with thick clouds  
and rain,”  
  
‘* What first gave me this idea was the following circumstance.  
About twenty years ago, a few more or less, I cannot from my me-  
mory be certain, we were to have an eclipse of the moon at Philadel-  
phia, on a Friday evening, about nine o’clock. I intended to observe  
it, but was prevented by a north-east storm, which came on about  
seven, with thick clouds as usual, that quite obscured the whole hem-  
isphere. Yet when the post brought us the Boston newspaper, giv-  
ing an account of the effect of the same storm in those parts, I found  
the beginning of the eclipse had been well observed there, though Bos-  
ton lies north-east of Philadelphia about 400 miles. This puzzled  
me, because the storm began with us so soon as to prevent any ob-  
servation, and being a north-east storm, I imagined it must have be-  
gun rather sooner in places farther to the north-east than it did at  
Philadelphia. 1 therefore mentioned it in a letter to my brother who  
lived at Boston, and he informed me the storm did not begin with  
them till near eleven o’clock, so that they had a good observation of  
the eclipse: and-when comparing all other accounts I received from  
the several colonies, of the time of beginning of the same storm, and  
since that of other storms of the same kind, [ found the beginning to  
be always later the farther north-eastward. Ihave not my notes with  
me here in‘England, and cannot, from memory, say the proportion of  
= to distance, but I think it is about an hour to every hundred  
miles,”  
  
A tenacious memory for facts enabled Dr. Franklin thus to state  
the circumstances which had led to his observation, although the date  
of the year when it was made had escaped his recollection. Of the  
points to which he refers for fixing the date of his observation, the  
first seems least to be relied on, namely, that it was about twenty  
years before the date of his letter, that is, about the year 1740, this  
being the one in relation to which he expresses no confidence. The  
others are precise; there was to have been an eclipse of the moon o
