			 willing to lay the yoke of their own opinions on the necks of others;  
			 to extend the coercions of municipal law to the dogmas of their religion, by declaring that these make a part of the law of the land.  
			 in the Year Book 34. H. 6. fo. 38. in Quare impedit, where the question was how far the Common law takes notice of the Ecclesiastical law,  
			 Prisot, Chief Justice, in the course of his argument says ‘a tiels leis que ils de Seint eglise ont en ancien scripture, covient a nous a donner credence; car ces Common ley sur quels touts manners leis sont fondes: et auxy, Sir, nous sumus obliges de conustre lour ley de saint eglise Etc.’

			 3. Keb. 607. and declares that ‘Christianity is parcel of the laws of England.’ citing nobody, and resting it, with his  
			 judgment against the witches, ow on his own authority, which indeed was sound and good in all cases into which no superstition or bigotry could enter.  
			 thus strengthened, the court in 1728 in the King v. Woolston, would not  
			 suffer it to be questioned whether to write against Christianity was punishable at Common law, saying it had been so settled by Hale in Taylor’s case. 2. Stra. 834.  
			 Wood therefore, 409. without  
			 scruple, lays down as a principle that all blasphemy and profaneness are offences at the Common law, and cites  
			 Strange.  
			 Blackstone, in 1763. repeats in the words of Sr Matthew Hale that ‘Christianity is part of the laws of England,’ citing  
			 Ventris and  
			 Strange ubi supra.  
			 and Ld Mansfield in the case of the Chamberlain of London v. Evans, in 1767. qualifying somewhat the position, says that ‘the essential principles of revealed religion are part of the Common law.’  
			 thus we find this string of authorities all hanging by one another on a single hook, a mistranslation by Finch of the words of Prisot, or on nothing. for all quote Prisot, or one another, or nobody.  
			 thus Finch misquotes Prisot; Wingate also, but using Finch’s words; Sheppard quotes Prisot, Finch and Wingate; Hale cites nobody; the court in Woolston’s case cite Hale; Wood cites Woolston’s case;
