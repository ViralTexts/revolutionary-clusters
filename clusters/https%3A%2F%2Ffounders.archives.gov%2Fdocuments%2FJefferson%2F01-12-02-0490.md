Just before I received your favour asking my opinion on our new proposed constitution, I had written my sentiments on the subject fully to my friend Mr. Madison. They concurred so exactly with yours that the communication of them could answer no end but that of shewing my readiness to obey you. I therefore extracted that  part from my letter to him, and have reserved it for a good private conveiance which has never offered till now by Mr. Parker. Tho I pretend to make no mystery of my opinion, yet my distance from the scene gives me too much diffidence in my views of it to detail them lengthily and publicly. This diffidence is increased by my high opinion of the abilities and honesty of the framers of the constitution. Yet we cannot help thinking for ourselves. I suppose I see much precious improvement in it, but some seeds of danger which might have been kept out of sight of the framers by a consciousness of their own honesty, and a presumption that all succeeding rulers would be as honest as themselves. Make what use you please of the contents of the paper, but without quoting it’s author, who has no pretension to see what is hidden from others. I have the honour to be with great esteem &amp; respect Dr. Sir Your most obedt. humble servt,

Enclosure  
’I like much the general idea of framing a government, which should go on of itself peaceably, without needing continual recurrence to the state legislatures. I like the organization of the government into Legislative, Judiciary, and Executive. I like the power given the Legislature to levy taxes, and, for that reason solely, I approve of the greater house being chosen by the people directly. For though I think a house so chosen, will be very far inferior to the present Congress, will be very illy qualified to legislate for the Union, for foreign nations &amp;c. yet this evil does not weigh against the good of preserving inviolate the fundamental principle that the people are not to be taxed but by representatives chosen immediately by themselves. I am captivated by the compromise of the opposite claims of the great and little states, of the latter to equal, and the former to proportional influence. I am much pleased too with the substitution of the method of voting by persons, instead of that of voting by states: and I like the negative given to the Executive conjointly with a third of either house; though I should have liked it better had the Judiciary been associated for that purpose, or invested separately with a similar power. There are other good things of less moment. I will now tell you what I do not like.—First, the Omission of a Bill of rights, providing clearly, and without the aid of sophisms, for freedom of religion, freedom of the press, protection against standing armies, restriction of monopolies, the eternal and unremitting force of the habeas corpus laws, and trials by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws of the land, and not by the law of Nations. To say, as Mr. Wilson does, that a bill of rights was not necessary, because all is reserved in the case of the general government which is not given, while in the particular ones all is given which is not reserved, might do for the audience to which it was addressed: but it is surely a gratis dictum, the reverse of which might just as well be said; and it is  opposed by strong inferences from the body of the instrument, as well as from the omission of the clause of our present confederation which had made the reservation in express terms. It was hard to conclude because there has been a want of uniformity among the states as to the cases triable by jury, because some have been so incautious as to dispense with this mode of trial in certain cases, therefore the more prudent states shall be reduced to the same level of calamity. It would have been much more just and wise to have concluded the other way, that as most of the states had preserved with jealousy this sacred palladium of liberty, those who had wandered should be brought back to it: and to have established general right rather than general wrong, for I consider all the ill as established, which may be established. I have a right to nothing which another has a right to take away; and Congress will have a right to take away trials by jury in all civil cases. Let me add that a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular; and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inferences.  
The second feature I dislike, and strongly dislike, is the abandonment in every instance of the principle of rotation in office, and most particularly in the case of the President. Reason and Experience tell us that the First magistrate will always be re-elected if he may be re-elected. He is then an officer for life. This once observed, it becomes of so much consequence to certain nations to have a friend or a foe at the head of our affairs that they will interfere with money and with arms. A Galloman or an Angloman will be supported by the nation he befriends. If once elected, and at a 2d. or 3d election outvoted by one or two votes, he will pretend false votes, foul play, hold possession of the reins of government, be supported by the states voting for him, especially if they be the central ones, lying in a compact body themselves, and separating their opponents; and they will be aided by one nation in Europe, while the majority are aided by another. The election of a President of America some years hence will be much more interesting to certain nations of Europe than ever the election of a king of Poland was. Reflect on all the instances in history, antient and modern, of elective monarchies, and say if they do not give foundation for my fears. The Roman emperors, the Popes while they were of any importance, the German emperors till they became hereditary in practice, the kings of Poland, the Deys of the Ottoman dependancies. It may be said that if elections are to be attended with these disorders, the seldomer they are repeated the better. But experience says that to free them from disorder they must be rendered less interesting by a necessity of change. No foreign power, nor domestic party, will waste their blood and money to elect a person who must go out at the end of a short period. The power of removing every fourth year by the vote of the people is a power which they will not exercise, and if they were disposed to exercise it they would not be permitted. The king of Poland is removeable every day by the diet. But they never remove him. Nor would Russia, the emperor &amp;c. permit them to do it.—Smaller objections are the Appeal on matters of fact as well as law; and the binding all persons, Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary by oath to maintain that constitution. I do not pretend to decide what would  be the best method of procuring the establishment of the manifold good things in this constitution, and of getting rid of the bad, whether by adopting it in hopes of future amendment; or, after it shall have been duly weighed and canvassed by the people, after seeing the parts they generally dislike, and those they generally approve, to say to them, ‘We see now what you wish. You are willing to give to your federal government such and such powers: but you wish at the same time to have such and such fundamental rights secured to you, and certain sources of convulsion taken away. Be it so. Send together your deputies again. Let them establish your fundamental rights by a sacrosanct declaration, and let them pass the parts of the constitution you have approved. These will give powers to your federal government sufficient for your happiness.’ This is what might be said, and would probably produce a speedy, more perfect and more permanent form of government. At all events, I hope you will not be discouraged from making other trials, if the present one should fail. We are never permitted to despair of the commonwealth.—I have thus told you freely what I like, and what I dislike merely as matter of curiosity, for I know it is not in my power to offer matter of information to your judgment, which has been formed after hearing and weighing every thing which the wisdom of man could offer on these subjects. I own I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive. It places the governors indeed more at their ease, at the expence of the people. The late rebellion in Massachusets has given more alarm than I think it should have done. Calculate that one rebellion in 13. states in the course of 11. years, is but one for each state in a century and a half. No country should be so long without one nor will any degree of power in the hands of government prevent insurrections. In England, where the hand of power is heavier than with us, there are seldom half a dozen years without an insurrection. In France, where it is still heavier, but less despotic, as Montesquieu supposes, than in some other countries, and where there are always 2. or 300,000 men ready to crush insurrections, there have been three in the course of the three years I have been here, in every one of which greater numbers were engaged than in Massachusets, and a great deal more blood was spilt. In Turkey, where the sole nod of the Despot is death, insurrections are the events of every day. Compare again the ferocious depredations of their insurgents with the order, the moderation and the almost self extinguishment of ours, and say finally whether peace is best preserved by giving energy to the government, or information to the people. This last is the most certain and the most legitimate engine of government. Educate and inform the whole mass of the people, enable them to see that it is their interest to preserve peace and order, and they will preserve it, and it requires no very high degree of education to convince them of this. They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.—After all, it is my principle that the will of the majority should prevail. If they approve the proposed constitution in all it’s parts, I shall concur in it chearfully, in hopes they will amend it whenever they shall find it works wrong. This reliance cannot deceive us, as long as we remain virtuous; and I think we shall be that, as long as agriculture is our principal object, which will be the case  while there remain vacant lands in any part of America. When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become corrupt as in Europe, and go to eating one another as they do there.—I have tired you by this time with disquisitions which you have already heard repeated by others a thousand and a thousand times, and therefore shall only add assurances of the esteem &amp; attachment, with which I have the honor to be, Dear Sir

mlv eifeftual preventative. The power of re­

not by the law of nations. To say, as Mr. Wilson does, that  
a bill of rights was ot necessary, because all is reserved in  
the case of the general government which is net given, while  
in the particular ones all is given which is not reserved, might

of our present confederation which had made the reserva-

has been a want of uniformity among the states as to the

of Poland was. Reflect on all the instances in history, an-  
cient and modern, of elective monarchies, and say if they do  
not give foundation for my fears. The Roman emperors, the  
popes, while they were of any importance, the German emper-  
ors, till they became hereditary in practice, the kings of Poland,  
the deys of the Ottoman dependencies. It may be said that if  
elections are to be attended with these disorders, the seldomer  
they are repeated the better. But experience savs that to free  
them from disorder, they must be rendered less interesting  
by a necessity of change. No foreign power, nor domestic  
party, will waste their blood and money to elect a person  
who must go out at the end of a short period. ‘The power  
of removing every fourth year by the vote of the people, is  
a power which they will not exercise; and if they were dis-  
posed to exercise it they would not be permitted. The king  
of Poland is removable every day by the diet, but they never  
remove him, nor would Russia, the emperor, &amp;c. permit them  
to do it.—Smaller objections are the appeal on matters of fact  
as well as law; and the binding all persons, legislative, execu-  
tive, and judiciary, by oath to maintain that constitution. I  
do not pretend to decide what would be the best method of  
procuring the establishment of the manifold good things in  
this constitution, and of getting rid of the bad; whether by  
adopting it in hopes of future amendment; or, after it shall  
have been duly weighed and canvassed by the people, after  
seeing the parts they generally dislike, and those they gene-

you are willing to give to your federal government such and  
such powers: but you wish at the same time to have such

oppressive; it places the governors indeed more at their ease,  
at the expense of the people. The late rebellion in Massa-  
chusetts has given more alarm than I think it should have  
done. Calulate that one rebellion in thirteen states in the  
course of eleven years, is but one for each state in a century  
and a half. No country should be so long without one, nor will  
any degree of power in the hands of government prevent in-  
surrections. In England, where the hand of power is heavier  
than with us, there are seldom half a dozen years without  
an insurrection. In France, where it is still heavier, but less  
despotic, as Montesquieu supposes, than in some other coun-  
tries, and where there are always two or three hundred thou-  
sand men ready to crush insurrections, there have been three  
in the course of the three years I have been here, in every  
one of which, greater numbers were engaged than in Mas-  
sachusetts, and a great deal more blood was spilt. In Turkey,  
where the sole nod of the despot is death, insurrections are  
the events of every day, Compare again the ferocious depre-  
dations of their insurgents with the order, the moderation,  
and the almost self-extinguishment of ours, and say, finally,  
whether peace is best preserved by giving energy to the go-  
vernment, or information to the people. This last is the most  
certain and the most legitimate engine of government. Edu-  
cate and inform the whole mass of the people, enable them  
to see that it is their interest to preserve peace and order,  
and they will preserve it; and it requires no very high de-  
gree of education to convince them of this; they are the only  
sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.x—After all,  
it is my principle that the will of the majority should pre-  
vail. If they approve the proposed constitution in all its  
parts, I shall concur in it cheerfully, in hopes they will amend  
it whenever they shall find it works wrong. This reliance  
cannot deceive us, as long as we remain virtuous; and I think  
we shall be that, as long as agriculture is our principal ob-  
ject, which will be the case while there remain vacant lands  
in any partof America. When we get piled upon one another  
in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become corrupt as in

Paris, 3\st December, 1787.  
Dear Sir: Just before I received your favor,  
asking my opinion on our new proposed Con­  
stitution, I had written my sentiments on the  
subject fully to my friend Mr. Madison. 1 hey  
concurred so exactly with yours, that the com­  
munication of them could answer no end but  
that of showing my readiness to obey you. 1  
therefore extracted that part from my lettei to  
him, and have reserved it for a good private  
conveyance, which has never offered till bow,  
bv Mr Parker. Though I pretend to make no  
mystery of my opinion, yet my distance from  
the scene gives me too much diffidence in my  
views of ii 10 detail them lengthily ami publicly.  
This diffidence is increased by my high opin­  
ion of the abilities and honesty of the framers  
of the Constitution. Vet we cannot help think­  
ing for ourselves. I suppose I see much pre­  
cious improvement in it, hut some seeds ofdan­  
ger, which might have been kept out of sight  
of the framers by a conciousness of their own  
honesty and a presumption that all succeeding  
rulers would he as honest as themselves. Make  
what use you please of the contents of the pa­  
per, but without quoting its author, who has  
no pretension to see what is hidden from oth­  
ers.  
I have the honor to he, with esteem, and re­  
spect, dear sir, your most obedient humble ser­  
vant. &#x27; THOMAS JEFFERSON.  
  
Colonel Forrest.  
“I like much ihe general idea of framing a  
Government which should go on of itself pea­  
ceably, without needing continual recurrence to  
the State Legislatures. I like the organization  
of the Government into legislative, judiciary, Sc  
executive I like the power given the Legis­  
lature to levy taxes, and, for that reason solely,  
I approve of the greater House being chosen hv  
the People directly:for, though I think a House  
so chosen will he very far inferior to the pres­  
ent Congress, will he very illy qualified to le­  
gislate for the Union, for foreign nations, See.  
yet this evil does not weigh against the good of  
preserving inviolate the fundamental principle  
that the People are not to be taxed but by Rep­  
resentatives chosen immediately by themselves.  
I am captivated by the compromise of the op  
posite claims of the great and little States, of  
the latter to equal, and the former to propor­  
tional influence. I am much pleased, too, with  
ihe substitution of the method of voting by per­  
sons, instead of that of voting by States; and I  
like the negative given to the Executive con­  
jointly with a third of either House, though I  
should have liked it better had the Judiciary  
been associated for that purpose, or invested  
sepei;ately with a similar power. There are  
other good things of less moment. I will now  
tell you what I do not like: First, the omission  
of a Bill of Rights, providing clearly, and with­  
out the aid of sophisms,for freedom of religion,  
freedom of the press, protection against stand­  
ing armies, restriction of monopolies, the eter­  
nal and unremitting force of the habeas corpus  
laws, and trials by jury in all matters of fact  
, triable by the laws of the land, and not by the  
law of nations. To say, as Mr. Wilson does,  
that a bill of rights was not necessary, because  
all is reserved in the case of the General Gov­  
ernment which is not given, while in the partic­  
ular ones, all is given which is not reserved,  
might do for the audience to which it was ad­  
dressed, but it is surely a gratis dictum,,the re­  
verse of which might just as well be said, and  
it is opposed by strong inferences from the body  
of the instrument, as well as from the omission  
of the clause of our present Confederation,  
which had made the reservation in express  
  
terms. It was hard to conclude, because there  
has been a want of uniformity among the States  
as to the cases triable by jury, because some  
have been so incautious as to dispense with this  
mode of trial in certain cases; therefore, the  
more prudent Slates shall be reduced to the  
same level of calamity. It would have been  
much more just and wise to have concluded  
the other way, that, as most of the States had  
preserved with jealousy this sacred palladium  
of liberty, those who had wandered should be  
brought back to it; and to have established gen­  
eral right rather than general wrong. For I  
consider all the ill as established, which may be  
established. I have a right to nothing which  
another has a right to take away; and Congress  
will have a right to take away trials by jury in  
all civil cases. Let me add, that a bill of rights  
is what‘the People are entitled to against every  
Government on earth, general or particular; &amp;  
what no just Government should refuse, or  
rest on inferences.  
“The second feature I dislike, and strongly  
dislike, is the abandonment, in every instance,  
of the principle of rotation in office, and most  
particularly in the case of the President Rea­  
son and experience tell us that the first magis­  
trate will always be re-elected, if he may he  
re-elected. He is then an officer for life. This  
once observed, it becomes ot so much conse­  
quence to certain nations to have a friend or a  
foe at the head of our affairs, that they will in­  
terfere, with money and with arms. A Gallo­  
man or an Angloman will be supported- by  
the nation he befriends. If once elected, and  
at a second or third election outvoted by one  
or two votes, he will pretend false votes, foul  
play, hold possession of the reins of Govern­  
ment, be supported by the States voting for  
him, especially if ihey be the central ones, ly­  
ing in a compact body themselres, and separa­  
ting their opponents; and they will be aided by  
one nation in Europe, while the majority are  
aided by another. The election of a President  
of America, some years hence, will be much  
more interesting to certain nations ol Europe  
than even the election of a king of Poland w as.  
“ Reflect on all the instances in history, an­  
cient and modern, of elective monarchies, and  
say if they do not give foundation lor my fears.  
The Roman emperors, the popes, while they  
were of any importance, the German imperors,  
till they became hereditary in practice, the kings  
1 of Poland, .the deys of the Ottoman dependen­  
cies. It may fie said that if elections are to be  
, attended with these disorders, the stldomer they  
are repeated the better. But experience says;  
  
that, to free them from disorder, they must be  
rendered less interesting by a necessity of  
change. Nor foreign power, nor domestic par­  
ty, will waste their blood and money to elect a  
person who must go out at the end of a short  
period. The power of removing every fourth  
year by the vote of the People, is a power which  
they will not exercise; and if they were dispos­  
ed to exercise it, they would not be permitted.  
The king of Poland is removable every day by  
the diet, but they never remove him, nor would  
Russia, the emperor, &amp;c. permit them to do it.  
Smaller objections are the appeal on matters of  
fact as well as law; and the binding all persons  
legislative, executive, and judiciary, by oath to  
maintain that constitution. I do not pretend  
to decide what would be the best method of pro­  
curing the establishment of the manifold good  
things in tlTis constitution, and of getting rid  
of the bad; whether by adop’ing it in hopes of  
future amendment; or, after it shall have been  
I duly weighed and canvassed by the People, af­  
I ter seeing the parts they generally dislike, and  
those they generally approve, to say to them,  
‘ we see now what you wish; you are willing to  
give to your Federal Government such and such  
I powers:, but you wish, at the same time, to have  
| such and such fundamental rights secured to  
| you, and certain sources of convulsion taken a­  
! wav; be it so—send together your deputies a­  
! gain, let them establish your fundamental rights  
by a sacrosanct declaration, and let them pass  
the parts of the constitution you have approv­  
ed These will give powers to your Federal  
Government sufficient for your happiness.’—  
This is what might be said, and \yould proba­  
bly produce a speedy, more perfect, and more  
permanent form of government. At all events,  
I hope vou will not be discouraged from mak­  
ing other trials, if the present one should fail—*  
we are never permitted to despair of the com­  
  
U1UIJ tV vUUMi  
u I have thus told you freely what I like and  
what I dislike, merely as matter of curiosity: for  
I know it is not in my power to offer matter of  
information to your judgment, which has been  
formed after hearing and weighing every thing  
which the wisdom of man could offer on those  
subjects. I own I am not a friend to a very  
energetic Government; it is always oppressive;  
it places the Governors indeed more at their  
ease, at the expense of the People. The late re­  
bellion in Massachusetts has given more alarm  
than I think it should have done. Calculate  
that one rebellion in thirteen States, in the  
course of eleven years, is but one for each State  
in a century and a half. No country should be  
so long without one, nor will any degree of  
power in the hands of Government prevent in­  
surrections. In England, where the hand of  
power is heavier than with us, there are seldom  
half a dozen years without an insurrection. In  
France, where it is still heavier, but less despo­  
tic, as Montesquieu supposes, than in some  
other countries, and where there are always two  
or three hundred thousand men ready to crush  
insurrections, there have been three * in the  
course of the three years I have been here, in  
every one of which, greater numbers were enga­  
ged than in Massachusetts, and a great deal  
more blood was spilt In Turkey, where the  
sole nod of the despot is death, insurrections  
are the events of every day. Compare again  
the ferocious depradations of their insurgents  
with the order, the moderation, anti the almost  
self-extinguishment of ours, and say, finally,  
whether peace is best preserved by giving en­  
ergy to the Government, or information to the  
People. &#x27;Phis last is the most certain and the  
most legitimate engine of Government. Edu­  
cate and inform the whole mass of the People,  
enable them to see that it is their interest to  
preserve peace and order, and they will preserve  
it; and it requires no very high degree cf edu­  
cation to convince them of this; they are the  
only sure reliance for the preservation of our  
liberty. After all, it is my principle that the  
will of the majority should prevail. If they ap­  
prove the proposed constitution in all its parts,  
I shall concur in it cheerfully, in tfte hopes they  
| will amend it whenever they shall find it works  
I wrong. This reliance cannot deceive us, as  
long as we remain virtuous; and I think we  
shall he that, as long as agriculture is our prin­  
cipal object, which will be the casp while there  
remain vacant lands in any part of America —  
When we get piled upon one another in large  
cities, as in Europe, we shall become corrupt  
&#x27; as in Europe, and go to eating one another as  
they do there. I have tired you by this time  
v&gt; ithdisquisitions which you have already heard  
repeated by others a thousand and a thousand  
times, and therefore shall only add assurance of  
the esteem and attachment, with which I ha\e  
the honor to be, dear sir,” See

them of this : they are the only sure reli­  
ance for the preservation of our liberty.  
After all, it is my principle that the will  
of tile m»j irity should prevail. If they  
approve the proposed constitution in all  
its parts, I shall c incur in it cheerfully, in  
hopes they will amend it whenever they  
shall find It works wrong. This reliance  
cannot deceive us, as long ns we remain  
virtuous; mil I think we shall he that, as  
lung as ag&#x27; irulture is our principal object  
which will he the case while there remain  
vacant lands in any part of America.—  
When vve get piled upon one another in  
large cities, as in Furope, vve shall become

another as they do ttieie. I have, tired  
you by this ti ue with disquisitions which,

Calculate that one rebellion in thirteen States, in the

without one, nor will any degree of power in the  
  
hands ot t.overnment prevent insurrections. In Eng­  
land, where the hand of power is heavier than -with  
us, thi?re are seldom half a dozen years without an  
  
insurrection. In Vrance, where it is still heavier, but  
  
less despotic, as Montesquieu supposes, than in some  
  
other countries, and where there are always two or  
three hundred thousand men ready to crush insur  
  
rections, there have been three m the course of the  
  
three years I have been here, in every one of which,  
  
greater numbers were engaged tlian in Massachusetts,  
  
and agreat deal more blood was spilt. In Turkey,  
  
when? the sole nod of the despot is death, insurrec  
  
tions jare the events ot every day. Compare again  
the feirocious depredations of their insunrents with  
  
the okler, the motleration, and the almostself-extinguishment  
of ours, and say, finally, whether peace is  
  
best preserved by giving energy to the Government,  
  
or imprmation to the People. This last is the most  
  
certain and the most legitimate encrine of tiovern  
  
mentj .Educate and inform the mas of the People,  
enable them to see that it is their interest to preserve  
  
peace; and order, and they will preserve it; and it re­

Dibsr 5ir:-—.J list before 1 received your favour,  
asking my opinion on our new proposed Constitu-  
tion 1 bad wriUeu my seiilimeuis on tbe subject  
fully to my friend. .\Ir. Madison. They concurred  
to exactly with yours, that llte cnininunication of  
tliem could answer no end but that of showing my  
readiness to obey you 1 I lerefure extrai t d that  
part from my letters to him, and have reserved it  
for a good private conveyance, which has never of-  
fered till now, by Mr. Pafkcr. TUoiigh I pretend  
to make no mystery of my opinion, yet my distance  
from the scone, gives me too miicb ditfidence in my  
views of it to detail them lengthily and publicly.  
The ditadence is increased by my high opinion of  
the abilities and honesty of the framers of the C on-  
Btitiitioo. Yetvve cannot help thinking furoiir-  
aelves. 1 suppose 1 see much precious improve-  
ment in it, lull some seeds of danger, winch might  
have been kept out of sight of the framers by a con-  
soioiisness of their own honesty, and a presiiinptiuii  
that all succeeding rulers would he as honest as!  
thamsclves. Make what use you please ofthecon-

• I likeiniicli tne general idea of framing a Govern-  
meni which should go on of itself peaceably, with-  
out needing continual recurrence to the State Le  
gislaliires. 1 like the organization of the Govern-  
ment into legislative, judiciary, and executive. 1  
like the power given the Legislature to levy taxes,  
and, for that reason solely, 1 appruveufibe greater  
House being clioseii by the people directly: for,  
though 1 think a House so chosen will be very far  
inferior to tlic present Congress, will he very illy  
qualified to legislate for the Union, for foreign na  
tioiis,&amp;c. yet tliis evil does not weigh against the  
good of preserving inviolate the fiindainental prin  
c. pie that the people are not to be taxed but by  
Representatives cliosen immediately hj themselves.  
  
1 am captivated by the compromise of the opposite  
claims of the great and little Slates, of the latter  
to equal, and the former to proportional infliieiu e.i  
1 am much pleased, loo, with the substitution of  
the method of voting by persons, instead of that of  
voting by Stakes; and I like the negative given to  
the Executive conjointly with a third of either  
House, though 1 should liave liked it belter bad the  
Judiciary been associated for that purpose, or in-  
vested separately with asimilarpower. There aie  
other g.jod things of less moment. 1 will now tell  
you what I do not like; First, the omission ol a Rill  
of Rights providing clearly, and wilhoiil the aid of  
sophisms, tor freedom of religion, freedom of the  
press, protection against standing armies, restric-

and not by the law of nations. To say, as .Mr. Wil-j

but it is surely a gratisdictiim. the reverse of whtel,  
might just as well he said; and it is opposed by  
strong lufereaces from the hoily of the instriimeut,  
as well as from the omission of the&#x27; clanscofmir  
p.-x-seal r&lt;infed«ralion, wluch had made the r»ser-

suiiie have lieen so incautious as to dispense witl  
I tills mode ol Inal in certain cases; tliei efnre, tin  
more prudent States shali be reduced to tlie saint  
level of calamity. It would have been much inuit  
just and wise to have concluded the other way, that,  
as most of the Idtates bad preserved with jealousy  
Ihissacred palladium of liberty, those w lU ii.id  
wandered should be hroiiglit back to it; and to have  
i.siahlished general right rather than genera,  
wrong. For 1 consider all the ill as&#x27; established  
which may be established. 1 have a right to noth  
mg wbioti another has a right to take away; and  
I&#x27;ongress will have aright to lake away trials bi  
jury ID civil cases. Let me add, that a lull lU ngbl*-  
is what the people are entitled to agaiusl every  
Government on earth, general or pailiciitar; and  
what 110 just Goveruuieut should refuse, or rest on  
inferences.  
  
“ J&#x27;he second feature I dislike, and strongly dis-  
like, is liie abandonment, in every instance ol the  
principle of rulatioo in oflice, and most particular  
ly in the case of the President. Keasuii and expe-  
rience tell us that tbe first magistrate will always  
be re-elected, if he may be re-elected. He is Ibcn  
an otficer for life. This once observed, it becomes  
of so imich consequence to certain nations to have  
a friend or a foe; the bead of our aflairs, tbat they  
will inlertere with money and wilb arms. A Gal-  
lonian or an .Angloman w ill be siippurled by the  
nation he befrieud.s. If once elected, and at a se- |  
cond or third election outvoted by one or two votes  
he will pretend false votes, foul play, hold posses-  
sion of the reins of Government, he supported by  
the States voting for him, especially if they be the  
central ones, lying in a compact body themselves,  
and separating (heir opponents; and they will be  
aided by one nation in Europe, while the majority  
are aided by another. Tbe election of a President  
of America, some years hence, will be mlicli more  
interesting to certain nations of Europe tbau even  
the election of a king of Poland was.  
  
“Reflect on all the instances in histoVy, ancient  
and modern, of elective monarcliies, and say if they  
do not give foundation fur my fears. &#x27;J he Roman  
Emperors, the Popes, while they were of any impor-  
tance, the German Emperors, till they become  
hereditary iu prartice, the Ktrsgs of Poland, the  
Leys of the Ottoman dependencies. It may be said  
that if elections are to he attended w itii these dis  
orders, the seidumcr they are repeated, &#x27;..&gt;e better.  
But experience says, that to free liiem from disor-  
der, they must he reiideieJ less interesting by a  
necessity ofebange. No foreign power, nor doiucsr  
tic parly, will waste tlieir blood and money to elect  
a person who must go out at the end of a short pe-  
riod. The power of removing every fuiirlb year by  
the vote of the People, is a power wbicli they will  
not exercise; and if they were disposed to exercise  
it, they would nut be pcriiiitled. The king of Po-  
land is romoveable every day by the diet, but they  
never remove him, nor would Russia, the Emperor,  
&amp;c. permit them to do it. — Smaller ubjectious are  
the appeal on matters of fact as well as law; and  
the binding all pessons, legislative, executive, and  
judiciary, by oath to inaintaiii that constitution. I  
do nut pretend to decide what would be the best  
method of procuring the estabjishment of the mani-  
fold good things in this constitution, and of getting  
rid of the bad; whether by adopting it in hopes of  
future amendment; or, after it shall have been duly  
iveighed and canvassed by the people, after seeing  
the parts they generally dislike, and those they  
generally approve, to say to them, ‘we see now what  
you wish; you ate willing to give to your Federal  
Government such and such powers; hut you wish at  
I he same time, to have such and such fiiudaiiieulal  
rights secured to you, and certain sources of doii-  
vulsiou taken away; he it so — send together your  
deputies again, let them establish your fiindameu-  
lal rights Dy a sacrosanct declaration, and let them  
pass to the parts of the oousUtiiliuu you hare ap-  
proved. — Tlicse will give powers to your Federal  
Guvetnineut siilficieol fur your happiness. This is  
what might he said, and would probably prudiire  
speedy, more perfect, and more permanent forms  
of Government. At all events, 1 tiupe you will md  
be discouraged from making other trials, if the pres-  
ent one should fail, we are never permilted to des-  
pair of the ruminonwealth.  
  
“1 have thus told you freely what I likeand what  
i dislike, merely as matter of curiusitj: as 1 kuuw  
it is not in my power to olfer mailer of iiilormatiou  
to your judgment, which has been furiiied after  
hearing and weighing every thing which the wisdom  
of man could olfer on these siihjecls. 1 own 1 am  
not a friend to a very energetic Goveriiineiit; it is  
always oppressive; it places the Government indeed  
more at tlieir ease, at the expense of the people.  
The late rebellion in Massachusetts lias given more  
alarm than I think it shoiil.d have dune. Calculate  
that one rebellion in thirteen btales, in the course  
of eleven years, is but one for each hitate in a ceii-  
lui y and a half. No country should he so lung  
without one, nor will any degree of power in the  
(lands of Government prevent insurrections. In  
England, where the hand of power is heavier than  
with us, there are seldom half a duzen years with-  
out an insiirrcctioii. in Fiance, where it is still  
lieavier, hut less despotic, as Montesqiiien supposed  
than ill some other countries, and wlierc there are  
always two or three liundrea thousand men ready to  
crush insurrecliuns, there have been three ,n the  
course of the three years I have been here, in every  
one of which, greater miinbers were engaged than  
in Massachusetts, and a great deal more blood was  
spilt. In Turkey, where the n-d of the despot is  
death, insurrections are the events of every day. —  
Compare again the ferocious depredations of their  
insurgeots witli the order, tlie muderaliou,anU toe  
almost self-exlingnishinent, of ours, and say, final-  
ly, whether peace is best preserved by giviugener-  
gy to the Government, ur infuraiatlon to the people.  
This last is the most certain and the iiiosl legiti-  
mate engine of governmenl. Educate and iiilurm  
the whole mass of .Uje people, enable tliemtosee  
that it is their interest to preserve peace and order  
and they will preserve it; and it requires no very  
high degree of education to convince them of I Ins;  
they are the only sure re! at. je for the preservation  
of uiir liberty. Alter all, i. is iny principle that  
the will of the majority should prevail. If they ap-  
pruve the proposed cuostiliilion in all its parts, I  
shall concur in it cheerfully, in hopes they will a  
mend il whenever they shall find it works wrong.  
&#x27;This reliance cannot de&lt; eive ns. as long as we re-  
main virtuous; and I think we shall he that, as long  
as agriculture is our piiucipal oliject, which will he  
the case while there remain vacant l.in .s in any  
part of America. \\ i,en we get piled upon one an*  
other iu large cities, as in Europe, we shall become  
corrupt, ds in Europe, and go to eating one auulb-

with disquisitions whieli you have already heard  
repeated by others a thuiiSHiid anil a Ihuusand

From Mr. Jefferson’s Posthumous Works.  
TO JAMES MADISON.  
Panis, December 20, 1787  
  
“Town I am nota friend to every  
It is always  
oppressive. It places the governors,  
indeed, more at their ease, at the ex-  
pense of the people. The late rebellion  
in Massachusetts has given more alarm  
than [I think it should have done. Cal-  
culate that one rebellion in thirteen  
states, in the course of eleven years, is  
but one for each state in a century and  
a half. No country should be so long  
without one. Nor will any degree of  
power in the hands of government pre-  
vent insurrections. England, where  
the hand of power is heavier than with  
us, there are seldom half a dozen years  
without insurrection. In France, where  
it is still heavier, but less despotic, as  
Montesquieu supposes, than*in some  
other countries, and where there are  
always two or three hundred thousand  
men ready to crush insurrectionists,  
there have been three in the course of  
the three years I have been here, in  
every one of which greater nuwbers  
have been engaged than in Massachu-  
  
i setts, and a great deal more blood was  
  
spilt. In Turkey, where the sole nod  
of the despot is death, insurrections are  
the events of every day.—Compare,  
of  
their insurgents, with the order, mode-  
ration, and the almost self extinguish-  
ment of ours. And say, finally whether  
peace is best preserved by giving ener-  
vy to the government, or Information to

government. Educate and inform the

to see that it is their interest to preserve  
peace and order, and they will preserve  
them. And it requires no very high  
  
degree of education to convince them of  
  
this. They are the only sure reliance  
for the preservation of our liberty. Af-  
ter all, it is my principle that the will  
of the majority should prevail. If they  
approve the proposed constitution in  
ull its parts, I shall concur in it cheer-  
fully, in hopes they will amend it when-

than the cool and calculating manner, in which he surveys the  
probable occurrence of domestic rebellions. ‘I am,’ he says,  
‘not a friend to a very energetic government. It is always op-  
pressive. It places the governors, indeed, more at their ease, at  
the expense of the people. The Jate rebellion in Massachusetts  
(in 1787) has given more alarm, than I think it should have done.  
Calculate, ihat one rebellion in thirteen States, in the course of  
eleven years, is but one for each State, in a century and a half.  
No country should be so long without one. Nor will any degree  
of power in the hands of government prevent insurrections.

“‘T like much the general idea of framing a government, which would  
go on of itself, abi without needing continual recurrence to the State  
legislatures. I like the organization of the government into legislative,  
judiciary, and executive. like the power given the legislature to levy  
taxes, and for that reason solely, I approve of the greater house being cho-  
sen by the people directly. For, though I think a house so chosen, will  
be very far inferior to the present Congress, will be very illy qualified to  
legislate for the Ufion, for foreign nations, &amp;c. yet this evil does not weigh  
against the good of preserving inviolate the fundamental principle that the  
people are not to be taxed, but by representatives chosen immediately by  
themselves. I am captivated by the compromise of the opposite claims of  
the great and little States, of the latter to equal, and the former to propor-  
tional influence. I am much pleased too with the substitution of the me-  
thod of voting by persons, instead of that of voting by States; and I like  
the negative given to the executive, conjointly with a third of either house,  
though I should have liked it better had the judiciary been associated for  
that purpose, or invested separately with a similar power. There are  
other good things of less moment. I will now tell you what [ do not like.  
First, the omission of a bill of rights, providing clearly and without the  
aid of sophism for freedom of religion, freedem of the press, protection  
against standing armies, restriction against monopolies, the eternal and  
unremitting force of the habeas corpus laws, and trials by jury in all mat-  
ters of fact triable by the laws of the land, and not by the laws of nations.  
To say, as Mr. Wilson does, that a bill of rights was not necessary, be-  
cause all is reserved in the case of the general government, which is not  
given, while in the particular ones, all is given which is not reserved, might  
do for the audience to which it was addressed, but it is surely a gratis  
dictum, the reverse of which might just as well be said; and it is opposed  
by strong inferences from the body of the instrument, as well! as from the  
omission of the clause of our present confederation, which had made the  
reservation in express terms. it was hard to conclude, because there has  
been a want of uniformity among the States, as to the cases triable by  
jury, because some have been so incautious as to dispense with this mode  
of trial in certain cases, therefore, the more prudent States shall be reduced  
to the same level of calamity. It would have been much more just and  
wise to have concluded the other way, that as most of the States had  
preserved with jealousy this sacred palladium of liberty, those which had  
wandered, should be brought back to it; and to have established general  
i rather than general wrong. For I consider all the ill as established,  
which may be established. I have a right to nothing, which another has  
a right to take away; and Congress will have a right to take away trials  
by jury in all civil cases. Let me add, that a bill of rights is what the  
people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or par-  
ticular, and which no just government should refuse or rest on inference.  
  
“The second feature I dislike, and strongly dislike, is the abandonment,

in every instance, of the principle of rotation in office, and most particu-  
larly in the case of the President. Reason and experience tell us, that the  
first magistrate will always be re-elected, if he may be re-elected. He is  
then an officer for life. ‘This once observed, it becomes of so much conse-  
quence to certain nations, to have a friend or.a foe at the head of our affairs,  
that they will interfere with money and with arms. A Galloman or an  
Angloman, will be supported by the nation he befriends. If once elected,  
and at a second or third election out-voted by one or two votes, he will  
pretend false votes, foul play, hold possession of the reins of government,  
be supported by the States voting for him, especially if they be the central  
ones, lying in a compact body themselves and separating their opponents ;  
and they will be aided by one nation in Europe, while the majority are  
aided by another. The election of a President of America, some years  
hence, will be much more interesting to certain nations of Europe than  
ever the election of a king of Poland was. Reflect on all the instances in  
history, ancient and modern, of the elective monarchies, and say, if they  
do not give foundation for my fears; the Roman Emperors, the Popes  
while they were of any importance, the German Emperors till they became  
hereditary in practice, the Kings of Poland, the Deys of the Ottoman de-  
pendencies. It may be said that if elections are to be attended with these  
disorders, the less frequently they are repeated the better. But experience  
says, that to free them from disorder, they must be rendered Jess interest-  
ing by a necessity of change. No foreign power, nor domestic party, will  
waste their blood and money to elect a person who must go out at the end  
of a short period. The power of removing every fourth year by the vote  
of the people, is a power which they will not exercise, and if they were  
disposed to exercise it, they would not be permitted. The king of Poland  
is removeable every day by the Diet, but they never remove him. Nor  
would Russia, the Emperor, &amp;c. permit them to do it. Smaller objections  
are, the appeals on matters of fact as well as law; and the binding all  
persons, legislative, executive, and judiciary, by oath to maintain the  
constitution. I do not pretend to decide what would be the best method  
of procuring the establishment of the manifold good things in this consti-  
tution, and of getting rid of the bad. Whether by adopting it in hopes of  
future amendments ; or after it shall have been ode weighed and canvass-  
ed by the people, after seeing the parts they generally dislike, and those  
they generally approve, to say to them, ‘We see now what you wish.  
You are willing to give to your federal government snch and such powers,  
but you wish, at the same time, to have such and such fundamental rights  
secured to you, and certain sources of convulsion taken away. Be it so.  
Send together your deputies again. Let them establish your fundamental  
rights by a sacro-sanct declaration, and let them pass the parts of the con-  
stitution you have —— These will give powers to your federal  
government sufficient for your happiness.’  
  
“This is what might be said, and would probably, produce a speedy,  
more perfect, and more permanent form of government. At all events, I  
hope you will not be discouraged from making other trials, if the present  
one should fail. We are never permitted to despair of the commonwealth.  
I have thus told you, freely, which I like, and what I dislike, merely as a  
matter of curiosity; for | know that it is not in my power to offer matter of  
information to your judgment, which has been formed after hearing and  
weighing every thing which the wisdom of man could offer on these sub-  
jects. 1 own] am nota friend toa very energetic government; it is always  
very oppressive. It places the governors, indeed, more at ease, at the ex-  
pense of the people. The late rebellion in Massachusetts has given more  
alarm than I think it should have done. Calculate that one rebellion in

thirteen States, in the course of eleven years is but one for each State in a  
century and a half, no country should be as long without one, nor will any  
degree of power in the hands of government prevent insurrection. In Eng-  
land, where the hand of power is heavier than with us, there are seldom  
half a dozen years without an insurrection. In France, where it is still  
heavier, but less despotic, as Montesquieu supposes, than in some other  
countries, and where there are always two or three hundred thousand men  
ready to crush insurrections, there have been three in the course of the  
three years | have been here, in every one of which greater numbers  
were engaged than in Massachusetts, and a great deal more blood spilt.  
In Turkey, where the sole nod of the despot is death, insurrections are the  
events of every day. Compare, again, the ferocious depredations of their  
insurgents, with the order, the moderation, and the almost self-extinguish-  
ment of ours. And say, finally, whether peace is best preserved by givin  
energy to the government, or information to the people; this last is the  
most certain, and the most legitimate engine of government. Educate and  
inform the whole mass of this people, enable them to see that it is their  
interest to preserve peace and good order, and they will preserve them,  
and it requires no very high degree of education to convince them of this;  
they are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty. After all  
it is my principle, that the will of the majority should prevail. If they  
approve the proposed constitution in all its parts, I shall concur in it cheer-  
fully, in hopes they will amend it, whenever they find it works wrong.  
This reliance cannot deceive us as long as we remain virtuous, and I think  
we shall do so, as long as agriculture is our principal object, which will be  
the case, while there remain vacant lands in any part of America. When  
we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall be-  
come — as in Europe, and go to eating one another, as they do there.  
I have tired you, by this time, with disquisitions which you have already  
heard repeated by others a thousand and a thousand times, and therefore

promote it by money—if need be, by arms. Wth singular presci-  
ence he prophecies, in 1787, that in a few years the election of a  
president of the United States “ will be much more interesting to  
certain nations of Europe than ever the election of a king of  
Poland was.” Therefore, he thought, as the Roman emperors, the  
popes, the German emperors, the king of Poland, and the deys of  
the Ottoman dependencies, had all once been elective, but after-  
torward became absolute or hereditary, so the power of removing  
every fourth year by the vote of the people would be a power which  
they could not exercise, or, if disposed to exercise it, would not be  
permitted. The King of Poland, he says, was removable every day  
by the Diet ; yet they never removed him, nor would the European  
monarchs have sanctioned his removal. He winds up his objections  
by.declaring that the president, as provided for in the Federal  
Constitution, “seems a bad edition of a Polish king. He may be  
elected from four years to four years for life.’* This feature of  
the Constitution, however, has so far with us proved less serious in  
practice than alarming in theory. Washington held over for two

It was Jefferson&#x27;s favorite doctrine  
that a republican government is  
stronger when it reposes on the direct  
support of the people themselves.  
He said, writing from Paris in 1787,  
to James Madison:  
&quot;I own I am&#x27;not a friend to a very  
energetic government. It is always  
oppressive. It places the Governors,  
indeed, more at their ease at the ex­  
nense of the people. Tlie late rebel  
lion in Massachusetts ha given more  
alarm than I think it should have  
done. Calculate that one rebellion  
in thirteen States in the course ol  
eleven years is but one lor each Slate  
in a century and a bait No country  
should be to lonz without one. Nor  
will any degree of power in the hands  
of the Government prevent insurrec­

Dower is heavier than with us, there  
&#x27;re seldom half a dozen years witb-  
I out an insurrection. In Franoe, where

and a great deal more blood spilt.  
In Turkey, whero tho sole nod of tho  
dospot is death, insurrections aro the  
events of every day- Compare again  
the ferocious depredations of their iu­  
s irgonts with the order, tho modera­

whether peaco is bost preserved by

SOME STEANGE FEARS.  
Beason and experience tell us that the first mag­  
istrate will always be re-elected. If he may he re­  
elected. He is then an officer lor life. This once  
observed, It becomes of so much consequence to  
certain nations, to have a friend or a foe at the  
head of our affairs, that they will Interfere with  
money and with arms. A Galloman or an Anglo­  
man will be supported by the nation he defends.  
Reflect on all the instances In history,  
ancient and modem, of elective monarchies, and  
say If they do not give foundation for my fears;
