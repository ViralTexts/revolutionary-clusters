ur commands me to acquaint the House that he will not give his Assent to it; and there being no Person to judge between the Governor and the House in these parts, he will immediately transmit to his Majesty his reasons for so doing.  
  
VI  
  
  Resolved,  
[September 16, 1756]  
  
That the said Proprietary Instructions are arbitrary and unjust, an Infraction of our Charter, a total Subversion of our Constitution, and a manifest Violation of our Rights, as freeborn Subjects of England.  
  
 Resolved,  
That the Bill for granting Sixty Thousand Pounds to the King’s Use, to which the Governor has been pleased to refuse his Assent, contains nothing “inconsistent with our Duty to the Crown, or the Proprietary Rights,” and is agreeable to Laws which have been hitherto enacted within this Province, and received the Royal Approbation.  
 Resolved,  
That the Right of granting Supplies to the Crown is in the Assembly alone, as an essential Part of our Constitution, and the Limitation of all such Grants as to the Matter, Manner, Measure and Time, is only in them.  
 Resolved,  
That it is the Opinion of this House, that the many frivolous Objections, which our Governors have been advised from Time to Time to make to our Money Bills, were calculated with a View to embarrass and perplex the Representatives of the People, to prevent their doing any Thing effectual for the Defence of their Country, and thereby render them odious to their gracious Sovereign, and to their Fellow Subjects, both at Home and Abroad.  
 Resolved,  
That the Proprietaries encreasing their Restrictions upon the Governor, beyond what they had ever done before, at a Time when the Province is invaded by the King’s Enemies, and barbarous Tribes of Indians are ravaging the Frontier Settlements, and their forbidding the Passing of any Bills whereby Money may be raised for the Defence of the Inhabitants, unless those Instructions are strictly complied with, is tyrannical, cruel and oppressive, with Regard to the People, and extremely injurious to the King’s Service: Since if the Assembly should adhere to their Rights, as they justly might, the whole Province would be thrown into Confusion, abandoned to the Enemy, and lost to the Crown.  
The House therefore, reserving their Rights in their full Extent on all future Occasions, and PROTESTING against the Proprietary Instructions and Prohibitions, do, nevertheless, in Duty to the King, and Compassion for the suffering Inhabitants of their distressed Country, and in humble but full Confidence of the Justice of His Majesty, and a British Parliament, wave their Rights on this present Occasion only; and do further Resolve, That a new Bill be brought in for granting a Sum of Money to the King’s Use, and that the same be made conformable to the said Instructions, &amp;c
