Representatives was finished yesterday and thus an end put for sometime to the iniquities which upon such occasions are always practised. The friends of the Democratic Mr Livingston and of the Aristocratic Mr Watts flatter themselves that their respective Candidate will obtain the seat. Among the many odd circumstances in this world that the Livingston family should obtain the reputation of Democrats is not the least curious but not surprising.  
  
“Observe their courtship to the common people:  
How they do seem to dive into their hearts,  
With humble and familiar courtesy;  
What reverence do they throw away on slaves;  
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles,  
  
And patient underbearing of their fortunes,  
As ’t’were to banish their affects with them.  
Off goes each bonnet to an oyster wench:  
A brace of draymen bid God speed them well!  
And had the tribute of their humble knees;  
With—Thanks our Countrymen our loving friends.”
