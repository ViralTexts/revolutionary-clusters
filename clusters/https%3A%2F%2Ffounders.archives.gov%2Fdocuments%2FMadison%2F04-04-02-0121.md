[ca. October 1826]  
  
This had been prepared by J.M. as a preface or prospectus for the “Memoir” when that alone was intended for immediate publication.  
The opinion universally entertained of the extraordinary abilities of Thos. Jefferson and the signal evidences lately given by his country of a profound sense of his patriotic services, and of veneration for his memory, have induced his Executor, who is also the Legatee of his manuscrip[t] papers, to believe that an early publication of the following Memoir making a part of them, would be particularly acceptable to his fellow-citizens. The Memoir commences with circumstancial notices of his earliest life, and is continued to his arrival at New York March 1790, when he entered on the duties of the Department of State, of which he had been just appointed Secretary.  
From the aspect of the Memoir, it may be presumed that parts of it at least had been written for his own and his family’s use only; and in a style without the finish of his revising pen. There is no part of it, however, minute and personal as it may be, which the reader would wish to have been passed over by the Editor: whilst not a few parts of that description will by some be regarded, with a particular interest.  
The contents of the Memoir, succeeding the biographical pages, may be designated as follows:  
I. General facts &amp; anecdotes relating to the origin and early stages of the contest with G. Britain.  
II. Historical circumstances relating to the confederation of the States.  
III. Facts and anecdotes local and general preliminary to the Declaration of Independence.  
IV. An exact account of the circumstances attending that memorable act, in its preparation, and its progress through Congress with a copy, from the original draught in the hand-writing of the Author; and a parallel column in the same hand, showing the alterations made in the same draught by Congress.  
The Memoir will be considered enriched, deeply enriched by the debates in Congress on the great question of Independence, as they were taken down by Mr. Jefferson at the time; and which, though in a compressed form, present the substance of what passed on that memorable occasion. This portion of the work derives peculiar value from its perfect authenticity, being all in the hand writing of that distinguished member of the body; from the certainty that this is the first disclosure to the world  
  
of those Debates, and from the probability or rather certainty that a like knowledge of them is not to be expected from any other source.  
The same remarks are applicable to the Debates in the same Congress, preserved in the same manner on two of the original articles of Confederation. The first is the article fixing the rule for assessing the quotas of supply to the Common Treasury: the second, the article which declares, that in determining questions “each Colony should have one vote.” The debates on both are not only interesting in themselves but curious also in relation to like discussions of the same subjects on subsequent occasions.  
V. Views of the connections &amp; transactions of the U. S. with foreign nations at different periods; particularly a narrative, with many details, personal &amp; political, of the causes &amp; early course of the French Revolution as exhibited to the observation of the author, during his diplomatic residence at Paris. The narrative, with the intermingled reflections on the character and consequences of that Revolution, fill a considerable space in the Memoir, and form a very important part of it.  
VI. Within the body of the Memoir, or referred to as an Appendix, are other papers, which were thought well entitled to the place they occupy. Among them are: 10 A paper drawn up in the year 1774 under the title of——.  
Though heretofore in print, it will be new to most readers, and be regarded by all as the most ample and precise enumeration of British violations that had then appeared, or perhaps that has since been presented in a form at once so compact and so compleat. 20. A penal Code, being part of a revised Code of Laws prepared by appointment of the Legislature of Virginia in 1776, with reference to the Republican form of Government and to the principles of humanity congenial therewith, and with the improving spirit of the Age. Annexed to the several articles, are remarks of the Author, explanitory and otherwise worthy of being preserved by the aid of the press: 30 A historical and critical review of the repeal of the laws establishing the Church in Virginia; and which was succeeded by the Act. This act, it is well known was always held by Mr. Jefferson to be one of his best efforts in the cause of Liberty to which he was devoted. And it is certainly the strongest legal barrier that could be erected against the connection between Church &amp; State so fatal to the purity of both.  
4. An elaborate paper concerning a Money Unit, prepared in the year   and which laid the foundation of the system adopted by Congress for a Coinage and money of account, in the U. S.  
For other particulars not here noted, the reader is referred to the volume itself.  
The termination of the Memoir at the date mentioned by the Author, may be explained by the laborious tasks assumed or not declined by him on his return to private life; which with his great age, did not permit  
  
him to reduce his materials into a state proper to be embodied in such a work.

Thr*opinion universal entertained of the ex­  
traordinary abilities of l homas Jefferson, and  
the signal evidence given by his country of a  
profound sense of his patriotic services, and of  
veneration for his memory hare induced the  
Editor, who is both Executor and the Legatee  
of his Manuscript papers, to believe that an  
extensive publication from them,would be par­  
ticularly acreptable to the American people.  
The Memoir, contained in the first volume,  
commi nces with circumstantial notices of nls  
earliest life; and is continued to his arrival  
in New York in March, 1790. when he enter­  
ed on the duties of the Department of Sta&#x27;e,  
of which he had bren juit &lt;»ppoin’ed Secretary.  
From the aspect of the Memoir, it may be  
presumed that parts of it, at least, had been  
written for his own and his family’s use only;  
and in a style without the finisn of his revising  
pen. There is, however, no part of it minu&#x27;.e

lion, will, by some, be regarded with a partial

The contents of the Memoir, succeeding  
the biogrophical pages, may be designated as  
follows;  
1. General facts and anecdotes relating to  
the origin and tarly stages of the contest with  
Britain.  
II. Historical ciirumstances relating to the  
Confederation of the States.  
Ill , Facts and anecdotes local and general,  
preliminary to the Declaration of Indepen­

IV. Ad exact account of the circumstances

a copt from &#x27;he original draught, in the wiit­  
_«■* °f &quot;&gt;■• Annor-^d,  
in the draught by Con gress.  
The Memoir wi l be considrred not a little  
enriched by the Debates in Cungrtss, on the  
great question of I dependence, as they were  
tak. n down by Mr. .MF&#x27;rson at the time, and  
which though in a&#x27;omptessed form, present  
&#x27;he substance of what passed on that memora­

I p- culiar value from its perfect authenticity, be­

nn mber of the b&#x27;*dy; from the certainty that  
ti&#x27;is is the firs: disclosure to those debates; and  
from &#x27;he probability, or rather certainty; that  
a like knowledge of them is not to be expect­  
ed from any other source. The same remarks  
are applicable to the Debates in the same Con­  
gtess, presetted in the same manner,on two of  
theoiiginal Articles of Confederation. The  
first is the articlr fixing the rate of assessing the  
quotas of-upply to the common Treasury: the  
second isttie article which declares,‘that in de­  
t rmming questions each Colony should have

V’. Views of the connections and transac­  
ting of the United Stales with foreign nations  
at different periods;* particularly a narrative,  
with many details, peisonal and political of the  
causes and early course of the French Revolu­  
tion, as exhibited to the observation of the Au­  
thor during his diplomatic residence at Paris.  
I’he narrative, with thr intermingled reflections  
on the character and consequences of that Re­

VI. Within the body of the Memoir, or re­  
ferred to as an Appendix, are other papers,  
whir h were thought eutit&#x27;ed to the place th&lt; y

up in the year 1774 as * Instructions to our  
delegates in Congress. Though heretofore in  
print, it will be new to most r-aders; and will  
be regarded bv all as the most ample and pre

ptesenied in a form at once so compact a&#x27;»d so

of the Legislature «f Virginia in 1776, with ie  
f- rence .o th&lt; Republican foim of Government,  
to the principles of humanity congenial there­  
with, and with the improving spirit or the  
age. Annexed to the several articles, are ex­  
p anatory and other remarks of the Author,  
worthy of being presetved oy the aid of the  
press. 3. A historical and critical review of  
the repeal of the laws establishing Religious  
freedom.” This act, it is well known, was al­  
ways held by Mr Jefferson to be one of his best  
«ff»rts in thr causr of liberty to which he was  
d&quot;Voted: and it is certainly the strongest legal  
bat tier that could be elected against a connec­  
tion between Church and Stale, so fatal in its  
tendency to the purity of both. 4. An elabo­  
rate paper concerning a money Unit, prepared  
in the year 1781, and which laid the foundation  
of the system adopt, d by Congress for a coin­  
age and money of account. For other particu­  
lars, not here noted, the Reader is referred to  
the volume itse f.  
The termination, of the Memoir, at the date  
  
f mentioned, by the Author, may be explained by  
the laborious tasks issumed y not declined by  
him, on his retum.to private life; which, with  
his great age, did hot permit him to reduce his  
materials imo a state proper to be embodied in

Author; and a parallel column, in the tame hand,  
shewing tho alterations made in the draught by  
Congress.  
The Memoir will be considered not a li&#x27;tle rn&#x27;

c.ares, ‘that in determining questions each colony

of the United States with foreign nations, at dif­  
ferent period-; particularly a narrative, with ma­  
nj details, personal ami political, of the causes and  
early course of tho French Revolution, as ex­  
hibited to the observation of the Author during hi a  
diplomatic residence at Paris. The narrative,  
with the intermingled re||. ctions on the charac­  
ter and consequences of (list Revolution, fills a  
cousideiable space in tho Memoir, and form a Ve­  
ry important part of it.

ferred to as an Appendex, aro other papeis which  
were thought well entitled to the place they oc­

all as the ino-t ample and preci-e enumeration of  
Rritish violations that had then appeared, or, per­  
haps, that has since been presented in a lorin at  
once so compart and ho complete. 2. A Penal  
code, being part ot a Revised Code of Laws, pre­  
pared by appointm lit of the Leginlaluro ol Vir­  
ginia in 1776, with reference to the Republican  
lorm ot (iov&lt; rnment, and to (he principles of hu­  
manity congenial therewith, nod with the im­  
proving spirit oi the age. Annexed to the sever­  
al articles, are explanatory and other remarks of  
j the Author, worthy ot being presorveil by the aid  
jolihe press. 3. A historical and critical review  
, of the repeal ol the laws establishing the Church  
. in \ irginia; which was followed by the &quot;Act for  
I establishing Religious freedom.” This Act, it is

“The opinion universally cutcrtuinod of the extruor­  
dinary abilities of Thomas Jefferson, and the signal j  
evidence given by his country of a profound sense of­  
his patriotic services, and of veneration for lus um­  
uiory, have induced tho editor, who is both lus ex-&#x27;  
eculor and the legatee of Ins manuscript papers, to 1  
believe that an extensive publication from them, I  
would he particularly ucccptublo to tho American i  
people.  
The Memoir, contained in the first vol., commences I  
with circumstantial notices of his earliest life; hiiU is i  
continued to his nr*ivnl in New York in March, 1700,!  
when he entered «»u the duties of the Department &#x27;  
o* State, of which he had been just appointed So- j  
cretary.  
From the aspect of tho Moiaoir, it may bo prosu- !  
...^o iU*i i’&quot;**’® »*. •» ,****-o, Imd boon written tor his j  
own nm his family’s use only; r»tnl in a style without  
the ..nish of his revising pen. There, is however,  
no part of it, minute and personal aj* it may be, which  
the reader would wish to have been passed over by  
the editor; whilst not a few parts of that descrip- 1  
tion, will by some, bo regarded with a particular inter­  
net.  
  
&#x27;l’he contents of the Memoir, succeeding the bio­  
graphical pages, may be designated as follows:  
I. General facts and anecdotes relating.to tho  
origin and early stages of the contest with Great Bri­  
tain. ,  
II. Historical circumstances relating&#x27;to the Con­  
federation of the States.  
III. Facts and anecdotes, local and general, pxeTi-1  
miuary to the I*»claration of Independence.  
IV. An exact account of tbe circumstances attend- 1  
ing that memorable act, in its preparation and its pro-!  
gross through Congress; with a copy from the original I  
draught, in the hntul vriting of the JoUiot; nud a jm-1  
railcl column, in the same hand, shewing the altera­  
tions made in the draught by Con gross.  
Tho Memoir will be considered not a liUl®elirich­  
cd by the Debates in Congrats, on the great question  
of Independence, os they were taken down by Mr.  
Jeflcrso nit tho time, and which, though in a com­  
pressed fonn, present the substance of what passed on  
that memorable occasion. This portion of tho work  
derives peculiar value from its perfect authenticity,  
being all in the hand writing of that distinguished  
member of tho body; front the certainty that”this is  
the firet disclosure to the world, of those Debates;  
and from the probability, or rather oertuinty. that a  
like knowledge of them i* not to be expect .1 from  
any other source. The same remarks are applicable  
to the DabatoH in the sanw* Congress, preserved  
in tho same manner, on two of tho original ar­  
ticles of Confederation. The first is tLo arti­  
cle fixing the rate of assessing the quotas of sup­  
ply to the roiiimou Treasury: the second is tho arti­  
cle which declares, ‘that iu determining questions  
each colony should have one vote.’ Tho^Dcbatca on  
both are not onlv interesting in themselves, but cu­  
rious, also, in relation to like discussions of the sub­  
ject on subsequent occasions.  
t V. Views of the connections and transactions of the  
U. States with foreign nations, at ciitfeieut periods;  
particularly a narrative, with mnny details, personal  
and political.of the causes &amp; course early of the French  
Devolution, as exhibited to the observation of the  
Author during his diplomatic residence at Pari?. The  
narrative, with tho intermingled reductions on the  
•character ond consequences of that Revolution, fills  
a considerable space m the Memoir, and form., a very  
important part of it. 1  
\ I. Within the body of the Memoir, or referred  
to as an Appendix, are other papers which were  
thought well entitled to tho place they occupy. *H,­  
mongthcin, are, 1. A paper drawn up in tho year 177-1,  
ns “instructions to our delegates in Congress ”  
i hough heretofore in print, it will be new to most  
readers: and will bo regarded by all as tbe inostamplo  
and precise enumerations of British violations that  
had then appeared, or perhaps, that has since been  
presented in a form at once to com tract und so  
complete. 2. a Penal Code, being part of a  
Revised Code of Laws, prepared by appointment of  
the Legislature in Virginia in 1776**ilh a reference  
to tl.o Ilepnbucan form of Government, and to the  
principles of humanity congenial thorewith, aud with  
the improving spirit of the age. Annexed to the se­  
veral article*, nre explanatory nud other remarks of  
the Author, worthy ofbeing preserved by the aid of  
the press. 3. A historical and critical review of the  
repeal of the laws establishing the Church in Vim­  
mn; which was followed by the -act for establishing re­  
licrious freedom-&#x27;’ This act, it is wo’l known, wa&quot;sal­  
  
wnvs it* ny -\ir. Jellcrson to ho onoofhis best efforts  
in tire cause of liberty, to which ho was devoted; and  
it is certainly tho strongest legal barrier that could  
erected agaiust ft connect bn between Church nnd  
State. f.r&gt; fatal in its tendency to tho purity of both.  
I. An elaborato paper concerning (l money Unit  
prepared in the ycoY 1704, and which laid tho founda­  
tion of l.ic system adopted by Congru w for a coinage  
and money of account. For ollr. r particulars, not  
here noted, tho reader is referred tot lie volume itself  
The termination of the Memoir, nt the date men­  
I t!one”, hy the Author, may bn explained by the labo­  
j rio,1« tasks assumed or not declined by him, on his  
return to private life; which, with his groat ago, did

so .compact and so complete M2. A Pe­

the Legislature &#x27; in Virginia in 1776,  
  
with a reference to the Republican form

yPgrlPn,cal execution, the pages before

thus given to the public in so beautiful a  
U &#x27; J . 1. r a  
iiuui.a vuiaue in me vicinity or ms  
own monticello, 111 which ten years ago  
there was not a printing press. Political  
Arena.  
PREFACE.  
The opinion universally entertained of  
the extraordinary abilities of Thomas Jet  
ferson, and the signal evidence given by hi  
country of a profound sense of his patriotic  
services, and of veneration for his memory,  
have induced the Editor, who is both Exe  
cutor and the Legatee of his Manuscript  
papers, to believe that an extensive publi­  
cation from them, would be particularly ac­  
ceptable to tbe American people.  
. The memoir contained in the first volume  
commences with circumstantial notices 01  
his earliest life; and is continued to his ar­  
rival in New York in March, 1799, when  
he entered on the Department of State, ot  
which he had been just appointed Secretary.  
From the aspect of the Memoir, it may  
be presumed that parts of it at least, had  
been wiilten for his own and his family&#x27;  
use only ; and in a style without the finish  
of his revising pen. There is, however,no  
part of it, minute and personal as it may be,  
which the Reader would wish to have been  
passed over by the Editor, whilst not a le w  
parts of that description will, by some, be  
regarded with a particular interest.  
The contents of the memoir, succeeding  
the biographical pages,may be designated as  
follows :  
I. General facts and anecdotes relating  
lo the origin and early stages of the contest  
with Britain.  
II. Historical circumstances relating to  
the Confederation of the Slates.  
- If I. Facts and anecdotes, local and gen­  
eral, preliminary to the Declaration of In­  
dependence.IV. An exfct account of the circumstan­  
ces attending that memorable Act, in its  
preparation and its progress through Con  
gress; with a copy from the original draught,  
in the writing of the Author and the paral  
lei column fn the same hand, shewing the  
alterations made in tbe draught by Con­  
gress. ti. j , v  
Therlejnoir will be&#x27; considered, not a  
little enriched by the Debates in&#x27; Congress,  
on the. great question of Independence, as  
they were taken down by Mr. Jefferson at  
the time, and which though in a compres­  
sed form, present the substance o f what  
passed on that memomble occasion. This  
portiop&#x27;of the work derives peculiar value  
from its perfect authenticity, being all in the  
writing of that distihg rished member of the  
body; from the certainty that this is the  
first disclosure of those debates j and from  
the probability, or rather certainty, that a  
like knowledge of them is not to be expect­  
ed from any otber source. The same re­  
marks are applicable to the debates in the  
same Congress, preserved in the same man­  
ner, on two of the original articles of Con­  
federation. The first is the article fixing  
the late of assessing the quotas of supply to  
the common Treasury ; the second is tbe  
article which declares, that in determining  
questions each Colony should have one vote.  
The debates on both are hot only interest  
ing lb themselves, but curious also in; rela  
iion&#x27; to. (ike discussions of the same . subject  
on subsequent occasions. ;  
V. Views of the connections and trans­  
actions of the United States &quot;witii foreign  
uationi it diforcat periods 5&#x27; pghicalarly a  
  
remonyfdr:thevIriaugnration. The number  
  
uarratrve, with many details, personal and  
  
political, of the causes and early course of  
Uie-Freach Revqfution, as exhibited to the  
observation of the AuthordurTngTsiptov­  
matte residence at Paris. rITie narrative  
with the intermingled reflections, on the?,  
character and consequence; of that Revolu­  
tion, fill a considerable space in the Memoir  
and form a very important part of it.  
VI. Within the body of the Merriirf or  
referred to as an Appendix, are other pa­  
pers which were tho&#x27;t entitled to the placer  
they occupy.. Among them nre, 1. A pa­  
per drawn up in the year 1774 as Instruc­  
tions to our delegates in Congress. Though  
heretofore in print, it will be new to most .  
readers; and will be regarded by alt as the .  
most ample and precise enumeration of the  
British violations that had then appeared,&#x27;  
or, perhaps, that has since ben presented  
in a form at once so compact and so com  
plete. 2. A Penal Code, being part of a &quot;  
Revised CodtY of Laws, prepared by ap- .  
pointment of the Legislature oi&quot; Virginia in  
1775, with reference ;to the Republican forrd  
of Government, to tr)e principles of huma­  
nity congenial therewith, and with the im  
proving spirit of the age. Annexed to die;  
several articles, are! explanatory and other  
remarks of the Author worthy of being pre­  
served by the aid of the press. 3. Ajiis-  
torical and critical review of the repeal of. ,  
the laws establishing Religious freedom.&quot;  
1 his act, it is well known, as always held  
by Mr. Jefferson to be one of his best efforts  
in the cause of liberty to which be was de­  
voted, and it is certainly the strongest legal  
barrier that could be erected against a con  
nection between Church and. State, so fatal  
in its tendency to tiie purity of both. 4. An  
elaborate paper concerning a money Unit,  
prepared in the year 1784, and which laid  
the foundation of the system adopted by  
Congress for a coinage and money of ac­  
count. For other particulars, not here no­  
ted, the reader is referred to the volume  
itself. J  
The termination; of the Memoir, at the  
date mentioned by the Author, may be ex­  
plained by the laborious tasks assumed or  
not declined by him, on his return to pri­  
vate life, which, with his great age, did  
not permit. him to reduce his materials in­  
to a state proper to be embodied in such tv  
work.
