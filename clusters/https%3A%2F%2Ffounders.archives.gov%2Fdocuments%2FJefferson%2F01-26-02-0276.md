 relates to a vessel armed in the port of new York and about to depart from thence, but stopped by order of the Government; and here I beg leave to premise, that, the case supposed in your letter, of a vessel arming merely for her own defence, and to repel unjust aggressions, is not that in question, nor that on which I mean to answer, because, not having yet happened, as far as is known to the Government, I have no instructions on the subject. The case in question is that of a vessel armed, equipped, and manned, in a part of the united States, for the purpose of committing hostilities on nations at peace with the united States.  
As soon as it was perceived that such enterprises would be attempted, orders to prevent them, were dispatched to all the States and ports of the Union. In consequence of these, the Governor of new York, receiving information that a Sloop, heretofore called the Polly, now the Republican, was fitting out, arming, and manning in the port of new  York, for the express, and sole purpose of cruising against certain Nations, with whom we are at peace; that she had taken her guns and ammunition aboard and was on the point of departure, seized the vess

tter of the 5th. instant, which animadverted not merely on the single fact of the granting commissions of war, by one nation, within the territory of another; but on the aggregate of the facts: for it states the Opinion of the President to be “That the arming and equipping vessels in the ports of the United States, to cruise against nations with whom they are at peace, was incompatible with the sovereignty of the United States; that it made them instrumental to the annoyance of those nations, and thereby tended to compromit their peace”—and this opinion is still conceived to be not contrary to the principles of natural law, the usage of nations, the engagements which unite the two people, nor the proclamation of the

to a port, is one act; the equipping a vessel in that port, arming her, manning her, is a different one, and not engaged by any article of the Treaty.  
You think, Sir, that this opinion is also contrary to the law of nature and usage of nations. We are of opinion it is dictated by that law and  usage; and this had been very maturely enquired into before it was adopted as a principle of conduct. But we will not assume the exclusive right of saying what that law and usage is. Let us appeal to enlightened and disinterested Judges. None is more so than Vattel. He says L. 3. §. 104. “Tant qu’un peuple neutre veut jouïr surement de cet état, il doit montrer en toutes choses une exacte impartialité entre ceux qui se font la guerre. Car s’il favorise l’un au prejudice de l’autre, il ne pourra pas se plaindre, quand celui-ci le traitera comme adhérent et associé de son ennemi. Sa neutralité seroit une neutralité frauduleuse, dont personne ne veut être la dupe.—Voyons donc en quoi consiste cette impartialité qu’un peuple neutre doit garder.  
Elle se rapporte uniquement à la guerre, et comprend deux choses. 1°. Ne point donner de secours quand on n’y est pas obligé; ne fournir librement ni troupes, ni armes, ni munitions, ni rien de ce qui sert directement à la guerre. Je dis ne point donner de secours, et non pas en donner egalement; car il seroit absurde qu’un Etat secourût en même tems deux ennemis. Et puis il seroit impossible de le faire avec egalité; les mêmes choses, le même nombre de troupes, la même quantité d’armes, de munitions, &amp;c. fournies en des circonstances differentes, ne forment plus des secours équivalens.” &amp;c. If the neutral power may not, consistent with it’s neutrality, furnish men to either party, for their aid in war, as little can either enrol them in the neutral territory, by the law of nations. Wolf §. 1174. Says “Puisque le droit de lever des Soldats est un droit de majesté, qui ne peut être violé par une nation etrangere, il n’est pas permis de lever des soldats sur le territ

e trés-sévérement.” &amp;c. For I chuse to refer you to the passage, rather than follow it thro’ all its developments. The testimony of these, and other writers, on the law and usage of nations, with your own just reflections on them, will satisfy you that the united States in prohibiting all the belligerent powers from equipping, arming, and manning vessels of war in their ports, have exercised a right, and a duty with justice, and with great moderation. By our treaties with several of the belligerent powers, which are a part of the laws of our land, we have established a State of peace with them. But without appealing to treaties, we are at peace with them all by the law of nature. For by nature’s law, man is at peace with  man, till some aggression is committed, which, by the same law, authorizes one to destroy another as his enemy. For our citizens then, to commit murders and depredations on the members of nations at peace with us, to combine to do it, appeared to the Executive, and to those whom they consulted, as much against the laws of the land, as to murder or rob, or combine to murder or rob it’s own citizens, and as much to require punishment, if done within their limits, where they have a territorial jurisdiction, or on the high seas, where they have a personal jurisdiction, that is to say, one which reaches their own citizens only, this being an appropriate part of each nation on an element where all have a common jurisdiction. So say our laws as we understand them ourselves. To them the appeal is made. And whether we have construed them well or ill, the constitutional Judges will decide. Till that decision shall be obtained, the Government of the United States must pursue what they think right with firmness, as is their duty. On the first attempt that was made the President was desirous of involving in the censures of the law, as few as might be. Such of the individuals only therefore as were citizens of the United States, were singled out for prosecution. But this second attempt being after full knowledge of what had been done on the first, and indicating a disposition to go on in opposition to the laws, they are to take their course against all persons concerned, whether Citizens, or aliens; the latter, while within our Jurisdiction and enjoying the protection of the laws, being bound to obedience to them, and to avoid disturbances of our peace within, or acts which would commit it without, equally as Citizens are.

In the case alluded to, Mr. Genet had asserted the right of fit-  
ting out privateers in the American ports, and of manning them  
with American citizens, in order to cruise against nations with  
whom America was at peace. In reasoning against this extra-  
vagant claim, the then secretary of state, in his letter of the 17th  
of June, 1793, says: ** For our citizens then to commit murders  
‘* and depredations on the members of nations at peace with us,  
** or to combine to do it, appeared to the executive and to those  
‘‘ whom they consulted, as much against the laws of the land,  
**as to murder or rob, or combine to murder or rob, its own

‘ their limits, where they have a territorial jurisdiction, or on

As the opinion of the President is stated in the communi-

“The arming and equipping vessels in the ports of the United

compatible with the sovereignty of the United States; it makes them  
instrumental to the annoyance of those nations, and thereby tends to
