[New York, December 21, 1801]  
  
The next most prominent feature in the Message, is the proposal to abandon at once all the internal revenue of the country. The motives avowed for this astonishing scheme, are that “there is reasonable ground of confidence that this part of the revenue may now be safely dispensed with—that the remaining sources will be sufficient to provide for the support of government, to pay the interest of the public debt, and to discharge the principal in shorter periods than the laws or the general expectation had contemplated—and that though wars and untoward events might change this prospect of things, and call for expences which the impost could not meet—yet that sound principles would not justify our taxing the industry of our fellow citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to happen we know not when, and which might not perhaps happen but from the temptations offered by that treasure.”  
If we allow these to be more than ostensible motives, we shall be driven to ascribe this conduct to a deficiency of intellect, and to an ignorance of our financial arrangements, greater than could have been suspected: if but ostensible, it is then impossible to trace the suggestion to any other source than the culpable desire of gaining or securing popularity at an immediate expence of public utility, equivalent, on a pecuniary scale to a million of dollars annually; and at the greater expence of a very serious invasion of our system of public credit.  
That these at least, are the certain consequences of the measure, shall be demonstrated by arguments which are believed to be unanswerable.  
To do this the more effectually, it is necessary to premise, that some of the revenues now proposed to be relinquished, are with every solemnity of law pledged for paying the interest and redeeming the principal of our public debt, foreign and domestic. As to the interest, and such parts of the principal, as by the original constitution of the debt, are payable by annual instalments, the appropriation is absolute. As to the residue it is qualified. On the 3d of March 1795, was passed an act of Congress which forms a main pillar in the fabric of our public credit—which, maturing and perfecting the establishment of a Sinking Fund, endeavors with peculiar solicitude to render it adequate, effectual and inviolable: by the 8th section of this act it is provided, “That all surplusses of the revenue, which shall remain at the end of any year, and which at the next session of Congress shall not be otherwise appropriated or reserved by law, shall ipso facto become a part of the Sinking Fund.” This fund, by other provisions of the same act, is vested in commissioners in trust, to be applied to the redemption of the debt, by reimbursement or by purchase, until the whole shall be extinguished: and the faith of the United States is expressly engaged, that the monies which are to constitute the fund shall inviolably remain so appropriated and vested, until the redemption of the debt shall be completely effected.  
  
The simple statement of these provisions goes far to confirm the character which we have given to the proposition. But a distinct examination of the reasons by which it is supported, will, when taken in connection with those provisions, place beyond doubt, its absurd and pernicious tendency.  
The first inducement offered for relinquishing the internal revenue, is a reasonable ground of confidence that it may safely be dispensed with.  
When it is considered that we are in the very crisis of an important change of situation; passing from a state in which neutrality had procured to our commerce and to the revenue depending on it, a great artificial increase—with good reason to look for a diminution, and without satisfactory data to enable us to fix the extent of this dimunition: can any thing be more rash, more empirical, than voluntarily to abandon a valuable and growing branch of income of which we are already in possession? Can it be said that merely “a reasonable ground of confidence” is a sufficient warrant for so important a surrender? Surely we ought to have been told that there was at least a moral certainty of the fact. But even this would not have been deemed enough by a prudent statesman. Nothing less than experimental certainty ought to have been relied upon. There was no pressure of circumstances making it proper to precipitate the measure. It would have been ridiculous to pretend that the burden is so heavy as to demand immediate relief, and without this incentive to relinquishment, experience ought undoubtedly to have been taken as the only fit and sure guide.  
Not only is it problematical what the present duties on imports will, for succeeding years produce; but it is in a degree questionable, whether it may not be found necessary to reduce the rates. That they are now high when compared with the commercial capital of our country is not to be denied, and whether they may not be found too high for a beneficial course of our trade, is yet to be decided by experiment. The latter augmentations of the rates of duty, were made at times and under circumstances in the situations of this and of other countries, which forbid us to regard past experience as conclusive on the point.  
  
Should it be said in answer, that the revenues can hereafter be renewed, if on trial it shall be found that they have been prematurely abandoned, the decisive reply is, that this is to invert the natural order of just reasoning. Were it now the question, whether such revenues should be created in anticipation of a possible deficiency, the correct answer would be, let experiment first ascertain the necessity: as they already exist, on a question to abolish them, the answer equally ought to be, let experience first shew them to be unnecessary.  
But how can they be unnecessary? Let us grant that the remaining sources will be equal to the purposes enumerated in the Message, does it follow that it will not still be wise to retain the internal revenue? Is it not desirable that government should have it in its power to discharge the debt faster than may have been contemplated? Is not this a felicity in our situation which ought to be improved? A precious item in the public fortune which ought not rashly to be squandered? But it is not even true that the laws have exclusively contemplated a definite period for the ultimate redemption of the entire debt. They have only made a determinate provision for its extinguishment, at all events, within a given term of years; but, anxious to shorten the period, they, in the clause which has been quoted respecting the surplusses of revenue, have made an auxiliary provision for the purpose of abridging that term. The Message, while it goes to impair the efficacy of the principal provision, proposes formally to renounce the auxiliary, and thus to disappoint the provident care of the laws to accelerate the discharge of the debt.  
How reconcileable is this with the wanton and unjust clamours heretofore vented against those who projected and established our present system of public credit; charging them with a design to perpetuate the debt under the pretext that a public debt was a public blessing? It is not to be forgotten, that in these clamours Mr. Jefferson liberally participated! Now, it seems, the tone is entirely changed. The past administrations who had so long been calumniated by the imputation of that pernicious design, are of a sudden discovered to have done too much for the speedy discharge of the debt, and its duration is to be prolonged by throwing away a part of the fund destined for its prompt redemption. Wonderful union of consistency and wisdom!  
Before we yield our approbation to the proposal, we ought to have a guarrantee for the continuance of our peace, long enough to give effect to the leisurely opperation of that residue of the fund, which it is intended to retain: else war, which never fails to bring with it an accumulation of debt, may intervene, and we may then rapidly hasten to that period when the exigencies of government may render it necessary to appropriate too large a portion of the earnings of labor. To guard against so unfortunate a result, towards which there is always too great a tendency in the affairs of nations, our past administrations have evinced a deep foresight, and exercised a truly patriotic care. Unhappy will it be, if any succeeding projector shall be permitted to frustrate their salutary plan.  
It has been seen that the Message anticipates and attempts to answer objections to the dereliction of revenue: the answer is, that “sound principles will not permit us to tax the industry of our citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to happen we know not when, and which might not perhaps happen but for the temptations offered by that treasure.” Unless, however, the accumulation of treasure be the necessary consequence of retaining the revenue, this argument is evidently futile. But the President had only to open our statute book to learn, that this consequence is chimerical. All future surpluses of revenue, being already eventually appropriated to the discharge of the public debt, it follows that till the whole debt shall have been extinguished, there could be no accumulation of treasure—no spoil from that source to tempt the rapacity of a greedy invader. Here we fix the charge of ignorance of our financial arrangements: to which there can be no alternative but a deliberate design to delude the people. Between the two, let the worshippers of the Idol make their option.

HE rext moft prominent feature in the  
  
: Meffage, is the propofal to abandon at  
once all the internal revenue of the country.  
‘The motives avowed for this aftonif ning  
icheme, are that ** there is rea/onalie ground  
of confidence that this part of the revenue may  
now be fafely difpenfed with—that the re-  
maining fources will be fufficient to provide  
tor the fupport of government, to pay the in-  
tere/t of the public debt, and to d7/charge the  
principat in fhorter periods than the daws or  
the general expectation had contemplated—-  
and that though wars and untoward events  
might change this profpeét of things, and call  
for expences which the impoff could not  
mect—yet that found principles would not  
julify our taxing the induftry of our fellow  
citizens to accumulate treafure for wars to  
happen we know not when, and which might  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
not perhaps happen but trom the temptations  
offered by that treafure.”’  
  
If we allow tliefe to be more than oftenfible  
motives, we thal! be driven to afcribe this con-  
duét to a deficiency of intelleét, and to aa ig-  
norance of our financial arrang@ments, greater  
than could have been fufpeéted : if but often-  
fible, it is then impofhble to trace the fuggef-  
tion to any other fource than the culpable  
defire of gaining or fecuring popularity at an  
immediate expence of public utility, equiva-

Todo this the more effectually, it is necef-

the intereft, and fuch parts of the prince tpal,  
as by the original confi tution of the debt, are  
payable by annual inftalments, the a; ppropris a-  
tion is abfolute. As to the refidue it 1S  
  
ualified. On the 9d of March 1795, was  
Pp: affed an aét of Congrefs which tor: ms a main  
pillar in the fabric of our public credit—  
which, maturing and perfecting the eftablith-  
ment ial a Sinking i und, endeavors with  
peculiar folicitude to render it ac lequate, et-  
feéiual and inviolable: by the 8th feétion of  
this act it is proe ided, ** That a// Surpliufe 5 ot  
  
the revenue, which fhall remain at the ‘end of  
  
any year, and which at the next  
Congrefs fhall not be otherwife appropriated  
or referved by law, fhall ipfo facto become a  
part of the Sinking Fund.” ‘This fund, by  
other provifions of the fame aét, is z efte ed in  
commiffioners in ¢truft, to be applied to  
the redemption of the debt, by re:mburfe-  
ment or oy purchafe, until the whole fhall be

States is exprefsly engaged, that the monies  
which are to conttitute the fund fhall invio-  
lably remain fo appropriated and veited, until  
the redemption of the debt fhall be completely  
effected.  
  
The fimple flatement of thefe provifions  
goes far to confirm the charaéter which we  
bave giventothe propofition. Buta diftinét  
examination of the reafons by which it 1s  
jupported, will, when taken in connection

Not only is it proble matical what the pref-  
¢ duties on impofts will, tor iucceeding years  
produce ; but it is ina degree queiti nable, |  
whether it may not be tound neceilary to |  
reduce the rates. ‘That they  
when compared with the c  
of our country is not to be nd wheth-  
er they may not be found too high for a ben-

by experiment. ‘he latter augmentations of  
the rates of duty, were made at times and un-

Should it be faid in an{wer, that the reve-

have exclufively contemplated a definite pe-  
riod for the ultimate redemption of the en-  
tire debt. They have only made a determi-  
nate provifion for its extinguifhment, at all  
events, within a given term of years ; but,  
anxious to fhorten the period, they, in the  
claufe which has been quoted refpeéling the  
furpluffes of revenne,have made an auxiliary  
provifion for the purpofe of abridging that

The next most prominent feature in the mes-  
sage, is the proposal to abandon at on&lt;e aii the in-  
ternal revenue of the country. The motives  
avowed for this astonishing scheme, are, that  
“there is reasonable ground of confidence that this  
part of the revenue may now be safely dispensed  
with....that the remaining sources will be sufficient  
to provide for the support of government, to pay the  
interest of the public debt, and to discharge the princt-  
pal in shorter periods, than the d:ws or the general  
expectation had contemplated...and that, though wars  
and untoward events might change this prospect  
  
| of things, and call for expenses, which the impost  
  
~e  
  
  
  
  
  
could not meet....yet that sound principles would  
not justify our taxing the industry of our fellow  
citizens, to accumulate treasure for wars to happen  
we know not when, and which might not perhaps  
happen, but from the temptations offered by that  
treasure.”’  
  
If we allow these to be more than ostensible  
motives, we shall be driven to ascribe this conduct  
to a deficiency of intellect, and toan ignorance ofour  
financial arrangements, greater than could have  
been suspected: if but ostensible, it is then impos-  
sible to trace the suggestion to any other source,  
than the culpable desire of gaining or securing po-  
pularity, at an immediate expense of public utility,  
equivalent, on a pecuniary scale, to a million of  
dollars annually ; and at the greater expense of a  
very serious innovation of our system of public  
credit.  
  
That these, at least, are the certain consequences  
of the measure, shall be demonstrated by argu-  
ments, which are believed to be unanswerable.  
  
To do this the more effectually, it is necessary  
to premise, that some of the revenues, now propos-  
ed to be relinquished, are, with every solemnity of  
law, pledged for paying the interest and redeeming  
the principal of our public debt, foreign and do-  
mestic. As to the interest, and such parts of the  
principal, as, by the original constitution of the  
debt, are payable by annual instalments, the appro-  
priation is absolute. As tothe residue, it is quali-  
fied. On the third of March, 1795, was passed an  
act of congress, which forms a main pillar in the  
fabric of our public credit....which, maturing and  
perfecting the establishment of a sinking fund, en-  
deavours, with peculiar solicitude, to render it  
adequate, effectual, and inviolable. By the eighth  
section of this act, it is provided, “ That al/ sur-  
plusses of the revenue, which shall remain at the  
end of any year, and which, at the next session of  
congress, shall not be otherwise appropriated or  
reserved by law, shall, ipso facto, become a part of  
the sinking fund.&quot;’ ‘This fund, by other provisions  
of the same act, is vested in commissioners, /n trust,  
te be applied to the redemption of the debt, by  
reimbursement or by purchase, until the whole  
shall be extinguished: and the faith of the United  
States is expressly engaged, that the monies,  
which are to constitute the fund, shall inviolably  
remain so appropriated and vested, until the re-  
demption of the debt shall be completely effected.  
  
The simple statement of these provisions goes  
far to confirm the character, which we have given  
to the proposition. But a distinct examination of  
the reasons, by which it is supported, will, when  
taken in connexion with those provisions, place  
beyond doubt, its absurd and pernicious tendency.  
  
The first inducement offered for relinquishing  
the internal revenue, is a reasonable ground of confi-  
dence that it may safely be dispensed with.  
  
When it is considered that we are in the very  
crisis of an important change of situation ; passing  
from a state, in which neutrality had procured to  
our commerce, and to the revenue depending on it,  
a great artificial increase....with good reason to  
look for a diminution, and without satisfactory  
data, to enable us to fix the extent of this diminu-  
tion: can any thing be more rash, more empirical,  
than voluntarily to abandon a valuable and grow-  
ing branch of income, of which we are already in  
possession? Can it be said, that merely “ @ rea-  
sonable ground of confidence” is a sufficient warrant  
for so important a surrender? Surely we ought  
to have been told, that there was at least a moral  
certainty of the fact. But even this would not have  
been deemed enough by .a prudent statesman.  
Nothing less than experimental certainty ought to  
have been relied upon. There was no pressure of  
circumstances making it proper to precipitate the  
  
measure. It would have been ridiculous to pre-  
tend that the burden is so heavy as to and im-  
mediate relief, and, without this inceftive to relin-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
quishment experience ought undoubtedly to have  
been taken, as the only fit and sure guide.  
  
Not only is it problematical what the present  
duties on imposts, will, for succeeding years, pro-  
duce}; but it is in a degree questionable, whether  
it may not be found necessary to reduce the rates.  
That they are now high, when compared with the  
commercial capital of our country, is not to be  
denied, and whether they may not be found too  
high for a beneficial course of our trade, is yet to  
be decided by experiment. The latter angmenta-  
tions of the rates of duty, were made at times,  
and under circumstances, in the situations of this  
and other countries, which forbid us to regard past  
experience as conclusive on the point.  
  
Should it be said, in answer, that the revenues  
can hereafter be renewed, if, on trial, it shall be  
found that they have been prematurely abandoned,  
the decisive reply is, that this is to invert the na-  
tural order of just reasoning, Were it now the  
question, whether such revenues should be created,  
in anticipation of a possible deficiency, the correct  
answer would be, let experiment first ascertain  
the necessity : as they already exist, op a question  
to abolish &#x27;them, the answer equally ought to be,  
let experience first shew them to be unnecessary.  
  
But how can they be unnecessary? Let us  
grant that the remaining sources will be equal to  
the purposes enumerated in the message, does it  
follow that it will not still be wise to retain the in-  
ternal revenue? Is it not desirable that govern-  
ment should have it in its power to discharge the  
debt faster than may have been contemplated? Is  
not this a felicity in our situation, which ought to  
be improved? A precious item in the public for-  
tune, which ought not rashly to be squandered ?  
But it is not even true that the laws have exclu-  
sively contemplated a definite period, for the ulti-  
mate redemption of the entire debt. They have  
only made a determinate provision for its extin-  
guishment, at all events, within a given term of  
years: but, anxious to shorten the period, they, in  
the clause, which has been quoted, respecting the  
surplusses of revenue, have made an auxiliary pro-  
vision for the purpose of abridging that term. The  
message, while it goes to impair the efficacy of the  
principal provision, proposes formally to renounce  
the auxiliary, and thus to disappoint the provident  
care of the laws to accelerate the discharge of the  
debt.  
  
How reconcileable is this with the wanton and  
unjust clamours heretofore vented against those,  
who projected and established our present system  
of public credit; charging them with a design to  
perpetuate the debt, under the pretext that a pud-  
lic debt was a public blessing! It is not to be forgot-  
ten, that in these clamours Mr. Jefierson liberally  
participated ! Now, it seems, the tone is entirely  
changed. The past administrations, who had so  
long been calumniated by the imputation of that  
pernicious design, are, of a sudden, discovered to  
have done too much for the speedy discharge of the  
debt, and its duration is to be prolonged, by throw-  
ing away a part of the fund destined for its prompt  
redemption...- Wonderful union of consistency and  
wisdom !  
  
Before we yield our approbation to the proposal,  
we ought to have a guarantee for the continuance  
of our peace, long enough to give effect to the lei-  
surely operation of that residue of the fund, which  
it is intended to retain: else war, which never fails  
to bring with it an accumulation of debt, may in-  
tervene, and we may then rapidly hasten to that  
period, when the exigencies of government may  
render it necessary to appropriate tgo large a  
portion of the earnings of labour. To Reard against  
so unfortunate a result, towards which there is al-  
ways fee crest s tendency, in the affairs of nations,  
our past administrations have evinced a deep fore-  
sight, and exercised a truly patriotic care. Unhap-  
  
  
  
THE PORT FOLIO.  
  
py will it be, if any succeeding projector shall be  
permitted to frustrate their salutary plan.  
  
It has been seen that the message anticipates,  
and attempts to answer objections to the derelic-  
tion of revenue: the answer is, that “ sound prin-  
ciples will not permit us to tax the industry of our  
citizens, to accumulate treasure for wars to hap-  
pen we know not when, and which might not per-  
haps happen, but for the temptations offered by  
that treasure.”’ Unless, however, the accumulation  
of treasure be the necessary consequence of retain-  
ing the revenue, this argument is evidently futile.  
But the president had only to open our statute  
book to learn, that this consequence is chimerical.  
All future surplusses of revenue, being already  
eventually appropriated to the discharge of the  
public debt, it follows, that, till the whole debt  
shall have been extinguished, there could be no  
accumulation of treasure....no spoil from that source,  
to tempt the rapacity of a greedy invader. Here  
we fix the charge of ignorance of our financial ar-  
rangements: to which there can be no alternative,  
but a deliberate design to delude the people. Be-  
tween the two, let the worshippers of the idol make  
their option.

THE next mod prominent feature in the  
Melfjge. is the propofr! to abandon at once all  
ihe internal revenue of the country. The mo  
lives avowed for this aft#nifhing fcheme are,  
that “ there Is reafo table ground of confidence that  
this part of the revene may now be Hfely dif.  
penfed with—that the remaining fources will  
be ludicient to provide fertile fnpport of gov.  
eminent, to pay the interejl of the public debt,  
and to dtfeharge the principal in fh irter periods  
than the laws or the general expectation ha i con­

fedow citizens in accumulate treafure for w irs to  
happen we know’not when, and which might  
not perhaps happen but from the temptations of­  
fered by that treafure ’*  
If we allow ihcie to be more than odenfib&#x27;e  
motives, we lhall be driven to aferibe this con  
dtud to a deficiency of intellcft, and to an ig  
rorance of our financial arrangements, greater  
than could have neeo fitfpeded : if but oAenhble,  
it is then impoffible to trace the fuggeftinn to  
any oilier fource than the culpable defire of  
gaining orfeeuring populirity at an immediate  
expen e of public u iUty, equivalent, on a pe­  
cuniary fcale to a million of dollars annually ;  
and the greater expence of a very ferious inva­  
fion of our fydem of public credit.  
That thefe at lead, are the certain confequen.  
ces of the meafure, (hail be demvnftrated by ar­  
guments which are believed to be unanfwer­  
  
able.  
To do this the more efFedlu dly, it is necefTa  
ry to premife, that fome ol the revenues now  
piopofed to be relinqu fhed, are with every fo  
lenmity of law pledged for paying the intereft  
and redeeming the principal of our public debt  
foreign and domeftic. As to the intere&#x27;f, and  
fuch parts of the principal, as by the original  
conftitution of the debt, are payable by annual  
inftalments, the appropriation is abfolute. As  
to the refidue it is qualified. On the $d of  
Match 1795, was palfed an adl of Congrefs  
which forms a main pillar in the fabric of our  
public debt—which, maturing and p*rfedling  
the eftablifhment of a Sinking Fund, endeavors  
with peculiar folicitude to render it adequate,  
effedtusl and inviolab&#x27;e ; by the 8;h fedlion of  
this adl it is provided. “ That allfurphtffes of the  
revenue, which Jhall remain at the end of any  
year, and which at the next feflion of C »ngrefs  
fli ill not be otherwife appropriated or referred

the redemption of the debt ihall be completely  
effeded.  
The ilmple ftatement or thefe prov&#x27;fions goes  
far to confirm thecharad r whirl* vebavegiv.  
en «o the propofldon. But a diiiii d examination  
of the reafons by which it is fupportech will,  
when taken in connedion widi thofe provifi ms,  
| place beyond doubt, its abfurd and pernicious  
! tendency.  
The Hrll inducement offered for relinqu’fh­  
! ing the internal revenue, is a reafnable ground  
j of confidence that it may f.tfely be Jifpenf.d  
i wi&#x27;h  
  
When it is cor.fi Jered that we are in the very  
crifis of an important change of fituation, paffi  
ing from a ftate in which neutrality hid pro*  
cured to our c mmcrce, and to the tevenuef  
depending on it, a great artificial incre»fe­  
with good reafon to lo k for a diminution, aod  
without fatisfa&lt;ft ry data to enable u . to fix the  
extent of ihis dimi *ution : can any thin^ be  
more ra(h, more empirical, than voluntarily to  
abandon a valuable and growing brunch of in­  
ron.e of which we are already in pofT ffion ?  
Can it be faid that merely “ a rcajonahle ground  
of confidence” is a Efficient warrant for f &gt; im­  
portant a furrender ? Surely we ought to h ive  
been told that there was at lead a moral cer­  
tainty of the fad. But even this would not  
j have been deemed enough by a prudent ftatef­  
man. Nothing !ef$ than experimental certainty  
ought to have I ecn relied upon.—There was  
no preflure of cifiumftanees miking it proper  
to precipitate the meafure. — It w. ulJ h vebeel  
lidiculous to prete d that the burden is fo hei.  
vy as to denriarrd ’immediate relief,and without  
th-s incentive to relinquifhrnent expei ience *&gt;h cht  
undoubtedly M have been taken as the only fit  
and fure guide.  
Not only is it problematical what the prefent  
duties on impofts will, for fucceeding years,  
produce ; but d is in a deg&#x27;ee quefti* nable,  
wh:th:r it may not be found necefT ry to ieduce  
tbe rates. I hat they a»e now high when com­  
pared with the commercial cap:ul of our coun­  
try as not u be denied, and whet er they m.*y  
not be found too b&#x27;.gh fur a beneficial cuurfe of  
our trade, is yet to be d Tide l by experiment.  
1 he ia ter augmentations of the rates of du y,  
were made at times and un ler ci&gt;c Jinftanccs in  
the lituatir.ns of this and of other countries*  
which io;bid us to regard paft experience as con,  
cluuve on tke p inr.  
Should it be Lid in arsfwer, th at the revenues  
can hereafter be re newed, if on trial it {hall be  
found thry have bee i prematurely abandoned,  
the decilive reply is, that this is to invert the  
natural order »&gt;t reafoning. W re it now the  
queftion, whether Inch revenues fhould be cre­  
ated in anticipation of a poffible deficiency, the  
correct anfwcr would be, let jexperi went firft  
anlwer the necefiity : as they already cxift, oa  
a queftion to akolith them, the anlwer equally  
ought to be, let experience firft (hew them to be  
unneceffary.  
But how can they be unne.&#x27;elfa&#x27;y ? Let tts  
grunt that the remaining fources will be equal  
to the purpofes enom-ri’ed in the Meflagc,  
docs it follow that it will not ft 11 be wi e to  
retain the internal revenue ? fs i’ not defirable  
that government (hould have it iu i &gt; power to  
dilcharge the debt fafter than my have been  
contemplated ? Is not th*s a felic ty in our fitu.  
ation which ought to be wnpioveJ ? A pre­  
cious item in the public fortune which ought  
not rafhly to b- fquandered ? But it i&gt; not even  
true that the luv&gt; have exclufive’y contempla.  
ted a definitive period for the alt mate re ie«p.  
turn of the en ire debt. They h tve only mads  
a determinate provilion for its exti iguilhmenr,  
at all events, within agivei term of years i  
but. anxious to fhort n the period, they, in the  
claufe which h is been quoted refpei ng tha  
furplufles of revenue have made an auxiliary  
provilion for the purpofe of a &gt;ridg ng that term.  
The Meffige, while it goes to impair the effica­  
cy of the principal prov.fi on, propofes formally  
to renounce the auxiliary, and thus to difap.  
point the provident care of the laws to acce ler.  
ate the difeharge of the debt.  
How reconcilable is this with the wanton  
and unjnft clamours heretofore vented again?  
thofe who prnj-‘&lt;fted a id eftabliffied our prefent  
fvfte-n of public credit ; charging them with a  
  
criminal defign to perpetutte the debt, under  
the pretext that a public debt war a tub lie blefu.g f  
Ir is n*t forgotten that in thefe clamours Mr  
Jefferfon liberally participated ! Now.i fe;rm,  
the lone is entirely changed. The pifl ^dmin­  
iliration who had fo loa^ been calumniated by  
the imputation of the pernicious deflgn, ^re of  
a udden difeoveted to have done too much for  
the fpeedy difeharge of the debt, and its dura,  
tion is to be prolonged by throwing away a part  
of the fund defined for «ts redemption —Won­  
derful union of conlHeory md wifj »,n !  
Before we yield onr approbation to the pro- -  
poi&#x27;j 1, we ought to have a goarant e for the  
conti uance of our peace, 1 &gt;ng enough to give  
eiF*ct to the leiiureir op tati n of that reftdue  
of the fund whi* h it h i tfe ide J t &gt; ter ail : elfe  
war, wh.ch never la*s to bting n th it ah accu­

ft refult, to wards which there is always too great !  
a tendency in the affairs of nations, our pad ad. I  
minifirati. ns have evinced a deep firelight,and  
exercihd a truly patiiot-c care. Unhappy will  
it be, if any fuccetding projector fhall be per  
mi ted tofulfrate their falurary plan.  
It has b«en feeo, ihat the Melfge anticipates  
and at emptN to anfwer objects us to the dite­  
l:&lt;ffion of revenue : it is faid, that,“ found prin­  
ciples will not pernrvt us to tax the indulVy of J  
our citizen* to accumulate tre.ifuie for wars to  
happen we know not when, and which might  
not p^htps happen but for the temptations  
offered by that treafare.” Unlefs, however,  
the accumulation of tteafure be the necelTary c*n­  
lequence of retaining the revenue,this argument  
is evidently futile. But the Prefident had only  
to ope* our flatute book to learn, that this con­  
ftquence is chimerical. All future furpluffes i  
of revenue, being already eventually appropri  
ated to the difeharge of the public debts, it  
fol’ows that till the whole debt (hall have been  
extinguished, there could be no accumulation of  
treafure—no fpoil from that fource to tempt the  
rapacity of a greedy invader. Here we fix the  
charge of ignorance of our financial arrange­  
ments: to which there can be no alternative  
hut a deliberate defign to delude the people.  
Bet ween the two let the worfhippers of the Idol  
make their opinion.
