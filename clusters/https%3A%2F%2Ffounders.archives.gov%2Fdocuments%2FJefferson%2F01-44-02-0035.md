As connected with this subject, the following remarks on the  
CONSTRUCTION OF CITIES deserve serious attention in the United  
States. The ideas, and the facts on which they are founded, are  
perfectly correct, and itis to be much regretted, that an atten-  
tion to wealth, instead of the public health, should operate to  
prevent the general adoption of the plan suggested.  
  
Extract of a letter from Thomas Fefferson, to William C. C.  
Claiborne, governor of Orleans territory, dated Washington,  
Fuly 7th, 1804.  
  
“ The position of New Orleans certainly destines it to be the  
greatest city the world has ever seen. There is no spot on the  
globe to which the produce of so great an extent of fertile coun-  
try must necessarily come: it is three times greater than that on  
the eastern side of the Alleghany, which is to be divided among  
all the sea-port towns of the Atlantic states. There is also no  
spot where yellow fever is so much to be apprehended. In the  
middle and northern parts of Europe, where the sun rarely  
shines, they can safely build cities in solid blocks without gene-  
rating disease. But under the cloudless skies of America, where  
there is so constant an accumulation of heat, men cannot be piled  
upon one another with impunity. Accordingly we find this dis-  
ease confined to the solid built parts of our towns, and the parts  
on the water side, where there is much matter for putrefaction,  
rarely extending into the thin parts of the town, and never into the  
country, In these latter places it cannot be communicated ; in  
order to catch it you must go into the local atmosphere where it  
prevails. Is not this then a strong indication that we ought not  
to contend with the laws of nature, but should decide at once  
  
that all our cities shall be thin built? You will perhaps remem- ~  
  
ber, that in 1793, yourself, the present governor Harrison, and  
some other young gentlemen, dining with me in Philadelphia,  
the then late yellow fever being the subject of conversation, and  
its incommunicability in the country, I observed that in building

of the Ohio, he laid it off on this plan. As it is probable New  
Orleans must be very soon enlarged, I enclose the same plan for  
consideration. Ihave great confidence that howsoever the yel-  
low fever may prevail in the old part of the town, it would not  
be communicable in that part which should be built on this plan ;  
because this would be all like the thin built parts of our towns,  
where experience has taught us, that a person may carvy it after  
catching it in its local region, but can never communicate it out  
of that. Having very sincerely at heart that the prosperity of  
New Orleans should be unchecked, and great faith, founded as  
I think in experience, of the effect of this mode of building  
against a disease which is such a scourge to our close built cities,  
I could not deny myself the communication of the plan, leaving  
it to you to bring it into real existence, if those more interested  
should think as favourably of it as Ido. For beauty, pleasure,  
and convenience, it will certainly be eminent.”
