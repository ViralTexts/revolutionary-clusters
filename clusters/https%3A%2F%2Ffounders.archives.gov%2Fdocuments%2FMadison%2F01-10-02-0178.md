[22 November 1787]  
Among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments, never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail therefore to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice and confusion introduced into the public councils, have in truth been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have every where perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the American constitutions on the popular models, both antient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side as was wished and expected. Complaints are every where heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty; that our governments are too unstable; that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties; and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice, and the rights of the minor party; but by the superior force of an interested and over-bearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labour, have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice, with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administration.  
By a faction I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.  
There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: The one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.  
There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: The one by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.  
  
It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it is worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction, what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be a less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.  
The second expedient is as impracticable, as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results: And from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.  
The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them every where brought in

ion as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have in turn divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other, than to co-operate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions, and excite their most violent conflicts. But the most common and durable source of factions, has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold, and those who are without property, have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a monied interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of government.  
No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause; because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men, are unfit to be both judges and parties, at the same time; yet, what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens; and what are the different classes of legislators, but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side, and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are and must be themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes; and probably by neither, with a sole regard to justice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property, is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality, yet there is perhaps no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party, to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling with which they over-burden the inferior number, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.  
It is in vain to say, that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm: Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all, without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another, or the good of the whole.  
The inference to which we are brought, is, that the causes of faction cannot be removed; and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects.  
If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote: It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government on the other hand enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest, both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good, and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our enquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great desideratum, by which alone this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.  
By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time, must be prevented; or the majority, having such co-existent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together; that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.  
From this view of the subject, it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society, consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert results from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party, or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is, that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed, that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized, and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.  
A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure, and the efficacy which it must derive from the union.  
The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic, are first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.  
  
The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice, will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good, than if pronounced by the people themselves convened for the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests of the people. The

e first place it is to be remarked, that however small the republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the constituents, and being proportionally greatest in the small republic, it follows, that if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.  
In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practise with success the vicious arts, by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre on men who possess the most attractive merit, and the most diffusive and established characters.  
It must be confessed, that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniencies will be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the representative too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects. The federal constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the state legislatures.  
The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican, than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former, than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found

ion. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked, that where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonourable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust, in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary.  
Hence it clearly appears, that the same advantage, which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic—is enjoyed by the union over the states composing it. Does this advantage consist in the substitutio

? It will not be denied, that the representation of the union will be most likely to possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal degree does the encreased variety of parties, comprised within the union, encrease this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the union gives it the most palpable advantage.  
The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular states, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other states: A religious sect, may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it, must secure the national councils against any danger from that source: A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the union, than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire state.  
In the extent and proper structure of the union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride, we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit, and supporting the character of federalists.

“ By a faction I understand a

“ The itiferenee to which we are  
brought is, that the causes of faction  
cannot be removed, and that relief  
is only to he sought in the means of  
eonti oiling its effects. If a faction  
consists of less than a majority, re­

principle which enables the m jori

THE SOUTHERN PRESS.  
WASHINGTON CITY.  
MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1850.  
The Union.  
u No Constitution,&quot; said John rakdolrh,u over  
accomplished the object of its founders.&quot; Tho  
  
results ot our present system ot Government,  
wlion compared witli the intentions of those  
who formed it, afford a striking conformation of  
Randolph&#x27;s remark. And we are now able to  
perceive the fallacy of many of the reasons originally  
advanced in its favor. In the tcutb  
number of the Federalist, written by Mr. Madison,  
we find the following :  
No man is allowed to be a judge in his own  
cause; because his interest would certainly bias  
his iudirment. and, not improbably, corrupt Ins  
  
integrity. With equal, nay, with greater reason  
a body of men are unfit to be both judges and  
parties, at the same tiuie; yet, what are many of  
the most important acts of legisation, but so  
many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning  
the rights of single persons, but concerning  
the rights of large bodies of cititens ? and what  
are the different classes of legislators, but advocates  
and parties to the causes which they determine  
? Is a law proposed concerning private  
debts ? It is a question to which the creditors  
arc parties on one side, and the debtors on the  
other. Justice ought to hold the balance between  
them. Yet the parties are, and must be,  
themselves the judges; and the most numerous  
party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction,  
must bo expected to prevail. Shall domestic  
manufactures be encouraged, and in what  
degree, by restrictions 011 foreign manufactures ?  
are questions which would be differently decided  
by the landed and the manufacturing classes;  
and probably by neither with a sole regard to  
justice and the public good. The apportionment  
of t .xes, on the various descriptions of  
property, is an act which seems to require the  
most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps,  
no legislative act in which greater opportunity  
nrof temptation are &quot;iven ton predominant Dart v.  
  
|- o ^ a ^ 4 / &#x27; I  
to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling  
with which they over-burden the inferior  
number, is u shilling saved to their own pockets.  
Il is in vain to say, that enlightened statesmen  
will be able to adjust these clashing interests,  
and render them all subservient to the public  
good. Enlightened statesmen will not always  
be at the helm: nor, in many cases, can  
such an adjustment bo made at all, without taking  
into view indirect and remote considerations,  
which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest  
which one party may find in disregarding  
the rights tf another, or the good of the whole.  
Tile inference to which we are brought, is,  
that causes of faction cannot be removed ; and  
that relief is only to be sought in the means of  
controlling its effects.  
If a faction consists of less than a majority,  
relief is supplid by the republican principle, which  
enables the majority to defeat its sinister views,  
by regular vote. It may clog the administration,  
it may convulse the society; but it will be unable  
to execute and mask its violence under the  
forms of the Constitution. When a majority  
is included in a faction, the form of popular Govvorninent,  
on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice  
to its ruling passion or interest, both the  
public good and the rights of other citizens. To  
secure the public good, and private rights, against  
the danger of such a faction, and ut the same  
lime to preserve the spirit and the form of popular  
Government, is then the great object to which  
our inquiries are directed. Let inc add, that it  
is the great desideratum, by which alone this  
form of Government can be rescued from the  
opprobrium under which it has so long labored,  
  
and be recomuienaea to we esteem ana adoption  
of mankind.  
By what means is this objects attainable?  
Evidently bv one of two only. Either the existence  
of the same passion or intc rest in a majority,  
at the same time, must be prevented; or the  
majority, having such co-existent passion or interest,  
must be rendered, by their number and  
local situation, unable to concert and carry into  
effect schemes of oppression. If the impulse I  
and the opportunity be suffered to coincide, we  
well know, that neither moral not religious motives  
can be relied on as an adi quute control.?  
They are not found to be such on the injustice  
and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy  
in proportion to the number combined  
together; that is, in proportion as their eliicary  
^ becomes needful.  
The closing sentence of this passage contains

5 no being in proportion to that of the constituents, and  
ng proportionally greatest in the small republic, it follows,  
at if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large  
han in the small repani », the former will present a greater  
yption, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.  
In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a  
ort r number of citizens in the | rge than in th mall repub-  
lie, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practise  
ith success the wicices arts, by whic ch elections are too often

It must be co ed, that in t!] as in most other cases  
here is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will b

tween them. He says: “It may be  
concluded that a pure democracy, by which  
I mean a society consisting of a small  
number of citizens who assemble and ad­  
minister the government in person, can  
admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction.  
A common passion or interest will in al­  
most every case be felt by a tnujority of the  
whole, a communication and concert result  
from the form of the government itself, and  
there is nothing to check the inducement  
to sacrifice the weaker party. Hence it is  
that such democracies have been spectacles  
of turbulence and contention; have ever  
been found incompatible with personal se­  
curity, and have in general been as short  
iu their lives as they have been violent  
in their deaths. A republic, by which I  
mean a government in which the scheme of  
representation takes place, opens a different  
prospect The extent of the difference is  
to refine and enlarge the public views by  
passing them through tfte medium of a  
chosen body ofcit&#x27;zens, whose wisdom may  
best discern the true interests of their coun­  
try, and whose patriotism will be least like­  
ly to sacrifice it to temporary or jmtial  
considerations.

those who aro debtors fall under a like  
discrimination. A landed interest, a

interest, a moneyed interest, with many  
lesser interests grow np of uccc-sity m  
civilised nations, and divide them into  
different classes actuated by different

allowed to be a judge in his own cause,  
because his interest will certain!) bias

controlling their effects. And then he  
proceeds to explain how the extent of  
country embraced in the Union, combined  
with the variety of interests represented in  
the Federal Government, tends to arrest  
the spread and restrain the violence of a  
factious spirit. To this effect he writes:  
  
“The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame  
within their particular States, but will be unable to  
spread a general conflagration through the other States.  
* * * A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts,  
for an equal division of property, or for any other im-  
proper and wicked project, will be less apt to pervade  
the whole body of the Union than any particular mem-  
ber of it, in the same proportion as such a malady is  
more likely to taint a particular county or district than  
an entire State.”  
  
The justice of these considerations, de-  
rived from the mere geographical extent of  
the Federal Union, and from the diversity  
of interests embraced within its bounds,  
will be apparent to every reader, and  
searcely seems to require enforcement.  
We proceed to show how the same consid-  
erations are reinforced and intensified by  
the structure and organism of the Federal  
Government.

son of the danger in these words: “ No man is  
allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because  
his interest would certainly bias his judgment  
and not improbably corrupt his integrity. With  
equal, nay, with greater, reason a body of men  
are unfit to be both judges and parties at the  
same time; vet what are many of the most iim-  
portant acts of legislation but so many judicial  
determinations, not, indeed, concerning the rights  
of single persons, but concerning the rights of  
large bodies of citizens? And what are the dif-  
ferent classes of legislators but advocates and  
parties to the cause which they determine? Is  
a law proposed concerning private debts. It is  
a question in which the creditors are parties on  
one side and the debtors on the other. Justice  
ought to hold the balance between them. Yet  
the parties are and must be the judges; and the

ce Is.  
To THE EDITOR OF THE SUN- SIR: In the New  
York Packet of Nov. 23, 1787, was published a  
letter, now included in the Federalest and at­  
tributed to Mr. Madison, which is singularly  
apposite to our present political crisis. Written  
in a period of financial distress and of popular  
disoontent strikingly like the present, it deserves  
the attention of every patriotic citizen who ap­  
preciates adequately the imminent dangers  
which lurk behind the shameless appeals to the  
passions of the impoverished mob represented  
by the reckless demagogues controlling the Chi­  
cago Convention. Madison wrote:  
On a candid review of our situation, some of the  
distresses under which we labor have been erroneously  
charged on the operation of our Government; but it  
will be found at the same time that other causes will  
not alone account for many of our heaviest misfor.­  
tunes, and particularly for that prevatling and in­  
creasing distrust of public engagements and alarm  
for private rights which are echoed from one end of  
the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if  
not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice  
with which a factious spirit has tainted our publio  
administrations.  
By a faction I understand a number of citizens,  
whether amounting to a majority or minority of the  
whole, who are united and actuated by some common  
impulse of passion or of interest adverse to the  
rights of other citizens or to the permanent and ag­  
gregate interests of the community.  The  
most common and durable source of factions has  
been the various and unequal distribution of prop­  
erty. Those who hold and those who are without  
property have ever formed distinct interests in socte­  
ty. Those who are creditors and those who are  
debtors fall under a like discrimination.  
The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame  
within their particular States, but will be unable to  
spread a general conflagration through the other  
States. A rage for paper money, for an abo  
iftion of debts, for an equal division of property,  
or for any other improper or wicked project, will be  
less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than  
a particular member of it, in the same proportion  
as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular  
county or district than an entire State.

On a candid review of our situation some of the  
  
distresses under which we labor have been errone-  
ously charged on the operation of our government,  
  
but it will be found at the same time that other~  
  
causes will not alone account for many of our  
heaviest misfortunes, and particularly for that  
prevailing and increasing distrust of public en-  
gagements and alarm for private rights which are  
echoed from one end of the continent to the other.  
These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the  
unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious  
spirit has tainted our public administrations.  
  
By a faction I understand a number of citizens,  
whether amounting to a majority or minority of  
the whole, who are united and actuated by some  
common impulse of passion or of interest adverse  
to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent  
and aggregate interests of the community. .. .  
The most common and durable source of factions  
has been the various and unequal distribution of  
property. Those who hold and those who are  
without property have ever formed distinct inter-  
ests in society. Those who are creditors and those  
who are debtors fall under a like discrimination.  
; The influence of factious leaders may  
kindle a flame within their particular States, but  
will be unable to spread a general conflagration  
through the other States. A rage for paper  
money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal  
division of property, or for any other improper or  
wicked project will be less apt to pervade the  
whole body of the Union than a particular mem-  
ber of it, in the same proportion as such a malady  
is more likely to taint a particular county or dis-  
trict than an entire State.

&quot;The influence of factious leaders,”  
wrote Hamilton in tbe “ Federalist,&quot;  
&quot;may kindle a flame within tbeir  
particular station, but will be unable  
to epTead a general conflagration  
through the other States. A religious  
sect may degenerate into a political  
section in a part of the confederacy,  
but the variety of sects dispersed ever  
tbe entire face of it, must secure the  
national councils against any danger  
from th at source. A rage for paper  
money, for the abolition of debts, for  
an equal division of property, or for  
any other improper cr wicked project,  
will be less apt to pervade the whole  
body of the union than a patticular  
number of it, in th e Bame proportion as  
such a malady is more likely to taint a  
particular county or district than an
