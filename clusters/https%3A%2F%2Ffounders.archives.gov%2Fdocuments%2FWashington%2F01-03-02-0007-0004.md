1st. By this date all my Boats were ready—viz.—One hundred New ones at Albany (constructed under the direction of Genel. Schuyler) and the like number at Wappings Creek by the Qr. Mr. Genl.; besides old ones which have been repaired. My heavy ordnance &amp; Stores from the Eastward had also come on to the North Rivr. and every thing would have been in perfect readiness to commense the operation against New York, if the States had furnished their quotas of men agreeably to my requisitions but so far have they been from complying with these that of the first, not more than half the number asked of them have joined the Army; and of 6200 of the latter pointedly &amp; timously called for to be with the Army by the 15th. of last Month, only 176 had arrived from Connecticut, independant of abt. 300 State Troops under the Command of Genl. Waterbury, which had been on the lines before we took the field, &amp; two Companies of York levies (abt. 80 Men) under similar circumstances.  
Thus circumstanced, and having little more than general assurances  
  
of getting the succours called for and energetic Laws &amp; resolves or Laws &amp; resolves energetically executed, to depend upon—with little appearance of their fulfillment, I could scarce see a ground upon wch. to continue my preparations against New York—especially as there was much reason to believe that part (at least) of the Troops in Virginia were recalled to reinforce New York and therefore I turned my views more seriously (than I had before done) to an operation to the Southward and, in consequence, sent to make enquiry, indirectly, of the principal Merchants to the Eastward what number, &amp; in what time, Transports could be provided to convey a force to the Southward if it should be found necessary to change our plan &amp; similar application was made in a direct way to Mr. Morris (Financier) to discover what number cd. be had by the 20th. of this Month at Philadelphia or in Chesapeak bay. At the sametime General Knox was requested to turn his thoughts to this business and make every necessary arrangement for it in his own Mind—estimating the ordnance &amp; Stores which would be wanting &amp; how many of them could be obtained without a transport of them from the North River. Measures were also taken to deposit the Salt provisions in such places as to be Water born. More than these, while there remained a hope of Count de Grasses bringing a land force with him, &amp; that the States might yet put us in circumstances to prosecute the original plan could not be done without unfolding matters too plainly to the enemy &amp; enabling them thereby to Counteract our Schemes.  
  
  
GW to Robert Morris, 2 Aug. 1781 (DLC:GW).  
  
  
  
  
4th. Fresh representations of the defenceless State of the Northern frontier, for want of the Militia so long called for and expected from Massachusetts bay; accompanied by a strong expression of the fears of the People that they should be under the necessity of abandoning that part of the Country &amp; an application that the Second York Regiment (Courtlandts)  at least should be left for their protection induced me to send Major Genl. Lincoln (whose influence in his own State was great) into the Counties of Berkshire &amp; Hampshire to enquire into the causes of these delays &amp; to hasten on the Militia. I wrote at the same time to the Governor of this State consenting to suffer the 4 Companies of Courtlandts Regiment (now at Albany) to remain in that Quarter till the Militia did come in, but observed that if the States instead of filling their Battalions &amp; sending forth their  
  
Militia were to be calling upon, &amp; expecting me to dissipate the sml. operating force under my command for local defences that all offensive operations must be relinquished and we must content ourselves (in case of compliance) to spend an inactive and injurious Campaign which might—at this critical moment—be ruinous to the common cause of America.  
  
  
Col. Philip Van Cortlandt (1749–1831) commanded the 2d New York Regiment from Nov. 1776 to the end of the war.  
  
  
Brig. Gen. James Clinton wrote to GW on 30 July and Gov. George Clinton on 1 Aug. 1781; both men enclosed letters from other officers complaining of the precarious state of the northern frontier (DLC:GW). GW’s letter to George Clinton, 5 Aug. 1781, is in N: Clinton Papers. For GW’s problems with the militia from these counties, see the entries for 25 June, 30 July 1781.  
  
  
  
  
6th. Reconnoitred the Roads and Country between the North River and the Brunxs from the Camp to Philip’s and Valentines Hill and found the ground every where strong—the Hills 4 in Number running parallel to each other with deep ravines between them—occasioned by the Saw Mill river—the Sprain branch and another more Easterly. These hills have very few interstices or Breaks in them, but are more prominent in some places than others. The Saw mill River, &amp; the Strain branch occasion an entire seperation of the hills above Philips’s from those below commonly called Valentines hills. A strong position might be taken with the Saw Mill (by the Widow Babcocks)  in Front, &amp; on the left flank and the No. River on the right Flank and this position may be extended from the Saw Mill river over the sprain Branch.  
A Letter from the Marqs. de la Fayette of the 26th. Ulto. gives the following acct.—That the two Battalions of light Infantry—Queens Rangers—the Guards &amp; one or two other Regiments had Embarked at Portsmouth &amp; fallen down to Hampton Rd. in 49 Transports—that he supposed this body of Troops could not consist of less than 2000 Men—That Chesapeak bay &amp; Potomack River were spoken of as the destination of this detachment—but he was of opinion that it was intended as a reinforcement to New York. Horses were laid for the speedy communication of Intelligence and an officer was to be sent with the acct. of the Fleets Sailing.

Urged Governor Greene of Rhode Island to keep up the number of Militia required of that State at Newport &amp; to have such arrangements made of the rest as to give instant &amp; effectual support to the Post, &amp; the Shipping in the harbour, in case any thing should be enterprized against the latter upon the arrival of Rodney; who, with the British fleet, is said to be expected at New York, &amp; in conjuction with the Troops which are Embarked in Virginia &amp; their own Marines are sufficient to create alarms.

9th. A Letter from the Marqs. de la fayette of the 30th. Ulto., reports, that the Embarkation in Hampton Road still remained there—that there were 30 Ships full of Troops chiefly red Coats  
  
in the fleet—that Eight or ten other Vessels (Brigs) had Cavalry on Board—that the Winds had been extremely favourable—notwithstanding which they still lay at anchor &amp; that the Charon &amp; several other frigates (some said Seven) were with them as an escort. The Troops which he now speaks of as composing the detachment are the light Infantry—Queens Rangers and he thinks two British &amp; two German Regiments—no mention of the Guards as in his former Acct.  
  
  
Lafayette to GW, 30 July 1781 (DLC:GW).  
  
  
  
  
10th. Ordered the first York, and Hazens Regiments immediately to this place from West point—The Invalids having got in both from Philadelphia &amp; Boston and more Militia got in from Connecticut, as also some from Massachusetts bay giving with 4 Companies of Courtlandts Regiment in addition to the detachment left there upon the March of the Army perfect security to the Posts.  
  
  
That is, troops from the Corps of Invalids (see entry for 16 June 1781).

A Fleet consisting of about 20 Sail, including 2 frigates &amp; one or two prizes, arrived within the harbour of New York with German recruits—to the amount—by Rivington—of 2880 but by other, &amp; better information to abt. 1500 sickly Men.

12. By accounts this day received from the Marqs. de la Fayette it appeared that the Transports in Hampton road had stood up the Bay &amp; came too at the distance of 15 Miles and, in conseqe. he had commenced his March toward Fredericksburg that he might more readily oppose his operations on Potomack or up Chesapeak bay.  
  
  
Lafayette to GW, 1 Aug. 1781 (DLC:GW).  
  
  
  
  
14th. Received dispatches from the Count de Barras announcing the intended departure of the Count de Grasse from Cape Francois with between 25 &amp; 29 Sail of the line &amp; 3200 land Troops on the 3d. Instant for Chesapeake bay and the anxiety of the latter to have every thing in the most perfect readiness to commence our operations in the moment of his arrival as he should be under a necessity from particular engagements with the Spaniards to be in the West Indies by the Middle of October—At the same time intimating his (Barras’s) Intentions of enterprizing something against Newfoundland, &amp; against which both Genl. Rochambeau and myself remonstrated as impolitic &amp; dangerous under the probability of Rodneys coming upon this Coast.  
Matters having now come to a crisis and a decisive plan to be determined on—I was obliged, from the Shortness of Count de  
  
Grasses premised stay on this Coast—the apparent disinclination in their Naval Officers to force the harbour of New York and the feeble compliance of the States to my requisitions for Men, hitherto, &amp; little prospect of greater exertion in future, to give up all idea of attacking New York; &amp; instead thereof to remove the French Troops &amp; a detachment from the American Army to the Head of Elk to be transported to Virginia for the purpose of cooperating with the force from the West Indies against the Troops in that State.

15. Dispatched a Courier to the Marquis de la Fayette with information of this matter—requesting him to be in perfect readiness to second my views &amp; to prevent if possible the retreat of Cornwallis toward Carolina. He was also directed to Halt the  
  
Troops under the Command of General Wayne if they had not made any great progress in their March to join the Southern Army.  
  
  
GW to Lafayette, 15 Aug. 1781 (DLC:GW). Presumably the courier was Louis Le Bègue Duportail (see GW to Lafayette, 17 Aug. 1781, DLC:GW).  
  
  
  
  
16th. Letters from the Marqs. de la Fayette &amp; others, inform that Lord Cornwallis with the Troops from Hampton Road, had proceeded up York River &amp; landed at York &amp; Gloucester Towns where they were throwing up Works on the 6th. Inst.  
  
  
Lafayette to GW, 11 Aug. 1781 (DLC:GW).  
  
  
  
  
19th. The want of Horses, or bad condition of them in the French army delayed the March till this day. The same causes, it is to be feared, will occasion a slow and disagreeable March to Elk if fresh horses cannot be procured &amp; better management of them adopted.  
The detachment from the American [army] is composed of the light Infantry under Scammell—two light companies of York to be joined by the like Number from the Connecticut line—the remainder of the Jersey line—two Regiments of York—Hazens Regiment &amp; the Regiment of Rhode Island—together with Lambs regiment of Artillery with Cannon and other Ordnance for the field &amp; Siege.  
Hazens regiment being thrown over at Dobbs’s ferry was ordered with the Jersey Troops to March &amp; take Post on the heights between Spring field &amp; Chatham &amp; Cover a french Battery at the latter place to veil our real movement &amp; create apprehensions for Staten Island. The Quarter Master Genl. was dispatched to Kings ferry—the only secure passage—to prepare for the speedy transportation of the Troops across the River.  
Passed Singsing with the American column. The French column marched by the way of Northcastle, Crompond &amp; Pinesbridge being near ten miles further.

20th. The head of the Americans arrived at Kings ferry about ten O’clock &amp; immediately began to cross.  
  
  
  
21st. In the course of this day the whole of the American Troop, all their baggage, artillery &amp; Stores, crossed the river. Nothing remained of ours but some Waggons in the Commissary’s &amp; Qr. Mr. Generals departmt., which were delayed, that no interruption might be given to the passage of the French Army.  
During the passing of the French Army I mounted 30 flat Boats (able to carry about 40 Men each) upon carriages—as well with a design to deceive the enemy as to our real movement, as to be useful to me in Virginia when I get there.  
Some of the french Artillery wch. preceeded their Infantry got to the ferry &amp; crossed it also.

22d. 23d. 24th. &amp; 25th. Employed in transporting the French Army, its baggage &amp; Stores over the river.  
  
  
On 23 Aug., GW and Rochambeau visited West Point (CROMOT DU BOURG[Marie François Joseph Maxime, Baron Cromot du Bourg]. “Diary of a French Officer, 1781.” Magazine of American History with Notes and Queries 4 (1880): 205–14, 293–308, 376–85, 441–52; 7 (1881): 283–95., 307).  
  
  
  
  
[25th.] The 25th. the American Troops marched in two Columns—Genl. Lincoln with the light Infantry &amp; first York Regiment pursuing the rout by Peramus to Springfield—while Colo. Lamb with his Regiment of Artillery—the Parke—Stores and Baggage of the Army covered by the Rhode Island Regt. proceeded to Chatham by the way of Pompton &amp; the two bridges.  
The Legion of Lauzen &amp; the Regiments of Bourbonne &amp; Duponts with the heavy Parke of the French Army also Marched for percipony by Suffrans Pompton &amp; .  
  
  
That is, gun or artillery park.  
  
  
The Deux-Ponts Regiment was composed primarily of officers and men from the duchy of Deux-Ponts on the Franco-German border. Its colonel was Christian, comte de Deux-Ponts, with Guillaume, comte de Deux-Ponts, as lieutenant colonel. The regiment came to America with Admiral de Ternay’s fleet in the spring of 1780.  
  
  
Parsippany, Morris County, N.J., is six miles northeast of Morristown.  
  
  
  
  
[26th.] The 26th. the remainder of the French army, its baggage &amp; Stores, moved from the ferry and arrived at Suffrans—the ground the others had left.  
  
  
  
28th. The American columns and 1st. division of the French Army arrived at the places assigned them.  
  
  
  
29th. The Second division of French joined the first. The whole halted—as well for the purpose of bringing up our rear—as because we had heard not of the arrival of Count de Grasse &amp; was unwilling to discover our real object to the enemy.  
  
  
  
30th. As our intentions could be concealed one March more (under the idea of Marching to Sandy hook to facilitate the entrance of the French fleet within the Bay), the whole Army was put in motion in three columns—the left consisted of the light Infantry, first York Regiment, and the Regiment of Rhode Island—the Middle column consisted of the Parke Stores &amp; Baggage  
  
  
  
—Lambs Regt. of Artillery—Hazens &amp; the Corps of Sappers &amp; Miners—the right column consisted of the whole French army, Baggage Stores &amp;ca. This last was to march by the rout of Morristown—Bullions Tavern—Somerset C[our]t House &amp; Princeton. The middl. was to go by Bound brooke to Somerset &amp;ca. and the left to proceed by the way of Brunswick to Trenton, to which place the whole were to March Transports being ordered to meet them there.  
I set out myself for Philadelphia to arrange matters there—provide Vessels &amp; hasten the transportation of the Ordnance Stores, &amp;ca.—directing before I set out, the secd. York Regiment (which had not all arrived from Albany before we left Kings ferry) to follow with the Boats—Intrenching Tools &amp;ca. the French Rear to Trenton.  
  
  
Bullion’s Tavern was at Liberty Corner, N.J.  
  
  
Somerset Court House is now Millstone, Somerset County, N.J., eight miles west of New Brunswick.  
  
  
Bound Brook is on the Raritan River, Somerset County, N.J., six miles northwest of New Brunswick.  
  
  
  
  
31st. Arrived at Philadelphia to dinner and immediately hastened up all the Vessels that could be procured—but finding them inadequate to the purpose of transporting both Troops &amp; Stores, Count de Rochambeau &amp; myself concluded it would be best to let the Troops March by land to the head of Elk, &amp; gave directions accordingly to all but the 2d. York Regiment which was ordered (with its baggage) to come down in the Batteaux they had in charge to Christiana bridge.

at State.” The next day he despatched a courier to the  
Marquis de Lafayette with the joyful news and directed him to be in  
perfect readiness to second his views and prevent, if possible, the retreat  
of Cornwallis towards the Carolinas.  
  
In these words are found the first practical inception of the York-  
town campaign which was the alternative plan discussed by the allied  
commanders and from the time of the conference at Weathersfield, the  
desire of de Rochambeau. Later letters from Lafayette the next day  
brought information that Lord Cornwallis, with the troops from Hamp-  
ton Roads, had proceeded up York River and landed at York and  
Gloucester where they were throwing up earth works.

Paramus to Springfield, while Colonel Lamb, with his regiment of

squadron of the Count de Grasse were awaited with the greatest impa-  
tience and anxiety.  
  
On the morning of the 29th, the French moved to Bullion’s Tavern,  
and the right column of the Americans to Bound Brook. The feint  
against New York having served its purpose, and its continuance being |  
of no further advantage, Washington issued his orders for the march  
southward. His own admirable diary, in itself a complete _his-  
tory of the campaign, gives the best account of his purposes and his  
measures. “As our intentions could be concealed one march more  
(under the idea of marching to Sandy Hook to facilitate the entrance  
of the French fleet within the Bay), the whole army was put in motion  
in three columns. The left consisted of the Light Infantry, First York  
Regiment and the Regiment of Rhode Island ; the middle column con-  
sisted of the Park, stores and baggage, Lamb’s regiment of Artillery,  
Hazen’s and the corps of sappers and miners; the. right column con-  
sisted of the whole French army, baggage, stores, etc. This last was to  
march by the route of Morristown, Bullion’s Tavern, Somerset Court  
House and Princeton. The middle was to go by Bound Brook to Som-  
erset, etc., and the left to proceed by the way of Brunswick to Trenton,  
to which place the whole were to march, transports being ordered to  
meet them there.” These orders issued, Washington set out for Phila-  
delphia for further arrangements to provide vessels and transportation  
for the ordnance and stores.

August 1st—By this date all my Boats  
were ready—viz—one hundred new ones  
at Albany (constructed under the direc-  
tion of Genl, Schuyler), and the like  
number at Wappings creek by the Qr.  
Mr. Genl. ; besides old ones which have  
been repaired.— My heavy Ordnance &amp;  
Stores from the Eastward had also come  
on to the North Rivr.—and everything  
would have been in perfect readiness to  
commense the operation against New  
York, if the States had furnished their  
quotas of Men agreeably to my requi-  
sitions—but so far have they been from  
complying with these that of the first,  
not more than half the number asked  
of them have joined the army; and of  
6200 of the latter pointedly, &amp; contin-  
ously called for to be with the army by the  
15th of last month, only 176 had arrived  
from Connecticut, independant of abt.  
300 State Troops under the command  
of Genl. Waterbury, which had been on  
the lines before we took the field, &amp;  
two Companies of York levies (abt. 80  
Men) under similar circumstances.  
  
Thus circumstanced, and having little  
more than general assurances of getting  
the succours called for—and energetic  
Laws and resolves—or Laws and re-  
solves energetically executed, to depend  
upon—with little appearance of their  
fulfilment, I could scarce see a ground  
upon wch to continue my preparations  
  
DOCUMENTS  
  
against New York—especially as there  
was much reason to believe that part  
(at least) of the Troops in Virginia were  
recalled to reinforce New York and  
therefore I turned my views more  
seriously (than I had before done) to an  
operation to the Southward—and, in  
consequence, sent to make enquiry, in-  
directly, of the principal merchants to  
the Eastward what number and in what  
time, Transports could be provided to  
convey a force to the Southward, if it  
should be found necessary to change our  
plan—and similar application was made  
in a direct way to Mr. Morris (Financier)  
to discover what number cd be had by  
the 2oth of this Month at Philadelphia  
—or in Chesapeak bay.—At the same  
time General Knox was requested to  
turn his thoughts to this business and  
make every necessary arrangement for it  
in his own mind—estimating the Ord-  
nance &amp; stores which would be wanting  
&amp; how many of them could be obtained  
without a transport of them from the  
North River.—Measures were also taken  
to deposit the Salt provisions in such  
places as to be water born[e]—more than  
these, while there remained a hope of  
Count de Grasse’s bringing a land force  
with him, &amp; that the States might yet  
put us in circumstances to prosecute  
the original plan could not be done  
without unfolding matters too plainly  
to the enemy &amp; enabling them thereby  
to counteract our schemes.—  
  
August 4th—Fresh representations of  
the defenceless state of the Northern  
frontier, for want of the militia so long  
called for, and expected from Massachu-  
settes bay ; accompanied by a strong  
expression of the fears of the People  
  
  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
that they should be under the necessity  
of abandoning that part of the Country.  
&amp; an application that the second York  
regiment (Courtlandts) at /east should  
be left for their protection induced me  
to send Major Genl. Lincoln (whose in-  
fluence in his own State was great) into  
the Counties of Berkshire &amp; Hampshire  
to enquire into the causes of these de-  
lays &amp; to hasten on the militia.—I wrote  
at the same time to the Governor of this  
State consenting to suffer the 4 Compa-  
nies of Courtlandts Regiment (now at  
Albany) to remain in that Quarter till  
the Militia did come in, but observed that  
if the States instead of filling their Bat-  
talions &amp; sending forth their Militia were  
to be calling upon and expecting me to  
dissipate the sml. operating force ‘under  
my command for local defences that all  
offensive operations must be relinquished  
and we must content ourselves (in case  
of compliance) to spend an inactive and  
injurious campaign which might—at this  
critical moment—be ruinous to the  
common cause of America.  
  
August 6th—Reconnoitred the Roads  
&amp; Country between the North River  
and the Brunx from the Camp to  
Phillips’s and Valentines Hill and found  
the ground every where strong—The  
Hills 4 in Number running parallel to  
each other with deep ravines between  
them — occasioned by the Saw Mill  
river—the Sprain branch—and another  
more Easterly. These hills have very  
few interstices or Breaks in them, but  
are more prominent in some places than  
others—The Saw Mill River and the  
Sprain branch occasion an entire sepe-  
ration of the hills above Philips’s from  
those below commonly called Valen-  
  
123  
  
tine’s hills. —A Strong position might be  
taken with the Saw Mill (by the Widow  
Babcocks) in Front &amp; on the left flank.  
And the No. River on the right Flank.  
—aAnd this position may be extended  
from the Saw Mill River over the Sprain  
Branch.  
  
A Letter from the Marqs. de la Fay-  
ette of the 26th Ulto. gives the follow-  
ing acct.—That the two Battalions of  
light Infantry—Queen’s Rangers—the  
Guards—&amp; one or two other Regiments  
had embarked at Portsmouth &amp; fallen  
down to Hampton Rd in 49 Trans-  
ports.—That he supposed this body of  
Troops could not consist of less than  
2000 Men.—That Chesapeak bay &amp;  
Potomack River were spoken of as the  
destination of this detachment—but he  
  
was of opinion that it was intended asa  
reinforcement to New York—Horses  
were laid for the speedy communication  
of Intelligence and an officer was to be  
sent with the acct. of the Fleet’s Sail-  
  
ing.—

Road still remained there—that there  
were 30 ships full of Troops—Chiefly  
red coats in the fleet—That eight or ten

which they still lay at Anchor—&amp; that

ment are—the light Infantry—Queen’s  
Rangers—and he thinks two British  
and two German Regiments—no men-  
tion of the Guards as in his former

York with German recruits —to the  
amount—by Rivington, of 2880—but  
by other, &amp; better information to abt.  
1500 sickly men.  
  
August 12th—By accounts this day  
received from the Margqs. de la Fayette,  
it appeared that the Transports in  
Hampton road had stood up the Bay &amp;  
came too at the distance of 15 miles—  
and, in consege. he had commenced his  
march towards Fredericksburg. That  
he might more readily oppose his op-  
erations on Potomack or up Chesapeak

Grasse from Cape Francois with be-  
tween 25 &amp; 29 Sail of the line &amp; 3200

Army delayed the March till this day—  
The same causes, it is to be feared, will  
occasion a slow and disagreeable March  
to Elk if fresh horses cannot be pro-  
cured &amp; better management of them  
adopted.  
  
The detachment from the American  
  
125  
  
is composed of the light Infantry under  
Scammell—two light companies of York  
to be joined by the like number from  
the Connecticut line—The remainder  
of the Jersey line—two Regiments of  
York—Hazen’s Regiment &amp; the Regi-  
ment of Rhode Island.—together with  
Lamb’s regiment of Artillery with cannon  
and other ordnance for the field &amp;  
siege.—  
  
Hazens regiment being thrown over  
at Dobbs’s ferry was ordered with the  
Jersey Troops to march &amp; take Post on  
the heights between Springfield &amp; Chat-  
ham &amp; cover a french Bakery at the  
latter place to veil our real movement  
and create apprehensions for Staten  
Island. —  
  
The quarter master Genl. was dis-  
patched to King’s ferry—the only secure  
passage—to prepare for the speedy  
transportation of the Troops across the  
River.—  
  
Passed Sing Sing with the American  
column—The French column marched  
by the way of North castle Crompond  
&amp; Pines bridge being near ten miles  
further.

August 20th—The head of the Ameri-

o’clock and immediately began to cross.  
  
August 21st—In the course of this  
day the whole of the American Troop,

crossed the river—Nothing remained of  
ours but some waggons in the Commis-

August 22d, 23d, 24th &amp; 25¢h—Em-  
ployed in transporting the French Army  
—its baggage &amp; stores over the river.  
  
The 25th—The American Troops  
marched in two columns—Genl. Lin-  
coln with the light Infantry &amp; first York  
Regiment pursuing the rout by Peramus  
to Springfield—While Colo. Lamb with  
his regiment of Artillery—The Parke—  
Stores—and Baggage of the army cov-  
ered by the Rhode Island Regt. pro-  
ceeded to Chatham by the way of Pomp-  
  
ton &amp; the two bridges.  
  
The Legion of Lauzen — and the  
Regiments of Bourbonne &amp; Duponts  
with the heavy Parke of the French  
Army also marched for Percipony by  
Suffrens—Pompton &amp;  
  
August 26th—The remainder of the  
  
French army, its baggage &amp; stores,  
moved from the ferry, and arrived at  
Suffrens—the ground the others had  
left.  
  
August 28th—The American columns  
and 1st division of the French Army  
arrived at the places assigned them.  
  
August 29th—The Second division  
of French joined the first—the whole  
halted—as well for the purpose of bring-  
ing up our rear—as because we had  
heard not of the arrival of Count de  
Grasse &amp; was unwilling to discover our  
real object to the enemy.  
  
August 30th—As our intentions could  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
be concealed one march more (under  
the idea of Marching to Sandy hook to  
facilitate the entrance of the French  
fleet within the Bay, the whole Army  
was put in motion in three Columns—  
The left consisted of the light Infantry,  
first York Regiment, and the Regiment  
of Rhode Island.—The middle column  
consisted of the Park, Stores &amp; Bag-  
gage—Lamb’s Regt. of Artillery—Ha-  
zen’s—&amp; the corps of Sappers &amp; Miners  
—the right column consisted of the  
whole French Army, Baggage Stores  
&amp;ca.—This last was to march by the rout  
of Morristown — Bullions Tavern —  
Somerset Ct. House &amp; Princeton.  
  
The middl. was to go by Bound  
brooke to Somerset &amp;ca.—and the left  
to proceed by the way of Brunswick to  
Trenton, to which place the whole were  
to march—-Transports being ordered to  
meet them there.  
  
I set out myself for Philadelphia to  
arrange matters there—provide vessels—  
&amp; hasten the transportation of the Ord-  
nance Stores, &amp;ca.—directing before I  
set out, the Secd. York Regiment (which  
had not all arrived from Albany before  
we left King’s ferry) to follow with the  
boats — Intrenching Tools &amp;c. the  
French rear to Trenton.  
  
Arrived at Philadelphia to dinner and  
immediately hastened up all the vessels,  
that could be procured —but finding  
them inadequate to the purpose of trans-  
porting both Troops and Stores, Count  
de Rochambeau and myself concluded  
it would be best to let the Troops march  
by land to the head of Elk, &amp; gave  
directions accordingly to all but the 2d  
York Regiment, which was ordered

general assurances of getting the succors called for, * * * I could scarce see a ground upon  
which to continue my preparations against New York—especially as there was much reason to be-  
lieve that part (at least) of the Troops in Virginia were recalled to reinforce New York, and therefore  
I turned my views more seriously (than I had before done) to an operation to the Scuthward—and  
in consequence, sent to make enquiry, indirectly, of the principal merchants to the Eastward, what  
number, and in what time, Transports could be provided to convey a force to the Southward, if it  
should be found necessary to change our plan, and similar application was made in a direct way to  
Mr. Morris (Financier) to discover what number could be had by the 20th of this month at Phila-

August 1*. By this date all my boats ready—viz.—one hundred new  
ones at Albany (constructed under the direction of Gen. Schuyler) and  
the like number at Wappings Creek by the 2? M! Gen.; besides old ones  
which have been repaired. My heavy ordnance &amp; stores from the eastward  
had also come on to the North River—and everything would have been  
  
  
  
58 WASHINGTON’S DIARY FOR AUGUST, 1781  
  
in perfect readiness to commence the operation against New York if the  
States had furnished their quotas of men agreeably to my requisition—but  
so far have they been from complying with these that of the first not more  
than half the number asked of them have joined the army; and of 6200  
of the latter, pointed and timorously called for to be with the army by  
15° of last month, only 176 had arrived from Connecticut, independent of  
about 300 State troops under the command of Gen! Waterbury, which had  
been on the lines before. We took the field, and two companies of York  
levies (about 80 men) under similar circumstances.  
  
Thus circumstanced, and having little more than general assurances of  
getting the succours called for—and energetic laws and resolves—or laws  
and resolves energetically executed, to depend upon with little appearance  
of their fulfillment, I could scarce see a ground upon which to continue my  
preparations against New York—especially as there was much reason to  
believe that part (at least) of the troops in Virginia were recalled to rein-  
force New York and therefore I turned my views more seriously (than I  
had before done) to an operation to the southward—and, in consequence,  
sent to make enquiry, indirectly, of the principal merchants to the east-  
ward what number and in what time, transports could be provided to con-  
vey a force to the southward, if it should be found necessary to change our  
plan—and a similar application was made in a direct way to Mr. Morris  
(Financier) to discover what number could be had by the 20% of this month  
at Philadelphia—or in Chesapeak bay—at the same time General Knox  
was requested to turn his thoughts to this business and make every neces-  
sary arrangement for it in his own mind—estimating the ordnance and  
stores which would be wanting and how many of them could be obtained  
without a transport of them from the North River. Measures were also  
taken to deposit the salt provisions in such places as to be water born—  
more than these, while there remained a hope of Count de Grasse’ bring-  
ing a land force with him, and that the States might yet put us in circum-  
stances to prosecute the original plan, could not be done without unfolding  
matters too plainly to the enemy and enabling them thereby to counteract  
our schemes.  
  
August 4&quot;. Fresh representations of the defenceless state of the North-  
ern frontier for want of the militia so long called for, and expected from  
Massachusetts bay; accompanied by a strong expression of the fears of  
the people that they should be under the necessity of abandoning that part  
of the country—and an application that the second York Regiment (Court-  
landts) at /east should be left for their protection induced me to send  
Major-Gener! Lincoln (whose influence in his own state was great) into the  
  
  
  
WASHINGTON’S DIARY FOR AUGUST, 1781 59  
  
counties of Berkshire and Hampshire to enquire into the cause of these  
delays and to hasten on the militia. I wrote at the same time to the Gov-  
ernor of this State consenting to suffer the 4 companies of Courtlandts  
Regiment (now at Albany) to remain in that Quarter till the militia did  
come in, but observed that if the States instead of filling their Battalions  
and sending forth their militia, were to be calling upon and expecting me  
to dissipate the small operating force under my command for local defences,  
that all offensive operations must be relinquished and we must content  
ourselves (in case of compliance) to spend an inactive and injurious cam-  
paign which might—at this critical moment—be ruinous to the common  
cause of America.  
  
August 6%. Reconnoitred the Roads and Country between the North  
River and the Bronx from the camp to Philips’s and Valentines Hill and  
found the ground everywhere strong—the hills four in number running  
parallel to each other with deep ravines between them—occasioned by the  
saw mill river, the sprain branch, and another more easterly. These hills  
have very few interstices or Breaks in them, but are more prominent in  
some places than others.. The saw mill river, and the sprain branch occasion  
an entire separation of the hills above Philips’s from those below commonly  
called Valentines hills. A strong position might be taken with the saw  
mill (by the widow Babcocks) in front, and on the left flank, and the North  
River on the right flank—and this position may be extended from the  
saw mill river over the sprain branch.  
  
A letter from the Marquis de la Fayette of the 2oth ult® gives the  
following acc’t. That the two Battalions of light infantry—Queen’s Ran-  
gers—the Guards—and one or two other Regiments had embarked at  
Portsmouth and fallen down to Hampton R’d in 49 transports: he  
supposed this body of troops could not consist of less than 2000 men : that  
Chesapeak Bay and Potomack River were spoken of as the destination of  
this detachment,—but he was of opinion that it was intended as a reinforce-  
ment to New York. Horses were laid for the speedy communication of  
intelligence and an officer was to be sent with the acc’t of the Fleets sailing.

arrangements made of the rest as to give instant and effectual support to

August 9&quot; A letter from the Marquis de la Fayette of the 30&quot; ult® reports  
that the embarkation in Hampton Road still remained there—that there were  
30 ships full of troops, chiefly red coats in the fleet—that eight or ten other  
vessels (Brigs) had cavalry on board—that the winds had been extremely fa-  
vorable, notwithstanding which they still lay at anchor, and that the Charox  
and several other frigates (some said seven) were with them as an escort ;  
the troops which he now speaks of as composing the detachment are the  
Light Infantry—Queen’s Rangers—and he thinks the British and two Ger-  
man Regiments. No mention of the Guards as in his former acc’t.  
  
August 10. Ordered the first York, and Hazens Regiments immediatly  
to this place from West Point. The Invalids having got in both from  
Philadelphia and Boston—and more militia got in from Connecticut, as  
also some from Massachusetts Bay, giving with four companies of Court-  
landt’s Regiment in addition to the detachment left there upon the march  
of the army, perfect security to the posts.  
  
August 11%. Robert Morris Esq&#x27;, Superintendent of Finance, and  
Rich* Peters Esq’, a member of the Board of War, arrived at camp  
to fix with me the number of men necessary for the next campaign,  
and to make the consequent arrangements for their establishment  
and support. A fleet consisting of about 20 sail, including 2 frigates  
and one or two prizes, arrived within the harbor of New York with Ger-  
man recruits to the amount—by Rivington—of 2880, but by other and  
better information to about 1500 sickly men.

“ August 30th.—As our intentions could be concealed one march more  
(under the idea of Marching to Sandy hook, to facilitate the entrance of the  
French fleet within the Bay), the whole Army was put in motion in three  
Columns... . I set out myself for Philadelphia to arrange matters there. ...  
Arrived at Philadelphia to dinner and immediately hastened up all the ves-  
sels that could be procured—but finding them inadequate to the purpose of  
transporting both Troops and Stores, Count de Rochambeau and myself  
concluded it would be best to let the Troops march by land to the Head of  
Elk, &amp; gave directions accordingly to all but the 2d York regiment, which  
was ordered (with its baggage) to come down in the Batteaux they had in  
charge to Christiana bridge.”&quot;— Washington’s Journal.
