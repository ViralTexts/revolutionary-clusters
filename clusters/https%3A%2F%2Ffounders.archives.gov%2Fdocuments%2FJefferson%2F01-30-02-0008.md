d make her own time more tolerable. when we see ourselves in a situation which must be endured &amp; gone through, it is best to make up our minds to it, meet it with firmness, &amp; accomodate every thing to it in the best way practicable. this lessens the evil. while fretting &amp; fuming only serves to increase our own torment. the errors and misfortunes of others should be a school for our own instruction. harmony in the marriage state is the very first object to be aimed at. nothing can preserve affections uninterrupted but a firm resolution never to differ in will, and a determination in each to consider the love of the other as of more value than any object whatever on which a wish has been fixed. how light in fact is the sacrifice of any other wish, when weighed against the affections of one with whom we are to pass our whole life. and though opposition in a single instance will hardly of itself produce alienation; yet every one has their pouch into which all these little oppositions are put: while that is filling, the alienation is insensibly going on, &amp; when filled, it is complete. it would puzzle either to say why; because no one difference of opinion has been marked enough to produce a serious effect by itself. but he finds his affections wearied out by a constant stream of little checks &amp; obstacles. other sources of discontent, very common indeed, are the little cross purposes of husband &amp; wife in common conversation, a disposition in either to criticise &amp; question whatever the other says, a desire always to demonstrate &amp; make him feel himself in the wrong, &amp; especially in company. nothing is so goading. much better therefore, if our companion views a thing in a light different from what we do, to leave him in quiet possession of his view. what is the use of rectifying him if the thing be unimportant; &amp; if important let it pass for the present, &amp; wait a softer moment, and more conciliatory occasion of revising the subject together. it is wonderful how many persons are rendered unhappy by inattention to these little rules of prudence.I have been insensibly led, by the particular case you mention, to sermonize to you on the subject generally. however if it be the means of saving you from a single heart-ache, it will have contributed a great deal to my happiness. but before I finish the sermon, I must add a word on economy.

adage is that “It is better to drive  
your business than to let your busi­  
ness drive you,” better to be a master  
and manager of your own business  
than to be its slave and victim. This  
is the essence of the Franklin cent  
motto, and, whether acknowledged in  
so many words or not, it is the actua­  
ting principle and the underlying  
cause of all business management  
and business success.  
  
How to Live Happily in the Married  
Stale.  
New York Sun.  
Harmony in the married state is the  
first thing to be aimed at. Nothing  
can preserve affections uninterrupted  
but a firm resolution not to differ in  
will, and determination in each to  
consider the love of the other of more  
value than any object whatever on  
which a wish had been fixed. How  
light, in fact, is the sacrifice of any  
other wish, when weighed against the  
affections of one with who we are to  
pass our whole life! And though op­  
position in a single instance hardly  
of itself produce alienation, yet every­  
one h:ts his pouch, into which all  
these little oppositions are put while  
this is filling the alienation is insen­  
sibly going on, and when filled it is  
complete—it would puzzle anyone to  
say why; because no difference of  
opinion has. been marked enough to  
produce any serious effect by itself.  
Other causes of discontent, very com­  
mon indeed, are the little cross-pur­  
poses of husband and wife in common  
conversations disposition in either  
to criticise and question whatever one  
says, a desire alway to demonstrate,  
and make him feel in the wrong, es­  
pecially in company. Nothing is so  
goading. It is much better, therefore  
if our companion views a thing in a  
different light from what we do to  
leave him in the quiet possession of  
his views. What is the use of rectify­  
ing him if the thing be unimportant:  
Let it pass for the present and wait a  
soft moment, a more conciliatory oc­  
casion of rehearsing the subject to­  
gether. It is wonderful how many  
persons are rendered unhappy by in­  
attention to these rules of prudence.

Some people like long, big names

position in a single instance hardly  
of itself produce alienation, yet every­  
one has his pouch, into which all  
these little oppositions are put while

sibly going on, and when filled it is  
complete—it would puzzle anyone to  
say why; because no difference of  
opinion has been marked enough to  
produce any serious effect by itself.  
Other causes of discontent, very com­  
mon indeed, are the little cross-pur­  
poses of husband and wife in common  
conversation; a disposition in either  
to criticise and question whatever one  
says, a desire always to demonstrate,  
and make him feel in the wrong, es­  
pecially in company. Nothing is so  
goading. It is much better, therefore  
if our companion views a thing in a  
different light from what we do to  
leave him in the quiet possession of  
his views. What is the use of recti ty­  
ing him if the thing be unimportant ?  
Let it pass for the present and wait a  
soft moment, a more conciliatory oc­  
casion of rehearsing the subject to­  
  
gether. It is wonderful how many  
persons are rendered unhappy by n­

Harmony in the Family.  
Harmony in the married state is the  
first thing to be striven for. Nothing  
can preserve the affections uninterrupt  
ed but firm resolution never to differ in  
will and a determination in each to  
consider the love of the other of more  
value than any object whatever on  
which the wish had been fixed. How  
light, in fact, is the sacrifice of any  
other wish when weighed against the  
affections of one with whom we are to  
pass our whole life. And no opposi  
tion in a single instance will hardly in  
itself produce alienation, yet every one  
has his pouch into which all these lit­  
tle oppositions are put, and while this  
is filling, the alienation is insensibly  
going on, and when filled it is com  
plete. It would puzzle either to say  
why, because no one difference of opin  
ion has been marked enough to pro  
duce a serious effect by itself. But he  
or she finds his or her affections wea­  
ried out by a constant stream of little  
checks and obstacles.  
Other sources of discontent, very  
common indeed, are the little cross  
purposes of husband and wife in com  
mon conversation; a disposition in  
either to criticise and question what  
ever the other says; a desire to always  
demonstrate and make him feel him  
self in the wrong, especially in sym  
pathy. Nothing is so goading on the  
part of either. Much better, therefore,  
if our companion views a thing in  
light different from what we do, to  
leave him in quiet possession of his  
view. What is the use of rectifying  
him if the thing be unimportant? And  
if important, let it pass for the present  
and wait for a softer moment and more  
conciliatory occasion of revising the  
subject together. It is wonderful how  
ny persons are rendered unhappy  
by inattention to these simple rules of  
prudence.- Thomas Jefferson.
