Letter 5.  
N. 8.  
St: Petersburg 6. October 1811.  
  
We were considering the Bible in its historical character, and as the history of a Family—From the moment when the universal History finishes, that of Abraham begins, and thenceforward it is the history of a family of which Abraham is the first and Jesus Christ the last person. And from the first appearance of Abraham, the whole history appears to have been ordered from age to age expressly to prepare for the appearance of Christ upon Earth.—The history begins by the first and mildest trial of Abraham’s obedience, and the promise as a reward of his fidelity, that in him all the families of the Earth should be blessed.—The second trial, that which required the sacrifice of his Son, was many years afterwards and the promise was then more explicit and more precisely assigned as the reward of his obedience.—There were between these periods two intermediate occasions, recorded in the 15th: and 18th: Chapters of Genesis, on the first of which the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision—and promised him that he should have a child from whom a great and mighty Nation should proceed, which after being in servitude four hundred years in a strange land, should become possessors of the land of Canaan from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates.—On the second the Lord appeared to him and to his wife Sarah; repeated the promise that they should have a child, that Abraham should “surely become a great and mighty Nation and that all the nations of the earth should be blessed in him.” For I know him (said the Lord) that he will “command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment: that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.”—From all which it appears obvious that the first of these promises was made as subservient and instrumental to the second; that the great and mighty Nation was to be raised, as the means in the ways of God’s Providence, for producing the sacred person of Jesus Christ, through whom the perfect sacrifice of atonement for the original transgression of man should be consummated, by which all the families of the Earth should be blessed.  
I am so little versed in controversial divinity, that I know not whether this 18th: Chapter of Genesis has ever been adduced as an argument in support of the Doctrine of the Trinity—There is at least in it an alternation of the three divine persons and of one, not a little remarkable and which I know not how to explain—If taken in connection with the 19th: Chapter it would seem that one of the three men, entertained by Abraham was God himself, and that the other two were angels, sent by God to destroy Sodom—Leaving this however let me ask your particular attention to the reason assigned by God for bestowing such extraordinary blessings upon Abraham—It unfolds to us the first and most important part of the superstructure of moral principles erected upon the foundation of obedience to the Will of God—The rigorous trials of Abraham’s Obedience, mentioned in this and my last Letter were only tests to ascertain his character in reference to the single and I may say abstract point of Obedience—Here we have a precious gleam of light disclosing what the Nature of this Will of God was—that he should command his children and his household after him—by which the parental authority to instruct and direct his descendents in the way of the Lord, was given him as an authority and enjoined upon him as a duty; and the lessons which he was thus empowered and required to teach his posterity were to do Justice and Judgment—This as Obedience to the Will of God is the first and all comprehensive Virtue taught in the Bible, so the second is Justice and Judgment towards Mankind, and this is exhibited as the result naturally flowing from the other.—In this same chapter too is related the intercession of Abraham with God, for the preservation of Sodom from Destruction—The City was destroyed for its crimes, but the Lord promised Abraham that the whole City should be spared if in it only ten righteous men should be found. The principle of mercy was therefore sanctioned in immediate connection with that of Justice—  
Abraham had several children, but the great promises of God were to be performed through Isaac alone; and of the two sons of Isaac, Jacob the youngest only was selected for the foundation of the sacred family and Nation—It was from Jacob that the multiplication of the family began, and his twelve Sons were all included in the genealogy of the tribes which afterwards constituted the Jewish People—Ishmael; the Children of Abraham by Keturah, and Esau the eldest son of Isaac, were all the Parents of considerable families, which afterwards spread into Nations, but they formed no part of the chosen People, and their History as well as that of other neighbouring Nations, is only incidentally noticed in the Bible so far as they had relations of intercourse or of hostility with the People of God.  
The history of Abraham and his descendants to the close of the Book of Genesis, is a biography of individuals—The incidents related of them are all of the class belonging to private and domestic life—Joseph indeed became a highly distinguished public character in the land of Egypt, and it was through him that his father and all his brothers were finally settled there; which was necessary to prepare for the existence of their posterity as Nation; and to fulfill the purpose which God had announced to Abraham, that they should be four hundred years, dwelling in a strange land.—In the lives of Abraham—Isaac—Jacob, and Joseph many miraculous Events are recorded; but all those which are spoken of as having happened in the ordinary course of human affairs, have an air of reality about them which no invention could imitate.—In some of the transactions related, the conduct of the patriarchs is highly blameable; circumstances of deep depravity are particularly told of Reuben—Simeon, Levi and Judah, upon which it is necessary to remark that these actions are never spoken of with approbation; but always with strong marks of censure, and generally with a minute account of the punishment which followed upon the transgression. The vices and crimes of the patriarchs are sometimes alledged as objections against the belief, that persons guilty of them should ever have been specially favoured by God; but vicious as they were there is every reason to be convinced that they were less so than their cotemporaries—Their vices appear to us at this day gross, disgusting and atrocious; but the written Law was not then given—the boundaries between right and wrong were not defined with the same precision, as in the Tables, given afterwards to Moses—The law of Nature was the only guide of morality by which they could be governed, and the sins of intemperance of every kind, recorded in Holy Writ, were at that period less aggravated than they would have been in after ages, because they were in a great measure sins of ignorance—  
From the time when the sons of Jacob were settled in Egypt, untill the completion of the four hundred years during which God had foretold to Abraham that his family should dwell there, there is a chasm in the scared History—We are expressly told that “all the souls of the house of Jacob which came into Egypt were three score and ten”Gen: 46-26. and Exod. 1.5.—It is then said, that Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation—after which nothing further is related of their posterity than that they were fruitful, and increased abundantly; and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them, untill there “arose up a new king, which knew not Joseph.”—On his first settlement in Egypt Jacob had obtained the grant from Pharaoh of the Land of Goshen, a place peculiarly suited to the pasturage of flocks—Jacob and his Sons were shepherds, and this circumstance was in the first instance the occasion upon which that separate spot was assigned to them, and secondarily was the means provided by God, for keeping distinct and separate two Nations thus residing together—Every shepherd was an abomination to the Egyptians—and the Israelites were shepherds—Although dwelling in the land of Egypt therefore, the Israelites were Sojourners and strangers; and by a mutual antipathy toward one Another, originating in their respective conditions of life, they were prevented from intermingling together by marriage, and losing their distinctive characters—This was the cause which had been reserved by the Supreme Creator, during the space of three generations, and more than four Centuries, as the occasion for eventually bringing them out of the land.—For in proportion as they multiplied, it had the tendency to excite the Jealousies and fears of the Egyptian king as actually happened—Those Jealousies and fears, suggested to the king of Egypt a policy of the most intolerable oppression, and the most execrable cruelty towards the children of Israel—Not content with reducing them to the most degraded condition of servitude, and making their lives bitter with hard bondage, he conceived the project of destroying the whole race of them by ordering all the male children to be murdered immediately after they were born—In the wisdom of Providence this very command was the means of preparing the family, thus multiplied into a Nation, for their issue from Egypt, and for their conquest of the land which had been promised to their ancestor Abraham; and it was at the same time the immediate occasion of raising up the great Warrior, Legislator and Prophet who was to be their deliverer, and leader—Henceforth they are to be considered as a People, and their History as that of a Nation.  
During a period of more than a thousand years, the Bible gives us a particular account of their destinies—An outline of their Constitution, civil, ecclesiastical and military, with the code of laws prescribed to them by the Deity, is contained in the Books of Moses, and will afford us copious materials for future meditation—Their subsequent revolutions of Government, under Joshua—fifteen successive chiefs denominated Judges, and a succession of kings, untill they were first dismembered into two separate kingdoms, and after a lapse of some centuries both conquered by the Assyrians and Babylonians, and after but at the end of seventy years, partially restored to their Country and their Temple—constitute the remaining historical Books of the Old Testament—Every part of them is full of instruction—But my present purpose is only to point your attention to their general historical character.—My next letter will contain a few remarks on the Bible, as containing a system of morals—In the meantime I remain your affectionate father,

ir iv.  
e ie in it histo  
character, and as the history of a family. Fromt  
moment when the universal history finishes, th  
of Abraham begins, and thenceforth it is the   
tory of a family of which Abraham is the firt  
and Jesus Christ the last person, and from the i  
appearance of Abraham, the whole history appes  
to have been ordered from age to age expressly  
prepare for the appearance of Christ upon earth  
story begins with the first and mildest tri  
of Abrsham&#x27;s obedience, and the promise as rewa  
 that in him all the families of the  
earth should be blessed.&quot; The second trial, which  
sacrifice of his son, was many years  
terward, and the promise was more explicit, ar  
more precisely assigned as the reward of hiso  
There were between these periods two inte  
mediate occasions, recorded in the 15th and is  
chapters of Genesis--on the first of which the wor  
of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision and pror  
ised him he should have a child, from whom a gres  
and mighty nation should proceed, which, after h  
ing in servitude 400 years in a strange land, shoul  
become the possessors of the land of Canaan fro  
that of Egypt to the river Euphrates. On th  
second, the Lord appeared to him and his wif  
repeated the promise that they should have  
shild, that &quot;Abraham should surely become a gres  
nation, and that &quot;all the nations of the earth shoul  
be blessed in him,&quot; &quot;for I know him, saith the Lor  
that he will command his household after him an  
that they will keep the way of the Lord to   
justice and judgment, that the Lord may brin  
upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him:  
from all which it is obvious that the first of the  
promises was made as subservient and instrumer  
tal to the second-that the great and mighty natic  
was to be raised as the means in the ways of God  
providence for producing the sacred person  
Jesus Christ, through whom the perfect sacrifit  
of atonement for the original transgression of ma  
should be consummated, and by which &quot;all th  
families of the earth should be blessed.&quot; I ams  
little versed in controversal divinity that I knov  
not whether this xvilith chapter of Genesis has eve  
been adduced in support of the doctrine of Trinity  
there is at least in it an alteration of those divin  
persons, and of one not a little remarkable whic  
I know not how to explain; if taken in connectior  
with the 19th, it would seem that one of the mer  
entertained by Abraham, was God himself, and the  
other two were angels, sent to destroy Sodom  
Leaving this, however, let me ask your particulal  
attention to the reason assigned by God for be  
stowing such extraordinary blessings upon Abra  
ham. It unfolds to us the first and most importar  
part of the superstructure of moral principle  
erected upon the foundation of obedience to th  
will of God. The rigorous trials o fAbraham&#x27;s obe  
dience mentioned in this, and my last letter, were  
only tests to ascertain his character in referencet  
the single, and I may say abstract point of obe  
dience, here we have a precious gleam of light  
disclosing what the nature of this will of God&#x27;s  
was, that he should command his children and hit  
household after him; by which the parental an  
thority to instruct and direct his descendants i  
the way of the Lord was given him as an authority  
and enjoined upon him as a duty; and the lesson  
which he was then empowered and required to  
teach his posterity were, &quot; to do justice and judg  
ment.&quot; Thus, Obedience to the Will of God  
is the first, and all comprehensive virtue taught in  
the Bible, so the second is Justice and Judgment  
toward Mankind, and this is exhibited as the re  
sult naturally following from the other. In the  
same chapter is related the intercession of Abra  
ham with God for the preservation of Sodom  
from destruction; the city was destroyed for its  
crimes, but the Lord promised Abraham it should  
be spared if only ten righteous should be found ir  
it the principle of mercy was therefore sanctioned  
in immediate connection with that of justice.  
Abraham had several children; but the great  
promise of God was to be performed  
Isaac alone, and of the two sons of Isaac, Jacob-  
the youngest--was selected for the foundation of  
the second family and nation it was from Jacob  
that the multiplication of the family began, and  
his twelve sons were all included in the genealogy  
of the tribes which atterward constituted the  
Jewish people. Ishmael, the children of Keturab,  
and Esan, the eldest son of Isaac, were all the  
parents of considerable families, which afterward  
spread into nations; but they formed no part of  
the chosen people, and their history, with that of  
the neighboring nations, is only incidentally no  
ticed in the Bible, so far as they had relations  
intercourse or hostility with the people of God­  
The history of Abraham and his discendants to  
the close of the book of Genesis is a biography of  
individaale, the incidents related of them are all  
of the class belonging to domestic life. Joseph  
ladeed, became a highly distinguished public  
character in the land of Egypt, and it was through  
him that his father and all his brothers were  
finally settled there,-which was necessary to pre.  
pare for the existence of their posterity as a na  
tion, and to fulfill the purpose which God had  
announced to Abraham, that they should be four  
hundred years dwellers in a strange land. In the  
lives of Abraham, lsaac, Jacob and Joseph, many  
miraculous events are recorded, but all those which  
are spoken of as happening in the ordinary course  
of human affairs have an air of reality about them  
which no invention could imitate. In s  
the transactions related, the conduct of the patri.  
arche is highly blamable, circumstances of deep  
depravity are particularly told of Reuben, S  
Levi and Judsh, upon which it is necessary to re  
mark that their actions are never spoken of with  
approbation, but always with strong marks of cen  
sure, and generally with a minute account of the  
punishment which followed upon their transgres  
sion. The vices and crimes of the patriarchs are  
sometimes alleged as objections against the belief  
that persons guilty of them should ever have  
been especially favored of God, but, vicious as  
they were, there is every reason to be convinced  
that they were less so than their cotemporaries  
their vices appear to us at this day gross, disgusting  
and atrocious; but the written law was not then  
given, the boundaries between right and wrong  
were not defined with the same procision as in the  
tables given afterward to Moses, the law of Hs  
ture was the only rule of morality by which they  
  
the sins of intemperance, of  
Writ, were at that  
less aggravated than they have been in af  
ter ages, because they were in great measure sins  
the time when the sons of  
lacob were setled in Egypt until the  
ar hundred years, during which o  
I to Abraham that his family shou  
 there is a chasm in the sacred history. We  
are expressly told that all the house of Jacob w  
came into Egypt, were threescore and ten: it is  
said then that Joseph died, as did all that genera  
tion; after which nothing farther is related of  
posterity than that they wee faithful and  
ied abundantly, and waxed ext  
mighty, and the land was filled with them, until  
there arose a new king who knew not Joseph.&quot;  
On his first arrival in Egypt, Jacob had obtained  
a grant from Pharach of the land of Goshen, a  
particularly suited to the pastorage of flocks:  
Jacob and his family were shepherds, and this cir  
 cumstance was in the first instance, the occasion  
upon which that separate spot was assigned to  
them, and, secondarily he was the means provided  
by God for keeping separate two nations thus re.  
siding together; every shepherd was an ab  
s, and the Israelites were  
shepherds, although dwelling in the land of Egypt  
therefore, the Israelites were sojourners and stran&#x27;  
gera, and by mutual antipathy toward ead  
originating from their respective conditions they  
were prevented from intermingling by marriage  
and losing their distinctive characters. This was  
the cause which had been reserved by t  
preme Creator, during the space of three  
tions and more than four centuries, as the oceasion  
for eventually bringing them out of the land, for,  
portion as they multiplied, it had t  
excite the jealousies and fears  
tian king--as actually happened. These  
jealousies and fears, suggested to him a policy of  
le oppression and the most ex­  
crable cruelty toward the Israelites  
with reducing them to the most degrad  
tion of servitude, and making their lives bitter  
conceived the project of  
destroying the whole race, by ordering all the male  
children to be murdered as soon as they were  
born. in the wisdom of Providence, this  
command was the means of preparing this family-  
when they had multiplied into a nation,-for their is  
sue from Egypt, and for their conquest of the land  
which had been promised to Abraham; and it was  
at the same time the immediate occasion of raising  
up the great Warrior, hegislator and Prophet, who  
was to be their deliverer and leader. Then  
they are to be considered as a people and t  
history as that of a nation. During a period of  
more than a thousand years, the Bible gives us a  
particular account of their destinies; an outline of  
their constitution, civil, military and religious  
with the code of laws presented to them by the  
Deity, is contained in the books of Moses, and will  
afford us copious materials for fature consid  
Their subsequent revolutions of government un  
der Joshua, fifteen successive chiefs denominated  
Judges, and a succession of kings, until they were  
first dismembered into two separate kingdoms, and  
after a lapse of some centurles both conquered by  
the Assyrians and Babylonians, and at the end of  
seventy years partially restored to their country  
and their temple, constitute the remaining hise  
torical books of the Old Testament, every part of  
 which is full of instructions. But my present purpose  
is only to point your attention to their general his­  
torical character. My next will contain a few re.­  
marks on the Bible as a System of Morals. In the  
mean time,

LETTER IV. &#x27;  
We were considering the Bible in its histori­  
cal character, and as the history of a family.  
From the moment when the universal history  
&#x27;anishes, that of Abraham begins, and thence­  
forth it is the history ofa family of which Abra­  
ham is the first; and Jesus Christ the last per­  
son; and from the first appearance of Abraham,  
the whole history appears to have baen ordered  
from age to age, expressly to prepare for the ap­  
pearance of Christ, upon - Earth. The history  
begins with the first and mildest trials of Abra­  
ham&#x27;s obedience, and the promise as reward of  
his fidelity, that in &quot;him all the families of the  
earth should be blessed.&quot;. The second trial  
which required the sacrifice of his son, was  
many years afterwards, and the promise was  
more explicit, and more precisely assigned as  
the reward of his obedience. There were, be­  
tween these periods two intermediate occa­  
sions, recorded in the 15th and 28th chapters  
of Genesis on the first of which the word of  
the Lord came to Abraham in a vision, and  
  
promised him he should have a child, from  
whom a great and mighty nation should pro­  
ceed, which, after beiug in servitude 400 years  
in a strange, land, should become the possessors  
of the land of Canaan from that of Egypt to  
the river Euphrates. On the second, the Lord  
appeared to hnn and , his wife, repeated the  
promise that they should have a child, that  
&#x27;Abraham should surely become a great, na­  
tion, and that fall , the nations of the earth  
should be blessed in him,&quot; &quot;for I know him,  
saith the Lord; that he w ill command his  
household after him, and that they will keep  
the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment  
that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that  
which He hath spoken ol him;&quot; from all which  
it is obvious that the first of the promises was  
made as subservient and instrumental to the  
second that the great and mighty nation was  
to be. raised as the means in the ways of God&#x27;s  
providence for producing the sacred person of  
Jesus Christ, through whom the perfect sacri­  
fice of atonement lor the original transgression  
of man should be tonsum mated, and by which  
&quot;all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&quot;  
I am so little versed in controversal divinity  
that 1 know not whether tbisxviiith chapter of  
Genesis has ever been adduced in support of  
the doctrine of Trinity; there is at least in it an  
alteration of those divine persons, and of one  
not a little remarkable which 1 know not how  
to explain; if taken in connection with the  
19th, it would seem that one of the men enter­  
tained by Abraham, was God himself, and the  
other two, were angels, sent to destroy Sod­  
om. Leaving this, however, let me ask your  
particular attention to the reason assigned by  
God for bestowing such extraordinary blessings  
upon Abraham. It unfolds to us the first and  
most important part of the superstructure of  
moral principle, erected upon the foundation tf  
obedience to the will ot God. The rigorous  
trials of Abraham&#x27;s obedience mentioned in  
this, and my last letter, were only tests to as­  
certain his character in reference to the single,  
and I may say abstract point of obedience, here  
we have a precious gleam of light, disclosing  
what the nature of this will of God&#x27;s was, that  
be should command his children and his house­  
hold after him, by which the parental authori­  
ty to instruct and direct his descendants in the  
way of the Lord was given him as an authority  
and enjoined upon him as a duty; and the les­  
sons which he was then empowered and requir­  
ed to teach his posterity were, &quot;to do justice  
and judgment.&quot; Thus, Obedience to the will  
of God, is the first, and all comprehensive vir­  
tue taught in. the bible, so the second is Justice  
and Judgment toward Mankind; and this is  
exhibited as tha result naturally lollowing  
from the other. Ia the same chapter is relat  
ed the intercession of Abraham with God for  
the preservation of Sodom from destruction;  
the city was destroyed for its crimes, but the  
Lord promised Abraham it should be spared if  
only ten righteous should be lound in it: the  
principle of mercy was therefore sanctioned iii  
immediate connection with that of justice.  
Abraham had several children; but the. great  
promise of God was to be performed through  
Isaac alone; and tne two sons ot Isaac, Jacob,  
the youngest was selected for the foundation  
of the second family and nation; it was from  
Jacob that the multiplication of the family bz­  
gan, and his twelve sons were all included in  
the geneaology of the tribes w hich afterward  
constituted the Jewish people. Ishmael the  
children ot Keluiah, and Esau, the eldest sou  
of Isaac, were all the parents of considerable  
families which afterward spread into nations;  
but they formed no part of the chosen people,  
and their history, with that of the neighbor­  
ing nations, is only :ncidentally noticed in the  
Bible, so far as they&#x27; had relations of inter­  
course or hostility w ith the people of God.  
The history of Abraham and his descendants to  
the close of the book of Genesis, is a biography  
of individuals; the incidents related of them  
are all of the class belonging to domestic life.  
Joseph, indeed, became a highly distinguished  
public character in the land of Egypt, and it  
was through him that his father and all his  
brothers were finally settled there which was  
necessary to prepare for the existence of their  
posterity as a nation, and to fulfil the purpose  
which God had announced to Abraham, that  
they should be four hundred years in a strange  
land. In the lives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob  
and Joseph, many miraculous events are re­  
corded, but all those which are spoken of as  
happening in the ordinary course of human af­  
fairs have an air of reality about them, which  
no invention could imitate. In some of the  
transactions related, the conduct , of the patri  
archs is highly bluiri&#x27; able; circumstances of  
deep depravity are particularly told of Reuben,  
Simeon, Levi, and Judah, upon which it is ne­  
cessary to remark that their actions are never  
spoken of with approbation, but always with  
strong marks of censure, and generally with a  
minute account of the punishment which fol­  
lowed upon their transgressions.. The vices  
and crimes of the patriarchs are sometimes al­  
leged as objections against the belief that &#x27;per­  
sons guilty of them should ever have been es­  
pecially favored of God, but, vicious as they  
were, there is every reason to be convinced  
that they were less so than their cotempora­  
ries; their vices appear to us at this day, gross,  
disgustingand atrocious,&#x27; but the written law  
was not then given, the boundaries between  
right and wrong were not defined with the  
same precision as in the tables given after­  
ward to Moses; the law of Nature was the on­  
ly rule of morality by which they could be gov­  
erned, and, the sins of intemperance, of every  
kind recorded in Holy Writ, were at that pe  
riod less aggravated than they have been in af­  
ter ages, because they were in a great measure  
sins of ignorance. From the time when the  
sons of Jacob were settled in Egypt until the  
completion of the four hundred years, during  
which God had foretold to Abraham that his  
family should dwell there, there is a chasm in  
the sacred history. We areexpresaly told that  
all the housed Jacob which came into Egypt,  
were three score and ten; it is said then that  
Joseph died, as did all that generation; after  
which nothing farther is related of their poster­  
ity than that &quot;they were faithful and multipli­  
ed abundantly, and waxed exceeding mighty,  
and the laud was filled with thein, until there  
arose a new king who knew not Joseph.&#x27;&#x27;  
On his first arrival in Egypt, Jacob had ob­  
tained 9 grant from Pharaoh of the land of  
Goshen, a place particularly suited to the pas­  
torage of flocks; Jacob and his family were  
shepherds, and this circumstance was, in the  
first instance,the occasion upon which thatsep­  
a rate spot was assigned to them: a nd, seconda rily ,  
he was the means provided bv God for tmn.  
separate two nations thus residing together;e very  
shepherd was an abomination to the Egyptians,  
and the Israelites were shepherds, although  
dwelling in the land of Egypt; therefore the fs-  
  
raelites wore sojourners and strangers, and by  
mutual antipathy toward each other, originat­  
ing from their respective conditions, they were  
prevented from intermingling by marriage, and  
losing their distinctive characters. This wa  
the cause which had been reserved by the Su­  
preme Creator, during the space of three gener-&#x27;  
ations and more than four centuries, as the oc­  
casion for eventually bringing them out of the  
land; for, in proportion as they multiplied,&#x27; it  
had the tendency to excite the jealousies and  
fears of the, Egyptian kings as actually-, hap­  
pened. 1 &quot;These jealousies and fears suggested  
to him a policy of the most intolerable oppres­  
sion and the most execrable cruelty toward the  
Israelites; not contented with reducing them to  
the most degraded condition of servitude, and  
making their lives bitter with hard bondage, he  
conceived the project of destroying the whole  
race, by ordering all the male children to be  
murdered as soon as they were born. In the  
wisdom of Providence, this very command  
wrasthe means of preparing this family when  
they had multiplied into a. nation for their  
issue fiom Egypt, and for their conquest of the  
land which had been promised to Abraham;  
and it was at the same time the immediate oc­  
casion of raising up the great Warrior, Legisla  
  
tor a.ld Prophet, who was to be their deliverer  
and leader. ... Thenceforth, they are to be con­  
sidered as a people, and their history as that of  
a nation. Daring a period of more than a  
thousand years,&#x27; the Bible give3 us a particular  
account of their destinies: an outline of their  
constitution, civil, military and religous, with,  
the. code of laws presanted to them by the De­  
ity, is contained in the books of Moses, and  
will afford us copious materials for the future  
consideration. Their subsequent &#x27; revolutions  
of government nader Joshua, fifteen, successive  
chiefs, denominated Judges, and a succession  
of kings, Until they were first dismembered in­  
to two separate kingdoms, and after a lapse of  
some centuries, both conquered by the, Assyri­  
ans aiid Babylonians, and at the end of seventy  
years, partially restored to their country and  
their temple, constitute the remaining histori  
cal books of the Old Testament, every part of  
which is full of instructions. J3ut my present  
purpose is only to point your attention to their  
general historical c haracter. My next will con-?  
tain a few remarks on the Bible as a System of  
Morals. . In the meantime,

From the Scir York Jrihune.  
Letters from lion. JolinQ* Adama  
To Ills Sox OX THE BlBLE AM) ITS TEACHING*.  
LETTER IV. .... • ,  
We were considering the Bible in Jts historical  
character, and as the history of a family. r rom  
the moment when the universal histors finishes,  
that of Abraham begins, and thenceforth it is  
the history of a family of which Abraham is the  
first: and Jesus Christ the last person : and lrom  
the first apjH&#x27;arance of Abraham, the whole  
history appears to have been ordered irom age  
to ?ge expressK to prepare for the appearance ol  
Christ upon earth.—The history begins with the  
first and mildest trials of Abraham s obedience,  
and the promise as reward ot his tide.its. that  
in ‘*him all the families of the earln should he  
blessed.” The second trial, which required the  
sacrifice of his son. was many years aftei wards,  
and the promise was more explicit, and moie  
precisely assigned as the reward ot \w$ obedience.  
There were between these periods two^intei medi­  
ate occasions, recorded in the 15th and IMh  
chapter of Genesis—on the first ot which the  
word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision  
and promised him he should have a clu.il, trorn  
whom a great and mighty nation should pro­  
ceed, which after being in servitude 100 \ear&gt;  
in a strange land, should become thej&gt;o»es&gt;on&gt;*  
of the land of Canaan from that of Egypt to the j  
river Euphrates. On the second, the I^or«i ap­  
peared to him and his wife repeated the promise  
that they should have a child -Abraham should  
surely become a great nation, and that -all the  
nations of the earth should he blessed in him.  
  
••fori know him. saith the Ix&gt;ril. to do justice  
and judgment. that the Lord may bring upon |  
Abraham that which He hath spoken ot  
him:&quot; from all which it is obvious that the  
first of the promises was made subser­  
vient and instrumental to the second—that  
the great and mighty nation was to be raised as  
the means in the ways of Hod&#x27;s providence  
for producing the sacred person of .!esu&gt;  
Christ, through whom the perfect sacrifice of  
atonement for the original transgression ot man  
should be consummated., and by which “all the  
families ot the earth should be blessed. I am  
; so little versed in controversial divinity that I  
know not whether this width chapter oi Gene­  
1 sis has ever been adduced in support of the doc­  
! trine of Trinity : there is at least in it an altera­  
tion of those divine persons, and of one not a  
little remarkable which I know not how to e\­  
| plain: if taken in connection with the H*th, it  
would seein that one of the men entertained by  
Abraham, was Hod himseh. and the other two  
were angels, sent to destroy Sodom, heading j  
this, however, let me ask your particular atten­  
tion to the reason assigned by Hod for bestowing  
such extraordinary blessings upon Abraham.  
It unfolds to us the first and most important  
part of the superstructure of moral principle,  
erected uj&gt;ou the foundation of obedience to the  
will of God. The rigorous trials of Abraham s  
obedience mentioned in this, and m&gt; last letter,  
were only tests to ascertain his character in re­  
ference to the single. 1 may say abstract point  
of obedience, here we have a precious gleam ot  
light, disclosing what the nature ot this will ot  
God&#x27;s wa«. that he should command his chil­  
dren and his household alter him: by which the  
paternal authority to instruct and direct his de­  
scendants in the way ot the Lord \\a- given  
him as an authority’and enjoined upon him as  
a duty: and the lessons which he was then  
em|»owered and required to teach Ins {posterity  
were. ‘*todo justice and judgment.&quot; JhusObe­  
dience to the will of Hod: is the first, and all  
comprehensive virtue taught in the Bible, so the  
second is Justice and Judgment towards Man-j  
kind : and this is exhibited as the result natural­  
ly following from the other. In the same chap­  
ter is related the intercession &lt;d Abraham with  
God for the preservation of Sodom from destruc­  
tion : the eit\ was destroyed fur its crimes, hut j  
the Lord promised Abraham it should be spared  
if onlv ten righteous should he louml in it: the  
principle of mercy was therefore sanctioned in  
immediate connection with that of justice.—  
Abraham had several children: hut the great j  
promise of God was to he performed through  
i Isaac alone ami or the two sons of Isaac, Jacob  
1 —the youngest—was elected lor the foundation  
of the second family nation : it was from Jacob  
| that the multiplication of the family began, am!  
liis twelve sons were all included in the geneal­  
ogy of the tribes which alterward constituted  
the Jewish people. Ishmael. the children of  
Keturah. and Ksau. the eldest son ot Isaac, were  
all the parents of considerable families which  
afterward spread into nations: but they formed  
no part of the chosen people, and their history,  
j with that of the neighboring nations, is only  
incidental^ noticed in the Bible. &gt;o jar as they  
had relations of intercourse or hostility with the  
people of God. I In* history oi Abraham and i  
his descendants to tin* close ot the book ot  
Genesis is a biography of individuals: the inci­  
&#x27; dents related of them are ail of the class belong­  
ing to domestic life. Joseph, indeed, became a  
highly distinguished public character in the  
land of Kgypt. and it was through him that his  
father and ail his brothers were finally settled  
there—which wa&lt; necessary to prepare tor the  
existence of their posterity a&gt; a nation, and to  
fulfill the purpose w hich Hod had announced to  
Abraham, that they should be lour hundred  
years d\ve!ler&gt; in a strange land. In the lives  
of Abraham. Isaac. Jacob an 1 Joseph, many  
miraculous events are recorded: but all those  
whichofhumun atiairs have an air of reality  
about them which no invention could imi­  
tate. In some ot the transactions related, the  
conduct of the patriarchs is highly Mamable:  
circumstances of deep depravity are particu­  
larly told of Kueben. Simeon. Levi ami Judah.  
U|»on which it is necessary to remaik that their  
actions are never spoken of with approbation,  
hut always with strong inaiks of censure, and  
generallywith a minute account of the punish­  
ment which followed upon their transgression,  
j The vices and crimes of the patriarchs are some­  
times alleged as objections against the belief  
that persons guilty of them should ever have  
been especially favored of God: hut. vicious as  
they were, there is every reason to he convinced  
that thev were less so than their cotemporaries:  
their vices appear to us at this day gross, dis­  
gusting ami atrocious: hut the written law was  
not then given, the boundaries between right  
and wrong were not defined with the same pre­  
cision as in the tables given afterward to Moses:  
the law of Nature was the only rule of morali­  
ty bv which they could be governed, and the  
sins of intemperance, of every kind recorded in  
Holy Writ, were at that period less aggravated  
than they have been in after ages, because they  
• were in great measures sins of ignorance.  
  
from the time when the sons m J aco were |  
settled in Egypt until the completion ot the tour  
, hundred years, during which &lt; io«i has foretold  
to A b rah am that his family should dwell there,  
there is a chasm in tin* sacred history. Vi e are  
expressly told that all the house ni Jacob which  
came into Egypt, were three score and ten: it  
is said then Joseph died, as did all that genera­  
tion: after which nothing farther is related ot  
their posterity than that “they were faithtul and  
multiplied abundantly, and waxed exceeding.  
mighty, and the land was tilled with them, until  
i there arose a new king who knew not Joseph.  
! On his first arrival in Egypt, Jacob had obtained  
a grant from Pharaoh ot the land ot Goshen, a  
j place particularly suited to the pastorage ot

and this circumstance was. in the first instance,  
the occasion upon which that separate S]&gt;ot was

cause which had been reserved b\ the Supreme  
i Creator, duringthe space of three generations and  
more than four centuries, as the occasion lor  
i eventually bringing them out of the land: lor.  
in proj&gt;ortion as thev multiplied, it had the  
tendency to excite the jealousies and fears  
of the &#x27; Egyptian king—as actually happen­  
ed. These&#x27; jealousies and tears, suggested  
to him a jiolicy of the’most intolerable oppression  
and the most execrable cruelty toward the Is­  
raelites not contented with reducing them to  
the most degraded condition of servitude, and  
making their lives bitter with hard bondage.

had been promised to Abraham, and it was at  
the same tune the immediate occasion of raising  
  
up the great Warrior, legislator &amp; Prophet,  
who was to be their deliverer and leader —  
Thenceforth, they are to be considered as a peo­

dismembered into two separate kingdoms, and  
after a lapse of some centuries both conquered  
by the Assyrians and Babylonians, and at the

j;.... ham v have a Drecioua rleam of light  
  
disclohinjf what the nature of this will of God s  
was, that he ahould command hut children ad  
bis household after him; by which the parental au­  
thority to instruct and direct hi descendant in  
  
the way of the Urd was given ruin aa an auiwt­  
ity and enjoined upon him a a duty: andthe lea-  
  
ons which he was men empowereu auu iu  
to teach lus plenty were, &quot;to do justice and judg­  
ment.&quot; Thu. Obedience to the Will of God i  
the first, aud all comprehensive virtue taught in  
the Bible, so the second ia Justice and Judgment  
toward Mankind; and this is exhibited aa the re­  
tult naturally following from the other. In the  
ame chapter is related the iuterceiou of Abra­  
ham w ith God for the preservation ot Sodom from  
,iinw-ii.m- tha ciiv was destroyed for its crimen.  
  
but the Lord proinied Abraham it should be  
spared if ouly ten righteous ahould be found in it:  
the principle of mercy was therefore aanctioued  
in unmeiuate connectionwith that of justice.  
  
Abraham had several children; but tne greax  
promi of God waa to be performed through  
Uaac alone; and of the two sons of Isaac, Jacob,  
the youngest was selected for the. foundation of  
the raMid family and nation: it aaa from Jacob  
  
that the multiplication of the family began, and  
his twelve aona were all included in the genealogy  
of the tnbes which afterward constituted the J ew­  
ish people. Ishmael, the children uf Keturah,  
and Esau, the eldest son of Laac, were all the  
parenU uf considerable families, which afterward  
spread into nations; but they formed so part of  
the chosen people, aud their history, with that of  
the neiirhlHjnrur nutiona, ia only incidentally no  
  
ticed in the Bible, ao far at they had relations ol  
intercourse or hostility with the people of God.  
The history of Abraham and hi descendants to  
the chxse of the book of Genesis if a biography of  
individual; tlie incident related of them are all  
of the clase belonging to domeotic life. Joseph,  
indeed, became a highly distinguiahjd public  
character in the I nd of Egypt, and it waa through  
hun that his father and all his brothers were fi  
  
nally settled there which waa necesxary to pre­  
pare for the existence of their posterity aa a na-

hundred years dwellers in arrange land. In the  
lives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, many  
miraculous events are recorded, but all those  
which are spoken of as happening in th ordinary  
course of human affairs have an air of reality  
about them, which no invention could imitate.  
In some of tlie transactions related, the conduct  
of the patriarchs ia highly blamable; circumstan­  
ces of deep depravity are particularly told of Reu­  
ben, Simeon, Levi and Judah, upon which it ia  
necessary to remark that their actions are never  
spoken of with approbation, but always w ith  
stron? marks of censure, and generally with a  
  
minute account of the punishment which fol  
  
lowed upon their transgressions Tne vicei  
and crimes of the patriarchs are sometimes al&#x27;  
  
eged aa objection against the belief that per­  
sons euiltv of them should ever have been ea-  
  
neciallv favored of God: but, vicioua aa they  
  
were, there is every reason to be convinced that  
  
they were less so than their eotemporariea: their  
vices appear to us at this day gross, disgusting  
and atrocious; but the written law was not then  
riven, the boundanea between right and wrong  
  
were not defined with the same precision as in the  
  
tablee men afterward to Moses; the Iwotr

period less aggravated than they have been in after  
area, because thev were in a neat measure sin

Jacob were settled in rgypt until the compleuon  
of the four hundred years, during which God had  
foretold to Abraham that his family should dwell

We are considering the Biblain its hie.:   
torical character, and, as the history of a&#x27; lath   
ily. From the moment When the universal   
history -finishes, that of Al r.iltain begins, and   
thenceforth it is -the history of a family of   
which Abraham is the first; and Jesus Mist   
. _the Aust. personitnd Irom-the_appearance- of   
Abraham, the whole history appears to haYe   
been ordered from age to age expressly to   
prepare for the appearance cif Christ upon.   
earth. The history begins witlythe first and   
titildesi trials 81.,Abrahum&#x27;s obedience, and   
the promise as reward of his fidelity. that in   
&quot;film all the families of the earth should be   
blessed2P The second trial which requited.   
the sacrifice of his sontwits many tearalaf­  
terwaal, arid the promise wag-more exilicit,   
and more. precisely assigned as .the reward   
of his ohedirricc. There were between these   
two periods, intermediate occasions, record­  
ed noire 15th and 18th chapters of Genesis   
-on the first of which, the word&quot; of the   
Lord came to Ahralram in a vision and pro­  
mised him he should have a child, froni   
whom a great and mighty nation should pro­  
, coed,. which alter. being in servitude 400   
years in a staugg_land,_should become the   
possessors of the land ol Canaan from that   
of Egyv,..to the liver Euphrates. Ott-the se­  
cond,the-Lord appeared to him and his wife ,   
repeated the promise that they should&#x27;have   
a child, that &quot;Abraham should sorely be­  
come a great natior;&quot; and that “ail the na­  
tions of• the earth should be blessed-in-hint&quot;   
-&quot;Im-l-knowhim, soh the Lord, that he will   
command his household alter him, and that   
they will keep tire wayof the Lord, to do   
justice and judgement, that the Lord may   
bring upon Abraham that which he bath spo­  
ken of him:&quot; hour all which it is obvious   
that the first of the promises was made as   
subservient and instrumental to the second   
—that the great and mighty nntiori‘ilis to he.   
-raiserj—as -the-metros in tire ways of God&#x27;s--  
providence for producing the sacred hereon   
of Jeans Christ, through Whom the perfect   
sacrifice of attonernent for the original trans­  
gresSinn of inati.should be consummated,   
and by which &quot;all the families of the earth   
should be blessed.&quot; I am so little versed   
in connovesial divinity that I know not whe­  
ther-this xvinth chapter of Genesis, has-Over   
beeri.adduceein sub port of the doctrine of   
Trinity,: there is at least in&#x27; ii-an alteration of  
those divine persons, and of one not little   
remarkable which I know not how to ex­  
if taken in connection with the xixtb,   
it would seem that one of the men enter-

tlieother two were angels, sent to destroy So­  
dom. Leaving this, howe.ver, &#x27;let me tisk&quot;   
your particular attention to the reason asrign­  
by God for bestowing srldh etraordinary   
blessings heStowed upon Aithistiarn. h orf4   
folds to us the first and most important part,   
of the superstructure of moral princip e, erec­  
ted upon tile foundation of obedience to the   
will of God. Trif rigorous hints of Abra­  
ham&#x27;, obedience mentioned in this, and my.   
last letter, went only lusts to aseeitain his   
character in uric retire to the ringte, and I   
may say at runlet point of obedience; here   
we hare a precious gleam of light, disclo­  
sing what the Hanna of this will of God&#x27;s   
was, that lie should command his children   
and his household alter hint; by which lhe   
parental authority&quot; to instruct and direct&#x27;his   
descendants in the way of the Lord was gi­  
ven him as an authority and enjoined upon   
him as a duty; and the lessons which lie   
was empowered and required to teach his   
posterity were, &quot;to do justice and judge­  
ment), Thus, obedience to the Will oh God,   
is the first, and all comprehensive vitrpe   
taught in the Bible, so the second is Justicie   
and Judgement toward Alatikind; and this   
is exhibited as the result naturally following   
from :he other. lit the same chaptecis,rela­

LETTER. IV.  
  
We were considering the Bible in ite -histori-  
cal character, and as the history of a family.—  
From the moment when the universal. history  
finishes, that of Abraham begins, and thence-  
forth it is the history of a family of which Abra-  
ham is the first; and Jesus Chfist the last per-  
son; and from the first appearance of Abraham,  
the whole history appears to have been ordered  
from age to age expressly to prepare for the ap-  
pearance of Christ upon earth. The history be-  
gins with the first and mildest trials of Abra-  
ham&#x27;s obedience, and the promise as reward of  
his fidelity, that in “him all the families of the  
earth should be blessed.”” The second trial,  
which required the sacrifice of his son, was many  
years afterward, and the promise was more ex-  
plicit, and more precisely assigned as the re-  
ward of his obedience. There were between  
these periods two intermediate occasions, recor-  
ded in the 15th and 18th chapters of Genesis—  
on the first of which, the word of the Lord came  
to Abraham ina vision and promised him he  
should havea child, from whom a great and  
mighty nation should proceed, which, after be-  
ing in servitude 400 years in a strange land,  
should become the possessors of the land of Ca-  
naan from that of Egypt to the river Euphrates.  
On the second, the Lord appeared to him and his  
wife, repeated the promise that they should have  
a child, that “‘Abraham should surely become a  
great nation, and that ‘‘all the nations of the  
earth should be blessed in him;’”? “for I know  
him, saith the Lord, that he will command his  
household after him, and that they will keep the  
way ofthe Lord, to do justice and judgment,  
that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that  
which He hath spoken of him :” from all which  
it is obvious that the first of the promises was  
  
made as subservient and instrumental to the sec- d  
  
ond—that the great and mighty nation was to  
be raised as the means in the ways of God&#x27;s  
providence for producing the sacred person of  
Jesus Christ, through whom the perfect sacrifice  
of atonement for the original transgression of  
man should be consummated, and by which all  
the families of the earth should be blessed.’’  
  
I am so little versed in controversal divinity  
that { know not whether this xviiith chapter of  
Genesis has ever been adduced in support of the  
doctrine of Trinity ; there is at least in it an al-  
teration of those divine persons, and of one not  
a little remarkable which | know not how toex-  
plain : if taken in connection with the 19th, it  
would seem that one of the men entertained by  
Abraham, was God himself, and the other two  
were angels, sent to destroy Sodom.  
  
Leaving this, however, let me ask your par-  
ticular attention to the reason assigned by God  
for bestowing such extraordinary blessings upon  
Abraham. It unfolds to us the first and most  
important part of the superstructure of morai  
principle, erected upon the foundation of ohedi-  
ence to the will of God. The rigorous trials of  
Abraham’s obedience mentioned in this, and my  
last letter, were only tests to ascertain his char-  
acter in reference to the single, and 1 may say  
abstract point of obedience. Here we have a pre-  
cious gleam of light, disclosing what the nature  
of this will of God was, that he should com-  
mand his children and his household after him ;  
by which the parental authority to instruct and  
direct his descendants inthe way of the Lord  
was given him as an authority and enjoined upon  
him as a duty: and the lessons which he was  
then empowered and required to teach his pos-  
terity were, ‘‘to do justice and judgment.”—  
Thus, Obedience to the Will of God, is the  
first, and al] comprehensive virtue taught in the  
Bible, so the second is Justice and Judgment to-  
ward Mankind ; and this is exhibited as the re-  
sult naturally following from the other. In the  
same chapter is related the intercession of Abra-  
ham with God for the preservation of Sodom  
from destruction : the city was destroyed for its  
crimes, but the Lord promised Abraham it  
should be spared if only ten righteous should be  
found in it: the principle of mercy was there-  
fore sanctioned in immediate connection with  
that of justice. Abraham had several children ;  
but the great promise of God was to be perform-  
ed through Isaac alone, and of the two sons of  
Isaac, Jacob—-the youngest—was selected for  
the foundation of the second family and nation:  
it was fiom Jacob that the multiplication of the  
family began, and his twelve sons were all in-  
cluded in the genealogy of the tribes which af-  
terward constituted the Jewish people, Ishma-  
el, the children of Keturah, and Esao, the  
eldest son of Isaac, were all the parents of con-  
siderable families, which afterward spread into  
nations ; but they formed no part of the chosen  
people, and their history, with thatof the neigh-  
boring. nations, is only incidentaily noticed in the  
Bible, so far as they had relat ons of intercourse  
or hostility with the people of God.  
  
The history of Abraham and his descendants  
to the close of the book of Genesis is a biogra-  
  
hy of individuals : the incidents related of them  
are all of the class belonging to domestic life.—  
Joseph, indeed, became a highly distinguished  
public character in the land of Egypt, and it was  
through him that his father and al] his brothers  
  
were finally settled there—which was necessary  
to prepare for the existence of their posterity as  
a nation, and to falfill the purpose which God  
had announced to Abraham, that they should be  
four hundred years dwellers in a strange land.  
In the lives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Jo-  
seph, many miraculous events are recorded ; but  
all those which are spoxen of as happening in  
the ordinary course of human affairs have an air  
of reality about them which no invention could  
imitate. In some of the transactions related, the  
conduct of the patriarchs is highly blamable;  
circumstances of deep depravity are particalarly  
told of Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah, upon  
which it is necessary to remark that their actions  
are never spoken of with approbation, bat al-  
ways with strong marks of censure, and gener-  
ally with a minute account of the punishment  
which followed apon their transgression. The  
vices and crimes of the patriarchs, are some-  
times alleged as objections against the belief  
that persons guilty of them should ever have  
been especially favored of God ; but, vicious as  
they were, there is every reason to be convinced  
that they were less so than their cotewporaries :  
their vices appear to us at this day gross, dis-  
gusting and atrocious; but the written law was  
not then given, the boundaries between right  
  
there is a chasm in the sacred history. We are  
expressly told that all the house of Jacob which  
came into Egypt, were threescore and ten: it is  
said then that 1 aT died, as did all that gener-  
ation ; after which nothing farther is related of  
their posterity than that ‘‘they were faithful and  
multiplied abundantly, and waxed exceeding  
mighty, and the land was filled with them, until  
there hrose a new king who knew not Joseph.”  
On his first arrival ie Egvpt, Jacob had obtained  
a grant from Pharaoh of the land of Goshen, a  
place particularly, suited to the pastorage of  
flocks : Jacob and his family were shepherds, and  
this circumstance was, in the first instance, the  
occasion upen which that separate spot was as-  
signed to them, and, secondarily, he was the  
means provided by God for keeping separate two  
nations thus residing together: every shepherd  
was an abomination to the Egyptians, and the  
Israelities were shepherds, although dwelling in  
the land of Egypt; therefore, the Israelites  
were sojourners and strangers; and by, mutual  
antipathy toward each other, originating from  
their respective conditions, they were prevented  
from intermingling by marriage and losing their  
distinctive characters. This was the cause  
which had been reserved by the Supreme Crea-  
ter, during the space of three generations and  
more than four centuries, as the occasion for  
eventually bringing them ont of the land ; for,  
in proportion as they multiplied, it had the ten-  
dency to excite the jealousies and fears of the  
Egyptian king—as actually happened. These  
jealousies and fears, suggested to him a policy  
of the most intolerable oppression and the most  
execrable cruelty toward the Israelites: not con-  
tented with reducing them to the most degraded  
condition of servitude, and their lives bitter with  
hard bondage, he conceived the project of de-  
stroying the whole race, by ordering all the  
male children to be murdered as soon as they  
were born. In the wisdom of Providence, this  
very command was the means of preparing this  
family—when they had multiplied into a nation  
—for their issue from Egypt, and for their con-  
quest of the land which had been promised to  
Abraham ; and it was at the same time that the  
immediate occasion of raising up the great War-  
rior, Legislator and Prophet, who was to be  
their deliverer and leader. Thenceforth, they are  
to be considered as a people, and their history as  
that of a nation. During a period of more than  
a thousand years, the Bible gives us a particular  
account of their destinies: an outline of their con-  
stitution, civil, military and religious, with the  
codé of laws presented to them by the Deity, is  
contained in the books of Moses, and will afford  
us copious materials for future consideration. —  
Their subsequent revolutions of government un-  
  
  
  
der Joshua, fifteen successive chiefs denominat-  
ed Judges, and a succession of kings, until they  
  
were first dismembered into two separate king-  
oms, and afier a lapse of some centuries both  
  
conquered by the Assyrians and Babylonians,  
  
and at the end of seventy years partially restored  
to their country and their temple, constitute the  
remaining historical books of the Old Testament,  
every part of which is full of instructions. But  
my present purpose is only to point your atten-  
tion to their general historical character. My  
next will contain a few remarks on the Bible as  
a System of Morals. In the mean time,  
  
I remain your affectionate Fathe

God is the first and all comprehensive virs

the time of Abraham at B.C. 2010. And the date of a very  
important event in the history of Egypt, namely, the overthrow  
of the Shepherd dynasty, is fixed by brugsch, in his interpreta-  
tion of Manetho, to the year B.C. 1706, the starting-point of what  
he considers to be reliable chronology, whereas all previous chro-  
nology must be regarded as more or less conjectural. The fol-  
lowing table, founded on Se ripture testimony, will show a very  
important sy nehronism in the combined histories of Israel and  
Egypt. In the first chapter of Exodus it is recorded that  
‘Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation;” and  
it is added in the verse following, “ Now there arose up a new  
king which knew not Joseph,” evidently implying a marked  
change in the treatment of Joseph’s people at the hands of the  
Egyptians from that which they had formerly received. This  
can only be explained by the great change which must have en-  
sued on the transfer of power from the rule of the foreign Hyesos,  
or Shepherd kings, to that of the native dynasty of the Pharaohs.  
In Exod. vi, 16 the death of Levi, the brother of Joseph, and  
the last surviving member of that generation, as we may fairly  
assume, is recorded at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven,  
and the year before the rise of the new king, which too

narrower than it really is; and you will have  
contributed to increase the difficulties of those,

him,” said the Lord, “that he will command  
his children and his household after him, and  
they shall keep the way of the Lord.”
