6 February 1788]  
To what expedient then shall we finally resort for maintaining in practice the necessary partition of power among the several departments, as laid down in the constitution? The only answer that can be given is, that as all these exterior provisions are found to be inadequate, the defect must be supplied, by so contriving the interior structure of the government, as that its several constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places. Without presuming to undertake a full developement of this important idea, I will hazard a few general observations, which may perhaps place it in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct judgment of the principles and structure of the government planned by the convention.  
In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent, is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people, through channels, having no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some difficulties however, and some additional expence, would attend the execution of it. Some deviations therefore from the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle; first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice, which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them.  
It is equally evident that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not independent of the legislature in this particular, their independence in every other, would be merely nominal.  
  
But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defence must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.  
This policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power; where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other; that the private interest of every individual, may be a centinel over the public rights. These inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the state.  
But it is not possible to give to each department an equal power of self-defence. In republican government the legislative authority necessarily predominates. The remedy for this inconveniency is, to divide the legislature into different branches; and to render them by different modes of election, and different principles of action, as little connected with each other, as the nature of their common functions, and their common dependence on the society, will admit. It may even be necessary to guard against dangerous encroachments by still further precautions. As the weight of the legislative authority requires that it should be thus divided, the weakness of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it should be fortified. An absolute negative, on the legislature, appears at first view to be the natural defence with which the executive magistrate should be armed. But perhaps it would be neither altogether safe, nor alone sufficient. On ordinary occasions, it might not be exerted with the requisite firmness; and on extraordinary occasions, it might be perfidiously abused. May not this defect of an absolute negative be supplied by some qualified connection between this weaker department, and the weaker branch of the stronger department, by which the latter may be led to support the constitutional rights of the former, without being too much detached from the rights of its own department?  
If the principles on which these observ

tution, it will be found, that if the latter does not perfectly correspond with them, the former are infinitely less able to bear such a test.  
There are moreover two considerations particularly applicable to the federal system of America, which place that system in a very interesting point of view.  
First. In a single republic, all the power surrendered by the people, is submitted to the administration of a single government; and the usurpations are guarded against by a division of the government into distinct and separate departments. In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by the people, is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each, subdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a double security arises to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each other; at the same time that each will be controled by itself.  
Second. It is of great importance in a republic, not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers; but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part. Different interests necessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a majority be united by a common interest, the rights of the minority will be insecure. There are but two methods of providing against this evil: The one by creating a will in the community independent of the majority, that is, of the society itself; the other by comprehending in the society so many separate descriptions of citizens, as will render an unjust combination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not impracticable. The first method prevails in all governments possessing an hereditary or self-appointed authority. This at best is but a precarious security; because a power independent of the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major, as the rightful interests of the minor party, and may possibly be turned against both parties. The second method will be exemplified in the federal republic of the United States. Whilst all authority in it will be derived from, and dependent on the society, the society itself will be broken into so many parts, interests and classes of citizens, that the rights of individuals or of the minority, will be in little danger from interested combinations of the majority. In a free government, the security for civil rights must be the same as that for religious rights. It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests, and in the other, in the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on the number of interests and sects; and this may be presumed to depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended under the same government. This view of the subject must particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere and considerate friends of republican government: Since it shews that in exact proportion as the territory of the union may be formed into more circumscribed confederacies or states, oppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated, the best security under the

sequently, the stability and independence of some member of the government, the only other security must be proportionally increased. Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been, and ever will be pursued, until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign, as in a state of nature where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger: And as in the latter state even the stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their condition, to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themselves: So in the former state, will the more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced by a like motive, to wish for a government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be little doubted, that if the state of Rhode-Island was separated from the confederacy, and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under the popular form of government within such narrow limits, would be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities, that some power altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of it. In the extended republic of the United States, and among the great variety of interests, parties and sects which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the whole society could seldom take place upon any other principles than those of justice and the general good: Whilst there being thus less danger to a minor from the will of the major party, there must be less pretext also, to provide for the security of the former, by introducing into the government a will not dependent on the latter; or in other words, a will independent of the society itself. It is no less certain than it is important, notwithstanding the contrary opinions which have been entertained, that the larger the society, provided it lie within a practicable sphere, the more duly capable it will be of self government.

After having fixed the portion of power to be vested in each  
of the distinct governments here spoken of, and settled the  
al character and form of the federal system, the Conven-  
tion had next to undertake the subdivision among distinct and  
separate departments, of the share allotted to that system, so

In conformity to the salutary doctrine advanced in the  
above extracts, the Convention proceeded to model their  
plan in such a way, as to give to each of the three depart-  
ments the means and the desire of self conservation. We  
shall again avail ourselves of the language of the Federalist  
to explain the principles upon which they founded their ar-  
rangements.  
  
“It is not possible,” says General Hamilton, “‘ to give to each department  
an equal power of self-defence. In republican governments the legislative  
authority necessarily predominates. The remedy for this inconvenience is to  
divide the legislature into different branches,—and to render them by dif-  
ferent modes of election and different principles of action, as little connected

We shall adopt their own language, and present their ideas at  
full length, in order that our readers may have the entire  
benefit of the solid maxims which they inculcate. “ It is,”  
says General Hamilton, “of great importance in a republic  
“not only to guard the society against the oppression of its  
“rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the in-  
*¢ justice of the other.  
  
“In a society, under the forms of which the stronger faction, can readily  
unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said toreign, asin a  
state of nature where the weaker individual is not secured against the vio-

state, will the more powerful factions be gradually induced by a like motive,  
  
to wish for a government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well  
as the more powerful.

insecure. There are but two methods of providing against this evil. The  
one by creating a will in the community independent of the majority, that  
is of the society itself, the other by comprehending in the society so many  
separate descriptions of citizens, as will render an unjust combination of  
the whole veryimprobable, if not impracticable. The first method prevails  
in all governments possessing an hereditary or self appointed authority.  
This at best, is but a precarious security, because a power independent of  
the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major, as the right-  
ful interest of the minor party, and may possibly be turned against both  
parties. The second method will be exemplified in the federal republic of  
the United States. Whilst all authority in it, will he derived from, and de-  
pendent on the society, the society itself will be broken into so many parts,  
interests, and classes of citizens, that the rights of individuals, or of the  
minority will be in little danger from interested combinations of the majority.  
In a free government the security for civil rights must be the same as that  
for religious rights. It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests,  
and in the other of the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security in both  
cases will depend on the number of interests and sects, and this may be  
presumed to depend on the extent of country, and number of people com-

hended.* And lastly, they will be tanght that JUSTICE is the  
great end of all good government— and that the federal scheme  
was recommended as especially fitted to secure it.  
  
* Justice is the end of government. — It is the end of civil society. It  
ever has been, and ever will be, pursued, until it be obtained, or until  
liberty be lost in the pursuit. Un a society, ander the forms of which  
the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy  
may as truly be said to reign, as in a state of nature where the weaker  
individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger: And as  
in the latter state even the stronger individuals are prompted by the un-  
certatuty of their condition, to submit to a government which may pro-  
tect the weak, as well as themselves: so in the former state, will the  
more powerful factions be gradually induced by a like motive, to wish  
fora government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as  
the more powerful. Itean be little doubted, that if the State of Khode-  
Island was separated troin the confederacy, and left to itself, the inse-  
curity of nghts underthe popular form of government within such nar-  
row limits, would be displaved by such reiterated oppressions of the  
factious majorities, that some power altogether independent of the  
people, would soon be called for by the voice of the very factions whose  
imsrule had proved the necessity of it. In the extended republic of the  
United States, and among the great varicty of interests, parties, aod  
sects, which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the whole society  
could seldom take place upon any other principles, than those of just.ce  
and the general good: whilst there being thus less danger to a minor  
fromthe will of the major party, there must be less pretext also, to pro-  
vide for the security of the former, by mtroducing into the government  
a will not dependent on the latter: or, in other words, a wall indepen-  
dent of the society itself.”’— Federalist, No. 51.

be subject to nine of those limitations  
implied or expressed in the constitution

importance in a republic, not only to  
guard the society against the oppression  
of its rulers; but to guard one part of  
the nociety against the injustice of the  
other part, Different interests  
necessarily exist ia different classes  
of citizens. If a majority be united by  
trcommon interest, the rights of the  
minority will be insecure. There are but  
two methods of providing against thU  
evil ; the one by creating a will in the  
community, independent of the majority,  
that is of the society itaelf ; tlie  
other by comprehending in the society bo  
many separate description* of citizens,  
aa will render an unjust combination of  
a majority of the whole very improbable,

prevails in all Government* possessing  
an herodiUry or -clf-appointed authority  
? The second method wul be exemplified  
in the federal republic of the United  
SUtea. Whilst all authority in it will  
be derived from and dependent on the  
society, the society itself will be  
broken into so many &#x27;parta, interest*,  
and classes of citizens, that the right  
of individuals or of tlie minority, will  
be in little dsnger from interested  
combinations of majority. In a free  
government the Becurity fur civil  
riglita must lie the same as that for  
religious rights. It consists in the one  
case in tlie multiplicity of interests,  
and in the other in the multiplicity of

“The great security against a gradual concentration of the several  
powers of government in the same hands, consists in giving to the per-  
sons who administer them in one department the necessary constitutional  
means and personal motives to resist encroachments from the others.  
A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control over the  
Government ; but experience had shown to the framers of our Constitu-  
tion the necessity of auxiliary precautions ; and the remedy they adopted  
for the natural predominance of the Legislative authority was the di-  
vision of the Legislative body into two branches, and rendering them,  
by different modes of election and principles of action, as little connected  
with each other as the nature of their common functions and their de-  
pendence on the people would admit.” — p. 49.  
  
The views here briefly expressed are enforced at some length,  
with much cogency of argument.
