g Mrs. Macaulay’s. In the third volume of Hume’s history I find an exact description of the present state of this Country in these few lines.  
“If we consider the antient state of Europe, we shall find that the far greater part of the society were every where bereaved of their personal liberty and lived entirely at the will of their masters. Everyone that was not noble was a slave. The peasants were sold along with the land. The few inhabitants of cities were not in a better condition. Even the gentry themselves were subjected to a long train of subordination, under the greater barons or chief vassals of the crown, who tho’ seemingly plac’d in a high state of splendor, yet, having but a slender protection, of the law, were exposed to every tempest of state, and by the precarious condition in which they lived, paid dearly for the power of oppressing and tyrannizing over their inferiors.”  
Please to give my duty to Mamma whenever you write. I will write to her as often as I can.
