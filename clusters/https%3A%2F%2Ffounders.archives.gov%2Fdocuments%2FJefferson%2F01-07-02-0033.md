The reasoning employed in defence of the doctrine has been “that the cases which require 9 States, being  exceptions to the general authority of 7 States ought to be taken strictly; that in the enumeration of the powers of Congress in the first clause of art. 9. of the Confederation, the power of entering into treaties and alliances is contradistinguished from that of determining on peace and war and even separated by the intervening power of sending and receiving ambassadors; that the excepting clause therefore in which ‘Treaties and Alliances’ ought to be taken in the same confined sense, and in which the power of determining on peace is omitted, cannot be extended by construction to the latter p

I observe in Boinauds Catalogue several pieces on the Duch, the German and the Helvetic. The operations of our own must render all such lights of consequence. Books on the Law of N. and N.

formed and entered into a solemn compact, by which  
they plight and engage the faith of their constituents,

specially enumerated), of sending and receiving ambas-

can be more comprehensive or express, relative to the  
point in question; nor is there offered to my mind the
