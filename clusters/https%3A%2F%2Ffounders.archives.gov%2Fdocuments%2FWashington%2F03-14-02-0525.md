. Be assured the success of the measure is a matter of the most serious moment, and that it ought to be brought to a conclusion, as speedily as possible. The spirit of resigning Commissions has been long at an alarming height and increases dayly Applications from Officers on furlough are hourly arriving—&amp; Genls Heath of Boston, McDougal on the No. River ⟨and Mason,⟩ of Virginia, are asking  
  
what they are to do with the appliants to them. The Virginia line has sustained a violent shock in this instance not less than ninety have resigned already, to me, the same conduct has prevailed among the Officers from the Other States, though not yet to so considerable a degree, and there are but too just grounds to fear, that it will shake the very existence of the Army, unless a remedy is soon, very soon applied. There is none, in my opinion, so effectual, as the one pointed out. This, I trust, will satisfy the Officers, and, at the same time it will produce no present additional emission of money. They will not be persuaded to sacrifice all views of present interest, and encounter the numerous vicissitudes of War, in the defence of their Country, unless she will be generous enough on her part, to make a decent provision for their future support. I do not pronounce absolutely, that we shall have no Army, if the establishment fails; but the Army we may have, will be without discipline, without energy, incapable of acting with vigor, and destitute of those cements necessary to promise success on the one hand, or to withstand the shocks of adversity on the other. It is indeed hard to say, how extensive the evil may be, if the measure should be rejected or much longer delayed. I find it a very arduous task to keep the Officers in tolerable humour and to protract such a combination in quitting the service, as might possibly undo us forever. The difference between our service and that of the Enemy, ⟨is⟩ very striking. With us, from the peculiar—unhappy situ⟨a⟩tion of things, the Officer, a few instances excepted, must break in upon his private fortune for present support, without a prospect of future relief; With them, even, Companies are esteemed so honorable and so valuable, that they have sold of late from 15 to 2200£ sterling, and I am credibly informed, that 4000 Guineas have been given for a troop of Dragoons. You will readily determine how this difference will operate—what effects it must produce. Men may speculate as they will—they may talk of patriotism—they may draw a few examples from ancient story of great atchievements performed by it’s influence; but, whoever builds upon it, as a sufficient basis, for conducting a long and bloody War, will find themselves deceived in the end. We must take the passions of Men, as nature has given them, and those principles as a guide, which are generally the rule of action. I do not mean to exclude altogether the idea of patriotism. I know it exists, and I know it has done much in the present contest. But I will venture to assert, that a great and lasting War can never be supported on this principle alone—It must be aided by a prospect of interest or some reward. For a time it may, of itself, push men to action—to bear much—to encounter difficulties; but it will not endure unassisted by interest.  
The necessity of putting the Army upon a respectable footing, both  
  
as to numbers and constitution, is now become more essential than ever. The Enemy are beginning to play a game, more dangerous than their efforts by arms, tho these will not be remitted in the smallest degree, and which threatens a fatal blow to American independence, and to her liberties of course: They are endeavouring to ensnare the people by specious allurements of peace. It is not improbable they have had such abundant cause to be tired of the war, that they may be sincere, in the terms they offer, which tho far short of our pretensions, will be extremely flattering to minds that do not penetrate far into political consequences; but whether they are sincere or not they may be equally destructive, for to discerning men, nothing can be more evident, than that a peace on the principles of dependance however limited, after what has happened, would be to the last degree dishonourable and ruinous. It is however much to be apprehended, that the idea of such an event will have a very powerful effect upon the country, and if not combatted with the greatest address, will serve at least to produce supineness and disunion. Men are naturally fond of peace and there are symptoms, which may authorise an opinion, that the people of America, are pretty generally weary of the present war. It is doubtful, whether many of our friends might not incline to an accomodation of the grounds held out, or which may be, rather than persevere in a contest for independance. If this is the case, it must surely be the truest policy to strengthen the army and place it upon a substantial footing. This will conduce to inspire the Country with confidence—enable those at the head of affairs to consult the public honor and interest, notwithstanding the defection of some and temporary inconsistancy and irresolution of others, who may desire to compromise the dispute; and if a Treaty should be deemed expedient, will put it in their power to insist upon better terms, than they could otherwise expect.

or promoting the one and avoiding offence to the other, will be a work of great difficulty. Nothing short of Independence, it appears to me, can possibly do. A peace on other terms would, if I may be allowed the expression, be a peace of War. The injuries we have received from the British Nation were so unprovoked—have been so great and so many, that they can never be forgotten. Besides the feuds—the jealousies—the animosities that would ever attend a Union with them—besides the importance, the advantages we should derive from an unrestricted commerce—Our fidelity as a people—our gratitude, our character as men are opposed to a coalition with them as subjects, but in case of the last extremity. Were we easily to accede to terms of dependence, No nation upon future occasions, let the oppressions of Britain be never so flagrant and unjust would interpose for our relief, or at least they would do it with a cautious reluctance and upon conditions most probably that would be hard, if not dishonourable to us.

.  
Before I conclude, there are one or two points more upon which I will add an observation or two. The first is, the indecision of Congress and the delay used in coming to determinations in matters referred to ’em. This is productive of a variety of inconveniences, and an early decision in many cases, though it should be against the measure submitted, would be attended with less pernicious effects. Some new plan might then be tried; but while the matter is held in suspence, nothing can be attempted. The other point is, the jealousy which Congress unhappily entertain of the Army, and which, if reports are right, some Members labour to establish. You may be assured, there is nothing more injurious—or more unjustly founded. This jealousy stands upon the common, received opinion, which under proper limitations is certainly true, that Standing Armies are dangerous to a state—and from forming the same conclusion of the components parts of all, tho they are totally dissimilar in their nature. The prejudice in Other Countries has only gone to ’em in time of peace—and then from their not having in general cases, any of the ties—the concerns or interests of Citizens or any other dependence, than what flowed from their military employ—in short from their being mercenaries—hirelings. It is our policy to be prejudiced against them in time of War—and tho they are Citizens, having all the ties—&amp; interests of Citizens, and in most cases property totally unconnected with the military line. If we would pursue a right system of policy, in my opinion, there should be none of these distinctions—we should all be considered, Congress—Army &amp;c., as one people, embarked in one cause—in one interest; acting on the same principle, and to the same end. The distinction, the jealousies set up, or perhaps only incautiously let out, can answer not a single good purpose. They are impolitic in the extreme. Among Individuals, the most certain way to make a man your Enemy is to tell him, you esteem him such; so with public bodies, and the very jealousy, which the narrow politics of some may affect to entertain of the army in order to a due subordination to the supreme, civil authority, is a likely mean to produce a contrary effect, to incline it to the pursuit of those measures, that may wish it to avoid. It is unjust, because no order of Men in the thirteen States have paid a more sanctimonious regard to their proceedings than the Army; and indeed, it may be questioned, whether there has been that scrupulous adherence—had to them—by any other. for without arrogance, or the smallest deviation from truth it may be said, that no history, now extant, can furnish an instance of an  
  
army’s suffering such uncommon hardships as ours have done, and bearing them with the same patience and Fortitude—To see men without Cloat⟨hes⟩ to cover their nakedness—without Blankets to lay on—without Shoes, by which their Marches might be traced by the Blood from their feet—and almost as often without Provisions as with; Marching through frost &amp; Snow, and at Christmas taking up their Winter Quarters within a days March of the enemy, without a House or Hutt to cover them till they could be built &amp; submitting to it without a murmur, is a Mark of patience &amp; obedience which in my opinion can scarce be parallel’d. There may have been some remonstrances or applications to Congress, in the Stile of complaint from the Army, &amp; slaves indeed should we be if this priviledge was denied—on account of their proceedings in particular instances; but these will not authorise, nor even excuse a jealousy, that they, are therefore aiming at unreasonable powers—or making strides dangerous, or subversive of Civil authority. Things should not be viewed in that light, more especially, as Congress in some cases have relieved the injuries complained of, and which had flowed from their own acts.  
I refer you to my Letter to yourself &amp; Colo. Lee, which accompanies this, upon the subject of money for such of the old Virginia Troops, as have or may reinlist.  
In respect to the Volunteer plan, I scarce know what opinion to give at this time. The propriety of a requisition, on this Head, will depend altogether, on our operations. Such kind of Troops should not be called for, but upon the spur of the occasion, and at the moment of executing an enterprize. They will not endure a long service, and of all Men in the military line, they are the most impatient of restraint and necessary government.

If any one say that he has seen a just man in  
  
want of bread, we answer that it was in some  
place where there was no other just man.  
  
Among individuals, the most certain way to  
  
make a man your enemy, is to tell him you  
esteem him much. So with public bodies.

ington said: No order of men in the  
thirteen States has paid a more sacred  
regard to the proceedings of Congress  
than the army; for without arrogance  
or the smallest deviation from truth, it  
may be sald that no history now extant  
can furnish an instance of an army&#x27;s  
suffering such uncommen hardships as  
ours have done, and bearing them with  
the same patience and fortitude.  
  
&quot;To see men without clothes to cover  
their nakedness, without blankets to  
  
lie on, without shoes, (for the want of  
which their marches might be traced  
by the blood from their feet,) and al­  
most as often without provisions as with  
them, marching through the frost and  
snow, and at Christmas taking up their  
winter quarters within a day&#x27;s march  
of the enemy, without a house or hut  
to cover them till it could be built, and  
submitting without a murmur, is a  
proof of patience and obedience which  
in my opinion can, scarcely be parallel

“If we would pursue a right system of policy, in my opinion, . . .  
we should all, Congress and army, be considered as one people,  
embarked in one cause, in one interest; acting on the same princi-  
ple, and to the sameend. The distinction, the jealousies set up, or  
perhaps only incautiously let out, can answer not a single good pur  
pose. . . . Noorder of men in the thirteen States has paid a more sacred  
regard to the proceedings of Congress than the army; for without  
arrogance or the smallest deviation from truth it may be said, that  
no history now extant can furnish an instance of an army’s suffering  
such uncommon hardships as ours has done, and bearing them with  
the same patience and fortitude. To see men, without clothes to  
cover them, without blankets to lie on, without shoes (for the want  
of which their marches might be traced by the blood from their  
feet), and almost as often without provisions as with them, march-  
ing through the frost and snow, and at Christmas taking up their  
winter quarters within a day’s march of the enemy, without a  
house or hut to cover them, till they could be built, and submitting  
without a murmur, is a proof of patience and obedience, which, in  
my opinion, can scarce be paralleled.”  
  
The horses died of starvation, and the men  
harnessed themselves to trucks and sleds, hauling  
wood and provisions from storehouse to hut. At  
one time there was not a ration in camp. Wash-

of America, and of course to her liberties. They are en-

peace. . . . Nothing short of independence, it appears to  
me, can possibly do. A peace on other terms would, if I  
may be allowed the expression, be a peace of war. The  
injuries we have received from the British were so unpro-

“Before I conclude, there are one or two points more upon which I will  
add an observation or two. The first is the indecision of Congress and the delay  
used in coming to determinations on matters referred tothem. This is productive  
of a variety of inconveniences; and an early decision, in many cases, though it should  
be against the measure submitted, would be attended with less pernicious effects.  
Some new plan might then be tried ; but, while the matter is held in suspense,  
nothing can be attempted. The other point is the jealousy which Congress unhap-  
pily entertain of the army, and which, if reports are right, some members labor to  
establish. You may be assured there is nothing more injurious or more un-

“The distinction, the jealousies set up, or perhaps only incautiously let out, can  
answer nota single good purpose. They are impolitic in the extreme. Among in-  
dividuals the most certain way to make aman your enemy is to tell him that you  
esteem him such. So with public bodies; and the very jealousy which the narrow  
politics of some may affect to entertain of the army, in order to a due subordination  
to the supreme civil authority, is a likely means to produce a contrary effect; to incline  
it to the pursuit of those measures which they may wish it to avoid. It is unjust, be-  
cause no order of men in the thirteen States has paid a more sacred regard to the  
proceedings of Congress than the army; for without arrogance, or the smallest devia-

authorize nor even excuse a jealousy that they are therefore aiming at unrea-  
sonable powers, or making strides dangerous or subversive of civil authority.  
Things should not be viewed in that light, more especially as Congress in some cases  
have relieved the injuries complained of, which had flo wed from their own acts,  
  
“In respect to the volunteer plan, I scarce know what opinion to give at this  
time. The propriety of a requisition on this head will depend altogether on our  
operations. Such kind of troops should not be called for but upon the spur of the  
occasion, and at the moment of executing an enterprise. They will not endure a  
long service; and ofall men in the military line they are the most impatient of  
restraint and necessary government.”

‘* Men may speculate as they will; they may  
talk of patriotism; they may draw examples  
from ancient story of great achievements, per-  
formed by its influence, but whoever builds upon  
it as a sufficient basis for conducting a long and  
bloody war, will find himself deceived in the  
end. We must take the passions of men as nat-  
ure has given them, and those principles as a  
guide which are generally the rule of action. I  
do not mean to exclude altogether the idea of  
patriotism. I know it exists, and I know it has  
done much in the present contest. But I will  
venture to assert that a great and lasting war can  
never be supported on this principle alone. It  
must be aided by a prospect of interest or some  
reward. For a time it may of itself push men to
