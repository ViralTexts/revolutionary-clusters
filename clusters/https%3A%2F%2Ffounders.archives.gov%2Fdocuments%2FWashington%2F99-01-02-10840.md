By an anonymous summons, an attempt has been made to convene you together—how inconsistent with the rules of propriety! how unmilitary! and how subversive of all order and discipline—let the good sense of the Army decide.  
In the moment of this summons, another anonymous production was sent into circulation; addressed more to the feelings &amp; passions, than to the reason &amp; judgment of the Army. The Author of the piece, is entitled to much credit for the goodness of his  
Pen: and I could wish he had as much credit for the rectitude of his Heart—for, as Men see thro’ different Optics, and are induced by the reflecting faculties of the Mind, to use different means to attain the same end; the Author of the Address, should have had more charity,  
than to mark for Suspicion, the Man who should recommend Moderation and longer forbearance—or, in other words, who should not think as he thinks, and act as he advises. But he had another plan in view, in which candor and liberality of Sentiment, regard to justice, and love  
of Country, have no part; and he was right, to insinuate the darkest suspicion, to effect the blackest designs.  
That the Address is drawn with great art, and is designed to answer the most insidious purposes. That it is calculated to impress the Mind, with an idea of premeditated injustice in the Sovereign power of the United States, and rouse all those resentments  
which must unavoidably flow from such a belief. That the secret Mover of this Scheme (whoever he may be) intended to take advantage of the passions, while they were warmed by the recollection of past distresses, without giving time for cool, deliberative thinking, &amp; that  
composure of Mind which is so necessary to give dignity &amp; stability to measures, is rendered too obvious, by the mode of conducting the business, to need other proof than a reference to the proceeding.  
Thus much, Gentlemen, I have thought it incumbent on me to observe to you, to shew upon what principles I opposed the irregular and hasty meeting which was proposed to have been held on Tuesday last: and not because I wanted a disposition to give you every  
opportunity, consistent with your own honor, and the dignity of the Army, to make known your grievances. If my conduct heretofore, has not evinced to you, that I have been a faithful friend to the Army; my declaration of it at this time wd be equally unavailing &amp;  
improper—But as I was among the first who embarked in the cause of our common Country—As I have never left your side one moment, but when called from you, on public duty—As I have been the constant companion &amp; witness of your Distresses, and not among the last to feel,  
&amp; acknowledge your Merits—As I have ever considered my own Military reputation as inseperably connected with that of the Army—As my Heart has ever expanded wth joy, when I have heard its praises—and my indignation has arisen, when the Mouth of detraction has been opened  
against it—it can scarcely be supposed, at this late stage of the War, that I am indifferent to its interests.  
But—how are they to be promoted? The way is plain, says the anonymous Addresser—If War continues, remove into the unsettled Country—there establish yourselves, and leave an ungrateful Country to defend itself—But who are they to defend? Our Wives, our  
Children, our Farms and other property which we leave behind us. or—in this state of hostile seperation, are we to take the two first (the latter cannot be removed) to perish in a Wilderness, with hunger cold &amp; nakedness? If Peace takes place, never sheath your Sword says  
he untill you have obtained full and ample Justice—this dreadful alternative, of either deserting our Country in the extremest hour of her distress, or turning our Army against it, (which is the apparent object, unless Congress can be compelled into an instant compliance) has  
something so shocking in it, that humanity revolts at the idea. My God! What can this Writer have in view, by recommending such measures? Can he be a friend to the Army? Can he be a friend to this Country? Rather, is he not an insidious Foe? Some Emissary, perhaps, from New  
York, plotting the ruin of both, by sowing the seeds of discord &amp; seperation between the Civil &amp; Military powers of the Continent? And what a Compliment does he pay to our understandings, when he recommends measures in either alternative, impracticable in their  
nature?  
But here, Gentlemen, I will drop the curtain; because it wd be as imprudent in me to assign my reasons for this opinion, as it would be insulting to your conception, to suppose you stood in need of them. A moments reflection will convince every  
dispassionate Mind of the physical impossibility of carrying either proposal into execution.  
There might, Gentlemen, be an impropriety in my taking notice, in this Address to you, of an anonymous production—but the manner in which that performance has been introduced to the Army—the effect it was intended to have, together with some other  
circumstances, will amply justify my observations on the tendency of that Writing. With respect to the advice given by the Author—to suspect the Man, who shall recommend moderate measures and longer forbearance—I spurn it—as every Man, who regards that liberty, &amp; reveres  
that Justice for which we contend, undoubtedly must—for if Men are to be precluded from offering their sentiments on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences, that can invite the consideration of Mankind; reason is of no use to us—the freedom of  
Speech may be taken away—and, dumb &amp; silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter.  
I cannot, in justice to my own belief, &amp; what I have great reason to conceive is the intention of Congress, conclude this Address, without giving it as my decided opinion; that that Honble Body, entertain exalted sentiments of the Services of the Army;  
and, from a full conviction of its Merits &amp; sufferings, will do it compleat Justice: That their endeavors, to discover &amp; establish funds for this purpose, have been unwearied, and will not cease, till they have succeeded, I have not a doubt. But, like all other large  
Bodies, where there is a variety of different Interests to reconcile, their deliberations are slow. Why then should we distrust them? and, in consequence of that distrust, adopt measures, which may cast a shade over that glory which, has been so justly acquired; and tarnish  
the reputation of an Army which is celebrated thro’ all Europe, for its fortitude and Patriotism? and for what is this done? to bring the object we seek for nearer? No! most certainly, in my opinion, it will cast it at a greater distance.  
For myself (and I take no merit in giving the assurance, being induced to it from principles of gratitude, veracity &amp; justice)—a grateful sence of the confidence you have ever placed in me—a recollection of the Chearful assistance, &amp; prompt  
obedience I have experienced from you, under every vicisitude of Fortune, and the sincere affection I feel for an Army, I have so long had the honor to Command, will oblige me to declare, in this public &amp; solemn manner, that, in the attainment of compleat justice for all  
your toils &amp; dangers, and in the gratification of every wish, so far as may be done consistently with the great duty I owe my Country, and those powers we are bound to respect, you may freely command my services to the utmost of my abilities.  
While I give you these assurances, and pledge my self in the most unequivocal manner, to exert whatever ability I am possesed of, in your favor—let me entreat you, Gentlemen, on your part, not to take any measures, which, viewed in the calm light of reason,  
will lessen the dignity, &amp; sully the glory you have hitherto maintained—let me request you to rely on the plighted faith of your Country, and place a full confidence in the purity of the intentions of Congress; that, previous to your dissolution as an Army they will cause  
all your Accts to be fairly liquidated, as directed in their resolutions, which were published to you two days ago—and that they will adopt the most effectual measures in their power, to render ample justice to you, for your faithful and meritorious Services. And let me  
conjure you, in the name of our common Country--as you value your own sacred honor—as you respect the rights of humanity, &amp; as you regard the Military &amp; national character of America, to express your utmost horror &amp; detestation of the Man who wishes, under any  
specious pretences, to overturn the liberties of our Country, &amp; who wickedly attempts to open the flood Gates of Civil discord, &amp; deluge our rising Empire in Blood.  
By thus determining--&amp; thus acting, you will pursue the plain &amp; direct Road to the attainment of your wishes. You will defeat the insidious designs of our Enemies, who are compelled to resort from open force to secret Artifice. You will give one  
more distinguished proof of unexampled patriotism &amp; patient virtue, rising superior to the pressure of the most complicated sufferings; And you will, by the dignity of your Conduct, afford occasion for Posterity to say, when speaking of the glorious example you have  
exhibited to man kind, &quot;had this day been wanting, the World had never seen the last stage of perfection to which human nature is capable of attaining.&quot;

part; and he was right to infinnate the darkeft ſuſpic!s  
on to effect the blackeſt deſign. That the addreſs is  
drawn with great art, and is deſigned to anſwer the moſt  
inſidious purpoſes ; that it is calculated to impreſs the:  
mind with an idea of premeditated ivjuſtice in the fo.  
yereign power of the United States, and rouſe alt thoſe  
reſentments which muſt unavoidably Row from ſuch a  
belief; that the ſecret mover of this icherne, whoever he  
may be, intended to take advantage of the paſſions, while  
they were warmed by the recollectien of paſt diſtre ſſes,  
without giving time for cool, deliberative thinking, and  
that compoſure. of mind which is ſo neceſſary to give  
dignity and ſtability” to, meaſures, is rendered too ob-  
vious, by the mode of conducting the buſinefs, to need  
other proof than a reference to the proceedipg. :  
Thus much, gentlemen, I have. thought it incumbent on  
me to obſerve to you, to ſhew upon what principles I op-  
poſed the irregular haſty meeting which was propoſed  
b to have been held on Tueſday laſt, &amp; not becauſe I want  
ed a diſpoſition to give you every opportunity, conſiſtent  
with your own honor, and the dignity of the army, te:  
make known your grievances. If my conduct hereto-  
Fore has not evinced to you, that I have been a faithful  
friend to the army, my declaration of it at this time  
would be equally unavailing and improper. But as 1  
was among the firſt who embarked in the cauſe of our  
common country; as 1 have never left your fide one mo-  
ment, but when called from you on public duty; as I  
have been the conſtant companion and witneſs of your  
diſtreſſes, and not among the laſt to feel and acknow«  
ledge your merits; as I have ever conſidered my own  
military reputation as inſeparably connected with that  
of the army; as my heart has ever expanded with joy,  
when J have heard its praiſes, and my indignation has  
ariſen when the mouth of detraction has been opened  
zgainſt it, it can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed, at this late ſtage  
of the war, that I am indifferent to. its intereſts. But  
how are they to be promoted? The way is plain, ſays:  
the anonymous addreſſer. If war continues, remove  
into the unſettled country; there eſtab}ith yourſelves-.  
and leave an ungrateſul country to deſend itſelf. - But  
who are they to defend? Our wives, our children,  
our farms and other propeity which we leave behind.

Jes © uti} you have obtained full and ample juſtice.”  
  
his ereadful alternative ofeither deſerting our country  
in the extremett hour of her diſtreſs, or turning cur arms  
again it, which is the apparent object, unlets Congreſs  
can be c mpelled into inſtant compliance, has ſomething  
fo thocking in it, that humanity revolts at the idea, My  
God ! what can this writer have in view, by recommen-  
ding ſuch meaſures ? Can he be a friend to the army?  
Can he he a friend to this country ? Rather is he not an  
inſidious foe ? Some emiſſary, perhaps, from New-York,  
plorting the ruin of both, by ſowing the ſeeds of diſcord  
and ſeparation between the civil and military powers of  
the continent? And what a compliment does he pay to  
our underſtandings, when he recommends meaſures, in  
either alternative, impracticable in their nature? But,  
Here, gentlemen, I will drop the curtain, becauſe, it  
would be as imprudent in me to afſign my reaſons for  
this opinion, as it wenld be inſulting to your concepti-  
on to ſuppoſe you food in need of them. A moment&#x27;s  
reflection wiil convince every diſpaſſionate mind of the  
phyſical impoſſibility of carrying either propoſal into  
execution. &#x27;T here might, gentlemen, be an improprie-  
ty in my taking notice, in this addre(s to you, cf an  
anonymous production but the manner in which that  
performance has been introduced to the army, the ef-  
Fect it was intended to have, together with ſome other  
circumſlances, will amply juſtify my obſervations. on  
the rendency of that writing.  
  
With reſpect to the advice given by the author, to  
Cuſpe&amp; the man, who thall recommend moderate mea-  
ſures and longer forbearance, I ſpurn it, as every man  
who regards that liberty and reveres that juſtice for  
which we contend, undoubtealy mult ; for, if men are  
to be precluded from offering FRET ſentiments on a mat-  
ter which may involve the moſt ſerious and alarming

conſequences» **: ſe to u he freed. 71

ing it as my decided opinion, that, that Lonorably body  
entertain exalted ſentiments of the ſervices of the army,  
and from a full conviction of its merits and ſufferings, |  
will do it complete juſtice : that their endeavours to  
diicover and ettabliih funds for this purpoſe have been  
unwearied, and will not ceale till they have ſucceeded,  
2 have not a doubt.  
  
But, like all other large bodies, where there is a va-  
riet v of different in tereſts to reconcile, their deter miu, i.

And in conſcquence of that diſtruſt, adopt mou  
which may caſt a thade over that glory which ths bee  
to juſtly acquired,audgarnith the reputation of an ar in  
which is celebrated through ali Europe for its fortitude  
and patristiin: ? And for what is this done? To! bring  
the object we ſ:ek, nearer ? No, moſt certainly, i my  
opialon, it will calt it at a greater dütance. For my-  
ſelf, end I take no merit in giving the aflurance, bein  
induced to it from principles of gratitude, verzcity, _  
juſtice, a grateful ſenſe of the confidence you have ever  
placed in me, a recollection of the cheertul athffance  
and prompt obedience 1 have experienced from you, un-  
der every viciſſitude of fortune, and the ſincert affetion

In the moment of this ſammons; another auonimous  
production was ſent into circulation, addreſſed more to  
the feelings and * paſſions than to the reaſon and judg-

that can invite the conſideration of mankind; reaſon is  
of no uſe to us. The freedom of ſpeech may be taken

is celebrated throngh all Europe for its fortitude and pa-

to us. The freedom of ſpeech may be taken away,  
and durab and filent we may be led, like ſheep to  
the ſlaughter. I cannot in juſtice to my own belief,  
and what 1 have great reaſon to conceive is the in-  
  
tention of Congreſs, conclude this addreſs with-  
dut giving it as my decided opinion, that that  
honourable body entertain exalted ſentiments of the  
ſervices of the army, and from a full conviction of  
its merits and ſufferings, will do it complete juſtice:  
that their endeavours to diſcover and eſtabliſh funds  
for this purpoſe have been unwearied, and will not  
ceaſe till they have ſucceeded, I have not a doubt.  
- But like all other large bodies, where there is a  
variety of different intereſts to reconcile, their de-  
terminations are flow. Why then ſhould we dil.  
truſt them? and, in conſequence of that diſtruſt,  
adopt meaſures which may caſt a ſhade over that  
glory which has been fo juſtly acquired, and tarniſh  
the reputation of an army which is celebrated thro?  
all Europe for its fortitude and patriotiſm? And  
for what is this done? To bring the object we  
ſeek nearer? - No, moſt certainly, in my opinion,  
it will caſt it at a greater diſtance. For myſelf,  
and I take no merit in giving the aſſurance, being  
Induced to it from principles of gratitude, veracity  
and juſtice, a grateful ſenſe of the confidence you  
have ever placed in me, a recollection of the cheer-  
fol aſſiſtance and prompt obedience 1 have experi-  
enced from you, under every viciſſitude of fortune,  
and the ſincere affection J feel for an army I have fo  
long had the honour to command, will oblige me  
to declare in this public and ſolemn manner, that

are bound to reſpe&amp;, you may freely command my  
ſervices to the utmoſt extent of my abilities.  
  
While I give you theſe aſſurances, and pledge  
myſelf in the moſt unequivocal manner to exert  
whatever ability I am poſſeſſed of in your favour,  
  
to take any meaſures which, viewed in the calm  
light of reaſon, will leſſen the dignity and ſully the  
glory you have hitherto maintained. Let me re-  
queſt you to rely on the plighted faith of your coun-  
try, and place a full confidence in the purity of &#x27;the  
intentions of Congreſs, that, previous to your dif-  
ſolution as an army, they will cauſe all your ac-  
counts to be fairly liquidated, as directed in the  
reſolutions which were publiſhed to you tuo days  
ago, and that they will adopt the moſt effect ual  
meaſures in their power to render ample juſtice to  
you, for your faithful and meritorious ſervides.  
And let me conjure you, in the name of our com-  
mon country, as you value your own ſacred honour,  
as you reſpect the rights of humanity, and as you  
regard the military and national character of Ame-  
rica, to expreſs your utmoſt horror and deteſtation  
of the man who wiſhes, under any ſpecious pre-  
tences, to overturn the liberties of our country, and  
who wickedly attempts to open the flood-gartes&#x27; of  
civil diſcord, and deluge our riſing empire in blood.  
By thus determining and thus acting, you will  
purſue the plain and direct road to the attainment  
of your wiſhes ; you will defeat the inſidious deſigns  
of our enemies, who are compelled to reſort from  
open f6tce to ſecret. artifice; you will give one  
more diſtinguiſhed proof of unexampled parriotilm :  
and patient virtue, riſing ſuperior to the preſſure of

Ia the mement of this fummens, enother anosy­

more 0 the feelings 2xd paflides than to the reason  
and judgment of the army. The author of the piece  
is intitled 1o much credit for the goodness of his  
pen ; and I could with he had a 8 much credit for the  
re&amp;titude of his heart ; for, as men {es through diffi­

the mind, to ofe different means 1 attaia the fame  
ead, the tuthor of the pizce should have had inore  
charity thas to mark for fulpicion, the man who  
thould recommead moderation and lorger forbear­  
ance, or M other words, whe thould not thick as he  
thinks, and a&amp;t as he advises. But he had 2aother  
plan in view, in which candour and liberality es sen­  
timent, regard to justice ard love of country have =o  
part; and he was sight to infizuate the darkest sus­  
picions to e&#x27;te@ the blacksft designs. That the ad­  
dress is drawn with great art ; that it is intendad to  
answer the mofk iafidious pu-pofes ; thatitisintended  
to imprels the mind witk an idea, of premeditated  
injustice in the fovercign powsr of the United States,  
ard rouse alt thoferefeniments which must unavoid­  
ably flow from such a belief; that the firk mover of  
this {chems, whoever he sy be, intended to take  
zdvantage of the pafiicns, while they wers warmed  
srith th®&#x27;tecolicllion of pait diltrefles, without giving  
time for ceol, delitverate thinkivg, and that compo­

stability to mesfures, is rendered 100 obvicus, by the  
fhode of conduting the business, 10 need other proof  
than &amp; refersnce iothe proceeding.  
Thus much, gentlemen, I have thoeght it incum­

prieciples I opposed the hafly, irregulsr mesting  
which was propoled to be held on Tuelday laßt, and  
not beeaule [ wanted a difpofi-ion to give you every  
opportefty, consistent with your own honer, and ths

If my conda® hereiofore, has not evinced 10 you,that  
I have beea a faithful friead to the army, my dezla­

design “to impress the mind with an  
idea of premeditated injustice in the  
sovereign power of the United States,  
and rouse all those resentments which  
must unavoidably flow from such a be-  
lief,” the speaker entered on a personal  
appeal to his hearers: “If my conduct  
heretofore has not evinced to you that I  
have been a faithful friend of the army,  
my declaration of it at this time would  
be equally unavailing and improper.  
But, as I was the first who embarked in  
the cause of our common country, as I  
have never left your side one. moment  
but when called from you on public  
duty, as I have been the constant com-  
panion and witness of your distresses,  
and not among the last to feel and ac-  
knowledge your merits, as I have ever  
considered my own military reputation  
as inseparably connected with that of  
the army, as my heart has ever ex-  
panded with joy when I have heard its  
praises, and my indignation has arisen  
when the mouth of detraction has been  
opened against it, it can scarcely be sup-  
posed at this last stage of the war that  
I am indifferent to its interests. But  
how are they to be promoted? ‘The  
way is plain,’ says the anonymous ad-  
dresser. ‘If war continues, remove into  
the unsettled country; there establish  
yourselves, and leave an ungrateful  
country to defend itself.’ But who are  
they to defend? our wives, our children,  
our farms, and other property which we.  
leave behind us? or, in this state of hos-  
tile separation, are we to take the two  
first (the latter cannot be removed) to  
perish in a wilderness with eold, hunger,  
and nakedness? ‘If .peace takes place,’  
says he, ‘never sheathe your swords  
until you have obtained full and ample  
justice.’  
  
“This dreadful alternative of either  
deserting our country in the extreme  
hour of her distress, or turning our  
arms against it, which is the apparent  
object, unless Congress can be compelled  
into instant compliance, has something  
so shocking in it that humanity revolts  
at the idea. My God! What can this
