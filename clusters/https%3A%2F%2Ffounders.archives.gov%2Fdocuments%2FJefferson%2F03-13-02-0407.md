ca. 4 Dec. 1818  
  
Our revolutionary process, as is well known, commenced by petitions, memorials, remonstrances Etc from the old Congress. these were followed by a non-importation agreement, as a pacific instrument of coercion. while that was before us, and sundry exceptions, as of arms, ammunition Etc were moved from different quarters of the house, I was sitting by Dr Franklin and observed to him that I thought we should except books: that we ought not to exclude science, even coming from an enemy. he thought so too, and I proposed the exception, which was agreed to. soon after it occurred that medecine should be excepted, &amp; I suggested that also to the Doctor. ‘as to that, said he, I will tell you a story. when I was in London, in such a year, there was a weekly club of Physicians, of which Sr John Pringle was President, and I was invited by my friend Dr Fothergill to attend when convenient. their rule was to propose a thesis one week, and discuss it the next. I happened there when the question to be considered was Whether Physicians had, on the whole, done most good or harm? the young members, particularly, having discussed it very learnedly and eloquently till the subject was exhausted, one of them observed to Sr John Pringle, that altho’ it was not usual for the President to take part in a debate, yet they were desirous to know his opinion on the question. he said, they must first tell him whether, under the appellation of Physicians, they meant to include old women; if they did, he thought they had done more good than harm, otherwise more harm than good.’  
  
The confederation of the States, while on the carpet before the old Congress, was strenuously opposed by the smaller states, under apprehensions that they would be swallowed up by the larger ones. we were long engaged in the discussion; it produced great heats, much ill humor, and intemperate declarations from some members. Dr Franklin at length brought the debate to a close with one of his little apologues. he observed that ‘at the time of the Union of England &amp; Scotland, the Duke of Argyle was most violently opposed to that measure, and among other things predicted that, as the whale had swallowed Jonas, so England Scotland would be swallowed by England. however, said the Doctor, when Ld Bute came into the government, he soon brought into it’s administration so many of his countrymen that it was found, in event that Jonas swallowed the whale.’ this little story produced a general laugh, restored good humor, &amp; the Article of difficulty was passed.  
  
  
When Dr Franklin went to France, on his revolutionary mission, his eminence as a philosopher, his venerable appearance, and the cause on which he was sent, rendered him extremely popular. for all ranks and conditions of men there, entered warmly into the American interest. he was therefore feasted and invited to all the court parties. at these he some times met the old Dutchess of Bourbon, who being a chess player of about his force, they very generally played together. happening once to put her king into prise, the Doctr took it. ‘ah, says she, we do not take kings so,’ ‘we do in America,’ said the Doctor.  
  
At one of these parties, the emperor Joseph II then at Paris, incog. under the title of Count Falkenstein, was overlooking the game, in silence, while the company was engaged in animated conversations on the American question. ‘how happens it, M. le Comte, said the Dutchess, that while we all feel so much interest in the cause of the Americans, you say nothing for them?’ ‘I am a king by trade,’ said he.  
  
When the Declaration of Independance was under the consideration of Congress, there were two or three unlucky expressions in it which gave offence to some members. the words ‘Scotch and other foreign auxiliaries’ excited the ire of a gentleman or two of that country. severe strictures on the conduct of the British king, in negativing our repeated repeals of the law which permitted the importation of slaves, were disapproved by some Southern gentlemen, whose reflections were not yet matured to the full abhorrence of that traffic. altho’ the offensive expressions were immediately yielded, these gentlemen continued their depredations on other parts of the instrument. I was sitting by Dr Franklin who percieved that I was not insensible to these mutilations. ‘I have made it a rule, said he, whenever in my power, to avoid becoming the draughtsman of papers to be reviewed by a public body. I took my lesson from an incident which I will relate to you. when I was a journeyman printer, one of my companions, an apprentice Hatter, having served out his time, was about to open shop for himself. his first concern was to have a handsome sign-board, with a proper inscription. he composed it in these words ‘John Thompson, Hatter, makes and sells hats. for ready money,’ with a figure of a hat subjoined. but he thought he would submit it to his friends for their amendments. the first he shewed it to thought the word ‘Hatter,’ tautologous, because followed by the words ‘makes hats’ which shew he was a Hatter. it was struck out. the next observed that the word ‘makes’ might as well be omitted, because his customers would not care who made the hats. if good &amp; to their mind, they would buy, by whomsoever made. he struck it out. a third said he thought the words ‘for ready money,’ were useless as it was not the custom of the place to sell on credit. every one who purchased expected to pay. they were parted with, and the inscription now stood ‘John Thomson sells hats.’ ‘sells hats’ says his next friend? why nobody will expect you to give them away. what then is the use of that word? it was stricken out, and ‘hats’ followed it, the rather, as there was one painted on the board. so his inscription was reduced ultimately to ‘John Thomson’ with the figure of a hat subjoined.’  
  
The Doctor told me, at Paris, the two following anecdotes of the Abbe Raynal. he had a party to dine with him one day at Passy, of whom one half were Americans, the other half French  &amp; among whom the last was the Abbé. during the dinner he got on his favorite theory of the degeneracy of animals, and even of man, in America, and urged it with his usual eloquence. the Doctor at length noticing the accidental stature and position of his guests, at table, ‘come, says he, M. l’Abbé, let us try this question by the fact before us. we are here one half Americans, &amp; one half French, and it happens that the Americans have placed themselves on one side of the table, and our French friends are on the other. let both parties rise, and we will see on which side nature has degenerated.’ it happened that his American guests were Carmichael, Harmer, Humphreys and others of the finest stature and form, while those of the other side were remarkably diminutive, and the Abbé himself particularly, was a mere shrimp. he parried the appeal however, by a complimentary admission of exceptions, among which the Doctor himself was a conspicuous one.  
  
The Doctor &amp; Silas Deane were in conversation one day at Passy on the numerous errors in the Abbe’s Histoire des deux Indes, when he happened to step in. after the usual salutations, Silas Deane said to him ‘the Doctor and myself Abbé, were just speaking of the errors of fact into which you have been led in your history.’ ‘Oh no, Sir, said the Abbé, that is impossible. I took the greatest care not to insert a single fact, for which I had not the most unquestionable authority.’ ‘why, says Deane, there is the story of Polly Baker, and the eloquent apology you have put into her mouth, when brought before a court of Massachusets to suffer punishment under a law, which you cite, for having had a bastard. I know there never was such a law in Massachusets.’ ‘be assured, said the Abbé, you are mistaken, and that that is a true story. I do not immediately recollect indeed the particular information on which I quote it; but I am certain that I had for it unquestionable authority.’ Doctor Franklin who had been for some time shaking with restrained laughter at the Abbe’s confidence in his authority for that tale, said ‘I will tell you, Abbé, the origin of that story. when I was a printer and editor of a newspaper, we were sometimes slack of news, and to amuse our customers, I used to fill up our vacant columns with anecdotes, and fables, and fancies of my own, and this of Polly Baker is a story of my making, on one of those occasions.’ ‘Oh very well, Doctor, the Abbé, without the least disconcert, exclaimed with a laugh ‘Oh, very well, Doctor, I had rather relate your stories than other men’s truths.

‘that while we all feel so much inte-  
rest in the cause of the Americans,  
you say nothing for them’? *I ama  
king by trade,’ said he.  
  
« When the Declaration of Inde-  
  
endence was under the consideration  
of Congress, there were two or three  
unlucky expressions in it, which gave  
offence to some members. The words  
‘Scotch and other auxiliaries,’ excit-  
ed the ire of a gentleman or two of  
that country. Severe strictures on  
the conduct of the British king, in ne-  
gativing our repeated repeals of the  
law which permitted the importation  
of slaves, were disapproved by some  
southern gentlemen, whose reflections  
were not yet matured to the full ab-  
horrence of that traffic. Although  
the offensive expressions were imme  
diately yielded, these gentlemen con-  
tinued their depredations on other  
parts of the instrument. I was sitting  
by Dr. Franklin, who perceived that  
I was not insensible to those mutila-  
tions. ‘ I have made it a rule,’ said  
he, ‘ whenever in my power, to avoid  
becoming the draughtsman of papers  
tobe reviewed by a public body. I  
took my lesson from an incident which  
Iwill relate to you. When I was a  
journeyman printer, one of my com  
panions, an apprentice hatter, having  
served out iis time, was about to open  
shop for himself. His first concern  
was to have a handsome sign-board,  
with a proper inscription. He com  
posed it in these words:—* John  
Thompson, Hatter, makes and sel/s  
  
hats for ready money,’ with a figure  
of a hat subjoined. But he thought  
he would submit it to his friends for  
their amendments. The first he  
showed it to, thought the word ‘ hatter’  
tautologous, because followed by the  
words ‘ makes hats.’ which shew he  
was a hatter. It was struck out. The  
next observed that the word * makes’  
might as well be omitted, because his  
customers would not care who made  
the hats; if good and to their mind,  
they would buy, by whomsoever  
made. He struck it out. A third  
said, he thought the words ‘ for ready  
money,’ were useless, as it was not the  
custom of the place to sell on credit:  
every one who purchased expected to  
pay. They were parted with, and the  
inscription now stood, ‘ J.hn Thomp-  
son sells hats.’ ¢ Se//s hats?’ says his  
next friend ; * why nobody will expect  
you to give them away. What then  
is the use of that word ?’ It was stricken  
out, and ‘ hats’ followed it. the rather,  
az there was one painted on the board;  
so his inscription was reduced ulti-  
mately to § John Thompson,’ with the  
figure of a hat subjoined.’  
  
* The Doctor told me, at Paris, the  
following anecdote of the Abbé Ray-  
nal—He had a pary to dine with  
him one day, at Passy, of whom one  
half were Americans, the other half  
French; among the last wis the Abbé.  
During the dinner he got on his fa-  
vourite theory of the deceneracy of  
animals, and even of man, in Ame-  
rica, and urged it with his usual lo-  
quence. The Doctor at length no-  
icing the accidental stature and po-  
sition of his guests, at table, * Come,’  
said he, * M. PAbbé, let us trv this  
question by the fact before us. We  
ave here one half Americans, and one  
half French; and it happens t!at the  
Americans have placed themselves  
on one side of the table, and our  
French friends are on the other. Let  
both parties rise, and we will see on  
which side nature has degenerated.’  
It happened that his American guests

When the declaration of Indepen­  
dence was under the consideration of  
Congress, there were two or three un­  
lucky expressions in it, which gave of­  
fence to some members. The words  
“ Scotch and other auxiliaries,” excited  
the ire of a gentleman or two of that  
country. Several strictures on the con­  
duct of the British King, in negativing  
our repeated repeals of the law which  
permitted the importation of slaves, were  
disapproved by some southern gentle­  
men, whose reflections were not yet  
matured to the full abhorrence of the  
traffic. Although most of the offensive  
expressions were immediately yielded,  
these gentlemen continued their&#x27; depre­  
dations on other parts of the instrument.  
I was sitting by Dr. Franklin, who per­  
ceived that I was not insensible to these  
mutulations. “ I have made it a rule,”  
said he, “ whenever in my power, to avoid  
becoming the draftsman of papers to be  
reviewed by a public body. I took my  
lesson from an incident which I will re­  
late to you. When I was a journeyman  
printer, one of my companions, an ap­  
prentice hatter, having served out his  
time, was about to open shop for himself.  
His first concern was to have a sign­  
board with a proper inscription. He  
composed it in these words: “ John  
Thompson, Hatter, makes and sells  
Hats for ready money&quot; with a figure of  
a hat subjoined; but he thought he  
would submit it to his friends for their  
amendment. The first he shewed it to  
thought the word “ hatter” tautologous  
because followed by the words “ makes  
bats,” which shew he was a hatter. It  
•was struck out. The next observed that  
the word “ makes&quot; might as well be  
omitted, because his customers would  
not care who made the hats, if good and  
to their mind, they would buy, by whom­  
soever made. He struck it out. A third  
Said, he thought the words “for ready  
money&quot; were useless, as it was not the  
custom of the place to sell on credit:  
every one who purchased expected to  
pay. They were parted with, and the  
inscription now stood, “John Thompson  
sells hats.” “ Sells hats,” says his next  
friend, “ why nobody will expect you  
to give them away. What then is the  
use of that word ?” It was striken out,  
and “ hats&quot; followed it: they thought it  
should be stricken out, as there was one  
painted on the board ; so his inscription  
was reduced ultimately to “ John T homp­  
8»n,” with the figure of a hat subjoined.”

ANECDOTE OF DR. FRANKLIN.  
Related by Mr. Jefferson in aletter of the Ath of Dec.  
1818.  
  
When the Declaration of Independence was  
under the consideration of congress, there were  
two or three unlucky expressions in it, which  
gave offence to some members. The words  
* Scotch and other auxiliaries” excited the ire  
of a gentleman or two of that country. Severe  
strictures on the conduct of the British king, in  
negativing our repeated repeals of the law  
which permitted the importation of slaves,  
were disapproved by some southern gentlemen  
whose reflections were not yet matured to the  
full abhorrence of that traffic. Although the  
offensive expressions were immediately yielded,  
those gentleman continued their depredations  
on other parts of the instrument. I was sitting  
by Dr. Franklin, who perceived that I was  
not insensible tothe mutilations. ‘I have  
made it a rule, said he, whenever it is in my  
power, to avoid becoming the draughtsman of  
papers to be reviewed by a public body. I  
took my lesson from an.incident which I will  
relate to you. When I was a journeyman  
printer, one of my companions an apprentice  
hatter, having served out his time, was about  
  
  
  
to open a shop for himself. His first concern  
was tohave a handsome sign board, with a  
proper inscription, He composed it in these  
words : ‘John Thompson, Hatter, makes and  
sells hats for ready money,’ with the figure  
of a hat subjoined. But he thought he would  
submit it to his friends for their amendments.  
The first he showed it to, thought the word  
‘hatter’ tautologious, because followed by the

ter. It was struck out. The next observed  
that the word ‘ makes,’ might as well be omit-

ANECDOTE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.   
When toe Declaration of Independence   
was under the consideration of Congress,   
there were two or three unlucky expressions   
in it which gave offence to some members.   
The words, &quot;Scotch, and other auxiliaries,&quot;   
excited the ire 01 a gentleman or two of that   
country. Severe strictures on the conduct o.   
the British king, in negativing our repeated   
repeals of the law which permitted the im­  
portation of slaves, were disapproved by­  
some Southern gentlemen, whose reflections   
were not yet matured to the full abhorrence   
of that traffic. Although the offensive ex   
preessioria were immediately yielded, those   
gentlemen continued their depredaiona on   
other parts of the instrument.   
Dr. Franklin remarked, to a person outing   
near him, &quot; I have made it a rule, whenever   
it is in my power, to avoid becoming the   
draughtsman of papers to be reviewed by a   
public body. I took my lesson from en in.   
cident which I will relate to you. When I   
. . _ e   
was a journeyman printer, and knytom­  
-panions, an apprentices hatter, having screed   
hie time, was about to open shop for himself.   
His first concern woe to have a handsome   
sign-board, with a proper ineeriptiom He   
composed it in these words—&#x27;John Thomp­  
sw, barter, makes and sells hats for ready   
money,&#x27; with the figure of a hat subjoined.   
But he thought he would submit it to his   
friends for their amendments The first he   
showed it to, thought the word &#x27; batter&#x27; tau­  
tologous, because hollowed by the words,   
&#x27;makes hats,&#x27; which showed he was a&#x27; hat­  
ter.&#x27; It was struck out. The next observed   
&#x27;hat the word &#x27;makes&#x27; might as well be   
omitted! because his customers would not   
care who made the hate; if good, and to   
their minds; they would ouy, by whomso­  
ever made. He theretore struck that out.   
A third said. he thought the word&#x27;s, &#x27;for   
ready money,&#x27; were useless,  
as it was not   
the custom of the place to sell on credit—  
every one who purchased expected to pay.   
Those words were parted with, and the in­  
scription now stood, &#x27;John Thompson sells   
hate.&#x27; Sells hate,&#x27; says his next friend,   
why, nobody will expect you to give them   
away. What, then, is the use of telling   
that!&#x27; That expression was stricken out,   
and his inscription finally stood, &#x27;John   
Thompson,&#x27; with the figure of a hat sub;   
joined.&quot; n. T. C.

He struck it out. A third said he thought  
the words for ready money were useless, ns it

hats. ‘Sells hats?’ says his next friend;  
‘why, nobody will expect you to give them

There was, perhaps, never a more agreeable table-  
companion than Benjamin Franklin, who began as a  
mere boy to say the kind of good things which can not  
be forgotten. One of the most noted of his table suc  
cesses was preserved by Mr. Jefferson, who was pres

guests, Abbe Raynal, insisted with much eloquence  
that on the continent of America both avimals and men  
became smaller. At length, Dr. Franklin, casting his

shop for himself. His first concern was to have a hand-

it in these words, John pson, Hatter, makes and sells  
Hats for ready money, with a figure of a hat subjoined,  
But he thought he would submit it to his friends for  
their amendments. The first he showed it to thought  
the word Aatter tautologous, because followed by the  
words makes hats, which showed he wasa hatter. 1t was  
struck out. The next observed that the word makes  
might as well be omitted, because his customers would  
not care who made the hats; if good and to their mind  
they would buy, by whomsoever made, He struck it out,  
A third said he thought the words for ready money were  
useless, as it was not the custom of the place to sell on  
credit, Every one who purchased expected to pay.  
They were parted with, and the inscription now stood  
John Thompson sells hats, “ Sells hats!” says his next  
friend ; “ why nobody will expect yoe to give them away,  
What, then, is the use of that word!” It was stricken out,

He had a party to dine with him one day at  
Passy, of whom one half were Americans, the  
other half French, and among the last was the  
Abbé [Raynal]. During the dinner he [the Abbé]  
got on his favorite theory of the degeneracy of  
animals, and even of man, in America, and urged  
it with his usual eloquence. The Doctor at length  
noticing the accidental stature and position of his  
cuests, at table, “Come,” says he, “M. l’Abbé, let  
us try this question by the fact before us. We  
are here one half Americans, and one half French,  
and it happens that the Americans have placed  
themselves on one side of the table, and our  
French friends are on the other. Let both parties  
rise, and we will see on which side nature has de-  
generated.” It happened that his American guests  
were Carmichael, Harmer, Humphreys, and others  
of the finest stature and form; while those of the  
other side were remarkably diminutive, and the  
Abbé himself particularly, was a mere shrimp.  
He parried the appeal, however, by a compli-  
mentary admission of exceptions, among which  
the Doctor himself was a conspicuous one.

When the Declaration of Independence was  
under the consideration of Congress, there were  
  
THE CENTURY MAGAZINE.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
two or three unlucky expressions in it which gave  
offence to some members. The words “Scotch and  
other foreign auxiliaries” excited the ire of a  
gentleman or two of that country. Severe stric-  
tures on the conduct of the British king, in nega-  
tiving our repeated repeals of the law which  
permitted the importation of slaves, were disap-  
proved by some Southern gentlemen, whose reflec-  
tions were not yet matured to the full abhorrence  
of that traffic. Although the offensive expressions  
were immediately yielded, these gentlemen con-  
tinued their depredations on other parts of the  
instrument. I was sitting by Dr. Franklin, who  
perceived that I was not insensible to these  
mutilations. “I have made it a rule,” said he,  
“whenever in my power, to avoid becoming the  
draughtsman of papers to be reviewed by a public  
body. I took my lesson from an incident which I  
will relate to you. When I was a journeyman  
printer, one of my companions,  
an apprentice hatter, having  
served out his time, was about  
to open shop for himself. His  
first concern was to have a  
handsome sign-board, with a  
proper inscription. He com-  
posed it in these words, ‘John  
Thompson, Hatter, makes and  
sells hats for ready money,’ with  
a figure of a hat subjoined;  
but he thought he would sub-  
mit it to his friends for their  
amendments. The first he  
showed it to thought the word  
‘Hatter’ tautologous, because  
followed by the words ‘makes  
a hats,’ which show he was a  
hatter. It was struck out.  
The next observed that the  
word ‘makes’ might as well be omitted, because  
his customers would not care who made the hats.  
If good and to their mind, they would buy, by  
whomsoever made. He struck it out. A third  
said he thought the words ‘for ready money’ were  
useless, as it was not the custom of the place to  
sell on credit. Every one who purchased expected  
to pay. They were parted with, and the inscrip-  
tion now stood, ‘John Thompson sells hats.’ ‘ Sells  
hats,’ says his next friend! ‘Why nobody will  
expect you to give them away, what then is the  
use of that word?’ It was stricken out, and  
‘hats’ followed it, the rather as there was one  
painted on the board. So the inscription was re-  
duced ultimately to ‘John Thompson’ with the  
figure of a hat subjoined.”
