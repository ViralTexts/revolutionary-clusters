he rapid exhaustion of her virgin soil in which alone it can be cultivated with a chance of profit, that of  
the forty or fifty thousand labourers on tobacco the greater part will be released from that employment; and be applicable  
to that of manufactures. It is well known that the farming system requires much fewer hands than tobacco fields.  
It is painful to observe the unceasing efforts to alarm the South by imputations against the North, of  
unconstitutional designs on the subject of the slaves. You are right, I have no doubt, in believing, that no such  
intermedling disposition exists in that Body of our northern brethren. Their good faith is sufficiently guaranteed by the  
interest they have, as merchants, as shipowners, and as manufacturers, in preserving a union with the slave holding  
States. On the other hand what madness in the South, to look for greater safety in disunion. It would be worse than  
jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. It would be jumping into the fire from a fear of the frying pan. The  
danger from the alarms is that the pride and resentment excited by them may be an overmatch for the dictates of prudence;  
and favor the project of a Southern Convention insidiously revived, as promising by its counsels the best securities  
against grievances of every sort from the North.  
The case of the Tariff and Land bills cannot fail of an influence on the question of your return to the next  
Session of Congress. They are both closely connected with the public repose. With great esteem &amp; cordial regard
