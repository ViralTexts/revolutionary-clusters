Mount Vernon March 9th 1789  
  
My friendship is not in the least lessened by the difference which has taken place in our political sentiments; nor is my regard for you diminished by the part you have acted. Men’s minds are as varient as their faces, and, where the motives to their actions are pure, the operation of the former is no more to be imputed to them as a crime, than the appearance of the latter: for both being the work of nature, are equally unavoidable. Liberality and charity instead of clamour and misrepresentation (which latter only serve to foment the passions, without enlightening the understanding) ought to govern in all disputes about matters of importance: whether the former have appeared in some of the leaders of opposition, the impartial  
  
world will decide. According to report, your individual endeavour to prevent inflamatory measures from being adopted, redounds greatly to your credit. The reasons, My dear Sir, why I have not written to you for a long time, are two; first, because I found it an insupportable task to answer the letters which were written to me, and, at the same time, to pay that attention to my private concerns which they required; and, there being lately little besides politics worthy of notice, secondly, because I did not incline to appear as a partizan in the interesting subject that has agitated the public mind since the date of my last letter to you. For it was my sincere wish that the Constitution, which had been submitted to the People, might, after a fair and dispassionate investigation, stand or fall according to its merits or demerits. Besides I found from disagreeable experience, that almost all the sentiments extracted from me in answer to private letters or communicated orally, by some means or another, found their way into the public Gazettes; as well as some other sentiments, ascribed to me, which never had an existence in my imagination.  
In touching upon the more delicate part of your letter (the communication of which fills me with real concern) I will deal by you, with all that frankness which is due to friendship, and which I wish should be a characteristic feature in my conduct through life. I will therefore declare to you, that, if it should be my inevitable fate to administer the government (for Heaven knows that no event can be less desired by me; and that no earthly consideration short of so general a call, together with a desire to reconcile contending parties as far as in me layes, could again bring me into public life) I will go to the chair under no preengagement of any kind or nature whatsoever. But when in it, I will, to the best of my Judg⟨m⟩ent, discharge the duties of the office with that impartiality and zeal for the public good, which ought never to suffer connections of blood or friendship to intermingle, so as to have the least sway on decision of a public nature. I may err, notwithstanding my most strenuous efforts to execute the difficult trust with fidelity and unexceptionably, but my errors shall be of the head—not of the heart. For all recommendations for appointments, so far as they may depend upon or come from me, a due regard shall be had to the fitness of characters, the pretensions of different candidates,  
  
and, so far as is proper, to political considerations. These shall be invariably my governing motives.  
You will perceive then, my dear Sir, that I cannot with propriety say any thing more on the subject, than that several applications have been made to me for the Office immediately in question, without having received any answer. I wish you had pursued the policy, which the Gentlemen who now occupies it has done, of Obtaining the appointment from the Executive of this State. Although that Gentleman was an Officer, yet he is quite unknown to me; and, therefore, I cannot speak at all upon the ground of comparative claims of personal merits. I conceive, however, it will be found no pleasant thing possibly very much the reverse to displace one man, under these circumstances of actual occupancy; merely to make room for another, however considerable his abilities or unimpeached his integrity may appear to the public eye.  
Mrs Washington joines me in every good wish for Mrs Harrison and you

Mount Vebxon 0 March, 1753.  
My Dear Sir Mr friendship is not in the least  
lessened by the difference which has taken place ia  
opr political sentiments, ncr is my regard for you  
diminished by the part yon have acted. M n&#x27;s mind  
are as variant as their faces, and, where the motives  
of their actions are pure, the opt ration of the former  
is co more to be imputed to them as a erime than the  
appearance of the latter; for both, being the work cf  
nature, are alike unavoidable. Liberality and char­  
ity, instead of clamor and misrepresentation (which  
latter only serve to foment the passions without en­  
lightening the understanding), ought to govern in all  
disputes about matters of importance. Whether the  
former have appeared in some of the leaders of the  
opposition, the impartial world will decide.  
According to report, your individual endeavors t  
prevent inflammatory measures from beir.g adopted  
redound greatly to your credit. The reasons, mv  
dear sir, why I have tot written to you tor a long  
time are two first. I cause I found it an insupport­  
able task to answer the letters which we re written t j  
me and at the fame time pay that attention to my pri­  
vate concerns which they required, and there bein  
little besides polities wort&#x27;ay of notice; secondlv. be­  
cause I did not incline to appear as a partisan ia the  
interesting subject that has asritated the public mini  
since the dato cf tny last letter to you. For it wae  
my sincere wish that the Constitution, which Lad  
been submitted to the people, miglit,  
after a fair and dispassionate investigation, stand or  
fall, according to its merits or demerits. Beside. I  
found by disagreeable experience that almoot all th  
eentiments extracted from me in answer to private  
letters, by some meus or other found their way iute  
the public gazettes, a well as some other FcntiLienU  
ascribed to me which never had an existence in my  
imagination.  
In touching upon the more t&#x27;.elirat part of your  
letter, thecor .munication of which tills me with ral  
concern, I will deal with you w.th all that frankxess  
which is due to friendship, end waich 1 wish to be  
a characteristic feature in my conduct through  
life. I will therefore t&#x27;eelare to you tl.it if  
it should bo my ir.evita.bla fate to almisister  
the government (for heaven, knows that  
no event can be less de.sire-1 by me, and that no earth­  
ly consideration short of t-o general a ell, terether  
with a desire to reconcile contending parties, as tar aa  
in mo lies, could attain bring me into public life), I  
will tjo to the chair under to pre-engagement of ny  
kind or nature whatsoever. But, when in it, I wiil,  
to the best of my judgment, discharge th duties of  
the office with that impartiality and real for the pub­  
lic god which ought never to frufler connections of  
blood or friendship to intermingle so as to have tho  
least sway on decisions of a pubiis nature. I may err,  
notwithstanding my most strenuous e:Torts, to exe­  
cute the dSiicull trust with fidelity and unexception­  
ably; but my errors ahall be of the head, not of the  
heart. Per all recommendations for appointments, so  
far as they may depend upon cr come from me, a  
due regard shall be had for the fitness of character,  
the pretentions of different candidates and. so far as  
proper, to political considerations. These shall be in­  
variably my governing ruotires. You wiil perceive  
then, my dear sir, that 1 cannot with prcprie?y ay  
anything more on the subject than that everal ap­  
plications have been made to me for th-t hce im­  
mediately in question without having received anv  
answer. Iwishyoutal pursued the policy which  
the gentleman who now occupies it has dose, cf ob­  
taining the appointment from the executive cf his  
State. Although the gentleman was au  
officer, yet he is quite unknown to  
me, and therefore I cannot speak  
at all upon the ground of comparative claims cf per­  
sonal merits. 1 conceive, however, th&amp;t it will be  
found no pleasant thing, possibly very much the re­  
verse, to displace cne man under these circumstances  
of actual occupancy, merely to make room for an­  
other, however considerable his abilities or unim­  
peachable his integrity may appear to the public eye

To Benjamin Harrison:  
  
My Drak SIR: My friendship is not in the least  
lessened by the difference which has taken place in  
our political sentiments, nor is my regard for you  
diminished by the part you have acted. Men’s  
minds areas Variant as their faces, and, where the  
motives of their actions are pure, the operation  
ot the former is no more to be imputed to them as a  
crime than the appearance of the latter, for both,  
being the work of nature, ate alike unavoidabie.  
Liberality and charity, instead of clamor and muis-  
represeutation,(which latter only serves to toment  
the passions without enlightening the understand-  
ing,) ought to govern inal! disputes about matters  
ofimportance. Whether the former have appeared  
in some of the leaders of the opposition the impartial  
world willdecide.  
  
According tv report, your individual endeavors to  
prevent inflammatery meusurés from being adopted  
redound greatly to your credit. The reasons, ny  
dear -ir, why Ihave not written to you foralong  
time are two: First, because [ found it an insupport-  
able task to answer the letters which wére written  
to me and at the same time to pay that attention to  
my private concerns which they required, and there  
being little besides politica worthy of notice; sec-  
ondly, because I did not incline to appear as a  
partisan in the interesting subject that has  
agitated the public mind since my last letter to  
you. For it was my sincere wish that the  
constitution, which has been submitted to the peo-  
ple, might, after a fair and dispassionate investiga-  
tion, stand or fall according to its merits or de-  
merits. Besides, I found by disagreeable experi-  
ence tha: almost all the sentiment extracted trom  
one in answer to private letters, or communicated  
orally, by some weans or other found their way into  
the publie gazettes, as well a5 some other senti-  
ments ascribed to me which never had existence in  
my imagination.  
  
Jn touching upon the more delicate part of your  
letter, the communication of which fills me with  
real concern, I will deal by you with all that frank-  
ness whieh is due to friendship, and which I wish  
snould be a characteristic feature in my conduct  
through life. I willtherefore declare to you that  
shoula it be my inevitable fate to administer the  
Government, (for Heaven knows that no event can  
be less desired by me, and that no earthly considera-  
— short of so general &amp; call, together with a de-  
  
ire.to reconcile contending parties as far as in me  
lies, could again bring me into public life,) I wiil go  
to the chair under no pre-engagement of any kind  
or nature whatsoever. But, when in it, I will, to  
the best of my judgment, discharge the duties of  
the office with that impartiality and zeal for the  
public good which ought never to suffer con-  
nections of blood or friendship to intermingie so as  
to have the least sway on decisions ofa public nat-  
ure,  
  
I may err notwithstanding my most strenuous  
efforts to execute the difficult trust with fidelity  
nd unexceptionably, but my errors shall be of the  
bead, notot the heart. For ell recommendations for  
appointments, so faras they may depend upon or  
come from me, adue regard shall bé had to the fit-  
ness of characters, the pretensions of different can-  
didates, and, so far as is proper, to political consid-  
erations. These shall be invariably my governiug  
motives.  
  
You will perceive, then, my dear Sir, that I cannot  
  
swith propriety say anything more on the suiject |  
  
than that several applications have been made to  
me for the office immediately in question without  
having received any answer. I wish you had pur-  
sued the policy, which the gentleman who now oc-  
cupies it has dene, of obtaining the appointment  
from the Executive of this State. Although that  
gentieman was an officer, yet he is quite unknown  
to me, and theretore [ cannot speak atall upon the  
  
found of comparative claims of persunal merits,  
  
conceive, however, that it willbe found.po ploaa-  
ant thing, possibly very much the revers6, to dis-  
place one man under these circumstances of actual  
occupancy? merely to make room fer another, how-  
ever considerable his abilities, or unimpoached his  
integrity may appear te the public eye.

deavors he has made to prevent in­  
flammatory measures from being adop­  
ted. Washington complains that he  
finds that the sentiments extracted  
from him in reply to letters or comn  
municated orally find their way into  
the public gazettes.  
Then comes the portion from which  
Bishop Potter quoted so effectively.  
The letter is headed:  
&quot;To( BENJAMIx HARRIsoN,  
.&quot;Mount Vernon,  
&quot;9 March, 1789.  
The concluding portion reads:  
&quot;In touching upon the more delicate  
part of your letter, the communicatiorn  
of which fills me with deep concern, I  
wvill deal with you with all that frank  
ness which is due to friendship, and  
which I wish should be a characteris­  
tic feature in my conduct through life  
&quot;I will therefore declare to you that  
if it should be my inevitable fate to ad  
minister the government (for heaver  
knows that no event can be less de  
sired by me, and that no earthly con  
sieration short of so greneral a call  
  
together Swith a desire to reconcile  
contending parties as far as in me lies,  
could again bring me into pub.ic life),  
I will go to the chair under no pre­  
engagement of any kind or nature  
whatsoever. But when in it I will, to  
the best of my judgment, discharge the  
duties of my office with that impar­  
tiality and zeal for the public good

&quot;I may err, notwithstanding my  
most strenuous efforts to execute the  
difficult trust with fidelity and unex­  
ceptionably, but my errors shall be of  
the head, not of the heart,  
&quot;For all recommendations for ap­  
pointments, so far as they may de­  
pend upon or come from me, a due re­  
gard shall be had to ths fitness of  
characters, the pretensions of different  
candidates, and, so far as is proper, to  
political considerations, These shall  
be invariably my governing motives.  
&quot;You will preceive then, my dear  
sir, that I cannot with propriety say  
anything more on the subject than  
that several applications have been  
made to me for the office immediately  
in question without having received  
any answer.  
&quot;I wish you had pursued the same  
policy which the gentleman who occu­  
pies it now has done, of obtaining the  
appointment from the Executive of  
this State. Although that gentleman  
was an officer, he is quite unknown to  
me, and therefore I cannot speak at  
all upon the ground of comparative  
claims of personal merits. I conceive,  
however, that it will be found po  
pleasant thing, possibly very much the  
reverse to displace one man, under  
these circumstances of actnal occu­  
pancy, merely to make room for an­  
other, however considerable nis abili­
