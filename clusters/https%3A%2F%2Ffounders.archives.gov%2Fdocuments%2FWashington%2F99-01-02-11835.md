Dear Lund:—Mrs. Custis has never suggested

most distant attachment to P. S-; but if this

it, a father and a mother, who are at hand, and j  
competent to give it. arc at the same time the j  
most proper to be consulted on so interesting an •  
event. For my own part, 1 never did. nor do I i  
believe 1 ever shad, give ad vice to a woman who !  
is sitting out on a matrimonial voyage; fiist, j  
because 1 never could advise one to many w iiii- j  
out her consent; and secondly, because l know  
it is to no purpose to advise her to refrain when  
she has obtained it. A woman very rarely asks  
an opinion or requires advice, on such occasions j  
till her resolution is foimerl; and then it is with ;  
the hope and expectation of obtaining a sane i  
lion, not that she means to be governed by your ;  
disapprobation, that she applies. In a word, the j  
plain English of the application may he sum-j  
med up in these word.-: “1 wish you to think as \

Rocky Hill, Sept. 20, 1783.  
Dear Lund,—Mrs. Custis has never sug­  
gested in any of her letters to Mrs. Wash­  
ington (unless ardent wishes for her return  
that s h e might then disclose it to her &#x27;can  
be so construed) the most distant attach­  
m#nt t0 D&lt; g.. bu t if this should bo the  
case, and she wants advice upon it, a  
father and mother who are at hand, and  
are competent to give it, are at the same  
tiine the m#st proper t0 be consulted on so  
interesting an event. For my own part, I  
ncver did&gt; n#r do i believe 1 ever shall,  
gj ve adv ice to a woman who is setting out  
on a matrimonial voyage ; 1st, I never could  
advise one to marry without her own con­  
»cm, and aecumMy, because 1 lnoow it i*  
j 0 no purpose to advise her to refrain  
w hen she has obtained it. A woman very  
rarely asks an opinion or requires advice  
on suc ), an occasion till her resolution is  
formed—and then it is with the hope and  
expectation of obtaining a sanction, not  
that she means to be governed by your  
disapprobation, that she applies. In a  
word, the application may be summed up  
; n these words,—&quot; I wish you to think as  
I do ; but if, unhappily you differ fromme  
j n opinion, my heart, I must confess, is  
fixed, and 1 have gone too far now to re­  
tract.  
if Mrs. Custis should ever suggest any  
thing of this kind te me I will give her  
my opinion of the measure, not of the man,  
with candor, and to tho following effect :  
1 never expected that you would spend  
the residue of your days in widowhood—  
but in a matter so important, and so inter­  
esting to yourself, your children and con­  
nections, I wish you would make a pru­  
dent choice. To do which, many consid­  
erations are necessary ; such as the family  
and connections ef the man, his fortune,  
which is not the most essential in my eye,)  
the line of conduct he has observed, and  
the disposition and frame ef his mind.—  
You should consider what prospect there  
of his proving kind and affectionate­  
just, generous and attentive to yeur chil­  
dren ; and hew far his connections will be  
agreeable te you ; for when they are once  
formed, agreeable or net, the die being

Lund.- Mrs Custis has never suggest­  
ed in any of her letters to Mrs Washington (un  
less ardent wishes for her retern that she muight  
then disclose it to her can be so construed) the  
most distant attachment to DS but if this should  
be the case, and she wants advice upon it, a fa  
ther and mother who are at hand and are compe­  
tent to give il, are at the same time most proper  
to be consulted on so interesting an event. For  
my own part I never did, nor do I believe I ever  
shall give advice to a woman who is setting ouf  
on a matrimonial voyage, first, I never could ad  
vise one to marry without her own consent; and  
secondly, because I know it is to no purpose to  
advise her to refrain when she has obtained it.
