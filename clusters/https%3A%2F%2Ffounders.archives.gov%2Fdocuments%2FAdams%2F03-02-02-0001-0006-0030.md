Mr. Shaw preach’d in the forenoon from Proverbs I. 5. A wise man will hear, and will increase learning, and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. A great deal was said about neglect in attending public worship on the Sunday. I rather doubt whether it be a matter of so much consequence as was supposed. It is however very proper for a minister to remind his People of their Duties from time to Time. The Sermon in the afternoon, was from Job I. 1. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

writer alleged against me. 1 think my views likewise  
supported by the description of the character of Job,  
chap. i. ver. 1, who *“* was perfect and upright, and one  
that feared God and eschewed evil ;”’ also by the ac-  
count of Zacharias and Blizabeth, Luke i. 6, ** who  
were both righteous before God, walking in all the  
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.”  
Was the righteousness of these persons contained in  
another person, and placed to their account? Or was  
it not rather their own, become resident in them, and  
practised by them? T.
