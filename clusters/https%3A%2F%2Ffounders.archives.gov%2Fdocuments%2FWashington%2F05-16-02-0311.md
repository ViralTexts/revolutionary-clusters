,  
Philadelphia July 20th 1794.  
  
I am indebted to you for your several favors of the 15th of June, 15th of August &amp; 11th of September of the last—and for that of the 6th of February in the present year; for which, and the Pamphlets accompanying them, my thanks are particularly due. To say this, and to have suffered them to remain so long unacknowledged, needs explanation. The truth is, they came to hand—the first of them—about the opening, and the second set towards the close of a long and interesting Session of Congress; during which, my time was very much occupied, and at the end thereof, I had a pressing call to my estate in Virginia; from whence I have not been returned more than ten or twelve days.  
I have read with peculiar pleasure and approbation, the work you patronise; so much to your own honor and the utility of the public. Such a general view of the Agriculture in the several Counties of Great Britain, is extremely interesting; and cannot fail of being very beneficial to the Agricultural concerns of your Country, and to those of every other, wherein they are read: and must entitle you to their warmest thanks for having set such a plan on foot, and for prosecuting it with the zeal &amp; intelligence you do.  
I am so much pleased with the plan &amp; execution myself, as to pray you to have the goodness to direct your Book seller to continue to forward them to me, accompanied with the cost, which shall be paid to his order; or remitted so soon as the amount is made known to me.  When the whole are received; I will promote, as far as in me lays, the reprinting of them here.  
I know of no pursuit in which more zeal &amp; important service can be rendered to any Country than by improving its agriculture—its breed of useful animals—and other branches of a husbandman’s cares; nor can I conceive any plan more conducive to this end than the one you have introduced for bringing to view the actual state of them, in all parts of the Kingdom; by which good &amp; bad habits are exhibited in a manner too plain to be misconceived; for the accounts given to the British board of Agriculture, appear, in general, to be drawn up in a masterly manner; so as fully to answer the expectations formed in the  
  
excellent plan wch produced them; affording at the sametime, a fund of information useful in political œconomy—serviceable in all countries.  
Commons—Tithes—Tenantry (of which we feel nothing in this country) are in the list of impediments I perceive, to perfection in English farming; and taxes are heavy deductions from the profit thereof. Of these we have none, or so light as hardly to be felt.  Your system of Agriculture, it must be confessed, is in a stile superior, &amp; of course much more expensive than ours, but when the balance at the end of the year is struck, by deducting the taxes, poor rates, and incidental charges of every kind, from the produce of the land, in the two Countries, no doubt can remain in which Scale it is to be found.  
It will be sometime I fear, before an Agricultural Society with Congressional aids will be established in this Country; we must walk, as other countries have done, before we can run; Smaller Societies must prepare the way for greater; but with the lights before us, I hope we shall not be so slow in maturation as older nations have been. An attempt, as you will perceive by the enclosed outlines of a plan, is making to establish a State Society in Pennsylvania, for Agricultural improvements: If it succeeds, it will be a step in the ladder. At present it is too much in embryo to decide on the result.  
Our domestic animals, as well as our Agriculture, are inferior to yours in point of size; but this does not proceed from any defect in the stamina of them, but to deficient care, in providing for their support; experience having abundantly evinced that, where our pastures are as well improved as the soil &amp; climate will admit; where a competent store of wholesome provender is laid up—and proper care used in serving it, that our horses, black cattle, Sheep &amp;ca are not inferior to the best of their respective kinds which have been imported from England. Nor is the wool of our Sheep inferior to that of the common sort with you: as a proof—after the Peace of Paris in 1783, and my return to the occupations of a farmer, I paid particular attention to my breed of Sheep (of which I usually kept about seven or eight hundred): By this attenti&lt;on,&gt; at the shearing of 1789, the fleeces yielded me the average quantity of 5¼ lbs. of wool; a fleece of which, promiscuously taken, I sent to Mr Arthur Young, who put it, for examination, into the hands of Manufacturers. These pronounced  
  
it to be equal in quality to the Kentish Wool.  In this same year, i.e. 1789 I was again called from home, and have not had it in my power since to pay any attention to my farms; the consequence of which is, that my Sheep, at the last shearing, yielded me not more than 2½ lbs. This is not a single instance of the difference between care and neglect. Nor is the difference between good &amp; bad management confined to that species of Stock; for we find that good pastures and proper attention, can, &amp; does, fill our markets with beef of seven, eight &amp; more hundred weight, the four quarters; whereas from 450 to 500 (especially in the States South of this, where less attention hitherto has been paid to grass.) may be found about the averag&lt;e w&gt;eight. In this market, some Bullo&lt;ck&gt;s were killed in the months of March &amp; April last, the weights of wch, as taken from the accounts which were published at the time, you will find in a paper enclosed.  These were pampered Steers, but from 800 to a thousand, the four quarters, is no uncommon weight.  
Your general history of Sheep, with observations thereon, and the proper mode of managing them, will be an interesting work when compleated; and with the information, &amp; accuracy I am persuaded it will be executed, under your auspices, must be extremely desirable. The climate of this Country, particularly that of the middle states, is congenial to this species of animal; but want of attention to them in most farmers, added to the obstacles which prevent the importation of a better kind, by men who would be at the expence, contributes not a little to the present inferiority we experience.  
Mr Edwards would have it as much in his power as most of our farmers, to solve the queries you propounded to him; In addition to which, a gentlemen of my acquaintance (who is also among the best farmers of this Country,) to whom I gave the perusal of your propositions, has favored me with some ideas on the subject, as you will find on a paper, herewith enclosed.  
The sample you were so obliging as to put into the hands of Mr Lear, for me, of a Scotch fabric, is extremely elegant, and I pray you to accept my thanks for it, as I entreat you also to do for the civilities shewn to that gentlemen, who has a grateful sense of them.  
Both Mr Adams and Mr Jefferson had the perusal of the  
  
papers which accompanied your note of the 11th of Sept. With great respect and esteem, I have the honor to be Sir, Your Obedt Servt

rior, and of course much more expensive than ours ; but when the  
balance at the end of the vear was struck, by deducting the taxes,  
poor rates, and incidental charges of every kind, from the produce  
of the land in the two countries, no doubt can remain in which  
scale it is tu be found.’—P. 281.  
  
We proceed to pick some more of the plumbs out of the fare  
which Sir John has provided us. Lord Marchmont, the friend of  
Pope, lived to the age of eighty-six, preserving his strength and  
faculties to the last. He rode out only five days before he died.

Philadelphia, July 20, 1794.  
  
Sir:  
  
lam indebted to you for your several favors of  
the 15th of June, 15th of August, and 11th of  
September of the last—and for that of the 6th of  
February, in the present year ; for which, and the  
pamphlet accompanying them, my thanks are par-  
ticularly due. ‘I’o say this, and to have suffered  
them to remain so long unacknowledged, needs  
explanation. ‘The truth is, they came to hand—  
the first of them about the opening, and the sec-  
ond set, towards the close of a long and interesting  
session of Congress, during which my time was  
very much occupied, and at the end thereof, I had  
4 pressing call to my estate in Virginia, from  
whence I have not been returned more than ten or  
\welve days.  
_Thave read with peculiar pleasure and approba-

onor and the utility of the’ public. Such a gen-  
eral view of the agriculture in the several counties  
ramet, Britain, is extremely interesting; and

a — warmest thanks for having set such a plan

to me, accompanied with the cost which shall be  
paid to his order; of remitted so soon as the  
amount is made known to me. When the whole  
are received, [ will promote, as far as in me lays,  
the reprinting of them here.  
  
I know of no pursuit in which more real and im-  
portant services can be rendered to any country,  
than by improving its agriculture—its breed of  
useful animals—and other branches of’ a husband-  
man’s cares ;—nor can I conceive any pldin more  
conducive to this end, than the one you have in-  
troduced for bringing to view the actual state of  
them, in all parts of the kingdom ; by which good  
and bad habits are exhibited in a manner too plain  
to be misconceived ; for the accounts given to the  
British Board-of Agriculture, appear in general, to  
be drawn up in a masterly manner, so as fully to  
answer the expectations formed in the excellent  
plan which produced them; affording at the saine  
time a fund of information useful in political econ-  
omy—serviceable in all countries,  
  
Commons, tithes, tenantry (of which we feel  
nothing in this country) are in the list of impedi-  
ments I perceive, to perfection in English farming;  
and taxes are heavy deductions from the profit  
thereof. Of these we have none, or so light as  
hardly to be felt. Your system of agriculture, it  
must be confessed, is in astyle superior, and of  
course much more expensive than ours; but when  
the balance at the end of the year is struck, by  
deducting the taxes, poor-rates, and_ incidental  
charges of every kind, from the produce of the  
land, in the two countries, no doubt can remain in  
which scale it is to be found.  
  
It will be some time, I fear, before an agricultu-  
ral society with congressional aids will be estab-  
lished in this country; we must walk, as other  
countries have done, before we can run. Smaller  
societies inust prepare the way for greater: but  
with the lights before us, I hope we shall not be  
so slow in maturation as older nations have been.  
An attempt, as you will perceive by the enclosed  
outlines of a plan, is making to establish a state  
society in Pennsylvania, for agricultural improve-  
ments. If it succeeds, it will be a step in the lad-  
der; at present it is too much in embryo to decide  
on the result,  
  
Our domestic animals, as well as our agriculture,  
are inferior to yours in point of size; but this does  
not proceed ftom any defect in the stamina of them,  
but to deficient care in providing for their support;  
experience having abundantly evinced, that, where  
our pastures are as well improved as the soil and  
climate will admit—where a competent store of  
wholesome provender is laid up, and proper care  
used in serving it,—that our horses, black cattle,  
sheep, &amp;c. are not inferior to. the best of their res-  
pective kinds which have been imported from Eng-  
land. ‘Nor isthe wool of our sheep inferior to that  
of the common sort with you :—as a proof, after the  
peace of Paris in 1783, and my return to the oceu-  
pation of a farmer, I paid particular attention to  
my breed oi sheep (of which I usually kept about  
seven or eight hundred). By this attention, at

[No. 7  
  
nn  
  
the shearing of 1789, the fleeces yielded me the  
average quantity of 541bs. of wool; a fleece of  
which, promiscuously taken, I sent to Mr. Arthur  
Young. who put it, for examination, into the hands  
of manufacturers. These pronounced it to be  
equal in quality tothe Kentish wool. In this same  
  
ear, 2. e. 1789, [ was again called {rom home, and  
  
ave not had it in my power since to pay any at-  
tention to my farm ; the consequence of which is,  
that my sheep, at the last shearing, yielded me  
not more than 2}lbs. This is not asingle instance  
of the diflerence between care and neglect. Nor  
is the difference between good and bad manage-  
ment confined to that species of stock ; for we find  
that good pastures and proper attention, can, and  
does, fill our markets with beef of seven, eight  
and more hundred weight, the four quarters ;  
whereas from 450 to 500 (especially in the states  
south of this, where less attention hitherto has been  
paid to grass,) may be found about the average  
weight. In this market, some bullocks were kill-  
edin the months of March and April last, the  
weights of which, as taken from the accounts  
which were published at the time, you will find  
inapaperenciosed. ‘These were pampered steers,  
but from 800 to 1000 Ibs. the four quarters, is no  
uncommon weight.  
  
Your general history of sheep, with observations  
thereon, and the proper mode of managing them,  
will be an interesting work when completed; and  
with the information, and accuracy, I am persua-  
ded it will be executed under your auspices, must  
be extremely desirable. The climate of this coun-  
try, particularly that of the middle states, is con-  
genial to this species of animal; but want of atten-  
tion to them in most farmers, added to the obsta-  
cles which prevent the importation of a better kind,  
by men who would be at the expense, contributes  
not a little to the present inferiority we experi-  
ence.  
  
Mr. Edwards would have it as much in his pow-  
er as most of our farmers, to solve the queries you  
propounded to him: in addition to which, a gen-  
tleman of my acquaintance (who is also among  
the best farmers of this country,) to whom I gave  
the perusal of your propositions, has favored me  
with some ideas on the subject, as you will find on  
a paper, herewith enclosed.  
  
The sample you were so obliging as to put into  
the hands of Mr. Lear, for me, of a Scotch fab-  
ric, is extremely elegant, and I pray you to. ac-  
cept my thanks for it, as [ entreat you also to do  
for the civilities shown to that gentleman, who has  
a grateful sense of them.  
  
Both Mr. Adams, and Mr. Jefferson, had the  
perusal of the papers which accompanied your  
note of the 11th of September.  
  
With great respect and esteem,  
I have the honor to be, sir,  
Your obedient servant,

PHILADELPHIA, JULY 20 1794.  
Sir,  
  
I am indebted to you for you several favors of the 15t* of June, 15% of August &amp;  
11% of September of the last—and for that of the 6 of February in the present year ;—  
for which, and the Pamphlets accompanying them, my thanks are particularly due.—To  
say this, and to have suffered them to remain so long unacknowledged, needs explana-  
tion.—The truth is, they came to hand—the first of them—about the opening, and the  
Second Set towards the close of a long and interesting Session of Congress; during  
which my time was very much occupied, and at the end thereof, I had a pressing call to  
my Estate in Virginia, from whence I have not been returned more than ten or twelve  
days. —  
  
I have read with peculiar pleasure and approbation, the work you patronise ; so much  
to your own honor and the utility of the public.—Such a General View of the Agricul-  
ture in the several counties of Great Britain, is extremely interesting ; and cannot fail of

being very beneficial to the Agricultural concerns of your Country, and to those of every  
other wherein they are read: and must entitle you to their warmest thanks for having  
set such a plan on foot, and for prosecuting it with the Zeal &amp; intelligence you do.—  
  
Iam so much pleased with the plan &amp; execution myself, as to pray you to have the  
goodness to direct your Book-Seller to continue to forward them to me accompanied with  
the cost, which shall be paid to his order; or remitted so soon as the amount is made  
known to me.—When the whole are received ; I will promote, as far as in me lays, the re-  
printing of them here.—  
  
I know of no pursuit in which more real &amp; important Service can be rendered to any  
Country than by improving its Agriculture—its breed of useful animals and other branches  
of a husbandman’s cares ;—nor can I conceive any plan more conducive to this end than  
the one you have introduced for bringing to view the actual state of them, in all parts of  
the Kingdoms by which good &amp; bad habits are exhibited in a manner too plain to be  
misconceived ; of the accounts given to the British board of Agriculture, appear in  
general, to be drawn up in a Masterly Manner; so as fully to answer the expectations  
formed in the excellent plan w% produced them; affording at the same time, a fund of  
information, useful in political Economy—Serviceable in all countries.  
  
Commons—Tithes—Tenantry (of which we feel nothing in this Country) are in the list  
of impediments I perceive, to perfection in English farming ;—and taxes are heavy deduc-  
tions from the profit thereof.— Of these we have none, or so light as hardly to be felt.—  
Your system of Agriculture, it must be confessed, is in a stile superior, &amp; of course much  
more expensive than ours, but when the balance at the end of the year is struck, by de-  
ducting the taxes, poor rates, and incidental charges of every kind, from the produce of the  
land, in the two countries, no doubt can remain in which scale it is to be found. —  
  
It will be sometime I fear, before an Agricultural Society with Congressional aids will be  
established in this Country ; we must walk, as other countries have done, before we can run ;  
Smaller Societies must prepare the way for greater; but with the lights before us, I hope  
we shall not be so slow in Maturation as older Nationshave been.— An attempt, as you  
will perceive by the enclosed outlines of a plan, is making to establish a State Society  
in Pennsylvania, for Agricultural improvements:—If it succeeds, it will be a step in the  
ladder.— At present it is too much in embryo to decide on the result—.  
  
Our domestic Animals, as well as our Agriculture, are inferior to yours in point of size ;  
but this does not proceed from any defect in the stamina of them, but to deficient care in  
providing for their support ; experience having abundantly evinced that, where our past-  
ures are as well improved as the Soil &amp; climate will admit ;—where a competent store  
of wholesome provender is laid up—and proper care used in serving it, that our horses,  
black Cattle, Sheep, &amp;ct are not inferior to the best of their respective kinds which have  
been imported from England.—Nor is the Wool of our Sheep inferior to that of the common  
sort with you:—as a proof.—after the Peace of Paris in 1783, and my return to the occu-  
pations of a farmer, I paid particular attention to my breed of Sheep (of which I usually  
kept about seven or eight hundred):—By this attention at the shearing of 1789, the fleeces  
yielded me the average quantity of 54&quot; of Wool; a fleece of which, promiscuously taken,  
I sent to Mt Arthur Young, who put it, for examination, into the hands of Manufacturers.—  
These pronounced it to be equal in quality to the Kentish wool.—In this same year, i. e.  
1789, I was again called from home, and have not had it in my power since to pay any  
attention to my farms ;—the consequence of which is, that my Sheep at the last shearing,  
yielded me not more than 2} lbs.—This is not a single instance of the difference between  
  
  
  
WASHINGTON ON AGRICULTURE 333  
  
care and Neglect.—Nor is the difference between good &amp; bad management confined to  
that species of Stock; for we find that good pastures and proper attention, can, &amp; does,  
fill our Markets with Beef of seven, eight &amp; more hundred Weight, the four quarters ;  
whereas from 450 to 500 (especially in the States of South of this, where less attention  
hitherto has been paid to grass) may be found about the average weight.—In this Market  
some Bullocks were killed in the months of March &amp; April last, the weight of which as  
taken from the accounts which were published at the time, you will find in a paper  
enclosed.—These were pampered Steers, but from 800 to a thousand, the four quarters, is  
no uncommon weight.  
  
Your general history of Sheep, with observations thereon, and the proper mode of  
Managing them, will be an interesting work when compleated ; and with the information,  
&amp; accuracy I am persuaded it will be executed, under your auspices, must be extremely  
desirable.—The climate of this Country, particularly that of the Middle States, is congenial  
to this species of Animal ; but want of attention to them in most farmers, added to the  
obstacles which prevent the importation of a better kind, by men who would be at the  
expence, contributes not a little to the present inferiority we experience.—  
  
Mt Edwards would have it as much in his power as most of our farmers, to solve the  
queries you propounded to him ;—In addition to which a gentleman of my acquaintance  
(who is also among the best farmers of this Country,) to whom I gave the perusal of your  
propositions, has favored me with some ideas on the subject, as you will find on a paper  
herewith enclosed.  
  
The sample you were so obliging as to put into the hands of Mr! Lear, for me, of a  
Scotch fabric, is extremely elegant, and I pray you to accept my thanks for it, as I entreat  
you also to do for the civilities thereon to that gentleman, who has a grateful sense of  
them.—  
  
Both Mr Adams and Mtr Jefferson had the perusal of the papers which accompanied  
your note of the 11&quot; of Sept .—  
  
With great respect and esteem,  
I have the honor to be  
Sir,  
Your Obed! Servt
