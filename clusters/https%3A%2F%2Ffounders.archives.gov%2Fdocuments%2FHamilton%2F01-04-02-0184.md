 in the course of these papers, to induce a probability that the General Government will be better administered than the particular governments: The principal of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres of election will present a greater option, or latitude of choice to the people, that through the medium of the State Legislatures, which are select bodies of men, and who are to appoint the members of the national Senate,—there is reason to expect that this branch will generally be composed with peculiar care and judgment: That these circumstances promise greater knowledge and more extensive information in the national councils: And that they will be less apt to be tainted by the spirit of faction, and more out of the reach of those occasional ill humors or temporary prejudices and propensities, which in smaller societies frequently contaminate the public councils, beget injustice and oppression of a part of the community, and engender schemes, which though they gratify a momentary inclination or desire, terminate in general distress, dissatisfaction and disgust.

nforce their execution, than the laws of the particular members.  
The hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition—the dread of punishment—a proportionately strong discouragement to it—will not the government of the Union, which, if possessed of a due degree of power, can call to its aid the collective resources of the whole confederacy, be more likely to repress the former sentiment, and to inspire the latter, than that of a single State, which can only command the resources within itself? A turbulent faction in a State may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends to the government in that State; but it can hardly be so infatuated as to imagine itself a match for the combined efforts of the Union. If this reflection be just, there is less danger of resistance from irregular combinations of individuals, to the authority of the confederacy, than to that of a single member.  
I will in this place hazard an observation which will not be the less just, because to some it may appear new; which is, that the more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in the ordinary exercise of government, the more the citizens are accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their political life; the more it is familiarised to their sight and to their feelings; the further it enters into those objects which touch the most sensible cords, and put in motion the most active springs of the human heart; the greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the respect and attachment of the community. Man is very much a creature of habit. A thing that rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little influence upon his mind. A government continually at a distance and out of sight, can hardly be expected to interest the sensations of the people. The inference is, that the authority of the Union, and the affections of the citizens towards it, will be strengthened rather than weakened by its extension to what are called matters of internal concern; and will have less occasion to recur to force in proportion to the familiarity and comprehensiveness of its agency. The more it circulates through those channels and currents, in which the passions of mankind naturally flow, the less will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of compulsion.  
One thing at all events, must be evident, that a government like the one pr

nt delinquencies in the members, are the natural offspring of the very frame of the government; and that as often as these happen they can only be redressed, if at all, by war and violence.  
The plan reported by the Convention, by extending the authority of the fœderal head to the individual citizens of the several States, will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of each in the execution of its laws. It is easy to perceive that this will tend to destroy, in the common apprehension, all distinction between the sources from which they might proceed; and will give the Fœderal Government the same advantage for securing a due obedience to its authority, which is enjoyed by the government of e

tions, and between the states, &amp;c. give to the federal govern-  
ment, not only an adequate share of constitutional strength,  
but, as was intended by the Convention, much of that ad-  
ventitious authority, to which we alluded in our seventeenth  
page.—The sources from which springs the mere znfluence, as  
contradistinguished from the power of a government, and the  
utility of that influence, were well understood by the Conven-

just, because to some it may appear new; which is that the more the opera-

government; the more the citizens are accustomed to meet with it in the  
common occurrences of their political life; the more it is familiarized to  
their sight and to their feelings; the further it enters into those objects  
which touch the most sensible chords, and put in motion the most active  
springs of the human heart; the greater will be the probability that it will  
conciliate the respect and attachment of the community. Man is very much  
a creature of habit. A thing which rarely strikes his senses, will have but  
a transient influence over his mind. A government continually at a distance

of the citizens towards it, will be strengthened rather than weakened, by  
its extension to what are called matters of internal concern; and that it will  
have less occasion to recur to force, in proportion to the familiarity, and  
comprehensiveness of its agency. The more it circulates through those  
channels and currents, in which the passions of mankind naturally flow,
