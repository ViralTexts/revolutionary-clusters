London, May 9, 1808.  
  
I had aconversation with Mr.  
Canning on Friday last, in conse-  
quence of the arrival of the  
Osage.  
  
As it was obviously expected  
that I should seek an interview  
with him, I went to Downing-

He had been indisposed, and was  
not at the office; but in answer

evening, he asked to see me next  
day at his house in Bruton-street.  
  
The Osage had for some timc  
been looked for with considerable  
anxiety, and the government hac  
apparently anticipated a commu-  
nication (and perhaps a proposal )  
of some importance, from me, as  
soon as my dispatches should be  
received. As I had, in fact,’ no  
comraunication to make, it seem-  
ed to be proper that I should ren-  
der the disappointment of as littic  
moment as possible, by the man-  
ner of announcing it, without,  
however, putting any thing to ha-  
zard by an indiscreet manifesta-  
tion of unnecessary solicitude.  
  
The little which I supposed it

wisible. A feeling of regret was  
perhaps perceptible, and a hope  
was intimated, that the time was  
not far distant, when 1 should be  
enabled to do what, at present,  
was out of my power; but no-  
thing occurred which could be  
construed into a symptom of im-  
patience, jealousy, or dissatisfac-  
tion. ‘There was, undoubtedly,  
no real ground for any thing of  
this sort; but it was, notwith-  
standing, quite possible that the  
importance, which it had become  
a habit to attach to the arrival of  
the Osage, from circumstances  
principally accidental, might have  
produced a disposition to think  
otherwise.  
  
I thought it advisable to make  
use of this opportunity (although  
the topic was, in many views,  
more delicate than it had been)  
to suggest the propriety of yield-  
ing, as the moment was sufficient-  
ly favorable to such a course, up-  
on the subject of the late orders in  
council, of which I had scen no-  
thing to change my original opi-  
nion. There was reason to ap-  
prehend, however, that it might  
be worse than useless to press  
the suggestion, upon my own au-  
thority merely, while I could say  
nothing of the French decrees ;  
and, accordingly, I forbore to do  
sO.  
An idea has evidently gone  
forth, since the Osage arrived,  
founded upon rumors of a doubt-  
ful description, that our relations  
with France have grown to be  
extremely precarious, and that  
we are consequently about to  
come to an unde®tanding of a  
very friendly kind with Great  
Britain. Itis not improbable that  
the government has, in some de-  
gree at least, adopted this idea.  
  
I have the honor to inclose a  
copy of a notification, recently  
received from Mr. Canning, of  
the blockade of Copenhagen, and  
of the other ports in the island of  
Zealand, which { have cadsed to  
be communicated, in the usual

The Osage had for some time been looked

festation of unnecessary solicitude.  
The little which I supposed it requisite to

on was left on tlie mind of Mr. Canning, it  
certainly was not visible. A feeling of re­  
gret was perhaps perceptible, and a hope  
was intimated that the time was not far dis­  
tant when I should be enabled to do what at

curred which could be construed into a symp­  
tom of impatience, jealousy, or dissatisfacti­
