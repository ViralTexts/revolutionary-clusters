eed to consider the other part of it.  
We are told “It is an universal truth, that he that would excite a rebellion, is at heart, as great a tyrant as ever weilded the iron rod of oppression.” Be it so: We are not exciting a rebellion. Opposition, nay open, avowed resistance by arms, against usurpation and lawless violence, is not rebellion by the law of God, or the land. Resistance to lawful authority makes rebellion. Hampden, Russell, Sydney, Somers, Holt, Tillotson, Burnet, Hoadley, &amp;c. were no tyrants nor rebels, altho’ some of them were in arms, and the others undoubtedly excited resistance, against the tories. Don’t beg the question, Mr. Massachusettensis, and then give yourself airs of triumph. Remember the frank Veteran acknowledges, that “the word rebel is a convertible term.”  
This writer next attempts to trace the spirit of opposition, through the general court, and the courts of common law. “It was the policy of the whigs, to have their questions upon high matters determined by yea and nay votes, which were published in the gazettes.” And ought not great questions to be so determined?

 of the people? It is extreamly provoking to courtiers, that they can’t vote, as the cabinet direct them, against their consciences, the known sense of their constituents, and the obvious good of the community, without being detected. Generally, perhaps universally, no unpopular measure in a free government, particularly the English, ought ever to pass. Why have the people a share in the legislature, but to prevent such measures from passing, I mean such as are disapproved by the people at large? But did not these yea and nay votes, expose the whigs as well as tories to the impartial judgment of the public? If the votes of the former were given for measures injurious to the community, had not the latter an equal opportunity of improving them to the disadvantage of their adversaries in the next election? Besides, were not those few persons in the house, who generally voted for unpopular measures, near the governor, in possession of his confidence? Had they not the absolute disposal in their towns and counties of the favours of government? Were not all the judges, justices, sheriffs, coroners and military officers in their towns, made upon their recommendation? Did not this give them a prodigious weight and influence? Had the whigs any such advantage? And does not the influence of these yea and nay votes, consequently prove to a demonstration, the unanimity of the people, against the measures of the court?

 court.  
If “one set of members in committee, had always prepared the resolves,” &amp;c. which they did not, what would this prove, but that this set was thought by the house the fittest for the purpose? Can it ever be otherwise? Will any popular assembly chuse its worst members for the best services? Will an assembly of patriots chuse courtiers to prepare votes against the court? No resolves against the claims of parliament or administration, or the measures of the governor, (excepting those against the stamp act, and perhaps the answers to governor Hutchinson’s speeches upon the supremacy of parliament) ever passed through the house, without meeting an obstacle. The governor had to the last hour of the house’s existence, always some seekers and expectants in the house, who never failed to oppose, and offer the best arguments they could, and were always patiently heard. That the lips of the dissentients were sealed up: that they sat in silence, and beheld with regret, measures they dar’d not oppose, are groundless suggestions, and gross reflections upon the honour or courage of those members. The debates of this house were public, and every man who has attended the gallery knows there never was more freedom of debate, in any assembly.  
Massachusettensis, in the next place, conducts us to the agent, and tells us “there cannot be a provincial agent without an appointment by the three branches of the assembly. The whigs soon found that they could not have such services rendered them, from a provincial agent as would answer their purposes.”  
  
The treatment this province has received, respecting the agency, since Mr. Hutchinson’s administration commenced, is a flagrant example of injustice. There is no law, which requires the province to maintain any agent in England, much less is there any reason which necessarily requires, that the three branches should join in the appointment. In ordinary times, indeed, when a harmony prevails among the branches, it is well enough to have an agent constituted by all: But in times when the foundations of the constitution are disputed, and certainly attacked, by one branch or the other, to pretend that the house ought to join the governor in the choice, is a palpable absurdity. It is equivalent to saying that the people shall have no agent at all; that all communication between them and their sovereign shall be cut off; and that there shall be no channel through which complaints and petitions may be conveyed to the royal ear; because a governor will not concur in an agent whose sentiments are not like his; nor will an agent of the governor’s appointment be likely to urge accusations against him with any diligence or zeal, if the people have occasion to complain against him.  
Every private citizen, much more every representative body, have an undoubted right to petition the king; to convey such petition by any agent, and to pay him for his service. Mr. Bernard, to do him justice, had so much regard to these principles, as to consent to the payment of the people’s agents while he staid. But Mr. Hutchinson was scarcely seated in the chair as lieut. governor, before we had intelligence from England, that my lord Hillsborough told Dr. Franklin, he had received a letter from governor Hutchinson, soliciting an instruction against consenting to the salary of the agent. Such an instruction was accordingly soon sent, and no agent for the board or house, has received a farthing for services since that time, although Dr. Franklin and Mr. Bollan have taken much pains, and one of them expended considerable sums of money. There is a meanness in this play that would disgrace a gambler. A manifest fear that the truth should be known to the sovereign or the people. Many persons have thought that the province ought to have dismiss’d all agents from that time, as useless and nugatory, this behaviour amounting to a declaration, that we had no chance or hopes of justice from such a minister.  
But this province, at least as meritorious as any, has been long accustomed to indignities and injustice, and to bear both with unparallelled patience. Others, have pursued the same method before and since, but we have never heard that their agents are unpaid. They would scarcely have born it with so much r

.  
From the date of our charter, to the time of the Stamp Act, and indeed since that time (notwithstanding the misrepresentations of our charter constitution, as too popular and republican) the council of this province have been generally on the side of the governor and the prerogative. For the truth of this, I appeal to our whole history and experience. The art and power of governors, and especially the negative, have been a stronger motive on the one hand, than the annual election of the two houses on the other. In disputes between the governor and the house, the council have generally adhered to the former, and in many cases have complied with his humour when scarcely any council by mandamus, upon this continent, would have done it.  
But in the time of the Stamp Act, it was found productive of many mischiefs and dangers, to have officers of the crown, who were dependent on the ministry, and judges of the superior court whose offices were thought incompatible with a voice in the legislature, members of council.  
In May 1765, Lt. Gov. Hutchinson, Sec. Oliver, and Mr. Belcher were officers of the crown, the judges of the superior court, and some other gentlemen who held commissions under the governor, were members of council. Mr. Hutchinson was chief justice and a judge of probate for the first county, as well as lieut. governor, and a counsellor, too many offices for the greatest and best man in the world to hold, too much business for any man to do; besides, that these offices were frequently clashing and interfering with each other. Two other justices of the superior court were councilors, and nearly and closely connected with him by family alliances. One other justice was judge of admiralty during pleasure. Such a jumble of offices, never got together before in any English government. It was found in short, that the famous triumvirate, Bernard, Hutchinson and Oliver, the ever memorable, secret, confidential letter writers, whom I call the junto, had by degrees, and before people were aware of it, erected a tyranny in the province. Bernard had all the executive, and a negative on the legislative; Hutchinson and Oliver, by their popular arts and secret intrigues, had elevated to the board, such a collection of crown officers, and their own relations, as to have too much influence there: and they had three of a family on the superior bench, which is the supreme tribunal in all causes civil and criminal, vested with all the powers of the king’s bench, common pleas and exchequer, which gave them power over every act of this court. This junto therefore had the legislative and executive in their controul, and more natural influence over the judicial, than is ever to be trusted in any set of men in the world. The public accordingly found all these springs and wheels in the constitution set in motion to promote submission to the stamp act, and to discountenance resistance to it; and they thought they had a violent presumption, that they would forever be employed to encourage a compliance with all ministerial measures and parliamentary claims, of whatever character they might be.  
The designs of the junto, however, were concealed as carefully as possible. Most persons were jealous; few were certain. When the assembly met in May 1766, after the stamp-act was repealed, the whigs flattered themselves with hopes of peace and liberty for the future. Mr. Otis, whose abilities and integrity; whose great exertions and most exemplary sacrifices of his private interest to the public service, had intitled him to all the promotion which the people could bestow, was chosen speaker of the house. Bernard negatived the choice. It can scarcely be conceived by a stranger, what an alarm this manoeuvre gave to the public. It was thought equivalent to a declaration, that altho’ the people had been so successful as to obtain a repeal of the stamp-act, yet they must not hope to be quiet long, for parliament, by the declaratory act, had asserted its supreme authority, and new taxations and regulations should be made, if the junto could obtain them: and every man who should dare to oppose such projects, let his powers, or virtues, his family or fortune be what they would, should be surely cut off from all hopes of advancement. The electors thought it high time to be upon their guard. All the foregoing reasons and motives prevailed with the electors; and the crown officers and justices of the s

s our wily writer, “could do little or nothing without the Council by the Charter”—“if he call’d upon a military officer to raise the militia, he was answered they were there already,” &amp;c. The Council by the Charter, had nothing to do with the militia. The Governor alone had all authority over them. The council therefore are not to blame for their conduct. If the militia refuse obedience to the Captain General, or his subordinate officers, when commanded to assist in carrying into execution the Stamp Act, or in dispersing those who were opposing it, does not this prove the universal sense and resolution of the people not to submit to it? Did not a regular army do more to James the second? If those, over whom the governor had the most absolute authority and decisive influence, refused obedience, does not this shew how deeply rooted in all mens minds was the abhorrence of that unconstitutional power, which was usurping over them? “If he called upon the Council for their assistance, they must first enquire into the cause.” An unpardonable crime, no doubt! But is it the duty of a middle branch of legislature, to do as the first shall command them, implicitly, or to judge for themselves? Is it the duty of a privy council, to understand the subject before they give advice, or only to lend their names to any edict, in order to make it less unpopular? It would be a shame to answer such observations as these, if it was not for their wickedness. Our Council, all along, however, did as much as any Council could have done. Was the Mandamus Council at New-York able to do more, to influence the people to a submission to the Stamp act? Was the Chair, the Board, the Septennial House, with the assistance of General Gage and his troops, able to do more, in that city, than our branches did in this province? Not one Iota. Nor could Bernard, his Council, and House, if they had been unanimous, have induced submission. The people would have spurned them all, for they are not to be wheedled out of their liberties by their own Representatives, any more than by strangers. “If he wrote to government at home to strengthen his hands, some officious person procured and sent back his letters.” At last it seems to be acknowledged, that the governor did write for a military force, to strengthen government. For what? To enable it to enforce Stamp acts, Tea acts, and other internal regulations, the authority of which, the people were determined never to acknowledge.  
But what a pity it was that these worthy gentlemen could not be allowed, from the dearest affection to their native country, to which they had every possible attachment, to go on in profound confidential secrecy, procuring troops to cut our throats, acts of parliament to drain our purses and destroy our charters and assemblies, getting estates and dignities for themselves and their own families, and all the while most devoutly professing to be friends to our charter, enemies to parliamentary taxation, and to all pensions, without being detected? How happy! if they could have annihilated all our charters, and yet have been beloved, nay deified by the people, as friends and advocates for their charters? What masterly politicians! to have made themselves nobles for life, and yet have been thought very sorry that the two houses were deprived of the privilege of choosing the Council? How sagacious, to get large pensions for themselves, and yet be thought to mourn, that pensions and venality were introduced into the country? How sweet and pleasant! to have been the most popular men in the community, for being stanch and zealous dissenters, true-blue calvinists, and able advocates for public virtue and popular government, after they had introduced an American Episcopate, universal corruption among the leading men, and deprived the people of all share in their supreme legislative council? I mention an Episcopate, for altho’ I don’t know that Gov’s. Hutchinson and Oliver ever directly solicited for Bishops, yet they must have seen, that there would have been one effect, very soon, of establishing the unlimitted authority of parliament!  
I agree with this writer, that it was not the persons of Bernard, Hutchinson or Oliver, that made them obnoxious; but their principles and practices. And I will agree, that if Chatham, Campden and St. Asaph (I beg pardon for introducing these revered names into such company, and for making a supposition which is absurd) had been here, and prosecuted such schemes, they would have met with contempt and execration from this people. But when he says, “that had the intimations in those letters been attended to, we had now been as happy a people as good government could make us,” it is too gross to make us angry. We can do nothing but smile. Have not these intimations been attended to? Have not fleets and armies been sent here, whenever they requested? Have not Governors, Lt. Governors, Secretaries, Judges, Attorney Generals and Solicitor Generals salaries been paid out of the revenue as they solicited? Have not taxes been laid, and continued? Have not English Liberties been abridged as Hutchinson desired? Have not “penalties of another kind” been inflicted, as he desired? Has not our Charter been destroyed, and the Council put into the King’s hands, as Bernard requested? In short, almost all the wild mock pranks of this desperate triumverate have been attended to and adopted, and we are now as miserable as Tyranny can well make us. That Bernard came here with the affections of New Jersey, I never heard nor read, but in this writer. His abilities were considerable, or he could not have done such extensive mischief. His true British honesty and punctuality, will be acknowledged by none but such as owe all their importance to flattering him.  
That Hutchinson was amiable and exemplary, in some respects, and very unamiable and unexemplary, in others, is a certain truth: otherwise he never would have retained so much popularity on one hand, nor made so pernicious a use of it on the other. His behavior, in several important departments, was with ability and integrity, in cases which did not affect his political system, but he bent all his offices to that. Had he continued stedfast to those principles in religion and government, which in his former life he professed, and which alone had procured him the confidence of the people and all his importance, he would have lived and died, respected and beloved, and have done honor to his native country. But by renouncing these principles and that conduct, which had made him and all his ancestors respectable, his character is now considered by all America, and the best part of the three kingdoms, notwithstanding the coun­tenance he receives from the ministry, as a reproach to the province that gave him birth, as a man who by all his actions aimed at making himself great, at the expence of the liberties of his native country. This gentleman was open to flattery, in so remarkable a degree, that any man who would flatter him was sure of his friendship, and every one who would not, was sure of his enmity. He was credulous, in a ridiculous degree, of every thing that favoured his own plans, and equally incredulous of every thing which made against them. His natural abilities which have been greatly exaggerated by persons whom he had advanced to power, were far from being of the first rate. His industry was prodigious. His knowledge lay chiefly in the laws and politicks and history of this province, in which he had a long experience. Yet with all his advantages, he never was master of the true character of his native country, not even of New England and the Massachusetts Bay. Through the whole troublesome period since the last war, he manifestly mistook the temper, principles, and opinions of this people. He had resolved upon a system, and never could or would see the impracticability of it.  
It is very true that all his abilities, virtues, interests and connections, were insufficient; but for what? To prevail on the people to acquiese in the mighty claim of parliamentary authority. The constitution was not gone. The suggestion that it was is a vile slander. It had as much vigor as ever, and even the governor had as much power as ever, excepting in cases which affected that claim. “The spirit” says this writer “was truly republican.” It was not so in any one case whatever; any further than the spirit of the British constitution is republican. Even in the grand fundamental dispute, the people arranged themselves under their house of representatives and council, with as much order as ever, and conducted their opposition as much by the constitution as ever. It is true their constitution was employed against the measures of the junto, which created their enmity to it. However I have not such an horror of a republican spirit, which is a spirit of true virtue, and honest independence, I don’t mean on the king, but on men in power. This spirit is so far from being incompatible with the British constitution, that it is the greatest glory of it, and the nation has always been most prosperous when it has most prevailed and been most encouraged by the crown. I wish it increased in every part of the world, especially in America; and I think the measures the Tories are now pursuing, will increase it to a degree that will insure us in the end redress of grievances and an happy reconciliation with Great Britain.  
  
“Governor Hutchinson strove to convince us, by the principles of government, our charters and acknowledgments, that our claims were inconsistent with the subordination due to Great Britain,” &amp;c. says the writer.  
Suffer me to introduce here, a little history. In 1764, when the system of taxing and new moddling the colonies was first apprehended, Lieut. Governor Hutchinson’s friends struggled in several successive sessions of the General Court, to get him chosen agent for the province at the court of Great Britain. At this time he declared freely, that he was of the same sentiment with the people, that Parliament had no Right to tax them; but differed from the country party, only in his opinion of the policy of denying that Right, in their Petitions, &amp;c. I would not injure him, I was told this by three gentlemen who were of the committee of both houses, to prepare that petition that he made this declaration explicitly before that committee. I have been told by other gentlemen that he made the same declaration to them. It is possible that he might make use of expressions studied for the purpose, which would not strictly bear this construction. But it is certain that they understood him so, and that this was the general opinion of his sentiments until he came to the chair.  
The country party saw, that this aspiring genius, aimed at keeping fair with the ministry, by supporting their measures, and with the people, by pretending to be of our principles, and between both to trim himself up to the chair. The only reason why he did not obtain an election at one time, and was excused from the service at another after he had been chosen by a small majority, was because the members knew he would not openly deny the right, and assure his majesty, the parliament, and ministry, that the people never would submit to it. For the same reason he was left out of council. But he continued to cultivate his popularity and to maintain a general opinion among the people, that he denied the right in his private judgment, and this idea preserved most of those who continued their esteem for him.  
But upon Bernard’s removal, and his taking the chair as lieut. governor, he had no further expectations from the people nor complaisance for their opinions. In one of his first speeches he took care to advance the supreme authority of parliament. This astonished many of his friends. They were heard to say, we have been deceived. We thought he had been abused, but we now find what has been said of him is true. He is determined to join in the designs against this country. After his promotion to the government, finding that the people had little confidence in him, and shewing that he had no interest at home to support him but what he had acquired by joining with Bernard in kicking up a dust, he determined to stroke a bold stroke, and in a formal speech to both houses, became a champion for the unbounded authority of parliament, over the colonies. This he thought would lay the ministry under an obligation to support him in the government, or else to provide for him out of it, not considering that starting that question before that assembly, and calling upon them as he did to dispute with him upon it, was scattering firebrands, arrows and death in sport. The arguments he advanced were inconclusive indeed: but they shall be considered, when I come to the feeble attempt of Massachusettensis to give a colour to the same position.  
The house, thus called upon, either to acknowledge the unlimited authority of parliament, or confute his arguments, were bound by their duty to God, their country and posterity, to give him a full and explicit answer. They proved incontestibly that he was out in his facts, inconsistent with himself, and in every principle of his law, he had committed a blunder. Thus the fowler was caught in his own snare: and altho’ this country has suffered severe temporary calamities in consequence of this speech, yet I hope they will not be durable: but his ruin was certainly in part owing to it. Nothing ever opened the eyes of the people so much, to his designs, excepting his letters. Thus it is the fate of Massachusettensis, to praise this gentleman, for those things which the wise part of mankind condemn in him as the most insidious and mischievous of actions. If it was out of his power to do us any more injuries, I should wish to forget the part; but as there is reason to fear he is still to continue his malevolent labours against this country, altho’ he is out of our sight, he ought not to be out of our minds. This country has every thing to fear, in the present state of the British court, while the lords Bute, Mansfield and North have the principal conduct of affairs, from the deep intrigues of that

t situation.  
We are then told “that disaffection to Great-Britain was infused into the body of the people.” The leading whigs, have ever, systematically, and upon principle, endeavoured to preserve the people from all disaffection to the king on the one hand, and the body of the people on the other, but to lay the blame where it is justly due on the ministry and their instruments.  
We are next conducted into the superiour court, and informed “that the judges were dependant on the annual grants of the general court; that their salaries were small in proportion to the salaries of other officers, of less importance; that they often petitioned the assembly to enlarge them, without success, and were reminded of their dependance; that they remained unshaken amid the raging tempests, which is to be attributed rather to their firmness than situation.”  
That the salaries were small, must be allowed, but not smaller in proportion than those of other officers. All salaries in this Province have been and are small. It has been the policy of the country to keep them so, not so much from a spirit of parsimony, as an opinion, that the service of the public ought to be an honorary, rather than a lucrative employment; and that the great men ought to be obliged to set examples of simplicity and frugality before the people.  
But if we consider things maturely, and make allowance for all circumstances, I think the country may be vindicated. This province during the last war, had such overbearing burdens upon it, that it was necessiated to oeconomy in every thing. At the peace she was half a million sterling in debt, nearly. She thought it the best policy to get out of debt before she raised the wages of her servants, and if Great-Britain had thought as wisely, she would not now have had 140 millions to pay, and she would never have thought of taxing America.  
Low as the wages were, it was found that whenever a vacancy happened, the place was solicited with much more anxiety and zeal than the kingdom of heaven.  
Another cause which had its effect was this. The judges of that court had almost always enjoyed some other office. At the time of the stamp act the chief justice was lieut. governor, which yielded him a profit, and a judge of probate for the county of Suffolk, which yielded him another profit, and a counsellor, which if it was not very profitable, gave him an opportunity of promoting his family and friends to other profitable offices, an opportunity which the country saw he most religiously improved. Another justice of this court was a judge of admiralty, and another was judge of probate for the county of Plymouth. The people thought therefore, that as their time was not wholly taken up by their offices as judges of the superior court, there was no reason why they should be paid as much as if it had been.  
Another reason was this: those justices had not been bred to the bar, but taken from merchandize, husbandry and other occupations; had been at no great expence for education or libraries, and therefore the people thought that equity did not demand large salaries.  
It must be confessed that another motive had its weight. The people were growing jealous of the chief justice and two other justices at least, and therefore thought it imprudent to enlarge their salaries, and by that means their influence.  
Whether all these arguments were sufficient to vindicate the people for not enlarging their salaries, I shall leave to you, my friends, whose right it is to judge. But that the judges petition’d “often” to the assembly I don’t remember. I knew it was suspected by many, and confidently affirmed by some, that judge Russell carried home with him in 1766, a petition to his Majesty, subscribed by himself, and chief justice Hutchinson at least, praying his Majesty to take the payment of the judges into his own hands; and that this petition, together with the solicitations of Governor Bernard, and others, had the success to procure the act of parliament, to enable his Majesty to appropriate the revenue to the support of the administration of justice, &amp;c. from whence a great part of the present calamities of America have flowed.  
That the high whigs took care to get themselves chosen of the grand juries I don’t believe. Nine tenths of the people were high whigs; and therefore it was not easy to get a grand jury without nine whigs in ten, in it. And the matter would not be much mended by the new act of parliament. The sheriff must return the same set of jurors, court after court, or else his juries would be nine tenths of them high whigs still. Indeed the tories are so envenom’d now with malice, envy, revenge and disappointed ambition, that they would be willing, for what I know, to be jurors for life, in order to give verdicts against the whigs. And many of them would readily do it, I doubt not, without any other law or evidence, than what they found in their own breasts. The suggestion of ledgerdemain, in drawing the names of petit jurors out of the box, is scandalous. Human wisdom cannot devise a method of obtaining petit jurors more fairly, and better secured against a possibility of corruption of any kind, than that established by our provincial law. They were drawn by chance out of a box, in open town meeting, to which the tories went, or might have gone, as well as the whigs, and have seen with their own eyes, that nothing unfair ever did or could take place. If the jurors consisted of whigs, it was because the freeholders were whigs, that is honest men. But now, it seems, if Massachusettensis can have his will, the sh

Ts treatment this Province has received re-  
ſpecting the Agency, ſince Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s  
Adminiftration commenced, is a flagratit ex-  
ample of injuſtice. There is no hw which re-  
quires&quot; the Province to maintain any Agent in  
England, much leſs is there any reaſon which  
neceflarify requires, that the three branches  
mould join in appointment. In ordinaty times,  
indeed, when a harmony prevails among the  
branches, it is well enc to have an Agent  
cpuntltutell by all; but in times when the  
foundations of the Conſtitution are diſputed,  
and certainty attacked by one branch or the  
other, to pretend that the Houſe ought to join  
the Governor in the choice, is a palpable ab-  
ſurdity. It is equivalent to faying, that the  
People &quot;hall have no Agent at all; that alt  
tommunlcation between them and their So-  
vereign mall be cut off; and that there ſhall  
be no channel through which Complaints and  
petitions may be conveyed to the Royal Ear;  
becaufe a Governor will not concur in an Agent,  
whoſe ſentiments are not like his; nor will an  
Agent of the Governor&#x27;s appointment be likely

3 private Citiaen, much more every  
Repreſentative Body, have an undaubted right

Mr. Bernard, to do him juſtice, had ſo much  
regard to theſe principles, as to conſent to the  
payment of the People&#x27;s Agents, while he ſtaid.  
But Mr. Hutchinſon was ſcarcely ſeated in the  
Chair as Lieutenant Governor, before we had  
intelligence from England, that Lord Hillſ-  
borough told Dr. Franklin, he had a letter  
from Governor Hutchinſon, ſaliciting an in-  
ſtruction againſt conſenting to the ſalary of the  
Agent. Such an inſtruction was accordingly  
ſoon ſent; and no Agent for the Board or Houſe  
has received a farthing for ſervices ſince that  
time, although Dr. Franklin and Mr. Bollan  
have taken much pains, and one of them ex-  
pended conſiderable ſums of money. There is  
a meanneſs in this play that would diſgrace a  
gambler : A manifeſt fear that the truth ſhould  
be known to the Sovereign or the People, —

\ Taar Mr. Hutchinſon was amiable and ex-  
emplary in ſome reſpects, and very unamiable and  
unexemplary in others, is a certain truth ; other-  
wiſe he never would have retained ſo much po-  
pularity on the one hand, nor made ſo perni-  
eious a uſe of it on the other. His behaviour,  
in ſeveral important departments, was with abi-  
lity and integrity, in caſes which did not affect  
his political ſyſtem ; but he bent all his offices  
to that. Had he continued ſtedfaſt to thoſe  
Principles in Religion and Government, which  
in his former life he profeſſed, and which alone  
had procured him the confidence of the People,  
and all his importance, he would have lived and  
died reſpected and beloved, and have done ho-  
nour to his native country; but by renouncing  
theſe principles, and that conduct which had  
made him and all his Anceſtors reſpectable, his  
character is now conſidered by all America, and  
the beſt part of the three kingdoms, notwith-  
ſtanding the countenance he receives from the  
Miniſtry, as a reproach to the Province that  
pave him birth, as a man who by all his actions  
aimed at making himſelf great, at the expence  
of the Liberties of his native country. This  
Gentleman was open to flattery in fo remark-  
able&#x27;a degree, that any man who would flatret  
him was fure of his friendſhip, and every ons  
who would not was ſure of his enmity.— He  
  
__ K was  
  
  
was eredulous, in a ridiculous degree, of every  
thing that favoured his own plans; and equally  
incredulous of every thing which made againſt  
them.— His natural abilities, which have been  
greatly exaggerated by perſons whom he had  
advanced to power, were far from being of the  
firſt rate —His induſtry was prodigious, —His  
knowledge lay chiefly in the laws, and politics,  
and hiſtory of this Province, in which he had a  
long experience. Yet with all his advantages,  
he never was maſter of the true character of his  
native country, not even of New England and  
the Maſſachuſets Bay.—Through the whole  
troubleſome period ſince the laſt war, he mani-  
feſtly miſtook the temper, principles, and opi-  
nions of this People. He had reſolved upon a  
Syſtem, and never could or would ſee the im-  
  
; of it.  
  
Ir is very true that all his abilities, virtucs,  
intereſts, and connections, were inſufficient; but  
for what? To prevail on the People to acquieſce  
in the mighty claim of Parliamentary Autho-  
rity ? The Conſtitution was not gone, The  
ſuggeſtion that it was, is a vile ſlander. It had  
as much vigour as ever, and even the Governor  
had as much power as ever, excepting in caſes  
which affected that claim. —“ The ſpirit,” ſay  
the . WW: « y was truly xepyÞh- |  
  
6c can,”  
  
* 7 /  
«© can.” It was not fo, in any one caſe what  
ever, any further than the ſpirit of the Britiſh:  
Conſtitution is republican. —Even in the grand  
fundamental Diſpute, the People arranged them-  
felves under their Houſe of Repreſentatives and  
Council, with as much order as ever, and con-  
ducted their oppoſition as much by the Conſti-  
tution as ever, It is true, their Conſtitution  
was employed againſt the meaſures of the Junto,  
which created their enmity to it —However, I  
have not ſuch an horror of a republican ſpirit,  
which is a ſpirit of true virtue, and honeſt in-  
dependence; I do not mean on the King, but on  
Men in Power, This ſpirit is ſo far from being  
incompatible wit the Britiſh Conſtitution, that  
It 15 the greateſt glory of it; and the Nation has  
always been moſt proſperous when it has moſt  
prevailed, and been moſt encouraged” by the  
Crown. TI wiſh it increaſed in every part of the  
world, efpecially in America; and I think the

F ments, that our Claims were inconſiſtent with  
te the Subordination due to Great Britain.“  
  
N me to n e; here a little Hiſtory,  
Io 1764, when the Syſtem of taxing and new  
modelling the Colonics was firſt apprehended,  
Lieutenant Governor Hutchinſon&#x27;s friends ſtrug-  
gled in ſeveral ſucceſſive Seſſions of the General  
Court, to get him choſen Agent for the Pro-  
vince at the Court of Great Britain. At this time  
he declared freely, That he was of the ſame  
5 ſentiment with the People, that Parliament  
had no right to tax them; but differed from  
** the Country Party only in his opinion of the  
$6 policy of denying that Right in their Peti-  
te tions, &amp;c.”—I wauld nat injure him; I was  
told this by three Gentlemen who were of the  
Committee of both Houſes to prepare that Pe-  
tition, that he made this declaration explicitly  
before that Committee. I have been told by  
other Gentlemen, that he made the ſame decla-  
ration to them, It is poſſible that he might  
make uſe; of expreſſions ſtudied for the pur-  
poſe, which would not- ſtrictly bear this con-  
ſtruction. But it is certain, that they under-  
ſtood him ſo, and that this was the genera]  
  
ym! has ſrocuments until he came to the  
&quot;ofa &quot;Ty  
  
(- 69. »  
  
Tus Country Party ſaw that this aſpiring ge-  
nius aimed at keeping fair with the Miniſtry,  
by ſupporting their meaſures; and with the Peo-  
ple, by pretending to be of our principles; and  
between both to trim himſelf up to the Chair,  
The only reaſon why he did not obtain an elec-  
tion at one time, and was excuſed from the ſer-  
vice at another, after he had becn choſen by a  
ſmall Majority, was, becauſe the Members knew  
he would not openly deny the right, and aſſure  
his Majeſty, the Parliament, and:;Miniſtry, that  
the People never would ſubmit to it. For the  
ſame reaſon he was left out of Council. But he  
continued to cultivate his popularity, and to  
maintain a general opinion among the People,  
that he denied the right in his private judgment;  
and this idea preſerved moſt of thoſe who con-  
tinued their eſteem for him.  
  
Bur upon Bernard&#x27;s removal, and his  
taking the Chair as Lieutenant Governor, he  
had. no further expectations from the People,  
nor, complaiſance for their opinions. In one of  
bis, firſt. ſpeeches, he took care to advance the  
Supreme Authority of Parliament. This aſto-  
niſhed many of his friends. They were heard  
to ſay, We have been deceived,” We thought  
he had been abuſed; but we now find what has  
= been  
  
© &gt;  
been faid of him is true. He is determined ta  
join in the defigns againſt this country.” After  
his promotion to the Government, finding that  
the People had little confidence in him, and  
ſhewing that he had no intereſt at home to ſup.  
port him, but what he had acquired by joining  
with Bernard, he determined to ftrike a bold  
ftroke, and, in a formal ſpeech to both Houſes,  
become a Champion for the unbounded Autho-  
rity of Parliament over the Colonies. This he  
thought would lay the Miniftry under an obli-  
gation to ſupport him in the Government, or  
ele to provide for him out of it; not conſider-  
ing, that ſtating that queſtion before that Aſ-  
ſembly, and calling upon them as he did to diſ-  
pute with him upon it, was ſcattering firebrands,  
  
  
Tar Houſe thus called upon, either to ac.  
  
  
ment, or confute his arguments, were bound  
by their duty to God, their Country and Pofte.  
rity, to give him a full and explicit anſwer.—  
They proved inconteſtibly, that he was out in  
his facts, inconſiſtent with himſelf, and in every  
principle of his law he had committed a blun-  
der. And although this country has ſuffered  
ſevere ealamities in conſequence of this ſpeech!  
990 yet  
  
FER WT.  
yet I hope they will not be durable; but his  
  
ruin was certainly in part owing to it. Nothing  
ever opened the eyes of the People ſo much to  
his deſigns, excepting his Letters. If it was  
out of his power to do us any more injuries, I  
ſhould wiſh to forget the paſt; but as there is  
reaſon to fear he is ſtill to continue his labours  
againſt this country, although he is out of our  
fight, he ought not to be out of our minds.—  
This country has every thing to fear, in the  
preſent ſtate of the Britiſh Court, while the  
Lords Bute, Mansfield, and North, have the  
principal conduct of affairs, from the intrigues  
  
of that man,  
  
Ws are then told “ that Diſaffection to Great  
C Britain was infuſed into the Body of the Peo-  
«© ple.” The leading Whigs have ever ſyſte-  
matically, and upon principle, endeavoured to  
preſerve the People from all diſaffection to the  
King on the one hand, and the Body of the  
People on the other; but to lay the blame  
where it is juſtly due, on the Miniſtry and their  
  
inſtruments.

Court, and informed ** that the Judges were

gods . neral

cc neral Court; that their ſalaries were ſmall in  
e proportion to the ſalaries of other Officers of  
«© leſs importance; that they often petitioned  
« the Aſſembly to enlarge them, without ſuc-  
c cefs, and were reminded of their depend-  
« ence; that they remained unſhaken amid the  
« raging tempeſts, which is to be attributed  
rather to their firmneſs than ſituation.“  
  
Trar the ſalaries were ſmall, muſt be allowed;  
but not ſmaller in proportion than thoſe of other  
Officers. All ſalaries in this Province have been  
ſmall. It has been the policy of the country  
to keep them ſo; not ſo much from a ſpirit of  
parſimony, as an opinion, that the ſervice of the  
Public ought to be an honorary, rather than a  
lucrative employment; and that the great men  
ought to be obliged to ſet examples of fimpli-  
diy and fragalicy before che Feopte,  
  
Bur if we confider things cant, and make  
allowance for all circumſtances, I think the  
Etountry may be vindicated: - This Province,  
during the laſt war, had ſuch overbearing bur-  
dens upon it, that it was neceffitated to eco-  
nomy in everything. At the peace ſhe was half  
a million ſterling in debt. She thought it the

not been bred to the Bar, but taken from Mere.

equity did not demand large ſalaries. ä  
  
Wuxrxxx all theſe arguments were ſufficient  
to vindicate the People for not enlarging their  
ſalaries, I ſhall leave to you, my friends, whoſe  
right it is, to judge. — But that the Judges pe-  
titioned often” to the Afembly, I don&#x27;t re-

tition to his Majeſty, ſubſeribed by himſelf  
and Chief * Juftice Hutchinſon at leaſt, pray ing  
his Majelty to. take the payment of the Judges

together with the ſolicitations of Governor  
Bernard, and others, had. the ſucceſs to pro-  
cure the Act of Parliament, to enable his Ma-  
  
  
of the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, &amp;c.. from  
whence a great part of the preſent calamities ol  
America have flowed.

THrar the high Whigs took care to get them-  
ſelves choſen of the Grand Juries, I do not  
believe. Nine tenths of the People were high  
Whigs; and therefore it was not eaſy to get a  
Grand Jury without nine Whigs in ten in it.  
And the matter would not be much mended by  
the new Act of Parliament. The Sheriff muſt  
return the ſame ſet of Jurors, Court after Court,  
or elſe his Juries would be nine tenths of them  
high Whigs ſtill. —Indeed the Tories are ſo en-  
  
venomed with malice, enyy, rage, and diſa  
pointed ambition, that they would be willing,  
for what I know, to be Jurors for life, in  
order to give verdicts againſt the Whigs.—  
And many of them would readily do it, I doubt  
not, without any other law or evidence, than  
&#x27; what they found in their own breaſts. The  
ſuggeſtion of Legerdemain, in drawing the  
.names of Petit Jurors out of the box, is ſcan-  
dalous. Human wiſdom cannot deviſe a  
method of obtaining Petit Jurors more fairly,  
and better ſecured againſt a poſſibility of cor-  
ruption of any kind, than that eſtabliſhed by  
our Provincial Law. They were drawn by  
chance out of a box, in open Town Meeting, to  
which the Tories went, or might have gone, as  
well as the Whigs, and have ſeen, with their  
own eyes, that nothing unfair ever did or  
could take place. If the Jurors conſiſted of

“But what a pity it was, that these worthy gen-  
iemen could not be allowed, from the dearest af-  
ction to their native country, to which they had  
very possible attachment, to go on in profound  
onfidential secrecy, procuring troops fo cut our  
roats, acts of parliament to drain our purses,  
estroy our charters and assemblies, getting estates  
nd dignities for themselves and their own families,  
d all the while most devoutly professing to be  
iends to our charter, enemies to parliamentary  
rxation, and to all pensions, without being dcetect-  
  
! How happy! If they could have annihilated  
\, our charters, and yet have been beloved, nay  
eified by the pecple, as friends and advocates for  
er charters. What masterly politicians! To  
ave made themselves nobles for life, and yet have  
Been thought very sorry that the two houses were  
eprived of the privilege of chusing the council.  
jow sagacious, to get large pensions for them-  
elves, and yet be theught to mourn, that pensions  
nd yenality were introduced into the country !—  
jow sweet and pleasant! To have been the most  
opular men in the community, for being staunch  
nd zealous dissenters, true-blue Calvinists, and  
ble advocates for public virtue and popular go-  
emment, after they had introduced an American  
piscopate, universal corruption among the leading  
nen, and deprived the people of all share in their  
upreme legislative council! I mention an episco-  
hate; for although I do not know that governors  
jutchinson and Oliver ever directly solicited for  
ishops, yet they must have seen, that these would  
ave been one effect very soon, of establishing the  
hilimited authority of parliament.”

The character of Hutchinson is thus drawn:  
“This gentleman was open to flattery in so re-  
atkable a degree, that any man who would flatter  
iim was sure of his friendship, and every one who  
vould not was sure of his enmity. He was credulous  
  
aridiculous degree, of every thing that favored  
his own plans; and equally incredulous of every  
hing which made agaist them. His natural abili-  
ies, which have been greatly exaggerated by per-  
sons whom he had advanced to power, were far from  
being of the first rate. His mdustry was prodigious.  
is knowledge lay chiefly in the laws, and politics,  
uid history of this province, in which he had a long  
experience, Yet with all his advantages, he never  
jas Master of the true character of his native  
ountry, not even of New-England and the Mas-  
Sichusetts bay.—Through the whole troublesome  
period since the last war, he manifestly mistook  
he temper, principles, and opinions ef this people.

How could the juries be other than whigs, when nine tenths  
of the people were such ; or how could they punish as crimes  
what they deemed upright and lawful resistance to illegal
