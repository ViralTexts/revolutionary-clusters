A VIRGINIA ORATOR AT THE CENTENNIAL.  
The 7th of June, 1776, the anniversary of  
which was commemorated at the Pennsylva-­  
nia Academy of the Fine Arts yesterday af­  
ternoon by some interesting ceremonies, is  
an event we cannot forget. On that day  
Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, offered the  
following resolution, which may be called  
the initial step of the great drama which  
began on the ith of July succeeding:  
Resolved, That these United Colonies are,  
and of right ought to be, free and independ-­  
ent States; that they are absolved from all  
allegiance to the British Crown; and that all  
political connection between them and the  
State of Great Britain is, and ought to be,  
totally dissolved.  
That it is expedient forthwith to take the  
most effectual measures for forming foreign  
alliances.  
That a plan of confederation be prepared  
and transmitted to the respective Colonies  
for their consideration and approbation.  
Last evening, one hundred years after the  
foregoing, the grandson of Patrick Henry,  
william Wirt Henry, in an address of very  
great ability, quietly recalled this event,  
while the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine  
Arts threw open its halls to a large and in­  
telligent audience. The address of Mr.  
Henry itself was followed by speeches from  
others, which, on motion of James L. Clag-­  
horn, president of the Academy, were or-­  
dered to be printed in the archives of the  
institution. EdiTOrIal FOrNEY&#x27;S Press
