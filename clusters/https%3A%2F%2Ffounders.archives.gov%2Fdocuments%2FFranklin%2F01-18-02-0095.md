ort, where is the Check upon his Power? He becomes absolute, and may act as he pleases: He may make Use of his Power, not for the Good of those who are under it, but for his own private seperate Advantage, or any other Purpose to which he may be inclined or instructed by him upon whom alone he depends. Such an Independency threatens the very Being of a free Constitution; and if it takes Effect will produce and firmly establish a Tyranny upon its Ruin. The Act of Parliament of the 7th. Geo. 3, intitled An Act for granting certain Duties in the Colonies &amp;c. declares that it is expedient that a Revenue should be raised in his Majesty’s Dominions in America, for making more certain and adequate Provision for defreying the Charge of the Administration of Justice, and the Support of the Civil Government in such Provinces where it shall be found necessary, and towards further defreying the Expences of defending, protecting and securing the said Dominions. These are the very Purposes for which this Government by the Charter is empowered to grant Taxes—So that by the Act aforementioned the Charter is in Effect made void.  
Agreable to the Design of that Act, the Governor it seems is first to be made independent, and in Pursuance of the Plan of Despotism, the Judges of the Land and all other i

cestors had submitted to the unreasonable and uncharitable Usurpations, Exactions and Impositions of the See of Rome in the Reign of Henry the Eighth. Soon would they have sunk into a State of abject Slavery to that haughty Power which exalteth it self above all that is called God: but they had the true Spirit of Liberty, and by exerting it they saved themselves and their Posterity. The Act of Parliament passed in the 25th. of that Reign is so much to our present Purpose, that we cannot help transcribing a Part of it, and refer you to the Statute at large. In the Preamble it is declared that the Realm of England “hath been, and is free from Subjection to any Man’s Laws but only to such as have been devised, made and ordained within the Realm for the Wealth of the same”; and further, “It standeth therefore with natural Equity and good Reason, that in every such Law humane, made within this Realm or induced into this Realm by the said Sufferance, Consent, and Customs, your Royal Majesty, and your Lords Spiritual and temporal, and Commons representing the whole State of your Realm in this your Majesty’s high Court of Parliament, hath full Power and Authority, not only to dispence but also to authorize some elect Person or Persons to dispense with those and all other humane Laws of this your Realm, and with every one of them as the Quality of the Persons and Matter may require. And also the said Laws and every one of them to abrogate, annul, amplify or diminish, as it shall seem to your Majesty, and the Nobles and Commons of your Realm present in your Parliament meet and convenient for the Wealth of your Realm. And because that it is now in these Days present seen that the State, Dignity, Superiority, Reputation and Authority of the said imperial Crown of this Realm by the long Sufferance of the said unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and Exactions is much and sore decayed, and the People of this Realm thereby impoverished.”  
It is then enacted, “That no Person or Persons of the Realm, or of any other his Majesty’s Dominions shall from henceforth pay any Pensions, Censes, Portions, Peter pence, or any other Impositions to the Use of the said Bishop or of the See of Rome, but that all such Pensions &amp;c which the said Bishop or Pope hath heretofore taken &amp;c, shall clearly surcease and never more be levied, nor paid to any Person or Persons in any manner or wise.” Nothing short of the Slavery and Ruin of the Nation would have been the Consequence of their submitting to those Exactions: and the same will be the Fate of America if the present Revenu
