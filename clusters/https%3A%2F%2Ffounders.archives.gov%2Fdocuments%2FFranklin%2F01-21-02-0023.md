Gentlemen,  
London, Feb. 2. 1774  
I received the Honour of your Letter dated Decr. 21. containing a distinct Account of the Proceedings at Boston relative to the Tea imported there, and of the Circumstances that occasioned its Destruction. I communicated the same to Lord Dartmouth, with some other Advices of the same Import. It is yet unknown what Measures will be taken here on the Occasion; but the Clamour against the Proceeding is high and general. I am truly concern’d, as I believe all considerate Men are with you, that there should seem to any a Necessity for carrying Matters to such Extremity, as, in a Dispute about Publick Rights, to destroy private Property; This (notwithstanding the Blame justly due to those who obstructed the Return of the Tea) it is impossible to justify with People so prejudiced in favour of the Power of Parliament to tax America, as most are in this Country. As the India Company however are not our Adversaries, and the offensive Measure of sending their Teas did not take its Rise with them, but was an Expedient of the Ministry to serve them and yet avoid a Repeal of the old Act, I cannot but wish and hope that before any compulsive Measures are thought of here, our General Court will have shewn a Disposition to repair the Damage and make Compensation to the Company. This all our Friends here wish with me; and that if War is finally to be made upon us, which some threaten, an Act of violent Injustice on our part, unrectified, may not give a colourable Pretence for it. A speedy Reparation will immediately set us right in the Opinion of all Europe. And tho’ the Mischief was the Act of Persons unknown, yet as probably they cannot be found or brought to answer for it, there seems to be some reasonable Claim on the Society at large in which it happened. Making voluntarily such Reparation can be no Dishonour to us or Prejudice to our Claim of Rights, since Parliament here has frequently considered in the same Light similar Cases; and only a few Years since, when a valuable Sawmill, which had been erected at a great Expence was violently destroyed by a Number of Persons supposed to be Sawyers, but unknown, a Grant was made out of the Publick Treasury of Two Thousand Pounds to the Owner as a Compensation. I hope in thus freely (and perhaps too forwardly) expressing my Sentiments and Wishes, I shall not give Offence to any. I am sure I mean well; being ever with sincere Affection to my native Country, and great Respect to the Assembly and yourselves, Gentlemen, Your most obedient and most humble Servant

London, February 2, 1774.  
Gentlemen: I received the Honor of  
your Letter dated Decr. 21 containing a  
distinct Account of the Proceedings at  
Boston relative to the Tea imported  
there, and of the Circumstances that oc  
casioned its Destruction. I communt­  
cated the same to Lord Dartmouth, with  
some other Advices of the same Import.  
It is yet unknown what Measures will be  
taken here on the Occasion; but the Clae  
mour against the Proceeding is high and  
general. I am truly concernd, as I be  
fieve all considerate Men are with you,  
that there should seem to any a Necessity  
for carrying Matters to such Extremity.  
as in a Dispute about Publick Rights, to  
destroy private Property: This motwith  
standing the Blame justly due to those  
who obstructed the Return of the Tea)  
it is impossibly to justify with People so  
prejudiced in favour of the Power of  
Parliament to tax America, as most are  
in this Country.  
As the India Company, however, are not  
our Adversaries, and the offensive Mea-  
sure of sending their Teas did not take  
its Rise with them, but was an Expedient  
of the Ministry to serve them and yet  
avold a repeal of the old Act, I cannot  
but wish e hope that before any compul-  
sive Measures are thought of here, our  
General Court will have shewn a Dispo-  
sition to repair the Damage and make  
Compensation to the Company. This all  
our Friends here wish with me; and that  
if War is finally to be made upon us,  
which some threaten, an Act of violent  
Injustice on our part, unrectifed, may  
not give a colourable Pretence for it.  
A speedy Reparation will immediately  
set us right in the Opinion of all Europe.  
And tho the Mischief was the Act of  
Persons unknown, yet as probably they  
cannot be found or brought to answer for  
it, there seems to be some reasonable  
Ciaim on the Society at large in which it  
happened. Making voluntarily such Repae  
ration can be no Dishonor to us or Pre  
judice to our Claim of Rights, since par­  
liament here has frequently considered in  
the same Light similar Cases; and only  
a few Years since, when a valuable Saw-  
mill, which had been erected at a great  
Expence, was violently destroyed by a  
Number of Persons, supposed to be Saw-  
yers, but unknown, a Grant was made  
out of the Publick Treasury of Two  
Thousand Pounds to the Owner as a com-  
pensation.  
I hope in thus freely fand perhaps too  
forwardly) expressing my Sentiments a  
Wishes. I shall not give Offence to any,  
I am sure I mean well; being ever with  
sincere Affection to my native Country,  
and great Respect to the Assembly and  
yourselves.  
Gentlemen.  
Your most obedient  
and most humble Servent,
