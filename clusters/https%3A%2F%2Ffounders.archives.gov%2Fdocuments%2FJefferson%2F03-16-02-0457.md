Musticello, Jan. 19, 1S21.  
Dear Sir:  
I duly received yotir favor of the 11th, cover­  
ing Judge Roane’* letter, which I now return. Of  
the kindness of his sentiments, expressed toward*  
myself, I ain highly sensible; and consequently, I  
believe, that my public services had merited the  
approbation he so indulgently bestows. The satis­  
faction I should deiive fiotn it would be reward  
enough. To his wi«h that I would take a part in  
the trai saclions of the pie-ent day, I mn sensible  
of my incompetence. For first, 1 know little a­  
bout them, having long withdrawn niy attention  
from public affair*, and resigned myself with fold­  
ed arms to the care of those who are to care for  
us all. And, next, the hand of time pressing hea­  
vily on me, in mind as well as body, leaves to nei­  
ther sufficient energy to engage in public conten­  
tions. I am sensible of the inroads daily making  
by the federal, into the jurisdiction of i:s co-ordi­  
nate associ ites. the state governments. The legis­  
lative and executive branches may sometimes err,  
but elections and dependsnee will bring them to  
rights. The judiciary branch is the instrument  
which working, like gravity, without intermission,  
i« to press us, at last, into one consolidated mass.  
Against tins 1 know no one who, equally with  
j Judge Koane himself, posse-ses the power a?tj the  
; courage to make resistance; and to him I look, and  
! have long looked, a* our strongest bulwark. It  
j Congress fails to shield the siatesfrom dangeis so  
palpable and so imminent, the states must shiel I  
thein-eives and meet the invader foot to foot.  
This is already half done by Col. Taylor’s book :  
because, a conviction that we are right accom  
plishes half the difficulty of correcting wiong  
This book is the most effectual retraction of our  
government to its original principles which ha*  
ever jet been sent by heaven to our a;J; every  
state in the Union should give a copy to evrry  
member they elect as a standing instruction, and  
ours should set the example.  
Accept the assurance of my affectionate and res­  
pectful attachment.
