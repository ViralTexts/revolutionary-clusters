ated to the Faculty of the Professors of the University, as the earnest request and recommendation of the Rector &amp; Visitors, that so far as can be effected by their exertions, they cause the statutes and rules enacted for the government of the University, to be exactly and strictly observed; that the roll of each school particularly, be punctually called at the hour at which it’s students should attend; that the absent and the tardy, without reasonable cause, be noted, and a copy of these notations be communicated by mail or otherwise to the parent or guardian of each Student respectively, on the first days of every month during the term, instead of the days prescribed in a former statute for such communications.—That it is requested of them to make known to the Students that it is with great regret that some breaches of order, committed by the unworthy few who lurk among them unknown, render necessary the extension to all, of processes afflicting to the feelings of those who are conscious of their own correctness, and who are above all participation in these vicious irregularities. while the offenders continue unknown, the tarnish of their faults spreads itself over the worthy also, and confounds all in a common censure. but that it is in their power to relieve themselves from the imputations and painful proceedings, to which they are thereby subjected, by lending their aid to the Faculty, on all occasions towards detecting the real guilty. the Visitors are aware that a prejudice prevails too extensively among the young, that it is dishonorable to bear witness one against another. while this prevails, and under the form of a matter of conscience, they have been unwilling to authorise constraint, and have therefore, in their regulations on this subject indulged the error, however unfounded in reason or morality. but this loose principle in the Ethics of schoolboy combinations, is unworthy of mature and regulated minds; and is accordingly condemned by the laws of their country, which, in offences, within their cognisance, compel those who have knolege of a fact, to declare it for the purposes of justice, and of the general good &amp; safety of society. and certainly, where wrong has been done, he who knows and conceals the doer of it, makes himself an Accomplice, and justly censurable as such. it becomes then but an act of justice to themselves, that the innocent and the worthy should throw off with disdain all communion of character, with such offenders,  should determine no longer to screen the irregular and the vicious under the respect of their cloak, and to notify them, even by a solemn association for the purpose, that they will cooperate with the Faculty in future, for the preservation of order, the vindication of their own character, and the reputation and usefulness of an Institution, which their country has so liberally established for their improvement, and to place within their reach those acquirements in knolege, on which their future happiness and fortunes depend. let the good and the virtuous of the Alumni of the University do this, and the disorderly will then be singled out for observation, and deterred by punishment, or disabled by expulsion, from infecting with their inconsideration the institution itself, and the sound mass of those which it is preparing for virtue and usefulness
