and a memorial to the people of British America, were agreed to be  
drawn. Mr. Lee, Mr. Henry, and others, were appointed for the  
first; Mr. Lee, Mr. Livingston, and Mr. Jay, for the two last.  
‘The splendor of their debut occasioned Mr. Henry to be designated

were charged ; and Mr. Lee was charged with the address to the  
people of England. The last was first reported. On reading it,

draft of a petition to the king was equally unsuccessful, and was re«

prepared by him, was adopted.”* Surely the failure of such men
