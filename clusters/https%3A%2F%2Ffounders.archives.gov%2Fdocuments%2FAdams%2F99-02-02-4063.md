ate, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
December 3d 1799.  
  
It is, with peculiar Satisfaction, that I meet the Sixth Congress, of the United States of America.——Coming from all parts of the Union, at this critical, and interesting period, the members must be fully possessed, of the Sentiments and wishes of our Constituents.  
The flattering prospects of abundance, from the labours of the people, by land and by sea; the prosperity of our extended commerce, notwithstanding interruptions occasioned by the belligerent State of a great part of the world; the return of health and industry and trade, to those cities, which have lately been afflicted with disease; and the various and inestimable advanges, civil and religious, which, secured under our happy frame of government, are *continued to us, unimpaired: demand of the whole American people, sincere thanks to a benevolent Deity, for the merciful dispensations of his Providence.  
But, while these numerous blessings are recollected, it is a painful duty to advert to the ungrateful return, which has been made for them, by some of the people, in certain counties of Pennsylvania, where, seduced by the arts and misrepresentations of designing men, they have openly resisted the law, directing the valuation of houses and lands. Such defiance was given to the Civil Authority as rendered hopeless, all further attempts, by judicial process, to enforce the execution of the law; and it became necessary to direct a military force to be employed, consisting of some companies of regular troops, volunteers, and militia, by whose zeal and Activity, in co-operation with the judicial power, Order and submission were restored, and many of the Offenders arrested.—Of these, some have been convicted of misdemeanors and others, charged with various crimes remain to be tried.  
To give due effect to the civil administration of government, and to ensure a just execution of the laws, a revision and amendment of the judiciary system is indispensably necessary. In this extensive country, it cannot but happen, that numerous questions respecting the interpretation of the laws and the rights and duties of Officers and citizens, must arise. On the one hand, the laws should be executed; on the other individuals should be guarded from Oppression: neither of these Objects is sufficiently assured, under the present organization of the judicial department. I therefore earnestly recommend the subject to your serious consideration.  
Persevereing in the pacific and humane policy, which had been invariably professed, and sincerely pursued by the executive Authority of the United States; when indications were made, on the part of the French Republic, of a disposition to accommodate the existing differences between the two Countries, I felt it to be my duty to prepare for meeting their advances, by a nomination of ministers upon certain conditions which the honor of our country dictated, and which its moderation had given it a right to prescribe. The Assurances which were required of the French Government, previous to the departure of our Envoys, have been given, through their minister of foreign relations; and I have directed them to proceed on their mission to Paris. They have full power to conclude a treaty, subject to the constitutional Advice and consent of the Senate. The characters of these Gentlemen, are sure pledges to their country, that nothing inconsistent incompatible with its honor or interest, nothing inconsistent with our obligations of good faith or friendship to any other nation, will be stipulated.  
It appearing probable, from the information I received, that our commercial intercourse, with some ports, in the Island of St. Domingo might safely be renewed, I took such steps as seemed to me expedient to ascertain that point. The result being satisfactory, I then, in conformity with the Act of Congress on the subject, directed the restraints and prohibitions of that intercourse to be discontinued, on terms which were made known by proclamation. Since the renewal of this intercourse, our citizens trading to those ports, with their property have been duely respected and privateering from those ports has ceased.  
In examing the claims of British Subjects by the commissioners at Phyladelphia, acting under the sixth Article of the treaty of Amity, commerce and navigation, with Great Britain, a difference of Opinion, on points deemed essential, in the interpretation of that Article has arisen between the commissioners appointed by the United States, and the other members of that board, from which the former have thought it, their duty to withdraw....It is sincerely to be regretted, that the execution of an article produced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice, should have been thus unavoidably interrupted. It is, however, confidently expected, that the same spirit of amity and the same sense of justice in which it originated, will lead to satisfactory explanations. In consequence of the Obstacles to the progress of the commission in Phyladelphia, his Britannic Majesty has directed the commissioners appointed by him, under the seventh Article of the treaty, relating to British captures of American vessels, to withdraw from the board sitting in London: but with the express declaration of his determination to fullfill with punctuality and good faith, the engagements, which his Majesty has contracted by his treaty with the United States; and that they will be instructed to resume their functions, whenever the Obstacles, which impede the progress of the commission at Phyladelphia, shall be removed. It being in like manner, my sincere determination, so far as the same depends on me, that with equal punctuality and good faith, the engagements contracted by the United States, in their treaties with his Britannic Majesty, shall be fullfilled, I shall, immediately instruct our minister at London to endeavour to obtain the explanations necessary to a just performance of those engagements, on the part of the United States. With such dispositions on both sides, I cannot entertain a doubt, that all difficulties will soon be removed, and that the two boards will then proceed and bring the business committed to them respectively, to a satisfactory conclusion.  
The Act of Congress, relative to the Seat of the Government of the United States, requiring that on the first Monday of December next, it should be transferred from Phyladelphia, to the district chosen for its permanent Seat, it is proper for me to inform you, that the commissioners appointed to provide suitable Buildings for the accommodation of Congress, and of the President, and of the public offices of the Government, have made a report of the State of the Buildings designed for those purposes in the city of Washington; from which they conclude that the removal of the Seat of Government to that place, at the time required, will be practicable and the accommodation, satisfactory. Their report will be laid before you.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
I shall direct the estimates of the Appropriations necessary for the Service of the ensuing year, together with an account of the revenue and expenditure, to be laid before you. During a period, in which, a great portion of the civilized world, has been involved in a War, unusually calamitous and destructive, it was not to be expected, that the United States could be exempted from extraordinary burthens. Although the period is not arrived, when the measures adopted, to secure our country against foreign attacks can be renounced, yet it is alike necessary for the honor of the Government, and the satisfaction of the community, that an exact Œconomy should be maintained. I invite you, Gentlemen, to investigate the different branches of the public expenditure: the examination will lead to beneficial retrenchments; or produce a conviction of the Wisdom of the measures, to which the expenditure relates.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
At a period like the present, when momentous changes are occurring, and every hour is preparing new and great events in the political World; when a Spirit of War is prevalent in almost every nation with whose Affairs, the interests of the United States have any connection; unsafe and precarious would be our Situation, were we to neglect the means of maintaining, our just rights. The result of the mission to France in uncertain: but however it may terminate, a steady perseverance in a system of national defence, commensurate with our resources, and the situation of our Country, is an obvious dictate of Wisdom. For, remotely as we are placed from the belligerent nations, and desirous as we are by doing justice to all, to avoid Offence to any,; nothing short of the power of repelling aggressions, will secure to our country a rational prospect of escaping the calamities of War, or national degradation....As to myself, it is my anxious desire, so to execute the trust reposed in me, as to render the people of the United States, prosperous and happy. I rely, with entire confidence, on your co operation in Objects equally your care; and that our mutual labours will serve to increase and confirm Union among our fellow Citizens and an unshaken Attachment to our Government

It is with peculiar fatisfadion,  
that I meet the Sixth Corgrefs of the United  
Ststej of America.—Coming from all partfof  
ihe Union at this critical and interfiling period,

the labor* of the people, by land and by fei } the  
profperity of out cxended commerce, nojwiih.  
Handing interruptions, ocralioned by the bellig.  
erent ftate of a gieit part of the world—the  
return of hea’th, hduftry and trade, to thofe  
cine* which have latelybeen affli^lcdwith difeafe ;  
and the various and inellimable advantages,civil  
and religious, which, fecured under our happy  
frame ot government, are continue^ to us un­  
impaired, demand of the whole American  
people fincere thank* to a benevolent De ty for  
the m-rciful difpenlatioa* of hi* pi evidence.  
  
mu wiuie tune numerous bicumgs are recollect­  
ed, it is a painful duty to advert to the ungrate  
ful return whxh has been made for them by  
fome of the peaple in certain counties of Penn­  
fylvani* ; v here, feduced by the arts and ir.if  
reprefenutinns of defigtvng men, they have  
openly refilled the law directing iff valuation  
oi houlcs and land*. Such defiance was given  
to the civil authority as rendered hopelefs all  
fmther attempts, by juJicial procefs, to enforce  
the execution of the law, and it became necefftry  
to direct a military force to be employed, con­  
fiftng t f f arc companies of regular troops,  
volunteers, and militia, by whofc zeal 81 activity  
in co operation with the judicial power, order  
and fabmiffion were refto^cd, and mar.y of the  
fff-nders arnfled. Of thefe fome have been  
enrvifled of miflemeaoors, and achcrs, charged  
with variovs crimes, remain to be tiicJ.  
to give due to the civil adminiftration  
of government, and to enfure&#x27;a juft execution  
of the laws, a revjfion and amendment of the  
judiciary fyfieiy*. is iad*fpcnfitb!y receffary. In  
ilus extcnfive tontry it cannot hut happen, that  
numerous queflionx refpefting the interpretation

and citizens,m&#x27;Jft arife. On the one hind, the  
the laws flionld Ik* executed—otl the other,  
individuals IKoulJ be guarded f.om c-preffon.  
Neither of thefe objeCls is fufficiently alfued  
under the prefent organization of the Judicial  
department: I therefore carncdly lecosnm-.nJ  
the fuhjefl to your f.rions confider.ition.  
Petfevtriag in the pacific and humane policy,  
which has been invari ifijy nrofefTed. and (luceie­  
lv pu1 fued, by the executive siuthority of the  
United States, when indications were ma le on  
the part of the French Republic, of a dif^o  
fitian to accommodate the exifting differences  
between the two countries, 1 felt it to be my  
  
uui) 10 prepare tor muring tneir auva*ces tty a  
nomination of minifters upon certain conditions,  
which the honour of our country dictated, and  
which it* modera&#x27;ion had given it&quot;a right to  
prcfdribe. The affiirances, which were jequir­  
4pbf the Fiench* government previous to the  
wparture of our Envoys, have been given,  
through their Minifler of Foreign relations; and  
I h ivc dire^ed them to proceed on their mifllon  
to Paris. They have full power to conclude a  
treity, filbjeft to the Conflitutional advice and  
confiy.C of the Senate. The characters of thefe  
Gentlemen are fare pledges to their Country,  
tbit nothing incompatible with its honor or in­  
terefl, nothing inconlillent wi&#x27;h our obligations  
of good faith or fricndlhip to anjr oilier nation,  
will b: flipulated.  
It appearing probable, from the information  
I received, that our commercial intercom fe with  
fume ports in the-ifland of St. Domingo might  
fafely be renewed, 1 t-ok fuch tteps as feemed  
to me expedient, to afeertain that point. The  
refuh being farisfaflory, I then, in conformity  
With the act of Congrefs on the fu&#x27;ijeft, directed  
tltvreflraints and prohibitions of tha^inieicourfc  
to be difc*ntinued, on terms, which were made  
known by proclamation. Since the Renewal of  
this intefcourfe, our citizens, trading-to thofe  
ports, with their property, have been duly fef­  
pefled, and privataering from thofe ports bns  
ccafcd.  
In e.rationing the claims of Britifh fdbje&amp;sby  
the cortimilfioners at Philadelphia, under the  
fixth article of the treaty of amity, commerce  
and navigation, with Great-Britain, adfference  
of opinion, on points deemed clfeatial in the  
interpretation of that article, has arifjn between  
the comtniflioncrs appointed hv the United  
States and the other &lt; iftembers of that boarJ,  
from Which the former have thought it theii  
duty to withdfitv.&#x27;.-r-Jt is iiucftety to be regret­  
I  
t &#x27; ’  
  
ted, that the execution of an article, produced  
; by a mutual fpirit of amity and juftiee fh u!d  
have been tints Unavoidably interrupted. It is,  
however,&#x27;’&#x27;confidently expected, that the fame  
fp;rit of anvty and the ftme fenfe of juft ce, in  
which it oiigintted, will lead to (ati&gt;f,ti51ory  
explanations. Inconsequence of theobftaclet  
to the progref, of the commiffion in Philadel­  
phia. his Britannic Majefly has directed the  
commifitn»er», appointed by him, under rfi,  
fe tenth article of the trea^r, relating to Bciifh  
captures of American vefiek to withdraw from  
the board fitting in London, but with- the ex­  
prefs declaration of his determination to Juifil,  
with punctuality, and good fa ih, the engage  
menrs which hi. M jefty has conlrafltd by his  
treaty with the United S:ates.% and that -licv  
wiil be inflrnfled to reftiine their furi£Uons*  
whenever the obflac’es which impede the pro  
grefr of the commiffion at Philadelphia, Ih ill  
be removed. It being in like manner my fin­  
cere deter minarioo, fo far as the fame depends  
on me, that with equal pundnality and good  
faith, the engagements contractd by the Uni­  
ted States in their treaties with his Britannic  
Majefly fliall be fulfilled, I Ihall immediately  
inllruft cur nvnifter at l-cndon, to endeavour  
t* obtain the explanations flee ffiry, to a juft  
performance of ih fe engagements on the part  
of the .United States. F  
With fuch difpofitions on both Seles, t can­  
not entertain a doubt that all difficulties r ift  
foon be removed, and th it the two Board- will  
then proceed and bring tLe bufmefs comm t ed  
to them, refpeaively, to a fatisfaftory conclu­  
fion.

proper For tre to inform you, that the commif­

city of Walhirgton, from which they couciude,  
that the removal of the feat of government tA  
that place, at the time required, will be prac­  
ticable, and the accommodations fati factory.  
Their report will Uc laid before you.  
Gentlemen of the llonft of Rtprrfentativet,  
I fiiall direfl the eftinrates of the appropri­  
ations, necelfary for the fervice of the enfuing  
year, together wi:h &lt;&#x27;i account of the revenue  
and expenditure, to he laid before you During  
a period in which a great portion of the c;v:liz­  
cd •* or Id has been involved in a war, unufually  
calamitous and deftruftive, it was not to be  
expefled, that the United Slates could he ex­  
empted from extraordinary burthen*. Alt bo’  
the period is not arrived, whea the me .fores  
atP&#x27;picd to fecure rur countiy agai ft for% ;a  
attack can be renounced, yet it is alikr ne^eli-ry  
to the honor of the govenment, and the fufi­  
faflion of the community, that an exafl econo­  
my fhould be maintained. I invite you. Gen­  
tlemen, l inrefligate the different branches c.f  
the public expenditure, The examination will  
lead to beneficial retrenchment , or produce a  
cnnviflhn of the wifdora of the meil&#x27;ure to  
which the expenditure relates.  
  
istntlemen oj Ibe Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the Houf of R ep ref-ntat I vet,  
At a period, like the prefent, when momen­  
tous chang*s arc occuriog, and every lionr if  
preparing new and great even&#x27;s in the political  
watld—when a fpjrit of war is preva ent in  
almoft every nation, wi.h winds affairs th®  
intereli of the United Sia&#x27;es have any con eft­  
ion, unfafe and precarious would be our fmu.  
tion, were weto-neglefl the means of maintain­  
irig our juft rights The reft.lt ®f the million  
to France is uncertain ; hut however it may  
terminate, a fteady perfeverence in a fyftem of  
national defence, commenfuratc with our refour­  
ces and the liustion of our country, is an  
obvious diflate of wifdom. For lerr.otely as we  
are placed from the belligerent nations, and  
defirous as we are, by doing juflice to vll, to  
avoid offence to any, nothing fh.irt of the power  
of repelling aggrelli &gt;ns will fecure to our  
country, a rational profpefl of efcapiog the  
calamities of war, or national degradation._  
As to nrtyfelf, it is my anxious defire, ft. to e*e­  
cute the truft repofed in me, ■»« to render tire  
people cf the United States profperous and  
happy. I rely, with intire confidence, on your  
co operation, in objefh equally your care, and  
that our mutual labours will fcrve to encreafe  
and cbnfirm union among our fellow citizens,  
and an unfhaken attachment to our government­

Gentleinen of the Sejiate and  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
It is with pecu.liar fatisfa&amp;ion  
that I meet the Sixth Congnrfs of  
&quot; - t- :W  
the United States of America.  
Coming from all parts of the Union,  
at this critical and j interellihg pe  
riod, the members mu ft be iullv  
DOlTeffcd of tHe fenttmer.ts and  
wifhesof our conftituents. L  
&#x27; u -  
The flattering profpels of abun  
dance from the labors of the people,  
by land and by feathe profperity  
of our extended commerce, not-  
withitanding jnterruptions 1 occa-  
uonea Dy tne Deiugescnt itace 01 a  
great part of tlie world the return  
of; health, mduitryy and trade, to  
thofe cities which have lately been  
afBicted &#x27;with difeafc; and the va­  
rious and ineflimable advantages,  
civil and religious, which, fecured  
under our happy frame of Govern  
ment, are continued to us unim  
paired&quot;, demand off the whole Ame  
rican people fincere thanks to a bc-  
nev.olent Deity, for the merciful  
difpenfations of this Providence,  
But while thefe numerous bleffings  
are recollecied, it is painful to ad  
vert to the ungrateful return which  
has been; &#x27;madc for them by fome  
of the people in certain counties of  
rcnnlylyania ; where, leduced by  
the arts and mifreprefentitions of  
dchgnmg men, they- have openly  
reliited the law directing the valu  
ation, of houfes and. lands. Such  
defiance was given; to the civil au  
thority as rendered; ho pel els all fur  
ther attempts by judicial procefs, to  
enforce the execution of the laws,  
1 . I&#x27; &#x27;rr 1 cS  
ana 11 Decame necenarv to airea a  
military force to be employed, con  
lifting of fome companies of regular  
troops, volunteers; and militia, by  
whole xeal and aStivity incd-ope-ration,  
with- the? judicial power,  
order and fubmifJSph were refiored,  
and many of the offenders arretted  
Of thefe fome have been convifted  
of mildemeanors, and others charged  
with Various crimes remain to be  
tried. .  
. 6 QUC enect to tne civil aa­  
raiYiiflration of Government, and  
to infure a jufl execution of the  
laws, a revilion and amendment of  
the judiciary fyftem, is indifpen­  
lably neceflary. In this ex ten five  
country it cannot but happen, that  
numerous queftions refpefting the  
interpretation of &#x27; the laws and the  
rights and duties of officers and ci­  
tizens mull arife On the one  
hand, the 4aws fhould be executed ;  
on the other, individuals fhould be  
guarded irom oppteilion. Neither  
of thefe objefts is iiiniciently allured  
under the prefent organization of  
the judicial department. 1 I there­  
fore ekrneftly recommend the fub-  
rerfevering irs the pacific and hu­  
mane oolicv. which had been in  
variably profefIed,and fi ncerely pu r-  
j fued, by the Executive Authority  
cf the United States when indi-  
cations were made on the part of  
the f rench Republic ot a dilpo­  
fition to accommodate the exifttng  
differences between the two coun­  
tries, I felt it to be my: duty to pre­  
pare for meeting; their advances by  
a nomination of ji Miniftcrs upon  
certain, conditions, which the&#x27;ho-  
nor of our country dictated, and  
which its moderation, had given  
it a right to prefcribe. ! The af-  
fu ranees whicli Were required of the  
r rench Lrovcrnment, previous j to  
the departure of our En voys, have  
been given through their Minifter  
ot roreign, Relations : and I have  
directed them to proceed on their  
million to &#x27;faris: A hey nave full  
po wef to conclude treaty, fubjeft  
to thereon; flitutioijU adviceand con­  
sent of the Senate The characters  
of the gentlemen are furej pledges  
cpmpatibla3 with, its I hbnor oi in  
tcreft, nothing Jiconfiftcat itn  
  
ur bbKgitions of ,geod rfiU f;J  
friendfliip to any other nation will  
be ftipulated. ; &quot; .  
  
It appearing probable From the  
information I received, triat, our  
commercial jntercouTle with tome  
ports in the iflandof St. Domingo  
might fafely be renewed, I took  
fuch fteps as feemed tome expedient  
to afcertain that point. The relult  
being fatisfaftory, I then art con-  
foimity with the attot Mongrels on  
tkfubiea, daeaed the  
reitraints  
prohibitions of that interc&#x27;our.&#x27;e  
W brdifcontinuea, on terms which&#x27;  
were made known by proclamation.  
Since the renewal of1 this lnter-  
courfe, our citizens trading to thofe  
ports,with their property, have been  
duly refpefted, and privateering  
from thole ports has cealed.  
In examining the claims of Britiih  
fubje&amp;s by the Commiuioners at  
Philadelphia, under the hxth arti  
cle of the treaty pf, amity, com­  
merce and navigation, with Great-  
Britain, a difference ot opinion on  
points deemed efTential in the inter  
pretation of that article has afifen  
between the Commiuioners . ap­  
Doitited &#x27; bv the United States and  
the Otheir members of that board  
from whjch the former have tho&#x27;t  
it their duty to witnaraw. it is  
fincerelv to be regretted, that the  
execution of an article, produced  
by a, mutual fpirit of amity and juf-  
tice, fhould have been thus unavpi-  
dably interrupted. It is, however  
confidently expected, that the iamt  
fpirit of amity, and the fam,e fenfe  
of juitice, m wn?ch it originated,  
will lead to fatisfactory explanati  
ons. In coniequence oi tne ootta  
cles to the progrefs of the commif-  
fion in Philadelphia, his Britannic  
Majefty has directed the commiifion  
appointed by him, under the ie  
venth article of the treary, relating  
to Britifh captures of American  
vefTels, to withdraw from the board  
fitting in London, but with the  
exprels declaration of his determi  
nation to fulfil, with punctuality  
and good7 faith, the engagements  
which his Majefty has contra&amp;ed  
oy his treaty with the United  
States, and that they will be in  
ftrucled to rcfume their functions,  
whenever the obltacls which im  
pedetlie progrefs of the commi (Bon­  
ers at Philadelphia fhall be removed.  
It beinq in like manner, my fincere  
determination, fo far as the fame  
depends on me, that with equal  
punctuality and good faith, the en  
gagements con t ratted by the United  
btates, in their treaties with his  
Britannic Maieftv. (hall be fulfil-  
ed, I Ihall immediately inftrucl;  
our minuter at London, to endea  
vour to obtain the explanations ne  
iiary, to a -juft performance of  
thofe engagements on the part of  
the United States. With fuch dif-  
pontions on both iides, I cannot  
entertain a dbubt, that alt&quot; difficul  
ies will foon-be removed, and that  
the two boards will then proceedj  
and brine the bufinefs, committed  
to them, relpe&amp;ively, to a fatisfac  
tory conclusion, j

delphia to the Diitrict chofen for  
its permanent feat, it is proper for  
me to inform &#x27;you, that the Com  
miffioners,&quot; appointed to - provide  
luitable buildings lor the accomoda  
tion of Congrefs; and the Prefi  
dent, and for the public offices of  
the Government, have made a re  
port of the icate of the building&#x27;s  
defip-ned for thefe puroofes in the  
Uity or Waihingtmi, from which  
1 I . T  
they Conclude, that the removal of  
the feat of government at the time  
required, Will be practicable, and  
the accommodation latisfactory.  
Their Report will be laid before  
you.  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentative$t  
- I fhall direct the eftimates of the  
appropriations necefiary for the fer  
vices of the enfuing yeaVj toether  
with an account of the revenue arid  
expenditure, to be laid before ycu.  
During a period, in which a great  
portion- of the civilized wot Id has  
.been involved in a war, unufuallv  
calamitous and deftructiye, it was  
not to be expected that the United  
states could be exempted fr9m ex  
traordinary burthens. Although  
the period is not arrived, .when the  
r ! &#x27; . 1.

te renounced, yet it is alike necef

ment, and the fatisfaction of the  
community, that anexact CEcOro-  
my fhould be maintained.

Gentlomen of the Senate, and g  
Gentiemen of the ilouf= of Representatives,  
FT is with peculiar futisfaction, that  
I meet the fisth Congrels of the Uni­  
ted Stites of America.—Coming from  
all paris of the Union at this &quot; eritical  
and interelting period, the Members  
mult be fully voffeffed of the senti­  
ments and wishes of our constituents.  
The flattering profpe®s of abund­  
ance from the labours of the people,  
by land and by {ea ; the prosperity  
of our extended comnierce, motwith­  
ftanding interruptions, occasioned by  
the bellicerent (tate of a great part of  
the worid—the return of health, ‘m­  
duftry aund trade to those cities which  
have lately been affiited with disease,  
and the various and inetimable ad­  
vantages, civil and religious, which,  
secured under our happy frame of  
government, are continued unimpai:-  
cd, demand of the whole American  
people sincere thanks to a benevolent  
Deity for the merciful dispensations of  
his providence. But while these nu­  
“merous bleflings are recolle&amp;ed, it is  
a painful duty to advert to the un­  
grateful return which has been made  
for them by some of the peoplein  
certain counties of Pennsylvania, where,  
seduced by the arts and misrepresenta­  
tions of designing men, they have  
openly resisted the law direding the  
valuation of houses and lands. Such  
defiance was given to the civil authori­  
ty as rendered hopeless all further at­  
tempts, by judicial process, to enforce  
the execution of the law, and it became  
neceflary to diret a military force to be  
employed, confilting of some compa­  
nies of regular troops, volunteers and  
‘militia, by whose zeal and a&amp;ivity,in  
¢o-operation with the judicial power,  
order and submission were reflored,  
and many of the offenders arrelted.  
Of these fome.have been convicted of  
misdemeanors, and others; charged  
with various crimes, remain to be  
tried. © % 1  
  
To give due effed to the civil ad­  
ministration of government, and to  
ensure a just execution of the laws, a  
revision and amendment of the judi­  
_ ciary fy@tem-is indi{penfibly necef}ary.  
In this extensive country. it. cannot  
but happen, that numerous queltions  
refpefting the interpretation of the  
laws; and the rights and duties of  
officers and citizens, must arise. On  
the one hand, the laws should be ex­  
ecuted—on the other, individuals  
should be guarded from oppreflion.  
Neither of these objeds is fufficiently  
assured under the present organiza­  
tion of the Judicial department : I  
therefore, earnestly recommend the  
subject to your serious consideration.  
Persevering in the pacific and bhuman:  
policy, which has. been - invariably: pro-  
Jefleds and sincerely purfacdy by the exe-’  
cutive authority . of the United States,  
awhen indications were made on the part  
of the French Republic, of a disposition  
2o accommodate the ex’g&#x27;ﬂiu; differences  
betwseen the two countries, 1 felt it to be  
my duty so prepare for meeting their ad­  
sancer by a somination of &lt;Miniflers up­  
ol cortain coysiisons, which the honor of  
sur couptiv digtaicd, and awhich its mod­  
eration pad sived it a right to prefribe.  
Dbe affiuramecs, whicke were reqaired of  
gpe French Government, previcus to the,  
_ depayture of our Envoys, bave been. giv­  
“en, thraugh Yheir. Mingfler; of Far;;&#x27;gn‘

.1t appeared probable, from the in­  
- formation I received, that our com­  
* mnercial intercourse &#x27; with some ports  
in the island of St. Domingo might

fadelphiay sader the Rwth article of­  
the treaty of amity, commerce and  
navigation, with Grcat’,Aßr,itaix}&amp;‘a‘jdif­  
ference of cpinion, on points decmed  
‘effed¥ial in the iaterpretation of that  
article, ﬁz« arisen ‘between the com-.  
‘miflioners appointed by the U. States:  
and the other members of that board,  
from which the former Lave thought  
it their duty to withdraw. It is sin­  
cerely to be regretrad, that theexecu­  
tion of an artigc, produced by a mu­  
tnal {pirit of amity ani ju!}?e {hould  
‘have been thus unavoidably inter­  
tupted. Itis, however, confidently  
expected, that the fame spirit of ami­  
ty, and the fame sense of jultice, in  
‘which it originated, will lead to fatis­  
factory explanations. In coniequence  
of the obstacles to thé¢ progress of the

tannick Majelty has direGed the com­

they will be inftruéed to resume their  
funé&amp;ions, whenever the %bftacles  
which impede the progress of the  
commiflion at Philadelphia, shall be

the {fame depends on me, that with  
equal punétuality and good faith, the  
engagements contracted by the United

part of the United States.  
With such dispositions on both sides,  
I cannot estertain a donbt that all dif­

that the two boards will then proceed

the state of the buildings, designed for  
those purposes in the city of Washing­  
ton, from which they conclude, that  
the removal of the feat of government  
to that place, at the time required, will  
be praicable, and the accommboda­

be laid before you. G  
Gentlemen of the Houfz of Representatives,  
I {hall direct the estimates of the  
appropriations, néceflary for the ser­  
vice of the ensuing year, together with  
~an account of the revenueand expen­  
diture, to be laid before you. During  
a period in which a great portion of  
the civilized world has been involved  
in a war, unusually . calamitous and  
deftruive, it was not to be expedted,  
that the United States could be ex­  
empted’ from extraordinary burthens.  
Although the period is not. arrived,  
when the measures adopted to secure  
our country against foreign attack can  
be renounced, yet it is alike neceflary  
to the honor of the government, and

Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen ot the Houfe of l\e;&gt;n;ientativej,  
  
IT is with peculiar fatufa£tion, that I  
meet the fixtli congrels of the United  
States of America. Coining f^om all parts  
or the Union, at this critical, and inter,  
efting period, the members muft be fully  
poffelfi.-d, of the fentimeiits and wilhes of  
our conftituents.  
  
The flattering profpe6\s of abundance  
from the labors of the people, by land and  
by fea ; the prosperity of our extended  
commerce, notwithstanding interruptions  
occafioned by the beligerent ftate of a.  
great part of the world ; the return of  
health, induftrv and trade- to thefe cities,  
which have lately been atii&amp;ed with dif-  
eafc ; and the various at&gt;d ine ti-nabie ad-  
vantages civil and religious, which fecu-  
red under our happy frame of government,  
are continued to u = . utumpared j demand  
of the whole AmeHcatl people, lir.cere  
thanks to a b#nevplcnt deity, for the mer-  
ciful difpenfations of hit providence. -  
  
But, while thefe numerous blellings  
are recolledled, it is a painful duty to -  
vert to the ungrateful return which jitts  
been made for them, by fome of the peo-  
ple, in certain cour.ti.s of Pennfylvania,  
where feduced by the arts and miirepre-  
fcntaLions of defigning men, they have o-  
penly refifted the law, directing the valu-  
ation of houfes and lands. Such defiance  
was given to the civil authority as render-  
ed hopelcfs, all further attempts, bv ju-  
dicial procel&#x27;s, to enforce the execut&#x27;on  
of the law ; and it became neceffary to  
direct a military force to be employed,  
confilling of fome companies of regvdar. .  
troops volunteers, and militia, by vt jjjffi  
zeal and activity, in co-operation of th&lt;? *i  
judicial power, order and fubmiffion were  
•eftored, and many of the offenders ar-s  
reftedi. Of thefe fome have been con\ic-  
ted of tnifdemeanors, and others ch; rge L  
Ith various crimes remain to be tried.  
To give due effect to the civil adtni-  
niftration of government, and to infnre a  
ufl execution of the laws, a reviGon and  
amendment of the judiciary fyftem, is  
indifpenfably neceffary. In this exten-  
five country, it cannot but happen. iliaC  
uurue- roU 3 c^uclUon* rcfpetliiij the inter-  
  
pretations of the Iawsflf-d the rights and  
duties of officers and citizens muft arife,  
On the one hand, the la\*s fliould be cxe-  
•&#x27;cuted ; on the other, individuals fliould  
he guarded from oppreilion : Neither of  
thefe objects is fufficientiy aifuied, under  
the prefent organization of the judicial  
department, I therefore earnellly recom-  
mend the fubject to your ferious conlide-  
ration.  
  
Perfcvering in the pacific and humane  
policy which had been invariably profeff-  
ed and fincerely purfued l&gt;y the executive  
authority of the United States ; when  
indications were made, on the part of  
the French republic, of a dil&#x27;pofition to  
accommodate the exifting differences be-  
tween the two countries ; I felt it to b  
mv duty to prepare for meeting tl.ei  
advance&#x27;s by a nomination of minitters,  
upon certain conditions, which the honor  
of our country dictated, to prefcribe.  
The affurances which were required ot  
the French government, previous to the  
departure of our envoys, have been given  
thro their minilter of foreign relations ;  
and I have directed them to proceed on  
their million to Paris. They have fuli  
power to conclude a treaty, fubjeCt to the  
conftitutional advice and content of the  
fenate. The characters of thefegentlemen  
are fure pledges to their country, that  
nothing incompatible with its honor or  
intcreft, nothing inconliftent with its ob-  
ligations of good faith or friendlhip to any  
other nation will be ltipulaled.  
  
It appearing, probable, from the infor-  
mation I received that our commercial  
intcrcourfe, with fome ports, in theifland  
of St. Domingo, might i&#x27;afely be renew  
ed, I took fuch ftepa as feemed to me ex-  
pedient to afce- ain that point. The re-  
fult being fatis factory, 1 then in confor  
mity with the act of congrefs on the fub  
ject directed tiie restraints and prohibiti-  
ons of that intercourfe to be difcontinuec  
on terms which were made known by pro  
clamatioM. Since the renewal of this in-  
tercourfe our citizens trading to thou,  
ports, with their property have been du!  
refpected, and privateering from thof,  
ports has ceaf&#x27;d.  
  
In examining the claims of Britifh fub  
jectsby the commiflioners at Philadelphia,  
under the fixth article of the treaty o  
amity, commerce and navigation, wit!  
Great Britain, a difference of opinion, o:  
points deemed effential i,i the interpreta  
tion of that article, has arilen betweei  
the commiflioners appointed by the Uni  
ted States and the other members of tha;  
board, from which the former hav.  
thought it their duty to withdraw. It is  
fincerely to be regretted, that the execu  
tion, of an article, produced by a mutus  
fpirit of amity and juftice, fliould hav  
brcn thus unavoidably interrupted. It h  
however, confidently expected, that th  
fame Spirit o r amity and the fame fenfe o  
jultice, in which it originated, will lead t.  
fatisfaetory explanations. Inconfequeno  
of the obftachs to the progrefi of th.  
commiffion in Philadelphia, his Briannb  
majefty has directed the commiflioners  
appointed by him, under the feventh ar-  
ticle of the treaty, relating to Britiih cap  
tures of American vcffels, to withdraw  
from the board fitting in London, but  
with the exprefs declaration of his deter-  
mination to fulfil, with punctuality, and  
good faith, the engagement which his  
niajeftv has contracted by his treaty with  
the United States, and that they will  
be imtructed to refume their functions,  
whenever the obiLcles which impede  
the progrefs of the commiffion, at Phila-  
delphia, tha 11 be removed. It being in  
like manner my fincere determination fo  
far as the fame depends on me, that with  
equal punctuality and good faith, the en-  
gagements contra-ted by the United  
States in their treaties with his Britan-  
nic majefty, fliall be fulfilled, I fhall im-  
m -diaiely inltruct our minilter at London  
to endeavor to obtain ths explanations  
neceffary, to a juft performance of thofe  
engagements on the part of the United  
States. With fuch difpofitiona on both  
fides, I cannot entertain a doubt, that all  
difficulties will foon be removed, and that  
the two boards will then proceed and  
bring the bufineis, committed to them,  
refpectively, to a fatisfactory concluiion.  
  
The aft of congrefs, relative to the feat  
of government of the United States, re-  
quiring that on the firft Monday of De-  
cember next, it fliould be transferred  
from Philadelphia, to the diitrict, chofen  
for its permanent feat, it is proper for me  
to inform you that the commiffioners, ap-  
pointed to provide fui table buildings for  
the accommodation of congrefs, and the  
• president, and for the public offices, of go-  
vernment, have made a report of the ftate  
of the buildings, dofigned for thefe pur-  
poses in the city of Washington, from  
\vh : ch they conclude, that the removal of  
the feat of government to that place at  
the time, required will be practicable, and  
the accommodations famfactorv. Their  
report will be laid before you.  
  
Gentlemen of t&#x27;ne Hoiife of Rcprcfentativcr,  
I fliall direct the climates of the ap-  
propriations, ncCeffary for the fervice of  
the enfuing year, together with an ac-  
count of the revenue and expenditure to  
be laid before you. During a period in  
which a great portion of the civilized  
world has been involved in a war, ufual-  
ly calamitous and deftructive, it was not  
to be expected that the United States  
could be exempted from extraordinary  
burthens. Although the period is not ar-  
rived, when the mtafures adopted to le-  
cureour country againft foreign attack can  
be renounced, yet it is alike neceffary to  
the honor of the government, &amp; the fatif-  
faCtion of the community, that an exact  
ceconomy fliould be maintained. I invite  
you gentlemen, to invefligate the different  
branches of the public expenditue. The  
examination will lead to beneficial re-  
trenchments, or produce a conviction of  
ihe wifdom of the meafure to which the  
expenditure relates.  
  
Ontlemen of the Senate, and  
  
Gentle-nsn of the Hiute of Reprelcntatives;  
At a period like the prefent, when  
mome:.t us changes are occurring, and  
every hour is preparing new great c-  
vents in the political — when a  
  
fpirit of war is prev;dent«rwa ; M:oft every  
nation, with whole affairs the int refl &lt; ; :  
the United States have any connection,  
unfafeSc precarious wou&#x27;d be our iituation,  
were we to neglect the means of main-  
taining our juft rights. The refult of the  
million to France is uncertain ; but how- j  
eveVk may terminatej(p|eady pevfettrer-  
arce in a lyflem of national defence, com-  
menfurate with our refources and the fi-  
xation of our country, is an obvious dic-  
tate of wifdom. For remotely as we arc  
olaccd from the belligerent nations, and  
lefirous as we are, by doing juitice to all.  
&#x27;o avoid offence to any, nothing fiiort of  
.he power of repelling aggreflions, wil  
ecure to our country, a rational rrofpe /  
&gt;f efcaping the calamatics of war, or na  
ional degradation. As to myfelf, it is  
ay anxious delire, fo to execute the trul  
epofed in me, as to render the av&gt;pl  
ftheUnitedStates profperous and ijapjv  
! rely, with entire confidence, ortyafceo-

Genthmen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the Eoufe of R-prefentatives,  
  
Ir is with peculiar fatisfaction,  
that I meet the fixth Congrefs  
of the United States of America.  
Coming from all parts of the  
Union, at this critical and inter-  
efting period, the Members muft  
be fully poffefled of the fenti-  
ments and wifhes of our contftit-  
uents. !  
  
The flattering profpetts of  
abundance from the labours of  
the people, by land and by fea ;  
the profperity of our extended  
commerce, notwithftanding in-  
terruptions, occafioned by the  
belligerent {tate of a great part  
of the world—the return of  
health, induftry, and trade to  
thofe cities which have lately  
been afflicted with difeafe, and  
the various ineftimable advan-  
tages, civil and religious, which,  
fecured under our happy frame  
ef government, are continued to  
us unimpaired, demand of the  
whole American people fincere  
thanks to a benevolent Deity,  
for the merciful difpenfations of  
his providence. But while thefe  
humerous bleflings are recollect-  
ed, it is a painful duty to advert  
te the ungrateful return which  
  
has been made for them by fome  
of the people in certain counties  
of Pennfylvania ; where, feduced  
by the arts and mifreprefenta-  
tions of defigning men, they have  
openly refifted the law direéting  
the valuations of houfes and  
lands. Such defiance was giv-  
en to the civil authority, as ren-  
dered hopelefs all further at-  
tempts, by judicial procefs, to en-  
force the execution of the law,  
and it became neceflary to direé  
a military force to be employed,  
confi{ting of fome companies of  
regular troops, volunteers and

To give due effect to the civ-

laws fhould be executed ; on the  
ether, individuals fhould be  
guarded from oppreflion. Neither  
of thefe objects is fufficiently af-  
fured under the prefent organ-  
ization of the judicial depart-  
ment: I therefore carneftly rec-  
ommend the fubje&amp; to your fe-  
tious confideration. }  
Perfevering in the pacific and  
humane policy, which has been  
invariably profefled, and fincerely  
purfued, by the executive author-  
ity of the United States, when  
indications were made on the  
part of the French Republic, of  
a difpofition to accommodate the  
exifting differences between the  
two countries, i felt it to be my  
duty to prepate tor meeting their  
advances by a nomination of  
Minifters upon certain condi-  
tions, which the honour of our  
country dictated, and which its  
moderation had given it a right  
to prefcribe. ‘The affurances,  
which were required of the  
French Government, previous to  
the departure of our Envoys,  
have been given, through their  
Minifter of Foreizn Relations ;  
and I have directed them to pro-  
ceed on their mifon to Paris.  
“They have full power to con-  
clude a Treaty, fubject to the  
Conftitutional advice and confent  
of the Senate. The characters of  
thefe gentlemen are fure pledges  
to their country, that nothing in-  
compatiblé with its honour or in-  
tereft, nothing inconfiltent with  
our obligations of good faith or  
friendfhip to any other nation,  
  
will be ftipulated.  
  
It appearing probable, from the  
information I received, that our  
commercial intercourfe with fome  
ports in the ifland of St. Domin.  
go might fately be retlewed, I  
took fuch fteps, as feemed to me  
expedient, to afcertain that point.  
The refult being. fatisfactory,, I  
then, in conformity with the a&amp;  
of Congrefs on the fubjéét, di-  
rected the reftraints and prohibi-  
tions of that intercourfe to be  
difcontinued, on terms, which  
wete made known by proclama-  
tion. Since the renewal of this  
intercourfe, our citizens, trading  
to thofe ports, with their prop-  
erty, have been duly refpected,  
and privateering from thofe y~ ¢s  
has ceafed.  
  
In examining the claims of  
Britifh fubje&amp;ts by the commif-  
Yioners at Philadelphia, under  
the fixth article of the treaty of  
amity, comuterce and navigation,  
with Great Britain, a difference  
of opinion, on points deemed  
effential in the interpretation of  
that article, has ariten between  
the commiflioners appointed by  
the United States and the other  
ymembers of that board, from  
which the former have thought  
it their duty to withdraw. It is  
fincerely to be regretted, that the  
execution of an article, produced  
by a mutual fpirit of amity and  
jultice fhould have been thus un-  
avoidably intcrrupted. It is,  
however, confidently expected,  
that the fame fpirit of amity, and  
the fame fenfe of juftice, in  
which it originated, will lead to  
fatisfactory explanations. Incon-

pofes in the city of Wafhington,  
from which they conciude, that  
the removal of the feat of gov-  
etnment to that place, at the  
time required, will be prattica-  
ble, and the accommodations fat-  
isfactorys Their report will be  
laid before you.  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
_ I fhall dire&amp; the eftimates of  
the appropriations, necefiary for  
the fervice of the enfuing year,  
together with an account of the  
revenue and e¥penditure, to be  
laid before you. During a peri-  
od in which a great portion of  
the civilized world has been in-  
volved in a war, unufually calam-  
itous and de(tructive, it was not  
to be expected, that the United  
States could be exempted from  
extraordinary burthens. Al-  
though the period is not arrived,  
when the meafures adopted to  
fecure our country againtt foreign  
attack can be renounced, yet it  
is alike neceflary to the honour of  
the government, and the fatis-  
faction of the community, that  
an exact economy fhould be  
maintained. I invite you, Gen-  
tlemen, to inveftigate the differ-  
ent brances of the public expen-  
diture. The examination will  
lead to beneficial retrenchments,  
or produce a conviction of the  
wifdom of the meafures to which  
the expenditure relates.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,

it of war is prevalent in almoft  
every nation, with whofe affairs  
the intere{ts of the United States  
have any connection, unfafe and  
precarious would be our fitua-  
tion, were we to neglect the  
means of maintaining our jutt  
rights. The refult of the mif-  
fion to France is uncertain ; but  
however it may terminate, a  
fteady perieverance in a fyftem  
of national defence, commentfu-  
rate with our refources, and the  
fituation af our country, is an ob-  
vious dictate of wifdom. For  
remotely as we are placed from  
the belligerent nations, and defir-  
ous as we are, by doing juftice  
to all, to avoid offence to any,  
nothing fhort of the power of re-  
pelling aggreflions, will fecure to  
our country, a rational profpect  
of efcaping the calamities of war,  
  
or national degradation. As te  
myfelf, it is my anxious defire,  
fo to execute the truft repofed in  
me, as to render the people of  
the United States profperous and  
happy. I rely, with entire con-  
fidence, on your co-operation, in  
objects equally your care, and  
that our mutual labours will ferve  
to increafe and confirm union  
among our fellow-citizens, and  
an unfhaken attachment to our  
government.

liut, while thefe numerous hlcirirrgs  
art recollcitcd, it is a p?infiil duty to  
.advert to tlie ungr.ttcful return wiv-ch  
been made Ur them, bv forre (d the  
pei pic, in ccitain counties of Eti nfyl-  
  
s. ^M, where, reduced by the arts and  
iiMlVcprd&#x27;cntaiions of dcfigr.ir&#x27;g nicn,  
il tV o«vc op nly rdi&#x27;ded the law, di-  
reil’.Dj the valuiljoncf houlcsand lands.  
  
Such defiance was given to the civil au¬  
thority as rendered hopciefs all furtlu r  
attempts, by judicial procefs, to enforce  
the execution of the law ; and it bccau&#x27;c  
neceflTary to diredt a military force lobe  
employed, confifting of fume e«)nipanics  
of regular troops, volunteers, and mi¬  
litia, by whofe zeal and aCliviiy, in co¬  
operation with the judicial power, order  
and fubrr.iirion were re(lortd,and many  
of the offenders arrclUd. Of thel&#x27;e, fome  
have been convidted of inifdcmcanors,  
and ethers, charged with various riiuics,  
remain to be tried.  
  
To give due effedf to the civil admi-  
nifiration of government, and to enfiirc  
a juft execution of the laws, a revilijn  
and amendment of the judiciary fyfiem  
is indirpenfably necclfary. In this ex-  
ttnfivc country it cannot but happen,  
that numerous queftions rcTpcdting the  
interpretation of the laws, and the rights  
and duties of ofiicers and citizens, mull  
xrife. On the one hand, the laws ftmuM  
be executed ; on the other, individuals  
fhould he guarded from oppreHion :  
neither of thefe objtfls is fufficienlly  
allured, under the prefenc organization  
of the judicial department, I therefore  
carncftly recommend the fubjc6l to your  
Icrious confidcrarion.  
  
Ptrftvtring in the pacific and humane  
policy, wiiich had been inv.ariably pro-  
feffed and finccrely purfued by the  
Extcuiive Authority cf the United  
Slates; when indications were made, on  
the part of the French Republic, of a  
difp. fiiion to accommodate the cxilVmg  
dilVercnces between the two countries, 1  
felt it to be my duty to prepare for  
meeting their advances, by a nomination  
of Minifters, upon certain conditi.ms,  
  
which  
  
FOR FEBRUARY iSoo.  
  
which the honour of our country dic-  
titcd, and which its mo&lt;lerancu had  
given it a right to prtl&#x27;cnbt. The afl&#x27;u-  
ranccs which were required ot the  
French Governmenr, piryious to the  
departure of our Envoys, have hren  
given, ihrough their MinilUruf Foreign  
Reiarioiis, and I have dircdled them to  
proceed on their milfion to Paris. They  
have full power to conclude a treaty,  
fubje^.l to the conllitutional advice and  
confcni of the Senate. The char&#x27;ti^ers  
of ihclt Gentlemen arc fare pledges to  
their country, that nothing incompatible  
with its honour or intcreR, nothing  
inconfiftent with uiir obligations of good  
faithi or fricndHup to any other natioi^,  
will be hipulated.  
  
It appearing probable, from the in¬  
formation 1 received, tlut our commer¬  
cial intcrcourfc with lome ports in the  
illand of St. Domingo might fafely be&#x27;  
renewed, I took luch tUps as feemed to  
me expedient to afccnain that point.  
The lefult l&gt;€ing fatisfailory, 1 then, in  
conformity with the A^t of Congrefs  
on the fubjei&#x27;it, dircAcd the rcftraints  
and prohibitions of that intcrcourfe to  
be difeontinued on terms which were  
made known by proclamation. Since  
the renewal of this intercourfey our ci¬  
tizens trading to thole portSy with their  
properly, have been duly rdpe^fed, and  
privateering from thofe ports have  
ccafcd.  
  
In examining the claims of Britilh  
fubje£ts by the Commiliioners at Phila-  
delphUy under the Axth article of the  
treaty of amity, commerce» and navi¬  
gation with Great Britain, a ditference  
of opinion on points deemed elTcntial in  
the interpretation uf that article has  
arifen between the CommiiTioncrs ap«  
pointed by the United States and the  
othcrMcmbcrsof that Board, from which  
the fornicr have thought it their duty  
to withdraw. Jt is linccrely to be re¬  
gretted that the execution of an article  
produced by a mutual fpirit of amity  
and judice Ihould h.ivc &#x27;uecti thus una¬  
voidably interrupted,—It is, however,  
conAdently expected that the fame fpirit  
•f amity and the fame fenfe of judice  
in which it originated, will Ic&#x27;id to  
fatisfadfory explanations. In conle-  
quence of *thc &#x27; blfacles to the progrefs  
of the commiiriun in Philadcl^&gt;hia, his  
Britannic M&lt;^jeby has dire£ted the Com-

In his speech, of 3d December, 1899, President Adams  
observes:  
  
« At a period like the ee when momentous changes  
are occurring, and every hour is preparing new and great  
events in the political world; when a spirit of war is preva-  
lent in almost every nation, with whose affairs the interests  
of the United States have any connection, unsafe and preca-  
rious would be our situation, were we to neglect the means  
of maintaining our just rights. The result of the mission to  
France is uncertain: but, however it may terminate, a steady  
perseverance in a system of national defence, commensurate  
with our resources, and the situation of our country, is an ob-  
vious dictate of wisdom. For, remotely as we are placed from  
the belligerent nations, and desirous as we are by doing justice  
to all, to avoid offence to any; nothing short of the power of  
repelling aggressions, will secure to our country a rational  
prospect of escaping the calamities of war, or national degra-  
dation. As to myself, it is my anxious desire so to execute the  
trust reposed in me, as to render the people of the United  
States prosperous and happy. I rely, with entire confi-  
dence, on your co-operation in objects equally your care; and  
that our mutual labors will serve, to increase and confirm union  
among our fellow citizens, and an unshaken attachment to our  
government.”

December next, it should be transferred  
from Philadelphia to the District chosen

the removal of the seat of government  
to that place, will be practicable, and the  
accommodation satistactory.  
Now, from the above we may justly  
conclude that the reason for removing  
the Capitol from New York to Philadel­  
phia, or from Philadelphia to the Dis­  
trict of Columbia, was because it was  
more practicable and the aocom mediation
