ear Sir  
Monticello  
Mar. 3. 18.  
  
I have just recieved your favor of Feb. 20. in which you observe that mr Wirt, in pa. 47. of his Life of Patrick Henry, quotes me as saying that ‘mr Henry certainly gave the first impulse to the ball of revolution.’ I well recollect to have used some such expression in a letter to him; and am tolerably certain that, our own state being the subject under contemplation, I must have used it with respect to that only. whether he has given it a more general aspect, I cannot say, as the passage is not in the page you quote, nor, after thumbing over much of the book, have I been able to find it. in page 417. there is something like it, but not the exact expression; and even there it may be doubted whether mr Wirt had his eye on Virginia alone, or on all the colonies. but the question Who commenced the revolution? is as difficult as that of the first inventors of a thousand good things. for example who first discovered the principle of Gravity? not Newton: for Galileo who died the year that Newton was born, had measured it’s force in the descent of gravid bodies. who invented the Lavoiserian chemistry? the English say Dr Black, by the preparatory discovery of latent heat. who invented the steam boat? was it Gerbert, the Marquis of Worcester, Newcomen, Savary, Papin, Fitch, Fulton? the fact is that one new idea leads to another, that to a 3d and so on thro’ a course of time, until some one, with whom no one of these ideas was original, combines all together, and produces what is justly called a new invention. I suppose it would be as difficult to trace our revolution to it’s first embryo. we do not know how long it was hatching in the British cabinet before they ventured to make the first of the experiments which were to develope it in the end and to produce compleat parliamentary supremacy. those you mention in Massachusets as preceding the stamp act might be the first visible symptoms of that design. the proposition of that act in 1764. was the first here. your opposition therefore preceded ours, as occasion was sooner given there than here. and the truth, I suppose is, that the opposition in every colony began whenever the encroachment was presented to it. this question of priority is as the enquiry would be Who first, of the 300. Spartans, offered his name to Leonidas? I shall be happy to see justice done to the merits of all, by the unexceptionable umpirage of dates &amp; facts, and especially from the pen which is proposed to be employed in it.  
I rejoice indeed to learn from you that mr Adams retains the strength of his memory, his faculties, his cheerfulness, and even his epistolary industry. this last is gone from me. the aversion has been growing on me for a considerable time, and now, near the close of 75. is become almost insuperable. I am much debilitated in body, and my memory sensibly on the wane. still however I enjoy good health and spirits, and am as industrious a reader as when a student at College. not of newspapers. these I have discarded. I relinquish, as I ought to do, all intermedling with public affairs, committing myself chearfully to the watch and care of those, for whom, in my turn, I have watched and cared. when I contemplate the immense advances in science, and discoveries in the arts which have been made within the period of my life, I look forward with confidence to equal advances by the present generation; and have no doubt they will consequently be as much wiser than we have been, as our fathers we than our fathers were, and they than the burners of witches. even the metaphysical contest, which you so pleasantly described to me in a former letter, will probably end in improvement, by clearing the mind of Platonic mysticism, &amp; unintelligible jargon.   altho age is taking from me the power of communicating by letter with my friends, as industriously as heretofore, I shall still claim with them the same place they will ever hold in my affections, and on this ground, I with sincerity and pleasure assure you of my great esteem and respect.

MONTICELLO, March 3. 1818.  
Dean Sgr~el have just received your faver  
of Feb. 90, ic which yoa observe that Mr.  
Wirt, in page 47, of his Life of Patsick Hen-  
Ty, quotes me as saying that ** M. Heary  
®ertainly gave the fiist impulse to tae ball of  
revolutton ™ I well, recotlect to Rave used  
some sueh egpression tw a letter to him ; and  
am tolerably certaia that, our owh - Siate be­  
fog the subject vader contemplation, 1 must  
biave used it wi b respect to that only. Wheth.  
or be hus given it @« moie general aspect, 1  
cannot say, as the passage is not in the page  
you quoie, nor, ufter thainbing over much of  
the bonk, have I been able to find it. In  
prge 417 thero is something like ity but not  
the exac: expression ; and even there 1t may  
be doubted whethoi: Mr Wirt had his oy~ on  
Viigiuia alone, or on ail the colonies Bu:  
the question. WA commenced (he revolurion ?  
is an difßoult as that of (he st inveniois of a  
thousand good things. For example, who  
m &#x27; scoveced the principle of gravity T Not  
¥ wton ;) for Galiteo, who died the year that  
No v on wis barn, had messared its force in  
the descent of gravid badies. Who invented  
the Lavoiserian chemistry ? The Eaglish say  
D:. Biack, by the preparaiory discovery of  
Jatens hests \Who iovented the 9&#x27;eam boat ?  
Wis it Gerbery, the Marquis of Wao cester,  
N:wcowd, Bavory, Paipin, Fiteh, Fulton ?  
Toe fact is, that one new idea léads to anoth­  
e, that to @ third, and 90 on through a course  
ef time. until some one, with whom no one  
of theso ideas was e!iginal, combines ell to­  
gether, and prodaces what is justly called a  
now invention, I suppose it would be as diffi­  
cult to trace o revolution to its first embryo.  
We do net know hew long it was batehing in  
the British cabinet before they vemrurced to  
moke the Bret of the experiments which were  
to devalop it in Ihe end, and to produce com  
plete parliamentary sepremacy.—Those you  
mention in&#x27; Massachusetts as precediog tlie  
stamp act, might be the first visible rpmp­  
toms of that design. The proposition omal  
act in 17684, was the first bere. Your oppe­  
sition therefore preceded ours, as oceasion  
was sboner given there than here. And the  
truih, I suppose is, that the opposition in ov­  
ery colony began whenever the enaroachment  
was presented to it. This quastionof prior.  
tiy is as the inquiry would be, who first, of  
the 800 Sparians, o‘cud lils name to Leeni

the merits of all, by the unexceptionable am­  
zluge of datde and facts;® and especially

I rejoice indeed to learn from yeu that M-  
Adsms retains the strength of his memo&#x27;y  
his facalties, his cheerfalness, and even his  
epivolary industry. This last is gene from  
from me. The aversion has been growing  
oo me fer a considorable time, and now, our  
the close of Y 5, is becoming almost inswport­  
sble. T am much debilivated in body, sad my

When I contemplate the immense sdven.

Plaronic mysti¢ism, and unintetigible ja-gon.  
Although ade iv taking from me the pow­

MonvicEet1o, March Sd, 1818.  
** Dear Sir,  
  
«IT have just received your favor  
of February 20, in which you observe  
that Mr. Wirt, in page 47 of his Life  
of Patrick Henry, quotes me as say-  
ing that “ Mr. Henry certainly gave  
the first impulse to the bill of revolu-  
tion.” I well recolicct to have used  
some such expression in a letter to)  
him; and am tolerably certain, that, |  
our own State being the subject un- |  
der contemplation, 1 must have used }  
it with respect to that only.—Whe-  
ther it has given a more general as-  
  
I been able to find it. In page 417  
there is something like it, but not the  
exact expression ; and even there it  
may be doubted whether Mr. Wirt  
had his eyes on Virginia alone, or on  
all the colonies. But the question  
Who commenced the revolution ? is *  
difficult as that of the first inventors  
of a thousand good things. For ex.  
ample, who first discovered the prin.  
ciple of gravity ¢ Not Newton; for  
Galileo, who died in the year that  
Newton was born, had measured its  
force in the descent of gravitated bo-  
dies. Who invented the Lavoiserian  
chemistry? The English say Dr,  
Black, by the preparitory discovery  
of latent heat.—-—Who invented the  
steam-boat? Was it Gerbert, the  
Marquis of Worcester, Newcomb, Sa-  
vary, Papin, Fitch, Fulton ?—The  
fact is, that one new idea leads to  
another, that to a third, and so on  
through a course of time, until some  
one, with whom no one of these ideas  
was original, combines all together,  
and produces what is justly called a  
new invention. I suppose it would be  
as difficult to trace our revolution to  
its first embryo. We do not know  
how long it was hatching in the Bri-  
tish cabinet before they ventured to  
make the first of the experiments,  
which were to devolve it in the end;  
and to produce complete parliamenta-  
ry supremacy. Those you mention  
in Massachusetts as preceding the  
stamp act, might be the first visible  
symptoms of that design. The pro-  
position of that act in 1764, was thie  
first here. Your proposition there-  
fore preceded ours, as occasion was  
sooner given there than hers, And  
the truth, I suppose is, that the op-  
position in every colony began when-  
ever the encroachment was presented  
to it. &quot;Chis question of priority is as  
the inquiry would be, who first, of  
the 300 Spartans offered his name to  
Leonidas ?—I shall be happy to see
