[New York] Thursday evening, July 12. 1804.  
Mr. Coleman,  
  
The public mind being extremely agitated by the melancholy fate of that great man, Alexander Hamilton, I have thought it would be grateful to my fellow-citizens, would provide against misrepresentation, and, perhaps, be conducive to the advancement of the cause of religion, were I to give a narrative of some facts which have fallen under my own observation, during the time which elapsed between the fatal duel and his departure out of this world.  
Yesterday morning, immediately after he was brought from Hoboken to the house of Mr. Bayard, at Greenwich, a message was sent informing me of the sad event, accompanied by a request from General Hamilton, that I would come to him for the purpose of administering the holy communion. I went; but being desirous to afford time for serious reflection, and conceiving that under existing circumstances, it would be right and proper to avoid every appearance of precipitancy in performing one of the most solemn offices of our religion, I did not then comply with his desire. At one o’clock I was again called on to visit him. Upon my entering the room and approaching his bed, with the utmost calmness and composure he said, “My dear Sir, you perceive my unfortunate situation, and no doubt have been made acquainted with the circumstances which led to it. It is my desire to receive the communion at your hands. I hope you will not conceive there is any impropriety in my request.” He added, “It has for some time past been the wish of my heart, and it was my intention to take an early opportunity of uniting myself to the church, by the reception of that holy ordinance.” I observed to him, that he must be very sensible of the delicate and trying situation in which I was then placed; that however desirous I might be to afford consolation to a fellow mortal in distress; still, it was my duty as a minister of the gospel, to hold up the law of God as paramount to all other law; and that, therefore, under the influence of such sentiments, I must unequivocally condemn the practice which had brought him to his present unhappy condition. He acknowledged the propriety of these sentiments, and declared that he viewed the late transaction with sorrow and contrition. I then asked him, “Should it please God, to restore you to health, Sir, will you never be again engaged in a similar transaction? and will you employ all your influence in society to discountenance this barbarous custom?” His answer was, “That, Sir, is my deliberate intention.”  
I proceeded to converse with him on the subject of his receiving the Communion; and told him that with respect to the qualifications of those who wished to become partakers of that holy ordinance, my inquiries could not be made in language more expressive than that which was used by our Church. “Do you sincerely repent of your sins past? Have you a lively faith in God’s mercy through Christ, with a thankful remembrance of the death of Christ? And are you disposed to live in love and charity with all men?” He lifted up his hands and said, “With the utmost sincerity of heart I can answer those questions in the affirmative—I have no ill will against Col. Burr. I met him with a fixed resolution to do him no harm. I forgive all that happened.” I then observed to him, that the terrors of the divine law were to be announced to the obdurate and impenitent: but that the consolations of the Gospel were to be offered to the humble and contrite heart: that I had no reason to doubt his sincerity, and would proceed immediately to gratify his wishes. The Communion was then administered, which he received with great devotion, and his heart afterwards appeared to be perfectly at rest. I saw him again this morning, when with his last faltering words, he expressed a strong confidence in the mercy of God through the intercession of the Redeemer. I remained with him until 2 o’clock this afternoon, when death closed the awful scene—he expired without a struggle, and almost without a groan.  
By reflecting on this melancoly event, let the humble believer be encouraged ever to hold fast that precious faith which is the only source of true consolation in the last extremity of nature. Let the Infidel be persuaded to abandon his opposition to that gospel which the strong, inquisitive, and comprehensive mind of a Hamilton embraced, in his last moments, as the truth from heaven. Let those who are disposed to justify the practice of duelling, be induced, by this simple narrative, to view with abhorrence that custom which has occasioned in irreparable loss to a worthy and most afflicted family: which has deprived his friends of a beloved companion, his profession of one of its brightest ornaments, and his country of a great statesman and a real patriot.  
With great respect,   I remain   your friend and ser’t,  
  
Benjamin Moore.

it would be right and proper to avoid every

muft be,wery fenfible of the delicate and

that I had no reafen to doubt his fince- j

was then adminiftered, which he re­

of the Redeemer. I remained with  
him until 2 o&#x27;clock this afternoon,  
when death clofed the awSul Scene—he  
expired without a ftruggle, and almoft  
without a groan. *  
By refic&amp;ing on this melancholy e­  
vent, let the humble believer be encou­  
raged ever to hold fall that precijus  
faith which is the only Source of true  
confolation in the laft extremity of na­

abandon his cppufition to that gofpel  
which the Strong, inquifitive, and com­  
prehensive mind of. a Hamilton embra­  
ced, in his laft moments, as the truth  
from Heaven. Let thofe who are dif­  
pof&#x27;d to jultify the practice of duelling,  
be induced, by this Simple narrative, to  
view with abhorrence that cuftom which  
hit occasioned an irreparable bis to a

has deprived his friends of a beloved  
cempanior, his proftfficn one ot its

that under exifting circumftances, it would be

Thursday Evening, Fuly 12, 1804. scene.  
Mr. CoLeMan, withot  
The public mind being extremely agitated by the By  
melancholy fate of that great man, ALEXANDER humb  
HAMILTON, I have thought it would be grateful that |  
to my fellow-citizens, would provide against misre- true ¢  
presentation, and, perhaps, be conducive to the Let tl  
advancement of the cause of Religion, were I to give sitlop  
anarrative of some facts which have failen under my and c  
own observation, during the time which elapsed be- brace  
tween the fatal duel, and his departure out of this ileave  
world. pract  
Yesterday morning, immediately after he was narrat  
brought from Hoboken to the house of Mr. Bayard. wiich  
at Greenwich, a message was sent informing me tay at  
of the sad event, accompanied by a request from ais fr  
General Hamilton, that I would come to him for of one  
the purpose of administering the holy communion. J wa g  
I went; but, being desirous to afford time for  
serious reflection, and conceiving, that, under ex-  
isting circumstances, it would be right and prope!  
to avoid every appearance of precipitancy in per-  
forming one of the most solemn offices of our  
religion, I did not then comply with his desire. At &#x27;  
one o&#x27;clock I was again called on to visit him.  
Upon my entering the room and approaching his _ On  
bed, with the utmost calmness and composure hej Tam.  
said, “ My dear sir, ycu perceive my unfortunate areey  
situation, and no doubt have been made acquainted hat  
with the circumstances which led to it. It is my vhat  
desire to receive che communion at your hands. I —  
hope you will not conceive there is any improprie- eee:  
ty in my request.” He then added, “ It bas for TI  
some time past been the wish of my heart, end it “ol  
was my intention of taking an early opportunity, of f ne *.  
uniting myself to the Church, by the reception of f a6  
that holy ordinance.” I observed to him, that he§ eg J  
must be very sensible of the delicate and trying tig  
situation in which I was then placed; that, hew- with  
ever desirous I micrht be to afford consclation to ag vith  
fellow mortal in distress, still, it was my duty, asa Banc  
minister of the Gospel, to hold up the law of GOD§ TI  
as paramount to all other law: and that, therefore, @ colur  
under the influence of such sentiments, ] must with  
unequivocally condemn the practice which hadg mare  
brought him to his present unhappy condition. Hes in th  
acknowledged the propriety of these sentiments 1nd |  
and declared that he viewed the late transaction§ cher

» Should it please God to resiore you to neaith, sir,  
will you never be again engaged in a similar trans-  
  
Faction? aid wiltyou employ all your influence in §0-  
  
ciety to discountenance this barbarous custom ” His  
answer was, “ That, sir, is my deliberate intention.”  
  
I proceeded te converse with him on the subject  
of his receiving the Communion; and told. him  
that with Pespect to the qualifications of those, who  
wished to become partakers of that holy ordinance,  
  
3 my inquiries could uot be made in language more  
  
expressive than that which was used by our church—  
« Do you sincerely repent of your sins past! Have  
  
f you a lively faith in God’s mercy through Christ,  
  
with a thankful remembrance of the deathof Christ?  
And are you disposed to live in love and charity  
with all men?” He lifted up his hands, and said,  
+ With the utmost sincerity of heart I c&amp;a answer  
those questions in the affirmative—I have no ill-will  
against Col. Burr. I met him with a fixed resolu-  
tion to do him no harm—I forgive all that happen-  
ed.” I then observed to him, that the terrors of  
the divine law were to be announced to the obdu-  
  
fate and impenitent ; but that the consolations of  
  
the Gospel were to be offered to the humble and  
contrite heart; that f had no reason to doubt his  
sincerity, and would proceed immediately to gratify  
ais wishese ‘The Communion was then administer-  
ed, which he received with great devotion, and his  
heart afterwards appeared to be perfectly at rest. 1  
saw him again this morning, when, with his last  
faultering words, he expressed a strong confidence  
in the mercy of God, through the intercession of  
the Redeemer. I remained with him until two  
o&#x27;clock this afternoon, when death closed the awful  
scene. —He expired without a struggle, and almost  
without a groan.  
  
By reflecting on this melancholy event, let the  
humble Believer be encouraged ever to hold fast  
that precious faith, which is the only source of  
true consolation in the last extremity of nature.  
Let the Infidel be persuaded to abandon his oppo-  
sition to the Gospel, which the strong, inquisitive,  
and comprehensive mind of a HAMILTON em-  
braced, in his last moments, as the truth from  
Heaven. Let those who are disposed to justify the  
practice of duelling be induced, by this simple  
narrative, to view with abhorrence that custom  
  
M viich has occasioned an irreparable loss to a wor-  
  
’  
  
  
  
  
  
tuy and most ailiicted family; which has deprived  
his friends of a beloved companion ; his profession  
of one of its brightest ornaments ; and his country  
of a great Statesman and a real Patriot.  
With great respect, I remain  
Your friend and servant,

ers.  
Thursday evening, July 12, 1804.  
Mr. Coleman,  
ri he public, mind being extremely­  
agitated by the melancholy fate of that  
great man, Alexander Hamilton, I  
have thought it would be grateful to my  
fellow-citizens, would provide against mis­  
representation, and, perhaps, be conducive  
to the advancement of the cause of reli&lt;M­  
  
on, were I to give a narrative of some fatls  
which have fallen under my own observa­  
tion, during the time which elapsed be­  
tween the fatal duel and his departure out  
of this world.  
Yesterday morning, immediately after  
he was broughtfrom Hoboken to the house  
of Mr. Bayard, at Greenwich, a message  
was sent informing me of the sad event,  
accompanied by a request from Gen. Ha­  
nvlton, that I would come to him for the  
purpose of administering the holy ccm­  
munion. I went j hut being desirous to  
alTord time for serious reflefction, and con­  
ceiving that under existing circums&#x27;auces,  
it would be right and proper to avoid eve­  
ry appearance of precipitancy in perform­  
ing one of the most solemn offices of our  
religion, I dic\ not then comply with his  
desire. At one o’clock I was again called  
on to visit him. Upon my entering ths  
room and approaching Ins bfcd, with the  
utmost calmness and composure he said,  
“ My dear sir, you perceive my unfoitu­  
nate situation, and no doubt have been  
made acquainted with the circumstances  
which led to it. Tt is my desite to receive  
the communion at your hands. 1 hope  
you will not conceive there is any impio­  
propriefy in my request.” lie added,“ It  
has for some time past been the wish of  
my heart, and it was my intention intake  
an early opportunity ol uniting myself to  
the church, by the reception of that holy  
ordinance.” 1 ob erved to him, that he  
must be very sensible of the delicate and  
trying situation in which I was then pla­  
ced : that however desirous I might he to  
afford consolation to a fellow mortal in dis­  
tress : still it was my duty, as a minister of  
. i i.i i . . ....  
  
^ me i&lt;%v, oi ooci as  
paramount to all other law: and that,  
therefore, under the influence of such sen­  
timents, I must unequivocally condemn  
the practice which hud brought him to  
his present unhappy condition. He nc.  
knowledged I lie propriety of these senti­  
ments and declared that lie viewed the  
late transaction with sorrow and contriti­  
on. I then asked him, “ Should it please  
(Mod, to restore yon to health, sir. will you  
never ho engaged in a similar transaction ?  
and will you employ all your influence jn  
society to discountenance this barbarous  
custom ? His answer was, “ That, sir, is  
n*y deliberate intention.”  
I proceeded to converse with him on  
the subject of his receiving the rornmuni­  
on and told him that with respeft to the  
qualifications of those who wished to be­  
come partakers of that holy ordinance, my  
enquiiics could not be made in language  
more expressive than that which was used  
!&gt;&gt;&#x27; m.r (Muirr.Ii—“ Do you sincerely re­  
m-m of your si.,* p-.-.i &gt; ||ave yrn n |iv,.}r

hun. that the terrors of die divine law  
w-.-re to be announced to the obdurate and  
impenitent: but that the consolation of the  
Xlospel were to be offered to tlie humble  
Ond contrite heart; that l had no reason to  
sliuibt his sincerity, and would proceed im­  
&#x27;riiediatelylo g&#x27;ra’ifyhis wishes. TheCom­  
munion was then administered, which he  
received with great devotion, and his  
heart afterwards appeared to he perfefilly  
at rest. 1 saw him again this morning,  
when with his last Cankering words heex­  
pressed a strong confidence in the mercy  
or God through the intercession of tlie  
Redeemer. I remained with him until  
2 o’clock this afternoon when death closed  
the awful scene—he expired without a  
stniggle, and almost without a groan.  
By relieving on this melancholy even’,  
let tlie humble believer be encouraged o­  
ver to hold fast that precious faith which  
is the only source of true consolation in  
tlie last extremity of nature. Let the  
infidel be persuaded to abandon his oppo­  
sition to that Gospel which the strong, in­  
quisitive, and comprehensive mind of a  
HAinr.Towembractd,in his last moments,  
as the truth, from heaven. Let those who  
are disposed to justify the prat-lice of du­  
elling,lie induced, by this simple narrative,  
to view with abhorrence that custom which  
has occasioned an irreparable loss to a  
worthy and most afflicted family: which  
has deprived bis friends of a beloved com •  
panion, his profession of one of its bright­  
est ornaments, and his country, of a great  
stalesm ui and a real patriot,  
WVh great respect,  
I remain vour friend and servant,  
BENJAMIN MOORE.

k my deliberate retention.**  
I proceeded to convene with turn on  
die aubjeet of his receiving i  
nion | and told him that with respect to  
the qualification* of those *h;&gt; wished to  
become partaketa of that holy ordinance,  
my enquiries could not be made in lan­  
guage more expressive than that which  
waa used by our Church—“ Do you sin-&#x27;  
*» eerely repent of your tins past 1 Have  
you a lively faith in God’s mercy thro*  
with a thankful remembrance  
“of the death of Christ 1 And are you  
•* disposed to live intoVe and charity with  
f all men i” He lifted up his hands and  
pud, “ With the utmost sincerity ol  
* heart I can answer those questions in  
* the affirmative—I have no 4IL will a­  
** gainst Col. Burr. I met him with a  
* ist resolution to do him no harm—I  
41 forgive all that happened.** I then ob­  
served to him, that the terrorsofthe law  
were to be announced to tbe obdurate and  
impenitent; but that the consolations ol  
the Gospel were to be offered to the hum­  
ble and contrite heart: that I had no rea­  
son to doubt his sincerity, and would pro­  
edfcd immediately to gratifyhia wishes.  
The Communion was then administered  
which he received with great devotion.  
It his heart afterwards appeared to be per­  
fectly at rest. Isa* him again this morn­  
ing, when with his fauluring words he  
expressed a strong confidence in the  
lasisercy of God through the intercession  
[p ief the Redeemer. 1 remained with him  
antil 3 o’clock this afternoon, when  
death closed the awful scene—he expir­  
ed without a struggle, and almost with­  
out a groan.  
By reflecting on this melancholy e­  
Vent, let thehumble believer be encou­  
raged ever to hold fast that precious faith  
which is the onlusource of true consola­  
tion in the last Wtreniity of nature. Let  
the infidel be persuaded to abandon his  
opposition to that Gospel which the  
atrong, inquisitive, and comprehensive  
anindofa Hamilton embraced, in hia  
last moments, as the troth from Heaven,  
Let those who are disposed to justify the  
practice of dueling, be induced, by this  
simple narative, to view with abhor­  
rence that custom which has occasioned  
on irreparable loss to a worthy and most  
oflicted family j which has deprived his  
friends of a beloved companion, his pro­

Thursday Evening. July 12rh 1804.  
!ra. Coleman,  
tIip nubile mind being extremely  
an-itatcd by the melancholy fate of  
tht great man, rvii.-n--&#x27;&quot;  
HAMILTON, I have thought it  
Avouid be grateful to my fellow cm  
ens,  
would provide against, misre  
nr .mentation, and, perhaps,  
be con-  
rYcive to the enh ancement of t!  
the  
,,nc. rf Relifriohr were 1 to give a  
mrra-tive of some facts which have  
&#x27;fajlen&#x27; under my own observation,  
dui-inc the time which elapsed be-  
ttreen the fatal duel and his departure  
from this world. .  
Yesterday&#x27; mornln&#x27;e, immediately  
pfer he was brought from Hoboken  
to the hou$oi Mr. Bayard, at Orern-vhch.-a  
message was sent informing  
me of the said event, accompanied by  
w-nv-Kt f-om Gen. Hamilton, that  
I would come to hi hi for the purpose  
of administering the holy commu­  
nion. I went ; but lining desirous tc  
affordime for serious reflection, and  
conceiving that under existing cir­  
cumstances, it would be right and  
proper to avoid -every appearance of  
precipitancy in performing one of the  
most solemn olfic-s of our religion,  
I did not then &#x27;comply with his de­  
sire. At one o&#x27;clock I was again  
called on to visit him Upon entering  
the room, and approaching his bed,  
-with the utmost calmness and com­  
posure he said, &quot; My dear Sir, you  
perceive my unfortunate situation,  
2c no doubt have been made acquain­  
ted with the circumstances which led  
to it. It is my desire to receive the  
.communion at your hands, t hope  
you &quot;will not conceive there is any  
impropriety in my request.&#x27; He  
added, &quot; It has for some time past  
been the wish of my heirt, and it  
was my intention to take an early  
opportunity of uniting myself to the  
church, by the reception of that holy  
ordinance.&quot; I observed to him5, that  
he must be very sensible of the deli­  
cate and trying situation in which I  
was then placed : that. however desi­  
rous! might be to afford consolation  
t j a fellow mortal in distress ; still,  
it was .my duty, as a minister of the:  
gospel, to hold up 1 the law of God  
as paramount to all other law j and  
that, therefore, under the influence  
oi&quot; such sentiments, I must utequi­  
vocallyjcondemn the practice which  
hud nrdught him to his present un­  
happy condition. He acknowledged  
the propriety of these sentiments, and  
declared that Ire viewed the late tran­  
saction with sorrow and contrition.  
I then asked him, &quot;Should it please  
God to restore you to health, Sir,  
Vill you never be again engaged in  
a similar transaction ; and will you  
employ all your influence in society  
to discountenance this barbarous cus­  
tom?&quot; His answer was,&quot; &quot; That,  
Sir, is my deliberate intention.&quot;  
I proceeded to converse with him  
on the subject of His3 receiving the  
Communion; and told&#x27; him that with  
&#x27;pect&#x27;fothe qualifications&#x27; of those  
w.o wished to become partakers; of  
that holy ordinance, my enquiries  
could not be made, in language more  
expressive than that which was -used  
our Church, -4.&quot; Do you sincerely  
&quot; repent of your past sins ? Have  
you a lively faith) in God&#x27;s mercy  
&#x27; &#x27;l!lugh &#x27;Christ, with a thankful re-  
jmembrarice of the death of Christ?  
i And are von disnosed to live in  
, 10V  
ve  
and charitv with all men V  
.r -  
He lifted up his ! hands and said?  
Vv ith the utmost sincerity of heart  
t 1 can answer those questions m  
&#x27; th affirmative I have no ill-will  
&quot;gainst Col. Burr. I met him  
&quot;&#x27;th a fixed resolution - to do him  
u n harm I forgive all that happen­  
ed&quot; I then observed to him, that  
e terrors of the divine law were- to  
announced to the .obdurate and  
&quot;Penitent; but that the Consolations  
iKltie sptd&#x27; were to be offered to  
, tumble and contrito heart ; that  
no reason to doubt his sincerity,  
? ud proceed immediately to  
ias IL Ts TheCommunior  
htar rNVUiy sreal evotion and his  
ferfll aUervas appeared to&#x27; be per-  
oaui tula  
  
morning, when with his last faulter­  
ing words he expressed a strong con­  
fidence in the mercy of God through  
the intercession of the Redeemer. I  
remained with him untill 2 O&#x27;clock  
this afternoon, when death closed  
the awful scene; He expired without  
a struggle, and almost without a  
groan  
By reflecting on this melancholy  
event, let the humble believer be en­  
couraged ever to hold fast that pre­  
cious faith which is the only source  
of true consolation in the last extre­  
mity of nature. Let the Infidel be per­  
suaded to abandon his opposition to  
  
f the gospel, which the strong lnqmsi-  
tive, ana comprenensive mina oi a.  
HAMILTON embraced, in his last  
moments, as the truth from heaven.  
Let those who are disposed to justify  
the practice of duelling be induced,  
by this simple narrative, to view with  
abhorrence that custom which has oc­  
casioned an irreparable loss to a w or­  
thy and most afflicted family; which  
has deprived his friends of a beloved  
companion, his profession of one of  
its brightest ornaments, and his  
country of a great statesman and a  
real patriot.  
With gret respect, I remain  
Your friend and sert

§F On the fubje&amp; of the distressing e­  
vent of Gen. HamMiLTONS death, the  
following letter has been received froni the  
Right Rev. Bishop MoORE :—  
Thursday Evening, July 12, 1804.  
The public mind being extremely agita­  
ted by the Melancholy fate of that great  
man, ALe XANDER HAMILTON, I have  
thought it would -be gratetul o my fellow  
citizens, would provide against mifreprefen.

vaacement of the cause of Religion, were X  
to give a narrative of some salts which have  
fillen under my own observation, during  
the time which elapsed between the fats  
duel and his departure out of this world,  
Yefterdey morning, immediately afier he  
was brought from Hoboken to the House of  
Mr. Bayard at Greenwich, a meflage was  
sent informing me of the {ad event, accom­  
panied by a request from General Hamilon,  
that I would come to him for the purpose  
of adminiflering tke holy communion. I  
went, but being defiroas to afford time for  
serious refle@ion, and conceiving that under  
existing circomftances, it would be right and  
proper to avoid every appearance of pr&#x27;écie&#x27;-’  
itancy in performing one of the most solemn  
offices of oar religion, I did not then conte  
ply with his desire. At one o’clock I was  
again called on to visit him. Upon niyen«  
tering the feom and approaching his bed,  
with the utmost composure he (aid, ** My

not conceive there is any impropriety in my

,was my intention to take an ecarly opportu.
