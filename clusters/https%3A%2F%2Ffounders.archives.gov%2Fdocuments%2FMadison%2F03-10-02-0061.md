Fellow Citizens of the Senate and ofthe House of Representatives.  
  
  
Washington  
Decr. 5. 1815.  
  
  
I have the satisfaction, on our present meeting, of being able to communicate to you, the successful termination of the war, which had been commenced against the United States by the regency of Algiers. The Squadron in advance, on that service, under Commodore Decatur, lost not a moment after its arrival in the mediterranean, in seeking the naval force of the Enemy, then cruising in that sea; and succeeded in capturing two of his ships, one of them the principal ship, commanded by the Algerine Admiral. The high character of the American commander was brilliantly sustained on the occasion, which brought his own ship into close action with that of his adversary; as was the accustomed gallantry of all the officers and men actually engaged. Having prepared the way by this demonstration of American skill and prowess, he hastened to the port of Algiers, where peace was promptly yeilded to his victorious force. In the terms stipulated, the rights and honor of the United States were particularly consulted, by a perpetual relinquishment, on the part of the Dey, of all pretensions to tribute from them. The impressions which have thus been made, strengthened as they will have been, by subsequent transactions with the regencies of Tunis and Tripoli, by the appearance of the larger force which followed under Commodore Bainbridge the cheif in command of the expedition, and by the judicious  
  
precautionary arrangements left by him in that quarter, afford a reasonable prospect of future security, for the valuable portion of our commerce, which passes within reach of the Barbary Cruisers.  
It is another source of satisfaction, that the Treaty of peace with Great Britain has been succeeded by a convention on the subject of commerce, concluded by the Plenipotentiaries of the two countries. In this result, a disposition is manifested on the part of that nation, corresponding with the disposition of the United States, which, it may be hoped, will be improved into liberal arrangements on other subjects, on which the parties have mutual interests, or which might endanger their future harmony. Congress will decide on the expediency of promoting such a Sequel, by giving effect to the measure of confining the American navigation, to American Seamen; a measure which, at the Same time that it might have that conciliatory tendency, would have the further advantage of increasing the independance of our navigation, and the scources for our maritime defence.  
In conformity with the Articles of the Treaty of Ghent relating to the Indians, as well as with a view to the tranquility of our Western and North Western frontiers, measures were taken to establish an immediate peace with the several Tribes who had been engaged in hostilities against the United States. Such of them as were invited to Detroit, acceded readily to a renewal of the former Treaties of friendship. Of the other tribes who were invited to a Station on the Mississippi, the greater number have also accepted the peace offered to them. The residue, consisting of the more distant Tribes or parts of Tribes, remain to be brought over by further explanations, or by such other means as may be adapted to the dispositions they may finally disclose.  
The Indian tribes within &amp; bordering on the southern frontier, whom a cruel war on their part had compelled us to chastise into peace, have latterly shewn a restlessness, which has called for preparatory measures for repressing it, and for protecting the Commissioners engaged in carrying the terms of the peace into execution.  
The execution of the act, for fixing the military peace establishment, has been attended with difficulties, which, even now, can only be overcome by legislative aid. The Selection of Officers; the payment and discharge of the troops enlisted for the war; the payment of the retained Troops, and their re-union from detached, and distant stations; the collection and security of the public property, in the Quarter Master; Commissary, and Ordonnance Departments; and the constant medical assistance required in Hospitals and Garrisons; rendered a compleat execution of the act impracticable on the first of May, the period more immediately contemplated. As soon, however, as circumstances would permit, and as far as it has been practicable, consistently with the public interests, the reduction of the army has been accomplished: but the appropriations for its pay, and for other branches  
  
of the military service, having proved inadequate, the earliest attention to that subject will be necessary; and the expediency, of continuing upon the peace establishment the staff officers who have hitherto been provisionally retained, is also recommended to the consideration of Congress.  
In the performance of the Executive duty upon this occasion, there has not been wanting a just sensibility to the merits of the American army, during the late war: but the obvious policy and design, in fixing an efficient military peace establishment, did not afford an opportunity to distinguish the aged and infirm, on account of their past services; nor the wounded and disabled, on account of their present sufferings. The extent of the reduction, in deed, unavoidably involved the exclusion of many meritorious officers of every rank, from the Service of their country; and so equal as well as so numerous, were the claims to attention, that a decision by the standard of comparative merit, could seldom be attained. Judged, however, in candor, by a general standard of positive merit, the Army Register will, it is beleived, do honor to the establishment; while the case of those Officers, whose names are not included in it, devolves, with the strongest interest, upon the legislative authority, for such provision, as shall be deemed the best calculated to give support and solace to the veteran and the invalid; to display the beneficence, as well as the justice, of the Government; and to inspire a martial zeal for the public service, upon every future emergency.  
Although the embarrassments arising from the want of an uniform national currency have not been diminished, Since the adjournment of Congress, great satisfaction has been derived, in contemplating the revival of the public credit, and the efficiency of the public resources. The receipts into the Treasury, from the various branches of the revenue during the nine months ending on the thirtieth of September last, have been estimated at twelve millions and a half of Dollars: the issues of Treasury notes of every denomination, during the same period, amounted to the sum of fourteen millions of Dollars: and there was, also, obtained upon loan, during the same period, a sum of nine millions of Dollars; of which the sum of six millions of Dollars was subscribed in cash, and the sum of three millions of Dollars in Treasury Notes. With these means, added to the sum of one million and a half of Dollars, being the balance of money in the Treasury on the first of January, there has been paid, between the first of January and the first of October, on account of the appropriations of the preceding, and of the present, year (exclusively of the Amount of the Treasury notes subscribed to the loan, and of the amount redeemed in the payment of duties and taxes) the aggregate sum of thirty three millions and a half of Dollars; leaving a balance then in the Treasury, estimated at the Sum of three millions of Dollars. Independent however of the arrearages due for military services and supplies, it is presumed that a further sum of five millions of  
  
Dollars, including the interest on the public debt payable on the first of January next, will be demanded at the Treasury to compleat the expenditures of the present year, and for which the existing ways and means will Sufficiently provide.  
The national debt, as it was ascertained on the first of October last, amounted, in the whole, to the sum of one hundred and twenty millions of Dollars, consisting of the unredeemed balance of the debt contracted before the late war (thirty nine millions of Dollars) the amount of the funded debt contracted in consequence of the war, (sixty four millions of Dollars) and the amount of the unfunded and floating debt (including the various issues of Treasury notes) Seventeen millions of Dollars, which is in a gradual course of payment. There will, probably, be some addition to the public debt, upon the liquidation of various claims, which are depending; and a conciliatory disposition on the part of Congress, may lead, honorably and advantageously, to an equitable arrangement of the militia Expences, incurred by the Several states, without the previous sanction, or authority, of the Government of the United States: But when it is considered, that the new, as well as the old, portion of the debt has been contracted in the assertion of the national rights and independence; and when it is recollected, that the public expenditures, not being exclusively, bestowed upon subjects of a transient nature, will long be visible in the number and equipments of the American navy, in the military works for the defence of our harbours and our frontiers, and in the supplies of our arsenals and magazines; the amount will bear a gratifying comparison with the objects which have been attained, as well as with the resources of the country.  
The arrangement of the finances, with a view to the receipts and expenditures of a permanent peace establishment, will necessarily enter into the deliberations of Congress, during the present Session. It is true, that the improved condition of the public revenue will not only afford, the means of maintaining the faith of Government with its Creditors inviolate, and of prosecuting successfully the measures of the most liberal policy, but will, also, justify an immediate alleviation of the burthens imposed by the necessities of the war. It is, however, essential to every modification of the finances, that the benefits of an uniform national currency should be restored to the community. The absence of the precious metals will, it is beleived, be a temporary evil; but until they can again be rendered the general medium of Exchange, it devolves on the Wisdom of Congress, to provide a substitute, which shall equally engage the confidence, and accomodate the wants, of the Citizens throughout the Union. If the operation of the State Banks, cannot produce this result, the probable operation of a National Bank will merit consideration; and if neither of these expedients be deemed effectual, it may become necessary to ascertain the terms, upon which the notes of the Government (no longer required as an instrument  
  
of Credit) shall be issued, upon motives of general policy, as a common medium of circulation.  
Notwithstanding the security for future repose which the United States, ought to find in their love of peace, and their constant respect for the rights of other nations, the Character of the times, particularly inculcates the lesson, that whether to prevent or repel danger, we ought not to be unprepared for it. This consideration will sufficiently recommend to Congress, a liberal provision for the immediate extension and gradual completion of the works of defence both fixed and floating, on our maritime frontier; and an adequate provision for guarding our inland frontier, against dangers to which certain portions of it may continue to be exposed.  
As an improvement in our military establishment; it will deserve the Consideration of Congress whether a Corps of Invalids might not be so organized and employed, as at once to aid in the support of meritorious individuals excluded by age or infirmities from the existing establishment, and to procure to the public the benefit of their stationary services, and of their exemplary discipline. I recommend also an enlargement of the military Academy already established, and the establishment of others in other sections of the union. And I cannot press too much on the attention of Congress, such a classification and organization of the militia as will most effectually render it the safeguard of a free State. If experience has shewn in the recent splendid atcheivements of militia, the value of this resource for the public defence, it has shewn also the importance of that skill in the use of arms, and that familiarity with the essential rules of discipline, which cannot be expected from the regulations now in force. With this subject is intimately connected the necessity of accomodating the laws in every respect to the great object, of enabling the political authority of the Union, to employ promptly and effectually the physical power of the union, in the cases designated by the Constitution.  
The Signal Services which have been rendered by our navy, and the capacities it has developed for successful co-operation in the national defence, will give to that portion of the public force, its full value in the eyes of Congress, at an epoch which calls for the constant vigilance of all Governments. To preserve the ships, now in a sound state; to compleat those already contemplated; to provide amply the imperishable materials for prompt augmentations; and to improve the existing arrangements, into more advantageous establishments, for the construction, the repairs, and the security of vessels of War, is dictated by the soundest policy.  
In adjusting the duties on imports, to the object of revenue, the influence of the tariff on manufactures, will necessarily present itself for consideration. However wise the Theory may be, which leaves to the sagacity and interest of individuals, the application of their industry and resources, there are in this, as in other cases, exceptions to the general rule. Besides  
  
the condition which the Theory itself implies, of a reciprocal adoption, by other nations, experience teaches, that so many circumstances must concur, in introducing and maturing manufacturing establishments, especially of the more complicated kinds, that a country may remain long without them, although sufficiently advanced, and in some respects even peculiarly fitted, for carrying them on with success. Under Circumstances giving a powerful impulse to manufacturing industry, it has made among us a progress, and exhibited an efficiency, which justify the beleif, that with a protection not more than is due to the enterprizing Citizens whose interests are now at stake, it will become, at an early day, not only safe against occasional competitions from abroad, but a source of domestic wealth, and even of external commerce. In selecting the branches more especially entitled to the public patronage, a preference is obviously claimed by such as will releive the United States from a dependence on foreign supplies, ever subject to casual failures, for articles necessary for the public defence, or connected with the primary wants of individuals. It will be an additional recommendation of particular manufactures, where the materials for them are extensively drawn from our agriculture, and consequently, impart and ensure to that great fund of national prosperity and independence, an encouragement which cannot fail to be rewarded.  
Among the means of advancing the public interest, the occasion is a proper one for recalling the attention of Congress, to the great importance of establishing throughout our country, the roads and Canals which can best be executed, under the national Authority. No objects within the circle of political economy, so richly repay the expence bestowed on them; there are none, the utility of which is more universally ascertained &amp; acknowledged; none that do more honor to the Governments, whose wise and enlarged patriotism duly appreciates them. Nor is there any country which presents a field, where nature invites more the art of man, to compleat her own work, for his accomodation and benefit. These considerations are strengthened, moreover, by the political effect of these facilities for intercommunication, in bringing and binding more closely together, the various parts of our extended confederacy. Whilst the states individually, with a laudable enterprize &amp; emulation, avail themselves of their local advantages, by new roads, by navigable Canals, and by improving the streams susceptible of navigation, the general Government is the more urged to similar undertakings, requiring a national jurisdiction, and national means, by the prospect of thus systematically completing so inestimable a work. And it is a happy reflection, that any defect of constitutional authority, which may be encountered, can be supplied in a mode, which the constitution itself has providently pointed out.  
The present is a favorable season also, for bringing again into view, the establishment of a national seminary of learning within the District of  
  
Columbia, and with means drawn from the property therein subject to the authority of the general Government: Such an Institution claims the patronage of Congress, as a monument of their solicitude for the advancement of knowledge, without which the blessings of liberty cannot be fully enjoyed, or long preserved; as a model, instructive in the formation of other Seminaries; as a nursery of enlightened preceptors; &amp; as a central resort of youth and genius from every part of their Country, diffusing, on their return, examples of those national feelings, those liberal sentiments, and those congenial manners, which contribute cement to our union, and strength to the great political Fabric, of which that is the foundation.  
In closing this communication, I ought not to repress a sensibility in which you will unite, to the happy lot of our Country, and to the goodness of a Superintending providence, to which we are indebted for it. Whilst other portions of mankind are labouring under the distresses of war, or struggling with adversity in other forms, the United States are in the tranquil enjoyment of prosperous and honorable peace. In reviewing the scenes through which it has been attained, we can rejoice in the proofs given, that our political institutions, founded in human rights, and framed for their preservation, are equal to the severest trials of war, as well as adapted to the ordinary periods of repose. As fruits of this experience, and of the reputation acquired by the American Arms, on the land and on the water, the nation finds itself possessed of a growing respect abroad, and of a just confidence in itself, which are among the best pledges, for its peaceful career. Under other aspects of our Country, the strongest features of its flourishing condition are seen, in a population rapidly increasing, on a territory as productive as it is extensive; in a general industry, and fertile ingenuity, which find their ample rewards; and in an affluent revenue, which admits a reduction of the public burdens, without withdrawing the means of sustaining the public credit, of gradually discharging the public debt, of providing for the necessary defensive &amp; precautionary establishments, and of patronizing, in every authorised mode, undertakings conducive to the aggregate wealth and individual comfort of our Citizens.  
It remains for the guardians of the public welfare, to persevere in that justice &amp; good will towards other nations, which invite a return of these Sentiments towards the United States; to cherish Institutions, which guarantee their safety, and their liberties Civil and religious; and to combine with a liberal system of foreign commerce, an improvement of the natural advantages, and a protection and extension of the Independent resources, of our highly favored and happy Country.  
In all measures having such objects, my faithful co-operation will be afforded.

I have the satisfaction, on our present  
meeting, of being able to communkab  
ioyou the successful termination of thu  
[war which had been eomnieincad -against  
LfHe United State* by the Regency of Al­  
giers. The squadron in advance, ni­  
that Service, under Commodore Deca  
tur, lost not a moment after its arrival \t  
the Mediterranean in seeking the naval  
force of the enemy, then cruising in that

bis ship*, one of them the principal ship,  
commanded by the Algerine Admiral.  
The high character of the/ America ni  
commander waabrilliantly sustained on  
the occasion, which brought his own  
ship into close action with that ofhisad­  
versary | ah was. the accustomed gal­  
lantry of all the officer* and men actually  
engaged. Having prepared the way by  
this demonstration of American skill and  
prowess, he hastened to the port ©f Al­  
giers, where peace was promptly yielded  
to bis victorious force. In the terms  
stipulated, the right* and honor of the  
United States were particularly consult­  
ed, by a perpetual relinquishment on the  
part of the Dey ot all pretension* to tri­  
bute from them. The impression* which  
have thus been made, strengthened as  
they will have been, by subsequent  
transaction* with the Regencies of Tunis  
and Tripoli, by the appearance of thf»  
larger force, which followed under Com-,  
modore Bainbrdee, the chief in coio­  
  
mand of the expedition, and by the ju­  
dicious precautionary arrangements left  
by him tn that quarter, afford a reasona­  
ble prospect of future security, for the  
valuable portioi of our commerce, which  
passes within reach of the Barbary  
cruisers.  
It is another source of satisfaction that  
the treaty of peace writh Great-Britain  
has been succeeded by a convention op  
the subject of commerce, concluded by  
the Plenipotentiaries of the two coun­  
tries. In this result a disposition i*  
manifested on the part of that nation,  
corresponding with the disposition of the  
United States* which, it may be hoped,  
will be improved into liberal arrange­  
ments on other subjects, on which the  
parties have mutual Interests, or which  
might endanger their future harmony.  
Congress will decide on the expediency  
of promoting such a sequel, by giving  
effect to the measure of confining the  
American navigation to American sea­  
men ; a measure which, at the same time  
that it might have that conciliatory ten­  
dency, would have the further advan­  
tage of increasing the independence of  
our navigation, and the resources for our  
maritime defe&#x27;nce.  
In con fori fry with the articles of the  
Treaty of Ghent relating to the Indians,  
as well as with a view to the tranquility  
of our Western and North Western  
frontiers, measures were taken to es­  
tablish an immediate peact with the  
several tribes who had been engaged in  
hostilities against the United States.—  
Such of them as were invited to Detroit  
acceded readily to a renewal of the  
former treaties of friendship. Of the  
other tribes who w ere invited to a station  
on the Mississippi, the greater number  
have also accented the peace offered to  
  
them the residue, consisting ot the moie  
distant Tribes or parts of Tribes remain  
to be brought ever by farther explana­  
tions, or by such other neans as may be  
adapted to tho disposition they may  
finally disclose.  
The Indian Tribes within and bor­  
dering on our Southern frontier, whom  
a cruel war on their part, had compelled  
us to chastise into peace, have latterly  
shewn a restleness, which has eaiied  
for preparatory measurei for revising  
it, and for protecting the commissioners  
engaged in carrying the terms of the  
peace into execution. . ,  
t he execution of the act for fixing the  
military peace establishment has been  
attended with difficulties, which even  
now can only be overcome by legislative  
aid. The selection of officers; the pay­  
ment and discharge of the troops enlist­  
ed for the w ar; the paymeot of the re­  
tained troops, and their re-union from  
detached%nd distant stations; the col­  
lection and security of the public pro  
ne, ty, in the Quarter-Master, Commis­  
sary&quot;, and Ordnance Departments;  
and the constant medical assistance re­  
quired in hospitals and garrisons, ren­  
dered a complete execution of the att  
impracticable ion the first of May, the  
H?riod more immediately contemplated;  
As soon, however, as circumstance*  
would permit, and as far as it has been  
practicable, consistently with the publx  
interests, the reduction of the army lit*  
oeen accomplished : but the appropria­  
tions its pay, and for other branches  
of tM military service, having proved  
inadequate, the earliest attention to that  
subject will be necessary ; and the ex­

I h ive the satisfaction, o.i &lt; ur present  
meeting, ol being able to commune ale to  
you Uie successful termination t f the war  
which had been commenced against the  
United States by the Regency of Algk rs.—  
The si]uadron in ndvan e on that servic*,  
undo? Cam. 1) caitir. lost not a moment  
after its arrival ;n u-c Medit r on an, m  
seeking the naval f&gt;rce oft .e troemr, t cn  
cruising in that sea. am! succeed din n;:­  
turing tv/o iflrs sb ps, on-, of !:?m the  
principc.l ship.r.cinmnn ed by the Algerine  
Admiral. Tlie high haracter of the A­  
meiicsn commander, was brii.i nllv sns­  
tained cn the occasion, win. Ii brought his  
own ship into close action with that of his  
adversary, as w as the accustomc-: gallant­  
ry of all the t-fiir.ers ..ml men ac.u illy en­  
gaged. Having prepared th - way by this  
demonstration of American skill and prow­  
&#x27;s?, he hastened to the p -vt of Algiers,  
wnt-re pence was promptly yielded to his  
victorious foice. In the terns stipulated,  
the rights and honor of the United States  
  
uni relinquishment, on tV p it of the 1) y,  
of pretensions to tribute from Hum.—  
&#x27;I&#x27;lie impressions which hivu thus been  
made, strengthened as they will have been  
by subs ‘quent lansictions with the reg n­  
r.irs of Tunis and Tripoli, by the appear­  
ance of the larger force which followed, un­  
der Gom. Baiubridg-, the chi f in com­  
mand of the expedition, and by the  
jucl»c ions precautionary art ngcmrr.ts left  
by him in that guar er, afford a reasona­  
ble prospect of fu’ure srcur.ty, f -r the va­  
luahle portion of our cotntn rce, which. pas­  
ses within reach of the It rbary cruisers.  
It is anotlicr source of satisfaction that  
the treaty ot peace with G. Britain lus  
been succeeded by a|Conventioa on the sub­  
ject of commerce, concluded by the pieni­  
potent series of the two countries. In this  
result, a disposition is manifested on the  
part of that nation, corresponding with ih&quot;  
dispos-tiun of tlie U. Stat which, it may be  
hoped, will be improved into liberal ar­  
rangements on other subjects, on whi. h the  
parties have rr.ntua.1 interests, or which  
might endanger their future harmony. Con­  
gress will decide on the expediency of pro­  
moting such a sequel, by giving effe t to the  
measure of confining the American naviga­  
tion to American seamen ; a measure  
which, at the same t; ne that it might h. ve  
hat conci i-itory tendency, would have the  
further advantage cf increasing the indt­  
pendence of our navrg iti m, and tbe resour­  
ces for our maritime defence.  
In conformity with the article&#x27;s of the  
treaty &lt; f Ghent, relating to the Indians, as  
well as with a view to the tranquility of  
our western and&#x27;north-westem fr ntiers,  
measurrs were token to establish on imme­  
d ate peace with the several tr bis v.ho had  
b-en engaged in hostilities against the IJ.  
States. Such of them as were invited to  
Detroit, acceded readily to a renew&#x27;d of  
the former treaties of friendship. Of the  
other trib s who were invited to a station  
on the Mississippi,the greater number have  
also accepted 0f the peace off red to them.  
—The residue consisting of the more dls­  
tvnt tri!&gt;cs or parts of tribes, remain to be  
brought over by further expl ’.nations, or by  
- ucn otb r rrea s as may be adapted to the  
disposition they may finally disclose.  
”1 he Indi n tr.bes within, and bordering  
on our south i n frontier, whom a cnr-1 war  
on their p rt had compelled us to chastise  
into peace, have la&#x27;tcrly shewn a restless­  
ness, which has culled for prep irat ry  
measures f-r repressing it, and for protect  
ing the commissioners engaged in carrying  
the &#x27;erm- ot the peace into exc&lt; ution.  
The execution of the Act for fixing the  
mi ita y peace estaM shment, lias been at­  
tended vv th difficult cs which even row  
t an only be overco ne bv legislative aid_

ancl tlie constant medical assistance requir*  
e • in hospitals and garrisons, rendered  
a complete execution of the act impractir.­  
®b!e on the fu st of May, the period more  
immedi t ly contemplated. As soon, how  
ever, as cir umstanccs would p rmit, and  
as far as it has hcen practicable, consist­  
ently with the pub ic. interests, the r. no­  
tion of the army has been accumpl shed ;  
but t .e appn pi unions for its pay, . mi fer  
other branches of the military * rvice hav­  
ing proved inadequate, the earliest att&#x27; n­  
tir-nto that subject wili be nece.sary ; and  
the expediency of continu r.g up ,n the  
peace esUblislMTKnt, the tall offi. era who  
have h.therto he n proviso naliy retained,  
is also r. commended to the cons d rat.on of  
C-ongr s%  
In the performance of the executive du­  
ty upon tins occasion, there hi*.s not been  
wanting a just sensibility to the meiits of  
the American army, during the late war;  
but the obvious pol cy ai.cl design in fix ng  
an efficient military jieace establish­  
ment, did net aflhrd an opportunity to dis­  
tinguish the egul nil inhim, on account of  
tht i past services ; nor the wounded and  
disabled, on account of their present stiff r­  
n gs. The extent of the r&gt; duct on indeed  
unavoidably Involved the cX&#x27; lurion of many  
mcritori&#x27; us officers* f every rink, from the  
service of their com try ; and so equal, r.s  
well as so nun emus, were the claims to  
attention, that a decision by the standard  
ol comparative merit, could seldom be nt  
tain&#x27;-*&#x27;, Judged, however,In candor, by :*  
general rtandnrd of positive ten t, the Ar  
* v It g&#x27; ,t-r will, it is believed, do honor  
to t.icestablishment ; while the case of  
iho#j officers, whose names kre not iuciud  
  
c ’ in it, devolves, w?th the strongest Inter­  
est, upon the legisl tive authority, for such  
p&#x27; ovision as shall he deemed the best cal­  
culated to give support and sol &gt;ce to the  
veteran and invali I ; to display the betiefi­

The arrangement of the finances, with a  
view to the receipts and expenditures i f a  
permanent peace establishment, will ne­  
cessarily enter into the deliberations cf  
Congress during the present session. It  
is true that the improve ! condition of  
the public revenue will not only afford  
the means of maintaining the faith of th­  
government, with its creditors inviolate,  
• ml of prosecuting, swccesTully, tlie  
measurrs of the cost li e al policy_  
Out v.i l, also, justify an immediate allevi .­  
tion of ti e burthens impose d by the neces­  
si ics of the war. It i.s, however, e o,ential  
to every modification of the finances, that  
the ben fits of an unif- ran national currency  
should be ivstored to the communi’y. Tne  
abs nee of the precious metals will, it is  
lie ieved, be a temp. vary evil ; but until  
th y can l e ag in rci dt nd the general  
medium ofexchang.*, it devolves on the  
wisd in of Congress, to provide a substitute  
which shall ecju illy engage the confidence,  
and accmi.no late the wants of the cit.zens  
throughout the union. It the operation of  
the st-te Banks cannot pr-du e this re­  
sult, the probable operation of a National  
  
n uik w It merit cotsuk-rati- n ; and if nr i­  
tlicr of these expedients be deemed effec­  
tual, it m y become iu c Esary to nscert -n  
the terms upon which toe not* s of the go­  
vernm n , (no longer required as an instru­  
ment of credit) slia’.l be issued, upon mo­  
tives of g neral pol cy, as a common me­  
dium of circulation.  
Notwithstanding the security for future  
repose, w Inch the United Sta’&lt; s ought to  
find in their lovu of pea^c &amp; their cuts!ant  
rep-ct for tli • r gilts of oth* r nations, t&#x27; e  
character cl the times particularly inrul­  
cates the less n. that, whether to prevent j  
or to repel danger, we ought not to be un­  
prep iredfo*- it. This consideration wid  
mi flic: ntly recommend to Congress a ii­

in eaptcring two of kis steps, one of them the

miral. The high eh-raeter of the American  
commander was hiillistt ly sustained on the net-u­

Th“ impressions which have thus been mode,  
strengthened as they will have been, by snb«e­

nartieulmrly incul-iites (he less-in, thut, whether  
to proven! nr rep«| danger, we ought not to be

n»e of anus, oud that fauuiir. .ity with the iss|u­  
tml rules of discipline, a hick cannot he expected  
from the regulations now iu foice. Willi this  
subject is intimately connected the necessity of  
accommodating the taws, in every respect, to the  
great ot*j*et of enabling the political authority cf  
the urnik/, to employ, promptly and effectually,  
the pbisical power of the union, iu tho coats de­

fbe signal services which have been rendered  
by our i) vy, cud tbe r. parities it hud developed  
for sueeessrul c.o-bperution iu the uatinuul defence,  
will give to that portion of the public force, its  
full value id tbe eyes of Congress, at an epoch  
which culls for the const&amp;ut vigilance of ail go­  
vernments. To preserve the ships now in a  
sound state ; to romplete those airesdy contem­  
plated ; to provide amply the uupciishuble ma­  
ce.is!.* for p,&#x27;inept augmentations, and to improve  
the existing arrangements into more udvautageovs  
establishments, for the construction, the repairs,  
and the security of vessels o! w ar, is dictated by  
the soundest policy.  
In adjusting the duties on imports, to the ob­  
ject of tbe revenue, the influence of the tariff on  
manufacture*, will necessarily present itself for  
consideration. However wise the theoiy may  
be, which Icavrs to the sagacity and interest of  
individuals the application of their industry and

irom Pennsylvania, Mr. Irwin : from Ma­  
ryland, Mr. Uaer ; from Virginia, Messrs.  
Shelley, Johnson, Kerr: from North Caro­  
lina Messrs. Gn.s^i and Forney.  
Noother business was done than read­  
ing tin* President’s Message : ot which five  
thousand copies were ordered tq he print­  
ed for the use of thft house, and one thou­  
sand for the use of the Senate.  
r &#x27;/&#x27;/us day, at 12 o&#x27;clock, the J* re title nt of the U  
States transmitted to both /Tonnes of Consrress the  
folloxang Message, by Jtfr. Todd, his Secretary .  
Fellow-Oitirens of the Senate  
and of the House of Represcot ives:  
I have the satisfaction, on our present meeting  
of bding able to communicate to you the success -  
ful termination of the w.ir uiiidi had been com­  
menced against the United States b&gt;s the Regency  
of Algiers. The squadron in advance on that  
  
£n-ivu.c, ufiucr i/jmiiiouo e IJtcatiir, lost not u  
moment after his arrival in the Mediterranean in  
seeking the tutval force of the enemy, then cruis­  
ing in that sea ; and succeeded in rapturing two  
of his ships, one of them the principal ship, com­  
manded by the Algerine V.lm ral. The high  
character of thcrAir,|irican commander was bril­  
liantly sustained on die occasion, wh ch brought  
his own ship into close action with that of his ad­  
vdrsijry ; as was the accustomed gallantry of all  
the officers and men actually eng.-ged. Having  
prepared the way by this demonstration of Ame­  
rican skill and prowess, lie hastened to the port of  
Algiers, where peace was promptly yielded to his  
victorious force. In the terms stipulated, the  
rights and honor of the United States were par­  
ticularly consulted, by a perpetual relinquish­  
ment on the part of the Dey of all pretensions to  
tribute from them., The impressions which have  
thus been math-, strengthened as they will h#ve  
been, by subsequent transactions With the lie­  
gencitf.* of Tunis and Tripoli, by the appe.u ance  
of the larger force, which followed under Com­  
modore Rainbridgr, the chief in command of the  
expedition, and by the jud.cious precautionary  
arrangements left by him in that quarter, afford  
n reasonable prospect of future security, for the  
valuable portion of our conimrce, which passes  
v.&#x27;.thin reach of the Barbary cruisers.  
It is another source of satisfaction that the  
treaty of peace with Cre.t Britni* has been suc­  
ceeded by a convention on the subject of com­  
merce, concluded by the Plenipotentiaries of the  
two countries. In this result a disposition is mani­  
fested on the part of that nation, corresponding  
with the disposition of the United States, which  
it may be hoped, will he improved into liberal ar­  
rangements on other subjects, on which the par­  
ties have mutual interests, or which might endan­  
ger their future harmony. Congress will decide  
on the expediency of promoting such a sequel, by  
giving effect to the measure of confining the A­  
nierican nxvigv.iiun to American seamen ; a mea­  
sure which, at the same tune that it might have  
that conciliatory tendency, would have the further  
advantage of increasing the independence of our  
navigation, and the resources for our maritime  
• defence.  
In conformity with the articles of the Treaty  
of Client relating to the Indians, as well as with  
*a view to the tranquility of our Western and  
Korth Western frontiers, measures were taken  
to establish an immediate peace with the several  
Iribes who had been engaged in hostilities against  
the United States.—Such of them as were invited  
to Detrrrt acceded readily to a renewal of the for­  
mer treat ca of friendship. Of the otbec tribes  
who were invited to a station on the Mississippi,  
the greater number have aho ucccpteo the peace  
offered to them. The re^due, consisting of the  
more distant Tribes or parts of Tribes, remain to  
be brought over, by farther explan; tions, or by  
such.other means as may be adapted to the dis­  
position they may finally disposition they may  
finally disclose.  
The Indian Tribes within and bordering on our  
Southern frontier, whom a cruel War, on their  
fiart, had compelled us to chastise into pence, have  
atterly shewn a restlessness, which has called  
for preparatory measures for repressing it, and  
for protecting the commissioners engaged car­  
rying the terms of the peace into execution.  
Thfe execution of the Act for fixingtbe military,  
peace establishment has been attended with dif­  
ficulties, which even now can only be overcome  
by legislative aid. 1 iieelcction of officers ; the  
payment and discharge of the troops enlisted tor  
the war; the payment of the retained troops, and  
their re-union from detached and distant f at ions ;  
the collection ar.il security of the public pro­  
perty, in the Quarter-Master, Comnussry, and  
■Ordnance lJppertinents ; and the constant me­  
dical assistance required in hosp.’uls and gam  
sons, rendered a c */npl«te execution of the act  
impracticable on t.ie first of May, the period  
more immediately contemplated. As torn, how­  
ever, as circumstances would permit, and as far  
as it has been practicable, consistently with the  
public interesti, the reduction of the army has  
been accomplished : but the appropr alums for  
its pav, and for other branches of the military ser­  
vice, having proved inadequate, tlie earliest at­  
tention to thaisuhiect will be necessary ; and the  
  
expediency of continuing upon tlie peace esta­  
blishment the staff officers, who have hitherto  
been provisionally retained, is also recommended  
lathe consideration ofcongress.  
In the performance of the executive duty upon  
this occasion, these has not been wanting a just  
sensibility to the merits of the American army,  
during the late war : but the obv.ftus policy mul  
design in fixing an efficient military peace esta­  
blishment, did not afiord an opponuniiy to dis­  
tinguish the aged and infirm, on account of their  
past service, nor the wounded and disabl d, on  
account of their present sufferings. Tlie extent  
of the reduction, indi ed. unavoidably involved  
the exclusion ot many meritorious officers.of eve­  
ry rank from the service of their country 5 and so  
erpial,ns well as so numerous, were the claim- to  
attention, that a derision by life standard of com­  
parative merit cmfid seldom be attained Judged  
however, in candor, ey a general standard of posi­  
tive merit, the Aimy Ilcgistc.r WiH, it&#x27;is believed,  
do honor to tlie establishment ; while th ; case of  
those officers,whose names arc not included in n,  
devolves, witii the strongest interest, upon the  
legislative authority, for such provision, as shall  
be deemed tin- best* calculated to give support ?»  
solace to the veteran and invalid , to display the  
beneficence, as well the justice ol the government  
tmd to inspire a martial /.eal for the public nevice,  
upon evrty luiore •suyvgeiKy.  
Although tins . scents arising from the  
want of an uniform national currency has &lt;. n«l  
been diminished, since the adjournment of C »«­  
gress, great mitit faction lias hern Ici iveii m c u»­  
templai’ing the revival of the public cred.t, an 1  
the efficiency of the public, resources. The re­  
ceipts into the treasury, frwmthe various branches  
of revenue, during the time months ending •. n toe  
flQth of September last, h»ve been estimated m,  
twelve miliums and a half of dollars; the inane*  
crfTre.isury Nnte&#x27;s&gt;of every denomination, ^ iring  
the ssme period, amounted to tlie sum of four­  
teen millions of dollars s an.l there Wgs, aUo, ob  
tainedjipon loan, during the same period, a sum  
frt nme million!. of dollars s of efhich Use sum oi  
six mdl.ont of dollars &#x27;Vas fnbserihed in cash,  
and iie »(im of three m U.ons of dollars in Tre*  
sury Notes. With these means, added to the sum  
of one million bf ihdiars, be.ng the balance 01  
money in the Treasury on tlie first of January,  
there has been prod between the first of Jamjar)  
  
and the lir*t of October, on account of the ap­  
propriations ofthe preceding an»l the present year  
(exclusively ofthe amount of the Treasury Votes  
snbscnlied to the loan, and the amount redeem­  
ed in the payment of duties ami taxes) the aggre  
gate auin of tlnrty-thiee millions and a half of  
dollars, leaving a balance then in the Treasury  
estimated *t tire sum of three millions of dollars  
ln&lt;le|&gt;eo&lt;!enr, however, of the arrearages due for  
military-.Crvit • s and supplies, it is presumed,  
that a further sum of live millions of dollars, in­  
eluding the interest on the public debt payable on  
the first of January next, will be demanded a*  
the Treasury to complete the expenditures ofthe  
present year, arid for which the existing ways &amp;  
means will suHicie »tly provide.  
The national debt, as it&#x27;was ascertained on  
the first of Octolrer last, amounted in the whole  
to the sum of one hundred *and twenty millio is of  
dollars, consisting 9!&quot; the imretleeine l balance of  
the debt contracted licflirc the war, (thirty-nine  
millions of dollars) she amount of the funded  
debt, contracted in consequence of the war, (s:x­  
ty-fonr millions of dqlla s,) and the amount ofthe  
unfunded and floating debp (including tbe var.­  
011s issues of Treasury Notes) seventeen millions  
of dollars, winch is in a gradual course of pay­  
ment. There will, probably be some addition to  
the public debt, upon the liquidation of various  
•daims which are depend ng; and a conciliatory  
digiosiliim on the part of Congress may lead, ho­  
norably and advantageously, to an equitable ar-|  
rangemciU of the militia expences, incurred by ]  
the several stales. Without the previous sanction■  
  
or auuMjruv oi me government cu me umcca  
States. But, when it is considered that the new  
:h well as the* old portion of the debt has been  
contracted in the assertion of the national rights  
and independence ; and when it is recollected1  
that tlie public expenditures, not being exclu­  
sively lustowed up n subjects of a transient na­  
ture, w.ll long lie visible n the number and e-\
qiupnients of the American navy, in the mdituv,  
works for tlie d -fence of our harbors and our  
frontiers, and in the supplies of our arsenals and  
magazines ; the amount will bear a gratifying  
comparison with the objects which have been at­  
tained, as well as with the resources of the coun­  
ty-.  
The arrangement of tlie finances, with a view  
to the receipts and expenditures of a permanent  
peace estahl shmeht, will necessarily enter into  
j the deliberations of Congress, during the pre­  
sent session. It is true that the improved con  
dition of the public revenue will not only affor 1  
the means of maintaining the faith of tlie govern­  
ment with its creditor- inviolate, anil of prosecu­  
ting, successfully, the me..Mires of the most li­  
| beral policy ; but will, also, justify an iinmcdi­  
z.e alleviation of the burthens imposed by the ne­  
cessities of the war. It is, however, essential t&gt;  
every modification of the finances, that t|*^ bene  
fits of an uniform national currency should be  
restored to tlie community. The absence of the  
precious metals will, it is believed, be a tpmpora­  
ry evil ; but until they can be again rendered  
tlie general medium of excltanyr, ;t devolves on  
the wisdom of Congress, to .&#x27;provide a substitute  
which shall equally engugo the confidence, aryl  
accommodate the Wants of the citizens through  
mil the union. If the opperation of tlie state  
Banks cannot produce th.» result, the probable  
operation ot a ^rational Bank w.ll merit conside­  
ration ; and, if neither of these expedients be  
deemed cilectual, it may become necessary to as­  
certain the terms, upop which the notes of tiie  
government, no longer required as an instrument  
of credit shall be issued, upon motives of geuer  
ral policy, as a comm a med.um of circuLmn.  
N’otw thstandirg tiiq security for future fepose  
which the United .States ought to find m the.r  
love of peace, and tbnr constant rc pcci for the  
i rights of other na ions, the character of tlie time;  
| particularly inculcates the lesson, that whether  
Uo prevent or repeUlunger, we ought n«t t&lt;» be  
mprepai eU f ir it. Tins VJrHi-&#x27;deration will suffi­  
ciently recommend to (Jnngt ess :i liberal provisi­  
on tor tlie immediate extcu.-io i uul gradual com­  
pletion of the works of defence, both fixed ami  
fiuatiiig, on otu- ir&gt;a i ime JroiUier; and an afi  
equate provision for guarding our inland fron­  
icr, against tlangers to which certain portions  
of it may continue to be exposed.  
As an improvement on our military establish­  
ment, it will deserve the cen-nid ation of C in­  
gress whether a corps of invalids might not he  
so organiz.-d and employed, asat once toad in  
the support of meritorious individuals, excluded  
by age or infirmities from the existing establish­  
ment, and to preserve to the public tlie benefit of  
the.r stationary services, and of the r exeinpla y  
disc pline. I recommend also an enlargement o‘  
the military academy already established, jtvl -.lie  
establishment of others in oUier sections of the  
union. And&#x27;! cann it press t&lt;*&gt; much on the at  
tention of Con^re-.s, such a classification and or­  
ganization of tlie militia, .is w.ll most cUcctmll .

rience has shewn m the l.»te splend.d achieve­  
ments of militia, the value of th^i resource for the  
publ.c defence^ it has shewn also the importance  
of that sk.ll in the use of arms, and that familiari­  
ty with the cssentiij rule* of discipline, drliich  
cannot be expected fropi the regulations now m

respect, to t^e great object of enabling the poli­  
tieal authority of tlie union ty employ, promptly  
and effectualiy, the physical power of he union,v  
pi the ci. cs designated by the constitution.  
  
The signalserv.ces which have been rendered  
by our navy, and the capacities it has developed  
for successful cooperation in the nationaldeiince,  
will give to that portion of viie public force its full  
value in the eyes of Congress, at an epoch winch  
calls for the constant vig lance of ail governments.  
To preserve the ships now in i». sound state; to  
complete those already coulepiphucd ; In provide

gmentations, ami to improve the existing arrao­  
gemcmsimo more adv aitUgcms establishments,  
lor rhecir.istruc ion, the repairs, and the security  
of vessels of war, is dictated by the soundest po­  
licy.  
Ill adjusting the duties of imports, to  
the object of revenue, the influence of the  
t.frifT&lt;»fi OiAiiuflCtUics will necessarily pre­  
sent itself for consideration. However  
wise the theory in.ty be, which leaves to  
the sagacity and interest of individuals the  
application of their iudustry and resources,  
there are in this, as&#x27;in other cases, excep­  
tions to the general rule. Kesides the con­  
dition which the theory itself implicit, of a  
reciprocal adoption t»y uihor nations,expe­  
rience teaches that so many circuimanocs  
must accor in introducing aid maturing  
manufacturin&#x27;:; cstVd aliments, especially  
of tha more conrplicated kinds, that a  
country may remain long without them, al­  
though solftctQrttly advanced, and in some  
respects even peculiarly lilted for carrying  
them on with success. Under circumstau­  
ces giving a powerful impulse to manufac­  
turing industry, it has made among us a  
I &gt;r ogress, and exhibited an efficiency,  
wihch justify the belief, that with a protec­  
tion n »1 in »re than is due to the enterpris­  
ing ciliwus whose interests are now ,it  
stake, it will hreume, at^in early day, not  
only safe Against occasion&#x27;d com petitions  
from abroad, but a source of domestic  
wealth, and even of external commerce.—  
In selecting the uranches more especially  
entitled ti the public patronage,*apifilef*  
  
en« e is obviously claimed by such as wil  
-relieve the United States from a depend  
ence on foreign supplies, ever subject t(  
casual failures, for articles necessary foi  
the public defence, or connected with the  
primary wants of individuals. It will Ik  
an additional recommendation of particu­  
lar manufactures, where the materials for  
them are extensively drawn from our agri­  
culture, and consequent! v impart ami en­  
; spre, to that great fund of national prosperi­  
ty and independence, an encouragement  
which cannot tail to be rewarded.  
Among the means of advancing the pub­  
lic interne, the occasion is a proper one for  
recalling the attention of Congress to the  
[great importance of establishing through­  
out our country the road* and canals which  
can be best executed, under the national  
authority. No objects within the circle of  
political economy, so richly repay the ex­  
pence bestowed on them ; there arc none,  
the utility ot which is more universally as­  
certained and acknowledged ; none that do  
more honor to the government, whose wise  
and enlarged patriotism duly appreciates  
them. Nor is there any country Which  
presents a field, whe**e Nature invite­  
more the art of man to complete, her own  
work fur his accommodation and benefit.—  
These considerations are strengthened,  
moreover, by the political ** fleet of these fa­  
cilities f»r intercommunication, in bringing  
and binding more closely t.jgether the vari­  
ous parts ol our extended confederacy.—  
Whilst the states, individually, with a lau­  
dable enterprise and emulation, avail  
theinselvfcs of their local advantages, by  
new roads, by navigable Canals, and by  
improving the streams susceptible of navi­  
gation, the general government is the more  
urged to similar undertakings, requiring a  
national jurisdiction, and national means,  
by the prospect o thus systematically com­  
pleting so inestimable a work. And it is a  
happy reflection, that any defect of consti  
tutiooal authority, which may be encoun­  
tered, can be supplied in a mode, which the  
constitution itself has providently pointed  
  
out. •,  
lTie present is a favorable season, also,  
for bringing again into view the establish­  
ment ot a national seminary of learning  
within the District of Columbia, and with  
means drawn from the property therein  
subject to the authority of the general go­  
vernment. Such an institution claims tip­  
patronage of Congress, as a in mu ncut o&#x27;  
their solicitude tor toe advancement o&#x27;  
knowledge, without which, the blessings of  
liberty cannot be fully enjoyed, or long  
preserved j as a model instructive in tin­  
formation of other seminaries: as a nursery  
o( enlightened preceptors : and as a central  
resort of youth and genius from every part  
of their country, diffusing on their return  
e samples of those national feelings, those  
liberal sentiments, and those coiigeniu  
manners, which contribute cement toon  
union and strength to the great politica  
fabric, of which that is the formation.  
In closing this communication, I ou;’  
not to repress a sensibility, in which yon  
will unite, t;&gt; the happy I at ol our country,  
I and to the goodness ot a superinlen din  
-Providence to which we are indebted for it  
Whilst other portions of mankind are la  
boriujg under the distresses of war, 01  
struggling with adversity in other forms,  
tie united States are in the tranquil enjoy­  
ment of prosperous and honorable peace,  
in reviewing the*scenes through which it  
has been attained, we can rejoice in the  
proof-, given, thatour political institutions,  
founded in human rights, and framed fo  
their preservation, are equal to the sever­  
est trials of war, as well as adapted to the  
ordinary periods of repose. As fruits of  
tnis experience, and of the reputation ac­  
qu red by the American arms, on the land  
and on the water, the ntUion finds itself  
possessed of a growing respect abroad, am&#x27;  
ol a just confidence in itseif, whic!i area  
iftung tl;c be.-d pledges for its peaceful ca  
reer. Under other aspects of our country,  
the strongest feature * of its lioihishing con­  
dition are seen, in u population rapidly in­  
creasing on a territory as productive as ii  
is extensive ; in a general industry, and  
tortile ingenuity, which find their ample re­  
wards; and in an a.Huent reveuo, which  
admits a reduction of the &quot;public burthens,  
without withdrawing the means of sustain­  
ing the public credit, of gradually discha.-g  
ing the public dent, oi providing for (tie  
necessary defensive an 1 precautionary ev­  
tublisl noenis, and of&#x27;patronizing, in eve v  
authorized mode, undei&#x27;akings conduciv&gt;  
to the aggregate wealth and individua  
comfort of our citizens.  
It remains to- the guardians of th® pub  
i\c welfare, to persevere in that justice ami  
good wiH towards other nations, which i i­  
vite a return of these sentiments towards  
the United .&#x27;States ; to ciieris i iiiHtiturious

and a protection and extension of the inde­

THE PRESIDENT’S BMESSASE.  
Yesterday, at 12 0’ clock, the president of the Ny  
ted States transmitted to both houses of Contes  
the following message, by Mr. Todd, his Secratyr:  
Fellow citizens of the senate a  
and of the house of representatives:  
I have the satisfaction, on our present mee&#x27;ty  
  
being able to communicate to you the succes  
terminaticn of the war which had been Commer  
  
ed against the United States by the regen,  
Algiers. The squadron in advance, on that seni  
under commodore Decatur, lost not a moment be  
its arrival in the Mediterranean, in secking the te  
val farce of the enemy, then cruising in that Sea, anf  
succeeded in capturing two of his ships, one  
them the principal ship commanded by the Ain  
rme admiral. The bigh character of the America  
commander was brilliantly sustained on the occasig,  
which brought his own ship into close action witht,  
of his adversary, as was the accustomed gallaniy  
of all the officers and men actually engared., Hur.  
ping prepared the way by this demonstration  
}American skill and prewess, he hastened to the py  
of Algiers, where peace was promptly yielded to};  
victorious force. In the terms stipulated, the riay  
and honor of the United States were partic:  
ly consulted, by a perpetual relinguishment, o2  
pari of the Dey, -of all pretensions to tribute fia  
them ‘The imapresssions which have thus ha  
made, strengthened as they wilt have heen br a.

Is is another source of satisfaction, that the tre  
of peace with Great Britan has been succeeded }y

ed by the plenipotentiaries of the two coun  
In this restlt a disposition is manifested on ive pt  
  
  
  
the United States, which it may be hoped, wii  
improved into liberal srrangements on other susjec  
on which the parties have mutual mterests, or!&quot;

he Indien tribes within, snd bordering on our;  
southern frontier, whom a cruel war on their part) n  
had compelied us to chastise into peace, have lat-  
terly suewn a restlessness, which has cailed for  
repare‘ory measures for repressing it, and for  
rorecting the commissioners engaged in. carrying  
  
the erms of the peace into execution.  
  
Tie execution ef the act for fixing the military] agevegate sum of thirty-three millions and a half  
eace e tublishment, hus been attended with difii-  
cuties Which even tow can only be overcome by  
Jewisiative aid. The selecaion of officers; the pay-  
ment and discharge of the troops enlisted for the  
war; the payment of the retained troops; and their  
ye-union from detached snd distant stations; the  
co:lection and security of the public property, in  
the quarter-inaster, commissary, and ordnance de-  
artments; and the constant medical assistance re-  
quired in hospitals and garrisons, rendered a com-  
‘leat execution.of the act impwacticable on the first  
of May, the period more immediately contemplated.  
As soon, however, as circumstances would permit,  
and as far as it has been practicable, consistently  
with the public interests, the reduction of the army  
has been accomplished; but the appropriations for  
jts pay, and for other branches of the military ser-

of dollars, leaving a balance then in the treasury

Independent, however, of the arrear-ges due for  
military services and supplies, it is presumed, that  
a further sum of five miilions of dollars, including  
ie interest on the public debt payable on the Lst of  
January next, will be demanded at the treasury to  
complete the expenditures of the present year, and  
for which the existing ways and means will sufb-

The national debt, as it was ascertained on the

sum of one hundred and twenty millions of dollars,

with adversity in other forms, the United aes  
are in the tranquil enjoyment of prosperous —  
;onorable peace. In reviewing the scenes throug  
which it has been attained, we can rejoice in the  
roofs given, that our political institutions, found-  
ed in human rights, and framed for their preserva-  
tion, are equal to the severest trials of war, as well  
as adapted to the ordinary periods of repose. As  
nits of this experience, and of the reputation ac-  
aired by the American arms, on the land and on  
  
the water, the nation findse itself possessed of a  
  
owing respect abroad, and of a just confidence  
in itself, which are among the best pledges for its  
veaceful career. Under other aspects of our  
country, the strongest features of its flourishing  
condition are seen, ina population rapidly increasing,  
ona territory as productive as it is extensive; in  
a general industry, and fertile ingenuity, which  
Snd their ample rewards; and in an atMuent reve-  
nue, which admits a reduction of the public _bur-  
thens, without withdrawing the means of sustaming  
the pubhe credit; of graduaily discharging the  
pudlic debt, of providing for ihe necessary defen-  
sive and precautionary establisiments, and of pa-  
tronizuic in every authorized mode, undertakines  
conducive O the aggregate wealth and _jadividual  
comfort of our citizens.  
  
[It remains for the guardians of the public wel-  
fare, to persevere in that justice and good will to-  
Wards other nations, Which mvite a return of these  
sentiments towards the United States; to cherisa  
institutions which guarantee their safety and their  
liberties, civil and religious; and to combine with a  
liberal system of foreign commerce, an improve-  
ment of the natural advantages, and a protection  
and extension of the independent resources of our  
higuly favered and happy country.  
  
fnall measures having such objects, my faithful  
co-operation will be afforded.

is true that the improved condition of the

means of maintaining the faith of the

and of profecuting, fucccfsfully, the  
meafures of die moff liberal policy ; but  
will, alfo, juftify an immediate alleviation

I Will, it is believed be a temporary evil ;  
but, until they can be again rendered the

Notvvithftanding the fecuritv for future  
repole, which the United Mates ought to  
find in their love of peace, and their con­  
firm relpect for the rights of other na*

larly inculcates the IdFon, that, whether

litncc teaches that so many circumstances i

the more complicated kind*, that a country i  
may remain long without them, although

icestsare now at stake, it will become, Ml  
an eaily day, not only Sate against occasion­  
al competitions from abroad, but a source  
ol domestic wealth, and even of external  
tomnieice. In selecting the branches more  
especially entitled to the public patronage,  
a pieteience is obviously claimed by such  
as will telieve the United States from a  
dependence on foreign supplies, ever sub­  
ject to casual failures, lor uitides necessary  
tor the public defence, or connected with

be an additional recommendation of partic­  
ular manufactures, whtie the materials for  
them arc extensively drawn irom our i.gii­  
ctilture, and consequently impart and en­  
sure to that great fund of national prosper­  
i y and independence, an encouragement  
which cannot fail to be rewarded.  
Among the means oi advancing the pub­  
lic interest, the occasion is a proper one for  
recalling the attention of congress to the  
great importance or establishing throughout  
our countiy the loads and canals which can  
best be executed, under the national author -

m^re honor to the government, whose wise  
and enlarged patriotism duly appreciates

I have the fatisfadtion, on our present  
meeting, of being able to communicate to 1  
vou the fuccefsful termination of the war  
which had been commenced agaiaft the  
United States by the Regency ot Algiers.  
The {quadron in advance, on that service,  
under Commodore Decatur, loft not a mo­  
meat after its arrival in the Mediteriauean,  
in seeking the naval foree of the enemy,  
then cruising in that {ca, and {ucceeded in  
capturing two of his ships, one of them the  
principal ship, commanded by the Algerine  
Admiral. The high chara&amp;er of the A­  
merican commander was brililantly {aftain­  
ed on the occalion, which brought his own  
ship into close alion with that of his ad­  
versary, as was the accustomed gallantry of  
all the officers and men adtually engaged.  
Having prepared the way by this demon­  
stration of American skill and prowess, Le  
hastened to the port of Algiers, where peace  
was promptly yielded to his vic¥orous force.  
In the terms stipulated, the rights and hon­  
or of the United States were particularly  
eonfulted, by a perpetual relinquishment, on  
the part of the Dey, of all pretensions to  
tribute from them. &quot;Fhe impreflions which  
have thus been made, firengthened as they  
will have been, by f{ubfequent tranfa&amp;ions  
with the regencies of Tunis and Tripoli, by  
the appearance of the larger force which  
followed under commodore Bainbridge, the  
l chief in command of the expedition, and by  
the judicious precautionary arrangements  
left by him in that quarter, afford a rea­  
sonable profpeét cf future security, for the  
valuable portion of our commerce which  
pafles within reach of the 1@ bary cruisers.  
  
It is another source of {atisfaction that  
the treaty of peace with Great Britain bas  
been succeeded by a convention on the {ub­  
ject of commerce, concluded by the pleni­  
potentiaries of the two countries, In this  
result a disposition is manifcfted on the part  
of that nation, correfpending with the dis­  
position of the United States, whieh, it may  
be hoped, will be improved into liberal ar­  
rangements on other {fubjeéts, on which the  
parties. have mutual interests, or which  
might endanger their future harmony.—  
Congress will decide on the expediency of  
promoting such a sequel, by giving effc&amp;  
to the measure of confining the American  
navigation to American seamen ; a mea­  
sure which, at the fame time that it might  
have that conciliatory tendency, would  
have the further advantage of increasing the  
independence of our navigation, and the re­  
sources for our maritime rights..  
In conformity with the articles of the  
treaty of Ghent, relating to the Indians, as:  
well as with a view to the tranquility of  
our western and nerth western frontiers,  
measures were taken to eftablith an immedi­  
ate peace with- the several tribes who had  
been engaged in hostilities against the Uni­  
ted States. Such of them. as were invited  
to Detroit acceded readily to the renewal  
of the former treaties of friendthip. Of the  
other tribes who were invited to a station  
on the Mississippi, the greater number have:  
also accepted the peace offered to them.—  
The residue, confilting of the more distant  
tribes or parts of tribes, remain to be  
brought over by further explanations, or by  
such other means as may be adapted to the  
disposition they muy finally disclose.  
The Indian tribes within, and bordering  
on our southern frontier, whom a cruel war  
on their part had compelled us to chastise  
into peace, have lately shown a restlessness,  
which has called for preparatory measures  
for reprefling it, and for prote@ing the  
commissioners engaged in carrying the terms  
of the peace into execution.  
  
The execution of the a&amp; for fixing the  
military peace eftablifiment, has been at­  
tended with difficulties which even now can  
only be overcome by legislative aid. The  
feleQion of officers ; the payment and dis­  
charge of the troops enlisted for the war ;  
‘the payment of the retained troops, and  
their re.union from detached and distant sta­  
tions 3 the colle&amp;ion and security of the  
public property, in the quarter-maftér, com­  
missary and ordnance departments ; and the  
conflant medical afliltance required in hos­  
pitals and garrisons, ¥endered a complete  
execution of the a&amp; impra&amp;icable on the  
firft of May, the period more immediately  
contemplated. As {oon, however, as cir­  
cumstances would permit, and as far as it  
has been pradticable, consistently with the  
publc interests, the reduéion of the army  
has been accomplished ; but the appropri- l  
ations for its pay, and for other branches of |  
the military service, having proved inade- i  
quate, the earliest attention to that fubje&amp;  
will be neeeflary ; and the expediency of!  
continuing upon the peace eftablifhmeut,the |  
ftaff officers who have hitherto been-provi­  
sionally retained, is also recommended to the  
consideration of Congress.  
In the performance of the executive du­  
ty vpon this eoccafion, there has not been  
wanting a&#x27; just sensibility to the merits of  
the American army, during the late war :  
but the obvious policy and design in fixing  
an efficient military peace establishment, did  
not afford an opporturity to diftinguith the  
agec and iafirm, on account of their palt”  
services ; nor the wounded and disabled, on  
account of their prefeat fufferings. &#x27;The  
extent of the reduétion indeed unavoidably |  
involved the exclusion of many meritorious  
officers of every rank, from the service of  
their couutry ; and so &#x27;e&#x27;q\{al,\_as well as so  
  
A 7 ey  
n%ﬁiﬂ were ths cfa?:m to atteation,thil i  
a decition by the flandard of comparative  
merit, could feidom be attained. Judged,i  
however, in candor, by a general standard of  
positive merit, the Army regitter will, it is  
believed, do honor to the establishment ;  
while the case of those officers; whose nanes  
are not included in i 3, devolves, with the  
ftrongefl interest, upon the legislative au.  
thority, for such provifiou as thall be deem.-  
ed the beit calculated to give support and  
solace to the veteran and invalid 5 to dil­  
play the benilicence, as well as the juttice  
- of the government ; and to inspire a mar-  
E tial zeal for the public service, upon every  
future emerggncy.  
Although the enbarrafsmentsarifing from  
the want of an muiform national currency  
i have not been diminithed, since the adjourn­  
| ment of conarefs, great fatistuction has been  
dertved, in contemplating the revival of  
the public credit, and the efliciency of the  
public ilefources,” &quot;T&#x27;he receipts ito the  
&#x27; Treasury from the various branches of re­  
venue, during the nine moaths ending on  
the 30th of Sept, latt, have been eltimated  
at twelve millions and a half of dollars ; the  
issues of Treasury Notes of every denomina­  
&#x27; tion, during, the fame period, amounted to  
! the sum cf fourteen millions of dollars 3 aud  
  
there was, also obtained upon loan, durtng  
the fame/period a fam of - nine millions of  
dollars 3/oof which the sum of fix millions  
of dollas was subscribed in cash, and the  
{um of three millions of dollars in Treasury  
Notes. With thele meaus, added to the  
sum of one million anda half of doilars, be­  
ing the balasce of morey in the Treasury  
on the I{t of January, there has been paid,  
between the 1t of January and the 1t  
of Q&amp;ober, on account of the appropria­  
tion¢ of the precéding and of the present  
yeat, (exclusively of the amount of the  
Trealury Notes fubferibed to the lean,  
and the amount redeemed in the payment m‘;  
duties aud taxes) the aggregate sum of  
thirty-three millions and a half of dollars,  
leaving a ballance then in the T&#x27;reafury eiti­  
mated at the fuin of three millions of dollars.  
Independent, however, of the arrearages  
due for military services and supplies, it  
is presumed, that a further sum of five mil­  
lisns of dollars, including the interest on  
the public debt, payable on the 11t of Jau­  
vary next, will be demanded at the Trea­  
sury to complete the expenditures of the  
present year, and for which the exilting  
ways and means will {ufficiently provide. -  
The national debt, as it was ascertained  
cn the 1t of O&amp;ober last, amounted in the  
whole to the sum of one hundred and twen­  
ty millions of dollars, confifing of the un­  
redeemed balance of the debt contraéted  
before the late war, (thirty-nine millions of  
dollarg) the amount of the funded debt con­  
tratted in consequence of the war, (sixty  
four millions of dollars) and the amount of  
the unfunded aud floating debt {inclading  
‘the various iflues of T&#x27;realury Notes) feven­  
tsen millions of dollars, which isin a gradu~  
&quot;al course of payment, There will, proba­  
bly, be some addition to the public debt,  
upon the liq‘uid&quot;a%on of various claims,  
which are depecding ;. and. a conciliatory  
disposition on the part of Congress may lead  
honorably and advantageously to an equita­  
ble arrangement of the militia expences, in­  
curre¢ by the several states, without the  
previous fan€ion or authority of the gov­  
ernmeut of the Uhnited States: But, when  
® 15 cunfidered that the new, as well as the  
old, portion of the debt has been contrated  
in the assertion of the national rights and  
independence ; and when it is recollefed,  
that the publiz expenditures, not being ex­  
clusively bettowed wpon fubicéts of a tran­  
ficnt nature, will long be vilible in the num­  
ber and equipments of the American navy,  
in the military works for the defence of our  
harbors and our. frontiers, and in the sup­  
plies of our arsenals and magazines ; the a­  
mount will ‘bear a gratifying comparison  
with the obje@s which have been attended,  
as well as with the reflources of the coun-  
  
| try.  
&#x27; The arrangement of the finances, with a  
view to the receipts and expenditures of a  
- permanent peace eftablilhment, wilk necefla­  
rily enter into ‘the deliberations of Congress  
during the present session. It is true, that  
the improved condition of the public reven­  
ue, will not only afford the means of main­  
taining the faith of the government with its  
‘creditors inviolate, and of prosecuting fuc­  
celsfuily the measures of the most hiberal  
policy ; but wiil also jultify ‘an immediate  
alleviation of burthens imposed by the ne­  
‘cellities of the war. It is, however, essen­  
tial to every modification of the finances,  
that the benefits of an uniform national car­  
rency should be restored to the commanity.  
The abfcence of the precious metals will,  
it is believed, be atemporary evil ; but, un­  
til they can be again rendered the general  
medium of exchange, it devolves on the  
wildom of congrels to provide 2 {ubflitute,  
which .(hall equally engage the confidence,  
and accommodate the wants, of the citizens  
throughout the union. If the operation of  
the state banks carmmot prodnce this result,  
the probable- operation of a national bank  
will merit consideration ; and, if neither of  
these expedients be deemed effeétual, it may  
become neceflary to ascertain the terms up­  
on which the notes of the government, (no  
longer required as an instrument of credi:)  
shall be iffucd, upon motives of general pol­  
icy, as a common medium of circulation.  
&#x27; Notw¥ithitanding the security for future  
repose which the United States ought to  
find in their love of peace; and their con­  
flant rafpect for the rights of other nations,  
the charaéter of the times particularly in.  
culcates the lesson, that, whether to prevent  
or repel danger, we ought not to be ut}pre‘-  
pai&#x27;ec‘gfor it. This consideration will uﬁ.‘“’  
  
glently recommend to Congref§ a divial,  
provision for the immediate extension, and  
gradual completion, of the works of de­  
fence, both fixed and floating, on our mari- 1  
time frontier ; and an adcquate provilion  
for guarding our inland frontier, againit dan­  
gers to which certain portions es jt mey con- 1  
tivwe to be expoled. ; |  
As an improvement on our military eftab­  
lithment, it will deserve the consideration of  
Congress, whether a corps of invalids might  
not be so organized and employed, as at  
once to aid in the support of meritorious in­  
dividuals, excluded by age or infirmities,  
from the exilling eftablifhaient, and to pre­  
serve to the pubiic, the beneiit of their Ra­  
tionary services, and of their exemplary dis­  
cipline. L recommend, ulfo, an enlarge­  
ment of the military academy, alveady eftab­  
hiked, and the eftublithment of others in  
other fectious of the union. And I cannot  
press too much oa the atteution of Con­  
grels, such a claflification and organization  
of the militia as will molt effe€tually lender  
it the fafe gunard of a free slate. If experi­  
ence has thewn inthe late splendid achieve­  
ments of militia, the value of this resource  
for the public defence, it has shewn, also,  
the mmportance of that skill in the use of  
arms, and that familiarity with the eflential  
  
rules of discipline, which cansot be expect­  
ed from the regulations now in force.  
With ths fubjed is intimately connefed  
the peceflity of accommodating the laws, in  
every refpedt, to. the great object of ena­  
bling the political autliority of the union,  
tc employ, promptiy aund effeCtually, the  
phylical power of the union, i 1 the safes de­  
signated by the conllitution.  
The figral services which have peen ren­  
dered by our navy, and the capacities 1t has  
developed for the fuccefsfal co-operation in  
the national defence, will give to that por­  
tion of the public force its full value in the  
eyes of Congress, at an epoch which calls  
for the conflant vigilance of all governments.  
‘Lo prelerve the ships now in a {ound fate ;  
to complete thoie already contemplated s  
to provide amply the imperithable materials  
for prompt augmentations, and to improve  
the existing arrangement, into more advan­  
tageous cftabiifhments for the conftruétion,  
the repairs, ard the security of vessels of  
war, is dictated by the soundest policy.  
In adjufling the duties on imports to the  
obje&amp;t of revenue, the influcnce of the ta­  
rift on manufactures will neceflarily present  
itfelf for consideration. However wife the  
theory may be, which leaves to the sagaci­  
ty and interelt of individuals the application  
of their iuduflry and relources, there are in  
this as in other cases, exceptions to the gen­  
éral rule. Besides the condition which the  
theory itfelf implies, of a reciprocal adop­  
tion by other natiors, experience teaches  
that so many circumstances must occur in  
introducing and maturing manufacturing ef­  
tablifiments, especially of the more compli­  
cated kinds, thiat a conntry may remain long  
without them, although fufficiently advanc­  
ed, and in some respects even peculiarly fit­  
ted for carrying them on&#x27;with success. Un­  
der circumstances giving a powerful impulse  
to manufa@uring induitry, it has made a­  
mong us a progress, and exhibited an effi­  
ciency, which juftify the belief, that with a  
protection: not more than is due to the en­  
terprizing citizens whose interests are now  
at stake, it will become at an early day not  
only fafe against occasional competitions  
from abroad, but a source of domestic  
wealth, and even of external commerce. In  
selecting the branches more especially enti­  
tled to the public&#x27; patronage, a preference  
1s obvicufly claimed by such as will relieve  
the Efnited States from a dependence on  
foreign supplies, ever fubje&amp;t to calual fail­  
ures, for articles necessary for the public  
defence, or conneéed -with the primary  
wias:s of individuals..——llt will be an ad­  
¢itioaal recommendation of particular man­  
ufaires, where the materials for them are  
exteslively drawn from our agriculture, and  
confurmently “impart and ensure to that  
great fund of national prosperity and inde­  
pendence, an encouragement which cannot  
fail te- be rewarded. ;  
  
| Among the means of advaneing, the pub.  
| lic intereils, the occasion is a proper one for  
’reca]li::g the attention of congress to the  
| great importance of eftablithing throughout  
| our country the roads and canals which can  
best be executed, ander the national au­  
} thority. No objects within the circle of  
political economy {o richly re-pay the ex­  
? pence bestowed on them : there are none,  
the wtility of which is more noiverfally as.  
certained and acknowledyed ; nene that do  
more honor to the government, whose wile  
and enlarged patriotism duly appreciates  
them. Noris there any country which pre­  
sents a field, where nature invites more the  
art of man, to complete her owa work for  
his accommodation and benefit, “&#x27;Thele  
considerations are strengthened, moreover,  
by the political effe&amp; of ithele facilities for  
intercommunication, in bringing and bind.  
ing more closely together the various parts  
of our extended corfederacyy Whillt the  
[tates, individually, with ‘a laudable enter­  
prize and emulation, avail themlelves of  
their local advantages, by new roads, by  
navigable canals, and by improving the  
streams susceptible of navigation, the gen.  
eral goverament is the more urged to simi­  
lar undertakings, requiring a national juris­  
«diction, and national meaus, by the prof­  
pe&amp;t of thus fyfltematically completing so  
ineftimablea work. And it is a happy  
refle@ion, that any defe@ of constitutional  
authority, which ‘may be encountered, can  
be supplied In.a mode which the conttitu.  
tion iﬂ%f”bas, providently pointed out.  
The present is a favourable season also  
for bringing . again into view the eltablifh­  
ment of a national seminary of learning  
  
within the A&amp; of Columbia, and with  
means drawn from the property therein  
fubje&amp; to the authority of the general gov­  
evnmnent. Such. an inftituticn claims the  
patronage of Congress, as a monument of  
their solicitude for the acdvancement of  
knowledge, without which the bicfings cf  
liberty cammot be fully enjoyed, or long prc­  
ferved 3 as 2 model inltructive 1n the forma­  
tion of other fewinaries ;3 as a nurlery of/

amples of those naticnal feelings, those lib­  
cral {entiments, and those cangenial nanners,  
which countribute cement to car vaon, and  
iirength to the grect politicar fubric, of  
which that 1s the formation.  
  
In clobing this communication, 1 oughs  
not to reprefls a sensibility, in which you  
wiil unite, to the bappy ot of cur country,  
and to the goodnels of a fupcrintcni_}%?.g  
Providence to which we 4re indebted for it.  
Whiilt other portions of mavkind are la­  
bouring under the Qifiveffos of war, tr  
struggling with adversity in other forms, the  
U. otates are in the tranquil enjryment of  
*pmfperous and honorable peace. -In re­  
viewing the fceres through which it has  
been atrained, we can rejoice in the proots  
given, that our political fuftitutions,founded  
in human rights, and framed for their pref­  
ecvation, are equal to the feveref trials f  
war, as weil as adapted to the ordinary pee  
riods of repose. As fruits of this experi­  
ence, and of the reputation acquired b;x the  
American arms, on the land and on the Wiia  
tev, the nation finds itlelf poflefled -of a  
growing refpe&amp; abread, and of a jult conh.  
dence in itfelf, which are among the beit  
pledges for Its peaceful career,  
Under other afpe@s of our conntry, the  
ftronge&amp; features of its flourithing condition  
are seen, in a population rapidly inereafing,  
an a territory as productive as it is exten­  
sive; ina general industry, and fertile in­  
genvity, which find their ample rewards ;  
and in an afluent revenue, which admits a  
redultion of the public burthens, without  
withdrawing the means of sustaining the  
public credit, of gradually dilcharging the  
public debt, of providing for the veceflary  
defenfive and precautiosary eftablithments,  
and of patronizing, in every authorifed  
mode, undertakings conducive to the ag­  
gregate wealth and individual comfort of  
our citizens,  
  
1t remains for the guardians of the pub­  
lic welfare, to persevere in that justice and  
good will towards other nations, which in­  
vite a return of these {entiments towards the  
U. States; to cherith inflitutions which  
guarantee their fafety, and their libertics,  
civil and religious ; and to combine with a.  
liberal {fyftem of foreign: commerce, an im­  
provement of the natural advastages,and a  
protection and extension of the independent  
resources of our highly favored and happy  
.country. : : \
In all measures, baving such obje&amp;ts, my  
faithful co-operation will be afforded.

I Dave be sefiabud tian, we ou present meet.  
ink, of bewg ahie to communica ¢ 1o you the  
successful termiination of the war which had  
been commenced against the Uddiled States  
sy the Regency of Algiers, The sguadion  
1 advanee, on that service, under Commos  
dore Decacur, lost not a moment after its ure  
‘ival in the Mediterrancan, in secking the  
naval force ol the enewmy, then cruisieg 1n  
ikat sea, and sneceeded in capturing two of  
nis ships one of them the principal ship,  
commanded by the Algerine Admival. The  
high characier of the American commander  
was boiliantly sustained on the occusion,  
which brought his own snip into close vetion  
with that of bis adversary, us was the aceus­  
tomed gallantry of all the officers and men  
ectnally engaged. Having prepaved the wuy  
by this demonstraticn of American skill aund  
prowess, he hestened to the part of Algiers,  
where peace was promptly yiclded to s vie­  
toridous toree. In the termns stipulated, the  
rights and honor ol the United Stutes were  
particularly consuited, by a perpetual relia­  
quishment, on the part of the Dey, of all pre­  
tentions (o tribnie from them. The mmpress  
sions which have thos been wmade, strength­  
cued as they will bhave been, by subsequent  
transatilons with the regencies of Tunis and  
Fripuii, by the appearance ot the larger torce  
which lollowed under commadote Batnbiidge,  
the chief o comaand o tye cxpedition, and  
by the judiclous precaulionary arangementy  
left by by in that quarter, sfiocd a ressonable  
prospect of {oture securiiy, tor the valuable  
poition of oo rommerce which passes within  
reach of the Barbary erulsers.  
  
It is another souirce of satusfiction that the  
rreary of peace with Geeat- Beitatn has been  
succceded by a convention on the subject of  
commerce, concluded by the plenipotentiaries  
of the two coanteies, lothis resuit a disposi­  
iton is maniiested on the part of that nution,  
corresponding with the disposition of the  
United Srates, which, it may be hoped, will  
be improved into liberal arrangements on  
other subjects, on which the parties have mu­  
‘ual intevests, or which might endanger their  
fntare bironny. Congress will decide on  
the expediency of promoting such a sequel,  
by giving eflect to the messure of confining  
the Awicrican navigationto Americanseamen;  
1 reasure which, at the same time that it  
might bave that conciitatoir tendency, would  
have the further advaniage of increasing the  
independence of our navigation, and the re­  
sources for our maritime delence.  
In conformity with the ainicles of the trea­  
&#x27;y ol Ghent, reluting to the Indians, as wel!  
as with a view to the tranquility of our wes­  
‘e.n and north-wesiern frontiers, measures  
were faken to establish an Itnmediate peasce  
with the several tribes who had been engaged  
in hostiiitics against the Unitea Siates. Such  
of them as were loovited to Detvoit acceded  
reacily to a renewal of the former treaties of  
friendship Of the other (ribes who were in­  
vited to « station on the Mississippi, the grea­  
ter aumber have also accepted the peace ol­  
fered to them. T&#x27;he residue, cunsisting of  
the more distani tribus or parts of tiibes, re­  
nain to be brought over by [urther expiana­  
&#x27;ions, or by such other means as may be adad­  
ed to the disposiiion they may finslly disclose.  
The Indian vibes within, and bordering on  
our couthern frontiery whom a cruel war on  
eir part had compelled us to chastise inio  
poace, have lately «hown a restlessoess, which  
aas called for prepartory measures for repres­  
sing ity and for protecting the commissioners  
cogaged in carrying the terms of the peace  
Into execution. :  
  
The execution of the act for fixing the  
ailitary peice establishment, has been atten­  
ded with difficulties which even now can only  
ne overcome by legislaiive aid. The selec.  
tion of officers ; the payment and discharge of  
the troeps enlisted tor the war ; the payment  
of the retained troops, and their re-union  
‘rom detached and distant siations ; the col­  
iection and secusity of the public proper&#x27;y, in  
he quarter-masier, commissary antd orduance  
vepartments ; and the constant medical assis­  
tance required in hospitals and gariisons, ren­  
dered a complete cxeccution of the act im  
practicable on the fiist of Muy, the period  
more immediately contemplaied. As soon,  
nowever, as clrcumstances would permit, and  
s far as it has been praciicable, conststently  
with the pablic interestsy the reduction of the  
srmy hes been accomplisbed ; but the appro  
p:lations for its pay, and for other branches of  
he milllary service,having proved inadequate,  
he earliest attention to that subject wiil b  
wecessary ; and the expediency of continuing  
upon the peace establishment, the steff offi  
cers who have hitherto been provisionally re­  
tained, is also recommended 1o the considera-  
Aoa of Congress, )  
  
In the performance of the executive davy  
ipon this occasion, there has not been want.  
ng a just sensibility 10 the merits of the A­  
perican army, during the late war ;3 but the  
vious policy and design in fixing an effici­  
ent military peace establishment, did pot al­  
tord an opportunity to distingnish the aged  
vl inficin, on account of thair past services;  
nor the wounded and disabled, on account of  
  
heir present sufferings. The extent of the  
redaction, indeed unaivoidably involvad the  
exclusion of many meritorions efficers of ev­  
ery rank, from the service of their country ;  
end %0 equal, as well as so nuwervis, were  
the claims to attention, that a decision by the  
standard of comparative meriyy could seidom  
be attained. Jadged, however, in candor, by  
4 general standard of positive merit, the Ac­  
my Register will, it is believed, do honor 10  
the establishment ; while the case of those  
officers, whose names are not incloded o i,  
devolyes, with the strongest interest, upon  
the legislative authority, for sach provision  
as shall be deemed the best colcnlated (o give  
support and solace 1o thie vetetun and invalid;  
(o displey the Lenificence, as well as the jus  
tice of the government ; und to inspire  
martial zeal for the public seivice, upon ev­  
ety future emergeacy. ,  
Although the embarrassments arising from  
the want of un voilo&#x27;m national currency have  
not been diminished, since the adjuurnment  
of Congress, preat satsfection hus been deri  
ved, in contemplaiing the vevivel of (he pub­  
lic eredit, und the «ficiency of the public ve­  
sources. The receipis into the Treasury,  
liom the vartous brunches of revenue, during  
the nine monihs ending on the 30th Septem-  
Ber lusty have been estimated ot twelve il  
hons and a hall of doltars ; the issues of  
Treasury Notes of every denamination, dur­  
oy ihe same pertod, umounied te the sum of  
fourteen millions of Jollars : and there was  
also obtained upon lovn, during the sanie pe­  
riod, a sumv of nine miiiions of dollars ; ol  
which the sum of six miilions of doliars was (  
subscribed in cashy snd &#x27;y sum of three mil.  
itons of dollurs in &quot;U&#x27;rewsury Notes. With  
these meuns, added to the sum of one nil- ]  
Arom and a hall of doliars, hciu,; the&#x27; balince  
of money 1o the T/ easury on the st of Jun.  
there has been patd between tac Ust of Juna- !  
ary and the Ist of O taber, on actaunt of the  
spproprations of (e preceeding and of the |  
present year, (vxclusively of the amount of  
the Ureasury Notes subscribed to the loan,  
#OG the amount redeewed in the payment of  
duties and taxces) the aggregate sum of thir- ]  
y three mwi&#x27;lions and a hall ot dollare, leaving  
a balunce thenio the Treasury esthwated al  
the sum ol thres mudboos of dollurs, lode­  
peadent, hewevery, of the arrearages due for’  
military services aud suppiies, 1018 presum­  
ed thet a turther sum of five millions of dol­  
lars, tcioding the&#x27;inerest on the public  
debt, payabie on the it of Janua y next, will  
bE demunded st the Tieasuiy to complete  
the expecdituies of (he present year, and for  
which the exisiing ways and means will suf  
ficiently provide.  
  
The national debt, us 1t way ascertained on  
the Ist ol QOctober tast, smounted n the  
whole to the sum of one hundred and twenty  
millions ot dullarsy convisung of the unre­  
deemed balance of the debt cantracted belore  
the tute war, (thivty-nine milhions of dollars,)  
the amount ol the funded debt contracted 1o  
consequence of the war, (sixiy-four millions  
of doliars) and the amount ol the unlunded  
and Bouting debty (including the various iy  
sues of the Tieasury Nares) seventeen mil­  
hons of dollars, whico is in a gradual course  
of peyment. Toere will probebly, be some !  
additiun to the pubite debty upon the liquida­  
tiun of various clalmusy waich are depending ;  
and 4 conciliatory disposition on the part of  
Congress may lead honorably and advanisge­  
ously 10 an equitable ariangement of the mil.  
itia expences, incurred by the severdl states,  
without the previows sanction or atthory&#x27;y of  
the governent Hf the United States ¢ Buy,  
when it 18 considered, that the neiv, as well  
as the old, portion of the debt has been cop­  
tracted in the assertion of the nattonul rights  
and independence ; and when it is recollect­  
ed, that the public expenditures, not being  
exclusively bestowed upon subjects of a tran.  
sicnt nature, will long Le visible in the num­  
ber and equipments of the Awerican navy, in I  
the mitlitacy waorks for the defonce of vur har.  
bors and our frontiers, and i the supphes of  
our arsenals and mug zines j the amount will  
bgara granfying compa Ison with the objects  
which have been attained; as well as with the  
resources of the countiy. &amp;  
The arrangement ot the finan-és, with a  
view to the receipts and expenditures of a  
permanent peasce establishmenty, will neces­  
sarily enter into the deliberauons of Cougress  
during the present session. Ii is troe, that  
the improved condition of the public reven­  
uey will not only offord the means of main­  
taining the faith of the government with irs  
cieditors invislate, and of prosecuting suc­  
cesslubly the measures , the most livtral po­  
ficy 3 but will also josuly the immcdiate slle­  
viaiion of burthens imposed by the necessi­  
ties of the war, It is, however, esscniidl to  
every modilicatton of the Baances, that the  
benelits of an uniform national currency  
whould be restored 10 the commuaity. The  
ansence of the precions meials willy ic is be­  
lieved, be a temporary evil j but until they  
can be again rendered the general mediam  
of exchange, it devolves on the wisdom of  
Congress 1o provide a substiure, waieh shall  
cqually engog - the coMidence, and sccommo­  
date the wants of the cinnzens throughout the l  
Unton, 1 the operation of the state banks |  
cannot produce this result, the probable oper- {  
ation of a national bank wilt merit considera­  
tion ; and, it neither of these expedients be |  
deemed elfeciusl, it May becomes necessary  
10 asceriain the terms Upon which the M(ﬂ&#x27;{  
of the government, (no longer requiied ss an {  
instrument of erediv) shall be issned, npon

J E ) sl &quot; ‘

iy on ow maritime fioutier; and ap ooe  
quate provision for guarding ol inlahd e

tions of it may continue to be eartd. 1y  
As an improverment oh our mi hlf!&#x27; estobs

of Congress wether a corps ol ‘.QC‘M! Dl he  
not be so organized and employed, o 8 8t on:  
to aid in the support of meritotious h%ﬂ:  
ualy, excluded by age or infirmities, frotd  
the existiog estab&#x27;ishment, and to-w  
t*the public, the benelie of their Nqﬂbﬁu  
services, and of their exemplary discipii g  
I recommend, also, an enlargement of the  
wilitary acacemy, already establishedy  
and the establishmett of opthers ih othé  
er scctions of the wuvuion. And I cand  
not press too much on the attention of  
Congress, such a classification atid organiza­  
tion of the militia, as will most effectoally  
renderit the safe-guard of a free swaie. 1f  
experience has shewn in the late splendid  
achievements of militia, the value of this re~  
source for the public defence; 1t has shewn;  
also the Importance of thut skill in the use  
vt arms, ant that familiarity with the &amp;ssens  
nal rules of discipline, which cantiot be exs  
peetedy tram the tcsivlalionn tow in force:  
With this subject iy intimetely connected the  
necessity of nccommodating the laws,in every  
redpect, to the grest object of enadliog the  
political wuthurity of the wnion, 1o eaployy  
prompily and eMecroally, the physical power  
of the unmon, in the cases dsignuted by the  
constitution, .  
  
The signal services which have beeh reti­  
derved by our Davy, and the capacities ivhay  
devoloped for the successful co-operation i  
the notional delence, will give 1o that portion  
of the ptiblic force i (0l vulhe io the eyes  
of Congress, at an epoch which calls for Iha  
constant vigilance of all governmens. Td  
preserve the ships now in u sound stsie ; 1o

the existing nrrangements imo more advan- |  
tageous establishtments, for the constractiohy *  
the repsirs; and the sceutity of vessels of wary  
is dictated by the soundest policy. ‘  
Ino adjusting the dutics on imports to (le  
object ot revenue,the influehee of Ilie tanfl on  
manufactores will necessarily present iself  
for consideration. Howerer wise the theory  
may be, which leaves 10 the ragacity and in­

ohviously claimed bty such as will relieve the .

&#x27;conciliatory tendency, would have the further  
advantage of increasing the iudepecdsncc of

to inspire a martial zeal for the public service  
  
upon every future emergency.  
Although the&#x27; embarrassments arising from  
the want of an uniform oat&#x27;t3nal currency have  
not been diminished, since the adjournment of  
CoogreM, great satisfaction has beenderiVedin  
contemplating the revival of the pubd:e credit  
and the efficiency of the public resources.  
Tlte receipts into the treasury, from the vari­  
rious branches of the revenue, during the 9  
months ending on the 30th September last,  
have been estimated at twelve millions and a  
  
half of dollars : the issues of Treasury Notes  
  
of every denomination, duringkhe tame period.  
  
amouatca to tne sum oi lourreen minions or  
  
dollars, and there was also obtained upon loan,  
during the same period, a sum of nine millions  
of dollars ; of which the sum of six millions of  
  
dollars was subscribed in cash, and the sum  
  
of three millions of dollars in treasury notes  
  
With these means, added to the sum of one  
  
milliou aud a half of dollars, being the balance  
  
of money in the treasury on the lit of January,  
  
there has been paid, between the 1st of January  
  
and the 1st of Oct. on account of the ap­  
propriations of the preceding aud the present  
  
year (&quot;exclusively of the amount of the trea  
  
sury notes subscribed to the loan, and the a­  
morit redeemed in the payment of duties and  
  
taxes) the aggregate sum of thirty three  
  
millions and a hall ot dollars, leaving a balance  
  
thenJin the treasury estimated at the sum of  
  
three millions of dollars. Independent, how  
  
ever, of the arrearges due for mUitary services  
  
and supplies, it is presumed that a further sum  
  
oi bve millions ot dollars, including the inter-  
  
st on the public debt payable on the 1st of  
  
January next, will be demanded at the 1 reasu­  
ry to complete the expenditures of the present  
year, and for which the existing ways and  
  
means will sufficiently provide., ,  
The national debt, as it was ascertained on  
  
the 1st Oct. last amounted in the whole, to the  
  
sum of one hundred and twenty millions of  
  
dollars, consisting of the unredeemed balance  
  
of thedebt contractephefbre the late, war (thirty  
  
nine millions ol dollars) the amour t ot the fun­  
ded debt, contracted in consequence of the  
war, (sixty four millions of dollars) and the  
amount of the unfunded and floating debt (in­  
cludingthe various issues cf the treasury notes J  
seventeen millions ot dollars, which is in a gra­  
dual course of payment. There will probably  
  
Ube some addition to the public debt, upon the  
  
liquidation ol various claims which are depend­  
ing; and a conciliatory disposition on the part  
of Congress irrav lead, honorably and advanta­  
geously, to an equitable arrangement of the  
militia expences, incurred by the several states,  
without the previous sanction ot authority  
of the government of the United States. But  
when it is considered that the new as well as  
the old portion of the debt hns been contrac­  
ted in the assertion of the national rights and  
independence ; and when it is recollected that  
the public expenditures, not being exclusively  
bestowed upon subjects of a transient nature,  
will long be visible in the number and equip­  
ments 6f the American navy, in the military  
works for the defence of our harbors and our  
frontiers, and in the supplies of our arsenals  
and magarioa ; the araount will boar a gratify­  
ing comparison with the objects which have  
been attained, as well as with th: resources of  
the country.  
The arrangement of the finances, with a  
view to the receipts and expenditures of a per­  
manent peace establishment, will necessarily  
enter into the deliberations of Congress, during  
the present session. It is true that the impro­  
ved condition of the public revenue -will not  
only tfford the means of maintaining the faith  
of the government with its creditors inviolate,  
and of prosecuting successfully, the measures  
of the most liberal policy ; but will, also, jus­  
tify an immediate alleviation of the burthens  
imposed by the necessities of the war. It is.  
  
however, essential to every modification of  
the finances, that the benefits of an uniform  
national currency should be restored to the  
community. The absence of the precious  
metals will, it is believed, be a temporary evil ;  
but until they can be again rendered the gen­  
eral medium of exchange, it devolves on the  
wisdom of Congress, to provide a subsitute  
which shall equally engage the confidence, and  
accommodate the wants of the citizens thro&#x27;out  
the union. , If the operation of t&#x27;s State Banks  
cannot produce this result, the probable opera­  
tion of a National Bank will merit considera­  
tion vhd if neither of these -expedients be  
deemed effectual : it may become necessary  
to ascertain the tenns upou &#x27; which! the notes of  
the , govcrnmen V fo longer required as an  
ipstrument of credicj shall be i&amp;ued; upon mo  
tives of general poUcy, aa a com tnon medium

viduals. excluded by are or infirmities from the  
  
existing establishment, and to preserve to the  
public the benefit of their stationary services,  
and .f their exemplary discipline. I recom­  
mend also, an enlargementof the AlilUtary A­  
cademy already establisbtd, and the establish­  
ment of others in other sections o! the union.  
And 1 cannot press too much on the attention  
of Congress, such a classification and organi­  
zation of the Militia, as will most effectu­  
ally render it the safeguard of a free Staie.  
If experience has shewn in the late splendid  
achievements of militia, the value of this re­  
source for the public defence, it has shewn al  
  
so the importance of that skill in tbeuseof  
  
arms, and that familiarity with the essential  
rules of discipline, which cannot be expected  
from the regulations now in force. With this  
  
subject is intimately connected, the necessity  
of accommodating tht laws, in every respect,  
  
to the great eject of enabling the political au  
  
thority of the union to employ, promptly &amp; el­  
fectually, the physical power of the union, in  
the cases designated by the constitution.  
The signal services which have been ren­  
dered by our Navy, and the capacities it has  
  
developed for the successful co-operation in  
national defence, will give to that portion ol  
  
the public force its f ill value in the eyes of  
  
Congress, at an epocn wnicn cans ior uie con­  
stant vigilance of all governments. To pre-  
.. . - 1 . . . A.  
  
serve tne snips now in a souna suuc , w cum­  
plete those already contemplated ; to provide  
amply the imperishable material for prompt  
augmentations, and to improve the existing ar  
  
rangements into more advantageous establish-  
j . ,i i  
  
ments, tor tne construction, tne repairs, ana  
the security of vessels of war is dictated by the  
soundest policy.  
  
In adjusting the duties on imports, to the  
  
object of revenue, the influence of the tarifl  
on manufactures will necessarily present itself  
for consideration. However wise the theory  
may be, which leaves to the sagacity and inter  
  
est of individuals the application of their in­  
dustry and resources, there are in this, as in t.­  
ther cases, exceptions to the general rule.  
Besides the condition which the theory itself  
implies, of a reciprocal adoption by other na­  
tions, experience teaches that so many circum­  
stances must occur in introducing and matur­  
ing manufacturing establishments, especially  
ol the more complicated kinds, that a country  
may remain long without them, although suffi­  
ciently advanced, and in some respects even  
peculiarly fitted fcr carrying them on wiih  
success. Under circrriaiances giving a pow­  
erful impulse to manufacturing industry, it  
has made among us a progress, and exhibited  
an efficiency, which justify the belief, that with  
a protection uot more than is due to the enter­  
prising citizens whose interests are now at  
stake, it will become, at an early day, not only  
safe against occasional competitions from a  
broad, but a source of domestic wealth, and e­  
ven of external commerce. In selecting the  
branches more especially entitled to the public  
patronage, a preference is obviously claimed  
by such as will relieve the United S;ates from  
a dependence on foreign supplies, ever subject  
to casual failures, for articles necessary for the  
publkdefenceyir connected, with the. primary  
wants of individuals. Itwillbean additional  
recommendation of particulat manufactures,  
where the materials for them are extensively  
  
drawn from our agriculture, and consequently  
impart and ensure, to that great fund of nation­  
al prosperity and independence, an encourage­  
ment which cannot fail to be rewarded.  
Among the means cf advancing the public in  
  
terest, the occasion is a proper one .r recal  
  
ling the attention of Congress to the great im­  
portance of establishing throughout our country  
the roads and canals which can be befst execu­  
ted, under the national authority. No objects  
within the circle of political ceconomy, so rich  
  
ly repay the expence bestowed cn thtm ; there  
are none, the utility of which is more univer­  
sally ascertained and acknowledged ; none that  
do more honor to the government, whose wise  
  
and enlarged patriotism duly appreciaies them.  
  
Nor is there any country which presents a  
field, whereT Nature invites more the art of  
man to complete her own work fo&#x27;r his accom­  
modation and benefit. These considerations  
are strengthened, moreover, by the political  
  
effect of these facilities for intercommunica­  
tion, in bringing and birding more closely to­  
gether the various parts of our extended con­  
federacy. Whilst the states, individually,  
withalaudibleenterprize and emulation, avail  
themselves of their local advantages, by , new  
roads, by navigable canals, and by improving  
the streams susceptible of pavigation, the gene­  
ral government is the more urged to similar  
undertakings, requiring a national jurisdiction,  
and national; means, by the prospect of thus  
  
syswaaticlIy, cbxpletleg ieettlou

founded in human rights, and fraxedfor Jieif  
preservation, are tq-ialto the severest trials off ,&#x27;

I have &#x27;he satisfaction, on our present meet-  
jng.of being able to communicate to you the  
successful termination of the war which Inid  
been commenced against the United States by  
the Regency of Algiers. The squadron in ad-  
vance, on that service, under Commodore De-  
catur, lost not a moment after its arrival in  
the Mediterranean in s-eking the naval force  
of the enemy, then cruizing in that sea ; and  
succeeded in capturing two of his ships,  
one of them the principal ship, commanded by  
the Algerine Admiral- The high character  
of the American commander was brilliantly  
sustained on the occasion, which brought li is  
own ship into close action with that of his ad-  
versary i as was the accustomed gallantry of  
all the officers and men actually engaged. —  
Having prepared the wav bv this deni mstra-  
tion of American skill and prowess, he hasten-  
ed to t}ie port of Algiers, where peace w as  
promptly yielded to bis victorious force. In  
the terms stipulated, the rights and honor of  
the United States were particularly consulted,  
by a perpetual &#x27;relinquishment on the part of  
the Dev of atl pretensions to tribute from them.  
The impressions which have thus been made,  
strengthened as tlipy will have been, by subse-  
quent transactions With the Regencies oi Tunis  
and Tripoli, b , the appearance of the larger  
force, which followed, under Commodore Main-  
bridge, the ch’cf in ronsuiand of the expedition,  
and ov the judicious prevail &#x27;irnarv arrange-  
ments left by him in that quarter, afford a rea-  
sonable prospect of future security, for the val-  
uable portion of our commerce. which passes  
Within reach of the Barbary cruisers.  
  
It is another source of satisfaction that the  
treaty of peace with Great Britain has been  
succeeded by a&#x27; convention on the subject of  
Commerce, concluded by &#x27;he Plenipotentiaries  
of the two countries. In this result a disposi-  
tion is manifested on the part of that nation,  
corresponding with the disposition of the Unit-  
ed States, which, it mat be hoped, will be im-  
proved int i Literal arraignment* on (Ith-M- sub  
jects, on which tliepvrties have mutual inter-  
ests, or which might endanger their future  
harmony. Congress, will decide on the ex-  
pediency of pvoinoting such a sequel, by giv-  
ing effect to the mea-ure of confining the A-  
Vnerican navigation tp American seamen; a  
measure which, at the same time that it might  
have that conciliatory tendency, would have  
the further advantage of increasing the inde-  
pendence of nur navigation, and tiie resources  
tor our maritime defence.  
  
In conformity with the articles of the Trea-  
ty of Gliept, relating to the Indians, as well as  
with a view to the tranquility of oitr Western  
and North Western fr-m tiers, measures were  
taken to establish an immediate peace with the  
beveral tribes who had been engaged in hostil-  
ities against the United States Such of them  
as were I ivited to Detroit acceded readily to a  
renewal of the firmer treaties of friendship. —  
Of the other tribes who wtre invited to a sta-  
tion on the M ssissippi, the g-eater number  
have also accepter! the peace offered to them.  
The residue, consisting of the m ire distant  
Tribes or parts of tribes, r -main to he brought  
over bv farther explanations, or by such other  
means as may be adapted to the disposition  
they may finally disclose.  
  
The Indian Tribts within and borderL-g on  
one Southern frontier, whom a cmel war on  
their part, had compelled ns to ciiastise into  
peace, have lately shewn a iv.tlessness, which  
has called for preparatory measures for re-  
pressing it, ami for protecting the commis-  
sioners engaged in carrying the terms of the  
peace into execution.  
  
The execution of the Act fir fixing the  
military peace establishment has been attend-  
ed with difficulties, which even now can only  
be overcome by legislative aid. The selection  
ot officers t the payment and discharge of  
the troops satiated for the war ; the payment  
of the retained troops, and tiieir re union trom  
detached and distant stations i the collection  
and security of the public property, in the  
Quarter Master, Commissary, and Ordnance  
Departments ; and the constant medical aa-  
aistance required in hospitals and garrisons,  
rendered a complete execution of the act im-  
practicable on the first of May, the period  
more immediately contemplated As soon,  
however, as circumstances w mid permit, and  
as far as it has been pract ; cable, consistently  
with the public interests, the reduction of  
the army lias been accomplished : but the ap-  
propriations ot its pay, and for other branches  
of the military service, having proved inade-  
quate, the earliest attention to that subject  
will be necessary ; and the expediency of con  
tinning upon the peace establishment the staff  
officers, who have hitherto been provisionally  
detained, is also recommended to the consid-  
eration of Congress.  
  
In the performance of the executive duty  
upon this occasion, there has not been wanting  
a just sensibility to the merits of the American  
army, during the late war : hot the obvious  
policy ami design in fixing an efficient military  
peace establishment, did not afford an oppor.  
‘unity to distinguish the aged snd infirm, on  
account of their past services, nor the wound-  
ed and disabled, on account of their present  
sufferings. The extent of the reduction, in-  
deed, unavoidably involved the exclusion of  
many meritorious officers of every rank from  
the service of their country ; and so equal, as  
well as so numerous, were the claims to atten-  
tion, that a decision by the standard of compa-  
rative irieriCcouM seldom be obtained. Judg-  
  
ed, however, in candor, by a *t*ndard  
  
if positive merit, the Army Register will, it is  
believed, do honor to the establishment ; while  
the case of those officers, whose names are not  
included in it, devolves, with the strongest in-  
terest, upon the legislative authority, for such  
provision as shall be deemed the best calculated  
lo give support and solace to the veteran and  
invalid ; to display the beneficence, as well the  
justice of the government, and to inspire a  
martial zeal for the public service, upon every  
future emergency.  
  
Although the embirrassments arising from  
the want of an uniform national currency, have  
not been diminished, since the adjournment of  
congress, great satisfaction lias been derived  
in contemplating the revival of the pubic ere.  
dit, and the efficiency of the public resources.  
The receipts into the Treasury, from the vari-  
ous bran rlies of the revenue, during the nine  
months ending on the 3&#x27;Jth of September last,  
have been estimated at twelm millions and a  
half of dollars ; the issues of Treasury Notes  
of -Very denomination, during the same period,  
amounted to the sum of fourteen millions of  
dollars ; and there was, also, obtained upon  
loan, during the same period, a sum of nine  
millions of dollars : of which the sum of six  
millions of dollars was subscribed in cash, and  
the sum of three millions of dollars in Treasu-  
; ry Notes. With these means, added to the  
j sum of one million and a half of dollars, being  
| the balance of money in the Treasury on the  
) first of January, there has been paid, between  
the first of January and the first of October, on  
account of the appropriating of the preceding  
and of the present year, (exclusively of the a-  
mount of the Treasury Notes subscribed to the  
loan, and the amount redeemed in the payment  
of duties and taxes) the aggregate sum of  
thirty-three milli .ns and a half of dollars, leav-  
ing a balance then in the Treasury estimated  
at the sum of three millions of dollars. Inde-  
pendent, however, of the arrearages due for  
military services and supplies, it is presumed,  
that a slim of five millions of dollars, iiiclud-  
ing the interest on the public debt payable on  
the first of January next, will be demanded at  
the Treasury to complete the expenditures of  
the present year, anil for which the existing  
ways and means will sufficiently provide.  
  
The national debt, as it was ascertained on ,  
the 1st of October last, amounted in the whole, j  
to tlie sum of one hundred and twenty millions  
of dollars, consisting of the unredeemed ha- i  
lance of the debt, contracted before tlie late ^  
war, (thirty nine millions of dollars) the &gt;  
amount of the funded debt contracted in con- |  
sequence of the war, (sixty four millions of i  
d diars,) &amp; the amount of the unfunded and ,  
l floating debt (including the various issues of :  
; Treasury Notes) seventeen millions of dollars, j  
which is in a grad - I course of payment.  
There will, probably he some addition to the  
public debt, upon the liquidation of various  
claims which are depending ; and a concilia-  
tory disposition on the p.irt of Congress  
may lead honorable and advantageously, to  
an equitable arrangement of the military  
expeners, incurred by the several states,  
without the previous ranclirnor authority of  
the government of the United States.  
Rut when it is considered that the  
  
new as well as the old portion of the debt has  
been contracted in &#x27;.he assertion of tlie nation-  
al rights and independence ; and when it is  
recollected that the public expenditures, not  
being exclusively bestowed upon subjects of  
a transient nature, will long be visible in the  
number and equipment* of the American navy,  
in the military works for the defence of our  
harbours and our frontiers, anti in tlie supplies  
ot our arsenals and magazines ; the amount  
will bear a gratifying comparison with the  
objects which have been attained as well as  
With the resources of the country.  
  
The arrangement of the finances, with a  
view to the receipts and expenditures of a  
permanent peace establishment, will necessa  
l ily enter into tlie deliberations of congress,  
during the present session. It ia true that the  
-improved condition of the public revenue, will  
not only afford tlis means of maintaining the  
faith ol the government with its creditors invi-  
olate, and of prosecuting, successfully, the  
measures of the most liberal policy ; but will,  
also, justify an immediate alleviation of the  
burthens imposed by tho necessities of the  
war. It is, however, essential to every modifi  
Cation of the finances, that the benefits of an  
uniform national currency should be rest red  
to the community. The absence of the preci-  
ous metals will, it is believed, be a tempora-  
ry wil : but, until their can be again render-  
ed the general medium ofexchange, it devolves  
on the wisdom of Congress, to provide a sub-  
stitute which shall equally engage the confi-  
dence, and accommodate the wants, of the citi-  
! zens througtioul the union. If the operation  
of the state Bank, cannot produce this result,  
the pnbable operation of a National Bank will  
merit consideration ; and, if neither of these  
! expedients be deemed effectual, it may become  
necessary to ascertain tbe terms upon which  
the notes of the government, (no longer re-  
quired as an instrument of credit) shall be is-  
sued, upon motives of general policy, as a  
common medium of circulation.  
  
• Notwithstanding the security for future re-  
[ pose which the United State* ought to find in  
j their loTe of peace, and their constant respect  
j fur the rights of other nations, the character  
of the times particularly inculcates the lesson,  
j that, whether to preveul or repel danger, we  
plight not lo be unprepared for it. This con-  
sideration will sufficiently recomrttend to Con-  
; gress a liberal provision for the immediate  
j extension and gradual completion of the works  
of defence, both fixed and floating, on our  
maritime frontier; and an adequate provision  
for guarding our inland frontier, against dan-  
gers to which certain portions of it may con-  
tinue to be exposed.  
  
As an improvement on our military estab-  
lishment, it will deserve &#x27;he consideration of  
Congress whether a corps of individuals might  
not be so organized and employed, as at  
once to aid in the support of meritorious in-  
dividuals, excluded by age or infirmities from  
the existing establishment, and to preserve to  
the public the benefit of their stationary servi-  
ces, and of tiieir exemplary discipline. ! re-  
commend also an ehlargement of the military  
academy already established, and the establish-  
ment of others in other sections of the union.  
And I cannot press too much on the attention  
of Congress, such a classification and organiza-  
tion oi the militia, as will most effectually  
render it the safeguard of a free state If ex-  
perience iia* been shewn in the late splendid  
achievements of militia, ‘the value of this  
resource for the puolic defence, it has shewn  
also the importance of that skill in the use  
o&#x27; arms, and that familiarity with the essen-  
tial rules of discipline, which cannot be ex-  
pected from I he. regulations now in force. —  
With tins subject i* intimately connected, the  
necessity of accommodating the laws in every  
respect, to the great object of enabling the  
political autho ity of the union to employ  
promptly and effectually, the physical power  
of the union, in the cases designated by the  
constitution.  
  
The signal services which have been render-  
ed by ouf nary, and tbe capacities it has deve-  
  
lottped for the sttf eessful co-operation in the  
national defence, will give to that portion of  
the public torcc its full, value in the eves of  
Congress, at an -epoch which calls for the con-  
stant vigilance of all governments. To pre-  
serve the snip* now in a sound state: to com-  
plete those already contemplated ; to provide  
amply the uiperishabie materials for prompt  
augmentations, and lo improve the existing ar-  
rangements into more advantageous establish-  
nents, for the construction, the repairs, and  
the security of vessels of war, is dictated by  
the soundest policy.  
  
In adjusting the duties on imports, to  
the object of revenue, the influence of  
the tariff on manufactures will t.ecessa-  
rily present itself for consideration.—  
However wise the theory maybe, which  
leaves to tlie sagacity and interest of in-  
dividuals the application of their indus-  
try and resources, there are in this, as  
in other cases, exceptions to the general  
rule. Besides the condition which the  
theory itself implies, of a reciprocal a-  
doption by other nations, experience  
teaches that so many circumstances  
must occur in introducing and maturing  
manufacturing establishments, especial-  
ly of the more complicated kinds, that  
a country may remain long without  
them, although sufficiently advanced,  
and in some respects even peculiarly fix-  
ed for carrying them on with success. —  
Under circumstances giving a powerful  
impulse to manufacturing industry, it  
has made among us a progress, and ex-  
hibited an efficiency, which justify the  
belief, that with a protection not more  
than is due to the enterprising citizens  
whose interests are r.ow at stake, it will  
become, at an early day, not only safe  
against occasional competitions from a-  
broad,but a source of domestic wealth,  
and even of external commerce. In se-  
lecting the branches more especially en-  
titled to the public patronage, a preference  
isobviously claimed by such as will relieve  
tbe United S&#x27;atcs from a dependence on  
foreign supplies, ever subject to casual  
failures, for articles necessary for the  
public defence, or connected with tbe  
primary wants of individuals. It will be  
an additional recommendation of partic-  
ular manufactures, where the materials  
for them are extensively drawn from our  
agriculture, and consequently impart and  
ensure, to that great fund of national  
prosperity anti independence, encourage-  
ment which cannot tail to be rewarded.  
  
Among the means of advancing tbe  
public interest, the occasion is a proper  
one for recalling the attention of Con-  
gress to the great importance of estab-  
lishing throughout our country tlie roads  
and canals which can be best executed,  
under the national authority. Noobjccl  
within the circle of political economy,  
so richly repay tbe expense bestowed on  
them ; there are none, the utility of which  
is more universally ascertained and ac-  
knowledged; none that do more honor to  
the government, whose wise and enlarged  
patriotism duly appreciates them. Nor  
is there any country which presents a  
field, where nature invites more the art  
of man to complete her own work for his  
accommodation and benefit. These con-  
siderations are strengthened, moreover,  
l&gt;V the political effect of these facilities  
for intercommunication, in bringing and  
binding more closely together the various  
parts of our extended confederacy.— !  
Whilst the stales individually, with alau-j  
dable enierprize and emulation, avail!  
themselves of their local advantages, by j  
new roads, by navigable canals, and by I  
improving the Streams susceptible of&#x27;  
navigation, the general government is the  
more urged to similar undertakings, re-  
quiring a national jurisdiction, and nation-  
al means, by the prospect of thus syste-  
matically completing so inestimable a  
work. And it is a happy reflection, that  
any dofect of constitutional authority,  
which may be encountered, can be sup-  
plied in a mode which the constitution it-  
self has providently pointed out.  
  
The present is a favorable season, also,  
for bringing again into view tlie establish-  
ment of a national seminary of learning  
within the District of Columbia, and with  
means drawn from the property therein  
subject to the authority of the genera!  
government. Such an institution claims  
the patronage of Congress, as a monu-  
ment of their solicitude for the advance*  
ment of knowledge, without which, the  
blessings of liberty cannot be fully enjoy-  
ed, or long preserved ; as a model in-  
structive in the formation of other semi-  
naries ; as a nursery of enlightened pre-  
ceptors ; &amp; as a central resort of youth Sc  
genius from every part of their country,  
diffusing on their return examples of  
those national feelings, those liberal sen*  
timents, and those congenial manners,  
which contribute cement to our union  
and strength to the great political fabric,  
of which that is tbe foundation.  
  
In closing this communication, I ought  
not to repress a sensibility, in which you  
will unite, to the happy lot of our coun-  
try, and to the goodness of a superintend-  
ing Providence to which we are indebted  
for it. Whilst other portions of mankind  
are laboring under the distresses of war,  
or struggling with adversity in other  
forms, the United States are in the tran-  
quil enjoyment of prosperous and honora-  
ble peace. In reviewing the scene*  
through which it has been attained, we  
can rejoice in tbe proof given, that our  
political institutions, founded in human  
rights, and framed for their preservation,  
are equal to the severest trials oi war, as  
well as adapted to the ordinary periods of  
repose. As fruits of this experience,  
and of the reputation acquired by the A-  
meiican arms, on the land and on the wa-  
ter, the nation finds itself possessed of a  
growing respect abroad, and of a just con-  
fidence in itself, which arc among the  
best pledges for its peaceful c»r««r. Uu-

manent peace establishment, will necessarily  
enter into the deliberations of Congress, dur-  
[tis true that the im-  
proved cond tion of the publick revenue will  
not only afford the means of maintaining tie  
  
violate, and of prosecuting, suecessfully, the  
measures of the most liberal poicy ; but will  
also, justify an immediate alleviation of the bur-  
thens imposed by the necessities of the war —  
It is, however, essential te every modification  
of the finances, that the benefits of an umform  
witional currency should be restored to the  
The absence of the precious me-  
tals will, it is believed, be a temporal evil : but  
until they can be again rendered the general  
medium of exchange, it devolves on the wis-  
dom of Congress to provide a substitute which  
shall equally engage the confidence, and ac-  
commodate the wants of the citizens through-  
If the operation of the state  
Banks cannot produce thig result, the proba-  
ble operation of a National Bank will merit con-  
sideration ; and, if neither of these expedicats  
be deemed effectual, it may become necessary  
toascertain the terms upon which the notes of  
the government, (no longer required as an_ in-  
strument of credit) shall be issued, upon mo.  
tives of general policy, as a common medium  
  
Notwithstanding the security for future re.  
ose which the U. States ought to find in their  
Se of peace, and their constant respect for the  
righte ef other nations, the character of the  
times particularly inculeates the lessop, that  
whether to prevent or repel danger, we ought  
notto be unprepared for it. This consideration  
will sufficiently recommend to Congress a liber-  
lq.provision fer guarding our inland frontier,

may continue to be exposed. = ;  
  
Asan improvement on our military estao-  
lishments, it wil! descrve the consideratin 0:  
Congress whethera cerps of invalids might  
not be so organized und employed, as at once  
toaid inthe support of meritorious individuals;  
excladed by age or infirmities from the eXxts-  
ting establishment, and :o preserve tothe pud-  
lick the benefit of (heir stationary services, and  
of their exemplary discipline. 1 recom-  
mend alsoan enlargement of the military aca-  
demy already established, and the establish-  
ment ofoihers inother sections of the union.  
And ! cannot press too. much on the aitention  
of Congress, sucha classificaffon and organt-  
zation ofthe militia, as will most effectually  
render it the se’e-guerd of a free state. Tt ex-  
nerience has shuwn in the late splendid a-  
chievements of militia, the value of this re-  
source for the pudlick defence, it has shewn al-  
sothe importance of that skill in the use of  
arms, ard that familiarity with the essential  
rules of discipline, which cannot be expected  
from the reulations now in force. With this  
subject is istimately connected, the necessity  
ofaccomseuting the laws, in every other re-  
spect, to (ie great object of enabling the po-  
litical autiusitty of the unien to employ,  
promptly and effectually, the physical power  
ofthe union, in the cases designated by the  
constitution.  
  
she signal services which have been ren-  
dered by our navy, and the capacities it has  
developedjfor successtul co-operation in the na-  
tional defence, will give to that portion of the  
publick force its full value in the eyes of Con-  
gress, atan epoch which calls for the vigi-  
lance of all governments. ‘To preserve the  
ships now in a sound state ; to complete those  
a&#x27;ready contemplated ; to provide amply the  
unperishable materials for prompt augmenta-  
lions, and to improve the existing arrange-  
ments into nore advantageous establishments,  
for the construction, the repairs, and the seca-  
rity of vessels ef war, is dictated by the sound.  
est policy,  
  
In adjusting the duties on imports, to the  
object of revenue, the influence of the tariff on  
manufactures will necessarily present itself for  
consideration, However wise the theory may  
be, which leaves to the sagacity and interest  
of individuals the application of their industry  
and resources, there are in this, as in other ca-  
ses, exceptions to the general rule. Besides  
the condition which the theory itself implies,  
of a reciprocal adoptioe by other nations, ex-  
perience teaches that so many circumstances  
nut oceur in introducing and maturing ma-  
nufacturing establishments, especially of the  
more complicated kinds, that a country may  
remain long without them, although suificient.

larly fitted for carrying them on with success.  
Under circumstances giving a powerfuk im-  
pulse to manufacturing industry, it has made  
among us a progress, and exhibited an efficien-

commencement of the First Session of  
the Fourteenth Congress.  
FLLLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE  
AND OF THE WOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES :  
  
’ ] wave the salisfaetion, on our present  
meciing, of being able to communicate to  
you the successful termination of the war  
which had been commeneed against the  
United States by the regency of Algiers.  
&quot;The squadron iv advance on that serviee,  
ender commodore Decatur, lost not a mo-  
ment after its arrival in the Meditersane-  
nu, in seeking the naval foree of the ere-  
  
emy then cruising inv that sea, and suceeed-  
ed in capturing two of his ships, oxe of  
them the principal ship, eommanded by  
the Algerine admiral. ‘Phe high charac-  
  
ier of the American commander was bril- |  
  
fiantly sustained on the oceasion, which  
brought his owa ship into close action with  
that of his adversary.as was the accustomed  
  
xallantry of all the officers and men actual. |  
  
sy engaged. Having prepared the way by  
this demonstration of American skifl and  
prowess, he hastened to the port of Al-  
xiers, where peaee was promptly yielded  
iv his victorious foree. In the terms sti-  
pulated, the rights and honer ef the Uni-  
ted States were particularly consulted,  
By a perpetual relinguishment, on the part  
of the dey, of all pretensions of tribute  
from them. ‘The impressions which have  
thus been made, strengthened as they will  
have been by subsequent transactions with  
the regencies of Tunis and of ‘Tripoli, by  
the appearance of the larger force which  
tullowed under commodore Bainbridge, the  
ehief in command of the expedition, and  
by the judicious preeautionary arrange-  
ments left by him in that quarter, afford  
a reasonable prospeet of future sccurity,  
for the valuable portion of our eommeree  
which passes within reaeh of the Barbary  
eruisers.  
  
}t is another source of satisfaction that  
the treaty of peace with Great Britain  
jas been succeeded by a convention on the  
subject of commerce, concluded by the  
plenipotentiaries of the two countries, In  
this result a disposition is manifested on  
the part of that nation, corresponding  
with the disposition of the United States,  
which, it may be hoped, will be improved  
Znto liberal arrangements on other subjects  
wn which the parties have mutual inter-  
esis, or whieh might endanger their fu-  
ture harmony.  
the expediency of promoting such a sequel,  
by § eo  
fining the American navigation to Ameri-  
  
ean seamen; a measure which, at the |  
  
same time that it might have that eoneili-  
alory tendency, weuld have the further  
advantage of increasing the independence  
ef our navigation, and the resourees for  
eur maritime defenee.

nfinuing apon the peaee establishment,  
the staff officers whe have hitherto been  
provisionally retained, is also recommend-  
ed to the consideratien af Congress. |  
la the performance of this executive daty |  
upon this occasion, there has uot been |  
wanting a just sensibility to the merits of |  
the American army during the late war: |  
but the obvious policy and design im fixing |  
an eficient military peace establishment |  
did net afford an opportunity to distio-  
guish the aged and infirm, on aeedunt of  
their past services ; ner the wounded and  
disabled, on account of their present suf-  
ferings. ‘The extent of the reduction in- |  
deed unavoidably involved the exelusiow  
of nrany ureritorious ofeers of every rank  
from the service of theif country ; and se  
eq: ol as well as so numerous, were the  
claims to attention, that a decision by the  
standard of comparative merit, could sel- |  
dom be attained. Judged, however, in  
candour, by a geveral standard of positive  
merit, the army register will, it is believ-  
ed, dv honor to the estahtishment ; while  
the case of those officers, whose names  
are vot included in it, devolves, with the  
sirongest interest, upon the legislative au-  
thority, for such provision as shall he  
deemed the best calculated to give sup-  
port and solace to the veteran and the in-  
valid; to display the beneficence, as well  
as the justice, of the government; and to  
inspire a martial zeal for the publie ser-  
vice upon every future emergency.  
  
Although the embarrassments arising  
from the want of au usiform national eur-  
rency have net been diminished sinee the  
adjournment of congress, great satisfaction -  
has been derived in coutemplating the re-  
vival of the public eredit, &amp; the cfieiency  
of the public resourees, ‘Fhe reecipts in-  
to the treasury, from the varions branches  
of revenue, doring the nine months ending  
on the 30th of September last, have been  
estimated at twelve millions and a half of  
dollars ; the issues of treasury notes of  
every denomination, during the same peri-  
od, amounted to the sum of fourteen mil-  
lions of dollars ; and there was also ob-  
tained upon loan, during the same period  
a sum of nine milfions of dollars; of  
which the sum of six millions of dollars  
was subseribed in eash, aud the sum of  
three millions of doHars in treasury notes.  
With these means, added to the sum of  
one aiillion and a half of dollars, being  
the balance of money in the treasury on  
the istof Jauuary, there bas been paid,  
between the 1st of January and the 1st of  
October, on account of the appropriations  
of the preceding and ef the present year,  
(exclusively of the amount of the treasu-  
ry notes subserided to the loan, and of the  
amount redeemed in the payment of du- ,  
ties and taxes.) the aggregate sum of  
thirty-three millions and a half of dollars,  
leaving a balance then in the treasury es-  
timated at the sum ef three millions of  
dellars. Independent, however, of the ar-  
rearages due for military services and  
supplies, it is presumed, that a further |  
sum of five millions of dollars, including  
the interest om the public debt payable on  
the first of January next, will be demand- ,  
ed at the treasury to eomplete the expen- |  
ditures of the present year, and for which  
the existing ways and means will suffi-  
ciently provide,  
  
‘The national debt, as it was ascertained |  
onthe ist of October last, amounted iv |  
the whole to the sum of one hundred and  
twenty millions of dollars, consisting of  
the unredeemed balance of the debt eon- |  
tracted before the late war, (thirty-nine |  
inillions of —* the amount of the funded |  
  
in consequence of the |  
  
war, (sixty four millions of doflars,) and |  
|

|  
  
  
  
the amount of the unfunded and floating:  
debt, (including the various issues of  
treasury notes,) seventeen millions of dol-  
  
ment. There will, probably, be some ad-  
dition to the publie debt, upon the liquida-  
tion ef various elaims, which are de-  
pending; aud a coneilatery disposition on  
the part of Congress may bead honorably  
and advantageously fo an equitable ar-  
rangement of the militia expenses, ineur-  
red by the several States, without the pre-  
vious sanction or authority of the govern-  
ment of the United States: bat when it is  
conyd ‘ed that the new, us well as the  
old Pm ion of the debt has been eantract-  
ed inthe assertion of the national rights  
and independence 3 aud wher it is revol-  
leeted, that the public expenditures, wot  
being exclusively bestowed upon subjects  
of a transient nature, will long be visible  
in the number and equipments of the  
American navy, in the military works for  
the defenee of our harbors add frontiers,  
and in the supplies of our arsenals and  
magazines; the amount will bear a grati-  
fying eomparison with the objeets which  
have been attained, as well ae with the  
resources of the eountry.  
‘The arrangements of the finances, with  
a view to the receipts and expenditures of  
a permanent peace establishment, wilt ne-  
cessarily enter into the deliberations of  
Congress during the present session, It  
is true the i ed condition of the pab-  
lie revenue will not only afford the means  
of maintaining the faith of the govera-  
ment, with its ereditors inviolate, and of  
prosecuting, suceessfully, the measures of  
of the most liberal solicy ; but will, also,  
justify an immediate aileviaties of the

tion ; and, if a@.Uier of these expedients  
be deemed effectual, it may become neces- |  
sary to asecriain the terms upon which  
the notes of the government (no longet  
required as an instrament of credit) shall.  
be issued, upon motives ef gencral poli-  
ey, as @ cémmon medium of circulation.  
Notwithstanding the security for fature  
  
find in their love of peace, and their con-  
stat respect for the rights of ether wa-  
tions, the character of the times partieu-  
  
  
  
to prevent or repel danger, we eught not |  
to be unprepared for it. ‘This cousidera- |  
tion will suffictently recommem? fo Con- |  
gress a liberal provision for the immedi- |  
ate extension, and gradual conypietion, of  
the works of defence, both fixed and float- |  
  
equate provision fer guarding our inland  
frontier, against dangers to which certain  
portions ef it may continue to be exposed.  
  
As am improvement in our military es-  
tablishment, it will deserve the considera-  
tion ef Congress, whether a corps of inva-  
lids might not be so organized and employ-  
  
torious individuals, excluded by age or  
infirmities from the existing establishment,  
and to preserve to the publie the benefit of  
their stationary services, and of their ex-  
emplary discipline. I recommend also, |  
an enlargement of the military ucademy, |  
already established, amd the establishment |  
of others in other sections of the union.  
And i cannot press too much on the at- |  
teution of Congress such a classification |  
and organization of the militia, as will  
most effectually render it the safeguard of  
a free state. If expericnee has shown in  
the late splendid achievements of militia,  
the value of this resource for the public |  
defence, it has shown also, the importance |  
of that skill in the use of arms, and that  
familiarity with the essential rules of dis-  
cipline, which cannot be expected from the |  
regtilations now in foree. With this sub-  
jeet is intimately connected the necessity |  
of accommodating the laws in every re- |  
spect, to the great object of enabling the |  
political authority of the union, to employ  
promptly and effectually, the physieal  
power of the eaion, in the cases designat- |  
ed by the constitation.  
  
The signal services which have been  
rendered by our navy, and the eapacities  
it has developed for successful co-opera-  
tion in the national defence, will give to  
that portion of the public force, its full  
value in the eyes of Congress, at an epoch  
  
  
  
all governments. To preserve the ships  
now in sound state; to complete those  
already contemplated ; to provide amply  
the imperishable materials for prompt aug-  
mentations, and to improve the existing |  
wrrangements into more advantageous es-  
tablishments, for the construction, the re- |  
pairs, and the seeurily of vessels of war,  
is dictated by the soundest policy.  
  
in adjusting the duties ow imports, to  
the object of revenue, the influence of the  
tariff om manufaciures, will necessarily  
present itself for consideration. low-  
ever wise the theory may be, which leaves  
to the sagacity and interest of individu-  
als the application of their iudustry and  
resources, there are in this, as in other ca-  
ges, exeeplions to the general rule. Be-  
sides the condition which the theory it-  
self implies, of a reciprocal adeptiun by  
other nations, experience teaches that so  
many circumstances must concur in intro-  
dueing and maturing manufactuting es-  
tablishmeuts, especially of the wore com-  
plicated kinds, that a country may re-  
main long without them, although suffi-  
ciently advaneed, and in some respeets  
even peeuliarly fitted for carrying them  
on with success. Under circumstances  
giving a powerful impulse to manufaetur-  
ing industry, it has made amongus &amp; pro-  
gress, and exhibited an efficiency, whieh  
justify the belief, that with a protection  
not more than is due to the enterprizing  
citizens, whosé interests are now atstake,  
it will beeome, at an early day, not only  
safe against oceasional competitions from  
abroad, bat a source of domestic wealth,  
and even of external commerce. In se-  
lecting the branches more especially enti-  
tled to the public patronage, a preference  
is obviously claimed by such as will re-  
lieve the Wnited States from a dependence  
on foreign supplies, ever subject to casual

ment which eanpot fail to be rewarded.  
  
Among the. means of advancing the pub-  
lic interest the oeexsion is a proper one for  
recalling the attention of Congress te the  
great importance of establishing through-  
out oureountry the roads and canals which  
can best be executed under the national  
authority. Noebjects within the circle of  
politieal economy so richly repay the ex-  
pense bestowed on them; there are none,  
the utility of which is more universally -  
ascertained and ackagwledg-d ; mone that |  
  
  
  
  
  
do more honor to the government, whose j  
  
wise and enlarged patriotism duly appre-  
¢iates them, Nov is there any country  
which presents a field where natare in-  
vites more the art of man, to complete her  
own work for his aceommodation and ben-  
efit. ‘These consideratiom are strength-  
ened, morrover by the politieal effect of  
these facilities for intercommunication in  
bringing and binding more elosely togeth--  
er the various parts of our extended con-  
federacy. Whilst (he States individually  
with a laudable enterprize and emulation,  
avail themselves of their loeal advanta-  
ges, hy new roads, by navigable canals,  
and by improviug the streams suseeptible  
of navigation, the general government is  
the more urged to similar undertakings,  
requiring a national jurisdiction, and na-  
tiowal means, by the prospect of thus  
systematically eompleting so inestimable  
a work. And it isa happy reflection, that  
any defect of constitutional aathority,  
  
which may be encountered cat be supphi- |  
  
ed in a mode which the constitation iself  
has providently pointed out.  
  
‘The present isa favorable season also  
  
for hriuging again into view the establish-  
ment of a national seminary of learning  
within the District of Columbia, and with  
  
|  
  
{  
  
  
  
meats drawn from the property therein  
subject to the authority of the general  
government. Such an institution claims  
the patronage of Congress as a monument  
  
of their solicitude for the advancement of |  
knowledge, without which the blessings |  
of liberty, cannot be fully enjoyed, or lowg |  
preserved : as a model instructive in the |  
formation of other seminaries,as a nursery |  
of enlightened preeeptora; and as a centrat |  
resort of youth and gewins from every |  
  
part of their country, diffusing on their |  
retura examples of those national feelings, |  
those liberal sentiments, and those congee |  
nial manners, whieh contribute cement to  
our union, aml strength lo the great polit-  
ical fabric of which that is the foundation,  
  
In closing this communications, | ought  
not to repress a sensibility, in which you  
will unite, to the happy lot of our country,  
and the goodness of @ superintending  
Providence to which we are indebted for  
it. Whilst other portions of mankind are  
laboring under the distresses of war, or  
strugeling with adversity in ether forms,  
the United States are in the tranquil en-  
joyment of prosperous and honorable  
peace. In reviewing the scenes through  
which it has been attained, we can rejoice  
in the proofs given, that our political  
institutions, founded in human rights, anil  
framed for their preservation, are equat  
to the severest trials of war, as well as  
adapied to the ordinary periods of repose.  
As fruits of this experience, and of the  
reputation acquired by the Anrerican arms,  
on the land and on the water, the nation  
finds itself possessed of a growing respect  
abroad, and of a jwst confidence in itself;  
whieh are among the best pledges for its  
peaceful career. Under other aspects of  
our country, the strongest features of its |  
flourishing condition are seen, ina popula- |  
tion rapidly increasing, on a territory as  
productive as it is extensive; ina general  
industry, and fertile ingenuity, which  
  
  
  
find their ample rewards: and in an  
  
aflluent revenue, whieh admits a reduction  
of the public burthens, without withdraw-  
mg the means of sustaining the public  
eredit, of gradually discharging the pub-  
hie debt, of providing for the unecessary  
defensive and precautionary establish-  
ments, and of patronizing in every au-  
thorized mode, undertakings conducive  
to the aggregate wealth uad individual  
eomfort of our citizens.  
  
It remains for the guardians of the pub-  
lic welfare, to persevere in that justice  
  
and good wiil towards otter nations,  
  
which invite a retura of these sentiments  
towards the United States; to cherish  
institutions which guarantee their safety,  
ant their liberties, eivil and religious ;  
and to combine with a liberal system of  
foreign commerce, an improvement of the  
national advantages, and a protection and  
extension of the independent resourees of  
our highly favored and happy eeuntry.  
In all. measures having such objects,  
ury faithful co-operation will be afforded.

vo use of Representatives,—I have the satis-  
‘faction, on our present meeting, of being  
able to communicate to you the successful  
  
termination of the war which had been  
commenced against the United States by the  
Regency of Algiers. The squadron, in ad-  
vance, on that service, under Commodore  
Decatur, lost not a moment after its arrival  
in the Mediterranean, in seeking the naval  
force of the enemy, then cruising in that  
  
_ sea, and succeeded in capturing two of his  
ships, one of them the principal ship, com-  
  
manded by the Algerine Admiral. The  
high character of the American Commander  
was brilliantly sustained on the occasion,  
  
_ which brought his own ship into close action  
  
with that of his adversary, as was the accus-  
tomed gallantry of all the officers and men  
actually engaged. Having prepared the  
way by this demonstration of American  
skill aud prowess, he hastened to the port of  
  
&gt; Algiers, where peace was promptly yielded  
  
to his victorious force, In the terms stipu-  
lated, the rights and honour of the United  
States were particularly consulted, by a per-  
petual relinquishment, on the part of the  
Dey, of all pretensions to tribute fom them.  
The impressions which have thus been made,  
strengthened as they will have been by sub-  
sequent transactions with the Regencies of  
Tunis and Tripoli, by the appearance of the  
larger force which followed under Commo-  
dore Bainbridge, the chief in command of  
the expedition, and by the judicious precau-  
tionary arrangements left by him in that  
quarter, afford a reasonable prospect of fu-  
ture security, for the valuable portion of  
our commerce which passes within reach of  
the Barbary cruisers.  
  
It is another source of satisfaction that the  
Treaty of Peace with Great Britain has been  
succeeded by a convention on the subject  
of commerce, concluded hy the Plenipoten-  
tiaries of the two countries. In this result  
a disposition is manifested on the part of  
that nation, corresponding with the dispo-  
sition of the United States, which, it may  
be hoped, will be improved into liberal ar-  
rangements on other subjects, on which the  
parties have mutual interests, or which might  
eudanger their future harmony. Congress  
will decide on the expediency of promoting  
such a sequel, by giving effect to the mea-  
sure of confining the American navigation  
to American seaman; a measure which, at  
the same time that it might have that conci-  
liatory tendency, would have the further

advantage of increasing the independence of  
our navigation, and the resources of our  
maritime rights,  
  
In conformity with the articles of the  
Treaty of Ghent, relating to the Indians, as  
well as with a view to the tranquillity of our  
western and north western frontiers, mea-  
sures were taken to establish an immediate  
peace with the several tribes who had been  
engaged in hostilities against the United  
States. Such of them as were invited to  
Detroit acceded readily to a renewal of the  
former treaties of friendship. Of the other  
tribes who were invited to a station on the  
Mississippi, the greater number have also  
accepted the peace offered to them. The  
residue, consisting of the more distant tribes,  
or parts of tribes, remain to be brought  
over by further explanations, or by such  
cther means as may be adapted to the dispo-  
sition they may finally disclose.  
  
The Indian tribes within, and bordering  
on our southern frontiers, whom a cruel  
war on their part had compelled us to chas-  
tise into peace, have lately shown a resfless-  
ness, which has called for preparatery mea-  
sures for repressing it, and fer protecting  
the Commissioners engaged in carrying the  
terms of the peace iato execution.  
  
The execution of the act for fixing the  
military peace establishment, has been at-  
tended with difficulties which even now can  
only be overcqme by legislative aid. The  
election of officers; the payment and dis-  
charge of the troops enlisted for the war ; the  
payment of the retained troops, and their  
re-union from detached and distant stations ;  
the collection and security of the public pro-  
perty, in the quarter-master, commissary  
and ordinance departments; and the con-  
stant medical assistance required in hospitals  
and garrisons, rendered a complete exeeution  
of the act impracticable on the first of May,  
the period more immediately contenaplated.  
As soon, however, as circumstances would  
permit, and as far as it had been practicable,  
consistently with the public interest, the re-  
duction of the army has been accomplished ;  
but the appropriations for its pay, and for  
other branches of the military service, hay-  
ing proved inadequate, the earliest attention  
to that subject will be necessary; and the  
expediency of continuing upon the peace  
establishment the Staff Officers, who have  
hitherto been provisionally retained, is alse  
recommended to the consideration of Con-  
gress.  
  
* In the performance of the executive duty  
upon this occasion, there has not been want-  
  
  
  
ing 4 just sensibility to the merits of the Ame

rican Army during the late war 5 but the ob-  
vious policy and design in fixing an efficient  
military peace establishment, did not afford  
an opportunity to distinguish the aged and  
infirm, ov account of their past services ; nor  
the wounded and disabled, on account of  
their present sufferings. The extent of the  
reduction, indeed, unavoidably involved the  
exclusion of many metitorious officers of  
every rank, fiom the service of their coun-  
try; and so equal, as well as so numerous,  
were the claims to atfention, that a decision  
by the standard of comparative merit, could  
seldom be attained. Judged, however, tn  
candour, by a general standard of positive  
merit, the Army Register will, it is believed,  
do honour to the establishment; while the  
case of those officers, whose names are not  
included in it, devolves, with the strongest  
interest, upon the legislative authority, for  
such provision as shall be deemed the best  
calculated to give support and solace to the  
veteran and invalid; to display the benefi-  
cence as well as the justice of the Govern-  
Ment; and to inspire a martial zeal for the  
public service, upon every future emergency.  
Although the embarrassmentsarising from  
the want of an nniform national currency  
have not been diminished, since the ad.  
journment of Congress, great satisfaction  
has been derived, in contemplating the revi-  
val of the publiccredit, and theefliciency of  
the public resources. The receipts into the  
Treasury from the various branches cf re-  
venue, during the nine months ending on  
the SOth of September last, have been esti-  
mated at twelve millions and a half of dollars;  
the issues of Treasury Notes of every deno-  
mination, during the same period, amounted  
tothe sum of fourteen millions of dollars:  
and there was also obtained upon the loan,  
during the same period, asum of nine mil-  
lions of dollars, of which the sum of six mil-  
lions of dollars was subscribed in cash, and  
the sum of three millions of dollars in Trea-  
sury notes.—W ith these means, added to the  
sum of one million and a half of dollars,  
being the balance of money in the Treasury  
on the Ist of January, there has been paid,  
between the ist of January and the Ist of  
October, on account of the appropriations  
of the preceding and of the present year (ex-  
clusively of the amount of the Treasury  
Notes subscribed to the loan, and the amount  
redeemed in the payment of duties and  
taxes), the aggregate sum of thirty-three  
millions and a half of dollars, leaving a  
balance then iu the Treasury estimated at  
the sum of three millions of dellars. Inde-

military services and supplies, it is presumed,  
that a further sum of five millions of dollars,  
including the interest on the public debt,  
payable on the Ist of January next, will be  
demanded at the Treasury to complete the  
expenditures of the present year, and for  
which the existing ways and means will  
sufficiently provide.  
  
The national debt, as it was ascertained  
on the Ist of October last, amounted in the  
whole to the sum of one hundred and twenty  
millions of dollars, consisting of the unre.  
deemed balance of the debt contracted before  
the late war (thirty-nine millions of dollars),  
the amount of the funded debt contracted  
in consequence of the war, (sixty-four mil-  
  
lions of dollars, and the amount of the un-  
  
funded and floating debt (including the  
various issues of Treasury Notes), seventeen  
million of dollars is in a gradual course of  
payment. There will, probably, be some  
addition to the public debt, upon the liqui-  
dation of various claims which are depending ;  
and a conciliatory disposition on the part of  
Congress may lead honourably and advan-  
tageously to an equitable arrangement of the  
militia expences, incurred by the several  
States, without the previous sanction or  
authority of the Government of the United  
States. Bunt, when it is considered that the  
new, as well as the eld, portion of the debt  
has been contracted in the assertion of the  
national rights and independence; and when  
it is recollected, that the public expendi-  
tures, not being exclusively bestowed upon  
subjects of a transient nature, will long be  
visible in the number and equipments of the  
American navy, in the military works for  
the defence of our harbours and our fron-  
tiers, and in the supplies of our arsenals and  
magazines; the amount will bear a gratify-  
ing comparison with the objects which have  
been attained, as well as with the resource  
of the country. :  
The arrangement of the finances, with a  
view to the receipts and expenditures of a  
permanent peace establishment, will neces-  
sarily enter into the deliberations of Con-  
gress during the present session. It is true,  
that the improved condition of the public  
revenue will not only afford the means of  
maintaining the faith of the Government  
with its creditors inviolate, and of prose-  
cuting successfully the measures of the most  
liberal policy; but will also justify an im-  
mediate alleviation of burthens imposed by  
the necessities of the war. It is, however,  
essential to every modification of the finances,  
that the bepefits of an uniform national

ity. The absence of the precious metals,  
ill, it is believed, be a temporary evil ;  
but until they can be again rendered the  
neral medium ‘of exchange, it devolves  
the wisdom of Congress to provide a sub-  
Htitute, which shall equally engage the con-  
fidence, and accommodate the wants of the  
Veitizens throughout the Union. If the ope-  
Yration of the state banks cannot produce  
“this result, the probable operation of a na-  
“tional bank will merit consideration; and if  
“neither of these expedients be deemed ef-  
“fectual, it may become necessary to ascer-  
“tain the terms upon which the notes of the  
“Government, (no longer required as an in-  
strument of credit) shall be issued, upon  
7 motives of general policy, as a common me-  
dium of circulation.  
  
Notwithstanding the security for future  
V¥epose which the United States ought to  
find in their iove of peace, and t!eir con-  
VStant respect for the rights of other nations,  
e character of the times particularly in-  
 tulcates the lesson, that, whether to prevent  
or repel danger, we ought not to be uupre-  
pared for it. This consideration will suf-  
ficiently recommend to Congress a liberal  
provision for the immediate extension and  
_» gradual completion of the works of defence,  
&gt; both fixed and floating, on ovr maritime  
7) frontier, and an adequate provision for  
) guarding our inland frontier against dan-  
7 gers to which certain portions of it may  
) continue to be exposed.  
  
&gt; Asan improvement on our military esta-  
&gt; diishment, it will deserve the consideration  
&quot;of Congress, whether a corps of invalids  
“Might not be so organized and employed, as  
‘at once to aid in the support of meritorious  
Andividuals, excluded by age or infirmities  
‘from the existing establishment, and to pre-  
“Serve to the public the benefit of their sta-  
tionary services, and of their exemplary  
Wiscipline. J recommend, also, an enlarge:  
ent of the military academy already esta-  
“dlished, and the establishment of others in  
/other sections of the Union. And I cannot  
Press too much on the attention of Con-  
Bress, sucha classification and organization  
‘of the militia, as will most effectually render  
at the safeguard of a free state. If experi-  
nce has shewn, in the late splendid achieve-  
ments of militia, the value of this resource  
for the public defence, it has shewn also the  
importance of that skill in the use of arms,  
nd that familiarity with the essential rules  
of discipline, which cannot be expected  
roin the regulations now in force. With

respect, to the great object of enabling the  
political authority of the Union to employ,  
promptly and effectually, the physical power  
of the Union, in the cases designated by the  
Constitution.  
  
The signal services which have been ren-  
dered by our navy, and the capacities it has  
developed for the successful co-operation in  
the national defence, will give to that por-  
tion of the public force its full value in the  
eyes of Congress, at an epoch whicl calls  
for the constant vigilance of all Giovern-  
ments. To preserve the sh ps now i a  
sound state; to complete those already con-  
templated ; to provide amply the unpetish-  
able materials for prompt augimenta&#x27;ions,  
and to improve the existing arrangements  
into more advantageous establishments, for  
the construction, the repairs, and the secu-  
rity of vessels of war, is dictated by the  
soundest policy.  
  
In adjusting the duties on imports to the  
object of revenue, the influence of the tariff  
on manufactures will necessarily present it-  
self for consideration. However wise the  
theory may be, which leaves to the sazacity  
and interest of individuals the application  
of their industry and resources, there are in  
this, as in other cases, exceptions to the ge-  
neral rule. Besides the condition which the  
  
theory itself implies, of a reciprocal adop-  
  
tion by other nations, experience teaches,  
that so many circumstances must eccur in  
introducing and maturing manufacturing  
establishments, especially of the mo:e com-  
plicated kinds, that a country may remain  
long without them, although sufficiently ad-  
vanced, and it, some respects even peculi-  
arly fitted for carrying them on with success.  
Under circumstances giving a powerful im-  
pulse to manufacturing industry, ithas made  
among us a progress, and exhibited an effi-  
ciency, which justify the belief, that with a  
protection not more than is due to the enter-  
prising citizens whose interests are now at  
stake, it will become, at an early day, not  
only safe against occasional competitions  
from abroad, but a source of domestic  
wealth, and even of external commerce. In  
selecting the branches more especially en-  
titled to the public patronage, a preference  
is obviously claimed by such as will relieve  
the United States from a dependence on fo-  
reign supplies, ever subject to casual fai-  
lures, for articles necessary for the public  
defence, or connected with the primary  
wants of individuals. It will be an additional  
recommendation of particular manufactures,  
where the materials for them are extensively  
drawn from our agriculture, and conse-

quently impart and insure to that great fund  
of national prosperity and independence, an  
encouragement which cannot fail to be re-  
warded  
  
Among the means of advancing the pub-  
lic interest, the occasion is a proper one for  
recalling the attention of Congress to the  
great importanc. of establishing throughout  
our country the reads and canals, which can  
best be executed under the national autho-  
rity. No objects within che circle of poli-  
tical economy so richly repay the expence  
bestowed on thein: thereare none, the uti-  
lity of which is more universally ascertained  
and acknowledged; none that do more ho-  
nour to the Government, whose wise aod  
enlarged patriotism duly appreciates them.  
Nor is there any country which presents a  
field, where nature invites more the art of  
man, to complete her own work for his ac-  
commodation and benefit. These consider-  
ations are strengthened, moreover, by the  
political effect of these facilities for inter-  
communication, in bringing and binding  
more closely together the various parts of  
our extended confederacy. Whilst the  
States, individually, with a laudable enter-  
prise and emulation, avail themselves of  
their local advantages, by new roads, by na-  
vigable canals, and by improving the streams  
susceptible of navigation, the general Go-  
vernment is the more urged to similar un-  
dertakings requiring a national jurisdiction,  
and national means, by the prospect of thus  
systematically completing so inestimable a  
work. And it isa happy reflection, that  
any defect of constitutional authority, which  
may be encountered, can be supplied in a  
mode which the constitution itself bas pro-  
vidently pointed out.  
  
The present is a favourable season also  
for bringing again into view the establish-  
ment of a national seminary of learning  
within the district of Columbia, and with  
means drawn from the property therein sub-  
ject to the authority of the general Govern-  
ment. Such an institution claims the pa-  
tronage of Congress,as a monument of their  
solicitude for the advancement of know-  
ledge, without which the blessings of liberty  
cannot be fully enjoyed or long preserved;  
as a model instructive in the formation of  
other seminaries ; as a nursery of enlightened  
preceptors; as a central resort of youth and  
genius from every part of their country, dif-  
fusing on their return examples of those  
bational feelings, these liberal sentiments,  
and those congenial manners, which contri

bute cement to our union, and strength to  
the great political fabric of which that is_  
  
| the formation.  
  
In closing this communication, | ought 4  
not to repress a sensibility in which you will |  
unite, to the happy lot of our country, and ©  
to the goodness of a superintending Provi- a  
dence, to which we are indebted for it.—  
Whilst other portions of mankind are la.  
bouring under the distresses of war, or strug.  
gling with adversity in other forms, the  
United States are in the tranquil enjoyment  
of prosperous and honourable peace. In  
reviewing the scenes through which it has  
been attained we can rejoice in the proofs  
given, that our political institutions, found-  
  
ed in human rights, and framed for their ¥%  
  
preservation, are equal to the severest trials  
of war, as well as adapted to the ordinary |  
periods of repose.—As fruits of this ex-  
perience, and of the reputation acquired by  
the American arms, on the land and on the  
water, the nation finds itself possessed of a  
growing respect abroad, and of a just Con:  
fidence in itself, which are among the best  
pledges for its peaceful career. 2  
  
Under other aspects of our country, the 9  
strongest features of its flourishing condition ©  
are seen ina population rapidly increasing, on |  
a territory as productive as it is extensive; 7  
in a general industry, and fertile ingenuity,  
which find their ample rewards; and in an  
affiuent revenue, which admits a reduction of |  
the public burthens without withdrawing |  
the means of sustaining the public credit, of |  
gradually discharging the public debt, of |  
providing for the necessary defensive and |  
  
precautionary establishments, and of patro- 7%  
  
nising, in every authorised mode, undertak-  
ings conducive to the aggregate wealth and  
individual comfort of our citizens.  
  
It remains for the guardians of the public  
welfare, to persevere in that justice and good  
will towards other nations, which invite a  
return of these sentiments towards the Uni-  
ted States; to cherish institutions which  
guarantee their safety, and their liberties,  
civil and religious ; and to combine with a  
liberal system of foreign commerce, an im-  
provement of the natural advantages, and  
a protection and extension of the indepen-  
dent resources of our highly favoured and  
happy country,  
  
In all measures, having such objects, my  
faithful co-operation will be afforded,

‘* T have the satisfactiqn, on our present-meéeting, of being able  
to communicate to you the suecessful termination of the war  
which had-been commenced against the United Stites by tlie  
Regeney of Algiers. The squadron in advante, on tliat service,  
under Commodore Decatur, lost not a moment, aftér its arrival  
in the Mediterranean, in seeking the naval force .of the enemy,  
then criuizing in that Seay aud. succeeded in captaring two of his  
ships, one of them the principal ship, commarided by the Al-  
gerine Admiral; The ligh Timsatnee. of the Améfican Com-  
mander was brilliantly sustained on the occasion; which brought  
his.own ship iuto close action with that of his adversary; as  
was the accustomed gallautry of all the Officers and hen actually  
engaged.  
  
** Having prepared the way by this demonstration of Americas  
*kill and prowess, he hastened to the port of Algiers; where  
peace was prompijy yielded to liis:vietortons foree. In the terms  
stipolated, the rights nd honour of tlre United States were pat-  
tiemarly consulted, by a perpetual relinquishment, an the part  
ofthe Dey, of ail pretensions to tritiute from them: |  
  
46 ‘The unpressens which have thus been made, strenethened  
as they will have bmen, by aghsequent transactions wish the Re  
gencies of Tonis and Tripoli, bs the apprarance of the larger  
force whieh followed under Commodore bainttridge; the elie! 4a  
command of the exped tion, and by the judicious precantionary  
  
by him in that quatier, afford a réasdydtle  
prospect of futare security, for the valuable porticn of our com  
merce which passes within reach of the Barbury crnizers: :  
  
* Ttis another source of satisfaction, that the Treaty of Pearce  
with Great Britain has beea succeeded by a Convention on the  
«uibject of Commerce, concluded by the Plenipoteutiaries of the  
two countries. In this result a disposition is manifested on the  
pert -of that nation corresponding with the dixposition of qhe  
i nited States, which, it may be hoped, will be improved into f&#x27;-  
beral arrangements on other subjects, on which the parties howe  
mutoal interests, om which might endanger they fiture harmony.  
  
“ Congresa will decide on the expediency of pramoting sucha  
sequel, by giving effect to the measure ofeonfining the Aracdcan  
Navigation to American seamen; a measure which, at the same  
time thatdt might lave that conciliatory teddeney; would Have  
the further adventste of increasing the independence Of oar na-  
vigation, aud thie resources for our maritime defence.  
  
In conformity with the Articles of the Treaty of Client, re-  
Joting to. the Indians, 4&amp;5 well.as with a view 10 the tranquillity  
of our Western and North-westerfi ffontiers, mesesures were

in hospitals and garritens, rendered a complete execution of the

ly contemplated. ’  
  
‘* As soon, however, as circumstances would permit, and as  
far os it as bern practionble, consistently with the puvtic inte-  
rests, the reduction of the army bas been acenmplished ; but the  
eppropriations for its pay, and for ether branches of the military

contemplating the reviva) of the poblic eredit, and the efictency  
of the aublic resonrces. The receipts into the Treasnry, from the  
various branches of the revenue, daring the nine inponthe ending  
on the 30th of Sept. last, have been estimated at 32,500,000  
oilars: the issues of Treasory-notes of every: dendmimntion,  
daring the same period, amounted to the sum of 14,000,000 of  
dollars; and there was also obtained upon lonn, dering the same  
period, a sum of nine millions of dollars; of which the sum of  
zis millions of dollars was subscribed in cash, and the sui of

I have the satisfaction, on our present meet-  
ing, of being able to communicate to you the  
successful termination of the war which had  
been commenced against the United States by  
the Regency of Algiers. The squadron in ad-  
vance, on that service, under commodoie De-  
cature, lost not amoment after its arrival in the  
Mediterranean, in seeking the naval force of  
the enemy, then cruising in that sea, and suc-  
ceeded in capturing two of his ships, one of  
them the principal ship, commanded by the  
Algevine admiral, The high character of the  
American commander was brilliantly sustained  
on the occasion, which brought his own ship  
into close action with that of his adversary, as  
was the accustomed gallantry of all the officers  
and men actually engaged. Having prepared  
the way by this demonstration of American  
skill and prowess, he hastened to the port of  
Algiers, where peace was promptly yielded to  
his victorious force. In the terms stipulated,  
the rights and honor of the United States were  
particularly consulted, by a perpetual relin-  
quishment, on the part of the Dey, of all pre-  
tensions totribute from them. The impressions  
which have thus been made, strengthened as  
they will have been by subsequent transactions  
with the regencies of Tunis and Tripoli. by the  
appearance of the larger force which followed  
under commodore Bainbridge, the chief ia  
command of the expedition, and by the judi-  
cious precautionary arrangements left by him  
in that quarter, afford a reasonable prospect of  
future security, for the valuable portion of our  
commerce which passes within reach of the  
Barbary cruisers.  
  
It is another source of satisfaction that the  
treaty of peace with Great Britain has been  
succeeded by a convention on the subject of  
commerce, concluded by the plenipotentiaries  
of the two countries. In this result a disposi-  
tion is manifested on the part of that nation,  
corresponding with the disposition of the Uni-  
ted States, which, it may be hoped, wiil be im-  
proved into liberal arrangements on other sub-  
jects, on which the pasties have mutual inter-  
ests, or which might endanger their future  
harmony. Congress will decide on the expe-  
diency of promoting such a sequel, by giving  
effect to the measure of confining the Ameri-  
can navigaiion to American seamen; a measure  
which, at the same time that it might have that  
conciliatory tendency, would have the further  
  
  
  
  
  
advantage of increasing the independence of ower  
  
  
  
  
  
8 ‘  
  
navigation, and the resources for our maritime  
defence.  
  
In conformity with the articles of the treaty  
of Ghent, relating to the Indians, as well as  
with a view to the tranquility of our western  
and northwestern frontiers, measures were ta-  
ken to establish an immediate peace with the  
several tribes who had been engaged in hostili-  
ties against the United States. Such of them  
as were invited to Detroit acceded readily toa  
renewal of the former treaties of friendship. Of  
the other tribes who were invited to a station  
on the Mississippi, the greater number have  
also accepted the peace offered to them. ‘The  
residue, consisting of the more distant tribes or  
parts of tribes, remain to be brought over by  
further explanations, or by such other means  
as may be adapted to the disposition they may  
finally disclose.  
  
The Indian tribes within, and bordering on  
our southern frontier, whom a cruel way on  
their part had compelled us to chastise into  
peace, have latterly shewn a restlessness, which  
has called for preparatory measures for repres-  
sing it, and for protecting the commissioners  
engaged in carrying the terms of the peace into  
execution.  
  
The execution of the act for fixing the mili  
  
_tary peace establishment, has been attendeu  
with difficulties which even now can only be  
overcome by legislative aid. ‘he selection of  
officers; the payment and discharge of the  
troops enlisted for the war; the payment of the  
retained troops, and their re-union from de-  
tached and distant stations; the collection and  
security of the public property, in the quarter-  
master, commissary, and ordnance depart-  
ments, and the constant medical assistance re-  
quired in hospitals and garrisons, rendered a  
complete execution of the act impracticable on  
the first of May, the pericd more immediately  
contemplated. As soon, however, as circum-  
stances would permit, and as far as it has been  
practicable, consistently with the public inter  
‘ests, the reduction of the army hes been ac-  
complished, but the appropriations for its pay,  
and for other branches of the military service,  
having proved inadequate, the earliest atten-  
tion to that subject will be necessary; and the  
expediency of continuing upon the peace es-  
tablishment, the staff officers who have hitherto  
been provisionally retained, is also recommen-  
ded to the consideration of Congress.  
  
In the perfopmance of the executive duty up-  
on this occasion, there has not been wanting a  
just sensibility to the merits of the American  
army, during the late war: but the obvious  
policy and design ia fixing an ; flicient military  
peace establishment, did not afford an oppor-  
tunity to distinguish the aged and infirm, on  
account of their past services; nor the wounded  
and disabled, on account of their present suf-  
ferings. The extent of the reduction indeed  
unavoidably involved the exclusion of many  
meritorious officers of every rank, from the  
service of their country; and so equal, as well  
as so numerous, were the claims to attention,  
that a decision by the standard of comparative  
merit, eould seldom be attained. Judged, how-  
ever, in candor, by a general standare of posi-  
tive merit, the Army Register will, it is believ-  
ed, do honor to the establishment; while the

cluded in it, devolves, with the stronges* inter-  
est, upon the legisiative authority, for such  
provision as shall be deemed the best calculated  
to give support and solace to the veteran and  
invalid; to display the beneficence, as well as  
the justice of the government; anc to inspire a  
martial zeal for the public service, upon every  
future emergency.  
  
Although the embarrassments arising from  
the want of an uniform na‘ional currency have  
not been diminished, since the adjournment of  
congress, great satisfaction has ‘een derived,  
in contemplating the revival of the public cre-  
dit, and the efficiency of the public resot ces,  
The receipts into the Treasury, from the vari-  
ous branches of revenve, during the nine  
months ending on the 3uth of September last,  
have been estimated at twelve millions and a  
half of dollars: the issnes of Treasury Notes of  
every denomination, du:mg the same period,  
amounted to the sum of fourteen millions of  
dollars: and the-e wes also ob‘ained upon loan,  
during the same period, a sum of nine millions  
of dollars: of whicb the sum of six millions of  
dollars was subscribed in cash and the sum of  
three millions of dollars in Treasury Notes.  
With these means, added to the sum of one  
miilion and a half of dollars, being the balance  
of money in the Treasury on the Ist of Janua-  
ry, there has been paid, between the 1st of Jan-  
vary and the Is. of Ovtober, on account of the  
appropriations of the preceding and of the pre-  
sent year, (exchisively of the amount of the  
Treasury Notes subscribed to the loan, and the  
amount redeemed in the payment of cuties and  
taxes, the aggregate sum ofthirty-&#x27; bree millions  
and a half of dollars, leaving a balance then in  
the Treasury estimated at the suin of three mil-  
lions of dollars Independent, however, of the  
arrearages due for military services and sup-  
plies, it is presumed, that a further sum of five  
millions of dollars, incluing the interest on  
  
‘the public debt payable on the Ist of January  
  
next, will be demanded at the Treasury to  
  
-complete the expenditures of the present year,  
  
and for which the existing ways and means  
will sufficiently provide.  
  
The national debt, as it was ascertained on  
the Ist of October last, amounted in the whole  
to the sum of one hundred and twenty millions  
of dollars, consisting of the unredeemed balance  
of the debt contracted before the tate war.  
(thirty nine millions of dollars) the amcont of  
the funded debt contracted in consequence of  
the war, :sixty four millions of dollars) and the  
amount of the unfunded and floating debt (in-  
cluding the various issues of ‘Treasury Notes)  
seventeen millions of collars, which is im a  
gradual course of payment. There will, pro-  
bably, be some addition to the public debt, up-  
on the liquidation of varions claims, which are  
depending, and a conciliatory disposition on  
the part of Congress may lead honourably and  
advantageously to an equitable arrangement of  
the militia expences, incurred by the several  
states, without the previous sanction or au-  
thority of the government of the United States:  
But, when it is considered that the new, as  
well as the old, portion of the debt has been  
contracted in the assertion of the national rights  
and independence; and when it. is recollected,

that the public expenditures, not being exclu-  
sively bestowed upon subjects of a transient na-  
ture, will long be visible in the number and  
equipments of the American navy, in the mili-  
tary works for the defence of our harbours and  
our frontiers, and in the supplies of our arse-  
nals and magazines; the amount will bear a  
  
ratifying comparison with the objects which  
ae been attained, as well as with the resour-  
ces of the country. ,  
  
Thearrangement of the finances, with a view  
tothe receipts and expenditures of a perma-  
nent peace establishment, will necessarily enter  
into the deliberations of Congress during the  
present session. It is true that the improved  
condition of the public revenue will not only  
afford the means of maintaining the faith of the  
government with its creditors inviolate, and of  
prosecuting, successfully, the measures of the  
most liberal policy; but will, also, justify an  
immediate alleviation of the burthens imposed  
by the necessities of the war. It is, however,  
essential to every modification of the finances,  
that the benefits of an uniform national cur-  
rency should be restored to the community.  
The absence of the precious metals will, -it is  
believed, be a temporary evil, but, until they  
can he again rendered the general medium of  
exchange, it devolves on the wisdom of Con-  
gress, to provide a substitute, which shall  
equaliy engage the confidence, and accommo-  
date the wants, of the citizens throughout the  
union if the operation of the state banks  
cannot produce this result, the probable opera-  
tion of a national bank will merit considera-  
tion; and, if neither of these expedients be  
deemed effectual, it may become necessary to  
ascertain Lhe terms upon which the notes of the  
government, (no longer required as an instru-  
ment of credit) shall be issued, upon motives  
of gene&#x27;al policy, as a common medium of  
cireulacion.  
  
Notwithstanding the security for future re  
pose, whica the United States ought to find in  
their Jove of peace, and their constant respect  
for the rights of other nations, the character of  
the times particularly inculcates the lesson,  
that, whether to prevent or repel danger, we  
ought not to be unprepared for it. This con-  
sideration will sufficiently recommend to Con-  
gress a liberal provision for the immediate ex-  
tension, and gradual completion, of the works  
of defence, both fixed and floating, on our  
mariiime frontier, and an adequate provision  
for guarding our inland frontier, against dan-  
gers to which certain portions of it may con-  
tinue to be exposed.  
  
_As an improvement on our military estab-  
lishinent, it will deserve the consideration of  
Congress, whether a corps of invalids might  
not be so organized and employed, as at once  
to aid inthe &lt;upport of meritorious individuals,  
excluded hy age or infirmities, from the exist-  
ing establishment, and to preserve to the pub.  
lic, the benefit of their stationary services, and  
of their exemplary discipline. J recommend,  
also, an enlargement of the military academy,  
already established, and the establishment of  
others in other sections of the union. And |  
cannot press too much onthe attention of Con-  
gress, such a classification and organization of  
the militia, as will mest effectually render it

the safe-guard of a free state. Ii experience  
has shewn in the late splended achievements of  
militia, the value of this resource for the public  
defence, it has shewn, also, the importance of  
that skill in the use of arms, and that familiar-  
ity with the essential rules of discipline, which  
cannot be expected from the regulations now  
in force. With this subject is intimately con-  
nected the necessity of accommodating the  
laws, in every respect, to the yreat object of  
enabling the political authority of the union,  
to employ, promptly and effectually, the physi-  
cal power of the union, in the cases designated  
by the constitution.  
  
The signal services which have been render-  
ed by our navy, and the capacities it has devel-  
oped for successful co-operation in the nation-  
al defence, will give to that portion of the pub-  
lic force, its full value in the eyes of Congress,  
at an epoch which calls for the constant vigt  
lance of all governments. To preserve the  
ships now in a sound state; to complete those  
already contemplated; to provide amply the un-  
perishable materials for prompt augmentations,  
and to improve the existing arrangements in-  
to more advantageous establishments, for the  
construction, the repairs, and the security of  
vessels of war, is dictated by the seundest poli-  
cy.  
= adjusting the duties on imports, to the ob.  
  
ject of revenue, the influence of the tariff on  
  
manufactures, will necessarily present itself for  
consideration. However wise the theory may  
be, which leaves to the sagacity and interest of  
individuals the application of their industry and  
resources, there are in this, as in other cases,  
exceptions to the general rule. Besides the  
condition which the theory itself implies, of a  
reciprocal adoption by other nations, experi-  
ence teaches that so many cire:mstances must  
occur in introducing and maturing manufac-  
turing establishments, especially of the more  
complicated kinds, that&#x27;a country may remain  
long without them, although sufiiciently advan-  
ced, and in some respects even peculiarly fit-  
ted for carrying them on with success. Under  
circumstances giving a powertul impulse to  
manufacturing industry, it has made among us  
a progress, and exhibited an efficiency, which  
justify the belief, that with a protection not  
more than is due to the enterprising citizens  
whose interests are now at stake, it will become,  
at an early day, not only safe against occasional  
competitions from abroad, but asourceof domes-  
tic wealth, and even of external commerce, In  
selecting the branches more especially entitled  
to the public patronage, a preference is obvious-  
ly claimed by such as will relieve the United  
States from a dependence on foreign supplies,  
ever subject to casual failures, for articles ne-  
cessary for the public defence, or connected  
with the primary wants of individuals, Jt will  
be an additional recommendation of particular  
manufactures, where the materials for them are  
extensively drawn from our agriculture, and  
consequently impart and ensure&#x27;to that great  
fund of nctional prosperity and independence,  
an encouragement which cannot fail to be re-  
warded.  
  
Among the means of advancing the public  
interest, the occasion is a proper one for recall-  
ing the attention of congress to the great im

portance of establishing throughout our coun-  
try the roads and canals which can best be exe-  
cuted, under the national authority. No ob.  
jects within the circle of political economy so  
richly repay the expense bestowed on them;  
there are none, the utility of which is more  
universally ascertained and acknowledged;  
none that do more honor to the government,  
whose wise and enlarged patriotism duly appre  
ciates them. Nor is there any country which  
presents a field, where Nature invites more the  
art of man, to complete her own work for his  
accommodation and benefit. These conside-  
rations are strengthened, moreover, by the po-  
litical effect of these facilities for intercommu-  
nication, in bringing and binding more close-  
ly together the various parts of our extended  
confederacy. Whilst the states, individeally,  
with a laudable enterprize and emulation, avail  
themselves of their local advantages, by new  
roads, by navigable canals, and by improving  
the streams susceptible of navigation, the ge-  
neral government is the more urged to similar  
undertakings, requiringa national jurisdiction,  
and national means, by the prospect of thus  
systematically completing so inestimable a  
work. And it is a happy reflection, that any  
defect of constitutional authority, which may  
be encountered, can be supplied in a mode  
“which the constitution itself has providently  
pointed out.  
  
The present is a favourable season also for  
bringing again into view the establishment  
of a national seminary of learning within the  
District of Columbia, and with means drawn  
from the property therein subject tothe author  
ity of the general governmem. Such an insti-  
tution claims the patronage of Congress, as a  
monument of their solicitude for the advance-  
ment of knowledge, without which the bles-  
sings of liberty cannot be fully enjoyed, or long  
preserved; as a model instructive in the forma-  
tien of other seminaries; as a nursery of en-  
lightened preceptors; as a central resort of  
youth and genius from every part of their  
country, diffusing on their return examples of  
those national feelings, those liberal sentiments,  
and those congenial manners, which contri-  
bute cement to our union and strength to the  
great political fabric, of which that is the foun-  
dation.  
  
in closing this communication, I ought not  
to repress a sensibility, in which you will unite,  
to the happy Jot of our country, and to the  
goodness of a superintending Providence to  
which we are indebted for it. Whilst other  
portions of mankind are laboring under the  
distresses of war, or struggling with adversity  
in other forms, the United States are in the  
tranquil enjoyment of prosperous and honora-  
ble peace. In reviewing the scenes throngh  
which it has been attained, we can rejoice in  
the proofs given. that our political institutions,  
founded in human rights, and framed for their  
preservation, are equal to the severest trials of  
war, as well as adapted to the ordinary periods  
ef repose. As fruits of this experience, and of  
the reputation acquired by the Americanarms,  
on the land and on the water, the nations finds  
itself possessed of a growing respect abroad,  
and of a just coniidence in itself, which are  
among the best pledges for its peaceful career,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
No. i.  
  
Under other aspects of our country, the strong-  
est features ofits hourishing condition are seen,  
in a population rapidly increasing, on a terri-  
tory as productive as it is extensive; in a gene-  
ral industry, and fertile ingenuity, which find  
their ample rewards; and in an affluent revenue,  
which admits a reduction of the public bur-  
thens, without withdrawing the means of sus-  
taining the public credit, of gradually discharg-  
ing the public debt, of providing for the neces-  
sary defensive and precautionary establish-  
ments, and of patronizing in every authorised  
mode, undertakings conducive to the aggre-  
gate wealth and individual comfort of our citi-  
zens,  
  
It remains for the guardians of the public  
welfare, to persevere in that justice and good  
will towards other nations, which invite a re-  
turn of these sentiments towards the United  
States; to cherish institutions which guarantee  
their safety, and their liberties, civil and reli-  
gious; and to combine with a liberal system of  
foreign commerce, an improvement of the na-  
tural advantages, and a protection and exten-  
sion of the independent resources of our highly  
favoured and happy country.  
  
In all measures having such objects, my  
faithful co-opperation will be afforded.

44 I have the salisf iction, 011 our present  
meeting, of being able to communicate to you  
tin; successful termination of the war which  
had been commenced against the United States  
by the Itegeucy «f Algiers. The squadron  
in advance, on that service, under Commodore  
Deca ur, lost not a moment, aftejr its arrival  
in itie ijediierranean, in seeking the naval  
force of ill»: enemy, then cruizing in that sea,  
and succeeded in capturing two of his ships,  
one of them the principal ship, commanded  
by the ALerint Admiral. The high character  
of the. American t&#x27;vmuiander was brilliantly  
sustained oil th* occasion, which brought  
his own ship int» (lose action with that of his  
adversary ; is was the accustomed gallantry  
of.all the- Officers and men actually engaged.  
J&#x27; Having piepa red tl.lo way by this demon­  
stration of American skill and prowess, he  
baso ned to the port of Algiers, where peace  
was pionrptly yielded U&gt;&#x27;his victorious force.  
In the terms stipulated, the rights and honour  
of the United Stales were particularly con­  
sulted, by 3 perpetual relinquishment, on the  
part of the Dey, uf all pretensions to tribute  
fiipn diem.  
44 Tb&lt;* tmpressi.ans y?hich hsve thus been  
nude, strengthened as they will l)ave been,  
by kwhsi quynt transactions vi, ith the Regetu  
ci-s of Tunis and.Tripoli, by the appearance  
oi the larger force which followed under  
Commodore liaiubridge, the chief in cum­  
maud itf the expedition, and by the judicious  
precautionary arrangemenis left by him in  
thai quarter, affotd 4 reasonable prospect of  
future security lor &#x27;he valuable portion of  
our commerce which passes withiu reach of  
the Harhary t rubers.  
44 1&#x27; is another source of satisfaction, that  
the Vteaiy of Peace wi&#x27;h Great Britain has  
been succeeded by a t Convention on the sub.  
jeel of Commerce, concluded by the Pleni.  
putentiaries of live two countries. In tlii  
result a disposition is manifested on the part  
of that nation corresponding with the dispo­  
sition of the United Stales, which, it may be  
boped, will be improved into liberal arrange,  
ments 011 other subjects, on which the nar.  
tiis have mutual interests, or which might  
endanger their future harmony.  
44 Congress w.ill decidj? on the expediency  
■of promoting such a svquel, by g&#x27;w&#x27;&quot;g eff ct  
t(| the measure of confining the American  
Navigation tu American seamen; a measure  
which, at the sayie time that it might have  
that conciliatory tendency, would have the  
further advantage of increasing the indepen­  
dence of our navigation, and the resource!  
for our maritime defence.  
4» in conformity wph the Articles of the  
Treaty of Ghent, relating to the Indian»., as  
well us wijh a view to the tranquillity of our  
Western and North-western frontiers, mea,  
sure» were taken to establish an immediate  
peace with the several tribes who had been  
engaged in hostilities against the United State»,  
Such of them as were invited to Detroit ac.  
tfeded readily I» a renewal of the former  
Treaties of friendship. Of the other tribes,  
who were invited t« 4 station 011 the Missis­  
sippi, the greater number have also accepted  
the peace offered to them. The residue, con­  
sisting of the more distant tribes or parts of  
tribes, remain to be brought over by further  
explanations, or by such other means as may  
be adapted to the disposition they may finally  
disclose,  
&quot; The Indian tribes within, and bordering  
on our southern frontier, whom a cruel war  
«li their part had Compelled us to chastise  
into peace, have latterly shewn a restlessness,  
which has called for preparatoiy measures fur  
repressing it, and for protecting &#x27;he Commis­  
sioners engaged in carrying the terms o,f the  
peace into execution.  
♦4 The execution »f the act for fixing the  
Military Peace Establishment has been attend­  
ed with difficulties, which even now can only  
be overcome by legislative aid. The selection  
of Officers, the payment and discharge of the  
troops for the war, the payment of  
the retained traops, and their reunion from  
detached and distant stations, the collection  
and security of the public properly in the  
Quarter.master, Commissary, and Ordnance  
Departments, and the constant medical assis.  
tance required in hospitals and garrisons,  
zeudered a complete execution of the act 11a.  
practit&amp;Me on The Ist of May, the period  
more immediately contemplated,  
&quot; As soon, however, as circumstances  
Would permit, and as far as it has been prac­  
ticable, consistently with the public interests,  
the reduction of the army has been accom­  
plished ; but the appropriations for its pay,  
and for other branches of the military service,  
having proved inadequate, the earliest atten.  
tion to this subject will be necessary ; and the  
expediency of continuing upon the peace es.  
tablishment the Staff Officers who have hitherto  
been provisionally retained, is also recom­  
mended to the consideration of Congress, In  
the performance of the executive duty, upon  
this occasion, there has not been wanting a  
just sensibility to the merits of the American  
army, during the late war; but the obvious  
policy and design in fixing an efficient military  
peace establishment did not afford an oppor­  
tunity to distinguish the aged and infirm, 011  
account of their past services : nor the wound,  
ed and disabled, on account of their present  
sufferings.  
44 The extent of the reduction indeed un.  
avoidably involved the exclusion wf uiany  
meritorious Officers of every rink, from the  
service of their country ; and so equal, as  
well as so numerous, were the claims to at.  
tentiou, that a decision by the standard of  
comparative merit coultl seldom be attained.  
Judged, however, in candour, by a general  
standard of positive merit, llje army register  
will, it is believed, do honour to the establish,  
ment j while the case of those Officers, whose  
names are uot included in it, devolves, w;ith  
the strongest interest, upon the legislative  
authority, for such provision as shall bed-em.  
Ed the best calculated to give support and so,  
lace to the veteran and invalid ; to display the  
beneficence, as well as the justice of the  
Government—rand to inspire a martial zeal  
for the public service, upon every future  
emergency,  
44 Although the embarrassment» arising  
from the want of an uniform National Cur.  
rency have not been diminished since the ad­  
journment of Congress, great satisfaction has  
been derived, in contemplating the revival of  
the public credit, and the efficiency of the  
public resources. The receipts into the Trea­  
sury, from the various branches of thif revenue,  
during the nine mouths ending 011 the 301 h of  
Sept, last, have been estimated at l*s,ó(Xi,o Ü  
dollars; the issues of Treasury-notes of every  
denomination, during the same period, automat­  
ed to the sum of 14,U00,0UQ uf dollars;  
and there was «Ist*obtained upon loan, (luting  
the sa.ne period, a sum of nine millions of  
dollars; of which the sum of six millions of  
dollars was subscribed in cash, and the sum  
of three millions of dollars in Treasury-notes.  
&#x27;■&gt; With these menns, «ctdxl m the sun) uf  
one million and a htlf of dollars, h 1 .g the  
balance of money in the Treasury on tue Ist  
of January, there has beejt paid, between (he  
Ist of January, and the Ist of Oclub, 1, oil  
account of the appropriations of preceding  
and of the present year, (exclusively of the  
amount of the Treasury notes subscribed tu  
the loan, aud the amount redeemed in the  
payment of duties aud taxes) flit? aggregate  
sum of 33 millions and a half of d. dla.i;*,  
leaving a balance then in the Treasury e»t(,  
mated at the suin of three millions of dollars.  
Independent, however, of the arrearages due  
for military services and supplies, it is pre­  
sumed, that a further sum of five millions  
of dollars, including the interest «11 the pul),  
lie debt payable 011 the Ist of January next,  
will be demanded at the Treasury, to com.  
pl.ete. the expenditures of the present year,  
ai|d for which the existing Ways aud Means  
will sufficiently provide.  
The national debt, as it was ascertained  
«tl the |st of October last, amounted in the  
whole to the suin of IÏO millions uf dollars,  
consisting of the unredeemed balance of the  
debt coutracttd before the late war (39 mil.  
!iou.s uf dollars) the amount of the funded  
debt contracted in consequence of the war  
(64 millions of dollars) and the amount of  
the uufu,nded and floating debt (including the  
various issues of Treasury Notes) 17 millions  
of dollars, which is in a gradual course of  
payment. There will, ptobably, be some  
addition to the public debt upon the liquida­  
tion of various claims which are depending ;  
and a conciliatory disposition on the part of  
Congress may lead honorably and advantage,  
ously to an equitable arrangement of the nil.  
litia cxpences incurred by the several State*,  
without the previous sanction or authority of  
the Government of the United States. but,  
when it is considered, that the new, as well an  
the old portion of the debtx mis been con­  
tracted in the assertion of the national rights  
aud independence; and, when it is rec»llected  
that the public expenditures, not being ex.  
clusively bestowed upon subjeft* of a trail,  
Sieot nature, will long be visible in the num,  
her and equipments of the American Navy,  
in tlje miliury works for the defence of our  
harbuurs and pur frontiers, aud in the sup.  
plies of our arsenals and magazines; the  
amount will bear a gratifying comparison  
wj|h the objects whjcli have been attained, as  
well as with the resources of the country.  
44 The arrangement of the Finances, with  
a view to the receipts aud expenditure of a  
permanent peace-establishuient, will necessa­  
rily enter into the deliberations of Congress  
during the present Session. It is true, that  
the improved condition of the public revenue  
will not only afford the mcaus of siaintaiuiug  
the faith of (he-Government with Its creditors e  
inviolate, and of prosecuting, successfully, the &lt;  
measures of the most liberal policy ; but will, i  
also, justify mi immediate alleviation of the i  
burdens imposed by the necessities of the war. j  
It is, however, essential to every modification  
of the finances, that the benefits of an uni- i  
form national currency should be restored to ,  
the community. The absence of the precious  
metals will, it is believed, fee a temporary  
evil; but, until they can be again rendered  
the general medium of exchange, it devolves  
on the wisdom of Congress to provide a sub.  
stituß», which shall equally engage the con.  
fidence, and accommodate the wants, of the  
Citizens throughout the Union.  
u If the operation of the Slate Banks can.  
not produce this result, the probable opera,  
tion of a National Bank will merit consi­  
deration • and, if neither of these expedients  
be deemed effectual, it may hecome necessary  
to ascertain the terms upon which the notes  
of the Government (no longer required as  
an instrument of credit) shall be issued, upon  
motives of general policy, as a. common  
medium of circulation.  
&quot; Notwi&#x27;hstanding the security for future  
repose, which the United States ought to  
find in their love of peace, and their constant  
respect for the riii&#x27;iii of other nations, the  
character of the times ptnicularly inculcates  
the lesson, that, whether to prevent or repel  
da. ger, we ought not to be unprepared for it.  
This consideration will sufficiently recommend  
to Congress i liberal provision for the imme­  
diate extension and gradual completion of the  
Works of Defence, both fixed and floating,  
on o&#x27;(f maritime frontier; and an adequate  
provision for guarding our inland frontier  
against dangers to which certain portions of  
it m ay continue to be exposed.  
&quot; As an improvement on our Military Es­  
tablishment, it will deserve the Consideration  
of Congress, whether» corps of invalids might  
not be .so organized and employed as at once  
to aid in the support of meritorious indivi­  
duals, excluded by age or infirmities from the  
gxisting establishment, and to preserve to the  
public the benefit of their stationary services,  
and of their exemplary discipline. 1 recom­  
mend also an enlargement of the Military Act.  
den\y already established, und the establishment  
of otners in other suctions of the Union.  
And I cannot press 100 much on the atten­  
tion of Congress such a classification and or­  
ganisation uf the .\lilitu as will most elfec­  
tu illy render it the safeguard of a free State.  
If experience has shewn, in the late splendid  
achievements of Militia, the value of this re­  
source for the public defence, it lias shewn  
also (he importance of that skill iu the use of  
arftis, and that familiarity with (he essential  
rules ol discipline, winch cannot be expected  
from the regulations now in force,  
&#x27;&#x27; With tuis subject is intimately connected  
the necessity of accommodating the laws in  
every respect to the great object of enabling  
tiie political authority of the Union to em­  
ploy, promptly and effectually, the physical  
power of the Union iu the cases designated  
: by the constitution.  
&quot; flie signal services which have been  
rendered by our Navy, and the capacities it  
, has developed for successful co-operation in  
the national defence, will give to that portiou  
. of the public force it» full value iu the eyes  
of at an epoch which calls for the  
constant vigilance of all Governments. To  
| preserve the now in a sound state—to  
complete those already contemplated—to  
provide amply the unperishable materials for  
prompt augmentations—and to improve the  
I existing arrangements into more advantageous  
. establishments for the construction, the re­  
pairs, and the security of vessels of war—is  
| dictated by the soundest policy.  
&quot; In adjusting the duties on imposts to tho  
1 object of levenue, the influence of the Tarif  
&#x27; on Manufactures will necessarily present itself  
&quot; for consideration. However wise the theory  
■ be, which leaves to Sagacity and interest of  
: individuals the application of their industry  
f aud resources, there are in this, as iu other  
i cases, exceptions to the general rule. Besides  
. the condition which the theory itself implies,  
I of a reciprocal adoption by other nations,  
&quot; experience teaches that so many circumstances  
, must occur in introducing and maturing ma.  
. nufacturing establishments, especially of the  
, oiore complicated kinds, that a country may  
&#x27; remain long without them, although sufficiënt.  
, ly advanced, and in some respects, even  
i peculiarly fitted for carrying them on with  
, success.  
i &quot; {Juder circumstances giving a powerful.  
impulse to manufacturing iudusty, it has made  
. among us a progress, and exhibited an efi­  
&gt; c&#x27;?ncy, which justify the belief that, with a  
protection not more than is due to the enter,  
pricing citizens, whose interests are now at  
stake, it will become, at an early day, iiot  
only safe against occasional competitions from  
: abroad, but a source of domestic wealth, and  
eveu of external commerce. In selecting the  
branches more especially entitled to the public  
patronage, a preference is obviously claimed liy  
such as will relieve the United Stales from ade­  
petidence on foreign supplies, ever subject to  
to casual failures, for articles ueeessary for  
(he public defence, connected with the pri.  
Mary wants of individuals. It will be an  
additional recommendation of particular ma­  
nufactures, where tae materials fur thiiu are  
extensively drawn from our a&#x27;?, auA  
consequently iiupa l and ensure to tiat great  
fund of natinnal prosperity ami ind -pendence  
an encouragement which &lt;a &gt; lot fail to be  
rewarded.  
&quot; Among the means of advancing the pub.  
tic interest, the occasion is a proper one for  
recalling the attention of the Congress to the  
great importance of establishing throughout  
our coontry the Roads and Canals, which  
can best be executed under the national au*  
thorily. No objects within the circle of po­  
litical economy s« richly repay (he expenci*  
bestowed on them ; there are none, the utility  
of which is more universally ascertained and ac­  
know lodged ; none (hat do mure honour to the  
Government, whose wise and enlargvd patriot­  
ism duly appreciates them- N»r is there any  
couuiry which presents a field where Nature  
invites mure (he av&#x27; of man to complete her  
own work for his accommodation and benefit,  
These considerations are itrengthened more­  
over by the political elïeets ut these facilities  
for inter-communication, in binding more  
closely together the various parts of our &lt;•*.  
tended confederacy. Whilst the&gt; StaiM indi.  
vidually, with a laudable enterprise, and emu.  
lation,&#x27;av til themselves of their local adran.  
tages, by new roads, by navigable canals, nod  
hy improving (lie streams susceptible of navi­  
gation, the General Government is the more  
urged to similar undertakings, requiring a.  
national jurisdiction aud national meuns, by  
the prospect of thus system atically completing  
so inestimable a work- And-it is a happy re.  
flection, that any defect of constitutional  
authority which may be encountered, Can be  
supplied in a mode which the Consultation it­  
self has providently pointed out.  
&quot; The present is a favorable season also, for  
bringing again into view the establishment of a  
National Seminary of Learning within thu dis.  
trict of Columbia, and with moans drawn from  
the property therein subject to the authority  
of the General Government. Such an institu­  
tion plaints the patronage of Congress, a» a  
monument uf their solicitude for the adv mee.  
ment of knowledge, without which the bless­  
ings of liberty cannot tye. fully enjoyed, or  
long preserved ; as a model instructive of the  
formation of other seminaries ;as a n,uiser ƒ  
of enlightened preceptors; as a cent); il resoit  
of youth and genius f£o»n eyery part of their  
Country, diffusing on their return examples of  
those national feelings., those liiieral senli.  
meuts, and tljose congenial manners, which  
contribute ceipeut to our union, and strength  
to the great political fabric of which that it  
the formation.  
&quot; In closing this communication, I ought  
not to repress a sens*tbi(j|y;, iji w.luch yog,,will  
unite, to the happy lot, of our country, and  
to tie goodness of a supet intending Providence  
to which we are indebted for it. Whilst  
Oliver portions of mankind are labouring  
under the distresses of war, or struggling witl{  
adversity in «thee forms, the yluted States  
are in the tranquil enjoy ment of piosperoug  
aud.hoiiorab&#x27;e peace. In reviewing thy scènes  
through which it, has been attained, &gt;v.e can .  
rejoice in the proofs given, that our political  
institutions, founded in human rights, and  
framed for their preservation, are equal to  
the severest trials of war, as well as adapted  
to the ordinary period» of repose.  
&quot; As fruits of this experience, and of the  
reputation acquired by the American srm%  
on the land and on the water, the nation fiudj  
itself possessed of a growing respect abroad and  
of a just confidence in itself, which are aiuorg  
the best pledges f«r its peaceful career.  
&quot; Under other aspects of our country, the  
strongest features of its flourishing condition  
are.seen, in a population rapidly increasing,  
on a territory as productive as it is extensive;  
in a general industry, and fertile ingenuity,  
which find their ample rewards; and in at:  
affluent revenue, which admits a &quot; reduction  
ot the public burthens, without withdrawing  
the means of sustaining llie public icrulit, of  
gradually discharging the public&#x27;debt, of pro.  
vitling for the necessary defensive aud precau­  
tionary establishments, and of patron iiing, ;u  
every authorised mode, undertakings con.  
ducive to the aggregate wealth and iudividual  
comfort of our citizcqs.  
&quot; U remains for the guardian of the public  
welfare to persevere in that justice aud good-&#x27;  
will towards other nations, which invite a re.  
turn of these .sentiments towards the United  
States; to cherish institutions which guarau.  
tee their safety, und their liberties, civil and  
religieus ; and to combine with a liberal sys­  
tem of foreign commerce, an improvement of  
thu natural advantages, and a protection and  
extension of the independent resources of our  
highly favoured aud happy country.  
&quot; In all measures having tucli objects, wy  
faithful co.operatiou will be afforded

vanced, and in some respects even peculiarly  
fitted for carrying them on with success. Un­  
der circumstances giving a powerful impulse to  
manufacturing industry, it has made among us  
a progress, and exhibited an efficiency which  
justify the belief, that with a protection not  
more than is due to the enterprising citizens  
whose interests are now at stake, it will become  
at an early day, not only safe against occasion­  
al competitions from abroad, but a source of,  
domestic wealth, and even of external com­  
merce. In selecting the branches more espe­  
cially entitled to the public patronage, a prefer­  
ence is obviously claimed by such as will re­  
lieve the United Stales from a dependence on  
foreign supplies,even subject to casual failures  
for articles necessary for the public defence, or  
connected with the primary wants of ludividu  
als. It will be an additional recommendation  
of particular manufactures,where the materials  
for them are extensively drawn jrom our agri­  
culture, and consequently impart and ensure  
to that great fund oj national prosperity and  
independence, an encouragement which cannot  
fail to be rewarded.  
  
Among the means of advancing the public in­  
terest, the occasion is a proper one for recalling  
the attention of Congress to the great impor­  
tance of establishing throughout our country  
the roads and canals which ran best be execut­  
ed. under the national authority. .No objects  
within the circle of political economy so richly  
repay the expense bestowed on them; there are  
none, the utility of which is more universally  
ascertained and acknowledged; none that do  
more honor to the government, whose wise and  
enlarged patriotism duty appreciates them, nor  
is there any country which presents a field,  
where Nature invites more the art of man, to  
complete her own work for his nccninmodatien  
and benefit. These considerations are strength-1  
ened, moreover, by the political effect of these  
facilities for intercommunication, in bringing  
and binding more closely together the nannies  
parts of our extended confederacy. Whilst the  
I States, individually, with a laudable enterprito  
I and emulation, avail themselves of their local  
! advantages, by new roads, by navigable to­  
। nals, and hv improving the streams susceptible  
of navigation, the general government is the  
more urged to similar undertakings, requiring  
a national jurisdiction, and national means, by  
the prospect of thus systematically completing  
so Inestimable a work.

number deemed to be sufficiently large, in view of the segregation of this coun-  
try from Europe, and the diminished strength of the Indian tribes. In his last  
message, dated 5th of December, 1815, Mr. Madison urged “ an enlargement of  
the Military Academy, and the establishment of others in other sections of the  
Union. If experience has shown, in the recent splendid achiev ments of the  
militia, the value of this resource for public defence, it has shown, also, the im-  
portance of that skillin the use of arms, and that familiarity with the essential  
rules of discipline, which cannot be expected from the regulations now in force.”  
  
During the sessions of Congressin 1815 and 1517, bills were introduced in the  
House of Representatives for creating additional military academies, which  
were not definitively acted upon. In 182) the army was further reduced to six  
thousand men. The act of this year, and that of 1815, authorized the retaining  
of the corps of engineers, as then organized.  
  
In the judgment of the committee, these legislative enactments in relation to  
the academy, considered in connexion with those in reiation to the army, clear-

Mr Madison in his message to Congress, De­  
cember 5, 1815, said—*ll is true, that the im-,  
proved condition of the public revenue will not  
only afford the neans of maintaining the faith  
of the government with its creditors _inviolate,  
and of prosecutiug successfully the measures of  
the most liberal policy, but will also Justify an  
immediate alleviation of the burdens inposed  
by the necessities of the war. It is, however,  
essential to every modification of the finances,  
that the benefit of an uniform national currency  
should be restored to the community. The ab­  
sence of the precious metals will, it is believed,  
be a temporary evil; but until they can be ren­  
dered again the general medium of exchange, it  
develves on the wisdom of Congress to provide  
a substilute, which shall equally engage the  
confidence, accommodate the wants of the cit­  
izens throughout the Union. If the operation  
of the State Banks cannot produce this result  
the probable operation of a National Bank w,i!l‘

«The arrangements of the finances, with a view to the receipts: and  
expenditures of a permanent peace establishment, will necessarily enter  
into the deliberations of Congress during the present session. It is true,  
that the improved condition of the public revenue will not only afford the  
means of maintaining the faith of the government with its creditors invio-  
late, and of prosecuting successfully the measures of the most liberal policy,  
but will also justify an immediate alleviation of the burdens imposed by  
the necessities of the war. Itis, however, essential to every modification  
of the finances, that the benefits of a uniform national currency should  
be restored to the community. The absence of the precious metals will,  
it is believed, be a temporary evil ; but, until they can again be rendered  
the general medium of exchange, it devolves on the wisdom of Congress  
to provide a substitute, which shall equally engage the confidence and ac-  
commodate the wants of the citizens throughout the Union. If the opera.  
tion of the state banks cannot produce this result, the probable operation  
of a national bank will merit consideration ; and if neither of these expe-

terms upon which the notes of the government (no longer required as an

Mr. Madison’s veto had been the cause of the defeat of the bank bill  
passed by the preceding Congress ; and as that great obstacle was removed  
by the a intimation of his message, and as the great majority of both  
parties had fallen into the opinion that a bank was necessary, it was not  
long before the committee had intimated to the government that they were  
in readiness to receive whatever plan the secretary of the treasury might

“Ae. Besides the condition which the theory itself implies, of a recip-  
~ rocal adoption by other nations, experience teaches that so many circum-  
stances must occur in introducing and maturing manufacturing establish-  
ments, especially of the more complicated kinds, that a country may  
remain long without them, although sufficiently advanced, and in some  
respects even peculiarly fitted, for carrying them on with success. Under  
circumstances giving a powerful impulse to manufacturing industry, it has  
made among us a progress, and exhibited an efficiency, which justify the  
belief that, with a protection, not more than is due to the enterprising cit-  
izens whose interests are now at stake, it will become, at an early day,  
not only safe against occasional competitions from abroad, but a source of  
domestic wealth, and even of external commerce. In selecting the  
branches more especially entitled to the public patronage, a preference is  
obviously claimed by such as will relieve the United States from a depend-  
ence on foreign supplies, ever subject to casual failures, for articles neces-  
sary for public defence, or connected with the primary wants of individuals.  
It will be an additional recommendation of particular manufactures where  
the materials for them are extensively drawn from our agriculture ; and  
consequently impart and insure, to that great fund of national prosperity  
and independence, an encouragement which cannot fail to be rewarded.”*  
The condition of the manufacturing interest, in truth, was such as  
loudly called for the sympathies of the legislature. During the war, a  
large portion of the capital of the country had been drawn from com.

 Congress.&quot;  
In his next Annual Messaee (&quot;December 5.  
  
1815), Mr. Madison thus confronts one of tho j  
World&#x27;s favorite theories: 1  
In adjusting the duties on imports to the  
object ol revenue, the l iflueii .e of the tariff on  
inanulacture will necessarily present Itself for  
consideration. However wise the theory may  
be which leaves to tho mgiictty and luterest of  
Individuals iko application of their industry  
and resources, there aro In tnls, as In all other  
cuses, exceptions to the general rule. Besides  
the condition which the theory Itself implies of  
a reciprocal adoption by other nations experi­  
ence teaches that so many circumstances must  
concur in Introducing and maturing manufac­  
turing establishments, especially of the more  
complicated 111 una, that a country may lontj  
remain without tbem, although K.itHciently ad­  
vanced, and in some respects even peculiarly  
fitted, for carrying them on with success.

against the tariff for protection? Was not one  
recommended by that great Democrat, friend  
adviser, successor of Thomas Jefferson, the  
man in whom this latter had so implicit a con  
fidence, he to whom all our sages and saints  
have looked up as a true and faithful ex­  
pounder of our party faith?  
&quot;I read in James Madison&#x27;s seventh annual  
message (Dec. 5, 1815), this clear and explicit  
statement regarding a protective tariff, and I  
am unable to believe it heresy for the present  
day disciples of that great man to demand  
that the party be not unfaithful to the idea  
embraced in his recommendation:  
In adjusting the duties on imports to the oblect of  
revenue the influence of the tariff on manufactures will  
necessarily present itself for consideration. However  
wise the theory may be which leaves to the sagacity and  
interest of individuals the application of their industry  
and resources, there are, in this as in other cases, excep­  
tions to the general rule. Besides the condition which  
the theory implies of a reciprocal adoption by other nae  
tions, experience teaches that so many circumstances  
must occur in introducing and maturing manufacturing  
establishments, especially of the more complicated  
kinds, that a country may remain long without them,  
although sufficiently advanced, and in some respects  
even peculfarly fitted for carrying them on with suc  
cess. Under circumstances giving a powerful impulse  
to manufacturing industry, it has made among us a  
progress, and exhibited an efficieney which justity the  
belief that with a protection not more than is due to the  
enterprising citizens whose interests are now at stake  
it will become at an early day not only safe against oo­  
casional competition from abroad, but a source of do­  
mestie wealth and even of external commerce

factures, and so expressed themselves in  
various messages to congress. In his  
seventh annual message Mr. Madison said :  
&quot;In adjusting the dnties on imports to  
tho object of rovenue, the influence of  
the tariff on manufactures will necessa­  
rily present itself for consideration.  
However wise the theory may bo which  
leaves to the sagacity and interest of in­  
dividuals the application of their indus­  
try and. resources, there are in this, as in  
all other cases, exceptions to tho general  
rule. Besides the condition which the.  
theory itself implies, of a reciprocal adop­  
tion by other nations, experience teaches  
that so many circumstances must concur  
in introducing and maturing manufac­  
turing establishments, especially of the  
more complicated kinds, that a country  
may long remain without them, although  
cufnciently advanced, and in some re­  
spects even peculiarly fitted for carrying  
them on with success.  
&quot;In selecting the branches more es­  
pecially entitled to public patronage, a  
preference is obviously claimed by such  
as will relieve tho United States from a  
dependence on foreign supplies, even  
subject to casual failures, for articles  
necessary for the public defense, or con­  
nected with the primary wants of indi­  
viduals. It will be an additional&#x27; recom­  
mendation for particular manufactures  
when the materials for them are exten­  
sively drawn from our -agriculture, and  
consequently imparts nd&#x27; insures to that  
great fund of national prosperity and in­

THE TARIFF OF 181C.  
From the time the first tariff act for  
the protection of American industries  
was passed by the first congress to the  
passage of the tariff of 1816, a number  
of acts were passed imposing duties  
upon imports, and designed for the  
protection of domestic industries, all of  
them affording encouragement to such  
industries.  
President Madison, in his message to  
congress, December 1, 1815, recom­  
mended encouragement to the manu­  
facturing interests. 1 He said:  
Under circumstances giving a power­  
ful impulse to manufacturing industry,  
it has made among us a progress and  
exhibited an efficiency which justify  
the belief that with protection not more  
than is due to the enterprising citizens  
whose interests are now at stake, it  
will become at an early day -not only  
safe against occasional competition  
from abroad, but a source of domestic  
wealth and of external commerce
