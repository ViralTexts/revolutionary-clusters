The proposed occupancy of New Orleans by Great Britain suggests a further precaution. Should possession be taken by her and the preliminary sum of 2 millions or any part of it be paid to France risks and disputes might ensue which make it adviseable to postpone the payment till possession shall be given to the United States or if this can not be done to obtain every possible security against eventual loss.  
As the question may arise how far in a state of war one of the parties can of right convey territory to a neutral power and thereby deprive its enemy of the chance of conquest incident to war especially when the conquest may have been actually projected it is thought proper to observe to you 1st that in the present case the project of peaceable acquisition by the United States originated prior to the war consequently before a project of conquest could have existed. 2dy that the right of a neutral to procure for itself by a bona fide transaction property of any sort from a belligerent power ought not to be frustrated by the chance that a rightful conquest thereof might thereby be precluded. A contrary doctrine would sacrifice the just interests of peace to the unreasonable pretensions of war and the positive rights of one nation to the possible rights of another. A restraint on the alienation of territory from a nation at war to a nation at peace is imposed only in cases where the proceeding might have a collusive reference to the existence of the war and might be calculated to save the property from danger by placing it in secret trust to be reconveyed on the return of peace. No objection of this sort can be made to the acquisitions we have in view. The measures taken on this subject were taken before the existence or the appearance of war and they will be pursued as they were planned with the bona fide purpose of vesting the acquisition forever in the United States.  
With these observations you will be left to do the best you can under all circumstances for the interest of your country keeping in mind that the rights we assert are clear that the objects we pursue are just and that you will be warranted in providing for both by taking every fair advantage of emergencies.  
For the course of information relating to the deposit at New Orleans I refer you to my letter of the 25 inst, to Mr. Livingston. I have the honor to be with great respect Gentl
