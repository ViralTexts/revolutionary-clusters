ength, notwithstanding the mediation of the Empress of Russia, the States General have published the following Manifesto. It is entitled the Counter Manifesto of the States General of the United Provinces of the Low Countries.If ever the annals of the world have furnished an example of a free and independent State hostilely attacked in the manner the most unjust and without the least appearance of justice or equity, by a neighboring power, long in alliance and strictly connected by ties founded upon common interest, it is without controversy, the republic of the United Provinces of the low countries, which finds itself in this case, in relation to His Majesty, the King of Great Britain and his Ministry.From the commencement of the troubles, arisen between that kingdom and its colonies in America, their High Mightinesses, by no means obliged to take the smallest part in them had formed the firm and invariable design, to adopt and to follow, in relation to the troubles, the system of the most perfect and the most exact neutrality. And when the same troubles, had afterwards enkindled a war, which extended itself to more than one power, and spread itself to more than one part of the world. Their High Mightinesses have constantly observed and maintained the same system, while at the same time they have not neglected to give on more than one occasion, and relative to most essential objects the most convincing proofs of their sincere disposition to satisfy the desires of H

 the said governor, to render an account of his conduct to their High Mightinesses, and whom they did not permit to return to his residence until after he had exculpated himself of all the accusations brought against him, by a justification of himself in detail; a copy of which was transmitted, without delay to the Minister of his Britannic Majesty. It was by means of these measures, that their High Mightinesses having always had it at heart to avoid giving the smallest cause of dissatisfaction to His Britannic Majesty, have constantly endeavored to entertain and to cultivate his friendship and good understanding.But the conduct of his Britannic Majesty towards the republic has been diametrically opposite.The troubles between the courts of London and Versailles had scarcely broken out when we saw the ports of England filled with Dutch ships, unjustly taken and detained. These vessels navigated under the faith of treaties; and were not loaded with other merchandizes, than with those which the express tenor of treaties declared free and lawful. We saw those free cargoes forced to submit to the laws of an arbitrary and despotic authority. The cabinet of St. James knowing no other rules than a pretended right of temporary conveniency, thought proper to appropriate these cargoes to the crown by a forced purchase, and to employ them to the profit of the royal navy. The representations the most energetic and the most serious, on the part of their High Mightinesses, against such proceedings, were to no purpose; and it was in vain that we demanded, in the strongest manner, the treaty of commerce which subsisted between England and the republic. By this treaty the rights and liberties of the neutral flag were clearly defined and stated.—The subjects of Great Britain had enjoyed the full advantage of this treaty in the first and the only case, in which it pleased the court of London to remain neuter, while the republic was at war. At present, in the reciprocal case, cannot, without the greatest injustice, refuse the enjoyment of the same advantages to the republic. And as little as his Britannic Majesty had

dering that it offered them a means of establishing the protection of the commerce of their subjects upon the most solid foundations; and opened a way to place their independence in safety from all infraction, without derogating in the least from the alliances contracted both with his Britannic Majesty, and with the other belligerent powers.But it is this same means, which the court of London has endeavored to take away from the republic, by proceeding with precipitation to extremities the most outrageous by the recall of her Ambassador, by the publication of a Manifesto, containing pretended grievances, and by granting letters of marque and of pretended reprisals, against the state, its subjects and their goods; by which this court has but too plainly discovered her designs long since formed, of laying aside the essential interest, which united the two nations, and of breaking the ties of ancient friendship, by attacking this state, by a war the most unjust.It will not be necessary to refute at length, the reasons and pretended griefs, alledged in the Manifesto, to convince every impartial man of their insolidity. It is sufficient to observe in a few words, relative to the offer made by his Britannic Majesty, to open friendly conferences, that it was the above mentioned treaty of Marine, which alone could make the object of

: that this treaty gives to neutral powers the right of transporting freely, in the ports of the belligerent powers, all sorts of naval stores: that the republic, proposing to itself no other end, and desiring of his Britannic Majesty no other thing, than the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the rights stipulated by this treaty, a point so evidently clear, and so incontestably just, could not become the object of a negotiation, or of a new convention derogatory to this treaty: so that their High Mightinesses could not persuade themselves, nor shew themselves disposed to renounce voluntarily, rights justly acquired, and to desist from these rights from regard to the court of England; a renunciation, which being advantageous to one of the belligerent powers, would have been little compatible with the principles of the neutrality; and by which their high Mightinesses, would have reposed on the other hand the safety of the state to dangers, which they were obliged carefully to avoid. A renunciation, moreover, which would have caused to commerce and navigation the principal support of the republic and source of her prosperity, and irreparable prejudice; since the different branches of commerce strictly connected with each other form an whole, whereof it is impossible to cut off so principal a part, without necessarily causing the destruction and ruin of the whole body: not to mention, that at the same time, that their High Mightinesses, made with reason a difficulty to accept the proposed conferences they have not a little modified and tempered the actual exercise of their right, by a provisional resolution.  
And as to what relates to the succours demanded, their High Mightinesses cannot dissemble, that they have never been able to conceive how his Britannic Majesty has thought that he could insist, with the least appearance of justice or of equity, upon the succour stipulated by the treaties, at a time when he had already beforehand, withdrawn himself from the obligation which those treaties imposed upon him towards the republic. Their High Mightinesses have not been less surprised to see, that, while the troubles in America and their direct consequences could not concern the republic in virtue of any treaty, and that the succor demanded had not been demanded until after the crown of Spain had augmented the number of belligerent powers. His Britannic Majesty has nevertheless taken the occasion of this event, to insist upon his demand with so much earnestness and such an ardor, as if his Majesty thought himself to have a right to  pretend and to maintain that a war once enkindled between him and any other power, was alone sufficient to oblige the State, to grant forthwith, and without any anterior examination, the succors stipulated. The republic, it is true, had obliged itself by the treaties to assist the  kingdom of Great Britain, at all times, when that kingdom should find itself attacked or threatened with an unjust war: and what is more, the r

rel with another power, judges proper to prefer the way of arms to that of a reasonable satisfaction, upon just complaints.It was not then by a spirit of party, or by the device of a predominant cabal, but after a mature deliberation, and in a sincere desire to maintain the most precious interests of the republic, that the States of the several respective Provinces, have all unanimously testified that they were of opinion, that the succor demanded ought to be refused in a manner the most polite; and their High Mightinesses would not have failed to have transmitted to his Britannic Majesty, conformable to these resolutions an answer to the repeated demands of succors, if they had not been prevented, by the violent and unheard of attack of the fleet of the State under the command of rear Admiral Byland; by the refusal to give satisfaction upon a point so grave; and by the declaration not less strange than unjust, which his Majesty thought fit to make, relative to the suspension of the treaties which subsisted between him and the republic: all, so many events, which by requiring deliberations of quite another nature, put an end to those which had taken place on the subject of the said requisition.It is in vain and contrary to all truth, that they have endeavored to multiply the number of grievances, by alledging the suppression of the duties of exportation, as a measure tending to facilitate the transportation of naval stores to France: for besides that this suppression forms an object, which regards the interior direction of commerce, to which all the sovereigns have an incontestable right, and whereof they are not obliged to give an account

fects.In regard to what has passed in the other parts of the world, the informations which their High Mightinesses have received from time to time, from the East Indies, are directly opposite to those which appear to have come under the eyes of his Britannic Majesty. The repeated complaints which the Directors of the East India Company have addressed to their High Mightinesses, and which the love of peace has made them stifle in their bosoms, are incontestable proofs of it. And the measures taken with regard to the W. Indies, enumerated heretofore, ought to serve in all times, as an irrefragable proof, of the sincerity, the zeal, and the attention, with which their High Mightinesses have taken it to heart to maintain in those countries, the most exact and the most strict neutrality.—And theirHhigh Mightinesses have never been able to discover, the smallest legal proof, of any infraction of their orders in this respect.As to what concerns the project of an eventual treaty of commerce with North America, conceived by a member of the government of the province of Holland, without any public authority; and the memorials presented upon this subject by Sir Joseph Yorke, the affair happened in the following manner.—As soon as the ambassador had presented the memorial of the tenth of November of the last year, their High Mightinesses, without stopping at expressions, little suitable among sovereigns with which this memorial was filled, did not delay to commence a deliberation the most serious upon this subject; and it was by their resolution of the 27th of the same month, that they  
did not hesitate to disavow and disapprove publicly all which had been done in this respect. After which they had all reason to expect that his Britannic Majesty would have acquiesced in this declaration, since he could not be ignorant that their High Mightinesses exercise no jurisdiction in the respective provinces, and that it was to the States of the provi

hat if he did not receive that day an answer entirely satisfactory, to his memorial, he should be obliged to inform his court of it, by express. Their High Mightinesses, informed of this declaration, penetrated the importance of it as manifesting visibly the measure already resolved in the counsel of the king: and although the established customs admit not of deliberations, upon verbal declarations of foreign ministers, they judged it nevertheless proper to depart from them upon this occasion, and to order their secretary to wait on Sir Joseph Yorke, and give him to understand that his memorial had been taken ad referendum, by the deputies of the respective provinces, conformably to received usages, and to the constitution of the government, adding what appears to have been omitted with design in the manifesto, that they would endeavor to compleat an answer to his memorial, as soon as possible, and as soon as the constitution of the government would permit. Accordingly a few days after the deputies of Holland, notified to the assembly of their High Mightinesses that the states of their province had unanimously resolved, to require the advice of their court of justice, on the subject of the demand of punishment, charging the said court to give their opinion, the soonest possible, laying aside all other affairs. Their High Mightinesses did not fail to transmit forthwith, this resolution to Sir Joseph Yorke. But what was not their surprise and their astonishment, when they learnt t

 the refusal of this ministry, threw an obstacle in the way of the execution of these orders.After this explanation of all the circumstances of this affair, the impartial public will be in a condition, to set a just value upon the principal motive, or rather pretext, which his Britannic Majesty has used, to let loose the reins of his designs against the republic. The affair reduces itself to this. His Majesty was informed of a negotiation, which should have taken place in the year 1778 between a member of the government of one of the provinces, and a representative of the American Congress, which negotiation would have had for its object, a project of a treaty of commerce to be concluded between the republic and the said colonies, casu quo, namely, in case the independence of these colonies should have been acknowledged by the crown of England. This negotiation, although conditional, and annexed to a condition which depended upon an act to be antecedently performed by his Majesty himself: this negotiation, which without this act, or this anterior declaration, could not produce the smallest effect, was taken in so ill part by his Majesty, and appeared to excite his discontent in such a degree, that he thought fit to require of the state a disavowal and a public disapprobation, as well as a compleat punishment and satisfaction. It was forthwith and without the least delay, that their High Mightinesses granted the first part of the requisition: but the punishment demanded was not in their power, and they could not agree to it without flying in the face of the fundamental constitution of the state. The states of the province of Holland were the only tribunal to which it belonged to take legal cognizance and to provide for the case, by the ordinary and regular ways. This sovereign, constantly attached to the maxims, which oblige it to respect the authority of the laws, and fully convinced, that the maintenance of the department of justice in all the integrity and impartiality, which are inseparable from it, ought to form one of the firmest supports of the supreme power: this sovereign, constrained by every thing that is most sacred, to defend and to protect the rights and the privileges of its subjects, could not forget itself to such a degree as to subscribe to the will of his Britannic Majesty, by giving a blow to these rights and privileges, and by overleaping the bounds prescribed by the fundamental laws of the government.—These laws required the intervention of the judiciary department; and this was accordingly the means which the said states resolved to employ, by requiring upon this object the advice of the court of justice established in their province. It is by following this course, that they have displayed before the eyes of his Britannic Majesty of the English nation and of all Europe, the unalter

nce of being able to complain of a denial of justice, they have prevented even to the smallest shadow or appearance of reason, which could authorize this court to use reprisals: to which nevertheless it has made no scruple to recur, in a manner equally odious and unjust.  
  
But while the state took measures so just and so proper to remove all subject of complaint; the measure, which was the epocha of the commencement of the rupture, had already been resolved and concluded in the counsel of the king. This counsel had resolved to try all sorts of means, to traverse and hinder, if it had been possible, the accession of the republic to the convention of the powers of the North: and the event has clearly demonstrated, that it is, in hatred and resentment of this convention, that the said court has suffered itself to be drawn in, to the part which it has been pleased to take against the republic.For these causes, and since, that after the repeated outrages and immense losses which the subjects of the republic must have sustained on the part of his Majesty the king of G. Britain, their High Mightinesses, find themselves moreover, provoked and attacked by his said Majesty, and forced to employ the means which they have in hand, to defend and avenge the precious rights of their liberty and independence: they assure themselves with the firmest confidence that the god of armies, the god of their fathers, who by the visible direction of his providence sustained and delivered their republic in the midst of the greatest dangers will bless the means

anfwer from the States Genera] tothe mani-  
fefto of .the Court of England is at laft  
made public, under the title of Centra-Ma-  
nifefto. , It cannot, fays the Gazétte Writer,  
but make a very ftrong impieffion on minds  
already ulcerated by the conduct of the cne-  
mies of the Republic. This interefting piece,  
is to the following purport :  
  
“ Tf ever the annals of the world have fur-  
nifhed an inftancé of a free and independent  
State being attacked by an enemy in the  
moft unjuftifiable manner, and without the  
leait appearance of right or enquiry, by.a  
neighbouring power, allied for a long time,  
and bound by ties founded on the bafis of  
common intereft; it is, without doubt, the  
Republic of the United States of the Nether  
lards, which finds itfelf in that cafe with  
his Majefty the King of Great Britain, and  
his Minifters. From the beginning of the  
difputes which had arifeii between that  
kingdom and its American Colonies, their  
H. M. no wife obliged to interfere, had taken  
the firm and determined refolution to adopt  
and ftriétly to adhere to the mott exaé neutra+

It ‘is by means of the above meafures that  
their H. M. always endeavouring to avoid  
giving the moft diftant grounds of diffatisfac-  
tion to his B. M. have conftantly ftrove to en-  
tertain and keep up friendihip and good har-  
mony.  
  
Bur the conduét of his B. M. towards the  
Republic has been diametrically oppofite.—  
The controverfy between the Courts of Lon-  
don and Verfailles had no fooner broke out,  
than the Englith ports were filled with Dutch  
thips, taken and detained. The faid thips  
were purfuing their navigation upon the faith  
of Treaties, and were laden with no other  
merchandize than that which is by treaty  
declared free and lawful—the cargoes were  
forced to be fubjeéted to the dictates of an  
arbitrary and defpotic authority. The Cabi-  
net of St. James’s, knowing no other rule  
than the pretended right of a temporary con-  
veniency, thought proper to appropriate thofe  
cargoes to the Crown by a compulfive pur-  
chafe, and to apply the fame to the ufe of  
the royal navy: the moft trgent and ferious  
remonftrances from their H. M. againft fuch  
proceedings, were difregarded. In vain was  
it for them to claim, in the moft pofitive  
manner, the obfervance of the Treaty of  
Commerce between England and the Repub-  
lic, By this treaty, the rights and liberties  
of the Neutral Flag were cleatly ftated and  
evinced. English tubjeéts had enjoyed all  
the advantages of the above treaty, in the  
firft and only inftance where the Court of  
London was pleafed te ftand neuter, whilft  
the Republic was at war. Now in a parallel  
eafe, the above court cov!d not, without the  
moft palpable injuftice, refufe the fame pri-  
vileges to the faid Republic; and by the  
fame rule that his B. M. had no right to fuf- -  
pend the effeéts of the above treaty to the  
difadvantage of their H. M. it was as ill  
founded to pretend to make them forfake

interefls which united the two nations, and  
of breaking off the former bond of friend-  
fhip, by levying againft thofe States the moft  
unjuttifiable war.  
  
It would be needlefs minutely to refute the  
reafons and pretended grievances alledged in

man of their futility. Let it fuffice to ob-  
ferve, in a few words, in regard to the ten-

ferences, that the Maritime Treaty above-  
mentioned could be their only obje&amp;: that  
the meaning of the faid treaty, expreffed in

doubt or equivocation ; that it intitles every  
neutral power to carry freely into the ports  
of the Belligerent States all kinds of naval  
fiorcs ; that their 11. M. aiming at, and dee  
firing nothing more of his B. M. than the  
quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the rights  
flipulated by the treaty ; a matter fo clearly  
evident, fo inconteftably juft, could not be  
the abje&amp; of a negotiation, or of a new con-

felves to betray any difpofition to give up

them through regard for the Court of Eng-  
land: a renunciation, which, being favour-

to fend it to Count Welderen their minifter  
at London, with orders to lay it immedi-  
ately before the minifter of his B.M. but  
the refufal of the latter created an obftacle  
to the execution of thofe orders.  
All the circumftances of this affair being

enabled to appreciate the principal motive,  
or rather pretence to which his B.M. has  
had recourfe in order to give a fcope to his

may reduce the whole matter; his majefty  
was informed of a nogotiation which would  
have taken place between a member of the  
government of one of the provinces, and a  
reprefentative of the American Congrefs ;  
which negotiation intended to lay the plan  
of a treaty of commerce to be concluded be-  
tween the Republic and the faid Colonies  
cafu quo, that is to fay, that in cafe the in-  
dependency of thofe Colonies fhould be ac-  
knowledged by the crown of England; this  
negotiation although conditional, and hold-  
ing by a claufe, which depended cn the an-  
terior act of his Majefty; this negotiation,  
which without the faid aé or anterior de-  
claration could not have the leaft effe&amp;t, was  
fo mifconftrued by his Majefty, and excited  
his difpleafure to fuch a degree, that he  
thought proper to require from the States a  
public difavowal and difapprobation, as well  
as a complete punifhment and fatisfaétion ; it  
was in confequence, and without the leaft  
delay, that their H.M. acceded to the firft  
part of his requifition; but the punifhment  
infifted upon was not within their power,  
and they could not affent to it without firik-  
ing at the root ef the fundamental conftitu-  
tion of the State. ~ The States of the pro-  
vince of Holland were the only oncs to  
which it pertained lawfully to take cogni-  
zance of it, and to provide thereto by the  
ordinary means, and the authority of the  
laws. This Sovereign State adhering to the

But thecondu&amp; of his B. M. towards

polite. —— The controveriy between the  
Courts of London and Vérfailles had no  
fooner broke out, than the Englith ports  
wete filled ‘with Dutch th&#x27;ps taken and  
detained : the faid fhips were purfuing their

were laden with no other merchandize than  
that which is by treaty declared free and  
lawful—the cargoes were forced to be fub-  
jected to the dictates of an arbitrary and  
defpotic authority. The Cabinet of St.  
James’s, knowing no other rule than the  
pretended right of a temporary convenien-  
c¥, thought proper to appropriate thofe  
cargoes to the Crown, by a compulfive  
purchafe, and apply the fame to the ufe of

publifhing a Manifefto replete with fup,

united the two nations, and of break-

foundation, and opened a way to fe-  
cure them independence from all en-  
croachinents, without forego! ing the  
engagements entered into, both ale  
his B. M. and the other balliersiat  
powers. ‘  
  
Yet of thefe very means the court of  
London has endeavoured to deprive the  
republic, by precipitately carr ying rmat  
ters to extremity, re abling its ambat-  
fador, publifhing a manitefto, r plete  
with fuppofed grievances, and granting  
letters of marque and pretended repi-  
fails againft the States, their fubjects,  
and thew property, By this con wists  
that court has but too pl: linly ¢ inced  
its long concerted plan of fetting site  
the effential intereft which united the  
  
two nations, and of tanger off the.  
  
former bond of friend‘hip, by levying  
againit thole flates the moh. unjutiifable

It would be needilefs minutely to re-  
fute the realons and pretendal gricv-  
ances alledged in the mianifeilo, to  
convince every impartial man of their  
futility. Let it fuiiice to obferve, ina  
few words, in regard to tlie tender  
made by his B, M. to open amicable  
conferences, that the maritime treaty  
above inentioned could be their only  
object: that the meaning of the faid

Jic will be enabled to appreciate the  
principal motive, or rather pretence to  
which his B. M. has had recourfe in  
order to give a {cope to his defigns  
againf the republic. To this we may  
veduce the whole matter; his majelty  
was informed of a negociation which  
would have taken place between a mem-  
ber of the government of one of the  
provinces, and a reprefentative of the  
American Congrefs ; which negociation  
intended to lay the plan of a treaty of  
commerce to be concluded between the  
republic and the faid colonies cafe quo,  
that is to fay, in cafe the inde-  
pendency of thofe colonies thould be  
acknowledged by the crown of En-  
giand: this negociation although con-  
  
ditional, and holding by a claufe, which  
depended on the anterior a&amp; of his ma-  
jelty ; this negociation, which without  
  
the faid act or anterior declaration  
could not have the leaft effe&amp;t, was fo  
mifconftrued by his majefty, and ex-  
cited his diipleafure to fuch a degree,  
that he thought proper to require from  
the States, a public difavowal and dif-  
approbation, as well as a complete pu-  
nifhment and fatisfaétion; it was in  
confequence, and without the leaft de-  
Jay, that their H. M. acceded to the  
firft part of his requifition; but the  
punifhment infifted upon was not in  
their power, and they could not affent to  
it, without ftriking at the root of the  
fundamental conttitution of the ftate.  
The fates of the province of Holland  
were the only ones to which it per-  
tained lawfully to take cognizance of it,  
and to provide for it by the ordinary  
means, and the authority of the laws.  
This tovereign ftate adhering to the  
maxims which oblige them to refpect

to iubmit to the willof his B. M. by at-  
tempting to overturn thofe rights and pri-
