Your favour of the 2d instant has prescribed a dismal plan, which I was never very well calculated to execute, but am now wholly incapable. I can write nothing which will not be suspected of personal vanity, local prejudice or Provincial &amp; State partiality. However, as I hold myself responsible, at this age, to one only tribunal in the Universe, I will give you a few hints at all hazards.  
As Mr: Hancock was sick and confined Mr Bowdoin was chosen at the head of the Massachusetts delegation to Congress. His relations thought his great fortune ought not to be hazarded. Cushing, too Adams’s and Paine, all destitute of fortune; four poor Pilgrims, proceeded in one Coach; were escorted through Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey into Pennsylvania. We were met at Frankfort by Dr Rush, Mr Mifflin, Mr Bayard and several others of the most active Sons of Liberty, in Philadelphia, who desired a conference with us. We invited them to take Tea with us in a private apartment. They asked leave to give us some information and advice, which we thankfully granted. They represented to us that the friends of Government in Boston and in the Eastern States, in their correspondence with their friends in Pennsylvania and all the Southern States, had represented us as four desperate adventurers. Mr Cushing was a harmless kind of man, but poor and wholly dependent upon his popularity for his subsistence. Mr Samuel Adams was a very artful designing man, but desperately poor and wholly dependent on his popularity with the lowest vulgar for his living. John Adams and Mr Paine were two young Lawyers of no great talents reputation or weight, who had no other means of raising themselves into consequence but by courting popularity. We were all suspected of having Independence in view. Now, said they, you must not utter the word Independence, nor give the least hint or insinuation of the idea, neither in Congress or any private conversation; if you do you are undone; for the idea of Independence is as unpopular in Pennsylvania and in all the middle and Southern States as the Stamp Act itself. No Man dares to speak of it. Moreover, you are the Representatives of the suffering State. Boston and Massachusetts are under a rod of Iron. British fleets and Armies are tyranizing over you; you yourselves are personally obnoxious to them and all the friends of government.  
You have been long persecuted by them all:—Your feelings have been hurt; your passions excited; you are thought to be too warm, too zealous, too sanguine, you must be therefore very cautious. You must not come forward with any bold measures; you must not pretend to take the lead. You know Virginia is the most populous State in the Union. They are very proud of their antient Dominion, as they call it; they think they have a right to take the lead, and the Southern States and middle States too, are too much disposed to yield it to them. This was plain dealing, Mr Pickering, and I must confess, that there appeared so much wisdom and good sense in it, that it made a deep impression on my mind, and it had an equal effect on all my Colleagues. This conversation and the principles facts and motives suggested in it, have given a colour complection and character to the whole policy of the United States, from that day to this. Without it, Mr: Washington would never have commanded our armies, nor Mr: Jefferson have been the Author of the declaration of Independence, nor Mr: Richard Henry Lee  the mover of it; nor Mr: Chase the mover of foreign connections.  
If I have ever had cause to repent of any part of this policy, that repentance ever has been and ever will be unavailing. I had forgot to say; nor had Mr: Johnston ever have been the nominator of Washington for General.

zardous and uncertain such a desperate measure might be.  
It soon became rumoured about the City that John Adams was for Independence; the Quakers &amp; Proprietary Gentlemen, took the alarm; represented me as the worst of men, the true-blue Sons of Liberty pitied me; all put me under a kind of Coventry.

he trial of Preston and the Soldiers, in Boston.  
You enquire why so young a man as Jefferson was placed at the head of the Committee for preparing a declaration of Independence? I answer, it was the Frankfort advice, to place Virginia at the head of everything. Mr: Richard Henry Lee, might be gone to Virginia, to his sick family, for aught I know, but that was not the reason of Mr: Jefferson’s appointment. There were three Committees appointed at the same time. One for the declaration of Independence; another for preparing Articles of Confederation; and another for preparing a Treaty to be proposed to France. Mr Lee was chosen for the Committee of confederation, and it was not thought convenient that the same person should be upon both. Mr Jefferson came into Congress in June 1775. and brought with him a reputation for literature, science, and a happy talent at composition. Writings of his were handed about remarkable for the peculiar felicity of expression. Though a silent member in Congress, he was so prompt, frank, explicit and decisive upon Committees, not even Saml Adams was more so, that he soon seized upon my heart, and upon this occasion I gave him my vote and did all in my power to procure the votes of others. I think he had one more vote than any other, and that placed him at the head of the Committee. I had the next highest number and that placed me the second. The Committee met, discussed the subject, and then appointed Mr: Jefferson &amp; me to make the draught; I suppose, because we were the two highest on the list. The Sub-Committee met; Jefferson proposed to me to make the draught. I said I will not; You shall do it. Oh No! Why will you not? You ought to do it. I will not. Why? Reasons enough. What can be your reasons? Reason 1st. You are a Virginian, and Virginia ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason 2d. I am obnoxious, suspected and unpopular; You are very much otherwise. Reason 3d: You can write ten times better than I can. “Well,” said Jefferson, “if you are decided I will do as well as I can.” Very well, when you have drawn it up we will have a meeting. A meeting we accordingly had and conn’d the paper over. I was delighted with its high tone, and the flights of Oratory with which it abounded, especially that concerning Negro Slavery, which though I knew his Southern Bretheren would never suffer to pass in Congress, I certainly never would oppose. There were other expressions, which I would not have inserted if I had drawn it up; particularly that which called the King a Tyrant. I thought this too personal, for I never believed George to be a tyrant in disposition and in nature; I always believed him to be deceived by his Courtiers on both sides the Atlantic, and in his Official capacity only, Cruel.  
I thought the expression too passionate and too much like scolding for so grave and solemn a document; but as Franklin and Sherman were to inspect it afterwards, I thought it would not become me to strike it out. I consented to report it and do not now remember that I made or suggested a single alteration. We reported it to the Committee of Five. It was read and I do not remember that Franklin or Sherman criticized any thing. We were all in haste; Congress was impatient and the Instrument was reported, as I believe in Jefferson’s hand writing as he first drew it. Congress cut off about a quarter part of it, as I expected they would, but they obliterated some of the best of it and left all that was exceptionable, if any thing in it was. I have long wondered that the Original draft has not been published. I suppose the reason is the vehement Phillipic against Negro Slavery. As you justly observe, there is not an idea in it, but what had been hackney’d in Congress for two years before. The substance of it is contained in the declaration of rights and the violation of those rights, in the Journals of Congress in 1774. Indeed, the essence of it is contained in a pamphlet, voted and printed by the Town of Boston before the first Congress met; composed by James Otis, as I suppose—in one of his lucid intervals, and pruned and polished by Saml: Adams.

from a letter of Mr Adams to Mr Pickering, dated August the  
sixth, 1822, containing the most particular statement, we believe,  
that has been furnished on this subject.  
  
‘Mr Jefferson came into Congress in June 1775, and brought  
with him a reputation for literature, science, and a happy talent  
at composition. Writings of his were handed about, remarkable  
for the peculiar felicity of expression. ‘Though a silent member  
in Congress, he was so prompt, frank, explicit, and decisive upon

Cushing was a harmless kind of man, but poor, and wholly dependent on his po  
larity for his subsistence. Mr. Samuel Adams wasa very artful, designing man,  
desperately poor, and wholly dependent on his popularity with the lowest vulgar

talents, reputation, or weight, who had no other means of raising themselves into  
consequence, than by courting popularity.’ We were all suspected of having in-  
dependence in view. * Now,’ said they, ‘you must not utter the word independence,  
nor give the least hint or insinuation of the idea, either in Congress or any private  
conversation ; if you do, you are undone ; for the idea of independence is as unpopu-  
lar in Pennsylvania, and in all the Middle and Southern States, as the Stamp Act  
itself. Noman dares to speak of it. Moreover, you are the representatives of the  
suffering State. Boston and Massachusetts are under a rod of iron. British fleets  
and armies are tyrannizing over you; you yourselves are personally obnoxious to  
them and all the friends of government ; you have been long persecuted by them  
all; your feelings have been hurt, your passions excited ; you are thought to be too  
warm, too zealous, too sanguine. You must be, therefore very cautious; you must  
not come forward with any bold measures, you must not pretend to take the lead,  
You know Virginia is the most populous state in the Union. They are very proud

of Mr. Jefferson over the minds of the members, through the  
channels of private intercourse, was early felt. ‘Though a  
silent member,” (said one of his co- patriots,+) “he was so  
prompt, frank, explicit, and decisive upon Committees—not  
even Samuel Adams was more so—that he soon seized my  
heart.” On the great occasion which had now arrived, all this  
influence was successfully put forth; and while Adams was  
sustaining the Declaration with the strength of his impassioned

resources of an unrivalled personal influence.  
  
In September, 1776, Mr. Jefferson was appointed Minister  
to France; but the situation of his family compelled him to  
decline the appointment; and the same cause requiring his  
presence at home, led him to resign his seat in Congress. He

SIR:—Your favor of the 2d instant has prescribed a dismal plan, which I was never very well  
calculated to execute but I am now utterly incapable. I can write nothing which will not be sus­  
pected of personal vanity, local prejudice, or Provincial and State partiality. However, as I hold  
myself responsible at this age, to one only tribunal in the universe, I will give you a few hints at  
all events.  
  
As Mr. Hancock was sick and confined, Mr. Bowdoin was chosen at the head of the Massachu­  
setts delegation to Congress. His relations thought his great fortune ought not to be hazarded.  
Cushing, two Adamses, Paine, all destitute of fortune, four poor pilgrims, proceeded in one coach,  
were escorted through Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, into Pennsylvania!  
We were met at Frankfort by Dr. Rush, Mr. Mifliin, Mr. Bayard, and several other of the most ac­  
tive sons of liberty in Philadelphia, who desired a conference with us. We invited them to take  
tea with us in a private apartment. They asked leave to give us some information and advice,  
which we thankfully granted. They represented to us that the friends of government in Boston  
and in the Eastern States, in their correspondence with their friends in Pennsylvania and all the  
Southern States, ha represented us as four desperate adventurers. Mr. Cushing was a harmless  
kind of man, but poor, and wholly dependent on hia popularity for his subsistence. Mr. Samuel  
Adams was a very artful, designing man, but desperately poor, and wholly dependent on his popu­  
larity with the lowest vulgar for his living. John Adams and Mr. Paine were two young lawyers,  
of no great talents, reputation, or weight, who had no other means of raising themselves into con&#x27;  
sequence, than by courting popularity.&quot; &quot;We were all suspected of having independence in view.  
Now, said they, you must not utter the word independence, nor give the least hint or insinuation  
of the idea, either in Codgress or any private conversation if you do, you arc undone for the  
idea of independence is  
as unpopular  
in Penn.,  
and in all the Middle and  
  
Act itself. No man dares to speak of it. Moreover, you are the representatives of the suffering  
State. Boston and Massachusetts are under a rod of iron. British fleets and armies are tyrannizing  
over you you yourselves are personally obnoxious to them and all the friends of government  
you have been long persecuted by them all your feelings have been hurt, your passions excited  
you are thought to be too warm, too zealous, too sanguine. You must be, therefore, very cau­  
tious you must not come forward with any bold measures, you must not pretend to take the lead.  
You know Virginia is the most populousState in the Union. They are very proud of their ancient

We have little to add to the account given in  
the Tribune of yesterday morning of the outra­  
ges upon the Chicago Emigrants at Lexington.  
When the boat arrived at that place, they found  
awaiting there a large force of armed men to  
give them a reception. In addition to those 011

artillery were stationed on the steam ferry boat,

Middle States too, ate too much disposed to yield it to them.&quot;  
This was plain dealing, Mr. Pickering and I must confess that there appeared so much wisdoaa  
and good sense in it, that it made a deep impression ou my mind, and it had an equal effect on Ml  
mv colleagues.  
  
This conversation, an-&#x27; principles, facts, and motives, suggested in it, havt given a color,  
complexion, and character, to the whole polk&#x27;? of the L&#x27;nited States, from that day to this.  
You inquire why so young a man as Mr. Jefferson was placed at the head ot&quot; the Committee to  
preparinga Declaration of Independence? I answer It was the Frankfort advice, to place Vtr|l­  
nia at the head of every thing.  
  
Mr. Jefferson came into Congress, in June, 1775, aud brought with him a reputation for htetto  
ture, science, and a happv talent of composition. Writings of his were banded about, remarkatm  
for the f*culiar felicity of expression. Though a silent member in Congress, he was so prompt  
frank, explicit, and decisive upon committees and in conversation, not even Samuel Adams ws•  
more so so, that he soon seized upon my heart and upon this occasion 1 gave him my vote, and  
did all in my power to procure the votea of others. I think he had one more than any other, and  
that placed him at the head of the committee. 1 had the next highest number, and that placid  
me tho second. The cotamittee met, diacusscd the subject, and then appointed Mr. Jefferson and  
me to make the draught, I suppose because we were the two first on the list.  
  
The sub-committee met. Jsfferson proposed tome to make the draught. I said, &quot;I will  
not.&quot; You should do it.&quot; &quot;Oh! no.&quot; &quot;Why will you not? You ought to do it.&quot; &quot;1 will  
not.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Reasons enough.&quot; What can be your reasons Reason first—You arc  
a Virginian, and a Virginian ought v appear at the head of this business. Keason second—I am  
obnoxious suspected, and unpopular. V01 are vcrv much otherwise. Reason third—You caa  
write ten times better than 1 can.&quot; W et,&quot; Sa&#x27;nl Jefferson, if you are decided, I will do aa well  
as I can.&quot; Vcry well. When you have dr.to-, it

Adams, though Jefferson wrote in 1823 that there was no

in 1822, when Adams was 86, and to Madison when Jefferson

To THE EDPTOR OF THE SUN- Sir: The diss  
cussion over the authorship of the Declaration of Inde  
pendence is a very old one. Some sentences are open to  
dispute, but of the main I am of the same opinion as  
Daniel Webster, who, when delivering a funeral culogy­  
on Adams and Jefferson, said: &quot;As a composition, the  
Declaration is Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s. It is the production of his  
mind, and the high honor of it belongs to him, clearly  
and absolutely  
As regards Mr. Jeffersons ability to draft such a docu  
ment, nothing more is needed than the following letter of  
lohn Adams to Timothy Pickering, Aug. 6, 1822  
Mr. Jefferson came into Congress in June, 1775, and  
brought with him a reputation for literature, science  
and a happy talent of composition. Writings of his were  
handed about, remarkable for their peculiar felicity of  
expression

the preparation of the Declaration of Inde­  
pendence:&quot;The subcommittee met. Jefferson pro­  
posed to me to make the draft. I raid, &#x27;1  
will not. &#x27; &#x27; You should do it, &#x27; said ho.  
&#x27;Oh, no,&#x27; said I. &#x27;Why?&#x27; said he. &#x27;Rea­  
sons enough,&#x27; said I. &#x27;What can be your  
reasons?&#x27; said he. &#x27;Reason first, &#x27; said I,  
&#x27;you are a Yirginian, and a Virginian  
ought to appeal- at the head of this busi­  
ness. Iveason second I am obnoxiou;  
bad slip in the use of that word, JVIr.  
Adams, suspected, unpopular. You are  
very much otherwise. Reason third you  
can write ten Aimes better than I can.&#x27;  
&#x27;Well,&#x27; said Jefferson, &#x27;if you are decided,  
I will do as well as I can.&#x27; &#x27;Very well,&#x27;  
BJiid I, &#x27;when you have drawn it up, wc  
will have a meet ing. &#x27; A meeting we ac­  
cordingly hud and conned the paper over.  
I was delighted with its high tone and the  
flights of oratory with which it alxnmded,  
especially that concerning negro slavery,  
which, though I knew his southern breth­  
ren would never allow to pass, I certainly  
never would oppose. There were other ex­  
pressions whieii I would not have inserted  
if I had drawn it up, particularly that  
which called the king &#x27;tyrant. &#x27; I thought  
this too personal, for I never believed  
George to be a tyrant in disposition and  
nature. I thought the expression too pas­  
sionate and too much like scolding for so  
grave and solemn a document, but as  
Franklin c.i:d Sherman were to inspect it  
afterward I thought it would not become  
me to strike it out We reported it to the  
committee of five. It was read, and I do  
not remember that Franklin or Sherman  
criticised anything. We were all in haste.  
Congress was impatient, and theinstrument-  
was reported, as I believe, in Jeffer­  
son&#x27;s hand eritir.p. as he fi rst drew it. Con­  
gress cut off about a quarter of it, as I ex­  
pected they would, but they obi i tela ted  
some of the best of it and left all that was  
exceptionable, if anything in it was. I  
have long wondered this in IS.-.&#x27;-Jl that the  
original draft- has never been published. I  
suppose the reason is the vehement philip­  
pic against negro slavery.&quot;  
This account brings tis as near to the  
facts in the preparation of the Declaration  
as we shall ever arrive. It may be of in­  
terest to add that when the Declaration  
was reported to the house, Mr. John Han
