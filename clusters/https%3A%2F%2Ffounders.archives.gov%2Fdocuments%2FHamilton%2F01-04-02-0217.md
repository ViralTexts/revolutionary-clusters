.  
There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this; and there is perhaps none, which has been inveighed against with less candor, or criticised with less judgment.  
  
Here the writers against the Constitution seem to have taken pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation, calculating upon the aversion of the people to monarchy, they have endeavoured to inlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the intended President of the United States; not merely as the embryo but as the full grown progeny of that detested parent. To establish the pretended affinity they have not scrupled to draw resources even from the regions of fiction. The authorities of a magistrate, in few instances greater, and in some instances less, than those of a Governor of New-York, have been magnified into more than royal prerogatives. He has been decorated with attributes superior in dignity and splendor to those of a King of Great-Britain. He has been shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow, and the imperial purple flowing in his train. He has been seated on a throne surrounded with minions and mistresses; giving audience to the envoys of foreign potentates, in all the supercilious pomp of majesty. The images of Asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have scarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated scene. We have been almost taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering janizaries; and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio.  
Attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure, or it might rather be said, to metamorphose the object, render it necessary to take an accurate view of its real nature and form; in order as well to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance, as to unmask the disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit resemblances which have been so insidiously as well as industriously propagated.  
In the execution of this task there is no man, who would not find it an arduous effort, either to behold the moderation or to treat with seriousness the devices, not less weak than wicked, which have been contrived to pervert the public opinion in relation to the subject. They so far exceed the usual, though unjustifiable, licenses of party-artifice, that even in a disposition the most candid and tolerant they must force the sentiments which favor an indulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to give place to a voluntary and unreserved indignation. It is impossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and deception upon the gross pretence of a similitude between a King of Great-Britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that of the President of the United States. It is still more impossible to withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients which have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition.  
In one instance, which I cite as a sample of the general spirit,

f he be able, justify or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of truth and to the rules of fair dealing.  
The second clause of the second section of the second article empowers the President of the United States “to nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not in the Constitution otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law.” Immediately after this clause follows another in these words—“The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.” It is from this last provision that the pretended power of the President to fill vacancies in the Senate has been d

connection of the clauses and to the obvious meaning of the terms will satisfy us that the deduction is not even colorable.  
The first of these two clauses it is clear only provides a mode for appointing such officers, “whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the Constitution, and which shall be established by law;” of course it cannot extend to the appointment of senators; whose appointments are otherwise provided for in the Constitution,

and who are established by the Constitution, and will not require a future establishment by law. This position will hardly be contested.  
The last of these two clauses, it is equally clear, cannot be understood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the Senate, for the following reasons—First. The relation in which that clause stands to the other, which declares the general mode of appointing officers of the United States, denotes it to be nothing more than a supplement to the other; for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method of appointment in cases, to which the general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of appointment is confided to the President and Senate jointly, and can therefore only be exercised during the session of the Senate; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in session for the appointment of officers; and as vacancies might happen in their recess, which it might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently intended to authorise the President singly to make temporary appointments “during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which should expire at the end of their next session.” Secondly. If this clause is to be considered as supplementary to the one which precedes, the vacancies of which it speaks must be construed to relate to the “officers” described in the preceding one; and this

Attempts of an extravagant character are being  
made to disfigure, or rather to metamorphose  
the object of the contest, now presented to the  
consideration of the people, which render it  
necessary that we should take an accurate view  
of its real nature and form, in order to ascertain  
its true aspect and genuine appearance, to un­  
mask the disingenuousness, and to expose the  
counterfeit representations which have been so  
insidiously, as well as industriously, circulated  
in connection with the pending election. In  
the execution of this work there is no man  
who would not find it an arduous effort either  
to behold with moderation, or to treat with  
seriousness, the devices which have been re­  
sorted to. They so far exceed the usual,  
though unjustifiable, licenses of party artifices,  
that even a disposition the most candid and tol­  
erant must modify the sentiments which form  
an indulgent construction of the conduct of  
political adversaries, to give place to a voluntary  
and unreserved indignation. It is impossible  
not to denounce the deliberate imposture and  
deception upon the gross pretence that in eleva­  
ting independent men to office you thereby puri­  
fy the political atmosphere. It is still more im­  
possible to withhold that imputation, from the  
absurd and barefaced expedients which have  
been employed to give success to the attempted  
imposition, that men liberated from party obli­  
gations will ensure more fidelity and ability in  
the discharge of their duties. Hence, the writers  
against the whig party seem to have taken pains  
to signalize their talents at misrepresentation.  
Calculating on the aversion of the people to the  
elevation of men to office who recognize party  
obligations, they have endeavored to enlist all  
these jealouses and apprehensions in opposition  
to the ascendancy of thewhig party, to break  
up their organization, and thus secure a tri

it to be nothing more than a supplement to the other, for the puspese of  
establishing an anriliary method of appointment, in cases to which the

confided to the President and Senate josntty, and can therefure only be
