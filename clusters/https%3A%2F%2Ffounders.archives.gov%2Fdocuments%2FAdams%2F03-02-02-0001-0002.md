ll day, as indeed all the Students, must be, by Law, unless, excused by a Tutor. The President preach’d two Sermons from Micah VI. 6, 7, 8. Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old. Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of Rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first born for my transgression, the fruit of my body, for the sin of my soul? He hath shewed thee O man what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? It is certainly a most noble Subject, and we had 2 good Sermons upon. That in the afternoon especially, I thought excellent. No flowers of rhetoric, no Eloquence, but plain common Sense, and upon a liberal plan. But the President has by no means a pleasing Delivery. He appears to labour, and struggle very much, and sometimes strains very hard. And mak­ing faces, which do not render his harsh countenance, more agreeable.

A Declamation to be spoken on Wednesday June 7th. 1786.  
“Varro, the most learned of the Romans, thought, since Nature is the same wherever we go, that this single circumstance was sufficient to remove all objections to change of Place, taken by itself and stripped of the other inconveniences which attend exile. M. Brutus, thought it enough, that those, who go into banishment cannot be hindered from carrying their Virtue along with them. Now, if any one judge that each of these comforts is in itself insufficient, he must however confess that both of them joined together, are able to remove the terrors of exile. For, what trifles must all we leave behind us be esteemed, in comparison of the two most precious things which men can enjoy, and which we are sure, will follow us wherever we turn our steps, the same Nature, and our proper Virtue? Believe me, the providence of God, has established such an order in the World, that of all which belongs to us the least valuable parts can alone fall under the will of others. Whatever is best is safest; lies out of the reach of human power; can neither be given nor taken away. Such is this great and beautiful work of nature, the world. Such is the mind of man, which contemplates and admires the world whereof it makes the noblest part. These are inseparably ours, and as long as we remain in one we shall enjoy the other. Let us march therefore intrepidly wherever we are led by the course of human accidents. Wherever they lead us, on what coast soever we are thrown by them, we shall not find ourselves absolutely strangers. We shall meet with men and women, creatures of the same figure, endowed with the same faculties, and born under the same laws of nature. We shall see the same Virtues and Vices, flowing from the same general Principles, but varied in a thousand different and contrary modes, according to that infinite variety of laws and customs which is established for the same universal end, the preservation of Society. We shall feel the same revolution of Seasons, and the same Sun and Moon will guide the course of our year. The same azure vault, bespangled with stars will be every where spread over our heads. There is no part of the world from whence we may not admire those planets which roll, like ours, in different orbits round the same central Sun; from whence we may not discover an object still more stupendous, that army of fixed Stars, hung up in the immense Space of the Universe, innumerable Suns, whose beams, enlighten and cherish the unknown worlds which roll around them; and whilst I am ravished by such contemplations as these, whilst my soul is thus raised up to heaven, it imports me little what ground I tread upon.”

“ Such is the mind of man which contem¬  
plates and admires the world whereof it  
makes the noblest part. Let us march there¬  
fore intrepidly wherever we are led by the  
course of human accidents. Wherever they  
lead us, on what coast soever we are throvvn,  
by them we shall not find ourselves strangers.  
We shall meet with men and women, crea¬  
tures of the same figure, endowed with the  
same faculties and born under the same laws  
of nature. We shall see the same virtues  
and vices flowing from the same general  
principles, but varied in a thousand different  
and contrary modes, according to that infinite  
variety of laws and customs which is estab¬  
lished for the same universal end, the preser¬  
vation of society. We shall feel the same  
revolutions of the seasons^ and the same sun  
and moon will guide the course of our year.  
The same azure vault bespangled with stars  
^ull be every where spread over our heads.  
There is no part of the world from whence  
we may not admire those planets which roll  
.like-ours in different orbits round the same  
central sun ; from whence we may not dis-  
. cover an object still more stupendous that an  
army-of fixed stars hung up in the immense  
space of the universe, innumerable suns  
whose beams enlighten and cherish the un¬  
known w&#x27;orld which roll round them ; and  
whilst I am ravished by such contemplations  
as these—whilst my soul is thus raised up to  
heaven, it imports but little what ground 1  
&#x27;tread upon.”

Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten

There speaks the very spirit of heathen religion. It is the voice  
of the unenthralled worshiper seeking the direction of a humanly  
organized infallibility. How does the prophet answer it? “ He  
hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord  
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk

Believe me, the providence of God has established  
such an order in the world, that of all which belongs to  
us, the least valuable parts can alone fall under the  
will of others. Whatever is best is safest; lies out of  
the reach of human power; can neither be given nor  
taken away. Such is this great and beautiful work of  
Nature, the world. Such is the mind of man, which  
contemplates and admires the world whereof it makes  
the noblest part. These are inseparably ours, and as  
long as we remain in one, we shall enjoy the other.  
Let us march therefore intrepidly wherever we are led  
by the course of human accidents. Wherever they lead  
us, on what coast soever we are thrown by them, we  
shall not find ourselves absolutely strangers. We shall  
feel the same revolution of seasons, and the same sun  
and moon will guide the course of one year. The  
same azure vault, bespangled with stars, will be every-  
where spread over our heads. There is no part of the  
world from whence we may not admire those planets  
which roll like ours, in different orbits round the same  
central sun; from whence we may not discover an ob-  
ject still more stupendous, that army of fixed stars hung  
up in the immense space of the universe, innumerable  
suns, whose beams enlighten and cherish the unknown  
worlds which roll around them, all bound together by  
invisible bands of attraction that hold them all in their  
places; and while I am ravished by such contempla-  
tions as these, while my soul is thus raised up to  
heaven, it imports me little what ground I tread upon
