he 13 Colonies, Independent States  
During the discussions of this solemn Act, a Committee consisting of a member from each colony had been  
appointed, to prepare &amp; digest a form of Confederation, for the future management of the Common interests, which  
had hitherto been left to the discretion of Congress, guided by the exigencies of the contest, and by the known intentions  
or occasional instructions of the Colonial Legislatures.  
It appears that as early as the 21st. of July 1775, A plan entitled &quot;Articles of Confederation &amp; perpetual Union of the Colonies&quot; had been sketched by Docr. Franklin, The plan being on that  
day submitted by him to Congress; and tho’ not copied into their Journals remaining on their files in his handwriting. But  
notwithstanding the term &quot;perpetual&quot; observed in the title, the articles provided expressly for the event of a return of  
the Colonies to a connection with G. Britain.  
This sketch became the basis for the plan reported by the Come. on the 12 of July, now also remaining on  
the files of Congress, in the handwriting of Mr. Dickinson. The plan, tho’ dated after the Declaration of Independence,  
was probably drawn up before that event; since the name of Colonies, not States is used throughout the draught. The

 The first was the Case of the Crown lands, so called because they had  
been held by the British Crown, and being ungranted to individuals when, its authority ceased, were considered by the  
States within whose charters or asserted limits they lay, as devolving on them; whilst it was contended by the others,  
that being wrested from the dethroned Authority, by the equal exertions of all, they resulted of right and in equity to  
the benefit of all. The lands being of vast extent and of growing value, were the occasion of much discussion &amp;  
heart-burning; &amp; proved the most obstinate of the impediments to an earlier consummation of the plan of federal

. The dispute was happily compromised by successive surrenders of portions  
of the territory by the States having exclusive claims to it, and acceptances of them by Congress.  
The other source of dissatisfaction was the peculiar situation of some of the States, which having no  
convenient ports for foreign commerce, were subject to be taxed by their neighbors, thro whose ports, their commerce was  
carryed on. New Jersey, placed between Phila. &amp; N. York, was likined to a Cask tapped at both ends: And N.  
Carolina, between Virga. &amp; S. Carolina to a patient bleeding at both Arms. The Articles of Confederation provided  
no remedy for the complaint; ’which produced a strong protest on the part of N. Jersey; and never ceased to be a source of  
dissatisfaction &amp; discord, until the new Constitution, superseded the old.  
But the radical infirmity of the * &quot;Arts. of Confederation&quot;, was the dependance of Congs, on the voluntary and  
simultaneous compliance with its Requisitions, by so many independent Communities, each consulting more or less its  
particular interests &amp; convenience and distrusting the compliance of the others. Whilst the paper emissions of  
Congs. continued to circulate they were employed as a sinew of war, like gold &amp; silver. When that ceased to be the  
case,  the fatal defect of the political System was felt

re for the embarrassments. The States relieved from the pressure of foreign  
danger, and flushed with the enjoyment of independent and sovereigh power; (instead of a diminished disposition to part  
with it), persevered in omissions and in measures incompatible with their relations to the Federal Govt. and with those  
among themselves;  
Having served as a member of Congs. through the period between Mar. 1780 &amp; the arrival of peace in  
1783, I had become intimately acquainted with the public distresses and the causes of them. I had observed the successful  
opposition to every attempt to procure a remedy by new grants of power to Congs. I had found moreover that despair of  
success hung over the compromising provision of April 1783. for the Public necessities, which had been so elaborately  
planned, and so impressively recommended to the States.* Sympathizing, under this aspect of  
affairs, in the alarm of the friends of free Govt, at the threatened danger of an abortive result to the great &amp;  
perhaps last experiment in its favour, I could not be insensible to the obligation to co-operate as far as I could in  
averting the calamity. With this view I acceded to the desire of my fellow Citizens of the County that I should be one of  
its representatives in the Legislature, hoping that I might there best contribute to inculcate the critical posture to  
which the Revolutionary cause was reduced, and the merit of a leading agency of the State in bringing about a rescue of  
the Union and the blessings of liberty staked on it, from an impending catastrophe.

It required but little time after taking my seat in the House of Delegates in May 1784. to discover that

t by a Committee of the whole. The Resolution introduced by Mr. Tyler an influential  
member, who having never served in Congress, had more the ear of the House than those whose services there exposed them to  
a imputable bias, was so little acceptable that it was not then persisted in. Being now revived by him, on the last day of  
the Session, and being the alternative of adjourning without any effort for the crisis in the affairs of the Union, it  
obtained a general vote; less however with some of its friends from a confidence in the success of the experiment than  
from a hope that it might prove a step to a more comprehensive &amp; adequate provision for the wants of the  
Confederacy  
It happened also that Commissioners appointed by Virga. &amp; Maryd. to settle the jurisdiction on waters  
dividing the two States had, apart from their official reports, recommended a uniformity in the regulations of the 2  
States on several subjects &amp; particularly on those having relation to foreign trade. It apeared at the time that

reasons would require that of their neighbors. So apt and forceable an illustration of the necessity of a u

But in the interval between the proposal of the Convention, and the time of its meeting such had been the  
advance of public opinion in the desired direction, stimulated as it had been by the effect of the contemplated object, of  
the Meeting, in turning the general attention to the Critical State of things, and in calling forth the sentiments and

stulations of members of Congs. deputed to her Legislature, than  
a mere repeal of the law, without a compliance. (see letter of Grayson to J. M.*  
The want of Authy. in Congs. to regulate Commerce had produced in Foreign nations particularly G. B. a  
monopolizing policy injurious to the trade of the U. S. and destructive to their navigation; the imbecility and  
anticipated dissolution of the Confederacy extinguishg all apprehensions of a Countervailing policy on the part of the U.  
States.  
The same want of a general power over Commerce, led to an exercise of the power separately, by the States,  
wch not only proved abortive, but engendered rival, conflicting and angry regulations. Besides the vain attempts to  
supply their respective treasuries by imposts, which turned their commerce into the neighbouring ports, and to co-erce a  
relaxation of the British monopoly of the W. Inda. navigation, which was attempted by Virga. (see Journal of ) the  
States having ports for foreign commerce, taxed &amp; irritated the adjoining States, trading thro’ them, as N. Y.  
Pena. Virga. &amp; S–Carolina. Some of the States, as, Connecticut, taxed imports as from Massts higher than  
imports even from G. B. of wch Massts. complained to Virga. and doubtless to other States (see letter of J. M. In  
sundry instances, as of N. Y. N. J. Pa. &amp; Maryld. (see ). The navigation laws treated the Citizens other  
States as aliens.  
In certain cases the Authy. of the Confederacy was disregarded, as in violation not only of the Treaty of  
peace; but of Treaties with France &amp; Holland, which were complained of to Congs.  
In other cases the Fedl. Authy. was violated by Treaties &amp; wars with Indians, as by Geo: by troops  
raised &amp; kept up, witht. the consent of Congs. as by Massts by compacts witht. the consent of Congs. as between  
Pena. and N. Jersey, and between Virga. &amp; Maryd. From the Legisl: Journals of Virga. it appears, that a vote  
refusing to apply for a sanction of Congs. was followed by a vote agst. the communication of the Compact to Congs.  
In the internal administration of the States a violation of Contracts had become familiar in the form of  
depreciated paper made a legal tender, of property substituted for money, of Instalment laws, and the occlusions of the  
Courts of Justice; although evident that all such interferences affected the rights of other States, Relatively creditor,  
as well as Citizens Creditors within the State  
Among the defects which had been severely felt was that of a uniformity in cases requiring it, as laws of  
naturalization &amp; bankruptcy, a Coercive authority operating on individuals and a guaranty of the internal tranquility of  
the States.  
As natural consequence of this distracted and disheartening condition of the union, The Fedl. Authy. had  
ceased to be respected abroad, and dispositions were shewn there, particularly in G. B, to take advantage of its  
imbecility, and to speculate on its approaching downfall: At home it had lost all confidence &amp; credit; the  
unstable and unjust career of the States had also forfeited the respect &amp; confidence essential to order and good  
Govt., involving a general decay of confidence &amp; credit between man &amp; man. It was found moreover, that those least partial to  
popular Govt. or most distrustful of its efficacy were yielding to anticipations, that from an increase of the confusion  
a Govt. might result more congenial with their taste or their opinions; Whilst those most devoted to the principles and  
forms of Republics, were alarmed for the cause of liberty itself, at stake in the American Experiment, and anxious for a  
system that wd. avoid the inefficacy of a mere confederacy without passing into the opposite extreme of a consolidated  
govt. It was known that there were individuals who had betrayed a bias towards Monarchy (see Knox to G. W. &amp; him to  
Jay) (Marshall’s life) and there had always been some not unfavorable to a partition of the Union into several  
Confederacies; either from a better chance of figuring on a Sectional Theatre, or that the Sections would require stronger  
Govts. or by their hostile conflicts lead to a monarchical consolidation. The idea of a dismemberment had recently made  
its appearance in the Newspapers.

harter the remedy that was provided.  
As a sketch on paper, the earliest perhaps  of a Constitutional Govt. for the Union (organized into the  
regular Departments with physical means operating on individuals) to be sanctioned by the people of  
the States, acting in their original &amp; sovereign character, was contained in a letter of Apl. 8.  
1787 from J. M.  to Govr. Randolph, a copy of the letter is here inserted.  
The feature in the letter which vested in the general Authy a negative on the laws of the States, was  
suggested by the negative in the head of the British Empire, which prevented collisions between the parts &amp; the  
whole, and between the parts themselves. It was supposed that the substitution, of an elective and responsible authority  
for an hereditary and irresponsible one, would avoid the appearance even of a departure from the principle of  
Republicanism. But altho’ the subject was so viewed in the Convention, and the votes on it were more than once equally  
divided, it was finally &amp; justly abandoned. However practicable &amp; expedt. such a negative in the Govt. of a State on the lawmaking powers of Corporations, not sufficiently controuled by the General laws of the State, from evasions or violations of its authy. executed before they could be judicially &lt;...&gt; as other objections &lt;...&gt; as liable among so many States encreasing in number &amp; form and enacting each of them so many laws.  Instead of the proposed negative, agst. the objects of it were left as finally provided for in the Constitution.  
On the arrival of the Virginia Deputies at Philada. it occurred to them that from the early and prominent  
part taken by that State in bringing about the Convention some initiative step might be expected from them. The  
Resolutions introduced by Governor Randolph were the result of a Consultation on the subject; with an understanding that  
they left all the Deputies entirely open to the lights of discussion, and free to concur in any alterations or  
modifications which their reflections and judgments might approve. The Resolutions as the Journals shew became the basis  
on which the proceedings of the Convention commenced, and to the developments, variations and modifications of which the  
plan of Govt. proposed by the Convention may be traced.  
The curiosity I had felt during my researches into the History of the most distinguished Confederacies,  
particularly those of antiquity, and the deficiency I found in the means of satisfying it more especially in what related  
to the process, the principles, the reasons, &amp; the anticipations, which prevailed in the formation of them,  
determined me to preserve as far as I could an exact account of what might pass in the Convention whilst executing its  
trust, with the magnitude of which I was duly impressed, as I was with the gratification promised to future curiosity by  
an authentic exhibition of the objects, the opinions &amp; the reasonings from which the new System of Govt. was to  
receive its peculiar structure &amp; organization. Nor was I unaware of the value of such a contribution to the fund  
of materials for the History of a Constitution on which would be Staked the happiness of a people great even in its  
infancy, and possibly the cause of liberty throughout the world.  
In pursuance of the task I had assumed I chose a seat in front of the presiding member, with the other  
members on my right &amp; left hands. In this favorable position for hearing all that passed, I noted in terms legible  
&amp; in abbreviations &amp; marks intelligible to myself what was read from the Chair or spoken by the members;  
and losing not a moment unnecessarily between the adjournment &amp; reassembling of the Convention I was enabled to  
write out my daily notes (see page 8) during the session or within a few finishing days after its close, in the extent and form,  
preserved in my own hand on my files.  
  
[The rest is transcribed from John C. Payne’s hand and taken from Writings of James Madison (Hunt edition), vol. 2, pages  
391-412]: In the labor and correctness of this I was not a little aided by practice, and by a familiarity with the  
style and the train of observation and reasoning which characterized the principal speakers. It happened, also, that I was  
not absent a single day, nor more than a casual fraction of an hour in any day, so that I could not have lost a single  
speech unless a very short one.  
It may be proper to remark, that, with a very few exceptions, the speeches were neither furnished, nor  
revised, nor sanctioned, by the speakers, but written out from my notes, aided by the freshness of my recollections. A  
further remark may be proper, that views of the subject might occasionally be presented, in the speeches and proceedings,  
with a latent reference to a compromise on some middle ground, by mutual concessions. The exceptions alluded to were,  
first, the sketch furnished by Mr. Randolph of his speech on the introduction of his propositions, on the twenty-ninth day  
of May; secondly, the speech of Mr. Hamilton, who happened to call on me when putting the last hand to it, and who  
acknowledged its fidelity, withour suggesting more than a very few verbal alterations which were made; thirdly, the speech  
of Gouverneur Morris on the second day of May, which was communicated to him on a like occasion, and who acquiesced in it  
without even a verbal change. The correctness of his language and the distinctness of his enunciation were particularly  
favorable to a reporter. The speeches of Doctor Franklin, excepting a few brief ones, were copied from the written ones  
read to the Convention by his colleague, Mr. Wilson, it being inconvenient to the Doctor to remain long on his feet.  
Of the ability and intelligence of those who composed the Convention the debates and proceedings may be a  
test; as the character of the work which was the offspring of their deliberations must be tested by the experience of the  
future, added to that of nearly half a century which has passed.  
But whatever may be the judgment pronounced on the competency of the architects of the Constitution, or  
whatever may be the destiny of the edifice prepared by them, I feel it a duty to express my profound and solemn  
conviction, derived from my intimate opportunity of observing and appreciating the views of the Convention, collectively  
and individually, that there never was an assembly of men, charged with a great and arduous trust, who were more pure in  
their motives, or more exclusively or anxiously devoted to the object committed to them, than were the members of the  
Federal Convention of 1787, to the object of devising and proposing a constitutional system which should best supply the  
defects of that which it was to replace, and best secure the permanent liberty and happiness of their country

“On the arrival of the Virginia deputies at Philadelphia, it occurred to them that  
from the early and prominent part taken by,that State in bringing about the Con-

duced by Governor Randolph were the result of a consultation on the subject, with  
an understanding that they left all the deputies entirely open to the lights of discus-  
sion, and free to concur in any alterations or modifications which their reflections  
and judgments might approve. The resolutions, as the journals shew, became the  
basis on which the proceedings of the Convention commenced, and to the develope-

Convention may be traced.  
  
“ The curiosity I had felt during my researches into the history of the most dis-  
tinguished confederacies, particularly those of antiquity, and the deficiency I found  
in the means of satisfying it, more especially in what related to the process, the  
principles, the reasons, and the anticipations which prevailed’ in the formation

acterized the principal speakers. It happened also that I was not absent a single

lost a single speech, unless a very short one.  
  
“Tt may be proper to remark, that with a very few exceptions, the speeches were  
neither furnished, nor revised, nor sanctioned by the speakers, but written out from  
my notes, aided by the freshness of my recollections. A further remark may be  
proper, that views of the subject might occasionally be presented in the speeches and  
proceedings with a latent reference to a compromise on some middle ground, by  
mutual concessions. The exceptions alluded to, were, Ist, the sketch furnished by  
Mr. Randolph, of his speech on the introduction of his propositions on the twenty-  
ninth day of May. 2d. The speech of ‘Mr. Hamilton, who happened to call on me

on a like occasion, and who acquiesced in it without a verbal change. The correct-  
ness of his language and the distinctness of his enunciation were particularly favor-  
able to a reporter. The speeches of Dr. Franklin, excepting a few brief ones, were  
copied from the written ones read to the Convention by his colleague, Mr. Wilson,  
it being inconvenient to the Doctor to remain long on his feet.

of their deliberations must be tested by the experience of the future, added to that  
of nearly half a century which has passed.  
  
“ But whatever may be the judgment pronounced on the competency of the archi-  
tects of the Constitution, or whatever may be the destiny of the edifice prepared by  
them, I feel it a duty toexpress my profound and solemn conviction derived from  
my intimate opportunity of appreciating the views of the Convention, collectively  
and individually, that there never was an assembly of men, charged with a great  
and arduous trust, who were more pure in their motives, or more exclusively or  
anxiously devoted to the object committed to them, than were the members of the  
Federal Convention of 1787, to the object of devising and proposing a constitutional  
system which would best supply the defects of that which it was to replace, and  
best secure the permanent liberty and happiness of their country.

within a few days after its close, in the extent and form preserved in my  
own hand on my files.  
  
In the labour and correctness of this I was nota little aided by practice,  
and by a familiarity with the style and the train of observation and rea-  
soning which characterized the principal speakers. It happened, also,  
that I was not absent a single day, nor more than a casual fraction ef an  
hour in any day, so that [ could not have lost a single speech, unless a very  
  
hort one.  
  
It may be proper to remark, that, with a very few exceptions, the  
| Speeenes were neither furnished nor sanctioned by the speakers, but writ-  
| ten out from my notes, aided by the freshness of my recollections. A fur-  
| ther remark may be proper, that views of the subject might occasionally  
| be presented in the speeches and proceedings with a latent reference to a  
|| compromise on some middle ground ,by mutual concessions. The exe  
| ceptions alluded to were, Ist, the sketch furnished by Mr. Randolph of  
his speeches on the introduction of his propositions of the 29th of May;  
2dly, the speech of Mr. Hamilton, who happened to call on me when put-  
ting the last hand to it, and who acknowledged its fidelity without sug-  
gesting more than a few verbal alterations, which were made; 3dly, the  
speech of Governor Morris on the 2d of May, which was communicated  
to him on a like occasion, and who acquiesced in it without a verbal  
change. The correctness of his language, and the distinctness of his  
enunciation, were particularly favourable toa reporter. The speeches of  
Dr. Franklin, excepting a few brief ones, were copied from the written ones

to the Doctor to remain long on his feet.  
  
Of the ability and inte!ligence of those who composed the Convention  
the debates and proceedings may be a test, as the character of the work  
which was the offspring of their deliberations must be tested by the ex-  
perience of the future, added to that of nearly half a century which has  
passed. ;  
  
But whatever may be the judgment pronounced on the competency of  
the architects of the constitution, or whatever may be the destiny of the  
edifice prepared by them, I feel it a duty to express my profound and  
solemn cunviction derived from my intimate opportunity of appreciating  
the views of the Convention, collectively and individually, that there never  
was an assembly of men, charged witha great and arduous trust, who  
were more pure in their motives, or more exclusively or anxiously devoted  
to the object committed to them, than were the memoers of the Federal  
Convention of 1787, to the object of devising and proposing a con-  
stitutional system which would best supp!y the defects of that which it  
was to replace, and best secure the premanent liberty and happiness of their

«On the arrival of the Virginia depu-  
ties at Philadelphia, it occurred to them  
that from the early and prominent part  
taken by that State in bringing about the  
Convention, some initiative step might  
be expected from them. The resolutions  
introduced by Governor Randolph were  
the result of a consultation on the sub-  
ject, with an understanding that they left  
all the deputies entirely open to the lights  
of discussion, and free to concur in any  
alterations or modifications which their  
reflections and judgment might approve.  
The resolutions, as the journals show,  
became the basis on which the proceed-  
ings of the Convention commenced, and  
to the developments, variations, and mo-  
difications of which the plan of govern-  
ment proposed by the Convention may be  
traced.  
  
“The curiosity I had felt during my  
researches into the history of the most  
distinguished confederacies, particularly  
those of antiquity, and the deficiency  
which I found in the means of’ satisfying  
it,---more especially in what related to  
the process, the principles, the reasons  
and anticipations which prevailed in the  
formation of them,---determined me to pre-  
serve, as far as I could, an exact account  
of what might pass in the Convention,  
whilst executing its trust, with the mag-  
nitude of which I was duly impressed, as  
I was by the gratification promised to fu-  
ture curiosity by an authentic exhibition  
of the objects, the opinions, and the rea-  
sonings from which the new system of  
government was to receive its peculiar  
structure and organization. Nor was I  
unaware of the value of such a contribu-  
tion to the fund of materials for the his-  
tory of a constitution on which would be  
staked the happiness of a people, great  
even inits infancy, and possibly the cause  
of liberty throughout the world.  
  
“ In pursuance of the task I had as-  
sumed, I chose a seat in front of the pre-  
siding member, with the other members  
on my right and left hands. In this fav-  
orable position for hearing all that passed,  
I noted, in terms legible and in abbrevia-  
tions and marks intelligible to myself,  
what was read from the chair or spoken  
by the members; and, losing not a moment  
unnecessarily, between the adjournment  
and re-assembling of the Convention I  
was enabled to write out my daily notes  
during the session, or within a few finish-  
ing days after its close, in the extent and  
form preserved in my own hand and on  
my files.  
  
* In the labor and correctness of this I  
was not a little aided by practice, and by  
a familiarity with the style and the train  
of observation and reasoning which char-  
acterized the principal speakers. It hap-  
pened also that I was not absent a single  
day, nor more than a casual fraction of  
an hour in any day, so that I could not  
have lost a single speech, unless a very  
short one.  
  
* Tt may be proper to remark that,with  
a very few exceptions, the speeches were  
neither furnished, nor revised, nor sanc-  
tioned by the speakers, but written out  
from my notes, aided by the freshness of  
my recollections. A farther remark may  
be proper, that views of the subject might  
occasionally be presented in the speeches  
and proceedings, with a latent reference  
to a compromise on some middle ground,  
by mutual concessions. The exceptions  
alluded to were,---first, the sketch fur-  
nished by Mr. RanpotrH of his speech  
on the introduction of his propositions or

the 29th day of May; secondly, the  
speech of Mr. HamiLTon, on the 18th  
of June, who happened to call upon  
me when putting the last hand to it,  
and who acknowledged its fidelity, with-  
out suggesting more than a very few ver-  
bal alterations, which were made ; third-  
ly, the speech of GouverNeuR Morris

to the Debates, that “the feature in  
these letters, which vested in the gen-  
eral authority a negative on the laws  
of the States, was suggested by the  
negative in the head of the British  
empire, which prevented collisions be-  
tween the parts and the whole, and  
between the parts themselves. It was  
supposed, that the substitution of an  
elective and responsible authority, for  
an hereditary and irresponsible one,  
would avoid the appearance even of a  
departure from republicanism. But,  
although the subject was so viewed in  
the convention, and the votes onit were  
more than equally divided, it was  
finally and justly abandoned, as, apart  
from other objections, it was not prac-  
ticable among so many States, increas-  
ing in number, and enacting, each of  
them, so many laws. Instead of the  
proposed negative, the objects of it  
were left as in the Constitution.”

confidence may be reposed ia reports prepared  
under such circumstances by such a hand  
T.he curiosity.l had felt during myjesearches  
into the history of the meet distinguished -con.&#x27;  
federacies, particularly those of antiquity, and the:  
deficiency I found in the means of satisfying it,  
more especially in &quot;What related &#x27;to tho process;  
the principles, the reasons, and the anticipations  
which prevailed in the&quot; formation of them, deter­  
mined me to preserve, as far as I could, an exact  
account of what might pass in the Convention  
whilst executing its trust, with the magnitudef  
which I was duly impressed, as I was by the  
gratification promised to future curiosity by an  
authentic exhibition of the objects, the opinions,  
and the reasonings from which the , new system  
of government was to receive ha peculiar struc­  
ture and organization. ; Nor was I unaware of  
such a contribution to the fund of materials for  
the history of a Constitution on which, would be  
staked the happiness of a people great even in  
its infancy, and possibly the cause of liberty  
throughout the world. ,  
In pursuance of the task 1 had assumed, I  
chose a seat in .front of the presiding member,  
with the other members on my right and left  
hands. In this favorable position for hearing all  
that passed, I noted in terms legible, and in abbre­  
viations and marks intelligible to myself, what was  
read from the Chair or spoken by the members ;  
and losing not a moment unnecessarily between  
the adjournment and re-assembling of the Con­  
vention, I was enabled to write out my daily notes  
during the session, or within a few days after its  
close, in the extent and form preserved in my  
own hand on my files. -; , &#x27;  
. In the labor and correctness of this I was not  
a little aided by practice, and by a familiarity with  
the style and the train of observation and reason­  
ing which characterized the principal speakers.  
It happened, also, that I was not absent a single  
day, nor more than a casual fraction of an hour  
in any day, so that I could not have lost a single  
speech, unless a very ehort one.&quot; -  
It may be proper to remark, that, with a very  
few exceptions, Tihe . speeches were neither  
furnished nor sanctioned by Jhe speakers,&quot; but  
written out from my notes, aided by the freshness  
of my recollections. A further remark may be  
proper, that views of the subject might occasion­  
ally be presented in the speeches and proceedings  
with a latent reference to a compromise on some  
middle ground, by mutual concessions. The ex­  
ceptions alluded to were, 1st, the sketch furnished  
by Mr. Randolph of his speeches on the introduc­  
tion of his propositions of the 29ifi of May ; 2dly,  
the speech of Mr. Hamilton, who happened to call  
on me when putting the last hand to it, and who  
acknowledged its fidelity without suggesting more  
than a few verbal alterations, which were mad? ;  
3dly, the speech of Governor Morris on the 2nd  
of May, which was communicated to him on a  
like occasion, and who acquiesced iu it without  
a verbal change. The correctness of his lan­  
guage, and the distinctness of his enunciation,  
were particularly favorable to a reporter. The  
speeches of Dr. Franklin, excepting a few brief  
ones, were copied from the written ones read to  
the Convention by his colleague, Mr. Wilson, it  
being inconvenient to the Doctor to remain long  
on his feet.  
Of the ability and intelligence of those who  
composed the Convention the debates and pro­  
ceedings may be a test, as the character of the  
work which was the offspring of their delibera­  
tions must be tested by the experience of the fu­  
ture, added to that of more than half a century  
which has passed.  
But whatever may be the judgment pronounced  
on the competency of the architects of the Con­  
stitution, or whatever may be the destiny of the  
edifice prepared by them, I. feel it a duty to ex­  
press my profound aid solemn conviction derived

Madison’s introduction to the debates of the convention. “The same want  
of a general power over commerce, (he observes) led to an exercise of the  
power separately by the states, which not only proved abortive, but engen-  
dered rival, conflicting and angry regulations. Besides the vain attempts to  
supply their respective treasuries by imposts, which turned their commerce  
into the neighbouring ports, * * * the states having ports for foreign  
commerce taxed and irritated the adjoining states trading through them.”  
“Tn sundry instances, the navigation laws treated the citizens of other states  
as aliens.” ‘New Jersey, placed between Philadelphia and New York, was  
likened to a cask tapped at both ends; and North Carolina, between Virginia  
and South Carolina, to a patient bleeding at both arms.”  
  
What could be more disastrous or more lamentable than a return to these  
interfering, unneighbourly, and intolerable exactions of the states? The  
Union itself was ormed, and the constitution was adopted, for the express  
purpose of closing up for ever these sources of animosity and discord, an

be staked the happiness of a people, great even in its infancy,

Speaking of the defects of the confederation, at the  
opening of the Convention, Edmund Randolph remarked,  
That the Government could not defend itself against the en-­  
croachments of the States, and that it was not even paramount  
to the State Constitutions, ratified, as it was, in many of the  
States.  
Madison, also a member of the Convention, said,  
That the radical infirmity in the articles of confederation  
was the dependence of Congress on the voluntary and simul­  
taneous compilance with its requisitions by so many indepen-­  
dent communities, each consulting, more or less, its particular  
interests and convenience, and distrusting the compliance of  
others.  
Mason observed:  
Not only that the present confederation was deficient in not  
providing for coercion and punishment against delinquent  
States, but argued, very cogently, that punishment could not,  
in the nature of things, be executed on the States collectively;  
and, therefore, that such a government was necessary a

assailed the honor and the union of the States and the peace-  
ful relations of the nation with foreign powers.  
  
“ The Federal authority had ceased to be respected abroad,  
and dispositions were shown there, particularly in Great Britain,  
to take advantage of its imbecility, and to speculate on its ap-  
proaching downfall. At home it had lost all confidence and  
credit ; the unstable and unjust career of the States had also  
forteited the respect and confidence essential to order and good  
government, involving a general decay of confidence and cre-  
dit between man andman. It was found, moreover, that those  
least partial to popular government, or most distrustful of its  
efficacy, were yielding to anticipations that, from an increase  
of the confusion, a government might result more congenial  
with their taste or their opinions; whilst those most devoted  
to the principles and forms of republics were alarmed for the  
cause of liberty itself, at stake in the American experiment,  
and anxious for a system that would avoid the inefficiency of a  
mere confederacy, without passing into the opposite extreme of  
a consolidated government. It was known that there were indi-  
viduals who had betrayed a bias towards monarchy, and there  
had always been some not unfavorable to a partition of the  
Union into several confederacies, either from a better chance  
of figuring on a sectional theater; or, that the sections would  
require stronger governments; or, by their hostile configets,  
lead to a monarchical consolidation. The idea of dismember-  
ment had recently made its appearance in the newspapers.”

“ But,” says Madison, “in the interval between the propo-  
sal of the convention, and the time of its meeting, such had  
been the advance of public opinion in the desired direction,  
stimulated as it had been by the effect of the contemplated  
object of the meeting, in turning the general attention to the  
critical state of things, and in calling forth the sentiments and  
exertions of the most enlightened and intelligent patriots, that  
the convention, thin as it was, did not scruple to decline the  
limited task assigned it, and to recommend to the States a con-  
vention with powers adequate to the occasion. Nor had it  
been unnoticed that the commission of the New Jersey depu-  
tation had extended its object to a general provision for the  
exigencies of the Union. A recommendation for this enlarged

Mr. Madison, from whose narrative of those earlier days  
Mr. Kent derived much of the material for his description,  
gives in his Introduction to the Debates of the Federal Con-  
vention a truly gloomy picture of the position of affairs.  
“The radical defect,” he says, “fof the ‘Articles of Confedera-  
tion’ was the dependence of Congress on the voluntary and  
simultaneous compliance with its requisitions by so many in-  
dependent communities, each consulting more or less its par-  
ticular interest and convenience, and distrusting the compli-  
ance of the others.” ‘‘ The States, relieved from the pressure  
of foreign danger, and flushed with the enjoyment of inde-  
pendent and sovereign power, persevered in omissions and in  
measures incompatible with their relations to the federal gov-  
ernment, and with those among themselves.” ‘I observed  
successful opposition to every attempt to procure a remedy  
by new grants of power to Congress, . . . notwithstanding  
the urgent demands of the federal treasury, the glaring inade-  
quacy of the authorized mode of supplying it, the rapid  
  
  
  
* Kent’s Com.  
  
  
  
Sec. 10.  
  
  
  
47 () FARRAR ON THE CONSTITUTION. (July,  
  
growth of anarchy in the federal system, and the animosity  
kindled among the States by their conflicting regulations.”*  
In specifying evils, he sayst : ‘‘ The authority of the confede-  
racy was disregarded as in violation of (foreign) treaties; by  
  
treaties and wars with Indians; by troops raised and kept up  
  
without the consent of Congress; by compacts (between States)  
without the consent of Congress.” ‘‘ In the internal adminis-  
tration of the States, a violation of contracts had become fami-  
liar”—there “ was a want of uniformity in cases requiring it, as  
laws of naturalization and bankruptcy; (and) of a coercive au-  
thority operating on individuals.” ‘The federal authority  
had ceased to be respected abroad. At home, it had lost all  
confidence and credit.” ‘* The idea of dismemberment had  
made its appearance in the newspapers.”

placed General Washington at the head

a proof of the deep interest he felt in the
