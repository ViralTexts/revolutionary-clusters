Dear Sir,  
Hd Qrs [Preakness] Octr 20th 1780.  
  
The plan proposed for taking A——d (the out lines of which are communicated in your letter whh was this moment put into my hands without a date—has every mark o⟨f⟩ a good one—I therefore agree to the promised rewards, and have such entire confidence in your management of the business as to give it my fullest approbation; and leave the whole to the guidance of your own judgment, with this express stipulation &amp; pointed injunction, that he A——d is brought to me alive.  
  
No circumstance whatever shall obtain my consent to his being put to death—The idea which would accompany such an event would be that ruffians had been hired to assasinate him. My aim is to make a public example of him—and this should be strongly impressed upon those who are employed to bring him off.  
The Sergeant must be very circumspect—too much zeal may create suspicion—and too much precipitancy may defeat the project. The most inviolable secrecy must be observed on all hands. I send you five guineas; but I am not satisfied of the propriety of the Sergeants appearing with much Specie—This circumstance may also lead to suspicion as it is but too well known to the enemy that we do not abound in this article.  
The interviews between the party in, and out of the City, should be managed with much caution and seeming indifference, or else the frequency of their meetings &amp;ca may betray the design &amp; involve bad consequences—but I am perswaded you will place every matter in a proper point of view to the conductors of this interesting business—&amp; therefore I shall only add that I am Dr Sir Yr Obt &amp; Affece Servt

Dear Sir,  
The plan proposed far taking A—d  
(the outlines of which are communi­  
cated in your letter wh’ch was this  
moment put into my hands without  
a date)—has every mark of a good  
one—l therefore agree to the prom­  
ised rewards, and have such entire  
confidence in your management of  
the business as to give it my fullest  
approbation ; and leave the whole to  
the guidance of your &lt;swn judgment,  
with this expressed stipulation &amp;  
pointed injunction, that he A—d is  
bi ought to me alive.  
No circumstances whatever Shall  
obtain my consent to his being put  
to death—the idea which would ac­  
company such an event would be that  
ruffians had been hired to assassin­  
ate him,—my aim is to make a pub­  
lic example of him—and this should  
be strongly impressed upon thope  
who are employed to bring him off.  
The sergeant must be very circum­  
spect—too much zeal may create sus­  
picion, and too much precipitancy  
may defeat the project. The most  
inviolable secrecy must bo observed  
on all hands.—l send you five  
Guineas; but I am not satisfied of  
the propriety of the sergeants ap­  
pearing with such Specie. This cir­  
cumstance may also lead to suspicion  
as it is but too well known to the  
en°my that we do not abound in this  
article.  
The interviews between the party  
in, and out of the city, should be  
managed with much caution and  
seeming indifference, or else the fre­  
quency of their meeting, &amp;c., may  
betray the sign and involve ba*. con­  
sequence, but I am persuaded you  
will place every matter in a proper  
point of view to the conductors of  
this interesting business,—&amp; there­  
foie I shall only add that I am

At 3 o&#x27;clock yesterday afternoon the  
same party of bibliophiles, who for the  
last two days have been doing some  
rapid buving at the auction rooms of  
Thomas Birch&#x27;s Sons, turned up again  
as fresh as roses. Before the sale con­  
siderable excitement was manifested  
among them, as the first item on the  
catalogue was the celebrated letter of  
Washington&#x27;s written to Maj. Gen  
Henry Lee, relating to the scheme to  
send a party of men into New York  
city and capture the traitor Arnold in  
the midst of the British garrison.
