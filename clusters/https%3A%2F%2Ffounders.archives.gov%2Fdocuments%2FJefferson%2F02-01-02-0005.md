Direct to Thos. Adams to be left at Nando’s coffee house Fleet street London.  
  
  
  
Cart. H. Harrison tells me it is generally allowed that 250. ℔ green pork makes 220 ℔ pickled. He weighed a ham and shoulder, the one green was 24 ℔, the other 17 ℔. When made into bacon they had lost exactly one fourth. They were corn fed.  
  
  
  
Stephen Willis sais it takes 15. bushels of lime to 1000. bricks.  
  
  
  
Old Sharpe sais a bushel of limestone will weigh 114 ℔ and if well burned will make 2. bushels of lime.  
  
  
  
Mr. Moore’s ford on a nice estimate cost £28.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Chuse out for a Burying place some unfrequented vale in the park where is ‘No sound to break the silence but a brook, That bubbling winds among the weeds: no mark Of any human shape that had been there, Unless a skeleton of some poor wretch Who sought that place out to despair and die in.’ Let it be among antient and venerable oaks, intersperse some gloomy evergreens. The area circular abt. 60. f. diameter encircled with an untrimmed hedge of cedar or of stone wall with a holly hedge on it in the form below. In the center of it erect a small Gothic temple of antique appearance.   
  
  
  
Appropriate one half to the use of my own family; the other of strangers, servants &amp;c. Erect pedestals with urns, &amp;c. and proper inscriptions. The passage between the walls 4. f. wide. On the grave of a favorite and faithful servant might be a pyramid erected of the rough rock stone, the pedestal made plain to receive an inscription. Let the exit of the spiral at (a) look on a small and distant part of the blue mountains. In the middle of the temple an altar, the sides of turf, the top a plain stone. Very little light, perhaps none at all save only the feeble ray of an half extinguished lamp.  
  
  
  
      Jane JeffersonAh!Joanna puellarum optima!Ah!aevi virentis flore praerepta!Sit tibi terra laevis!Longe, longeque valeto!  
  
  
  
      Inscription for an African slave.Shores there are, bless’d shores for us remain,And favor’d isles with golden fruitage crown’dWhere tufted flow’rets paint the verdant plain,Where ev’ry breeze shall med’cine ev’ry wound. There the stern tyrant that embitters life,Shall vainly suppliant, spread his asking hand;There shall we view the billow’s raging strife,Aid the kind breast, and waft his boat to land.  
  
  
  
At the spring on the North side of the park.  
  
  
  
A few feet below the spring level the ground 40, or 50 f. sq.—Let the water fall from the spring in the upper level over a terrace in the form of a cascade. Then conduct it along the foot of the terrace to the Western side of the level, where it may fall into a cistern under a temple, from which it may go off by the western border till it falls over another terrace at the Northern or lower side. Let the temple be raised 2.f. for the first floor of stone. Under this is the cistern, which may be a bath or any thing else. The 1st. story arches on three sides; the back or western side being close because the hill there comes down, and also to carry upstairs on the outside. The 2d. story to have a door on one side, a spacious window in each of the other sides. The rooms each 8 f. cube with a small table and couple of chairs. The roof may be Chinese, Graecian, or in the taste of the Lanthern of Demosthenes at Athens.  
  
  
  
The ground just about the spring smoothed and turfed; close to the spring a sleeping figure reclined on a plain marble slab, surrounded with turf; on the slab this inscription  
  
  
  
Huius nympha loci, sacri custodia fontis  
  
  
  
Dormio, dum blandae sentio murmur aquae.  
  
  
  
Parce meum, quisquis tangis cava marmora, somnum  
  
  
  
Rumpere; si bibas, sive lavere, tace.  
  
  
  
Near the spring also inscribe on stone or a metal plate fastened to a tree these lines ‘Beatus ille qui procul negotiis, Ut prisca gens mortalium, Paterna rura bobus exercet suis, Solutus omni foenore: Forumque vitat et superba civium Potentiorum limina. Libet jacere modo sub antiqua ilice, Modo in tenaci gramine: Labuntur altis interim rivis aquae; Queruntur in silvis aves; Fontesque lymphis obstrepunt manantibus, Somnos quod invitet leves.’ Plant trees of Beech and Aspen about it. Open a vista to the millpond, the river, road &amp;c. Qu. if a view of the neighboring town would have a good effect? Intersperse in this and every other part of the ground (except the environs of the Burying ground) abundance of Jessamine, Honeysuckle, sweet briar &amp;c. Under the temple an Aeolian harp where it may be concealed as well as covered from the weather.  
  
  
  
  
This would be better. The ground above the spring being very steep, dig into the hill and form a cave or grotto. Build up the sides and arch with stiff clay. Cover this with moss. Spangle it with translucent pebbles from Hanover town and beautiful shells from the shore at Burwell’s ferry. Pave the floor with pebbles. Let the spring enter at a corner of the grotto, pretty high up the side, and trickle down, or fall by a spout into a bason from which it may pass off thro’ the grotto. The figure will be better placed in this. Form a couch of moss. The English inscription will be then proper.  
  
  
  
Nymph of the grot, these sacred springs I keep.  
  
  
  
And to the murmur of these waters sleep:  
  
  
  
Ah! spare my slumbers! gently tread the cave!  
  
  
  
And drink in silence, or in silence lave!  
  
  
  
The Ground in General  
  
  
  
Thin the trees. Cut out stumps and undergrowth. Remove old trees and other rubbish except where they may look well. Cover the whole with grass. Intersperse Jesamine, honeysuckle, sweetbriar, and even hardy flowers which may not require attention. Keep in it deer, rabbits, Peacocks, Guinea poultry, pidgeons &amp;c. Let it be an asylum for hares, squirrels, pheasants, partridges and every other wild animal (except those of prey.) Court them to it by laying food for them in proper places. Procure a buck elk, to be as it were Monarch of the wood; but keep him shy, that his appearance may not lose it’s effect by too much familiarity. A buffalo might perhaps be confined also. Inscriptions in various places on the bark of trees or metal plates, suited to the character or expression of the particular spot. Benches or seats of rock or turf passim.

No sound to break the silence, but a brook  
  
That bubbling winds among the weeds.

THOMAS JEFFERSON.  
In a thick growth of woods, a few  
hundred vards to the right of a road  
leading from Charlotteville, Va., to  
Monticello, may be seen the grave of  
Jefferson, in a little enclosure with  
thirty others. An obelisk, nine feet  
high, marks the spot. The base has  
all been chipped away, and the monu­  
ment looks like a rough, meaningless  
stone. &quot;Born April 2, O. S. 1743, died  
July 4, 182,&quot; is put upon the base.  
Another inscription has almost been  
obliterated.  
On the fly-leaf of an old account  
book Jefferson wrote this: &quot;Choose  
some unfrequented vale in the park,  
where is no sound to break the still­  
ness but a brook that bubbling winds  
among the woods--no mark of human  
shape that has been there, unless the  
skeleton of some poor wretch who

etc. Let it be an asylum for hares,  
Squirrels, pheasants, partridges, and  
every other wild animal (except those of  
prey). Court them to it by laying food  
for them in proper places. Procure a  
buck elk, to be as it were Monarch of  
the wood; and keep him shy, that his  
appearance may not lose its effect by  
too much familiarity. A buffalo might  
perhaps be confined also. Inscriptions  
in various places on the bark of trees  
or metal plates, suited to the character  
or expression of the particular spot.  
Benches or seats of rock or turf passim.*
