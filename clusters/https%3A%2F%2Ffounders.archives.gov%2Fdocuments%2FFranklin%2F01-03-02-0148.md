e Further Experiments and Observations in Electricity made in Philadelphia 1748. viz.  
§1. There will be the same Explosion and Shock if the electrified, Phial is held in one Hand by the Hook, and the Coating touched by the other; as when held by the Coating and touched at the Hook.  
§2. To take the charged Phial safely by the Hook, and not at the same Time diminish it’s Force, it must first be set down on an Electric per se.  
  
§3. The Phial will be electrified as strongly, if held by the Hook, and the Coating apply’d to the Globe, or Tube, as when held by the Coating and the Hook apply’d.  
§4. But the Direction of the Electrical Fire being different in Charging, will also be different in the Explosion. The Bottle charged thro’ the Hook will be discharged thro’ the Hook. The Bottle charged thro’ the Coating, will be discharged thro’ the Coating and not otherwise: For the Fire must come out the same Way it went in.  
§5. To prove this; Take two Bottles that were equally charg’d thro’ the Hooks, one in each Hand; bring their Hooks near each other, and no Spark or Shock will follow; because each Hook is disposed to give Fire, and neither to receive it. Set one of the Bottles down on Glass, take it up by the Hook, and apply it’s Coating to the Hook of the other; then there will be an Explosion and Shock, and both Bottles will be discharged.  
§6. Vary the Experiment, by Charging two Vials equally, one thro’ Hook, the other thro’ the Coating: Hold that by the Coating which was charged thro’ the Hook; and that by the Hook which was charged thro’ the Coating. Apply the Hook of the first to the Coating of the other and there will be no Shock or Spark. Set that down on Glass, which you held by the Hook, take it up by the Coating, and bring the two Hooks together; a Spark and Shock will follow, and both Phials be discharged.  
In this Experiment the Bottles are totally discharged, or the Equilibrium within them restored. The Abounding of Fire in one of the Hooks (or rather in the internal Surface of one Bottle) being exactly equal to the Wanting of the other: and therefore, as each Bottle has in itself the Abounding as well as the Wanting, the Wanting and Abounding must be equal in each Bottle. See §§8, 9, 10, 11. But if a Man holds in his Hands two Bottles, one fully electrified, the other not at all; and brings their Hooks together; he has but half a Shock, and the Bottles will both remain half electrified; the one being half discharged and the other half charged.  
  
7. Farther, Place two Vials equally charged on a Table at 5 or 6 Inches Distance; Let a Cork Ball, suspended by a Silk Thread, hang between them. If the Vials were both charg’d thro’ their Hooks, the Cork, when it has been attracted and repell’d by the one, will not be attracted but equally repell’d by the other. But if the Vials were charged, the one thro the Hook and the other thro’ the Coating,  
  
*To charge a Bottle commodiously thro’ the Coating, place it on a Glass Stand; form a Communication from the prime Conductor to the Coating, and another from the Hook to the Wall or Floor. When ’tis charg’d remove the latter Communication before you take hold of the Bottle; otherwise great Part of the Fire will escape by it.  
  
the Ball when it is repell’d from one Hook will be as strongly attracted by the other, and play vigorously between them, till both Vials are nearly discharg’d.  
8. When we use the Terms of Charging and Discharging the Phial, ’tis in Compliance with Custom, and for want of others more suitable: since We are of Opinion, that there is really no more electrical Fire in the Phial, after what is called it’s Charging than before; nor less after it’s Discharging; (excepting only the small Spark that might be given to and taken from the Non-electric Matter, if separated from the Bottle, which Spark may not be equal to a 500th. Part of what is called the Explosion) For, if on the Explosion, the Electrical Fire came out of the Bottle by one Part, and did not enter in again by another; then, if a Man standing on Wax and holding the Bottle in one Hand, takes the Spark by touching the Wire Hook with the other, the Bottle being thereby discharg’d, the Man would be charg’d; or, whatever Fire was lost by one, would be found in the other; since there is no Way for it’s Escape. But the Contrary is true.  
9. Besides, the Vial will not suffer what is called a Charging, unless as much Fire can go out of it one Way as is thrown in by another. A Phial can not be charged, standing on Wax, or Glass, or hanging on the prime Conductor, unless a Communication be form’d between it’s Coating and the Floor.  
  
10. But suspend two or more Phials on the prime Conductor, one hanging to the Tail of the other, and a Wire from the last to the Floor: an equal Number of Turns of the Wheel shall charge them all equally; and every one as much as one alone would have been. What is driven out at the Tail of the first, serving to charge the second; what is driven out of the second charging the third, and so on. By this Means, a great Number of Bottles might be charged with the same Labour, and equally high with one alone, were it not that every Bottle receives new Fire and loses it’s old with some Reluctance, or rather gives some small Resistance to the Charging, which in a Number of Bottles becomes more equal to the Charging Power, and so repels the Fire back again on the Globe, sooner than a single Bottle would do.  
11. When a Bottle is charg’d in the common Way, it’s inside and outside Surfaces stand ready, the one to give Fire by the Hook, the other to receive it by the Coating: The one is full and ready to throw out, the other empty and extreamly hungry: yet as the first will not give out, unless the other can at the same Instant receive in; so neither will the latter receive in, unless the first can at the same Instant give out. When both can be done at once, ’tis done with inconceivable Quickness and Violence.  
12. So a strait Spring (tho’ the Comparison does not agree in every Particular) when forcibly bent, must, to restore itself contract that Side, which in the bending was extended, and extend that which was contracted; if either of these two Operations be hindered, the other can not be done. But the Spring is not said to be charged with Elasticity when bent, and discharg’d when unbent; it’s Quantity of Elasticity is always the same.  
13. Glass, in like Manner, has, within it’s Substance always the same Quantity of Electrical Fire; and that, a very great Quantity in Proportion to the Mass of Glass, as shall be shewn hereafter. §26.  
14. This Quantity, proportioned to the Glass, it strongly and obstinately retains, and will neither have more nor less; tho it will suffer a Change to be made in it’s Parts and Situation; that is, We may take away Part of it from one of the Sides, provided we throw an equal Quantity into the other.  
15. Yet when the Situation of the Electrical Fire is thus altered in the Glass, when some has been taken from one Side, and some added to the other; it will not be at Rest or in its natural State, till ’tis restored to it’s original Equality. And this Restitution can not be made thro the Substance of the Glass, but must be done by a Non-electric Communication formed without, from Surface to Surface.  
16. Thus the whole Force of the Bottle and Power of giving a Shock, is in the Glass itself; the Non-electrics in Contact with the two Surfaces serving only to give and receive to and from the several Parts of the Glass; that is, to give on one Side, and take away from the other.  
17. This was discovered here in the following Manner. Purposing to analize the electrified Bottle, in Order to find where it’s Strength lay; we placed it on Glass, and drew out the Cork and Wire, which, for that Purpose, had been loosly put in. Then taking the Bottle in one Hand, and bringing a Finger of the other near its Mouth, a strong Spark came from the Water, and the Shock was as violent as if the Wire had remained in it; which shew’d that the Force did not lie in the Wire. Then to find if it resided in the Water, being crowded into and condensed in it, as confined by the Glass; which had been our former Opinion; we electrified the Bottle again, and placing it on Glass, drew out the Wire and Cork as before, then taking up the Bottle, we decanted all its Water into an empty Bottle, which likewise stood on Glass; and taking up that other Bottle, we expected, if the Force resided in the Water, to find a Shock from it; but there was none. We judged then, that it must either be lost in Decanting, or remain in the first Bottle. The latter we found to be true: For that Bottle on Trial gave the Shock, tho’ filled up as it stood with fresh unelectrify’d Water from a Tea Pot. To find then whether Glass had this Property merely as Glass, or whether the Form contributed any Thing to it; we took a Pane of Sash Glass, and laying it on the Hand, placed a Plate of thin Lead on it’s upper Surface; then electrified that Plate, and bringing a Finger to it, there was a Spark and Shock. We then took two Plates of Lead of equal Dimensions, but less than the Glass by two Inches every Way, and electrified the Glass between them, by electrifying the uppermost Lead; then separated the Glass from the Lead; in doing which, what little Fire might be in the Lead was taken out; and the Glass being touched in the electrified Part with a Finger, afforded only very small pricking Sparks, but a great Number of them might be taken from different Places. Then dextrously placing it again between the Plates of Lead, and completing the Circle between the two Surfaces, a violent Shock ensu’d. Which demonstrated the Power to reside in the Glass as Glass; and that the Non-electrics in Contact served only like the Armature of the Loadstone, to unite the Forces of the several Parts, and bring them at once to any Point desired. It being a Property of a Nonelectric, that the whole Body instantly receives or gives what Electrical Fire is given to or taken from any one of its Parts.  
18. Upon this We made what we call’d an Electrical Battery, consisting of eleven Panes of large Sash Glass, arm’d with thin leaden Plates, pasted on each Side, placed vertically, and supported at two Inches Distance on Silk Cords; with Hooks of thick Leaden Wire one from each Side standing upright, distant from each other; and convenient Communications of Wire and Chain from the giving Side of one Pane to the receiving Side of the other; that so the whole might be charg’d together, and with the same Labour as one single Pane; and another Contrivance to bring the giving Sides, after charging in Contact with one long Wire, and the Receivers with another; which two long Wires would give the Force of all the Plates of Glass at once thro’ the Body of any Animal forming the Circle with them. The Plates may also be discharg’d separately, or any Number together that is required. But this Machine is not much used, as not perfectly answering our Intention with Regard to the Ease of Charging, for the Reasons given §10. We made also, of large Glass Panes, Magical Pictures, and self moving animated Wheels, presently to be described.  
  
19. I perceive by the ingenious Mr. Watson’s last Book, lately received, that Dr. Bevis had used Panes of Glass to give a Shock before us; tho’ till that Book came to Hand, I thought to have communicated it to you as a Novelty. The Excuse for mentioning it here, is, that we try’d the Experiment differently, drew different Consequences from it (for Mr. Watson still seems to think the Fire accumulated on the Non-electric that is in Contact with the Glass pag. 72) and, as far as we hitherto know, have carry’d it further.  
20. The Magical Picture is made thus. Having a large Mezzotinto with a Frame and Glass (Suppose of the King, God preserve him) Take out the Print, and cut a Pannel out of it, near two Inches all round distant from the Frame; if the Cut is thro’ the Picture, tis not the Worse. With thin Paste or Gum Water, fix the Border, that is cut off, on the inside of the Glass, pressing it smoothe and close; then fill up the Vacancy by Gilding the Glass well with Leaf Gold or Brass; gild likewise the inner Edge of the Back of the Frame all round except the Top Part, and form a Communication between that Gilding and the Gilding behind the Glass: then put in the Board, and that side is finished. Turn up the Glass, and gild the foreside exactly over the Back Gilding; and when this is dry, cover it by pasting on the Pannel of the Picture that had been cut out, observing to bring the corresponding Parts of the Border and Picture together; by which the Picture will appear of a Piece as at first, only Part is behind the Glass and Part before. Hold the Picture horizontally by the Top, and place a little moveable gilt Crown on the Kings Head. If now the Picture be moderately electrified, and another Person take hold of the Frame with one Hand, so that his Fingers touch it’s inside Gilding, and with the other Hand endeavour to take off the Crown, he will receive a terrible Blow and fail in the Attempt. If the Picture were highly charg’d, the Consequence might perhaps be as fatal as that of High Treason: For when the Spark is taken thro’ a Quire of Paper laid on the Picture, by Means of a Wire Communication, it makes a fair Hole thro’ every Sheet; that is thro’ 48 Leaves (tho’ a Quire of Paper is thought good Armour against the Push of a Sword, or even against a Pistol Bullet) and the Crack is exceeding loud. The Operator, who, to prevent its falling, holds the Picture by the upper End, where the inside of the Frame is not gilt, feels Nothing of the Shock, and may touch the Crown without Danger, which he pretends is a Test of his Loyalty. If a Ring of Persons take a Shock among them the Experiment is called the Conspiracy.  
21. On the Principle in §7. That the Hooks of Bottles, differently charged, will attract and repel differently, is made an electrical Wheel, that turns with considerable Strength. A small upright Shaft of Wood passes at right Angles thro’ a thin round Board of about a Foot Diameter, and turns on a sharp Point of Iron, fixt in the lower End, while a strong Wire in the upper End, passing thro’ a small Hole in a thin Brass Plate, keeps the Shaft truly vertical. About 30 Radii of equal Length made of Sash Glass, cut in narrow Strips, issue Horizontally from the Circumference of the Board; the Ends most distant from the Center being about 4 Inches apart. On the End of every one, a Brass Thimble is fixt. If now the Wire of a Bottle, electrified in the Common Way, be brought near the Circumference of this Wheel, it will attract the nearest Thimble, and so put the Wheel in Motion: That Thimble, in passing by, receives a Spark, and thereby being electrified is repell’d and so driven forwards, while a second, being attracted, approaches the Wire, receives a Spark and is driven after the first; and so on till the Wheel has gone once round, when the Thimbles, before Electrified, approaching the Wire, instead of being attracted, as they were at first, are repell’d; and the Motion presently ceases. But if another Bottle, which had been charg’d thro’ the Coating be placed near the same Wheel, it’s Wire will attract the Thimbles repell’d by the first, and thereby doubles the Force that carries the Wheel round; and not only, taking out the Fire that had been communicated to the Thimbles by the first Bottle, but even robbing them of their natural Quantity, instead of being repell’d when they come again towards the first Bottle, they are more strongly attracted: so that the Wheel mends its Pace till it goes with great Rapidity, 12 or 15 Rounds in a Minute; and with such Strength, as that the Weight of 100 Spanish Dollars, with which we once loaded it, did not seem in the least to retard it’s Motion. This is called an Electrical Jack; and if a large Fowl were spitted on the upright Shaft, it would be carried round before a Fire with a Motion fit for Roasting.  
22. But this Wheel, like those driven by Wind, Water or Weights, moves by a foreign Force, viz. that of the Bottles. The Selfmoving Wheel, tho constructed on the same Principles, appears more surprizing. ’Tis made of a thin round Plate of Window Glass, 17 Inches Diameter, well gilt on both Sides, all but two Inches next the Edge. Two small Hemispheres of Wood are then fixt with Cement to the Middle of the upper and under Sides, centrally opposite, and in each of them a thick strong Wire 8 or 10 Inches long, which together make the Axis of the Wheel. It turns horizontally on a Point at the lower End of it’s Axis which rests on a Bit of Brass, cemented within a Glass Salt-Seller. The upper End of it’s Axis passes thro’ a Hole in a thin Brass Plate, cemented to a long strong Piece of Glass, which keeps it 6 or 8 Inches Distant from any Non-electric, and has a small Ball of Wax or Metal on its Top to keep in the Fire. In a Circle on the Table, which supports the Wheel, are fixt 12 small Pillars of Glass, at about 4 Inches Distance, with a Thimble on the Top of each. On the Edge of the Wheel is a small leaden Bullet, communicating by a Wire with the Gilding of the upper Surface of the Wheel: and about 6 Inches from it, is another Bullet, communicating in like Manner with the under Surface. When the Wheel is to be charg’d by the upper Surface, a Communication must be made from the under Surface to the Table. When it is well chargd it begins to move; the Bullet nearest to a Pillar, moving towards the Thimble on that Pillar; and passing by, electrifies it, and then pushes itself from it: The succeeding Bullet, which communicates with the other Surface of the Glass, more strongly attracting that Thimble, on Account of it’s being before electrified by the other Bullet: and thus the Wheel increases it’s Motion, till it comes to such a Height, as that the Resistance of the Air regulates it. It will go half an Hour, and make, one Minute with another, 20 Turns in a Minute; which is 600 Turns in the whole: The Bullet of the upper Surface giving in each Turn 12 Sparks to the Thimbles, which makes 7200 Sparks, and the Bullet of the under Surface receiving as many from the Thimbles: these Bullets moving in the Time, near 2500 Feet. The Thimbles are well fixt, and in so exact a Circle, that the Bullets may pass within a very small Distance of each of them. If instead of 2 Bullets, you put 8, 4 communicating with the upper Surface, and four with the under Surface, placed alternately; which 8, at about 6 Inches Distance completes the Circumference; the Force and Swiftness will be greatly increased; the Wheel making 50 Turns in a Minute; but then it will not go so long. These Wheels may perhaps be apply’d to the Ringing of Chimes and Moving Orreries.  
23. A small Wire bent circularly, with a loop at each End; Let one End rest against the under Surface of the Wheel, and bring the other End near the upper Surface, it will give a terrible Crack; The Force will be discharg’d, and the Wheel will stop.  
24. Every Spark drawn in that Manner from the Surface of the Wheel, makes a round Hole in the Gilding, tearing off a Part of it in coming out; which shews that the Fire is not accumulated on the Gilding, but is in the Glass itself.  
25. The Gilding being varnished over with Turpentine Varnish; the Varnish, tho’ dry and hard, is burnt by the Spark drawn thro’ it, gives a strong Smell and visible Smoke. And when the Spark is drawn thro’ Paper, all round the Hole made by it, the Paper will be blackt by the Smoke, which Sometimes penetrates several of the Leaves. Parts of the Gilding, torn off, are also found forcibly driven into the Hole made in the paper by the Stroke.  
26. ’Tis amazing to observe in how small a Portion of Glass a great Electrical Force may lie. A thin Glass Bubble about an Inch Diameter, weighing only six Grains, being half filled with Water, partly gilt on the outside, and furnished with a Wire Hook, gives when electrified, as great a Shock as a Man is willing to bear. As the Glass is thickest near the Orifice, I suppose the lower half, which being gilt, was electrified, and gave the Shock, did not exceed two Grains; for it appeared, when broke, much thinner than the upper half. If one of these thin Bottles be electrified by the Coating, and the Spark taken out thro the Gilding, it will break the Glass inwards, at the same Time that it breaks the Gilding outwards.  
27. And allowing, for the Reasons before given §§8, 9, 10, that there is no more Electrical Fire in a Bottle after Charging than before, how great must the Quantity be in this small Portion of Glass! It seems as if it were of its very Substance and Essence. Perhaps if that due Quantity of Electrical Fire, so obstinately retain’d by Glass, could be separated from it, it would no longer be Glass, it might loose it’s Transparency, or its Fragility, or Elasticity. Experiments may possibly be invented hereafter to discover this.  
28. We are surprized at the Account given in Mr. Watson’s Book, of a Shock communicated thro’ a great Space of dry Ground, and suspect some metalline Quality in the Gravel of that Ground: having found, that simple dry Earth ramm’d in a Glass Tube open at both Ends, and a Wire Hook inserted in the Earth at each End; the Earth and Wires making Part of a Circle, would not conduct the least perceptible Shock. And indeed when one Wire was electrified, the other hardly shew’d any Signs of it’s being in Connexion with it. Even a thoroughly wet Packthread sometimes fails of conducting a Shock, tho’ it otherwise conducts Electricity very well. A dry Cake of Ice, or an Iceicle, held between two Persons in a Circle, likewise prevents the Shock, which one would not expect, as Water conducts it so perfectly well. Gilding on a new Book, tho’ at first it conducts the Shock extreamly well; yet fails after 10 or a Dozen Experiments; tho’ it appears otherwise in all Respects the same; which we can not account for.  
29. There is one Experiment more, which surprizes us, and is hitherto not satisfactorily accounted for. It is this. Place an Iron Shot on a Glass Stand, and let a damp Cork Ball, suspended by a Silk Thread hang in Contact with the Shot. Take a Bottle in each Hand, one that is electrified thro’ the Hook, the other thro’ the Coating. Apply the giving Wire to the Shot, which will electrify it positively, and the Cork shall be repell’d. Then apply the requiring Wire, which will take out the Spark given by the other, when the Cork will return to the Shot. Apply the same again, and take out another Spark, so will the Shot be electrified negatively, and the Cork in that Case shall be repell’d equally as before. Then apply the giving Wire, and give to the Shot the Spark it wanted, so will the Cork return: Give it another, which will be an Addition to it’s natural Quantity, so will the Cork be repell’d again; And so may the Experiment be repeated, as long as there is any Charge remaining in the Bottles; Which shews that Bodies, having less than the common Quantity of Electricity, repel each other, as well as those that have more.  
Chagrin’d a little that We have hitherto been able to discover Nothing in this Way of Use to Mankind, and the hot Weather coming on, when Electrical Experiments are not so agreable; ’tis proposed to put an End to them for this Season somewhat humorously in a Party of Pleasure on the Banks of SchuylKill, (where Spirits are at the same Time to be fired by a Spark sent from Side to Side thro’ the River).  
  
†This was since done.  
  
A Turky is to be killed for our Dinners by the Electrical Shock; and roasted by the electrical Jack, before a Fire kindled by the Electrified Bottle; when the Healths of all the famous Electricians in England, France and Germany, are to be drank in Electrified Bumpers,  
  
*An electrified Bumper is a small thin Glass Tumbler, near filled with Wine and electrified. This when brought to the Lips, gives a Shock; if the Party be close shaved, and does not breathe on the Liquor.  
  
under the Discharge of Guns from the Electrical Battery.

holds in his hands two bottles, one fully electrify d, the

the bottle, which ſpark may not be equal to a five hun-  
dredth part of what is called the exploſion.  
  
For if, on the exploſion, the electrical fire came out of  
the bottle by one part, and did not enter in again by ano-  
ther; then, if a man ſtanding on wax, and holding the  
bottle in one hand, takes the ſpark by touching the wire  
hook with the other, the bottle being thereby d:ſcharged,  
the man would be charged ; or whatever fire was loſt by  
one, would be found i in the other, ſince there. is no way  
for its eſcape: But the contrary is true.  
  
9. Beſides the phial will not ſuffer what is called a 4  
ging, unleſs as much fire can go out of it one way, as is  
thrown in by another. A phial cannot be charged ſtand-  
ding on wax or glaſs, or hanging on the prime conductor,  
unleſs a communication be form&#x27;d between its coating and  
the floor. | ; | |  
  
10. But ſuſpend two or more phials on the prime con-  
ductor, one hanging to the tail of the other; and a wire  
from the laſt to the floor, an equal number of turns of the  
wheel ſhall charge them all equally, and every one as  
much as one alone would have been. What is driven out  
at the tail of the firſt, ſerving to chagge the ſecond ; what  
is driven out of the ſecond charging the third; and ſo on.  
By this means a great number of bottles might be charged  
with the ſame labour, and equally high, with one alone,  
were it not that every bottle receives new fire, and loſes  
its old with ſome reluctance, or rather gives ſome ſmall re-  
fiſtance to the charging, which in a number of bottles be-  
  
comes  
  
Lrrzxs on ELErRIrrr. 23  
  
comes more equal to the chaiging power, and fo repels the  
fire back again on the globe, ſooner than a I: bottle  
would do..  
  
11. When a bottle is eee in the common way, its  
infide and outfide ſurfaces ſtand ready, the one to give fire  
by the hook, the other to receive it by the coating; the  
one is full, and ready to throw out, the other empty and  
  
  
the other can at the ſame inſtant receive in; ſo neither will  
the latter receive in, unleſs the firſt can at the ſame inſtant  
give out. When both can be done at once, tis done with  
  
inconceivable quickneſs and violence.

ſhewn hereafter.

though it will ſuffer a change to be made in its parts and

of the ſides, provided we throw an n equal quantity into  
the other. | | :  
15. Yet when the ſituation of the electrical fire is thus  
altered in the glaſs; when ſome has been taken from one  
fide, and ſome added to the other, it will not be at reſt or  
in its natural tate, till &#x27;tis reſtored to its original equality.  
And this reſtitution cannot be made through the ſubſtance  
of the glaſs, but muſt be done by a non- electric communi-  
cation formed without, from ſurface to ſurface. N  
16. Thus, the whole force of the bottle, and power of  
giving a ſhock, is in the GL Ass ITSELF ; the non-electrics  
in contract with the two ſurfaces, ſerving only to give and  
receive to and from the ſeveral parts of the glaſs; that is, to  
give on one fide, and take away from the other. &quot;I  
17. This was diſcovered here in the following manner.  
Purpoſing to analyſe the electrified bottle, in order to find  
wherein its ſtrength lay, we placed it on glaſs, and drew  
out the cork and wire which for that purpoſe had been  
looſely put in. Then taking the bottle in one hand, and  
bringing a finger of the other near its mouth, a ſtrong ſpark  
came from the water, and the ſhock was as violent as if the  
wire had remained in it, which ſhewed that the force did  
not lie in the wire. Then to find if it reſided in the water,  
being crouded into and condenſed in it, as connfi&#x27;d by the  
elaſs, which had been our former opinion, we electrify d  
the bottle again, and placing it on glaſs, drew out the wire  
and cork as before; then taking up the bottle we decanted  
  
all its water into an empty bottle, . likewiſe ſtood on  
glaſs &quot;x  
  
&quot;Lycans: on Elzernicrrr. 25  
  
glaſs; and taking up that other bottle, we expected if the  
force reſided in the water, to find a ſhock from it; but  
  
  
loſt in decanting, or remain in the firſt bottle. The latter  
we found to be true: for that bottle on trial gave the ſhock,  
  
  
from a tea- pot. To find then, whether glaſs had this  
property merely as glaſs, or whether the form contributed  
any thing to it; we took a pane of ſaſh-glaſs, and laying  
it on the ſtand, placed a plate of lead on its upper ſurface ;  
  
  
of equal dimenſions, but leſs than the glaſs by two inches  
every way, and electrified the glaſs between them, by  
  
  
glaſs from the lead, in doing which, what little fire  
might be in the lead was taken out and the glaſs be-  
ing touched in the electrified parts with a finger, af-  
forded only very ſmall pricking ſparks, but a great  
number of them might be taken from different places.  
Then dexterouſly placing it again between the leaden  
  
  
a violent ſhock enſued. --- Which demonſtrated the power  
to reſide in glaſs as glaſs, and that the non-eleQtrics in con-  
  
tact ſerved only, like the armature of a loadſtone, to unite  
the force of the ſeveral parts, and bring them at once to any

with thin leaden plates paſted on each fide, placed verti-

with thick hooks of leaden wire, one from each fide,  
ſtanding upright, diſtant from each other, and convenient  
communications of wire and chain, from the giving ſide of  
one pane, to the receiving fide of the other; that ſo the  
whole might be charged together, and with the ſame la-  
bour as one ſingle pane ; and another contrivance to bring  
the giving ſides, after charging, in contact with one long  
  
  
wires would give the force of all the plates of glaſs at once  
through the body of any animal forming the circle with  
them. The plates may alſo be diſcharged ſeparately, or  
any number together that is required. But this machine  
is not much uſed, as not perfectly anſwering our intention  
with regard to the eaſe of charging, for the reaſon  
given g 10. We made alſo of large glaſs panes, magical  
pictures, and ſelf-moving animated * ee to me  
deſcribed.  
  
19. I perceive by the ingenious Mr Walſor 8 laſt EY  
lately received, that Dr Bevis had uſed, before we had.  
  
  
to hand, I thought to have communicated it to you as 2  
  
novelty, The excuſe for mentioning it here, is, that we  
tried  
  
- LzmTERS on Elscrxlerrr. „  
  
tried FE experiment — drew different 5  
ces from it, (for Mr Watſon till (ſeems to think the fire  
accumulated on the nun- electric chi is in contact with the  
glaſs, page 72) and, as far as we — . have car-  
ried it farther.  
  
20. The magical picture is made thus. Having a 1  
metzotinto with a frame and glaſs, ſuppoſe of the KING,  
(God preſerve him) take out the print, and cut a pan-  
nel out of it, near two inches diſtant from the frame all  
  
round. If the cut is through the picture tis not the worſe.  
With thin paſte or gum-water, fix the border that is cut off  
on the inſide of the glaſs; preſſing it ſmooth and cloſe ;  
then fill up the vacancy by gilding the glaſs well with leaf  
gold or braſs. Gild likewiſe the inner edge of the back of  
the frame all round except the top part, and form a com-  
munication between that gilding and the gilding behind  
the glaſs : then put in the board, and that fide is finiſhed.  
Turn up the glaſs, and gild the fore fide exactly over the  
back gilding, and when it is dry, cover it by paſting on  
the pannel of the picture that had been cut out, obſerving  
to bring the correſponding parts of the border and picture  
together, by which the picture will appear of a piece as at  
firſt, only part is behind the glaſs, and part before. --- Hold  
the picture horizontally by the top, and place a little  
moveable gilt crown on the king&#x27;s-head. If now the pic-  
ture be moderately electrified, and another perſon take hold  
of the frame with one hand, ſo that his fingers touch its  
inſide gilding, and with the other hand endeavour t to take  
E oh off  
  
28 Mr B. RANK LINE  
  
off the crown, he will receive a terrible koi, and fail in 35  
the attempt. If the picture were highly charged, the con-  
ſequence might perhaps be as fatal as that of high- treaſon;  
for when the ſpark is taken through a quire of paper laid  
on the picture, by means of a wire communication, it makes  
a fair hole through every ſheet, that is, through 48 leaves,  
(though a quire of paper is thought good armour againſt:  
the puſh of a ſword or even againſt a piſtol bullet) and  
the crack is exceeding loud. The operator, who holds the  
picture by the upper-end, where the inſide of the frame  
is not gilt, to prevent its falling, feels nothing of the ſhock,  
and may touch the face of the picture without danger,  
which he pretends is a teſt of his loyalty. --- If a ring  
of perſons take the ſhock among them, the experiment  
= is called, The Conſpirators. .

charged through the coating be placed near the ſame  
  
wheel, its wire will attract the thimble repelled by the  
firſt, and thereby double the force that carries the wheel  
round; and not only taking out the fire that had been  
communicated to the thimbles by the firſt bottle, but even  
robbing them of their natural quantity, inſtead of being re-  
pelled when they come again towards the firſt bottle, they  
are more ſtrongly attracted, ſo that the wheel mends its |  
pace, till it goes with great rapidity twelve or fifteen rounds =

thin round plate of window-glaſs, ſeventeen inches diame-  
ter, well gilt on both fides, all but two inches next the  
edge. Two ſmall hemiſpheres of wood are then fixed  
with cement to the middle of the upper and under fides,  
centrally oppoſite, and in each of them a thick ſtrong wire  
eight or ten inches long, which together make the axis of  
the wheel. It turns horizontally on a point at the lower  
end of its Axis, which reſts on a bit of braſs cemented  
within a glaſs falt-celler. The upper end of its axis paſſeg  
thro&#x27; a hole in a thin braſs plate cemented to a long ſtrong  
piece of glaſs, which keeps it ſix or eight inches diſtant  
from any non- electric, and has a ſmall ball of wax or me-  
tal on its top to keep in the fire. In a circle on the table  
which ſupports the wheel, are fixed twelve ſmall pillars&#x27;of  
glaſs, at about four inches diſtance, with a thimble on the  
top of each. On the edge of the wheel is a ſmall leaden  
bullet communicating by a wire with the gilding of the up-  
per ſurface of the wheel; and about fix inches from it is  
another bullet communicating in like manner with the

And when the ſpark is drawn through paper, all round the

it will break the glaſs inwards at the ſame. time that 1 5

ſeparated from it, it would no longer be glaſs; it might  
loſe its tranſparency, -or its brittleneſs, or its ela fticity. ===  
Experiments may _ be invented ee to dif-  
cover this.  
27. We are ſurprized at the account given in u Mc Wat- |  
ſon&#x27;s book, of a ſhock communicated through a great ſpace  
of dry ground, and ſuſpect there muſt be ſome metaline  
quality in the gravel of that ground; having found. that  
fimple dry earth, rammed in a glaſs tube, open at both  
ends, and a wire hook inſerted in the earth at each end, the  
earth and wires making part of a circle, would not. con-  
duct the leaſt perceptible ſhock, and indeed when one  
wire was electrify d, the other hardly ſhowed any ſigns of  
its being in connection with it. Even a thoroughly  
wet pack-thread ſometimes fails of conducting a ſhock,  
tho it otherwiſe conducts electricity very well. A dry  
cake of ice, or an icicle held between two in a circle, like-  
wiſe prevents the ſhock ; which one would not expect, as  
water conducts it ſo perfectly well. Gilding on a new  
book, though at firſt it conducts the ſhock extremely well,  
yet fails after ten or a dozen experiments, though it ap-  
pears otherwiſe in all reſpects the ſame, which we cannot  
account for. |  
28. There is one experiment more which ſurprizes us,  
and is not hitherto ſatisfactorily accounted for; it is this.  
Place an iron ſhot on a glaſs ſtand, and let a ball of damp  
  
cork, ſuſpended by a ſilk thread, hang in contact with the

altered in the glaſs; when ſome has been taken from one  
ſide, and ſome added to the other, it will not be at reſt or  
in its natural ſtate, till tis reſtored to its original equality.  
And this reſtitution cannot be made through the ſubſtance  
of the glaſs, but muſt be done by a non- electric communi-  
  
  
16. Thus, the whole force of the bottle, and power of  
  
  
in contract with the two ſurfaces, ſerving only to give and  
receive to and from the ſeveral parts of the glaſs; that is, to  
give on one ſide, and take away from the other. 5  
  
17. This was diſcovered here in the following manner.  
Purpoſing to analyſe the electrified bottle, in order to find  
wherein its ſtrength lay, we placed it on glaſs, and drew  
out the cork and wire which for that purpoſe had been  
  
  
bringing a finger of the other near its mouth, a ſtrong ſpark  
came from the water, and the ſhock was as violent as-if the  
wire had remained in it, which ſhewed that the force did  
not he in the wire. Then to find if it reſided in the water,  
being crouded into and condenſed in it, as connfi d by the  
glaſs, which had been our former opinion, we electrify&#x27; d  
  
  
and cork as before ; then taking up the bottle we decanted  
ul its water into an empty bottle, which likewiſe ſtood on  
glaſs;

5 gu J und king up that other bottle; we expected if the  
force reſided in the water, to find a ſhock from it; but  
there was none. We judged then, that it muſt either be  
loſt in decanting, or remain in the firſt bottle. The latter  
we fund to be true: for that bottle on trial gave the ſhock,  
chough filled up as it ſtood with freſhi unelectrified water  
from a tea- pot. To find then, whether glaſs had this  
property merely as glaſs, or whether the form contributed  
any thing to it; we took a pane of ſaſh-glaſs, and laying  
it on the ſtand, placed a plate of lead on its upper ſurface;  
then electrify d that plate, and bringing a finger to it, there  
was a ſpark and ſhock. We then took two plates of lead  
of equal dimenſions, but leſs than the glaſs by two inches  
every way, and electrified the glaſs between them, by  
electrifying the uppermoſt lead; then ſeparated the  
glaſs from the lead, in doing which, what little fire  
might be in the lead was taken out and the glaſs be-  
ing touched in the electrified parts with a finger, af-  
forded only very ſmall pricking ſparks, but a great  
number of them might be taken from different places.  
Then dexterouſly placing it again between the &#x27;leaden  
plates, and compleating a circle between the two ſurfaces,  
a violent hock enſued. --- Which demonſtrated the power  
to reſide in glaſs as glaſs, and that the non- electrics in con-  
tact ſerved only, like the armature of a loadſtone; to unite  
the force of the ſeveral parts, and bring them at once to any  
point defired : it being a property of a non- electric, that

18. Upon this, we made what we call d .  
  
with thin leaden plates paſied on each fide, placed verti-  
cally, and ſupported at two inches diſtance on ſilk cords,  
with thick hooks of leaden wire, one from each fide,  
ſtanding upright, diſtant from each other, and convenient  
communications of wire and chain, from the giving fide of  
  
  
bour as one fingle pane ; and another contrivance to bring  
the giving fides, after charging, in contact with one long  
wire, and the receivers with another, which two long  
wires would give the force of all the plates of glaſs at once  
through the body of any animal forming the circle with  
them. The plates may alſo be diſchatged ſeparately, or  
any number together that is required, But this machine  
is not much uſed, as not perfectly anſwering our intention

lately received, that Dr Bevis had uſed, before we had,

accumulated on the: nun- electric that is in contact with the  
  
_ glaſs, page 72) an, 1 as we N know, have car-  
ried it farther.  
  
20. The 3 is made this Having a large  
metzotinto with a frame and glaſs, ſuppoſe of the Kine,  
(God preſerve him) take out the print, and cut a pan-  
nel out of it, near two inches diſtant from the frame all  
round. If the cut is through the picture tis not the worſe.  
  
Wich thin paſte or gum· water, fix the border that is cut off  
on the inſide of the glaſs, preſſing it ſmooth and cloſe;  
then fill up the vacancy by gilding the glaſs well with leaf  
gold or braſs. Gild likewiſe the inner edge of the back of  
the frame all round except the top part, and form a com-  
munication between that gilding and the gilding behind  
  
the glaſs : then put in the board, and that fide is finiſhed.-  
Turn up the- glaſs, and gild the fore fide exactly over the  
back gilding, and when it-is dry, cover it by paſting on  
the pdhnel of the picture that had been cut out, obſerving  
  
to bring the correſponding parts of the border and picture  
together, by which the picture will appear of a piece as at  
firſt, only part is behind the glaſs, and part before. Hold  
the picture horizontally by the top, and place a little  
moveable gilt crown on the-king&#x27;s-head. If now the pic-  
ture be moderately electrified, and another perſon take hold  
ef the frame, with one hand, ſo that his fingers touch its  
inſide IIS and with the other hand endeavour to take

a fair hole through every ſheet, that is, through 48 leaves,  
  
  
the puſh of a ſword or even againſt a piſtol bullet) and  
the crack is exceeding loud. The operator, who holds the  
picture by the upper-end, where the inſide of the frame  
  
is not gilt, to prevent its falling, feels nothing of the ſhock,  
and may touch the face of the picture without danger,  
which he pretends is a teſt of his loyalty. — If a ring  
of perſons take the ſhock among them, the experiment  
  
  
21. On the principle, in 8 7, that WE”. of botiles dif.  
ferently charged, will attract and repel differently, is made  
an electrical wheel, that turns with conſiderable ſtrength.  
A ſmall upright ſhaft of wood paſles at right angles through  
a thin round board, of about twelve inches diameter, and  
turns on a ſharp point of iron fixed in the lower end, while  
a ſtrong wire in the-upper-end paſſing thro&#x27; a ſmall hole  
in a thin braſs plate, keeps the ſhaft truly vertical. About  
thirty radii of equal length, made of ſaſh glaſs cut in nar-  
row ſtrips, iſſue horizontally from the circumference of the  
board, the ends moſt diſtant from the center being about  
four inches apart. On the end of every one, a braſs. thim-  
ble is fixed. If now the wire of a bottle electrified in the  
  
5 common  
  
Larrzas on ElxcrTriciTY.” 29  
  
&quot;an common way, be brought near the circumference of this  
wheel, it will attract the neareſt thimble, and ſo put the  
  
  
ſpark, and thereby being electrified is repelled and fo dri-  
ven forwards ; while a ſecond being attracted, approaches  
the wire, receives a ſpark and is driven after the firſt, and  
ſo on till the wheel has gone once round, when the thim-  
bles before electrified approaching the wire, inſtead of being  
attracted as they were at firſt, are repelled, and the motion  
preſently ceaſes. --- But if another bottle which had been  
charged through the coating be placed near the fame  
wheel, its wire will attract the thi ble repelled by the  
firſt, and thereby double the force that carries the wheel  
round ; and not only taking out the fire that had been  
communicated to the thimbles by the firſt bottle, but even  
robbing them of their natural quantity, inſtead of being re-  
pelled when they come again towards the firſt bottle, they  
are more ſtrongly attracted, ſo that the wheel mends its  
pace, till it goes with great rapidity twelve or fifteen rounds  
in a minute, and with ſuch ſtrength, as that the weight of  
one hundred Spaniſb dollars with which we once loaded  
it, did not ſeem in the leaſt to retard its motion. --- This is  
called an electrical jack; and if a large fowl were ſpitted on  
the upright ſhaft, it would be carried round before a fire  
with a motion fit for roaſting.  
22. But this wheel, like thoſe driven by wind, water, or  
weights, moves by a foreign force, to wit, that of the bot-  
  
tles. The ſelf- moving wheel, though conſtructed on the

bullet communicating by a wire with the gilding of the up-  
per ſurface of the wheel; and about fix inches from it is  
another bullet communicating in like manner with the  
under ſurface. + When the wheel is to be charged by the  
upper ſurface, a communication muſt be made from the  
under ſurface to the table. When it is well charg d it be-  
gins to move; the bullet neareſt to a pillar moves towards  
the thimble on that pillar, and paſſing by electrifies it and  
then puſhes. itſelf from it ; the ſucceeding bullet, which  
communicates with the other ſurface of the glaſs, more  
ſtrongly attracts that thimble on account of its being be-  
  
fore  
  
Laras on Rigerarorey, 3 31  
  
fore eleRrified by the other bullet ; and thus the wheel cn»  
creaſes its motion till it comes to ſuch a height as that the  
reſiſtance of the air regulates it. . It will go half an hour,  
and make one minute with another twenty turns in a mi-  
nute, which is ſix hundred turns in the whole; the bul-  
let of the upper ſurface giving in each turn twelve ſparks,  
to the thimbles, which make ſeven thouſand two hun-  
.  dred ſparks; and the bullet of the under ſurface receiving  
as many from the thimbles ; thoſe bullets moying in the  
time near two thouſand five hundred feet. --- The thim-  
bles are well fixed, and in ſo exact a circle, that the bul-  
lets may paſs within a very ſmall diſtance of each of  
them. --- If inſtead of two bullets you put eight, four com-  
municating with the upper ſurface, and four with the un-  
der ſurface, placed alternately ; which eight, at about fix  
inches diſtance, compleats the circumference, the force and  
ſwiftneſs will be greatly increaſed, the wheel making fifty  
turns in a minute; but then it will not continue moving ſo  
long. Theſe wheels may be applied, perhaps, to the  
ringing of chimes, and moving of light-made Orreries.  
23. A ſmall wire bent circularly with a loop at each  
end; let one end reſt againſt the under ſurface of the  
wheel, and bring the other end near the upper ſurface,  
it will give a terrible crack, Ao the force will be  
diſcharged. __  
24. Every ſpark in that manner drawn 98 the ſurface  
of the wheel, makes a round hole in the gilding, tearing  
off a part of it in coming out; which ſhews that the fire

&gt;

is not accumulated on the gilding, but is 1 in the gli | 5

25. The gilding whe varniſh&#x27;d over with turpentine  
varniſh, the varniſh tho dry and hard, is burnt by the ſpark  
drawn thro&#x27; it, and gives a ſtrong ſmell and viſible ſmoke.  
And when the ſpark is drawn through paper, all round the  
hole made by it, the paper will be blacked by the ſmoke,  
which ſometimes penetrates ſeveral of the leaves. Part  
of the gilding torn off, is alſo found forcibly driven into  
che hole made in the paper by the ftroke.  
  
2856. &#x27;Tis amazing to obſerve in how ſmall a portion of  
laſs a great electrical force may lie. A thin glaſs bubble,  
about an inch diameter, weighing only fix grains, being  
half-filled with water, partly gilt on the outſide, and fur-  
_ niſh&#x27;d with a wire hook, gives, when electrified, as great  
a ſhock as a man can well bear. As the glaſs is thickeſt  
near the orifice, I ſuppoſe the lower half, which being gilt  
was electrified, and gave the ſhock, did not exceed two  
grains ; for it appeared, when broke, much thinner than  
the upper half. --- If one of theſe thin bottles be electrified  
by the coating, and the ſpark taken out thro” the gilding,  
it will break the glaſs inwards at the ſame time my *  
breaks the gilding outwards.  
  
27. And allowing (for the reaſons before given, $ 8, 9,  
10,) that there is no more electrical fire in a bottle after  
charging, than before, how great muſt be the quantity in  
this ſmall portion of glaſs | It-ſeems as if it were of its very  
ſubſtance and eſſence. Perhaps if that due quantity of  
  
electrical

? ſeparated from it, it would no longer be glaſs; it might  
loſe its tranſparency; or its brittleneſs, or its elaſticity. —  
Experiments may: ran be. e een, to fir  
cover this.  
27. We are e at the account Sven in Mr Wat.  
ſon&#x27;s bobk, of a ſhock communicated through a great ſpace  
of dry ground, and ſuſpect there muſt be ſome metaline  
quality in the gravel, of that ground; having found that  
ſimple. dry earth, rammed in a glaſs tube, open at both  
ends, and a wire hook inſerted in the earth at each end, the  
earth and wires making part of a circle, would not con-  
duct the leaſt perceptible ſhock, and indeed when one  
wite was electrify d, the other hardly ſhowed any ſigns of  
its being in connection with it. Even a thoroughly  
wet pack- thread ſometimes fails of condutting i: a ſhock,  
tho it otherwiſe conducts electricity very well. A dry  
cake of ice, or an icicle held between two in a circle, like-  
wiſe; prevents the ſhock ; which one would not expect, ＋  
water conducts ĩt ſo perfectly well. — Gilding on a new  
book, though at firſt it conducts the ſhock extremely well,

if the electrified phial is held in one hand by

as when held by the coating, and the hook apply d.

4. But the direction of the electrical fire being different  
[i h in the charging, will alſo be different in the exploſion.  
. The bottle charged thro&#x27; the hook, will be diſcharged thro  
the hook ; the bottle charged thro&#x27; the coating, will be  
diſcharged thro” the coating, and not otherways : for the  
fire muſt come out the ſame way it went in. .  
  
5. To prove this; take two bottles that were 3  
| charged hed Shocks, one in each hand ; bring their  
hooks near each other, and no ſpark or ſhock will follow;  
becauſe each hook is diſpoſed to give fire, and neither to -  
receive it. Set one of the bottles down on glaſs, take it up  
| oy the hook, and apply its coating to the hook of the  
other ; then there will be an exploſion and ſhock, and  
both: bottles will be diſcharged. ;  
  
6. Vary the experiment, by charging two ohials equally,  
one thro the hook, the other thro&#x27; the coating: hold that  
by the coating which was charged thro&#x27; the hook; and  
that by the hook which was charged thro&#x27; the coating: ap-  
ply the hook of the firſt to the coating of the other, and  
there will be no ſhock or ſpark. - Set that down&#x27; on glals  
which you held by the hook, take it up by the coating,  
and bring the two hooks together: a ſpark and ſhock will  
follow, and both phials be diſcharged. - |  
In this experiment the bottles are totally diſcharged, or  
the equilibrium within them reſtored. The abounding of  
fre in one of the hooks (or rather in the internal ſurface of  
  
one bottle) being exactly equal to the wanting of the other:  
  
and therefore, as each bottle has 1 in itſelf the abounding as  
| well

equal in each bottle. See F. 8, 9, 10, 11. But if a man  
holds in his hands two bottles, one fully electrify&#x27;d, the  
other not at all, and brings their hooks together, he has  
but half a ſhock, and the bottles will both remain half  
electrified, the one being half diſcharged, and the other  
half charged.  
  
7. Place two phials ty chlo on a table at five or  
  
  
thread, hang between them. If the phials were both  
charged through their hooks, the cork, when it has&#x27;been  
_ attracted and repell&#x27;d by the one, will not be attracted, but  
equally repelled by the other. But if the phials were  
charged, the one thro” the hook, and the other * thro* the  
coating, the ball, when it is repelled from one hook, will  
  
  
between them, till both phials are nearly diſcharged.  
  
8. When we uſe the terms of charging and d. ;ſcharging  
the phial, &#x27;tis in compliance with cuſtom, and for want of  
others more ſuitable. Since we are of opinion, that there  
  
  
called its charging, than before, nor leſs after its diſcbarging;  
excepting only the ſmall ſpark that might be given to,  
and taken from, the non. electric matter, if ſeparated from  
  
Bed To. charge a bottle mee b the coating, place it on  
  
a glaſs ſtand ; form a communication from the prime conductor to the  
coating, and another from the hook to the wall or flocr. When it is  
charged, remove the latter communication before you take hold of the  
bottle, W great part of the fire will eſcape by it. 1

the bottle, which ſpark. may not be equal to a five hun-  
dredth part of what is called the exploſion.  
  
For if, on the exploſion, the electrical fire came out of  
the bottle by one part, and did not enter in again by ano-  
ther; then, if a man ſtanding on wax, and holding the  
bottle in one hand, takes the ſpark by touching the wire  
  
  
for its eſcape : But the contrary is true.  
  
9. Beſides, the phial will not ſuffer what is called a  
charging, unleſs as much fire can go out of it one way, as  
is thrown in by another. A phial cannot be charged  
ſtanding on wax or glaſs, or hanging on the prime con-  
ductor, unleſs a communication be formed between its  
coating and the floor.  
  
10. But ſuſpend two or more phials on the prime con-  
Auctor, one hanging to the tail of the other; and a wire  
om the laſt to the floor, an equal number of turns of the  
heel ſhall charge them all equally, and every one as  
uch as one alone would have been. What is driven out  
  
t the tail of the firſt, ſerving to charge the ſecond ; what  
is driven out of the ſecond charging the third; and ſo on.  
By this means a great number of bottles might be charged  
with the fame labour, and equally high, with one alone,  
were it not that every bottle receives new fire, and loſes  
its old with ſome reluctance, or rather gives ſome ſmall re-

eomes more equal to the charging power, and ſo repels the  
fire back again on che u ne than a 20 bottle  
N would do.  
  
11. When a bottle is 0 in the common way, its  
inſide and outfide ſurfaces ſtand ready, the one to give fire  
by the hook, the other to receive it by the coating; the  
one is full, and ready to throw out, the other empty and  
extremely hungry; yet as the firſt will not give out, unleſs  
the other can at the ſame inſtant receive in; ſo neither will  
the latter receive in, unleſs the firſt can atthe ſame inſtant  
give out. When both can be done at once, tis done with  
inconceivable quickneſs and violence.  
  
12. So a ſtrait ſpring (tho&#x27; the compariſon does not a-  
gree in every particular) when forcibly bent, muſt, to re-  
ſtore itſelf, contract that fide which in the bending was ex-  
tended, and extend that which was contracted; if either of  
theſe two operations be hindered, the other cannot be  
done. But the ſpring is not ſaid to be charg&#x27;d with elaſti-  
city when bent, and diſcharg&#x27;d when bens: its Wed  
of elaſticity is always the ſame. |  
  
13. Glaſs, in like manner, has, within its ſubſtance, |  
always the ſame quantity of electrical fire, and that a very  
great quantity in proportion to the maſs of glaks as ſhall  
be ſhewn hereafter,”  
  
14. This quantity, eee to the olaks i it rongly  
and obſtinately retains, and will have neither more nor leſs,  
though it will ſuffer a change to be made in its parts and  
fituation ; 7. e. we may take away part of it from one  
  
| | | of

of the ſides, provided we throw an equal quantity into  
the other. 8  
  
15. Vet when the ſituation of the electrical fire i is they  
altered in the glaſs; when ſome has been taken from one  
ſide, and ſome added to the other, it will not be at reſt or  
in its natural ſtate, till *tis reſtored to its original equality. —  
And this reſtitution cannot be made through the ſubſtance  
of the glaſs, but muſt be done by a non- electric communi-  
cation formed without, from ſurface to ſurface.  
  
16. Thus, the whole force of the bottle, and power of  
giving a ſhock, is in the GLAss ITSELF; the non- electrics  
in conyract with the two ſurfaces, ſerving only to give and  
receive to and from the ſeveral parts of the glaſs; that is, to  
give on one ſide, and take away from the other.  
  
17. This was diſcovered here in the following manner:  
  
  
out the cork and wire which for that purpoſe had been  
looſely put in. Then taking the bottle in one hand, and  
bringing a finger of the other near its mouth, a ſtrong ſpark  
came from the water, and the ſhock was as violent as if the  
wire had remained in it, which ſhewed that the force did  
not lie in the wire. Then to find if it reſided in the water,  
being crouded into and condenſed in it, as confin&#x27;d by&#x27;the  
glaſs, which had been our former opinion, we electrify&#x27;d  
the bottle again, and placing it on glaſs, drew out the wire  
and cork as before; then taking up the bottle, we decanted  
all its water into an empty bottle, which likewiſe ſtood on  
glaſs 3  
  
LTT EROS on ELECTRICITY. | 25  
  
glaſs; and taking up that other bottle, we expected if the  
force reſided in the water, to find a ſhock from it; but  
there was none. We judged then, that it muſt either be  
loſt in decanting, or remain in the firſt bottle. The latter  
ve found to be true: for that bottle on trial gave the ſhock,  
though filled up as it ſtood with freſh unelectrified water  
from a tea-pot.— To find then, whether glaſs had this  
property merely as glaſs, or whether the form contributed  
any thing to it; we took a pane of ſaſh-glaſs, and laying  
it on the Fand, placed a plate of lead on its upper furface ;  
then eleQrify&#x27;d that plate, and bringing a finger to it, there  
was a ſpark and ſhock. We then took two plates of lead  
of equal dimenſions, but leſs than the *glaſs by two inches  
every way, and eleQrified the glaſs between them, by  
electrifying the uppermoſt lead; then ſeparated the glaſs  
from the lead, in doing which, what little fire might  
be in the lead was taken out, and the glaſs being touched  
in the eleQrified parts with a finger, afforded only very  
ſmall pricking ſparks, but a great number of them might  
be taken from different places. Then dexterouſly placing |  
it again between the leaden plates, and compleating a  
circle between the two ſurfaces, à violent ſhock” en-  
ſued. — Which demonſtrated the power to reſide in  
glaſs as glaſs, and that the non- electries in contact ſerved  
only, like the armature of a loadſtone, to unite the force  
of the ſeveral parts, and bring them at once to any point  
deſired: it being a property of a non- electric, that the  
  
C E . 12 Whole  
  
  
16 Mr B FRANK LIN.  
  
whole body inſtantly receives or gives what electrical fire  
is given to or taken from any one of its parts.  
  
18. Upon this, we made what we call&#x27;d an eletrical-  
battery, conſiſting of eleven panes of large ſaſh-glafs, artn&#x27;d &#x27;  
with thin leaden plates paſted on each ſide, placed verti-  
cally, and ſupported at two inches diſtance on filk cords,  
with thick hooks of leaden wire, one from each ſide,  
ſtanding upright, diſtant from each other, and convenient  
communications of wire and chain, from the giving fide of  
one pane, to the receiving fide of the other; that fo the  
whole might be charged together, and with the fame la-  
bour as one ſingle pane ; and another contrivance to bring  
the giving fides, after charging, in contract with one long  
wire, and the receivers with another, which two long  
wires would give the force of all the plates of glafs at once  
through the body of any animal forming the circle with  
them. The plates may alſo be diſcharged ſeparately, or  
any number together that is required. But this machine  
is nat much uſed, as not perfectly anſwering our intention  
with regard to the eaſe of charging, for the reaſon.  
given f. 10. We made alſo of large glaſs panes, magical  
pictures, and ſelf-moving animated wheels, pig to be  
deſcribed.  
  
19. I perceive by ti ingenious Mr Watſon&#x27;s laſt book;  
lately received, that Dr Bevis had uſed, before we had,  
panes of glaſs to give a ſhock ; though, till that book came  
to hand, I thought to have communicated it to you as a  
novelty. The excuſe for mentioning it here is, that we  
  
LTT ERS en ELER IrTr. 27  
tried the experiment differently, drew different conſe-  
quences from it, (for Mr Watſon ſtill ſeems to think the  
fire accumulated on the non-eleFric that is in contact with  
the glaſs, page 72) and, as far as we hitherto 1 have  
carried it farther, | _  
  
20. The magical picture i is made thus. Haage  
metꝛzotinto with a frame and glaſs, ſuppoſe of the Kine,  
(God preſerve him) take out the print, and cut a pannel  
out of it, near two inches diſtant from the frame all round.  
If the cut is through the picture tis not the worſe. With  
thin paſte, or gum- water, fix the border that is cut off on  
the inſide of the glaſs, preſſing it ſmooth and cloſe ; then  
fill up. the vacancy by gilding the glaſs well with leaf gold  
or braſs; Gild likewiſe the inner edge of the back of the  
frame all round except the top part; and form a commu-  
nication between that gilding and the gilding behind the  
glaſs : then put in the board, and that fide is finiſhed.  
Turn up the glaſs, and gild the fore fide exactly over the  
back gilding; ahd when. it is dry; cover it by paſting on  
the. pannel of thie picture that hath been cut out, obſerving  
to bring the correſpondent parts of the border and picture  
together, by which the picture will appear of a piece as at  
firſt, only part is behind the . aſs, and patt before. Hold  
the picture horizontally by the top; and place a little

ſo on till the wheel has gone once round, when the thim-

attracted as they were at firſt, are repelled; and the motion  
preſently ceaſes. But if another bottle which had been  
charged through the coating be placed near the ſame  
wheel, its wire will attract the thimble repelled by the  
firſt, and thereby double the force. that carries the wheel  
round; and not only taking out the fire that had been  
communicated to the thimbles by the firſt bottle, but even  
robbing them of their natural quantity, inſtead of being re-  
pelled when they come again towards the firſt bottle, they  
are more ſtrongly attracted, ſo that the wheel mends its  
pace, till it goes with great rapidity twelve or fifteen rounds  
ina minute, and with ſuch ſtrength, as that the weight of  
one hundred Spaniſb dollars with which we once loaded  
it, did not ſeem in the-leaſt to retard its motion; — This is  
called an electrical jack; and if a large fowl were ſpitted  
on the upright ſhaft, it would be carried round before a  
we with a motion fit for roaſting. | :  
  
22. But this wheel, like thoſe driven wa wind water, or  
8 moves by a foreign force, to wit, that of the bot-  
tles. The ſelf- moving wheel, though conſtructed on the  
  
ſame  
  
30 Mr B. FRANK LIN“s  
  
ſame principles, appears more ſurpriſing. Tis made of a  
thin round plate of window=glaſs, ſeventeen inches diame-  
ter, well gilt on both fides, all but two inches next the  
edge. Two ſmall hemiſpheres of wood are then fixed  
with cement to the middle of the upper and under ſides,  
centrally oppoſite, and in each of them a thick ſtrong wire  
eight or ten inches long, which together make the axis of  
&quot;the wheel. It turns horizontally on a point at the lower  
  
end of its axis, which reſts on a bit of braſs cemented  
within a glaſs ſalt-cellar. The upper end of its axis paſſes  
thro&#x27; a hole in a thin braſs plate cemented to a long ſtrong  
piece of glaſs, which keeps it fix or eight inches diſtant  
from any non electric, and has a ſmall ball of wax or me-  
tal on its top to keep in the fire. In a circle on the table  
which ſupports the wheel, are fixed twelve ſmall pillars of  
glaſs, at about four inches diſtance, with a thimble on the  
top of each. On the edge of the wheel is a ſmall leaden  
bullet, communicating by a wire with the gilding of the  
upper ſurface of the wheel; and about fix inches from it  
is another bullet communicating in like manner with the  
under ſurface. When the wheel is to be charged by the  
upper ſurface; a communication muſt be made from the  
under ſurface to the table. When it is well charged it be-

Fore eletrified by the other bullet ; and thus the wheel en-  
creaſes its motion till it comes to ſuch a height as that the  
refiftance of the air regulates it. It will go half an hour,  
and make one minute with another twenty turns in a mi-  
nute, which is fix hundred turns in the whole; the bul- |  
let of the upper ſurface giving in each turn twelve ſparks, |  
„ makes ſeven thouſand two hun-  
dred ſparks; and the bullet of the under ſurſace receiving  
as many from the thimbles; thoſe bullets moving in the  
time near two thouſand five hundred feet. The thim-  
bles are well fixed, and in fo exact a circle, that the bul-  
lets may paſs within a very ſmall diſtance of each of |  
them, If inſtead of two bullets you put eight, four com-  
municating with the upper ſurface, and four with the un-  
der ſurface, placed alternately z which eight, at about fix  
inches diftance, completes the circumference, the force and  
ſwiftneſs will be greatly increaſed, the wheel making fifty  
turns in a minute; but then it will not continue moving ſo  
long. Fheſe wheels may be applied, perhaps, to the  
ringing of chimes, and moving of light- made Orreties.  
23. A (mall wire bent circularly with a loop at each  
end; let one. end reſt againſt the under ſurface of the  
wheel, and bring the other end nearer the upper furface,

which ſometimes penetrates ſeveral of the leaves. Part  
of the gilding torn off, is alſo found 1 driven into  
the hole made in the paper by the ſtroke. |  
  
26. Tis amazing to obſerve in how ſmall a portion! of  
  
  
about an inch diameter, weighing only fix grains, being  
  
half filled with water, partly gilt on the outſide, and fur- fur-  
niſh&#x27;d with a wire hook, gives, when electrified, as great

was electriſied, and gave the ſhock, did not exceed two  
grains; for it appeared, when broke, much thinner than  
  
  
by the coating, and the ſpark taken out thro&#x27; the gilding,  
it will break the glaſs inwards at the ſame time that it  
n the gilding outwards.  
  
27. And allowing (for the be Wa given, &amp; 3, 9,  
29 ) that there is no more electrical fire in a bottle aſter  
charging, than before, how great muſt be the quantity in  
this ſmall portion of glaſs! It ſeems as if it were of its very  
ſubſtance and eſſence. Perhaps if that due quantity of

ſeparated from it, it would no longer be glaſs; it might

ends, and a wire hook inſerted in the earth at each end, the  
earth and wires making part of a circle, would not con- N  
duct the leaſt perceptible ſhock, and indeed when one  
wire was electrify d, the other hardly ſhowed any ſigns of  
its being in connection with it.— Even 4 thoroughly  
wet pack-thread ſometimes fails of conducting a ſhock,  
tho&#x27; it otherwiſe conducts cledricity very well. A dry  
cake of ice, or an icicle held ule; like-  
wiſe prevents the ſhock; which one would not expect, as

put an end to them for this season somewhat

the amazement of many. A turkey is to be  
killed for dinner by the electrical shock, and  
roasted by the electrical jack, before a fire kin-

FRANKLIN, writing to his friend Peter Collison,  
F.RS., in 1748, says, “It is amazing to see in how  
small a portion of glass a great electrical force may  
lie. A thin glass bubble, about an inch in diameter,  
weighing only six grains, being half filled with  
water, partly gilt on the outside, and furnished with  
a wire hook, gives, when electrified, as great a shock  
as a man well can bear.”

frame and glass. Cut the print out at  
about two inches from the frame all  
round. Then, ?with tViin paste, fix the  
border that is left on the inside of the  
glass, pressing it smooth andjclose.  
Fill up the vacancy by covering the  
glass well with leaf gold or thin tin-  
foil, so that it may lie close. Cover  
likewise the inner edge of the bottom  
part of the back of the frame with the  
same tinfoil, and make a communication  
between that and the tin?r„;i {n fho  
otiMATp nf fhe triads. Then Tint in the  
hoard, and that side it finished. Next  
turn up the glass, and cover the fore  
side with tin-foil exactly over that on  
the back part, and when it is dry paste  
over it the panel of the print that ?was  
cut out. Observe to bring the  
corresponding parts of border and panel  
tegether, so that the picture will  
appear as at first, only part of it  
behind the glass, and part before.  
Lastly, hold the print horizontally by  
the top, and place a little movable gilt  
crown on the portrait — suppose that of  
Queen &#x27;Victoria. Now, if the tin foil on  
both sides of the glass be moderately  
electrified, and another person takeg  
hold of the bottom of the frame with one  
hand, so that his fingers touch the tin-  
foil, and with tbe other hand attempts  
to take off the crown, he will receive a  
very smart blow, and fail in the  
attempt. The operator, who holds the  
frame by the upper end where there is no  
tin-foil, feels nothing of the sheet,  
and can touch the face of the Queen  
without danger, which he pretends is a  
test of his loyalty

or gum-water, fix the border that is cut off on the  
inside the glass, pressing it smooth and close; then  
fill up the vacancy by gilding the glass well with  
leaf-gold or brass. Gild likewise the inner edge of  
the back of the frame all round, except the top

gilding and the gilding behind the glass; then put  
in the board, and that side is finished. Turn up the  
glass, and gild the fore side exactly over the back  
gilding, and when it is dry, cover it by pasting on  
the pannel of the picture that hath been cut out,

terrible blow, and fail in the attempt. If the  
picture were highly charged, the consequence  
might perhaps be as fatal as that of high treason;  
for, when the spark is taken through a quire of  
paper laid on the picture by means of a wire com-  
munication, it makes a fair hole through every  
sheet, that is, through forty-eight leaves, though  
a quire of paper is thought good armour against  
the push of a sword, or even against a pistol  
bullet, and the crack is exceeding loud. The  
operator, who holds the picture by the upper end,  
where the inside of the frame is not gilt, to pre-  
vent its falling, feels nothing of the shock, and  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
may touch the face of the picture without danger,

experiment is called The Conspirators.
