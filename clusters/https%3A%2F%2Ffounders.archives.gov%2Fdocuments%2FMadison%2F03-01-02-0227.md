[23 May 1809]  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.  
On this first occasion of meeting you, it affords me much satisfaction to be able to communicate the commencement of a favorable change, in our foreign relations; the critical state of which induced a Session of Congress at this early period.  
In consequence of the provisions of the act, interdicting commercial intercourse with Great Britain and France, our Ministers at London and Paris were, without delay, instructed to let it be understood by the French and British Governments, that the authority vested in the Executive, to renew Commercial intercourse with their respective nations, would be exercised, in the case specified by that Act.  
Soon after these instructions were dispatched, it was found that the British Government, anticipating, from early proceedings of Congress at their last Session, the state of our laws which has had the effect of placing the two belligerent powers on a footing of equal restrictions, and relying on the conciliatory disposition of the United States, had transmitted to their Legation here, provisional instructions, not only to offer satisfaction for the attack on the frigate Chesapeake, and to make known the determination of His Britannic Majesty to send an Envoy Extraordinary with powers to conclude a Treaty on all the points between the two Countries; but, moreover, to signify his willingness, in the mean time, to withdraw his Orders in Council, in the persuasion that the intercourse with Great Britain would be renewed on the part of the United States.  
These steps of the British Government, led to the correspondence and the Proclamation now laid before you; by virtue of which, the commerce between the two Countries, will be renewable after the tenth day of June next.  
Whilst I take pleasure in doing justice to the Counsels of His Britannic Majesty, which, no longer adhering to the policy which made an abandonment by France of her Decrees, a pre-requisite to a revocation of the British Orders, have substituted the Amicable course which has issued thus happily; I cannot do less than refer to the proposal heretofore made on the part of the United States, embracing a like restoration of the suspended commerce; as a proof of the spirit of accommodation which has at no time been intermitted; and to the result which now calls for our congratulations, as corroborating the principles by which the public Councils have been guided, during a period of the most trying embarrassments.  
The discontinuance of the British Orders, as they respect the United States, having been thus arranged, a communication of the event has been forwarded in one of our public vessels, to our Minister Plenipotentiary at Paris; with instructions to avail himself of the important addition thereby made, to the considerations which press on the justice of the French Government, a revocation of its decrees, or such a modification of them, as that they shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States.  
The revision of our Commercial laws, proper to adapt them to the arrangement which has taken place with Great Britain, will doubtless engage the early attention of Congress. It will be worthy, at the same time, of their just and provident care, to make such further alterations in the laws, as will more especially protect and foster the several branches of manufacture, which have been recently instituted or extended, by the laudable exertions of our Citizens.  
Under the existing aspect of our affa[i]rs, I have thought it not inconsistent with a just precaution, to have the Gun-Boats, with the exception of those at New Orleans, placed in a situation, incurring no expence beyond that requisite for their preservation and conveniency for future service; and to have the crews of those at New Orleans, reduced to the number required for their navigation and safety.  
I have thought also, that our Citizens detached in quotas of Militia amounting to one hundred thousand, under the Act of March 1808, might not improperly, be relieved from the state in which they were held for immediate service. A discharge of them has been accordingly directed.  
The progress made in raising and organizing the additional military force, for which provision was made by the Act of April 1808, together with the disposition of the troops, will appear by a Report which the Secretary of War is preparing, and which will be laid before you.  
Of the additional Frigates required by an Act of the last Session, to be fitted for actual service, two are in readiness; one nearly so, and the fourth is expected to be ready, in the month of July. A report which the Secretary of the Navy is preparing on the subject, to be laid before Congress, will shew at the same time, the progress made in officering and manning these ships. It will shew also, the degree in which the provisions of the act relating to the other public armed ships, have been carried into execution.  
It will rest with the judgment of Congress to decide, how far the change in our external prospects, may authorize any modifications of the laws, relating to the Army and Navy establishments.  
The works of defence for our sea port towns and harbours, have proceeded with as much activity, as the season of the year, and other circumstances would admit. It is necessary, however, to state, that the appropriations hitherto made, being found to be deficient, a further provision will claim the early consideration of Congress.  
The whole of the Eight per Cent stock remaining due by the United States, amounting to five millions three hundred thousand dollars, had been re-imbursed on the last day of the year 1808. And on the first day of April last, the sum in the Treasury exceeded nine and a half millions of dollars. This, together with the receipts of the current year on account of former revenue bonds, will probably be nearly, if not altogether sufficient, to defray the expences of the year. But the suspension of exports and the consequent decrease of importations, during the last twelve months, will necessarily cause a great diminution in the receipts of the year 1810. After that year, should our foreign relations be undisturbed, the revenue will again be more than commensurate to all the expenditures.  
Aware of the inconveniences of a protracted Session, at the present season of the year, I forbear to call the attention of the Legislature to any matters not particularly urgent. It remains therefore, only to assure you of the fidelity and alacrity with which I shall co-operate for the welfare and happiness of our Country; and to pray that it may experience a continuance of the Divine blessings, by which it has been so signally favored.

436 THE GLEANER, kc.  
  
of July. A report, which the secretary of the navy is prepar-

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of  
the House of Representatives  
ON this first occasion of meeting  
you it affords rne much satisfaction, to  
be able to communicate the commence­  
ment of a favorable change in our fo­  
reign relations ; the critical state of  
which induced a session of Congress at  
this early period.  
In consequence of the provisions of  
the act interdicting commercial inter­  
course with Great Britain ar.J France,  
our Ministers at London and Paris  
were, without delay, instructed to let  
1 it be understood by the French and  
British governments, that tbe authori­  
ty vested in the Executive, to renew  
! commercial intercourse with their re­  
spective nations would be exercised  
in the case specified by that act.  
Soon after these instructions were  
dispatched, it was found that the Bri­  
  
&#x27;tish government, anticipating from  
1 early proceeding* of Congress at their  
last session, the state, of our laws,  
1 which has had the effect of placing  
! the two belligerent powers on a foot­  
ing of equal restrictions, and relying  
jon the conciliatory disposition of the  
\ United .States, had transmitted to their  
! I.egation here, provisional instructions,  
I not only to offer satisfaction for the  
attack on the frigate Chesapeake, and  
to make kuown the determination of  
his Britannic Majesty, to send an Kn­  
vov extraordinary with powers to con­  
clude a treaty on all points between  
the two countries ; but moreover, to  
signify his willingness, in the mean  
time, to withdraw his orders in coun­  
cil, in the persuasion that the inter­  
course with Great Britain would be  
renewed on the part of the United  
States.  
These steps of the British govern­  
ment led to the correspondence and  
the Proclamation now laid before you ;  
by virtue of which, the commerce be­  
tween the two countries will be renew­  
able after the tenth day of June next.  
Whilst I take pleasure in doing jus­  
tice to the counsels of his Britannic  
Majesty, which, no longer adhering to  
the policv which made an abandon­  
ment by Prance, of her decrees, a pre­  
requisite to a revocation of the British  
order*, have subsituted the amicable  
course which has resued thus happily ;  
I cannot do less than refer to the pro­  
posal hereteforc made on the part of  
the United States embracing a like re­  
storation of the suspended commerce,  
as a proof of the spirit of accommoda­  
tion wSich has at no time been inter­  
muted, and to the result which now  
  
calls for our congratulations, as corrob­  
erating the principles, by which the pu­  
blic councils have been guided during ;  
a period of the most trying embarrass­  
ments.  
The discontinuance of the British  
orders, as they respect the U. States,  
having been thus arranged, a commu­  
nication of the event has been forward - &#x27;  
ed, in one of our public vessels, to oar |  
Minister Plenipotentiary at Paris ; j  
with instructions to avail himself of the  
important addition thereby made, to  
the considerations which press on the  
justice of the French government a re­  
vocation of its decrees, or such a modi­  
fication of them, as that they shall cease  
l to violate the neutral commerce of the  
| United States.  
I The revision of our commercial  
laws, proper to adapt them to the ar­  
rangement which has talien place with  
Great Britain, will doubtless engage  
the early attention of Congress. 11  
will be worthy, at the same time, of  
theirjust and provident care, to make  
such further alterations in the laws, at  
will more especially protect and foster  
the several branches of manufacture,  
xvhich have been recently instituted or  
extended by the laudable exertions of  
our citizens.  
Under the existing aspect of our af­  
fairs, I have thought it not inconsistent  
with a just precaution, to have the gun­  
boats, with the exception of those at  
New-Orlearts, placed in a situation, in­  
curring on expence beyond that requi­  
  
site for tncir preservation, and conve­  
niency for future service, and to have  
the crews of those at New-Orlears re­  
duced to the n umber required for their  
navigation and safety.  
I have thought also, that our citizens  
detached in quotas of militia, amount­  
ing to one hundred thousand, under  
the act of March 1308, might, not im­  
properly, be relieved from he state in  
which they were held for immediate  
service. A discharge of them has  
been accordingly directed,  
i The progress made in raising and  
organizing the additional military  
force, for which provision was made  
by the act of April 1808, together with  
the disposition of the troops, will ap­  
pear by a report which th * Secretary of  
War is preparing, and which will be  
laid before you.  
Of the additional frigates required,  
by an act of the last session, to be fit­  
ted for actual service, two are in rea­  
diness, one nearly so, and the fourtn is  
expected to be ready in the month of  
July. A report which the Secretary  
of the Navy is preparing on the sub­  
ject, to be laid before Congress, will  
shew at the same time, the progress  
made in officering and manning these  
ships. It will shew also the degree in  
in which the provisions of the act, re­  
lating to the other public armed vessels,  
have been carried into execution.  
It will rest with the judgm nt of  
Congress, to decide how far the change  
in our external prospects may author­  
ize any modifications of the laws rela­  
ting to the army and navy establish­  
ments.  
The works of defence for our sea­  
port towns and harbors have proceed­  
ed with as much-activity, as the season  
of the year, and other circumstances  
would admit. It is necessary however  
to state, that the appropriations hither­  
to made being found to be deficient, a  
  
further provision will claim the early  
consideration of Congress,  
The whole of the eight per Cent­  
stock remaining due by the U. States,  
amounting to five millions, three hun­  
dred thousand dollars, hud been reim­  
bursed on the last day of the year 1808  
And on the first day of April last, the  
sum in the Treasury exceeded nine  
and a half millions of dollars. This,  
together with the receipts of the cur­  
rent year on account of former reven­  
ue bonds, will probably be nearly, if  
not altogether sufficient to defrav t ie  
expenses of the year. But the sus­  
pension of exports and the consequent  
decrease of importations, during the  
lust twelve months, will necessarily  
cause a great diminution in the re­  
ceipts of the year 1810. After that  
year, should our foreign relations be  
undisturbed, the revenue will again be  
more than commensurate to all the ex­  
penditures.  
Aware of the inconveniences of a  
protracted session, at the present sea^  
son of the year, I forbear to call the ati  
tendon of the Legislature to any mut­  
ters net particularly urgent. It re­  
mains therefore only to assure you of  
the fidelity and alacrity, with which £  
shall ce-operate for the welfare and  
happiness of our country; and to pray  
that it may experience a continuance of  
the divine blessings by which it has  
been so sigfiaily favored.

Fellow Citizens of thr Seriate,  
unit of the Jlowsc oj Re fir eventdtive.i.  
ON this First occasion of meeting you, it  
affords me much satisfaction, to he able to  
communicate the commencement of a favor­  
able change in onr foreign relations ; the cri­  
tical state of which induced a session of Con­  
gress at this early period.  
In consequence of the provisions of the act  
interdicting commercial intercourse with G.  
Britain ami France, our Ministers at Lon­  
don and Paris were, without delay, instruct­  
ed to let it he understood bv the French and  
British governments, that the authority ves­  
ted in the Executive, to renew commercial  
intercourse with their respective nations  
would be exercised in the case specified bv  
that act.  
Soon after these instructions were dispatch­  
ed, it was found that the British government  
anticipating from early proceedings of Con­  
gress at their last session, the state of our  
laws, which has had the effect of placing the  
two belligerent powers on a footing of equal  
restrictions, and relying on the conciliatory  
disposition of the United States, had trans­  
mitted to their Legation here, provisional  
instructions, not only to offer satisfaction for  
the attack, on the frigate Chesapeake, and to  
make known thj determination of his Bri­  
tannic Majesty, to send an Envoy Extraor  
dinary with powers to conclude a treaty on  
all points between the two countriesj but,  
moreover, to signify his willingness, in the  
menu time, to withdraw his orders in coun­  
cil, in^the pci suasion tuat the intercourse  
with Great Britain would be renewed on the  
pan ot the U. States.  
Fhese steps otthe British government led  
to the correspondence and the proclamation  
now laid before von; by virtue of which, the  
commerce between the two countries will be  
renewable aiier the tenth day of Julie next  
W lulst 1 take pleasure, in doing justice to  
the counsels ol his Britannic Majestv, which  
no longer adhering to the poJicv which made  
an abandonment by Fi ance of&quot; her decrees  
a pre-requisite to a revocation of the British  
orders, have substituted the amicable course  
which has issued thus happily ; I cannot do  
less than rcer to the proposal heretofore  
mai.e on the pat t of the U. States, embracing  
a like restoration of the suspended commerce  
as a proof of the spirit of accommodation  
whioli has at no time been intermitted, and  
to the result which now calls for our congra­  
tulations, as corroborating the principles, by  
wrucli the public councils have been guided  
during a period of tiie tiiost trying embar­  
rassments.  
  
\,1C discontinuance of the British orders  
as they respect the U. States, having been  
thus arranged, a communication ot&#x27; the event  
lias been forwarded, in one of our public ves­  
sels, to our minister Plenipotentiary at Pa­  
ris; with instructions to avail himself of the  
important addition thereby made, to the con­  
siderations which press on the Justice of the  
trench government, a revocation of its de­  
crees, or such a modification of them, as that  
they shall cease to violate, the neutral com­  
merce of the U. S.  
1 lie revision of our commercial laws, pro­  
per to adapt them to the arrangement which  
has taken place with Great Britain, will  
doubtless engage the early attention of Con­  
*!*&quot;*•. ^ w&#x27;ll be worthy, at the same time,  
of their just and provident care, to make  
such further alterations in the laws, as will  
more especially protect and faster theseve­  
ral branches of manufacture, which have  
been recently instituted or extended by the  
laudable exertions of our citizens.  
Undvr the existing aspect of our affairs, I  
have thought it not inconsistent with a just  
precaution to have the gm«- boats, with the  
exception of those at New Orleans, placed  
m a situation. Incurring no expence beyond  
that requisite for their preservation, and con -  
vemency far future service, and to have the  
crews of those at New Orleans reduced to  
the number required for their navigation &amp;  
  
I have thought also, that our citizens de­  
tached in quotas ofmilitia; amounting toone  
iiamlred thousand, under the act of March,  
Jr08* m,8ht not Improperly, be relieved from  
the state in which they were held for imme­  
diate service. A discharge of them has been  
accordingly directed.  
.v * heprogress made in raising &amp; organising  
the additional military force, for which provi­  
sion was made by the act of April 1808. toge­  
ther with the disposition of the troops, will ap­  
pear by a report which the Secretary of War  
is preparing, &amp; which will be laid before you.  
&#x27;V.. ^dditional frigates required by an  
act of tint last seasion, t» be fittel lor actual  
  
service, two st*vHi readiness, one nearly s&gt;,  
nnd the fourth is expected to be reaily in the  
month of July. A report which the Secreta­  
ry of the Navy is preparing on the subjec’,  
to be laid before Congress, will shew at the  
same time, the progress made in officerin&#x27;  
and manning these ships. It will shew also  
the degree, in which the provisions of the  
act relating to the other public armed vessels,  
have been carried into execution.  
If will rest with the judgment of Congress,  
to decide how far the change in our external  
prospects may authorise any modifications  
ot the laws relating to the army and navy  
establishments.  
The works of defence for onr seaport towns  
and harbors have proceeded with as much  
..ctivity as the season of the year, and other  
circumstances would admit. It is necessary  
however to state, that the appropriations hi­  
therto made being found to he deficient, a fur­  
ther provision will claim the early considera­  
tion of Congress.  
. The whole of the eight per cent, stock re­  
in lining due by the United States, a nount­  
ing to five millions, three hundred thousand,  
dollars, had been reimbursed on the last  
day of the year 1U08. And on the first day  
of April last, the sum in the Treasury ex­  
ceeded nine and a half millions of dollars.  
[ l *l*s&lt; together with the receipts of the cm­  
rent year on account of former revenue bonds,  
will probably be nearly, if not altogether  
sufficient to defray thu expences of the year.  
But the suspension of exports and the const*­  
quent decrease of importations, during tiie  
last twelve months, will necessarily cause a  
great diminution in the receipts ot the year  
I’ilO. After that year, should our foreign  
relations be undisturbed, the revenue will  
again be more than commensurate to all the  
expenditures.  
A ware of the inconveniencics of a pro­  
tracted session, at the present season of the  
year, I forbear to call the attention of the  
Legislature to any matters not particulai ly  
urgent. It remains therefore only to assure  
you ot the fidelity and alacrity, with which  
I shall co-operate for the welfare hih! happi­  
ness of our country ; and to prav that it may  
| experience a continuance of the divine bles­  
i sings by&quot; which it lias been so signally favor*

on- in the bows, as will more especially protect .rid  
f ter the several branches of mancil&#x27;acture, which  
have !&gt;een recently instituted or extended by the lau­  
d- le exertions of our citizens.  
Under the existing aspect of nnr affairs, I have  
thought it net inconsistent with a just precaution, to  
iMie the gun-boats, with the exception of those at  
Ne w-Orleans, placed in a siiuuticn, incurring no ex­  
pense bey..nd that requisite for their preservation,  
and conveniency for future service, and to have the  
n ews of those at New-Orleans reduced to the num­  
ber required for their navigation and safety.  
I have thought also, that our citizens detached in  
quotas of militia, amounting to one hundred thous­  
and, under the act of March, 1808, might, not im­  
properly, be relieved from the state in which they  
were held for inimedi ite service. A discharge of  
them has been accordingly directed.  
1 he progress made in raising and organizing the  
additional military force* for which provision was  
made by the act of April, 1802, together with the  
disposition of the troops, will appear by a report  
which the secretary ot war is preparing, and wiiich  
will be laid before y* iu  
  
W. inc auimionai rngates required bv an act of the  
last session, lobe fitted for actual service, two are  
in readiness,one nearly so, and the fourth unexpect­  
ed to be ready in the month of July. A report which  
the secretary of the navy is preparing on the sub­  
ject, to be laid before congress, will shew at the  
same time, the progress made in officering and  
manning these ships. It will shew also the degree  
in which the provisions of the act, relating to other  
publick armed vessels have been carried into exe­  
cution.  
It will rest with the judgment of congress to de­  
ckle how the change in our external prospects may  
authorise any modifications of* the laws relating to  
the at-my and navy establishments.  
The works of defence for our seaport towns and  
harbours have proceeded with as much activity, as  
the season of the year, and other circumstances  
would admit. It is necessary, however, to state,  
that the appropriations hitherto made being found to  
be deficient, a further provision will claim the early  
consideration of congress. 7  
The whole of the eight per cent, stork remaining  
,lue by the United States, amount to five miHions*  
threti i u di ed thousand dollars, had be n reimburs­  
ed oo the last day of the year 1808 And on the  
histday of April lust, the&#x27;sum in the Treasury ex­  
ceeded nine and an half millions id i-llars. This,  
together with the receipts of the current year on  
aeeount of firmer revenue bonds, will probably ba  
nearly, if not altogether sufficient to d-&#x27;.ray the ex­

in our foreign relations ; the critical state of which, induced a session  
of Congress at this period.  
  
In consequence of the provisions of the act interdicting commercial  
intercourse with Great Britain and France, our ministers at London  
and Paris were, without delay, instructed to let it be understood by  
the French and British governments, that the authority vested in the  
executive, to renew commercial intercourse with their respective na-  
tions, would be exercised in the case specified by that act.  
  
Soon after these instructions were dispatched, it was found that the  
British government, anticipating, from early proceedings of congress  
at their last session, the state of our laws, which has had the effect of  
placing the twobelliger ent powers on a footing of equal restrictions, and  
relying on the conciliatory disposition of the United States, had trans-  
mitted to their legation here, provisional instructions, not only to offer  
satisfaction for the attack on the frigate Chesapeake, and to make  
Known the determination of his Britannic majesty, to send an envoy  
extraordinary with powers to conclude a treaty on all points: between  
the two countries; but, moreover, to signify his willingness, in the  
mean time, to withdrew his Orders in Council in the persuasion that  
the intercourse with Great Britain would be renewed on the part of  
the U. States.  
  
These steps of the British government led to the correspondence  
and the proclamation now laid before you; by virtue of which the  
commerce between the two countries will be renewable after the tenth  
day of June next. .  
  
Whilst I take pleasure in doing justice to the councils of his Bri-  
tannic majesty, which no longer adhering to the policy which - made  
an abandonment by France, of her decrees, a pre-requisite to a revo-  
cation of the British Orders, have substituted the amicahle course  
which has issued thus happily ; I cannot do less than-refer to the pro-  
posal heretotore made on the part of the United States entbracmg a  
like restoration of the suspended commerce: as a proof of the spirit of  
accommodation which has at no time been intermitted, and to the re-  
sult which now calis for our congratulaticos, as corrobor: ating the  
principles by which the public councils have been guided during a pe-  
riod of the most trying embarrassments.  
  
The discontinuance of the British orders, as they respect the U.  
States, having been thus arranged, a communication of the event has  
been forwarded, in one of our public vessels, to our Minister Plenipo-  
tentiary at Paris ; ; with instructions to avail himself of the important  
addition thereby made, to the considerations which press on the jus-  
tice of the French government a revocation of its decrees, or such a  
modification of them, as they shall cease to violate the neutral com-  
merce. of the United States.  
  
The revision of our commercial laws, proper to adapt them to the  
arrangement which - has taken place with Great Britain, will doubt-  
less engage the early attention of Congress. Jt will be worthy, at the  
same time, of their just and provident care, to make such further al-  
terations in the laws, as will more especially protect and foster the  
several branches of manufacture which have been recently instituted  
or extended by the laudable exertions of our citizens.  
  
It will rest with the judgment of congress to decide how far the  
change in our external prospects may authorise any modifications of  
the laws relating to the army and navy establishments.

cumstances wauld admit. It is necessary, however, to state, that the  
_appropriations hitherto made being found tobe deficient, a further  
  
provision will claim the early consideration of Congress.  
  
The whole of the eight per cent stock remaining due by the United  
States, amounting to five millions three hundred thou sand dollars had  
been reimbursed on the last day of the year 1808. And on the first  
day of April last, the sum in the treasury exceeded nine and an half  
millions of dollars. ‘This, together with the receipts of the current  
year, on account of former revenue bonds, will pronabiy be neagy, if  
not altogether sufficient to defray the expences of the year. But the  
suspension of exports and the consequent decrease of importations  
during the last twelve menaths will necessarily cause a great diminu-  
.tion in the receipts of the year 1810. After that year, should our for-  
eign relations be undisturbed, the revenue will again be more than  
commensurate to all the expenditures.  
  
Under the existing aspect of our affairs, I have thought it not in-  
consistent with a a just precaution, to have the gun-boats, with the ex-  
ception of those at New Orleans, placed in a situation, incurring no ex-  
pence beyond that requisite for their preser\ vation, sng coe  
for future service ; and to have the crews of those at New Orleans  
reduced to the number required for their navigation and rite  
  
I have thought also, that our citizens detached in quotas of militia,

might not improperly, be relieved from the state in which they were

Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
And of the Foufe of Representatives,  
ON this firfk occasion of meeting  
you, it affords me much fatis­  
taction to be able to communicate the  
commencement of a favoruble change  
in our foreign relations ; the critical  
state of which induced a feflion of  
Congress at this early period.  
In consequence of the provisions of  
the a&amp; interdi®ing commercial inter­  
course with Grear Britain andé’rance,  
our ministers at London and Paris  
were, without delay, infiru@ed, to let  
it be understood by the French and  
British governmeuts, that the author­  
ity vefled in the executive to renew  
commercial intercomfe with their  
refpeélive nations, would be exercised,  
by the case fpecified in that adt.  
, Soon after these inftru&amp;ions were  
dispatched, it was found that the Bri.  
tith government, anticipating, from  
carly proceedings of Congress at their  
last feflion, the state of our laws which  
has had the effe@ of placing the two  
belligerent powers on a footing of  
equal restrictions, and relying on the  
conciliatory disposition of the United  
States, had transmitted to their Lega­  
tion here, provisional infiru@ions not  
only to offer fatisfa&amp;ion for the at­  
tack on the frigate Chesapeake, and  
to make known the determination of  
his_Britannic majesty, to fend an en­  
voy extraordinary with powers to  
conclude a treaty on all points be­  
tween the two countries ; but, more­  
over, to {ignify his willingness, in tha  
mean time, to withdraw his orders in  
council in the persuasion that the inter­  
course with Great Britain, would be  
renewed on the part of the United  
States. : _  
These steps of the Britith govern­  
ment led to the correspondence and  
the proclamation now laid before you,  
by virtue of which, the commerce be­  
tween the two countries will be renew­  
able after the loth day of June next.  
Whillt 1 take pleasure in doing jus­  
tice to the councils of his Britannic  
majesty, which no longer adhering to  
the policy which made an abandon­  
ment by France of her decrees a pre­  
requisite to a revocation of the Britith  
orders, have fubflituted the amicable  
course which has issued thus happily ;  
I cannot do less than refer to the pro­  
posal heretofore made on the part of  
the United States embracing a like  
restoration of the suspended com­  
merce, as a proof of the {pirit of ac­  
commodation which has at no, time .  
been intermitted ; and to the refule  
which now &#x27;calls for our congratula­  
ticns, as corroborating the principles  
by which the public councils have  
been guided, during a period of the  
most trying embarrafiments. Sels  
- The discontinuance of the British  
orders, as they refpe@ the United  
States, having been thus arranged, a  
communication of the event has been  
forwarded in one of our public ves­  
sels, to our minister plenipotentiary at  
Paris, with inflruciops to avail him­  
f{elf of the important addition thereby  
made to the considerations which press  
on the justice of the French govern.  
ment, a revocation gfits\- decrees, or!  
such a modification ©of thew, as that  
they shall cease to yiolate the neutral  
commerce of the United States.  
The revision of our commercial  
laws, proper to adapt them to the ar.  
rangement which has taken place with  
Great Bﬂtam&amp;gihg&amp;fmxa%c  
the early attention of Congress. It  
will beimﬁ%aiméwf  
their joft and protidesticars, to make:  
such further alterations in the laws,  
  
aswin More efpetizliy T proteer Epd  
folter the several branches of Thiu­  
fa@ure, which have been recently in-  
Rituted, or extended by the laudable  
exertions of our citizens. s  
Under the existing afpe@ of our&amp;_af-.  
fairs, I have thought it not incon ilt­  
ent with a just precaution, to have the  
gun-boats, with the exception of those  
at N. Orleans, placed in 2 ﬁtual{ion  
incurring no expense beyond that re­  
quisite for their preservation, and con­  
ventency for future service ; and| to  
have the crews of those at New Qr­  
leans, reduced to the number required  
for their pavigation and fa‘ety. B  
I have thought, also, that our citt­  
zens detached in quotas of militia  
amounting to one hundred thousand,  
under the a&amp; of March, 18c8. might  
not improperly be relieved from ‘the  
state in which they were held for im­  
mediate service. A discharge of them  
has been accordingly diredted.  
The progress made :n raising and  
organizing the additional’ military  
force, for which provisions was made  
by the a&amp; of April, 18c8, together  
with the disposition of the troops will  
appear by a report which the secreta­  
ry of war is preparing, and which will  
be laid before you. .  
Of the aiditional frigates required  
by an a&amp; of the last feflion, to be fit­  
ted for a&amp;tual service. two are in read­  
iness, one geariy so ; and the feurth  
is expected to be ready in the month  
of July. A report which the Secre­  
tary of the navy is preparing on the  
fubj=ft, to be laid before congress,  
wiil thew at the fame time, the pro­  
gress made in cfficering and manning  
these thips. ~lt will (hew. also, the  
degree in which the provisions of the  
act relating to the other public 2rmed  
thips, have been carried into ex:icu­  
tion.  
  
Jt will rest with the judgment of  
Congress to decide how far the change  
in our external profpeéts may author­  
ife any modification of the laws, re­  
lating to the army and navy eftablith­  
ment.  
The works of defence for our sea­  
port/ towns and harbors, have pro­  
ceeded with as much a&amp;ivity as the  
season of the year and other circum­  
stances would admit. It is neceflury  
however, to state, that the 2pproprias  
ticns nitherto made being found to  
be deficiert, a further provision will  
claim the eatly conficderation of Con­  
gress, &#x27;  
The whole of the eight per cent  
flock remaining due by the United  
States, amounting to five millions  
thres bundred thousand Jollars, had  
been reimbursed on the l3fi day of  
the year 18c8. And on the firQ day  
of April lust, the sum in the treasury  
exceeded nine and a half millions of  
dollars., This toe=ther with the re.  
ceipts of the cunient year on account  
of former reverne bonds, will proba­  
bly be nearly, if not altogether fuffi­  
cient to defray the expentes of the  
year. But the fufperfion of exports,  
and the confcquent decrease of impor­  
tations dusing the lail twelve months,  
will necefl:rily cause a great diminu­  
tion in the receipts of the yezr 1810.  
After that year, fheuld our foreign  
relations be uncifturbed, rhe reverue  
will again be more than commensu­  
rate to all the expenditures.  
Aware of the inconveniences of a  
protradted feflion at the profent season  
of the year, 1 forbear to cali the at­  
tention of the legiflsture to any mat­  
ters not particularly urgent. It re­  
mains therefore only to sffure you of  
the fidelity and alacrity, with which  
1 fhail co-operate for the welfare and  
bappinefs of our ccuntry ; and to  
pray that it may experience a contin­

which it has been so signally favored.

, instructed to let t be wnderstoud by  
  
- aad British governments, that  
  
the authority vested in the executive, to  
com  
  
mercial intercourse with their  
respective nations, would be exercised in  
  
~ Soon after these instructions were dis-  
patched, st was found that the British gov-  
ernment, anticipating, from early proceed-  
ings of congress at their last session, the  
state of our la®@s, which has had the ef-  
fect of placing the two belligerent powers  
on a footing of equal restrictions, and re-  
lying on the conciliatory disposition of the  
United States, had transmitted to their le-  
gation here, provisional instructions, not  
only to-offer satisfaction for the attack on  
the frigate Chesapeake, and to make  
known the determination of his Britannic  
  
with powers to conclude a treaty on all  
points between the two countries; but  
moreover, to signify his willingness, in  
the mean time to withdraw his orders in  
} counci, im the persuasion that the inter-  
coursé with Great Britain would be renew-  
b edo the part of the United States.  
  
| «These steps of the British government  
  
mation now laid before you; by virtue of  
which, the commerce between the two  
| countries will be renewable after the 10th  
day of June next.  
  
Whilst I take pleasure in doing justice  
to the ceunsels of his Britannic Majesty,  
which no jonger adhering to the policy  
which made an abandonment by France,  
of her decrees, a pre-requisite to a revo-  
cation of the British orders, have substi-  
tuted the amicable course which has is-  
sued thus happily ; I cannot do Iess than  
refer to the proposal heretofose made on  
the part of the United States embracing  
a like restoration of the suspended com-  
merce, as a proof of the spirit of accom-  
modation which has at no time been ine  
termitted, and to the result which now  
calls for our congratulations, as corrobora-  
| ting the principles by which the public  
| counsels have been guided during a pesi-  
od of the most trying embarrassments.  
  
;  
  
™  
  
ders, as they respect the United &gt;tates,  
having been thus arranged, a communi-  
cation of the event has been forwarded, in  
one of our public. vessels, to our Minister  
Plenipotentiary at Paris; with instruc-  
tions to avail himself of the important ad-  
dition thereby made, to the considerations  
which press on the justice of the French  
government a revocation of its decrees or  
such a modification of them, as they shall  
cease to violate the neutral commerce of  
  
‘Fhe revision of our commercial Jaws,  
proper to adapt them to the arrangement  
which has taken place with Great Britain,  
will doubtless ehgage the early attention  
of Congress. It willbe worthy, at the  
same time, of their just and provident  
care, to make such further alterations in  
the laws, as will more especially protect  
and foster the several branches of manus  
facture which have been recently institu-  
ted or extended by the laudable exertions  
of our citizens.  
  
It will rest with the judgment of Con-  
gress to decide how far the change in our  
external prospects may author:ze any  
modifications of the laws relating to the  
army and navy establishments.  
  
The works of defence for our sea-port  
towns and harbors have proceeded with  
as much activity, as the season of the year  
and other circumstances would admit. ft  
| is necessary, however, to state, that the  
- appropriations hitherto-made being townd  
to be deficient, a further provision will  
claim the early consideration of Congress.  
  
The whole of the eight per .cent. stock  
remaining due by the U. States, amonnt-  
ing to five millions three hundred thov-  
sand dollars hed been reimbursed on the  
last day of the year 1808. And on the  
first day of April last, the sum in the  
H treasury exceeded nine and half millions  
fof dollars. This together with the re-  
} ceiptsof the current year, on account of.  
former revenue bonds, will probably be  
nearly, if not altogether sufficient to de-  
fray the expences of the year. But the  
  
quent decrease of impai tations during the  
last twelve months will necessarily cause a  
great diminution in the receipts of the  
year 1810. Afterthat year, should our  
| foreign relations be undisturbed, the reve-  
| nue will again be more than commensu-  
rate to all the expenditures.  
Under the existing aspect of our affairs,  
| I have thought it not inconsistent with a  
just precaution, to have the gun-boats  
with the exception of those at N. Orleans,  
placed in a situation, incurring no expence  
beyond that requisite for their preservation  
and conveniency for future service ; and  
to have the crews of those at New-Orleans  
reduced to the number required for their  
navigation and safety.  
  
1 have thought also, that our citizens  
detached in quetas of militia, amounting  
to one hundered thousand, under the act  
of Mareh 1808, might, net improperly, be  
relieved from the state in which they were  
held for immediate service. A discharge  
of them has been accordingly directed.  
  
&#x27; The progress made in raising and or-  
ganizing the additional military force, for  
which provision was mude by the act of  
April 1808, together with the disposition }

» Felloy Cirizens of the Senate, and  
| of the Hquse of Representatives.  
~ ON this first oceasion of meeting you, it  
aflfords me ﬁxu; satisfaction, to Le able to  
communicate the commencement of a fi­  
vourable change in our foreign relations ; the  
critical state of which induced a session of  
Congress at this period. -~ \
  
In consequence of the provisions of the act  
nterdicting the commertial intercourse with  
Great-Britain and France, our ministers at  
London and Paris were, wi,tl%ut delay, in­  
structed to let it be understood by the French  
and British governments, that the authority  
vested in the executive, to renew commer­  
cial intercourse with their respective nations,  
would be exercised in the case specified by  
that act.  
Soon after these ins;mtions were depatch-  
  
ed, it was found that the British government,  
an‘ipating, from&#x27; early proceedings of Con­  
gress at their last session, the state of our  
laws, which has had the effect of placing the  
two belligerent powers on a footing of equal  
restrictions, and relying on the conciliatory  
disposition of the United States, had trare.  
mitted to their legation here, provisionz) in­  
structions, not only to offer satisfaction for  
the attack on the frigate Chesapeake, and to  
make known the determination of his Britan­  
nick majesty, to send an envoy’ extraordinary  
with powers to conclude a treaty on allfdints  
between the two countriesd’ ; but moreoter, to  
signify his willingnessin the mean time to  
withdraw his orders in council, in the persua­  
sion that the intercourse. with Great-Britain  
would be renewed on the part of the United  
States. .  
  
The steps of the British government led  
to the correspondence and the proclamation  
now laid before you ; by virtue of which, the  
commerce between the two countries will be  
  
renewable after the tenth day of June next.  
Whilst Itake pleasure in doing justice to  
the counsels of his Britannick majesty, which,  
no longer adhering to the policy which made  
an abandonment by France, of her decrecs, a  
pre-requisite to a revocation of the British or­  
ders, have substituted the amicable course  
  
which has issued thus happily, I cannot do  
less than refer to the proposal heretofore  
made on the part of the United States, em-  
  
bracing &amp; like restoration of the suspended  
commerce, as a proof of the spirit of accom­  
modation which has at no time been intermit­  
ted, and to the result which now calls for our  
congratulations, as corroborating the princi­  
ples by which the publick councils have been  
guided during a period of the most trying em­  
barrassments,  
  
The discontinnance of the British orders as  
they respect the United States, having been  
thus arranged, a communication of the event  
has been forwarded, in one of our publick  
vessels, to our Minister Plenipotentiary at  
Paris ; with instructions to avail himself of  
the important addition thercby made, to the  
considerations which press on the justice of  
the Freneh government a revocation of its  
decrees or such a modification of them, as  
they shall cease to violate the neutral com­  
merce of the United States.  
  
&#x27;+ The revision of our commercial laws, pro­  
_per to adapt them to the arrangement which  
“has taken place with Great Britain, will  
doubtless engage the early attention of Cone  
gress. It will be worthy, at the same time,  
of their just and provident care, t&amp;6 make such  
further aiterations in the laws, as will more  
especially . protect and foster the several  
branches of manufacture which have been re­  
cently instituted or extended by the lauduable  
exertions of our citizens., °  
  
It will rest with the judgment of Congress  
to decide how far the change in our external  
prospects may anthorise any medifications of  
the laws relating to the army and navy estab­  
lishments. &#x27;  
  
‘The works of defence for our seaport towns  
and harbours have proceteded with as much  
activity, as the season ofthe year and other  
circumstances would admit. It is necessary,  
however, to state, that the appropriations hi­  
therto made being found to be deficient, a fur­  
ther provision will claim the early considera­  
tion of Congress. ‘  
The whole of the eight per cent. stock re­  
maining due by the U. States,amounting to five  
millions three hundred thousand dollars, had  
been reimbursed on the last day of the year  
1808. And on the first day of April last,  
the sum in the treasury exceeded nine and a  
half millions of dollars.~This, together with  
the receipts of the current year, on account  
of former revenue bonds, will probably be  
nearly, if not altogether sufficient to defray  
the expences of the year.—But the suspen-  
Sion of exports and the consequent decrease  
of impertations, during the last twelve months  
will necessarily cause a great diminution in  
the receipts of the year 1810. After that  
yeary, should our foreign relations be undis­  
turbed, the revenue will again be more than  
commensurate to all the expenditures.  
Under the existing aspect of cur affairs, I  
have thought it not inconsistent with _a just  
precaution, to have the gun-boats with the ex­  
ception of those at New-Orleans, placed in a  
situation, incyrring no expence beyond that  
requisite for their preservation, and conveni­  
ency for future service ; and to have the crews  
of those at New-Orleans reduced to the num­  
ber nqn’ for their navigation and safety.  
I have thought also, that our citizens de­  
tached in quotas of militia, amounting to one  
hundred thousand, under the act of March,  
1808, mir.ht not improperly, be relieved from  
the state in which they were held for imme­  
diate service. A discharge of them has been  
  
accordingly dirceted. :  
The progress made in raising and organiz­  
ing the additional -military force, for which  
provision was made by the act of April, 1808,  
together with the disposition of the troops,  
will appear by a report which the secretary  
  
of war is preporing, and which will be laid  
  
beforc you. 1  
Oi the additional frigates required. by an  
act of the last session, to, be fitted for actual  
service, two are in readiness, one nearly soy  
and the fourth is expected to be ready in the  
month of July. A report, which the z_cre­  
tary of the navy is preparing on the subject,  
to be laid before Congress, will show at the  
sampe time, the progress made in oﬁ&#x27;ncerr‘g&#x27;  
and manning these ships. It .mll show. alsb

Iff tttntf citizens of the Senate  
and tf the Ilotuse of Reprenentdtiytf.  
  
On this first occasion of me,i?s1g you, it  
affords me much satisfaction, totfe able lo

ule Change in,our loreign reiauons ; me crm­  
caf state of which induced a session of Coil-  
  
gress at this early period. - - -  
  
In consequence of the provisions of the act  
  
interdicting commercial intercourse withG  
  
Britain .and Frai.ce, our Minister at London  
  
arid Paris were, without delay, instructed to  
  
let it be uiulerstGod by the French and British  
  
governments, marine aiunoruy vestea in tne  
Executive, to renew commercial intercourse  
with their respective nations, would be exer  
  
cised in the case specified by that act.  
Soon after these instructions were dispatch­  
ed, it was found that the British government,  
anticipating, frojjt early pioteedings of Con­  
gress at their last sessionj the state of our  
laws, which has had the effect of placing  
the two belligerent powers on a footing of  
equal-restrictions, and relying cn ..the conci­  
liatory disposition of the United S i.tes, had  
  
transmitted to their legation here, provisional  
instn e lions, not only to offer satisfaction for  
the attack on the frigate Cljesbptake, and to  
make known the determination of his Britan­  
nic Majesty, to send an Envoy Extraordinary  
with poueis to conclude a treaty oil all points  
between the two countries; but,m6reover,  
to sigjtiify his willingness, in the meantime,  
to withdraw his Orders in Council, in the­  
persuasion that the intercpurse with Great  
Britain would be renewed on the part of th&#x27;e  
U. States. ,  
These steps of the British government led  
to the correspondence and thepclamation  
nowjaid before you ; by virtue of which&quot; the  
coiiiiiitice between the&quot; two countries will be  
  
that they shall cease to violate the neutral  
commerce of the United States. V

stituted or extended by the laudable exertioriau  
of our citizens. &#x27; If I  
Under the. existing. aspect of our affairs  
have thought it not Inconsistent witli a jusT  
precaution, to have the gur boats, with lhi

a situation&quot;, incurring no expence beyoj.d that &#x27;

tached in quotas of militia, amounting to  
one hundred thousand, under the act of March  
1808, might, not improperly, be relieved  
from the state in which they welre held for  
immediate service. A discharge &quot;ot them  
has been accordingly directed.  
The progress made in raising and organis­

It will rest with the judgment of Congress  
to decide how far the cange in our external .  
prospects may authorize any modifications of  
ihe laws relating to the army and navy esta­  
blishments. .  
The&#x27; works of defence for our .seaport towns  
and harbours have mocttded with as much  
activity, as the season of the year an J Other  
circumstances would admit. It is necessary  
however to state, that the appropriations  
hitherto made being found to be deficient, a  
further provision will claim the early corisLde­  
. ration .of Congress. &#x27; &#x27;  
&#x27;I he whole ct the eight per cent stock re­  
mainig&#x27;ue bv-the United Slates, amounting  
to five millions three hundred thousand dol­  
lars, had been reimbursed on the last day of  
the year 1808. And on the first day of April  
lasttnthe sum in the Treasury .exceeded, nine  
-aha&#x27;a half millions of dollars. This, together  
with the receipts of the current year on ac-,  
count of former rerenue bonds, will probably  
be nearly, if not altogether sufr,iet:t to de;  
fray the exptnees of the year, liiit the sus  
  
pension of exports and the consequent de­  
crease of importations, during the last twelve  
months, will necessarily cause a great diittw  
nution in the receipts of ihe year 180.  
After that year, should our foreign ! Velaiins  
be undisturbed, the revenue will again bo  
moreithan commensurate to all the cxperidi  
tures. - - &#x27; , .. l-&quot;&quot; &#x27;  
Aware of thcinconveniences of a protract­  
ed session, at the present season of the veir  
I forbear to call the attention of the Legislature  
to any matters. not particularly&quot; urgent. Iti  
mains the. efore only to assure you of Tlie  
fidelity and alacrity witli which 1 shall co­

Fellow- Citizenj of the Senate, and  
oj the Hou/e of ReprefentativrJ,  
ON this firft occafton of meet­  
ing you, it affords me much fatisfac­  
t&#x27;Oii, to be able to communicate the  
commencement of a favorable change  
in our foreign relations ; the critical  
ltate of which induced a feflion of  
Congrefs at this early period.  
In confluence of the proviiions  
of the aft interdicting commercial  
intercourfe with Great Britain and  
1 ranee, our minifters at London and  
Paris were without delay, inftiufted  
to let it be timlerftbod, by the French  
and Britiih governments, that the  
authority vetted in the Executive, to  
renew commercial intercourfe with  
theirrefpeftive nations,would be txer­  
ctfed in the cafe fpecitied by that aft  
boon after thele inftruftions were  
iblpatched, it was found that the  
Britiih government, anticipating,  
fro n early proceedings of Congrels  
at their lalt ltflion, the- ftate of our  
laws, which has haJ the effcCt of  
placing the two belligerent powers  
on a fooling of equal reftridtions,  
l  
  
and relying on the conciliatory dif­  
pofition of the United States, had  
tranftnitted to their legation here,  
provifional inftruftions, not only to  
offer fatisfaflion for the attack on  
the frigate Chcfapeake, and to make  
known the determination of his Bri­  
tanic Majefty, to fend an envoy ex­  
traordinary with powers to conclude  
a treaty on all points between the j  
two countries j but moreover to fig- I  
nify his willingnefs, in the mean time !  
to withdraw hit Orders in Council, !  
in the purfuafion that the intercourfe  
with Great-Britain would be renew­  
ed on the part of the United States.  
Thefe fteps of the Britifh govern­  
ment led to the corrdpondence and  
the proclamation now laid before  
you ; by virtue of which, the com­  
merce between the two countries  
will be renewable after the tenth day  
of June next.  
Whilft I take pleafure in doing  
juftice to the councils of his Britannic  
majefty, which no longer adhering to  
the policy which made an abandon­  
ment by France of her decrees, a  
prerequifite to a revocation of the

the rcfult which now calls for our  
congratulations, as corroborating the  
principles by which the public coun­  
cils have been guided during the pe­  
riod of the mod trying embarrass­  
ments.  
The difcontinuance of the Britifh  
orders as they refpeft the United  
States, having been thus arranged, a  
communication of the event has been  
forwarded, in one of our public ves­  
fels, to our Minifter Plenipotentiary  
at Paric, with inftruAions to avail  
himfelf of the important addition  
thereby made, to the confident ions  
which prefs on the juftice of the  
French government a revocation of its  
decrees, or fuch a modification of  
them, as that they (hall ceafe to vio­  
late the neutral commerce of the Uni­  
ted States.  
  
l he revmon of our commercial  
laws, proper to adopt them to the  
arrangement which has taken place  
with Great Britain, will doubtlefs  
engage the early attention of Con­  
gress. It will be worthy at the fame  
time, of their juft and provided care,  
to make fuch further alterations in  
laws, as will more efpecially proteft  
and toiler the feveral brances of man­  
ufacture which have been recently  
inftituted or extended by the lauda­  
ble exertions of our citizens.  
Under the exifting afpeft of our  
afixirs, I have thought it not incon­  
ft ant, with a juft precaution, to have  
the gun boats with the exception of  
thole at New-Orleans, placed in a  
lituation, incurring no expence be­  
yond that requifite for their prefer­  
vation and conveniency for future  
fcrvice ; and to have the crews of  
thofe at New-Orleans reduced to the  
number required for their navigation  
and fafety.  
I have thought alfo, that our citi­  
zens, detached in quotas of militia,  
amounting to one hundred thoufand,  
under the aft of March, 1808, might  
not improperly be relieved from the  
ftate in which they were held for im­  
mediate fcrvice. A difeharge of  
them ha? been accordingly directed.  
The progrefs made in railing and  
orgauizing the additionl military  
force, for whichjprovifion was made  
by the aft of April, 1808, together  
with the difpolition of the troops, will  
appear by a report which the fecreta­  
ty of war is preparing, and which will  
be laid before youi  
Of the additional frigates required  
by an aft of the laft feflion, to be fit­  
ted foraftual fcrvice, two are in rea­  
dinefs, one nearly fo ; and the fourth  
is expefted to be ready in the month  
of July. A report which the fecre­  
tary of the navy is preparing on the  
fubject, to be laid before Congrefs,  
*  
  
will (hew at the fame time, the pro­  
grefs made in officering and manning  
thefc ffiips. It will (hew alfo, the de­  
gree in which the provifions of the  
adl relating to the other public armed  
Ihips, have been carried into execu­  
tion.  
It will reft with the judgment of  
Congrefs todecide how far the change  
in our external profpedls may au­  
thorize any modification of the laws,  
relating to the army and navy eftab­  
lifhments.  
The works of defence for our fea­  
port towns and harbors, have pro­  
ceeded with as much activity, as the  
feafon of the year and other circum­  
ftances would admit. It is necefiary,  
however, to ftate, that the appropri­  
ations hitherto made being found to  
be deficient, a further provifion will  
claim the early confederation of Con­  
&#x27;s .me whole of the eight per cent.  
ft£tk remaining due by the United  
States, amounting to five millions  
three tmndred thoufand dollars, had  
been reihaburf&#x27;cd on the laft day of  
the year 18%8. And on the firft day  
of April laft,&#x27;•the fum in the treafury  
exceeded nine and a half millions of  
dollars. This together with the re­  
ceipts of the current year on account  
of former revenue bonds, will proba­

It will reft with the judgment of Congrefs,  
to decide how far the change in our exter-  
nal profpefts may authorize any modificati-  
ons of the laws relating to the army and na-  
ry eftabli(hments.  
  
The works of defence for our seaport towns and  
harbors liavc proceeded with as much activity, as  
the season of tlie year, and other circumstances  
would admit. It is necessary however to state,  
that the aiipropriations hitherto made being found  
to be deficient, a further provision will claim the  
early consderation of Congress.  
  
i&#x27;lic whole of the eight nJkce afcs tock remain-  
ingduc by the United Stal^^nBlPliing to five  
m illions, three hundred tl^Uac* dollars, had  
been reimbursed on the last day of the year 1808.  
And on the first day of April last, the sum in the  
Treasury exceeded nine and a half millions of  
dollars. This together with the receipts of the  
current year on account of former revenue bonds  
will probably be nearh&#x27;, if not altogether sufficient  
to defray the cxpcnces of the year. But the sus-  
pension of expons and the con.sequenl decrease of  
importations during tile last twelve montlia, will  
necessarily cause a great diminution in the receipts  
of the year 1810. After that year should our  
foreign relations be undisturbed, the revenue will  
again be more than cummensui-ate to ail the ex-  
penditures.  
  
Aware of tbe ineonveniencies of a protracted  
scassion at the present se.asoii of the year, I for-  
bear to call the attention of the J.cgislalure to any

bably be nearly, if not altogether, sufiicient to defray the ex«  
penees of the year. but the suspension of the exports and the  
consequent decrease of unportations, during the last 12 months,  
will necesspyily cause a great diminution in the receipts of the

the United States. —These steps of the  
British Government led to the corres-  
pondence and the proclamation now laid  
before you ; by virtue of which, the com-  
merce between the two countries will be  
renewable after the 10th day of June next.  
—Whilst I take pleasure in doing justice  
to the counsels of his Britannic Majesty,  
which, no longer adhering to the- policy  
which made an abandonment by France,  
of her Decrees, a pre-requisite to a revoca-  
tion of the British Orders, have substituted  
the amicable course which has issued thus  
happily ; I cannot do less than refer to  
the proposal heretofore made on the part  
of the United States, embracing a like re-  
storation of the suspended commerce, asa  
proof of the spirit of accommodation which  
has at no time been intermitted, and to  
the result which now calls for our congra-  
tulations as corroborating the principles  
by which the public councils have been  
guided during a period of the most trying  
embarrassments.—The discontinuance of  
the British Orders as they respect the  
United States, having been thus arranged,  
a communication of the event has been for-  
warded, in one of our public vessels, to our  
Minister Plenipotentiary at Paris, with in-  
structions to avail himself of the important  
addition thereby made, to the considera-  
tions which press on the justice of the  
French Government a revocation of its  
Decrees, or such a modification of them,  
as they shall cease to violate the neutral  
commerce of the United States. —The re-  
vision of eur commercial laws, proper to  
adapt them to the arrangement which has  
taken place with Great britain, will doubt-  
less engage the early attention of Congress.

their just and provident care,  
  
further alterations in the laws, as wil! |  
  
more especially protect and foster the  
several branches of manufacture which  
have been recently instituted or extended  
by the laudable exe: tions of our citizens.—  
  
It will rest with the judgment of Congress |  
  
to decide how far the change in our ex-  
ternal prospects may authorise any modi-  
fications of the laws relating to the army  
and navy establishments.—The works of  
defence for our sea-port towns and har-  
bours have proceeded with as much acti-  
vity as the season of the year and other  
circumstances would admit. It is neces-  
sary, however, to state, that the appro-  
priations hitherto made being found to be  
deficient, a farther provision wiil claim  
the early consideration of Congress.—The  
whole of the eight per cent. stock remain-  
ing due by the United States, amounting  
to 5,400,000 dollars, had been reimbursed  
on the last day of the vear 1808. And on  
the Ist day of April last, the sum in the  
‘Treasury exceeded nine and a half mil-  
lions of dollars. This, together with the  
receipts of the current year, on account  
of former Revenue bonds, will probably  
be nearly, if not altogether sufficient, to  
delray the expences of the year. But the  
suspension of exports and the consequent  
decrease of importations, during the last  
twelve months, will necessarily cause a  
great diminution in the receipts of the  
year 1810, After that year, should our  
foreign relations be undisturbed, the reve-  
nue will again be more than commensu-  
rate to all the expendityres.—Under the  
existing aspect of our affairs, I have thought  
it not inconsistent with a just precaution,  
to have the gun-boats, with the exception  
of those at New Orleans, placed in a situ-  
ation incurring no expence beyond that  
requisite for their preservation, and con-  
veniency for future service; and to have  
the crews of those at New Orleans reduced  
to the number required for their naviga-  
tion and safety.—1 have thought also, that  
our citizens detached in quotas of militia,  
amounting to 100,000, under the Act of  
March 1808, might not improperly be re-  
lieved from the state in which they were  
held for immediate service. A discharge  
of them has been accordingly directed.—  
The progress made in raising and organiz-  
ing the additional military force, for which  
  
provision was made by the Act of April, | most fervent love and zeal for our native  
  
i808, together with the disposition of the  
troops, will ar by a Report which the
