My last to you was on the 20th instant. Since that, I have the pleasure to inform you, that General Dickinson, with about 400 Militia, has defeated a foraging Party of the Enemy of an equal number, and has taken forty Waggons and upwards of an hundred Horses, most of them of the English draft Breed, and a number of Sheep and Cattle which they had collected.  
The Enemy retreated with so much precipitation, that General Dickinson had only an opportunity of making nine prisoners, they were observed to carry off a good many dead and wounded in light Waggons.  
This Action happened near Somerset Court House on Millstone  
  
River. Genl Dickinsons behaviour reflects the highest honour upon him, for tho’ his Troops were all raw, he lead them thro’ the River, middle deep, and gave the Enemy so severe a charge, that, altho’ supported by three feild peices, they gave way and left their Convoy.

Sir :—My last to you was on the 20th. Since then I have the pleasure to inform you that  
General Dickinson, with 400 men, has defeated a foraging party of the enemy of an equal number,  
and has taken forty waggons and over one hundred horses, mostly of the English draught breed, and  
a number of sheep and cattle which they had collected.  
  
The enemy retreated with so much precipitation that General Dickinson had only an opportun-  
ity of making nine of them prisoners. They were observed to carry off a good many dead and  
wounded, in light waggons. This action happened near Somerset Court House, on the Millstone  
river. General Dickinson’s behavior reflects the highest credit on him, for, though his troops were  
all raw, he led them through the river middle deep, under a severe fire, and gave the enemy so se-  
vere a charge, that, although they were supported by three field pieces, they gave way—left their  
convoy—and fled.
