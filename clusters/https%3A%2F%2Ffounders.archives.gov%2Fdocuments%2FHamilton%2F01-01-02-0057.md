s of his creatures; and, still, to assert, that man, in a state of nature, may be considered as perfectly free from all restraints of law and government, appear to a common understanding, altogether irreconcileable.  
Good and wise men, in all ages, have embraced a very dissimilar theory. They have supposed, that the deity, from the relations, we stand in, to himself and to each other, has constituted an eternal and immutable law, which is, indispensibly, obligatory upon all mankind, prior to any human institution whatever.  
This is what is called the law of nature, “which, being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is, of course, superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times. No human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid, derive all their authority, mediately, or immediately, from this original.” Blackstone.  
Upon this law, depend the natural rights of mankind, the supreme being gave existence to man, together with the means of preserving and beatifying that existence. He endowed him with rational faculties, by the help of which, to discern and pursue such things, as were consistent with his duty and

To usurp dominion over a people, in their own despite, or to grasp at a more extensive power than they are willing to entrust, is to violate that law of nature, which gives every man a right to his personal liberty; and can, therefore, confer no obligation to obedience.  
“The principal aim of society is to protect individuals, in the enjoyment of those absolute rights, which were vested in them by the immutable laws of nature; but which could not be preserved, in peace, without that mutual assistance, and intercourse, which is gained by the institution of friendly and social communities. Hence it follows, that the first and primary end of human laws, is to maintain and regulate these absolute rights of individuals.” Blackstone.

, “when I assert, that since Americans have not, by any act of theirs, impowered the British parliament to make laws for them, it follows they can have no just authority to do it, I advance a position subversive of that dependence, which all colonies must, from their very nature, have on the mother country.” The premises from which I drew this conclusion, are indisputable. You have not detected any fallacy in them; but endeavor to overthrow them by deducing a false and imaginary consequence. My principles admit the only dependence which can subsist, consistent with any idea of civil liberty, or with the future welfare of the British empire, as will appear hereafter.

 Hayward, with abstinence, Atterbury; cautiously, tenderly. Substitute frugally or not lavishly, for sparingly, and you must blush at your own conceit. “Kill your sheep frugally or not lavishly,” Where is the impropriety of this?  
  
As soon as a colony becomes independent on the parent state, it ceases to be any longer a colony, just as when you kill a sheep, you cease to spare him.”  
In what sense, the dependance of the colonies on the mother country, has been acknowledged, will appear from those circumstances of their political history, which I shall, by and by, recite. The term colony signifies nothing more, than a body of people drawn from the mother country, to inhabit some distant place, or the country it self so inhabited. As to the degrees and modifications of that subordination, which is due to the parent state, these must depend upon other things, besides the mere act of emigration, to inhabit or settle a distant country. These must be ascertained, by the spirit of the constitution of the mother country, by the compacts for the purpose of colonizing, and, more especially, by the law of nature, and that supreme law of every society—its own happiness.

He it is that has defended us from our enemies, and to him alone, we are obliged to render allegiance and submission.  
The law of nature and the British constitution both confine allegiance to the person of the King; and found it upon the principle of protection. We may see the subject discussed at large in the case of Calvin: The definition given of it by the learned Coke, is this, “Legiance is the mutual bond and obligation between the King and his subjects, whereby subjects are called his liege subjects, because they are bound to obey and serve him; and he is called their liege lord, because he is bound to maintain and defend them.” Hence it is evident, that while we enjoy the protection of the King, it is incumbent upon us to obey and serve him, without the interposition of parliam

) have established it as a maxim, that, in contriving any system of government, and fixing the several checks and controuls of the constitution, every man ought to be supposed a knave; and to have no other end in all his actions, but private interest. By this interest, we must govern him, and by means of it, make him co-operate to public good, notwithstanding his insatiable avarice and ambition. Without this, we shall in vain boast of the advantages of any constitution, and shall find in the end, that we have no security for our liberties and possessions, except the good will of our rulers; that is, we should have no security at all.  
“It is therefore a just political maxim, that every man must be supposed a knave. Though, at the same time, it appears somewhat strange, that a maxim should be true in politics, which is false in fact. But to satisfy us on this head, we may consider, that men are generally more honest in a private than in a public capacity; and will go greater lengths to serve a party, than when their own private interest is alone concerned. Honour is a great check upon mankind. But, where a considerable body of men act together, this check is in a great measure removed; since a man is sure to be approved by his own party, for what promotes the common interest, and he soon learns to despise the clamours of adversaries. To this we may add that every court, or senate is determined by the greater number of voices; so that if self-interest influences only the majority, (as it will always do) the whole senate follows the allurements of this separate interest, and acts as if it contained not one member, who had any regard to public interest and liberty.” What additional force do these observations acquire, when applied to the dominion of one commun

ood government may be preserved, every where. It is in vain to assert, that two or more distinct legislatures cannot exist in the same state. If, by the same state, be meant the same individual community, it is true. Thus, for instance, there cannot be two supreme legislatures in Great-Britain, or two in NewYork. But, if, by the same state, be understood a number of individual societies, or bodies politic, united under one common head, then, I maintain, that there may be one distinct compleat legislature in each: Thus there may be one in Great-Britain, another in Ireland, and another in New-York, and still these several parts may form but one state. In order to this, there must indeed be some connecting, pervading principle; but this is found in the person and prerogative of the King. He it is that conjoins all these individual societies, into one great body politic. He it is, that is to preserve their mutual connexion and dependence, and make them all co-operate to one common end the general good. His power is equal to the purpose, and his interest binds him to the due prosecution of it.  
Those, who aver, that the independency of America on the British Parliament implies two Sovereign authorities in the same state, deceive themselves or wish to deceive others in two ways; by confounding the idea of the same state with that of the same individual society, and by losing sight of that share which the King has in the sovereignty, both of Great-Britain and America. Perhaps, indeed, it may with propriety be said, that the King is the only Sovereign of the empire. The part which the people have in the legislature, may more justly be considered as a limitation of the Sovereign authority, to prevent its being exercised in an oppressive and despotic manner: Monarchy is universally allowed to predominate in the constitution. In this view, there is not the least absurdity in the supposition that Americans have a right to a limitation similar to that of the people of Great-Britain. At any rate, there can never be said to be two sovereign powers, in the same state; while one common king is acknowledged, by every member of it.  
Let us, for a moment, imagine the legislature of New-York independent on that of Great-Britain, where would be the mighty inconvenience! How would government be frustrated, or obstructed, by this means? In what manner, would they interfere with each other? In none that I can perceive.

You are mistaken, when you confine arbitrary government to a monarchy. It is not the supreme power being placed in one, instead of many, that discriminates an arbitrary from a free government. When any people are ruled by laws, in framing which, they have no part, that are to bind them, to all intents and purposes, without, in the same manner, binding the legislators themselves, they are in the strictest sense slaves, and the government with respect to them, is despotic. Great-Britain is itself a free country; but it is only so because its inhabitants have a share in the legislature: If they were once divested of that, they would cease to be free. So that, if its jurisdiction be extended over other countries that have no actual share in its legislature, it becomes arbitary to them; because they are destitute of those checks and controuls which constitute that moral security which is the very essence of civil liberty.  
I will go farther, and assert, that the authority of the British Parliament over America, would, in all probability, be a more intolerable and excessive species of despotism than an absolute monarchy.

It was not ’till the latter period of their republic, that the privileges of Roman citizens, among which, that of voting in Assemblies of the people, at Rome, was a principal one, were extended to the inhabitants of Italy. All the laws of the empire were enacted at Rome. Neither their colonies, nor conquered countries had any thing to do with legislation.”  
The fundamental source of all your errors, sophisms and false reasonings is a total ignorance of the natural rights of mankind. Were you once to become acquainted with these, you could never entertain a thought, that all men are not, by nature, entitled to a parity of privileges.

“The position, (you say) that we are bound by no laws, but those, to which we have assented, either by ourselves, or by our representatives, is a novel position, unsupported by any authoritative record of the British constitution, ancient or modern. It is republican, in its very nature; and tends to the utter subversion of the English monarchy.  
“This position has arisen from an artful change of terms. To say, that an Englishman is not bound by any laws, but those to which the representatives of the nation have given their consent, is to say what is true. But to say, that an Englishman is bound by no laws but those to which he hath consented, in person, or by his representative, is saying what never was true, and never can be true. A great part of the people have no vote in the choice of representatives, and, therefore, are governed by laws, to which, they never consented, either by themselves, or by their representatives.”

art of the nation) who possesses a freehold, to the value of forty shillings per annum, has a right to a share in the legislature, which he exercises, by giving his vote in the election of some person, he approves of, as his representative.  
“The true reason (says Blackstone) of requiring any qualification, with regard to property in voters, is to exclude such persons, as are in so mean a situation, that they are esteemed to have no will of their own. If these persons had votes, they would be tempted to dispose of them, under some undue influence, or other. This would give a great, an artful, or a wealthy man, a larger share in elections, than is consistent with general liberty. If it were probable, that every man would give his vote, freely, and without influence of any kind, then, upon the true theory and genuine principles of Liberty, every member of the community, however poor, should have a vote, in electing those delegates, to whose charge is committed the disposal of his property, his liberty and life. But since that can hardly be expected, in persons of indigent fortunes, or such as are under the immediate dominion of others, all popular states have been obliged to establish certain qualifications, whereby, some who are suspected to have no will of their own, are excluded from voting; in order, to set other individuals, whose wills may be supposed independent, more thoroughly upon a level with each other.”  
Hence it appears, that such “of the people as have no vote in the choice of representatives, and therefore, are govern’d, by laws, to which they have not consented, either by themselves or by their representatives, are only those persons, who are in so mean a situation, that they are esteemed to have no will of their own.” Every free agent, every free man, possessing a freehold of forty shillings per annum, i

The following extract will shew the nature of it: “We do hereby ordain and grant, that the said treasurer, and company of adventurers and planters, aforesaid, shall and may, once every week, and oftener, at their pleasure, hold and keep a court or assembly, for the better order and government of the said plantation; and that any five persons of our council, for the time being, of which company the treasurer, or his deputy to be always one, and the number of fifteen persons, at the least, of the generality of the said company assembled together, in such manner, as hath been heretofore used and accustomed, shall be reputed to be, and shall be a sufficient court, for the handling, ordering and dispatching of all such casual and particular occurrences, as shall, from time to time happen, touching and concerning the said plantation.

There the season compelled them to remain, and there they have prosecuted their settlements.  
They looked upon themselves as having reverted to a state of nature; but being willing still to enjoy the protection of their former sovereign, they executed the following instrument.  
“In the name of God, Amen! We, whose names are under-written, the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign Lord King James, of Great-Britain, &amp;c. King, defender of the faith, &amp;c, having undertaken, for the glory of God, and the advancement of the Christian faith, and the honour of our King, and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern part of Virginia, do by these presents, mutually, in the presence of God, and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic, for our better ordering and preservation and furtherance of the ends aforesaid, and by virtue hereof, to enact, constitute, and frame such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions and officers, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the colony; unto which, we promise all due submission and obedience.”  
In witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our names, at Cape Cod, November 11th, 1620.

King James, soon after, erected a Council at Plymouth, in the county of Devon, “for the planting, ruling, ordering and governing of New-England, in America;” and granted to “them, their successors and assigns, all that part of America, lying and being in breadth from 40 deg. of north latitude from the equinoctial line to the 48th degree of the said northerly latitude, inclusively, and in length of, and within all the breadth aforesaid, throughout all the main land, from sea to sea; together with all the firm lands, soils, grounds, havens, ports, rivers, waters, fishings, mines, minerals, precious stones, quarries, and all and singular other commodities, jurisdictions, royalties, privileges, franchises, and preheminences, both within the said tract of land, upon the main, and also within the islands and seas adjacent.

y the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations) are charter governments, where almost the whole power of the crown is delegated to the people, who make annual election of their Assembly, their Councils and their Governors, likewise to the majority of which Assemblies, Councils and Governors, respectively, being collective bodies, the power of making laws is granted; and, as their charters are worded, they can, and do make laws, even without the Governor’s assent, no negative voice being reserved to them, as Governors in said charters. These colonies have the power of making laws, for their better government and support; and are not under any obligation, by their respective constitutions, to return authentic copies of their laws to the crown, for approbation and disallowance; or to give any account of their proceedings; nor are their laws repealable, by the crown; but the validity of them depends upon their not being contrary, but, as near as may be, agreeable to the laws of England.”  
As to the expression, as other our liege people of this our realm of England, or any other corporation or body politic within the same, if any stress be laid upon the particle other, it will imply not only, that the colonies were simple matters of corporation; but that the inhabitants of them were considered as being within the realm of England. But this cannot be admitted as true, without contradicting other clauses of the same charters. Thus, in the preamble to that of Rhode-Island, it is said, that the first planters “did, by the consent of our royal progenitors, transport themselves out of this kingdom of England into America.” And in each of the charters, the King stipulates, that all the children born in America, shall enjoy “all the liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects, within any of his dominions, as if they and every of them were born within the realm of England.”  
The vague and improper manner, in which this particle is used, in many other places of the several charters, will not allow it the least weight in the present instance. In the 11th article of the third Virginia charter, there is this expression: “All such, and so many of our loving subjects, or any other strangers that will, &amp;c.” The same rule of inference, that makes Rhode-Island and Connecticut simple corporations, will also transform th

It is true, that New-York has no Charter.

The nations of Turkey, Russia, France, Spain, and all other despostic kingdoms, in the world, have an inherent right, when ever they please, to shake off the yoke of servitude, (though sanctified by the immemorial usage of their ancestors;) and to model their government, upon the principles of civil liberty.

“If you once admit, (says he) that Great-Britain may lay duties upon her exportations to us, for the purpose of levying money on us only she will then have nothing to do, but to lay duties on the articles which she prohibits us to manufacture; and the tragedy of American liberty is finished. We have been prohibited from procuring manufactures, in all cases, any where but from Great-Britain (excepting linens, which we are permited to import, directly from Ireland). We have been prohibited, in some cases, from manufacturing, for ourselves, and may be prohibited, in others. We are, therefore, exactly in the situation of a city besieged, which is surrounded by the besiegers, in every part, but one. If that is closed up, no step can be taken, but to surrender at discretion. If Great-Britain can order us to come to her, for the necessaries we want, and can order us to pay what taxes she pleases, before we take them away, or when we land them here, we are as abject slaves as France and Poland can shew in wooden shoes, and with uncombed hair.

“Perhaps the nature of the necessities of dependent states, caused by the policy of a governing one, for her own benefit, may be elucidated, by a fact, mentioned in history. When the Carthaginians were possessed of the island of Sardinia, they made a decree, that the Sardinians should not raise corn, nor get it any other way, than from the Carthaginians. Then, by imposing any duties they would upon it, they drained from the miserable Sardinians any sums they pleased; and, whenever that miserable and oppressed people made the least movement to assert their liberty, their tyrants starved them to death, or submission.

peaking of this matter, you confine your views to the single small province of New-York. You say, “We sow already as much flax, as we can conveniently manage. Besides, it requires a rich free soil; nor will the same ground in this country produce flax a second time, till after an interval of five or six years. If the measures of the Congress should be carried into full effect, I confess we may in a year or two, want a large quantity of hemp, for the executioner. But I fear, we must import it. It exhausts the soil too much to be cultivated, in the old settled parts of the province.”

“Be it enacted, by the Governor, Council and Representatives, met in General Assembly, and it is hereby enacted and declared, by the authority of the same, that the supreme legislative power and authority, under their Majesty’s William and Mary, King and Queen of England, &amp;c. shall, for ever, be and reside, in a Governor in chief, and Council appointed, by their Majesties, their heirs and successors, and the people, by their representatives, met and convened, in General Assembly.

POLTITICAIL Writers have eſtabliſh&#x27;d it as  
  
a Maxim, That in contriving any Syſtem of  
Government, and fixing the ſeveral Checks  
and Controuls of the Conſtitution, every Man  
ought to be ſuppos&#x27;d a Krave, and to have  
no other End, in all his Actions, but private  
Intereſt. By this Intereſt we muſt govern  
him, and by Means of it, make him co-ope-  
rate to public-Good, notwithſtanding his in-  
fatiable Avarice and Ambition. Without this,  
fay they, we ſhall in vain boaſt of the Advan-  
tages of any Conſtitution, and ſhall find, in  
the End, that we have no Security for our Li-  
berties or Poſſeſſions, except the Good-will

—  
  
INDEPENDENCY of PaRTIIAuENr. Bf  
  
of our Rulers; that is, we ſball have no Secu -  
rity at all. |

every Man muſs be ſuppoſed a Knave : Tho&#x27;  
at the ſame Time, I muſt own it appears ſome-  
what ſtrange, that a Maxim ſhould be true in  
Politics, which is falſe in Fact. But to ſatisfy  
us on this Head, we may conſider, that Men

We cannot help quoting the following paffage with refpe&amp;  
to the qualifications of eléctors; ‘ The true reafon, fays Mr.  
Blackftone, of requiring any qualification with regard to pro-  
perty, in veters, is to exclude fuch perfons as are in fo mean a  
fituations that they are efteemed to have‘no will of their-own.  
If thefe perfons had votes, they would be tempted to difpofe  
of them under fome undue influence or other. This would  
give a great, an artful, and a wealthy oian, a larger fhare in  
elections, than is confiftent with general liberty. If it were  
probable that every mah would give his vote freely; and with-  
out influence of any kind, then, upon the true theory and ge-  
nuine principles of liberty, every member of the community,  
however poor, would have a vote in eleéting thofe delegates,  
to whofe charge is committed the difpofal of his property, his  
liberty, and his life. But, fince that can hardly be expected  
in perfons of indigent fortunes, or fuch as are under the im-  
mediate dominion of others, all popular {tates have been obli-  
ged to eftablifh certain qualifications, whereby fome, who are  
fufpected to have no will of their own, are excluded from vo-  
tiug, in order to fet other individuals, whofe wills may be fup-

exportation, which is as great an emolument to the Mo-

Here then let my countrymen rouse themselves, ‘  
and behold the inevitable ruin hanging over their |  
heads, if they once admit that Great-Britain may  
lay dutics, on her exportations to us, for the pur­  
pose of levying money on us only. She then will have  
nothing to do but to lay those duties on the arti­  
cles which she prohibits us to manufaure; and  
the tragedy of American liberty is finithed. We  
have been prohibited frorh procuring manufactures, i  
in all cases, any where but from Great-Britain  
( excepting liriens which we are permitted to im­  
port dire&amp;ly from freland ) : &#x27;We have been pro­  
hibited, in some cases, from manufaéturing for  
ousfelves ; we are therefore exaltly in the situation  
of a city befieged,which is surrounded by the works  
of the besiegers in every part but one. If that is  
closed up, no step can be taken but to surrender at  
discretion. If Great- Baitain can order us to come |  
to her for neceflari¢s we want, and can order us  
to pay what taxes she pleases, before we take them  
away, or when we have them here; we are as ab­  
je€t slaves as France and Poland can thew in woo­  
den shoes; and with uncombed hair. |  
Perhaps the nature of the neceflities of the de­  
pendant states, caused by the policy of 2 governing  
one, for her own benefit, ray be elucidated by a  
faét mentionedin history. When the Carthagenians  
were pollefled of the island of Sardinia, they made  
a decree, that the Sardinians should not get corn  
any other way than from the Carthaginians. Then  
by imposing any duties they would, they drained  
from the miserable Sardinians any sums they pleas­  
ed ; and whenever that opprefled people made  
the least movement to assert their liberty, their  
tyrants {tarved thein to death or submission. This  
may be called the most perfe@ kind of political

heads, if they once admit that Great-Britain may  
lay dutics, on her exportations to us, for the pur- |  
pose of levying money on us only. She then will have 4‘  
nothing to do but to lay those duties on the arti- |  
cles which she prohibits us to manufa®ure, and |  
the tragedy of American liberty is finithed. We  
have been prohibited frorh procuring manufaltures,  
in all cases, any whiere but from Great- Britain  
( excepting lients which we are permitted to im­  
port dire&amp;ly from Ireland ) : We have been pro­  
hibited, in some cases, from manufaéturing for  
ourselves ; we are therefore exaétly in the situation  
of a city befieged,which is surrounded by the works  
of the besiegers in every part but one. If that is  
closed up, no step can be taken but to surrender at  
discretion, If Great- Baitain cah order us to come |  
to her for neceflaries we want, and ean order us  
to pay what taxes she pleases, before we take them  
away, or when we have them here; we are as ab­  
je€t slaves as France and Poland can thew in woo­  
den shoes; and with uncombed hair. |  
Perhaps the nature of the neceflities of the de­  
pendant states, catfed by the policy of a governing  
one, for her own benefit, may be elucidated by a  
fact mentioned in history. When the Carthagenians  
were pollefled of the island of Sardinia, they made  
a decree, that the Sardinians should not get corn  
any other way than from the Carthaginians. Then  
by imposing any duties they would, they drained  
from the miserable Sardinians any sums they pleas­  
ed 5 and whenever that opprefled people ‘made  
the least movement to assert their liberty, their  
tyrants starved them todeath or submission. This  
may be called the most perfe&amp; kind of political  
neceflity.

money on us only, the then will have nothing  
to do, but to lay thofe duties on the articles  
which ſhe prohibits us to manufacture and  
the tragedy of American liberty is finiſhed.  
We have been prohibited from procuring  
manufactures, in all cafes, any where. but  
from Great-Britain, (excepting linens, which  
we are permitted to import directly from  
Ireland;) we have been prohibited, in ſome

Perhaps the nature of the neceſſitics of the

When the Carthaginians were poſſeſſed of

that the Sardinians ſhould not get corn any  
other way than from the Carthaginians.  
Then, by impoſing any duties they would.  
they drained from the miſerable Sardinians  
any ſums they pleaſed; and whenever that  
oppreſſed people made the leaſt movement

‘ The true reason,’ siiys he, &#x27;of requiring any qualification with re¬  
gard to pro}&gt;erty in voters is to exclude such persons as are in so mean  
a situation, that they are esteemed to have no will of their own. If  
these persons had votes, they would be tempted to dispose of them  
under some undue influence or other. This would give a great, an  
artful, or a wealthy man, a larger share in Elections than is consistent  
with general liberty. If it were probable that every man would use  
his vote freely, and without influence of any kind, then, upon the true  
theory, and genuine principles of liberty, every member of the commu¬  
nity, however pocir, should have a vote in electing those delegates to  
whose charge is committed the disposal of his property, his liberty, and  
his life. But, since that can hardly he expected in persons of indigent  
fortunes, or such as are under the immediate dominion of others,

f the religion of the original “ proprietary,” and of the early  
settlers in the colony; and because it was one of those things  
which have gone most directly to secure the independence of  
our country, and to make us what we now are. Judge Story,  
in his Commentaries on the Constitution, speaking of this fea-  
ture in the Maryland charter, thus describes it: “The charter  
further provided, that the proprietary should have authority,  
by and with the consent of the freemen, or their delegates as-  
sembled for the purpose, to make all laws for the province, so  
that such laws be consonant to reason, and not repugnant or  
contrary, but, as far as conveniently might be, agreeable to  
the laws, statutes, customs, and rights of this our realm of  
England.” ‘The proprietary was also authorized to levy sub-  
sidies with the assent of the people or Assembly.”* It is also  
a remarkable feature of the charter, that there is no clause  
which required the transmission of the province laws to the  
king, or providing for his approbation or consent. In these  
features of the Constitution of Maryland, the people or freemen  
were regarded as the source of authority in making the laws;  
and it is clear that no laws would be binding on them without  
their consent

such persons as are in so mean a

no will of their own. If these persons

for America. These severities, instead  
of securing, as they are intended to do,  
the dependency of the Colonies, may  
perhaps fit us for, and hasten the period  
of a glorious independence upon every­  
thing but the blessing of Heaven  
Now we ought to inculeate the principles  
of freedom, and we may hope that here­  
after a glofswes system of liberty may  
arise and flourish.&quot;  
  
In 1775, Aleaneer HAMilton said,  
in a pamphiet entitled &quot;The Farmer  
Refuted:&quot; &quot;You are mistaken when you  
confine arbitrary Government to a mon­  
archy. It is not the supreme power being  
placed in one instead of many, that dis­  
criminates an arbitrary from a free Gov­  
ernment. When any people are ruled by  
laws in framing which they have no  
part, that are to bind them to all intents  
and purposes, without in the same man­  
ner binding the Legislature themselves,  
they are, in the strictest sense, slaves,  
and the Government, with respect to  
them, is despotic; and hence the author­  
ity of Parliament over the Colonies  
would in all probability be a more intol­  
erable and excessive species of despotism  
  
than the most absolute monarchy, as the  
temptation to abuse would be greater.  
When the first principles  
of civil society are violated, and the  
rights of a whole people are invaded, the  
common forms of municipal law are  
not to be regarded. Men may then be­  
take themselves to the law of Nature;  
and if they but conform their actions to  
that standard, all cavils against them  
betray either ignorance or dishonesty.&quot;

subject of colonization, and the  
relative positions of the ancient and  
the modern acceptation of the  
expression. The term &quot;colony,&quot; from  
which colonization takes its origin, has  
a Latin derivation, viz.:-Colonia, a  
settlement or colony, from cole to  
cultivate. According to Dr. Johnson a  
&quot;colony&quot; signifies a &quot;body of people  
drawn from the mother country to inhabit  
some distant place;&quot; or, &quot;the country so  
planted.&quot; This definition would probably  
answer the requirements of ancient Roman  
enactments, but as laws of that period  
are not sufficiently advanced for modern  
government, we may be justified in  
allowing a corresponding variation in  
the significations of many expressions  
too great for the exigencies of the  
present age. A much wider scope,  
therefore, must be assigned to the

that /egis/ation and taxation go together; and that no

vided.”  
  
The a here touched the Farmer refers to again in  
his reply to his adversary, ‘‘A View of the Contro-  
versy,’ etc. (p. 10): *‘ The position that we are bound  
by no laws to which we have not consented either by  
ourselves, or our representatives, is a novel position,  
unsupported by any authoritative record of the British  
Constitution, ancient or modern. It is republican in its  
very nature, and tends to the utter subversion of the  
English monarchy.  
  
‘“This position has arisen from an artful change of  
terms. To say that an Englishman is not bound by any  
laws but those to which the representatives of the nation  
have given their consent, is to say what is true ; but to  
say that an Englishman is bound by no laws but those to  
which #e hath consented in person, or by dzs represent-  
ative, is saying what never was true, and never can be  
true. &lt;A great part of the people of England have no  
vote in the choice of representatives, and therefore are  
governed by laws to which they never consented either  
by themselves or by their representatives.”’

of government. (See Shea’s ‘* Hamilton,’’ p. 100.)  
  
“It is in vain to assert that two or more distinct legislatures cannot exist  
in the same State. If by the same State be meant the same individual  
community, itis true. Thus, for instance, there cannot be two supreme  
legislatures in Great Britain or two in New York. But if by the same  
State be understood a number of individual societies or bedies politic united  
under one common head, then I maintain that there may be one in Great  
Britain, another in Ireland, and another in New York, and still these sev-  
eral parts may form but one State. In order to this there must, indeed,  
be some connecting, pervading principle ; but this is found in the person  
and prerogative of the king. He it is that conjoins all these individual  
societies into one great body politic. Heit is that isto preserve their mutual  
connection and dependence, and make them all co-operate to one common  
end—the general good. . . . Those who aver that the independency  
of America on the British Parliament implies two sovereign authorities in  
the same State deceive themselves, or wish to deceive others in two ways:  
by confounding the idea of the same State with that of the same individual  
society, and by losing sight of that share which the king has in the sover-  
eignty both of Great Britain and America. . . . In this view there is  
not the least absurdity in the supposition that Americans have a right to a  
limitation similar to that of the people of Great Britain. At any rate there  
can never be said to be two sovereign powers in the same State ; whilst  
one common king is acknowledged by every member of it. Let us for a  
moment imagine the legislature of New York independent on that of Great  
Britain: where would be the mighty inconvenience? . . . In what  
manner would they interfere with each other? In none that I can per-  
ceive.”’

these autocratic features, it is worthy of note that this first  
American charter contains a general guarantee of civil  
rights, which the colonists ever after claimed as their  
legitimate heritage. It explicitly provided “that each  
and every the persons being our subjects, which shall  
dwell and inhabit within every and any of the said col-  
onies and plantations, and every of their children which  
happen to be born in any of the limits and precincts of the  
several colonies and plantations, shall have and enjoy all  
liberties, franchises, and immunities within any of our other  
dominions as if they had been abiding and born in this  
our realm of England.”&#x27; With this charter as a starting-  
point, we may trace the two diverging lines of develop-  
ment which mark the constitutional genesis of Virginia  
and the Southern colonies on the one hand, and that of  
Massachusetts and the New England colonies on the  
other.  
  
The history of the Southern colonies, and of Virginia  
in particular, begins with the operations of the London  
Company under this grant. The grant contained, as has  
been said, no de. ocratic features, and furnished no basis  
for any political organization among the colonists them

As to the quali fication of the  
electors. The true reason of requiring  
any qualification, with regard to  
property, in voters, is to exclude such  
persons as are in so mean a situation  
that they are esteemed to have no will  
of their own. If these persons had votes  
they would be tempted to dispose of them  
under some undue influence or other.  
This would give a great, an artful, or a  
wealthy man, a larger share in elections  
than is consistent with general liberty.  
If it were probable that every man would  
give his vote freely and without  
influence of any kind, then, upon the  
true theory and genuine principles of  
liberty, every member of the community,  
however poor, should have a vote in  
electing those delegates to whose charge  
is committed the disposal of his  
property, his liberty, and his life. But  
since that can hardly be expected in  
persons of indigent fortunes, or such as  
are under the immediate dominion of  
others, all popular States have been  
obliged to establish certain  
qualifications, whereby some, who are  
suspected to have no will of their own,  
are excluded from voting, in order to  
set other individuals, whose wills may  
be supposed independent, more thoroughly  
upon a level with each other.&quot; Sinc
