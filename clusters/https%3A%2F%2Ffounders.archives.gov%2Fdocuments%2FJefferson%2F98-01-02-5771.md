Dear Sir  
Monticello  
Dec. 26. 25.  
I wrote you a letter yesterday of which you will be free to make what use you please. this will contain matters not intended for the public eye. I see as you do, and with the deepest affliction, the rapid strides with which the federal branch of our government is advancing towards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the states, and the consolidation in itself of all powers foreign and domestic; and that too by constructions which, if legitimate, leave no limits to their power. take together the decisions of the federal court, the doctrines of the President, and the misconstructions of the constitutional compact, acted on by the legislature of the federal branch and it is but too evident that the three ruling branches of that department are in combination to strip their Colleagues, the States authorities of the powers reserved by them and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic. under the power to regulate Commerce they assume indefinitely that also over agriculture and manufactures, and  call it regulation to take the earnings of one of these branches of industry, and that too the most depressed and put them into the pockets of the other, the most flourishing of all. under the authority to establish post roads, they claim that of cutting down mountains for the construction of roads, of digging canals, and, aided by a little sophistry on the words ‘general welfare’ a right to do, not only the acts to effect that which are specifically enumerated and permitted, but whatsoever they shall think, or pretend will be for the general welfare, and what is our resource for the preservation of the constitution? reason and argument? you might as well reason and argue with the  marble columns encircling them. the Representatives chosen by ourselves?  they are joined in the combination, some from incorrect views of governmt some from corrupt ones, sufficient,  voting together, to  out-number the sound parts; and, with majorities of only 1, 2, or 3. bold enough to go forward in defiance. are we then to stand to our arms, with the hot-headed Georgian? No. that must be the last resource, not to be thought of until much longer and greater sufferings. if every infraction of a compact of so many parties is to be resisted at once, as a dissolition of it, none can ever be formed which would last one year. we must have patience and long endurance then with our brethren while under delusion; give them time for reflection and experience of consequences; keep ourselves in a situation to profit by the chapter of accidents, and separate from our companions only when the sole alternatives left are the dissolution of our union with them, or submission to a government without limitation of powers. between these two evils when we must make a choice, there can be no hesitation. but in the mean while the states should be watchful to note every material usurpation on their rights, to denounce them as they occur in the most peremptory terms, to protect against them as wrongs to which our present submission shall be considered, not as acknolegements or precedents of right, but as a temporary yielding to the lesser evil, until their accumulation shall overweigh that of separation. I would go still further, and give to the federal member; by a regular amendment of the constitution, a right to make roads and canals of intercommunication between the states, providing sufficiently against corrupt practices in Congress (log-rolling &amp;c.) by declaring that the federal proportion of each state of the monies so employed shall be in works within the state, or elsewhere with it’s consent, and with a due salvo of jurisdiction. this is the course which I think safest and best as yet.You ask my opinion of the propriety of giving publicity to what is stated in your letter as having past between mr John Q. Adams and yourself. of this no one can judge but yourself. it is one of those questions which belong to the Forum of feelings. this alone can decide on the degree of confidence implied in the disclosure whether under no circumstances it was to be communicable to others? it does not seem to be of that character, or at all to wear that aspect. they are historical facts, which belong to the present, as well as future times. I doubt whether a single fact, known to the world, will carry as clear conviction to it, of the correctness of our knolege of the treasonable views of the federal party of that day as that disclosed by this the most nefarious and daring attempt to dissever the Union, of which the Hartford Convention was a subsequent chapter; and both of these having failed, Consolidation becomes the 4th chapter of the next book of their history. but this opens with a vast accession of strength from their younger recruits, who having nothing in them of the feelings or principles of ’76 now look to a single and splendid government of an Aristocracy, founded on banking institutions and monied in corporations under the guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures commerce and navigation, riding and ruling over the plundered  ploughman and beggared yeomanry. this will be to them a next best blessing to the Monarchy of their first aim, and perhaps the surest stepping stone to it.I learn with great satisfaction that your school is thriving well, and that you have at it’s head a truly classical scholar. he is one, of 3. or 4. only whom I can hear of in the state. we

efuse as soon as we can get from better schools a sufficiency of those properly instructed to form a class. we must get rid of this Connecticut Latin, of this barbarous confusion of long and short—..—syllables which renders doubtful whether we are listening to a reader of Cherokee, Shawanee, Iroquis or what—our University has been most fortunate in the five Professors procured from England. a finer selection could not have been made. besides their being of a grade of science which has left little superior behind, the correctness of their moral character, their accomodating dispositions and zeal for the prosperity of the institution leave us nothing more to wish. I verily believe that as high a degree of education can now be obtained here as in the country they left. and a finer set of youths I never saw assembled for instruction. they committed some irregularities at first, until they learned the lawful length of their tether. since which it has never been transgressed in the smallest degree. a great proportion of them are severely devoted to study; and I fear not to say that within 12. or 15. years from this time a majority of the Rulers of our state will have been educated here. they shall carry hence the correct principles of our day and you may count assuredly that they will exhibit their country in a degree of sound respectability it has never known either in our days, or those of our forefathers. I cannot live to see it. my joy must only be that of anticipation. but that you may see it in full fruition is the probable consequence of the 20. years I am ahead—of you in time, and is the sincere prayer of your affectionate and constant friendTh: Jefferso

&quot; 1 sec as you do &amp;. with ilie deepest aflUrtiun,  
the rapid abides with which the federal branch of  
our government, is advancing towards the usurpa­  
tion of all the rights reserved to the slates, and 1  
the consolidation in itself, of all powers foreign |  
and domestic, Sc that too by constructions, winch  
if legitimate, leave no limits to their power. Take  
together the decisions of the federal court, the doc­  
trines of the President k the inisconstrnctior.e of the  
constitutional compact acted on by the legislature of  
the federal branch; and it is but too evident that  
the three ruling branches of that department, are  
in combination, to etrip their colleagues, the state I  
authorities of the powers reserved by them, and  
to exercise themselves, all functions foreign and  
domestic. Under the power to regulate commerce, I  
they assume indefinitely, that also over agricul,  
tuie and manufactures; and call it regulation too, j  
to take the earnings of one of these branches ol ;  
industry, and that tor, the moat depressed, and ]  
put them into the pockets of the other, the most j  
flourishing of ail. Undvr the authority to eata* I  
bli-li post road-, they claim that of culling down !  
Anounta ns, for the construction of roads, of dig- j  
ging canal*; fc aided by a little sophistry on tho  
words “ general welfare,” a right to do, not only j  
the act9, to effect that, w hich are specifically enu­  
■ iterated and permitted; but whatsoever they shall ;  
think, or pretend, will he for the general welfare. &#x27;  
And what is our resource for the preservation of tire  
^constitution? Reason and argument. You might  
as well reason attJ argue wiib the marble column-* i  
encircling tlirm. &#x27; The Representatives chosen by 1  
ourselves—&#x27;hey are joined in the combination, j  
some from incurred viewB of government, some  
from corrupt ones, sufficient voting together to out I  
number the sound parts, and with majorities of on­  
ly nr 3, bold enough to go forward in deli,  
ance. Are ue then to stand at arms?&quot;  
[A few words are here omitted, relating merely  
to an individual.]  
  
r»o! that muii be the last resource, not to be I  
thought of until much looger, and greater suffer­  
ings. If every infraction of a compact of so ma­  
ny parlies, is to be resisted at ouce as a dissolution  
ol it, none can ever be forinej which would last  
one year. We must have patience and long en­  
durance then, with our brethren, while under de­  
lusion. Give them time for iejection and expe­  
rience of consequences; keep ourselves in a situation  
to profit by the chapter of accidents—and separate  
troin our companion*, only when the sole alterna  
lives left, are the di-ssolution of our union with  
them, or submission to a government without li­  
mitation of poweis. Between these two evils,  
when we must make choice, there can can he no  
hesitation; but in the meanwhile, (he states should  
he watchful to note every urateiial usurpation on  
their rigbta—to denounce them as they occur io  
the most peremptory terms, to protest against them&#x27;;  
as wrongs to which our present submission shall  
be considered, not as acknowledgements or prece­  
dents of right, but, as a temporary yielding to the  
lesser evil—until their accumulation shall over­  
weigh that of separation. I would go still fur­  
ther, and give to the federal member, by regular  
amendment of the constitution, a right to make  
roads and canals of intercommunication betweerv  
the states—providing sufficiently against corrupt*,  
practices in Congress (log rolling, &amp;c.) by decla-&#x27;  
[ring that the federal proportion ol each state of  
the monies so emfdoyed, &gt;h.dl be in work* wit bin  
the state, or else.vheie with its consent, and with  
a due salvo of jurisdiction. This is the course,!  
\vbich I think, safest and beat as yet.  
Vou ask iny opinion of the propriety of giving  
publicity to what is stated in your letter, as hav­  
ing past between Mr. John Q. Adama and your  
seif. Of tbi*, no one can judge but youiself. It j  
is one of &#x27;he-e questions which belong to the Fo­  
rum of feeling. This alone, can deciJe on the de­  
gree of confidence implied in the disclosure.—  
Whether, uud .r no circumstances, it was to be!  
communicable to others. It does not seem to be of  
that character, or at all to meet that aspect. They  
are historical facts, which belong to the present,  
as well as future tune. I doubt, whether a single  
fact, known to the world, will carry as clear a j  
conviction to it, of the correctness of our know- i  
ledge of the treasonable views of the federal party I  
of that day—as that disclosed by this roost t.efari- i  
ous and dering attempt, to dissever the Union, of j  
which the Hertford Convention was a subsequent |  
chapter, and both of these, having failed, conso- j  
lidation becomes the first hook of their history_!  
But this opens with a vast acce-sion of abength, i  
from their younger recruits, who having nothing |  
in them of the feelings or principles of ’76, now ;  
look to a single and splendid government of an ■  
Aristocracy, founded on banking institutions and  
monied incorporations, under the guise and cloak •  
of llieir favored branches of manufactures, com- j  
niercc and navigation, riding and ruling over the  
plundered ploughman.it beggared yeomanry. Thia i  
will be to them a next best blessing to the rno i

“Dean sta—lI see as you do and with the deepest af-  
fliction, the rapid strides with which the federal branch  
of ow government, is advancing towards the usurpation  
of all the rights reserved to the states, and the consolida-  
tion in itself, of all powers, foreign and domestic, and that  
too by constructions, which if legitimate, leave no limits  
totheir power. ‘lake together the decisions of the fede-  
ral court, the‘doctrines of the president, and the miseon-  
stryctidns of the constitutional compact acted on by the  
Jegislatyre of the federal branch; and it is but too evident  
that the three ruling branches of that departmeut, are in  
sombination to strip then colleagues, the state authorities,  
of the powers reserved by them, and to exercise them-  
selves all functions foreign and domestic. Under the  
power to regulate commerce, they assume indefinitely,  
that also over agriculture and manufactures; and eall it re-  
gulation too, to taxe the earnings of one of these branches  
of industry, and that too the most depressed, and put them  
into the pockets of the other, the most flourishing of all.  
Under the authority to establish post roads, they claim that  
of cutting down mountains, for the eanstruction of roads, of  
digging canals, and ailed by a little sophistry on the words  
“general welfare,” a right to do, not only the acts, to ef-  
fect that which are sufficiently enumerated and permit-  
ted, but whatsoever they shall think, or pretend, will be  
for the general welfare. Ancd-what is our resource for  
the preservation of the constitution? Reason and argu-  
ment. You might as well reason and argue with the mar-  
ble columns encireling them. ‘The representatives chosen  
by ourselves—they are joined in the combination, some  
from incorrect views of government, some from corrupt  
ones, stifficient voting together to out namber the sound  
parts, and with majorities of only 1, 2, or 3, bold enough  
to go forward in defiance. dre we then to stand at arms?”  
  
[A few words are here omitted, relating merely to an  
andividual. |  
  
**No! that must be the last resource, not to be thought of  
until much longer, and greater swierings. If every in-  
fraction of a compact Of so many parties, is to be resisted  
at once asa dissolution of it, none can ever be formed  
which would last one year. We must have patience and  
Jong endurance then, with our brethren, while under de-  
Jusion. Give them time for reilection and experience of

te trom our compa-  
nions, only when the sole alternatives left, are the Sean.  
  
tion of our union with them, or submission to a govern-  
ment without limitation‘of powers. Between these two  
evils, when we must make choice, there ean be no hesita-  
tion; but in the mean while, the states should be watchful  
to note every matermal usurpation on their rights—to de-  
nourice them as they occur in the most peremptory terms,  
to protest against them; as wrongs to which our present  
submission shall be be considered, not as acknowledgments  
or precedents of right, but a atestiuony yielding to the  
lesser evil—until their aceu oulation shall over weigh that  
of separation. | would go sull further, and give to the fede-  
ral member, by regular amendment of the constitution, a  
right to make roads and canals of intercommunication  
between the states—providing sufficiently against corrupt  
practices in congress, (log rolling, &amp;c.) by declaring that  
the federal proportion of each state of the monies so em-  
ployed, shall be in works within the state, or elsewhere  
with its consent, and with a due salvo of jurisdiction. —  
This is the course, which I think safest and best as yet.  
You ask my opinion of the propricty of giving publicity  
to what is stated in your letter, as having past between  
Mr. John Q. Adams and yourself. Of this, no one can  
judge but yourself. Itis one of these questions which be-  
long to the forum of feeling. ‘This alone, can decide on  
the degree of confidence implied in the disclosure. Whe-  
ther, under no circumstances, it was to be communicable  
to others. — It does not seein to be of that character, or at  
all to meet that aspect. They are historiéal facts, which  
belong to the present, as well as future time. I doubt  
whether a single fact, known to the world, will carry as  
clear a conviction to it, of the correctness of our know-  
ledge of the treasonable vicws of the federal party of that  
day—as that diselosed by this most nefarious and daring  
attempt, to dissever the union, of which the Harford con-  
  
vention was a subsequent chapter, and both of these, hav-  
  
irg failed, consolidation becomes the first book of their  
history. But this opens witha vast accession of strength,  
from their younger recruits, who having nothing in them  
of the feelings or principles of 776, now look to a single  
and splendid government of an aristocracy, founded on  
banking institutions and monied incorporations, under the  
guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures,  
commerce and navigation, riding aud ruling over the plun-  
dered ploughman and beggaredyeomanry. This will be  
to them a next best blessmg to the monarehy of their  
first aim-——-and, perhaps, the surest stepping stone to it.”’

&quot;Dear Sir: I sec as&#x27;youdoand  
  
with the deepest affliction, the ra­  
pid strides with which the federal  
  
branch ot our government, is ad  
vancing towards the usurpation of &#x27;  
  
all the rights reserved to the  
states, and the consolidation in&quot;  
  
itself, of all powers foreign and  
  
lrminti niwl th.&#x27;lt tOO bv rrr

leave no limits to then power.  
  
Take together the decisions of  
the federal court, the doctrines of  
the President and the miscon­  
structions of the constitutions!  
compact acted on by the legisla­  
ture of the federal branch; and i  
  
is but too evident that the thrct  
  
ruling branches of that depart  
  
mum, uiu in uuuiuuiuiiuii, iu ui .  
  
their colleagues, the state authori v&quot;&#x27;  
  
ties, of the powers reserved l  
  
them, and to exercise themselves,  
all functions foreign and domes­  
tic. Under the power to regiduto  
commerce, they assume indciV ,  
nitoK- tlint nln nvp.r norrir.iilrnn .  
  
and manufactures; and call it re-  
&quot;illation too, to take the earning  
of one of these branches of indus­  
try, and that too the most de­  
pressed, and put them into the  
pockets of the other, the most  
depressed of all. Under tlie au­  
thority to establish post roads,  
they claim that of cutting down  
mountains, for the construction of  
roads, of digging canals; and aid­  
ed by a little sophistry on t lie  
words &quot;general welfare,&quot; a right  
  
to do, not only the acts, to effect 4  
that, which &quot;ar) specifically cnu-  
merated and permitted; but what­  
soever they shall think, or pre- &amp;  
tend, will be for the general wc! f  
  
fare. And what is our resource  
for the preservation of the consti­  
tution! Reason and argument.  
You might as well reason and ar­  
ffuc with the marble columns en  
circling them. The representa­  
tives chosen bv ourselves thev  
are joined in the combination,  
some from incorrect views of 0­  
vcrnment, some from corrupt ones,  
sufficient voting together to out­  
number the sound parts, and with  
majorities of only 1, 2 or 3, bold  
enough to go forward in defiance.  
Arc tec then to stand at arms!&quot;  
&quot;No! thatmust be the last rc-  
  
source, not to oe tnougnt or mini

compact of so many parties, is to  
  
be resisted at once as a dissolu­  
tion of it, nono can ever be form

Wo must have patience and long  
  
endurance then, with our broth

them, time for reflection and expe­  
rience of consequences; keep our­  
selves in a situation to profit by  
the chapter of accidents and se­  
parate from our companions, only  
when the sole alternatives lefr,  
are the dissolution of our union  
with them, or submission to a go­

powers. Between these two evils,  
when we must make choice, there

«Dxar Sir—l see as you do, and with the  
deepest affliction, the rapid strides with which  
the federal branch of our goverpment is ad­  
vaocing lowards the usurpation of all the rights  
res€rved to the states, and the consolidation in  
itself, of all powers, foreign and domestic, and  
that too, by constructio&#x27;s which, if legitimate,  
leave no limits to their power. Take together  
the decisions of the federal court, the doctrines  
of the President, and the misconstructions of  
the constitutional compact acted on by tbe leg­  
islatore of the federal branch; and it is but too  
evident that the three ruling branches of that  
department, are in combination to strip their  
colleagues, the state authorities, of the powers  
reserved by them, and to exercise thémselves,  
all functions, foreign and domestic, Under the  
power to regulate commerce, (hey assume in­  
definitely, that also over agriculture and waou­  
factures; and call it regulation too, to take tbe  
earoings of one of these brauches of industry,  
and that too, the most depressed, and put them  
into the packets of the other, the most flourish­  
ing of all. Under the authority to establish  
post roads, they claim that of cutting down  
inountains, for the construction of roads, of dig­  
ging canals ; and aided by a little sophistry on  
the wcrds * general weifare,” a right to do,  
not only the acts, to effect that which are speei­  
fically enumerated and permitted ; but whatso­  
ever they shail thiok, or pretend, will be for the  
general welfare. And what isour resource for  
the preservation of the coustitution? Reason  
and argument. You might as well reason and  
argue with the inarble columns eocircling them.  
The Representatives chosen by ourselves—  
they are joined in the combination, some from  
incorrect views of government, some from cor­  
rupt ones, sufficient,voling together to out num­  
ber the sound parts,and wit? majorites of only  
1, 2 or 3, bold enough to go forward in defiance.  
Are we then Lo stand at arms ¢  
[A few words are here omitted, relatiog  
merely to an individual.] ‘  
- «No! that must be the last resource, not to  
be thought of until much longer, and greater  
sufferings. If every infraction of a compact of  
80 inany parties, is to be resisted at once as a  
dissolution of it, nove can ever be formed which  
would last one year, We must have patience  
and long endurance then, with our brethren,  
while under deiusion. Give them time for re­  
flectivn and experignce of consequences; keep  
ourselves io a situation to profit by the chapter  
of accidents—and separate from our compan­  
ions, only whenthe sole alternatives left, are  
the disolution of our usion-with them, or sub­  
mission (0 a 4 government without limitation of  
powers. Between these two evils, when we  
woust make choice, there can be no hesitation;  
but in the meanwhile, the siates should be  
  
watchful to nole every maferial ueurpation on  
their rights—to denounce them as they occur  
in the most peremptory terms, o protesl  
against them, as wrongs to which our present  
submission shall be counsidered, not as acknowl­  
edgements or precedents of right, but as a ten­  
porary yielding to the lesser evil—ootil their  
accumulation shall overweigh that of separa­  
tion. 1 would go still farther, and give 10 the  
federal member, by regular amendment of the  
constitution, a right to make roads and canals  
of intercommunication between the states—  
providing sufficiently against corrupt practices  
in Congress {log Tolling, &amp;c.) by declaring that.  
the federal proportion of each state of the mon­  
ies so employed, shall be in works within  
the state, or elswhere, with its conseot, aud  
with a due salvo of jurisdiction. This is the  
course, which I think, safest and best as yet.  
You ask my opinion of the propriety of giv­  
ing publicity to what is stated in your letter, a 8  
haviog past between Mr. Joho Q. Adains and  
yourself. Of this, no one can jadge but your­  
self. It is one of those guestions which belong  
to the forum of feeling. This alone can decide  
on the degree of confidence implied io the  
disclosure. Whether, under no circumstances,  
it was to be communicable to others, It does  
not seem to be of that charac(er, or at all to  
meet that aspect. They are historical facts,  
which belong to the present as well as future  
time. I doubt whether a single fact, known to  
the world, will carry as clear a conviction to it,  
of the correctness of our koowledge of the  
treasonable viewsof the federal party of that  
day, as that disclosed by this most nefarious  
&#x27;and daring attempt to dissever the union, of  
which the Hartford convention was a subsvquent  
chapter ; and both of these baviog failed, con­  
sOoLIDATION becomes the first book of their  
history. But this opens with a vast accession  
of strength, from their younger recruits, who  
baviog nothing in them of the feelings or prin.  
ciples of *76, now look to a single and splendid  
government of an aristocracy, founded on bank­  
ing institutions and monied incorporations,.un­  
der the guise and cloak of their favored branch­  
es of manufactures, commerce and navigation,  
riding and ruling over the plundered ploughmar

has never been transgressed in the smallest

verely devoted to study, and I fear vot to say,  
that within 12 or 15 years from this time, a

too, by constructions which, if legitimate, leave  
no limits to ttieir power. Take; together the  
decisions of the Federal Codrt, the doctrines of  
the President, Sc the misconstructions of the coh­  
stUutlonal compact, acted on by the Legislature  
of the Federal branch and it is buf too evident  
that the three ruling branches of that department  
are in combination, to strip their colleagues, the  
State authprities,of the powers reserved by them,  
and to exercise, themselves, all functions, fo­  
reign and domestic. Under the power to regii­  
lnte commerce, the assume, indefinitely, that  
alsoover agriculture and manufactures : and Call  
it regulation, too, to take the earnings of pne of  
these branches of industry, and that, too the most  
depressed, and put them into the pockets of the  
othrr, the most flourishing of all. Under the  
authority to establish post roads, they claim that  
of cutting down mountains, for the construction  
of roads, of digging canals, and, aided by a little  
sophistry on the words &quot; general welfare,&quot; a  
  
rtght to do not only the acts to enect that which  
re specifically enumerate &amp; permitted.but hat-  
ever they shall think or pretend will be for the  
general welfare. And what is our resource for  
the preservation of the Constitution ? Reason  
and argument. , You might as well reason and  
argue with the marble columns&quot; encircling them.  
The Representatives chosen by ourselves they  
re joined in the combination, some from incor  
rect views of government, some from corrupt  
ones, &#x27;sufficient voting together to outnumber  
the sound parts, and with majorities pf only 1,  
2, or 3, bold nough torgo forward in defiance.  
ire ive then t stand at cnir arms ?  
&#x27; No ! that must be the last resource, not to  
be thought of until much longer and greater suf­  
ferings. If eveiy infraction of a compact of so  
many parties, is to be resisted at once as a dissolu  
tion of it, none can ever be formed which wnuld  
last one year. We must have patience and long  
endurance, then, with our brethren, while under  
delusion. Give them time for reflection, and  
experience of consequences ; keep ourselves in  
a situation to profit by the chapter of accidents  
and separate from our companions, only when  
the s.le alternatives left, are the dissolution of  
our Union with them, or submission to a govern-!  
ment without limitation of powers. Between  
these two evils, when we must make choice,  
there can be no hesitation : but in the meanwhile,  
the States should be watchful to note every ma­  
terial usurpation on their rights to denounce  
them as they occur in the most peremptory  
terms, to protest agajnst them, as wrongs to  
which our present submission shall be consider­  
ed, not as acknowledgements or precedents of  
right, but as a temporary yielding to the lesser  
eviluntil tljeir accumulation shall outweigh  
tha of separation. I would go still further, and  
give to the federal members by regular amend­  
ment of the Constitution, a right to make roads  
arid canals of intercommunication between the  
States providing sufficiently against , corrupt  
practices in jongress iog rolling, 6cc,; by de­  
claring that ,ihe federal proportion of each State,  
of flie moneys so employed, shall be in works  
within the State, or elsewhere with its -consent,  
and with a due salvo of jurisdiction.- This is  
the course, which I think safest and best as yei  
T You ask my opinion of the propriety of giving  
publicity to what is stated in your letter, as hav­  
ing past between Mr. John Q&quot;. Adams and youi­  
self. Of this, no one can judge but yourself.  
It is one of those questions which belong to the  
Forum of feeling. This alone can decide on the  
degree of confidence implied in the disclosure.  
W hether, under no circumstances, it was to be  
communicable to others. It does not seem to be  
of that character, or at all to meet that aspect.  
I fiey-are historical lacts, which belong to the  
present, as well as future time. I doubt, w heth-  
er a single fact, known to the world, will carry  
as clear a conviction tp it.of the correctness ofjour  
Knowledge 01 the treasonable views ot the feder  
al party of that day as that disclosed by this  
most nefarious and daring attempt to dissever  
uie onion, or w men ..tne tiaruora uonvention  
was a subsequent chapter, and &#x27;both of these  
navmg taueu, consolidation becomes the hrst  
book of their history. ; Hut this opens with a vast  
accession of strength from their younger re­  
cruits, who, having nothing in them of the fcel-  
and splendid government of an aristocracy, found  
ed on banking institutions and moneyed incor­  
porations, under the guise and cloak of their fa  
vored branches of manufactures, Commerce, and  
navigation, riding and ruling over the plundered  
ploughman, and beg.ared yeomanry. This will

ks it than we par eive in the letier of Nir. Jef­  
ferson to Mr. Giles. What does ke say ? He la­  
ments the rapid strides with which the “federal  
branch es our government is advancing towards  
the usurpation of il the rights reserved to the  
States, and the consolidation in itself of all pow­  
ers, foreign and domestic, and that too by con­  
structions which, if legitimate, leave no limits to  
their power.” “Take (said he) together the decis­  
tonsof the Federal Courts, THE DOCTRINES OF  
THE PRESIDENT, and the mis-constructions  
of the constitutional compact, acted on by the  
legislature of the federal branch; and it is but  
too evident, that the three ruling branches of  
that department, are in combination to strip  
their colleagues, the State authorities, of the  
powers reserved by them; and to exercise them­  
selves all functions foreign and domestic. Un­  
der the power to regulate commerce, they assume  
indefinitely, that cver AGRICULTURE and MANUFAC­  
TUR EB, and call it regulation too, to take the earn­  
ings of one of these branches of tndustry and that  
too, the most depressed, and put them into the poc/:-  
ets of the other, the most flourishing of all.”” “And  
what,” continues he, “is our resource for the  
preservation of the constitution? Reason and  
argument. You might as well reason and argue  
-with the marble columns encircling them.”’—  
“ARE wr THEN,” coatinued he, “To STAND AT  
ARMS 2 No! that must be the last resource, not to  
be thought of till much longer and greater suf­  
ferings. If every iafraction of a compact of so  
many parties is to be resisted AT ONCE, as a  
dissolution of it, none can ever be formed which  
would last one year.”” We must have patience  
and long endurance then, with our brethyen,  
while under delucion. Give. them time for re­  
flection and experience of cousequences; keep  
ourselves in a situation to profit by the chapter

ticus foreign ami domestic. Under the power to I

also over agriculture and manufactures; and call ii  
[ regulation too, to take the earnings of one of these  
branches of industry, and that too, the most depress­  
ed, and put them into the pockets oi the other, Al­  
most flourishing of all. Under the authority to cs­  
establish post roads, they claim that of cutting down  
mountains, for the construction of roads, of digging  
canals; and aided by a little sophistry on the words  
“general welfare,” a right to do, not otdy the acts,  
i to etrcct that, which are specifically enumerated

| Dear sir—“I see as you do, and with the deepest af.  
fliction, the rapid strides with which the federal branch  
of our government is advancing towards the usurpation  
of all the rights reserved to the stutes, aud the consolida-  
tion in itself, of all powers foreign and domestic, and. that  
too, by constructions, which if iegitimate, leave no limits  
to their power. ‘Take together the decisions of the fe-  
deral court, the doctrines of the president and the mis-  
constructions of the constitutional compact acted on by  
the legislature of the federal branch, and it is but too  
evident that the three ruling branches of that department,  
are in combination to strip their colleagues, the state au-  
thorities, of the powers reserved by them, and to. exercise  
themselves, all functions, foreign and domestic. Under  
the power to regulate commerce, they assume indefinite.  
ly, that also over agriculture and manufactures; and cal!  
it regulation too, to take the earnings of one of these  
branches of industry, and that too, the most ati  
and put them into the pockets of the other, the mos  
flourishing of all. Under the authority to establish pos:  
roads, they claim that of cutting down mountains for the  
construction of roads; ef digging canals; and aided by a  
litte sophistry on the words “general welfare,” a righ:  
to do, not only the acts, to effect that, which are specili-  
cally enumerated and permitted; but whatsoever the)  
shall think, or pretend, will be for the general welfare  
Aud what is our resource for the preservation of the con-  
stitution? Reason and argument? You might as well  
reason and argue with the marble columns encireling  
them. The represcutatives chosen by ourselves ?—They  
are joined in the combination, some from incorrect views  
of government, some from corrupt ones, sufficient voting  
together to out number the sound parts, and with ma-  
jorities of only 1, 2 or 3, bold enough to go forward in

one can judge but yourself. It is one of those questions

decide on the degree of confidence implied in the dis-  
closure. Whether, under no cireumstances, it was to be  
communicable to others. It does not seem to be of that  
charaeter, or at allto wear thataspect. They are histo-  
rical facts, which belong to the present, as well as future  
time. I doubt, whether&#x27;a single fact, known tothe world,  
will carry as clear a conviction to it, of the correctness of  
our knowledge of the treasonable views of the federal  
party of that day—as that disclosed by this most nefa-  
rious and daring attempt, to dissever the union of which  
the Hartford Convention was a subsequent chapter, and  
both of these having failed, consolidation becomes the  
first book of their history.—But this opers with a vast  
accession of strength, from their younger recruits, who  
having nothing in them of the feelings or principles of 76,  
now iook to a single and splendid government of an aris-  
tovracy, founded on banking institutions, and monied in-  
corporations, ander the guise and cloak of their favored  
branches of manufactures, commerce and navigation, rid-  
ing and ruling over the plundered ploughman, and beg-  
gard yeomanry. This will he to them a next best bless-

Dear Sir—I see as you do, and with the deepest afflic-  
tion, the rapid strides with which the Federal branch of our  
government, is advancing towards the usurpation of all  
the rights reserved to the States, and the consolidation in  
itself, of all powers foreign and domestic, and that, too,  
by constructions which, if legitimate, leave no limits to  
their power. Take together the decisions of the Federal  
Court, the doctrines of the President, and the miscon-  
structions of the constitutional compact acted on by the  
legislature of the Federal branch, and it is but too evi-  
dent that the three ruling branches of that department,  
are in combination to strip their colleagues, the state au-  
thorities, of the powers reserved by them, and to exercise  
themselves, all functions foreign and domestic. Under  
the power to regulate commerce, they assume indefinitely  
that also, over agriculture and manufactures, and call it  
regulation too, to take the earnings of ene of those  
branches of industry, and that too, the most depressed,  
and put them into the pockets of the other, the most flour-  
ishing ofall. Under the authority to establish post roads,  
they claim that of cutting down mountains for the con-  
struction of roads, of digging canals, and, aided by a lit-  
tle sophistry on the words “general welfare,” a right to do,  
not only the acts to effect that, which are specifically enu-  
merated and permitted, but whatsoever they shall think,  
or pretend, will be forthe general welfare. And what is  
our resource for the preservation of the Constitution?  
Reason and argument! You might as well reason and  
argue with the marble columns encircling them. The rep-  
resentatives chosen by ourselves? They are joined in the  
combination, some from incorrect. views of government,  
some from corrupt ones, sufficient voting together to out-  
number the sound parts,and with majorities of only 1,2,or 3,  
bold enough to go forward in defiance. Are we then to  
stand to our arms?  
  
“No! that must be the last resource, not to be thought  
of until much longer and greater sufferings. If every in-  
fraction of a compact ofso many parties, is to be resisted  
at once as a dissolution of it, nove can ever be formed  
which would last one year. We must have patience and  
ong endurance then, with our brethren, while under delu-  
sion. Give them time for reflection and experience of  
consequences; keep ourselves in a situation to profit by  
the chapter of accidents—and separate from our compan-  
ions only when the sole alternatives left, are the dissolu-  
tion of our union with them, or submission to a govern-  
ment without limitation of powers.”

the constitutional compact, acted on by the legislature of the fede-

of that department are in combination to strip their colleagues, the  
state authorities, of the powers reserved by them, and to exercise  
to themselves all functions, foreign and domestic. Under the power  
to regulate commerce, they assume indefinitely that also over agri-  
culture and manufactures, and call it regulation to take the earn-

depressed, and put them into the pockets of the other, the most

I adopt the sentiments expressed in this letter not im-

cause I conceive them consistent with the sound policy

“You ask my opizion of the propriety of giving |  
publicity to what is stated in your leiter, as having |  
passed between Mr. J. Q. Adums and yoursell. Of this  
no one can judge but yourscif. It is one of those ques­  
tions which belong to the forum of feeling. &#x27;T&#x27;his’  
alone can decide on the degree of confidence implied  
in the disclosure ; whether under no circumstances it  
was to be communicated to others. It does not  
seem to be of that character, or at all to wear that  
aspect. 1 doubt whether a single f:ct, known to the |  
world, will carry as clear conviction 10 it, of the cor­  
rectness of our knowledge of the treasonable views of  
the federal party of that day, as that d&#x27;sclosed by this, |  
the most nefarious and daring attemnpt to dissever the |  
Union, of which the Hartford Convention was a sab- |  
sequent chapter : and both of these having failed, |  
consolidation becomes the first chapter of the next |  
book of their history. But this opens with a vast ac- |  
cession of strength from their yonager recruits, who, |  
having nothirg in them of the feelings or principles  
of ’76, now look to a single and spiendid govern- |  
ment of an aristoeracy, fouuded on bankirg instita- |  
tions, and monied incorporations under the guise and  
cloak of their favored branches of manufactores,  
commerce, and navigation, riding and ruling over the  
plundered plonghmun and beggared yeomanry.—

and even as far as the State is interested, conferring partial instead of general  
advantages.”  
The opinions of Mr. Jefferson on this subject, were not left to doubtful  
inference. In aletter to William B. Giles, speaking of the administration of  
John Quincy Adatns, lie says—“Under the authority to establish post roads,  
they claim the right of cutting down mountains for the construction of  
roads, and of digging canals, and aided bv a little sophistry on the words,  
‘‘general welfare,” a right t« do, not only the acts to effect that which is  
specifically enumerated and permitted, but whatsoever they shall think or  
pretend, will be for the general welfare. * * * * I would go still fur­  
ther, and giie to the federal member, by a regular amendment of the Con­  
stitution, a right to make roads and canals of intercommunication be­  
tween the Stales, providing sufficiently against corrupt practices in Congress.

of our day J A correspondence occurred  
between Jefferson and Governor Giles of  
Virginia, in relation to Mr. Adams&#x27; political  
conduct in 1808-9. In discussing what  
steps were necessary to resist what he be­  
lieved to be the usurpations of the National

&quot;I see as you do, and with the deepest af­  
fliction, the rapid strides with which the Fed­  
eral branch of our Government is advancing  
toward the usurpation of all the rights reserv­  
ed to the States, and the consolidation in it­  
self of a l powers, foreign and domestic, and  
that, too, by constructions which, if legitimate,  
leave no limits to their power. Take together  
the decisions of the Federal Courts, the doc­  
trines of the President, and the misconstruc­  
tions of the Constitutional compact, acted on  
by the Legislature of the Federal branch, and  
it is but too evident that the three ruling  
branches of that department are in combina  
tion to strip their colleagues--the State au  
thorities,-of the power reserved by them, and  
to exercise themselves all functions, foreign
