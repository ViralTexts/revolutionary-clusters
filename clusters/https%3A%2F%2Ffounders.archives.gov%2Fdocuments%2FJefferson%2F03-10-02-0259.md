litary leaders. the whole Southern continent is sunk in the deepest ignorance and bigotry. a single priest is more than a sufficient opponent to a whole army; and were it not that the lower clergy, as poor and oppressed as the people themselves, has very much taken side with the revolutionists, their cause would have been desperate from the beginning. but, when their independance shall be established, the same ignorance &amp; bigotry will render them incapable of forming and maintaining a free government: and it is excruciating to believe that all will end in military despotisms under the Bonapartes of their regions. the only comfortable prospect which this clouded horizon offers is that, these revolutionary movements having excited into exercise that common sense which nature has implanted in every one, it will go on advancing towards the lights of cultivated reason, will become sensible of it’s own powers, and in time be able to form some canons of freedom, and to restrain their leaders to an observance of them. in the meantime we must pray to god as most heartily we do for your country, that ‘he will be pleased to give them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions.’  
Your resolution not to revisit your own country, while under foreign force, is worthy of you. no patriotism requires us to incur the pain of witnessing miseries which we cannot remedy or alleviate, and towards which, even in absence, your pen may do more than your presence. that such a country and such a people can never be kept permanently prostrate on the earth is a decree of heaven, which will not pass away. our great anxiety is lest they should lengthen their sufferings by premature and abortive attempts to end them; and our wish that they may have patience, yet a while, until dissensions among their enemies may give them a choice of friends. in general it is sinful, but now pious, to pray for war and strife among nations, as the only means of dissolving their criminal combinations.  
I congratulate you on the happy union of your daughter with a peer and patriot of France: and should your son realise the hope you hold up to us of visiting this sanctuary of the unfortunate of every country where ‘the wolf dwells with the lamb, and the leopard lieth down with  
			 the kid,’ he will be hailed as the son of Mde de Staël and grandson of M. Necker, and will see an example, in the peaceable reunion here of so many discordant worthies of his own country, how much more happy the tolerant principles of his great ancestor might have made  
			 them at home.
