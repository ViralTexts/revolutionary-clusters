-York.  
THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may in a particular manner be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties. ’Tis time only that can mature and perfect so compound a system, can liquidate the meaning of all the parts, and can adjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistent WHOLE.

 judiciary department. The principal of these respect the situation of the state courts in regard to those causes, which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction. Is this to be exclusive, or are those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction? If the latter, in what relation will they stand to the national tribunals? These are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense, and which are certainly intitled to attention.  
The principles established in a former paper  
  
Vol. I, No. XXXII.  
  
teach us, that the states will retain all pre-existing authorities, which may not be exclusively delegated to the federal head; and that this exclusive delegation can only exist in one of three cases; where an exclusive authority is in express terms granted to the union; or where a particular authority is granted to the union, and the exercise of a like authority is prohibited to the states, or where an authority is granted to the union with which a similar authority in the states would be utterly incompatible. Though these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power; yet I am inclined to think that they are in the main just with respect to the former as well as the latter. And under this impression I shall lay it down as a rule that the state courts will retain the jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes.  
The only thing in the proposed constitution, which wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts is contained in this passage—“The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.” This might either be construed to signify, that the supreme and subordinate courts of the union should alone have the power of deciding those causes, to which their authority is to extend; or simply to denote that the organs of the national judiciary should be one supreme court and as many subordinate courts as congress should think proper to appoint, or in other words, that the United States should exercise the judicial power with which they are to be invested through one supreme tribunal and a certain number of inferior ones to be instituted by them. The first excludes, the last admits the concurrent jurisdiction of the state tribunals: And as the first would amount to an alienation of state power by implication, the last appears to me the most natural and the most defensible construction.  
But this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly applicable to those descriptions of causes of which the state courts have previous cognizance. It is not equally evident in relation to cases which may grow out of, and be peculiar to the constitution to be established: For not to allow the state courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases can hardly be considered as the abridgement of a pre-existing authority. I mean not therefore to contend that the United States in the course of legislation upon the objects entrusted to their direction may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal courts solely, if such a measure should be deemed expedient; but I hold that the state courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I am even of opinion, that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature, they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth. This I infer from the nature of judiciary power, and from the general genius of the system. The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe. Those of Japan not less than of New-York may furnish the objects of legal discussion to our courts. When in addition to this, we consider the state governments and the national governments as they truly are, in the light of kindred systems and as parts of ONE WHOLE, the inference seems to be conclusive that the state courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the union, where it was not expressly prohibited.  
Here another question occurs—what relation would subsist between the national and state courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction? I answer that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter to the supreme court of the United States. The constitution in direct terms, gives an appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance, in which it is not to have an original one; without a single expression to confine its operation to the inferior federal courts. The objects of appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. From this circumstance and from the reason of the thing it ought to be construed to extend to the state tribunals. Either this must be the case, or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national concern, else the judiciary authority of the union may be eluded at the pleasure of every plantiff or prosecutor. Neither of these consequences ought without evident necessity to be involved; the latter would be intirely inadmissible, as it would defeat some of the most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government, and would essentially embarrass its measures. Nor do I perceive any foundation for such a supposition. Agreeably to the remark already made, the national and state systems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE. The courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the union, and an appearl from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal, which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of national decisions. The evident aim of the plan of the convention is that all the causes of the specified classes, shall for weighty public reasons receive their original or final determination in the courts of the union. To confine therefore the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court to appeals from the subordinate federal courts, instead of allowing their extension to the state courts, would be to abridge the latitude of the terms, in subversion of the intent, contrary to every sound rule of interpretation.  
But could an appeal be made to lie from the state courts to the subordinate federal judicatories? This is another of the questions which have been raised, and of greater difficulty than the former. The following considerations countenance the affirmative. The plan of the convention in the first place authorises the national legislature “to constitute

rts. The only outlines described for them are that they shall be “inferior to the supreme court” and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal judiciary. Whether their authority shall be original or appellate or both is not declared. All this seems to be left to the discretion of the legislature. And this being the case, I perceive at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the state courts to the subordinate national tribunals; and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined. It would diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal courts, and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court. The state tribunals may then be left with a more entire charge of federal causes; and appeals in most cases in which they may be deemed proper instead of being carried to the supreme court, may be made to lie from the state courts to district courts of the union.

the dispute are relative to the laws of the must distant part of the

So far as it applies to cases strictly civil, the doctrine of the  
Federalist is correct. But I can not agree, that the judical pow-  
er of any government, can take any cognizance of the criminal or  
penal laws of a foreign government. The revenue laws of every  
country are of this description ; the disabilities created, and pen-  
alties inflicted by them, are in their nature local. Upon this sub-  
ject, lord Mansfield lays down the rule in broad terms :—“ No

what relation would subsist between the national and  
State Courts in these instances of concurrent juris-

lie from the latter, to the Supreme Court of the  
United States. ‘The constitution in direct terms  
gives an appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court  
in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in  
which it is not to have an original one, without a

the tribunals from which it is to be made, are alone  
contemplated. From this circumstance, and from  
the reason of the thing, it ought to be construed to  
extend to the State tribunals. Either this must be  
the case, or the local Courts must be excluded from  
a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national con-  
cern, else the judicial authority of the Union may  
be eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prose-  
cutor. Neither of these consequences ought, with-  
out evident necessity, to be involved ; the latter  
would be entirely inadmissible, as it would defeat  
some of the most important and avowed purposes of

which is now considered a text book in regard to

authorized to exercise jurisdiction. In the first class, the ex-  
pression is, that the judicial power shall extend to all cases ;  
but, in the subsequent part of the section, the word “aii” is  
dropped, seemingly by ex industria. ‘ From this difference of  
phraseology, perhaps a difference of constitutional intention may,  
with propriety, be inferred. It is hardly to be presumed, that th

federal cognizance in which it is not to have an original one, without  
a single expression to confine its operation to the inferior Federal  
Courts. The objects of appeal, not the trzbunal/s from which it is to  
be made, are alone contemplated. From this circumstance, and from  
the reason of the thing, it ought to be construed to extend to the State  
tribunals. Either this must be the case, or the local Courts must be  
excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national concern;  
else the judicial authority of the Union may be eluded at the pleasure  
of every plaintiff or prosecutor. Neither of these consequences ought,  
without evident necessity, to be involved. The latter would be en-  
tirely inadmissible, as it would defeat some of the most important and  
avowed purposes of the proposed government, and would essentially  
embarrass its measures. Nor do I perceive any foundation for such a  
supposition. Agreeably to the remark already made, the National  
and State systems are to be regarded as one whole, The Courts of  
the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the  
laws of the Union, and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to  
that tribunal, which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles  
of natural justice and the rules of national decision. The evident aim  
of the plan of the National Convention is, that all the causes of the  
specified classes shall, for weighty public reasons, receive their original  
or final determination in the Courts of the Union. To confine, there-  
fore, the general expressions, which give appellate jurisdiction to the  
Supreme Court, to appeals from the subordinate Federal Courts, in-  
stead of allowing their extension to the State Courts, would be to  
abridge the latitude of the terms in subversion of the intent, contrary  
to every sound rule of interpretation.’  
  
A contemporaneous exposition of the Constitution, certainly of not  
less authority than that which has been just cited, is the judiciary act  
itself. We know that in the Congress which passed this act, were  
many eminent members of the Convention which formed the Constitu-  
tion. Not a single individual, so far as is known, supposed that part  
of the act, which gives the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over  
the judgments of the State Courts in the cases therein specified, to be  
unauthorized by the Constitution.

IN THE SUPREME COURT.  
  
  
  
In the matter of Bryan.  
  
  
  
member of the convention which fotmed the constitution of  
the. General Government, and one. of. its ablest. expounders,  
declared in the 82d No.of the Federalist, p-877:&gt; “That the  
States will retain all pre-ewistent authorities, which may not  
be exclusively delegated to the Federal head; and that this  
exclusive delegation can only exist in one. of three cases:  
where an exclusive authority is, in express terms, granted to the  
Union ; or where a particular authority is granted to the Union,  
and ‘the exercise of a like authority is probibited to the States ;  
or where an authority is granted to the Union, with which a  
similar authority in the States would be utterly incompatible.  
Though these principles may not apply with the same force  
  
to the judiciary as to the legislative power, yet I am inclined ©  
  
to think that they are, in the main, just with respect to the  
former as well as with the latter. And, under this impres-  
sion, I shall lay it down as a rule, that the State courts will  
retain the jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to be  
taken away in one of the: enumerated modes.’ Chancello

Mr. Hamilton, in the 82d number of the Federalist, speak-  
ing of the relation that would subsist between the National  
and State courts in the instances of concurrent jurisdiction,  
observes that the Constitution, in direct terms, gives an ap-

an original one, without a single expression to confine its

appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made, are  
alone contemplated. From this circumstance, he observes,  
and from the reason of the thing, it ought to be construed to  
extend to the State tribunals. “The courts of the latter will,  
of course, be National auxiliaries to the execution of the laws  
of the Union, and an.appeal from them will as naturally lie to  
that tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the  
principles of National justice and the rules of National de-  
cisions.”  
  
This idea of ealling to the aid of the Federal judiciary the  
State tribunals, by leaving to them concurrent jurisdiction  
in which Federal questions might be involved, with the right  
of appeal to the Supreme Court, will be found to be exten-  
sively acted upon in the distribution of the judicial powers  
of the United States in the act of 1789, known as the Judi-  
ciary Act. Besides the general concurrent jurisdiction in  
the Judiciary Act, a striking instance of this is found in th

The judiciary power of every government can look beyond its  
own municipal laws in civil cases, and can take cognizance of all  
subjects of litigation between parties within its territorial limits  
and jurisdiction, though the controversy relate to the laws of a  
foreign country. But as regards crimes the rule is otherwise ; for  
the courts of one state or nation will not hold cognizance of, nor  
enforce the criminal laws of another. And as to crimes made so  
by legislative enactments, the government of the United States  
stands in the same relation to the government of this state as any  
foreign power. Mr. Justice Story, in giving the opinion of the  
supreme court, in Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304, said: ‘‘ No

give the Federal courts sole jurisdiction. “I hold,” says he,  
“ that the State courts will be divested of no part of their prim-

am even of opinion, that in every case in which they were not  
expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature,  
they will, of course, take cognizance of the causes to which

The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own  
local or municipal laws, and, in civil cases, lays hold of all sub-

the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant

courts would have concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising

The i Federalist, No. 82, is put  
as a note to that section as follows :  
The Federalist, No. 82, has spoken of  
the right of Congress to vest appellate ju­  
risdiction in the inferior courts of the  
United States from State courts,(for it had  
before expressly affirmed that , of the Su  
preme Uourt m such cases) In the follow  
ing terms : But could an appeal be made  
to lie from the State courts to the subor  
dinate Federal jurisdiction ? k This is an­  
other of the questions which have been  
raised, and of greater difficulty than the for  
mer. The following considerations counte  
nance the affirmative, and then after enu-  
murdtinor tfiA vtnoisloraHrma TvnvuwHa  
Whether their authority shall be original,  
or appellate, or both, is not declared. All  
this seems to be left to the discretion of the  
Legislature. &#x27; And this being the case, I  
see no impediment to the establishment of  
an appeal from the State Courts to the  
subordinate national tribunal, and many  
advantages attending the power of doing it  
may be imagined. &#x27;- It would dimmish the  
motives to the multiplication of Federal  
Courts, and would admit of arrangements  
calculated to contract the appellate juris  
diction of the Supreme Court. The btate  
tribunals may then beleft with a more entire  
charge of Federal causes; and appeals, in  
most cases in which they may De deemed  
proper, instead of being carried to the Su-  
Ereme Court, may be made to lie from the  
tate Courts to District Courts of th

s to which the judicial  
power of the United States was extended ?  
  
These questions were the subject of earnest consideration  
while the Constitution was before the people of the United  
States for acceptance or rejection. It was contended by some  
who recommended its rejection that the proposed Constitution,  
without legislation by Congress, would give to the one Supreme  
Court established by it, and to such other courts as Congress  
should from time to time create, exclusive jurisdiction in all  
such cases or controversies. That interpretation was disputed,  
and Hamilton in the Federalist said : “The principles estab-  
lished in a former paper teach us that the State will retain all  
preéxisting authorities, which may not be exclusively delegated

to the Federal head ; and that this exclusive delegation can only  
exist in one of three cases ; where an exclusive authority is, in  
express terms, granted to the Union; or where a particular  
authority is granted to the Union, and the exercise of a like  
authority is prohibited to the States; or, where an authority  
is granted to the Union, with which a similar authority in  
the States would be utterly incompatible. Though these prin-  
ciples may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as  
to the legislative power, yet I am inclined to think that they  
are, in the main, just with respect to the former, as well as  
the latter. And under this impression I shall lay it down as  
a rule that the state courts will retain the jurisdiction they  
now have, unless it appears to be taken away in one of the  
enumerated modes.” He recognized the fact that there was  
apparent support to the objection referred to in the clause “ the  
judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Su-  
preme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress shall  
from time to time ordain and establish.” That clause, he said,  
“might either be construed to signify that the supreme and  
subordinate courts of the Union should alone have the power  
of deciding those causes, to which their authority is to extend ;  
or simply to denote that the organs of the national judiciary  
should be one Supreme Court, and as many subordinate courts  
as Congress should think proper to appoint; in other words,  
that the United States should exercise the judicial power  
with which they are to be invested, through one supreme  
tribunal, and a certain number of inferior ones, to be insti-  
tuted by them. The first excludes, the last admits, the con-  
current jurisdiction of the state tribunals. And as the first  
would amount to an alienation of state power by implication,  
the last appears to me the most defensible construction.” He  
also said that the judicial power of every government “looks  
beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in civil cases lays  
hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its  
jurisdiction, though the causes of dispute are relative to the  
laws of the most distant part of the globe. Those of Japan,  
not less than of New York, may furnish the objects of legal  
discussion to our courts. When in addition to this we con

sider the state governments and the national government as  
they truly are, in the light of kindred systems and as parts of  
one whole, the inference seems to be conclusive that the state  
courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in cases arising  
under the laws of the Union, where it was not expressly  
prohibited.” Federalist, No. 82.  
  
The first Congress acted upon this view of the scope and  
effect of the Constitution when it passed the Judiciary Act of  
September 24, 1789, c. 20, creating the Circuit and District  
Courts of the United States and defining their jurisdiction.  
1 Stat. 73. By that act it was declared that the District  
Courts should have “exclusively of the courts of the several  
States” cognizance of specified crimes and of certain named  
civil causes or suits, and cognizance “concurrent with th
