Dear Sir,   
Washington. Jan. 6. 1805  
  
Your favor of Dec. 26. has been duly recieved, and was recieved as a proof of your friendly partialities to me of which I have so often had reason to be sensible. my opinion originally was that the President of the US. should have been elected for 7. years, &amp; for ever ineligible afterwards. I have since become sensible that 7. years is too long to be unremoveable, and that there should be a peaceable way of withdrawing a man in midway who is doing wrong. the service for 8. years with a power to remove at the end of the first four, comes nearly to my principle as corrected by experiences and it is in adherence to that that I determine to withdraw at the end of my second term. the danger is that the indulgence &amp; attachments of the people will keep a man in the chair after he becomes a dotard, that reelection through life shall become habitual, &amp; election for life follow that. Genl. Washington set the example of voluntary retirement after 8. years. I shall follow it. and a few more precedents will oppose the obstacle of habit to any one after a while who shall endeavor to extend his term. perhaps it may beget a disposition to establish it by an amendment of the constitution. I believe I am doing right therefore in pursuing my principle. I had determined to declare my intention but I have consented to be silent on the opinion of friends, who think it best not to put a continuance out of my power in defiance of all circumstances. there is however but one circumstance which could engage my acquiescence in another election, to wit, such a division about a successor as might bring in a Monarchist. but this circumstance is impossible. while therefore I shall make no formal declarations to the public of my purpose, I have freely let it be understood in private conversation. in this I am persuaded yourself &amp; my friends generally will approve of my views: and should I at the end of a 2d term carry into retirement all the favor which the 1st. has acquired, I shall feel the consolation of having done all the good in my power, and expect with more than composure the termination of a life no longer valuable to others or of importance to myself. accept my affectionate salutations &amp; assurances of great esteem &amp; respect

WASHINGTON, Jan. 3, 1805.  
DEAR SIR: Your favor of Dec. 26 has been duly re  
ceived, as a proof of your friendly partialities to me, of  
which I have so often had reason to be sensible. My  
opinion originally was that the President of the United  
states shoul d have been elected for seven years, and  
forever ineligible afterward. I have since become sensi-  
ble that seven years is too long to be irremovable, and  
that there should be a peaceable way of withdrawing a  
man in midway who is doing wrong. The service for  
eight years, with a power to remove at the end of the  
first four, comes nearly to my principle as corrected by  
experience; and it is in adherence to that, that I deter­  
mine to withdraw at the end of my second term. The  
danger is that the indulgence and attachments of the  
people will keep a man an the chair after he becomes a  
dotard, that reélection through life shall become habit-  
ual, and election for life follow that. Gena Washington  
set the example of voluntary retirement after eight  
years. I shall follow it. And a few more precedent.­  
will oppose the obstacle of habit to any one  
after a while who shall endeavor to extend his  
term. Perhaps it may beget a disposition to establish it  
by an amendment of the Constitution. I believe I am  
doing right therefore in pursuing my principle. I had  
determined to declare my intention, but I have consented  
to be silent on the opinion of friends, who think it best  
not to put a continuance out of my power in deflance of  
all circumstances. There is, however, but one circum  
stance which could engage my acqulescence in another  
election, to wit, such a division about a successor as  
might bring in a monarchist. But that ciroumstance is  
impossible. While, therefore, I shall make no formal dec.­  
laration to the public of my purpose, I have freely let it  
be understood in private conversation. In this I am  
persuaded yourself and ufy friends generally will ap-­  
prove of my views. And should I, at the end of a second  
ferm, carry into retirement all the favor which the first  
has acquired, I shall feel the consolation of having done  
all the good in my power, and expect with more than  
composure the termination of a life no longer valuable  
to others or of importance to myself. Accept my affect  
ionate salutations, and assurances of great esteem and  
respect

ment.  
In letter to Colonel John Taylor, dated  
January 6, 1805, just after he had been  
the second time elected and before he  
had been the second time inaugurated,  
Mr. Jefferson used the following langu­

and attachments of the people will keep  
a man in the chair after he has become  
a dotard, that re-eleetion through life

set the example of voluntary retirement  
after eight years. I shall follow it. And  
a few more precedents will oppose the  
obstacle of habit to any one after a while  
who shall endeavor to extend his term.  
Perhaps it may beget a disposition to es­

right, therefore, in pursuing my prin­
