Phyladelphia Septr. 16. 1774  
  
Having a Leisure Moment, while the Congress is assembling, I gladly embrace it to write you a Line.  
When the Congress first met, Mr. Cushing made a Motion, that it should be opened with Prayer. It was opposed by Mr. Jay of N. York and Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina, because we were so divided in religious Sentiments, some Episcopalians, some Quakers, some Aanabaptists, some Presbyterians and some Congregationalists, so that We could not join in the same Act of Worship.—Mr. S. Adams arose and said he was no Bigot, and could hear a Prayer from a Gentleman of Piety and Virtue, who was at the same Time a Friend to his Country. He was a Stranger in Phyladelphia, but had heard that Mr. Duchè (Dushay they pronounce it) deserved that Character, and therefore he moved that Mr. Duchè, an episcopal Clergyman, might be desired, to read Prayers to the Congress, tomorrow Morning. The Motion was seconded and passed in the Affirmative. Mr. Randolph our President, waited on Mr. Duchè, and received for Answer that if his Health would permit, he certainly would. Accordingly next Morning he  
appeared with his Clerk and in his Pontificallibus, and read several Prayers, in the established Form; and then read the Collect for the seventh day of September, which was the Thirty fifth Psalm.—You must remember this was the next Morning after we heard the horrible Rumour, of the Cannonade of Boston.—I never saw a greater Effect upon an Audience. It seemed as if Heaven had ordained that Psalm to be read on that Morning.  
After this Mr. Duche, unexpected to every Body struck out into an extemporary Prayer, which filled the Bosom of every Man present. I must confess I never heard a better Prayer or one, so well pronounced. Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself never prayed with such fervour, such Ardor, such Earnestness and Pathos, and in Language so elegant and sublime—for America, for the Congress, for The Province of Massachusetts Bay, and especially the Town of Boston. It has had an excellent Effect upon every Body here.  
I must beg you to read that Psalm. If there was any Faith in the sortes Virgilianae, or sortes Homericae, or especially the Sortes biblicae, it would be thought providential.  
It will amuse your Friends to read this Letter and the 35th. Psalm to them. Read it to your Father and Mr. Wibirt.—I wonder what our Braintree Churchmen would think of this?—Mr. Duchè is one of the most ingenious Men, and best Characters, and greatest orators in the Episcopal order, upon this Continent—Yet a Zealous Friend of Liberty and his Country.  
I long to see my dear Family. God bless, preserve and prosper it. Adieu.  
  
John Adams

was seconded and pasted in the affirmative. Ar  
sandolph, our President, waited on Mr Duche, and  
received for answer, that if his health would permit  
he certainly would. Accordingly, next morning he  
appeared with his clerk, and in his pontificials, and  
rend several prayers in the established fi rmn, and  
then read the collects for the seventh day of Sep  
tember, which was the thirty fifth psalm. You

had heard the rumor of the herrible cantionide of  
Boston. It seemed as if heaven had ordained that  
psalm to be read on that morning.  
&quot;After this Mr Duche, very unexpectedly toe  
ery ody, struck out into an extemporary prayer  
which filled the bosom of every man present. I  
must confess I never heard a better prnyer in all my  
life, or une so well pronounced. Episcopatian as  
he is, Dr Cooper himself never prayed with such  
fervor, such ardor, such correciness and pathos, and  
in language so eloquent and sublime, for America,  
for Coogress, for the province of the Massachusetts  
Bay, especially the town of Boston. It has had an  
extellent effect upon every bedy here. I musd beg  
you to read that psalm. If there is any faith in the  
sottes Homerics, or sortes Virgilian a or especially  
sortes Biblicae, it would be thought very providen  
The 35th psalm was indeed appropriate to the  
news received and the exigencies of the times. It

‘© When the Congress met, Mr. Cush-

opened with prayer. It was opposed by  
Mr. Jay, of New York, and Mr. Rut-

were so divided in religious sentiments,  
some Episcopalians, some Quakers,some  
Anabaptists, some Presbyterians, and  
some Congregationalists, that we could  
not join in the same act of worship.  
Mr. Samuel Adams arose and said ¢ that  
he was no bigot, and could hear a  
prayer from any gentleman of piety and  
virtue, who was at the same time a friend  
to his country. He was a stranger in  
Philadelphia, but had heard that Mr.  
Duche, (Dushay they pronounced it) de-  
served that character, and therefore he  
moved that Mr. Duche, an Episcopal  
clergyman, might be desired to read  
prayers to the Congress to-morrow  
morning.’ The motion was seconded,  
and passed in the affirmative. Mr.  
Randolph, our President, waited on Mr.  
  
his health would permit he certainly  
would. Accordingly, next morning he  
appeared with his cloak, and in his  
pontificals, and read several prayers in  
the established form, and then read the  
collect for the seventh day of September,  
which was the 35th Psalm. You must  
remember this was the next morning

When the Congresfntt, Mr. Cushin  
made a motion that it should be opened with  
prayer. It was opposed by Mr. Jay of New  
York, and Mr. Kutledgeof South Carolina  
because, we were so divide in religious  
sentiments some Episcopalians,&quot; some  
Quakers, some Anabaptists, some Presbyte  
rians and some Congregationalists that we  
could not join in the same act of worship  
Mr. Samuel Adams arose and said that he  
was no bigot, and could hear a prayer from  
any gentleman of piety and virtue, who was  
at the same time amend to his country-  
He was a stranger in Philadelphia, but had  
nearu .mat iir. uucne uusnay iney pro

fore he moved that Mr. Duche, an Episcopal  
clergyman might be desired to read prayers  
to Congress to-morrow morning. 1 he mo

ative. Mr. Randolph, our President, waited  
on Mr. I)., and received for answer, that if  
his health would permit, he certainly would  
comply. According n ext morning, he ap­  
peared with his clerk, and in his pontificals,  
read several prayers jn the established form  
and then read the collect for the seventh day  
of September, which was the 35th psalm.  
You must remember this was the next mor­

Heaven had ordained that psalm to be read  
on that morning!  
After this Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to ev­  
ery body, struck out into an extemporary  
prayer, which filled the bosom of every man  
present. I must confess I never heard a  
better prayer, or one so well pronounced.  
Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself  
never prayed with such fervor, such ardor,

cause. Mr. A. thus writesto a friend at the  
time:  
“ When the Congress met, Mr. Cushing  
made a motion that it should be opened with  
prayer. It was opposed by Mr. Joy, of New  
York, and Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina,  
because we were so divided11 in religiods  
sentiments, some Episcopalians, some Qua­  
kers, some Anabaptists, some Presbyterians,  
and some Congregationalists, that wc could  
not join in the same act of worship. Mr.  
Samuel Adams arose and said ‘ that he was  
no bigot, and could hear a prayer from an v  
gentleman of piety and virtue, who was at  
the same titne a friend to his country. He  
was a stranger in Philadelphia, but had  
heard that Mr. Duche, (Ducaay they pro­  
nounced it) deserved that character, and  
therefore he moved that Mr. Ruche, an  
Episcopal clergyman, might be desired to  
read prayers to the Congress to-morrow  
morning.’ The motion was seconded, and  
passed in the affirmative. Mr- Randolph,  
our President waited on Mr. Duche, and re­  
ceivcd for answer, that if hia health would  
permit he certainly would. Accordingly,  
next morning he appeared with his cloak,  
and in hi9 pontificals, and read several  
prayers in the established form, and then  
read the collect for the 7th day of Septem­  
her, which was the 35th Psalm. Yop must  
remember this was the next morning after  
wc had heard the rumor of the horrible can­  
nonade at Bostoq. It seemed as if heaven had  
ordained that Psalm to be read on that morning.  
“Afterthis, Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to  
every body, struck out into an extempora­  
ry prayer, which filled the bosom of every  
man present. I must confess I never heard  
a better prayer, or one so well pronounced.  
Episcopalian as he is. Dr. Gooper hifnself  
never prayed with such fervor, such ardor,  
such correctness and pnthes, and in lan­  
guage so elegant and sublinte, for America,  
for Congress, for the province of the Massa­  
chusetts Bay, especially (he town of Boston.  
It has had an excellent effect upon every  
body here. I must beg you to read that  
Psalm. If there Is any faith in the sortes  
Virgilianae, or sortes Homericae, or espe­  
cially the sorties Biblicae, it would be  
though providential.”  
The 35th Psalm was indeed appropriate  
to the news received and the exigencies of  
the times. It commences:  
“ Plead your cause, O Lord, with them  
that strive with me: fight against them that  
fight against me.  
“ Take hold of shield and buckler and  
stand up for my help.  
“ Draw out also the spear, and stop the  
way against them that prosecute me : say  
unto my soul, I am thy salvation.”

&#x27;no bigot, and could hear a prayer from any gen-  
itleman of piety and virtue, who was at the same  
time a friend to his country. He was a stranger  
in Philadelphia, but had heard that Mr. Duche,  
(Dushay they pronounced it,) deserved that char-  
acter, and therefore he moved that Mr. Duche, an  
Episcopal clergyman, might be desired to read  
prayers before the Congress, 1o-morrow morning.’  
The motion was seconded, and passed in the  
affirmative. Mr. Randolph, our President, waited  
on Mr. Duche, and received for answer, that if  
his health would permit, ae certainly would. Ac-  
cordingly, next morning, he appeared with his  
clerk, and in pontificals, and read several prayers,  
‘in the established form, and then read the Psalter  
for the seventh day of September, a part of which  
was the 35th Psalm. You must remember this  
was the next morning after we had heard the ru-  
mor of the horrible cannonade of Roston, It  
seemed as if heaven had ordained that Psalm to  
be read on that morning.  
  
“ After this, Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to every  
body, struck out into an extemporary prayer,  
which filled the bosom of every man present.  
must confess, I never heard a better prayer, or  
one so well pronounced, Episcopalian as he is,  
Dr, Cooper himself never prayed with such fervor,  
-|such ardor, such correctness and pathos, and in  
language so elegant and sublime, for Congress,  
for the Province of the Massachusetts Bay,  
especially the town of Boston. It had an excel-  
lent effect upon every body here. I must beg you  
to read that Psalm. If there is any faith in the  
Sortes Virgilianz, or Sortes Homerice, or espec-  
ially the Sortes Biblice, it would be thought prov-

gentleman of piety and virtue, who was at

was a stranger in Philadelphia, but had  
heard that Mr Duche, (Dushay, they pro­  
nounced X.) deserved that character, and  
therefore he moved that Mr Duche, an  
  
Episcopal clergyman, might be desired to  
read prayers to Congress to-morrow morn­  
ing.1&#x27; The motion was seconded, and pas­  
sed in the affirmative. Mr Randolph, our  
President, waited on MrD. and received  
for answer that if his health would permit,  
he certainly would. Accordingly, next  
morning, he appeared with his clerk, and  
his pontificials, and read several prayers  
in the established form, and then read the  
psalter for the 7th day of September, which  
was the 35th psalm. You must remember  
this was the next morning after we had  
  
heard of the terrible cannonade of Boston.  
It seemed as if heaven had ordained that  
psalm to be read on that morning.  
After this Mr Duche, unexpectedly to  
everybody, struck out into extemporary  
prayer, which filled the bosom of every one  
present. I must confess I never heard a  
better prayer, or one so well pronounced.  
  
Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself  
  
never prayed with such fervor, such ardor,  
  
such correctness and pathos, and in lan­  
guage so elegant and sublime for America,  
for Congress, for the province of the Mas­  
sachusetts Bay, especially for the town of  
Boston. It had excellent effect upon ev­  
ery body here; I must beg you to read the  
psalm. If there is any faith in the sortes  
  
Virgilianas, or llomericae, or especially  
the sortes Biblicae, it would have been  
thought providential.

FIRST CONGRESS, IN PHILADELPHIA.  
(From the pen of the venerable John Adams.)  
When the Congress met, Mr. Cushing  
made a motion that it should be opened  
with prayer. It was opposed by Mr. Jay,  
of New York, and .Mr. Rutledge, of South  
Carolina, because we were so divided in re­  
ligious sentiments,some Episcopalians,some  
Quakers, some Anabaptists, some Presbyte­  
rians, and some Congregationalists, that we  
could not join in the same act of worship.  
Mr. Samuel Adams arose and said, “that he  
was no bigot, and could hear a prayer from  
any gentleman of piety and virtue who was  
at the same time a friend of his country.—  
; He was a stranger in Philadelphia, but had  
hoard that Mr. Duchc, (Dushay, they pro­  
nounced it.) deserved that character, and  
therefore, he moved that Mr. Duche, an E­  
piscopal clergyman, might be desired to read  
‘prayers to Congress to-morfow morning.1  
[The motion was seconded, and passed in  
j the affirmative. Mr. Randolph, our Prcsi­  
! dent, waited on Mr. D., and received for an­  
; swer, that if his health would permit, he  
I certainly would. Accordingly, next morn­  
j iug, he appeared with his clerk, and his pon­  
j tilicals, and read several prayers in the estab­  
lished form, and then read the psalter for the  
j seventh day of September, which was the  
i 34th psalm. You must remember this was  
i the next morning after we had heard the ru­  
| mor of the horrible cannonade of Boston.  
|‘-It seemed as though heaven had ordained  
j that psalm to be read on that morning.”  
After this, Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to  
every body, struck out into an extemporary  
prayer, which tilled the bosom of every man |  
present. I must confess I never heard a j  
belter prayer or one so well pronounced.!  
Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself  
never prayed with such fervor, such ardor, I  
such correctness and pathos,and in language )  
so elegant and sublime for America, for Con-:  
gross, for the province of the Massachusetts  
Bay, especially the town of Boston. Jihad  
excellent effect upon every body here. I  
must hid you to read the psalm. Jf there is j  
any faith in the sort Virgilianic, or Homeri­  
acao, or especially the sorts Bibliccc, it would  
have been thought providential.

the time :  
  
“When the Congress met, Mr. Cushing made 2  
motion that it should be opened with prayer. It  
was opposed by Mr. Jay of New York, and Mr.  
Rutledge of South Carolina, because we were so  
divided in religious sentiment, some Episcopalians,  
some Quakers, some Anabaptists, some Presbyter­  
ians, and some Congregationalists—that we could  
not join in the same act of worship. Mr. Samucl  
Adams rose and said, ‘that he was no bigot, and  
could hear a prayer from any gentleman of virtue  
and piety, who was at the same time a friend of his  
country. He was a stranger in Philadelphia, but  
had heard that Mr. Duche (Dushay they pronoun­  
ced it) deserved that character, and therefore he  
moved that Mr. Duche, an Episcopal clergyman,  
might be desired to read prayers before the Con­  
gress, to-morrow morning’” The motion was sce­  
onded, and passed in the affirmative. Mr. Ran­  
dolph, our President, waited on Mr. Duche, and  
received for answer, that if bis health would per­  
mit, he certainly would. Accordingly, next morn­  
ing, he appeared with his clerk, and in pontificals,  
and read several prayers in the established form,  
and then read the Psalter, for the seventh day of  
September, a part of which was the 35th Psalin.—  
You must remember this was the next morning af­  
ter we had heard the rumor of the horrible cannon­  
ade of Boston. It seemed as if Heaven had or­  
dained that Psalm to be read on that morning.  
After this, Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to every

which filled the bosom of every man present. 1  
must confess, I never heard a better prayer, or one  
so well pronounced. Episcopalian as he is, Dr.  
Cooper himself never prayed with such fervor,

language so elegant and sublime, for Congress, for

&quot; Whon Congress mot, Mr. Cushing  
made a motion that it should be opened  
with prayer. It was opposed by Mr.  
Jay, of Now York, and Mr. Rutledgo,  
of South Carolina, because we were so  
divided in religious sentiment?some  
Episcopalians, some Quakers, some  
Anabaptists, some Presbyterians, and  
some Congregationalists?that we could  
not join in the same act of worship.?  
Mr. Sumuel Adams arose and said, that  
he was no bigot, and could hoar a pray­  
er from ony gentloman of pioty, aud  
virtue, who was,&#x27;at the sume time, a  
friend to his country. He was a stran­  
ger in Philadelphia, but hud hoard that  
Mr. Dutchie (Duchay, they pronounced  
it,) desorved that character; and, there­  
fore, he moved that Mr. Dutchie, an  
Episcopalian clergyman, might be de­  
sired to read prayers to Congress to­  
morrow morning. Tho motion was se­  
conded, and passed in tho affirmative.?  
Mr. Randolph, our President, wgited  
on Mr. Dutchie, and received for an­  
swer, that if his hoalth would permit,  
he certainly would. Accordingly, next  
morning, he appeared with his clerk,  
and in his pontificals, and read several  
prayers in the established form, and  
then read the Psalter for the seventh  
day of September, which was the 35th  
Psalm., You must remember that this  
was the next morning affer we had heard  
of the horrible cannonade-of Boston.?  
It soemed as if hoaven had ordained  
that Psalm to bo read on that morning.  
&quot; After this, Mr. Dutchio, unexpect­  
edly to every body, struck out into ex­  
tomporary prayer, which filled tho bo­  
som of every man present. I must con­  
fess I never heard a better prayer, or  
one so well pronounced. Episcopali­  
an as he is, Dr. Cooper himself never  
prayed with such fervor, such ardor,  
such correctness and pathos, and in lan­  
guage so eloqueut and sublime, for  
America, for Congress, for tho Province  
of Massachusetts Bay, and especially  
tho town of Boston. It had au excel­  
lent effect on every body here. I must  
beg of you to read the Psalm. If there  
is any faith in tho Sortes Virgiliame, or  
Homericte, or especially the Sortes Bib­  
[ licie, it would have boon thought prov­  
idential.&quot;

When the Congress met, Mr. Cushing

of New York, and Mr. Rutledge, of South

Presbyterians, and some Congregationalists

said that he was no bigot, and could hear  
a prayer from any gentleman of piety and

Randolph, our President, waited on Mr.  
D., and received for answer that if his  
health would permit he certainly would.  
Accordingly, next morning he appeared  
with his clerk and in his pontificals, and  
read several prayers in the established  
form, and then read the Psalter for the

never prayed with such fervor, such ardor,

W hen the Congress first met, Mr.

be opened with prayer. It was oppo­  
sed bv Mr. Jay, of New York, and Mr.  
Rutlede. of South Carolina, because  
we were so divided in religious senti  
ment some EDiscopalLins, some Qua  
kers, some Anabaptists, some Presby­  
terians, and some Congregationalista  
that we could not join in the same act  
of worship. Mr. Samu-1 Adams said  
he was no bigot, and could bear a pray­  
er from a geutieinuu of piety and vir­  
tue, who was at the same time a friend  
to his country, lie was a stranger in  
Philadelphia, but had heard that Mr.  
Duche (Dushay,they pronounce it), de­  
served that character, and therefore  
he moved that Mr. Duche, an Episco  
oal clergymen, might be desired to  
read prayers to the Congressto-morrow  
morning. The motion was sec­  
onded, and passed in the affirmative.  
Mr.Bandolph.our President, waited on

You mnst remember this was the

ble rumor ol the cannonade of Boston.  
I never saw a greater effect upon an  
audience. It veemed as if Heaven bad  
ordained that Psalm to be read on that

After this, Mr. Duche, unexpected to  
everybody, struck out into an extem­  
porary prayer, which filled the bosom  
of every man present. 1 must confess  
I never heard a better prayer, or one  
so well pronounced. Episcopalian as  
he (M. Duche) is, Dr. Cooper himseli  
never prayed with such lervor, such  
ardor, such earnestness and pathos, and  
in language so elegant and sublime  
for America, for the Congress, for the  
Province of Massachusetts Bay, and es­  
pecially the town of Bostou. It had

TUG FIRST PRAYER IN CONGRESS.  
  
The Illustrated Christian Weekly gives  
the following description of the first  
prayer in CoDgress, from a private letter  
of Mr. John Adams. It showa, says  
that paper, how a hundred years ago the  
same objections were made that are re­  
peated now, to any recognition of Chris­  
tianity, for fear of sectarianism, and how  
it was met and overcome. Would that  
Mr. Adams could come back from the  
dead to teach us some lessons of com­  
bined Christian faith and catholicity  
now.  
  
PHILADELPHIA, September 16. 1774.  
When the Congress first met, Mr.  
Cashing made a motion that it should  
he opened with prayer. It was opposed  
by Mr. Jay of New York, and Mr. Rut­  
ledge of South Carolina, because we  
were so divided in religious sentiments,  
some Episcopalians, some Quakers, some  
Anabaptists, some Presbyterians, and  
some Congregationalists, that we could  
not join in the same act of Worship.  
Mr. Samuel Adams arose and said he  
was no bigot, and could hear a prayer  
from a gentleman of piety and virtue,  
who was at the same time a friend to  
his country. He was a stranger in Phil­  
adelphia, but had heard that Mr. Duche  
(Dushay they pronounced it) deserved  
that character, and therefore he moved  
that Mr. Duche, an Episcopal clergy­  
man, might be desired to read prayeis  
to the Congress tomorrow morning.  
The motion was seconded, and passed  
in the affirmative. Sir. Randolph, our  
President, waited on Mr. Duche, and  
received for answer that if his liculth  
would permit he certainly would. Ac­  
cordingly, next morning, he appeared  
with his clerk, and in his pontificals,  
and read several prayers in the estab­  
lished form; and then read the Collect  
for the seventh day of September,  
which was the 35th Psalm. You must  
remember this was the next morning  
after we heard the horrible rumor of  
the cannonade of Boston. I never saw  
a greater effect upon an audience. It  
seemed as if heaven had ordained that  
Psalm to be read on that morning.  
After this, Mr. Duche, unexpected to  
everybody, struck out into an extem­  
porary prayer, which filled the bosom  
of ever}&#x27; man present. I must confess I  
never heard a better prayer or . one so  
well pronounced. Episcopalian as he  
is, Dr. Cooper himself never prayed  
with such fervor, such ardor, such  
earnestness and pathos, and in a lan­  
guage so eloquent aud sublime for  
America, for the Congress, for the  
Province of Massachusetts Bay, aud es­  
pecially the town ot Boston. It had  
an excellent effect upon everybody here.  
I must beg you to read that Psalm. If

addressed to his wife shortly after, describes the scene more  
  
minutely : —  
  
When the Congress first met, Mr. Cushing made a motion that it  
should be opened with prayer. It was opposed by Mr. Jay, of New  
York, and Mr. Rutledge, of South Carolina, because we were so di-  
vided in religious sentiments, — some Episcopalians, some Quakers,  
some Anabaptists, some Presbyterians, and some Congregationalists,  
— that we could not join in the same act of worship. Mr. Samuel  
Adams arose and said, “ he was no bigot, and could hear a prayer  
from a gentleman of piety and virtue, who was at the same time a  
friend to his country. He was a stranger in Philadelphia, but had  
heard that Mr. Duché (Dushay, they pronounce it) deserved that char-  
acter, and therefore he moved that Mr. Duché, an Episcopal clergy-  
man, might be desired to read prayers to the Congress to-morrow  
morning.” ‘The motion was seconded and passed in the affirmative.  
Mr. Randolph, our President, waited on Mr. Duché, and received for  
answer that, if his health would permit, he certainly would. Accord-  
ingly, next morning, he appeared with his clerk and in his ponti-  
ficals, and read several prayers in the established form, and then read  
the Collect * for the 7th day of September, which was the Thirty-fifth  
Psalm. You must remember this was the next morning after we heard  
the horrible rumor of the cannonade of Boston. I never sawa greater  
effect upon an audience. It seemed as if Heaven had ordained that  
Psalm to be read on that morning.  
  
After this, Mr. Duché, unexpectedly to everybody, struck out into  
an extemporary prayer, which filled the bosom of every man present.

gress had heard the rumor of the terrible can-
