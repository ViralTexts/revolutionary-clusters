Quincy March 13th 1809  
  
I have received your very civil Letter of the third of this Month with Emotions very similar to those which I felt, many years ago upon the following Occasion.—  
Returning from Holland to Paris in 17784 I was invited to dine with my Wife and Daughter by the Baron De Stael, Ambassador from Sweeden, As I was the first of the Corps Diplomatic who arrived, the Ambassador was shewing me a fine Portrait of the King of Sweeden his Master, when the Count Deodati Ambassador from the Elector of Saxony came in. After Compliments to De Stael Deodati turned to me whom he had known Several years before and the following Dialogue ensued,—  
Deodati. Very well! Mr. Adams! You are a Republican I suppose.  
Adams, You are in the right, Mr. Ambassador, I have the honor to be a Republican.—  
Deodati. And your Countrymen are Republicans, and your Government is Republican.  
Adams. Certainly. My Countrymen are Republicans and our Government is Republican.  
Deodati. And you have made your Countrymen and your Government Republican.  
Adams. Not at all, Sir my Country and its Government have been Republican from their origion, and long before I was born.  
Deodati. Very well! you at least have made your Country very Celebrated you have made it, independent.—You have made an astonishing Treaty with Holland.—you have made a Marvelous Peace with England. you have made her Acknowledge your Independence   
Adams I beg your pardon Sir, you are too polite; you do me too much honor, I have no pretensions to have performed all those great Acts however I have acted a part in Some of those affairs,  
Deodati But! very well!—I will now tell the Recompence you will receive, for all that you have done.—  
Adams I shall be very glad to hear your Prognostications concerning my Destiny.  
Deodati. Your Fortune will be that of all the Injustice, of the A Republicans, of Aristides of Phocion: of Miltiades: of Scipio &amp; &amp;  
Adams, I believe it.  
Deodati You believe it?  
Adams Yes  
Deodati you will experience all the Ingratitude all the Injustice of the ancient Republicans.  
Adams. I expect it: and always have expected it.—  
Deodati. you will be ill treated, hated, despised and persecuted.  
Adams. I have no doubt of all that, It is in the ordinary nature and Course of Things.  
Deodati. Your Virtue must be very heroical, or your Philosophy very Stoical to undertake all those Adventures, with your Eyes open, for such a Reward.—  
So much for Deodati and his warning Voice! and so much for my well grounded Anticipations.—  
This is no fabulous Dialogue of the Dead: but strict historical Truth.  
A curious coalition of French and English Emissaries with Federal and Republican Libellers have so compleatly fulfilled the Prophecy of Deodati and my own—Forebodings, so totally destroyed my Reputation by their Calumnies, that I have neither Power nor Influence to do any Thing for my Country to assist her in her present distresses or guard her against future Calamities. Nothing remains to me but the Right of private Judgment, and that I exercise freely, and communicate my sentiments as freely to those who wish to know them.—  
I am totis Viribus against any division of the Union by the North River or by Delaware River, or by the Potomack or any other River or by any Chain of Mountains, I am for maintaing the Independence of the Nation at all Events—  
I am no Advocate for Mr Gores Declaration of War against France knowing as I do from personal Experience the mutually friendly dispositions between the People of France and the People of America, Bonaparte out of the Question, I shall be very Sorry to see them converted into ill will and old English Prejudice revived, Lasting Injuries and Misfortunes would arise to this country from such a Change.—I am averse also to a War with England, and wish to maintain our Neutrality as long as possible without conceeding important Principles. If either of the belligerent Powers force us all into a War, I am for fighting that Power whichever it may be.—  
I always consider the whole Nation as my Children: but they have almost all been undutiful to me, you two Gentlemen are almost the only ones out of my own house, who have for a long time and I thank you for it expressed a fillial affection for,

So much for Deodati and his warning

This is no fabulous dialogue of the dead :

A curious coalition of French and Eng­

her against future calumnies.  
Nothing rem uns to me hut the right of  
privatejudgment, and that I exercise &#x27;ree­  
1 y, and communicate ray sentiments .»s free.,

I am totis vir-bus, [with my whole  
streng h,] against any division oj the uni.  
on, by tne North-Hiver or by Delaware  
river, or by the P itomac, or any other ri­  
ver, or by any chain of mountains. I ain  
for maintaining h- independence otthe na­  
tion, at all events.  
I am no advocate for iVf~. Gore&#x27;s decln­  
ration of war against F ance.—K aiwii g,  
•is 1 do, from personal &gt; xperienr.e, the mu­  
tually friendly disposition between the peo­  
ple of France and the people of America,  
Bonaparte out of the question, I should be  
! very sorty to see them converted into ill  
w-ll and our old English prejudices revi­  
ved. Lasting injuries amt misfortunes  
would arise to tins country from such a  
change.  
I am averse also to a war with F.ng’and  
and wish to maintain our neutrality as long  
as possible, without conceding important  
principles. If cither of the belligerent pow­  
«*rs force us in*o a war, I mn for fighting  
that power, wh c&#x27;-iever it may be.  
I always co isider the whole nation as my

_ Qlincy, March 15, JSCS?.  
Gcnf/rmen,  
“ 11h:*v&lt;; &#x27;•‘■cefved your civil letter of the 3:1 of this  
month, with emotions very similar to those which I  
felt many yi ai s ago upon the following occasion.  
Returning trim Holland to Paris m 1784,1 was in­  
vited to dine with my wile and daughter, by the b...  
ron de Stael, amb issadnr frofti Sweden. As I was  
the hi st of the corps diplomatic who arrived, the  
ambussadot r was shewing me a fine portrait of the  
king ot Sweden, his master, when the count Deoda­  
ti, ambassador from the elector of Snx..nv, came in.  
A ter compliments to De Stael, Deotl.iti turned to me,  
w.nmi he had known several years before, and the  
following dialogue ensued.  
Dcodati, Very well i Mr. Adams! You arc a re­  
publican I suppose.  
Mums. You are in the right, Mr. Ambassadour,  
I have the honour to be a republican,  
Deudaii. And your countrymen arc republicans,  
and yrur government is republican,  
Adams. Certainly. Mv countrymen are republi­  
cans, and our government is republican.  
Deodar:. And you have made your countrvmen  
and your government republican.  
Adams. Not at all, sir, my country and its go­  
vernment have been republican from their origin,  
ano long before I was born,  
De d::i. Very well ! You at least have made your  
country very celebrated. You h iv* made it inde­  
pendent—You have made an astonishing treaty with  
Holland—You have made a marvellous peace with  
. v , . . ” ••

\ou do me too much honour. I have no pretentions  
to have performed ail those great atchievements.—  
I have acted a part in some of those affairs, but—  
Deodan—But !—Very well !—I will now tell you  
the recompence you will receive for what you have  
done.  
Adams. I shall be very glad to hear your prognos­  
tications concerning my destiny.  
Dcodati. Your fortune will he that of all the re­  
publicans. Of Aristides: of Phocion: of Miltiadest«  
of Scipio, See. Stc. See.  
Adams. ] beiieve it.  
Dcodati. You believe it ?  
Adams. Yes.  
J&gt;^tt. You will experience all the ingratitude,  
all the injustice of the ancient republicans.  
Adams.. Iexpectit; and always have expected it.  
Dcodati. You will be ill-treated, hated, despised  
and persecuted.  
Adams.. I have no doubt of all that. It is in the  
ordinary nature and course of things.  
Dcodati.. Your virtue must be very lieroical,  
or your philosophy very stoical, to undertake all  
these adventures, with your eyes open, for such a  
reward.  
So much for Dcodati and his warning voice: and  
so much for ray well grounded anticipations.  
1 his is no fabulous dialogue of the dead; but strict  
historical truth.  
A curious coalitioh of French and English emis­  
sai ics with federal and repulilican libellers have so  
completely fulfilled the prophecy of Deodati and my  
own forebodings, so totally&#x27; destroyed mv reputation  
by their calumnies, and I have now neither power  
nor influence to do any thing for my country, to as­  
sist her present distresses, or guard her against fu­

Nothing now remains to me birt the right of pri­

municate my sentiments as freely to those who wish  
to know them.

can.Dcodati. And your Countrymen are  
republicans, and your Government is repub­  
lican.Adams. Certainly. My Countrymen are  
Republicans, and our Government is Repub­  
lican. -  
Dcodati. And you have made your  
Countrymen and your Government republi  
can.  
Adams. Not at all, Sir, my Country and  
its Government have been Republican from  
their origin, and long before I was born.  
Deodati. Very well! You at least have  
made your countiy very celebrated. You  
have made it independent You have made  
a marvellous peace with England. You have  
made her acknowledge your Independence,  
&amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.  
Adams. I beg your pardon, Sir, you are  
too polite: Y&#x27;ou do me too much honor. I  
have no pretensions to have performed all  
these great achievements. I have acted a  
part in some of those affairs, but  
Deodati. But! Very well! I will now  
tell you the recompence you will receive for  
all that you have done.  
Adams. I shall be very glad to hear your  
prognostications concerning my destiny.  
Deodati. Your fortune will be that of all  
the republicans; Of Aristides; of Phocion;  
of Mililiades: of Scipio, &amp;c.&amp;c.  
Adams. I believe it.  
Deodati. Y&#x27;ou believe it!  
Adams. Yes.  
Deodati. Y&#x27;ou will experience all the in­  
gratitude, all the injustice of the ancient re­  
publicans.Adams. I expect it; and always have ex­  
pected it. &#x27;  
Deodati. You will be ill treated, bated,  
despised and persecuted.  
Adams. I have no doubt of that. It is  
in the ordinary nature and course of thing3.  
Deodati. Your virtue must be very hero­  
ical. or your philosophy very Stoical, to un  
dertake all these adventures, with you eyes  
open, for sucb a reward.  
So much tor Jjeodati ana nts warning  
voice; and so much for my well grounded  
anticipations.- s - .  
This is no fabulous Dialogue of the dead;  
but strict historical truth.  
A curious coalitiou of French and English  
emissaries with Federal and Republican li­  
bellers have so completely fulfilled the pro­  
phecy cf Deodati and my own forebodings,  
so totally destroyed my reputation by their  
calumnies, that I have neither power nor in­  
fluence to do anything for my country, to as­  
sist her in. her present distresses, or guard  
her against future calamities.  
Nothing remains to me but the right of  
private judgement, and that I exercise freely,  
and communicate my sentiments as freely to  
those who wish to know them.  
I am totis veribus with my whole strength  
against any division of the Uuion, by the  
north river, or by Delaware river, or by the  
  
Potomac, or any other river, or by any chain  
of mountains. I am for maintaining the in­  
dependence of the nation, at all events.  
I am no advocate for Mr. Gore&#x27;s declara­  
tion of war against France, Knowing, as I  
do, from personal experience, the mntuitl  
friendly dispositions between the people of  
France end i&#x27;ue people of America, Bona­  
parte ouf of the question, I should be very  
sorry lo see them converted into ill will, and  
our old English prejudices revived. ? Last  
  
ing injuries and misfortunes would ansa-to  
this country from such a change. &quot; &quot;  
1 am averse also to a war with Ln2!nd,  
and wish to maintain our neutrality as long  
as possible without conceding important prin-  
ciples. Ifekherof the belligerent powers  
force us into war, I am for fighting thai pow-.  
er whichever it may bet ..  
I always consider the whole nation as mv  
children: but they are almost all undutiful  
tome, x on two gentlemen are almost the  
only ones out of my own house, who have  
for a long time, and I th ink you for it, ex  
pressed a filial affection for
