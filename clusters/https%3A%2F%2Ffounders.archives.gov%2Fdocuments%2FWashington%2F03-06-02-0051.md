HEAD-QUARTERS, NEW YORK,   
August 17th, 1776.   
GENTLEMEN—When 1 consider that   
the city of New York will in all human   
probability, very soon be the scene of a   
bloody conflict, I cannot hut view the   
great numbers of women, children and   
infirm persons remaining in it with the   
most melancholy concern. When the   
man of war passed up the river, the shrieks   
and cries of these poor creatures, running   
every way with their children, was truly   
distressing; and I fear will have an un­  
happy effect on the ears and minds of our   
young and inexperienced soldiery. Can   
no method be devised for their removal ?   
Many doubtless are of ability to remove   
themselves, but there are others in a differ­  
ent situation. Some provision for them af­  
terwards would also he a necessary con­  
sideration. It would relieve me from   
great anxiety if your Honorable Body   
would immediately deliberate on it, and   
&#x27; form and execute some plan for their re•   
moval and relief, in which I will co-oper­  
ate and assist to the utmost of my power.   
In the meantime I have thought proper to   
recommend to persons under the above   
description, to convey themselves without   
delay to some place of safety, with their   
most valuable effects.   
  
I have the honor to be, with much re.
