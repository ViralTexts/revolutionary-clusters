Sir,  
New York 25th April 1782  
  
Your Letter of the 21st Instant with the inclosed Testimonials respecting Captain Huddy’s Execution was delivered to me Yesterday. And tho I am extremely concerned for the Cause, I cannot conceal my Surprise &amp; Displeasure at the very improper Language  
You have made use of, which You could not but be sensible was totally unnecessary.  
The Mildness of the British Government does not admit of Acts of Cruelty or persecuting Violence. And, as they are notoriously contrary to the Tenor of my own Conduct &amp; Disposition (having never yet stained my Hands with innocent Blood) I must claim the  
Justice of having it believed that, if such have been committed by any Persons under my Command, they could not have been warranted by my Authority, nor can they ever have the Sanction of my Approbation. My personal Feelings therefore required no such Incitements to urge me  
to take every proper Notice of the barbarous outrage against Humanity, which You have represented to me, the Moment it came to my knowledge: and accordingly when I heard of Captain Huddy’s Death (which was only four days before I received your Letter) I instantly ordered a  
strict Enquiry into all its Circumstances, and shall bring the Perpetrators of it to an immediate trial.  
To Sacrifice Innocence under the Notion of preventing Guilt, in Place of suppressing, would be adopting Barbarity and raising it to the greatest height. Whereas if the Violators of the Laws of War are punished by the Generals under whose Powers they act,  
the Horrors, which those Laws were formed to prevent, will be avoided, and every Degree of Humanity War is capable of maintained.  
Could Violations of Humanity be justified by Examples, many from the Parts where Your Power prevails (that exceed &amp; probably gave rise to this in Question) could be produced.  
In Hope that the Mode I mean to pursue will be adopted by You, and prevent all future Enormities, I remain Sir, Your Most Obedient &amp; Most humble Servant

SI R, New York, Aprit 25, 1782.  
YO U R letter of the 21st instant, with  
the enclosed teflimonials, refpedling  
Capt. Huddy’s execution, was delivered to

concerned for the cauie,l cannot corfeeal my

difpcfition (having never yet stained my

feelings therefore required no such incite­

nity (which you have represented to me)the  
the moment it came to my knowledge ; and  
acaordingly when I heatd or Capt. Huddy’s  
death (which was only four days before Ire-,  
ceived your letter) 1 inflantly ordered a ftrick  
enquiry 1o be madeintoali it’scircumfiances  
and thall bring the perpetrators to an immes  
diats trial. o  
To facrifice innecence, under the notion  
of preventing guilt, in place of iupprefling,  
would be adopting barbarity, and raising it  
tothe greatest height. Whereas, if the vio  
lators of the laws of w-r are punished by  
the Generals under w &#x27;wers they aét,  
the horrors which thoie s were formed  
to prevent, wili be aveoided, and every degree

Could violations of humanity be juftified  
by example. many from the parts where your

duced. In hope thatthe mode I mean to pur­
