The House of Representatives calling to mind the blessings enjoyed by the people of the United States, and especially the happiness of living under constitutions and laws, which rest on their authority alone, could not learn with other emotions than those you have expressed, that any part of our fellow Citizens should have shewn themselves capable of an insurrection. And we learn, with the greatest concern, that any misrepresentations whatever, of the Government and its proceedings, either by individuals or combinations of men, should have been made and so far credited, as to foment the flagrant outrage, which has been committed on the laws.  
We feel, with you, the deepest regret at so painful an occurrence in the annals of our Country. As men regardful of the tender interests of humanity, we look with grief, at scenes which might have stained our land with civil blood: As lovers of public order, we lament that it has suffered so flagrant a violation: As zealous friends of Republican government, we deplore every occasion, which in the hands of it’s enemies, may be turned into a calumny against it.  
This aspect of the crisis, however, is happily not the only one, which it presents. There is another, which yields all the consolations which you have drawn from it. It has demonstrated to the candid world, as well as to the American people themselves, that the great body of them, every where, are equally attached to the luminous and vital principle of our Constitution, which enjoins, that the will of the Majority shall prevail. that they understand the indissoluble union between true Liberty and regular Government; that they feel their duties, no less than they are watchful over their rights; that they will be as ready, at all times, to crush licentiousness, as they have been to defeat usurpation; in a word, that they are capable of carrying into execution, that noble plan of self-government, which they have chosen, as the guarantee of their own happiness and the asylum for that of all from every clime, who may wish to unite their destiny with ours.  
These are the just inferrences flowing from the promptitude, with which the summons to the standard of the laws has been  
  
obeyed, and from the sentiments, which have been witnessed in every description of Citizens, in every quarter of the Union. The spectacle, therefore, when viewed in its true light, may well be affirmed to display, in equal lustre, the virtues of the American character, and the value of Republican government. All must particularly acknowledge and applaud the patriotism of that portion of citizens, who have freely sacrificed every thing less dear than the love of their Country, to the meritorious task of defending its happiness.  
In the part which you have yourself borne through this delicate and distressing period, we trace the additional proofs it has afforded, of your solicitude for the public good. Your laudable and successful endeavours to render lenity in executing the laws conducive to their real energy, and to convert tumult into order, without the effusion of blood, form a particular title to the confidence and praise of your constituents. In all that may be found necessary on our part, to complete this benevolent purpose, and to secure the ministers and friends of the laws against the remains of danger, our due cooperation will be afforded.  
The other subjects, which you have recommended or communicated, and of which several are peculiarly interesting, will all receive the attention which they demand. We are deeply impressed with the importance of an effectual organization of the militia. We rejoice at the intelligence of the advance &amp; success of the army under the command of General Wayne; whether we regard it as a proof of the perseverance, prowess &amp; superiority of our troops, or as a happy presage to our military operations against the hostile Indians, and as a probable prelude to the establishment of a lasting peace, upon terms of candor, equity and good neighbourhood. We receive it with the greater pleasure, as it increases the probability of sooner restoring a part of the public resources to the desirable object of reducing the public debt.  
We shall, on this, as on all occasions, be disposed to adopt any measure, which may advance the safety &amp; prosperity of our Country. In nothing can we more cordially unite with you, than in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations, to multiply his blessings on these United States; to guard our free and happy Constitution against every machination &amp; danger; and to make it the best source of public happiness, by verifying its character of  
  
being the best safeguard of human rights.

THE House of Representatives,  
calling to mind the bleflings enjoyed by  
the people of the United Slates, and

their authority alone, could not learn,

with great concern, that any misrepre­  
sentations, whatever, of the government  
and its proceedings, either by individu­  
als, or combinations of men, should  
have been made, and so far credited, as  
to foment the flagrant outrage, which  
has been committed on the laws.  
  
We feel, with you, the deepest regret,  
at lb painful an occurrencc in the annals  
of our country. As men, regardful of  
the tender interefls of humanity, we look  
with grief at fo#nes which might have  
  
tained our land with civil blood. As  
overs of public order, we lament that  
t hasfuffered foflagrant a violation: As  
.ealous friends of Republican C/Overn­  
nent, we deplore every occalion which,  
n the hands of its enemies, may be turn  
:d into a calumny againfl it.  
This alpedt of the crilis, howsver, is  
lappily not the only one which i| pre­  
ents. 1 here is another which yields all  
he consolations which you have drawn  
rom it. It hasdemonllrated to the can ■  
lid world, as well as to the American  
Jeople themfelvei, that the great body

ached to the1 luminous and vital pnnci

hat the will of the majority ihall prevail:  
That they uudciHand i lie indifl&#x27;oltibk  
mion between true libeity and regular  
;overnment: That they feel their dutie.-  
10 less than they are watchful over theii  
&#x27;&gt;ihts: That they will be as ready at  
11 times ro crush licentioafnefs, as they  
lave been to defeat ufurpation;—ln ;  
vord, that they are capable of carrying  
nto execution that noble plan of felt&quot;  
government, which they have chofei)  
is the guarantee of their own happiness  
ind theafylum for that of all from eve­  
ychme, who may wilh to unite theii  
leftiny with ours.  
These are the j 1111 inferences flowing  
rom the promptitude with which the  
ummons to the Handard of the laws hai  
&gt;een obeyed; and from the fentimenti  
vhich have been witnefTcd in every de  
cription of citizens, in every quarter o:

vhen viewed in its true light, may wel

very thing, less dear than the love o!  
heir country, to the metitorious talk o;  
lefending its happiness.  
In the pait which you yourfelf hav(

part, to complete this benevolent pur  
pose, and to fecurc the minillers ant  
friends of the laws against the remain!  
as danger, our due co-operation will b&lt;  
afforded.
