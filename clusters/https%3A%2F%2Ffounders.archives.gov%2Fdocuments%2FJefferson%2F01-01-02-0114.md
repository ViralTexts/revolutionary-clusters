8 July 1775]  
To The Kings Most Excellent Majesty  
Most gracious Sovereign  
  
We your Majesty’s faithful subjects of the colonies of Newhampshire, Massachusetts-bay, Rhode island and Providence plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, the counties of New Castle Kent and Sussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, in behalf of ourselves and the inhabitants of these colonies, who have deputed us to represent them in general Congress, entreat your Majestys gracious attention to this our humble petition.  
The union between our Mother Country and these colonies, and the energy of mild and just government, produced benefits so remarkably important, and afforded such an assurance of their permanency and increase, that the wonder and envy of other Nations were excited, while they beheld Great Britain riseing to a power the most extraordinary the world had ever known.  
Her rivals observing, that there was no probability of this happy connection being broken by civil dissentions, and apprehending its future effects, if left any longer undisturbed, resolved to prevent her receiving such continual and formidable accessions of wealth and strength, by checking the growth of these settlements from which they were to be derived.  
In the prosecution of this attempt events so unfavourable to the design took place, that every friend to the interests of Great Britain and these colonies entertained pleasing and reasonable expectations of seeing an additional force and extention immediately given to the operations of the union hitherto experienced, by an enlargement of  the dominions of the Crown, and the removal of ancient and warlike enemies to a greater distance.  
At the conclusion therefore of the late war, the most glorious and advantagious that ever had been carried on by British arms, your loyal colonists having contributed to its success, by such repeated and strenuous exertions, as frequently procured them the distinguished approbation of your Majesty, of the late king, and of Parliament, doubted not but that they should be permitted with the rest of the empire, to share in the blessings of peace and the emoluments of victory and conquest. While these recent and honorable acknowledgments of their merits remained on record in the journals and acts of that august legislature the Parliament, undefaced by the imputation or even the suspicion of any offence, they were alarmed by a new system of Statutes and regulations adopted for the administration of the colonies, that filled their minds with the most painful fears and jealousies; and to their inexpressible astonishment perceived the dangers of a foreign quarrel quickly succeeded by domestic dangers, in their judgment of a more dreadful kind.  
Nor were their anxieties alleviated by any tendency in this system to promote the welfare of the Mother Country. For ’tho its effects were more immediately felt by them, yet its influence appeared to be injurious to the commerce and prosperity of Great Britain.  
We shall decline the ungrateful task of describing the irksome variety of artifices practised by many of your Majestys ministers, the delusive pretences, fruitless terrors, and unavailing severities, that have from time to time been dealt out by them, in their attempts to execute this impolitic plan, or of traceing thro’ a series of years past the progress of the unhappy differences between Great Britain and these colonies which have flowed from this fatal source.  
Your Majestys ministers persevering in their measures and proceeding to open hostilities for enforcing them, have compelled us to arm in our own defence, and have engaged us in a controversy so peculiarly abhorrent to the affections of your still faithful colonists, that when we consider whom we must oppose in this contest, and if it continues, what may be the consequences, our own particular misfortunes are accounted by us, only as parts of our distress.  
Knowing, to what violent resentments and incurable animosities, civil discords are apt to exasperate and inflame the contending parties, we think ourselves required by indispensable obligations to Almighty God, to your Majesty, to our fellow subjects, and to ourselves, immediately to use all the means in our power not incompatible with our safety, for stopping the further effusion of blood,  and for averting the impending calamities that threaten the British Empire.  
Thus called upon to address your Majesty on affairs of such moment to America, and probably to all your dominions, we are earnestly desirous of performing this office with the utmost deference for your Majesty; and we therefore pray, that your royal magnanimity and benevolence may make the most favourable construction of our expressions on so uncommon an occasion. Could we represent in their full force the sentiments that agitate the minds of us your dutiful subjects, we are persuaded, your Majesty would ascribe any seeming deviation from reverence, in our language, and even in our conduct, not to any reprehensible intention but to the impossibility of reconciling the usual appearances of respect with a just attention to our own preservation against those artful and cruel enemies, who abuse your royal confidence and authority for the purpose of effecting our destruction.  
Attached to your Majestys person, family and government with all the devotion that principle and affection can inspire, connected with Great Britain by the strongest ties that can unite societies, and deploring every event that tends in any degree to weaken them, we solemnly assure your Majesty, that we not only most ardently desire the former harmony between her and these colonies may be restored but that a concord may be established between them upon so firm a basis, as to perpetuate its blessings uninterrupted by any future dissentions to succeeding generations in both countries, and to transmit your Majestys name to posterity adorned with that signal and lasting glory that has attended the memory of those illustrious personages, whose virtues and abilities have extricated states from dangerous convulsions, and by securing happiness to others, have erected the most noble and durable monuments to their own fame.  
We beg leave further to assure your Majesty that notwithstanding the sufferings of your loyal colonists during the course of the present controversy, our breasts retain too tender a regard for the kingdom from which we derive our origin to request such a reconciliation as might in any manner be inconsistent with her dignity or her welfare. These, related as we are to her, honor and duty, as well as inclination induce us to support and advance; and the apprehensions that now oppress our hearts with unspeakable grief, being once removed, your Majesty will find your faithful subjects on this continent ready and willing at all times, as they ever have been  with their lives and fortunes to assert and maintain the rights and interests of your Majesty and of our Mother Country.  
We therefore beseech your Majesty, that your royal authority and influence may be graciously interposed to procure us releif from our afflicting fears and jealousies occasioned by the system before mentioned, and to settle peace through every part of your dominions, with all humility submitting to your Majesty’s wise consideration, whether it may not be expedient for facilitating those important purposes, that your Majesty be pleased to direct some mode by which the united applications of your faithful colonists to the throne, in pursuance of their common councils, may be improved into a happy and permanent reconciliation; and that in the meantime measures be taken for preventing the further destruction of the lives of your Majesty’s subjects; and that such statutes as more immediately distress any of your Majestys colonies be repealed: For by such arrangements as your Majestys wisdom can form for collecting the united sense of your American people, we are convinced, your Majesty would receive such satisfactory proofs of the disposition of the colonists towards their sovereign and the parent state, that the wished for opportunity would soon be restored to them, of evincing the sincerity of their professions by every testimony of devotion becoming the most dutiful subjects and the most affectionate colonists.  
That your Majesty may enjoy a long and prosperous reign, and that your descendants may govern your dominions with honor to themselves and happiness to their subjects is our sincere and fervent prayer.

To the KING’s Moft Excellent Majeftys  
  
Moft gracious Sovereign,  
  
WeE your Majetty’s faithful fubj-&amp;s  
  
&quot;of the colonies of New-Hamp-,  
fhire, Maffachufets-bay, Rhode-ifland  
and Providence plantations, Conneéti«  
cut,New. Yok, New-Jerfey, Penntylvag,  
nia, the counties of Newcaftle, Kent,  
and Suffex in Delaware, Maryiand,  
Virginia, North and South Carolina, in  
behalf of curfelves and the inhabitsnts.  
of thefe colonies, who have deputed us  
to reprefent them in general congrefs,  
entreat your Majefty’s gracious aitens  
tion to this our humble petition.  
  
The union between our mother.  
country and thefe colonies, and the  
energy of mild and juft government,  
produced benefits fo remarkably im-.  
portant, and afforded fuch affurance  
of their permanency and increafe, that  
the wonder and envy of other nations  
were excited, while they beheld Great-  
Britain rifing to a power the moft ex-  
traordinary the-world had ever known,  
Her rivals obferving that there was no  
probability of this happy. connection  
being broken by civil diffrntions, and  
apprehending its future effects, if left  
any longer undifturbed, refolved to  
prevent her receiving fa continual and  
formidable an acceflion of wealth and  
ftrength, by checking the growth of  
thefe fettlements, from which they  
were to be derived.  
  
In the profecution of this attempt,  
events fo unfavourable to the defign  
took place, that every friend to the in-  
tereft of Great- Britain and thefe colo~  
nies entertained pleafing and reafona-  
ble expeétarions of ieeing an additional:  
force and extention immediately given  
to the operations of the unicn hitherto  
experienced, by an enlargement of the  
domimons of the crown, and the ree  
moval of ancient and warlike enemies  
to a greater diftance.  
  
At the conclufion, therefore, of the  
late war, the moft glorious and advan-  
tageous that ever had been c:rricd on  
by Britifh arms, your loyal colonies,,  
  
having  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
436 Putition of the American Congrefs to the King.  
  
having contributed to its fuccefs by  
fach repeated and ftrenuous exertions  
as frequently procured them the dif-  
tinguifhed approbation of your Ma-  
jefty, of the late King, and of par-  
jament, doubted not but that they  
fhould be permitted, with the ret of  
the empire, to fhiare in the bleffings of  
peace, and the emoluments of victory  
and conqueft. While thefe recent and  
honourable acknowledgments of their  
merits remained on record in the jour-  
nals and aéts of that auguft legiftature,  
the parliament, undefaced by the im-  
‘utation, or even the fufpicion, of any  
offence, they wére alarmed by 4 new  
fyftem of ftatutes and regulations, a-  
dopted for the adminiftration of the  
colonies, that filled their minds with  
the molt painful fears and jealouftes ;  
and, to their inexprefhible altonifhment;  
perceived the dangers of a foreign quar-  
rel quickly fucceeded by domeltic dan-  
  
ers in their jadgment of a more dread-  
fii kind.  
  
Nor were their anxieties alleviated  
by any tendency in this fyftem, to pro-  
mote the welfare of the mother eoun-  
try: for, though its effects were more  
immediately felt by them, yet its in-  
fluence appeared to be injurious to the  
commerce and piofperity of Great-  
Britain.  
  
We hall decline the ungrateful tafk  
of defcribing the irkfome variety of  
artifices pfactifed by many of your  
Majefty’s minifters, the delufive pre-  
tences, fruitlefs terrors, and unavailing  
feverities, whith have from time to  
time been dealt out by them in their  
attempts to execute this impolitic plan,  
or of tracing through a feries of years  
palt the progrefs of the unhappy dif-  
ferences between Great- Britain and  
thefe colonies, which have flowed from  
this fatal fource. Your Majefty’s mi-  
nifters perfevering in their meafures,and  
  
oceeding to open hoftilities for en-  
Forcing them, have compelled us to  
arm in our own defence, and have en-  
paged us in a controverfy fo peculiarly  
abhorrent from the affections of your  
fill faithful colonitts, that, when we  
confider whom we mutt oppofe in this  
contelt, and, if it continues, what may  
be the confequence, our own particu-  
lar misfoitunes are accounted by us  
only as parts of our diftrefs,  
  
Knowing to what violent refentments  
and incurable animofities civil difcords  
  
are apt to exafperate and inflame the  
  
contending parties, we think ourfelves  
tequired by indifpenfable obligations ta  
  
Almighty God, to your Majefty, te  
our fellow-fubjeéts, and ou: felyes, im-  
mediately to ufe al} the means in our  
power, not incompatible with our fafe~  
ty, for hopping the further effafion of  
blood, and for averting the impending  
caJamities that threaten the Bricifh em-  
piree Thus called upon to addrefs  
your Majefty on affairs of (uch moment  
to America, and probably to all your

of performing this office with the ut-  
moft deference to your Majefty; and  
we therefore pray that your royal mag.  
nanimity and. benevolence may make  
the moft favourable conftruétions of  
our expreffions on fo uncommon an oc-  
cafion,  
  
Could we reprefent, in their full  
force, the fentiments which agitate the

are perfuaded your Majefty would a«  
fcribe any feeming deviation from reves

fervation againft thofe artful and cruel  
enemies, who abufe your royal confi-  
dence and authority for the purpofe of  
effecting our defltudion,  
  
Attached to your Majefty’s perfon,  
family, and government, with all the  
devotion that principle and affeétion  
can infpire, conneéted with Great. Brie  
taiv by the ftrongeft ties that can unite  
focieties, and deploring every event  
that tends in any degree to weaken  
thems we folemnly affure your Majetty,  
that we not only moft ardently defre  
the former harmony between her and  
thefe colonies may be reftored, but that  
a concord may be efablifbed between  
them upon fo firm a bafis as to perpe-  
tuate its bleffings, uninterrupted by any  
future diffentions, to fucceeding gené-

mit your Majefty’s name to pofterity,  
adorned with that fignal and ‘lafting

from dangerous convulfions, and, by  
fecuring happinefs 10 others, have erect~’

We beg leave further to affure your

_ We therefore befeech your Majelty,

be improved into a happy and perma-  
ment reconciliation; and that, in the

yenting the further deftruétion of the  
Tives of your MajeRy’s fubjedts, and  
that fuch ftatates as more immediately  
diftre(s any of your Majelty’s colonies  
be repealed. For by fuch arrange,

orm, for colle&amp;ting the united fenfe  
of your American people, we are con-  
vinced your Majelty would receive  
fuch fatisfactory proofs of the difpof-  
tion of the colonifts toward their fo-  
vereign and the parent-ftate, that the  
withed-for opportunity would foon be  
reftored to them, of evincing the fin-  
cerity of their profeffions, by every tef-  
timony of devotion becoming the smoft  
dutiful fubjec?s, and the moft affectionate  
colonifts.  
That your Majefty may enjoy a long  
and profperous reign, and that your  
defcendants may govern the dominions,  
with honour to themfelves, and hap-  
pinefs to their fubjeéte, is our fincere  
and fervent prayer. ;

426 MONTHLY MISCELLANY. (Serr,  
  
to the Operations of the union hitherto ex-  
perienced, by an enlargement of the Domi-  
nions of the Crown, and the removal of anti-  
ent and warlike enemies to&#x27;a greater diftance.  
  
At the conelufion, therefore, of the late  
war, the moft glorious and advantageous  
that ever had been carried on by Britifh  
Arms, your loyal Colonies, having contri-  
buted to its fuccefs by fuch repeated and  
ftrenuous exertions as frequently procured  
them the diftinguifhed approbation of your

sent, doubted not but that they fhould be  
permitted, with the reft of the Empire, to  
hare in the bleffings of peace, and the emo-  
luments of vitory and conqueft. While  
thefe recent and honourable acknowledge-  
ments of their merits remained on record  
the journals and aéts of that auguft legifla-  
ture, the Parliament, undefaced by the im-  
putation, or even the fufpicion, of any of-  
fence, they were alarmed by a new fy{ftem  
of ftatutes and regulations, adopted for the  
adminiftration of the Colonies, that filled  
their minds with the moft painful fears and  
jealoufies; and, to their inexpreffible afto-  
-nifhment, perceived the dangers of a foreign  
quarrebquickly fucceeded by domeftic dan-  
gers, in their judgement of a more dread-  
ful kind,  
  
Nor-were their anxieties alleviated by any  
-témdency in this fyftem to promote the wel-  
4are of the Mother Country: For though its  
effects were-more immediately felt by them,  
vytt its influence appeared to be injurious to  
the commerce and profperity of Great-  
Britain,  
&gt; We thal! decline the ungrateful tafk of de-  
fcribing the irkfome variety of artifices prac-  
tifed by many of your Majefty’s Minifters,  
the delufive pretences, fruitlefs terrors, and  
unavailing feverities, which have from time  
to time been dealt out by them in their at-  
tempts to execute this impolitic plan, or of  
tracing through @ feries of years paft the  
  
progrefs of the unkrappy differences between:  
  
Great-Britain. and thefe Colonies, which  
have flowed from this fatal fource, Your  
Majefty’s Minifters perfevering in their mea-  
fures, and proceeding to open hoftilities for  
enforcing them, have compelled us to arm  
im our own defence, and have engaged us in  
a controverfy fo peculiarly abhorrent from  
the affections of your ftill faithful Colonifts,  
that when we confider whom we muft oppofe  
in this conteft, and if it continues, what  
may be the confequence ; our own particu-  
Jar misfortunes are accounted by us only as  
parts of our diftrefs.  
  
Knowing to-what violent refentments and  
incurable animofities civil difcords are apt  
to exafperate and inflame the contending  
parties, we think ourfelves required by indif-  
penfable obligations to Almighty God, to

bably to all your dominions, we are garneftly

Could we reprefent, in their full force  
the fentiments which agitate the minds of us,

Majeity would afcribe any feeming deviation  
from reverence, in our language, and even in

tion, but to the impoffibility of reconciling  
the ufual appearances of refpeét, with a jutt  
attention to our prefervation againft thofe  
artful and cruel enemies, who abufe your  
royal confidence and authority for the pur-  
pofe of effecting our deftrudion,  
  
Attached to your Majefty’s perfon, family  
and government, with all the devotion thar  
principle and affeétion can infpire, conne&amp;ed  
with Great Britain by the ftrongeft ties that  
can unite focieties, and deploring every event  
that tends in any degree to weaken them, we  
folemnly affure your Majefty that we not  
only moft ardently defire the former barmony  
betveen her and thefe Colonies may be re-  
ftored, but that a concord may be eftablifhed be-  
tween them upon fo firm a bafis as to perpe-  
tuate its bleffings uninterrupted by any fu-

To the KING’s Most Excellent MAJESTY.  
Mott gracious SOVEREIGN, : :  
E your Maj:fty’s faithful Subje&amp;t: of the Colonies of  
New Hampthire, Maflachuf:tts-Bay, Rliode Island  
&amp; Providence Plantations, Conne&amp;licut, New - York,  
New Jn(ey,‘Penn(’,lvania, the Countics of New-  
Castle, Kent, and Sussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,North  
Carolina, and South Carolina, 1n Behalf ot Outfclves, and the  
Yohabitacts of these Colosies, who have deputed us to represent  
them 10 gencral Congress, entreat jour Mejefty’s gracious Atiea-  
Aion to this our humble Petition,  
The Union between our Mother Country and these Colonies,  
and the Energy of mild and just Government, produced Benefits so  
yemarkably important, &amp; afforaed such an Aflurance of their per=  
manenc; and Increase, that the Wonder and Envy of other Na­  
tions were excited, while they beheld Great Britain rising to a  
Puwer the most extraordinary the World had ever known,  
Her Rivals observing that there was no Probability of this hap­  
py Connection being broken by Civil Diffentions, and apprebend­  
ing its future Eff-€ls, if left any longer undifiurbed, resolved to  
‘prevent her receiving such continusl and formidable Aceeflions  
of Wealth and Strength, by checking the Growth of those Set­  
tlemments from which they weee to be derived.  
In the Prosecution of this Attempt, Events so unfavourable to  
the Design took Place, that every Friend to the Incereft of Great-  
Britain and these Calonies, entertained pleasing and reasonable  
Expcations of feeing an additional Force and Extention imme­  
diately given to thcOperations of the Union hitherto experienced,  
by an Ealurgement of the Dominioas of the Crown, and the Re­  
moval of ancient and warlike Euemies toa greater Distance.  
At the Conelufion therefore of the late War,the most glorious  
and advantageous that ever had been carried on by Britith Arme,  
your loyalColonifts, haviog contributed to its Success, by such re­  
peated and strenuous Exertions, as frequently procuted them the  
diftinguithed Approbation of your Majesty, of the late King, and  
of Parliament, doubted not, but that they should be permitted,  
with the Rest of the Empire to share in the Bleflings of Peace,and  
the Emoluments of Vi&amp;ory and Conquett,  
While these recent and honorable Acknowledgements of the  
Merits temained on Record in the Journals and Aéts of that au­  
gust Legislature, the Parliament, undefaced by the Imputation or  
even the Suspicion of any Offence, they were alarmed by a new  
System of Statutes and Regulations, adopted for the Adminiftra­  
(io&amp;_of the Colonies, that filled their Minds with the most paine  
fulFears, &amp; Jealousies ; and to their inexprefiible Astonishment,  
perceived the Danger of a foreign Quarrel, quickly succeeded by  
domestic Dangers. in their Judgment of a more dreadfui Kind,  
Nor were these Anxietits alleviated by any Tendency in this  
System to promote the Welfare of their Mother Country, For  
though its Effc@s were mote immediately felt by them, yet its  
Tofluence appeated to be injurious to the Commerce and Prospe­  
rity of Great-Britain.  
We thall decline the ungrateful Task of describing the irksome  
Variety of Artifices,” pra&amp;ifed by many of your Majesty’s Mini­  
fiers, the delusive Pretences, fruitle(s Tertors, and unavailing Se­  
yerities, that have from Time to Time been dealt out by them,in  
their Attempts to execute this impolitic Plan, or of tracing thro’  
a Series of Years past the Progress of the unbappy Differences be­  
tween Great-Britain and these Colonies, that have flowed from  
this fatal Source,  
Your Majesty’s Ministers, persevering in their Meafuree, and  
proceeding to open Hostilities for enforcing them, have compelled  
us to arm in ~ut own Dzfeice, and have engaged usin a Contro­  
ver{y so peculiarly abhorrent to the Affe€tions of your still faith­  
fu!Colonift:, that when we confider whom we must oppose in this  
Contelt, and if it continugs, what may be the Consequences, our  
owo particulsr Misfortunes are accounted by us only as Parts of  
our Dittiefs.  
Kiowing to what violent Resentments and incurable Anima­  
fities, civil Discords are apt to exasperate and inflame the contend­  
ing Parties, we think Ourselves required by thdifpenfible Obliga­  
tions to Almighty GOD. to your Majesty, to our Fellow Subjects  
and to, Qurfelves, immediately to us: all the Meansin our Power,  
not incompatible with our Safety, for stopping the further Effu­  
fion of Blood, asd for averting the impending Calamities that  
threaten the Butith Empizes e  
Thus called spon to address your Majesty onAffairs of fuchMo­  
ment to America,and probably to all your Dominions, we are ear­  
nestly desirous of performing this Office,with the utmost Dzference  
for your Majesty; and we therefore pray, that your Mazjetty&#x27;s  
royal Magnanimity &amp; Benevolence may make the most favourable  
Conftru&amp;ions of our Expreflions on so uncommon an Qccafion.-=  
Could we represent in their foll Force the Sentiments thar agitates  
the Minds of us your dutiful Subjeéts,we are persuaded, your Ma­  
jesty would aferibe any seeming Deviation from Reverence in our  
Language,and even in ourConduét,nor ta any reprehensible Inten­  
tion, but to the Impossibility of teconciling the usual Appearances  
of Refpe with a joft Attention to our own Preservation against  
those awful and cruel Enemies, who abuse your royal Confidence  
and Authority, for the Purpose of effefing our Deftruétion.  
_ Attached to your Majefiy’s Person, Family and Government,  
with all Devotion that Principle and Affeétion can inspire, con­  
neéted with Great Brirain by the fifongeft Ties that can unite So­  
cicties, &amp; deploring every Event that tends in any Degree to weak­  
en them : We solemnly assure your Majesty, that we, not only  
most ardently desire the formet Harmony between Her and these  
Colonies, may be restored, but that a Concord may be established  
between them upon so firm a Basis as to perpetuate its Bleﬂi{ags,  
uninterrupted by any fatureDiffzations, to succeeding Generations  
%n both Countries, and to tran{mit your Majcfty’s Name to Pos­  
terity, adoraed with that fignel and lasing Glory that has attended  
the Memory as thofeilluftrious Personages, whose Virtues &amp; Abi-  
Jities have extricated States from dangerous Convulsions, and by  
securing Happiness to others, rave ereéted the most goble and dur­  
able Monuments to their own Fame. :  
EWe beg lcave futther to assure your Majesty, that notwitbhftand­  
ing the Sufferings of your loysl Colonifis, during the Course of  
this present Controverfey, cur Breasts vetain too tender a Regard  
for the Kingdom from which we derive out Origin, to request

with unspeakable Grief, being once removed, your Majefly will

at all times asthey bave ever besa, with their Lives and Fortunes  
to assert and maintain ‘the Rights and Intereflts of your Mejefty,  
and of out Mother Country.  
We therefore beseech your Majesty, that your Royal Authority  
and Influence may be gracioully iaterpoled to procure us Relief  
from our afli&amp;ing Fears and Jealoufigs, occgfioned by the Syliem  
before-mentioned, and to fetide Perace thro® every Part of your

Mode, by which the United App&#x27;ications of your faithful Cole­

be improved into a happy and permanent Reconciliation ; &amp; rhat  
in the mean Time measures may be talien for preventing the fur­  
ther Deftruétion of the Lives of yourMaj=fty’s Subjeéts; and (hat  
such Statutes as more immediately distress any of your Majcfty&#x27;s  
Colonies may be sepealed.  
For by such Arrangaments as your Mujefty’s Wisdom can form  
for colle@ing the united Sense of yonr American People, we ate  
convinced, your Majesty would reccive such fa&#x27;isfattory Proofs of  
the Disposition of the Colonists tcwards thieir Sovereign and the  
Perent Sate,that the withed for Opportunity would faon be restored  
to them, of evincing the sincerity of their Profeffions, by every  
Testimony of Devotion becoming the most dutiful Subjels aad

That your Majesty may enjoy a long and prosperous Reign, and  
that your Dcfcendents may govern your D minions, with Honour  
to themselves and Happiness to their Subjets, is our sincere and  
fervent Prayer

The union between our Mother country and

thele Colonies, entertained pleafing and rea-  
fonable expeétations of feeing an additional  
force and extenfion immediately given to the  
operations of the union hitherto experienced,  
by an of the dominions of the  
Crown, and the removal of antient and warlike  
enemies to a greater diftance.  
  
Atthe conclufion, therefore, of che late war,  
the moft glorious and advantageous that ever  
had been carried on by Britith arms, your loy-  
al Colonies, having contributed to its fucceis  
by fuch repeated and ftrenuous exerticns as fre-

of Parliament, doubted not but that they fhould  
be permitted, with the reft of the empire, to  
fhare in the bleffings of peace, and the emolu-

recent and honourable acknowledgments of  
their merits remained on record in the Journals  
and Acts of that auguit Legiflature, the Par-  
liament, undefaced by the imputation, or even  
the fulpicion of any offence, they were alarm-  
  
i» + ed byanew fyttem of ttatutes, and regulations,  
‘wadopted for the admuniftration of the Colonies,  
  
Caat filled their minds with the moft patnful  
fears and jealoufies; and, to their inexpreflible  
aftonifhment, perceived the dangers of aforeign  
quarrel quickly fucceeded by domeftic dangers,  
in their judgment of a more dreadiul kind.  
  
Nor were their anxieties alleviated by any  
  
tendency in this fyftem to promote the wel-  
fare of the Mother country : for though its  
effeéts were more immediately felt by them,  
yet its influence appeared to be injurious to the  
commerce and profperity of Great-Britain.  
  
We fhall decline the ungrateful tatk of de-  
  
fcrihing the irkfome variety of artifices practil-  
ed by many of your Majefty’s Minifters, the  
delufive pretences, fruitiets terrors and unavail-

been dealt out by them in their attempts to  
execute this impelitic plan, or of tracing  
through a feries of years patt the progrefs of  
the unhappy differences between Great-Britain  
and thele Colonies, which have flowed from  
this fatal fource, Your Majefty’s Muinilters  
perfeyering in their meafures, and procecding  
to Open hoftilities for enforcing them, have  
compelled us to arm in our own defence, and

what may be the confequences ; Our own par~-

Knowing to what violent refentment and in-

took place, that every friend to the  
interelt of Great Britain and thefe  
colonies, entertained pleafingand rea-  
fonable expectations of feeing an ad-  
ditional force and exertion unmedi-  
atcly given to the operations of the  
union hitherto experienced, by an  
enlargement of the dominions of the  
crown, and the removal of ancient and  
warlike enemies to a greater diftance.  
  
At the conclufion, therefore, of  
the late war, the molt glorious and  
advantageous that ever had been car-  
ried on by Britifh arms, your loyal  
colonifts, having contributed to its fuc-  
  
cefs, by fuch repeated and ftrenuous  
exertions, as frequently procured them  
the diflinguifhed approbation of your  
majefty, of the late king, and of par-  
fiament, doubted not but that they  
thould be permitted, with the relt of  
the empire, to fhare in the bleffings  
of peace, and the emoluments of vic-  
tory and conqueft,  
  
While thefe recent and honourable  
acknowledgments of their merits re-  
mained on record in the journals and  
acts of that auguft legiflature, the par-  
liament, undefaced by the imputation  
or even the fufpicion of any offence,  
they were alarmed by a new fyftem  
of ftatutes and regulations, adopted  
for the adminiltration of the colonies,  
that filled their minds with the moft  
patnful fears and jealoufies; and, to  
their inexpreffible aftonifhment, per-  
cetved the danger of a foreign quar-  
rl quickly fucceeded by domeftic  
danger, in their judgatent of a more  
dreadful kind.  
  
Nor were thefe anxieties alleviat-  
dby any tendency in this fyltem to  
romote the welfare of their mother  
ountry. For though ts eHfetts were  
  
nore immediately felt by them, yet  
ts influence appeared to be injuri-  
1s to the commerce and profperity  
bf Great Britain.  
  
We fhall decline the ungrateful  
atk of defcribing che irkfome variety  
fartifices, practifed by many of your

or of tracing thro’ a ferics of years  
paft, the progrefs of the unhappy  
differences between Great Britain  
and thefe colonies, that have flowed  
from this fatal fource.  
  
Your majefly’s minifters, perfever-  
ing in their meafures, and proceeding  
to open hoftilities for enforcing them,  
bave compelled usto arm in our own  
defence, and have engaged us in a

it continues, what may be the confe-

Knowing to what violent refent-

Thus called upon to addrefs your

infpire, connected with Great Britain  
by the ilrongelt ties that can unite fo-

concord may be eflablilhed becween

tuate its bleflings, uninterrupted b -  
any future diffentions, to fucceeding  
generations in both countries, and  
to tranfmit your majelly’s name to

and lafting glory, that has attended the  
memory ot thofe itluftrious perfonages,  
whofe virtues and abilities bere extri-  
cated fiates from dangerous convulfi-  
ons, and, by fecuring happinefs to  
others, have eretted the moft noble and  
durable monuments to their own fame.  
  
We beg leave further to affure your  
majefty, that notwithftanding the fuf-  
ferings of your boyal colonitts, during  
the courfe of this prefent controverfy,  
our brealts retain too tender a regar  
for the kingdom from which we de-  
rive our origin, to requeft fuch a re-  
conciliation as might in any manner  
be inconfiftent with her dignity or ber  
welfare. Thefe, related as we are to  
her, honour and duty, as well as in-  
clination, ‘induce us to fupport and  
advance ; and the apprehenfions that  
now opprefs our hearts with unfpeak-  
able grief, being once removed, your  
majelty will find your faithful fubjects  
on this continent ready and willing at  
all times, as they have ever heen, with  
their lives and fortunes, to affert and  
maintain the rights and interefts of your  
majelty, and of our mother country.  
  
We therefore befeech your majef-  
tv, that your royal authority and im-  
fluence may be gractoufly mrerpofed  
ta procure us relief from our afflicting  
fears and jealoufies, occafioned by the  
fyflem before mentioned, and to fet-  
tle peace through every part of your  
dominions, with all humility fubmit-  
ting to your majelly’s wife confide-  
ration, whether it may not be expe-  
dient for facilitating thofe important  
purpofes, thar your majefty be pleafed  
to direct fone mode, by which the  
vnied applicauous of your faithful co-  
  
lonifts to the throne, in purfuance of  
their common councils, may be im-  
proved into ahappy and permanent  
reconciliation ; and that, in the mean  
time, meafures may be taken for pre-  
venting the further deftruction of the  
lives of your majelly’s fubjetis ; and  
that fuch flatutes as more immediately  
difirefs any of your majefty’s colo.  
nics may be repealed,  
  
For by fuch arrangements as your  
majefty’s wifdom can form for collett.  
ing the united fenfe of your American  
people, we are convinced your majet.  
ty would receive fuch fatisfatrory  
proofs of the difpofition of the colo

of evincing the fincerity of their pro-
