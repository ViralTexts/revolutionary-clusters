[New York, July 19, 1804]  
  
The statement containing the facts that led to the interview between General Hamilton and Col. Burr, published in the Evening Post on Monday, studiously avoided mentioning any particulars of what past at the place of meeting. This was dictated by suitable considerations at the time, and with the intention, that whatever it might be deemed proper to lay before the public, should be made the subject of a future communication. The following is therefore now submitted.  
In the interviews that have since taken place between the gentlemen that were present, they have not been able to agree in two important facts that passed there—for which reason nothing was said on those subjects in the paper lately published as to other particulars in which they were agreed.  
Mr. P. expressed a confident opinion that General Hamilton did not fire first—and that he did not fire at all at Col. Burr. Mr. V. N. seemed equally confident in the opinion that Gen. H. did fire first—and of course that it must have been at his antagonist.  
General Hamilton’s friend thinks it to be a sacred duty he owes to the memory of that exalted man, to his country, and his friends, to publish to the world such facts and circumstances as have produced a decisive conviction in his own mind, that he cannot have been mistaken in the belief he has formed on these points.  
1st. Besides the testimonies of Bishop Moore, and the paper containing an express declaration, under General Hamilton’s own hand, enclosed to his friend in a packet, not to be delivered but in the event of his death, and which have already been published, General Hamilton informed Mr. P. at least ten days previous to the affair, that he had doubts whether he would not receive and not return Mr. Burr’s first fire. Mr. P. remonstrated against this determination, and urged many considerations against it, as dangerous to himself and not necessary in the particular case, when every ground of accommodation, not humiliating, had been proposed and rejected. He said he would not decide lightly, but take time to deliberate fully. It was incidentally mentioned again at their occasional subsequent conversations, and on the evening preceding the time of the appointed interview, he informed Mr. P. he had made up his mind not to fire at Col. Burr the first time, but to receive his fire, and fire in the air. Mr. P. again urged him upon this subject, and repeated his former arguments. His final answer was in terms that made an impression on Mr. P’s mind which can never be effaced. “My friend, it is the effect of A Religious Scruple, and does not admit of reasoning, it is useless to say more on the subject, as my purpose is definitely fixed.”  
2d. His last words before he was wounded afford a proof that this purpose had not changed. When he received his pistol, after having taken his position, he was asked if he would have the hair spring set? His answer was, “Not this time.”  
  
3d. After he was wounded, and laid in the boat, the first words he uttered after recovering the power of speech, were, (addressing himself to a gentleman present, who perfectly well remembers it) “Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at Col. Burr the first time.”  
4th. This determination had been communicated by Mr. P. to that gentleman that morning, before they left the city.  
5th. The pistol that had been used by General Hamilton, lying loose over the other apparatus in the case which was open; after having been some time in the boat, one of the boatmen took hold of it to put it into the case. General Hamilton observing this, said “Take care of that pistol—it is cocked. It may go off and do mischief.” This is also remembered by the gentleman alluded to.  
This shews he was not sensible of having fired at all. If he had fired previous to receiving the wound, he would have remembered it, and therefore have known that the pistol could not go off; but if afterwards it must have been the effect of an involuntary exertion of the muscles produced by a mortal wound, in which case, he could not have been conscious of having fired.  
6. Mr. P. having so strong a conviction that if General Hamilton had fired first, it could not have escaped his attention (all his anxiety being alive for the effect of the first fire, and having no reason to believe the friend of Col. Burr was not sincere in the contrary opinion) he determined to go to the spot where the affair took place, to see if he could not discover some traces of the course of the ball from Gen. Hamilton’s pistol.  
He took a friend with him the day after General Hamilton died, and after some examination they fortunately found what they were in search of. They ascertained that the ball passed through the limb of a cedar tree, at an elevation of about twelve feet and a half, perpendicularly from the ground, between thirteen and fourteen feet from the mark on which General Hamilton stood, and about four feet wide of the direct line between him and Colonel Burr, on the right side; he having fallen on the left. The part of the limb through which the ball passed was cut off and brought to this city, and is now in Mr. Church’s possession.  
No inferences are pointed out as resulting from these facts, nor will any comments be made. They are left to the candid judgment and feelings of the public.

&#x27; From the Evening Post. *  
The statement containing the facts that  
led to the interview between General Ha­  
milton and Colonel Burr, published in&#x27;the  
Evening Post on Monday last, studiously  
avoided mentioning any pardfeulars of what  
past at the place of meeting. This was  
dictated by suitable considerations at the  
time, and with the intention, that, whate­  
ver it might be deemed proper to lav before  
the publick, should be made the subject of  
a communication. The flowing is there­  
fore now submitted.  
In the interviews that have since taken  
place between the gentlemen that were pre­  
sent, they have not been able to agree in  
two important facts that passed there—for  
which reason nothing was said on those  
subjects, in the paper lately published as to  
other particulars in which they were a­  
greed.  
Mr. Pendleton expressed a confident opi­  
nion that General Hamilton did not fire  
first—and that he did not fire at ail at Co­  
lone! Burr. Mr. Van Ness, seemed e­  
quallv confident in opinion, that General  
Hamilton did fire first—and of course that  
it must have been at his antagonist.  
General Hamilton’s friend thinks it to he  
a sacred duty he owes to the memory of  
that exalted man, to his country, and his  
friends, to publish to the world, such fact*  
and circumstances, as have produced a de­  
cisive conviction in his ow n mipd, that lie  
cannot have been mistaken in the belief he  
has formed on those points—  
1st. Besides the testimonies of Bishop  
Moore, and the paper containing ait express  
declaration, under General Hamilton’s even  
hand, inclosed to his friend in a packet,  
not be delivered but in the event of his  
death, a.id wbi. h have already been pub­  
lished, General Hamilton informed iMr.  
Pendleton, at least ten davs previous to  
the affair, that he had doubts whether he  
would not receive, and not return, Mr.  
Burr’s first fire. Mr. Pencil; ten remon­  
strated against this detei mination, and ur­  
ged mnnv consideration* against it, as  
  
dangerous to hsmseil, and not necessary m  
the particular case, when every ground of  
accommodation, not humiliating, had been  
proposed and rejected. He said he would  
not decide lightly, but take time to delibe-&quot;  
rate fully. It was incidentally mentioned %  
again at their occasional subsequent con­  
versations} and on the evening preceding the  
time of the appointed interview, he infor­  
med Mr. Pendleton, he had made up his  
mind not to fire at Col. Burr the first-ti ne,  
but to receive his jire, an l fire_ i i the cir.  
Mr. Pendleton again, urged him upon  
this subject, and related his former argu­  
ments. His final a ns we r was in terms that  
made an impresson on Mr. Pendleton’s  
mind which can never be effaced. “ My ,  
friend, it is the effect of a REi.ir.iccs  
scruple, and does not admit of reason­  
ing } it is useless to say more on the sub­  
ject, as my purpose is definitive!}&#x27; fixed.”  
2d. His last words before he was wound­  
ed afford a proof that this purpose had not  
changed. When he received his pistol, ■ _  
after having taken his position, he was  
asked if he would have the. hair spring set*  
His answer was, “ not at this time.&#x27;r  
3d. After he was wounded .and laid in  
the boat, the first words he uttered after  
recovering the power of speech, (addres­  
sing himself to a gentleman present, who .  
perfectly well remembers itj Pendleton  
knows I did not mean to fire at Col. Burr  
the. fret time• ’ **  
4th. This determination had been com­  
municated by Mr. Pendleton to that gen­  
tleman that morning, before they left the  
city.  
5th. The pistol that had been used by  
General Hamilton, lying loose over the  
other apparatus in the case which wa*  
open, after having been sometime in the  
boat, one of the bc &#x27;tmen took hold of it to  
put it into the case. General Hamilton ob­  
serving this* said “ Take care of that pis­  
tol—-it is cocked—it may go off and do mis­  
chief. This.is also remembered by lne  
gentleman,alluded to. •„. ,  
This shews that he was not sensible of  
having fired at all. , If he had fired previ­  
ous to receiving the wound, he would have  
remembered it, and therefore have known f  
that the pistol ,cou!4 not go off j but if of-,  
terwards it must have been the effect of an *  
involuntary exertion of the muscles, pro- ;  
duced. by a mortal wound, in jphieh case i  
he could not have been conscious of- hav­  
..ing fire^. y ■■ W) *

6th Mr. Pendleton having so strong a  
conviction that if G« teral Hamilton had  
fired first, it could, not have escaped his at­

effect of the %st fire) and having no rea­

The ftatement containing the fafts that led to  
the interview between Gen. Hamilton and Col.  
Burr, publiflied in the Evening Poll on Monday

fubmitted.  
In the interviews that have fince taken place  
between the gentlemen that were prefent, they  
have not been able to agree in two important  
faifts that palLed there—for which rcafons no­

the event of his death, and which have already j  
been publifhed—General Hamilton informed  
Mr. P. at lead ten days previous to the affair,  
that he had doubts whether he would not re­

lie faid he would not decide lightly, but take  
time to deliberate fully. It was incidentally  
mentioned again at their occaftonal fiibfeqnent

time of the appointed interview, he informed  
Mr. P. he had made up his tnind not to (real Co/.

&#x27;file statement containing the fails that  
led to the interview between General Ha­  
milton and Col Burr, published in the E- I  
vetting Post on Monday last, studiously j  
avoided mentioning any particular of:  
what past nt the place of meeting. This  
was dictated by suitable considerations at  
liie time, and with the intention, that  
whatever it might be deemed proper to lay  
before the pubi c, should be made the sub­  
jtil of a future communication. The  
following is therefore now submitted.  
In the interviews that have since taken j  
placa between the gentlemen that were  
present, they have not been able to agree in  
two important fails that passed there—  
for which reason nothing was said on those  
aubjeils in the paper lately published as  
to other particulars in which they were  
agreed.  
Mr. P. expressed a confident opinion  
that General Hamilton did not fire first—  
and that be did not fire at idiaf Col. burr.  
Mr. V. N. seemed equally confident in  
opinion that General H did fire first— ;  
and of course that it must have been at  
his antagonist.  
General Hamilton&#x27;s friend thinks it to  
he a sacred duty he owes to the memory  
of that exalted man, to his country, and  
his friends, to publish to the world such  
f.6ls and circumstances as have produced  
a decisive conviction in bis own mind,  
tlrat lie cannot have been mistaken in the  
belief he has formed on those points— \
1st. Besides the testimonies of Bishop |  
Moore, and the paper containing an ex  
press declaration, under General Ilamil  
ton’s own hand, inclosed to his friend in I  
a packet, not to be delivered but its the  
event of his death, and which have al- j  
ready been published, General Hamilton j  
informed Mr. P. at least ten days previ­  
ous to the affair, that he had doubts whe- j  
ther he would not receive and not return  
Mr. Burr’s first fire. Mr. P. remonstra ;  
ted against this determination, and urged  
many considerations against it, as dange  
rous ti himself and not necessary in the  
particular case, when every giound of ac- .  
commodaiion, not humiliating, had been \
aiwl I-I — aoi/t 1.&amp; i  
  
not decide lightly, but take time to dtli- j  
Iterate fully. It was incidentally mentioned  
again at (heir occasional subsequent con- 1  
versations, and on the evening preceding  
the lime of the appointed interview, he  
informed Mr. P. he had made op his  
mind not t% fire at Col. Purr the first time,  
but to recrive hit fire, and fire in the air.  
Mr. P. again urged him upon this sub  
je£l. and repeated his former arguments.  
His final answer was in terms that made  
an impression on Mr. P’s. mind which  
can never be effaced. “ Mjr friend it is  
the cffefcl of a asLiaious scRumr, and  
does not admit of reasoning ; it is useless  
to say more on the subject, as my pur­  
pose is definitively fixed.&quot;  
2d. His last words before he was wound­  
ed afford a proof that this purpose had  
not changed. When lie received his pis­  
tol, after having taken his position, he  
was asked if he would have the hair sprig  
set ?—His answer was “Acit thin time.&quot;  
Sd. After he was wounded, and laid in  
die boat, the first words be uttered after  
recovering the power of speech, were,  
(addressing Iiimseif to a gentleman pre­  
sent, who perfe£llv well remembers it)  
“ Pendleton know* I did not mean to Jire at  
Col. Purr the firtt time.&quot;  
♦lb. This determination had been com­  
municated by Mr. P. to that gentleman  
that morning, before they left the city.  
5th. The pistol that had been used by J  
General Hamilton, lying loose over the  
other apparatus in the cate which was o­  
pen ; after having been some time in the  
boat, one of the boatmen took hold of it  
to put it into the case. General Hamil­  
ton observing this, said “ Take care of that  
fiitttl—it it cocked—it may go vjf and do  
mite hi ef.&quot; rl his is alio remembered by  
the gentleman alluded to.  
This shews that he was not sensible of  
having fired at all. If he bad fired fire­  
vitut to receiving the wound lie would have  
remembered it, and therefore have known  
that the pistol could not go off; but if af  
terward* it must have been the effefl of  
an involuntary exertion of the muHclcs  
produced by a mortal wound, in which  
case, be could not have been conscious of  
having fired.  
5th. Mr. P. having a strong convi6\i­  
on that if General Hamilton bad fired  
fiist, it could not have escaped bis atten­  
tion, nil bis anxiety being alive for the ef­  
fect of the first fire, and having no reason  
to bebeve the frie nd of Co). Burr was not  
sincere in the contrary opinion,) he deter­  
mined to go to the spot where the affair 1  
took place, to see if he could not discover *  
f ome traces of the course of the ball from j  
General Hamilton’s pistol, lie took a  
friend with him the day after General Ha­  
milton died, and after some examination  
they fortunately found what they were in

by Gen. Hamilton, lying loose over  
the other apparatus in the case,  
which was open rafter having been  
some time in the boat, one of the  
boatmen toofc noid ot it to; put it in

said &quot; take care of that pistol it is&#x27;  
cock&#x27;d It may go off and do mis-1  
chief.&quot; This is also reme mbered by  
the gentleman alluded to. j  
This shews that he was jhot sensi­  
ble of having fired at all.! flf he had  
fired previous to receivingjthe wound,  
he would have remembered it, and  
therefore, have known that! the pistol  
could not go Off ; but if afterwards, it  
must have been an involuntary ex­  
ertion of the muscles produced by a  
mortal wound, in which j case, he  
could not have been conscious of ha­  
ving fired. I J

Jum the &#x27;day: after Gen. Hamilton

&quot;The statement containing the facts that  
led to the interview between General Ham  
ilton and Colonel Burr, published In the  
Evening Tost on Monday last, studiously  
avoided mentioning any particulars of  
what passed at the place of meeting. This  
was dictated by suitable considerations at  
the time and with the Intention that what  
ever might, be deemed proper to lay before  
tho public should be made the subject of  
a future communication- In the inter  
views that have since taken place between  
the gentlemen that were present they have  
not oeen aoie to agree in two important  
facts that passed there, for which reason  
nothing was said on those subjects .
