Jan. 26. Colo Burr the V.P. calls on me in the evening, having previously asked an opportunity of conversing with me. he began by recapitulating summarily that he had come to N.Y. a stranger some years ago, that he found the country in possn of two rich families, (the Livingstons &amp; Clintons) that his pursuits were not political &amp; he meddled not. when the crisis however of 1800. came on, they found their influence worn out, &amp; sollicited his aid with the people. he lent it without any views of promotion. that his being named as a candidate for V.P. was unexpected by him. he acceded to it with a view to promote my fame &amp; advancement and from a desire to be with me, whose company &amp; conversation had always been fascinating to him. that since that those great families had become hostile to him, and had excited the calumnies which I had seen published. that in this Hamilton had joined and had even written some of the pieces against him. that his attachment to me had been sincere and was still unchanged, altho many little stories had been carried to him, &amp; he supposed to me also, which he despised, but that attachments must be reciprocal or cease to exist, and therefore he asked if any change had taken place in mine towards him: that he had chosen to have this conversn with myself directly &amp; not through any intermediate agent. he reminded me of a letter written to him about the time of counting the votes (say Feb. 1801) mentioning that I his election had left a chasm in my arrangements, that I had lost him from my list in the admn, &amp;c. he observed he believed it would be for the interest of the republican cause for him to retire; that a disadvantageous schism would otherwise take place; but that were he to retire, it would be said he shrunk from the public sentence, which he never would do; that his enemies were using my name to destroy him, and something was necessary from me to prevent and deprive them of that weapon, some mark of favor from me, which would declare to the world that he retired with my confidence. I answered by recapitulating to him what had been my conduct previous to the election of 1800. that I never had interfered directly or indirectly with my friends or any others, to influence the election either for him or myself; that I considered it as my duty to be merely passive, except that, in Virginia, I had taken some measures to procure for him the unanimous vote of that state, because I thought any failure there might be imputed to me. that in the election now coming on, I was observing the same conduct, held no councils with any body respecting it, nor suffered any one to speak to me on the subject, believing it my duty to leave myself to the free discussion of the public: that I do not at this moment know, nor have ever heard who were to be proposed as candidates for the public choice, except so far as could be gathered from the newspapers. that as to the attack excited against him in the newspapers, I had noticed it but as the passing wind; that I had seen complaints that Cheetham, employed in publishing the laws, should be permitted to eat the publick bread &amp; abuse it’s second officer: that as to this, the publishers of the laws were appd by the Secy. of state, witht. any reference to me; that to make the notice general, it was often given to one republican &amp; one federal printer of the same place, that these federal printers did not in the least intermit their abuse of me, tho’ recieving emoluments from the govmt, and that I had never thot it proper to interfere for myself, &amp; consequently not in the case of the Vicepresident. that as to the letter he referred to, I remembered it, and believed he had only mistaken the date at which it was written; that I thought it must have been on the first notice of the event of the election of S. Carolina; and that I had taken that occasion to mention to him that I had intended to have proposed to him one of the great offices, if he had not been elected, but that his election in giving him a higher station had deprived me of his aid in the administration. the letter alluded to was in fact mine to him of Dec. 15. 1800. I now went on to explain to him verbally what I meant by saying I had lost him from my list. that in Genl Washington’s time it had been signified to him that mr Adams, then V. President, would be glad of a foreign embassy; that Genl. Washington mentd it to me, expressed his doubts whether mr Adams was a fit character for such an office, &amp; his still greater doubts, indeed his conviction that it would not be justifiable to send away the person who, in case of his death, was provided by the constn, to take his place; that it would moreover appear indecent for him to be disposing of the public trusts in apparently buying off a competitor for the public favor. I concurred with him in the opinion, and, if I recollect rightly, Hamilton, Knox &amp; Randolph were consulted &amp; gave the same opinions. that when mr Adams came to the admn, in his first interview with me he mentioned the necessity of a mission to France, and how desireable it would have been to him if he could have got me to undertake it; but that he concieved it would be wrong in him to send me away, and assigned the same reasons Genl Washington had done; and therefore he should appoint mr Madison &amp;c. that I had myself contemplated his (Colo. Burr’s) appointment to one of the great offices; in case he were not elected V.P. but that as soon as that election was known, I saw it could not be done for the good reasons which had led Genl. W. &amp; mr A. to the same conclusion, and therefore in my first letter to Colo. Burr after the issue was known, I had mentioned to him that a chasm in my arrangements had been produced by this event. I was thus particular in rectifying the date of this letter, because it gave me an opportunity of explaining the grounds on which it was written which were indirectly an answer to his present hints. he left the matter with me for consideration &amp; the conversation was turned to indifferent subjects. I should here notice that Colo. Burr must have thot I could swallow strong things in my own favor, when he founded his acquiescence in the nominn as V.P. to his desire of promoting my honor, the being with me whose company &amp; conversn had always been fascinating to him &amp;c. I had never seen Colo. B. till he came as a member of Senate. his conduct very soon inspired me with distrust. I habitually cautioned mr Madison against trusting him too much. I saw afterwards that under Genl. W’s and mr A’s admns, whenever a great military appmt or a diplomatic one was to be made, he came post to Philada to shew himself, &amp; in fact that he was always at market, if they had wanted him. he was indeed told by Dayton in 1800. he might be Secy. at war: but this bid was too late. his election as V.P. was then foreseen. with these impressions of Colo. Burr there never had been an intimacy between us, and but little association. when I destined him for a high appmt, it was out of respect for the favor he had obtained with  the republican party  by his extraordinary exertions and success in the N.Y. election in 1800.

&quot;January the 26th. Colonel Burr, the Vice  
&#x27; President, calla on me in the evening, having  
&#x27; previously asked an opportunity of conversing  
with me. He began by recapitulating summa-  
rilyt that he had come to New York a stranger,  
- some years ago; that lie found the country in  
possession of two rich families, (the Livingstons  
&#x27; and Clintons) ; that his pursuits were not politi­  
cal, and he meddled not. When the crisis,  
however, of 1800 came on, they found their in-  
&#x27; fluenc worn out, and solicited his aid with the  
people. He lent it without any views of pro-  
motion. That his being named as a candidate  
for Vice President, was unexpected by him.  
He acceded to it with a view to promote my  
fame and advancement, and from a desire to be  
with me, whose company and conversation had  
always been fascinating to him. That since,  
those great families had become hostile to him,  
and had excited the calumnies which I had soen  
published. That in this Hamilton had joined,  
and had even written some of the pieces against  
him. That his attachment to me had been sin­  
cere, and was still unchanged, although many  
little stories had been carried to him, and he  
.supposed to roe also, which he despised; but  
that attachments must be reciprocal or cease to  
exist, and therefore he asked if any change had  
  
taken place in mine towards him ; that he had  
chosen to have this conversation with myself di­  
rectly, and not through any intermediate agent.  
He reminded me of a letter written to him about  
the time of counting the votes, (say February,  
1801,) mentioning that his election had left a  
chasm in my arrangements ; that I had lost him  
from my list in the administration, Sec. He ob  
  
served, he believed it would be for the interest  
of the republican cause fur himjto retire; that a  
disadvantageous schism would otherwise take  
place ; but that were lie to retire, it would be  
said he shrunk from the public sentence, which  
he never would do ; that his enemies were using  
my name to destroy him, and something was ne­  
cessary from me to prevent and deprive them  
of that weapon, some mark of favour from me  
which would declare to the world that he retired  
with my confidence.  
&quot; I answered by recapitulating to him what had  
been my conduct previous to the election of 1 800.  
That I had never interfered directly or indi­  
rectly with my friends or any others, to influence  
the election either for him or myself; that I  
xonsidered it as my duty to be merely passive,  
except that in Virginia, I had taken some mea­  
sures to procure for him the unanimous vote of  
that State, because I thought any failure there  
might be imputed to me. That in the election  
now coming on, I was observing the same con­  
duct, held no councils with any body respecting  
it, nor suffered any one to speak to me on the  
subject, believing it my duty to leave myself to  
the free discussion of the public; that I do not  
at this moment know, nor have ever heard, who  
were to be proposed as candidates for the public  
choice, except so far as could be gathered from  
the newspapers. That as to the attack excited  
against him in the newspapers, I had noticed it  
but as the passing wind ; that I had seen com­  
plaints that Cheetham, employed in publishing  
  
trie laws, snouiu ue permmeu to eai me puunc  
bread and abuse its second officer : that as to  
this, the publishers of the laws were appointed  
by the Secretary of Staic, without any reference  
  
to me; that to make the notice general, it was  
often eiven to one republican and one federal  
  
printer of the same place; that these federal

of me, though receiving emoluments from the  
  
government, and that I had never thought it  
proper to interfere for myself, and consequently  
not in the case of the Vice President. That as  
  
to the letter he referred to, I remembered it,  
  
and believed he had only mistaken the date at  
which it was written ; that I thought it must  
  
have been on the first notice of the event of the  
election of South Carolina ; and that I had taken  
  
that occasion to mention to him. that I had in  
  
ien(fe3 to have proposed to him one of the great  
  
offices, if he had not been elected; but that his  
election in giving him a higher station had de-  
  
nrived me of his aid in the administration. 1 he  
  
letter alluded to was, in fact, mine to him of De  
ceiiiber the 15th, 1800. I now went on to ex  
  
olain to him verbally, what I meant by saving I  
  
had lost him from my list. That in General  
Washington&#x27;s time, it had been signified to him  
that Mr. Adams; the Vice President, would be  
L&#x27;lad of a foreign ombassy ; that General Wash  
  
ington mentioned it to me, expressed his doubts  
whether Mr. Adams was a fit character for such  
an ofliee, and his still greater doubts, indeed, his  
  
conviction, that it would not be justiUaDle to  
tend away the person who, in esse of his death,  
was provided by the constitution to take his  
plac- ; that it would moreover appear indecent  
  
for hint to be disposing of the public trusts, in  
  
apparently buying on a competitor for the.pubiic  
  
favour. I concurred with him in the opinion,  
and, if I recollect rightly, Hamilton, Knox and  
  
Randolph were consulted and gave the same  
  
opinions. 1 hat when Mr. Adams came to the  
administration, in his first interview with me, he  
  
mentioned the necessity of a mission to France,  
  
and how desirable it would have been to him if  
  
he could have got me to undertake it ; but that  
he conceived it would be wrong in him to send  
  
me away, and assigned the same reasons General  
Washington had done; and thorefore, ho should  
  
appoint Mr. Madison, &amp;c. That I had myself  
  
contemplated his (Colonel Burr s) appointment  
to one of the great offices, in case he was not  
elected Vice President; but that as soon as that  
  
election was known, I saw it could not be done,  
fot the (rood reasons which had led General  
  
Washington and Mr. Adams to the same con  
  
elusion : and therofore. in mv first letter to  
  
Colonel Rnrr. nftnr the? issun was known. I had  
  
pbentioned to him that a chasm in my arrange  
  
ments had been produced br this event. I was  
  
thus particular in rectifying the date of this let&#x27;  
er, because it gave me an opportunity, of ex  
  
plaining the grounds on which it was written,  
  
which were, indirectly, an answer to his present  
hints. He left the matter with mo for consi­  
deration, and the&#x27; conversation was turned to  
indifferent subjects. I should here notice,&#x27; that  
Colonel Burr must have thought I could swallow  
strong things in my own favour, when he found­  
ed his acquiescence in the nomination as Vice  
President, to his desire of promoting my honour,  
the being with me, whose company and conver­  
sation had always been fascinating with him, &amp;c.  
I had never seen Colonel Burr till he came as a  
member of Senate. His conduct very soon in­  
spired me with distrust. I habitually cautioned  
Mr. Madison against trusting him too much. I  
saw afterwards, that under General Washing­  
ton&#x27;s and Mr. Adams&#x27; administrations, whenever  
a great military appointment Or a diplomatic one  
was to be made, he came post to Philadelphia  
to show himself, and in fact that he was always  
at market, if they had wanted him. He was  
indeed told by Dayton in 1800, he might be  
Secretary at War; but this bid was too late.  
His election as Vice President was then fore­  
seen. With these impressions of Colonel Burr,  
there never had been an intimacy between us,  
and but little association. When I destined him  
for a high appointment, it was out of respect for  
the favour he had obtained with the republican  
party, by his extraordinary exertions and suc­  
cess in the New York election in 1800.

#### 1893-01-01 &middot; [New-York [N.Y.]](http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City)

“Col. Burr, the Viee President, calls on me in  
the evening, having previously asked an oppor-  
tunity of conversing with me. He began by re-  
capitulating summarily that he had come to  
New-York a stranger some years ago, that he  
found the ogre! in possession of two rich  
families, (the Livingstons and Clintons,) that  
his pursuits were not political, and he meddled  
mot. When the crisis, however, of 1800 came  
on they found their influence worn out and so-  
Jicited his aid with tis people. He lent it with-  
out any views of promotion. That his being  
named as a candidate for Vice President  
‘Was unexpected by him. He acceded to it  
with a view to promote my fame and advance-  
ment and from a desire to be with me, whose  
company and conversation had always been  
fascinating to him. That ¢ince those great fami-  
Jies had become hostile to him, and had excited  
the calumnies which 1 had seen published.  
That in this Hamilton had joined and had even  
‘written some of the pieces against him. That  
his attachment to me had been sincere and was  
gtill unchanged, although many little stories  
had been carried to him, and he supposed to me  
also, which he despised. But that attachments  
must be reciprocal or cease to exist, and there-  
fore he asked if any change had taken place in  
mine toward him; that he had chosen to have  
this conversation with myself directly, and not  
through any intermediate agent.  
  
“ He sominded me of a letter written to him  
about the time of counting the votes, (say Feb-  
ruary, 1801,) mentioning that his election had  
lefta chasm in my arrangements, that I had  
lost him from my list in the Administration, 4c.  
He observed he believed it would be for the in-  
terest of the Republican cause for him to retire;  
that a disadvantageous schism would otherwise  
fake place, but that were he to revire it would  
be said he shrunk from the public service,  
which he never would do; that his enemies  
Were using my name to destroy him, and some-  
thing was necessary from me te prevent and  
fieptive them of that weapon, some mark of  
favor from me which would declare to the world  
that he retired with my confidence.  
  
“Lapswered by recapitulating to him what  
had been my conduct previous to the election  
of 1800; that I never had interfered, directiy  
or indirectly, with my friends or any others to  
infinence the election either for him or myself;  
that I considered it as my duty to be merely  
passive except that,in Virginia, I had taken  
some measures to procure for him the unani-  
mous vote of that State because I thought any  
failure there might be imputed to me; ~ * *  
that I had myself contemplated his appoint-  
ment to one of the great offices in case  
he was not elected Vice President, but  
@hat as soon as that election was known  
  
Il saw it could not be done for the  
good reasons which had led Gen. W. and Mr. A.  
to the same conclusion, and therefore, in my  
first letter to Col. Burr after the issue was known  
J had mentioned to him that a chasm in my ar-  
Tangements had been produced by this event.  
I was thus particular in rectifying the date of  
this letter because it gave Me an opportunity of  
explaining the grounds on whichit was written,  
  
hich were indirectly an anewer to his previous  
  
Teese He left the matter with me for consid-  
eration, and the conversation turned to indiffer-  
  
subjects.  
  
wo, sboutd “here notice that Col. Burr must  
have thought that I could swallow strong  
things in my own favor when he founded his  
acquiescence ir the nomination as Vice President  
to his desire of promoting my honor, the being  
‘with me whose company and conversation had  
always been fascinating to him, &amp;e. i had  
never seeu Col. Burr till he came as a member  
of the Senate. His conduct very soon inspired  
mé with distrust. I habitually cautioned Mir.  
Madison against trusting him too much. I saw  
iterward that under Gen. W.’s and Mr. A.’s Ad-  
mini@trations, whenever a great military ay-  
ntment or a diplomatic one war ito  
made, he came first to Remeteiphis to  
w#show himeel!, and, in fact, that he siwars was  
mt market, if they wanted him. He was, indeed,  
told by Dayton in 1801 he might be Secretary  
of War; but this bid was too late. Wis election  
  
. @&amp; Viee President was then foreseen, With these  
  
  
  
impressions of Col. Burr there never had  
  
any intimacy between us, and but little  
  
tion. When I destined him fora high 8  
  
ment it was out of respect for the favor  
obtained with the Republican Party by nie ex-  
traordinary exertions and successes in the New-  
York in 1800.
