earest Friend  
  
Sunday June 18 1775  
  
  
The Day; perhaps the decisive Day is come on which the fate of America depends. My bursting Heart must find vent at my pen. I have just heard that our dear Friend Dr. Warren is no more but fell gloriously fighting for his Country—saying better to die honourably in the field than ignominiously hang upon the Gallows. Great is our Loss. He has distinguished himself in every engagement, by his courage and fortitude, by animating the Soldiers and leading them on by his own example. A particuliar account of these dreadful, but I hope Glorious Days will be transmitted you, no doubt in the exactest manner.  
The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Trust in him at all times, ye people pour out your hearts before him. God is a refuge for us.—Charlstown is laid in ashes. The Battle began upon our intrenchments upon Bunkers Hill, a Saturday morning about 3 o clock and has not ceased yet and tis now 3 o’clock Sabbeth afternoon.  
Tis expected they will come out over the Neck to night, and a dreadful Battle must ensue. Almighty God cover the heads of our Country men, and be a shield to our Dear Friends. How many have fallen we know not—the constant roar of the cannon is so distressing that we can not Eat, Drink or Sleep. May we be supported and sustaind in the dreadful conflict. I shall tarry here till tis thought unsafe by my Friends, and then I have secured myself a retreat at your Brothers who has kindly offerd me part of his house. I cannot compose myself to write any further at present. I will add more as I hear further.  
  
  
Tuesday afternoon 20 June  
  
I have been so much agitated that I have not been able to write since Sabbeth day. When I say that ten thousand reports are passing vague and uncertain as the wind I believe I speak the Truth. I am not able to give you any authentick account of last Saturday, but you will not be destitute of inteligence. Coll. Palmer has just sent me word that he has an opportunity of conveyance. Incorrect as this scrawl will be, it shall go. I wrote you last Saturday morning. In the afternoon I received your kind favour of the 2 june, and that you sent me by Captn. Beals at the same time.—I ardently pray that you may be supported thro the arduous task you have before you. I wish I could contradict the report of the Doctors Death, but tis a lamentable Truth, and the tears of multitudes pay tribute to his memory. Those favorite lines of Collin continually sound in my Ears  
  
How sleep the Brave who sink to rest,  
By all their Countrys wishes blest?  
When Spring with dew’ey fingers cold  
Returns to deck their Hallowed mould  
She their shall dress a sweeter Sod  
Than fancys feet has ever trod.  
By fairy hands their knell is rung  
By forms unseen their Dirge is sung  
Their There Honour comes a pilgrim grey  
To Bless the turf that wraps their Clay  
And freedom shall a while repair  
To Dwell a weeping Hermit there.  
  
I rejoice in the prospect of the plenty you inform me of, but cannot say we have the same agreable veiw here. The drought is very severe, and th

Dearest Friend: The day, per  
  
haps the decisive day, is come on  
  
which the fate of America depends.  
  
My bursting heart must find ventat

dear friend, Dr. Warren, 13 no more,  
  
but fell gloriously fighting for his coun  
  
try ; saying better to die honorably in  
  
the field than ignominiously hangup  
  
on the gallows. Great is our loss.  
He has distinguished himself in every  
  
engagement, by his courage and forti­  
tude, by animating the soldiers and  
  
leading them on by his own example  
A particular account of these dreadful  
  
but I Rope glorious, days will be trans  
  
mitted to you, no doubt, in the exact  
  
est manner.  
  
&quot; The race is not to the swift northe  
  
battle to the strong, but the God of Is  
  
rael is he that giveth strength and pow  
  
er to his people. Irust in him at al  
  
times, ye people, pour out your hearts  
  
before him. God is a refugejor us.  
  
Charlestown is laid in ashes. The  
  
battle began upon our entrenchment  
  
upon Bunker s Hill Saturday mor  
  
ning about three o&#x27;clock, and has not  
  
ceased yet, and it is now three o&#x27;clock  
  
Sabbath afternoon.  
  
It is expected that they will come  
  
out over the Neck to-night, and a dread-  
  
ul battle must ensue. Almighty God,  
  
cover the heads of our countrymen,  
and be as a shield to our dear friends &#x27;  
  
Flow many have fallen we know not.  
  
The constant roar of the cannon is so  
distressing, that we cannot eat, diink  
or sleep. May we be supported and  
  
sustained m the dreadful conflict : 1  
  
shall tarry here till it is thought unsafe  
  
by my friends, and then 1 have secur  
  
ed myself a retreat at your brother&#x27;s,

friend, Dr. Warren, is no more, but fell gloriously fighting for  
his country ; saying, ‘‘ Better to die honorably in the field,  
than ignominiously to hang upon the gallows.’’ Great is our  
loss. He has distinguished himself in every engagement, by  
his courage and fortitude, by animating the soldies and lead-  
ing them on by his own example. A particular account of  
these dreadful, but I hope glorious days, will be transmitted  
you no doubt in the exactest manner.  
  
‘The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong,  
but the God of Israel is He that giveth strength and power  
unto His people, pour out your hearts before Him; God is a  
refuge for us.’’ Charlestown is laid in ashes. The battle be-  
gan upon Bunker’s Hill Saturday morning about 3 o&#x27;clock,  
and has not ceased yet, and it is now 3 o’clock Sabbath after.  
noon.  
  
‘Tt is expected they will come over the Neck to-night and  
a dreadful battle must ensue. Almighty God, cover the heads  
of our countrymen, and be a shield to our dear friends! How  
many have fallen we know not. The constant roar of the  
cannon is so distressing that we cannot eat, drink or sleep.  
May we be supported and sustained in the dreadful conflict. I  
shall tarry here until it is thought unsafe by my friends, and  
then I have secured myself a retreat at your brother’s, who  
has kindly offered me a part of his house. I cannot compose  
myself to write any further at present. I will add more as I  
hear further.”’ :
