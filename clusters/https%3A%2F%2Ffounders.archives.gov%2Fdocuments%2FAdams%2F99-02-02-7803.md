 of the world; but a dæmon of malignant spirit. it would be more pardonable to believe in no god at all, than to blaspheme him by the atrocious attributes of Calvin. indeed I think that every Christian sect gives a great handle to Atheism by their general dogma that, without a revelation, there would not be sufficient proof of the being of a god. now one sixth of mankind only are supposed to be Christians: the other five sixths then, who do not believe in the Jewish and Christian revelation, are without a knolege of the existence of a god! this gives compleatly a gain de cause to the disciples of Ocellus, Timaeus, Spinosa, Diderot and D’Holbach. the argument which they rest on as triumphant and unanswerable is that, in every hypothesis of Cosmogony you must admit an eternal pre-existence of something; and according to the rule of sound philosophy, you are never to employ two principles to solve a difficulty when one will suffice. they say then that it is more simple to believe at once in the eternal pre-existence of the world, as it is now going on, and may for ever go on by the principle of reproduction which we see and witness, than to believe in the eternal pre-existence of an ulterior cause, or Creator of the world, a being whom we see not, and know not, of whose form substance and mode or place of existence, or of action no sense informs us, no power of the mind enables us to delineate or comprehend.

Extract of a letter to Jon~ Apawms, dated  
Monrvicewro, Apnl Ll, 1823,  
One sixth of mankind only are suppo­  
sed to be Christinns : the other five rixths  
then, who do not believe in the Jewish  
aud Christian revelation, are without o |  
knowledge of the existence of a God ! &#x27;  
This gives comepletely a gain de cause  
to the disciples of Ocellus, Timeus, Spi­  
nosa, Diderot, and D’Holhach. The ar­  
gument which they rest on as triuniph­  
ant and unanswerable is, that in every!  
hypothesis of cosmogony, you must ad­  
mit an eternal pre-existence of some­  
thing ; and according to the rule of sound  
philosophy, you are never to employ two  
principles to solve a difficulty when one  
will suffice. They sny then, thet it is  
more simple to believe at once in the  
eterual pre-existence of the world, as it  
it now going on, and may for ever go on  
by the principle of reproduction which  
we see and witness, than to believe 1n  
the eternal pre-existence of an ulterior  
cause, or creator of the world, n being  
whom we see not and konow not, of  
whose form, substance, and mode, or  
ph\ce of existence, or of nction, no sense  
informs us, no power of the mind ena­  
bles us to delineate or comprehend.  
The truth is, that the greatest enemies  
to the doctrines of Jesus are those call­  
ing themselves the expositors of them,  
who have perverted them for the struc­  
ture of a system of funcy absolutely in­  
comprehensible, and without any foun­  
dation in his genuine words. And the  
day will come, when the mystical gene­  
ration of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as  
his futlier, in the womb of a virgin, will  
be classed with the fable of the gevera­  
tion of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.
