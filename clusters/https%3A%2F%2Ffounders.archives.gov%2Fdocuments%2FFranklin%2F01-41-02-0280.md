REMARKS  
CONCERNING THE SAVAGES OF NORTH-AMERICA.  
  
  
  
Savages we call them, because their manners differ from ours, which we think the Perfection of Civility; they think the same of theirs.  
Perhaps if we could examine the manners of different Nations with Impartiality, we should find no People so rude as to be without Rules of Politeness; nor any so polite as not to have some remains of Rudeness.  
The Indian Men, when young, are Hunters and Warriors; when old, Counsellors; for all their Government is by the Counsel or Advice of the Sages; there is no Force, there are no Prisons, no Officers to compel Obedience, or inflict Punishment. Hence they generally study Oratory; the best Speaker having the most Influence. The Indian Women till the Ground, dress the Food, nurse and bring up the Children, &amp; preserve &amp; hand down to Posterity the Memory of Public Transactions. These Employments of Men and Women are accounted natural and honorable. Having few Artificial Wants, they have abundance of Leisure for Improvement by Conversation. Our laborious manner of Life compared with theirs, they esteem slavish and base; and the  
  
Learning on which we value ourselves; they regard as frivolous and useless. An Instance of this occurred at the Treaty of Lancaster in Pennsylvania, Anno 1744, between the Government of Virginia &amp; the Six Nations. After the principal Business was settled, the Commissioners from Virginia acquainted the Indians by a Speech, that there was at Williamsburg a College with a Fund for Educating Indian Youth, and that if the Chiefs of the Six-Nations would send down half a dozen of their sons to that College, the Government would take Care that they should be well provided for, and instructed in all the Learning of the white People. It is one of the Indian Rules of Politeness not to answer a public Proposition the same day that it is made; they think it would be treating it as a light Matter; and that they show it Respect by taking time to consider it, as of a Matter important. They therefore deferred their Answer till the day following; when their Speaker began by expressing their deep Sense of the Kindness of the Virginia Government, in making them that Offer; for we know, says he, that you highly esteem the kind of Learning taught in those Colleges, and that the Maintenance of our Young Men while with you, would be very expensive to you. We are convinced therefore that you mean to do us Good by your Proposal, and we thank you heartily. But you who are wise must know, that different Nations have different Conceptions of things; and you will therefore not take it amiss, if our Ideas of this Kind of Education happen not to be the same with yours. We have had some Experience of it: Several of our Young People were formerly brought up at the Colleges of the Northern Provinces; they were instructed in all your Sciences; but when they came back to us they were bad Runners, ignorant of every means of living in the Woods, unable to bear either Cold or Hunger, knew neither how to build a Cabin, take a Deer, or  
  
kill an Enemy, spoke our Language imperfectly; were therefore neither fit for Hunters, Warriors, or Counsellors; they were totally good for nothing. We are however not the less obliged by your kind Offer, tho’ we decline accepting it; and to show our grateful Sense of it, if the Gentlemen of Virginia will send us a dozen of their Sons, we will take great Care of their Education, instruct them in all we know, and make Men of them.  
Having frequent Occasions to hold public Councils, they have acquired great Order and Decency in conducting them. The old Men sit in the foremost Ranks, the Warriors in the next, and the Women and Children in the hindmost. The Business of the Women is to take exact notice of what passes, imprint it in their Memories, for they have no Writing, and communicate it to their Children. They are the Records of the Council, and they preserve Tradition of the Stipulations in Treaties a hundred Years back, which when we compare with our Writings we always find exact. He that would speak, rises. The rest observe a profound Silence. When he has finish’d and sits down, they leave him five or six Minutes to recollect, that if he has omitted any thing he intended to say, or has any thing to add, he may rise again and deliver it. To interrupt another, even in common Conversation, is reckoned highly indecent. How different this is from the Conduct of a polite British House of Commons, where scarce a day passes without some Confusion that makes the Speaker hoarse in calling to order; and how different from the mode of Conversation in many polite Companies of Europe, where if you do not deliver your Sentence with great Rapidity, you are cut off in the middle of it by the impatient Loquacity of those you converse with, &amp; never suffer’d to finish it.  
The Politeness of these Savages in Conversation is indeed carried to excess, since it does not permit them to contradict, or deny the Truth of what is asserted in their Presence. By this means they indeed avoid Disputes, but then it becomes difficult to know their Minds, or what Impression you make upon them. The Missionaries who have attempted to convert them to  
  
Christianity, all complain of this as one of the great Difficulties of their Mission. The Indians hear with Patience the Truths of the Gospel explained to them, and give their usual Tokens of Assent and Approbation: you would think they were convinced. No such Matter. It is mere Civility.  
A Suedish Minister having assembled the Chiefs of the Sasquehanah Indians, made a Sermon to them, acquainting them with the principal historical Facts on which our Religion is founded, such as the Fall of our first Parents by Eating an Apple, the Coming of Christ to repair the Mischief, his Miracles and Suffering, &amp;c. When he had finished, an Indian Orator stood up to thank him. What you have told us, says he, is all very good. It is indeed bad to eat Apples. It is better to make them all into Cyder. We are much obliged by your Kindness in coming so far to tell us those things which you have heard from your Mothers. In return I will tell you some of those we have heard from ours.  
In the Beginning our Fathers had only the Flesh of Animals to subsist on, and if their Hunting was unsuccessful, they were starving. Two of our young Hunters having killed a Deer, made a Fire in the Woods to broil some Parts of it. When they were about to satisfy their Hunger, they beheld a beautiful young Woman descend from the Clouds, and seat herself on that Hill which you see yonder among the blue Mountains. They said to each other, it is a Spirit that perhaps has smelt our broiling Venison, &amp; wishes to eat of it: let us offer some to her. They presented her with the Tongue: She was pleased with the Taste of it, &amp; said, your Kindness shall be rewarded. Come to this Place after thirteen Moons, and you shall find something that will be of great Benefit in nourishing you and your Children to the latest Generations. They did so, and to their Surprise found Plants they had never seen before, but which from that ancient time have been constantly cultivated among us to our great Advantage. Where her right Hand had touch’d the Ground, they found Maize; where her left Hand had touch’d it, they found Kidney-beans; and where her Backside had sat on it, they found Tobacco. The good Missionary, disgusted with this idle Tale,  
  
said, what I delivered to you were sacred Truths; but what you tell me is mere Fable, Fiction &amp; Falsehood. The Indian offended, reply’d, my Brother, it seems your Friends have not done you Justice in your Education; they have not well instructed you in the Rules of common Civility. You saw that we who understand and practise those Rules, believed all your Stories; why do you refuse to believe ours?  
When any of them come into our Towns, our People are apt to croud round them, gaze upon them, and incommode them where they desire to be private; this they esteem great Rudeness, and the Effect of want of Instruction in the Rules of Civility and good Manners. We have, say they, as much Curiosity as you, and when you come into our Towns we wish for Opportunities of looking at you; but for this purpose we hide ourselves behind Bushes where you are to pass, and never intrude ourselves into your Company.  
Their Manner of entring one anothers Villages has likewise its Rules. It is reckon’d uncivil in travelling Strangers to enter a Village abruptly, without giving Notice of their Approach. Therefore as soon as they arrive within hearing, they stop and hollow, remaining there till invited to enter. Two old Men usually come out to them, and lead them in. There is in every Village a vacant Dwelling, called the Strangers House. Here they are placed, while the old Men go round from Hut to Hut acquainting the Inhabitants that Strangers are arrived who are probably hungry and weary; and every one sends them what he can spare of Victuals and Skins to repose on. When the Strangers are refresh’d, Pipes &amp; Tobacco are brought; and then, but not before, Conversation begins, with Enquiries who they are, whither bound, what News, &amp;c. and it usually ends with  
  
Offers of Service, if the Strangers have Occasion of Guides or any Necessaries for continuing their Journey; and nothing is exacted for the Entertainment.  
The same Hospitality, esteemed among them as a principal Virtue, is practiced by private Persons; of which Conrad Weiser, our Interpreter, gave me the following Instance. He had been naturaliz’d among the Six-Nations, and spoke well the Mohock Language. In going thro’ the Indian Country, to carry a Message from our Governor to the Council at Onondaga, he call’d at the Habitation of Canassetego, an old Acquaintance, who embraced him, spread Furs for him to sit on, placed before him some boiled Beans and Venison, and mixed some Rum and Water for his Drink. When he was well refresh’d, and had lit his Pipe, Canassetego began to converse with him, ask’d how he had fared the many Years since they had seen each other, whence he then came, what occasioned the Journey, &amp;c. &amp;c. Conrad answered all his Questions; and when the Discourse began to flag, the Indian, to continue it, said, Conrad, you have liv’d long among the white People, and know something of their Customs; I have been sometimes at Albany, and have observed that once in seven Days, they shut up their Shops and assemble all in the great House; tell me, what is it for? what do they do there? They meet there, says Conrad, to hear &amp; learn good things. I do not doubt, says the Indian, that they tell you so; they have told me the same; but I doubt the Truth of what they say, &amp; I will tell you my Reasons. I went lately to Albany to sell my Skins, &amp; buy Blankets, Knives, Powder, Rum, &amp;c. You know I used generally to deal with Hans Hanson; but I was a little inclined this time to try some other Merchants. However I called first upon Hans, and ask’d him what he would give for Beaver; He said he could not give more than four Shillings a Pound; but, says he, I cannot talk on Business now; this is the Day when we meet together to learn good things, and I am going to the Meeting. So I thought to myself since I cannot do any Business to day, I may as well go to the Meeting too; and I went with him. There stood  
  
up a Man in black, and began to talk to the People very angrily. I did not understand what he said; but perceiving that he looked much at me, &amp; at Hanson, I imagined he was angry at seeing me there; so I went out, sat down near the House, struck Fire &amp; lit my Pipe; waiting till the Meeting should break up. I thought too, that the Man had mentioned something of Beaver, and I suspected it might be the Subject of their Meeting. So when they came out I accosted any [my] Merchant; well Hans, says I, I hope you have agreed to give more than four Shillings a Pound. No, says he, I cannot give so much. I cannot give more than three Shillings and six Pence. I then spoke to several other Dealers, but they all sung the same Song, three &amp; six Pence, three &amp; six Pence. This made it clear to me that my Suspicion was right; and that whatever they pretended of Meeting to learn good things, the real Purpose was to consult, how to cheat Indians in the Price of Beaver. Consider but a little, Conrad, and you must be of my Opinion. If they met so often to learn good things, they would certainly have learnt some before this time. But they are still ignorant. You know our Practice. If a white Man in travelling thro’ our Country, enters one of our Cabins, we all treat him as I treat you; we dry him if he is wet, we warm him if he is cold, and give him Meat &amp; Drink that he may allay his Thirst and Hunger, &amp; we spread soft Furs for him to rest &amp; sleep on: We demand nothing in return*. But if I go into a white Man’s House at Albany, and ask for Victuals &amp; Drink, they say, where is your Money? and if I have none, they say, Get out, you Indian  
  
Dog. You see they have not yet learnt those little good things, that we need no Meetings to be instructed in, because our Mothers taught them to us when we were Children. And therefore, it is impossible their Meetings, should be as they say for any such purpose, or have any such Effect; they are only to contrive the Cheating of Indians in the Price of Beaver

. 1 : CONCERNING THE  
  
= S$SAVAGES OF NORTH-AMERICA.  
  
QCAVAGES we call them, becauſe their  
  
manners differ from ours, which we  
think the perfection of civility ; they  
think the ſame of theirs. | 1  
  
Perhaps if we could examine the man-  
ners of different nations with impartiality,  
we ſhould find no people ſo rude as to be  
without any rules of politeneſs; nor any  
ſo polite as not to have ſome remains of  
rudeneſs.  
  
The Indian men, when young, are  
hunters and warriors; when old, counſel-  
lors; for all their government is by the  
counſel or advice of the ſages; there is no  
  
E . force  
  
3  
force, there are no priſons, no officers to  
compel obedience, or inflict puniſhment.  
  
  
beſt ſpeaker having the moſt influence.  
The Indian women till the ground, dreſs  
the food, nurſe and bring up the children,  
and preſerve and hand down to poſterity  
  
  
employments of men and women are ac-  
counted natural and honourable. Hav-  
ing few artificial wants, they have a-  
bundance of leiſure for improvement by  
converſation. Our laborious manner of  
life compared with theirs, they eſteem  
{laviſh and baſe; and the learning on  
  
  
frivolous and uſeleſs. An inſtance of this  
occurred at the Treaty of Lancaſter in  
Pennſilvania, anno 1744, between the  
Government of Virginia and the Six Na-  
tions. After the principal buſineſs was  
ſettled, the Commiſſioners from Virginia  
acquainted the Indians by a ſpeech, that  
there was at Williamſburg a college with  
  
| | a fund,  
  
( I  
a fund, for educating} Indian youth; and  
that if the Chiefs of the Six Nations would  
ſend down half a dozen of their ſons to  
that college, the Government would take  
care that they ſhould be well proyided for,  
and inſtructed in all the learning of the  
white people. It is one of the Indian  
rules of politeneſs not to anſwer a public  
propoſition the ſame day that it is made  
they think it would be treating it as  
a light matter; and that they ſhew it  
reſpe&amp; by taking? time to conſider it, as  
of a matter important. They therefore  
deferred their anſwer till the day follow-  
ing ; when their Speaker began, by ex-  
preſſing their deep ſenſe of the kindneſs  
of the Virginia Government, in making  
them that offer; © for we know,” ſays he,  
  
  
ing taught in thoſe colleges, and that the  
„maintenance of our young men, while  
with you, would be very expenſive to  
«« you, We are convinced, therefore, that  
vou mean to do us good by your propoſal,  
E 2 Wh ©  
  
e who are wiſe muſt know, that different  
nations have different conceptions of  
  
  
take it amiſs, if our ideas of this kind of  
  
« education happen not to be the ſame  
  
  
e ence of it: Several of our young people  
were formerly brought up at the col-  
leges of the Northern Provinces; they  
&amp; were inſtructed in all your ſciences;  
but when they came back to us, they  
„were bad runners; ignorant of every  
means of living in the woods; unable to  
bear either cold or hunger; knew neither  
how to build a cabin, take a deer, or  
„kill an enemy; ſpoke our language |  
E imperfectly ; were therefore neither fit  
„ for hunters, warriors, or counſellors ;  
„ they were totally good for nothing.  
We are however not the leſs obliged by  
  
  
+ cepting it: And to ſhow our grateful  
  
  
C6- wil.  
  
46  
ee will ſend us a dozen of their ſons, we  
e will take great care of their education, in-  
e ſtruc them in all we know, and make :  
e men of 2  
  
Having frequent occaſions to hold public  
Councils, they have acquired great order  
and decency in conducting them. The Old  
Men ſit in the foremoſt ranks, the War-  
riors in the next, and the Women and  
Children in the hindmoſt. The buſineſs  
of the Women is to take exact notice of  
what paſſes, imprint it in their memories,  
for they have no writing, and communicate  
it to their Children. They are the Records  
of the Council, and they preſerve tradi-  
tion of the ſtipulations in Treaties a hun-  
dred years back; which, when we com-  
pare with our writings, we always find  
exact. He that would ſpeak, riſes. The  
reſt obſerve a profound ſilence. When he  
has finiſhed, and fits down, they leave him  
five or fix minutes to recollect, that if he  
has omitted any thing he intended to ſay,  
or has any _ to add, he may riſe again,  
  
and  
  
(a6 }  
  
and deliver it. To interrupt anotlier,  
even in common converſation, is reckoned  
highly indecent. How different this is  
from the conduct of a polite Britiſh Houſe  
of Commons, where ſcarce a day paſſes  
without ſome confuſion, that makes the  
Speaker hoarſe in calling zo order; and  
  
  
tion in many polite companies of Europe,  
where, if. you do not deliver your ſentence  
with great rapidity, you are cut off in the  
  
  
thoſe you converſe with, and never ſuffered  
to finith it.  
  
The politeneſs of theſe Savages in con-  
verſation, is, indeed, carried to exceſs; ſince  
it does not permit them to contradict, or  
deny the truth of what is aſſerted in their  
preſence. Buy this means they indeed avoid  
  
diſputes ; but then it becomes difficult to  
  
  
make upon them. The Miflionaries who  
have attempted to convert them to Chriſti-  
anity, all complain of this as one of the  
  
” great  
  
  
  
the Goſpel explained to them, and give  
their uſual tokens of aflent and approba-  
tion: You would think they were con-  
vinced. No ſuch matter. It is mere ci-  
vility. | 5  
  
A Swediſh Miniſter having aſſembled  
the Chiefs of the Saſquehanah Indians,  
made a Sermon to them, acquainting them  
with the principal hiſtorical facts on which  
our Religion is founded; ſuch as the Fall  
of our Firſt Parents by eating an Apple;  
the coming of Chriſt to repair the miſ-  
  
chief; his miracles and ſuffering, &amp;c.  
When he had finiſhed; an Indian Orator  
ſtood up to thank him. What you have  
told us,” ſays he, is all very good.  
It is indeed bad to eat apples. It is better  
&lt;&lt; to make them all into cyder. We are  
much obliged by your kindneſs in coming  
«© io far, to tell us thoſe things which you  
have heard from your Mothers. In re-  
  
&amp; turn, .  
  
5  
  
« turn, I will tell you ſome of thoſe we  
  
  
In the beginning, our Fathers had only  
« the fleſh of animals to ſubſiſt on; and if  
their hunting was unſucceſsfn], they  
„were ſtarving. Two of our young  
40 hunters having killed a deer, made a  
ei fire in the woods to broil ſome parts of  
„ it. When they were about to ſatisfy  
„ their hunger, they beheld a beautiful  
« young woman deſcend from the clouds,  
de and ſeat herſelf on that hill which you  
e ſee yonder among the Blue Mountains.  
« They ſaid to each other, it is a Spirit  
  
  
&amp; ſon, and wiſhes to eat of it: Let us  
  
« offer ſome to her. They preſented her  
  
  
e the taſte of it, and ſaid, your kindneſs  
* ſhall be rewarded. Come to this place  
e after thirteen moons, and you ſhall find  
“ ſomething that will be of great benefit  
„ in nouriſhing you and your children to  
* the lateſt generations. They did ſo,  
  
| and  
  
&amp; and to their ſurpriſe, found plants they  
had never ſeen before; but which, from  
that ancient time, have been conſtantly  
  
_ &amp; cultivated among us, to our great ad-  
  
vantage. Where her right hand had  
touched the ground, they found maize;  
  
« where her left hand had touched it, they  
  
* found kidney-beans; and where her  
  
« hackſide had fat on it, . they found to-  
&amp; bacco.” The good Miſſionary, diſguſted  
« with this idle tale, ſaid, What I de-  
e livered to you were ſacred truths ; but  
  
* what you tell me is mere fable, fiction,  
  
&amp; and falſchood.” The Indian, offended,  
replied, * My Brother, it ſeems your friends  
have not done you juſtice in your educa-  
  
« tion ; they have not well inſtructed You  
  
„ 1n the rules of common civility. You  
&amp;« ſaw, that we who underſtand and prac-  
  
&lt;« tiſe thoſe rules, believed all your ſtories,  
  
60 why do you refuſe to believe ours?  
  
When any of them come into our towns,  
our people are apt to croud round them,  
gaze upon them, and incommode them

where they deſire to be private; this they  
eſteem great rudeneſs, and the effect of the  
want of inſtruction in the rules of civility  
and good manners. We have,” ſay they,  
« as much curioſity as you, and when

they arrive within hearing, they ſtop and  
hollow, remaining there till. invited to  
enter. Two old men uſually come out  
to them, and lead them in. There is in  
every village a vacant dwelling, called the  
ſtrangers . houſe. Here they are placed,  
while the old men go round from hut to  
hut, acquainting the inhabitants that  
ſtrangers are arrived, who are probably

„Hans Hanſon ; but I was a little inclined  
ce this time to try ſome other Merchants.  
However, I called firſt upon Hans, and  
„ aſked him what he would give for bea-  
ver. He ſaid he could not give more  
than four ſhillings a pound: But, ſays  
he, I cannot talk on buſineſs now; this  
is the day when we meet together to learn  
good things, and J am going to the meet-  
„ing. So ] thought to myſelf, ſince J can-  
not do any buſineſs to-day, I may as well  
go to the meeting too, and] went with him.  
There ſtood up a man in black, and  
„began to talk to the people very an-  
5 grily. I did not underſtand what he  
* ſaid ; but perceiving that he looked  
much at me, and at Hanſon, I ima-  
e gined he was angry at ſeeing me there;  
* ſo I went out, fat down near the  
25 houſe, ſtruck fire, and lit my pipe,  
waiting till the meeting ſhould break

Hans, ſays I, I hope you have agreed  
to give more than four ſhillings a

* ſo much. I cannot give more than  
„ three ſhillings and ſixpence.“ I then  
„ ſpoke io ſeveral other dealers, but  
* they all ſung the ſame ſong, three and  
* ſixpence, three and ſixpence. This  
* made it clear to me that my ſuſpicion

„how to cheat Indians in the price

‘ Our laborious manner of life compared wi^h theirs, they cftceni  
(laviOi and bafe ; and ^he learning on which we value ourfclves,  
they regard as frivolous, and ufelcfs. An inilaqce of this occurred,  
at the treaty of Laiicader in Pennfylvania, anno 1744, between the  
government of Virginia and the Six Nations. After the principal  
bufinefs was fettled^ the commiffioners from Virginia acquainted the  
Indians by a fpeech, that there was at&#x27; Williamfburg 4 college with  
a fund, for educating^ Indian .youth ; 4 ind, that if the chiefs of the  
Six Nations would (end doyvn half a dozen of their Tons to that coU  
lege, the government would take care that they fliould be well pro¬  
vided for, and inilruCled in all the. learning of the white people. It

I pofition the fame ’day that it is made ; they think it would be treating  
it as a light matter; und th^t they (hew it refpe^t by taking time  
(o confider it, as of a matter important. They therefore deferred  
their anfwer till the day following ; when their fpeaker began, by  
expreffing their deep fenfe of the kindnefs of the Virginia govern¬  
ment, dn making them that offer ; for wc know,” fays he, “ that  
“ you highly efteem the kind of learning taught in thofe college?,  
and that the maintenance of our young men, while with you,  
would be very cxpenllve to you. We arc convinced, therefore,  
that you mean to do us good by your propofal, and we thank you  
“ heartily. But you who are wife muff know, that different nations  
have different conceptions of things ; and you will therefore not

By Dr. Benjamin Frankia,  
  
HE Iadian men, when young, are  
  
hunters and warriors ; when old,  
Counfellors; for all their goverament is  
by the counfel or advice of the fages;  
there is no force, there are no prifons,  
ho officers to compel obedience, or inflict  
punithment, Hence they generally ftudy  
Oratory ; the beft fpeaker having the molt  
influence. The Indian women till the  
fround, drefs the food, nurfe and bring  
Up the children, and preferve and hand  
gown to pofterity the memory of public  
tranfactions, Thefe employments of men  
  
and women are accounted natural aod

records of the council; and they prederve  
  
honourable. Having few artificial wante,  
  
they have abundance of Teifure for ime: -  
  
provement by converfation. Our labori-  
ous manner of life compared with theirs, .  
they efleem flavith and bafe; and the  
learning on which we value ourfelves,  
they regard as frivolous and ufelefs.  
Having frequent occafions to hold pub-  
lic councils, they have acquired great  
order and decency in conducting them,  
The old men fit in the foremoft ranks,  
the warriors in the next, and the women  
and children in the hiadmoft. The bufi-  
nefs of the women is to take exa&amp; notice  
of what paffes, imprint it in their memo.

compare with our writings, we always

he bas finithed, and fits down, they leave  
him five or fix minutes to recollect, that

again, and deliver it. ‘To interrupt ano.  
ther, even in common converfation, .18  
reckoned highly indecent.  
  
The politenefs of thele favages tn con-  
werfation, is, indeed, carried to excets ;  
fince it does not. permit them to contra-  
dict, or deny the truth of what is afferted  
in their prefence. By this means they in-  
deed avoid difputes : bat then it becomes  
dificult to know their minds, or what  
impreflion you make upon them. The  
miffionaries who have attempted to con-  
vert them to Chriftianity, all complain of  
this as one of the great difficulties of  
their miffion. The Indians hear with  
patience the truths of the gofpel explain-  
ed to them, and give their ulual tokens of  
affent and approbation : you would think  
they were convinced. No fuch matter.  
  
Tt te mere civility.  
  
A Swedith minifter having affembled  
the chiefs of the Safqucbanah Indians,  
made a fermon to them, acquatnting them  
with the principal hiftorical facts in which  
Our religion is founded; fuch as the fall  
of our firit parents by eating an apple ;  
the coming of Chrift to repair the mif-  
chicf ; his miracles and fuffering, &amp;c.—  
When he nad finifhed, an Indian Orator  
flood up tothank him. ‘* What youpave  
told wus,&quot;’ fays he, **is all very good.  
It is indeed bad to eat apples. It is bet-  
ter to make them all intocyder. We are  
much obliged by your kindnefs in coming  
fo far, to tell us thofe things which you  
have heard from your mothers. In return,  
i will tell you fome of thofe we have  
beard from oars.  
  
‘* Iu the beginning, our fathers had  
ouly the lich of animals to fubfift on ;  
and if their hunting wae unfucceisful,  
they were flarving. T&#x27;wo of our young  
bunters having killed a deer, made a

The fame hofpitality, efteemed among  
them a8 a principal virtuc, is practifed by  
rivate perfons; of which Conrad Wei  
fer, our interpreter, gave me the following  
inftance. He had beea naturalized among  
the Six Nations, and {poke well the Mo.  
hock language. In going through the In.  
dian country, to carry a mefftge from our  
governor to the council at Onondaga,  
he called at the habitation of Canafletego,  
anold acquaintance, who embraced him,  
fpread furs for him to fit on, placed before  
him fome boiled beans and venifon, and  
mixed fome rum and water for his drink.  
When he was well refrefhed, and had lit  
his pipe, Canaileteguo began to converte  
with him: afked how he had fared the  
many years fince they had teen each other,  
whence he then came, what had occafioned  
the journey, &amp;c. Conrad anfwered all his  
que(tions ; and when the difcourfe began  
toflag, the Indian, to continue it, faid,  
“ Conrad, you have lived long among the  
white people. and know fomething of  
their cuftoms 3; L have been fometimes at  
Albany, and have obferved, that once  
in feven days they fhut up their fhops,  
and affemble ail in the great houfe; tell  
me what it ts for ?—What dothey do  
there? “* They meet there,” fays Con-  
rad, **to hear and learn good things,”  
“1 do not doubt,” fays the Indian, * that  
they tell you fo; they have told me the  
fame; but I doubt the truth of what  
they fay, and I will tell you my reafons.  
I went lately to Albany to fell my fkins,  
and buy blankets, knives, powder, rum,  
&amp;c. You know I generally ufed to deal  
with Hans Hanfon; but 1 was a little  
inclined this time to try fome other mer-  
chants; However, [ called firft upon  
Hans, ang afked him what he wou!d  
give for beaver. He faid he could not  
give morg than four fhillings a pound :  
but, faysPhe, 1 cannot talk on bufinefs  
now; this is the day when we meet to-  
gether to learn good things; and I am  
going to the meeting. So TI thought to  
myfclf, fince I cannot do all my bufinefs  
to-day, I may as we!l eo to the meeting  
too, and I went with bim.—There ftood  
upa man in black, and he began to talk  
tothe people very angrily; I did not un  
derftand what he faid: but perceiving  
that he looked much at me, and at  
Hanfon, I imagined he was angry at fee-

futpefted it might be the fubje&amp; of  
their mecting. So when they came out,  
I accofled my merchant — Well, Hans,  
fays J, | hope you have agreed to give  
more than four fhillings a pound {&quot;&quot; ** Nay  
fays he, Icannot give fo much, I cannot  
sive more than three fhillings and &amp;x-  
pence.” **1 then fpoke to feveral other  
dealers, but they ali fung the fame fong  
three and fixpence, three and fixpence,  
This made it clear to me that my fufpi-  
cion was right; and that whatever they  
pretended of meeting to learn good things,  
the real purpofe was to confalt how to  
cheat Indians in the price of beaver.  
Confider bat a little, Conrad, and you  
muff be of my opinion. If they met fo  
often to learn good things, they certainly  
would have learned fome before this time.  
But they are till ignorant, You know  
our practice. If a white man, tn travel-  
ling through our country, enters one of  
our cabins, we all treat him as I treat yous  
we dry himif he is wet, we warm him if  
he is cold, and give him meat and drink,  
that he may allay his thirft and bunger;  
and we fpread foft furs for him to reft and  
Neepon : We demand nothing in return,+  
But if I gointoa white man’s houfe at Al-  
bany, and afk for viétuals and drink, they  
fay, where is your money? And if I have  
none, they fay, get out you Indian dog.  
You fee they have not yet learned thofe  
little good things, that we need no meete  
ing to he inftruéted in, becaufe our mo-  
thers taught them to us when we were  
children; and therefore it 1s impottble  
their meetings fhould be as they fay, for.  
  
any fuch purpofe, or have any fuch ef- |  
feet; they are only to contrive the cheat-  
ing of Indians in the price of beaver.

Remarks concerning the Savages  
of North- America.  
  
{By Dr. Franklin. ]  
  
AVAGES we call them, becaufe  
the:r manners differ from ours,  
which we think the perfe@ion of ci-  
vility ; they think the fame of theirs.  
Perhaps if we.could examine the  
manners of different nations with im-  
partiality, we fhou&#x27;d find no people  
fo rude as to be without any rules of  
politenefs ; nor any fo polite as net  
tohave fome remains of rudenefs.  
The Indian men, when young, are  
hunters and warriors; when old,  
counfellors; for all their go vernment  
is by the counfel or advice of the fag-  
és; there is no force, there are no  
Prifons, no officers to compel obedi-  
ence, or infirk punifhment. Hence  
they generally ftudy oratory; the  
bet fpeaker having the moft infiu-  
face. The Indian women till the  
peers, drefs the food, nurfe and  
ting up the children, and preferve  
and hand down to pofterity the me-  
mory of public tranfaAions. Thefe  
employ ments of men and women are  
accounted natural and honourable.

abundance of leifure for improvensen€  
by converfation. Our laborious  
manner of life compared with theirs,  
they efleem flavi  
  
felves, they regard as frivolous and  
ufelefs. An inflance of this occur-  
  
ed at thetreaty of Lancaflerin Penn- °  
filvania, anno 1744, between the —  
  
Government of Virginia andthe fix  
Nations. After the principal bufi~  
nefs was fettled, the commnffieners  
from Virginia aquainted tiie Indians  
  
by a fpeech, that there was at Willi~ °  
  
amfburg a college with a fund, for  
educating Indian youth; and that if  
the chiefs of the fix nations would  
fend down half a dozen of their fons  
to that college, the government  
would take care that they fhould be  
well provided for, and infirued im  
all the learning of the white people.  
It is one of the Indian rules of polite-  
nefs not to anfwer a public propofiti-  
on the fame day that it is made; they  
think it would be treatng it as a  
light matter; and that they fhew ic  
refpe&amp; by taking time to confider it,  
as of a matter important. They  
therefore deferred their anfwer tilf  
the day following ; when their fpeak-  
er began, by expreffling their deep  
fenfe of the kindnefs of the Virginia  
government, in aa them that  
offer ; “for we know,‘‘fays he, that  
“ you higiily efteem the kind of learn-  
‘ing taught in thofe colleges, and

Having frequent occafions to  
hold public councils, they have ac-  
quired great order and decency in  
condu€ing them. ‘The old men  
fit in the foremott ranks, the war-  
riors inthe next, and the women  
and children in the hindmoft. The  
bufinels of the women is to take  
exe notice of what palfes, im-  
printit in their memoyies, for they  
have no writing, and communicate  
3 to their children, They are the  
secords of the council, and they  
preferve tradition of the ftipula-  
tions in treaties a hundred years  
back; which when we compare  
with our writings, we always find  
exact. He that would fpeak, rifes,

When he has finifacd, and {fits

down, they leave him five or fix  
minutes to recolle&amp;, that if he has  
omitted any thing he. intended to  
fay, or has any thing to add, he  
may rife again, and deliver it. To  
interrupt another, even in common  
converfation, is reckoncd highly  
indecent,  
  
The politenefs of thefe favages  
in converfation is, indeed, carried  
to excels ; fince it does not permit  
them to contradi&amp; or deny the  
truth of what is afferted in their  
prefence. By this means they in-  
deed avoid difputes; but then it  
becomes difficult to know their  
minds, or what impreffion you  
make upon them. The miffiona-  
ries, who have attempted to convert  
them to chriftianity, all complain  
of this as one of the great d:fheul-  
ties of their miflion. ‘The Indians  
hear with patience the truths of the  
gofpel explained to them, and give  
their ufual tokens of affent and ap-  
probation: you would think they  
were convinced, No fuch matter,  
It is mere civility.  
  
A Swedifh minifter having af-  
fembled the Chiefs of the Sufque-  
hanah Indians, made a fermon to  
them, acquainting them with the  
principal hiftorical faé&amp;ts on which  
our religion is founded ; fuch as  
the fall of our firt parents by eat-  
ing an apple ; the coming of Chrift  
to repair the mifchief; his miracles  
and fuffcring, &amp;c.—When he had  
finifhed, an Indian Orator ftood up  
to thank him. “ What you have  
told us,” fays he, * is all very good.  
It is indeed bad to eat apples, It  
is better to make them all into ci-  
der. We are much obliged by your

For SEPTEMBER,  
  
thofe things which you have heard  
from your mothers. In return, I  
will tell you fome of thofe we have  
heard from our’s,  
  
« Inthe beginning, our fathers  
had only the flefh of animals to  
fubfift on; and if their hunting  
was unfuccefsful, they were flarv-  
ing. Two of eur young hunters  
having killed a deer, made a fire  
in the woods to broil fome parts of  
it. When they were about to fa-  
tisfy their hunger, they beheld a  
beautiful young woman defcend  
from the clouds, and feat herfcif  
on that bill which you fee yonder  
among the Blue Mountains, They  
faid tocach other, It is a {pirit that  
perhaps has {melt our broiling ve-  
nifon, and wifhes to eat of it: Ict  
us offer fome to her, They pre-  
{ented her with the tonguc: fhe  
was pleafed with the tafte of it, and  
faid, Your kindnefs fhall be re-  
warded. Come to this place after  
thirteen moons, and you fhall find  
fomething that will be of great be-  
nefit in nourifhing you and your  
children to the lateft generations,  
They did fo, and, to their furprife,  
found plants they had never feen  
before ; but which, from that an-  
cient time, have been conftantly  
cultivated among us, to our great  
advantage. Where her right hand  
had teuched the ground, they found  
maize; where her Ieft hand had  
touched it, they found kidney-  
beans; and where her backfide had  
fat on it, they found tobacco.” ‘The  
good Miffionary, difgufted with  
this idle tale, faid, “* What I deli-  
vered to you were facred truths ;  
but what you tell me is mere fable,  
fiétion, and falfehood.” The In-  
dian, offended, replied, “ My bro-  
ther, itfeems your friends have not  
done you juftice in your education;  
they have not well inftruéted you  
in the rules of common civility.  
You faw that we, who underftand  
and prattife thofe rules, believed  
all your ftories, why do you refule  
to belicve our’s ?”  
  
1786.

When any of them come into  
our towns, our people are apt to  
crowd round them, gaze upon  
them, and incommode them where  
they defire to be private ; this they  
efteem ‘great rudenefs, and the et-  
fe&amp; of the want of inftruétion in  
the rules of civility and good man-  
ners. ‘ We have,” fay they, **as  
much curiofity as you, and when  
you come into our towns, we wifh  
for opportunities of looking at you;  
but for this purpofe we hide our-  
{elves behind bufhes where you are  
to pafs, and never intrude ourfelves  
into yourcompany.”&quot; .  
  
Their manner of entering one  
another’s villages has likewife it’s  
rules. It is reckoned uncivil in  
travelling ftrangers to enter a vil-  
lage abruptly, without giving no-  
tice of their approach, Therefore,  
as foon as they arrive within hear-  
ing, they ftop and holla, remain-  
ing there till invited to enter. ‘Two  
old men ufually come out to them  
and lead them in, ‘There is in every  
village a vacant dwelling, called  
The Strangers’ Houfe. Here they  
are placed, while the old men go  
round from hut to hut, acquainting  
the inhabitants that {trangers are ar-  
rived, who are probably hungry,  
and weary; and every one fends  
them what he can {pare of victuals,  
and {kins to repofe on. When the  
{trangers are refrefhed, pipes and  
tobacco are brought ; and then, but  
not before, converfation begins,  
with inquiries who they are, whi-  
ther bound, what news, &amp;c. and  
itufually ends with offers of fer-  
vice, if the ftrangers have oceafion  
for guides, or any neccilaries for  
continuing their journey ; and no-  
thing is exatted tor the entertain-  
ment.  
  
The fame hofpitality, cftecmed  
among them as a principal virtue,  
is prattifed by private perfons ; of  
which Conrad Weifer, our interpre-  
ter, gave me the following inftance:  
he had been naturalized among the  
Six Nations, and {poke well the

Mohock language. In going thro’  
the Indian country, to carry amef-  
faze from our governor to the  
council at Onondaya, he called at  
the habitation of Canaffetego, an old  
acquaintance, who embraced him,  
fpread furs for him to fit on, placed  
before him foie boiled beans and  
venifon, and mixed fume rum and  
water for his drink. When he  
was well refrefhed, and had lit his  
ipe, Canalfetego began to con-  
Ae with him dees how he had  
fared the many years fince they  
had feen each other, whence he  
then came, what had occafioned  
the journey, &amp;c. Conrad anfwer-  
ed ail his juctlions ; and when the  
difcourfe began to flag, the Indian,  
to continue it, faid, Conrad,  
you have lived Jong among the  
white people, and know fomething  
of their cuftoms; I have been  
{ometimes at Albany, and have ob-  
ferved, that once in feven days  
they fhut up their fhops, and al-  
femble all in the great houie ; tell  
me whut it is for—What do they  
co there ?” « They meet there,”  
{ays Conrad, “ to hear and Icarn  
coud things.” 1 do not doubt,”  
fays the Indian, “that they tell  
you fo; they have told me the  
fame: but I doubt the truth of  
what they fay. and I will tell you  
my reafons. I went latcly to Al-  
bany to fell my {kins, and buy blan-  
kets, knives, powder, rum, &amp;c.  
You know I generally ufed to deal  
with IHlans Hanfon; but I wasa  
little inclined this time to try fome  
ether merchants. However, I  
called firlt upon Hans, and afked  
him what he would give for beaver.  
He faid he could not give more  
than four fhillings a pound: but,  
fays he. 1 cannot talk on bufinefs  
now: this is the day when we  
meet together tolearn good things,  
and T am going to the meeting. So  
] thought to mylelf, fince I cannot  
do any bulinels to-day, I may as  
well go to the meeting too, and I |  
  
Tue New LONDON MAGAZINE,  
  
went with him.—There flood up a  
man in black, and began to talk to  
the people very angrily. I did not  
underftand what he faid ; but per-  
ceiving that he looked much at me,  
and at Hanfon, I imagined he was  
angry at feeing me there ; fo I went  
out, fat down near the houfe, ftruck  
fire, and lit my pipe, waiting till  
the mecting fhould break up. I  
thought too, thatthe man had mene  
tioned fomething of beaver, and I  
jufpetted it might be the fubjeét of  
their meeting. So when they came  
out, I accoiled my merchant,—  
Well, Hans, fays I, I hope you  
have agreed to give more than four  
fhillings a pound?” “No, fays  
he, I cannot give fo much, I can-  
not give more than three fhillings  
and fixpence.” ‘I then {poke to  
feveral other dealers, but they all  
fung the fame fong, three and fix-  
pence, three and fixpence. This  
made it clear to me that my fufpi-  
cion was right; and that whatever  
they pretended of meeting to learn  
good things, the real purpefe was  
to conlult how to cheat Indians in  
the price of beaver. Confider but  
alittle, Conrad, and vou muft be  
of my opinion. If they met fo of-  
ten to learn good things, they ccr-  
tainly would have learned fome  
before this time. But they are ftill  
ignorant. You know our prattice.  
Ifa white man, in travelling thro’  
our country, enters onc of our ca-  
bins, we all treat him as I treat  
you ; we dry him if hciswet, we  
warm him if he is cold, and give  
him meat and drink, that he nay  
allay his thirft and hunger ; and we  
{pread foft furs for him to reit and  
fleep on; we demand nothing in  
return.* Butif 1 gointoa white

„ THE  
  
SAVAGES OF NORTH-AMERICA.  
C!1AVAGES we call them, becauſe their  
  
manners differ from ours, which we think  
the perfection of civility ; they think the ſame of  
theirs.  
  
Perhaps if we could examine the manners  
of different nations with impartiality, we ſhould  
find no people fo rude as to be without any  
cules of politeneſs; nor any ſo polite as not to  
have ſome remains of rudeneſs.  
  
The Indian men, when young, are hunters  
and warriors; when old, counſellors; for all  
their government is by the counſel or advice of  
the ſages ; there is no force, there are no pri-  
ſons, no officers to. compel obedience, or inflict  
puniſhment. Hence they generally ſtudy ora-  
tory ; the beſt ſpeaker having the moſt influence,  
The Indian women till the ground, dreſs the  
food, nurſe and bring up the children, and pre-  
ſerve and hand down to poſterity the memory  
of public tranſactions. Theſe employments  
of men and women are accounted natural and  
honourable. Having few artificial wants,  
they have abundance of leiſure for improve-

138 REMARKS CONCERNING THE  
of life compared with theirs, they eſteem la  
  
viſh and baſe; and the learning on which we.  
value ourſelves, they regard as frivolous and  
  
  
treaty of Lancaſter in Pennſilvania, anno 1744,  
between the government of Virginia and the Six  
Nations. After the principal buſineſs was ſet-  
tled, the commiſſioners from Virginia acquaint-  
ed the Indians by a ſpeech, that there was at  
Williamſburg a college with a fund, for edu-  
cating Indian youth ; and that if the chiefs of  
  
  
would take care that they ſhould be well pro-  
vided for, and inſtructed in all the learning of  
the white people. It is one of the Indian rules  
of politeneſs not to anſwer a public propoſi-

and you will therefore not. take it amiſs, if  
our ideas of this kind of education happen  
not to be the tame with yours. We have  
had ſome experience of it : ſeveral of our  
young people were formerly brought up at  
the colleges of the northern provinces ;  
  
  
but when they came back to us, they were  
bad runners ; ignorant of every means of  
living in the woods ; unable to bear either  
cold or hunger ; knew neither how to build  
a cabin, take a deer, or kill an enemy ; ſpoke  
our language imperfectly; were therefore  
neither fit for hunters, warriors, or counſel-  
lors; they were totally good for nothing.  
We are however not the leſs obliged by  
your kind offer, though we decline accept-  
ing it : and to ſhow our grateful ſenſe of it,  
if the gentlemen of Virginia will fend us a  
dozen of their ſons, we will take great care  
of their education, inſtru them in all we  
know, and make men of them.“

of the council, and they preſerve tradition of  
the ſtipulations in treaties a hundred years  
back; which, when we 1 with our  
writings, we always find exack. He that would  
ſpeak, riſes. The reſt obſerve a profound ſi-  
lence. When he has finiſhed, and ſits down,  
they leave him five or ſix minutes to recollect,  
  
that if he has omitted any thing he intended to  
ſay, or has any thing to add, he may riſe again,  
and deliver it. To interrupt another, even in  
common converſation, 1s reckoned highly in-  
decent. How different this is from the con-  
duct of a polite Britiſh Houſe of Commons,  
where ſcarce a day paſſes without ſome con-  
fuſion, that makes the Speaker hoarſe in calling  
to order; and how different from the mode of  
converſation in many polite companies of Eu-  
rope, where, if you do not deliver your fen-  
tence with great rapidity, you are cut off in  
the middle of it by the impatient loquacity of  
thoſe you converſe with, and never ſuffered to  
finiſh it!  
  
The politeneſs of theſe ſavages in converſa-  
tion, is, indeed, carried to exceſs ; ſince it does  
not permit them to contradict or deny the  
truth of what is aſſerted in their preſence. By  
this means they indeed avoid diſputes ; but  
then it becomes difficult to know their ine,  
or what impreſſion you make upon them. The  
miſſionaries who have attempted to convert  
  
them to Chriſtianity, all complain of this as

The Indians hear with patience the truths of  
the goſpel explained to them, and give their

would think they were convinced. No ſuch

founded; ſuch as the fall of our b6rſt parents  
by eating an apple ; the coming of Chriſt  
to repair the miſchief ; his Ps Ph and ſuf-  
fering, &amp;c. When he had finiſhed, an In-  
dian orator ſtood up to thank him. What  
you have told us, ſays he ** is all very good.  
  
It is indeed bad to eat apples. It is better to

angry at ſeeing me there; ſo I went out,

break up. I thought too, that the man had  
mentioned ſomething of beaver, and I ſuſ-  
  
pected it might be the ſubject of their meet-

much at me, and at Hanton, I ima-  
gined he was angry at feeing me there ;  
fo [ weat out, fat down near the houic,  
ftruck fire, and lit my pipe, waiting  
till the meeting fhould break up. I  
hought too, that the man had men-  
tioned fomething of beaver, and I fui-  
pected it might be the fubje&amp; of their  
meeting. So when they came out, |  
accolted my merchant. ‘ Well, Hans,’  
  
263  
  
faid I, «I hope you have agreed to  
give more thax tour ‘hillings a pound.’  
‘No,’ fays he, cannot give 10  
much. I cannot give more thaa three  
fhillings and fixpence.’ I then {poke  
to feveral other dealers, but they all  
fung the fame fong, three anu ‘ixpence,  
three and ‘fixpence. This sade it  
clear to me .fat my fufpicion was  
right; and that whatever tury pre-  
tended of meeting to learn good  
things, the real purpofe was to contult  
how to cieat Indians in the price of  
beaver. Confider but a little, Con-  
rad, and you mutt be of my opinign.  
If they met fo often to learn good  
things, they would certainly have  
learned foime before this time. But  
they are ftill ignorant. You know  
  
‘our practice. If a white man in travel-  
  
ling through our country, enters one  
of our cabins, we all treat him as I  
treat you; we dry him if he is wet,  
we warm him if he is cold, and give  
him meat and drink, that he may allay  
his thirit and hunger ; and we {pread  
foit furs for him to reit and fleep on:  
we demand nothing in Sturn*. But  
if I go into a white man’s houfe at  
Albany, and‘afk for victuals and drink,  
they fay? Where is your money; and  
if I have noue, they fay, Get out, you  
Indian dog. You fee they have not  
yet learned thofe little good things, that  
we neéd no meetings to be initru@ed  
in, becaufe our mothers taught them  
to us when we were children; and  
therefore it is impoffible their mectings  
fhould be, as they iay, for any fuch  
purpote, or have any iuch effet; they  
are only to contrive the cheating of  
Indians in the price of beaver.

“ having killed a deer, made a tire  
“ in the woods to broil I&#x27;ome parts

replied, My brother, it feems

When any of them come into our  
towns, our people are apt to croud  
round them, gaze upon them, and  
  
incommode them where they defire  
to be private; this they elleem great  
rudenefs, and the effe&lt;ll of the want  
of inllru&lt;^tion in the rules of civility  
and good manners. “We have,”  
fay they, “ as much curiofity as you %  
“ and when you come into our  
“ towns, w’e wilh for opportunities  
“ of locjdng at you; but for this  
“ purpol&#x27;e we hide ourfelves behind  
“ biilhcs where you are to pals, and  
“ never intrude ourfelves into your  
“ company.”  
  
Their manner of entering one  
another’s villages has likewife its  
rules. It is reckoned uncivil in tra¬  
velling llrangers to enter a village  
abruptly, without giving notice of  
their approach. Therefore, as loon  
as they arrive within hearing, they  
Hop and hollow, remaining there  
till invited to enter. Two old men  
ufually come out to them, and lead  
tliem in. There is in every village  
a vacant dwelling, called the Stran¬  
ger’s Houfe. Here they are placed,  
while the old men go round from  
hut to hut, ac(]uainting the inhabi¬  
tants that Hrangersare arrived, who  
are probably hungry and weary ;  
and every one fends them what be  
can fpare of vitSiuals, and Ikins to  
^epofe on. When the Hrangers  
are refreflied, pipes and tobacco are  
brought; and then, hut not before,  
converfadon begins, with inquiries  
who they are? whither bound? what  
news ? &amp;c. and it ufually ends with  
oilers of fervice, if the Hrangers  
have occalion for guides, or any ne-  
celTaries for continuing their jour¬  
ney, and nothing it exacted fur the  
entertainment.  
  
The fame hofpitality, cHeemed  
among them as a principal virtue,  
is pra«ilifcd by private perfons; of  
which Conrad Weifer, our inter¬  
preter, gave me tl.e following in-

2 HE Indian men, when young, are  
hunters and warriors; when old,  
counfellors; for all their government is by

no force, there are no prifons; no officers to  
compel obedience, or inflict punifhment.  
Hence they gencrally ftudy oratory ; the belt

Having frequent occafions to hold public

fation, is, indeed, carried to excefs; fince  
it does not permit them to contradict or de-  
ny the truth of what is.afferted in their pre-  
fence. _ By this means they indeed avoid dil-  
putes; but then it becomes difficult to know  
their minds, or what impreflion you make  
upon them. ‘The miffionaries who have at-  
tempted to convert them to Chriftianity all  
complain of this as one of the great difficul-  
tics of their miffion. The Indians hear with  
patience the truths of the gofpel explained  
tothem, and give their ufual tokens of af-  
fentand apprebation. You would think they  
were convinced:——No fuch matter; it is  
mere Civility.  
  
A Swedifh minifter having aflembled the  
chiefs of the Safquehanah Indians, made a  
fermon to them, acquainting them with the  
  
rincipal hiftorical faéts on which our religion  
is founded; fuch as the fall of our firft pa-  
rents by eating an apple; the coming of  
Chrift to repair the miichief; his miracles,  
and fuffering, &amp;c.—When he had finifhed,  
an Indian orator ftood up to thank him.  
‘© What you have told us,”’ fays he, §is all  
very good. It is indeed bad to eat apples.  
It is better to make them all into cyder.  
We are much obliged by your kindnefs in  
coming fo far, to tellus thofe things which  
you have heard from your mothers. In re-  
turn, I will tell you fome of thole we have  
heard from ours.  
  
“« In the beginning, our fathers had only  
the ficth of animals to fubfift on; and if their  
hunting was untuccefsful, they were ftarving.  
Two of our young hunters having killed a  
deer, made a fire in the woods to broil fome  
partsof it. When they were about to fatis-  
ty hunger, they beheld a beautiful young  
woman defcend from the clouds, and feat  
herfclf on that hill which you&quot; fee yonder a-  
mong the Blue Mountains. They faid to  
each other, It is a fpirit that perhaps has  
{melt our broiling venifon, and withes to eat  
of it; let us offer fome to her. They prefent-  
ed her with the tongue: fhe was pleated  
with thetafte of it, and faid, Your kindnefs  
fhall be rewarded : Come to this place after  
thirteen moons, and you will find fomething  
that will be of great benefit in nourifhing you  
and your children to thé lateft generations.  
They did fo, and, to their furprife, found  
plants they had never feen before; but which,  
from that ancient time, have been con!tantly  
cultivated among us, to our great advantage.  
Where her right hand had touched the  
ground, they found maize; where her left  
hand had touched it, they found kidney-  
beans; and where her backfide had fat, on  
it they found tobacco.’”” The good miffio-  
nary, difgufted with this idle tale, faid,  
*“‘ What I delivered to you were facred  
truths ; but what you tell me is mere fable,  
Siction, and falehoed.” The ladian offeud-

the rules of common civliity. You faw that  
we, who uuderftand and practife thefe rules,  
believed all your ftories} why do you refute  
to believe ours?”  
  
When any of them come into our towns,  
our people are apt to croud round them, gaze  
upon them, and incommode them where they  
defire to be private; this they efteem great  
rudenefs, and the effect of the want of ine  
ftru&amp;tion in the rules of civility and good  
manners, “ We have,” fay they, ‘as  
much curiofity as you; and when you come  
into our towns we with for opportunities of  
looking at you; but for this purpofe we hide  
ourtelves behind bufhes where you are to pals,  
  
and never intrude ourfelves into your come |  
  
‘  
  
pany.”  
  
Their manner of entering one another’s  
villages has likewife its rules. It is reckoned  
uncivil in travelling ftrangers to enter a vil-  
lage abruptly, without giving notice of their  
  
approach. Therefore, as foon as they arrive  
  
within hearing, they ftop and hollow, re-  
maining there till invited to enter. Two  
old men ufually eome out to them, and lead  
them in. There is in every village a vacant  
dwelling, calied the Stranger’s Houfe.  
Here they are placed, while the old men go  
round from hut to hut, acquainting the in-  
habitants that flrangers are arrived, who are  
probably hungry and weary; andevery one  
fends them what he can {pare of victuals,  
and fkins to repoie on. When the ftrangers  
are retrefhed, pipes and tobacco are brought;  
and then, but not before, converfation be-  
gins, with inquiries who they are; whither  
bound? what news? &amp;c. and it ufually ends  
with offers of fervice, if the sigs sh have  
occafion for guides, or any neceflaries for  
continuing their journey, and nothing is ex-  
acted for their. entertainment.  
  
The fame hofpitality, efteemed among  
them as a principal virtue, is practifed by  
private perfons; of which Conrad Weiler,  
our interpreter, gave me the following in-  
ftance: he had been naturalized among the  
Six Nations, and {poke well the Mohock lan»  
guage. In going thro’ the Indian country,  
to carry a meflage from our governor to the  
council at Onondaga, he called at the habi-  
tation of Canafletego, an old acquaintance,  
who embraced him, fpread furs tor him to  
fit on, placed before him fome boiled beans  
and venifon, and mixed fome rum and water  
for his drink. When he was well refrethed,  
  
and had lit his pipe, Canafletego began to  
converfe with him: afked how he had fared  
the many years fince they had feen each  
other? whence he then came? what had oc-  
cafioned the journey? &amp;c. Conrad anfwered  
ali his queftions; and when whe difcourfe be-

onrad, you have lived long among the  
white people; and know fometh ng of their  
cuffoms; I have been fometimes at Albany,  
and have oebferved, that once in feven days  
they fhut up their fhops, and allemble all in  
the great houle: tel! me’ what it is for?  
What clo they dothere?”’ They meet there,”  
fays Conrad, to hear.and Icarn good things.”  
Ido not doubt,”’ fays the Indian, that they  
tell you fo; they have told me the fame:  
but I doubt the truth of what they fay, and  
P will tell you my reafons. I went lately to  
Albany to fell my dkins, and buy blankets,  
knives, powder, rum, &amp;c. You know I ge-  
merally uledto deal with Hans Hanlon, burl  
wasa little inclined this time to try foie other  
However, I catled firlt upon  
Hans, and afked him what he would give  
for beaver? He faid he could not give more  
than four fhillings a pound: but, fays he,  
I cannot talk on bufinefs now; this is the day  
when we meet together to learn good things,  
and Iam going tothe meeting, Sol thought  
to mytelt, fince I cannot do any bufinets to-  
day, I may as well go to the mecting too ;  
and I went with him.—‘Dhere flood up a  
manin black, and began to talk to the people  
very angrily. I djd not underftand what he  
faid ;. but perceiving that he looked much at  
me and at Hianjon, I imagined he was angry  
  
at fecing me there; fo I went out, fat down-  
  
near the houfe, ftrack fire, and lit my pipe,  
Waiting till the meeting fhould break up. I  
thought too, that the man had mentioned  
fomething of beaver, and I fulpected it  
might be the fubjeét of their meeting. So  
when they come out, I accofied my mer-  
chant. Well, Hans, fays 1, I hope you  
have agreed to give more than four fillings  
a-pound 2?” © No, fays le, | cannot give  
fo much, I cannot give more than three fhil-  
lings and fiapence.’’ I then fpoke to feveral  
other dealers but they all flung the lame jong,  
three apd fixpence, three and fixpence.  
Yhis made it clearto me that my fu!picion  
was right; and that whatever they pretended  
of meeting to learn gocd things, the real  
purpofe was, to canfult how to cheat Indi-  
aus in the price of beaver. Confider but a  
litthey Conrad, and you muft be of my opi-  
pion If they meet fo often to karn good  
things, they certainly would have learned  
fom before this time. But they are fuill ig-  
nerant. You know our pradice, If a white

are only to contrive the cheating of Indians

they were flarving. Two of our young  
hunters having killed a deer, made a  
fire in the woods to broil fome parts  
of it. When they were about to fatusfy  
hunger, they beheld 2 beautiful young  
woman defcend from the clouds, and  
feat herfelf on that hill which you fee  
  
onder among the blue mountains,  
They faid to each other, it is a fpirit  
that perhaps has {melt our broiling  
venifon, and wifhes to eat of it: ket  
us offer fome to her. They prefented  
her with the tongue: fhe was pleafed  
with the tafle of it, and faid, your  
kindnefs fhall be rewarded : come to  
this place after thirteen moons, and  
you will find fomething that will be  
of great benefit in nourifhing you and  
your children to the lateit generati«  
ons. They did fo, and, to their fur  
prife, found plants they had never  
feen before ; but which, from that  
ancient time, have been conftantly  
cultivated among us, to our great ad-  
vantage. Where her right hand  
had touched the ground, they found  
maize; where her left hand had  
touched it, they found kidney beans;  
and where her backfide had fat, onit  
they found tobacco.’’ The good mif-  
fionary, difgufted with this :dle tale,  
faid, ** what I delivered to you were

r flories;  
» ours?”  
  
1989.) Remarks on the North American Indians. 345  
  
When any of them come into our  
towns, our people are apt to croud  
round them, gaze upon them, and in-  
commode them where they defire to  
be private; this they efleem great  
rudenets, and the effect of the want  
of inftruction in the rules of civility  
and good manners. ** We have,”’ fay  
they, * as much curiofity as you ; and  
when you come Into our towns, we  
wilh for opportun.ties of looking at  
you; but for this purpofe we hide  
ourfelves behind bufhes where you are  
to pafs, and never intrude ourfelves  
into your company.  
  
Their manner of entering one ano-  
ther’s villages has likewife its rules.  
It is reckoned uncivil, in travelling  
flrangers, to enter a village abrupily,  
without giving notice of their ap-  
proach, ‘Therefore, as foon as they  
grrive within hearing, they flop and  
hollow, remaining there till invited  
toenter. Two old men ufually come  
out to them and leadthemin, There  
is in every village a vacant dweliing,  
called the Stranger’s Houfe. Here  
they are placed, while-the old men go  
round from hut to hut, acquainting  
the inhabuants that ftrangers are ar-  
rived, who are probably hungry and  
weary; and every one fends them  
what he can fpare of vittuals, and  
{kins to repofe on. When the {tran-  
gers are refrefhed, pipes and tobacco  
are brought; and hea, but not be-  
fore, conyerfation begins, with en-  
quries who they are ? whither bound ?  
what news ? &amp;c. and it ufually ends  
wih offers of fervice, if the ftran-  
gers have occafion for guides or any  
neceffaries for continuing their jour-  
ney ; and nothing is exacted for the  
entertainment.  
  
The fame hofpitality, efleemed a-  
among them as a principal virtue, ts  
prattifed by private perfons; of which  
Cotrad Weiler, our interpreter, gave  
me the following inflance: He had  
been naturatifed among the Six Na-  
tions, and {poke well the Mohock  
language. In going through the In-  
dian country, to carry a meffage from  
our govertior to the council at Onon-  
daga, he called at the habitation of  
Canafletezo, an old acquaintance,  
who embraced him, fpread furs for  
hum to fit on, placed before him fom=  
boiled beans and venifon, and mixed  
jeme rum and water for his drink.  
  
When he was well refrefhed, and  
had lit his pipe, Canafletego began to  
converfe with him: afked how he  
had fared the many years fince they  
had feen each other ? whence he then  
came ? what had occafioned the jour-  
ney? &amp;c. Conrad anfwered all his  
queftions ; and when the difcourfe be-  
gan to flag, the Indian, t&amp;continue  
it, faid, ** Conrad, you have lived  
long among the white people, and  
know fomething of their cuftoms:  
I have been fometimes at Adbany,  
and have obferved, that once in fe-  
ven days they fhut up their fhops, and  
alfemble all in the great eae; tell  
me whatit is for? What do they do  
there ?*’ ‘© They meet there,’’ fays  
Conrad, ‘‘to hear and learn good  
things.’ ** I do not doubt,” fays  
the Indian, ** that they tell you fo;  
they have told me the fame; but !  
doubt the truth of what they fay, and  
I will tell you my reafons. I wene  
lately to Albany to fell my fkins, and  
buy blankets, knives, powder, rum,  
&amp;c. Youknow I generally ufed to deak  
with Hans Hanfon, but I was a little  
inclined this time to try fome other  
merchants. However, I called frit  
upon Hans, and afked him what he  
would give for beaver? He faid he  
could not give more than four fhillings  
a pound ; but, fays he, I cannot talk  
on bulinefs now; this is the day  
when we meet together to learn good  
things, and I am going to the meet-  
ing. So I thought to myfelf, fince I  
cannot do any bufinefs to-day, I may  
as well go to the meeting too; and [  
wem with him, There flood up a  
man in black, and began to talk tw  
the people very anertly. I did not  
underiland what he faid, but perceiv-  
ing that he looked much at me and at  
Hanton, I imagined he was angry at  
feeing me there; fo I went out, far  
down near the houfe, ftruck fire, and  
ht my ppe, waiuné oll the meeting  
fhould break up. I thought too, that  
  
the man had mentioned fomething of  
  
beaver, and I fufpetted it might be  
}  
the fubject of their meeting. So when  
they came out, I accolted my mer-  
chant, well, Hans, fays I, I hope you  
have agreed to g@ ve more than fors  
fhillings a pound ?”’ ** No,”’ fays he,  
** | cannot ative fo much, T cannor  
give more than three fhillings and fix  
  
‘5 é

fame fong, three and fix pence,  
three and fix pence. This made  
it clear to me that my fufpicion  
was right; and that, whatever they  
pretended of meeting to learn good  
things, the real purpofe was, to con-  
fult how to cheat Indians in the price  
of beaver, Confider but a litite, Con-  
rad, and you mutt be of my opinion.  
If they met fo often to learn good  
things, they ceriainly would have  
learnt fome before this time. But  
they are flill ignorant. You know  
our prattice ; if a white man, in tra-  
velling through our country, enters  
one of our cabins, we all treat him as  
I treat you ; we dry himif he ts wet,  
we warm him if he is cold, and give  
him meat and drink, that he may al-  
lay his thirit and hunger; and we  
{pread fofi furs for him to reft and  
fleep on: we demand nothing in re-  
turn. But if I go into a whiue man’s  
houfe at Albany, and afk for victuals  
and drink, they fay, ‘* Where 1s your  
money :’’ and if 1 have none. they fay,  
** set out, you Indian dog.”’ “* You  
fee they have not yet learned thofe  
litle good things that we need no  
meeting to be inflructed in, becaufe  
our mothers taught them to us when  
we were children; and therefore it 1s  
mmpollible their meetings fhould be, as  
they fay, for any fuch purpofe, or  
have any fuch etfect; they are only to  
eontrive the cheating of Indians in

HE Indian men,when young,  
are hunters and warriors ;  
when old, counfellors ; for all  
their government is by the coun-  
{el or advice of the fages; there  
is no force, there are no prifons,  
no officers to compel obedience,  
or inflit punifhment. Hence  
they generally ftudy oratory; the  
beit fpeaker having the moft in-  
fluence. The Indian women till  
the ground, drefs the food, nurfe  
and bring up the children,and pre-  
ferve and hand down to poferity  
the memory of publick tranfac-  
tions. Thefe employments of  
men and women are accounted  
natural and honourable. Hav-  
ing few artificial wants, they have  
abundance of leifure for improve-  
ment by converfation. Our la-  
borious manner of life compared  
with theirs, they efteem flavith  
and bafe; and the learning on  
which we value ourfelves, they  
regard as frivolous and ufelefs.  
Having frequent occafions to  
hold publick councils, they have  
acquired great order and decency  
ym conducting them. The old  
men fit in the foremoft ranks. the  
warriors in the next, and the wo-  
men and children in the hind-  
moft. The bufinefs of the wo-  
men is to take exact notice of  
what paffes, imprint it in their  
memories, for they have no writ-  
ing, and communicate it to their  
children, They are the records  
of the council, and they preferve  
tradition of the ftipulations in  
treaties a hundred years back ;  
which when we compare with  
our writings, we always find ex-  
att. He that would fpeak, rifes.  
The reft obferve a profound {fi-  
lence. When he has finifhed,  
  
and fits down, they leave him  
five or {ix minutes to recolled,  
that if he has omitted any thing  
he intended to fay, or has any  
thing to add, he may rife again,  
and deliver it, To interrupt an-  
other, even in common converla-  
tion, is reckoned highly indecent,  
  
The politeneis of thele favages  
in converifation is, indeed, carned  
to excefS ; fince it does not per-  
mit them to contradiét or Geny  
the truth of what is aflerted in  
their prefence, — mt this means  
they indeed avoid difputes ; but  
then it becomes dificult to know  
their minds, or what impreffion  
you make upon them. The mil-  
fionaries who have attempted to  
convert them to chriftianity, all  
complain of this as one of the  
great difficulties of their miflion,  
‘The Indians hear with patience  
the truths of the gofpel explained  
to them, and give their ulual tox-  
ens of affent and approbation ;  
You would think they were ‘cons  
vinced, No fuch matter, It is  
mere civility.  
  
A Swedifh minifter having af-  
fembled the chiefs of the Sufque-  
hanah Indians, made a fermon to  
them, acquainting them with the  
principal hiftorical faé&amp;ts on which  
our religion i$ founded ; fuch as  
the fall of our firft parents by  
eating an apple ; the coming of  
Chriit to repair the mifchief ; his  
miraclesand fuffering, &amp;c.--When  
he had finifhed, an Indian Orator  
ftood up tothank him, “ What  
you have told us,” fays he, “18  
all very good. It is indeed bad  
to eat apples. It is better to make  
them ail into cider. We are

things which you have heard  
from your mothers, In return,  
I will tell you fome of thofe we  
have heard from ours,  
  
« In the beginning, our fathers  
had only the flefh of animals to  
fubfift on ; andif their hunting  
was unfuccefsful, they were ftarv-  
ing. ‘Two of our young hunters  
having killed a deer, made a fire  
in the woods to broil fome parts  
of it. When they were about to  
fatisfy their hunger, they beheld  
a beautiful young woman defcend  
from the clouds, and feat herielf  
on that hill which you fee yonder  
among the Blue Mountains. They  
faid to. each other, it is a {pirit  
that perhaps has {melt our broil-  
ing venifon, and withes to eat of  
it: Let us offer fome to her,  
They prefented her with the  
tongue: She was pleafed with the  
tafte of it, and faid, your kind-  
nefs fhall be rewarded. Come to  
this place after thirteen moons,  
and you fhall find fomething that  
will be of great benefit in nourifh-  
ing you and your children to the  
late(t generations. They did fo,  
and, to their furprife, found plants  
they had never feen before ; but  
which, from that ancient time,  
have been conftantly cultivated  
among us, to our great advantage.  
Where her right hand had touch-  
ed the ground, they found maize ;  
where cc left hand had touched  
it, they found kidney beans ; and  
where her backfide had {at on it,  
they found tobacco.” The good  
Mifhonary, difgufled with this  
idle tale, bid, what I delivered to  
you were facred truths ; but what  
you tell me is mere fable, fiction,  
and falfehood.” The Indian, of-  
fended, replied, ‘* My brother,  
it feems your friends have not  
done you juftice in your educa-  
tion ; they have not well in-  
itru€ted you in the rulesof com-  
  
mon civility. You faw that we,  
who underftand and praétife thofe  
rules, believed all your ftories,  
why do you refufe to believe  
ours ?”  
  
When any of them come into  
our towns, our people are apt to  
crowd round them, gaze upon  
them, and incommodethem where  
they defire to be private ; this  
they efteem great rudenefs, and  
the effet of the want of inftruc-  
tion in the rules of civility and  
good manners, “ We have,”  
fay they, “* as much curiofity as  
you, and when you come into  
our towns, we wifh for opportu-  
nities of looking at you ; but for  
this purpofe we hide ourfelves be-  
hi buthes where you are to pafs,  
and never intrude ourfelves into  
your company.”  
  
Their manner of entering one  
another’s villages has likewile its  
rules. It is reckoned uncivil in  
travelling itrangers to enter a vil-  
lage abruptly, without giving no-  
tice of their approach. There-  
fore, as foon as they arrive with-  
in hearing, they flop and holla,  
remaining there till invited to  
enter. Two old men ufually come  
out to them and lead them in,  
There is in every village a vacant  
dwelling, called the Stranger’s  
houfe. Here they are placed,  
while the old men go round from  
hut to hut, acquainting the inhab-  
itants that ftrangers are arrived,  
who are probably hungry and  
weary ; and every one fends them  
what he can fpare of vitluals, and  
{kins to repofe on. When the  
ftrangers are refrefhed, pipes and  
tobacco are brought; and then,  
but not before, converfation be-  
gins, with enquisies who they are,  
whither bound, what news, &amp;c.  
and it ufually ends with offers of  
fervice, if the ftrangers have oc-  
  
cafion for guides, or any necefla-  
ries

ries for continuing their journey ;  
and nothing is exadted for the en-  
tertainment.  
  
The fame hofpitality, efteemed  
among them as a principal virtue,  
is prattifed by private perfons ;  
of which Conrad Wefer, our in-  
terpreter, gave me the following  
initance : He had been natural-  
ized among the Six Nations, and  
fpoke well the Mohock language.  
In going through the Indian  
country, to carry a meflage from  
our governour to the council at  
Onondaga, he called at the habita-  
tion of Canafferego, an old acquaint-  
ance, who embraced him, {pread  
furs for him to fit on, placed be-  
fore him fome boiled beans and  
venifon, and mixed fome rum and  
water for his drink. When he  
was well refrefhed, and had lit his  
pipe, Canalletego began to con-  
verfe with him; afked how he had  
fared the many years fince they  
had {cen each other, whence he  
then came, what had occafioned  
the journey, &amp;c. Conrad anfwer-  
ed all his quettions ; and when  
the difcourle began to flag, the  
Indian, to continue it, faid, * Con-  
  
rad, you have lived long among  
  
the white people, and know fome-  
thing of their cuftoms; I have  
been fometimes at Albany, and  
have obferved, that once in feven  
days they fhut up their fhops, and  
ailemble all in the great houfe ;  
tell me what it is for.—What do  
they do there?” « They meet  
there,” fays Conrad, “ to hear  
and learn good things.” “ Ido not  
doubt,” fays the Indian, * that  
they tell you fo; they have told  
me the fame ; but I doubt the  
truth of what they fay, and I will  
tell you my reafons, I went late-  
iy to Albany to fell my ikins, and  
buy blankets, knives, powder,  
rum, &amp;a. You know I generally  
ufed to deal with Hans Hanfon ;  
  
but I wasa little inclined this time  
totry fome other merchants, How-  
ever, 1 called firft upon Hans,  
and alked him what he would  
give for beaver. He faidhecould  
not give more than four fhhillin  
  
a pound : But, fays he, I cannot  
talk on bufinefs now ; this isthe  
day when we meet together to  
learn good things, and 1 am goin  
to the come: Sol thoug t to  
myftelf, fince 1 cannot do any bufi-  
nefs to day, 1 may as well goto  
the mecting too, and I went with  
him.— There ftood upa man in  
black, and began to talk to the  
people very angrily. I did not  
underftand what he faid; but per-  
ceiving that he looked muchat me,  
and at Hanfon, I imagined he was  
angry at feeing me there ; fo |  
went out, fat down near the houfe,  
{truck fire, and lit my Pipes wait-  
ing till the meeting fhould break  
up. I thought too that the man  
had mentioned fomething of beav-  
er, and I fufpeéted it might be the  
fubje&amp; of their meeting. So when  
they came out, | accofted my mer-  
chant—Well, Hans, fays I, I  
hope you have agreed to give me  
more than four fhillings a pound?”  
“ No, fays he, I cannot give fo  
much, I cannot give ‘more than  
three fhillings and fix pence,”  
‘sI then me to feveral other  
dealers, but they all fung the fame  
fong, three and fix pence, three  
and fix pence. This made it clear  
to me that my fufpicion was right;  
and that whatever they p  
  
of meeting to learn good things, the  
the real purpofe was to confult  
how tocheat Indians in the price  
ofbeaver. Confider but a little,  
  
Conrad, and you muft be of my  
opinion, If they meet fo often  
to learn good things, they certainly  
would have learned fome before  
this time. But they are ftill iz  
norant. You know our practice,

I treat you; wedry him if he is  
wet, we warm him if he is cold,  
and give him meat and drink, that  
that he may allay his thirft and

for him to reft and fleep on: We  
demand nothing in return, But  
if I go into a white man’s houfe  
in Albany, and afk for viétuals and  
drink, they fay, where is your  
  
  
  
money ? and if I have none, they  
fay, get out youlndiandag. You  
fee they have not yet learned thofe  
little good things that we need no  
meeting to be inftru&amp;ed in, be-  
caufe our mothers taught them to  
us when we were ahtdben ; and  
therefore it is impoffible their  
meetings fhould be, as they fay,  
for any fuch purpofe or have any  
fuch effeét ; they are only to con-  
trive the cheating of Indians in the  
price of beaver.

andth@Six Nations. Afterthe prin-

the Indians by a {pecch. that there  
was at Williamfburg a college with  
afund, for educating Indian youth;

lowing ; when their fpeaker began,  
by expreffing their deep fenfe of the  
kindnefs of the Virginia  govern-  
ment, in making them that offer;  
“for we know,’’ fays he, “* that you  
highly efteem the kind of learning  
taughtin thofe colleges, and that the  
Maintenance of our young men,  
while with you, would: be very ex-  
pentive to: you. We are convinced,  
therefore. that you mean to do us  
good by your propofal, and we thank  
you heartily, But you who are wile  
  
h and  
  
muft know that different nations  
have different conceptions of things ;  
and you will therefore not take it  
amifs, if our ideas of this kind of  
education happen not to be the fame  
with yours, We have had fome ex-  
perience of it : feveral of our young  
people were formerly brought up at  
the colleges of the northern -pro-  
vinees; they were initru€ted in all  
your {ciences ; but when they came  
back to us, they were bad runhers;  
ignorant of cvery means of living in  
the woods; unable to bear cither  
cold or hunger; Knew neither how  
to build a cabin, take a deer, or kill  
an enemy ; fpoke our language im-  
perfeétly ; were therefore neither fit  
for hunters. warriors, or counlelors;  
they were totally cood {  
  
We are however riot  
  
by your kind offer, t!  
  
grateful fenfe of it, if the gentlemen  
of Virginia will fend us a dozen of  
their fons, we will take great caré  
of tacir educttion. in ruét them in  
all we know, and make men’ of  
them.”  
  
Having frequent occafions to hold  
public councils, they have acquired  
great order and decency in condu@t-  
ing them. ‘The old men fit in the  
foremoft ranks, thé warriors in the  
next, and the women and children  
in the hindmo#. The bufirefs of  
the women is to take cxaét notice of  
what pafles, imprint itin their me-  
mories, for they have no writing,  
and communicate it to their chil-  
dren. They are the records of the  
council, and they preferve tradition  
of the ftipulations in treaties a hun-  
dred years back ; which, when” we  
compare with our writings, we al-  
ways find exatt. “He that “would  
fpeak, rifes. The re{t obferve a pro-  
found filence; When he has finifh-  
ed, and fits down, they leave him  
five or fix minutes ‘to recolle&amp;, that  
if he has omitted any thing” he int  
tended to fay, or has:any thing to  
add, he may rife again, and deliver  
it. To interrupt another, even in  
common conyerfation, is reckoned  
  
highly  
  
  
  
406  
  
highly indecent. How different this  
is from the conduét of a polite Bri-  
tifh Houfe of Commons, where  
fcarce a day pafles without fome con-  
fufion. that makes the Speaker hoarfe  
in calling to order ; and how diffcrent  
from the mode of converfation in  
many polite companies of Europe,  
where, if you do not deliver your  
fentence with great rapidity, you are  
cut off in the middle of it by the im-  
patient loquacity of thofe you con-  
verfe with, and never fuffered to  
Ginifh it!  
  
The politenefs of thefe favages in  
converiation, is, indeed, carried to  
excels; finceit does not permit them  
to contradift or deny the truth of  
what is aflerted in their prefence,  
By this means they indeed avoid dif-  
putes ; but then it becomes difficult  
to know their minds, or what im-  
preffion you make upon them, The  
miffionaries who have attempted to  
convert them to Chriftianity, all  
complain of this as anc of the great  
difficulties of their miffion. The  
  
Indians hear with patience thetruths  
of the gofpel explained to them, and  
give their ufual tokens of affent and  
approbation: you would think they  
  
were convinced. No fuch matter,  
Jt is mere civility.  
  
A Swedifh minifter having af-  
fembled the chiefs of the Saique-  
hhanah Indians, made a {ermon to  
them, acquainting them with the  
principal hiftorical facts on which  
our rcazicn is founded ; fuch as the  
fail of our firft parents by eating an  
apple; the coming of Chrift to re-  
pair the mifchicf ; his miracles and  
F flerin , &amp;e. When he had  
Enithed? an Indian orator ftood up  
to thank him. “ What you have  
told us,” fays he “ is all very good.  
It is indeed bad to eat apples. It is  
better to make them all into cyder,  
We are much obliged by your kind-  
nefs in coming fo far, to tell us thofe  
things which you have heard from  
your mothers. In return, I will tell  
you fome of thofe we have heard  
from ours,  
  
* In the beginning, our father&#x27;s  
  
Remarks on the Savages of North- America;  
  
had only the ficfh of animals to fil.  
fift on; and if their hunting wasup,  
fuccefsful, they were flarving, Twa  
of our young hunters having killed  
a deer, made a fire in the woods ty  
broil fome parts of it. Whent  
were about to fatisfy their hunger,  
they beheld a beautiful youn di  
man defcend from the clouds, and  
feat herfelf on that hill which you  
fec yonder among the Blue Moun.  
tains. They faid to each other, it  
is a {pirit that perhaps has finelt our  
broiling venfion, and wifhes to eat  
of it: let us offer fome to her. They  
prefented her with the tongue: thé  
was pleafed with the tafte of it, and  
faid, your kindnefs fhall be reward.  
ed, Come to this place after thir.  
teen moons, and you fhall find fome.  
thing that will be of great benefit in  
nourtfhing you and your childrente  
the lateft generations. They did fo,  
and to their furprife, found plants  
they had never feen before; but  
which, from that ancient time, have  
been con{tantly cultivated among us,  
to our great advantage. Where her  
night hand had touched the ground,  
they found maize; where her left  
hand had touched it, they found  
kidney-beans; and where her back  
fide had fat on it, they found to  
bacco,” The good Rey’ Saou dif.  
gufled with this idle tale, faid  
‘* What I delivered to you were fe  
* credtruths; but what you tellms  
‘ig mere fable, fidtion, and falle  
‘*hood,” The Indian, offended,  
replied, “ My brother, it feems yout  
* friends have not done you juftice  
* in your education ; they have not  
“ well inftru@ed you in the rulesof  
* common civility. You faw that  
‘we, who underftand and praftile  
* ¢hofe rules, believed all your ftor  
* ries, why do you refule to believe  
‘* ours ?”  
  
When any of them come into our  
towns, our people are apt to crowd  
round them, gaze upon them, and  
incommode them where they defre  
to be private; this they efteem great  
rudenefs, .and the effett of the want  
of inftrugtion in the rules mass

Woches where you are to pats, and

&amp; company.”  
  
Their manner of entering one an-  
others villages has likewife its rules,  
It is reckoned uncivil in travelling  
firangers to entra village abruptly,  
without giving notice: of their ap-  
proach. Therefore, as foon as they  
arrive within hearing, they ftop and  
hollow, remairring there till invited  
to enter. Two old men ufually  
come out to them, and lead them in.  
There is in every village a vaeant  
dwelling, called the ftranger’s houfe,  
Here they are placed, while the old  
men go round from hut to hut, ac-  
quainting the inhabitants that ftran-  
  
rs are arrived, who are probably  
ry and weary; and every one  
fend ‘them what he can fpare of  
yiduals, and {kins to repofe on,  
When the ftrangers are refrefhed,  
pipes and tobacco are brought; and  
then, but not befere, converfation  
begins, with enquiries who they are,  
whither bound, what news, &amp;c. and  
it ulually ends with offers of fer-  
vice; if the {trangers have occafion  
of guides, or any neceffaries for con-  
tinuing their journey; and nothing  
is exacted for the entertainment.  
  
The fame hofpitality, efteemed  
among them as a principal vistue, is  
prattifed by private perfons; of  
which Conrad Weifer, our interpreter,  
gave me the following tat  
He had been naturalized among the  
Six Nations, and {poke weH the  
Mohock language. fn going through  
the Indian country, to carry a mel  
fage from our governor to the coun-  
sil at Onondaga, he called at the ha-  
bitation of Canaffetego, an old ac-  
ene ai who embraced him,  
pread furs for him to fit on, placed  
before him fome boiled beans-and  
Yenifon, and mixed fome rum and  
Water for his drink,. When he was  
  
well refreflred, and had lit his pipe,  
Canaffetego began to converfe witlt  
him: afked how he had fared the  
many years fince they had feen each  
other, whence he then came, what  
occafioned the journey, &amp;c. Conrad  
anfwered all his queftions; and  
when the difcourfe began to flag,  
the Indian, to continuc it, faid,  
‘* Conrad, you have lived long  
among the white people, and know  
fomething of their cuftoms ; I have  
been fometimes at Albany, and have  
obferved, that once in feven days  
they fhut up their fhops, and aflem-  
ble all in the great houle; tell me,  
what is it for? What do they do  
there?” They meet there,” fays  
Conrad, “to hear and learn good  
things.” **I do not doubt,” fays  
the Indian, “ that they tell you fo;  
they have told me the fame: but I  
doubt the truth of what they fay,  
and I will tell you my reafons, 1  
went lately to Albany to fell my  
fkins, and buy blankets, knives,  
owder, rum, &amp;c. You know I  
ufed generally to deal with Hans  
Hanfon ; but I was a little inclinéd  
this time to try fome other mer-  
chants. However, I called firit  
upon Hans, and afked him what he  
would give for beaver. He faid he  
could not give more than four fhil-  
lings a pound: but, fays he, I can-  
not talk on bufinefs now; this is the  
day when we meet together to leara  
good things, and I am going to the  
meeting. So I thought to myfelf,  
fince I cannot do any bufinels to-  
day, 1 may as well go to the meet-  
ing too, and I went with him.  
There food up a man in black, and  
began to. talk to the people very  
angrily. I did not underftand what  
he faid; but pereeiving that he  
looked much at me, and at Hanfon,  
I imagined he was angry at {eeing  
me there; fo I went out, fat down  
near the houfe, ftruck fire, and lit  
my pips waiting till the meeting  
fhould break up. I thought too,  
that the man had mentioned fome-  
thing of beaver, and I fufpef&amp;ed it  
might be the fubje&amp; of their mect-  
ing.

ing. So when they camt out, I  
accofted my merchant. ‘“ Well,  
Hans,” fays I, “I hope you have  
agreed to give more than four fhil-  
lings a pound,” * No,” fays he,  
* ] cannot give fomuch, I cannot  
give more than three fhillings and  
fixpence.” I then {poke to feveral  
other dealers, but they all fung the  
fame fong, three and {fixpence,  
three and fixpence, This made it  
clear to me that my fufpicion was  
right; and that whatever they pre-  
tended of meeting to learn good  
things, the real purpofe was to con-  
fult how. to cheat Indians in the  
  
rice of beaver. Confider but a  
Fite, Conrad, and you muft be of  
my opinion. If they met fo often  
to learn good things, they would cer-  
tainly have learned fome before this  
time. But they are ftill ignorant.  
You know our practice. If a white

impartiality, we fhould find no peo-  
ple fo rude as to be without any  
rulcs of politencfs ; nor any fo po-  
lite as not to have fome remaius of  
rudenefs.  
  
The Indian men, when young,  
are hunters and warriors; when  
old, counfellors; for all their go-  
vernment is by the countel or ad-  
vice of the fages; there is no force,  
there are no prifons, no officers to  
eompel obedience, or infli&amp; punif-  
ment. Hence they generally ftudy  
oratory; the beft {peaker having  
the moft influence. The Indian  
women till the ground, dicts the  
food, nurfe and bring up the chil-  
dren, and preferve and hand down  
to pofterity the memory of public  
tranfaGtions. ‘Thefe employments  
of men and women are accounted  
natural and honourable. Having  
few artificial wants, they have  
abundance of Icifure for improve-  
ment by converiation. Our labo-  
rious manner of life compared  
with theirs, they efteem flavifh and  
hafe ; and the learning on which  
we value ourfelves, they regard as  
frivolous and ufele!s, An inftance  
of this occurred at the treaty of  
Lancafter in Pennfilvania, anno  
1744, between the government of  
Virginia and the Six Natioas.  
After the principal bufinefs was  
fettled, the commiflioners from  
Virginia acquainted the Indians  
by a fpeech, that there was at  
Williamfburgh a college with a  
fund, for educating Indian youth ;  
and that if the chiefs of the Six  
Nations would fend down half a  
dozen of their fons to that college,  
the government would take care  
that they fhould be well provided  
for, and inftruéted in all the learn-  
ing of the white people. It is onc  
of the Indian rules of politeneis not  
to anfwer a public propolition the  
fame day that it is made; they  
think it would be treating it as a  
light matter; and that they thew

it refpe&amp; by taking time to confi-  
der it, as of a matter important.  
They therefore deferred their an-  
fwer till the day fotlowing ; when  
their fpeaker began, by expreiling  
their deep fenfe of the kindnefs  
of the Virginian government, in  
making them that oiJer; * for we  
know,” fays he, * that you highly  
efteem the kind of learning taught  
in thole colleges, end that the  
maintenance of our young men,  
while with you, would be very ex-  
penfivetoyou. Weare convinced,  
therefore, that you mean to do us  
good by yeur propofal, and we  
thank you heartily. But you who  
are wile muft know that different  
nations have diiferent conceptions  
of things; and you will therefore  
not take it amifs, if our ideas of  
this kind of education happen not  
to be the fame with yours, We have  
had fome experience of it: feveral  
ol our young people were former-  
ly bought up at the colleges of  
the norhern provinces ; they were  
in 41 .ucted in all your {ciences ; but  
when they came back to us, they  
were bad runners; ignorant of  
every means of living in the  
woods ; unable to bear cither cold  
or hunger; knew neither how to  
build a cabin, take a deer, or kill  
an eneiny ; {poke our language im-  
perfettly ; were therefore neither  
fit for hunters, warriors, or coun{cl-  
lors; they were totally good for  
nothing. We art however not the  
lets obliged by your kind offer,  
though we decline accepting it:  
and to fhew our srateful fenle of  
it, if the gentlemen of Virginia  
will fend us a dozen of their fons,  
we will take great care of their  
education, inflru&amp;t them in all we  
know, and make men of them.”  
Having frequent occafions to  
hold public councils, they have ac-  
quired great order and decency in  
conduéting them. The old men fit

children in the hindmoft, The  
bufinefs of the women is to take  
exact notice of what paties, imprint  
it in their memories, for they have  
no writing, and communicate it to  
their children, ‘They are the re-  
cords of the counci!, and they pre-  
ferve tradition of the Ripulations  
in treaties a hundred years back;  
which, when we compare with our  
writings, we always find exaét,  
Tie that would {peak, riles. ‘The  
yeft obferve a profound filence.  
When he has finifhed, and fits  
down, they leave him five or fx  
minutes to recolleét, that if he has  
omitted any thing he intended to  
fay, or has any thing to add, he  
may rife again, and deliver it. To  
interrupt another, even in come  
mon converfation, is reckoned  
highly indecent, How different  
this is from the condué of a polite  
Britifh Houle of Commons, where  
fearce a day pafles without fome  
confulion, that makes the Speaker  
hoarte in calling to order ; and how  
different from the mode of conver-  
fation in many polite companies of  
Europe, where, if you do not de-  
liver your fentence with great rapi-  
dity, you are cut off in the middle  
of it by the impatient loquacity of  
thofe you converfe with, and ne-  
ver fuffered to finifh it!  
  
The politenefs of thefe favages  
in converfation, is, indeed, carned  
to excefs; fince it does not permit  
them to contradxt or deny the  
  
ruth of what is afflerted in their  
prefence. By this means they in-  
deed avoid difputes; but then it  
becomes difficult to know their  
minds, or what imprefhon you  
make upon them. ‘The miffiona-  
ries who have attempted to con-  
vert them to Chriftianity, all com-  
plain of this as one of the great  
difficulties of their miffion, ‘The  
Indians hear with patience the  
truths of the gofpel explained to  
them, and give their ufual tokens  
of ailent and approbation: you  
  
would think they were convineed,  
No fuch matter, It is mere ci-  
viliiy.  
  
A Swedith minifter having af-  
fembled the chiefs of the Safque-  
hanah Indians, made a fermon to  
them, acquainting them with the  
principal hiftorical faéts on which  
our religion is founded; fuch as  
the fall of our firlt parents by cat-  
ing an apple; the coming of Chrift  
to repair the mifchiel ; his miracles  
and fuffering, &amp;c.—When he had  
finifhed, an Indian orator ftood up  
to thank him. ‘* What you have  
told us,” fays he, “ is all very good.  
It is indeed bad to eat apples. Itis  
better to make thein all into cyder.  
Weare much obliged by your kind-  
nefs in coming {o far, to tell us  
thofe things which you have heard  
from your mothers. In retuin I  
will tell you fome of thofe we have  
heard from ours. —  
  
“In the beginning, our fathers  
had only the fleth of anizmals to  
fubfift on ; and if their hunting was  
unfuccefsful, they were ftarving,  
Two of our young hunters having  
killed a deer, made a fire in the  
woods to, broil fome parts of it.  
When they were about to fatisfy  
their hunger, they beheld a beau-  
tiful young woman deicend from  
the clonds, and feat herfelf on that  
hill which you fee yonder among  
the Blue Mountains. They faid  
to cach other, it is a {pirit that per-  
haps has finelt our broiling vent-  
fon, and wifhes to cat of it: let  
us offer fome to her, They pre-  
fented her with the tongue: fhe

and faid, your kindnefs fhall be

find fomething that will be of great  
benefit in nourifhing you and your  
children to the lateft generations.

cvltivated among us, to our great  
advantage. Where her right hand  
had touched the ground, they  
found maize; where her left hand  
had touched it, they found kidney-  
beans; and where her back-fide  
had fat on it, they found tobacco.”  
The good mifhonary, difgulted  
with this idle tale, faid, “* What I  
ilelivered to you were facred truths ;  
but what you tell me is mere fable,  
fiction, and falfehood.” ‘The In-  
dian, offended, replied, “ My bro-  
ther, it feems your friends have  
not done you juitice in your edu-  
cation; they have not well in-  
itruéted you in the rules of com-  
mon civility. You faw that we,  
who underfland and prattile thole  
rules, belicved all vour flories,  
why do you refufe to believe  
ours ?”  
  
When any of them come into  
our towns, our people are apt to  
crowd round them, gaze upon  
them, and incommode them where  
they defire to be private ; this they  
efteem great rudenels, and the ef-  
fe&amp; of the want of inflruétion in  
the rules of civility and good man-  
ners. “ We have,” fay they, “as  
mach curiofity as you, and when  
youcome into our towns, we wifh  
for opportunities of looking at  
you; but for this purpofe we hide  
ourfelves behind bufhes where you  
are to pafs, and never intrude our-  
felves into your company.”  
  
Their manner of entering one  
another’s villages has likewife its  
rules. It is reckoned uncivil in  
travelling ftrangers to enter a vil-  
lage abruptly, without giving no-  
tice of their approach. ‘lherefore,  
as foon as they arrive within hear-  
ing, they flop and hollow, remain-  
ing there till invited to enter. Two  
old men ufually come out to them,  
and lead them in. There is in  
every village a vacant dwelling,  
talled the {tranger’s houfe. Here  
they are placed, while the old men  
go round from hut to hut, ace  
  
quainting the inhabitants that ftran-  
gers are arrived, who are probably  
hungry and weary; and every one  
fends them what he can {pare of  
victuals, and {kins to repofe on.  
When the ftrangers are refrefhed,  
p’pes and tobacco are brought ; and  
then, but not before, converfation  
begins, with enquiries who they  
are, whither bound, what news,  
&amp;e, and it generally ends with  
ollers of fervice; if the ftrangers  
have occation of guides, or any  
neceflaries for continuing their  
journey ; and nothing is exatted  
tor the entertainment.  
  
The fame hofpitality, efleemed  
among them as a principal virtue,  
is practifed by private perions; of  
which Conrad Weifer, our interpre-  
ter, gave me the following in~  
flances He had been naturalized  
among the Six Nations, and {poke  
well the Mohock language. In  
going through the Indian country,  
to carry a melfage from our go-  
vernor to the council at Oxondaga,  
he called at the habitation of Ca-  
naifetego, an old acquaintance, Who  
embraced him, fpread furs for him  
to fit on, placed before him fome  
boiled beans and venifon, and  
mixed fome rum and water for his  
drink. When he was well re-  
frefhed, and had lit his pipe, Ca-  
nafletego began to converfe with  
him: afked how he had fared the  
many vears fince they had feen  
cach other, whence he then came,  
what occafioned the journey, &amp;c.  
Conrad an{wercd all his queftions;  
and when the difcourfe began to  
flag, the Indian, to continue it,  
faid, *“ Conrad, you have lived  
long among the white people, and  
know fomething of their cuftoms ;  
I have been fometimes at Albany  
and have obferved, that once in  
feven days they fhut up thcir fhops,

Dr. FRANKLIN’s REMARKS  
Concerning the SAvacEs of North America.  
From bis Efjays. 1  
e eDt o S |  
SAVAGES we call them, because their man­  
ners differ from ours, which we think the per­  
feCion of civility ; they think the fame of  
theirs.  
Perhaps, if we could examine the manners of  
different nations with impartality, we should  
find no people so rude as to be without any  
rules of politeness : nor any {o polite as not to  
have {fome remains of rudeness.  
The Indian men, when young, are husnters  
and warriors; when old, counicllors ; for all.  
their government is by the counsel or advice of  
the sages ; there 1s no force, there are no pri­  
son, no officers to compel obedience, or inflitt  
punishment. Hence they generally study ora­  
tory ; the best speaker having the most influ­  
cnce.  
The Indian women tiil the ground, dress the  
food, nurle and bring up the children, and pre­  
serve and hand down to posterity, the memory  
of public tranfattions. These employments of  
men and women are accounted natural and ho­  
norable. Having few artificial wants, they have  
abundance of leisure for improvement by con­  
versation. Qur laborious manner of life, com­  
pared with theirs, they esteem {lavith and base ;  
and the learning on which we value ourlelves,  
they regard as frivolous and ulelefs. An in­  
stance of this occurred at the Treaty of Lanca/-  
terin Pemfylvania, Anno 1744, between the go­  
vernment of Virginza and the Six Nations. Af­  
ter the principal bufinels was fettled, the Com­  
missioners from Virginia acquainted the Indians  
by a speech, that there was at JVilliamfourgh a  
College, with a fund, for educating Indian  
youth ; and thatif the Chiefs of the Silx Nations  
would fend down half a dozen of their sons to  
that College, the government would take care  
that they should be well provided for, and in­  
flrufted in all the learning of the white people.  
It is one of the Indian rules of politeness not to  
«answer a public proposition the fame day thatit  
is made ; they think it would be treating it as  
a light matter ; and that they thew it refpett by  
taking time to confider It, as of a matter Im‘por­  
tant.. They therMore deferrcd - their answer  
till the day following ; when their f;?eaker be­  
gan, by exprefling their deep fenle of the kind­  
ness of the Virgioia government, in making  
them that offer ; ¢¢ For we know, (fays he) that  
you kighly esteem the kind of learning taught in  
those Cilleges, and that the maintenance of our  
young men, while with ycu, would be very expen-  
Jive to you. We are convinced therefore, that  
you mean to do us good by your propefal ; and  
we thank you heartily. But you who are wife  
wrafd know, that different nations have different  
conceptions of things ; and you will therefore not  
take it amiss, if our ideas of this kind of educa­  
tion happen not to be the fame with yours. We  
kave had some experience of it : several of our  
young people were formerly brought up at the  
Colleges of the Nothern Provinces ; they were  
inflrulled in all your sciences ; but when they  
came back to us, they were bad runners ; gnor­  
ant of every means of living in the woods ; una­  
ble to bear either cold or hunger ; hknew ncither  
how to build a cabin, take a deer, or kill an enc­  
my ; [poke our language imperfellly ; were  
therefore ncither fit for hunters, warriors, or  
counfillors : they were totally good for nothing.  
We are however not the less obliged by your hind  
offer, though we decline accepting it ; and to  
Jhew our grateful sense of ity if the Gentlemen of  
Virginia will fend us a dozen of their sons, we  
will take great care of their education, infiruét  
them in all we know, and make MEN of them.”  
Having frequent occasions to hold public  
Councils, they have acquired great order and  
decency in condutting them. The old men fit  
in the foremoft ranks, the warriors in the next,  
and the women and children in the hindmost.  
The business of the women 1s to take exaét no­  
tice of what pafles, imprintit in their memories,  
(for they have no writing) and communicate 1t  
. to their children.—They are the Records of the  
Council, and they preserve tradition of the {ti­  
pulations in treaties an hundred years back ;  
which when we compare with our writings, we  
always find exaft. He that would speak nifes.  
The rest oblerve aprofound silence. Whenhe  
- has finithed, and fits down, they leave him five  
or fix minutes to recollet, that if he has omit­  
ted any thing he intended to fay, or has any  
thing to add, he may rife again and deliver It.  
To interrupt another, even in common conver­  
sation, is reckoned highly indecent. How dif­  
ferent this is from the conduét of a polite Brzi­  
ifh House of Commons, where {carce a day palies  
without some confufion, that makes the Speaker  
hoarse in calling to order ; and how different  
from the mode of conversation, in many polite  
companies of Europe, where, if you do not de­  
liver a sentence with great rapidity, you are cut  
off in the middle of it, by the impatient loqua­  
city of those you converse with, and never {uf­  
fered to ﬁnilK it. . :  
- The politeness of the Savages in conversation,  
1§ indeed, carried to excess ; since it docs not  
  
| permit them to contradiét or deny the truth of  
&#x27;what 1s asserted in their presence. By this  
!means they indeed avoid diflf))utes ; but then 1t  
becomes difficult to know their minds, or what  
mmprefiion you make uponthem. The Mission­  
aries who have attempted to convert them to  
Christianity, all complain of this as one of the  
greatest difficulties ofP their miflion. The In­  
dians hear with patience the truths of the Gol­  
pel explained to them, and give their usual to­  
xens o}PafTent and approbation ; you would think  
they were convinced. No such matter. It is  
mere civility.  
A Sweedifh Minifterthaving assembled the  
Chiels of the Sufguchanna Indians, made a Ser­  
mon to them, acquainting them with the prin­  
cipal historical fatts on which our religion is  
founded ; such as the fall of our firft parents by  
cating an apple; the coming of Chriiﬁ)to repair  
the mifchief ; hismiracles and fufferings, &amp;c.—  
When he had finifhed, an Indian Orator flood  
up to thank him. ¢ What you have told us  
(fays he) zs all very good. It is indeed bad to  
eat apples. It s better to make them all into Cy­  
der. We are much obliged by your kindness in  
coming fo_far, to tell us those things which you  
nave keard from your mothers. In return, I  
will tell you some of those we have heard from  
ours. :  
¢ In the beginning, our fathers had only the  
flefh of animals to {fubfilt on ; and if their hun­  
ting was unfuccefsful, they were {larving.”  
¢ Two of our young hunters having killed a  
deer, made a fire in the woods to broil some  
parts of 1t : When they were about to fatsfy  
their hunger, they beheld a beautiful young wo­  
man descend from the clouds, and {eat herfelf  
on that hill which you {fee yonder among the  
blue mountains. They said to each other, it 1s  
a {pirit that perhaps has {melt our broiling ven­  
ison, and wishes to eat of 1t ; let us offer some  
to her. They presented her with the tongue :  
she was pleased with the taste of It, and said,  
Your kindnels shall be rewarded.—Come to  
this place after thirteen moons, and you shall  
find something that will be of great benefit 1n  
nourishing ycu and y our ghildrcn, to. the latefl  
generations. They did {o, and to their surprise.  
tound plants they had never seen before ; but  
which, from that ancient time, have been con­  
stantly cultivated among uS$ to our great advan­  
tage. Where her right hand touched the ground,  
they found maize ; where her left hand had  
touched 1t they found 4:idney beans ; and where  
ner backside had fat on it, they found tobacco.”  
. The good Miflionary disgusted with this idle  
tale said,  
¢ What I delivered to you were sacred  
truths ; but what you tell me 1s mere fable, fic­  
tion and falthood.”  
  
The offended Indian replied,  
¢¢ My Brother, it seems your friends have not  
done you justice in your education ; they have  
not well inftruéted you in the rules of common  
cvility. You saw that we, whounderftand and  
prattice those rules,believed all your stories, why  
do you refuie to believe ours ¥  
When any of them come Into our towns, our  
people are apt to crowd round them, gaze upon  
them, and incommode them when they desire to  
be private ; this they esteem great rudeness, and  
the effet of the want of inftruélion in the rules of  
civility and good manners.  
¢ We have ({ay they) as muck curiosity as you,  
and when you come into our towns, we wifk for  
opportunities of looking at you ; but for this pur­  
pose we hide ourselves behind bushes where you  
are to pass, and never intrude ourselves into your  
company.’?  
Their manner of entering one another’s villa­  
ges has likewile its rules. Itis reckoned uncivil  
in travelling firangers to enter a village abruptly  
without giving notice of theirapproach. There­  
fore, as {foon as they arrive within hearing, they  
stop and hollow, remaining there till mvited to  
enter. Two old men usually come out to them,  
and lead them in. There 1s in every village a  
vacant dwelling, called, Tke Stranger’s Houfz.  
Here they are placed, while the old men go  
round from hut to hut, acquainting the inhabi­  
tants that strangers arc arrived, who are probably  
hungry and weary ; and every one fends them  
what he can {pare of vi€tuals, and skins to repose  
on. When the strangers are refrefhed, pipes  
and tobacco are brought ; and then, but not be­  
fore, conversation begins, with inquiries who  
they are ? whither bound ? what news ? &amp;c.  
‘and 1t usually ends with offers of {fervice ; if the  
stranger have occasion of guides, or any neces­  
saries for continuing their journey ; and nothing  
15 exatted for the entertainment.  
The fame hospitality, esteemed among them  
as a principal virtue, 1s prafticed by private per­  
sons ; of which ConraD WEISER, our in­  
terpreter, gave me the following instance. He  
had been naturalized among the fix nations, and  
and spoke very well the mohawk language. In  
going through the Indian country, to carry a mes­  
sage from our Governor to the council at Onon­  
daga, he called at the habitation of Cana/fetego,  
an old acquaintancc, who embraced him, {pread  
furs for him to fit on, placed before him some  
boiled beans and venison, and mixed some rum  
  
T H E  
  
and water for his drink. &#x27;When he was well re­  
frefhed, and had lit his pipe, Canaflctego began  
to converle with him, alked how he had fared the  
many years since they had seen each other,  
whence he then came, what occasioned the jour­  
ney, &amp;c. ConraD answered all his quel­  
tions ; and when the difcouric began to flag, the  
Indian to continue 1t said,  
““ CoNrAD, you have lived long among the  
white people, and know something of their cus­  
toms ; I have been sometimes at ™ Albany, and  
have observed, that once in seven days they shut  
up their shops, and assemble all in the great  
house ; «ll me what 1s it for 7 What do they  
do there 27  
‘¢ They meet there (fays Conrad) to hear and  
learn good things.” Ido not doubt (fays the  
Indian) that they tell you so ; they have told me  
the fame ¢ but 1 doubt the truth of what they  
fay, and I will tell you my reasons.—l went  
lately to Albany to fell my skins, and buy blan­  
kets, knives, powder, rum, &amp;c. You know I  
used generally to deal with Haxs HaANsoON ;  
but I was a little inclined this time to try some  
other merchants. However, I called firft upon  
Hans, and alked him what he-would give for  
Beaver ?° He said he could not give more than  
4 {hillings a pound : but, fays he, I cannot talk  
on business now ; this is the day we meet to  
learn good things, and I am going to the meet­  
ing. So I tho’t to myfelf, since I cannot do any  
business to day, I may as well goto the meeting  
too, and I went with him. There stood up a  
man 1n black, and began to talk to the people  
very angrily. Idid notunderfland what he said ;  
but perceiving that he looked much at me and  
at Hanson, I imagined that he was angry at fee­  
ing me there ; {o I went out, {at down near the  
house, firuck fire, and it my pipe waiting ’ull  
the meeting thould brake up. I tho’t too that  
the man had mentioned something of Beaver,  
and I {ufpeéted it might be the fubjeét of their  
meeting. So when they came out, I accosted my  
merchant——Well, Hans, (fays 1) I hope you  
have agreed to give more than 4 shillings a  
pound. No (fays he) I cannotgive so much, I  
cannot give more than three {hllings and 6d.  
¢ I then spoke to several other dealers, but  
they all sung the fame f{ong, gs. 6d. gs. 6d. This  
made it clear to me that,ngy fulpicion was right ; l  
and that whatever they pretended of meeting to  
learn good things, they would certainly have  
learned some before this time.——But they are  
still ignorant. You know our praétice. Isa  
white man, in travelling through our country, en­  
ters one of our cabins, we all treat him as I do  
you ; we dry him if he is wet, we warm him 1f  
he 1s cold, and give him meat and drink, that we  
may allay his thirst and hunger ; and we {pread  
{oft furs for him to rest and flcep on ; we de­  
mand nothing in return.*  
But if I go into a white man’s houle at Albim_)’  
and ask for viftuals and drink, they fay, where 1s  
your money : and if I have none, they fay, get  
out you Indian Dog. You sec they have not  
yet learned those little good things, that we need  
no meetings to be ihftruted in, because our mo­  
thers taught them to uswhen we were children;  
and therefore 1t 1s imtpo{ﬁble their meetings  
should be (as they fay) for any such purpole, or  
‘have any {uch effett ; they are only to contrive,  
the cheating of Indians in the price of Beaver.

REMARKS CONCERNING THE SAVAGES  
oth OF NORTH AMERICA.  
  
—  
  
AVAGES we call chem, becauſe their man-  
ners differ from ours, which we think the  
perfection of civility; they think the ſame of theirs.  
  
Perhaps, if we could examine the manreis of  
different nations with impartiality, we ſhould find  
no people ſo rude as to be without any cules of  
politeneſs; nor any ſo politc as not to have ſome  
  
  
The Indian men, when young, are hunters and  
warriors; when old, counlellors ; for all their ow.  
vernment is by the counſel or advice of ſages;  
there is no force, there are no priſons, no officers  
  
  
they generally ftudy oratory; the beſt ſpeaket  
having the moſt influence. The Indian women  
till the ground, dreſs the food, nurſe and bring up  
the children, and preſerve and hand down to pol.  
  
terity the memory of public tranſactions. Tbeſe  
employments of men and women are accounted  
natural and honourable. Having few artificial  
wants, they have abundance of leifure for improve-  
ment by converſation- Our laborious manner of  
life, compared with theirs, they eſteem flavith and  
baſe 3 and the leatning on which we value our-  
ſelves, they regard as frivolous and uſeleſs. An  
inſtance of this otcurred. at the treaty of Lancaſter,  
  
in Pennſylvania, anno 1744, between the govern-  
ment of Virginia and the Six Nations. After the  
Pi ipal Lufineſs was ſettled, the commiſſioners  
  
from  
  
  
96 5 kssars, 1 a  
from Virginia acquainted&quot; the Indians by a ſpeech,  
that there was at Williamſburg a college, with a  
fund, for educating Indian youth; and that if  
the chiefs of the Six Nations would ſend down half  
à dozen of their ſons to that college, the govern-  
ment would take care that they ſhould be well pro-  
| vided for, and inſtructed in all the learning of the  
I white people. It is one of the Indian rules of po-  
liteneſs not to anſwer a public propofition the ſame  
day that it is made; they think it would be treat-  
ing it as a light matter; and they ſhew it reſpect  
by taking&#x27;time to conſider it, as of a matter import-  
ant. They therefore deferred their anſwer till the  
day following; when their ſpeaker began, by ex-  
e theit deep ſenſe of the kindneſs of the  
irginia government, in making them that offer;  
kor we know (ſays he) that you highly eſteem  
the kind of learning taught in thoſe colleges, and  
that the maintenance of our young men, while with  
vou, would be very expenſive to you. We are  
convinced, therefore, that you mean to do us good  
by your propoſal, and we thank you heartily. But  
Jou ho are wiſe, muſt know, that different na-  
tions have different conceptions of things; and you  
Will therefore not take it amiſs, if our ideas of this  
kind of education happen not to be the {ame with  
yours. We haye had ſome experience of it: ſe-  
vetal of our young people were formerly brought  
at tbe colleges of the northern provinces; they  
Mere infiructed in alllyour ſciences; but when they  
came back to us, they were bad runners; igno-  
- - rant of every means cf living in the woods; una-  
ble to bear either cold or hunger; ; knew neither  
how to build a cabin, take a deer, or kill an ene-

lors; they were totally good for nothing. We  
  
ſee however nat the leſs obliged by your kind of-  
though we decline accepting it: and to ſhow. -  
  
vur grateful ſenſe of it, if the gentlemen of Virgi-  
  
nia will ſend us a dozen of their ſons, we will Tye  
  
  
we know, and make men of them.”  
  
Having frequent occaſions to hold public coun-  
cils, they have acquired great order and decency  
in conducting them. The old men fit in the fore.  
moſt ranks, the warriors in the next, and the wo-  
men and children in the hindmoſt. The buſineſs  
  
  
imprint it in their memories, for chey have no Writs  
ing, and communicate it to their children. They  
are the records of the council, and they preſerve  
tradition of the ſtipulations in treaties a hundred  
  
years back; which, when we compare with our  
  
  
ak, riſes. The reſt obſerve a profound ſilence.

of it by the Inhpdeht loquacity of thoſe yo con  
verſe with, and never ſuffered to finiſn it!  
The politeneſs of theſe ſavages in converſation,  
is, indeed, carried to excels; fince it does not per-  
mit them to contradict or deny the truth of what  
is aſſerted in their preſence. By this means they  
indeed avoid diſputes; but then it becomes difh-  
cult to know their minds, or what impreſſion you  
make upon them. The miſſionaries Who have at-  
  
  
plain of this as ove of the great difficulties of their  
  
miſſion. The Indians hear with patience the truths  
of-the goſpel explained to them, and give their u-  
ſual tokens of aſſent and approbation: you would  
think they were convinced. No ſuch matter. It  
  
is mere-civility. ©

this idle tale, ſaid, What l delivered to you were  
ſacred truths; but what you tell me is mere fable,  
fiction, and falſehood. The Indian, offended, re-  
plied, (My brother, it ſeems your friends have  
not done you juſtice in your education; they have  
not well inſtrudted you in the rules of common  
civility, - You ſai that we, who underſtand and

do you refuſc to believe ours? |  
When any of them come into our towns, our  
people are apt to crowd round them, gaze upon

Klee Eg buſhes where you afe to paſs, and  
Never intrude ourſelves into your company.“  
Their manner of entering one another&#x27;s villages |  
Has likewiſe its rules. It is reckoned uncivil in  
travelling ſtrangers to enter a village abruptly,  
without giving notice of their approach. There-  
fore, as Loon as they arrive within hearing, they  
ſtop and hollow, remaining there till invited to en-  
ter. Two old men uſually come out to them, and  
lead them in. There is in every village a vacant  
dwelling, called the firangers* houſe. Here they  
are placed, while the old men go round from hut  
to hut, acquainting the inhabitants that ſtrangers  
art arrived, who are probably hungry and weary;

The ſame hoſpitality, eſteemed among them as  
  
2 principal virtue, is practiſed by private perſons ;  
of which Conrad Weifer, &#x27; or interpreter, gave me

he was well refreſhed, and had lit his pipe, Canaſ-  
ſetego began to converſe with him: aſked how he  
had fared the many years ſince they had ſeen each

and when the diſcourſe began to flag, the Indian,  
to continue it, ſaid, © Conrad, you have lived  
long among the white people, and know ſomething  
of their cuſtoms; I have been ſometimes at Alba-  
ny, and have obſerved, that once in ſeven d

and buy blankets, knives, powder, rum, &amp; c. You  
know. I uſed generally to deal with Hans Hanſon  
but I was a little inclined this time to try ſome o-  
ther merchants. However, I called fiiſt ypon Hans,  
and aſked him what he would give for beaver. : He  
faid he could not give more than four ſhill-  
ings a pound: but, ſays he, I cannot talk on bu-  
  
ſineſs now; this is the day when we meet t |  
to learn good things, and I am going to the meeting.  
80 I.thought to myſelf, ſince I cannot do any bu-  
fineſs to-day, I may as well go to the meeting too,

I did not underſtand what he ſaid; but perceiving  
that he looked much at me, and at Hanſon, I ima-

I thought too that the man had mentioned ſome-  
thing of beaver, and I ſuſpected it might be the  
  
  
 Eaccoſted my metchant. Well, Hans,“ ſays I,

pence, three and fix-pence. This made it clear  
to me that my ſuſpicion was right; and that what-  
ever they pretended of meeting to learn good things,  
the purpoſe was to conſult bow to cheat Indians in  
the price of beaver. Conſider but a little, Conrad,  
and you muſt be of my opinion. If they met ſo

er, even in common converfa-  
tion, isreckoned highly indecent.  
  
The politeness of thefe favages  
in converfation is, indeed, carried  
to excefs ; fince it dees not per-  
mit them to contraditt or deny  
the truth of what is afferted in  
their prefence. By this means  
they indeed avoid difputes; bat  
then it becemes difficult to know  
their minds, or what impreflion  
you make rr them. The mif-  
fionaries who have attempted to  
convert them to chriftianity, all  
complain of this as one of the  
great difficulties of their miflion.  
The Indians hear with patience  
thetruths of the gofpel explained  
to them, and give their ufual tok-  
en of ailent and apprebation :  
You would think they were con-  
winced. No fuch mattér. It is  
mere civility.  
  
A Swedith minifter having af-  
fembled the chiefs of the Syique-  
hannah indians, made a fermoun to  
them, acquainting them with the  
principal hiftorical facts on which  
our religion is founded ; fuch as  
the fall of our firft parents by  
eating an apple ; the coming of  
Chriit to repair the mifchief ; his  
miracles and fuffering, &amp;c. When  
he had finithed, an Indian Orator  
ftood upto thank him. ‘* What  
you have told us,” faid he ¢¢ is  
all very good. It is indeed bad  
toeatapples. Itis better to make  
them all into cider. We are  
much obliged by your kindnefs  
in coming fo far, to tell us thofe  
things which you have heard  
from your mothers. In return,  
I will tell you fome of thofe we  
have heard from ours.  
  
&lt;¢ In the beginning, our fathers  
  
had only the fief of animals to  
  
fubfift on ; and if their hunting  
was unfucce{stul they were ttarv-  
  
ing. . Twoof our young hunters  
having killed a deer, made a fire  
in the woods to broil fome part  
of it. When they were about to  
fatisfy their hunger, they beheld  
a beautiful young woman defcend  
from the clouds, and feat herfelf  
on that hill which you fee yonder  
among the Blue Mountains, They  
faid to each other, it is a fpirit  
that perhaps has {melt our broil-  
ing venifon, and wifhes to eat of  
it : Let us offer fome to her.  
They prefented her with the  
tongue : She was pleafed with the  
tafte of it, and faid, your kind-  
nefs fhall be rewarded.  
this place after thirteen moons,  
and you fhall find fomething that  
will ke of great benefit in nourifh-  
ing youand your children to the  
lateft generations. They did fo,  
and, to their furprife, found plants  
they had never feen before ; but  
which, from that ancient time,  
have been confiantly cultivated  
among us, to our great advantage.  
W here her right hand had touch-  
ed the ground, they found maize ;  
where her left hand had touched  
it, they found kidney beams ; and  
where her backfide had {fat on ir,  
they found tobacco.”” ‘The good  
Miffionary, difgufted with this  
idle tale, faid, “what I delivered to  
  
you were facred truths ; but what!) ©&quot;  
you tell me is mere fable, fiction,’ 7 /  
  
and falfehood.”” ‘The Indian, of—

HE Indian men, when young,

government is by the counsel or

S.  
  
Having frequent occasions to  
hold public councils, they have  
acquired great order and decency  
in conducting them. The old  
men sit in the foremost ranks; the  
warriors in the next, and the wo-  
men and children in the hindmost.  
The Lusiness of the women is to  
take exact notice of what passes,  
imprint it in their memories, for  
they have no writing, and com-  
municate it to theirchildren. They  
are the records of the council, and  
they preserve tradition of the stipu-  
lations in treaties a hundred years  
back; which, when we compare  
with our writings, we always find  
exact. He that would speak, ri-  
ses. The rest observe a profound  
silence. When he has finished,

that if he has omitted any thing he  
intended to say; or has any thing  
to add, he may rise again, and de«  
liver it. To interrupt anot&gt;er;  
even in common conversation, is  
reckoned highly indecent.  
The politeness of these savages  
in conversation, is indeed carried  
to excess, since it does not pers  
mit them to contradict, or deny  
the truth of what is asserted in  
their presence. By this means  
they indeed avoid disputes; but  
then it becomes difficult to know  
their minds; or what impression  
you make upon them. The mis-  
sionaries who have attempted to  
convert them to Christianity, alk  
complain of this as one of the great  
difficulties of their mission: Th  
Indians hear with patience the  
truths of the gospel explained to  
them, and give their usual tokens  
of assent and approbation: you  
would think they were convinced.  
No such matter; it is mereciyility..  
  
A Swedish minister having as~  
  
sembled the chiefs of the Sisque-  
hannah Indians, made a serrnon to  
  
them, acquainting them with the,  
  
principal historical facts on which,  
  
our religion is founded; such as,  
  
the fall of our first parents Hi eat-  
ing an apple; the coming of @hrist  
to repair the mischief; his mira-  
cles, and suffering, &amp;¢c.—When  
he had finished, an Indian orator  
stood up to thank him. What  
you have told us,” says he, is  
ail very good. It is indeed bad  
to eat apples. It is better to make  
them ail into cyder. We are  
much obliged oy your kindness,.  
in coming so far to fell us those  
  
things which you have heard from.

“ In the beginning, our fathers  
had only the flesh of animals to  
subsist on; and if their hunting  
was unsuccesiul, they were starv-  
ing. Two of our young hunters  
having killed a deer, made a fire  
in che woods to broil some parts  
of it. When they were about to  
satisfy hunger, they beheld a beau-  
tiful young woman descend from  
the clouds, and seat herself on that  
hill which you see yonder among  
the Blue Mountains. They said  
to each other, It isa spirit, that  
perhaps has smelt our broiling  
venison, and wishes to eat of it:  
let us offer some toher. They  
presented her with the tongue:  
she was pleased with the taste of it,  
and said, Your kindness shall be  
rewarded. Come to this place  
after thirteen moons, and you  
will find something that will be of  
great benefit in nourishing you  
and your children to the latest  
generations. They did so, and,  
to their surprize, found plants  
they had never seen before; but  
which, from that ancient time,  
have been constantly cultivated  
among us, to our great advantage.  
Where her right hand had touch-  
ed the ground they found maize;  
where her left hand had touched  
it, they found kidney-beans; and  
on the place where she had sat,  
they found tobacco.” The good  
missionary, disgusted with this  
idle tale, said, “ What I deliver-  
ed to you were sacred truths; but  
what you tell me is mere fable,  
fi€tion, and falshood.” The In-  
dian, offended, replied, “ My bro-  
ther, it seems your friends have  
not done you justice in your edu-  
cation; they have not well in-  
structed you in the rules of com-  
mon civility. You saw that we,  
who understand and practise those  
rules, believed all your stories;  
why do you refuse to believe  
ours?”  
  
Vhen any of them come into  
our towns, our people are apt to  
crowd round them, gaze upon  
them, and incommode them where  
they desire to be private; this the  
esteem great rudeness, and the ef-  
fect of the want of instruétion in  
the rules of civility and good man-  
ners» ‘“ We have,” say they,  
‘as much curiosity as you, and  
when you come into our towns,  
we wish for opportunities of  
looking at you; but for this pur-  
pose we hide ourselves behind  
bushes where you are to pass, and  
never intrude ourselves into your  
company.”  
  
Their manner of entering one  
another’s villages, has likewise  
its rules. It is reckoned uncivil  
in travelling strangers to enter a  
village abruptly, without giving  
notice of their approach. There-  
fore, as soon as they arrive with-  
in hearing, they stop and halloo,  
remaining there till invited to en-  
ter. Two old men usually come  
out to them, aad lead them in.  
There is in every village a vacant  
dwelling, called the strangers house.  
Here tiey are placed, while the  
old men go round from hut to hut,  
acquainting the inhabitants that  
strangers are arrived, who are  
probably hungry and weary; and  
every one sends them what he can  
spare of victuals, and skins to re-  
pose on. When the strangers are  
refreshed, pipes and tobacco are  
brought; and then, but not before,  
conversation begins, with inqui-  
ries who they are, whither bound,  
what news, é&amp;c. and it usually ends  
with offers of service, if the stran-  
gers have oc¢asion for guides, or  
any necessaries for continuing  
their journey; and nothing is ex-  
acted jor the entertainment.  
  
The same hospitality, esteemed  
among them as a principal virtue,  
is practised by private persons: Of

which Conrad Weiser, our inter-  
preter, gave me the following in-  
stance. He had been naturalized  
among the Six Nations, and spoke  
well the Mohawk language. In  
going through the Indian country,  
to carry a message from our go-  
vernor to the council at Onnon-  
daga, le called at the habitation  
of Canassetego, an old acquaint-  
ance, who embraced him, spread  
furs for him to sit on, placed be-  
fore him some boiied beans and  
venison, and mixed some rum  
and water for bis drink. When  
he was well refreshed, and had  
lit his pipe, Canassetego began  
to converse with him; asked how  
the had fared the many years since  
they had seen each other, whence  
he then came, what had occasion-  
ed the journey, &amp;c. Conrad an-  
swered all his questions; and when  
the discourse began to flag, the  
Indian, to continue it, said, “*Con-  
rad, you have lived long among  
the white people, and know some-  
thing of their customs: I have  
been sometimes at Albany, and  
have observed, that once in seven  
days they shut up their shops, and  
assemble all in the great house:  
tell me what it is for ?—-What do  
they do there?” “ They meet  
there,” says Conrad, “ to hear and  
learn good things.” “ I do not  
  
. doubt,” says the Indian, * that  
  
they tell you so; they have told  
me the same: but | doubt the  
truth of what they say, and I will  
tell you my reasons. J went late-  
ly to Albany to sell my skins, and  
buy blankets, knives, powder,  
rum, &amp;¢c. You know I general-  
ly used to deal with Hans Han-  
son; but I was a little inclined  
this time to try some other mer-  
chants. However, I called first  
upon Hans, and asked him what  
he would give for beaver. He  
said he could not give more than  
  
four shillings a pound;:. but, says  
he, I cannot talk on business now;  
this is the day when we meet to-  
gether to learn good thiugs, and I  
am going to the meeting. SoI  
thought to myself, since I cannot  
do any business to-day, I may as  
well go to the meeting too; and J  
went with him.—There stood up  
a man in black, and began to talk  
to the people very angrily. I did  
not understand what he said; but  
perceiving that he looked much  
at me and at Hanson, I ima-  
gined he was angry at seeing me  
there; so I went out, sat 5 atin  
near the house, struck fire, and  
lit my pipe, waiting till the meet-  
ing should break up. I thought  
too, that the man had mentioned  
something of beaver, and I sus-  
pected it might be the subject of  
their meeting. So, when they  
came out, J accosted my merchant.  
—“ Well, Hans,” says I, “I hope  
you have agreed to give more than  
four shillings a pound?” No,”  
says he, *¢ 1 cannot give so muchs  
I cannot give more than threeshil-  
lings and six-pence.”” I then spoke  
to several other dealers; but they  
ali sung the same song, sree and  
six-pence, three aad six-fence.. This  
made it clear to me that my sus-  
picion was right; and that what-  
ever they pretended of meeting to  
learn good things, the real purpose  
was, to consult how to cheat In-  
dians in the price of beaver. Con-  
sider but a little, Conrad, and  
you must be of my opinion. If  
they mect so often to learn , goad  
things, they certainly would have  
learned some before. this time.  
But they are still ignorant, You  
know our practice. If a white  
man, in travelling through our  
country, enters one of our cabins,  
we all treat him as I treat you;  
we dry him if he is wet, we warm  
him if he is cold, and give him  
  
meat

TIONS OF NortH-AmERICA : SAID TO HAVE BERN  
WRITTEN BY THE LATE DOCTOR FRANKLIN.  
  
THE politenefs of thefe favages in converfation is, indeed,  
earried to excefs, fince it does not permit them to contradi@ or  
deny the truth of what is’afferted in their prefence. By thefe  
means, indeed, they avoid difputes, but then it becomes difficult  
to know their minds, or what impreflion you make upon them.  
  
The miffionaries who have attempted to convert them to  
chriftianity, all complain of this as one of the greateft difficul.  
ties of their miffion. The Indians hear the truth with patience ;  
attend carefully to the gofpel, as explained to them, and give  
the ufual cokens of affent andapprebation. yoy would think  
they were convinced :—No fuch matter: It is mere civility.  
  
A Swedihh minifter having aflembled the chiefs of the Sut  
quehannah Indians, made a fermon to them, acqrainting them  
with the principal hiftorical fa€ts on which our religion is found.  
ed; fuch as the fall of our firft parents by eating an apple ; the  
coming of Chrift to repair the mifchief, his miracles and fuf-  
ferings, &amp;c. «  
  
When he had) finifhed his difcourfe, an Indian orator ftood  
up tothank hirn—‘ What you have told us (faid he) is all very  
good—it is indeed bad to eat apples—it is better to make them

ing {fo far to tell us thofe things which you have heard from your  
mothers: in return, we wil] tell you fome of thofe we have  
heard from ours.  
  
inthe beginning, our fathers had only the fleth of animals to  
fubfift on; and if their hunting was anfuccefsful, they were  
farving. Two of our young hunters having killed a deer  
made a fire in the woods to broil fome parts of it. When they  
were about to fatisfy their hunger, they beheld a beautiful yeun

to each other, it is a fpirit, that has perhaps {melt our broiling

Docrorn FRANKLIN relates a story of a Swedish  
Missionary, who, when in America, assembled the  
chiefs of the Susquehannah Indians, and recited to  
them a sermon; in which he informed them of the  
principal historical facts on which our religion is  
founded ; such as the fall of our first parents by eat-  
ing an ap the coming of Christ to repair the mis-  
chief; his miracles, sufferings, &amp;c. When he had  
finished, an Indian orator stood up to thank him.—  
“What you have told us,” said he, “‘is all very good,  
it is indeed bad to ent apples, it would be better to  
make them all into cyder. We are much obliged by  
your kindness in coming so far to tell us those things  
which you have heard from your mothers; in return,  
1 will tell you some of those we have héard from ours.”  
  
“*In the beginning, our fathers had only the flesh of  
animals to subsist on; and if their hunting was un-  
successful, they were starving. Two of our young  
warriors having killed a deer, made a fire in the  
woods to broil some parts of it. When they were  
about to satisfy their hunger, they beheld a beautiful  
woman descended from the clouds, and sat herself on  
that hill which you see yonder among the blue moun-  
tains. They said to each other, it is a spirit, that  
perhaps has smelt our broiled vension, and wishes to  
eat of it; let us offer sometoher.” They presented  
her with the tongue: she was pleased with the taste  
of it, and said, **Your kindness shall be rewarded ;  
come to this place after thirteen moons, and you shall  
find something that will be of great benefit in nour-  
ishing you and your children in the latest generations.’  
They did #0, and to their surprise found plants they  
had never seen before, but which from that ancient  
time have been constantly cultivated among us to  
our greet advontage. Where her right hend touch-  
ed the ground, they found maize ; where ber left hand  
bad touched it, they found kiduey-beans ; and where  
  
her feet bad trodden, they found tobucco. The

Savaces we call them, because their man-  
ners differs from ours, which we think the per-  
fection of civility. They think the same of  
  
OUTS. fie gaat  
‘Perhaps, if we could examine the different  
  
  
  
  
without any rules of politeness, nor any so po-  
jite as  
  
  
  
not to have some remains of rudeness.  
The Indian men, when young, are hunters  
ws; when old, counsellors; for all  
mment is by counsel of the sages.  
| ‘force, there are no prisons, no  
officers to compel obedience, or inflict punish-  
ment. Hence they generally study oratory,  
the best speaker having the most influence.  
  
Indian women till the ground, dréss the  
food, nurse and bring up the children, and  
preserve and hand down to posterity the me-  
mory of public transactions. These employ-  
  
  
  
  
  
ments of men and women are accounted natu-  
ral and honourable. Having few artificial  
wants, they have abundance of leisure for im-  
provement by conversation. Our laborious  
manner of life, compared with theirs, they  
deem slavish and base; and the learning on  
which we value ourselves, they regard as fri-  
volous and useless. An instance of this oc-  
curred at the treaty of Lancaster in Pennsyl-  
vania, anno 1744, between the government of  
Virginia and the Six Nations. After the prin-  
cipal business was settled, the commissioners  
from Virginia acquainted the Indians by a  
speech, that there was at Williamsburg a col-  
lege, with a fund for educating Indian youth ;  
and that if the Six Nations would send down  
half a dozen of their young lads fo that col-  
lege, the government would take care that  
they should be well provided for, and in-  
structed in all the learning of the white peo-  
ple. Itis one of the Indian rules of polite-  
ness, not to answer a public proposition the  
same day that it is made; they think that it  
would be treating it as a light matter, and  
that they show it respect by taking time to  
consider it, as of a matter that is important.  
They therefore deferred their answer till the  
day following; when their speaker began by  
expressing their deep sense of the kindness of  
the Virginia government in making them that  
offer; “for we know,” says he, “ that you  
highly esteem the kind of learning taught in  
those colleges, and that the maintenance of  
our young men while with you would be very  
expensive to you. We are convinced, there-  
fore, that you mean to do us good by your  
proposal, and we thank you heartily. But  
you, who are wise, must know that different  
nations have different conceptions of things ;  
and you will therefore not take it amiss if our  
ideas of this kind of education happen not to  
be the same with yours.  
experience of it: several of our young people  
  
were formerly brought up at the colleges of  
  
the northern provinces ; they were instructed  
in all your sciences; but when they came  
back to us they were bad rumners ;  
  
We have had some || y  
  
of every means of living in the woods ; unable  
to bear either cold or hunger; knew neither  
how to build a cabin, take.a deer, or kill an  
enemy ; spoke our language imperfectly, and  
were therefore neither fit for hunters, warri-  
.ors, nor councillors ;_ they were, in short, good  
for nothing. We are, however, not the less  
obliged by your kind offer, though we decline®.  
accepting it; and,.to show our grateful sense”  
of it, if the gentlemen of Virginia will send us  
a dozen of their sons, we will Pe care  
of their education, instruct them in all we  
know, and make men of them.” —  
Having frequent occasions (0  
councils, they have acquired @  
decency in conducting them. The old men.  
sit in the foremost ranks, the’ iors in the.  
next, and the women and citren inte hind-  
most. The business of the women&#x27;is to take  
exact notice of what passes, imprint it in their  
memories (for they have no writing) and com-  
municate it to their children. They aré*the  
records of the council, and they preserve tra-  
ditions of the stipulations in treaties one hun-  
dred years back, which, when we compare  
them with our writings, we always find exact.  
He that would speak riges. ‘ The rest observe  
a profound silence. When he. has finished  
and sits down, they leave him five or six mi-  
nutes to recoliect; that if he has omitted any  
thing he intended to say, or has any thing to  
add, he may rise again and deliver it, Toin-  
terrupt another even in Common.conversation, .

this is from the conduct. of a polite British ~

the truth of what is asserted in their presence.  
By this means indeed they avoid dispute ;  
but then it becomes difficult to know “their  
minds, or what impression you make upon  
them. The missionaries who have attempt-  
ed to convert them to christianity, all com-  
plain of this as one of the great difficulties of  
their «mission. The Indians hear with pa-  
tience&#x27;the truths of the gospel explained to  
them, and give their usual. tokens of assent  
and approbation ; ‘you would think that they  
were convinced. No such matter. It is mere  
civility. A Swedish divine, having assembled  
the chiefsofthe Susquehannab Indians, preach-  
ed a sermon to them, acquainting them with  
the principal historical facts on which our re-  
ligionisfounded; suchas the fallof our first pa-  
rents by cating anapple ; the coming of Christ  
to repair the mischief ; his miracles and suf-  
ietings, &amp;c. When he had finished, an In-  
dian orator stood up to thank him. ‘ What  
rou have told us,”’ says he, “ isall very good.  
t is indeed bad to eat apples.  
make them all into cider. We are much ob-  
liged by your kindness in coming so far to tell  
us those things which you have heared from  
our mothers ; in return, I will tell you some  
of those which we have heard from ours. Jn  
the beginning, our fathersehad only the flesh  
oftanimals to subsist on, and if their hunting  
was unsuceessfulthey were starving. ‘Two of  
our young hunters, having killeda deer, madea  
fire in the woods to broil some part of it.—  
When they were about to satisfy their hunger,  
they beheld a beautiful young woman descend  
from the clouds’and seat herself on the hill  
which you see yonder among the blue moun-  
tains. {Phy said»to each other it isa spirit  
that, perlaaps, has smelt our broiling venison,  
and wishes to eat of it: let us offer some to  
her. They presented her with the tongue ;  
she was pleased with the taste of it, and said  
Your kindness shall be rewarded: come to  
this place after thirfeen moons, and you shall  
find something that will be of great benefit in  
nourishing you and your children to the latest  
generations. ‘They did so, and to their sur-  
orise found plants that they had never seen  
balote; but which from that ancient time have  
been constantly cultivated among us to our  
great advantage. Where her right hand had  
touched the ground they found maize; where  
her left hand had touched it they found kid-  
-ney-beans : and where her backside had sat  
on it they found tobacco.” The good mission-  
ary, disgusted with this idle tale, said, What I  
ackiversd to you, were sacred truths; but  
what you tell me, is mere fable, fiction, and  
falsehood. [he Indian, offended, replied :  
My ery it seems your friends have not  
  
done yqu justice in td yo education ; they  
i!  
  
  
  
have not well instru u. in the rules of  
common civility. Yo that we, who un-  
derstand and practise those rules, believed all  
your stories: why do you refuse to believe  
ours ? ae  
  
- When any of them come into our towns,  
  
,  
  
It is better to |  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
our people are apt to crowd round them,  
gaze upon them, and incommode them where  
they desire to be private; this they esteem  
great rudeness, and the effect of want of in-  
struction in the rules of civility and good man-  
ners. We have, say they, as much curiosity  
as you; and when you come into our towns,  
we wish for opportunities of looking at you;  
but, for this purpose, we hide ourselves be-  
  
| hind bushes where you are to pass, and never  
  
intrude ourselves into your company.  
  
Their manner of entering one another’s  
villages has likewise its rules. It is reckoned  
uncivil in travelling strangers to enter a vil-  
  
| lage abruptly, without giving notice of their  
  
approach ; therefore, as soon as they arrive  
within hearing, they stop and halloo, remain-  
ing there till invited to enter. Two old men  
usually come out to them and lead them in.  
There is in every village a vacant dwelling,  
called the stranger’s house. Here they are  
placed, while the old men go round from hut  
to hut, acquainting the inhabitants that stran-  
gers are arrived, who are probably hungry  
and weary; and every one sends them what  
he can spare of victuals, and skins to repose  
on. When the strangers ure refreshed, pipes  
and tobacco are brought; and then, but not  
before, conversation begins, with inquiries  
who they are, whither bound, what news, &amp;c.  
  
‘and it usually ends with offers of service, if  
  
the strangers have occasion for guides or any  
necessaries for continuing their journey ; and  
nothing is exacted for the entertainment.  
The same hospitality, esteemed among them  
as.a principal virtue, is practised by private  
persons ; of which Conrad Weiser, our inter-  
preter, gave me the following instance. He  
had been naturalized among the Six Nations,  
and spoke the Mohock language well. In go-  
ing through the Indian country to carry a mes-  
sage from our governor to the council at On-  
ondaga, he called at the habitation of Coness-  
dego, an old acquaintaince, who embraced  
him, spread furs for him to sit on, placed be-  
fore him some boiled beans and venison, and  
mixed some rum and water for his drink.—  
When he was well refreshed, and had lit his  
pipe, Conessdego began toconverse with him,  
asked how he had fared the many years since  
they had seen each other, whence he then  
came, whatoccasioned the journey, &amp;c. &amp;c.—  
Conrad answered all his questions, and when  
the discourse began to flag, the Indian, to con-  
tinue it, said: “ Conrad, you have lived long  
among the white people, and know something  
of their customs. I have been sometimes at  
Albany, and have observed that once in seven  
days they shut up their shops, and assemble  
all in the great house; tell me what is it for?  
What do they do there ?””. ‘ They meet there,”  
says Conrad, ‘ to hear and learn good things.’  
“1 do not doubt,” says the Indian, “ that they  
tell you so: they have told me the same: but  
I doubt the truth of what they say; and I will  
tell you my reasons.- I went lately to Albany  
to sell my skins, and buy blankets, knives,  
  
  
  
| powder, rum, &amp;c. You know I used gene: oo  
|rally to deal with Hans Hanson; but | Wasa 9a)  
little inclined this time to try some other men  
chant ; however, [ called first upon Hans, ang  
asked him what he would give for beayey  
He said, he could not give more than four  
shillings a pound ; ‘“ but,” says he, “I cannot  
talk on business now ; this is. the day whep  
we meet together to learn good things; and] }  
am going to the meeting.” So I thought to  
myself, since we cannot do any business 4  
day, I may as well go to the meeting too) anq_  
I went with him. _ There stood up a man jy  
black, and began to talk to the people very  
angrily. I did not understand what he said;  
but, perceiving that he looked much at me  
and at Hanson,.I imagined he was angry at  
seeing me there ; so I went out, sat down nea  
the house, struck fire, and lit my pipe; wait:  
ing till the meeting should break’ up. J  
thought too, that -the man had mentioned —  
something of beaver; and I suspected it mi  
  
be the subject of their meeting. So, whep  
they came out, I accosted my merchant,  
“Well, Hans,” says I, “I hope you have  
agreed to give more than four shillings a  
pound.” “No,” says he, “I cannot give s  
much: | cannot give more than three shik  
lings and sixpence.” I then spoke to several  
other dealers; but they all ‘sung the same  
song, three and six-pence, three and six  
pence. This made it clear to me, that my

anterior to the American revolution,  
is copied from doctor Franklin’s Es-  
says. The contrast between the hos-  
pitality of the original natives of this  
country, and its present * civilized in-  
habitants,” is strikingly portrayed by  
the “ Savage” Canassetego, both in  
his treatment to Weiser, and his rela-  
tion of his journey to Albany.  
  
Conrap Weiser had been natural-  
ized among the Six Nations, and spoke  
well the Mohuck language. In going  
through the Indian country, to carry  
a message from the governor to th  
council at Onondaga, he called at  
the habitation of Canassetego, an olc  
acquaintance, who embraced hin  
spread furs for him to sit on, place:  
before him some boiled beans and ve-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ths  
nison, and mixed some rum and wa-  
ter for hisdrink. When he was well  
refreshed, and had lit his pipe, Canas-  
setego began to converse with him :  
asked him how he hae fared the many  
years since they had seen each other,  
  
| whence he then came, what occasion-  
  
ed the journey, &amp;c. Conrad answer-  
ed all his questions; aud when the  
discourse began to flag, the Indian,  
to continue it, said, “ Conrad, you  
have lived long among the white peo-  
ple, and know something of their cus-  
toms: I have been sometimes. at Al-  
hany, and have observed, that once  
in seven days they shut up their shops,  
and assemble all in the great house ;  
tell me what it is for? What do  
they dothere 7” They meet there,”  
says Conrad, “ to hear and learn good  
things,” “Ido not doubt,” says the  
Indian, * that they tell you so, they  
have told me the same: but J doubt  
the truth of what they say, and I will  
tell you my reasons. I went lately to  
Albany to sell my skins and buy  
blankets, knives, powder, rum, &amp;c.  
You know I used generally to deal  
with Hans Hanson; but 1 was a little  
inclined this time to try some other  
merchants. However, I called first  
upon Hans, and asked him what he  
would give for beaver. He said he  
could not give more than four shil-  
lines a pound : but, says he, | cannot  
talk on business now ; this is the day  
when we meet together to learn good  
things, and I am going tothe ineeting.  
So I thought to myself, since I cannot  
do any business to day, I may as well  
vo to the meeting too, and I went  
with him. There stood up a man in  
black, and began to talk to the people  
very angrily. 1 did not understand  
what he said: but perceiving that he

imagined he was angry at seeing me

that strangers are arrived, who are  
probably hungry and weary; and

to Doctor Franklin. He had been  
naturalized among the Six Na-  
tions, and spoke well the Mohoc  
language. In going through the  
Indian country, to carry a message  
from the British Governor to the  
Council of Onondaga, he called at  
the habitation of Canassetego, an  
old acquaintance, who embraced  
him, spread furs for him to sit  
upon, placed before him some  
boiled beans and venison, and  
mixed some rum and water for  
his drink. When he was well re-  
freshed and lit his pipe, Canasse-  
tego began to converse with him,  
asked him how he had fared these  
many years since they had seen  
each other, whencé he then came,  
what had occasioned the journey,  
&amp;e. Conrad answered ali his  
questions ; and when the discourse  
began to flag, the Indian, to conti-  
nue it, said, “Conrad, you have

An Indian, by the name of Canasselego, once said toa cele-

what they say, and I will tell you my reasons. I went to Al-

asked hin what he would give for beaver. He said he could  
not give more than 4s. a pound; but (says he) J cannot do  
business now ; for this is the day we mcet to learn good things.  
Sol went with him. Well, there stood up a man in black,  
who began to talk very angrily at the people. I did not under-  
stand what he said; butas he looked at ne and Hans most,

sat down near the House, struck fire, lit my pipe, and enjoyed  
myself as well as I could, till the meeting broke up. As I was

Williamsburgh with a fund appropriated for the. education of the  
Indian youth; and that if the red chiefs would send some of their  
children to that place, they should be well provided for, and in-

“ The learning on which Ave value ourselves, tliey  
regard as frivolous and useless. , An instance of  
this occured at the treaty of Lancaster, in Pennsyl¬  
vania, anno. 1745, between the government of Vir.  
ginia and the Six Nations. After the principal bu¬  
siness was settled, the commissioners from V&#x27;irginia,  
acquainted the Indians by a speech, that there Avas!  
at Williamsburg, a college, with a fund, for educa¬  
ting Indian youth : and that if the chiefs of the Six {; friends to his Avedding, and a ball which he gave in  
Nations Avould send dow’n half a dozen of their sons ! honor of the event. The company assembled, the  
to that college, the government would take care that i magistrate and fiddlers were present, as Avell as the  
they should be Avell provided for and instructed in , bride and bridegroom. The bride being solicited  
all the learning of the white people. It is one of jlto receive the ring, she peremptorily refused, obser-  
the Indian rules of politeness, not to answer a pub-j  
lie proposition the same day that it is made : they  
think it would be treating it as a light matter, and  
that they shoAv it respect by taking time to consider  
it, as of a matter important. They therefore de¬  
ferred their ansAver till the day following ; Avhen  
their speaker began by expressing their deep sense  
of the kindness of the Virginia government, in ma¬  
king them that offer : “ for vve knoAv,” says he,  
  
“ that you highly esteem the kind of learning taught  
in those colleges, and that the maintainance of our  
young men, while with you, AAOuld be very expen¬

mean to do us good by your proposal ; and we  
thank you heartily. But you, who are Avlse, must

amiss, if our ideas of this kind cf education happens  
not to be the same Avith yours. We have had some  
experience of it : scA eral of our young ])eople w ere

provinces ; they Avere instructed in all your scien¬

bad runners, ignorant of cAery means of living in

therefore neither fit for hunters, warriors or coun¬  
sellors ; they were totally good for nothing. We  
are hoAvever, not the less obliged by your kind offer  
though Ave decline accepting it, and to shoAv our  
grateful sense of it, if the gentlemen of Virginia  
will ■^rnd us a dozen of their sons, Ave will take care

REMARKS CONCERNING THE SAVAGES  
OF NORTH AMERICA.  
  
SAvaGEs we call them, because their manners differ from  
ours, which we think the perfection of civility ; they think the  
same of theirs,  
  
Perhaps if we could examine the manners of different na-  
tions with impartiality, we should find no people so rude as  
to be without any rules of politeness ; nor any so polite as not  
to have some remains of rudeness.  
  
The Indian men, when young, are hunters and warriors ;  
when old, counsellors ; for all their government is by the coun-  
sel or advice of the sages: there is no force, there are no  
prisons, no officers, to compel obedience, or inflict punish-  
ment. Hence they generally study oratory : the best speaker  
having the most influence. The Indian women till the ground,  
dress the food, nurse and bring up the children, and preserve  
and hand down to posterity the memory of public transac-  
tions. These employments of men and women are accounted  
natural and honorable. Having few artificial wants, they  
have abundance of leisure for improvement in conversa-  
tion. Our laborious manner of life, compared with theirs, they  
esteem slavish and base; and the learning on which we va-  
lue ourselves, they regard as frivolous and useless, An in-  
stance of this occurred at the treaty of Lancaster, in Penn-  
sylvania, anno 1744, between the government of Virginia and  
  
e Six Nations. After the principal business was settled,  
the commissioners from big = acquainted the Indians by  
a speech, that there was at Williamsburgh a college, with a  
fund for educating Indian youth ; and if the chiefs of the Six  
Nations would send down half a dozen of their sons to that  
college, the government would take care that they should be  
well provided for, and instructed in allthe learning of the  
white people. It is one of the Indian rules of politeness not  
to answer a public proposition the same day that it is made ;  
they think it would be treating it as a light matter, and that  
  
they show it respect by taking time to consider it, as of a |  
matier important, ‘They therefore deferred their answer till |  
the day following: when their speaker began, by expressing  
their deep sense of the kindness of the Virginia government |  
in making them that offer ; ‘ for we know,’ says he, ‘ that you  
highly esteem the kind of learning taught in those colleges, and  
that the maintenance of our young men, while with you, would  
be very expensive to you. We are convinced, therefore, that  
you mean to do us good by your proposal ; and we thank you  
heartily, + se who are wise, must know, that different na-  
tions have different conceptions of things: and you will there-  
fore not take it amiss, if our ideas of this kind of education hap-  
pen not to be the same with yours, We have had some ex-  
rience of it; several of our young people were formerly  
rought up at the colleges of the northern provinces; they  
were instructed in all your sciences ; but when they came  
back to us, they were bad runners : ignorant of every means  
of living in the woods ; unable to bear either cold or hunger;  
knew neither how to build a cabin, take a deer, or kill an ene~  
my ; spoke our language imperfectly ; were therefore neither  
fit for hunters, warriors, or counsellors; they were totally  
good for nothing. We are however not the less obliged by  
your kind offer, though we decline accepting of it; and to show  
our grateful sense of it, if the gentlemen of Virginia will send  
us a dozen of their sons, we will take great care of their edu-  
cation, instruct them in all we know, and make men of  
them.’  
  
Having frequent occasions to hold public councils, they  
have acquired great order and decency in conducting them.  
The old men sit in the foremost ranks, the warriors in the  
next, and the women and children hindmost. The business  
of the women is to take exact notice of what passes, imprint  
it in their memories, for they have no writing, and commu-  
nicate it to the children, They are the records of the coun-  
cil, and they preserve tradition of the stipulations in treaties  
a hundred years back; which, when we compare with our  
writings, we always find exact. He that would speak, rises.  
The rest observe a profound silence. When he has finish-  
ed, and sits down, they leave him five or six minutes to re-  
collect, that, if he bas omitted any thing he intended to say,  
or has any thing to add, he may rise again and deliver it,  
To interrupt another, even in common conversation, is reck-  
oned highly indecent. How different this is from the con-  
duct of a polite British House of Commons, where scarce a  
day passes without some confusion, that makes the speaker  
hoarse in calling to order ; and how different from the mode  
of conversation, in many polite companies of Europe, where,  
if you do not deliver your sentences with great rapidity, you  
are cut off in the middle of it by the impatient loquacity of  
those you converse with, and never suffered to finish it!  
  
The politeness of these savages in conversation is indeed  
carried to excess; since it does not permit them to contra-  
dict or deny the truth of what is asserted in their presence,  
By this means they, indeed, avoid disputes ; but then it be-  
comes difficult to know their minds, or what impression you  
make upon them. The missionaries, who have attempted  
to convert them to Christianity, all complain of this as one  
of the great difficulties of their mission. The Indians hear  
with patience the truths of the gospel explained to them, and  
give their usual tokens of assent and approbation: you would  
think they were convinced, No such matter—it is mere  
civility.  
  
A Swedish mmister having assembled the chiefs of the  
Susquehannah Indians, made a sermon to them, acquaint-  
ing them with the principal historical facts on which our re-  
ligion is founded: such as the fall of our first parents by eat-  
ing an apple; the coming of Christ to repair the mischief ;  
his miracles and sufferings, &amp;c.—When he had finished, an  
Indian orator stood up to thank him. ‘ What you have told  
us,’ says he, ‘is all very good. It is indeed bad to eat ap-  
ples. It is better to make them all into cider. We are  
much obliged by your kindness in coming so far to tell us  
those things which you have heard from your mothers. In  
return, I will tell you some of those which we have heard  
from ours.  
  
‘In the beginning, our fathers had only tne flesh of ani-  
mals to subsist on; and if their hunting was unsuccessful,  
  
they were starving. Two of our young hunters having kill-  
ed a deer, made a fire in the woods to broil some parts of it.  
When they were about to satisfy their hunger, they beheld  
a beautiful young woman descend from the clouds, and seat

herself on that hill which you see yonder among the blue  
mountains. They said to each other, it is a spirit that per-  
haps has smelt our broiled venison, and wishes to eat of it;  
let us offer some to her. They presented her with the  
tongue: she was pleased with the taste of it, and said,  
“ Your kindness shall be rewarded. Come to this place  
after thirteen moons, and you shall find something that will  
be of great benefit in nourishing you and your children to  
the latest generations.” They did so, and to their surprise,  
found plants they had never seen before ; but which, from  
that ancient time, have been constantly cultivated among us,  
to our great advantage. Where her right hand had touched  
the ground, they found maize; where her left hand had  
touched it, they found kidney beans; and where her back-  
side had sat on it, they found tobacco.’ The good mission-  
ary, disgusted with this idle tale, said, ‘ What I delivered  
to you were sacred truths; but what you tell me is mere fa-  
ble, fiction, and falsehood.’ The Indian, offended, replied,  
‘ My brother, it seems your friends have not done you jus-  
tice in your education ; they have not well instructed you in  
the rules of common civility. You saw that we, who un-  
derstand and practise those rules, believed all your stories,

them where they desire to be private: this they esteem  
  
great rudeness, and the effect of the want of instruction in  
the rules of civility and good manners. ‘* We have,’ said  
they, ‘as much curiosity as you, and when you come into  
our towns, we wish for opportunities of looking at you; but  
for this purpose we hide ourselves behind bushes, where you  
are to pass, and never intrude ourselves into your com-  
  
heir manner of entering one another’s villages has like-  
wise its rules. It is reckoned uncivil in travelling strangers  
to enter a village aoruptly, without giving notice of their ap-  
proach. Therefore, as soon as they arrive within hearing,  
they I and halloo, remaining there till invited to enter.  
Two old men usuaily come out to them and lead them in.  
There is in every village a vacant dwelling, called the  
stranger’s house. Here they are placed, while the old men  
go round from hut to hut, acquainting the inhabitants that  
strangers are arrived, who are probably hungry and weary,  
and every one sends them what S can spare of victuals, and  
skins to repose on. When the strangers are refreshed, pipes  
and tobacco are brought: and then, but not before, conver-  
sation begins, with inquiries who they are, whither bound,  
what news, &amp;c. and it usually ends with offers of service ;  
if the strangers have occasion for guides, or any necessaries  
for continuing their journey ; and nothing is exacted for the  
entertainment,  
The same hospitality, esteemed among them as a princi-  
= virtue, is practised by private persons ; of which Conrad  
eiser, our interpreter, gave me the following instance.  
He had been naturalized among the Six Nations, and spoke  
well the Mohuck language. In going through the Indian  
country, to carry a message from our governor to the coun-  
cil at Onondaga, he called at the habitation of Canassetego,  
an old acquaintance, who embraced him, spread furs for him  
to sit on, placed before him some boiled beans and venison,  
and mixed some rum and water for bis drink. When he  
was well refreshed, and had lit his pipe, Canassetego began  
to converse with him: asked him how he had fared the  
many years since they had seen each other, whence he  
then came, what occasioned the journey, &amp;c. Conrad an-  
swered all his questions ; and when the discourse began to  
flag, the Indian, to continue it, said, ‘Conrad, you have  
lived long among the white people, and know something of  
their customs; I have been sometimes at Albany, and have  
observed, that once in seven days they shut up their shops,  
and assemble all in the great house; tell me what it is for?  
What do they do there?” ‘They meet there,’ says Con-  
rad, ‘to hear and learn good tings.’ ‘1 do not doubt,’  
says the Indian, ‘that they tell you so, they have told me  
the same: but I doubt the truth of what they say, and I will  
tell you my reasons. I went lately to Albany, to sell my  
skins, and buy blankets, knives, powder, rum, &amp;c. You  
know I used generally to deal with Hans Hanson; but I  
was a little inclined this time to try some other merchants.  
However, I called first upon Hans, and asked him what he  
would give for beaver. He said he could not give more  
than four shillings a pound: but, says he, I cannot talk on  
business now; this is the day when we meet together to  
learn good things, and I am going to the meeting. Sol  
thought to myself, since I cannot do any business to-day, I  
may as well go to the meeting too, I went with him.  
There stood up a man in black, and began to talk to the  
people very angrily. I did not understand what he said :  
ut, perceiving that he looked much at me, and at Hanson,  
I imagined he was angry at seeing me there; so I went out,  
sat down near the house, struck fire, and lit my pipe, wait-  
ing till the meeting should break up. I thought too, that  
the man had mentioned something of beaver ; I suspected it  
might be the subject of their meeting. So when they came  
out, I accosted my merchant, “ Well, Hans,” says I, “I  
hope you have agreed to give more than four shillings a  
pound.” “No,” says he, “I cannot give so much; I can-  
not give more than three shillings and sixpence.” I then  
spoke to several other dealers, but they all sung the same  
song, three and sixpence, three and sixpence. This made  
it clear to me that my suspicion was right; and that, what-  
ever they pretended of meeting to learn good things, the real  
urpose was to consult how to cheat Indians in the price of  
Conv. Consider but a little, Conrad, and you must be of  
my opinion. If they met so often to learn good things, they  
would certainly have learned some before this time. But  
they are still ignorant. You know our practice. If a white  
man, in travelling through our country, enters one of our  
cabins, we all treat him as I do you; we dry him if he is  
wet, we warm him if he is cold, and give him meat and drink,  
that he may allay his thirst and hunger; and we spread soft  
furs for him to rest and sleep on: we demand nothing in re-  
turn.* But if I go into a white man’s house at Albany, and  
ask for victuals and drink, they say, Where is your money?  
and if I have none, they say, Get out, you Indian dog,  
You see that they have not learned those little good things  
that we need no meetings to be instructed in, because our  
mothers taught them us when we were children ; and there-  
fore it is impossible their meetings should be, as they say,  
for any such purpose, or have any such effect; they are  
only to contrive the cheating of Indians in the price of bea-  
ver.

them belong to the history of our country, in the darkest as well as  
the most splendid periods of the revolutionary war. To witness this  
  
tacle, a large body of Indians was collected, from the most pow-  
erful tribes then occupying the almost entire West. They had assem-  
bled for the purpose of making a treaty. Whether any of them en-

ANECDOTE.  
  
A SwepisH minister, says Franklin, having assembled the chiefs of the  
Susquehanna Indians, preached a sermon to them, acquainting them with the  
principal historical facts on which our religion is founded; such as the fall  
of our first parents by eating of an apple, the coming of Christ to repair the  
mischief, his miracles, sufferings, &amp;e. When he had finished, an Indian  
orator stood up to thank him, and said, “* What you have told us is all very  
good. It is indeed bad to eat apples. Better make them all into cider. We  
are much obliged by your kindness in coming so far to tell us those things  
which you have heard from your mothers.”

country ; and in thisrespect the more civilized and polished  
people of our times might learn something from even the wan-  
dering Arab, or the “ wild, untutored Jodian.” Thus Dr. Frank-  
lin, (Works Vol. II, 455,) speakiag of the “savages of North  
America,” says, “ Having frequent occasions to hold public  
councils, they have acquired great order and decency in con-  
ducting them. The old men sit in the foremost ranks, the war-  
riors in the next, and the women and children in the hindmost.  
The business of the women is to take exact notice of what passes,  
imprint it on their memories, and communicate it to their chil-  
dren. He that would speak rises. The rest observe a profound  
silence. When he has finished and sits down, they leave him  
five or six minutes to recollect, that if he has omitted any thing  
he intended to say, or has anyjthing to add, he may rise again  
and deliver it. To interrupt another, even in common conver-  
sation, is reckoned highly indelicate. How different this is from  
the conduct of a polite British House of Commons, when scarce  
a day passes without some confusion, that makes the Speaker  
hoarse in calling to order,” etc. “It is one of the Indian rules  
of politeness, not to answer a public proposition the same day  
that it is made; they think it would be treating it as a light  
matter, and that they show it respect by taking time to consider  
it, as of a matter important.”—(Ibid. p. 454.)

In the memoirs of Benjamin Franklin, written by himself, and cou-  
tinued by his grandson and others, in an article upon the savages of  
North America, vol. 2, page 463, in return for many facts, upon which  
our Religion is founded, such as the fall of our first parents, by eating  
an apple, the mission of Christ, and the miracles he performed, a chief  
of the Susquehanna tribe is reported to have thus replied to the Swedish  
minister, before whom they were assembled.  
  
“In the beginning, our fathers had only the flesh of animals to subsist  
on, and if their hunting was unsuccessful, they were starving. ‘Two of our  
young hunters having killed a deer, made a fire in the woods to broil some  
part of it, when they were about to satisfy their hunger, they beheld a  
beautiful young woman descend from the clouds, and seat herself on that  
hill which you see yonder among the Blue Mountains. They said to  
each other, it is a spirit that perhaps has smelt our broiling venison, and  
wishes to eat of it: let us offer some to her. They presented her with  
the tongue: she was pleased with the taste of it, and said, your kindness

one day a beautiful young woman from  
the spirit-land appeared to two hunters  
and, being entertained by them with  
venison, promised that they should be  
rewarded if they would come to the  
same place after thirteen moons. They  
did so, and where her right hand had  
touched the ground found corn, where  
her left had touched it they found kid­  
ney beans, and where she had sat on it  
they found tobacco. The good mis­  
sionary, (says Franklin,) was disgusted  
with this idle tale, and said :  
“ What I delivered to you were sa­  
cred truths; but what you tell me is  
mere fable, fiction, and falsehood.”  
The Indian, offended, replied—“ My  
brother, it seems your friends have not  
done you justice in your education;  
they have not well instructed you in  
the rules of common civility. You saw  
that we, who understand and practice

why do you refuse to believe ours?”

them, because their manner of life differs fromours. Our laborious

. A Sweedish minister having assem­  
bled the! chiefs of the : Susquehannah  
Indians, made a sermon to them, ac­  
quainting them -with the principal his­  
torical facts on which our religion is  
founded ; such as the fall of our first  
parents by .eating an apple ; - the com­  
ing of Christ to repair ; the mischief;  
his miracles, and -sufferings, ; &amp;c.  
When he had finished, an Indian ora­  
tor stood up to thank him. &quot;What  
3-ou have told us,&quot; says he, &#x27;-is allveiy  
good. It is indeed bad to eat apples.  
It is betted to make them all into cider.  
We are much obliged by your kindness

only the flesh vof : animals ? to subsist  
on;. and if their hunting&#x27; was unsuc­  
cessful, they were starving. Two of  
bur j&#x27;oung hunters having killed a deer,  
made a fire in the woods to broil some  
parts of it. When they were about-to.  
satisfy . their hunger, they beheld a  
beautiful young woman descend from  
the clouds, and seat herself on that hill  
which you see yonder among the blue  
mountains.&#x27; They said to each&#x27; other,  
it is a spirit that perhaps smelt our  
broiled venison, and wishes to eat of  
it; let us offer some to her. They  
presented her with the tongue ; she was  
pleased with the taste of it, and i said,  
&#x27;your kindness shall be rewarded-  
Come to this place after thirteen moons,  
and you shall find something that will  
be of great benefit in nourishing yon  
and your children to the latest genera­  
tion.&#x27; They did so, and to their sur­  
prise, found plants they had never seen  
before ; but which,&#x27; from i that ancient  
time, have been constantly cultivated  
among us, to our great advantage­  
Where her! right hand had touched  
the ground, they found maize  
where her left hand had touched  
it, the found kidney-beans ; and where  
her backside had sat on it, they found  
tobacco.&quot; r:.The good missionary, dis­  
gusted with this idle tale, said, &quot;What

Weiser liad been naturalized  
among tlie Six Nations, and spoke  
well the Moliawk language. In  
going through the Indian coun­  
try, to carry a message from our  
Governor to the council at Onon­  
daga, he called at the habitation  
of Canasotego, an old acquaint­  
ance, who embraced him, spread  
furs for him to sit on, and jilaced  
before him some boiled beans and  
venison.  
When lie was well refreshed,  
and had lit his pijie, Canasetogo  
began to converse with liim;  
asked liim how he liad fared the  
many years since they had seen  
each other, whence he then came,  
what occasioned the journey, &amp;c.,  
&amp;o. Conrad answered all his  
questions; and, when tlie dis­  
course began to flag, the Indian,  
to continue it, said, “Conrad, you  
  
have lived long among the white  
  
omy.  
  
people, and know something of  
tlieir customs. I have been some­  
times at Albanjq and have ob­  
served that once in seven days  
they shut up tlielr shops, and as­  
semble. all in the great house : tell  
me, what is it for f’  
“They mbet there,” said Con­  
rad, “to hear and learn good  
things.” T do no doubt,’ said the  
Indian, ‘that tliey tell you so;  
they have told me the same; but  
I doubt tiie truth of what they  
say; I will toll you my reasons.  
I went lately to Albany to sell  
niy skins, and buy baskets,  
knives, and pon der.  
‘You know I used generally to  
deal with Hans Hanson ; but 1  
was a little inclined, this time, to  
try some other iiiercliants : liow-  
evor, I called first at Hans, and  
asked him what ho would give  
for beaver. Ho said ho would  
  
not give more than four sliillings  
  
a pound ; ‘but,’ said ho, ‘1 cannot  
talk on business now ; this is the  
day when wo meet together to  
learn good things, and I am go­  
ing to the meeting.’  
‘So I thought to myself, since  
v/e cannot do any business to-day,  
I may as well go to the meeting  
too ; and I went with him. There  
stood np a man in black, and be­  
gan to talk to the peopdo very an­  
grily. I did not understand what  
he said ; but, perceiving that he  
looked much at me and at Han­  
son, I imagined ho was angry at  
seeing me tliere : so I went out,  
sat down near the house, struck  
fire, and lit my pipe, waiting till  
tlie meeting broke up. I tliouglit,  
too, that the man had mentioned  
something of beaver, and I sus­  
pected it might be the subject of  
their meeting.  
‘So, when they came out, I ac­  
costed my merchant. ‘Well,  
Hans,’ said I, ‘I hope j&#x27;ou have  
agreed to give more than four  
shillings a pound.’ ‘No,’ said lie,  
‘I cannot give so much ; I cannot  
give more than three shillings and  
sixpence.’ I then spoke to sev­  
eral other dealers, but they all  
sung the same song—‘tliree and  
sixpence—three and sixpence.’  
This made it clear to me that my  
susjiicion was right; and that,  
whatever they pretend of meeting  
to learn good things, the real pur­  
pose is, to consult how to oh^fit  
Indians in the price of beaver.  
‘Consider but a little, Conrad,  
and you must be of my opinion^  
  
If tliey meet so often to learn  
good tilings, they would certain­  
ly have learned some before this  
tune ; blit they are still ignorant.  
You know our practice: if a white  
man in travelling tlirough our  
country, enters one of our cabins,  
we all treat liim as I treat von ;  
wo dr\&#x27; him if lie is wet, wo warm  
him it he is cold, we give liin;  
meat and drink, that he may al-.  
lay his thirst and hunger, and  
spread soft furs for iiim to rest  
and sleep on&#x27;. We demand noth­  
ing in return.  
‘But, if I go into a wliite man’s  
lionse at Albany, and ask for  
victuals- and diink, they say,  
‘Where is your money f and, if I  
have none, they saV, ‘Get out,  
you Indian dog !’ You sec they  
have not j-et learnted those little  
good things that we need no  
meeting to be instruoted in, be­  
cause bur mothers taught them to  
us when we were children ; and  
therefore it is imposSsble their  
meetings should, be, as they sav,  
for any sucli puriiose, or liavo aiiy  
such effect; they are only to coii-  
ti-ive the cheating of Indians in the  
price of beaver.

to educate some Indian boys. They received this reply  
from the chiefs :  
  
‘Several of our young people were educated at one of your

After the principal business was settled, the  
commissioners from Virginia acquainted the  
Indians by a speech that there was at Williams-  
burg a college, with a fund for educating Indian  
youth; and that, if the Six Nations would send  
down half a dozen of their young lads to that  
college, the government would take care that  
they should be well provided for, and instructed  
in all the learning of the white people. . . . We  
are convinced [the Indians replied] that you mean  
to do us good by your proposal, and we thank you  
heartily. But you, who are wisé, must know that  
different nations have different conceptions of  
things; and you will therefore not take it amiss,  
if our ideas of this kind of education happen not  
to be the same with yours. We have had some  
experience of it; several of our young people were  
formerly brought up at the colleges of the north-  
ern provinces; they were instructed in all your  
sciences; but when they came back to us they  
were bad runners, ignorant of every means of liv-  
ing in the woods, unable to bear cold or hunger,  
knew neither how to build a cabin, take a deer, nor  
kill an enemy, spoke our language imperfectly,  
were therefore neither fit for hunters, warriors,  
nor counsellors; they were totally good for no-  
thing. Weare however not the less obliged by your  
kind offer, though we decline accepting it; and, to  
show our grateful sense of it, if the gentlemen of  
Virginia will send us a dozen of their sons, we will  
take great care of their education, instruct them

right hand had touched the ground maize  
growing; where her left had been, kidney  
beans, and where she sat they found tobacco.

this kind of education happen not to be  
the same with yours. We have had some  
experience of it; several of our young  
people were formerly brought up at the  
colleges of the northern provinces; they  
were instructed in all your sciences; but  
when they came back to us they were bad  
runners, ignorant of every means of living

ger, knew neither how to build a cabin,  
take a deer, nor kill an enemy, spoke our  
language imperfectly, therefore  
neither fit for hunters, warriors nor coun  
sellors; they were totally good for nothing  
We are, however, not the less obliged by  
your kind offer, though we decline accept  
ing it; and, to show our grateful sense of  
it, if the gentlemen of Virginia will send  
us a dozen of their sons, we will take great  
care of their education, instruct them in all
