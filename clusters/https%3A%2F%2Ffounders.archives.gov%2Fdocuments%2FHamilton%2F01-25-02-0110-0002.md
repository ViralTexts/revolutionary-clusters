Sir,  
Some of the warm personal friends of Mr. Adams are taking unwearied pains to disparage the motives of those Federalists, who advocate the equal support of Gen. Pinckney, at the approaching election of President and Vice-President. They are exhibited under a variety of aspects equally derogatory. Sometimes they are versatile, factious spirits, who cannot be long satisfied with any chief, however meritorious:—Sometimes they are ambitious spirits, who can be contented with no man that will not submit to be governed by them:—Sometimes they are intriguing partisans of Great-Britain, who, devoted to the advancement of her views, are incensed against Mr. Adams for the independent impartiality of his conduct.  
In addition to a full share of the obloquy vented against this description of persons collectively, peculiar accusations have been devised, to swell the catalogue of my demerits. Among these, the resentment of disappointed ambition, forms a prominent feature. It is pretended, that had the President, upon the demise of General Washington, appointed me Commander in Chief, he would have been, in my estimation, all that is wise, and good and great.  
It is necessary, for the public cause, to repel these slanders; by stating the real views of the persons who are calumniated, and the reasons of their conduct.  
In executing this task, with particular reference to myself, I ought to premise, that the ground upon which I stand, is different from that of most of those who are confounded with me as in pursuit of the same plan. While our object is common, our motives are variously dissimilar. A part, well affected to Mr. Adams, have no other wish than to take a double chance against Mr. Jefferson. Another part, feeling a diminution of confidence in him, still hope that the general tenor of his conduct will be essentially right. Few go as far in their objections as I do. Not denying to Mr. Adams patriotism and integrity, and even talents of a certain kind, I should be deficient in candor, were I to conceal the conviction, that he does not possess the talents adapted to the Administration of Government, and that there are great and intrinsic defects in his character, which unfit him for the office of Chief Magistrate.  
  
To give a correct idea of the circumstances which have gradually produced this conviction, it may be useful to retrospect to an early period.  
I was one of that numerous class who had conceived a high veneration for Mr. Adams, on account of the part he acted in the first stages of our revolution. My imagination had exalted him to a high eminence, as a man of patriotic, bold, profound, and comprehensive mind. But in the progress of the war, opinions were ascribed to him, which brought into question, with me, the solidity of his understanding. He was represented to be of the number of those who favored the enlistment of our troops annually, or for short periods, rather than for the term of the war; a blind and infatuated policy, directly contrary to the urgent recommendation of General Washington, and which had nearly proved the ruin of our cause. He was also said to have advocated the project of appointing yearly a new Commander of the Army; a project which, in any service, is likely to be attended with more evils than benefits; but which, in ours, at the period in question, was chimerical, from the want of persons qualified to succeed, and pernicious, from the peculiar fitness of the officer first appointed, to strengthen, by personal influence, the too feeble cords which bound to the service, an ill-paid, ill-clothed, and undisciplined soldiery.  
It is impossible for me to assert, at this distant day, that these suggestions were brought home to Mr. Adams in such a manner as to ascertain their genuineness; but I distinctly remember their existence, and my conclusion from them; which was, that, if true, they proved this gentleman to be infected with some visionary notions, and that he was far less able in the practice, than in the theory, of politics. I remember also, that they had the effect of inducing me to qualify the admiration which I had once entertained for him, and to reserve for opportunities of future scrutiny, a definitive opinion of the true standard of his character.  
In this disposition I was, when just before the close of the war, I became a member of Congress.  
The situation in which I found myself there, was far from being inauspicious to a favorable estimate of Mr. Adams.  
Upon my first going into Congress, I discovered symptoms of a party already formed, too well disposed to subject the interests of the United States to the management of France. Though I felt, in common with those who had participated in our Revolution, a lively sentiment of good will towards a power, whose co-operation, however it was and ought to have been dictated by its own interest, had been extremely useful to us, and had been afforded in a liberal and handsome manner; yet, tenacious of the real independence of our country, and dreading the preponderance of foreign influence, as the natural disease of popular government, I was struck with disgust at the appearance, in the very cradle of our Republic, of a party actuated by an undue complaisance to foreign power; and I resolved at once to resist this bias in our affairs: a resolution, which has been the chief cause of the persecution I have endured in the subsequent stages of my political life.  
Among the fruits of the bias I have mentioned, were the celebrated instructions to our Commissioners, for treating of peace with Great-Britain; which, not only as to final measures, but also as to preliminary and intermediate negociations, placed them in a state of dependence on the French ministry, humiliating to themselves, and unsafe for the interests of the country. This was the more exceptionable, as there was cause to suspect, that in regard to the two cardinal points of the fisheries and the navigation of the Mississippi, the policy of the cabinet of Versailles did not accord with the wishes of the United States.  
The Commissioners, of whom Mr. Adams was one, had the fortitude to break through the fetters which were laid upon them by those instructions; and there is reason to believe, that by doing it, they both accelerated the peace with Great-Britain, and improved the terms, while they preserved our faith with France.  
Yet a serious attempt was made to obtain from Congress a formal censure of their conduct. The attempt failed, and instead of censure, the praise was bestowed which was justly due to the accomplishment of a treaty advantageous to this country, beyond the most sanguine expectation. In this result, my efforts were heartily united.  
The principal merit of the negociation with Great-Britain, in some quarters, has been bestowed upon Mr. Adams; but it is certainly the right of Mr. Jay, who took a lead in the several steps of the transaction, no less honorable to his talents than to his firmness. The merit, nevertheless, of a full and decisive co-operation, is justly due to Mr. Adams.  
It will readily be seen, that such a course of things was calculated to impress me with a disposition friendly to Mr. Adams. I certainly felt it, and gave him much of my consideration and esteem.  
But this did not hinder me from making careful observations upon his several communications, and endeavoring to derive from them an accurate idea of his talents and character. This scrutiny enhanced my esteem in the main for his moral qualifications, but lessened my respect for his intellectual endowments. I then adopted an opinion, which all my subsequent experience has confirmed, that he is a man of an imagination sublimated and eccentric; propitious neither to the regular display of sound judgment, nor to steady perseverance in a systematic plan of conduct; and I began to perceive what has been since too manifest, that to this defect are added the unfortunate foibles of a vanity without bounds, and a jealousy capable of discoloring every object.  
Strong evidence of some traits of this character, is to be found in a Journal of Mr. Adams, which was sent by the then Secretary of Foreign Affairs to Congress. The reading of this Journal, extremely embarrassed his friends, especially the delegates of Massachusetts; who, more than once, interrupted it, and at last, succeeded in putting a stop to it, on the suggestion that it bore the marks of a private and confidential paper, which, by some mistake, had gotten into its present situation, and never could have been designed as a public document for the inspection of Congress. The good humor of that body yielded to the suggestion.  
  
The particulars of this Journal cannot be expected to have remained in my memory—but I recollect one which may serve as a sample. Being among the guests invited to dine with the Count de Vergennes, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Adams thought fit to give a specimen of American politeness, by conducting Madame de Vergennes to dinner; in the way, she was pleased to make retribution in the current coin of French politeness—by saying to him, “Monsieur Adams, vous etes le Washington de negociation.”  
Mr. Adams, you are the Washington of negociation.  
Stating the incident, he makes this comment upon it: “These people have a very pretty knack of paying compliments.” He might have added, they have also a very dexterous knack of disguising a sarcasm.  
This opinion, however, which I have avowed, did not prevent my entering cordially into the plan of supporting Mr. Adams for the office of Vice-President, under the new Constitution. I still thought that he had high claims upon the public gratitude, and possessed a substantial worth of character, which might atone for some great defects. In addition to this, it was well known, that he was a favorite of New-England, and it was obvious that his union with General Washington would tend to give the government, in its outset, all the strength which it could derive from the character of the two principal magistrates.  
  
But it was deemed an essential point of caution to take care, that accident or an intrigue of the opposers of the Government, should not raise Mr. Adams, instead of General Washington, to the first place. This, every friend of the Government would have considered as a disastrous event; as well because it would have displayed a capricious operation of the system in elevating to the first station, a man intended for the second; as because it was conceived that the incomparably superior weight and transcendant popularity of Gen. Washington, rendered his presence at the head of the Government, in its first organization, a matter of primary and indispensable importance. It was therefore agreed that a few votes should be diverted from Mr. Adams to other persons, so as to insure to General Washington a plurality.  
Great was my astonishment, and equally great my regret, when, afterwards, I learned from persons of unquestionable veracity, that Mr. Adams had complained of unfair treatment, in not having been permitted to take an equal chance with General Washington, by leaving the votes to an uninfluenced current.  
The extreme egotism of the temper, which could blind a man to considerations so obvious as those that had recommended the course pursued, cannot be enforced by my comment. It exceeded all that I had imagined, and shewed, in too strong a light, that the vanity which I have ascribed to him, existed to a degree that rendered it more than a harmless foible.  
Mr. Adams was elected Vice-President. His public conduct, in that station, was satisfactory to the friends of the Government, though they were now and then alarmed by appearances of some eccentric tendencies.  
It is, in particular, a tribute due from me, to acknowledge, that Mr. Adams, being in quality of Vice-President, ex officio, one of the Trustees of the Sinking Fund, I experienced from him the most complete support; which was the more gratifying to me, as I had to struggle against the systematic opposition of Mr. Jefferson, seconded occasionally by Mr. Randolph. Though it would be an ill compliment to Mr. Adams, not to presume that the support which he gave me, was the dictate of his sense of the public interest; yet, so cordial and useful a co-operation, at a moment when I was assailed with all the weapons of party rancor, won from me an unfeigned return of the most amicable sentiments.  
I lost no opportunity of combating the prejudices industriously propagated against him by his political enemies; and, for a considerable time, went quite as far as candor would permit, to extenuate the failings which more and more alarmed and dissatisfied his friends.  
The epoch at length arrived, when the retreat of General Washington made it necessary to fix upon a successor. By this time, men of principal influence in the Federal Party, whose situation had led them to an intimate acquaintance with Mr. Adam’s character, began to entertain serious doubts about his fitness for the station; yet, his pretensions, in several respects, were so strong, that after mature reflection, they thought it better to indulge their hopes than to listen to their fears. To this conclusion, the desire of preserving harmony in the Federal Party, was a weighty inducement. Accordingly it was determined to support Mr. Adams for the Chief Magistracy.  
It was evidently of much consequence to endeavor to have an eminent Federalist Vice-President. Mr. Thomas Pinckney, of South Carolina, was selected for this purpose. This gentleman, too little known in the North, had been all his life time distinguished in the South, for the mildness and amiableness of his manners, the rectitude and purity of his morals, and the soundness and correctness of his understanding, accompanied by a habitual discretion and self-command, which has often occasioned a parallel to be drawn between him and the venerated Washington. In addition to these recommendations, he had been, during a critical period, our Minister at the Court of London, and recently Envoy Extraordinary to the Court of Spain; and in both these trusts, he had acquitted himself to the satisfaction of all parties. With the Court of Spain he had effected a Treaty, which removed all the thorny subjects of contention, that had so long threatened the peace of the two countries, and stipulated for the United States, on their Southern frontier, and on the Mississippi, advantages of real magnitude and importance.  
Well-informed men knew that the event of the Election was extremely problematical; and, while the friends of Mr. Jefferson predicted his success with sanguine confidence, his opposers feared that he might have at least an equal chance with any Federal Candidate.  
To exclude him, was deemed, by the Federalists, a primary object. Those of them who possessed the best means of judging, were of opinion that it was far less important, whether Mr. Adams or Mr. Pinckney was the successful Candidate, than that Mr. Jefferson should not be the person; and on this principle, it was understood among them, that the two first mentioned gentlemen should be equally supported; leaving to casual accessions of votes in favor of the one or the other, to turn the scale between them.  
In this plan I united with good faith; in the resolution, to which I scrupulously adhered, of giving to each Candidate an equal support. This was done, wherever my influence extended; as was more particularly manifested in the State of New-York, where all the Electors were my warm personal or political friends, and all gave a concurrent vote for the two Federal Candidates.  
It is true that a faithful execution of this plan would have given Mr. Pinckney a somewhat better chance than Mr. Adams; nor shall it be concealed, that an issue favorable to the former would not have been disagreeable to me; as indeed I declared at the time, in the circles of my confidential friends.  
I appeal particularly to Lt. Governor Van Rensselaer and R. Troup, Esq.  
My position was, that if chance should decide in favor of Mr. Pinckney, it probably would not be a misfortune; since he, to every essential qualification for the office, added a temper far more discreet and conciliatory than that of Mr. Adams.  
This disposition, on my part, at that juncture, proves, at least, that my disapprobation of Mr. Adams has not originated in the disappointment, to which it has been uncandidly attributed. No private motive could then have entered into it. Not the least collision or misunderstanding had ever happened between that gentleman and myself—on the contrary, as I have already stated, I had reason individually to be pleased with him.  
No: The considerations which had reconciled me to the success of Mr. Pinckney, were of a nature exclusively public. They resulted from the disgusting egotism, the distempered jealousy, and the ungovernable indiscretion of Mr. Adams’s temper, joined to some doubts of the correctness of his maxims of Administration. Though in matters of Finance he had acted with the Federal Party; yet he had, more than once, broached theories at variance with his practice. And in conversation, he repeatedly made excursions in the field of foreign politics, which alarmed the friends of the prevailing system.  
The plan of giving equal support to the two Federalist Candidates, was not pursued. Personal attachment for Mr. Adams, especially in the New-England States, caused a number of the votes to be withheld from Mr. Pinckney, and thrown away. The result was, that Mr. Adams was elected President by a majority of two votes, and Mr. Jefferson Vice-President.  
This issue demonstrated the wisdom of the plan which had been abandoned, and how greatly, in departing from it, the cause had been sacrificed to the man. But for a sort of miracle, the departure would have made Mr. Jefferson President. In each of the States of Pennsylvania, Virginia and North-Carolina, Mr. Adams had one vote. In the two latter States, the one vote was as much against the stream of popular prejudice, as it was against the opinions of the other Electors. The firmness of the individuals who separated from their colleagues, was so extraordinary, as to have been contrary to all probable calculation. Had only one of them thrown his vote into the other scale, there would have been an equality, and no election. Had two done it, the choice would have fallen upon Mr. Jefferson.  
No one, sincere in the opinion that this gentleman was an ineligible and dangerous Candidate, can hesitate in pronouncing, that in dropping Mr. Pinckney, too much was put at hazard; and that those who promoted the other course, acted with prudence and propriety.  
It is a fact, which ought not to be forgotten, that Mr. Adams, who had evinced discontent, because he had not been permitted to take an equal chance with General Washington, was enraged with all those who had thought that Mr. Pinckney ought to have had an equal chance with him. But in this there is perfect consistency. The same turn of temper is the solution of the displeasure in both cases.  
It is to this circumstance of the equal support of Mr. Pinckney, that we are in a great measure to refer the serious scism which has since grown up in the Federal Party.  
Mr. Adams never could forgive the men who had been engaged in the plan; though it embraced some of his most partial admirers. He has discovered bitter animosity against several of them. Against me, his rage has been so vehement, as to have caused him more than once, to forget the decorum, which, in his situation, ought to have been an inviolable law. It will not appear an exaggeration to those who have studied his character, to suppose that he is capable of being alienated from a system to which he has been attached, because it is upheld by men whom he hates. How large a share this may have had in some recent aberrations, cannot easily be determined.  
Occurrences which have either happened or come to light since the election of Mr. Adams to the Presidency, confirming my unfavorable forebodings of his character, have given new and decisive energy, in my mind, to the sentiment of his unfitness for the station.  
The letter which has just appeared in the public prints, written by him, while Vice-President, to Tench Coxe, is of itself conclusive evidence of the justness of this sentiment. It is impossible to speak of this transaction in terms suited to its nature, without losing sight that Mr. Adams is the President of the United States.  
This letter avows the suspicion, that the appointment of Mr. Pinckney to the Court of London, had been procured or promoted by British Influence. And considering the parade with which the story of the Duke of Leeds is told, it is fair to consider that circumstance as the principal, if not the sole, ground of the odious and degrading suspicion.  
Let any man of candor or knowledge of the world, pronounce on this species of evidence.  
It happened unfortunately for the Pinckneys, that, while boys, and long before our revolution, they went to school with a British Duke, who was afterwards Minister of the British Government for the foreign department. This indiscreet Duke, perhaps for no better reason than the desire of saying something to a parting American Minister, and the want of something better to say, divulges to him the dangerous secret, that the two Pinckneys had been his classmates, and goes the alarming length of making enquiry about their health. From this, it is sagaciously inferred, that these gentlemen have “many powerful old friends in England;” and from this again, that the Duke of Leeds (of course of the number of these old friends) had procured by intrigue the appointment of one of his class-mates to the Court of London; or, in the language of the letter, that much British influence had been exerted in the appointment.  
In the school of jealousy, stimulated by ill-will, logic like this may pass for substantial; but what is it in the school of reason and justice?  
Though this contaminating connection of the Pinckneys with the Duke of Leeds, in their juvenile years, did not hinder them from fighting for the independence of their native country throughout our revolution; yet the supposition is, that the instant the war was terminated, it transformed them from the soldiers of liberty into the tools of the British Monarchy.  
But the hostility of the Pinckneys to Mr. Adams, evidenced by their “long intrigue” against him, of which he speaks in the letter, is perhaps intended as a still stronger proof of their devotion to Great-Britain—the argument may be thus understood: Mr. Adams is the bulwark of his country against foreign influence. The batteries of every foreign power, desirous of acquiring an ascendant in our affairs, are of consequence always open against him—and, the presumption therefore must be, that every citizen who is his enemy, is the confederate of one or another of those foreign powers.  
Let us, without contesting this argument of self-love, examine into the facts upon which its applicability must depend.  
The evidence of “the long intrigue” seems to be, that the family of the Pinckney’s contributed to limit the duration of Mr. Adams’s commission to the Court of London to the term of three years, in order to make way for some of themselves to succeed him. This, it must be confessed, was a long-sighted calculation in a government like ours.  
A summary of the transaction, will be the best comment on the inference which has been drawn.  
The resolution of Congress by which Mr. Adams’s commission was limited, was a general one, applying to the Commissions of all Ministers to foreign Courts. When it was proposed and adopted, it is certain that neither of the two Pinckney’s was a member of Congress; and it is believed that they were both at Charleston, in South Carolina, their usual place of abode, more than eight hundred miles distant from the seat of Government.  
But they had, it seems, a cousin, Mr. Charles Pinckney, who was in Congress; and this cousin it was who moved the restrictive resolution. Let us enquire who seconded and who voted for it.  
It was seconded by Mr. Howell, a member from Rhode Island, the very person who nominated Mr. Adams as Minister to Great-Britain, and was voted for by the four Eastern States, with New-York, New-Jersey, Maryland and South Carolina. Mr. Gerry, always a zealous partisan of Mr. Adams, was among the supporters of the resolution. To make out this to be a machination of the two Pinckneys, many things must be affirmed: First, that their cousin Charles is always subservient to their views (which would equally prove that they have long been, and still are, opposers of the Federal Administration:)—Second, that this cunning wight had been able to draw the four Eastern States into his plot, as well as New-York, New-Jersey, Maryland, and South-Carolina:—Third, that the Pinckneys could foresee, at the distance of three years, the existence of a state of things which would enable them to reap the fruit of their contrivance.  
Would not the circumstances better warrant the suspicion that the resolution was a contrivance of the friends of Mr. Adams, to facilitate in some way his election, and that Mr. Pinckney was their coadjutor, rather than their prompter?  
But the truth most probably is, that the measure was a mere precaution to bring under frequent review the propriety of continuing a Minister at a particular Court, and to facilitate the removal of a disagreeable one, without the harshness of formally displacing him. In a policy of this sort, the cautious maxims of New-England would very naturally have taken a lead.  
Thus in the very grounds of the suspicion, as far as they appear, we find its refutation. The complete futility of it will now be illustrated by additional circumstances.  
It is a fact, that the rigor with which the war was prosecuted by the British armies in our Southern quarter, had produced among the friends of our Revolution there, more animosity against the British Government, than in the other parts of the United States: and it is a matter of notoriety, in the same quarter, that this disposition was conspicuous among the Pinckneys, and their connections. It may be added, that they were likewise known to have been attached to the French Revolution, and to have continued so, till long after the appointment of Mr. Thomas Pinckney to the Court of London.  
These propensities of the gentlemen, were certainly not such as to make them favorites of Great-Britain, or the appointment of one of them to that Court, an object of particular solicitude.  
As far as appeared at the time, the idea of nominating Mr. Thomas Pinckney, originated with the then President himself: but whatever may have been its source, it is certain that it met the approbation of the whole Administration, Mr. Jefferson included. This fact alone, will go far to refute the surmise of a British agency in the appointment.  
Supposing, that, contrary to all probability, Great-Britain had really taken some unaccountable fancy for Mr. Pinckney, upon whom was her influence exerted?  
Had the virtuous, circumspect Washington been ensnared in her insidious toils? Had she found means for once to soften the stern, inflexible hostility of Jefferson? Had Randolph been won by her meretricious caresses? Had Knox, the uniform friend of Mr. Adams, been corrupted by her seducing wiles? Or was it all the dark work of the alien Secretary of the Treasury? Was it this arch juggler, who debauched the principles, or transformed the prejudices, of Mr. Pinckney; who persuaded the British Government to adopt him as a pliant instrument; who artfully induced the President to propose him as of his own selection; who lulled the zealous vigilance of Jefferson and Randolf, and surprised the unsuspecting friends of Knox?  
But when the thing had been accomplished, no matter by what means, it was surely to have been expected that the man of its choice would have been treated at the Court of London with distinguished regard, and that his conduct towards that Court would have been marked, if not by some improper compliances, at least by some displays of extraordinary complaisance.  
Yet, strange as it may appear, upon Mr. Adams’s hypothesis, it might be proved, if requisite, that neither the one nor the other took place. It might be proved that, far from Mr. Pinckney’s having experienced any flattering distinctions, incidents not pleasant to his feelings, had occurred, and that in the discharge of his official functions, he had advanced pretensions in favor of the United States, from which, with the approbation of the then Secretary of State, Mr. Jefferson, he was instructed to desist.  
What will Mr. Adams or his friends reply to all these facts? How will he be excused for indulging and declaring, on grounds so frivolous, a suspicion so derogatory, of a man so meritorious—of a man who has acted in a manner so unexceptionable?  
But a more serious question remains: How will Mr. Adams answer to the Government and to his Country, for having thus wantonly given the sanction of his opinion to the worst of the aspersions which the enemies of the Administration have impudently thrown upon it? Can we be surprised that such a torrent of slander was poured out against it, when a man, the second in official rank, the second in the favor of the friends of the Government, stooped to become himself one of its calumniators? It is peculiarly unlucky for Mr. Adams in this affair, that he is known to have desired, at the time, the appointment which was given to Mr. Pinckney. The President declined the measure, thinking that it was compatible neither with the spirit of the constitution nor with the dignity of the Government, to designate the Vice-President to such a station.  
This letter, better than volumes, developes the true, the unfortunate character of Mr. Adams.  
The remaining causes of dissatisfaction with him respect his conduct in the office of President; which, in my opinion, has been a heterogeneous compound of right and wrong, of wisdom and error.  
The outset was distinguished by a speech which his friends lamented as temporising. It had the air of a lure for the favor of his opponents at the expense of his sincerity; but being of an equivocal complexion, to which no precise design can be annexed, it is barely mentioned as a circumstance, which, in conjunction with others of a more positive tint, may serve to explain character.  
It is in regard to our foreign relations, that the public measures of Mr. Adams first attract criticism.  
It will be recollected that General Pinckney, the brother of Thomas, and the gentleman now supported together with Mr. Adams, had been deputed by President Washington, as successor to Mr. Monroe, and had been refused to be received by the French Government in his quality of Minister Plenipotentiary.  
This, among those of the well-informed, who felt a just sensibility for the honor of their country, excited much disgust and resentment. But the Opposition-Party, ever too ready to justify the French Government at the expense of their own, vindicated or apologized for the ill treatment: and the mass of the community, though displeased with it, did not appear to feel the full force of the indignity.  
As a final effort for accommodation, and as a mean, in case of failure, of enlightening and combining public opinion, it was resolved to make another, and a more solemn, experiment, in the form of a commission of three.  
This measure (with some objections to the detail) was approved by all parties; by the Antifederalists, because they thought no evil so great as the rupture with France; by the Federalists, because it was their system to avoid war with every power, if it could be done without the sacrifice of essential interests or absolute humiliation.  
Even such of them who conceived that the insults of the French Government, and the manifestation of its ill will, had already gone far enough to call for measures of vigor; perceiving that the nation was not generally penetrated with the same conviction, and would not support with zeal measures of that nature, unless their necessity was rendered still more apparent, acquiesced in the expediency of another mission. They hoped that it would serve either to compose the differences which existed, or to make the necessity of resistance to the violence of France, palpable to every good citizen.  
  
The expediency of the step was suggested to Mr. Adams, through a Federal channel, a considerable time before he determined to take it. He hesitated whether it could be done after the rejection of General Pinckney, without national debasement. The doubt was an honorable one; it was afterwards very properly surrendered to the cogent reasons which pleaded for a further experiment.  
The event of this experiment is fresh in our recollection. Our Envoys, like our Minister, were rejected. Tribute was demanded as a preliminary to negociation. To their immortal honor, though France at the time was proudly triumphant, they repelled the disgraceful pretension. Americans will never forget that General Pinckney was a member, and an efficient member, of this Commission.  
This conduct of the French Government, in which it is difficult to say, whether despotic insolence or unblushing corruption was most prominent, electrified the American people with a becoming indignation. In vain the partisans of France attempted to extenuate. The public voice was distinct and audible. The nation, disdaining so foul an overture, was ready to encounter the worst consequences of resistance.  
  
Without imitating the flatterers of Mr. Adams, who, in derogation from the intrinsic force of circumstances, and from the magnanimity of the nation, ascribe to him the whole merits of producing the spirit which appeared in the community, it shall with cheerfulness be acknowledged, that he took upon the occasion a manly and courageous lead—that he did all in his power to rouse the pride of the nation—to inspire it with a just sense of the injuries and outrages which it had experienced, and to dispose it to a firm and magnanimous resistance; and that his efforts contributed materially to the end.  
The friends of the Government were not agreed as to ulterior measures. Some were for immediate and unqualified war; others for a more mitigated course; the dissolution of treaties, preparation of force by land and sea, partial hostilities of a defensive tendency; leaving to France the option of seeking accommodation, or proceeding to open war. The latter course prevailed.  
Though not as bold and energetic as the other; yet, considering the prosperous state of French affairs, when it was adopted, and how many nations had been appalled and prostrated by the French Power—the conduct pursued bore sufficiently the marks of courage and elevation to raise the national character to an exalted height throughout Europe.  
Much is it to be deplored that we should have been precipitated from this proud eminence without necesity, without temptation.  
The latter conduct of the President forms a painful contrast to his commencement. Its effects have been directly the reverse. It has sunk the tone of the public mind—it has impaired the confidence of the friends of the Government in the Executive Chief—it has distracted public opinion—it has unnerved the public councils—it has sown the seeds of discord at home, and lowered the reputation of the Government abroad. The circumstances which preceded, aggravate the disagreeableness of the results. They prove that the injudicious things which have been acted, were not the effects of any regular plan, but the fortuitous emanations of momentary impulses.  
The session, which ensued the promulgation of the dispatches of our Commissioners, was about to commence. Mr. Adams arrived at Philadelphia from his seat at Quincy. The tone of his mind seemed to have been raised, rather than depressed.  
It was suggested to him, that it might be expedient to insert in his Speech of Congress, a sentiment of this import: That after the repeatedly rejected advances of this country, its dignity required that it should be left with France in future to make the first overture; that if, desirous of reconciliation, she should evince the disposition by sending a Minister to this Government, he would be received with the respect due to his character, and treated with in the frankness of a sincere desire of accommodation.  
  
The suggestion was received in a manner both indignant and intemperate.  
Mr. Adams declared as a sentiment which he had adopted on mature reflection: That if France should send a Minister to-morrow, he would order him back the day after.  
So imprudent an idea was easily refuted. Little argument was requisite to shew that by a similar system of retaliation, when one Government in a particular instance had refused the Envoy of another, nations might entail upon each other perpetual hostility; mutually barring the avenues of explanation.  
In less than forty-eight hours from this extraordinary sally, the mind of Mr. Adams underwent a total revolution—he resolved not only to insert in his speech the sentiment which had been proposed to him, but to go farther, and to declare, that if France would give explicit assurances of receiving a Minister from this country, with due respect, he would send one.  
In vain was this extension of the sentiment opposed by all his Ministers, as being equally incompatible with good policy, and with the dignity of the nation—he obstinately persisted, and the pernicious declaration was introduced.  
I call it pernicious, because it was the ground-work of the false steps which have succeeded.  
The declaration recommended to the President was a prudent one.  
The measures of Congress, by their mitigated form, shewed that an eye had been still kept upon pacification. A numerous party were averse from war with France at any rate. In the rest of the community, a strong preference of honorable accommodation to final rupture was discernible, even amidst the effusions of resentment.  
The charges which we had exhibited in the face of the world against the French Government, were of a high and disgraceful complexion; they had been urged with much point and emphasis.  
To give an opening to France, to make conciliatory propositions, some salve for her pride was necessary. It was also necessary she should be assured that she would not expose herself to an affront by a refusal to receive the agent whom she might employ for that purpose. The declaration proposed fulfilled both objects.  
It was likely to have another important advantage. It would be a new proof to the American people of the moderate and pacific temper of their Government; which would tend to preserve their confidence, and to dispose them more and more to meet inevitable extremities with fortitude and without murmurs.  
But the supplement to the declaration was a blameable excess. It was more than sufficient for the ends to be answered. It waved the point of honor, which, after two rejections of our Ministers, required that the next Mission between the two countries, should proceed from France. After the mortifying humiliations we had endured, the national dignity demanded that this point should not be departed from without necessity. No such necessity could be pretended to exist: moreover, another mission by us would naturally be regarded as evidence of a disposition on our part to purchase the friendship of revolutionary France, even at the expense of honor; an impression which could hardly fail to injure our interests with other countries: and the measure would involve the further inconvenience of transferring the negociation from this country, where our government could regulate it according to its own view of exigencies, to France, where that advantage would be enjoyed by her Government, and where the power of judging for us must be delegated to Commissioners; who, acting under immense individual responsibility, at a distance too great for consultation, would be apt to act with hesitancy and irresolution, whether the policy of the case required concession or firmness. This was to place it too much in the power of France to manage the progress of the negociation according to events.  
It has been said that Paris was wisely preferred as the place of negociation, because it served to avoid the caballings of a French Minister in this country. But there is not enough in this argument to counterbalance the weighty considerations on the other side. The intrigues of Genet and his successors were perplexing to the Government, chiefly because they were too well seconded by the prepossessions of the people. The great alteration in public opinion, had put it completely in the power of our Executive to controul the machinations of any future public Agent of France. It ought also to be remembered, that if France has not known agents, she never will be without secret ones, and that her partisans among our citizens, can much better promote her cause, than any Agents she can send. In fact, her Agents, by their blunders, were in the event rather useful than pernicious to our affairs.  
But is it likely that France would have sent a minister to this country? When we find, that from calculations of policy she could brook the ignominy which the publication of the dispatches of our commissioners was calculated to bring upon her; and stifling her resentment, could invite the renewal of negociation; what room can there be to doubt, that the same calculations would have induced her to send a minister to this country when an opening was given for it?  
The French minister for foreign relations, through the French Diplomatic Agent at the Hague, had opened a communication with Mr. Murray, our Resident there, for the purpose of reviving negociation between the two countries. In this manner, assurances were given that France was disposed to treat, and that a Minister from us would be received and accredited. But they were accompanied with intimations of the characters proper to be employed, and who would be likely to succeed; which was exceptionable, both as it savored of the pretension (justly censured by the President himself) of prescribing to other Governments how they were to manage their own affairs; and as it might, according to circumstances, be construed into a tacit condition of the promise to receive a Minister. Overtures so circuitous and informal, through a person who was not the regular organ of the French government for making them, to a person who was not the regular organ of the American government for receiving them, might be a very fit mode of preparing the way for the like overtures in a more authentic and obligatory shape: But they were a very inadequate basis for the institution of a new Mission.  
When the President pledged himself in his speech to send a minister, if satisfactory assurances of a proper reception were given, he must have been understood to mean such as were direct and official, not such as were both informal and destitute of a competent sanction.  
Yet upon this loose and vague foundation, Mr. Adams precipitately nominated Mr. Murray as Envoy to the French Republic, without previous consultation with any of his Ministers. The nomination itself was to each of them, even to the Secretary of State, his Constitutional Counsellor, in similar affairs, the first notice of the project.  
Thus was the measure wrong, both as to mode and substance.  
A President is not bound to conform to the advice of his Ministers. He is even under no positive injunction to ask or require it. But the Constitution presumes that he will consult them; and the genius of our government and the public good recommend the practice.  
As the President nominates his Ministers, and may displace them when he pleases, it must be his own fault if he be not surrounded by men, who for ability and integrity deserve his confidence. And if his ministers are of this character, the consulting of them will always be likely to be useful to himself and to the State. Let it even be supposed that he is a man of talents superior to the collected talents of all his ministers, (which can seldom happen, as the world has seen but few Fredericks) he may, nevertheless, often assist his judgment by a comparison and collision of ideas. The greatest genius, hurried away by the rapidity of its own conceptions, will occasionally overlook obstacles which ordinary and more phlegmatic men will discover, and which, when presented to his consideration, will be thought by himself decisive objections to his plans.  
When, unhappily, an ordinary man dreams himself to be a Frederick, and through vanity refrains from counselling with his constitutional advisers, he is very apt to fall into the hands of miserable intriguers, with whom his self-love is more at ease, and who without difficulty slide into his confidence, and by flattery, govern him.  
The ablest men may profit by advice. Inferior men cannot dispense with it; and if they do not get it through legitimate channels, it will find its way to them, through such as are clandestine and impure.  
Very different from the practice of Mr. Adams was that of the modest and sage Washington. He consulted much, pondered much, resolved slowly, resolved surely.  
  
And as surely, Mr. Adams might have benefited by the advice of his ministers.  
The stately system of not consulting Ministers is likely to have a further disadvantage. It will tend to exclude from places of primary trust, the men most fit to occupy them.  
Few and feeble are the interested inducements to accept a place in our Administration. Far from being lucrative, there is not one which will not involve pecuniary sacrifice to every honest man of preeminent talents. And has not experience shewn, that he must be fortunate indeed, if even the successful execution of his task can secure to him consideration and fame? Of a large harvest of obloquy he is sure.  
If excluded from the counsels of the Executive Chief, his office must become truly insignificant. What able and virtuous man will long consent to be so miserable a pageant?  
Every thing that tends to banish from the Administration able men, tends to diminish the chances of able counsels. The probable operation of a system of this kind, must be to consign places of the highest trust to incapable honest men, whose inducement will be a livelihood, or to capable dishonest men, who will seek indirect indemnifications for the deficiency of direct and fair inducements.  
The precipitate nomination of Mr. Murray, brought Mr. Adams into an aukward predicament.  
He found it necessary to change his plan in its progress, and instead of one, to nominate three Envoys, and to super-add a promise, that, though appointed, they should not leave the United States till further and more perfect assurances were given by the French Government.  
This remodification of the measure was a virtual acknowledgment that it had been premature. How unseemly was this fluctuation in the Executive Chief. It argued either instability of views, or want of sufficient consideration beforehand. The one or the other, in an affair of so great moment, is a serious reproach.  
Additional and more competent assurances were received; but before the Envoys departed, intelligence arrived of a new Revolution in the French Government; which, in violation of the Constitution, had expelled two of the Directory.  
Another Revolution: Another Constitution overthrown: Surely here was reason for a pause, at least till it was ascertained that the new Directory would adhere to the engagement of its predecessors, and would not send back our Envoys with disgrace.  
In the then posture of French affairs, which externally as well as internally, were unprosperous, a pause was every way prudent. The recent Revolution was a valid motive for it.  
Definitive compacts between nations, called real Treaties, are binding, notwithstanding Revolutions of Governments. But to apply the maxim to Ministerial acts, preparatory only to negociation, is to extend it too far; to apply it to such acts of an unstable revolutionary Government (like that of France at that time) is to abuse it.  
Had any policy of the moment demanded it, it would have been not at all surprising to have seen the new Directory disavowing the assurance which had been given, and imputing it as a crime to the Ex-Directors, on the pretence that they had prostrated the dignity of the Republic by courting the renewal of negociation with a government, which had so grossly insulted it.  
Yet our Envoys were dispatched without a ratification of the assurance by the new Directory, at the hazard of the interests and the honor of the country.  
Again, the dangerous and degrading system of not consulting Ministers, was acted upon.  
  
When the news of the Revolution in the Directory arrived, Mr. Adams was at his seat in Massachusetts. His Ministers addressed to him a joint letter, communicating the intelligence, and submitting to his consideration, whether that event ought not to suspend the projected mission. In a letter which he afterwards wrote from the same place, he directed the preparation of a draft of instructions for the Envoys, and intimated that their departure would be suspended for some time.  
Shortly after he came to Trenton, where he adjusted with his Ministers the tenor of the instructions to be given; but he observed a profound silence on the question, whether it was expedient that the Mission should proceed. The morning after the instructions were settled, he signified to the Secretary of State that the Envoys were immediately to depart.  
He is reported to have assigned as the reason of his silence, that he knew the opinions of his Ministers from their letter; that he had irrevocably adopted an opposite one; and that he deemed it most delicate not to embarrass them by a useless discussion.  
But would it not have been more prudent to have kept his judgment in some degree in suspense, till after an interview and discussion with his Ministers? Ought he to have taken it for granted that the grounds of his opinion were so infallible, that there was no possibility of arguments being used which were sufficient to shake them? Ought he not to have recollected the sudden revolution which his judgment had undergone in the beginning of the business, and to have inferred from this, that it might have yielded in another instance to better lights? Was it necessary for him, if he had had a conference with his ministers, to have alarmed their delicacy, by prefacing the discussion with a declaration that he had fixed an unalterable opinion? Did not the intimation respecting a suspension of the departure of the Envoys, imply that this would continue till there was a change of circumstances? Was it not a circumstance to strengthen expectation in the Ministers, when consulted about the instructions, that they would be heard as to the principal point, previous to a definitive resolution?  
Giving Mr. Adams credit for sincerity, the desolutoriness of his mind is evinced by the very different grounds upon which, at different times, he has defended the propriety of the mission.  
Sometimes he has treated with ridicule the idea of its being a measure which would terminate in peace; asserting that France would not accommodate, on terms admissible by the United States, and that the effect to be expected from the mission, was the demonstration of this truth, and the union of public opinion on the necessity of war.  
Sometimes, and most frequently, he has vindicated the measure as one conformable with the general and strong wish of the country for peace, and as likely to promote that desirable object.  
It is now earnestly to be hoped, that the final issue, of the Mission, in an honorable accommodation, may compensate for the sacrifice of consistency, dignity, harmony and reputation, at which it has been undertaken.  
But even in relation to the adjustment of differences with the French Republic, the measure was injudicious. It was probable that it would delay, rather than accelerate, such an adjustment.  
The situation of French affairs, at the time of the overtures for renewing the negociation, coincides with the solicitude which was manifested for that object, to render it likely that, at this juncture, France really desired accommodation. If this was so, it is presumeable (as observed in another place) that, had not the declaration about sending a Minister to her intervened, she would have sent one to us, with adequate powers and instructions. Towards a Minister here, our Government might have acted such a part as would have hastened a conclusion; and the Minister, conforming to the impressions of his Government when he was sent, it is not improbable that a desirable arrangement might sometime since have been effected.  
Instead of this, the mode pursued, naturally tended to delay. A lapse of time, by changing the circumstances, is very apt to change the views of Governments. The French Agents, charged with the negociation at Paris, could find little difficulty in protracting it till events (such as the fate of a campaign) should be ascertained, as a guide to rise or fall in their pretensions. And in this way, obstacles might supervene, which would not have existed in the beginning, and which might render accommodation impracticable—or practicable only on terms injurious to our interests.  
Thus, on every just calculation, whatever may be the issue, the measure, in reference either to our internal or foreign affairs, even to our concerns with France herself, was alike impolitic.  
It is sometimes defended by the argument, that when our Commissioners departed, there were circumstances in the position of Europe which made a general peace during the succeeding winter probable, and that it would have been dangerous for this country, remote as it is from Europe, to have been without agents on the spot authorized to settle its controversy with France, at the same epoch. The country, it is said, might otherwise have been left in the perilous situation of having a subsisting quarrel with France, after she had disembarrassed herself of all her European enemies.  
The idea that a general peace was likely to happen during that winter, was, I know, entertained by Mr. Adams himself; for, in a casual conversation at Trenton, he expressed it to me, and I supported a different opinion. But waving now a discussion of the point, and admitting that the expectation was entertained on substantial grounds, though it has not been verified by experience, still the argument de[riv]ed from it is not valid.  
The expediency of the measure must be tested by the state of things when it had its inception. At the time the foundation was laid for it by the speech, when even the nomination of Mr. Murray took place, the affairs of France and of her enemies, portended a result very inauspicious to her, and very different from that of a general peace, on conditions which would leave her the inclination or the power to prosecute hostilities against this country.  
But even on the supposition of other prospects, Mr. Adams had the option of a substitute far preferable to the expedient which he chose.  
He might secretly and confidentially have nominated one or more of our Ministers actually abroad for the purpose of treating with France; with eventual instructions predicated upon appearances of an approaching peace.  
An expedient of this sort, merely provisionary, could have had none of the bad effects of the other. If the secret was kept, it could have had no inconvenient consequences; if divulged, it would have been deemed here and elsewhere, a prudent precaution only, recommended by the distant situation of the country, to meet future casualties, with which we might otherwise not have been able to keep pace. To the enemies of France, it could have given no ill impression of us; to France, no motive to forbear other conciliatory means, for one and the same reason, namely, because the operation was to be eventual.  
There are some collateral incidents connected with this business of the Mission, which it may not be useless to mention, as they will serve still farther to illustrate the extreme propensity of Mr. Adams’s temper to jealousy.  
It happened that I arrived at Trenton a short time before the President—Chief Justice Elsworth a short time after him. This was considered as evidence of a combination between the heads of Departments, the Chief Justice and myself, to endeavor to influence or counteract him in the affair of the Mission.  
The truth, nevertheless, most certainly is, that I went to Trenton with General Wilkinson, pursuant to a preconcert with him of some weeks standing, to accelerate, by personal conferences with the Secretary of War, the adoption and execution of arrangements which had been planned between that General and myself, for the future disposition of the Western Army; that when I left New-York upon this journey, I had no expectation, whatever, that the President would come to Trenton, and that I did not stay at this place a day longer than was indispensable to the object I have stated. General Wilkinson, if necessary, might be appealed to, not only as knowing that this was a real and sincere purpose of my journey, but as possessing satisfactory evidence, that in all probability, I had no anticipation of the movement of the President.  
As to Chief Justice Elsworth, the design of his journey was understood to be to meet his colleague, Governor Davy, at the seat of the Government, where they would be at the fountain head of information, and would obtain any lights or explanations which they might suppose useful. This was manifestly a very natural and innocent solution of the Chief Justice’s visit, and I believe the true one.  
Yet these simple occurrences were to the jealous mind of Mr. Adams, “confirmations strong,” of some mischievous plot against his independence.  
The circumstance, which next presents itself to examination, is the dismission of the two Secretaries, Pickering and M’Henry. This circumstance, it is known, occasioned much surprise, and a strong sensation to the disadvantage of Mr. Adams.  
It happened at a peculiar juncture, immediately after the unfavorable turn of the election in New-York, and had much the air of an explosion of combustible materials which had been long prepared, but which had been kept down by prudential calculations respecting the effect of an explosion upon the friends of those Ministers in the State of New-York. Perhaps, when it was supposed that nothing could be lost in this quarter, and that something might be gained elsewhere by an atoning sacrifice of those Ministers, especially Mr. Pickering, who had been for some time particularly odious to the opposition party, it was determined to proceed to extremities. This, as a mere conjecture, is offered for as much as it may be worth.  
One fact, however, is understood to be admitted, namely, that neither of the dismissed Ministers had given any new or recent cause for their dismission.  
A primary cause of the state of things which led to this event, is to be traced to the ungovernable temper of Mr. Adams. It is a fact that he is often liable to paroxisms of anger, which deprive him of self command, and produce very outrageous behaviour to those who approach him. Most, if not all his Ministers, and several distinguished Members of the two Houses of Congress, have been humiliated by the effects of these gusts of passion.  
This violence, and the little consideration for them which was implied in declining to consult them, had occasioned great dryness between the President and his Ministers, except, I believe, the Secretary of the Navy.  
The neglect was of course most poignant to Mr. Pickering, because it had repeatedly operated in matters appertaining to his office. Nor was it in the disposition of this respectable man, justly tenacious of his own dignity and independence, to practise condescentions towards an imperious chief. Hence the breach constantly grew wider and wider, till a separation took place.  
The manner of the dismission was abrupt and uncourteous; illsuited to a man, who, in different stations, had merited so much from his country.  
Admitting that when the President and his Minister had gotten into a situation thus unpleasant, a separation was unavoidable; still, as there was no surmise of misconduct, the case required a frank politeness, not an uncouth austerity.  
But the remark most interesting in this particular, to the character of the President, is, that it was by his own fault that he was brought into a situation which might oblige him to displace a Minister, whose moral worth has his own suffrage, and whose abilities and services have that of the public.  
The dismission of this Minister was preceded by a very curious circumstance. It was, without doubt, announced as a thing shortly to happen in an opposition circle, before any friend of the Government had the slightest suspicion of it. This circumstance, taken in connection with the period at which it happened, naturally provokes the conjecture that there may have been some collateral inducements to the step.  
The dismission of the Secretary at War took place about the same time. It was declared in the sequel of a long conversation between the President and him, of a nature to excite alternately pain and laughter; pain, for the weak and excessive indiscretions of a Chief Magistrate of the United States; laughter at the ludicrous topics which constituted charges against this officer.  
A prominent charge was, that the Secretary, in a Report to the House of Representatives, had eulogized General Washington, and had attempted to eulogize General Hamilton, which was adduced as one proof of a combination, in which the Secretary was engaged, to depreciate and injure him, the President.  
Wonderful! passing Wonderful! that an Eulogy of the dead patriot and hero, of the admired and beloved Washington, consecrated in the affections and reverence of his country, should, in any shape, be irksome to the ears of his successor!  
Singular, also, that an encomium on the officer, first in rank in the armies of the United States, appointed and continued by Mr. Adams, should in his eyes have been a crime in the head of the War Department, and that it should be necessary, in order to avert his displeasure, to obliterate a compliment to that officer from an official Report.  
Another principal topic of accusation was, that the Secretary had, with the other Ministers, signed the joint letter, which had been addressed to the President respecting a suspension of the Mission to France. It was ostentatiously asked, how he or they should pretend to know any thing of diplomatic affairs; and it was plainly intimated that it was presumption in them to have intermeddled in such affairs.  
A variety of things equally frivolous and outré passed. By way of episode, it fell to my lot to be distinguished by a torrent of gross personal abuse; and I was accused of having contributed to the loss of the election in New-York, out of ill will to Mr. Adams: a notable expedient truly for giving vent to my ill will. Who is so blind as not to see, that if actuated by such a motive, I should have preferred by the success of the election, to have secured the choice of electors for the State of New-York, who would have been likely to cooperate in the views by which I was governed?  
To those who have not had opportunities of closely inspecting the weaknesses of Mr. Adams’s character, the details of this extraordinary interview would appear incredible; but to those who have had these opportunities, they would not even furnish an occasion of surprise. But they would be, to all who knew their truth, irrefragable proofs of his unfitness for the station of Chief Magistrate.  
Ill treatment of Mr. M’Henry cannot fail to awaken the sympathy of every person well acquainted with him. Sensible, judicious, well-informed, of an integrity never questioned, of a temper, which, though firm in the support of principles, has too much moderation and amenity to offend by the manner of doing it—I dare pronounce that he never gave Mr. Adams cause to treat him, as he did, with unkindness. If Mr. Adams thought that his execution of his office indicated a want of the peculiar qualifications required for it, he might have said so with gentleness, and he would have only exercised a prerogative entrusted to him by the Constitution, to which no blame could have attached; but it was unjustifiable to aggravate the deprivation of office by humiliating censures and bitter reproaches.  
  
The last material occurrence in the administration of Mr. Adams, of which I shall take notice, is the pardon of Fries, and other principals in the late insurrection in Pennsylvania.  
It is a fact that a very refractory spirit has long existed in the Western Counties of that State. Repeatedly have its own laws been opposed with violence, and as often, according to my information, with impunity.  
It is also a fact, which every body knows, that the laws of the Union, in the vital article of revenue, have been twice resisted in the same State by combinations so extensive, and under circumstances so violent, as to have called for the employment of military force; once under the former President, and once under the actual President; which together cost the United States nearly a million and a half of dollars  
In the first instance it happened, that by the early submission of most of the leaders, upon an invitation of the government, few offenders of any consequence remained subject to prosecution. Of these, either from the humanity of the juries or some deficiency in the evidence, not one was capitally convicted. Two poor wretches only were sentenced to die, one of them little short of an ideot, the other a miserable follower in the hindmost train of rebellion, both beings so insignificant in all respects, that after the lenity shewn to the chiefs, justice would have worn the mien of ferocity, if she had raised her arm against them. The sentiment that their punishment ought to be remitted was universal; and the President, yielding to the special considerations, granted them pardons.  
In the last instance, some of the most important of the offenders were capitally convicted—one of them by the verdicts of two successive juries. The general opinion of the friends of the Government demanded an example, as indispensable to its security.  
The opinion was well founded. Two insurrections in the same State, the one upon the heels of the other, demonstrated a spirit of insubordination or disaffection which required a strong corrective. It is a disagreeable fact, forming a weighty argument in the question, that a large part of the population of Pennsylvania is of a composition which peculiarly fits it for the intrigues of factious men, who may desire to disturb or overthrow the Government. And it is an equally disagreeable fact, that disaffection to the national Government is in no other State more general, more deeply rooted, or more envenomed.  
The late Governor Mifflin himself informed me that in the first case, insurrection had been organized down to the very liberties of Philadelphia, and that had not the Government anticipated it, a general explosion would speedily have ensued.  
It ought to be added, that the impunity, so often experienced, had made it an article in the creed of those who were actuated by the insurgent spirit, that neither the General nor the State Government dared to inflict capital punishment.  
To destroy this persuasion, to repress this dangerous spirit, it was essential that a salutary rigor should have been exerted, and that those who were under the influence of the one and the other should be taught that they were the dupes of a fatal illusion.  
Of this, Mr. Adams appeared so sensible, that while the trials were pending, he more than once imprudently threw out, that the accused must found their hopes of escape either in their innocence or in the lenity of the juries; since from him, in case of conviction, they would have nothing to expect. And a very short time before he pardoned them, he declared (b) with no small ostentation, that the mistaken clemency of Washington on the former occasion, had been the cause of the second insurrection, and that he would take care there should not be a third, by giving the laws their full course against the convicted offenders.  
Yet he thought proper, as if distrusting the courts and officers of the United States, to resort through the Attorney-General to the counsel of the culprits, for a statement of their cases; (c) in which was found, besides some objections of form, the novel doctrine, disavowed by every page of our law books, that treason does not consist of resistance by force to a public law; unless it be an act relative to the militia, or other military force.  
And upon this, or upon some other ground, not easy to be comprehended, he of a sudden departed from all his former declarations, and against the unanimous advice of his Ministers, with the Attorney General, came to the resolution, which he executed, of pardoning all those who had received sentence of death.  
No wonder that the public was thunderstruck at such a result—that the friends of the Government regarded it as a virtual deriliction—it was impossible to commit a greater error. The particular situation of Pennsylvania, the singular posture of human affairs, in which there is so strong a tendency to the disorganization of Government—the turbulent and malignant humors which exist, and are so industriously nourished throughout the United States; every thing loudly demanded that the Executive should have acted with exemplary vigor, and should have given a striking demonstration, that condign punishment would be the lot of the violent opposers of the laws.  
The contrary course, which was pursued, is the most inexplicable part of Mr. Adams’s conduct. It shews him so much at variance with himself, as well as with sound policy, that we are driven to seek a solution for it in some system of concession to his political enemies; a system the most fatal for himself, and for the cause of public order, of any that he could possibly devise. It is by temporisings like these, that men at the head of affairs, lose the respect both of friends and foes—it is by temporisings like these, that in times of fermentation and commotion, Governments are prostrated, which might easily have been upheld by an erect and imposing attitude.  
I have now gone through the principal circumstances in Mr. Adams’s conduct, which have served to produce my disapprobation of him as Chief Magistrate. I pledge my veracity and honor, that I have stated none which are not either derived from my own knowledge, or from sources of information, in the highest degree, worthy of credit.  
I freely submit it, Sir, to your judgment, whether the grounds of the opinion I have expressed, are not weighty; and whether they are not sufficient to exculpate those Federalists, who favor the equal support of Mr. Pinckney, from all blame, and myself in particular, from the unworthy imputation of being influenced by private resentment.  
At the same time, I will admit, though it should detract from the force of my representations, that I have causes of personal dissatisfaction with Mr. Adams. It is not my practice to trouble others with my individual concerns; nor should I do it at present, but for the suggestions which have been made. Even with this incentive, I shall do it as little as possible.  
The circumstances of my late military situation, have much less to do with my personal discontent than some others. In respect to them, I shall only say, that I owed my appointment to the station and rank I held, to the express stipulation of General Washington, when he accepted the command of the Army, afterwards peremptorily insisted upon by him, in opposition to the strong wishes of the President; and that, though second in rank, I was not promoted to the first place, when it became vacant, by the death of the Commander in Chief. As to the former, I should have had no cause to complain, if there had not been an apparent inconsistency in the measures of the President; if he had not nominated me first on the list of Major Generals, and attempted afterwards to place me third in rank. As to the latter, the Chief Command, not being a matter of routine, the not promoting me to it, cannot be deemed a wrong or injury; yet certainly I could not see, in the omission, any proof of good will or confidence—or of a disposition to console me for the persecutions which I had incessantly endured. But I dismiss the subject, leaving to others to judge of my pretensions to the promotion, and of the weight, if any, which they ought to have had with the President.  
On other topics, my sensations are far less neutral. If, as I have been assured from respectable authorities, Mr. Adams has repeatedly indulged himself in virulent and indecent abuse of me; if he has denominated me a man destitute of every moral principle; if he has stigmatised me as the leader of a British Faction; then certainly I have right to think that I have been most cruelly and wickedly traduced; then have I right to appeal to all those who have been spectators of my public actions; to all who are acquainted with my private character, in its various relations, whether such treatment of me, by Mr. Adams, is of a nature to weaken or to strengthen his claim to the approbation of wise and good men; then will I so far yield to the consciousness of what I am, as to declare, that in the cardinal points of public and private rectitude, above all, in pure and disinterested zeal for the interests and service of this country—I shrink not from a comparison with any arrogant pretender to superior and exclusive merit.  
Having been repeatedly informed, that Mr. Adams had delineated me as the leader of a British Faction, and having understood that his partisans, to counteract the influence of my opinion, were pressing the same charge against me, I wrote him a letter on the subject, dated the first of August last. No reply having been given by him to this letter, I, on the first of the present month, wrote him another; of both which letters I send you copies.  
Of the purity of my public conduct in this, as in other particulars, I may defy the severest investigation.  
Not only is it impossible for any man to give color to this absurd charge, by a particle of proof, or by any reasonable presumption; but I am able to shew, that my conduct has uniformly given the lie to it.  
I never advised any connection  
I mean a lasting connection. From what I recollect of the train of my ideas, it is possible I may at some time have suggested a temporary connection for the purpose of co-operating against France in the event of a definitive rupture; but of this I am not certain, as I well remember that the expediency of the measure was always problematical in my mind, and that I have occasionally discouraged it.  
with Great-Britain, other than a commercial one; and in this I never advocated the giving to her any privilege or advantage which was not to be imparted to other nations. With regard to her pretensions as a belligerent power in relation to neutrals, my opinions, while in the Administration, to the best of my recollection, coincided with those of Mr. Jefferson. When in the year 1793, her depredations on our commerce discovered a hostile spirit, I recommended one definitive effort to terminate differences by negociation, to be followed, if unsuccessful, by a declaration of war. I urged, in the most earnest manner, the friends of the Administration, in both houses of Congress, to prepare by sea and land for the alternative, to the utmost extent of our resources; and to an extent far exceeding what any member of either party was found willing to go. For this alternative, I became so firmly pledged to the friends and enemies of the Administration, and especially to the President of the United States, in writing as well as verbally, that I could not afterwards have retracted without a glaring and disgraceful inconsistency. And being thus pledged, I explicitly gave it as my opinion to Mr. Jay, Envoy to Great-Britain, that “unless an adjustment of the differences with her could be effected on solid terms, it would be better to do nothing.” When the treaty arrived, it was not without full deliberation and some hesitation, that I resolved to support it. The articles relative to the settlement of differences were upon the whole satisfactory; but there were a few of the others which appeared to me of a different character. The article respecting contraband, though conformable with the general law of nations, was not in all its features such as could have been wished. The XXVth article, which gave asylum in our ports, under certain exceptions, to privateers with their prizes, was in itself an ineligible one, being of a nature to excite the discontent of nations against whom it should operate, and deriving its justification from the example before set of an equivalent stipulation in our Treaty with France. The XIIth article, was in my view inadmissible. The enlightened negociator, not unconscious that some parts of the Treaty were less well arranged than was to be desired, had himself hesitated to sign: but he had resigned his scruples to the conviction that nothing better could be effected, and that aggregately considered, the instrument would be advantageous to the United States. On my part, the result of mature reflection was, that as the subjects of controversy which had threatened the peace of the two nations, and which implicated great interests of this country, were in the essential points well adjusted, and as the other articles would expire in twelve years after the ratification of the Treaty, it would be wise and right to confirm the compact, with the exception of the XIIth article. Nevertheless, when an account was received that the British cruizers had seized provisions going to ports of the French dominions, not in fact blockaded or besieged, I advised the President to ratify the Treaty conditionally only, that is, with express instructions not to exchange ratifications, unless the British Government would disavow a construction of the instrument authorising the practice and would discontinue it.  
After the rejection of Mr. Pinckney by the Government of France, immediately after the installment of Mr. Adams as President, and long before the measure was taken, I urged a member of Congress, then high in the confidence of the President, to propose to him the immediate appointment of three Commissioners, of whom Mr. Jefferson, or Mr. Madison to be one, to make another attempt to negociate. And when afterwards Commissioners were appointed, I expressly gave it as my opinion, that indemnification for spoliations, should not be a sine qua non of accommodation. In fine, I have been disposed to go greater lengths to avoid rupture with France than with Great-Britain; to make greater sacrifices for reconciliation with the former than with the latter.  
In making this avowal, I owe it to my own character to say, that the disposition I have confessed, did not proceed from predilection for France (revolutionary France, after her early beginnings, has been always to me an object of horror) nor from the supposition that more was to be feared from France, as an enemy, than from Great-Britain, (I thought that the maritime power of the latter, could do us most mischief) but from the persuasion that the sentiments and prejudices of our country, would render war with France a more unmanageable business, than war with Great Britain.  
Let any fair man pronounce, whether the circumstances which have been disclosed, bespeak the partisan of Great-Britain, or the man exclusively devoted to the interests of this country. Let any delicate man decide, whether it must not be shocking to an ingenuous mind, to have to combat a slander so vile, after having sacrificed the interests of his family, and devoted the best part of his life to the service of that country, in counsel and in the field.  
It is time to conclude—The statement, which has been made, shews that Mr. Adams has committed some positive and serious errors of Administration; that in addition to these, he has certain fixed points of character which tend naturally to the detriment of any cause of which he is the chief, of any Administration of which he is the head; that by his ill humors and jealousies he has already divided and distracted the supporters of the Government; that he has furnished deadly weapons to its enemies by unfounded accusations, and has weakened the force of its friends by decrying some of the most influential of them to the utmost of his power; and let it be added, as the necessary effect of such conduct, that he has made great progress in undermining the ground which was gained for the government by his predecessor, and that there is real cause to apprehend, it might totter, if not fall, under his future auspices. A new government, constructed on free principles, is always weak, and must stand in need of the props of a firm and good administration; till time shall have rendered its authority venerable, and fortified it by habits of obedience.  
Yet with this opinion of Mr. Adams, I have finally resolved not to advise the withholding from him a single vote. The body of Federalists, for want of sufficient knowledge of facts, are not convinced of the expediency of relinquishing him. It is even apparent, that a large proportion still retain the attachment which was once a common sentiment. Those of them, therefore, who are dissatisfied, as far as my information goes, are, generally speaking, willing to forbear opposition, and to acquiesce in the equal support of Mr. Adams with Mr. Pinckney, whom they prefer. Have they not a claim to equal deference from those who continue attached to the former? Ought not these, in candor, to admit the possibility that the friends who differ from them, act not only from pure motives, but from cogent reasons? Ought they not, by a co-operation in General Pinckney, to give a chance for what will be a safe issue, supposing that they are right in their preference, and the best issue, should they happen to be mistaken? Especially, since by doing this, they will increase the probability of excluding a third candidate, of whose unfitness all sincere federalists are convinced. If they do not pursue this course, they will certainly incur an immense responsibility to their friends and to the Government.  
To promote this co-operation, to defend my own character, to vindicate those friends, who with myself have been unkindly aspersed, are the inducements for writing this letter. Accordingly, it will be my endeavor to regulate the communication of it in such a manner as will not be likely to deprive Mr. Adams of a single vote. Indeed, it is much my wish that its circulation could forever be confined within narrow limits. I am sensible of the inconveniences of giving publicity to a similar developement of the character of the Chief Magistrate of our country; and I lament the necessity of taking a step which will involve that result. Yet to suppress truths, the disclosure of which is so interesting to the public welfare as well as to the vindication of my friends and myself, did not appear to me justifiable.  
The restraints, to which I submit, are a proof of my disposition to sacrifice to the prepossessions of those, with whom I have heretofore thought and acted, and from whom in the present question I am compelled to differ. To refrain from a decided opposition to Mr. Adams’s re-election has been reluctantly sanctioned by my judgment; which has been not a little perplexed between the unqualified conviction of his unfitness for the station contemplated, and a sense of the great importance of cultivating harmony among the supporters of the Government; on whose firm union hereafter will probably depend the preservation of order, tranquillity, liberty, property; the security of every social and domestic blessing.

SIR,  
  
Sons of the warm personal friends of Mr. Apams  
are taking unwearied pains to disparage the motives of those  
Federalists, who advocate the equal support of Gen. Pixcx-  
NEY, at the approaching election of President and Vice-  
President. They are exhibited under a variety of aspects  
equally derogatory. Sometimes they are versatile, factious  
Spirits, who cannot be long satisſied with any chief, however  
meritorious :—Sometimes they are ambitious spirits, who  
can be contented with no man that will not submit to be go-  
verned by them :—Sometimes they are intriguing partisans  
of Great-Britain, who, devoted to the advancement of her  
views, are incensed against Mr. Abus for the independent  
impartiality of his conduct.  
  
Ix addition to a full share of the obloquy vented against  
this description of persons collectively, peculiar accusations  
have been devised, to swell the catalogue of my demerits.  
Among these, the resentment of disappointed ambition,  
forms a prominent feature. It is pretended, that had the  
President, upon the demise of General W AasHINGTON, ap-  
pointed me Commander in Chief, he would have been, in  
my estimation, all that is wise, and good and great.  
  
Ir is necessary, for the public cause, to repel these slan-  
ders; by stating the real views of the persons who are calum-  
niated, and the reasons of their conduct.  
  
Ix executing this task, with particular reference to my-  
self, I ought to premise, that the ground upon which I stand,  
1s  
  
  
is different from that of most of those who are confounded  
with me as in pursuit of the same plan. While our object  
is common, our motives are variously dissimilar. A part,  
well affected to Mr. Apans, have no other wish than to take  
a double chance against Mr. JzrrERsON. Another part,  
feeling a diminution of confidence in him, still hope that  
the general tenor of his conduct will be essentially right.  
Few go as far in their objections as I do. - Not de-  
nying to Mr. Apans patriotism and integrity, and even ta-  
lents of a certain kind, I should be deficient in candor, were  
I to conceal the conviction, that he does not possess the ta-  
lents adapted to the Administration of Government, and that  
there are great and intrinsic defects in his character, which  
unfit him for the office of Chief Magistrate.  
  
To give a correct idea of the circumstances which have  
gradually produced this conviction, it may be useful to re-  
trospect to an early period,  
  
I was one of that numerous. class who had conceived a  
high veneration for Mr. Apams, on account of the part he  
acted in the first stages of our revolution. My imagination  
had exalted him to a high eminence, as a man of patriotic,  
bold, profound, and comprehensive mind. But in the progress  
of the war, opmions were ascribed to him, which brought  
into question, with me, the solidity of his understanding.  
He was represented to be of the number of those who fa-  
vored the enlistment of our troops annually, or for short  
periods, rather than for the term of the war; a blind and  
infatuated policy, directly contrary to the urgent recom-  
mendation of General W asninGTox, and which had nearly  
proved the ruin of our cause. He was also said to have  
advocated the project of appointing yearly a new Command-  
er of the Army; a project which, in any service, is likely to  
be attended with more evils than benefits ; but which, in

ours, at the period in question, was chimerical, from the  
want-of persons qualified to succeed, and pernicious, from  
the peculiar fitness of the officer first appointed, to strength-  
en, by personal influence, the too feeble cords which bound  
to the service, an ill-paid, ill- clothed, and undisciplined sol-  
diery. :  
  
IT is impossible for. me to assert, at this distant day, that  
these suggestions were brought home to Mr. Apams in  
such a manner as to ascertain their genuineness ; but I dis-  
tinctly remember their existence, and my conclusion from  
them; which was, that, if true, they proved this gentleman  
to be infected with some visionary notions, and that he was  
far less able in the practice, than in the theory, of politics.  
I remember also, that they had the effect of inducing me to  
qualify the admiration which I had once entertained for  
him, and to-reserve for opportunities of future scrutiny, a  
definitive opinion of the true standard of his character.  
  
Ix this disposition I was, when just before the close of  
the war, I became a member of Congress.  
  
Tux situation in which I found myself there, was far  
from- being inauspicious to a favorable estimate of &#x27; Mr.  
ADans. t f e  
  
Urox my first going into Congress, I discovered symp-  
toms of a party already formed, too well disposed to subject  
the interests of the United States to the management of  
France. Though I felt, in common with those who had  
participated in our Revolution, a lively sentiment of good  
will towards a power, whose co-operation, however it was  
and ought to have been dictated by its own interest, had  
been extremely useful to us, and had been afforded in a kbe-  
ral and handsome manner; yet, tenacious of the real inde-  
  
pendence  
  
6  
  
pendence of our country, and dreading the preponderance  
of foreign influence, as the natural disease of popular gov-  
ernment, I was struck with disgust at the appearance, in the  
very cradle of our Republic; of a party actuated by an undue  
complaisance to foreign power; and I resolved at once to  
resist this bias in our affairs: a resolution, which has-been  
the chief cause of the persecution I have endured in the  
subsequent stages of my political life.  
  
Aux the fruits of the bias I have mentioned, were the  
  
celebrated instructions to our Commissioners, tor treating  
of peace with Great-Britain ; which, not only as to- final  
measures, but also as to preliminary and intermediate  
negociations, placed them in a state of dependence on the  
French ministry, humiliating to themselves, and unsafe for  
the interests of the country. This was the more exception-  
able, as there was cause to suspect, that in regard to the two  
cardinal points of the fisheries and the navigation of the  
Missisippi, the policy of the cabinet of Versailles did not  
accord with the wishes of the United States.  
  
Tre Commissioners, of whom Mr. Apams was one,  
had the fortitude to break through the fetters which were  
laid upon them by those instructions; and there is reason to  
believe, that by doing it, they both accelerated the peace  
with Great-Britain, and improved the terms, while they  
preserved our faith with France.  
  
YET a serious attempt was made to obtain from Congress  
a formal censure of their conduct. The attempt failed, and  
instead of censure, the praise was bestowed which was  
justly due to the accomplishment of a treaty advantageous  
to this country, beyond the most sanguine expectation. In  
this result, my efforts were heartily united,  
  
Tun  
  
7  
  
Tux principal merit of the negociation with Great-Bri-  
tain, in some quarters, has been bestowed upon Mr. Ap Aus;  
but it is certainly the right of Mr. Jay, who took a lead in  
the several steps of the transaction, no less honorable to  
his talents than to his firmness. The merit, nevertheless,  
of a full and decisive co-operation, is justly due to Mr.  
ADAMS.  
  
II will readily be seen, that such a course of things was  
  
calculated to impress me with a disposition friendly to Mr.  
Apaus. I certainly felt it, and gave him much of my con-  
sideration and esteem.  
  
Bor this did not hinder me from making careful obser-  
vations upon his several communications, and endeavoring  
to derive from them an accurate idea of his talents and cha-  
racter. This scrutiny enhanced my esteem in the main for  
his moral qualifications, but lessened my respect for his in-  
tellectual endowments. I then adopted an opinion, which  
all my subsequent experience has confirmed, that he is a  
man of an imagination sublimated and eccentric ; propitious  
neither to the regular display of sound judgment, nor to  
steady perseverance in a systematic plan of conduct; and I  
began to perceive what has been since too manifest, that to  
this defect are added the unfortunate foibles of a vanity  
without baunds, and a jealousy capable of discoloring every  
object, |  
  
STRONG evidence of some traits of this character, is to  
be found in a Journal of Mr. Apans, which was sent by the  
then Secretary of Foreign Affairs to Congress. The reading  
of this Journal, extremely embarrassed his friends, espe-  
cially the delegates of Massachusetts; who, more than  
once, interrupted it, and at last, succeeded in putting a stop  
to it, on the suggestion that it bore the marks of a private  
  
and  
  
8  
  
and confidential paper, which, by some mistake, had gotten  
into its present situation, and never could have been de-  
signed as a public document for the inspection of Congress.  
The good humor of that body yielded to the suggestion.  
  
Tux particulars of this Journal cannot be expected to  
have remained in my memory—but I recollect one which  
may serve as a sample. Being among the guests invited to  
dine with the Count de Vergennes, Minister for Foreign  
Affairs, Mr. Abus thought fit to give a specimen of Ame-  
rican politeness, by conducting Madame de Vergennes to  
dinner ; in the way, she was pleased to make retribution in  
the current coin of French politeness—by saying to him,  
« Monsieur Adams, vous etes le WASHINGTON de negocia-  
tion. Stating the incident, he makes this comment up-  
on it: These people have à very pretty knack of paying  
„compliments.“ He might have added, they have also a  
very dexterous knack of disguising a sarcam. 12  
  
Tux opinion, however, which I have ed, did not pre-  
vent my entering cordially into the plan of supporting Mr,  
Abus for the office of Vice-President, under the new  
Constitution. I still thought that he had high claims upon  
the public gratitude, and possessed a substantial worth of  
character, which might atone for some great defects. In  
addition to this, it was well known, that he was a favorite of  
New-England, and it was obvious that his union with Ge-  
neral W AasHINGToN would tend to give the government, in  
Its outset, all the strength which it could derive from the  
character of the two of me es.  
  
Bur it was deemed an essential point of caution to take  
care, that accident or an intrigue of the opposers of the Go»  
vernment, should not raise Mr. Abus, instead of General

WASHINGTON, to the first place. This, every friend of the  
Government would have considered as a disastrous event;  
as well because it would have displayed a capricious opera-  
tion of the system in elevating to the first station, a man in-  
tended for the second; as because it was conceived that the  
incomparably superior weight and transcendant popularity of  
Gen. WASHINGTON, rendered his presence at the head of the  
Government, in its first organization, a matter of primary  
and indispensable importance. It was therefore agreed  
that a few votes should be diverted from Mr. Apans to  
  
other persons, so as to insure to General W AsHINGTON a  
plurality.  
  
GREAT was my astonishment, and equally great my re-  
gret, when, afterwards, I learned from persons of unques-  
tionable veracity, that Mr. Apams had complained of un-  
fair treatment, in not having been permitted to take an equal  
chance with General WAsH1nGTox, by leaving the votes to  
an uninfluenced current.  
  
Px extreme egotism of the temper, which could blind  
a man to considerations so obvious as those that had recom-  
mended the course pursued, cannot be enforced by my com-  
ment. It exceeded all that I had imagined, and shewed, in  
too strong a light, that the vanity which I have ascribed to  
him, existed to a degree that rendered it more than a harm.  
less foible. 4 hl  
  
Mn. Apaus was elected Vice-President. His public  
conduct, in that station, was satisfactory to the friends of  
the Government, though they were now and then alarmed  
g * appearances of some eccentric ann  
  
a Ir is, in particular, 2- tribute due f from me, to Wenn  
ledge, that Mr. Apans, being in quality of Vice-President,  
ex Mois, one of the Trustees of the Sinking Fund, I ex-  
  
n perienced  
  
- — - — — —  
- » *  
  
  
perienced from him the most complete support; which was  
the more gratifying to me, as I had to struggle against the  
systematic opposition of Mr. IETTERSON, seconded occa-  
  
  
compliment to Mr. ApAus, not to presume that the sup-  
port which he gave me, was the dictate of his sense of the  
public interest; yet, so cordial and useful a co-operation, at  
a moment when I was assailed with all the weapons of par-  
ty rancor, won from me an unſeigned return of the most  
amicable sentiments. |  
  
I LosT no opportunity of combating the prejudices mdus-  
triously propagated against him by his political enemies ;  
and, for a considerable time, went quite as far as candor  
would permit, to extenuate the failings which more and  
more alarmed and dissatisfied his friends.  
  
Tux epoch at length arrived, whens#the retreat of Gene-  
ral WASHINGTON made it necessary to fix upon a successor.  
By this time, men of principal influence in the Federal Par-  
ty, whose situation had led them to an intimate acquaint-  
ance with Mr. Apans&#x27;s character, began to entertain seri-  
ous doubts about his fitness for the station; yet, his pre-  
tensions, in several respects, were so strong, that after ma-  
ture reflection, they thought it better to indulge their hopes  
than to listen to their fears. To this conclusion, the desire  
of preserving harmony in the Federal Party, was a weighty  
inducement. Accordingly it was determined to support  
Mr. Apans for the Chief Magistracy.  
  
  
  
  
11  
his morals, and the soundness and correctness of his under-  
standing, accompanied by a habitual discretion and selt-  
command, which has often occasioned a parallel to be drawn  
between him and the venerated WAs HIx TONY. In addition  
to these recommendations, he had been, during a critical pe-  
riod, our Minister at the Court of London, and recently En-  
  
voy Extraordinary-to the Court of Spain; and in both these  
trusts, he had acquitted himself to the satisfaction of all par-  
  
  
which removed all the thorny subjects of contention, that  
had so long threatened the peace of the two countries, and  
stipulated for the United States, on their Southern frontier,  
and on the Missisippi, advantages of real magnitude and im-  
portance.  
  
WELL-INFORMED men knew that the event of the Elec-  
tion was extremely problematical; and, while the friends of  
Mr. JEFFERSON predicted his success with sanguine conh-  
dence, his opposers feared that he might have at least an  
equal chance with any Federal Candidate.  
  
To exclude him, was deemed, by the Federalists, a pri-  
mary object. Those of them who possessed the best means  
of judging, were of opinion that it was far less important,  
whether Mr. Apams or Mr. Pixcxxxy was the successful  
Candidate, than that Mr. JerreRsoN should not be the per-  
  
  
that the two first mentioned gentlemen should be equally  
supported; leaving to casual accessions of votes in favor of  
the one or the other, to turn the scale between them.  
  
Ix this plan I united with good faith; in the resolution,  
to which I scrupulously adhered, of giving to each Candidate  
an equal support. This was done, wherever my influence  
extended ; as was more particularly manifested in the State  
of N ew-York, where all the Electors were my warm per-  
  
Sonal  
  
12  
  
sonal or political friends, and all gave a concurrent vote for  
the two Federal Candidates,  
  
Ir is true that a faithful execution of this plan would have  
given Mr. PINCKNEY a somewhat better chance than Mr.  
Apams; nor shall it be concealed, that an issue favor-  
able to the ſormer would not have been disagreeable to me;  
as indeed I declared at the time, in the circles of my confiden-  
tial friends, * My position was, that if chance shauld. de-  
cide in favor of Mr. Pixncxxey, it probably would not be a  
misfortune ; since he, to every essential qualification for the  
office, added a temper far more discreet and conciliatory  
than that of Mr. Apas.  
  
Tr1s disposition, on my part, at that juncture, proves,  
at least, that my_disapprobation of Mr. ADans has not ori-  
ginated in the disappointment, to which it has been uncan-  
didly attributed. No private motive could then have.en-  
tered into it. Not the least collision or misunderstanding  
had ever happened between that gentleman and myself on  
  
the contrary, as I have already stated, I had reason indivi-  
dually to be pleased with him.  
  
No: The considerations which had reconciled me to the  
success of Mr. Pixcxxxx, were of a nature exclusively pub.  
lic. They resulted from the disgusting egotism, the dis-  
tempered jealousy, and the ungovernable indiscretion of Mr.  
Apams&#x27;s temper, joined to some doubts of the correctness  
of his maxims of Administration. Though in matters of  
Finance he had acted with the Federal Party ; yet he had,  
more than once, broached theories at variance with his prac-  
tice. And in conversation, he repeatedly made excursions  
in the field of foreign politics, which alarmed the friends  
of the prevailing system.

Tux plan of giving equal support to the two Federal Can-  
didates, was not pursued. Personal attachment for Mr.  
Apans, especially in the New- England States, caused a  
number of the votes to be withheld from Mr. Pixncxner,  
and tlirown away. The result was, that Mr. ApAus was  
elected President by a majority of two votes, and Mr. Jxr-  
FERSON Vice-President.  
  
Tr1s issue demonstrated the wisdom of the plan which  
had-been abandoned, and how greatly, in departing from it,  
the eause had been sacrificed to the man. But for a sort of  
miracle, the departure would have made Mr. IXTIERSOx  
President. In each of the States of Pennsylvania, Virginia  
and North-Carolina, Mr. ADams had one vote. In the two  
latter States, the one vote was as much against the stream of  
popular prejudice, as it was against the opinions of the other  
Electors. The firmness of the individuals who separated  
from their colleagues, was so extraordinary, as to have been  
contrary to all probable calculation. Had only one of them  
thrown his vote into the other scale, there would have been  
an equality, and no election. Had two done it, the choice,  
would have fallen upon Mr. JzrFERSOKX.  
  
No one, sincere in the opinion that this gentleman was  
an ineligible and dangerous Candidate, can hesitate in pro-  
nouncing, that in dropping Mr. Pixcxxzxy, too much was  
put at hazard ; and that those who promoted the other course,  
acted with prudence and propriety.  
  
Ir is a fact, which ought not to be forgotten, that Mr.  
ADpams, who had eyinced discontent,. because he had not  
been permitted to take an equal chance with General Wasn-  
INGTON, was enraged with all those who had thought that  
Mr. Pixcxxxy ought to have had an equal chance with him.  
But in this there is perfect consistency. The same turn of  
temper is the solution of the displeasure in both cases.  
  
Tr  
  
14  
  
Ir is to this circumstance of the equal support of Mr.  
  
9  
  
  
ous scism which has since grown up in the Federal Party.  
  
Ms. Apans never could forgive the men who had been  
engaged in the plan; though it embraced some of his most  
partial admirers. He has discovered bitter animosity against  
several of them. Against me, his rage has been so vehement,  
as to have caused him more than once, to forget the deco-  
  
  
lable law. It will not appear an exaggeration to those who  
have studied his character, to suppose that he is capable of  
being alienated from a system to which he has been at-  
tached, because it is upheld by men whom he hates.  
How large a share this may have had in some recent aber-  
rations, cannot easily be determined.  
  
OccUuRRENCES which have either happened or come to  
light since the election of Mr. Apams to the Presidency,  
  
  
ment of his unfitness for the station. &quot;=  
  
Tux letter which has just appeared in the public prints,  
written by him, while Vice-President, to TENCH Coxx, is  
of itself conclusive evidence of the justness of this senti-  
ment. It is impossible to speak of this transaction in terms  
suited to its nature, without losing sight that Mr. Ap Aus is  
President of the United States.  
  
Tus letter avows the sushicion, that the appointment of  
Mr. PiIxckxxxx to the Court of London, had been procured  
or promoted by British Influence. And considering the pa-  
rade with which the story of the Duke of Leeds is told, it is  
fair to consider that circumstance as the principal, if not the  
  
sole, ground of the odious and degrading suspicion.

LeT any man of candor or knowledge of the world, pro-  
nounce on this species of evidence,  
  
IT happened unfortunately for the Prxcxnevs, that, while  
boys, and long before our revolution, they went to school  
with a British Duke, who was afterwards Minister of the  
British Government for the foreign department. This in-  
discreet Duke, perhaps for no better reason than the desire  
of saying something to a parting American Minister, and  
the want of something better to say, divulges to him the  
dangerous secret, that the two PIN cKNEYS had been his  
class- mates, and goes the alarming length of mak ing enquiry  
about their health. From this, it is sagaciously inferred, that  
these gentlemen have“ many poruerſul old friends in England,  
and from this again, that the Duke of Leeds (of course of  
the number of these old friends) had procured by intrigue  
the appointment of one of his class-mates to the Court of  
London ; or, in the language of the letter, that much British  
influence had been exerted in the appointment.  
  
In the school of jealousy, stimulated by ill-will, logic like  
this may pass for substantial; but what is it in the school  
  
of reason and justice?  
  
THrovcn this contaminating connection of the PINcRN EIS  
with the Duke of Leeds, in their juvenile years, did not hin-  
der them from fighting for the independence of their native  
country throughout our revolution; yet the supposition is,  
that the instant the war was terminated, it transformed  
them from the soldiers of liberty into the tools of the Bri-  
  
tich Monarchy. -  
  
Bur the hostility of the Pincxners to Mr. Anas, evi-  
denced by their © long intrigue ” against him, of which he  
Speaks in the letter, is perhaps intended as a still stronger  
  
proof  
  
  
proof of their devotion to Great-Britain—the argument  
may be thus understood. Mr. Apans is the bulwark of  
his country against foreign influence—The batteries of eve-  
ry foreign power, desirous of acquiring an ascendant in our  
affairs, are of consequence always open against him—and,  
the presumption therefore must be, that every citizen who  
is his enemy, is the confederate of one or another of those fo-  
reign powers.  
  
LET us, without contesting this argument of self-love,  
  
examine into the facts upon which its applicability must  
depend.  
  
Tux evidence of “ the long intrigue” seems to be, that  
the family of the Pincxxey&#x27;s contributed to limit the dura-  
tion of Mr. ADpans&#x27;s commission to the Court of London  
to the term of three years, in order to make way for some  
of themselves to succeed him. This, it must be confessed,  
was a long-sighted calculation in a government like ours.  
  
  
on the inference which has been drawn.  
  
Tux resolution of Congress by which Mr. Apams&#x27;s com-  
mission was limited, was a general one, applying to the  
Commissions of all Ministers to foreign Courts. When  
it was proposed and adopted, it is certain that neither of  
the two PIN cRKNRE&#x27;s was a member of Congress; and it is  
believed that they were both at Charleston, in South Caroli-  
na, their usual place of abode, more than eight hundred  
miles distant from the seat of Government.  
  
Bur they had, it seems, a cousn, Mr. CnARLES PI Nck-  
NEY, who was in Congress; and this cousin it was who mov-  
  
ed  
  
17  
  
ed the restrictive resolution. Let us enquire who se conded  
and who voted for it.  
  
Ir was seconded by Mr. HoweLL, a member from Rhode  
Island, the very person who nominated Mr. Adams as Minis-  
ter to Great-Britain, and was voted for by the four Eastern  
States, with New-York, New-Jersey, Maryland and South  
Carolina. Mr. Gerry, always a zealous partisan of Mr.  
ADams, was among the supporters of the resolution. To  
make out this to be a machination of the two PINCKENEYS,  
many things must be affirmed :—First, that their cousin  
CHARLES is always subservient to their views (which  
would equally prove that they have long been, and still are,  
opposers of the Federal Administration:)—Second, that  
  
  
States into his plot, as well as New-York, New-Jersey, Ma-  
ryland, and South-Carolina:— Third, that the PrxNcxxxvs  
could foresee, at the distance of three years, the existence  
of a state of things which would enable them to reap the  
fruit of their contrivance.  
  
Wovlp not the circumstances better warrant the suspi-  
cion that the resolution was a contrivance of the friends of  
Mr. Apaus, to facilitate in some way his election, and  
that Mr. Pixckxrr was their coadjutor, rather than their  
prompter ? 48  
  
Bur the truth most probably is, that the measure was a  
mere precaution to bring under frequent review the propri-  
ety of continuing a Minister at a particular Court, and to  
  
  
harshness of formally displacing him. In a policy of. this  
sort, the cautious maxims of N ew-England would very n na-  
  
  
C ITxIS  
  
  
  
Ir is a fact, that the rigor with which the war was pro-  
gecuted by the British armies in our Southern quarter,  
had produced among the friends of our Revolution there,  
more animosity against the British Government, than in the  
other parts of the United States: and it is a matter of notori-  
ety, in the same quarter, that this disposition was conspi-  
cuous among the PixexNRTS, and their connections. It  
may be added, that they were likewise known to have been  
attached to the French Revolution, and to have continued  
$0, till long after the appointment of Mr. THOMAS Pincx-  
  
EY to the Court of London.  
  
THrrsx propensities of the gentlemen, were certainly not  
such as to make them favorites of Great-Britain, or the ap-  
pointment of one of them to that Court, an object of Parti-  
cular solicitude.  
  
As far as appeared at che time, the idea of nominating  
Mr. TroxAas Pixcxxxv, originated with the then Presi-  
dent himself: but whatever may have been its source, it is  
certain that it met the approbation of the whole Admistra-  
tion, Mr. IETTERSON included. This fact alone, will go  
far to refute the surmise of a British agency in the appoint-  
ment,  
  
Supodtx, that, contrary to all probability, Great-Britain  
had really taken some unaccountable fancy for Mr. Pixex-  
NEY, upon whom was her inſtuence exerted 4 |  
  
Hap the TT circumspect Washington bien ensnar-  
ed in her insidious toils? Had she found means for once  
why 4  
  
19  
  
to soften the stern, inflexible hostility of ITT ERS ox? Had  
RaxDOLPH been won by her meretricious caresses? Had  
Kxox, the uniform friend of Mr, Avans, been corrupted  
by her seducing wiles? Or was it all the dark work of the  
alien Secretary of the Treasury? Was it this arch juggler,  
who debauched the principles, or transformed the prejudi-  
ces, of Mr. Pixcxxey ; who persuaded the British Gove  
ernment to adopt him as a pliant instrument ; who artfully  
induced the President to propose him as of his own  
selection; who lulled the zealous vigilance of JEFFER-  
  
SON and RAanDOLPH, and surprised the ueecng frank -  
ness of Knox ?  
  
Bor when the thing had been accomplished, no matter  
by what means, it was surely to have been expected that  
the man of its choice would have been treated at the Court  
of London with distinguished regard, and that his conduct  
towards that Court would have been marked, if not by some  
improper compliances, at least by some r of e  
er complaisance.  
  
YET, strange as it may appear, upon Mr, Apans&#x27;s hypo-  
thesis, it might be proved, if requisite, that neither the one  
nor the other took place, It might be proved that, far from  
Mr. Pixcxxkr&#x27;s having experienced any flattering distinc-  
tions, incidents not pleasant to his feelings, had occurred,  
and that in the discharge of his official functions, he had ad-  
vanced pretensions in favor of the United States, from  
which, with the approbation of the then Secretary of State,  
Mr. Ixrrxngox, he was instructed to desist,  
  
Wrar will Mr. Apans or his friends reply to all these  
facts? How will he be excused for indulging and declaring,  
on grounds 80 frivolous, a suspicion so derogatory, of a  
man so meritorious—of a man who has acted in a manner s@  
unexceptionable?  
  
Bur

Bur a more serious question remains: How will Mr.  
Ahaus answer to the Government and to his Country, for  
having thus wantonly given the sanction of his opinion to  
the worst of the aspersions which the enemies of the Ad-  
ministration have impudently thrown upon it? Can we be  
surprised that such a torrent of slander was poured out  
against it, when a man, the second in official rank, the se-  
cond in the favor of the friends of the Government, stooped  
to become himself one of its calumniators ?—lt is peculiarly  
unlucky for Mr. Apans in this affair, that he is known to have  
desired, at the time, the appointment which was given to  
Mr. Pincxxney. The President declined the measure,  
thinking that it was compatible neither with the spirit of  
the constitution nor with the dignity of the Government, to  
designate the Vice-President to such a station.  
  
Tuis letter, better than volumes, developes the true, the  
unfortunate character of Mr. Ap As. |  
  
THe remaining causes of dissatisfaction with him respect  
his conduct in the office of President; which, in my opinion,  
has been a heterogeneous compound of right and wrong,  
of wisdom and error. | |  
  
Tu outset was distinguished by a speech which his  
friends lamented as temporising. It had the air of a lure  
for the favor of his opponents at the expense of his since-  
rity ; but being of an equivocal complexion, to which no pre-  
cise design can be annexed, it is barely mentioned as a cir-  
cumstance, which, in conjunction with others of a more po-  
sitive tint, may serve to explain chene. :  
  
IT is in regard to our foreign relations, that the public  
measures of Mr. Apaus first attract criticism. |  
  
Ir  
  
  
Ir will be recollected that General Pixcxxrr, the brother  
of Tons, and the gentleman now supported together with  
Mr. Apans, had been deputed by President WasninGToON,  
as Successor to Mr. Mox ROE, and had been refused to be  
received by the French Government in his quality of Mini-  
ster Plenipotentiary.  
  
THrs, among those of the well-informed, who felt a just  
sensibility for the honor of their country, excited much disgust  
and resentment. But the Opposition-Party, ever too ready  
to justify the French Government at the expense of their  
own, vindicated or apologised for the ill treatment: and the  
mass of the community, though displeased with it, did not  
appear to feel the full force of the indignity.  
  
As a final effort ſor accommodation, and as a mean, in case  
of failure, of enlightening and combining public opinion,  
it was resolved to make another, and a more solemn, expe-  
riment, in the form of a commission of three. |  
  
Tx1s measure (with some objections to the detail)  
was approved by all parties ; by the Antifederalists, be-  
cause they thought no evil so great as the rupture with  
France; by the Federalists, because it was their system to  
avoid war with every power, if it could be done without the  
sacrifice of essential interests or absolute humiliation.  
  
Even such of them who conceived that the insults of the  
French Gov ernment, and the manifestation of its ill will,  
kad already gone far enough to call for measures of vigor ;  
perceiving that the nation was not generally penetrated with  
the same conviction, and would not support with zeal mea-  
sures of. that nature, unless their necessity&#x27; was rendered  
still more apparent, acquiesced in the expediency of another  
mission. They hoped that it would serve either to compose  
  
  
the differences which existed, or to make the necessity of  
resistance to the violence of France, palpable to every good  
feen.  
  
Tux expediency of the step was suggested to Mr. Apans,  
through a Federal channel, a considerable time before he  
determined to take it. He hesitated whether it could be  
done after the rejection of General Pixcxxkx, without na-  
tional debasement. The doubt was an honorable one; it  
was afterwards very properly surrendered to the cogent rea-  
sons which pleaded for a further experiment.  
  
Tus event of this experiment is fresh in our recollection,  
Our Envoys, like our Minister, were rejected. Tribute was  
demanded as a prehminary to negaciation, To their 1m-  
mortal honor, though France at the time was proudly tri-  
umphant, they repelled the disgraceful pretens ion. Ameri»  
cans will neyer forget that General Pixckxky was a mem-⸗  
ber, and an efficient member, of this Commission.  
  
Tuts conduct of the French Government, in which it is  
difficult to say, whether despotic insolence or unblushing  
corruption was most prominent, electrified the American  
people with a becoming indignation, In vain the partisans  
of France attempted to extenuate, The public voice was  
distinct and audible. The nation, disdaining so foul an  
  
overture, was ready to encounter the worst consequences

chat he did all in Kis power to rouse the pride of the na-  
tion—to inspire it with a just sense of the injuries and outra-  
ges which it had experienced, and to dispose it to a firm  
  
and magnanimous resistance ; and that his efforts contribut-  
ed materially to the end.  
  
Tux friends of the Government were not agreed as to  
ulterior measures. Some were for immediate and un-  
qualified war; others for a more mitigated course; the dis-  
solution of treaties, preparation of force by land and sea,  
partial hostilities of a defensive tendency ; leaving to France  
the option of seeking accommodation, or proceeding to  
open war. The latter course prevailed.

Tu latter conduct of the President forms a painful con-  
trast to his commencement. Its effects have been directly  
the reverse. It has sunk the tone of the public rand-—i  
has impaired the confidence of the friends of the Govern-  
ment in the Executive Chief—at has distracted public opiny  
ivn—it has unnerved the public cquncils—it has gown the  
Seeds of discord at home, and lowered the reputation of the  
Government abroad. The circumstances which preceded,  
aggravate the disagrecableness of the results. They prove  
  
that  
  
24  
  
that the injudicious things which have been acted, were not  
  
the effects of any regular plan, but the fortuitous emana-  
tions of momentary impulses.  
  
Tux session, which ensued the promulgation of the dis-  
patches of our Commissioners, was about to commence.  
Mr. Apaus arrived at Philadelphia from his seat at Quin;  
cey. The tone of his mind seemed to have been raised,  
rather than depressed.  
  
Ir was suggested to him, that. it might be expedient to  
insert in his Speech of Congress, a sentimetnt of this import:  
That after the repeatedly rejected advances of this country,  
its dignity required that it should be left with France in fu-  
ture to make the first overture; that if, desirous of reconci-  
liation, she should evince the disposition by sending a Mi-  
nister to this Government, he would be received with the  
respect due to his character, and treated with in the frank-  
ness of a sincere desire of accommodation,  
  
THz suggestion was received in a manner both indignant  
and intemperate.  
  
Mn. Apans declared as a sentiment which he had adopt-  
ed on mature reflection: That if France should send a Mi-  
nister to-morrow, he would order him back the day after.  
  
So imprudent an idea was easily refuted. Little argu.  
ment was requisite to shew that by a similar system of re-  
taliation, when one Government in a particular instance had  
refused the Envoy of another, nations might entail upon each  
  
other perpetual hostility ; mutually barring the avenues of  
explanation;  
  
&quot;In  
  
25  
  
Is less than forty- eight hours from this extraordinary sal-  
ly, the mind of Mr. AD Aus underwent a total revolution  
he resolved not only to insert in his speech the sentiment  
which had been proposed to him, but to go farther, and to  
declare, that if France would giye explicit assurances of re-  
ceiving a Minister from this country, with due respect, he  
would send one.  
  
In vain was this extension of the sentiment opposed by  
all his Ministers, as being equally incompatible with good  
policy, and with the dignity of the nation—he obstinately  
e and the nn, Aeclaion was introduced.  
  
1 GALL it — — it was the zround-work of  
the false steps which have zycceeded.  
  
Tap declaration recommended to the Pregident 1 was a  
Prugemt 0 One.  
  
Tux measures of Congress, by their mitigated form,  
Shewed that an eye had been still kept upon pacification. A  
numerous party were averse from war with France at any  
rate. In the rest of the community, a strong preference of  
honorable accommodation to final rupture was n.  
even amidst the effusions of resentment.  
  
Tux charges which we had exhibited in the face of the  
world against the French Government, were of a high and  
disgraceful complexion ; they had bara urged with mug  
point and emphis.  
  
&#x27;To give an opening to 3 conciliatory pro-  
positions, some salve for her pride was necessary. It was  
also necessary she should be assured that she would not ex-  
* herself to an affront by a refusal to receive the agent  
| D whom  
  
26  
  
whom she might employ for that purpose. The declaration  
proposed fulfilled both objects. 7  
  
Ir was likely to have another important advantage. It  
would be a new proof to the American people of the mode-  
rate and pacific temper of their Government; which would  
tend to preserve their confidence, and to dispose them more  
and more to meet inevitable extremities with fortitude and  
without murmurs.  
  
Bur the supplement to the declaration was a blameable  
excess. It was more than sufficient for the ends to be an-  
swered. It waved the point of honor, which, after two re-  
jections of our Ministers, required that the next Mission  
between the two countries, should proceed from France.  
After the mortifying humiliations we had endured, the na-  
tional dignity demanded that this point should not be de-  
parted from without necessity. No such necessity could  
be pretended to exist: moreover, another mission by us  
would naturally be regarded as evidence of a disposition on  
  
our part to purchase the friendship of revolutionary France,  
even at the expense of honor; an impression which could  
hardly fail to injure our interests with other countries: and  
the measure would involve the further inconvenience of  
transferring the negociation from this country, where our  
government could regulate it according to its own view of  
exigencies, to France, where that advantage would be en-  
zoyed by her Government, and where the power of judging  
for us must be delegated to Commissioners; who, acting  
under immense individual responsibility, at a distance too  
great for consultation, would be apt to act with hesitancy  
and irresolution, whether the policy of the case required  
concession or firmness. This was to place it too much in  
the power of France to manage the progress of the negoci-  
ation according to events.  
  
Ei  
*  
  
Ir  
  
27  
  
-. IT has been said that Paris was wisely preferred as the  
place of negociation, because it served to avoid the cabal-  
lings of a French Minister in this country. But there is  
not enough in this argument to counterbalance the weigh-  
ty considerations on the other side. The intrigues of GE-  
NET and his successors were perplexing to the Government,  
chiefly because they were too well seconded by the prepos-  
sessions of the people. The great alteration in public opin-  
ion, had put it completely in the power of our Executive to  
controul the machinations of any future public Agent of  
France. It ought also to be remembered, that if France  
has not known agents, she never will be without secret ones,  
and that her partisans among our citizens, can much better  
promote her cause, than any Agents she can send. In fact,  
her Agents, by their blunders, were in the event rather use-  
ful than pernicious to our affairs.  
  
Bur is it uren that France would have sent a minister to  
this country? When we find, that from calculations of policy  
she could brook the ignominy which the publication of the  
dispatches of our commissioners was calculated to bring up-  
on her; and stifling her resentment, could invite the renewal  
of negaciation ; what room can there be to doubt, that the  
same calculations would have induced her to send a minister  
to this country when an opening was given for it?  
  
Tux French 8 &quot;EPS relations, through the  
French Diplomatic Agent at the Hague, had opened a com-  
munication with Mr. MuRRAar, our Resident there, for the  
purpose of reviving negociation between the two countries.  
In this manner, assurances were given that France was dispos-  
ed to treat, and that a Minister from us would be received and  
accredited. But they were accompanied with intimations of  
che characters proper to be employed, and who would be  
likely to succeed; which was exceptionable, both as it sav or-  
  
ed  
  
ed of the pretens ion (justly censured by the President him-  
self) of prescribing to other Goyernments how they were to  
manage their own affairs ; and as it might, according to cir-  
cumstances, be construed into a tacit condition of the pro-  
mise to receive a Minister. Overtures so circuitous and in-  
formal, through a person who was not the regular organ of  
the French government for making them, to a person who  
was not the regular organ of the American government for  
receiving them, might be a yery fit mode of preparing the  
way for the like overtures in a more authentic and obligs  
atory shape : But they were a very madequate basis for the  
institution of a new Mission.  
  
Wurx the President pledged himself in his speech to  
send a minister, if satisfactory assurances of a proper recep-  
tion were given, he must have been understood to mean  
such as were direct and official, not such as were both infor-  
mal and destitute of a competent sanction.  
  
Yer upon this loose and vague übe, Mr, Apaus  
precipitately nominated Mr. Murzxay as Envoy to the  
French Republic, without previous consultation with any of  
his Ministers. The nomination itself was to each of them,  
even to the Secretary of State, his Constitutional Coe  
in similar affairs, the first notice of the project. |  
  
Tuus was the measure OF boch as to mode and sub-  
Stance. - 255  
  
A 8 is not bound to conform to the advice of  
his Ministers. He is even under no positive injunction te  
ask or require it. But the Constitution presumes that he  
will consult them ; and the genius of our government and  
the public good recommend the gray  
  
As  
  
L9  
  
As the President nominates his Ministers, and may dis-  
place them when he pleases, it must be his own fault if he be  
not surrounded by men, who for ability and integrity de-  
serve his confidence. And if his ministers are of this cha-  
racter, the consulting of them will always be likely to be use-  
ful to himself and to the State. Let it even be supposed  
that he is a man of talents superlor to the collected talents of  
all his ministers, (which can seldom happen, as the world has  
seen but few FRTDERICERS) he may, nevertheless, often as-  
sist his judgment by a comparison and collision of ideas.  
The greatest genius, hurried away by the rapidity of its  
own conceptions, will occasionally overlook obstacles which  
ordinary and more phlegmatic men will discover, and which,  
when presented to his consideration, will be thought by  
himself decisive objections to 5 his Ne

Tar stately system of not consulting Ministers, is likely  
to have a further disad vantage. It will tend to exclude  
from places. of primary trust, the men most fit to occupy  
them.  
  
Frw and feeble are the interested inducements to accept  
a place in our Administration. Far from being lucrative,  
there is not one which will not involve pecuniary sacrifice to

&#x27;The probable. operation of a system of this kind, must be to  
consign places of the highest trust to incapable honest men,

this fluctuation in the Executive Chief. It argued either  
instability of views, or want of sufficient consideration be-  
forehand. The one or the other, in an affair of so great mo-  
ment, is a serious reproach.  
  
ADDITIONAL and more competent assurances were receiv-  
ed ; but before the Envoys departed, intelligence arrived of  
a new Revolution in the French Government; which, in  
violation of the Constitution, had er two of the Direc-

A NOTHER Revolution: Another Constitution overthrown;  
Surely here was reason for a pause, at least till it was ascer-  
tained that the new Directory would adhere to the engage-  
ment of its predecessors, and would not send back our En-  
voys with disgrace. | | |  
  
In the then posture of French affairs, which externally  
as well as internally, were unprosperous, a pause was every  
way prudent; The recent Revolution was a valid motive  
for it. | 1 BL  
  
DrrIxrrIvE compacts between nations, called real Trea-  
ties, are binding, notwithstanding Revolutions of Govern-  
ments. But to apply the maxim to Ministerial acts, prepa-  
ratory only to negociation, is to extend it too far; to apply it  
to such acts of an unstable revolutionary Government (like  
that of France at that time) is to abuse it.  
  
Hap any policy of the moment demuniied it, it would have  
been not at all surprising to have seen the new Directory  
disavowing the assurance which had been given, and imput-  
ing it as a crime to the Ex-Directors, on the pretence that  
they had prostrated the dignity of the Republic by courting  
the renewal of negociation with a government, which had s  
grossly insulted it. YrrT

Wrix the news of the Revolution. in the Directory arri v-  
ed, Mr. Ap ans was at his seat in Massachusetts. His Mi-  
nisters addressed to him a joint letter, communicating the  
intelligence, and submitting to his consideration, whether  
  
  
a letter which he afterwards wrote from the same place, he  
directed the preparation of a draft of instruetions for the  
Envoys, and intimated that their 3 would be SUS»  
pended for some time.  
  
SHORTLY after he came to Trenton, ** he adjusted  
with his Ministers the tenor of the instructions to be given;  
but he observed a profound silence on the question, whe-  
ther it was expedient that the Mission should proceed.  
The morning after the instructions were settled, he signi-

infallible, that there was no possibility of arguments being  
used which were sufficient to shake them? Ought he not  
to have recollected the sudden revolution which his judg-  
ment had. undergone in the beginning of the business, and  
to have inferred from this, that it might have yielded in ano-  
ther instance to better lights? Was it necessary for him, if  
  
  
ed their delicacy, by prefacing the discussion with a decla-  
ration-that he had fixed an unalterable opinion ? Did not the  
intimation respecting a suspension of the departure of the  
Envoys, imply that this would continue till there was a  
change of circumstances? Was it not a circumstance to  
strengthen expectation in the Ministers, when consulted  
about the instructions, that they would be heard as to the  
principal point, previous to a definitive resolution?  
  
Grvixo Mr. Apans credit for sincerity, the desulto-  
riness of his mind is evinced by the very different grounds  
upon which, at different times, he has defended the propriety  
of the mission.  
  
SOMETIMES he has treated with ridicule the idea of its  
being a measure which would terminate in peace; asserting  
that France would not accommodate, on terms admissible  
by the United States, and that the effect to be expected from  
the mission, was the demonstration of this truth, and the  
  
  
SOMETIMES, and most frequently, he has vindicated the  
  
  
wish of the country for peace, and as * to . that  
  
  
Ir is now earnestly to be hoped, chat the final issue of

sate for the sacrifice of consistency, dignity, harmony and  
reputation, at which it has been undertaken.  
  
Bur even in relation to the adjustment of differences  
  
  
It was probable that it would delay, rather than accelerate,  
such an adjustment.  
  
Tux situation of French affairs, at the time of the over-  
tures for renewing the negociation, coincides with the soli-  
citude which was manifested for that object, to render it  
likely that, at this juncture, France really desired accom-  
modation. If this was so, it is presumeable (as observed  
in another place) that, had not the declaration about send-  
ing a Minister to her intervened, she would have sent one  
to us, with adequate powers and instructions. Towards a  
Minister here, our Government might have acted such a  
part as would have hastened a conclusion; and the Minister,  
conforming to the impressions of his Government when he  
was sent, it is not improbable that a desirable arrangement  
might sometime since have been effected. |  
  
IxsTEAD of this, the mode pursued, naturally tended to  
delay. A lapse of time, by changing the circumstances, is  
very apt to change the views of Governments. The French  
Agents, charged with the negociation at Paris, could find  
  
  
of a campaign) should be ascertained, as a guide to rise or  
fall in their pretensions. And in this way, obstacles might  
  
  
and which might render accommodation impracticable—or  
practicable only on terms injurious to our interests.  
  
Tus, on every just calculation, whatever may be the is.  
  
  
reign  
  
35  
  
reign affairs, even to our concerns with France herself, was  
alike impolitic.  
  
IT is sometimes defended by the argument, that when  
our Commissioners departed, there were circumstances in  
the position of Europe which made a general peace during  
the succeeding winter probable, and that it would have been  
dangerous for this country, remote as it is from Europe, to  
have been without agents on the spot authorised to settle  
Its controversy with France, at the same epoch. The coun-  
try, it is said, might otherwise have been left in the perilous  
situation of having a subsisting quarrel with France, after  
she had disembarrassed herself of all her European ene-  
mies.  
  
Tux idea that a general peace was likely to happen dur-  
ing that winter, was, I know, entertained by Mr. ApAus  
himself; for, in a casual conversation at Trenton, he ex-  
pressed it to me, and I supported a different opinion. But  
waving now a discussion of the point, and admitting that the  
expectation was entertained on substan tial grounds, though  
it has not been verified by experience, still the argument de-  
ed from it is not valid,  
  
Tux expediency of the measure must be tested by the  
state of things when it had its inception, © At the time the  
foundation was laid for it by the speech, when even the no-  
mination of Mr, MurRAar took place, the affairs of France  
and of her enemies, portended a result very inauspicious to  
Her, and very different from that of a general peace, on con-  
ditions which would leave her the inclination or the power  
to prosecute hostilities against this country.  
  
Bor even on the supposition of ather prospects, Mr.  
Apaus had the option of a substitute far preferable to the  
expedient which he chose. |  
  
Hr  
  
36  
  
He might secretly and confidentially have nominated one  
or more of our Ministers actually abroad ſor the purpose of  
treating with France; with eventual instructions predicated  
upon appearances of an e peace.  
  
Ax expedient of this sort, merely provisory, could have  
had none of the bad effects of the other. If the secret was  
kept, it could have had no inconvenient consequences; if  
divulged, it would have been deemed here and elsewhere, a  
prudent precaution only, recommended by the distant situa-  
tion of the country, to meet future casualties, with which we  
might otherwise not have been able to keep pace, To the  
enemies of France, it could have given no ill impression of  
us ; to France, no motive to forbear other conciliatory  
means, for one and the same reason, namely, because the  
r was to be eventual.  
  
&#x27;THERE are some collateral incidents connected with this  
business of the Mission, which it may not be useless to  
mention, as they will serve still farther to illustrate the ex-  
treme propensity of Mr, ApAxs&#x27;s temper to jealousy.  
  
Ir happened that I arrived at Trenton a short time be-  
fore the President Chief Justice ELswoRTH a short time

and myself, to endeavor to influence or counteract him in

concert with him of some weeks standing, to accelerate, by  
personal conferences with the Secretary of War, the adop-

ALition

sition of the Western Army; that when I left New-York  
upon. this journey, I had no expectation, whatever, that the  
President would come to Trenton, and that I did not stay  
at this place a day longer than was indispensable to the ob-  
ject I have stated. General WILkIxNSsox, if necessary,  
might be appcaled to, not only as knowing that this was a  
real and sincere purpose of my journey, but as possessing  
satisfactory evidence, that in all probability, I had no antici-  
pation of the moyement of the President.  
  
As to Chief Justice ELswokru, the design of his journey  
was understood to be to meet his colleague, Governor DAvx,  
at the scat of the Government, where they would be at the  
fountain head of information, and would obtain any lights or  
explanations which they might suppose useful. This was  
manifestly a very natural and innocent solution of the Chief  
Justice&#x27;s visit, and I believe the true one.  
  
Ver these simple occurrences were to the jealous mind  
of Mr. Ap Aus, «confirmations strong,“ of some mischiev-  
ous plot against his independence.  
  
Tux circumstance, which next presents itself to examina-  
tion, is the dismission of the two Secretaries, PickrRING  
and M HENRY. This circumstance, it is known, occasion-  
  
ed much surprise, and a strong o sensation to the disad vantage  
of Mr, ApASs. A  
  
Ir happened at a peculiar j juncture, immediately after the  
unfavorable turn of the election in New-York, and had  
much the air of an explosion of combustible materials which  
had been long prepared, but which had been kept down by  
prudential calculations respecting the effect of an explosion  
upon the friends of those Ministers in the State of New-  
York, Perhaps, when it was &quot;—_—_— that r could  
  
bY be  
  
38  
be lost in this quarter, and that something might be gained  
elsewhere by an atoning sacrifice of those Ministers, espe-  
  
cially Mr. P1CKERING, who had been for some time particu-  
larly odious to the opposition party, it was determined to  
  
  
w  
  
cd for as much as it may be worth.  
  
One fact, however, is understood to be admitted, name-  
ly, that neither of the dismissed Ministers had given any  
new or recent cause for their dismission.  
  
A PRIMARY cause of the state of things which led to this  
event, is to be traced to the ungovernable temper of Mr.  
Apams. It is a fact that he is often liable to paroxisms of  
anger, which deprive him of self command, and produce ve-  
ry outrageous behaviour to those who approach him. Most,  
if not all his Ministers, and several distinguished Members  
of the two Houses of Congress, have been humiliated by the  
effects of these gusts of passion.  
  
T H1s violence, and the little consideration for them which  
was implied in declining to consult them, had occasioned  
  
  
* J believe, the Secretary of the Navy.  
  
Tux neglect was of course most —— to Mr. Pick-  
ERING, because it had repeatedly operated in matters apper-  
taining to his office. Nor was it in the disposition of this  
respectable man, justly tenacious of his, own dignity and  
independence, to practise condescentions towards an impe-  
rious chief. Hence the breach constantly gw wider and  
Wie till a separation took we.  
  
Tax manner of the dainiiesion.was abrupt and uncoyrte-  
ous ; ill suited to a man, who, in different stations, had me-  
rited so much from his country.

. ADmITTING that when the President and his Minister had  
gotten into a situation thus unpleasant, a separation was un-  
avoidable ; still, as there was no surmise of misconduct, the  
case required a frank politeness, not an uncouth austerity.  
  
Bur the remark most interesting in this particular, to the  
character of the President, is, that it was by his own fault  
that he was brought into a situation which might oblige him  
to displace a Minister, whose moral worth has his own suf.  
frage, and whose abilities and services have that of the  
public.  
  
Tux dismission of this Minister was preceded by a very  
curious circumstance. It was, without doubt, announced as  
a thing shortly to happen in an opposition circle, before any  
friend of the Governm ent had the slightest suspicion of it.  
This circumstance, taken in connection with the period as  
which it happened, naturally provokes the conjecture that  
there may have been some collateral inducements to the  
step.  
  
Tux dis mission of the Secretary at War took place about  
the same time. It was declared in the sequel of a long con-  
versation between the President and him, of a nature to ex-  
cite alternately pain and laughter; pain, for the weak and  
  
  
  
WoxprRror!  
  
440  
  
*&#x27;WoxpeRrrvr. ! passing Wonderful! that an Eulogy. of  
| the dead patriot and hero, of the admired and beloved  
WASHINGTON, consecrated in the affections and reverence  
  
of his country, should, in any shape, be irksome to the ears  
  
of his success or!  
  
. SINGULAR, also, that an encomium on the officer, first in  
rank in the armies of the United States, appointed and con-  
tinued by Mr. Ap Aus, should in his eyes have been a crime  
in the head of the War Department, and that it should be  
necessary, in order to avert his displeasure, to obliterate 4  
compliment to that officer from an official Report.  
  
ANOTHER principal topic of accusation was, that the Se-  
cretary had, with the other Ministers, signed the joint letter,  
which had been addressed to the President respecting a sus -  
pension of the Mission to France. It was ostentatiously  
asked, how he or they should pretend to know any thing of  
diplomatic affairs ; and it was plainly intimated that it was  
presumption in them to have intermeddled in such affairs,  
  
A varrery of things equally frivolous and owtr/ passed.  
By way of episode, it fell to my lot to be distinguished by a  
torrent of gross personal abuse ; and I was accused of having  
contributed to the loss of the election in New-York, out of  
ill will to Mr. Apams: a notable expedient truly for giving  
vent to my ill will. Who is so blind as not to see, that  
If actuated by such a motive, I should have preferred by the  
success of the election, to have secured the choice of eleot-  
ors for the State of New- Vork, who would have been we  
to&#x27; co-operate in the views * which I e e .  
  
To those who have not had — of at in-  
specting the weaknesses of Mr. Apamss character, the de-  
  
; tail of this extraordinary interview would appear meredible ;

but to those who haye had these opportunities, they would  
not even furnish an occasion of gyrprise. But they would  
be, to all who knew their truth, irrefragable proofs of his un-  
  
| bene; for the station of Chief Magistrate.  
  
ILL treatment of Mr. M*Hexry cannot fail to awaken  
the sympathy of eyery person .well acquainted with him.  
Sensible, judicious, well-informed, of an integrity never  
questioned, of a temper, which, though firm in the support  
of principles, has too much moderation and amenity to offend  
  
gave Mr. Avans cause to treat him, as he did, with unkind-  
ness. If Mr. Apans thought that his execution of bis ol  
nee indicated awant of the peculiar qualifications required for  
  
  
have only exercised a prerogative entrusted to him by the  
Constitution, to which no blame could have attached; but  
  
it was unjustifiable to aggrayate the deprivation of office by  
  
  
| Tux last material occurrence i in the administration of Mr.  
  
Apans, of which I shall take natice, is the pardon of Fries,  
  
and other principals in the late insurrection in Pennsyl-  
. ED N  
  
: Iran oct that a yery refractory apirit has long existed  
in the Wegtexn Counties of that State. Repeatedly have its  
an laws been opposed-with violence, and as often, 85 9  
a {mation With re.  
  
Ir js algo. a fact, which every body-knows, that the laws  
of de Union, in the vital article of gevenue, have been twice  
by combinations so extensive, and  
under circumstances 50 violent, as to have called for the em-  
a force ; once er the former Pregident,  
  
and  
  
42  
and once under the actual President ; which together cost  
the United States nearly a million and a half of dollars.  
  
Ix the first instance it happened, that by the early submĩs-  
sion of most of che leaders, upon an invitation of the govern-  
ment, few offenders of any consequence remained suhject to  
prosecution. Of these, either from the humanity of the  
juries or some deficiency in the evidence, not one was capi-  
tally convicted. Two poor wretches only were sentenced  
to die, one of them little short of an ideot, the other a mise-  
rable follower in the hindmost train of rebellion, both beings so  
insignificant in all respects, that aſter the lenity shewn to the  
chiefs, justice would have worn the mien of ferocity, if she  
had raised her arm against them. The sentiment that their  
punishment ought to be remitted was universal; and the  
President, yielding to the special considerations, granted  
them pardons.  
  
In the last instance, some of the most important of the  
offenders were capitally convicted one of them by the ver-  
dicts of two successive juries. The general opinion of the  
friends of the Government demanded an example, as indis-  
pensable to its security. 18  
  
TE opinion was well founded. Two insurrections in  
the same State, the one upon the heels of the other, demon-  
strated a spirit of insubordination or disaffection which re-  
quired a strong corrective. It is a disagreeable fact, ſorming  
a weighty argument in the question, that a large part of the  
population of Pennsylvania is of a composition which pecu-  
Barly fits it for the intrigues of factious men, who may de-  
Sire to disturb or overthrow the Government: And it is  
an equally disagreeable fact, that disaffection to the national  
Government is in no other State more general m more deeply  
  
rooted, or more envenomed. ak TN,  
THE  
  
43  
  
Tur late Governor MirFLix himself informed me that  
in the first case, insurrection had been organized down to  
the very liberties of Philadelphi ia, and that had not the Go-  
vernment anticipated it, a general explosion would speedily  
have ensued.  
  
Ir ought to be added, that the impunity, so often experi-  
enced, had made it an article in the creed of those who were  
actuated by the insurgent spirit, that neither the General  
nor the State Government dared to inflict capital punish-  
ment. :  
  
To destroy this persuasion, to repress this dangerous  
spirit, it was essential that a salutary rigor should have  
been exerted, and that those who were under the influence  
of the one and the other should be taught * * were the  
dupes of a fatal illusion.  
  
Or this, Mr. 8 appeared so sensible, that while the  
trials were pending, he more than once imprudently threw  
out, that the accused must found their hopes of escape ei-  
ther in their innocence or in the lenity of the juries; since  
from him, in case of conviction, they would have nothing to  
expect. And a very short time before he pardoned them,  
he declared (b) with no small ostentation, that the mistaken  
clemency of WasninGToN on the former occasion, had  
been the cause of the second insurrection, and that he  
would take care there should not be a third, by giving the  
laws their full « course against the convicted offenders, |  
  
= he thought proper, as if distrusting the courts wand  
ede of the United States, to resort through the Attor-

Tx contrary course, EY was pursued, 1 is the most Hr  
explicable. part of Mr. Apang&#x27;s conduct. Tt he ws him s

have had no cause to complain, if there had not been an ap-  
parent inconsistency in the measures of the President; if he  
  
had not nominated me first on the list of Major Generals,  
and attempted afterwards to place me third in rank. —  
As to the latter, the Chief Command, not being a mat-  
ter of routine, the not promoting me to it, cannot be  
dcemed a wrong or injury; yet certainly I could not see, in  
the mission, any proof of good will or confidence —or of a  
disposition to console me for the persecutions which I had  
incessantly endured. But I dismiss the Subject, leaving to  
others to judge of my pretensions to the promotion, and of  
the weight, if any, which they ought to have had with the  
President.  
  
Ox other topics, my-sensations are far less neutral. —lIf,  
as I have been assured from respectable authorities, Mr,  
Apans has repeatedly indulged himself in virulent and in-  
decent abuse of me; if he has denominated me a man desti-  
tute of every moral principle; if he has stigmatised me as  
the leader of a British Faction; then certainly I have right  
to think that I have been most cruelly and wickedly traduc-  
ed; then have I right to appeal to all those who have been  
spectators of my public actions; to all who are acquainted with  
my private character, in its various relations, whether such  
treatment of me, by Mr. Abus, is of a nature to weaken  
or to strengthen his claim to the approbation of wise and good  
men; then will Iso far yield to the consciqusness of what I  
am, as to declare, that in the cardinal points of public and  
private rectitude, above all, in pure and disinterested  
zeal for the interests and service of this country shrink  
not from a comparison with any arrogant pretender to supe -

ing understood that his partisans, to counteract the influencs  
of my opinion, were pressing the same charge against inc:  
I wrote him a letter on the subject, dated the first of AU  
gust last. No reply having been given by him to this ler-  
ter, I, on the first of the present month, wrote him another;  
of both which letters I send you copies.  
  
Or the purity of my public dee in this, as in other par-  
ticulars, I may defy the severest investigation.  
  
Nor only is it impossible for any man to give color to this  
absurd charge, by a particle of proof, or by any reasonable  
presumption ; but I am able to shew, that my conduct has  
uniformly given the he to it.  
  
I NEVER advised any connection * with Great-Britain,  
other than a commercial one; and in this I never advocated  
the giving to her any privilege or advantage which was not  
to be imparted to other nations. With regard to her pre-  
tensions as a belligerent power in relation to neutrals, my  
opinions, while in the Administration, to the best of my re-  
collection, coincided with those of Mr. JexrERsoNn. When  
in the year 1793, her depredations on our commerce disco-  
vered a hostile spirit, I recommended one definitive effort  
to terminate differences by negociation, to be followed, if  
unsuctessful, by a declaration of war. I urged, in the most  
earnest manner, the friends of the Admimistration, in both

| houtes of Congress, to prepare by sea and land for the alter»  
native, to the utmost extent of our resources; and to an ex”  
tent far&#x27; exceeding what any member of either party was  
found willing to go. For this alternative, I became so firmly  
pledged to che friends and enemies of the Administrations  
and especially to the President of the United States, in writ-  
ing as well as verbally, that I could not aſterwards have re-  
tracted without a glaring and disgraceful i inconsistency- And  
being thus pledged, I explicitly gave it as my opinion to  
Mr. Jar, Envoy to Great-Britain, that “ unless an adjustment  
« of the differences with her could br effected on solid terms, it  
t word be better to do nothing. When the treaty arrived, it  
was not without full deliberation and some hesitation, that I  
resolved to support it. The articles relative to the settle-  
ment of differences were upon the whole satisfactory; but  
there were à few of he others which appeared to me of 2  
different character; The article respecting contraband,  
though confarmable wath the general law of nations, was not  
in all its features such as could have been -wished. The  
XXVch article, which gave asylum in our ports, under cer -  
tain exteptions, to privateers with their priges, was in. itself  
an ineligible one, being of a nature to. excite the discontent  
of nations against whom it should operate, andl deriving its  
Jjustification from the example beſore set of an equivalent sti-  
pulation in our Treaty with France. The XIIth article,  
was in my view inadmissible. The enlightened negociator,  
not unconscious that some parts of the Treaty were less  
well arranged than was to be desired, had himself hesitated  
to sign: but he had resigned his scruples to the conviction  
That nothing better could be effected, and that . aggregately  
considered, the instrument would be advantageous to the  
United States. On my part, the result. of nature reflection  
was, that as the subjects of controverey chic had threat-  
ened the peace of the two nations, and which implicatecl  
great interests of tlis countrx, were in · the essential points,

well adjusted, and as che other, articles would expire in  
twelve years after the ratification of the Treaty, it would  
be wise and right to confirm the compact, with the excep-  
tion of the XIIth article. Nevertheless, when an decount  
Was received that the British cruizers had seized proyisic F

ty conditionally only, chat is, with express instructions nat

made, shews that Mr. Ap Aus has committed some positive  
and serious errors of Administration; that in addition

chief, of any Administration of which he is the head; that by  
  
tracted the supporters of the Government; that he has fur-  
nished deadly weapons to its enemies by unfounded accusa-  
tions, and has weakened the force of its friends by decrying  
some of the most influential of them to the utmost of his  
power; and let it be added, as the necessary effect of such  
ronduct, that he has made great progress in undermining  
the ground which was gained for the government by his pre-  
decessor, and that there is real cause to apprehend, it might  
totter, if not fall, under his future auspices. A new govern-  
ment, constructed on free principles, is always weak, and  
must stand in need of the props of a firm and good adminis-

The body of Federalists, for want of sufficient knowledge of  
facts, are not convinced: of the expediency of relinquishing  
him. It is even apparent, that a large proportion still retain  
the attachment which was ance à common sentiment.—  
Those of them, therefore, who are dissatisfied; as far as my  
information goes, are, generally speaking, willing to forbear  
opposition, and to acquiesce in the equal support of Mr.  
Apans with Mr. Pincxxey, whom they prefer, Have  
they not a claim to equal deference from those who conti-  
  
  
to admit the possibility that the friends who differ from  
them, act not only from pure motives, but from cogent rea-  
sons? Ought they nat, by a co-operation in General Pixcx-  
NEY, to give a chance for what will be a safe issue, suppos-  
ing. that they are right in their preference, and the best  
issue, should they happen to be mistaken ? Especially, since  
by doing this, they will increase the probability of excluding  
a third candidate, of whose unfitness all sincere federalists  
are convinced. If they do not pursue this course, they will  
certainly incur an immense responsibility to their friends and  
to the Government, a  
  
To promote this co-operation, to defend my own charac-  
ter, to vindicate those friends, who with myself have been  
unkindly aspersed, are the inducements for writing this let-  
ter. Accordingly, i it will be my endeavor to regulate the  
communication of it in such a manner as will not be likely  
to deprive Mr. Apans of a single vote. Indeed, it is much  
my wish that its circulation could forever be confined within  
narrow limits. I am sensible of the inconveniences of giv-  
ing publicity to a similar developement of the character of  
the Chief Magistrate of our country ; and I lament the ne-  
cessity of taking a step which will involve that result. Yet  
to suppress truths, the disclosure of which is so interesting  
  
—  
  
to  
  
52  
  
to che public welfare as well as to the vindication of my  
friends and myself, did not appear to me justifiable.  
  
Tur restraints, to which I submit, are a proof of my dis-  
position to sacrifice to the prepossessions of those, with  
whom I have heretofore thought and acted, and from whom  
in the present question I am compelled to differ. To re-  
frain from a decided opposition to Mr. Apans&#x27;s re-election  
has been reluctantly sanctioned by my judgment ; which has  
been not a little perplexed between the unqualified convic-  
tion of his unfitness for the station contemplated, and a  
sense of the great importance of cultivating harmony among  
the supporters of the Government ; on whose firm union  
hereafter will probably depend the preservation of order,  
tranquillity, liberty, property; the security of every social  
and domestic blessing.

giving to her any privilege or advantage

predations on our commerce difcovered a

negociation, to be followed, if unfuc-  
cefsful, by a declaration of war. I urged,  
in the moft earneft manner, the friends  
of the adminiftration in both houfes of  
Congrefs, to prepare, by fea and land,  
for the alternative, to the utmoft extent  
of our refources; and to an extent far  
exceeding what any member of either  
party was found willing to go. For this  
alternative, I became fo firmly pledged  
to the friends and enemies of the ad-  
miniftration, and efpecially to the Pre-  
fident of the United States, in writing as

the latter could do us moft mifchief),  
but from the perfuafion, that the fenti-  
ments and prejudices of our country  
would render war with France a more  
unmanageable bulineis than war with  
Great-Uritain.  
  
* Let any fair man pronounce, whe-  
ther the circumftances which have been  
difclofed befpeuk the partizan of Great-  
Britain, or the man exclufively devoted  
to the intercits of this country. Let any  
delicate man decide, whether it muit not  
be fhocking to an ingenuous mind, to  
have to combat a flander fo vile, after  
having facrificed the intereits of his fa-  
mily, and devoted the beft part of his  
life to the fervice of that country, in  
counsel and in the field.”  
  
After this the following recapi-  
tulation appears:  
  
“ The ftatement which has been made,  
fhows that Mr. Adams has committed  
{ome pofitive aid ferious errors of admi-  
nijiration; that, in addition to theic, he  
has certain fixed points of character,  
which tend naturally to the detriment  
of any caufe of which he is the chief, of  
any adininiftration of which he is the  
head; that, by his ill humours and jea-  
loufies, he has already divided and dif-  
tracted the fupporters of the government;  
that he has furnifhed deadly weapons to  
its enemies, by unfounded accufations,  
and has weakened the force of its friends,  
by decrying fome of the moft influential  
of them to the utmoft of his power ; and  
let it be added, as the neceffary effect of  
fuch conduct, that he has made great  
progrefs in undermining the ground  
which was gained for the government  
by his predeceffor, and that there is real  
caufe to apprehend it might tocter, if  
not fall, under his future aufpices. A  
new. government, conitructed on free  
principles, is always weak, and mutt  
ftand in need of the props of a firm and  
good admimiftration, till time fhall have  
rendered its authority venerable, and for-  
tified it by habits of obedience.  
  
“Yet, with this opinion of Mr. Adams,  
I have finaliy refolved not to adviie the  
withholding irom him a fingle vote.  
The body of federaliits, for want of fuffi-  
cicnt knowledge of facts, are not con-  
vineed of the expedicney of relinguifhing  
him.”

substance ;”? and the reasoning ap-  
pears to us satisfactory and conclu-  
sive;  
  
“ A Prefident is not bound to conform  
to the advice of his minifters He is  
even under no pofitive injunction to afk  
or require it. But the conftitution pre-  
iumes that he will confult them; and the  
genius of our government and the public  
good recommend the practice.  
  
“ As the Prefidet nominates his mi-  
nifters, and may diiplace them when he  
pleafes, it muft be his own fault if he be  
not furrounded by men, who for ability  
and integrity deferve his confidence.  
And if his minifters are of this chara¢ter,  
the confulting of them will always be  
likely to be ufeful to himfelf and to the  
fate. Let it even be fuppofed that he  
is a man of talents fuperior to the col-  
lected talents of all his minifters (which  
can feldom happen, as the world has feen  
but few Fredericks), he may, neverthe-  
lefs, often affift his judgment by a com-  
parifon and collifion of ideas. The  
ereateft genius, hurried away by the ra-  
pidity of its own conceptions, will occa-  
fionally overlook obftacles which ordi-  
nary and more phlegmatic men will dif-  
cover, and which, when prefented to  
his confideration, will be thought by  
himfelf decifive objections to his plans.  
  
“ When, unhappily, an ordinary man  
dreams himfelf to be a Frederick, and,  
through vanity, refrains from counfelling  
with his conttitutional advifers, he is  
very apt to fall into the hands of mifer-  
able intriguers, with whom his felf-love  
is more at ease, and who, without difi-

culty, flide into his confidenee, and, by  
flattery, govern him.  
  
“The ableft men may profit by ad.  
vice. Inferior men cannot difpenfe with  
it; and if they do not get it through le.  
gitimate channels, it will find its way  
to them through fuch as are clandeftine  
and impure.  
  
“ Very different from the practice of  
Mr. Adams was that of the modeft and  
fage Wafhington. He confulted much,  
pondered much, refolved flowly, refolv-  
ed furely.  
  
* And, as furely, Mr. Adams might  
have benefited by the advice of his mi-  
niiters.  
  
“ The ftately fyftem of not confulting  
minifters is likely to have a further dif  
advantage. It will tend to exclude from  
places of primary truft the men moft fit  
to occupy them.  
  
“Few and feeble are the interefted  
inducements to accept a place in our ad-  
miniftration. Far from being lucrative,  
there is not one which will not involve  
pecuniary facrifice to every hone man of  
pre-eminent talents. And has not expe-  
rience fhown, that he mutt be fortunate  
indeed, if even the fuccefsful execution  
of his talk can fecure to him confidera-  
tion and fame? Of a large harvett of  
obloquy he is fure.  
  
“If excluded from the counfels of the  
executive chief, his office muft become  
truly infignificant. What amiable and  
virtuous man will long confent to be fo  
miferable a pageant ?  
  
“Every thing that tends to banihh  
from the adminiftration able men, tends  
to diminifh the chances of able counfels.  
The probable operation of a fyftem of  
this kind muft be to confign places of  
the higheft truft to incapable honeft  
men, Whofe inducement will be a liveli-  
hood—or to capable difhoneft men, who  
will feek indireét indemnifications for  
the deficiency of dire&amp; and fair induces

his fcruples to the conviction that nothing  
better could be effected; and that, ag-  
gregately confidered, the inftrument  
would be advantageous to the United  
States. On my part, the refult of ma-  
ture reflection was, that as the fubjects  
of controverfy which had threatened the  
peace of the two nations, and which im-  
plicated great interefts of this country,  
were, in the effential points, well adjuft-  
ed; and as the other articles would expire  
in twelve years after the ratification of  
the treaty, it would be wife and right to  
confirm the compact, with the exception  
of the 12th article. Neverthelefs, when  
an account was received that the Britifh  
cfuizers had feized provilions going to  
ports of the French dominions, not in  
fa&amp;t blockaded or befieged, 1 advifed the  
Prefident to ratify the treaty condition-  
ally only, that is, with exprefs inftrac-  
tions not to exchange ratifications, unlcf  
the Britifh government would difavow a  
conftruction of the inftrument authorif=

it.

&quot; Some of the warm oerfonal friends of  
Mn. ADAMS are taking unwearied pains  
to difparage the motives of.thofe Federal*  
ills who advocate the equal fupport of  
General PiNCKNEY at the approaching e­  
lecflion of Prefident and Vice-Prefident.  
  
They are exhibited under a variety of if­  
pects equally derogatory* Sometimes they  
are verfatile, factious fpirits, who cannot  
be contented with any man that will ud  
fubmit to be governed by them :—some­  
times tbev are. intriguing parti fans of Great  
Britain, who d &#x27;he ad-*an&lt;  
of her views, are incenfed againft Mr.  
Adams for the independent impartiality of  
his conduct.  
  
&quot; In addition to a full Ibare of the oblo­  
quy vented againft this defcription ot  
perfons collectively peculiar accufations  
have been deviled to fwel! the cataloj  
my demerits. Among thefe, refentim  
difappointcd ambition forms a prominenl  
feature. It is pretended, that had the Pre­  
fident, upon the demife of Cknk :&lt; \i.  
Washington, appointed me Commander  
in Chief, he would have been, in my efti­  
mation, all that is wife, and good, and  
great.  
M Tt is neceffary, for the public canfe, t&lt;&gt;  
repel thefe (landers ; by ftating the real  
views of the perfons who are calumniated.  
and the reafons of their con  
  
&quot; In executing this talk, with particu­  
lar reference to myfelf, 1 ought to pre*  
tnife, that the ground upon which I (land  
is different from that of moft of thofe who  
are confounded with me as in purfuit of  
the fume plan. While our object is com­  
mon, our motives are varioully clilfimilar.  
  
A part well affected to Mr. Adams, have  
no other wilh than to take a double chance  
againft Mk* Jefferson. Another part,  
feeling a diminution of confidence in him,  
ftill hope that the general tenor of bis  
Co iducl will be effentially right. Few go  
as far in their objections as 1 do. Not  
denying to Mr. Adams patriottfm and  
integrity) and even talents of a certain  
kind, 1 (hould be deficient in candor, were  
1 to conceal the conviction, that be does  
not poffefi the talents adapted to the //,/­  
■ministration of Government, and that  
there are great and intrinsic defects in his  
character, which unfit him for the of]  
Chief Magiftrate.  
&quot; To give a correct idea of the cir-  
CUmftances which have gradually produc­  
ed this conviction, it may be ufeful to re­  
trofpeft to an early period.&quot;  
  
After thefe remarks Mr. Hamilton ob­  
fervea &quot; that he was one of that numerom  
rial&#x27;s who had conceived a high veneration  
for Mr. Adams, on account of the part be  
acted in the firft ftages of our revolution.

me, his rage has been lb vehement, as to

&quot; But a more lerious micftion remains :  
How will Mr. Adams anfwer to the go­  
vernment and to his country, for having  
wantonly given the fanftion of his o­  
pinion to the word of the afperfions which  
the enemies of the adminiftration have im­

Mr. Adams in thie affair, that he is known  
to b.aVe delired, at the time, the appoint­

After condemning as temporifing the

On the refufal by the French government

i-tleli is the difmiilion of the two fecretaries,  
PICKEKING and M&#x27;Hkk&#x27;ut. This &lt;ir­  
cumfhmce, it is known, occalioned much  
furprife, and a ftrong fenfation to the difad­  
vantageof Mr. Adams&#x27;.&quot;  
  
&quot;it happened at a peculiar juncture, im­  
mediately after the unfavorable turn ofthf  
election in New-York, and had much the  
air of an explofion of oombufthVle materials  
which bad been IOUg prepared, but which,  
had been kept down by prudential calcula­  
tions refpe&amp;ing the effecT; of an explofion  
upon the friend* of thofe minifters in the  
Rate of New-York. Perhaps, when it was  
fuppofed that nothing could be 101 lin this  
quarter* and that Something might be gain­  
ed elle where by an atoning facjfifice ofthofc  
minifters, efpecially Mr. PICtfBRING, who  
had been for Come time peculiarly odious to  
the oppolition party, it was determined to  
proceed to extremities. This, an a mere  
conjecture, is offered for as much ai it may  
be worth.&quot;  
  
&quot; One fad, however, is underftood to be  
admitted, namely, that neither of thedif­  
, miffed minifters had given any new or re­  
cent caufe for their difmiffionV&quot;  
  
&quot; A primary caui&#x27;e of the ftate of things  
which led to this event, is to be traced tc  
&#x27;be ungovernable temper of Mr. Adams.  
It is a fade that be is often liable toparox­  
ifma of anger, which deprive him of felf­  
command, and produce very outrageoUt  
behavior to thofe who approach him. Moll  
if not all bis minifters, and fevrral diftin­  
ruidied members of the two boufes of Con­  
grefs, have been humiliated by the effects  
of thefe guffs of pailion.&quot;  
&quot;This violence, and the little confidera­  
tion for them which was implied in declining  
to confult them, had occasioned great dry*  
nefs between the Prefident and his minif­  
ters, except, I believe, the fecretary of the  
navy.&quot;  
  
&quot; The neglect was of courfe moft poig- i  
nam to Mr. Pickering, becaufe it had  
repeatedly operated in matters appertaining  
to his office. Nor was it in thedifpofition &#x27;  
of this refpectable man, juftly tenacious of  
bis own dignity and independence, to prac­  
tice t ondefcentions towards an imperious  
chief. Hence the breach conftantly grew  
wider and wider, till a feparation took  
place.&quot;  
&quot; The manner of the difmiffion was abrupi  
and uncouiteous ; ill fuited to a man, who  
in different Rations, had merited lb much  
from bis country.&quot;  
&quot; Admitting that when the prefident and  
his minifler had gotten into a lituatioti thus  
unplcafant, a feparation was unavoidable ;  
(till, as there was no furmife of mifconduct.  
the cafe required a frank politenefs, not an  
uncouth aufterity.&quot;  
&quot; But the rem rk mob interefling in this  
particular, to the character of the J&#x27;relident  
is, that it was by bis own fault that he was  
at into a lituation which might ob­  
lige him todifplace a miniftcr, whole moral  
worth has bis own fuffrage, and whole abi­  
fhd Services have that of the public.&quot;  
&quot; The difmiffion of this minifler was pre­  
ceded by a very curious (ircimifiani c. It  
was, without doubt, announced as a thing  
Ibortly to happen in an oppofition circle, be­  
fore any friend of the government bad tht  
II fufpicion of it. This r.ircumilance  
taken in connection with the period a 4  
which it happened, naturally provokes the  
conjecture that there may have ben foine  
collateral inducements to the ftep.&quot;  
M The difmiffion of the Secretary at  
War took place about the fame time. It  
was declared in the fequel of a long con­  
verfation between the Prefident and him,  
of a nature to excite alternately paill are;  
&#x27;laughter; pain, for the weak and exceffive  
mdiii retions of a Chief Magillrate of tht  
United States ; laughter at the ludicrous  
which conliiuited charges againll this  
&#x27; officer.&quot;  
  
&quot; A prominent charge was, that the  
feoiclary, in a report to the Iloufe of Re*  
prefentatives, hadeulogized general Wash*  
ingtoii, and had attempted to eulogize ge­  
neral llaxiltch, wluch mm adduced as;  
  
one proof of a combin don, in which the  
Secretary was engaged, to depreciate and  
injure him the Prefident.&quot;  
&quot; VVoi lei ful ! palling wonderful I that  
an eulogy of the dead patriot and hero, of  
the admired and beloved Washington,  
confecrated in the affections and reverence  
of has country, (hould, in any lhape, lie  
irkfome to the cars of his fuccelfor !&quot;  
  
&quot; Singular, alio, that an encomium on  
til-- officer, lirl t in rank in the armies of the  
I State:,, appointed and continued by  
Mr. Adams, (hould in his eyes ha\­  
a crime in the head of the war department,  
and that it (hould be necelfarv in order to  
avert his difpleafure, to obliterate a compli­  
ment to that officer from an official report.&quot;  
  
&quot; Another principal topic ofaccufation  
was, that the fecretary had, with the other  
minifters, (igned the joint letter which had  
heen addrcll&#x27;ed to the Prefidentrefpe&amp;inga  
fufpeniicn of the million to Trance. It was  
oftentatioufly afked, bow be or they (hould  
pretend to know any thing of diplomatic  
affairs ; and it was plainly intimated that  
&#x27;it was prefumption in them to have meddled  
in fuch affairs.&quot;  
  
&quot; A variety of thine,?, equally frivolous;  
and outre palled. By way of epifode, it  
fell to my lot to be diftinguifhed by a tor­  
rent of grofs perfonal abide ; and 1 was ac­  
culcd of having Contributed to the lofs of  
the election in New-York, out of ill will to  
Mr. Adams : a notable expedient truly  
for giving vent to mv ill will. Who is lb  
blind as not to fee, that if actuated by  
filch a motive, 1 (hould have preferred by  
the fuceel&#x27;s of the election, to have feeured  
the choice of electors for the State of New-  
York, who would have been likely to co­  
operate in the views by which I was govern­  
ed ?—Tothofe who have not had opportu­  
nities of clofely infpe£Mng the weaknefles  
of Mr. Adams&#x27;s character, the detaili of  
this extraordinary interview would appear  
incredible ; but to thofe who have bad thefe  
opportunities, they would not even furnilb  
an occafion of furprife. Hut they would be

&quot; Of this, Mr. Adams appeared lb fcii­  
lible, that while the trials were pending,  
he more than once imprudently threw out,  
that the accufed mult found their hopes of  
efcapc either in their innocence or in the

promoted to the firft place, when it became  
vacant, by the deatii of the Commander in

&quot; On other topics, my fenfations are far  
lefs neutral.—lf, as I have been afliire»l  
from refpectable authorities, Mr. Adams  
has repeatedly indulged bimfelf in virulent  
and indecent abide of me ; if he has deno­  
minated me a man deftitute of every moral  
principle ; if he has ftigmatifed me as the  
leader of a Britifh faction ; then certainly

moft cruelly and wickedly traduced ; then  
have 1 a right to appeal to all thofe who  
have been fpec&#x27;tators of my public actions ;  
to all who are acquainted with my private  
character, in its various relations, whether  
Inch treatment of me, by Mr. Adams, is  
of a nature to weaken or ftrengthen his  
claim to the approbation of wife and good  
men ; J hen will I Co far yield to the con­  
fcioufnefs of what I am, as to declare, that

ftood that his partifans, to counteract the  
influence of ni}&#x27;opinion, were prelling the

a man, the iecondin official rank, the fe-

peculiarity unlucky for Mr. Adams in

fired at the time, the appointment which  
wasHven to Mr. Pinckney. The Preii-

infurrections in the lame ilate, the one  
upon the heels of the other demonftra- &#x27;  
tcd a fpirit of insubordination, or cliiaf-  
fection, which required a (trong correc

fits it for the intrigues of factious men,

“ Some of the warm perfonal friends of Mr. Adams are taking unwea-  
ried pains.to difparage the motives of thofe Federalifts who advocate the  
equal fupport of General Pinckney at the approaching eleétion of Prefident  
and Vice-Prefident. They are exhibited under a variety of afpeéts equally  
derogatory. Sometimes they are verfatile, fatious {pirits, who cannot be  
Jong tatished with any chief, however meritorious:—Sometimes they are  
ambitious (pirits, who can be contented with no man that will not fubmit  
to be governed by them:—Sometimes they are intriguing partifans of  
Great Britain, who, devoted, to the advancement of her views, are in-  
cenfed againft Mr. Adams for the independent impartiality of his condué,  
  
«© In addition to a full fhare of the obloquy vented ogainft this defcrip-  
tion of perlons colle€tively, peculiar acculations have been deviled to {well  
the catalogue of my demerits. Among thele, the refentment of difap-  
  
ointed ambition forms a prominent feature. It is pretendedy that had the

** In executing this tafk, with particular reference to myfelf, I ought to  
  
remife, that the ground upon which I ftand is different from that of moft  
of thole who are confounded with me as in purluit of the fame plan. While  
our objeét is common, our motives are varioufly diffimilar, A part, well  
affefied to Mr. Adams, have no other wifh than to take a double chance  
againft Mr. Jefferfon. Another part, feeling a diminution of confidence  
in him, ftill hope that the general tenor of his condu&amp; will be effentially  
right. Few go as far in their objeftions as Ido. Not denying to Mr,  
Adams patriotifm and integrity, and even talents of a certain kind, I fhould  
be deficient in candour, were I to conceal the convidtion, that he does not  
poffefs the talents adopted to the adminiftration of government, and that  
there are great and intrinfic defeéts in his charaéter, which unfit him for  
  
the office of Chief Magiftrate.”

The author proceeds to ftate feveral faéts to prove the weaknefs,  
vanity, jealoufy, and envioufnefs, of Adams, from which we feleé&amp;  
the following :  
  
‘© Strong evidence of fome traits of this chara&amp;er is to be found in a  
journal of Mr. Adams, which was fent by the then Secretary of Foreign  
Affairs to Congrefs. The reading of this journal extremely embarraffed  
his friends, efpecial!y the delegates of Maffachufetts, who, more than once,  
interrupted it, and, at laft, f{ucceeding in putting a ftop to it, on the fug-  
geftion that it bore the marks of a private and confidential paper, which,  
by fome miftake, had gotten into its prefent fituation, and never could have  
been defigned as a public document for the infpe€tion of Congrefs, The  
good humour of that body yielded to the fuggeftion,  
  
“© The particulars of this journal cannot be expeéted to have remained  
in my memory—but I recolleét one which may ferve asa fample. Being  
among the guefts invited to dine with the Count de Vergennes, Minifters  
for meres Affairs, Mr. Adams thought fit to give a ipecimen of Ame-  
rican politenels, by conduéting Madame de Vergennes to dinner: in  
the way, fhe was pleafed to make retribution in the current coin of  
French politenels—by faying to him, ‘ Monfeur Adams, vows etes k  
Wafhington de negoctation.”” Stating the incident, he makes this comment  
upon it: * Thele people havea very pretty knack of paying compliments,”  
He might have added, they have alfo a very dextrous knack of dilguifing  
a farcalm.  
  
“ The opinion, however, which I have avowed, did not nye my  
entering cordially into the plan of fupporting Mr. Adams for the office of  
Vice-Prefident, under the new conftitution, I ftill thought that he had  
high claims upon the public gratitude, and poffeffed a fubftantial worth of  
charaéter, which might atone for ome great defeéts. In addition to this,  
it was well known, that he was a favourite of New-England, and it was  
obvious that his union with General Wafhington would tend to give the  
government in its outlet, al] the ftrength which it could derive from the  
cheraéter of the two principal magiftrates, But it was deemed an eflen-  
tial point of caution to take care, that accident, or an intrigue of the oP-  
  
: polers  
  
  
  
Hamilton on the public Condu&amp;t, &amp;%c. of Mr. Adams. 45t  
  
fers of the government, fhould not raife Mr. Adams, inftead of General  
WWathington, to the firft place. This, every friend of the Government  
would have confidered as a difaftrous event ; as well becaufe it would have  
difplayed a capricious operation of the fy{tem in elevating to the firft fla-  
tion, a man intended for the fecond ; as becaufe it was conceived that the  
incomparable fuperior weight and tran{fcendant popularity of General  
Wafhington, rendered his prefence at the head of the government, in its  
firft organization, a matter of primary and indifpenfable importance. It  
was therefore agreed that a few votes fhould be diverted from Mr. Adams  
to other perfons, fo as to infure to General Wafhington a plurality.  
  
«© Great was my aftonifhment, and equally great my regret, when, af-  
terwards, I learned from perfons of unqueftionable veracity, that Mr.  
Adams had complained of unfair treatment, in not having been permitted to  
take an equal chance with General Wafhington, by leaving the votes to an  
uninfluenced current.  
  
‘© The extreme egotilm of the temper, which could blind a man to con-  
fiderations fo obvious as thole that had recommended the courle purlued,  
cannot be enforced by my comment. It exceeded all that I had imagined,  
and fhewed, in too {trong a light, that the vanity which I have afcribed to  
him, exifted to a degree that rendered it more than a harmlefs foible.”’

‘* The epoch at length arrived, when the retreat of General Wafhing-  
ton made it neceflary to fix upon a fucceffor. By this time, men of prin-  
cipal influence in the fedral party, whofe fituation had led them to an in-  
timate acquaintance with Mr. Adams’s charatter, began to entertain ferious  
doubts about his fitnefs for the ftation ; yet, his pretenfions, in feveral re-  
{pe€ts, were fo ftrong, that after mature reflection, they thought it better  
to indulge their hopes than to liften to their fears. ‘To this conclufion, the  
defire of preferving harmony in the fedral party, was a weighty induce-  
ment. Accordingly it was determined to fupport Mr. Adams for the chicf  
magiftracy.  
  
‘* It was evidently of much confequence to endeavour to have an emi-  
nent federalift Vice-Prefident. Mr. ‘Thomas Pinckney, of South Carolina,  
was fele€ted for this puarry: This gentleman, too little known in the  
north, had been all his life time diftinguifhed in the fouth, for the mild-  
nefs and amiablenefs of his manners, the reétitude and purity of his mo-  
rals, and the foundne(fs and corre€tnefs of his underftanding, accompanied  
by an habitual difcretion and {felf-command, which has often occafioned a  
parallel to be drawn between him and the venerated Wafhington. In ad-  
dition to thefe recommendations, he had been, during a critical period, our  
Minifter at the Court of London, and recently Envoy extraordinary to  
the Court of Spain; and in both thefe trufts, he had acquitted himfelf to  
the fatisfaftion of all parties. With the Court of Spain he had effetted a  
treaty, which removed all the thorny fubjeéts of contention, that had fo  
long threatened the peace of the two countries, and ftipulated 7&quot; —

United States, on their fouthern frontier, and on the Miffifippi, advan  
tages of real magnituce and importance,  
  
‘¢ Well-informed men knew that the event of the eletion was extremely  
problematical ; and, while the friends of Mr. Jetlerfon preditted his fuccets  
with fanguine confidence, his oppoters feared that he might have at leait an  
equal chance with any fedral candidate.  
  
“ To exclude him was deemed, by the Federalifts, a primary objeé,  
Thofe of them who pofietied the beft rmeans of judging, were of opinion  
that it was far lefs important, whether Mr. Adams or Mr. Pinckney was  
the fuccefsful candidate, than that. Mr. Jeflerion fhould not be the perfon ; :  
and on this principle, it was underltood among them, that the two firlt  
mentioned gentiemen fhould be equally fupported ; leaving to cafual ac-  
cefhions of votes in favor of the one of the other, to turn the {cale between  
therm.  
  
* In this plan I united with good faith; in the refolution, to which I  
{crupuloufly adhered, of giving to each candidate an equal fupport. This  
was done, wherever my influence extended; as was more particularly  
manifefted in the State of. New-York, where all the eleétors were my  
warm perfonal or political friends, and all gave a concurrent vote for the  
two federal candidates,  
  
It is true, that a faithful execution of this plan would have given Mr.  
Pinckney a fomewhat better chance than Mr. Adams; nor fhall it be con-  
eealed, that an iffue favorable to the former would not have been diagree-  
able to me; as indeed | declared at the time, in the circles of my cor ccasset-  
tial friends. My pofition was, that 1f chance fhould decide in favor of Mr.  
Pinckney, it probably would not be a misfortune ; fince he, to every effen-  
tial qualification for the ofice, added a temper far more difcrect and conci-  
hatory than that of Mr. Adams.  
  
*¢ This dilpofition, on my part, at that jundture, proves, at leaft, that  
my approbation of Mr. Adams has not originated in the difappointm ent,  
to which it has been uncandidly attributed. No private motive could then  
have entered igto it. Not the leaft collifion or mifunde rflanding had ever  
happened between that gentleman and mylelf—on the contrary, as 1 have  
aiteac ty ftated, I had realon individually to be pleafed with him.  
  
‘ No; the confiderations which had reconciled me to the fuccefs of Mr.  
Pisckicy, were of a nature exclufively ublic. They refulted from the dif-  
gufting egotifin, the ciftempered jealouly, and the ungovernable indifcretion  
of Mr. Adams’s temper, joined to fome doubts of the correétne!s of his max-  
ims of adminiftration. T hough in matters of finance he had aéted with the.  
federal party; yct he had, more than once, broached theories at variance  
with his praétice. And in converfation, he repeatedly made excurtions  
into the field of foreign politics, whieh alarmed the friends of the prevail-  
  
ing sty (lem.  
  
The plan of giving equal fupport to the two federal candidates was  
  
not ‘peiefied. Perfopal attachment tor Mr. Adams, efpecially in the New .  
England States, cauled a number of the votes to be withheld from Mr,  
Pinckney, and thrown away. The refult was that Mr. Adams was elected  
Prefident by a majority of two votes, and Mr. Jefferfon Vicc-Prefident.  
  
«© This iffue demonflrated the wildom of the plan which had. been aban-,  
doned, and how greatly, in departing from it, the caule had been facyificed  
to the man. But for a fort of miracle, the departure would have made Mr.  
  
Jefferfon Prefident. In each of the States of Peanly&#x27;y ania, Virginia, and  
~ North  
  
  
  
Hamilton on the public Conduct, (ce. of Mfr. Adams. 463  
  
North Carolina, Mr. Adams had one vote. In the two: letter States, the  
one vote was as much againit the flream of popular prejudice, as it was  
again{t the opimons.of the other Ele¢iors. The frmnels of the individuals,  
Ww vho feparated from their colleagues, was fo extragrdinary, as to have been  
contrary to all probable calculation, Had only one of them thrown his  
vote into the other {cale there would have been an equality and no eckction.  
Had two done it, the choice would have fallen upon Mr. Jetlerfon.  
  
‘* No one, finceye in the opinion that this gentleman was) an inelligible  
and dangerous Candidate, can hefitate m pronouncing, that ta dropping Mr.  
Pinckney, too much was put at hazard ; and that thele who promoted the  
other courte, aéted with prudence and propriety.  
  
“It is a fact, which ought not to be forgotten, that Mr, Adams, who  
haa evinced difcontent, becaufe he had not hen n permitted to take an equal  
chanee with General W afhington, was engaged with all thofe who had  
thought that Mr. Pinckney eught to have had an equal chance with him,  
But im ep tog 1s perfect ‘conliftency. The fame turn of temper is the fo-  
were of the difpleatures in both cafes,  
  
* It is to this circumttance of the equal fupport of Mr. Pinckney, that  
we are ina great mealure to refer the ferious {chilm which has fince grown  
a in the federal party.  
  
‘ Mr. Adams never could forgive the men who had been engaged in the  
plan; though it embraced fome of his moft partial admirers. He has dilco-  
vered bitter animolity again{t jeveral of them. Againft me, his rage has  
been fo vehement, as to have caufed him more than once, to forget the de-  
corum, which, in his fituation, ought to have been an inviolable law. It  
will not appear an exaggeration to thofe who have {ludied his charetter, to  
luppele that he is capable of being alienated from a lyftem to which he hes  
been attached, becaule it is upheld by men whom he hates. How large a  
fhare this may kave had on ome receut aberrations, cannot ealily be deter-  
mined,”’  
  
Mr. Hamilton next adverts to the letter, which, upon Mr. Tho-  
mas Pinckney’s appointment as Envoy to the Court of London,  
Adams wrote to Tench Coxe of Philadelphia, ‘This is truly a molt  
bafe and infamous tranfaction. We fhall give Mr. Hamilton’s ac-  
count of it at length.  
  
“© The letter which has juft appeared in the public prints, written by him,  
while Vice-Prefident, to Tench Coxe, is of itfelf evidence of the juftnels  
of this fentiment. It is impoilible to {peak of this tranfa@ion in terms {uit-  
able to its nature, without lofing fight that Mr, Adams is Prefident of the  
United States.  
  
This letter avows the fufprc m, that the appointment of Mr. Pinckney  
to as Court of London, hi: id been procured or promoted by Britiuth influ-  
ence. And contidering the pari ade with which the ftory of the Duke of  
Leeds is told, it is fair to confider that circumftance as the principal, if not  
the fole, ground of the odious and degrading juipicion.  
  
‘* Let any man of candour or knowledge of the world, pronounce on this  
ipe cies of evidence.  
  
‘ It happened, unfortunately for the Pinckneys, that, while boys, and  
  
ong befare our revolution, they went to fchool with a Britith Duke, who  
was  dfterwards Minifter of the Britifh government: for the forvign dep: It-  
ment. Lhis indilcreey Duke, perhaps for mo better reafon than “the def

of faying fomething to a parting American minifter, and the want of fome.  
thing better to (ay, divulges to him the dangerous fecret, that the two  
Pinckneys had been his clafs-mates, and goes the alarming length of making  
enquiry about their health, From this it is fagacioufly inferred, that thete  
gentlemen have ‘ many powerful old friends in England ;” and from this  
again, that the Duke of Leeds (of courle of the number of thefe old  
friends) had procured by intrigue the sppehounes of one of his clals-  
mates to the Court of London; or, in the language of the letter, that  
much Britifh influence had been exerted in the appointment.  
  
‘© In the {chool of jealoufy, itimulated by ill-will, logic like this may  
  
afs for fubftantial ; but what is it in the {chool of reafon and juftice ?  
  
* Though this contaminating conneftion of the Pinckneys with the  
Duke of Leeds, in their juvenile years, did not hinder them from fighting  
for the independence of their native country throughout our revolution ;  
yet, the fuppofition is, that the inftant the war was terminated, it trans-  
formed thein from the foldiers of liberty into the tools of the Britifh mo-  
narchy.  
  
* But the hoftility of the Pinckneys to Mr. Adams, evidenced by their  
* long intrigue’”’ againft him, of which he {peaks in the letter, is perhaps  
intended as a flill {tronger proof of their devotion to Great Britain—the  
argument may be thus underftood. Mr, Adams is the bulwark of his  
country again{t foreign influence—The batteries of every foreign power,  
defirous of acquiring an afcendant in our affairs, are of confequence always  
open againft him—and, the prefumption therefore muft be, that every ci-  
tizen who is his enemy, is the confederate of one or another of thotc foe  
reign powers.  
  
* Let us, without contefting this argument of felf-love, examine into  
the faéts upon which its applicability muft depend.  
  
“ The evidence of “ the long intrigue’’ feeme to be, that the family of  
the Pinckney’s contributed to limit the duration of Mr. Adams’s commii-  
fion to the Court of London to the term of three years, in order to make  
way for fome of themfelves to fucceed him. This, it muft be confefled,  
was a long-fighted calculation in a government like ours,  
  
‘© A fummary of the tranfaction, will be the beft comment on the in-  
ference which has been drawn.  
  
** The refolution of Congrefs by which Mr. Adams’s commiffion was  
limited, was a general one, applying to the commiffions of all minifters to  
foreign courts. When it was propofed and adopted, it is certain that nei-  
ther of the two Pinckney’s was a member of Congre{s; and it is believed  
they were both at Charlefton, in South Carolina, their ufual place of  
abode, more than eight hundred miles diftant from the feat of government.  
  
** Bus they had, it feems, a coujin, Mr. Charles Pinckney, who was in  
congrels ; and this coufin it was who fupported the reftri€tive refolution.  
Let us enquire who feconded and voted for it.  
  
** It was feconded by Mr. Howell, a member from Rhode Ifland, the  
wery perfon who nominated Mr, Adams as Minifler to Great Britain, and was  
voted for by the four eaftern ftates, with New York, New Jeriey, Mary-  
land, and South Carolina. Mr. Gerry, always a zealous partizan of Mr.  
Adams, was among the {upporters of the refolution. To make out this to  
be a machination of the two Pinckneys, many things muft be afirmed :—  
Firft, that their coufin Charles is always fubfervient to their views (which  
would equally prove that they have long been, and ftill are, oppoters .

‘Hamilton on the public Condué, &amp;c. of Mr. Adams, 465  
  
the federal adminiftration :)—Second. that this cunning wight has been  
able to draw the four eaflern flates into his plot, a$ well as New York, New  
Jerfey, Maryland, and South Carolina :—Third, that the Pinckneys could  
forefee, at the diftance of three years, the exiftence of a ftate of things  
which would enable them to reap the fruit of their contrivance.  
  
* Would not the circumftances better warrant the fulpicion that the re  
folution was a contrivance of the friends of Mr. Adams, to facilitate in  
fome way his eleét: ion, and that Mr. Pinckney was their coadjutor, rather  
than their apa er  
  
‘¢ But the truth al probably is, that the meafure was a mere precau-  
tion to bring under frequent review the e propriety of continuing a minifter  
at a particular court, and to facilitate the removal of a difagrecable one,  
without the harfhnels of formally difplacing him. In a policy of this  
fort, the cautious maxims of New England would very naturally have  
taken a lead.  
  
‘* Thus in the very grounds of the fufpicion, as far as they appear, we  
find its refutation. The complete futility of it will now be illuftrated | ry  
additional circumfltances.  
  
‘ It isa fa&amp;t, that the rigour with which the war was profecuted by the  
Britith armies in our fouthern quarter, had produced among the friends of  
our revolution there, more animofity againft the Britifh government, than  
in the other parts of the U nited States: and it Is a matter of notortety, in  
the fame quarter, that this difpofition was conipi icuous among the Pinck  
neys, and their conneftions. It mav be added, that they were lkewile  
known to have been attached to the French Revolution, and to ea con-  
tinued fo, till long after the appoiatment of Mr, Thomas Pinckney to the  
Court of London.  
  
‘* Thefe propenfi fities of the gentlemen were certainly not fuch as to  
make them favourites of Great Britain, or the appointment of one of them  
to that court, an Objeét of particular folicitude.  
  
‘ As far as appeared at the time, the idea of nominating Mr. Thomas  
ie kney, originated with the then Prefident himiclf: but whatever way  
have been its lource, it is certain that it met the ap probation of the whole  
adminiftration, Mr. Jeflerfon included, This fatt alone, will go far to res  
fute the farmife of a Britifh agency in the appointment.  
  
“ ouppenng that, contrary to all probability, Great Britain bad really  
taken fome unaccountable fancy for Mr. Pinckney, upon whom was hex

his conduét towards that court would have been marked, if not by Some  
improper compliances, at leaft by fome dilplays of extraordinary complai.  
fance.  
  
“ Yet, ftrange as it may appear, upon Mr, Adams&#x27;s hypothefis, it might  
be proved, if requifite, that neither the one nor the other took place. It  
might be — that, far from Mr. Pinckncy’s having experienced any  
flattering diftin€tions, incidents not pleafant to his feelings, had occurred,  
and that in the difcharge of his official funétions, he had advanced _preten-  
fions in favour of the United States, from which, with the approbation of  
the then Secretary of State, Mr. Jefferion, -he was inflruGed to defift.  
  
“ What will Mr. Adams or his friends reply to all thefle fats ? How  
will he be exculfed for indulging and declaring, on grounds fo frivolous,  
a fufpicion fo derogatory, of a man fo meritorious—of a man who has aéted  
in a manner jo unexceptionable ?  
  
« But a more ferious queftion remains: How will Mr. Adams an{wer to  
the government and to his country, for having thus wantonly given the  
fan&amp;ion of his opinion to the worlt of the afperfions which the enemies of  
the adminiftration have impudently thrown upon it? Can we be furprifed  
that fuch a torrent of flander was poured out again{t it, when a man, the  
fecond in official rank, the fecond in the favour of the friends of the go-  
vernment, {tooped to become himlelf one of its calumniators ?—ZJt is pe-  
cuharly unlucky for Mr. Adams in this affair, that uz Himsetr is known to  
have dejired, at the tune, the appointment which was given to Mr. Pinckney.  
The Prefident declined the meaiure, thinking that it was compatible neither  
with the fpirit of the con{titution nor with the dignity of the Government,  
to defignate the Vice-Prefident to fuch a f{tation.

«¢ Tt will be recoile&amp;ted that General Pinckney, the brother of Thomas,  
and the gentleman now tupported together with Mr. Adams, had been  
deputed by Prefident Wafhington, as tucceifor to Mr. Monroe, and had  
been refufed to be received by the French government in his quality of  
Minifter Plenipotentiary.  
  
‘ This, among thole of the well-informed, who felt a juft fenfibility for  
the honour of their country, excited much difguft and refentment. But  
the oppofition-party, ever too ready to jutlify the French government at  
the expence of their own, vindicated or apologized for the ill-treatment :  
and the mafs of the community, though dilpleated with it, did not appeai  
to feel the full force of the indignity.  
  
** Asa final eflort for accommodation, and asa mean, in cafe of failure,  
ef enlightening and combining public opinion, it was relolved to make  
another anda more folemn experiment, in the form of a commillion of  
three,  
  
66 This  
  
Hamilton on the public Condu&amp;, &amp;c. of Mr. Adams. 467  
  
This meafure (with fome objections to the detail) was approved by  
all parties ; by the Anti-federalifts, becaufe they thought no evil fo great as  
the rupture with France; by the Federalifts, becaufe it was their fyftem to  
avoid war with every power, if it could be done without the facrifice of  
elfential interefts or abfolute humiltation,  
  
** Even fuch of them who conceived that the infults of the French go.  
vernment, and the manifeftation of its ill will, had already gone far  
enough to call for meafures of vigour; perceiving that the nation was not  
generally penetrated with the fame convittion, and would not fupport with  
zeal, mealures of that nature, unle{s their neceflity was rendered {till more  
apparent, acquiefced in the expediency of another miflion, They hoped  
that it would ierve either to compole the differences which exifted, or to  
make the neceflity of refiftance to the violence of France, palpable to every  
good citizen.  
  
“© The expediency of the ftep was fuggefled to Mr. Adams, through a  
federal channel, a confiderable time before he determined to take it. He  
hefitated whether it could be done after the rejection of General Pinckney,  
without national debalement. ‘lhe doubt was an honourable one; it was  
afterwards very properly furrendered to the cogent reafons which pleaded  
for a further experiment.  
  
* The event of this experiment is frefh in our_recolle&amp;ion, Our en-  
voys, like our minifter, were rejected. ‘Tribute was demanded as a preli-  
minary to negociation. ‘To their immortal honour, though France at the  
time was proudly triumphant, they repelled the dilgraceful pretenfion,  
Americans will never forget that General Pinckney was a member, and an  
efficient member, of this commiffion.  
  
‘© This conduét of the French government, in which it is difficult to fay,  
whether defpotic infolence or unblufhing corruption was moft prominent,  
ele&amp;trified the American people with a becoming indignation. In vain the  
partizans of France attempted to extenuate, ‘The public voice was difting&amp;  
and audible. The nation, difdaining {fo foul an overture, was ready to en-  
counter the worft coniequences of refiftance,  
  
‘© Without imitating the flatterers of Mr. Adams, who, in derogation  
from the intrinfic force of circumftances, and from the magnanimity of the  
nation, alcribe to him the whole merits of producing the {pirit which ap-  
peared in the community, it fhall with cheerfulnefs be acknowledged, that  
he took upon the occafion a manly and courageous lead—that he did all in  
his power to roufe the pride of the nation—to in{pire it with a juft fenfe  
of the injuries and outrages which it had experienced, and to difpofe it to  
a firm and magnanimous refiftance ; and that his eflorts contributed materi  
ally to the end.  
  
“© The friends of the government were not agreed as to ulterior meafures.  
Some were for immediate and unqualified war; others for a more mitigated  
courfe; the diffolution of treaties, preparation of force by land and fea,  
partial hoftilities of a defenfive tendency ; leaving to France the option of  
fecking accommodation, or proceeding to open war, The latter courle  
  
revailed,  
  
‘© Though not as bold and energetic as the other; yet, confidering the  
profperous ftate of French affairs, when it was adopted, and how many  
nations had been apalled and proftrated by the French power—the conduét  
purfued bore fufficiently the marks of courage and elevation to raife the  
national charaéter to an exalted height throughout Europe,

* Much is it to be deplored that we thould have been precipitated  
i m this proud eminence without neceility, without temptation.  
  
‘* The latter conduct of the | refident torms a painful contraft to his com-  
mencement. Its ettects have been dircétly the reverfe. It has funk the  
tone of the public mind—it has impaired the confidence of the friends of  
the government in the Executive Chief—it has dittraéted public opinion—  
it has unnerved the public councils—it has fown the feeds of difcord at  
home, and lowered the reputation of the government abroad. —The circum-  
ftances which preceded, aggravate the dif, igreeablenefs of the refults. They  
prove that the injudicious ‘things which have been aéted, were not the  
effects of any regular plan, but. the fortuitous emanations of momentary  
impulfes.  
  
« The feilion, which enfued the promulgation of the difpatches of our  
eommilloners, was about to commence, Mr. Adams arrived at Philadel-  
phia from his feat at Quincey. The tone of his mind feemed to have been  
raifed, rather than depre ited.  
  
« Tt was fuggetted to him, that it might be expedient to infert in his  
Speech of Congref., a fentiment of this import: That after the re peatedly  
rejected advances of this country, its dignity requres that it fhould be lett  
with F age in future to make the firft overture ; that if, defirous of recon-  
ciliation, the flrould evince the difpofition by Se nding a minifter to this  
government, be would be received with the retpect Reis to his charatter,  
ai nd treated with in the franknets of a fincere defire of accommodation.  
  
‘Lhe fuggettion was received in a manner both indignant and intem-  
perate,  
  
«© Mr, Adams declared as a fe atime nt, whic h he had adopted on mature  
reflection :— That if France Jhould fend a Mirifler to-morrow, he would ories  
bun hack the duy after.  
  
* SO meuudens an idea was eafily refuted. Little argument was requi-  
hte to ihew that by a fimilar fyftem of revaliation, when one governme nt in  
a particular intiance had refuted the envoy of another, nations might ent ail  
upon each other perpetual hoftility ; mutually barring the avenues of  
planation.  
  
« Ty lefs than forty-eight hours from this extraordinary fally, the mind  
of Mr. Adams underwent a total revolution—he refolved not only to infert  
in his tpeeeh the fentiment which hi = been propofed to him, but to go far-  
ther, and to. declare, that if France would give oxplicit offurances of receiving  
a Minijer from this country, with due “re tt, bi eveuld fe nd one.  
  
« Th vain was this extenfion of the fentiment oppoted by all his minifters,  
as being equally incompatible with good policy, and with the dignity ot  
the natlon—he obitinately perfilte d, and the pernicious declarauon was  
introduced.”

proper to be employed, and who would be likely to fucceed; which was  
exceptionable, both as it favored of the pretention (juftly cenfured by the  
Prefident himfelf) of prefcribing to other Governments how they were to  
manage their own affairs; and as it might, according to circurnftances, be  
conftrued into a tacit condition of the promiie to mae, a Minitter, Ov re  
tures fo circuitous and informal, through a perfon who&#x27;wo&quot; not the regular  
organ of the French government for making them, to a perton who was  
not the regular organ of the American government for receiving them,  
might be a very fit mode of preparing t&#x27;e way tor the like overtures in a  
more authentic and obligatory thape: but they were a very inadequate  
bafis for the inftitution of a new miflion.  
  
“ When the Prefident pledged hinitelf in his fpeech to fend a minifter,  
if fatisfactory affurances of a proper reception were given, he mutt have  
been underftood to mean fuch as were direct and official, not tuch as were  
‘both informal and deftitute of a competent fanétion,  
  
‘© Yet upon this loofe and vague foundation, Mr. Adams precipitately  
nominated Mr. Murray as Envoy to the French Republic, without previous  
confultation with any of his minifters. ‘The nomination itfelf was to each of  
them, even to the Secretary of State, his Conititutional Counfcllor, in fimi-  
lar affairs, the firft notice of the project.  
  
Thus was the meature wrong, both as to mode and fubftance.  
  
A Prefident is not bound to conform to the advice of his Minifters,  
He is even under no pofitive injun@tion to atk or require it. But the con-  
ftitution prefumes that he will confult them; and the genius of our govern-  
ment and the wri, good recommend the practice.  
  
«© As the Prefident nominates his minifters, and may difplace them when  
he peate 5, it mutt be his own fault if he be not furrounded by men, who  
for ability and integrity deferve his confidence. And if his minifters are of  
this character, the confulting of them will always be likely to be ufeful to  
him and to the ftate. Let it even be fu ppofe d that he is a man of  
talents fuperior to the colleéted talents of all his age (which can  
feldom happen, as the world has feen but few Fredericks), he may, never-  
thelefs, often aflift his judgment by a comparifon and colltion of ide  
The greateft genius, hurried away by the rapidity of its own co scented,  
willoc cafionally overlook obftacles which ordinary and more phlegmatie men  
will difcover, and which, when preiented te his confideration, will be  
thought by hintelf decifive objections to his plans.  
  
« When, unhappily, an ordinary man dre ome himfelf to be a Frederick,  
and through vanity refrains from counfelliye with his conftitutional advi-  
fers, he is very apt to fall into the hands ot miferable -otriguers, with whom  
his felf-love is more at eafe, and who without difficulty flide into his con-  
fidence, and, by flattery, govern him.  
  
“© ‘The ableit men may profit by advice, Inferior men cannot difpence  
with it; and if they do not get it through legitimate channels, it will tind  
its way to them, through iach as are clandefiine and impure.  
  
* Very different trom the practice of Mr, Adams was that of the modeft  
and fage Wafhington—He conlulted much, pondered much, refolved  
flowly, refolved furely,  
  
“And as furely, Mr. Adams might have benefitted by the advice of his  
minitters,

ther difadvantage. It will tend to exclude from places of primary truft, the  
men moft fit to occupy them.  
  
«* Few and feeble are the interefted inducements to accept a place in our  
adminiftration. Far from being lucrative, there is not one which will not  
involve pecuniary facrifice to every bone/? man of pre-eminent talents. And  
has not experience fhewn, that he muft be fortunate indeed, if even the fuc-  
cefsful execution of his tafk can fecure to him confideration and fame? Of  
a large harveft of obloque he is fure.  
  
“ If excluded from the counfels of the I-xecutive Chief, his office muft  
become tiuly infignificant.. What able and virtuous man will long confent  
to be to miferable a pageant!  
  
** Every thing that tends to banith from the adminiftration able men, tends  
to diminith the chances of able connfels. The probable operation of a ty!-  
tem of this kind, muft be to coufign places of the higheft truit to incapable  
honeit men, whofe inducement w ill be a hvelihood, or to capable difhoneft  
men, who will feek indire&amp;t indemnifications tor the deficiency of direc  
and fair in ‘ucements.  
  
‘ The precipitate nomination of Mr. Murray, brought Mr. Adams in an  
awkward predicament.  
  
“ He found it neceflary to chanve his plan in its progrefs, and inftead of  
one to nominate three envoys, and to tuperadd a promife, that, though  
appointed, they fhould not Jeave the United State til] further and more per-  
fect aflurances were giyen by the French government.  
  
“ This remodification of the meafures was a virtual acknowledgment that  
it had been premature. How unfeemly was this fluctuation in the Execu-  
tive Chief. It argued either inftability of views, or want of fufficient con-  
fideration beforehand. ‘The one or the other, in an affair of fo great mo-  
ment, is a ferious reproach.  
  
*¢ Additional and more competent aflurances were received; but before  
the envoys departed, intelligence arrived of a new revolution in the French  
government; which, in violation of the conftitution, had expelled two of  
the Directory.  
  
‘ Another revolution: another conftitution overthrown: furely here  
was reafon fora paufe, at leaft till it was afcertained that the new Di-  
re€tory would adhere to the engazement of its predeceffors, and would not  
fend back our envoys with difer ace  
  
“In the then polture of French atfairs, which externally as well as inter-  
nally, were unprofperous, a paufe was every way prudent. The recent re-  
volution was a valid motive for it.  
  
 Detimtive compaéts between nations, called real treaties, are binding,  
notwithtiavding revolutions of governmenis. Kut to apply the maxim to  
minifterial acts, preparatory only to negociation, is to extend it too far; to  
apply it to fuch-aéts of an unttable revolutionary government (like that of  
France at that time) is to abufe it.  
  
*€ Had any policy of the moment demanded it, it would have been not  
at all furprifing to have feen the new Directory difavowing the affurance  
which had been given, and imputing it as a crime to the Ex- Direétors, on  
the pretence that they had proftrated the dignity of the republic by court-  
ing the renewal of negociation with a government, which had fo grofsly  
iniulted it.

which he afterwards wrote from the fame place, he dire€ted the prepara-

parture would be fufpended for jome time.  
  
“ Shortly after he came to&#x27;‘Trenton, where he adjufted with his minitfters  
the tenor of the infiructions tobe given ; but he obferved a profound filence

The morning after the infractions were fettled, he fignified to the Secretary  
of State that the envoys were immediately to depart.”

« The difmiffion of the Secretary at War took place about the fame

pain, for the weak and excellive inditcretions of a chief magittrate of the

A prominent charge was, that the fecretary, In a Report to the Houfe

eulogize General Hamilion, w hich was adduced as one proof of a combina-

ere related of Adams, we are deceived if he was the only one,  
who proter’ sd forrow, and actually put on the fable weeds, tor the  
death of Wathington, and who fee retly rejoiced at the event.  
  
The laft matcrial occurrence, whi ich our Author notices in the ad-  
miniftration of Vir. Adams, is, his pardon ot Fries, and other capi-  
tal offenders, in the infurrection which took place in the State of  
Pennfylyania, du ring the {pring of the year 1799, and which was  
gener ally thought to have been encouraged by the pardoning of the  
offenders in the former infurreétion in that State.  
  
‘The impunity, fo often experienced, had made it an article in the creed  
of thofe who were actuated by the infurgent fpirit, that neither the Ge-  
neral nor the State Government dared to inflict capital punithment.  
  
‘© Yo dettroy this perfu ifion, to reprets this dangerous {pirit, it was effen-  
ia} that a falutary rigor tho ald have been exerted, and that thoie «ho wet  
under the influence of the one and the other fhould be taught that they  
were the dupes of a fatal illufion,  
  
« Of this, Mr. Adams appeared fo fenfible, that wile the trials cvere  
pend gs he more than once imprudently threw out, that the accufed muk  
found their hopes of efcape either in their innocence or in the lenity of the

againit the unanimous advice of his minifiers, with the Attorney-General,  
came to the refolution, which he executed, of pardoning all thote who had  
received fentence of death.  
  
‘“ No wonder that the public was thunderftruck at fuch a refult—that

Prefident, Mr. Hamilton ably defends himfelf again{t the charge of  
having entertained an unwarrantable bias in favour ot foreign nations,  
and concludes his very excellent pamphlet in the tollowing words :  
  
The ttatement which has been made, fhews that Mr. Adams has come  
mitted fome pofitive and {crious errors of rdaadireies: that in ad ition  
to thefe, he has certain fixed points of character which tend naturally to  
the detriment of any caute, of which he ts the chief, of any adminifiration  
of which he is the head ; that by his if humors and jealoufies he has already  
divided and diftra@ted the fupporters of the government; that he has fur-  
nithed deadly weapons to its enemies by untounded aceufations, and has  
weakened the force of its friends by det rying fome of the molt influential  
of them to the utmoft of his power; and, letit be added, as the nec effary  
  
etfedt of fuch conduc, that he has mace great progre{s in undermining  
the ground which was gained for the government by his predecefior, and  
that there is real caufe io apprehead, it might totter, if, not fall, under his

always weak, and muft fi ind a need of the props of a firm and good ad-  
nsiniftration ; till time thall have rendered its authority venerable, and for-  
tified it by habits of obedience.  
“ Yet with this opinion of Mr, Adams, I have finally refulved not to ad+  
vife the withholding from him a fingle vote. The body of Mederalitis, for  
want of fufficient knowledge of facts, are not convinced of the e xpediency  
of relinguifhing him. bt is even apparent, that a large proportion ftill re-  
tain the attachment which was once a common fentiment. ‘Thole of them,  
therefore, who are diffitisfied, as for as my information goes, are, generally  
{peaking, willing to forbear oppotition, and to acquit {ce in the equal up:  
port of Mr. Adams with Mr. Pinckney, whom they preter. Have they not  
a claim to equal defercuce from tho (© who continue attached to the for-  
mer? Ought not thete, in candor, to admit the pofiibility that the friends  
who differ trom them, act not only from pure motives, but from cogent  
reafons? Onght they not, by a co-operation in Gener i! Pinckne vy, to give  
a2 chance for wh it will bea fafe ue, tuppofing that they are right in their  
preference, and the befi iffue, fhould they happen to be mitiaken? ~ Etpe-  
cially, fince by doing this, they will cnereafe the probability of excluding a  
third candidate, of whote unfitnets all fincere Fedensiiie are convinced. It  
they do not purfue this courfe, they will certainly incar an immente re{pon-  
any to their friends and to the government.  
To promote this co-operation, to defend my own character, to vindi-  
cate thofe friends, who with myiclt have been ankindh aiperfed, are the  
inducements for writing this letter. Accordingly, it will be my endeavor  
to regulate the communication of it in tuch a manner as will not be likely  
to deprive Mr. Adams of a tingle vote. Indeed, it is mueh my with that  
its circulation could for ever be confined within narrow limits. 1am fen-  
fible of the inconvemences of giving publicity to a fimilar developement of  
the character of the Chiet Magifirate of our country ; and [lament the ne-  
eefiity of taking a ftep which will involve that refult. Yet to fupprers  
truths, the ditclofure of which ts fo interetting to the public welfare as  
well as to the vindication of my friends and mytelf, did not appear to me  
nee °  
  
‘ The reftraints to which T fubmit, are a proot of my difpofition to facri-  
fice to the prepotleflions of thot a whom | have heretotore thought and  
acted, and trom whom inthe pretest queftion | am compelled to ditier. ‘To  
retrain from a decided opposition to Mr. Adams’s re-election has been re-  
Juétantly fanctioned by my judgment; which has been not a little per-  
plexed between the unqualified conviction of bis unfitne!s tor the tiation  
contemplated; anda fenfe of the great importance of cultivating harmony  
among the tupporters of the government; on whote firm union hereafter  
will probably depend the pretervation of order, tranquillity, liberty, pro-  
perty ; the tecurity of every focial and domettic bletling.

ticipated in the Revolution, a lively sentiment of good-will towards a  
power whose co-operation, however it was, and ought to have been,  
dictated by its own interest, had been extremely useful to us, and had  
been afforded in a liberal and handsome manner; yet, tenacious of the  
real independence of our country, and dreading the preponderance of  
Sor ign influence as the national disease of a popular government, I was  
struck with disgust at the appearance, in the very cradle of our repub-  
lic, of a party actuated by an undue complaisance to a foreign power,  
and I resolved, at once, to resist this bias in our affairs: a resolution  
which has bee 7 the chief cause of the jp rse cution I have endured in the
