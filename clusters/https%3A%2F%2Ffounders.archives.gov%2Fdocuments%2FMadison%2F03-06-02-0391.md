, July 6, 1813.  
I have received from the Committee appointed by the resolution of the Senate of the 14th day of June a copy of that resolution, which authorizes the Committee to confer with the President on the subject of the nomination made by him of a Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden.  
Conceiving it to be my duty to decline the proposed conference with the Committee, and it being uncertain when it may be convenient to explain to the Committee, and thro’ them, to the Senate, the grounds of my so doing, I think it proper to address the explanation directly to the Senate. Without entering into a general review of the relations, in which the constitution has placed the several Departments of the Government to each other, it will suffice to remark that the Executive and Senate in the cases of appointments to office, and of treaties, are to be considered as independent of and coordinate with each other. If they agree the appointments or Treaties are made. If the Senate disagree they fail. If the Senate wish information previous to their final decision, the practice, keeping in view the constitutional relations of the Senate and the Executive, has been, either to request the Executive to furnish it, or to refer the subject to a Committee of their body to communicate either formally or informally with the head of the proper Department. The appointment of a Committee of the Senate to confer immediately with the Executive himself, appears to lose sight of the coordinate relation between the Executive and the Senate which the Constitution has established, and which ought therefore to be maintained.  
The relation between the Senate and House of Representatives in whom Legislative power is concurrently vested, is sufficiently analogous to illustrate that between the Executive and Senate in making appointments and Treaties. The two Houses are in like manner independent of, and coordinate with each other; and the invariable practice of each in appointing committees of conference and consultation is to commission them to confer not with the coordinate body itself, but with a Committee of that body. And altho’ both branches of the Legislature may be too numerous to hold conveniently a conference with committees, were they to be appointed by either to confer with the entire body of the other, it may be fairly presumed that if the whole number of either branch were not too large for the purpose, the objection to such a conference, being against the principle, as derogating from the coordinate relations of the two Houses, would retain all its force.  
I add only that I am entirely persuaded of the purity of the intentions of the Senate, in the course they have pursued on this occasion, and with which my view of the subject makes it my duty not to accord: and that they will be cheerfully furnished with all the suitable information in possession of the Executive, in any mode deemed consistent with the principles of the Constitution, and the settled practice under it.

rectly to tne senate. VVitln.ut entering into a general  
review of the relations in which the constitution lias

.been, ehiier to request the executive to furnish it, or

ecutive himself, appears to lose sight of the co-ordinate  
relation between the executive and the senate, which  
&gt;the constitution has established, and which ought there­  
fore to be maintained. °  
m The relation between the senate and house of repre­

Conceiving it to be try duty to line

The relaiion between the Senate and  
House of Representative*, in whom le­  
gislate power is concurrently vested,  
is sufficient)** an d&#x27;*trou* to illustrate that

Resolved, That the nomination of Jonathan Rus-  
sell, and the motion of Mr. Goldsborough on the  
subject, together with the message of the president  
of the U. States of the 7th inst. with the communi-  
cations therein mentioned, be referred to a commit-  
tee with instruction respectfully to confer with the  
president of the United States upon the subject of  
the said nomination, and report thereon.  
  
Ordered, That Mr. Wells, Mr. Giles and Mr. King  
be the committee.  
  
Tuesday, July 6.—The following written message  
was received from the president of the U. States, by  
  
sar decision, the practice, keeping in view the con-  
stitutional relation of the senate and executive, has  
been, either to request the executive to furnish it,  
or refer the subject to a committee of their body to  
communicate, either formally or informally, with  
the head of the proper department. The appoint-  
ment of 2 committce of the senate to confer imme-  
diately with the executive himself, appears to lose  
sight of the co-ordinate relation between the execu-  
tive and the senate, which the constiiution has estab-  
lished, and which ought therefore to be maintained.  
  
The relation between the senate and house of re-  
presentatives, in whom legislative power is concur-  
rently vested, is sufficiently analogous to illustrate  
that between the executive and senate in making ap-  
poitmenis and treaties. ‘he two houses are in like  
manner independent of and co-ordinate with each  
other; and the invariable practice of each in ap-  
pomting committees of conference and consultation  
is to commission them to confcr not with the co-or-  
dinate body itself, but with a committee of that bo-  
dy. And although both branches of the legislature  
may be too nunierous to hold conveniently a confer-  
ence with committees, were they to be appointed by  
either to confer with the entire body of the other, it  
may be fairly presumed that if the whole number  
of either branch were not too large for the purpose,  
the objection to such a conference, being against the  
principle, as derogatory from the co-ordinate rela-  
tions of the two houses, would retain all its force.  
  
Tadd only that I am entirely persuaded of the  
purity of the intentions of the senate, ta the course  
they have pursued on this occasion, and with which  
my view of the subject makes it my duty not to ae-  
cord: and that they will be cheerfully furnished with  
all the suitable information in possession of the exe-  
cutive, in any mode deemed consistent with the  
principles of the constitution and the settled prac-  
tice under it. JAMES MADISON

proper to add -css the explanation diseclly to the- Senile.  
Without entering into a general review of the relations in  
which the constitution lias placid the several depart m hu

that ill Executive and Senate, in the cases of appointments

lose sight of the co ordinate relation between the Executive  
ami the Senate, which tliWconstitution has established, and  
wihcii ought therefore lone maintained.M  
  
It is here to he remarked, that the President does  
not even intimate that th- re is any express c&lt; nstitution­  
al inhibition; of a respectful conference, between the  
Senate itself, or between a Committee acting on the  
part of the Senate, and the Executive upon subjects ot  
their concurrent jurisdiction ; but infer* &#x27;ts impropriety  
from the consideration, that “ the Executive, and Se  
uate in cases of appointments to cilice, and tieniUs, art  
to be considered independent, and c.-ordinate with each

of proceeding i f the Senate on ordinary occasions con­  
cludes.

i * I have received from the committee appointed by  
the resolution of the Senate of tlie I4th day of June, a  
copy of that ivsolution which authorises the committee  
to confer with the president on the subject of the no­  
mination made by him of a minister plenipotentiary to  
Sweden, s- _4,  
&quot; Conceiving it to be my duty to decline the proposed  
conference with the committee, and it being uncertain  
wh»n it mar be convenient to explain to the committee,  
s&gt;n! through them to* the senate, the grounds of my so  
doing, I think it proper to address the explanation di­  
rectly to the Senate* Witbon (Centering into a general  
review of the relations in which the constitution has  
placed the several departments of the governments to  
eltch other, it will suffice to remark, that the Exicutive  
and Senate, in the cases of appointment*&#x27;to office and of  
treaties, are to be considered independent and co-ordi­  
nate with each other. If they agree, the appointments  
pt treaties are made. If the senate disagree, they  
foil. If the senate wish &quot;information previous to their  
,final decision, the practice, keeping in viewthe conali­  
iutfonal relation of the senate and executive, has been,  
eiu.er to request th» executive to futoish it, to refer the  
subject to a committee of their body to communicaic,  
either fo?maHy or informally, with the head of the pro­  
per department. The appointment&#x27;of a committee of  
the senate, to confer immediately with the executive  
himself, appears to lose sight of the co-ordinate reiati­  
ou between tl.e executive and the senate, which the con­  
stitution has established!, and which ought therefore to  
be maintained,’*  
It is here to be remarked, that the presidentdoes not  
evert intimate that there is. any espress constitutional  
inhibition—of a respectful coviferer.ee, between the Se­  
nate itself, or,between a Comipittee acting on the part  
•f the senate, and the executive upon subjects of their  
concurrent jurisdiction—but infers its impropriety from  
the considerations that “the executive and seriate in  
cases of appointments to office, and treaties, are to be

of the senate itself. Nor do I conceive, that the  
presidenthas been more fortunate in aiding his con-  
vlusions, by his illustrations, upon the principle of  
analogy, with the p-oceedings of the two houses of  
congress in relation to their conferences upon disa-  
greeing votes between them. The illustrations are  
contained in the following extract from his message :  
“ The relation between the senate and. house of  
representatives, in whom legislative power is con-  
curently vested, is sufficiently analogous to illustrate  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
dinate body itself, but with a committee of that be-  
dy. And although both branches of the legislature  
inay be too numerous to hold conveniently a confer-  
ence with committees, were they to be appointed by  
either to confer with the entire body of the other, it  
may be fairly presumed that if the whole number of  
either branch were not too large for the purpase, the  
objection to such a conference, being against the  
  
principle as derogatory from the co-ordinate rela-  
  
tions of the two houses, would retain all its force.”
