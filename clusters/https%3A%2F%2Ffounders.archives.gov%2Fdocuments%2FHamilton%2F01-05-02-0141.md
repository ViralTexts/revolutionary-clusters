irtues of Greene are admitted; as a patriot he holds a place in the foremost rank; as a statesman he is praised; as a soldier he is admired. But in the two last characters especially in the last but one his reputation falls far below his desert. It required a longer life and still greater opportunities to have enabled him to exhibit in full day the vast, I had almost said the enormous powers of his mind. The termination of the American war not too soon for his wishes nor for the welfare of his country, but too soon for his glory, put an end to his military carreer. The sudden termination of his life cut him off from those scenes, which the progress of a new

To attribute to him a portion of the praise which is due as well to the formation as to the execution of the plans that affected these important ends, can be no derogation from that wisdom and magnanimity which knew how to select and embrace councils worthy of being pursued.

rs, elated by pursuit and ardent to signalise their courage. Tis enough for the honor of Greene to say that he left nothing unessayed to avert and to frustrate so degrading a resolution. And it was happy for America that the man, whose reputation could not be wounded without wounding the cause of his Country, had the noble fortitude to rescue himself and the army he commanded from the disgrace with which they were both menaced by the characteristic imbecility of a Council of War.  
Unwilling to do more than merely to glance at a scene in which the meritorious might be involved with the guilty in promiscuous censure here let me drop the Curtain and invite You to accompany me to the Heights of Monmouth. There let me recall to your indignant view the flower of the American infantry flying before an enemy that scarcely dared to pursue—vanquished without a blow—vanquished by their obedience to the command of a leader who meditated their disgrace.
