Feby. 2. 1831  
  
  
  
I have recd. your letter of Jany. 21 asking   
1. Is there any State power to make Banks?  
2. Is the Federal power as it has been exercized, or as proposed to be exercised by President Jackson,  
preferable?  
The evil which produced the prohibitory clause in the Constitution of the U.S. was the practice of the States  
in making Bills of credit, and in some instances appraized property, &quot;a legal tender&quot;. If the notes of State Banks  
therefore, whether chartered or unchartered be made a legal tender, they are prohibited: if not made a legal tender, they  
do not fall within the prohibitory clause. The No. of the &quot;Federalist&quot;. referred to was written with that view of the  
subject; and this, with probably other cotemporary expositions, and the uninterrupted practice of the States in creating  
&amp; permiting Banks, without making their notes a legal tender, would seem to be a bar to the question, if it were  
not inexpedient now to agitate it.  
A virtual and incidental enforcement of the depreciated notes of State Banks, by their crowding out a sound  
medium, tho’ a great evil, was not foreseen; and if it had been apprehended, it is questionable whether the Constitution  
of the U.S. which had so many obstacles to encounter would have ventured to guard against it, by an additional obstacle. A  
virtual, and it is hoped an adequate remedy, may hereafter be found in the refusal of State paper when debased, in any  
of the Federal transactions, and in the controul of the Federal Bank, this being itself countrouled from suspending its  
specie payments by the Public authority.  
On the other question I readily decide against the project recommended by the President. Reasons more than  
sufficient appear to have been presented to the Public in the Reviews and other comments which it has called forth. How  
far a hint for it may have been taken from Mr. Jefferson I know not. The kindred ideas of the latter may be seen in his  
Memoirs &amp;c. Vol. 4. p. 196. 207. 526. and his view of the State Banks. Vol. 4. p. 199 &amp; 220.  
There are sundry Statutes of Virga. prohibiting the circulation of notes payable to bearer, whether issued by  
individuals, or unchartered Banks.  
These observations, little new or important as they may be, would have been more promptly furnished, but for  
an indisposition in which your letter found me, and which has not yet entirely left me. I hope this will find you in good  
health, and you have my best wishes for its continuance, and the addition of every other blessing.

Montpelier, Feb. 2, 1831.  
Dear Sir : I nave received your let  
ter of Jan. 21, asking:  
K Is there any state power to make  
banks?  
2. Is the federal power as has been  
exercised, or as proposed to be-exercised  
by President Jackson, preferable ?  
ry clause in the constitution ef the Uni  
ted States, was the practice ofthe States  
in making bills of credit; and in some in  
stances app aised property &quot;a legal ten  
der.&quot; If the notes ot state uanKs there  
fore, whether chartered or unchartered,  
be made a legal tender, they are prohib­  
ted ; if not made a regal tender, they do  
not fall within the prohibitory clause.  
The- No. Of the Federalist&quot; referred  
to was written with that view of the sub  
ject ; and this, with probably other con-  
temporary expositions ami un; uuuiw  
runted practice of -the states ia creating  
and permitting Banks without making  
fneir wtes alegai tewler, would seem to  
be a bar to tb question, if it were not ia

and if it had been apprehended, it is ques-  
  
S. which had so many obsfaete3 to en­  
counter, would have ventured to guard  
agalrist it by the additional provision-  
A virtual, ami it i9 hoped, an adequate  
remedy, may hereafter be found in the  
refusal cf State, paper when debased, iiv ,  
any of the federal transactions, and in  
the control of the Federal Bank, thU be­  
ing itself controlled from suspending it  
specie payments by the public authority.  
, 0;i the other question. I rxadily decide,  
ag-unst the proje-ct recommended by thV  
President. Reasons more jhan sufficient  
appear to have been presented to the pub­  
lic in the reviews and other comments,  
which it ha&#x27;3 called-forth. How far a  
hint for i.tmay have been taken from Mi.  
Jefferson t know not. The kindred ideas,  
ef the latter may be seen in his memoirs  
Sic- vol. 4. pl96&#x27;2ar, 520, and his  
view of the State Banks, vol. 4 p. 1X.  
.:o.  
There- are sundry statutes of Virginia  
prohibiting the circulation of notes pay a-  
  
oie to Dearer,r whether issued by individu­  
als or unchartered Banks.  
These observations, little new or im­  
portant as they may be, would have been  
promptly fu-rnished, but for an indisposi­  
ticri in which your letter found mc, &quot; and;  
which has not yet entirely left me. I  
hnpe this will find you in good healths  
and you have my best wishes for its con­  
tinuance,, and, the addition of every other  
Messing.
