DENCE WITH MR. ROSE ON  
THE SAME SUBJECT.  
  
Yo the Senate and House of Repre-  
sentatives of the United Staies.  
  
AT the opening of the present  
session, I informed the legislature  
that the measures which had been  
taken with the government of Great  
Britain for the settlement ofour neu-  
tral and national rights, and of the  
conditions of commercial inter-  
  
course With that nation, had resulted  
in articles of a treaty, which could  
not be acceded to on our part;  
that instructions had consequently  
been sent to our ministers there  
to resume the negotiations, and  
  
to endeavour to obtain certain al-  
terations, and that this was inter-  
rupted by the transaction which  
took place between the frigates  
Leopard and Chesapeake: the  
call on that government for repa-  
ration of this wrong produced, as  
congress have been already inform-  
ed, the mission of a special minis-  
ter to this country ; and the occa-  
sion is now arrived, when the pub-  
lic interest permits and requires  
that the whole of these proceed-  
ings should be made known to you.  
I therefore now communicate  
the instructions given to our mi-  
nister resident at London, and his  
communications to that govern-  
ment on the subject of the Chesa-  
peake, with the correspondence  
which has taken place here be-  
tween the secretary of state and  
Mr. Rose, the special .minister  
charged with the adjustment of  
that difference; the instructions  
to our ministers for the formation.  
of a treaty; their correspondence  
  
-with the British commissioners,  
  
and with their own government on  
that subject; the treaty itself, and  
  
.  
  
388  
  
written declaration of the British  
commissioners accompanying it;  
and the instructions given by us for  
resuming the negotiation, with the  
proceedings and correspondence  
subsequent thereto. Tothese I have  
added a letter lately addressed to  
the secretary of state, from one of  
our late ministers, which, though  
not strictly written in an official  
character, I think it my duty to  
communicate, in order that his  
views of the proposed treaty, and  
of its several articles, may be  
fairly presented and understood.  
Although I have heretofore,  
and from.time to time, made such  
communications to congress as to  
keep them possessed of a general  
and just view of the proceedings  
and dispositions of the government  
of France towards this country,  
yet, in our present critical situa-  
tion, when we find tat no conduct  
on our part, however impartial  
and friendly, bas been sufficient to  
ensure, from either beiligerent, a  
just respect for our rights, [ am  
desirous that nothing shall be  
omitted on my part which may  
add to your information on this  
subject, or contribute to the cor-  
rectness of the views which should  
be formed. The papers which,  
for these reasons, I now lay before  
you, embrace all the communica-  
tions, official or verbal, from the  
French government, respecting  
the general relations between the  
two countries, which have been  
transmitted through our minister  
there, or through any other accre-  
dited channel, since the lasts ession  
of congress, to which time ail in-  
formation of the same kitid had,  
from time to time, been given  
them. Someofthese papers have  
already been submitted to con-  
gress ; but itis thought better to ol-  
fer them again, m order that the  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER.  
  
chain of communications, of which  
they make a part, may be present-  
ed unbroken.  
  
When, on the 26th February,  
I communicated to both houses  
the letter of general Armstrong to  
M. Champagny, I desired it  
might not be published, because  
of the tendency of that practice to  
restrain injuriously the freedom  
of our foreign correspondence.  
But perceiving that this caution,  
proceeding purely from a regard  
to the public good, has furnished  
occasion for disseminating un-  
founded suspicions and insinua-  
tions, I am induced to believe  
that the good which will now re-  
sult from its publication, by con-  
firming the confidence and union  
of our fellow-citizens, will more  
than countervail the ordinary ob-  
jection to such publications. It  
is my wish, therefore, that it may  
be now published.

the measures which had been taken

for the settlement of our neutral and

on our part; that instructions had  
consequently been sent to our minis-

and to endeavor to obtain certain al-

ed by the transaction which took  
place between the frigates Leopard  
and Chesapeake. The call on that  
  
government - for reparation of this  
  
wrong produced, as Congress has  
been already informed, the mission of  
a. special Minister to this country,  
and the occasion is now arrived, when  
the public interest permits and re-  
quires, that the whole of these pro-  
ceedingsshould bemadeknowntoyou.  
_ [ therefore now communicate the  
instructions given to our Minister re-  
sident at London, and his communi~  
cations to that government, on the  
subject of the Chesapeake, with the  
correspondence which has taken place  
here between the Secretary of State  
and Mr. Rose, the special Minister  
charged with the adjustment of that  
difference ; the instructions to our  
Ministers for the formation of a trea-  
ty; their correspondence with the  
British .commissioners, and with  
theit own government on that sub.  
ject ; the treaty itself and written de-  
claration of the British Commission~

th  
  
  
  
tions given by us for resuming the  
negociation,with the proceedings and.  
correspondence subsequent thereto.

addressed to the Secretary of State  
from one of our late ministers, which  
though not strictly written in an offi-  
cial character, I think it my duty to  
communicate, in order that his views  
of the proposed treaty, and of its se-  
veral articles, may be fairly presented

Although I have heretofore, and  
from time to time, made such com-  
munications to congress, as to keep  
them possessed of a general and just  
view of the proceedings and disposi-  
tions of the government of France  
towards this country, yet in our pre-  
sent critical situation, when we find  
that no conduct on our part, however  
impartial and friendly, has been suf-  
ficient to insure, from either bellige  
rent, a just respect for our rights, I  
am desirous that nothing shall be o.  
mitted on my part, which may add to  
your information on this subject, or  
contribute to the correctness of the  
views which should be formed. The  
papers which for these reasons, I  
now lay before you, embrace all the  
communications, official or verbal,  
from the French government, re2-

At the opening of the present session, I inform­  
ed t&#x27;iie legislature that the measures which had been  
♦aHen w ith the government of Ore it-Bi itam for the  
srUlem-ntot our neutral and national rights, and  
ot the condition of commercial intercourse with that  
■-‘••on. 1...J resulted in articles of a treaty which  
f i not be acceded to on our part; that instruc  
tions had L”en consequently sent to our ministers  
there to resume the negotiations, and to endeavour  
to obtain certain alterations ; and that this was in­  
terrupted by the transaction which took place be­  
tween the (l igates l.eopard and Chesapeake. The  
call on that government for the reparation of this  
Wrong, produced, as congress have been already in­  
funned, the mission ot a special minister to this  
country; and the occasion is now arrived when the  
publick interest permits and requires that the whole  
ot the proceedings should be made known to you.  
1 then-lore now communicate the instructions  
given to our minister resident at London, and hb  
cumniun’cations with that government on the sub­  
ject of the Chesapeake, with the correspondence  
which has taken place here between the secretary  
oi state and Mr. llose, the special minister charg­  
ed with the adjustment of that difference; the in-*  
struetinns to our ministers for the formation of a  
treaty ; the:r correspondence with the British com­  
ma sioneis and with their own government on that  
•object; the treaty itself, and written declaration  
of the It, itisb commissioners accompanying it; and  
tbe mstructi&#x27;-ns given by us for resuming the ne­  
gotiation, with ilia proceedings and correspondence  
subsequent thereto : to these 1 have added a letter  
lately addressed to the secretary of state from one  
of our late ministers,* which, thongh not strictly  
wriuen in an official character, I think it my duty  
to communicate, in order that Ins views of the  
r- posed treaty, and of its several articles, may be  
  
I..:: :v presented and understood.  
Although I have heretofore, and from time to  
time, marie such communications to congress as to  
ke. p them possessed of a general and just view of  
the proceedings and dispositions of the government  
of France towards this country, yet, in onr present  
critical situation, when tve find that no conduct on  
©nr part, however impartial and friendly, lias been  
audio lent to insure from either belligerent a just res­  
pect lor our rights, I am desirous that nothing  
shall he omitted on my part which may add to  
your information on this subject, or contribute to  
the correctness of the views which should he form­  
ed. Tire papers, which for these reasons I now lay  
before you, embrace all the communications, offici­  
al or verbal, from the French government, respect­  
ing the general relations between the two count; ies,  
which have been transmitted through our minister  
there, or through any other accredited channel  
since the last session of congress, to which time all  
intorm.ition*of the same kind had from time to time  
been given them.—Some of these papers have al­  
ready been submitted to congress ; hut it is thought  
better to other them again, in order that the chain  
or communications, of which they form a part,  
may he presented unbroken.  
When, on the t&gt;6&#x27;ih February, f communicated  
to both houses the letter of general Armstrong to  
M. Champagny, I desired it might not be publish­  
ed, because of the tendency of that practice to res­  
train, injuriously, the freedom of our foreign cor­  
respondence. But perceiving that this caution,  
proceeding purely Irom a regard to the public good,  
has furnished ocrasion for unfounded suspicions and  
insinuations, I am induced to believe that the good  
which will now result from its publication, bv con  
firming the confidence and union of our fellow-citi­  
, zens, will more th in countervail the ordinary ob­  
jection to such publications. It is my wish, there­  
fore, that it may now he published.

A the opening of the present ses­

the measures Which had been taken  
with the government of Great Britain, j  
for the settlement of our neutral and. .  
national rights, and of the conditions 1

duced, as Congress has been already.

o the Senate and House of  
Representatives of the United States,  
  
At the opening of the preset session, I inform-  
ed the legisiature, that the measures which had  
been taken with the government of Great Britain  
for the settlement of our neutral and national rights,  
and of the conditions of commercial imterceurse  
with that nation, had resulted in articles of a treaty,  
which could not be acceded to on cur part: that im  
structions had consequently been sent to our minis=  
ters there, to resume the negociations, and to em  
deavor to obtain cer:ain alteraiwon:, and that this  
Was interrupted by the transac’iors which tock  
place between the frigaies Leopard and Chesa-  
peake; the call on tha: g: vernment for reparation  
of this wrong, produced, as congress have been al-  
ready informed, the mission of a special munmister  
to this country, and the «ccasion Is now arrived,  
when the public interest permits and requires that  
the whole of these proceedings should be made  
known to you  
  
I therefore now communicste the instructions  
given to our minister resident at London, a: d bes  
communications to tha: government on the su pject  
of the Chesapea‘e, with the correspondence whiea  
  
7  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
No. 14.  
  
Che- Balance,  
  
  
  
-  
  
  
  
-—&quot;  
  
  
  
has taken place here, between the secretary of  
state and Mr Rose, the special minister charged  
with the adjustment of that difference; the instruc-  
tions to our misters for the formation of a trea-  
ty; their correspondence with the British commis-  
sioners, and with their own government on that  
subject ; the treary itself, and written declaration  
of the British Commissioners accompa vying it; and  
the iustructions given by us for resuming the nego-  
ciation, With the proceedings and correspondence  
sub-equent thereto, To these 1 have added a let-  
ter laiciy addressed to the secretary of state, from  
one of our late ministers, which, though not strict-  
ly written in an official character, I think it my du-  
ty tocommunicate, in ordemthar his views of the  
proposed weaty and of its several articles, may, be  
fairly presented and ur derstood  
  
Aithough I have heretofore, and from time to  
time, made such communications to congress as to  
keep them possessed of a general and just view of,  
the proceedings and dispositions of the government  
of France towards thiscountry, yet, in our present  
critical situation, when we find that no conduct on  
our part, however impartial and friendly, has been  
suficient to ensure, from either belligerent, a just  
respect for our rights, lam desircus that noihing  
shall be wmittedon my part which may add to  
  
your information on this subject, or contribute to,  
  
the correctness of the views which should be form-  
ed ‘The papers which for these reasons, I now  
lay before you, embrace all the communications,  
official or verbal, from the French government, res-  
pecting the general relations ber ween the two caun-  
tries, which have been transmitted through our  
minister there, or through any other accredited  
channel, since the last session of congress, to which  
time, all information of the same kind had, from  
time to time, been given them. Some of these pa-  
pers have already been submitted to congress; but  
it is thought betier to olier them again, in order  
that the chain of communications, of which they  
make a part, may be presented unbroken.  
  
W hen, on the 26th February I communicated to  
both houses the letter of general Armstrong to M.  
Champagny, I desired it moght not be published,  
  
because of the tendency of that practice to restrajm  
  
injuriously the freedom of our foreign correspon.  
dence. But perceiving that this caution, proceed-  
  
ing purely from a regard to the public good, has:,  
  
turnished occasion for disseminating unfounded  
Suspicions and insinuations, 1 am induced to be.  
heve that the good which will now result from its  
publication, by confirming the confidence and un-  
ion of our fellow crtizens, will more than counter-  
vail the ordinary objection to such publications. Ie  
is my wish therefore that it may be now published.

The following is the message of the  
President on the occasion,  
i o the Senate and House of Represen­  
tatives of the IT. States.  
  
At the opening of the present session,  
I informed the legislature, that the mea­  
sures which had been taken with the go­  
vernment ol Great Britain, lor the set­  
tlement ol our neutral and national  
rights, and of the conditions of com­  
mercial intercourse with that nation,  
had resulted in articles of a treaty, which  
could not be acceded to on our part ;  
that instructions had consequently been  
sent, to our ministers there, to resume  
the negociations, and to endeavour to  
obtain certain alterationss, and that this  
was interrupted by the transaction which  
took place between tlie frigates Leopard  
and Chesapeake. The call on that go­  
vernment lor reparation ol this wrong  
produced, as Congress lias been alrea­  
dy informed, the mission of a special  
Minister to this country, and the occa­  
sion is now arrived, w hen the public in­  
terest permits and requires, that the  
whole ol these proceedings should be  
made known to you. * . ,  
I therefore now communicate the in­  
structions given to our Minister re­  
sident at London, and his communica­  
‘ .tions to that government, on the subject  
of the Chesapeake, with thi correspon­  
dence which has taken place here be­  
tween the Secretary of State and Mr.  
, ftjose, the special Minister charged with  
  
the adjustment of that difference ; the  
instructions to our Minisers for the for­  
mation of a treaty ; their correspon­  
dence with the British commissioners,  
and with their own government on that  
subject; the treaty itself and written  
declaration of the British Commission­  
ers accompanying it ; and the instruc­  
tions given by us for resuming the ne­  
gociations, with the proceedings and  
correspondence subsequent thereto.—  
To these I have added a letter lately  
addressed to the Secretary ol State from  
one of our late Ministers, which, though  
not strictly written in an oflicial cha­  
racter, I think it my duty to commu­  
nicate, in order that his views of the  
proposed treaty, and of its several arti­  
cles, may be fairly presented and under­  
stood.  
  
Although I have here tofore,and from  
time to time, made such communica­  
tions to Congress, as to keep them pos­  
sessed of a general and just view of the  
proceedings and dispositions of the go­  
vernment of France towards this coun­  
try, yet in our present critic..! situation,  
when we find that no conduct on our  
part, however impartial and friendly,  
has been sufficient to insure from either  
belligerent, a just respect for our rights,  
I am desirous that nothing shall be o­  
mitted on my part, which may add to  
your information on this*subjt:ct,or con­  
tribute to the correctness of the views  
which shoulel be formed. The papers  
which for these reasons, I now lay be­  
fore you, embrace all the communica­  
tions, official or &#x27;verbal, from the  
French government, respecting the ge­  
neral relations between the two coun­  
tries, which hnd been transmitted  
through our Minister there, or through  
any other accredited channel, since the  
last session ot Congress ; to which time  
all information of the same kind had,  
from time to time, been given them.  
Some of these papers have already been  
submitted to Congress : but it is  
thought better to offer them again in or­  
der that the chain of communications,  
of which they make a part, may be pre­  
sented unbroken.  
When on the 26th of February, I  
communicated to both houses the letter  
ol Cen. Armstrong to M. Champagne,  
I desired it might not be published, be­  
cause ol the tendency of that practice to  
restrain injuriously the freedom of our  
foreign correspondence. Hut perceiving  
that this caution,proceeding purely from  
a regard for the publick good, has hn­  
mshed occuaiou lor disseminating uu­  
  
founded suspicions and insinuations, 1  
am induced to believe that the good  
which will now result from the publica­  
tion, by confirming the confidence and  
union of our fellow citizens, will more  
than countervail the ordinary objection  
to such publications. It is my wish  
therefore that it may now be published.
