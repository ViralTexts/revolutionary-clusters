Sir  
New York Septr 30th 1780.  
  
From Your Excellency’s Letter of this date, I am persuaded the Board of General Officers, to whom You referred the case of Major André, can’t have been rightly informed of all the circumstances on which a Judgement ought to be formed. I think it of the highest Moment to Humanity that your Excellency should be perfectly apprized of the State of this Matter before you proceed to put that Judgement in Execution.  
For this reason I shall send His Exy Lt General Robertson and Two other Gentlemen, to give you a true State of facts, and to declare to You my Sentiments and Resolutions. They will set out tomorrow as early as the Wind and Tide will permit, and wait near Dobb’s Ferry for Your permission and safe Conduct to meet Your Excellency, or such persons as You may appoint to converse with them on this Subject. I have the honor to be Your Excellency’s Most Obedient and Most humble Servt  
  
H. Clinton  
  
  
  
P.S. The Honble Andrew Elliot Esqr. Lieut. Governor, &amp; The Honble William Smith Chief Justice of this Province will attend His Excy Lieut. General Robertson.

Sir, New York, Sept. 30, 1789.  
  
From your Excellency’s letter of  
this date, | am persuaded the Board  
of General Oilicers, to whom you  
referred the case of Major André,  
cannot have been rightly informed  
of all the circumstances on which a  
judgment ought to be formed. |  
think it of the highest moment to  
humanity, that your Excellency  
should be perfectly apprized of the  
state of this matte:, before you pro-  
ceed to put that judgment in exe-  
cation.  
  
For this reason, I shall send his  
Excellency Lieutenant-general Ro-  
bertson, and two other gentlemen,  
to give you a true state of facts,  
and to declare to you my senti-  
ments and resolutions. They will  
set out to-morrow as early as the  
wind and tide will permit, and wait  
near Dobb’s-ferry for your permis-  
sion and safe conduct, to meet your  
Excellency, orsuch persons as you  
  
Anpré’s Bones.  
  
  
  
  
  
884  
  
may appoint, to converse with them  
on this subject.  
  
I have the honour to be your  
Excellency’s most obedient and  
humble servant, H. C.iinton,  
  
P.S. The Hon. Andrew Elliot,  
Esq. Lieutenant-governor, and the  
Hon. William Smith, Chief Justice  
of this province, will attend his  
Excellency Licutenant-general Ro-  
bertson. H.C
