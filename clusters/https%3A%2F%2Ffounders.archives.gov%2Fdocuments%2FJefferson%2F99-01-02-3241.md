means to execute the measure proposed. This is  
magnanimous, as it is voluntary on the part of the  
senate, for in adopting the resolution we attach a  
high degree of responsibility to ourselves in the ef­  
fects to be produced.  
The object of the resolution seems to be further  
illustrated on two grounds. 1. “ That the Presi­  
dent demand the restoration of the property of their  
citizens, captured and condemned on the pretext of  
its being employed in a trade with the enemies of G.  
Britain, prohibited in time of peace ; and upon the  
indemnification of such American citizens, for their  
losses and damages sustained by these captures and  
condemnations.” What is there in this part of the  
resolution so objectionable to honourable gentlemen ?  
Is it the restoration of the captured property of cur  
citizens? No t Is it the indemnification of our citi­  
zens, for their losses and damages sustained by the  
captures of which we complain ? It cannot be. To  
what then are exceptions taken ? Two honourable  
gentlemen have given the answer. “ The resoluti
