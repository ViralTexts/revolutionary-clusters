The Secretary of the Treasury in obedience to the order of ye House of Representatives, of the 15th day of January 1790, has applied his attention, at as early a period as his other duties would permit, to the subject of Manufactures; and particularly to the means of promoting such as will tend to render the United States, independent on foreign nations, for military and other essential supplies. And he there [upon] respectfully submits the following Report.  
The expediency of encouraging manufactures in the United States, which was not long since deemed very questionable, appears at this time to be pretty generally admitted. The embarrassments, which have obstructed the progress of our external trade, have led to serious reflections on the necessity of enlarging the sphere of our domestic commerce: the restrictive regulations, which in foreign markets abrige the vent of the increasing surplus of our Agricultural produce, serve to beget an earnest desire, that a more extensive demand for that surplus may be created at home: And the complete success, which has rewarded manufacturing enterprise, in some valuable branches, conspiring with the promising symptoms, which attend some less mature essays, in others, justify a hope, that the obstacles to the growth of this species of industry are less formidable than they were apprehended to be; and that it is not difficult to find, in its further extension; a full indemnification for any external disadvantages, which are or may be experienced, as well as an accession of resources, favourable to national independence and safety.  
There still are, nevertheless, respectable patrons of opinions, unfriendly to the encouragement of manufactures. The following are, substantially, the arguments, by which these opinions are defended.  
“In every country (say those who entertain them) Agriculture is the most beneficial and productive object of human industry. This position, generally, if not universally true, applies with peculiar emphasis to the United States, on account of their immense tracts of fertile territory, uninhabited and unimproved. Nothing can afford so advantageous an employment for capital and labour, as the conversion of this extensive wilderness into cultivated farms. Nothing equally with this, can contribute to the population, strength and real riches of the country.”  
  
“To endeavor by the extraordinary patronage of Government, to accelerate the growth of manufactures, is in fact, to endeavor, by force and art, to transfer the natural current of industry, from a more, to a less beneficial channel. Whatever has such a tendency must necessarily be unwise. Indeed it can hardly ever be wise in a government, to attempt to give a direction to the industry of its citizens. This under the quicksighted guidance of private interest, will, if left to itself, infallibly find its own way to the most profitable employment: and ’tis by such employment, that the public prosperity will be most effectually promoted. To leave industry to itself, therefore, is, in almost every case, the soundest as well as the simplest policy.”  
  
“This policy is not only recommended to the United States, by considerations which affect all nations, it is, in a manner, dictated to them by the imperious force of a very peculiar situation. The smallness of their population compared with their territory—the constant allurements to emigration from the settled to the unsettled parts of the country—the facility, with which the less independent condition of an artisan can be exchanged for the more independent condition of a farmer, these and similar causes conspire to produce, and for a length of time must continue to occasion, a scarcity of hands for manufacturing occupation, and dearness of labor generally. To these disadvantages for the prosecution of manufactures, a deficiency of pecuniary capital being added, the prospect of a successful competition with the manufactures of Europe must be regarded as little less than desperate. Extensive manufactures can only be the offspring of a redundant, at least of a full population. Till the latter shall characterise the situation of this country, ’tis vain to hope for the former.”  
  
“If contrary to the natural course of things, an unseasonable and premature spring can be given to certain fabrics, by heavy duties, prohibitions, bounties, or by other forced expedients; this will only be to sacrifice the interests of the community to those of particular classes. Besides the misdirection of labour, a virtual monopoly will be given to the persons employed on such fabrics; and an enhancement of price, the inevitable consequence of every monopoly, must be defrayed at the expence of the other parts of the society. It is far preferable, that those persons should be engaged in the cultivation of the earth, and that we should procure, in exchange for its productions, the commodities, with which foreigners are able to supply us in greater perfection, and upon better terms.”  
This mode of reasoning is founded upon facts and principles, which have certainly respectable pretensions. If it had governed the conduct of nations, more generally than it has done, there is room to suppose, that it might have carried them faster to prosperity and greatness, than they have attained, by the pursuit of maxims too widely opposite. Most general theories, however, admit of numerous exceptions, and there are few, if any, of the political kind, which do not blend a considerable portion of error, with the truths they inculcate.  
  
In order to an accurate judgement how far that which has been just stated ought to be deemed liable to a similar imputation, it is necessary to advert carefully to the considerations, which plead in favour of manufactures, and which appear to recommend the special and positive encouragement of them; in certain cases, and under certain reasonable limitations.  
It ought readily to be conceded, that the cultivation of the earth—as the primary and most certain source of national supply—as the immediate and chief source of subsistence to man—as the principal source of those materials which constitute the nutriment of other kinds of labor—as including a state most favourable to the freedom and independence of the human mind—one, perhaps, most conducive to the multiplication of the human species—has intrinsically a strong claim to pre-eminence over every other kind of industry.  
But, that it has a title to any thing like an exclusive predilection, in any country, ought to be admitted with great caution. That it is even more productive than every other branch of Industry requires more evidence, than has yet been given in support of the position. That its real interests, precious and important as without the help of exaggeration, they truly are, will be advanced, rather than injured by the due encouragement of manufactures, may, it is believed, be satisfactorily demonstrated. And it is also believed that the expediency of such encouragement in a general view may be shewn to be recommended by the most cogent and persuasive motives of national policy.  
It has been maintained, that Agriculture is, not only, the most productive, but the only productive species of industry. The reality of this suggestion in either aspect, has, however, not been verified by any accurate detail of facts and calculations; and the general arguments, which are adduced to prove it, are rather subtil and paradoxical, than solid or convincing.  
Those which maintain its exclusive productiveness are to this effect.  
Labour, bestowed upon the cultivation of land produces enough, not only to replace all the necessary expences incurred in the business, and to maintain the persons who are employed in it, but to afford together with the ordinary profit on the stock or capital of the Farmer, a nett surplus, or rent for the landlord or proprietor of the soil. But the labor of Artificers does nothing more, than replace the Stock which employs them (or which furnishes materials tools and wages) and yield the ordinary profit upon that Stock. It yields nothing equivalent to the rent of land. Neither does it add any thing to the total value of the whole annual produce of the land and labour of the country. The additional value given to those parts of the produce of land, which are wrought into manufactures, is counterbalanced by the value of those other parts of that produce, which are consumed by the manufacturers. It can therefore only be by saving, or parsimony not by the positive productiveness of their labour, that the classes of Artificers can in any degree augment the revenue of the Society.  
To this it has been answered—  
I   “That inasmuch as it is acknowleged, that manufacturing labour reproduces a value equal to that which is expended or consumed in carrying it on, and continues in existence the original Stock or capital employed—it ought on that account alone, to escape being considered as wholly unproductive: That though it should be admitted, as alleged, that the consumption of the produce of the soil, by the classes of Artificers or Manufacturers, is exactly equal to the value added by their labour to the materials upon which it is exerted; yet it would not thence follow, that it added nothing to the Revenue of the Society, or to the aggregate value of the annual produce of its land and labour. If the consumption for any given period amounted to a given sum and the increased value of the produce manufactured, in the same period, to a like sum, the total amount of the consumption and production during that period, would be equal to the two sums, and consequently double the value of the agricultural produce consumed. And though the increment of value produced by the classes of Artificers should at no time exceed the value of the produce of the land consumed by them, yet there would be at every moment, in consequence of their labour, a greater value of goods in the market than would exist independent of it.”  
II—“That the position, that Artificers can augment the revenue of a Society, only by parsimony, is true, in no other sense, than in one, which is equally applicable to Husbandmen or Cultivators. It may be alike affirmed of all these classes, that the fund acquired by their labor and destined for their support is not, in an ordinary way, more than equal to it. And hence it will follow, that augmentations of the wealth or capital of the community (except in the instances of some extraordinary dexterity or skill) can only proceed, with respect to any of them, from the savings of the more thrifty and parsimonious.”  
  
III—“That the annual produce of the land and labour of a country can only be encreased, in two ways—by some improvement in the productive powers of the useful labour, which actually exists within it, or by some increase in the quantity of such labour: That with regard to the first, the labour of Artificers being capable of greater subdivision and simplicity of operation, than that of Cultivators, it is susceptible, in a proportionably greater degree, of improvement in its productive powers, whether to be derived from an accession of Skill, or from the application of ingenious machinery; in which particular, therefore, the labour employed in the culture of land can pretend to no advantage over that engaged in manufactures: That with regard to an augmentation of the quantity of useful labour, this, excluding adventitious circumstances, must depend essentially upon an increase of capital, which again must depend upon the savings made out of the revenues of those, who furnish or manage that, which is at any time employed, whether in Agriculture, or in Manufactures, or in any other way.”  
But while the exclusive productiveness of Agricultural labour has been thus denied and refuted, the superiority of its productiveness has been conceded without hesitation. As this concession involves a point of considerable magnitude, in relation to maxims of public administration, the grounds on which it rests are worthy of a distinct and particular examination.  
One of the arguments made use of, in support of the idea may be pronounced both quaint and superficial. It amounts to this—That in the productions of the soil, nature co-operates with man; and that the effect of their joint labour must be greater than that of the labour of man alone.  
This however, is far from being a necessary inference. It is very conceivable, that the labor of man alone laid out upon a work, requiring great skill and art to bring it to perfection, may be more productive, in value, than the labour of nature and man combined, when directed towards more simple operations and objects: And when it is recollected to what an extent the Agency of nature, in the application of the mechanical powers, is made auxiliary to the prosecution of manufactures, the suggestion, which has been noticed, loses even the appearance of plausibility.  
It might also be observed, with a contrary view, that the labour employed in Agriculture is in a great measure periodical and occasional, depending on seasons, liable to various and long intermissions; while that occupied in many manufactures is constant and regular, extending through the year, embracing in some instances night as well as day. It is also probable, that there are among the cultivators of land more examples of remissness, than among artificers. The farmer, from the peculiar fertility of his land, or some other favorable circumstance, may frequently obtain a livelihood, even with a considerable degree of carelessness in the mode of cultivation; but the artisan can with difficulty effect the same object, without exerting himself pretty equally with all those, who are engaged in the same pursuit. And if it may likewise be assumed as a fact, that manufactures open a wider field to exertions of ingenuity than agriculture, it would not be a strained conjecture, that the labour employed in the former, being at once more constant, more uniform and more ingenious, than that which is employed in the latter, will be found at the same time more productive.  
But it is not meant to lay stress on observations of this nature—they ought only to serve as a counterbalance to those of a similar complexion. Circumstances so vague and general, as well as so abstract, can afford little instruction in a matter of this kind.  
Another, and that which seems to be the principal argument offered for the superior productiveness of Agricultural labour, turns upon the allegation, that labour employed in manufactures yields nothing equivalent to the rent of land; or to that nett surplus, as it is called, which accrues to the proprietor of the soil.  
  
But this distinction, important as it has been deemed, appears rather verbal than substantial.  
It is easily discernible, that what in the first instance is divided into two parts under the denominations of the ordinary profit of the Stock of the farmer and rent to the landlord, is in the second instance united under the general appellation of the ordinary profit on the Stock of the Undertaker; and that this formal or verbal distribution constitutes the whole difference in the two cases. It seems to have been overlooked, that the land is itself a Stock or capital, advanced or lent by its owner to the occupier or tenant, and that the rent he receives is only the ordinary profit of a certain Stock in land, not managed by the proprietor himself, but by another to whom he lends or lets it, and who on his part advances a second capital to stock &amp; improve the land, upon which he also receives the usual profit. The rent of the landlord and the profit of the farmer are therefore nothing more than the ordinary profits of two capitals belonging to two different persons, and united in the cultivation of a farm: As in the other case, the surplus which arises upon any manufactory, after replacing the expences of carrying it on, answers to the ordinary profits of one or more capitals engaged in the prosecution of such manufactory. It is said one or more capitals; because in fact, the same thing which is contemplated, in the case of the farm, sometimes happens in that of a manufactory. There is one, who furnishes a part of the capital, or lends a part of the money, by which it is carried on, and another, who carries it on, with the addition of his own capital. Out of the surplus, which remains, after defraying expences, an interest is paid to the money lender for the portion of the capital furnished by him, which exactly agrees with the rent paid to the landlord; and the residue of that surplus constitutes the profit of the undertaker or manufacturer, and agrees with what is denominated the ordinary profits on the Stock of the farmer. Both together make the ordinary profits of two capitals [employed in a manufactory; as in the other case the rent of the landlord and the revenue of the farmer compose the ordinary profits of two Capitals] employed in the cultivation of a farm.  
The rent therefore accruing to the proprietor of the land, far from being a criterion of exclusive productiveness, as has been argued, is no criterion even of superior productiveness. The question must still be, whether the surplus, after defraying expences, of a given capital, employed in the purchase and improvement of a piece of land, is greater or less, than that of a like capital employed in the prosecution of a manufactory: or whether the whole value produced from a given capital and a given quantity of labour, employed in one way, be greater or less, than the whole value produced from an equal capital and an equal quantity of labour employed in the other way: or rather, perhaps whether the business of Agriculture or that of Manufactures will yield the greatest product, according to a compound ratio of the quantity of the Capital and the quantity of labour, which are employed in the one or in the other.  
The solution of either of these questions is not easy; it involves numerous and complicated details, depending on an accurate knowlege of the objects to be compared. It is not known that the comparison has ever yet been made upon sufficient data properly ascertained and analised. To be able to make it on the present occasion with satisfactory precision would demand more previous enquiry and investigation, than there has been hitherto either leisure or opportunity to accomplish.  
Some essays however have been made towards acquiring the requisite information; which have rather served to throw doubt upon, than to confirm the Hypothesis, under examination: But it ought to be acknowledged, that they have been too little diversified, and are too imperfect, to authorise a definitive conclusion either way; leading rather to probable conjecture than to certain deduction. They render it probable, that there are various branches of manufactures, in which a given Capital will yield a greater total product, and a considerably greater nett product, than an equal capital invested in the purchase and improvement of lands; and that there are also some branches, in which both the gross and the nett produce will exceed that of Agricultural industry; according to a compound ratio of capital and labour: But it is on this last point, that there appears to be the greatest room for doubt. It is far less difficult to infer generally, that the nett produce of Capital engaged in manufacturing enterprises is greater than that of Capital engaged in Agriculture.

o in another place.  
The foregoing suggestions are not designed to inculcate an opinion that manufacturing industry is more productive than that of Agriculture. They are intended rather to shew that the reverse of this proposition is not ascertained; that the general arguments which are brought to establish it are not satisfactory; and consequently that a supposition of the superior productiveness of Tillage ought to be no obstacle to listening to any substantial inducements to the encouragement of manufactures, which may be otherwise perceived to exist, through an apprehension, that they may have a tendency to divert labour from a more to a less profitable employment.  
It is extremely probable, that on a full and accurate devellopment of the matter, on the ground of fact and calculation, it would be discovered that there is no material difference between the aggregate productiveness of the one, and of the other kind of industry; and that the propriety of the encouragements, which may in any case be proposed to be given to either ought to be determined upon considerations irrelative to any comparison of that nature.  
II   But without contending for the superior productiveness of Manufacturing Industry, it may conduce to a better judgment of the policy, which ought to be pursued respecting its encouragement, to contemplate the subject, under some additional aspects, tending not only to confirm the idea, that this kind of industry has been improperly represented as unproductive in itself; but [to] evince in addition that the establishment and diffusion of manufactures have the effect of rendering the total mass of useful and productive labor in a community, greater than it would otherwise be. In prosecuting this discussion, it may be necessary briefly to resume and review some of the topics, which have been already touched.  
To affirm, that the labour of the Manufacturer is unproductive, because he consumes as much of the produce of land, as he adds value to the raw materials which he manufactures, is not better founded, than it would be to affirm, that the labour of the farmer, which furnishes materials to the manufacturer, is unproductive, because he consumes an equal value of manufactured articles. Each furnishes a certain portion of the produce of his labor to the other, and each destroys a correspondent portion of the produce of the labour of the other. In the mean time, the maintenance of two Citizens, instead of one, is going on; the State has two members instead of one; and they together consume twice the value of what is produced from the land.  
If instead of a farmer and artificer, there were a farmer only, he would be under the necessity of devoting a part of his labour to the fabrication of cloathing and other articles, which he would procure of the artificer, in the case of there being such a person; and of course he would be able to devote less labor to the cultivation of his farm; and would draw from it a proportionably less product. The whole quantity of production, in this state of things, in provisions, raw materials and manufactures, would certainly not exceed in value the amount of what would be produced in provisions and raw materials only, if there were an artificer as well as a farmer.  
Again—if there were both an artificer and a farmer, the latter would be left at liberty to pursue exclusively the cultivation of his farm. A greater quantity of provisions and raw materials would of course be produced—equal at least—as has been already observed, to the whole amount of the provisions, raw materials and manufactures, which would exist on a contrary supposition. The artificer, at the same time would be going on in the production of manufactured commodities; to an amount sufficient not only to repay the farmer, in those commodities, for the provisions and materials which were procured from him, but to furnish the Artificer himself with a supply of similar commodities for his own use. Thus then, there would be two quantities or values in existence, instead of one; and the revenue and consumption would be double in one case, what it would be in the other.  
If in place of both these suppositions, there were supposed to be two farmers, and no artificer, each of whom applied a part of his labour to the culture of land, and another part to the fabrication of Manufactures—in this case, the portion of the labour of both bestowed upon land would produce the same quantity of provisions and raw materials only, as would be produced by the intire sum of the labour of one applied in the same manner, and the portion of the labour of both bestowed upon manufactures, would produce the same quantity of manufactures only, as would be produced by the intire sum of the labour of one applied in the same manner. Hence the produce of the labour of the two farmers would not be greater than the produce of the labour of the farmer and artificer; and hence, it results, that the labour of the artificer is as possitively productive as that of the farmer, and, as positively, augments the revenue of the Society.  
The labour of the Artificer replaces to the farmer that portion of his labour, with which he provides the materials of exchange with the Artificer, and which he would otherwise have been compelled to apply to manufactures: and while the Artificer thus enables the farmer to enlarge his stock of Agricultural industry, a portion of which he purchases for his own use, he also supplies himself with the manufactured articles of which he stands in need.  
He does still more—Besides this equivalent which he gives for the portion of Agricultural labour consumed by him, and this supply of manufactured commodities for his own consumption—he furnishes still a surplus, which compensates for the use of the Capital advanced either by himself or some other person, for carrying on the business. This is the ordinary profit of the Stock employed in the manufactory, and is, in every sense, as effective an addition to the income of the Society, as the rent of land.  
The produce of the labour of the Artificer consequently, may be regarded as composed of three parts; one by which the provisions for his subsistence and the materials for his work are purchased of the farmer, one by which he supplies himself with manufactured necessaries, and a third which constitutes the profit on the Stock employed. The two last portions seem to have been overlooked in the system, which represents manufacturing industry as barren and unproductive.  
In the course of the preceding illustrations, the products of equal quantities of the labour of the farmer and artificer have been treated as if equal to each other. But this is not to be understood as intending to assert any such precise equality. It is merely a manner of expression adopted for the sake of simplicity and perspicuity. Whether the value of the produce of the labour of the farmer be somewhat more or less, than that of the artificer, is not material to the main scope of the argument, which hitherto has only aimed at shewing, that the one, as well as the other, occasions a possitive augmentation of the total produce and revenue of the Society.  
It is now proper to proceed a step further, and to enumerate the principal circumstances, from which it may be inferred—That manufacturing establishments not only occasion a possitive augmentation of the Produce and Revenue of the Society, but that they contribute essentially to rendering them greater than they could possibly be, without such establishments. These circumstances are—  
  
  
1.  
The division of Labour.  
  
  
2.  
An extension of the use of Machinery.  
  
  
3.  
Additional employment to classes of the community not ordinarily engaged in the business.  
  
  
4.  
The promoting of emigration from foreign Countries.  
  
  
5.  
The furnishing greater scope for the diversity of talents and dispositions which discriminate men from each other.  
  
  
6. The affording a more ample and various field for enterprize.  
7. The creating in some instances a new, and securing in all, a more certain and steady demand for the surplus produce of the soil. Each of these circumstances has a considerable influence upon the total mass of industrious effort in a community. Together, they add to it a degree of energy and effect, which are not easily conceived. Some comments upon each of them, in the order in which they have been stated, may serve to explain their importance.  
I.   As to the Division of Labour.  
It has justly been observed, that there is scarcely any thing of greater moment in the œconomy of a nation, than the proper division of labour. The seperation of occupations causes each to be carried to a much greater perfection, than it could possible acquire, if they were blended. This arises principally from three circumstances.  
1st—The greater skill and dexterity naturally resulting from a constant and undivided application to a single object. It is evident, that these properties must increase, in proportion to the separation and simplification of objects and the steadiness of the attention devoted to each; and must be less, in proportion to the complication of objects, and the number among which the attention is distracted.  
2nd. The œconomy of time—by avoiding the loss of it, incident to a frequent transition from one operation to another of a different nature. This depends on various circumstances—the transition itself—the orderly disposition of the impliments, machines and materials employed in the operation to be relinquished—the preparatory steps to the commencement of a new one—the interruption of the impulse, which the mind of the workman acquires, from being engaged in a particular operation—the distractions hesitations and reluctances, which attend the passage from one kind of business to another.  
3rd. An extension of the use of Machinery. A man occupied on a single object will have it more in his power, and will be more naturally led to exert his imagination in devising methods to facilitate and abrige labour, than if he were perplexed by a variety of independent and dissimilar operations. Besides this, the fabrication of Machines, in numerous instances, becoming itself a distinct trade, the Artist who follows it, has all the advantages which have been enumerated, for improvement in his particular art; and in both ways the invention and application of machinery are extended.  
And from these causes united, the mere separation of the occupation of the cultivator, from that of the Artificer, has the effect of augmenting the productive powers of labour, and with them, the total mass of the produce or revenue of a Country. In this single view of the subject, therefore, the utility of Artificers or Manufacturers, towards promoting an increase of productive industry, is apparent.  
II.   As to an extension of the use of Machinery a point which though partly anticipated requires to be placed in one or two additional lights.  
The employment of Machinery forms an item of great importance in the general mass of national industry. ’Tis an artificial force brought in aid of the natural force of man; and, to all the purposes of labour, is an increase of hands; an accession of strength, unincumbered too by the expence of maintaining the laborer. May it not therefore be fairly inferred, that those occupations, which give greatest scope to the use of this auxiliary, contribute most to the general Stock of industrious effort, and, in consequence, to the general product of industry?  
It shall be taken for granted, and the truth of the position referred to observation, that manufacturing pursuits are susceptible in a greater degree of the application of machinery, than those of Agriculture. If so all the difference is lost to a community, which, instead of manufacturing for itself, procures the fabrics requisite to its supply from other Countries. The substitution of foreign for domestic manufactures is a transfer to foreign nations of the advantages accruing from the employment of Machinery, in the modes in which it is capable of being employed, with most utility and to the greatest extent.  
The Cotton Mill invented in England, within the last twenty years, is a signal illustration of the general proposition, which has been just advanced. In consequence of it, all the different processes for spining Cotton are performed by means of Machines, which are put in motion by water, and attended chiefly by women and Children; [and by a smaller] number of [persons, in the whole, than are] requisite in the ordinary mode of spinning. And it is an advantage of great moment that the operations of this mill continue with convenience, during the night, as well as through the day. The prodigious affect of such a Machine is easily conceived. To this invention is to be attributed essentially the immense progress, which has been so suddenly made in Great Britain in the various fabrics of Cotton.  
III.   As to the additional employment of classes of the community, not ordinarily engaged in the particular business.  
  
This is not among the least valuable of the means, by which manufacturing institutions contribute to augment the general stock of industry and production. In places where those institutions prevail, besides the persons regularly engaged in them, they afford occasional and extra employment to industrious individuals and families, who are willing to devote the leisure resulting from the intermissions of their ordinary pursuits to collateral labours, as a resource of multiplying their acquisitions or [their] enjoyments. The husbandman himself experiences a new source of profit and support from the encreased industry of his wife and daughters; invited and stimulated by the demands of the neighboring manufactories.  
Besides this advantage of occasional employment to classes having different occupations, there is another of a nature allied to it [and] of a similar tendency. This is—the employment of persons who would otherwise be idle (and in many cases a burthen on the community), either from the byass of temper, habit, infirmity of body, or some other cause, indisposing, or disqualifying them for the toils of the Country. It is worthy of particular remark, that, in general, women and Children are rendered more useful and the latter more early useful by manufacturing establishments, than they would otherwise be. Of the number of persons employed in the Cotton Manufactories of Great Britain, it is computed that 4/7 nearly are women and children; of whom the greatest proportion are children and many of them of a very tender age.  
And thus it appears to be one of the attributes of manufactures, and one of no small consequence, to give occasion to the exertion of a greater quantity of Industry, even by the same number of persons, where they happen to prevail, than would exist, if there were no such establishments.  
IV.   As to the promoting of emigration from foreign Countries. Men reluctantly quit one course of occupation and livelihood for another, unless invited to it by very apparent and proximate advantages. Many, who would go from one country to another, if they had a prospect of continuing with more benefit the callings, to which they have been educated, will often not be tempted to change their situation, by the hope of doing better, in some other way. Manufacturers, who listening to the powerful invitations of a better price for their fabrics, or their labour, of greater cheapness of provisions and raw materials, of an exemption from the chief part of the taxes burthens and restraints, which they endure in the old world, of greater personal independence and consequence, under the operation of a more equal government, and of what is far more precious than mere religious toleration—a perfect equality of religious privileges; would probably flock from Europe to the United States to pursue their own trades or professions, if they were once made sensible of the advantages they would enjoy, and were inspired with an assurance of encouragement and employment, will, with difficulty, be induced to transplant themselves, with a view to becoming Cultivators of Land.  
If it be true then, that it is the interest of the United States to open every possible [avenue to] emigration from abroad, it affords a weighty argument for the encouragement of manufactures; which for the reasons just assigned, will have the strongest tendency to multiply the inducements to it.  
Here is perceived an important resource, not only for extending the population, and with it the useful and productive labour of the country, but likewise for the prosecution of manufactures, without deducting from the number of hands, which might otherwise be drawn to tillage; and even for the indemnification of Agriculture for such as might happen to be diverted from it. Many, whom Manufacturing views would induce to emigrate, would afterwards yield to the temptations, which the particular situation of this Country holds out to Agricultural pursuits. And while Agriculture would in other respects derive many signal and unmingled advantages, from the growth of manufactures, it is a problem whether it would gain or lose, as to the article of the number of persons employed in carrying it on.  
V.   As to the furnishing greater scope for the diversity of talents and dispositions, which discriminate men from each other.  
This is a much more powerful mean of augmenting the fund of national Industry than may at first sight appear. It is a just observation, that minds of the strongest and most active powers for their proper objects fall below mediocrity and labour without effect, if confined to uncongenial pursuits. And it is thence to be inferred, that the results of human exertion may be immensely increased by diversifying its objects. When all the different kinds of industry obtain in a community, each individual can find his proper element, and can call into activity the whole vigour of his nature. And the community is benefitted by the services of its respective members, in the manner, in which each can serve it with most effect.  
  
If there be anything in a remark often to be met with—namely that there is, in the genius of the people of this country, a peculiar aptitude for mechanic improvements, it would operate as a forcible reason for giving opportunities to the exercise of that species of talent, by the propagation of manufactures.  
VI.   As to the affording a more ample and various field for enterprise.  
This also is of greater consequence in the general scale of national exertion, than might perhaps on a superficial view be supposed, and has effects not altogether dissimilar from those of the circumstance last noticed. To cherish and stimulate the activity of the human mind, by multiplying the objects of enterprise, is not among the least considerable of the expedients, by which the wealth of a nation may be promoted. Even things in themselves not positively advantageous, sometimes become so, by their tendency to provoke exertion. Every new scene, which is opened to the busy nature of man to rouse and exert itself, is the addition of a new energy to the general stock of effort.  
The spirit of enterprise, useful and prolific as it is, must necessarily be contracted or expanded in proportion to the simplicity or variety of the occupations and productions, which are to be found in a Society. It must be less in a nation of mere cultivators, than in a nation of cultivators and merchants; less in a nation of cultivators and merchants, than in a nation of cultivators, artificers and merchants.  
VII.   As to the creating, in some instances, a new, and securing in all a more certain and steady demand, for the surplus produce of the soil.  
  
This is among the most important of the circumstances which have been indicated. It is a principal mean, by which the establishment of manufactures contributes to an augmentation of the produce or revenue of a country, and has an immediate and direct relation to the prosperity of Agriculture.  
It is evident, that the exertions of the husbandman will be steady or fluctuating, vigorous or feeble, in proportion to the steadiness or fluctuation, adequateness, or inadequateness of the markets on which he must depend, for the vent of the surplus, which may be produced by his labour; and that such surplus in the ordinary course of things will be greater or less in the same proportion.  
For the purpose of this vent, a domestic market is greatly to be preferred to a foreign one; because it is in the nature of things, far more to be relied upon.  
It is a primary object of the policy of nations, to be able to supply themselves with subsistence from their own soils; and manufacturing nations, as far as circumstances permit, endeavor to procure, from the same source, the raw materials necessary for their own fabrics. This disposition, urged by the spirit of monopoly, is sometimes even carried to an injudicious extreme. It seems not always to be recollected, that nations, who have neither mines nor manufactures, can only obtain the manufactured articles, of which they stand in need, by an exchange of the products of their soils; and that, if those who can best furnish them with such articles are unwilling to give a due course to this exchange, they must of necessity make every possible effort to manufacture for themselves, the effect of which is that the manufacturing nations abrige the natural advantages of their situation, through an unwillingness to permit the Agricultural countries to enjoy the advantages of theirs, and sacrifice the interests of a mutually beneficial intercourse to the vain project of selling every thing and buying nothing.  
But it is also a consequence of the policy, which has been noted, that the foreign demand for the products of Agricultural Countries, is, in a great degree, rather casual and occasional, than certain or constant. To what extent injurious interruptions of the demand for some of the staple commodities of the United States, may have been experienced, from that cause, must be referred to the judgment of those who are engaged in carrying on the commerce of the country; but it may be safely assumed, that such interruptions are at times very inconveniently felt, and that cases not unfrequently occur, in which markets are so confined and restricted, as to render the demand very unequal to the supply.  
Independently likewise of the artificial impediments, which are created by the policy in question, there are natural causes tending to render the external demand for the surplus of Agricultural nations a precarious reliance. The differences of seasons, in the countries, which are the consumers make immense differences in the produce of their own soils, in different years; and consequently in the degrees of their necessity for foreign supply. Plentiful harvests with them, especially if similar ones occur at the same time in the countries, which are the furnishers, occasion of course a glut in the markets of the latter.  
Considering how fast and how much the progress of new settlements in the United States must increase the surplus produce of the soil, and weighing seriously the tendency of the system, which prevails among most of the commercial nations of Europe; whatever dependence may be placed on the force of natural circumstances to counteract the effects of an artificial policy; there appear strong reasons to regard the foreign demand for that surplus as too uncertain a reliance, and to desire a substitute for it, in an extensive domestic market.  
To secure such a market, there is no other expedient, than to promote manufacturing establishments. Manufacturers who constitute the most numerous class, after the Cultivators of land, are for that reason the principal consumers of the surplus of their labour.  
This idea of an extensive domestic market for the surplus produce of the soil is of the first consequence. It is of all things, that which most effectually conduces to a flourishing state of Agriculture. If the effect of manufactories should be to detatch a portion of the hands, which would otherwise be engaged in Tillage, it might possibly cause a smaller quantity of lands to be under cultivation but by their tendency to procure a more certain demand for the surplus produce of the soil, they would, at the same time, cause the lands which were in cultivation to be better improved and more productive. And while, by their influence, the condition of each individual farmer would be meliorated, the total mass of Agricultural production would probably be increased. For this must evidently depend as much, if not more, upon the degree of improvement; than upon the number of acres under culture.  
It merits particular observation, that the multiplication of manufactories not only furnishes a Market for those articles, which have been accustomed to be produced in abundance, in a country; but it likewise creates a demand for such as were either unknown or produced in inconsiderable quantities. The bowels as well as the surface of the earth are ransacked for articles which were before neglected. Animals, Plants and Minerals acquire an utility and value, which were before unexplored.  
The foregoing considerations seem sufficient to establish, as general propositions, That it is the interest of nations to diversify the industrious pursuits of the individuals, who compose them—That the establishment of manufactures is calculated not only to increase the general stock of useful and productive labour; but even to improve the state of Agriculture in particular; certainly to advance the interests of those who are engaged in it. There are other views, that will be hereafter taken of the subject, which, it is conceived, will serve to confirm these inferences.  
III   Previously to a further discussion of the objections to the encouragement of manufactures which have been stated, it will be of use to see what can be said, in reference to the particular situation of the United States, against the conclusions appearing to result from what has been already offered.  
It may be observed, and the idea is of no inconsiderable weight, that however true it might be, that a State, which possessing large tracts of vacant and fertile territory, was at the same time secluded from foreign commerce, would find its interest and the interest of Agriculture, in diverting a part of its population from Tillage to Manufactures; yet it will not follow, that the same is true of a State, which having such vacant and fertile territory, has at the same time ample opportunity of procuring from abroad, on good terms, all the fabrics of which it stands in need, for the supply of its inhabitants. The power of doing this at least secures the great advantage of a division of labour; leaving the farmer free to pursue exclusively the culture of his land, and enabling him to procure with its products the manufactured supplies requisite either to his wants or to his enjoyments. And though it should be true, that in settled countries, the diversification of Industry is conducive to an increase in the productive powers of labour, and to an augmentation of revenue and capital; yet it is scarcely conceivable that there can be any [thing] of so solid and permanent advantage to an uncultivated and unpeopled country as to convert its wastes into cultivated and inhabited districts. If the Revenue, in the mean time, should be less, the Capital, in the event, must be greater.  
To these observations, the following appears to be a satisfactory answer—  
1.   If the system of perfect liberty to industry and commerce were the prevailing system of nations—the arguments which dissuade a country in the predicament of the United States, from the zealous pursuits of manufactures would doubtless have great force. It will not be affirmed, that they might not be permitted, with few exceptions, to serve as a rule of national conduct. In such a state of things, each country would have the full benefit of its peculiar advantages to compensate for its deficiencies or disadvantages. If one nation were in condition to supply manufactured articles on better terms than another, that other might find an abundant indemnification in a superior capacity to furnish the produce of the soil. And a free exchange, mutually beneficial, of the commodities which each was able to supply, on the best terms, might be carried on between them, supporting in full vigour the industry of each. And though the circumstances which have been mentioned and others, which will be unfolded hereafter render it probable, that nations merely Agricultural would not enjoy the same degree of opulence, in proportion to their numbers, as those which united manufactures with agriculture; yet the progressive improvement of the lands of the former might, in the end, atone for an inferior degree of opulence in the mean time: and in a case in which opposite considerations are pretty equally balanced, the option ought perhaps always to be, in favour of leaving Industry to its own direction.  
But the system which has been mentioned, is far from characterising the general policy of Nations. [The prevalent one has been regulated by an opposite spirit.]  
  
The consequence of it is, that the United States are to a certain extent in the situation of a country precluded from foreign Commerce. They can indeed, without difficulty obtain from abroad the manufactured supplies, of which they are in want; but they experience numerous and very injurious impediments to the emission and vent of their own commodities. Nor is this the case in reference to a single foreign nation only. The regulations of several countries, with which we have the most extensive intercourse, throw serious obstructions in the way of the principal staples of the United States.  
In such a position of things, the United States cannot exchange with Europe on equal terms; and the want of reciprocity would render them the victim of a system, which should induce them to confine their views to Agriculture and refrain from Manufactures. A constant and encreasing necessity, on their part, for the commodities of Europe, and only a partial and occasional demand for their own, in return, could not but expose them to a state of impoverishment, compared with the opulence to which their political and natural advantages authorise them to aspire.  
  
Remarks of this kind are not made in the spirit of complaint. ’Tis for the nations, whose regulations are alluded to, to judge for themselves, whether, by aiming at too much they do not lose more than they gain. ’Tis for the United States to consider by what means they can render themselves least dependent, on the combinations, right or wrong of foreign policy.  
It is no small consolation, that already the measures which have embarrassed our Trade, have accelerated internal improvements, which upon the whole have bettered our affairs. To diversify and extend these improvements is the surest and safest method of indemnifying ourselves for any inconveniences, which those or similar measures have a tendency to beget. If Europe will not take from us the products of our soil, upon terms consistent with our interest, the natural remedy is to contract as fast as possible our wants of her.  
2.   The conversion of their waste into cultivated lands is certainly a point of great moment in the political calculations of the United States. But the degree in which this may possibly be retarded by the encouragement of manufactories does not appear to countervail the powerful inducements to affording that encouragement.  
An observation made in another place is of a nature to have great influence upon this question. If it cannot be denied, that the interests even of Agriculture may be advanced more by having such of the lands of a state as are occupied under good cultivation, than by having a greater quantity occupied under a much inferior cultivation, and if Manufactories, for the reasons assigned, must be admitted to have a tendency to promote a more steady and vigorous cultivation of the lands occupied than would happen without them—it will follow, that they are capable of indemnifying a country for a diminution of the progress of new settlements; and may serve to increase both the capital [value] and the income of its lands, even though they should abrige the number of acres under Tillage.  
But it does, by no means, follow, that the progress of new settlements would be retarded by the extension of Manufactures. The desire of being an independent proprietor of land is founded on such strong principles in the human breast, that where the opportunity of becoming so is as great as it is in the United States, the proportion will be small of those, whose situations would otherwise lead to it, who would be diverted from it towards Manufactures. And it is highly probable, as already intimated, that the accessions of foreigners, who originally drawn over by manufacturing views would afterwards abandon them for Agricultural, would be more than equivalent for those of our own Citizens, who might happen to be detached from them.  
The remaining objections to a particular encouragement of manufactures in the United States now require to be examined.  
One of these turns on the proposition, that Industry, if left to itself, will naturally find its way to the most useful and profitable employment: whence it is inferred, that manufactures without the aid of government will grow up as soon and as fast, as the natural state of things and the interest of the community may require.  
Against the solidity of this hypothesis, in the full latitude of the terms, very cogent reasons may be offered. These have relation to—the strong influence of habit and the spirit of imitation—the fear of want of success in untried enterprises—the intrinsic difficulties incident to first essays towards a competition with those who have previously attained to perfection in the business to be attempted—the bounties premiums and other artificial encouragements, with which foreign nations second the exertions of their own Citizens in the branches, in which they are to be rivalled.  
Experience teaches, that men are often so much governed by what they are accustomed to see and practice, that the simplest and most obvious improvements, in the [most] ordinary occupations, are adopted with hesitation, reluctance and by slow gradations. The spontaneous transition to new pursuits, in a community long habituated to different ones, may be expected to be attended with proportionably greater difficulty. When former occupations ceased to yield a profit adequate to the subsistence of their followers, or when there was an absolute deficiency of employment in them, owing to the superabundance of hands, changes would ensue; but these changes would be likely to be more tardy than might consist with the interest either of individuals or of the Society. In many cases they would not happen, while a bare support could be ensured by an adherence to ancient courses; though a resort to a more profitable employment might be practicable. To produce the desireable changes, as early as may be expedient, may therefore require the incitement and patronage of government.  
The apprehension of failing in new attempts is perhaps a more serious impediment. There are dispositions apt to be attracted by the mere novelty of an undertaking—but these are not always those best calculated to give it success. To this, it is of importance that the confidence of cautious sagacious capitalists both citizens and foreigners, should be excited. And to inspire this description of persons with confidence, it is essential, that they should be made to see in any project, which is new, and for that reason alone, if, for no other, precarious, the prospect of such a degree of countenance and support from government, as may be capable of overcoming the obstacles, inseperable from first experiments.  
  
The superiority antecedently enjoyed by nations, who have preoccupied and perfected a branch of industry, constitutes a more formidable obstacle, than either of those, which have been mentioned, to the introduction of the same branch into a country, in which it did not before exist. To maintain between the recent establishments of one country and the long matured establishments of another country, a competition upon equal terms, both as to quality and price, is in most cases impracticable. The disparity in the one, or in the other, or in both, must necessarily be so considerable as to forbid a successful rivalship, without the extraordinary aid and protection of government.  
But the greatest obstacle of all to the successful prosecution of a new branch of industry in a country, in which it was before unknown, consists, as far as the instances apply, in the bounties premiums and other aids which are granted, in a variety of cases, by the nations, in which the establishments to be imitated are previously introduced. It is well known (and particular examples in the course of this report will be cited) that certain nations grant bounties on the exportation of particular commodities, to enable their own workmen to undersell and supplant all competitors, in the countries to which those commodities are sent. Hence the undertakers of a new manufacture have to contend not only with the natural disadvantages of a new undertaking, but with the gratuities and remunerations which other governments bestow. To be enabled to contend with success, it is evident, that the interference and aid of their own government are indispensible.  
Combinations by those engaged in a particular branch of business in one country, to frustrate the first efforts to introduce it into another, by temporary sacrifices, recompensed perhaps by extraordinary indemnifications of the government of such country, are believed to have existed, and are not to be regarded as destitute of probability. The existence or assurance of aid from the government of the country, in which the business is to be introduced, may be essential to fortify adventurers against the dread of such combinations, to defeat their effects, if formed and to prevent their being formed, by demonstrating that they must in the end prove fruitless.  
Whatever room there may be for an expectation that the industry of a people, under the direction of private interest, will upon equal terms find out the most beneficial employment for itself, there is none for a reliance, that it will struggle against the force of unequal terms, or will of itself surmount all the adventitious barriers to a successful competition, which may have been erected either by the advantages naturally acquired from practice and previous possession of the ground, or by those which may have sprung from positive regulations and an artificial policy. This general reflection might alone suffice as an answer to the objection under examination; exclusively of the weighty considerations which have been particularly urged.  
The objections to the pursuit of manufactures in the United States, which next present themselves to discussion, represent an impracticability of success, arising from three causes—scarcity of hands—dearness of labour—want of capital.  
The two first circumstances are to a certain extent real, and, within due limits, ought to be admitted as obstacles to the success of manufacturing enterprize in the United States. But there are various considerations, which lessen their force, and tend to afford an assurance that they are not sufficient to prevent the advantageous prosecution of many very useful and extensive manufactories.  
  
With regard to scarcity of hands, the fact itself must be applied with no small qualification to certain parts of the United States. There are large districts, which may be considered as pretty fully peopled; and which notwithstanding a continual drain for distant settlement, are thickly interspersed with flourishing and increasing towns. If these districts have not already reached the point, at which the complaint of scarcity of hands ceases, they are not remote from it, and are approaching fast towards it: And having perhaps fewer attractions to agriculture, than some other parts of the Union, they exhibit a proportionably stronger tendency towards other kinds of industry. In these districts, may be discerned, no inconsiderable maturity for manufacturing establishments.  
But there are circumstances, which have been already noticed with another view, that materially diminish every where the effect of a scarcity of hands. These circumstances are—the great use which can be made of women and children; on which point a very pregnant and instructive fact has been mentioned—the vast extension given by late improvements to the employment of Machines, which substituting the Agency of fire and water, has prodigiously lessened the necessity for manual labor—the employment of persons ordinarily engaged in other occupations, during the seasons, or hours of leisure; which, besides giving occasion to the exertion of a greater quantity of labour by the same number of persons, and thereby encreasing the general stock of labour, as has been elsewhere remarked, may also be taken into the calculation, as a resource for obviating the scarcity of hands—lastly the attraction of foreign emigrants. Whoever inspects, with a careful eye, the composition of our towns will be made sensible to what an extent this resource may be relied upon. This exhibits a large proportion of ingenious and valuable workmen, in different arts and trades, who, by expatriating from Europe, have improved their own condition, and added to the industry and wealth of the United States. It is a natural inference from the experience, we have already had, that as soon as the United States shall present the countenance of a serious prosecution of Manufactures—as soon as foreign artists shall be made sensible that the state of things here affords a moral certainty of employment and encouragement—competent numbers of European workmen will transplant themselves, effectually to ensure the success of the design. How indeed can it otherwise happen considering the various and powerful inducements, which the situation of this country offers; addressing themselves to so many strong passions and feelings, to so many general and particular interests?  
It may be affirmed therefore, in respect to hands for carrying on manufactures, that we shall in a great measure trade upon a foreign Stock; reserving our own, for the cultivation of our lands and the manning of our Ships; as far as character and circumstances [shall] incline. It is not unworthy of remark, that the objection to the success of manufactures, deduced from the scarcity of hands, is alike applicable to Trade and Navigation; and yet these are perceived to flourish, without any sensible impediment from that cause.  
As to the dearness of labour (another of the obstacles alledged) this has relation principally to two circumstances, one that which has been just discussed, or the scarcity of hands, the other, the greatness of profits.  
As far as it is a consequence of the scarcity of hands, it is mitigated by all the considerations which have been adduced as lessening that deficiency.  
It is certain too, that the disparity in this respect, between some of the most manufacturing parts of Europe and a large proportion of the United States, is not nearly so great as is commonly imagined. It is also much less in regard to Artificers and manufacturers than in regard to country labourers; and while a careful comparison shews, that there is, in this particular, much exaggeration; it is also evident that the effect of the degree of disparity, which does truly exist, is diminished in proportion to the use which can be made of machinery.  
  
To illustrate this last idea—Let it be supposed, that the difference of price, in two Countries, of a given quantity of manual labour requisite to the fabrication of a given article is as 10; and that some mechanic power is introduced into both countries, which performing half the necessary labour, leaves only half to be done by hand, it is evident, that the difference in the cost of the fabrication of the article in question, in the two countries, as far as it is connected with the price of labour, will be reduced from 10. to 5, in consequence of the introduction of that power.  
This circumstance is worthy of the most particular attention. It diminishes immensely one of the objections most strenuously urged, against the success of manufactures in the United States.  
To procure all such machines as are known in any part of Europe, can only require a proper provision and due pains. The knowledge of several of the most important of them is already possessed. The preparation of them here, is in most cases, practicable on nearly equal terms. As far as they depend on Water, some superiority of advantages may be claimed, from the uncommon variety and greater cheapness of situations adapted to Mill seats, with which different parts of the United States abound.  
So far as the dearness of labour may be a consequence of the greatness of profits in any branch of business, it is no obstacle to its success. The Undertaker can afford to pay the price.  
There are grounds to conclude that undertakers of Manufactures in this Country can at this time afford to pay higher wages to the workmen they may employ than are paid to similar workmen in Europe. The prices of foreign fabrics, in the markets of the United States, which will for a long time regulate the prices of the domestic ones, may be considered as compounded of the following ingredients—The first cost of materials, including the Taxes, if any, which are paid upon them where they are made: the expence of grounds, buildings machinery and tools: the wages of the persons employed in the manufactory: the profits on the capital or Stock employed: the commissions of Agents to purchase them where they are made; the expence of transportation to the United States [including insurance and other incidental charges;] the taxes or duties, if any [and fees of office] which are paid on their exportation: the taxes or duties [and fees of office] which are paid on their importation.  
As to the first of these items, the cost of materials, the advantage upon the whole, is at present on the side of the United States, and the difference, in their favor, must increase, in proportion as a certain and extensive domestic demand shall induce the proprietors of land to devote more of their attention to the production of those materials. It ought not to escape observation, in a comparison on this point, that some of the principal manufacturing Countries of Europe are much more dependent on foreign supply for the materials of their manufactures, than would be the United States, who are capable of supplying themselves, with a greater abundance, as well as a greater variety of the requisite materials.  
As to the second item, the expence of grounds buildings machinery and tools, an equality at least may be assumed; since advantages in some particulars will counterbalance temporary disadvantages in others.  
As to the third item, or the article of wages, the comparison certainly turns against the United States, though as before observed not in so great a degree as is commonly supposed.  
The fourth item is alike applicable to the foreign and to the domestic manufacture. It is indeed more properly a result than a particular, to be compared.  
But with respect to all the remaining items, they are alone applicable to the foreign manufacture, and in the strictest sense extraordinaries; constituting a sum of extra charge on the foreign fabric, which cannot be estimated, at less than [from 15 to 30] ⅌ Cent. on the cost of it at the manufactory.  
  
This sum of extra charge may confidently be regarded as more than a Counterpoise for the real difference in the price of labour; and is a satisfactory proof that manufactures may prosper in defiance of it in the United States. To the general allegation, connected with the circumstances of scarcity of hands and dearness of labour, that extensive manufactures can only grow out of a redundant or full population, it will be sufficient, to answer generally, that the fact has been otherwise—That the situation alleged to be an essential condition of success, has not been that of several nations, at periods when they had already attained to maturity in a variety of manufactures.  
The supposed want of Capital for the prosecution of manufactures in the United States is the most indefinite of the objections which are usually opposed to it.  
It is very difficult to pronounce any thing precise concerning the real extent of the monied capital of a Country, and still more concerning the proportion which it bears to the objects that invite the employment of Capital. It is not less difficult to pronounce how far the effect of any given quantity of money, as capital, or in other words, as a medium for circulating the industry and property of a nation, may be encreased by the very circumstance of the additional motion, which is given to it by new objects of employment. That effect, like the momentum of descending bodies, may not improperly be represented, as in a compound ratio to mass and velocity. It seems pretty certain, that a given sum of money, in a situation, in which the quick impulses of commercial activity were little felt, would appear inadequate to the circulation of as great a quantity of industry and property, as in one, in which their full influence was experienced.  
It is not obvious, why the same objection might not as well be made to external commerce as to manufactures; since it is manifest that our immense tracts of land occupied and unoccupied are capable of giving employment to more capital than is actually bestowed upon them. It is certain, that the United States offer a vast field for the advantageous employment of Capital; but it does not follow, that there will not be found, in one way or another, a sufficient fund for the successful prosecution of any species of industry which is likely to prove truly beneficial.  
The following considerations are of a nature to remove all inquietude on the score of want of Capital.  
The introduction of Banks, as has been shewn on another occasion has a powerful tendency to extend the active Capital of a Country. Experience of the Utility of these Institutions is multiplying them in the United States. It is probable that they will be established wherever they can exist with advantage; and wherever, they can be supported, if administered with prudence, they will add new energies to all pecuniary operations.  
The aid of foreign Capital may safely, and, with considerable latitude be taken into calculation. Its instrumentality has been long experienced in our external commerce; and it has begun to be felt in various other modes. Not only our funds, but our Agriculture and other internal improvements have been animated by it. It has already in a few instances extended even to our manufactures.  
It is a well known fact, that there are parts of Europe, which have more Capital, than profitable domestic objects of employment. Hence, among other proofs, the large loans continually furnished to foreign states. And it is equally certain that the capital of other parts may find more profitable employment in the United States, than at home. And notwithstanding there are weighty inducements to prefer the employment of capital at home even at less profit, to an investment of it abroad, though with greater gain, yet these inducements are overruled either by a deficiency of employment or by a very material difference in profit. Both these Causes operate to produce a transfer of foreign capital to the United States. ’Tis certain, that various objects in this country hold out advantages, which are with difficulty to be equalled elsewhere; and under the increasingly favorable impressions, which are entertained of our government, the attractions will become more and More strong. These impressions will prove a rich mine of prosperity to the Country, if they are confirmed and strengthened by the progress of our affairs. And to secure this advantage, little more is now necessary, than to foster industry, and cultivate order and tranquility, at home and abroad.  
  
It is not impossible, that there may be persons disposed to look with a jealous eye on the introduction of foreign Capital, as if it were an instrument to deprive our own citizens of the profits of our own industry: But perhaps there never could be a more unreasonable jealousy. Instead of being viewed as a rival, it ought to be Considered as a most valuable auxiliary; conducing to put in Motion a greater Quantity of productive labour, and a greater portion of useful enterprise than could exist without it. It is at least evident, that in a Country situated like the United States, with an infinite fund of resources yet to be unfolded, every farthing of foreign capital, which is laid out in internal ameliorations, and in industrious establishments of a permanent nature, is a precious acquisition.  
And whatever be the objects which originally attract foreign Capital, when once introduced, it may be directed towards any purpose of beneficial exertion, which is desired. And to detain it among us, there can be no expedient so effectual as

e Manufacturing Capitalist of Europe shall advert to the many important advantages, which have been intimated, in the Course of this report, he cannot but perceive very powerful inducements to a transfer of himself and his Capital to the United States. Among the reflections, which a most interesting peculiarity of situation is calculated to suggest, it cannot escape his observation, as a circumstance of Moment in the calculation, that the progressive population and improvement of the United States, insure a continually increasing domestic demand for the fabrics which he shall produce, not to be affected by any external casualties or vicissitudes.  
But while there are Circumstances sufficiently strong to authorise a considerable degree of reliance on the aid of foreign Capital towards the attainment of the object in view, it is satisfactory to have good grounds of assurance, that there are domestic resources of themselves adequate to it. It happens, that there is a species of Capital actually existing within the United States, which relieves from all inquietude on the score of want of Capital—This is the funded Debt.  
The effect of a funded debt, as a species of Capital, has been Noticed upon a former Occasion; but a more particular elucidation of the point seems to be required by the stress which is here laid upon it. This shall accordingly be attempted.  
Public Funds answer the purpose of Capital, from the estimation in which they are usually held by Monied men; and consequently from the Ease and dispatch with which they can be turned into money. This capacity of prompt convertibility into money causes a transfer of stock to be in a great number of Cases equivalent to a payment in coin. And where it does not happen to suit the party who is to receive, to accept a transfer of Stock, the party who is to pay, is never at a loss to find elsewhere a purchaser of his Stock, who will furnish him in lieu of it, with the Coin of which he stands in need. Hence in a sound and settled state of the public funds, a man possessed of a sum in them can embrace any scheme of business, which offers, with as much confidence as if he were possessed of an equal sum in Coin.  
This operation of public funds as capital is too obvious to be denied; but it is objected to the Idea of their operating as an augmentation of the Capital of the community, that they serve to occasion the destruction of some other capital to an equal amount.  
The Capital which alone they can be supposed to destroy must consist of—The annual revenue, which is applied to the payment of Interest on the debt, and to the gradual redemption of the principal—The amount of the Coin, which is employed in circulating the funds, or, in other words, in effecting the different alienations which they undergo.  
But the following appears to be the true and accurate view of this matter.  
  
1st. As to the point of the Annual Revenue requisite for Payment of interest and redemption of principal.  
As a determinate proportion will tend to perspicuity in the reasoning, let it be supposed that the annual revenue to be applied, corresponding with the modification of the 6 per Cent stock of the United States, is in the ratio of eight upon the hundred, that is in the first instance six on Account of interest, and two on account of Principal.  
Thus far it is evident, that the Capital destroyed to the capital created, would bear no greater proportion, than 8 to 100. There would be withdrawn from the total mass of other capitals a sum of eight dollars to be paid to the public creditor; while he would be possessed of a sum of One Hundred dollars, ready to be applied to any purpose, to be embarked in any enterprize, which might appear to him eligible. Here then the Augmentation of Capital, or the excess of that which is produced, beyond that which is destroyed is equal to Ninety two dollars. To this conclusion, it may be objected, that the sum of Eight dollars is to be withdrawn annually, until the whole hundred is extinguished, and it may be inferred, that in process of time a capital will be destroyed equal to that which is at first created.  
But it is nevertheless true, that during the whole of the interval, between the creation of the Capital of 100 dollars, and its reduction to a sum not greater than that of the annual revenue appropriated to its redemption—there will be a greater active capital in existence than if no debt had been Contracted. The sum drawn from other Capitals in any one year will not exceed eight dollars; but there will be at every instant of time during the whole period, in question a sum corresponding with so much of the principal, as remains unredeemed, in the hands of some person, or other, employed, or ready to be employed in some profitable undertaking. There will therefore constantly be more capital, in capacity to be employed, than capital taken from employment. The excess for the first year has been stated to be Ninety two dollars; it will diminish yearly, but there always will be an excess, until the principal of the debt is brought to a level with the redeeming annuity, that is, in the case which has been assumed by way of example, to eight dollars. The reality of this excess becomes palpable, if it be supposed, as often happens, that the citizen of a foreign Country imports into the United States 100 dollars for the purchase of an equal sum of public debt. Here is an absolute augmentation of the mass of Circulating Coin to the extent of 100 dollars. At the end of a year the foreigner is presumed to draw back eight dollars on account of his Principal and Interest, but he still leaves, Ninety two of his original Deposit in circulation, as he in like manner leaves Eighty four at the end of the second year, drawing back then also the annuity of Eight Dollars: And thus the Matter proceeds; The capital left in circulation diminishing each year, and coming nearer to the level of the annuity drawnback. There are however some differences in the ultimate operation of the part of the debt, which is purchased by foreigners, and that which remains in the hands of citizens. But the general effect in each case, though in different degrees, is to add to the active capital of the Country.  
Hitherto the reasoning has proceeded on a concession of the position, that there is a destruction of some other capital, to the extent of the annuity appropriated to the payment of the Interest and the redemption of the principal of the deb⟨t⟩ but in this, too much has been conceded. There is at most a temp⟨orary⟩ transfer of som

e other capital, to the amount of the Annuity, from those who pay to the Creditor who receives; which he again restor⟨es⟩ to the circulation to resume the offices of a capital. This he does ei⟨ther⟩ immediately by employing the money in some branch of Industry, or mediately by lending it to some other person, who does so employ ⟨it⟩ or by spending it on his own maintenance. In either sup⟨position⟩ there is no destruction of capital, there is nothing more ⟨than a⟩ suspension of its motion for a time; that is, while it is ⟨passing⟩ from the hands of those who pay into the Public coffers, &amp; thence ⟨through⟩ the public Creditor into some other Channel of circulation. ⟨When⟩ the payments of interest are periodical and quick and made by instrumentality of Banks the diversion or suspension of capita⟨l⟩ may almost be denominated momentary. Hence the deduction on this Account is far less, than it at first sight appears to be.  
There is evidently, as far as regards the annuity no destruction nor transfer of any other Capital, than that por⟨tion⟩ of the income of each individual, which goes to make up the Annuity. The land which furnishes the Farmer with the s⟨um⟩ which he is to contribute remains the same; and the like m⟨ay⟩ be observed of other Capitals. Indeed as far as the Tax, w⟨hich⟩ is the object of contribution (as frequently happens, when it doe⟨s⟩ not oppress, by its weight) may have been a Motive to greate⟨r⟩ exertion in any occupation; it may even serve to encrease the contributory Capital: This idea is not without importanc⟨e⟩ in the general view of the subject.  
It remains to see, what further deduction ought to be mad⟨e⟩ from the capital which is created, by the existence of the Debt; on account of the coin, which is employed in its circulation. This is susceptible of much less precise calculation, than the Article which has been just discussed. It is impossible to say what proportion of coin is necessary to carry on the alienations which any species of property usually undergoes. The quantity indeed varies according to circumstances. But it may still without hesitation be pronounced, from the quickness of the rotation, or rather of the transitions, that the medium of circulation always bears but a small proportion to the amount of the property circulated. And it is thence satisfactorily deducible, that the coin employed in the Negociations of the funds and which serves to give them activity, as capital, is incomparably less than the sum of the debt negotiated for the purposes of business.  
  
It ought not, however, to be omitted, that the negotiation of the funds becomes itself a distinct business; which employs, and by employing diverts a portion of the circulating coin from other pursuits. But making due allowance for this circumstance there is no reason to conclude, that the effect of the diversion of coin in the whole operation bears any considerable proportion to the amount of the Capital to which it gives activity. The sum of the debt in circulation is continually at the Command, of any useful enterprise—the coin itself which circulates it, is never more than momentarily suspended from its ordinary functions. It experiences an incessant and rapid flux and reflux to and from the Channels of industry to those of speculations in the funds.  
There are strong circumstances in confirmation of this Theory. The force of Monied Capital which has been displayed in Great Britain, and the height to which every species of industry has grown up under it, defy a solution from the quantity of coin which that kingdom has ever possessed. Accordingly it has been Coeval with its funding system, the prevailing opinion of the men of business, and of the generality of the most sagacious theorists of that country, that the operation of the public funds as capital has contributed to the effect in question. Among ourselves appearances thus far favour the same Conclusion. Industry in general seems to have been reanimated. There are symptoms indicating an extension of our Commerce. Our navigation has certainly of late had a Considerable spring, and there appears to be in many parts of the Union a command of capital, which till lately, since the revolution at least, was unknown. But it is at the same time to be acknowledged, that other circumstances have concurred, (and in a great degree) in producing the present state of things, and that the appearances are not yet sufficiently decisive, to be intirely relied upon.  
In the question under discussion, it is important to distinguish between an absolute increase of Capital, or an accession of real wealth, and an artificial increase of Capital, as an engine of business, or as an instrument of industry and Commerce. In the first sense, a funded debt has no pretensions to being deemed an increase of Capital; in the last, it has pretensions which are not easy to be controverted. Of a similar nature is bank credit and in an inferior degree, every species of private credit.  
  
But though a funded debt is not in the first instance, an absolute increase of Capital, or an augmentation of real wealth; yet by serving as a New power in the operation of industry, it has within certain bounds a tendency to increase the real wealth of a Community, in like manner as money borrowed by a thrifty farmer, to be laid out in the improvement of his farm may, in the end, add to his Stock of real riches.  
There are respectable individuals, who from a just aversion to an accumulation of Public debt, are unwilling to concede to it any kind of utility, who can discern no good to alleviate the ill with which they suppose it pregnant; who cannot be persuaded that it ought in any sense to be viewed as an increase of capital lest it should be inferred, that the more debt the more capital, the greater the burthens the greater the blessings of the community.  
But it interests the public Councils to estimate every object as it truly is; to appreciate how far the good in any measure is compensated by the ill; or the ill by the good, Either of them is seldom unmixed.  
Neither will it follow, that an accumulation of debt is desireable, because a certain degree of it operates as capital. There may be a plethora in the political, as in the Natural body; There may be a state of things in which any such artificial capital is unnecessary. The debt too may be swelled to such a size, as that the greatest part of it may cease to be useful as a Capital, serving only to pamper the dissipation of idle and dissolute individuals: as that the sums required to pay the Interest upon it may become oppressive, and beyond the means, which a government can employ, consistently with its tranquility, to raise them; as that the resources of taxation, to face the debt, may have been strained too far to admit of extensions adequate to exigencies, which regard the public safety.  
Where this critical point is, cannot be pronounced, but it is impossible to believe, that there is not such a point.  
And as the vicissitudes of Nations beget a perpetual tendency to the accumulation of debt, there ought to be in every government a perpetual, anxious and unceasing effort to reduce that, which at any time exists, as fast as shall be practicable consistently with integrity and good faith.  
Reasonings on a subject comprehending ideas so abstract and complex, so little reducible to precise calculation as those which enter into the question just discussed, are always attended with a danger of runing into fallacies. Due allowance ought therefore to be made for this possibility. But as far as the Nature of the subject admits of it, there appears to be satisfactory ground for a belief, that the public funds operate as a resource of capital to the Citizens of the United States, and, if they are a resource at all, it is an extensive one.  
To all the arguments which are brought to evince the impracticability of success in manufacturing establishments in the United States, it might have been a sufficient answer to have referred to the experience of what has been already done. It is certain that several important branches have grown up and flourished with a rapidity which surprises: affording an encouraging assurance of success in future attempts: of these it may not be improper to enumerate the most considerable.

Besides manufactories of these articles which are carried on as regular Trades, and have attained to a considerable degree of maturity, there is a vast scene of household manufacturing, which contributes more largely to the supply of the Community, than could be imagined; without having made it an object of particular enquiry. This observation is the pleasing result of the investigation, to which the subject of the report has led, and is applicable as well to the Southern as to the middle and Northern States; great quantities of coarse cloths, coatings, serges, and flannels, linsey Woolseys, hosiery of Wool, cotton &amp; thread, coarse fustians, jeans and Muslins, check⟨ed⟩ and striped cotton and linen goods, bed ticks, Coverlets and Counterpanes, Tow linens, coarse shirtings, sheetings, toweling and table linen, and various mixtures of wool and cotton, and of Cotton &amp; flax are made in the household way, and in many instances to an extent not only sufficient for the supply of the families in which they are made, but for sale, and (even in some cases) for exportation. It is computed in a number of districts that ⅔¾ and even 4/5 of all the clothing of the Inhabitants are made by themselves. The importance of so great a progress, as appears to have been made in family Manufactures, within a few years, both in a moral and political view, renders the fact highly interesting.  
Neither does the above enumeration comprehend all the articles, that are manufactured as regular Trades. Many others occur, which are equally well established, but which not being of equal importance have been omitted. And there are many attempts still in their Infancy, which though attended with very favorable appearances, could not have been properly comprized in an enumeration of manufactories, already established. There are other articles also of great importance, which tho’ strictly speaking manufactures are omitted, as being immediately connected with husbandry: such are flour, pot &amp; pearl ash, Pitch, tar, turpentine and the like.  
There remains to be noticed an objection to the encouragement of manufactures, of a nature different from those which question the probability of success. This is derived from its supposed tendency to give a monopoly of advantages to particula⟨r⟩ classes at the expence of the rest of the community, who, it is affirmed, would be able to procure the requisite supplies of manufactured articles on better terms from foreigners, than from our own Citizens, and who it is alledged, are reduced to a necessity of paying an enhanced price for whatever they want, by every measure, which obstructs the free competition of foreign commoditi⟨es.⟩  
It is not an unreasonable supposition, that measures, which serve to abridge the free competition of foreign Articles, have a tendency to occasion an enhancement of prices and it is not to be denied that such is the effect in a number of Cases; but the fact does not uniformly correspond with the theory. A reduction of prices has in several instances immediately succeeded the establishment of a domestic manufacture. Whether it be that foreign Manufacturers endeavour to suppla⟨nt⟩ by underselling our own, or whatever else be the cause, the effect has been such as is stated, and the reverse of what mig⟨ht⟩ have been expected.  
But though it were true, that the immedi⟨ate⟩ and certain effect of regulations controuling the competition of foreign with domestic fabrics was an increase of price, it is universally true, that the contrary is the ultimate effect with every successful manufacture. When a domestic manufacture has attained to perfection, and has engaged in the prosecution of it a competent number of Persons, it invariably becomes cheaper. Being free from the heavy charges, which attend the importation of foreign commodities, it can be afforded, and accordingly seldom or never fails to be sold Cheaper, in process of time, than was the foreign Article for which it is a substitute. The internal competition, which takes place, soon does away every thing like Monopoly, and by degrees reduces the price of the Article to the minimum of a reasonable profit on the Capital employed. This accords with the reason of the thing and with experience.  
Whence it follows, that it is the interest of a community with a view to eventual and permanent oeconomy, to encourage the growth of manufactures. In a national view, a temporary enhancement of price must always be well compensated by a permanent reduction of it.  
It is a reflection, which may with propriety be indulged here, that this eventual diminution of the prices of manufactured Articles; which is the result of internal manufacturing establishments, has a direct and very important tendency to benefit agriculture. It enables the farmer, to procure with a smaller quantity of his labour, the manufactured produce of which he stan⟨ds⟩ in need, and consequently increases the value of his income and property.  
The objections which are commonly made to the expediency of encouraging, and to the probability of succeeding in manufacturing pursuits, in the United states, having now been discussed; the Considerations which have appeared in the Course of the discussion, recommending that species of industry to the patronage of the Government, will be materially strengthened by a few general and some particular topics, which have been naturally reserved for subsequent Notice.  
I   There seems to be a moral certainty, that the trade of a country which is both manufacturing and Agricultural will be more lucrative and prosperous, than that of a Country, which is, merely Agricultural.  
One reason for this is found in that general effort of nations (which has been already mentioned) to procure from their own soils, the articles of prime necessity requisite to their own consumption and use; and which serves to render their demand for a foreign supply of such articles in a great degree occasional and contingent. Hence, while the necessities of nations exclusively devoted to Agriculture, for the fabrics of manufacturing st⟨ates⟩ are constant and regular, the wants of the latter for the products of the former, are liable to very considerable fluctuations and interruptions. The great inequalities resulting from difference of seasons, have been elsewhere remarked: This uniformity of deman⟨d⟩ on one side, and unsteadiness of it, on the other, must necessarily ha⟨ve⟩ a tendency to cause the general course of the exchange of commodit⟨ies⟩ between the parties to turn to the disadvantage of the merely agricultural States. Peculiarity of situation, a climate and soil ada⟨pted⟩ to the production of peculiar commodities, may, sometimes, contradi⟨ct⟩ the rule; but there is every reason to believe that it will be fou⟨nd⟩ in the Main, a just one.  
Another circumstance which gives a superiority of commercial advantages to states, that manufact⟨ure⟩ as well as cultivate, consists in the more numerous attractions, which a more diversified market offers to foreign Customers, and greater scope, which it affords to mercantile enterprise. It is ⟨a⟩ position of indisputable truth in Commerce, depending too on very obvious reasons, that the greatest resort will ever be to those mar⟨ts⟩ where commodities, while equally abundant, are most various. Each difference of kind holds out an additional inducement. And it is a position not less clear, that the field of enterprise must be enlarged to the Merchants of a Country, in proportion ⟨to⟩ the variety as well as the abundance of commodities which they find at home for exportation to foreign Markets.  
A third circumstance, perhaps not inferior to either of the other two, conferring the superiority which has been stated has relation to the stagnations of demand for certain commodities which at some time or other interfere more or less with the sale of all. The Nation which can bring to Market, but few articles is likely to be more quickly and sensibly affected by such stagnations, than one, which is always possessed of a great variety of commodities. The former frequently finds too great a proportion of its stock of materials, for sale or exchange, lying on hand—or is obliged to make injurious sacrifices to supply its wants of foreign articles, which are Numerous and urgent, in proportion to the smallness of the number of its own. The latter commonly finds itself indemnified, by the high prices of some articles, for the low prices of others—and the Prompt and advantageous sale of those articles which are in demand enables its merchant the better to wait for a favorable change, in respect to those which are not. There is ground to believe, that a difference of situation, in this particular, has immensely different effec⟨ts⟩ upon the wealth and prosperity of Nations.  
From these circumstances collectively, two important inferences are to be drawn, one, that there is always a higher probability of a favorable balance of Trade, in regard to countries in which manufactures founded on the basis of a thriving Agriculture flourish, than in regard to those, which are confined wholly or almost wholly to Agriculture; the other (which is also a consequence of the first) that countries of the former description are likely to possess more pecuniary wealth, or money, than those of the latter.  
Facts appear to correspond with this conclusion. The importations of manufactured supplies seem invariably to drain the merely Agricultural people of their wealth. Let the situation of the manufacturing countries of Europe be compared in this particular, with that of Countries which only cultivate, and the disparity will be striking. Other causes, it is true, help to Account for this disparity between some of them; and among these causes, the relative state of Agriculture; but between others of them, the most prominent circumstance of dissimilitude arises from the Comparative state of Manufactures. In corroboration of the same idea, it ought not to escape remark, that the West India Islands, the soils of which are the most fertile, and the Nation, which in the greatest degree supplies the rest of the world, with the precious metals, exchange to a loss with almost every other Country.  
As far as experience at home may guide, it will lead to the same conclusion. Previous to the revolution, the quantity of coin, possessed by the colonies, which now compose the United states, appeared, to be inadequate to their circulation; and their debt to Great-Britain was progressive. Since the Revolution, the States, in which manufactures have most increased, have recovered fastest from the injuries of the late War, and abound most in pecuniary resources.  
It ought to be admitted, however in this as in the preceding case, that causes irrelative to the state of manufactures account, in a degree, for the Phœnomena remarked. The continual progress of new settlements has a natural tendency to occasion an unfavorable balance of Trade; though it indemnifies for the inconvenience, by that increase of the national capital which flows from the conversion of waste into improved lands: And the different degrees of external commerce, which are carried on by the different States, may make material differences in the comparative state of their wealth. The first circumstance has reference to the deficien⟨cy⟩ of coin and the increase of debt previous to the revolution; the last to the advantages which the most manufacturing states appear to have enjoyed, over the others, since the termination of the late War.  
But the uniform appearance of an abundance of specie, as the concomitant of a flourishing state of manufacture⟨s⟩ and of the reverse, where they do not prevail, afford a strong presumption of their favourable operation upon the wealth of a Country.  
Not only the wealth; but the independence and security of a Country, appear to be materially connected with the prosperity of manufactures. Every nation, with a view to those great objects, ought to endeavour to possess within itself all the essentials of national supply. These comprise the means of Subsistence habitation clothing and defence.  
The possession of these is necessary to the perfection of the body politic, to the safety as well as to the welfare of the society; the want of either, is the want of an important organ of political life and Motion; and in the various crises which await a state, it must severely feel the effects of any such deficiency. The extreme embarrassments of the United States during the late War, from an incapacity of supplying themselves, are still matter of keen recollection: A future war might be expected again to exemplify the mischiefs and dangers of a situation, to which that incapacity is still in too great a degree applicable, unless changed by timely and vigorous exertion. To effect this change as fast as shall be prudent, merits all the attention and all the Zeal of our Public Councils; ’tis the next great work to be accomplished.  
The want of a Navy to protect our external commerce, as long as it shall Continue, must render it a peculiarly precarious reliance, for the supply of essential articles, and must serve to strengthen prodigiously the arguments in favour of manufactures.  
To these general Considerations are added some of a more particular nature.  
Our distance from Europe, the great fountain of manufactured supply, subjects us in the existing state of things, to inconvenience and loss in two Ways.  
The bulkiness of those commodities which are the chief productions of the soil, necessarily imposes very heavy charges on their transportation, to distant markets. These charges, in the Cases, in which the nations, to whom our products are sent, maintain a Competition in the supply of their own markets, principally fall upon us, and form material deductions from the primitive value of the articles furnished. The charges on manufactured supplies, brought from Europe are greatly enhanced by the same circumstance of distance. These charges, again, in the cases in which our own industry maintains no competition, in our own markets, also principally fall upon us; and are an additional cause of extraordinary deduction from the primitive value of our own products; these bei⟨ng⟩ the materials of exchange for the foreign fabrics, which we consume.  
The equality and moderation of individual prope⟨rty⟩ and the growing settlements of new districts, occasion in this country an unusual demand for coarse manufactures; The charges of which being greater in proportion to their greater bulk augment the disadvantage, which has been just described.  
As in most countries domestic supplie⟨s⟩ maintain a very considerable competition with such foreign productions of the soil, as are imported for sale; if the extensive establishment of Manufactories in the United states does not create a similar competition in respect to manufactured articles, it appears to be clearly deducible, from the Considerations which have been mentioned, that they must sustain a double loss in their exchanges with foreign Nations; strongly conducive to an unfavorable balance of Trade, and very prejudicial to their Interests.  
These disadvantages press with no small weight, on the landed interest of the Country. In seasons of peace, they cause a serious deduction from the intrinsic value of the products of the soil. In the time of a War, which shou’d either involve ourselves, or another nation, possessing a Considerable share of our carrying trade, the charges on the transportation of our commodities, bulky as most of them are, could hardly fail to prove a grievous burthen to the farmer; while obliged to depend in so great degree as he now does, upon foreign markets for the vent of the surplus of his labour.  
As far as the prosperity of the Fisheries of the United states is impeded by the want of an adequate market, there arises another special reason for desiring the extension of manufactures. Besides the fish, which in many places, would be likely to make a part of the subsistence of the persons employed; it is known that the oils, bones and skins of marine animals, are of extensive use in various manufactures. Hence the prospect of an additional demand for the produce of the Fisheries.  
  
One more point of view only remains in which to Consider the expediency of encouraging manufactures in the United states.  
It is not uncommon to meet with an opin⟨ion⟩ that though the promoting of manufactures may be the interest of a part of the Union, it is contrary to that of another part. The Northern &amp; southern regions are sometimes represented as having adverse interests in this respect. Those are called Manufacturing, these Agricultural states; and a species of opposition is imagined to subsist between the Manufacturing a⟨nd⟩ Agricultural interests.  
This idea of an opposition between those two interests is the common error of the early periods of every country, but experience gradually dissipates it. Indeed they are perceived so often to succour and to befriend each other, that they come at length to be considered as one: a supposition which has been frequently abused and is not universally true. Particular encouragements of particular manufactures may be of a Nature to sacrifice the interests of landholders to those of manufacturers; But it is nevertheless a maxim well established by experience, and generally acknowledged, where there has been sufficient experience, that the aggregate prosperity of manufactures, and the aggregate prosperity of Agriculture are intimately connected. In the Course of the discussion which has had place, various weighty considerations have been adduced operating in support of that maxim. Perhaps the superior steadiness of the demand of a domestic market for the surplus produce of the soil, is alone a convincing argument of its truth.  
Ideas of a contrariety of interests between the Northern and southern regions of the Union, are in the Main as unfounded as they are mischievous. The diversity of Circumstances on which such contrariety is usually predicated, authorises a directly contrary conclusion. Mutual wants constitute one of the strongest links of political connection, and the extent of the⟨se⟩ bears a natural proportion to the diversity in the means of mutual supply.  
Suggestions of an opposite complexion are ever to be deplored, as unfriendly to the steady pursuit of one great common cause, and to the perfect harmony of all the parts.  
In proportion as the mind is accustomed to trace the intimate connexion of interest, which subsists between all the parts of a Society united under the same government—the infinite variety of channels which serve to Circulate the prosper⟨ity⟩ of each to and through the rest—in that proportion will it be little apt to be disturbed by solicitudes and Apprehensions which originate in local discriminations. It is a truth as important as it is agreeable, and one to which it is not easy to imagine exceptions, that every thing tending to establish substantial and permanent order, in the affairs of a Country, to increase the total mass of industry and opulence, is ultimately beneficial to every part of it. On the Credit of this great truth, an acquiescence may safely be accorded, from every quarter, to all institutions &amp; arrangements, which promise a confirmation of public order, and an augmentation of National Resource.  
But there are more particular considerations which serve to fortify the idea, that the encouragement of manufactures is the interest of all parts of the Union. If the Northern and middle states should be the principal scenes of such establishments, they would immediately benefit the more southern, by creating a demand for productions; some of which they have in common with the other states, and others of which are either peculiar to them, or more abundant, or of better quality, than elsewhere. These productions, principally are Timber, flax, Hemp, Cotton, Wool, raw silk, Indigo, iron, lead, furs, hides, skins and coals. Of these articles Cotton &amp; Indigo are peculiar to the southern states; as are hitherto Lead &amp; Coal. Flax and Hemp are or may be raised in greater abundance there, than in the More Northern states; and the Wool of Virginia is said to be of better quality than that of any other state: a Circumstance rendered the more probable by the reflection that Virginia embraces the same latitudes with the finest Wool Countries of Europe. The Climate of the south is also better adapted to the production of silk.  
The extensive cultivation of Cotton can perhaps hardly be expected, but from the previous establishment of domestic Manufactories of the Article; and the surest encouragement and vent, for the others, would result from similar establishments in respect to them.  
If then, it satifactorily appears, that it is the Interest of the United states, generally, to encourage manufactures, it merits particular attention, that there are circumstances, which Render the present a critical moment for entering with Zeal upon the important business. The effort cannot fail to be materially seconded by a considerable and encreasing influx of money, in consequence of foreign speculations in the funds—and by the disorders, which exist in different parts of Europe.  
The first circumstance not only facilita⟨tes⟩ the execution of manufacturing enterprises; but it indicates them as a necessary mean to turn the thing itself to advantage, and to prevent its being eventually an evil. If useful employment be not found for the Money of foreigners brought to the country to be invested in purchase⟨s⟩ of the public debt, it will quickly be reexported to defray the expence of an extraordinary consumption of foreign luxuries; and distressing drains of our specie may hereafter be experienced to pay the interest and redeem the principal of the purchased debt.  
This useful employment too ought to be of a Nature to produce solid and permanent improvements. If the money merely serves to give a temporary spring to foreign commerce; as it cannot procure new and lasting outlets for the products of the Country; there will be no real or durable advantage gained. As far as it shall find its way in Agricultural ameliorations, in opening canals, and in similar improvements, it will be productive of substantial utility. But there is reason to doubt, whether in such channels it is likely to find sufficient employment, and still more whether many of those who possess it, would be as readily attracted to objects of this nature, as to manufacturing pursuits; which bear greater analogy to those to which they are accustomed, and to the spirit generated by them.  
To open the one field, as well as the other, will at least secure a better prospect of useful employment, for whatever accession of money, there has been or may be.  
There is at the present juncture a certain fermentation of mind, a certain activity of speculation and enterprise which if properly directed may be made subservient to useful purposes; but which if left entirely to itself, may be attended with pernicious effects.  
The disturbed state of Europe, inclining its citizens to emigration, the requisite workmen, will be more easily acquired, than at another time; and the effect of multiplying the opportunities of employment to those who emigrate, may be an increase of the number and extent of valuable acquisitions to the population arts and industry of the Country. To find pleasure in the calamities of other nations, would be criminal; but to benefit ourselves, by opening an asylum to those who suffer, in consequence of them, is as justifiable as it is pol⟨itic.⟩  
A full view having now been taken of the inducements to the promotion of Manufactures in the United states, accompanied with an examination of the principal objections which are commonly urged in opposition, it is proper in the next place, to consider the means, by which it may be effected, as introductory to a Specification of the objects which in the present state of things appear the most fit to be encouraged, and of the particular measures which it may be adviseable to adopt, in respect to each.  
In order to a better judgment of the Means proper to be resorted to by the United states, it will be of use to Advert to those which have been employed with success in other Countries. The principal of these are.  
I   Protecting duties—or duties on those foreign articles which are the rivals of the domestic ones, intended to be encouraged.  
Duties of this Nature evidently amount to a virtual bounty on the domestic fabrics since by enhancing the charges on foreign Articles, they enable the National Manufacturers to undersell all their foreign Competitors. The propriety of this species of encouragement need not be dwelt upon; as it is not only a clear result from the numerous topics which have been suggested, but is sanctioned by the laws of the United states in a variety of instances; it has the additional recommendat⟨ion⟩ of being a resource of revenue. Indeed all the duties imposed on imported articles, though with an exclusive view to Revenue, have the effect in Contemplation, and except where they fall on raw materials wear a beneficent aspect towards the manufactures of the Country.  
II.   Prohibitions of rival articles or duties equivalent to prohibitions.  
This is another and an efficacious mean of encouraging national manufactures, but in general it is only fit to be employed when a manufacture, has made such a progress and is in so many hands as to insure a due competition, and an adequate supply on reasonable terms. Of duties equivalent to prohibitions, there are examples in the Laws of the United States, and there are other Cases to which the principle may be advantageously extended, but they are not numero⟨us.⟩  
Considering a monopoly of the domestic market to its own manufacturers as the reigning policy of manufacturing Nations, a similar policy on the part of the United states in every proper instance, is dictated, it might almost be said, by the principles of distributive justice; certainly by the duty of endeavouring to secure to their own Citizens a reciprocity of advantages.  
III   Prohibitions of the exportation of the materials of manufactures.  
The desire of securing a cheap and plentiful supply for the national workmen, and, where the article is either peculiar to the Country, or of peculiar quality there, the jealousy of enabling foreign workmen to rival those of the nation, with its ow⟨n⟩ Materials, are the leading motives to this species of regulation. ⟨It⟩ ought not to be affirmed, that it is in no instance proper, but it is certainly one which ought to be adopted with great circumspect⟨ion⟩ and only in very plain Cases. It is seen at once, that its immedi⟨ate⟩ operation, is to abridge the demand and keep down the price of the produce of some other branch of industry, generally speaking, of Agriculture, to the prejudice of those, who carry it on; and tho⟨ough⟩ if it be really essential to the prosperity of any very important nati⟨onal⟩ Manufacture, it may happen that those who are injured in the first instance, may be eventually indemnified, by the superior ⟨steadiness⟩ of an extensive domestic market, depending on that prosperity: yet in a matter, in which there is so much room for nice and difficult combinations, in which such opposite considerations combat each other, prudence seems to dictate, that the expedient in question, ought to be indulged with a sparing hand.  
IV Pecuniary bounties  
This has been found one of the most efficacious means of encouraging manufactures, and it is in some views, the best. Though it has not yet been practiced upon by the Government of the United states (unless the allowance on the exportation of dried and pickled Fish and salted meat could be considered as a bounty) and though it is less favored by public opinion than some other modes.  
Its advantages, are these—  
1   It is a species of encouragement more positive and direct than any other, and for that very reason, has a more immediate tendency to stimulate and uphold new enterprises, increasing the chances of profit, and diminishing the risks of loss, in the first attempts.  
2.   It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary augmentation of price, which is incident to some other modes, or it produces it to a less degree; either by making no addition to the charges on the rival foreign article, as in the Case of protecting duties, or by making a smaller addition. The first happens when the fund for the bounty is derived from a different object (which may or may not increase the price of some other article, according to the nature of that object) the second, when the fund is derived from the same or a similar object of foreign manufacture. One per cent duty on the foreign article converted into a bounty on the domestic, will have an equal effect with a duty of two per Cent, exclusive of such bounty; and the price of the foreign commodity is liable to be raised, in the one Case, in the proportion of 1 ⅌ Cent; in the other, in that of two ⅌ Cent. Indeed the bounty when drawn from another source is calculated to promote a reduction of price, because without laying any new charge on the foreign article, it serves to introduce a competition with it, and to increase the total quantity of the article in the Market.  
3   Bounties have not like high protecting duties, a tendency to produce scarcity. An increase of price is not always the immediate, though, where the progress of a domestic Manufacture does not counteract a rise, it is commonly the ultimate effect of an additional duty. In the interval, between the laying of the duty and a proportional increase of price, it may discourage importation, by interfering with the profits to be expected from the sale of the article.  
4.   Bounties are sometimes not only the best, but the only proper expedient, for uniting the encouragement of a new object of agriculture, with that of a new object of manufacture. It is the Interest of the farmer to have the production of the raw material promoted, by counteracting the interference of the foreig⟨n⟩ material of the same kind. It is the interest of the manufactu⟨rer⟩ to have the material abundant and cheap. If prior to the domes⟨tic⟩ production of the Material, in sufficient quantity, to supply the manufacturer on good terms; a duty be laid upon the importation of it from abroad, with a view to promote the raising of it at home, the Interests both of the Farmer and Manufacturer will be disserved. By either destroying the requisite supply, or raising the price of the article, beyond what can be afforded to be given for it, by the Conductor of an infant manufacture, it is abandoned or fails; an⟨d⟩ there being no domestic manufactories to create a demand for t⟨he⟩ raw material, which is raised by the farmer, it is in vain, that the Competition of the like foreign article may have been destroy⟨ed.⟩  
It cannot escape notice, that a duty upon the importation of ⟨an⟩ article can no otherwise aid the domestic production of it, than giving the latter greater advantages in the home market. It ca⟨n⟩ have no influence upon the advantageous sale of the article produced, in foreign markets; no tendency, there⟨fore⟩ to promote its exportation.  
The true way to conciliate these two interests, is to lay a duty on foreign manufactures of the material, the growth of which is desired to be encouraged, and to apply the produce of that duty by way of bounty, either upon the production of the material itself or upon its manufacture at home or upon both. In this disposition of the thing, the Manufacturer commences his enterprise under every advantage, which is attainable, as to quantity or price, of the raw material: And the Farmer if the bounty be immediately to him, is enabled by it to enter into a successful competition with the foreign material; if the bounty be to the manufacturer on so much of the domestic material as he consumes, the operation is nearly the same; he has a motive of interest to prefer the domestic Commodity, if of equal quality, even at a higher price than the foreign, so long as the difference of price is any thing short of the bounty which is allowed upon the article.  
Except the simple and ordinary kinds of household Manufactures, or those for which there are very commanding local advantages, pecuniary bounties are in most cases indispensable to the introduction of a new branch. A stimulus and a support not less powerful and direct is generally speaking essential to the overcoming of the obstacles which arise from the Competitions of superior skill and maturity elsewhere. Bounties are especially essential, in regard to articles, upon which those foreigners, who have been accustomed to supply a Country, are in the practice of granting them.  
The continuance of bounties on manufactures long established must almost always be of questionable policy: Because a presumption would arise in every such Case, that there were natural and inherent impediments to success. But in new undertakings, they are as justifiable, as they are oftentimes necessary.  
There is a degree of prejudice against bounties from an appearance of giving away the public money, without an immediate consideration, and from a supposition, that they serve to enrich particular classes, at the expence of the Community.  
But neither of these sources of dislike will bear a serious examination. There is no purpose, to which public money can be more beneficially applied, than to the acquisition of a new and useful branch of industry; no Consideration more valuable than a permanent addition to the general stock of productive labour.  
  
As to the second source of objection, it equally lies against other modes of encouragement, which are admitted to be eligible. As often as a duty upon a foreign article makes an addition to its price, it causes an extra expence to the Community, for the benefit of the domestic manufacturer. A bounty does no more: But it is the Interest of the society in each case, to submit to a temporary expence, which is more than compensated, by an increase of industry and Wealth, by an augmentation of resources and independence; &amp; by the circumstance of eventual cheapness, which has been noticed in another place.  
It would deserve attention, however, in the employment of this species of encouragement in the United states, as a reason for moderating the degree of it in the instances, in which it might be deemed eligible, that the great distance of this country from Europe imposes very heavy charges on all the fabrics which are brought from thence, amounting from [15 to 30] ⅌ Cent on their value, according to their bulk.  
A Question has been made concerning the Constitutional right of the Government of the United States to apply this species of encouragement, but there is certainly no good foundation for such a question. The National Legislature has express authority “To lay and Collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the Common defence and general welfare” with no other qualifications than that “all duties, imposts and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United states, that no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to numbers ascertained by a census or enumeration taken on the principles prescribed in the Constitution, and that “no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.” These three qualifications excepted, the power to raise money is plenary, and indefinite; and the objects to which it may be appropriated are no less comprehensive, than the payment of the public debts and the providing for the common defence and “general Welfare.” The terms “general Welfare” were doubtless intended to signify more than was expressed or imported in those which Preceded; otherwise numerous exigencies incident to the affairs of a Nation would have been left without a provision. The phrase is as comprehensive as any that could have been used; because it was not fit that the constitutional authority of the Union, to appropriate its revenues shou’d have been restricted within narrower limits than the “General Welfare” and because this necessarily embraces a vast variety of particulars, which are susceptible neither of specification nor of definition.  
It is therefore of necessity left to the discretion of the National Legislature, to pronounce, upon the objects, which concern the general Welfare, and for which under that description, an appropriation of money is requisite and proper. And there seems to be no room for a doubt that whatever concerns the general Interests of learning of Agriculture of Manufactures and of Commerce are within the sphere of the national Councils as far as regards an application of Money.  
The only qualification of the generallity of the Phrase in question, which seems to be admissible, is this—That the object to which an appropriation of money is to be made be General and not local; its operation extending in fact, or by possibility, throughout the Union, and not being confined to a particular spot.  
No objection ought to arise to this construction from a supposition that it would imply a power to do whatever else should appear to Congress conducive to the General Welfare. A power to appropriate money with this latitude which is granted too in express terms would not carry a power to do any other thing, not authorised in the constitution, either expressly or by fair implication.  
V. Premiums  
These are of a Nature allied to bounties, though distinguishable from them, in some important features.  
Bounties are applicable to the whole quantity of an article produced, or manufactured, or exported, and involve a correspondent expence. Premiums serve to reward some particular excellence or superiority, some extraordinary exertion or skill, and are dispensed on⟨ly⟩ in a small number of cases. But their effect is to stimulate gener⟨al⟩ effort. Contrived so as to be both honorary and lucrative, they address themselves to different passions; touching the chords as well of emulation as of Interest. They are accordingly a very economical mean of exciting the enterprise of a Whole Community.  
There are various Societies in different countries, whose object is the dispensation of Premiums for the encouragemen⟨t⟩ of Agriculture Arts manufactures and Commerce; and though they are for the most part voluntary associations, with comparatively slender funds, their utility has been immense. Much has been done by this mean in great Britain: Scotland in particular owes materially to it a prodigious amelioration of Condition. From a similar establishment in the United states, supplied and supported by the Government of the Union, vast benefits might reasonably be expected. Some further ideas on this head, shall accordingly be submitted, in the conclusion of this report.  
VI   The Exemption of the Materials of manufactures from duty.  
The policy of that Exemption as a general rule, particularly in reference to new Establishments, is obvious. It can hardly ever be adviseable to add the obstructions of fiscal burthens to the difficulties which naturally embarrass a new manufacture; and where it is matured and in condition to become an object of revenue, it is generally speaking better that the fabric, than the Material should be the subject of Taxation. Ideas of proportion between the quantum of the tax and the value of the article, can be more easily adjusted, in the former, than in the latter case. An argument for exemptions of this kind in the United States, is to be derived from the practice, as far as their necessities have permitted, of those nations whom we are to meet as competitors in our own and in foreign Markets.  
There are however exceptions to it; of which some examples will be given under the next head.  
The Laws of the Union afford instances of the observance of the policy here recommended, but it will probably be found adviseable to extend it to some other Cases. Of a nature, bearing some affinity to that policy is the regulation which exempts from duty the tools and implements, as well as the books, cloths and household furniture of foreign artists, who come to reside in the United states; an advantage already secured to them by the Laws of the Union, and which, it is, in every view, proper to Continue.  
VII   Drawbacks of the duties which are imposed on the Materials of Manufactures.  
It has already been observed as a general rule that duties on those materials, ought with certain exceptions to be foreborne. Of these exceptions, three cases occur, which may serve as examples—one—where the material is itself, an object of general or extensive consumption, and a fit and productive source of revenue: Another, where a manufacture of a simpler kind [the competition of which with a like domestic article is desired to be restrained,] partakes of the Nature of a raw material, from being capable, by a further process to be converted into a manufacture of a different kind, the introduction or growth of which is desired to be encouraged; a third where the Material itself is a production of the Country, and in sufficient abundance to furnish cheap and plentiful supply to the national Manufacturer.  
  
Under the first description comes the article of Molasses. It is not only a fair object of revenue; but being a sweet, it is just that the consumers of it should pay a duty as well as the Consumer⟨s⟩ of sugar.  
Cottons and linens in their White state fall under the second description. A duty upon such as are imported is proper to promote the domestic Manufacture of similar articles in the same state. A drawback of that duty is proper to encourage the printing and staining at home of those which are brought from abroad: When the first of these manufac⟨tures⟩ has attained sufficient maturity in a Country, to furnish a full supply for ⟨the⟩ second, the utility of the drawback ceases.  
The article of Hemp either now does or may be expected soon to exemplify the third Case, in the United states.  
Where duties on the materials of manufactures are not laid for the purpose of preventing a competition with some domestic production, the same reasons which recommend, as a general rule, the exemption of those materials from duties, would recommend as a like General rule, the allowance of draw backs, in favor of the manufacturer. Accordingly such drawbacks are familiar in countries which systematically pursue the business of manufactures; which furnishes an argument for the observance of a similar policy in the United states; and the Idea has been adopted by the laws of the Union in the instances of salt and Molasses. It is believed that it will be found advantageous to extend it to some other Articles.  
VIII   The encouragement of new inventions and discoveries, at home, and of the introduction into the United States of such as may have been made in other countries; particularly those, which relate to machinery.  
  
This is among the most useful and unexceptionable of the aids, which can be given to manufactures. The usual means of that encouragement are pecuniary rewards, and, for a time, exclusive privileges. The first must be employed, according to the occasion, and the utility of the invention, or discovery: For the last, so far as respects “authors and inventors” provision has been made by Law. But it is desireable in regard to improvements and secrets of extraordinary value, to be able to extend the same benefit to Introducers, as well as Authors and Inventors; a policy which has been practiced with advantage in other countries. Here, however, as in some other cases, there is cause to regret, that the competency of the authority of the National Government to the good, which might be done, is not without a question. Many aids might be given to industry; many internal improvements of primary magnitude might be promoted, by an authority operating throughout the Union, which cannot be effected, as well, if at all, by an authority confined within the limits of a single state.  
But if the legislature of the Union cannot do all the good, that might be wished, it is at least desirable, that all may be done, which is practicable. Means for promoting the introduction of foreign improvements, though less efficaciously than might be accomplished with more adequate authority, will form a part of the plan intended to be submitted in the close of this report.  
It is customary with manufacturing nations to prohibit, under severe penalties, the exportation of implements and machines, which they have either invented or improved. There are already objects for a similar regulation in the United States; and others may be expected to occur from time to time. The adoption of it seems to be dictated by the principle of reciprocity. Greater liberality, in such respects, might better comport with the general spirit of the country; but a selfish and exclusive policy in other quarters will not always permit the free indulgence of a spirit, which would place us upon an unequal footing. As far as prohibitions tend to prevent foreign competitors from deriving the benefit of the improvements made at home, they tend to increase the advantages of those by whom they may have been introduced; and operate as an encouragement to exertion.  
IX   Judicious regulations for the inspection of manufactured commodities.  
This is not among the least important of the means, by which the prosperity of manufactures may be promoted. It is indeed in many cases one of the most essential. Contributing to prevent frauds upon consumers at home and exporters to foreign countries—to improve the quality &amp; preserve the character of the national manufactures, it cannot fail to aid the expeditious and advantageous Sale of them, and to serve as a guard against successful competition from other quarters. The reputation of the flour and lumber of some states, and of the Pot ash of others has been established by an attention to this point. And the like good name might be procured for those articles, wheresoever produced, by a judicious and uniform system of Inspection; throughout the ports of the United States. A like system might also be extended with advantage to other commodities.  
X   The facilitating of pecuniary remittances from place to place is a point of considerable moment to trade in general, and to manufactures in particular; by rendering more easy the purchase of raw materials and

ured supplies. A general circulation of Bank paper, which is to be expected from the institution lately established will be a most valuable mean to this end. But much good would also accrue from some additional provisions respecting inland bills of exchange. If those drawn in one state payable in another were made negotiable, everywhere, and interest and damages allowed in case of protest, it would greatly promote negotiations between the Citizens of different states, by rendering them more secure; and, with it the convenience and advantage of the Merchants and manufacturers of each.  
XI   The facilitating of the transportation of commodities.  
Improvements favoring this object intimately concern all the domestic interests of a community; but they may without impropriety be mentioned as having an important relation to manufactures. There is perhaps scarcely any thing, which has been better calculated to assist the manufactures of Great Britain, than the ameliorations of the public roads of that Kingdom, and the great progress which has been of late made in opening canals. Of the former, the United States stand much in need; and for the latter they present uncommon facilities.  
The symptoms of attention to the improvement of inland Navigation, which have lately appeared in some quarters, must fill with pleasure every breast warmed with a true Zeal for the prosperity of the Country. These examples, it is to be hoped, will stimulate the exertions of the Government and the Citizens of every state. There can certainly be no object, more worthy of the cares of the local administrations; and it were to be wished, that there was no doubt of the power of the national Government to lend its direct aid, on a comprehensive plan. This is one of those improvements, which could be prosecuted with more efficacy by the whole, than by any part or parts of the Union. There are cases in which the general interest will be in danger to be sacrificed to the collission of some supposed local interests. Jealousies, in matters of this kind, are as apt to exist, as they are apt to be erroneous.  
The following remarks are sufficiently judicious and pertinent to deserve a literal quotation. “Good roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expence of carriage, put the remote parts of a country more nearly upon a level with those in the neighborhood of the town. They are upon that account the greatest of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the remote, which must always be the most extensive circle of the country. They are advantageous to the Town by breaking down the monopoly of the country in its neighborhood. They are advantageous even to that part of the Country. Though they introduce some rival commodities into the old Market, they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly besides is a great enemy to good management, which can never be universally established, but in consequence of that free and universal competition, which forces every body to have recourse to it for the sake of self defence. It is not more than Fifty years ago that some of the countries in the neighborhood of London petitioned the Parliament, against the extension of the turnpike roads, into the remoter counties. Those remoter counties, they pretended, from the cheapness of Labor, would be able to sell their grass and corn cheaper in the London Market, than themselves, and they would thereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation. Their rents however have risen and their cultivation has been improved, since that time.”  
Specimens of a spirit, similar to that which governed the counties here spoken of present themselves too frequently to the eye of an impartial observer, and render it a wish of patriotism, that the body in this Country, in whose councils a local or partial spirit is least likely to predominate, were at liberty to pursue and promote the general interest, in those instances, in which there might be danger of the interference of such a spirit.  
The foregoing are the principal of the means, by which the growth of manufactures is ordinarily promoted. It is, however, not merely necessary, that the measures of government, which have a direct view to manufactures, should be calculated to assist and protect them, but that those which only collaterally affect them, in the general course of the administration, should be gaurded from any peculiar tendency to injure them.  
There are certain species of taxes, which are apt to be oppressive to different parts of the community, and among other ill effects have a very unfriendly aspect towards manufactures. All Poll or Capitation taxes are of this nature. They either proceed, according to a fixed rate, which operates unequally, and injuriously to the industrious poor; or they vest a discretion in certain officers, to make estimates and assessments which are necessarily vague, conjectural and liable to abuse. They ought therefore to be abstained from, in all but cases of distressing emergency.  
All such taxes (including all taxes on occupations) which proceed according to the amount of capital supposed to be employed in a business, or of profits supposed to be made in it are unavoidably hurtful to industry. It is in vain, that the evil may be endeavoured to be mitigated by leaving it, in the first instance, in the option of the party to be taxed, to declare the amount of his capital or profits.  
Men engaged in any trade of business have commonly weighty reasons to avoid disclosures, which would expose, with any thing like accuracy, the real state of their affairs. They most frequently find it better to risk oppression, than to avail themselves of so inconvenient a refuge. And the consequence is, that they often suffer oppression.  
When the disclosure too, if made, is not definitive, but controulable by the discretion, or in other words, by the passions &amp; prejudices of the revenue officers, it is not only an ineffectual protection, but the possibility of its being so is an additional reason for not resorting to it.  
Allowing to the public officers the most equitable dispositions; yet where they are to exercise a discretion, without certain data, they cannot fail to be often misled by appearances. The quantity of business, which seems to be going on, is, in a vast number of cases, a very deceitful criterion of the profits which are made; yet it is perhaps the best they can have, and it is the one, on which they will most naturally rely. A business therefore which may rather require aid, from the government, than be in a capacity to be contributory to it, may find itself crushed by the mistaken conjectures of the Assessors of taxes.  
Arbitrary taxes, under which denomination are comprised all those, that leave the quantum of the tax to be raised on each person, to the discretion of certain officers, are as contrary to the genius of liberty as to the maxims of industry. In this light, they have been viewed by the most judicious observers on government; who have bestowed upon them the severest epithets of reprobation; as constituting one of the worst features usually to be met with in the practice of despotic governments.  
It is certain at least, that such taxes are particularly inimical to the success of manufacturing industry, and ought carefully to be avoided by a government, which desires to promote it  
The great copiousness of the subject of this Report has insensibly led to a more lengthy preliminary discussion, than was originally contemplated, or intended. It appeared proper to investigate principles, to consider objections, and to endeavour to establish the utility of the thing proposed to be encouraged; previous to a specification of the objects which might occur, as meriting or requiring encouragement, and of the measures, which might be proper, in respect to each. The first purpose having been fulfilled, it remains to pursue the second. In the selection of objects, five circumstances seem intitled to particular attention; the capacity of the Country to furnish the raw material—the degree in which the nature of the manufacture admits of a substitute for manual labour in machinery—the facility of execution—the extensiveness of the uses, to which the article can be applied—its subserviency to other interests, particularly the great one of national defence. There are however objects, to which these circumstances are little applicable, which for some special reasons, may have a claim to encouragement.  
A designation of the principal raw material of which each manufacture is composed will serve to introduce the remarks upon it. As, in the first place—  
Iron  
The manufactures of this article are entitled to preeminent rank. None are more essential in their kinds, nor so extensive in their uses. They constitute in whole or in part the implements or the materials or both of almost every useful occupation. Their instrumentality is everywhere conspicuous.  
It is fortunate for the United States that they have peculiar advantages for deriving the full benefit of this most valuable material, and they have every motive to improve it, with systematic care. It is to be found in various parts of the United States, in great abundance and of almost every quality; and fuel the chief instrument in manufacturing it, is both cheap and plenty. This particularly applies to Charcoal; but there are productive coal mines already in operation, and strong indications, that the material is to be found in abundance, in a variety of other places.  
The inquiries to which the subject of this report has led have been answered with proofs that manufactories of Iron, though generally understood to be extensive, are far more so than is commonly supposed. The kinds, in which the greatest progress has been made, have been mentioned in another place, and need not be repeated; but there is little doubt that every other kind, with due cultivation, will rapidly succeed. It is worthy of remark that several of the particular trades, of which it is the basis, are capable of being carried on without the aid of large capitals.  
Iron works have very greatly increased in the United States and are prosecuted, with much more advantage than formerly. The average price before the revolution was about Sixty four Dollars ⅌. Ton—at present it is about Eighty; a rise which is chiefly to be attributed to the increase of manufactures of the material.  
The still further extension and multiplication of such manufactures will have the double effect of promoting the extraction of the Metal itself, and of converting it to a greater number of profitable purposes.  
Those manufactures too unite in a greater degree, than almost any others, the several requisities, which have been mentioned, as proper to be consulted in the selection of objects.  
The only further encouragement of manufactories of this article, the propriety of which may be considered as unquestionable, seems to be an increase of the duties on foreign rival commodities.  
Steel is a branch, which has already made a considerable progress, and it is ascertained that some new enterprizes, on a more extensive scale, have been lately set on foot. The facility of carrying it to an extent, which will supply all internal demands, and furnish a considerable surplus for exportation cannot be doubted. The duty upon the importation of this article, which is at present seventy five cents ⅌ Cwt., may it is conceived be safely and advantageously extended to 100 Cents. It is desireable, by decisive arrangements, to second the efforts, which are making in so very valuable a branch.  
The United States already in a great measure supply themselves with Nails &amp; Spikes. They are able, and ought certainly, to do it intirely. The first and most laborious operation, in this manufacture is performed by water mills; and of the persons afterwards employed a great proportion are boys, whose early habits of industry are of importance to the community, to the present support of their families, and to their own future comfort. It is not less curious than true, that in certain parts of the country, the making of Nails is an occasional family manufacture.  
The expendiency of an additional duty on these articles is indicated by an important fact. About one million 800,000 pounds of them were imported into the United States in the course of a year ending the 30th. of September 1790. A duty of two Cents ⅌ lb would, it is presumeable, speedily put an end to so considerable an importation. And it is in every view proper that an end should be put to it.  
The manufacture of these articles, like that of some others, suffers from the carelessness and dishonesty of a part of those who carry it on. An inspection in certain cases might tend to correct the evil. It will deserve consideration whether a regulation of this sort cannot be applied, without inconvenience, to the exportation of the articles either to foreign countries, or from one state to another.  
The implements of husbandry are made in several States in great abundance. In many places it is done by the common blacksmiths. And there is no doubt that an ample supply for the whole country can with great ease be procured among ourselves.  
Various kinds of edged tools for the use of Mechanics are also made; and a considerable quantity of hollow wares; though the business of castings has not yet attained the perfection which might be wished. It is however improving, and as there are respectable capitals in good hands, embarked in the prosecution of those branches of iron manufactories, which are yet in their infancy, they may all be contemplated as objects not difficult to be acquired.  
To ensure the end, it seems equally safe and prudent to extend the duty ad valorem upon all manufactures of Iron, or of which iron is the article of chief value, to ten per Cent.  
Fire arms and other military weapons may it is conceived, be placed without inconvenience in the class of articles rated at 15 ⅌. Cent. There are already manufactories of these articles, which only require the stimulus of a certain demand to render them adequate to the supply of the United States.  
It would also be a material aid to manufactories of this nature, as well as a mean of public security, if provision should be made for an annual purchase of military weapons, of home manufacture to a certain determinate extent, in order to the formation of Arsenals; and to replace from time to time such as should be withdrawn for use, so as always to have in store the quantity of each kind, which should be deemed a competent supply.  
But it may hereafter deserve legislative consideration, whether manufactories of all the necessary weapons of war ought not to be established, on account of the Government itself. Such establishments are agreeable to the usual practice of Nations and that practice seems founded on sufficient reason.  
There appears to be an improvidence, in leaving these essential instruments of national defence to the casual speculations of individual adventure; a resource which can less be relied upon, in this case than in most others; the articles in question not being objects of ordinary and indispensable private consumption or use. As a general rule, manufactories on the immediate account of Government are to be avoided; but this seems to be one of the few exceptions, which that rule admits, depending on very special reasons.  
Manufactures of Steel, generally, or of which steel is the article of chief value, may with advantage be placed in the class of goods rated at 7½ per Cent. As manufactures of this kind have not yet made any considerable progress, it is a reason for not rating them as high as those of iron; but as this material is the basis of them, and as their extension is not less practicable, than important, it is desireable to promote it by a somewhat higher duty than the present.  
A question arises, how far it might be expedient to permit the importation of iron in pigs and bars free from duty. It would certainly be favourable to manufactures of the article; but the doubt is whether it might not interfere with its production.  
Two circumstances, however, abate if they do not remove apprehension, on this score; one is, the considerable increase of price, which has been already remarked, and which renders it probable, that the free admission of foreign iron would not be inconsistent with an adequate profit to the proprietors of Iron Works; the other is, the augmentation of demand, which would be likely to attend the increase of manufactures of the article, in consequence of the additional encouragements proposed to be given. But caution nevertheless in a matter of this kind is most adviseable. The measure suggested ought perhaps rather to be contemplated, subject to the lights of further experience, than immediately adopted.  
Copper  
The manufactures of which this article is susceptible are also of great extent and utility. Under this description, those of brass, of which it is the principal ingreedient, are intended to be included.  
The material is a natural production of the Country. Mines of Copper have actually been wrought, and with profit to the undertakers, though it is not known, that any are now in this condition. And nothing is easier, than the introduction of it, from other countries, on moderate terms, and in great plenty.  
Coppersmiths and brass founders, particularly the former, are numerous in the United States; some of whom carry on business to a respectable extent.  
To multiply and extend manufactories of the materials in question is worthy of attention and effort. In order to this, it is desireable to facilitate a plentiful supply of the materials. And a proper mean to this end is to place them in the class of free articles. Copper in plates and brass are already in this predicament, but copper in pigs and bars is not—neither is lapis calaminaris, which together with copper and charcoal, constitute the component ingredients of brass. The exemption from duty, by parity of reason, ought to embrace all such of these articles, as are objects of importation. An additional duty, on brass wares, will tend to the general end in view. These now stand at 5 ⅌. Cent, while those of tin, pewter and copper are rated at 7½. There appears to be a propriety in every view in placing brass wares upon the same level with them; and it merits consideration whether the duty upon all of them ought not to be raised to 10 ⅌. Cent.  
Lead  
There are numerous proofs, that this material abounds in the United States, and requires little to unfold it to an extent, more than equal to every domestic occasion. A prolific mine of it has long been open in the South Western parts of Virginia, and under a public administration, during the late war, yielded a considerable supply for military use. This is now in the hands of individuals, who not only carry it on with spirit; but have established manufactories of it, at Richmond, in the same State.  
The duties, already laid upon the importation of this article, either in its unmanufactured, or manufactured state, ensure it a decisive advantage in the home market—which amounts to considerable encouragement. If the duty on pewter wares should be raised it would afford a further encouragement.

othing else occurs as proper to be added.  
Fossil Coal  
This, as an important instrument of manufactures, may without impropriety be mentioned among the subjects of this Report.  
A copious supply of it would be of great consequence to the iron branch: As an article of household fuel also it is an interesting production; the utility of which must increase in proportion to the decrease of wood, by the progress of settlement and cultivation. And its importance to navigation, as an immense article of transportation coastwise, is signally exemplified in Great Britain.  
It is known, that there are several coal mines in Virginia, now worked; and appearances of their existence are familiar in a number of places.  
The expediency of a bounty on all the species of coal of home production, and of premiums, on the opening of new mines, under certain qualifications, appears to be worthy of particular examination. The great importance of the article will amply justify a reasonable expence in this way, if it shall appear to be necessary to and shall be thought it likely to answer the end.  
Wood  
Several manufactures of this article flourish in the United States. Ships are no where built in greater perfection, and cabinet wares, generally, are made little if at all inferior to those of Europe. Their extent is such as to have admitted of considerable exportation.  
An exemption from duty of the several kinds of wood ordinarily used in these manufactures seems to be all, that is requisite, by way of encouragement. It is recommended by the consideration of a similar policy being pursued in other countries, and by the expediency of giving equal advantages to our own workmen in wood. The abundance of Timber proper for ship building in the United States does not appear to be any objection to it. The increasing scarcity and the growing importance of that article, in the European countries, admonish the United States to commence, and systematically to pursue, measures for the preservation of their stock. Whatever may promote the regular establishment of Magazines of Ship Timber is in various views desireable.  
Skins  
There are scarcely any manufactories of greater importance, than of this article. Their direct and very happy influence upon Agriculture, by promoting the raising of Cattle of different kinds, is a very material recommendation.  
It is pleasing too, to observe the extensive progress they have made in their principal branches; which are so far matured as almost to defy foreign competition. Tanneries in particular are not only carried on as a regular business, in numerous instances and in various parts of the Country; but they constitute in some places a valuable item of incidental family manufactures.  
Representations however have been made, importing the expediency of further encouragement to the Leather-Branch in two ways—one by increasing the duty on the manufactures of it, which are imported—the other by prohibiting the exportation of bark. In support of the latter it is alleged that the price of bark, chiefly in consequence of large exportations, has risen within a few years from [about three Dollars to four dollars and a half per cord.]  
These suggestions are submitted rather as intimations, which merit consideration, than as matters, the propriety of which is manifest. It is not clear, that an increase of duty is necessary: and in regard to the prohibition desired, there is no evidence of any considerable exportation hitherto; and it is most probable, that whatever augmentation of price may have taken place, is to be attributed to an extension of the home demand from the increase of manufactures, and to a decrease of the supply in consequence of the progress of Settlement; rather than to the quantities which have been exported.  
It is mentioned however, as an additional reason for the prohibition, that one species of the bark usually exported is in some sort peculiar to the country, and the material of a very valuable dye, of great use in some other manufactures, in which the United States have begun a competition.  
  
There may also be this argument in favor of an increase of duty. The object is of importance enough to claim decisive encouragement and the progress, which has been made, leaves no room to apprehend any inconvenience on the score of supply from such an increase.  
It would be of benefit to this branch, if glue which is now rated at 5 perCent, were made the object of an excluding duty. It is already made in large quantities at various tanneries; and like paper, is an entire œconomy of materials, which if not manufactured would be left to perish. It may be placed with advantage in the class of articles paying 15 perCent.  
Grain  
Manufactures of the several species of this article have a title to peculiar favor; not only because they are most of them immediately connected with the subsistence of the citizens; but because they enlarge the demand for the most precious products of the soil.  
Though flour may with propriety be noticed as a manufacture of Grain, it were useless to do it, but for the purpose of submitting the expediency of a general system of inspection, throughout the ports of the United states; which, if established upon proper principles, would be likely to improve the quality of our flour every where, and to raise its

n markets. There are however considerations which stand in the way of such an arrangement.  
Ardent spirits and malt liquors are, next to flour, the two principal manufactures of Grain. The first has made a very extensive, the last a considerable progress in the United States. In respect to both, an exclusive possession of the home market ought to be secured to the domestic manufacturers; as fast as circumstances will admit. Nothing is more practicable &amp; nothing more desireable.  
The existing laws of the United States have done much towards attaining this valuable object; but some additions to the present duties, on foreign distilled spirits, and foreign malt liquors, and perhaps an abatement of those on home made spirits, would more effectually secure it; and there does not occur any very weighty objection to either.  
  
An augmentation of the duties on imported spirits would favour, as well the distillation of Spirits from molasses, as that from Grain. And to secure to the nation the benefit of the manufacture, even of foreign materials, is always of great, though perhaps of secondary importance.  
A strong impression prevails in the minds of those concerned in distilleries (including too the most candid and enlightened) that greater differences in the rates of duty on foreign and domestic spirits are necessary, completely to secure the successful manufacture of the latter; and there are facts which entitle this impression to attention.  
It is known, that the price of molasses for some years past, has been successively rising in the West India Markets, owing partly to a competition, which did not formerly exist, and partly to an extension of demand in this country; and it is evident, that the late disturbances in those Islands, from which we draw our principal supply, must so far interfere with the production of the article, as to occasion a material enhancement of price. The destruction and devastation attendant on the insurrection in Hispaniola, in particular, must not only contribute very much to that effect, but may be expected to give it some duration. These circumstances, and the duty of three cents per Gallon on molasses, may render it difficult for the distillers of that material to maintain with adequate profit a competition, with the rum brought from the West Indies, the quality of which is so considerably superior.  
The consumption of Geneva or Gin in this country is extensive. It is not long since distilleries of it have grown up among us, to any importance. They are now becoming of consequence, but being still in their infancy, they require protection.  
It is represented, that the price of some of the materials is greater here, than in Holland, from which place large quantities are brought, the price of labour considerably greater, the capitals engaged in the business there much larger, than those which are employed here, the rate of profits, at which the Undertakers can afford to carry it on, much less—the prejudices, in favor of imported Gin, strong. These circumstances are alleged to outweigh the charges, which attend the bringing of the Article, from Europe to the United states and the present difference of duty, so as to obstruct the prosecution of the manufacture, with due advantage.  
Experiment could perhaps alone decide with certainty the justness of the suggestions, which are made; but in relation to branches of manufacture so important, it would seem inexpedient to hazard an unfavourable issue, and better to err on the side of too great, than of too small a difference, in the particular in question.  
It is therefore submitted, that an addition of two cents per Gallon be made to the duty on imported spirits of the first class of proof, with a proportionable increase on those of higher proof; and that a deduction of one cent per Gallon be made from the duty on spirits distilled within the United states, beginning with the first class of proof, and a proportionable deduction from the duty on those of higher proof.  
It is ascertained, that by far the greatest part of the malt liquors consumed in the United States are the produce of domestic breweries. It is desireable, and, in all likelihood, attainable, that the whole consumption should be supplied by ourselves.  
The malt liquors, made at home, though inferior to the best are equal to a great part of those, which have been usually imported. The progress already made is an earnest of what may be accomplished. The growing competition is an assurance of improvement. This will be accelerated by measures, tending to invite a greater capital into this channel of employment.  
To render the encouragement to domestic breweries decisive, it may be adviseable to substitute to the present rates of duty eight cents per gallon generally; and it will deserve to be considered as a gaurd against evasions, whether there ought not to be a prohibition of their importation, except in casks of considerable capacity. It is to be hoped, that such a duty would banish from the market, foreign malt liquors of inferior quality; and that the best kind only would continue to be imported till it should be supplanted, by the efforts of equal skill or care at home.  
Till that period, the importation so qualified would be an useful stimulous to improvement: And in the mean time, the payment of the increased price, for the enjoyment of a luxury, in order to the encouragement of a most useful branch of domestic industry, could not reasonably be deemed a hardship.  
As a further aid to the manufactures of grain, though upon a smaller scale, the articles of Starch, hair powder and wafers, may with great propriety be placed among those, which are rated at 15 perCent. No manufactures are more simple, nor more completely within the reach of a full supply, from domestic sources, and it is a policy, as common as it is obvious, to make them the objects either of prohibitory duties, or of express prohibition.  
Flax and Hemp  
Manufactures of these articles have so much affinity to each other, and they are so often blended, that they may with advantage be considered in conjunction. The importance of the linnin branch to agriculture—its precious effects upon household industry—the ease, with which the materials can be produced at home to any requisite extent—the great advances, which have been already made, in the coarser fabricks of them, especially in the family way, constitute claims, of peculiar force, to the patronage of government.  
This patronage may be afforded in various ways; by promoting the growth of the materials; by increasing the impediments to an advantageous competition of rival foreign articles; by direct bounties or premiums upon the home manufacture.  
First.   As to promoting the growth of the materials.  
In respect to hemp, something has been already done by the high duty upon foreign hemp. If the facilities for domestic production were not unusually great, the policy of the duty, on the foreign raw material, would be highly questionable, as interfering with the growth of manufactures of it. But making the proper allowances for those facilities, and with an eye to the future and natural progress, of the country, the measure does not appear, upon the whole, exceptionable. A strong wish naturally suggests itself, that some method could be devised of affording a more direct encouragement to the growth both of flax and hemp; such as would be effectual, and at the same time not attended with too great inconveniences. To this end, bounties and premiums offer themselves to consideration; but no modification of them has yet occurred, which would not either hazard too much expence, or operate unequally in reference to the circumstances of different parts of the Union; and which would not be attended with very great difficulties in the execution.  
Secondly—  
As to encreasing the impediments to an advantageous competition of rival foreign articles.  
To this purpose, an augmentation of the duties on importation is the obvious expedient; which, in regard to certain articles, appears to be recommended by sufficient reasons.  
The principal of these articles is Sail cloth; one intimately connected with navigation and defence; and of which a flourishing manufactory is established at Boston and very promising ones at several other places.  
It is presumed to be both safe and adviseable to place this in the class of articles rated at 10 Per cent. A strong reason for it results from the consideration that a bounty of two pence sterling per ell is allowed, in Great Britain, upon the exportation of the sail cloth manufactured in that Kingdom.  
It would likewise appear to be good policy to raise the duty to 7½ perCent on the following articles. Drillings, Osnaburghs, Ticklenburghs, Dowlas, Canvas, Brown Rolls, Bagging, and upon all other linnens the first cost of which at the place of exportation does not exceed 35 cents per yard. A bounty of 12½ ⅌ Cent, upon an average on the exportation of such or similar linens from Great-Britain encourages the manufacture of them in that country and increases the obstacles to a successful competition in the countries to which they are sent.  
The quantities of tow and other household linnens manufactured in different parts of the United States and the expectations, which are derived from some late experiments, of being able to extend the use of labour-sav

e same time to promote the cheapness of the article for the benefit of navigation, it will be of great use to allow a bounty of two Cents ⅌ yard on all Sail Cloth, which is made in the United States from materials of their own growth. This would also assist the Culture of those materials. An encouragement of this kind if adopted ought to be established for a moderate term of years, to invite to new undertakings and to an extension of the old. This is an article of importance enough to warrant the employment of extraordinary means in its favor.  
Cotton  
There is something in the texture of this material, which adapts it in a peculiar degree to the application of Machines. The signal Utility of the mill for spinning of cotton, not long since invented in England, has been noticed in another place; but there are other machines scarcely inferior in utility which, in the different manufactories of this article are employed either exclusively, or with more than ordinary effect. This very important circumstance recommends the fabricks of cotton, in a more particular manner, to a country in which a defect of hands constitutes the greatest obstacle to success.  
The variety and extent of the uses to which the manufactures of this article are applicable is another powerful argument in their favor.  
And the faculty of the United States to produce the raw material in abundance, &amp; of a quality, which though alledged to be inferior to some that is produced in other quarters, is nevertheles capable of being used with advantage, in many fabrics, and is probably susceptible of being carried, by a more experienced culture, to much greater perfection—suggests an additional and a very cogent inducement to the vigorous pursuit of the cotton branch, in its several subdivisions.  
How much has been already done has been stated in a preceding part of this report.  
In addition to this, it may be announced, that a society is forming with a capital which is expected to be extended to at least half a million of dollars; on behalf of which measures are already in train for prosecuting on a large scale, the making and printing of cotton goods.  
These circumstances conspire to indicate the expediency of removing any obstructions, which may happen to exist, to the advantageous prosecution of the manufactories in question, and of adding such encouragements, as may appear necessary and proper.  
The present duty of three cents ⅌ lb. on the foreign raw material, is undoubtedly a very serious impediment to the progress of those manufactories.  
The injurious tendency of similar duties either prior to the establishment, or in the infancy of the domestic manufacture of the article, as it regards the manufacture, and their worse than inutility, in relation to the home production of the material itself, have been anticipated particularly in discussing the subject of pecuniary bounties.  
Cotton has not the same pretensions, with hemp, to form an exception to the general rule.  
Not being, like hemp an universal production of the Country it affords less assurance of an adequate internal supply; but the chief objection arises from the doubts; which are entertained concerning the quality of the national cotton. It is alledged, that the fibre of it is considerably shorter and weaker, than that of some other places; and it has been observed as a general rule, that the nearer the place of growth to the Equator, the better the quality of the cotton. That which comes from Cayenne, Surrinam and Demarara is said to be preferable, even at a material difference of price, to the Cotton of the Islands.  
While a hope may reasonably be indulged, that with due care and attention the national cotton may be made to approach nearer than it now does to that of regions, somewhat more favored by climate; and while facts authorize an opinion, that very great use may be made of it, and that it is a resource which gives greater security to the cotton fabrics of this country, than can be enjoyed by any which depends wholly on external supply it will certainly be wise, in every view, to let our infant manufactures have the full benefit of the best materials on the cheapest terms.  
It is obvious that the necessity of having such materials is proportioned to the unskilfulness and inexperience of the workmen employed, who if inexpert, will not fail to commit great waste, where the materials they are to work with are of an indifferent kind.  
To secure to the national manufactures so essential an advantage, a repeal of the present duty on imported cotton is indispensible.  
A substitute for this, far more encouraging to domestic production, will be to grant a bounty on the national cotton, when wrought at a home manufactory; to which a bounty on the exportation of it may be added. Either or both would do much more towards promoting the growth of the article, than the merely nominal encouragement, which it is proposed to abolish. The first would also have a direct influence in encouraging the manufacture.  
The bounty which has been mentioned as existing in Great Britain, upon the exportation of coarse linnens not exceeding a certain value, applies also to certain discriptions of cotton goods of similar value.  
This furnishes an additional argument for allowing to the national manufacturers the species of encouragement just suggested, and indeed for adding some other aid.  
One cent per yard, not less than of a given width, on all goods of cotton, or of cotton and linnen mixed, which are manufactured in the United States; with the addition of one cent ⅌ lb weight of the material; if made of national cotton; would amount to an aid of considerable importance, both to the production and to the manufacture of that valuable article. And it is conceived, that the expence would be well justified by the magnitude of the object.  
The printing and staining of cotton goods is known to be a distinct business from the fabrication of them. It is one easily accomplished and which, as it adds materially to the value of the article in its white state, and prepares it for a variety of new uses, is of importance to be promoted.  
As imported cottons, equally with those which are made at home, may be the objects of this manufacture, it will merit consideration, whether the whole, or a part of the duty, on the white goods, ought not to be allowed to be drawn back in favor of those, who print or stain them. This measure would certainly operate as a powerful encouragement to the business; and though it may in a degree counteract the original fabrication of the articles it would probably more than compensate for this disadvantage, in the rapid growth of a collateral branch, which is of a nature sooner to attain to maturity. When a sufficient progress shall have been made, the drawback may be abrogated; and by that time the domestic supply of the articles to be printed or stained will have been extended.  
If the duty of 7½ ⅌. Cent on certain kinds of cotton goods were extended to all goods of cotton, or of which it is the principal material, it would probably more than counterbalance the effect of the drawback proposed, in relation to the fabrication of the article. And no material objection occurs to such an extension. The duty then considering all the circumstances which attend goods of this description could not be deemed inconveniently high; and it may be inferred from various causes that the prices of them would still continue moderate.  
Manufactories of cotton goods, not long since established at Beverly, in Massachusetts, and at Providence in the state of Rhode Island and conducted with a perseverence corresponding with the patriotic motives which began them, seem to have overcome the first obstacles to success; producing corduroys, velverets, fustians, jeans, and other similar articles of a quality, which will bear a comparison with the like articles brought from Manchester. The one at Providence has the merit of being the first in introducing [into the United States] the celebrated cotton mill; which not only furnishes materials for that manufactory itself, but for the supply of private families for household manufacture.  
Other manufactories of the same material; as regular businesses, have also been begun at different places in the state of Connecticut, but all upon a smaller scale, than those above mentioned. Some essays are also making in the printing and staining of cotton goods. There are several small establishments of this kind already on foot  
Wool.  
In a country, the climate of which partakes of so considerable a proportion of winter, as that of a great part of the United States, the woolen branch cannot be regarded, as inferior to any, which relates to the cloathing of the inhabitants.  
Household manufactures of this material are carried on, in different parts of the United States, to a very interesting extent; but there is only one branch, which, as a regular business, can be said to have acquired maturity. This is the making of hats.  
Hats of wool, and of wool mixed with furr, are made in large quantities, in different States; &amp; nothing seems wanting, but an adequate supply of materials, to render the manufacture commensurate with the demand.  
A promising essay, towards the fabrication of cloths, cassimires and other woolen goods, is likewise going on at Hartford in Connecticut. Specimens of the different kinds which are made, in the possession of the Secretary, evince that these fabrics have attained a very considerable degree of perfection. Their quality certainly surpasses anything, that could have been looked for, in so short a time, and under so great disadvantages; and conspires with the scantiness of the means, which have been at the command of the directors, to form the eulogium of that public spirit, perseverance and judgment, which have been able to accomplish so much.  
To cherish and bring to maturity this precious embryo must engage the most ardent wishes—and proportionable regret, as far as the means of doing it may appear difficult or uncertain.  
Measures, which should tend to promote an abundant supply of wool, of good quality, would probably afford the most efficacious aid, that present circumstances permit.  
To encourage the raising and improving the breed of sheep, at home, would certainly be the most desireable expedient, for that purpose; but it may not be alone sufficient, especially as it is yet a problem, whether our wool be capable of such a degree of improvement, as to render it fit for the finer fabrics.  
Premiums would probably be found the best means of promoting the domestic, and bounties the foreign supply. The first may be within the compass of the institution hereafter to be submitted—The last would require a specific legislative provision. If any bounties are granted they ought of course to be adjusted with an eye to quality, as well as quantity.  
A fund for the purpose may be derived from the addition of 2½ per Cent, to the present rate of duty, on Carpets and Carpeting; an increase, to which the nature of the Articles suggests no objection, and which may at the same time furnish a motive the more to the fabrication of them at home; towards which some beginnings have been made.  
Silk.  
The production of this Article is attended with great facility in most parts of the United States, Some pleasing essays are making in Connecticut, as well towards that, as towards the Manufacture of what is produced. Stockings, Handkerchiefs Ribbons &amp; Buttons are made though as yet but in small quantities.  
  
A Manufactory of Lace upon a scale not very extensive has been long memorable at Ipswich in the State of Massachusetts.  
An exemption of the material from the duty, which it now pays on importation, and premiums upon the production, to be dispensed under the direction of the Institution before alluded to, seem to be the only species of encouragement adviseable at so early a stage of the thing.  
Glass  
The Materials for making Glass are found every where. In the United States there is no deficiency of them. The sands and Stones called Tarso, which include flinty and chrystalline substances generally, and the Salts of various plants, particularly of the Sea Weed Kali or Kelp constitute the essential ingredients. An extraordinary abundance of Fuel is a particular advantage enjoyed by this Country for such manufactures. They, however, require large Capitals and involve much manual labour.  
Different manufactories of Glass are now on foot in the United States. The present duty of 12½ per Cent on all imported articles of glass amount to a considerable encouragement to those Manufactories. If any thing in addition is judged eligible, the most proper would appear to be a direct bounty, on Window Glass and black Bottles.  
The first recommends itself as an object of general convenience; the last adds to that character, the circumstance of being an important item in breweries. A Complaint is made of great deficiency in this respect.  
  
Gun Powder  
No small progress has been of late made in the manufacture of this very important article: It may indeed be considered as already established; but its high importance renders its further extension very desireable.  
The encouragements, which it already enjoys, are a duty of 10 per Cent on the foreign rival article, and an exemption of Salt petre one of the principal ingredients of which it is composed, from duty. A like exemption of Sulphur, another chief ingredient, would appear to be equally proper. No quantity of this Article has yet been produced, from internal sources. The use made of it in finishing the bottoms of Ships, is an additional inducement to placing it in the class of free goods. Regulations for the careful inspection of the article would have a favourable tendency.  
Paper  
Manufactories of paper are among those which are Arrived at the greatest maturity in the United States, and are most adequate to national supply. That of paper hangings is a branch, in which respectable progress has been made.  
Nothing material seems wanting to the further success of this valuable branch which is already protected by a competent duty on similar imported Articles.  
In the enumeration of the several kinds, made subject to that duty, Sheathing and Cartridge paper have been omitted. These, being the most simple manufactures of the sort, and necessary to military supply, as well as Ship building, recommend themselves equally with those of other descriptions, to encouragement, and appear to be as fully within the compass of domestic exertions.  
  
Printed books  
The great number of presses disseminated throughout the Union, seem to afford an assurance, that there is no need of being indebted to foreign Countries for the printing of the Books, which are used in the United States. A duty of ten per Cent instead of five, which is now charged upon the Article, would have a tendency to aid the business internally.  
It occurs, as an objection to this, that it may have an unfavourable aspect towards literature, by raising the prices of Books in universal use in private families Schools and other Seminaries of learning. But the difference it is conceived would be without effect.  
As to Books which usually fill the Libraries of the wealthier classes and of professional Men, such an Augmentation of prices, as might be occasioned by an additional duty of five per Cent would be too little felt to be an impediment to the acquisition.  
And with regard to books which may be specially imported for the use of particular seminaries of learning, and of public libraries, a total exemption from duty would be adviseable, which would go far towards obviating the objection just mentioned. They are now subject to a duty of 5 ⅌ Cent.  
As to the books in most general family use, the constancy and universality of the demand would insure exertions to furnish them at home and the means are compleatly adequate. It may also be expected ultimately, in this as in other cases, that the extension of the domestic manufacture would conduce to the cheapness of the article.  
It ought not to pass unremarked, that to encourage the printing of books is to encourage the manufacture of paper.  
Refined Sugars and Chocolate.  
Are among the number of extensive and prosperous domestic manufactures.  
Drawbacks of the duties upon the materials, of which they are respectively made, in cases of exportation, would have a beneficial influence upon the manufacture, and would conform to a precedent, which has been already furnished, in the instance of molasses, on the exportation of distilled spirits.  
Cocoa the raw material now pays a duty of one cent ⅌ lb., while chocolate which is a prevailing and very simple manufacture, is comprised in the mass of articles rated at no more than five ⅌ Cent.  
There would appear to be a propriety in encouraging the manufacture, by a somewhat higher duty, on its foreign rival, than is paid on the raw material. Two cents ⅌ lb. on imported chocolate would, it is presumed, be without inconvenience.  
The foregoing heads comprise the most important of the several kinds of manufactures, which have occurred as requiring, and, at the same time, as most proper for public encouragement; and such measures for affording it, as have appeared best calculated to answer the end, have been suggested.  
The observations, which have accompanied this delineation of objects, supercede the necessity of many supplementary remarks. One or two however may not be altogether superfluous.  
Bounties are in various instances proposed as one species of encouragement.  
It is a familiar objection to them, that they are difficult to be managed and liable to frauds. But neither that difficulty nor this danger seems sufficiently great to countervail the advantages of which they are productive, when rightly applied. And it is presumed to have been shewn, that they are in some cases, particularly in the infancy of new enterprises indispensable.  
It will however be necessary to guard, with extraordinary circumspection, the manner of dispensing them. The requisite precautions have been thought of; but to enter into the detail would swell this report, already voluminous, to a size too inconvenient.  
If the principle shall not be deemed inadmissible the means of avoiding an abuse of it will not be likely to present insurmountable obstacles. There are useful guides from practice in other quarters.  
It shall therefore only be remarked here, in relation to this point, that any bounty, which may be applied to the manufacture of an article, cannot with safety extend beyond those manufactories, at which the making of the article is a regular trade.  
It would be impossible to annex adequate precautions to a benefit of that nature, if extended to every private family, in which the manufacture was incidentally carried on, and its being a merely incidental occupation which engages a portion of time that would otherwise be lost, it can be advantageously carried on, without so special an aid.  
The possibility of a diminution of the revenue may also present itself, as an objection to the arrangements, which have been submitted.  
But there is no truth, which may be more firmly relied upon, than that the interests of the revennue are promoted, by whatever promotes an increase of National industry and wealth.  
In proportion to the degree of these, is the capacity of every country to contribute to the public Treasury; and where the capacity to pay is increased, or even is not decreased, the only consequence of measures, which diminish any particular resource is a change of the object. If by encouraging the manufacture of an article at home, the revenue, which has been wont to accrue from its importation, should be lessened, an indemnification can easily be found, either out of the manufacture itself, or from some other object, which may be deemed more convenient.  
The measures however, which have been submitted, taken aggregately, will for a long time to come rather augment than decrease the public revenue.  
There is little room to hope, that the progress of manufactures, will so equally keep pace with the progress of population, as to prevent, even, a gradual augmentation of the product of the duties on imported articles.  
As, nevertheless, an abolition in some instances, and a reduction in others of duties, which have been pledged for the public debt, is proposed, it is essential, that it should be accompanied with a competent substitute. In order to this, it is requisite, that all the additional duties which shall be laid, be appropriated in the first instance, to replace all defalcations, which may proceed from any such abolition or diminution. It is evident, at first glance, that they will not only be adequate to this, but will yield a considerable surplus.  
This surplus will serve.  
  
First. To constitute a fund for paying the bounties which shall have been decreed.  
Secondly. To constitute a fund for the operations of a Board, to be established, for promoting Arts, Agriculture, Manufactures and Commerce. Of this institution, different intimations have been given, in the course of this report. An outline of a plan for it shall now be submitted.  
Let a certain annual sum, be set apart, and placed under the management of Commissioners, not less than three, to consist of certain Officers of the Government and their Successors in Office.  
Let these Commissioners be empowered to apply the fund confided to them—to defray the expences of the emigration of Artists, and Manufacturers in particular branches of extraordinary importance—to induce the prosecution and introduction of useful discoveries, inventions and improvements, by proportionate rewards, judiciously held out and applied—to encourage by premiums both honorable and lucrative the exertions of individuals, And of classes, in relation to the several objects, they are charged with promoting—and to afford such other aids to those objects, as may be generally designated by law.  
The Commissioners to render [to the Legislature] an annual account of their transactions and disbursments; and all such sums as shall not have been applied to the purposes of their trust, at the end of every three years, to revert to the Treasury. It may also be enjoined upon them, not to draw out the money, but for the purpose of some specific disbursment.  
It may moreover be of use, to authorize them to receive voluntary contributions; making it their duty to apply them to the particular objects for which they may have been made, if any shall have been designated by the donors.  
There is reason to believe, that the progress of particular manufactures has been much retarded by the want of skilful workmen. And it often happens that the capitals employed are not equal to the purposes of bringing from abroad workmen of a superior kind. Here, in cases worthy of it, the auxiliary agency of Government would in all probability be useful. There are also valuable workmen, in every branch, who are prevented from emigrating solely by the want of means. Occasional aids to such persons properly administered might be a source of valuable acquisitions to the country.  
The propriety of stimulating by rewards, the invention and introduction of useful improvements, is admitted without difficulty. But the success of attempts in this way must evidently depend much on the manner of conducting them. It is probable, that the placing of the dispensation of those rewards under some proper discretionary direction, where they may be accompanied by collateral expedients, will serve to give them the surest efficacy. It seems impracticable to apportion, by general rules, specific compensations for discoveries of unknown and disproportionate utility.  
The great use which may be made of a fund of this nature to procure and import foreign improvements is particularly obvious. Among these, the article of machines would form a most important item.  
The operation and utility of premiums have been adverted to; together with the advantages which have resulted from their dispensation, under the direction of certain public and private societies. Of this some experience has been had in the instance of the Pennsylvania society, [for the Promotion of Manufactures and useful Arts;] but the funds of that association have been too contracted to produce more than a very small portion of the good to which the principles of it would have led. It may confidently be affirmed that there is scarcely any thing, which has been devised, better calculated to excite a general spirit of improvement than the institutions of this nature. They are truly invaluable.  
In countries where there is great private wealth much may be effected by the voluntary contributions of patriotic individuals, but in a community situated like that of the United States, the public purse must supply the deficiency of private resource. In what can it be so useful as in prompting and improving the efforts of industry?  
All which is humbly submitted

Ttls eaflly difcerfiible, tlut tthat, in the nrfl  
instanCe is divided into two parts under the deno­  
minations of the ordinary prof t of the stock of the  
farmer And rent to the landlord, is in the feconc  
jnftance united under the general appellation ol  
thz ordinary proft on the flock of th- underta­  
ker ; and tnat this formal or verba! diftributiof  
cooititutes the whole difference in the two cafeSi  
It seems to have been overlooked, that the lam  
is itfelf a stock or capital, advanced or lent by it  
owner to the occupier or tenant* and that the ren  
he receives is only the ordinary profit of a cer&#x27;.aii  
flock in land, not managed by the proprieto  
himfelf, but by another to whom he lends or let  
it, and who, on his part, advances a fecGndca  
pital to stock and improve the land, upon whicl  
he also receives the usual profit. The rent o  
the landlord and the profit of the farmer are there  
fore nothing more than the ordinary profits of tiv  
capitals belonging to tivo different persons, am  
united in the cultivation of a farm : As in th&lt;  
other cafe* the surplus which arises upon any ma  
nufaCtory, after replacing the expences of carry  
ing iton, answers to the ordinary profits of one o  
■more capitals engaged in the prosecution of fuci  
manufactory. It is said one or more capitals ;be  
&lt;?aufe in faCt, the fame thing which is contem  
piated in the cafe of the farm, sometimes happen  
in that of a manufactory. There is one, whi  
furnifhes a part of the capital, or lends a part o  
the money, by which it is carried on, and ano  
ther, who carries it on, with the addition of hi  
own capital. Out of the fu/pJus which remains  
after defraying expences,. an interest is paid to th  
money lender for the portion of tbe capital fur  
niihed by him, which exactly agrees with the ren  
paid to the landlord j and the residue of that fur  
plus constitutes the profit of the undertaker o  
manufacturer, and agrees with what is denomi  
futed the ordinary profits on the stock of the far  
mer. Both together make the ordinary profit  
of two capitals employed in a manufactory j a  
in the other cafe the rent of the landlord and thi  
revenue of the farmer compose the ordinary pro  
fits of two capitals, employed in tbe cultivatioi  
of a farm.  
The rent therefore accruing to the proprieto  
of the land, far from being a criterion of exclufv  
produCtiveness, as has been argued, is no criterior  
even of superior produCtivenefs. The quefiioj  
must (til) be, vrtiether the surplus, after defrayinj  
expences, of a given capital, employed in the fur­  
chafe and improvement of a piece of land, isg/eat  
erorlefs, than that of a like capital employed ir  
the prosecution of a manufactory j or whether th&lt;  
ivbole value produced from a given capital and :  
given quantity tf labor, employed in one way, b&lt;  
greater or less than the ivbole value produced fron  
an equal capital and an equal quantity of labor em  
ployed in the other way j or rather, perhaps, whe  
ther the business of agriculture or that of manu­  
factures will yield the greatest produCt, according  
to a compound ratio quantity of the capita  
and the quantity of labor, which arc employed if  
the one or in the other.  
The&#x27; Solution, of either of theSc queftionsts no  
easy ; it involves numerous and complicated de  
depending on an accurate knowledge of th«  
objeCts to be compared. It is not known that thi  
compatifon has ever yet been made upon fufficien  
data properly ascertained and anajifed. To bi  
able to make it on the present occasion with satis  
faCtory precision would demand more previous en­  
quiry and investigation, than there has been hi­  
therto either leisure or opportunity to accomplish  
Some eflays» however, have beet) made toward!  
acquiring the requisite information ; which havi  
rather served to throw doubt upon, than to con  
firm the hypathefis, under examination. But ii  
ought to be acknowledged, that they have beet  
too little diverfjfied, and are too inaperfeCt to au­  
thorise a definitive conclusion either way; leading  
rather to probable conjeCture than to cerrtain de­  
duction. They render it probable, that there ar&lt;  
various branches of manufactures, in which a gi­  
ven capital will yield a gieater total produCt, and &lt;  
Considerably greater produCt, than an equal  
capital inverted in the pcurchafe and improvement  
of lands; and that there are also font* branches, ir  
which both the gross and tHe nett produce will ex­  
ceed that of agricultural industry ; according to &lt;  
compound raiio of capital and labor.. But it is or  
this last point, that there appears to be the greatefl  
room for doubt. It ii far less difficult to infei  
generally, that the w/rproduce of capital engagec  
in manufacturing enterprises is greater than thai  
of capital engaged in agriculture.  
The foregoing suggestions are net defigntd to in­  
culcate an opinion that manufacturing ivduftry i:  
wore productive than that of agriculture. Thej  
are intended rather to shew that the reverse of thi i  
proposition is not ascertained : that the genera  
arguments which a/e brought to establish it are no  
fatisfaCtory ; and consequently that a fuppofitior  
of the superior produCtiveness of tillage ought t&lt;  
be no obstacle. td listening to any fubftaotial in  
tlucements so the encouragement of manufactures  
which may be otherwise perceived to exist, througl  
an apprehension, that they may have a tendency  
to divert labor from a more to a &#x27;ess profitable em  
ployment.  
It is extremely probable, that on a full and. ac­  
curate developement of the mattfcf, on the grounc  
of faCtand calculation, it would be discovered tha  
there is no material difference .between the aggre  
gate produCtiveness of the one, and of the othei  
kind of Jnduftty $ and that the propriety of the en­  
couragements, which may in *iy cafe be propo­  
sed to be given to either, ought to be determinec  
upon considerations irrelative to any comparison  
of that nature.  
11. But without contending for the fuperloi  
produCtiveness of manufacturing industry, it may  
conduce to a better judgment of the policy, which  
ought to be pursued refpeCtmg its encouragement,  
to contemplate the fubjcCt, tinder some additional  
aspeCts, tending not only to Confirm the idea, that  
this kind of industry has been improperly repre­  
sented as unproductive in itfelf j but to evince in  
addition that the eftabiifhment and diffufion of  
manufactures have the effeCt of rendering the to­  
tal mast of ufeful and productive labor, in a com­  
munity, greater than it would otherwise be. In  
prosecuting this ; fcuffion, it may be necefiary  
briefly to resume :nd review some o.f the topics  
which have bees :eidy touebfd.  
  
To affirm that the labor of (he h44htifa£turer is  
mproJu&amp;ive, because be consumes as much of tht  
produce of land as he adds value to the raw mate  
•ials which he is not better found  
:d, than it would be to affirm, tha* the labor o  
he farmer, which furnifhes materials to the ma  
lufa&amp;urer, is unprodu&amp;ive, because he consumes ji  
■qudi value bf wanufa&amp;ured articles. Each fur  
jifhes a certain portion of the produce of his labo  
:o the other, and each destroys a correfponden  
portion of the prod Oca of the labor of the other  
In the mean time the maintainance of two citi  
&#x27;.ens, instead of one, is going on j the flare ha  
wo members instead of one j and they togethe  
:onfume twice the value of what is produced fron  
:he land.  
If instead of a farmer and artificer, there were  
armer only, he would be under the neceflity ofde  
&#x27;oting a part of his labor to the fabrication o  
loathing and other articles, which he would pro  
ure of the artificer, in the cafe of there being fuel  
i person ; and of course he would be able to de  
-ate less labor to the cultivation of his farm, an;  
vould draw from it a proportionably less producl  
The whole quantity of produ&amp;ion, in this state o  
hings, in provisions, raw materials and manufac  
uies, would certainly not exceed in value thi  
imount of what would be produced in provision:  
md raw materialsyonly, if there were an artifice:  
is well as a farmer.  
Again—lf there were both an artificer and ;  
armer, the latter would be left at liberty to purfut  
•xclufiveiy the cultivation of his farm. A greate:  
[uantity of provisions and raw materials would o  
ourfe be produced, equal, at lead, as has been al  
eady observed, to the whole amount of the provi­  
ions, raw materials and manufactures, whicl  
vould exist on a contrary supposition. The artiii  
er, at the fame time, would be going on in th&lt;  
&gt;rodu&amp;ion of manufactured commodities ; to ar  
imount fufticicnt not only to repay the farmer, ir  
hose commodities, for the provisions and mate  
ials which were procured from him, but to fur  
»ifli the artificer himfelf with a supply of fimiia  
ommodities for his own use. Thus then, ther*  
vould be two quantities or values in exigence in  
tead of one j and the r&#x27;evenue and confumptioi  
vould be double in one cafe, what it would be ii  
he other.  
If in place of both these supposition?, there wen  
upppfed to bfi two farmers and no artificer, eacl  
if whom applied a pa-ft of his labor to the cultur&lt;  
»f land, ami another part to the fabrication of ma  
iufa£ures ; in this cafe, thfc portion of the lal&gt;oi  
if both bestowed upon land would produce the fam&lt;  
juantity of provisions and raw materials only, a:  
vould be produced by the iatirefum of the laboi  
if one applied in the fame manner, and the por­  
ion of the labor of both bestowed upon manurac­  
ures, would produce the lame quantities ot ma­  
lufa&amp;ures only, as would be produced by the in­  
ire sum of the labor of one applied in the lame  
nanner. Hence the produce of the labor of :h(  
wo farmers would not be greater than the product  
&gt;f the labor of the farmer and artificer 5 ant  
lence it icfults, that the labor of the artificer is a  
&gt;ofitively produdtive as that of the farmer, and, a  
&gt;ofitive]y, augments the revenue, of the society.  
The labor of the artificer replaces to the farm  
:r that portion ofhis labor with which he provide  
he materials of exchange with the artificer, anc  
vhich he would otherwise have been compelled t!  
ipply to manufa&amp;ures $ and while the artifice  
hus enables the farmer to enlarge his stock 0  
igricultural industry, a portion of which he pur  
hafes for his own use, he also Juppiies himfelf ivitl.  
he manufactured articles of which be Jtandt v  
;eed. He does still more—-Besides this eqoivalen  
vhich he gives for the portion 0/ agricultural laboi  
onfumed by him, and this supply of manufa&amp;urei.  
omirrodities for his own consumption, he furnith­  
is itill a surplus, which compensates for the use  
f the capital advanced either by himfelf or forne  
ther person, for carr&gt;ing on the business. This  
9 the ordinary profit of the stock employed in tht  
nanufactorv, and is, in every fenfc, as tfft&amp;ivt  
n addition to the income of the society as the  
ent of land.  
The produce of the labor of the artificer confe­  
[uently, may be regarded as com po fed of ihret  
tarts 5 one by which the provisions for his fubfift­  
ne&#x27;e and the materials for his work are purchafec  
&gt;f the farmer, one by which he fiipplies himfel  
vith manufactured neceflaries, and a third whicl  
:onftitutes the profit on the stock employed* Tht  
wo last portions seem to have been overlooked ir  
he system, which represents manufacturing in  
luftry as barren and unprodu&amp;ive.  
In the course of the preceding illustrations, thi  
&gt;rodu£ts of equal quantities of the labor of the  
:armer and artificer have been treated as i  
:qual to each other. But this is not to be under-  
Vood as intending toaflert any such precise equal­  
ty. It is merely a manner of expreflion adopted  
&quot;or the fake of firaplidty and perspicuity. Whe­  
ther the value of the produce of the labor of the  
farmer be somewhat more or less-, than that of- tht  
artificer, is not material to the main scope of the  
argument which hitherto has only aimed at fnew  
ing that the one, as well as the other, occasions 2  
Dofitive augmentation of the total produce and re­  
venue of the society.  
It is now proper to proceed a step further, anc  
to enumerate the principal circumstances, frorr  
i/vhich it may be inferred—That manufacturing  
iftablifhments not only occasion a positive aug­  
mentation of the produce and revenue of the foci­  
sty, but that they contribute essentially to render­  
ing them greater than they could pofTibly be, with.  
jut such eftabliftiments. These circumstances are  
1. The division of labor.  
2. An extertfion of the use of machinery.  
3. Additional employment to clafles of tht  
community not ordinarily engaged in tht  
business.  
4. The promoting of emigration from forelgr  
countries.  
5. The furuifhing greater scope for the diver  
fity of talents and dispositions which dif  
criminate men from each other#  
6. The affording a more ample and variou:  
field for enterprise.  
7. The creating in some instances a new  
and feeuring in all, a more certain anc  
steady demand for the surplus produce 0:  
the foil.  
Each of these circumilafeccs has a confiJerable in-  
  
Huencc upon the total rhals of (r.dufiridus effort in  
» community : together, they add to it a degree of  
;nergy and effeCt, which are not easily conceived.  
Some comments upon each of them, in the ordei  
in which they have been stated, may fsrve to ex­  
plain their importance.  
I. As to the divijion of labor.  
It has justly been oWrvcd, that there is fcarce­  
any thing of greater moment in the economy of a  
nation, than the proper division of labor. The  
separation of occupations causes each to be car­  
ried to a much greater perfection than it could  
pofiibly acquire, if they were blended. Th:s

er t&lt;  
oreign nations of the advantages accruing froa  
he employment of machinery, in the modes, ii  
which it is capable of being employed, with mol  
itility and to the greatest extent.  
The. cotton mill invented in England, withii  
he last twenty&#x27; years, is a signal illustration o  
he general proportion, which has been just ad  
&#x27;anced.. In consequence of it, all the differen  
■ rcceiVes for Spinning cotton are performed b;  
ncans of machines, which are put in motioi  
&gt;y water, and attended chiefly by women ari&lt;  
;hildren j and by a smaller number of persons, ii  
he whole, than are requisite in the ordinary mod*  
&gt;f spinning. And it is an advantage of great mo  
r&gt;ent that the operarions of this mill contjnui  
vith convenience, during the night, as well a.  
hrough the day. The prodigious effeCt of fuel  
1 machine iseaiily conceived. To this inventior  
s to be attributed eiTentially the immense pro­  
;reis, w nch has been so suddenly made in Great-  
Britain in the various fabrics of cotton.  
HI. As to the additional employment of claffe.  
f the community, not originally engaged in the par­  
i:tiler business.  
This is not among the least valuable of th&lt;  
neans, by which manufacturing institutions con­  
r.bute to augment the general flock of induftr]  
rnd production. In places where those inftitu­  
ions prevail, besides the persons regularly enga­  
,fd in them, they afford occasional and extra em  
Moyment to industrious individuals and families  
f&#x27;no are willing to devote the leifore refuftin;  
rom the intermitfions of their ordinary pursuit!  
0 collateral labors, as a resource for multiply*  
ng their acquisitions or their enjoyments. The  
tiifbandmao himfelf experiences a new source ol  
rofit and support from the increased industry ol  
ii«&gt; wife and daughters ; invited and ftimulatec  
&gt;y the demands of the neighboring manufactories.  
Hefide this advantage of occasional employmem  
o clafTes having different occupations, there i:  
mother of a nature allied to it and of a fimilai  
endency. This i?, the employment of person:  
&quot;ho would otherwise be idle (and in many cases f  
burthen on the community) either from the biai  
temper, habit, infirmity of body, or io me  
)ther cauie, indilpofing or difqualifying them foi  
he tpijs of the country. It i&amp; worthy of particu­  
ar remark, that, in general, women and chii­  
3ren are rendered more ufeful, and the latter more  
;arly ufeful, by manufacturing eftablifhmentSj  
than they would otherwise be. Of the number  
3f persons employed in the cotton manufaaoriei  
3f Great-Britain, it is computed that 4-7 nearly  
ue women and ciiildcen 5 of whwen the great  
  
&gt;roportion are children, and ma.ty of them of as  
ender age.  
And thus it appears to be one of she attributes  
&gt;f manufa&amp;ures, and one of no small confer  
juence, to give occasion to the exertion of a  
greater quantity of industry, even by the fame  
tumber of persons, where they happen to prevail,  
ban would exist, if there were no such eftablifh­  
nents.  
IV. As to the promoting cf emigration from fa­  
eign countries.  
Men reluCtantly quit one course of occupation  
nd livelihood for another, unless invited to it by  
cry apparent and proximate advantages. Many,  
vho would go from one country to another, if  
hey had a prospect of continuing, with more be­  
nefit, the callings to which they have been edu­  
ated, will often not be tempted to change their  
ituat&#x27;ron by the hope of doing better in feme other  
vay. Manufacturers who, listening to the pow­  
rrful invitations of a better price tor their fabrics,  
&gt;r their labor, of greater cheapness of provisions  
ind raw materiafs, of an exemption from the  
hies part of the taxes, burthens and rettraints,  
vhich they endure in the old world, of greater  
&gt;erfonal independence and consequence, under  
he operation of a more e&lt;juai government, and nt  
vfcat is far more precioos than mere religious It­  
eration, a perfeCt equality of religious privileges ;  
vould probably flock from Europe to the United  
&gt;tates to pursue their own trades or profefiions*  
f they were once made fe&#x27;nfible of the advantages  
hey would enjov, and were inspired with an af-.  
&quot;urance of encouragement and employment, wi&#x27;l,  
with difficulty, be induced to transplant them­  
&quot;elves, with a view to becoming cultivators of  
and.  
If it be true then, that it Is the inter eft of the  
Jnited States to open every pofiible avenue to  
rmigration from abroad, it affords a weighty ar­  
gument for the encouragement cf manufactures ;  
vhich, for.the rcafon just aftigned, will lu-ve the  
hongeft tendency to multiply the inducements  
,o it.  
Here is perceived an important resource, not  
Dnly for extending the population, and with it  
the ufeful and productive labor of the country,  
but likewise for the pjofecution of manufactures,,  
without deducting from the numberof hands which  
might otherwise be drawn to tillage j

s which aTe the con­  
sumers, make immense differences in the pro­  
duce of their own foils, in different years j ana  
confcquentiy in the degrees of their neceiiity for  
foreign supply Plentiful harvests with them,  
cfpecially if similar ones occur at the fame time  
in the countries which are the furnifhers, occa­  
lion of course a glut in the markets of the latter.  
Considering bow fact and how much the pro­  
gress of new settlements in the United States must  
encreafe the surplus produce of the foil, and  
weighing seriously the tendency of the system,  
which prevails among most of the commercial  
nations of Europe 5 whatever dependence may  
be placed on the force of natural circumstances to  
counteract the effcCls of an artificial policy J  
there appear strong reafori* to regard the foreign  
dema .d for that iurplus as too uncertain a reli­  
ance, and to desire a fubititute tor it, in an tx­  
tenfive domestic m*. kct.  
To fccure such a market, there is no other  
expedient, than to promote manufacturing esta­  
blishments. Manufacturers who constitute the  
most numerous class, after the cultivators of land,  
are for that reason the principal consumers of the  
surplus of their labor.  
This idea of an extensive domestic market for  
the surplus produce of the foil is of the firli con­  
sequence. It is of all things, that which most  
effectually conduces to a fiouri/hing state ot agri­  
culture. If the effect of manufactories should be  
V»to detach a portion of the hands, which would  
otherwise be engaged in tillage, it might pollibiy  
cause a smaller quantity of lands to be under cul­  
tivation ; but by their tendency to procure a  
more certain demand for the surplus producc of  
the foil, they would, at the fame time, cause the  
Jands which were in cultivation, to be better im­  
proved and more productive. And while, by  
their influence, the condition of each individual  
farmer would be meliorated, the total mass of  
agricultural production would probably be encreaf­  
ed. For this must evidently depend as much, if  
i»t more, upon the degree of improvement,  
than upon the number of acres under culture.  
It merits particular observation, that the mul­  
tiplication of manufactories not only furnilhes a  
market for those articles which have been accuf­  
torocd to be produced in abundance, in a coun­  
try j but it iikewife crea ei a demand for such a*

were either unknown or produced in inconsidera­  
ble quantities* The bowels as well as the furfacc  
, of the earth are ransacked for articles which were  
before negleCted. Animals, plants and minerals  
acquire a otrliry and value, which were before  
unexplored.  
The foregoing confideratioos seem fuffiertnt to  
as general proportions, that it is the  
interest of nations to diversify the im:uftrious  
pursuits of the individual* whocompofe them—  
* That the establishment of manufactures is calcula |  
ted not only to encreafe the general frock of ufe­  
ful and productive labor ; but even to improve  
. the state of agriculture in particular ; certainly  
to advance the int&amp;refts of those who are engaged  
, in it. There are other views, that will be here­  
after taken of the subjeCt, which, it is conceived,  
. will serve to confirm these inferences.  
111. Previously to a further difcufTion of the  
, objections to the encouragement of manufactures  
which have been stated, it will be of use to fee  
what can be said in reference to the particular  
situation of the United Stares, agairjft the con­  
clusions appearing to result from what has been  
already offered.  
It may be observed, and the idea is of no in­  
confrderable weight, that however true it might  
be, that a state, which poflrfling large traCts of  
vacant and fertile territory, was at the fame timt  
seCluded from foreign commerce, would find its  
interelt and the interest of agriculture, in divert­  
ing a part of its population from tillage to manu­  
factures j yet it will not follow, that the fame is  
true of a state, which having such vacant and  
fertile territory, has at the fame time ample op­  
portunity of procuring from abroad, on good  
terms, all the fabrics of which it Hands in need,  
for the supply of its inhabitants. The power of  
doing this at least ftcures the great advantage of a  
divifron of labor, leaving rhc farmer free to pur­  
ine cxclufively the culture of his land, and ena­  
bling him to procure with its products the manu­  
factured supplies requisite either to his wants or  
to his enjoyments. And though it should be  
trne, that in fettled countries, the diverfification  
ofinduftrv is conducive to an encreafe in the pro­  
ductive powers of labor, and to an augmentation  
of revenue and capital ; yet it is scarcely con­  
ceivable that there can be any thing of so solid  
and permanent advantage to an uncultivated and  
unpeopled country) as to convert its Waftesioty  
cuTtfvated ancT inhabited diftriCts. If the reve­  
nue, in the mean time, should be lefj, the capi­  
tal, in the event, mull be greater.  
To these observations, the following appears  
co be a fatisfaCtory answer—  
i. If the system of perfect liberty to industry  
and commerce were the prevailing system of na­  
tions, the arguments which difluade a country  
111 the predicament of the United States, frnm  
the zealous pursuit of manufactures would douot­  
lels have great force. It will not be affirmed,  
that they might not be permitted, with few ex­  
ceptions, to lerve as a rtfle of national conduCt.  
In suCh a state of things, each country would  
have the full ber/efit of its peculiar advantages to  
com-penfate lor its deficiencies or difadvant ages.  
If one nation were in condition to supply ma nu  
faCtured articles on better terms than another,  
that Other might find an abundant indemnifica­  
tion in a fupeiior capacity to furnifh the producc  
of the foil. And a free mutually bene­  
ficial, of the commodities which each was able to  
lupply, on the heft terms, might be carried or.  
between them, fu&#x27;pporting in full vigor the indus­  
try of each. And though the circuniftances  
which have been mentioned, and others which  
will be unfolded hereafter, render it probable,  
that nations merely agricultural, would not enjoy  
the fame degree of opulence, in proportion to  
their numbers, as those which united manufac­  
tures with agriculture *, yet the progreftive im­  
provement of the lands of the former, might in  
the end, atone for an inferior degree of opulence  
in the meaTrtime j and in a cafe, in whiciioppo­  
iice considerations arc pretty equally balanced;  
the option ought perhaps always to be, in favor  
of leaving industry to its own direction.  
But the system, which has been mentioned, is  
far from characterizing the general policy of na­  
tions- The prevalent one has been regulated by  
an oppofcte fpi,it. The confeq-uence of it is, that  
the United States aTe to a certain extent, in the  
situation of a country precluded from foreign  
commerce. Thsy can indeed, without difficul­  
ty, obtain from abroad the ma»ufaChjred sup­  
plies, of which they are in want j but they ex­  
perience numerous and very injurious impedi­  
ments to the emiflion and vent of their own com­  
modities. Nor is this the cafe irt reference to a  
hngle foreign nation only. &#x27;1 he regulations of  
lsveral countries, with which we have the mo ft  
extensive intercourse, throw serious obftroCtions  
in the way of the principal staples of the Uniteo  
States.  
In such a position of things, the United States  
cannot exchange with Lurope on equal ierms 5  
and the want of reciprocity would render them  
the yiCtirn of a system, which should induce them  
to confine their views to agriculture, and refrain  
from manufactures. A constant and encreafing  
necefiitv, on their part, for the commodities of  
Europej and only a partial and occasional de­  
mand for their own, in return, could not but  
expose them to a state of impoverishment, com  
pared with the opulence to which their political  
and natural advantages authorise them to .ifpire.  
Remarks of Lhis kind are not made in the fpi­

gulations are alluded taf to judge for them­

it ;s no fmaH consolation, that already the  
rntalVrcs which have embarrafTed our trade,)  
hive accelerated internal improvexffents which  
upon ihe whole have bettered our affairs.  
To nverfifv and extend rhefe improvements, is  
the and fafeft method of indemnifying our-  
any inconveniencies, which those or  
flmiiar measures have a tendency to beget. If  
Europe will not take from us the produCts of our  
foil-, uson terms confident with our interest, the  
remedy is to ContraCt as fact as poißblc  
our frcnts of her.  
2. The conversion of their waste into cultiva­  
ted fa;&gt;ds is certainly a point of great moment in  
the p -litical calculations of the United States.  
But tl t degree in which this may poflilly be re­  
tarded by the encouragement of manufactories  
does not appear to countervail the powerful i&#x27;n­  
duce; icnts to affording that encouragement.  
At. übfervaiion made in another place is of a  
nature to have great influence ucon this »nftion—  
; if it ca.-inot be denied, thac the interests even Of&quot;j  
; agriculture may be advanced more by having such  
of the lands of a state as are occupied under ,;ood  
culciV3ti6n, than by having a greater quantity  
occupied under a much inferior cultivation, and  
if manufactories, for the reafor.s afligned, must&#x27;  
be admitted to have a tendency to promote aj  
more steady and vigorous cultivation of the lands  
occupied, than Would happen without them, it  
will £cMow, that they are capable of indemnify­  
ing a country for a diminution of the progress of  
new leuUments j and may feive 10 encreafe both  
the capital value and the incoma of its lands,  
even tno* ihey should abridge the nunrber of acres  
under &#x27;.ii£ge.  
But it does by no means follow, that the pro­  
gress o** jicv* settlements would be retarded by the  
extenfr nOf manufactures. The defirfc of being  
ast ind* penocfit proprietor of land is rounded on  
such ft.ong principled in the human breast, that  
where ,i?e opportunity of becoming so rs as great  
as it \j in :h* United the proportion will  
K- ,-il of . .-.v&#x27;&#x27; 1&#x27;... mu-i iori&#x27;   
lead to jt, iJPho Would be diverted1 from it towards  
manufactures. And it is highh probable, as al­  
ready intimated, that the acceffibn* of foreigners,  
who originally drawn over by manufacturing  
views, would afterwards abandon them for agri­  
cultural, would be more than an equivalent for  
those Of our own citizens, who might happen to  
be detached from them,  
The remaining objections to a particular en­  
couragement of manufactures in the United  
States n6w require to be examined.  
One of tbefe turns 011 the proposition, that in­  
dnftrv, if left to itfelf, will naturally find its  
way to the most ufefiil and profitable employ­  
ment : whence it is inferred, that manufactures,  
without the aid of government, will grow up as  
foan and as fact, as the natural stale of things  
and the interest ofjhe commoniry may reuuire.  
Against the solidity at this hypothecs, iri the  
fuli latitude of the terms, very cogent reasons  
may be offered. These have relaiion to the  
Itiong influence of habit and the spirit of imita­  
tion, -the fear of want of success in untried en­  
terprises, the intrinsic difficulties incident to firft 1  
efiavs towards » competition with those who  
have previously attained to perfection in the buii­  
nefs to be attempted, the bounties, premiums and  
other artificial encouragements, with which fo­  
reign nations second the exertions of their own  
citizens in the oranclies, in which they are to be  
rivalled.  
Experience teaches, that men are often so much  
governed by what they are accustomed to fee and  
praCtice, that the fimpleit and most obvious im­  
provements, in the niolt ordinary occupations,  
are adopted with hesitation, reluCtance and b)  
flow gradations. The fyontaneouy transition to  
new pur fa its, in a community long habituated to  
difteient ones, may be expected to be attended  
with proportionably greater difficulty. When  
former occupations ceased to yield a profit ade­  
quate to the subsistence of their followers, 01  
when there was an absolute deficiency of employ­  
ment in them, owing to the fupe.rabundance of  
hands, chanpes would ensue j but these changes  
would be likely to be more tardy than might con­  
sist with the interest either of individuals or of  
the society. In many cases they would not hap­  
pen, while a bare support could be ensured by an  
adherence to ancient courses j though a relbit.io  
a more profitable employment might be practica­  
ble. To produce the defvrable changes, as early ab  
maybe expedient, may there fore require the in­  
citement and patronage of government.  
The apprehension of failing in new attempts is  
perhaps a more serious impediment. There are ;  
dispositions apt to be attracted by the mere no­  
velty of an undertaking j but these are not al­  
ways those belt calculated to give it success. To  
this, it is of importance that the confidence of  
cautious, sagacious capitalists, both citizens and  
foreigners, ftiould be excited. And to in Ipi re  
this description of persons with confidence, it is  
essential, that they should be made to fee in an&gt;  
projeCt, which is new, and for that reason alone,  
if for no other, precarious, the prospeCt of such a  
degree of countenance and support from govern­

obftacie, than either of those, which have teen  
mentioned, to the ifltrodiuCtiorr of the fame branch

To maintain thi recent e (fe&#x27;Wifcments of  
one countiy and the iong matured eftabliihments  
of another country, a competition upon equal  
terms, both as to quality and price, ii in most  
cases impracticable. Tire difpavity, inthepne,

Sfcliibits &amp; iafgejrtop&amp;cion of ingenious and valua­  
ble workmen, in different arts and trades, who, by  
expatriating from Europe, have improved their  
r n condition, and added to the induftrjr and  
wealth of the United States* It is a natural in­  
ference from the experience, We ha*e already had,  
that as soon as the United States shall present the  
countenance of a serious prosecution of manufac­  
tures, as soon as foreign artists shall be made sen­  
sible that the state of things here affords a moral  
certainty of employment and encouragement, com­  
petent numbers of European workmen will trans­  
plant tliemfelves, effectually to ensure the success  
of the design. How indeed can it otherwile hap­  
pen conlidering the various and powerful induce­  
ments, which the situation of this country offers j  
addressing themselves to so many strong pafiions  
and feelings, to so many general and particular in­  
terests i  
Jt may be affirmed therefore, in respeCt to hand&#x27;s  
for carrying on manufactures, that we shall in  
a great measure trSde upon a foreign stock ; re­  
serving our own, for the cultivation of our lands,  
and the manning of our (hips ; as far as charatter  
and circumstances fhail incline. It is not unwor­  
thy of remark, that the objeCttoh to the success of  
manufactures, deduced from thefcartity us hands,  
as alike applicable to trade and navigation, and  
yet these are perceived to flourifli, without an\
sensible impediment from thatcaufe*  
As CO the deamefs of labor (another of the ob­  
ffacles alledged) this has relation principally to  
two circumstances j one that which ha? been just  
difcuflVd, or the scarcity of hands j the other, the  
greatness of profits.  
As far as it is a confequerice of the scarcity of  
Jhands, it is mitigated by all the confederations  
Which have been adduced as leflening that defici­  
ency. It is certain too, that the disparity in this  
refpeCt., between some of tiie molt manufacturing  
£arts of Europe and a large ot the Uni­  
ted States, is not nearly so great as is commonly  
imagined. It is also much less in regard to artifi­  
cers and manufacturers than in regard to country  
laborers; and while a careful comparfon sheWs,  
that there is, in this particular, much exaggera­  
tion ; it is also evident that the effeCt of the degree  
of difpariry which does truly exist, is diminished  
in proportion to the use which can be made of ma­  
chinery.  
To illustrate this last Idea—Let it be fuppbfed,  
that the difference of price, in two countries, of a  
given quantity of manual labor lequifite to the fa­  
brication of a given article is as ten ; and that  
some mechanic power »9 introduced into both  
countries, wnich performing half the neceflary la­  
bor, leaves only half to be done by hand, it is evi-  
that the difference in the cost us the fabrica­  
tion of the article in question, in the two coun  
triet, as far as it is conneCted with the price of  
labor, will be reduced from ten to five, in conse­  
quence of the introduction of that joweh.  
This circiiiftftance is Worthy of the most parti­  
cular attention. It diminishes immensely one of  
the most urged, against the  
success of manufactures in the United States.  
To procure all such machines as are fcnown in  
any part of Europe, can only require a proper pro­  
vision and due pains. The knowledge of f-veral  
of the most important of them is already pofieff d.  
The preparation of them here, is in most casts  
practicable on nearly equal terms. As far as they  
depend on water, lome superiority of advantages  
may be claimed, from the uncommon variety and  
greater cheapness of fituation9 adapted to miU  
feats, with which different parts of the United  
States abound.  
So far as the dearnefs of labor may be a confe­  
rence of the greatness of profits in any branch of  
business, it is no obftacie to its fuccefi. The  
undertaker can afford to pay the price.  
There are grounds to conclude that undertakers  
of manufactures in this country can at this time  
afford to pay higher wages to the workmen they  
may employ than are paid to IrmHar workmen in  
Europe. The prices of fabrics, in the  
markets of the United States, whick will for a long  
time regulate the prices of th£ domestic ones, may  
be considered as compounded of the following in­  
gredients. The firft cost of materials, including  
the taxes, if any, which are paidupon tnem where  
fhey are made ; the expence of grounds, buildings,  
machinery and tools; the wages of the persons  
employed in the manufactory 5 the profits on the  
capital or flock employed 5 the commifiions ol  
agents to purchaf; them whe&#x27;re they are made j  
the expence of transportation to the United States,  
Including insurance and other incidental charges}  
the taies tfr duties, if artj*, and fees of office which  
are paid on their exportation j the taxes or duties,  
and fees of office which are paid on their impor­  
tation.  
As to the firft of these items, the cost of mate­  
mis, the advantage, upon the whole&quot;, is at piefen1.  
ortthefideof the United States, and the differ­  
ence, in their favor, must encreale, in proportion  
as a certain and extensive domestic demand shall  
induce the proprietors of land to devote more o&gt;  
their attention to the production of those materi­  
als. It ought not to escape observation, in a  
comparison on this point, that fomfc of thfe principal  
manufacturing countries of Europe are much mor«  
depehdent on foreinn supply for the materials ol  
their manufactures, than wotild be the Unitec  
States, who are capable of fopplying themselves  
with a greater abundance, as well as a greater va­  
riety of the requisite materials.  
As to the second item, the expence of grounds,  
buildings, machinery and tools, an equality may  
at least be alfumed ; since advantages in some par­  
ticulars will counterbalance temporary difadvanti­  
ges in others.  
As to the third item, or the article of wages,  
the comparison certainly turns against the Unitec  
States j though as before observed, not in so giea  
a degree as is commonly supposed.  
The forth item is alike applicable to the foreigr  
and to the domestic manufacture. It is indeec  
more properly a result than a particular, to bi  
compared.  
But with respeCt to all the remainingitems, the}  
aie alone applicable to the foreign manufacture  
and in the ftriCtefl sense extraordinaries ; confti  
tuting a fern of extra charge on the foreign fabric  
which cannot be estimated at less than from n  
to jajfCr CCnt on the cost of «C *t the manufactory  
  
This sum of extra charge may confidently be­  
regarded as more than a counterpoile tor the rea)  
difference in the price 0/ labor j and is a fatisfac­  
tory proof that manufactures may prosper in defi­  
ance of it in the United States.  
To the geneial allegation, connected with the  
circumstances of scarcity of hands and dearnefs ol  
labor, that extensive manufactures can only grow  
3ut of a redundant or full population, it will b«  
fufficient, to answer generally, that the faCt has  
seen otherwise.—That the situation alledged tc  
&gt;e an efrential condition of success, has not beer  
hat of several nations, at periods when they had  
ilready attained to maturity iD a variety of manu­  
factures.  
The supposed Want of capital for the prosecution  
)f manufactures in the United States, is the mofl  
indefinite of the objections which are ulualiy op­  
j&gt;ofea to it.  
It is very difficult to pronounce any thing pre­  
:ife concerning the real extent of the monied capi­  
tal of a country, and ft&#x27;ill more concerning the pro­  
jortion which it bears to the objeCts that invite  
:he employment of capital. It if not Jess difficult  
:b pronounce how fai the effirff of any given quan­  
:ity of money, as capital, or in other words, as a  
medium for circulating the industry and property  
&gt;f a nation, may be encreafed by the very circum­  
tance of the additional motion, which is given to  
tby new objeCt6 r&gt;f employment. That effeCl.  
ike the momentum of descending bodies, may not  
mproperly be represented, as in a compound ratio  
:o maj&#x27;s and velocity, Ii seems pretty certain, that  
1 given sum of money, in a situation, in which the  
juick Itripuffet of commercial activity were little  
elt, would appear inadequate to the circulation of  
is great a quantity of industry and property, as in  
*ne, in which their full influence was experienced.  
Jt is not obvious, why the fame objection might  
lot 2s well be made to external commerce as to  
manufactures J since it is manifelt that our im­  
nenfe traCts of land, occupied and unoccupied, are  
:ap*ble of giving employment to more capital than  
s actually bestowed upon them. It is certain,  
hat the United States offer a vast field for the ad­  
vantageous employment ofcapital, but it does not  
&quot;oilow, that there will not be found, in one way or  
mother, a fufficient fund, for thefuccefsful prose  
:ution of any lpecies of indultry which is likely to  
&gt;rove truly beneficial.  
The following confederations are of a nature to  
emove all inquietude on the score of want of ca­  
pital.  
The introduction of banks, as has been fliewn  
&gt;n another octafiob, has a powerful tendency to  
&#x27;Xtend the aCtive capital of a country. Experi­  
:nce of the utiiity of these institutions is multiply­  
ng them in the Uni:ed States. It is probable that  
hey will be eftabliihed wherever they can exist  
vith advantage; a d wherever they can be fup­  
&gt;ol ted, if administered with prudence, they will  
idd new energies to all pecuniary operations.  
The aid ot foreign capital may fafely, and with  
:onfiderable latitude be taken Into calculation,  
ts instrumentality has been long experienced in  
&gt;ur external commerce j and it has begun to be  
elt in various other modes. Not only our funds  
&gt;ut our agriculture and other internal improve­  
fients have been animated by it. It has already,  
n a few iriftances, extended even to our manufact­  
ures;  
Jt is a well known faCt, that there are parts of  
idrope, which have more capital, than profitable  
lomeftic objects of employment. Hence, among  
•ther proofs, the large loans continually furnifhed  
0 fdreign ttates. And it is equally certain that  
be capital of other parts may find more profitable  
mployment in the Uni&#x27;ed States, than at home.  
\nd nocwithftanding theie are weighty iaduce­  
nents to prefer the employment of capital at home,  
ven atlefs. profit, to ast investment of it abroad,  
hough with greater gain, ye: these inducements  
,re over-ruled, either by a deficiency of employ­  
nent, or by a very material difference in profit.  
sotb these causes operate to produce a transfer of  
oreign capital to the United States. &#x27;Tis Certain,  
hat various objeCts in this country holdout ad-  
which are with difficulty to be equalled  
ifewhere ; and under the encreafingly favorable  
mprefiions, which are entertained of our govern  
rent, the attractions will become more and more  
trong. These impressions will prove a rich mine  
if prosperity to the country, if they are confirmed  
tnd strengthened by the progress of our affairs.  
\nd to l&#x27;ecure this advantage, little more is necef­  
ary, than to fofter industry, and cultivate oider  
nd tranquility, at home and abroad.  
It is not impossible, that there may be persons  
ifpofed to look with a jealous eye on the intru­  
uCtton of foreign capital, as if it were an inftiu­  
pent to deprive our own citizens of the profits of  
ur own iridultry : But perhaps there never could  
&gt;e a more unreasonable jealousy. Jnttead of be­  
ng viewed as a rival, it ought to be considered as  
molt valuable auxiliary ; conducing t&lt;&gt; put in  
notion a greater quantity of productive labor, anO  
greater portion of ufeful enterpiife, than could  
xift without it. It is at least evident, that in a  
ountry situated like the United States, with an  
•ifinite fund of resources, yet to be unfolded, eve  
y farthing of foreign capital, which is laid out in  
nternal ameliorations, arid in industrious eflablifh  
ments of a permanent nature, is a precious ac­

And whatever be the objeCh which originally  
ittract foreign capital, when once introduced, *11

But the following appears to be the true and  
iccurateview of this matter—  
lft. As to the point of the annual revenue re­  
juiGtc lot payment of interell and redemption e  
1 unci pal.  
As a determinate proportion will tend to pef  
picuity in the reasoning, let it be luppofed tha&#x27;  
he annual revenue to be applied, correlpondint  
A&#x27;ith the modification ol the 6 per cent. Hock o:

he hundred; that is, in the fiift instance, fixot  
iccount of interell, and two on account of prin­  
ripal.  
Thus far it is evident, that the capital deflrtfy­  
•.&lt;} to the capital created, would bear no greatei  
voportion than Bto 100. There would be with­  
irawn from the total rnafs of other capitals a fun

while he would be poilcffed ol a turn of one hun­

ippear to him eligible—Heie then the augment  
itton of capital, or the excefsofthat which is pro­  
luced, beyond that which is destroyed, is equa  
o ninety two dollars.  
To this conclusion it may be ob&#x27;efled, that the  
Um of eight dollars is to be withdrawn annually  
jntil the whole hundred is extinguilhed, and i  
nay be inferred, that in process of time a capi  
al will be destroyed equal to that which is at hrl

bour of man alone laid  
out upon a work, requiring great ſkill and art to bring it to  
perfection, may be more pruductive, in value, than the  
labour of nature and man combined, when directed to-  
wards more ſimple operations and objects: And when it is  
recollected to what an extent the agency of nature, in the  
application of the mechanical powers, is made aux{liar  
to the proſecution of manufactures, the ſuggeſtion which  
has been noticed, loſes even the appearance of plauſi-  
bility.  
  
Ie might alfo be obſerved, with a contrary view, that the  
labour employed in agriculture is in a great meaſure peri-  
odical and occaſional, depending on ſeaſons, liable to va-  
rious and long intermiſſions; while that occupied in many  
manufaQtures is conſtant and regular, extending through  
the year, — in ſome inſtances, night as well as  
day. It is alſo probable, that there are among the culti-  
vators of land, more examples of remiſſneſs, than amon  
artificers. The farmer, from the peculiar fertility of his  
land, or ſome other favourable circumſtance, may fre-  
quently obtain a livelihood, even with a conſiderable de-  
gree of careleſſneſs in the mode of cultivation; but th  
  
  
(FEI  
  
tiſan can with difficulty effect the ſame object, without ex-  
erting himſelf pretty equally with all thoſe, who are engaged  
in the ſame purſuit. And if it may likewiſe be aſſumed as a  
ſa, that manufactures open a wider field to exertions of  
ingenuity than agriculture, it would not be a ſtrained con-  
jecture, that the labour employed in the former, being at  
once more conſtant, more uniform, and more ingenious, than  
that which is employed in the latter, will be found at the  
ſame time more productive.  
  
But it is not meant to lay ſtreſs on obſervations of this na-  
ture ; they ought only to ſerve as a counterbalance to thoſe  
of a ſimilar complexion. Circumſtances ſo vague and ge-  
neral, as well as fo abſtract, can afford little inſtruction in  
a matter of this kind. |  
  
Another, and that which ſeems to be the principal argu-  
ment offered for the ſuperior productiveneſs of agricultural  
labour, turns upon the allegation, that labour employed on  
manufactures yields nothing equivalent to the rent of land ;  
or to that nett ſurplus, as it is called, which accrues to the  
proprietor of the ſoil.  
  
But this diſtinction, important as it has been deemed,  
appears rather ver than ſubſtantial.  
  
It is eafily diſcernible, that what in the firſt inſtance is  
divided into two parts under the denominations of the erd:-  
nary profit of the ſtock of the farmer and rent to the land-  
lord, 1s in the ſecond inſtance united under the general ap-  
  
ellation of the ordinary profit on the ſtock of the under-  
taker ; and that this formal or verbal diſtribution conſtitutes  
the whole difference in the two caſes. It ſeems to have been  
overlooked, that the land is itfelt a ſtock or capital, advanc-  
ed or lent by its owner to the occupicr or tenant, and that  
the rent he receives is oniy the ordinary profit of a cer-  
tain ſtock in land, not managed by the proprietor himlelr,  
but by another to whom he lends or lets it, and who, on his  
part, advances a fecond capital to ſtock and improve the  
land, upon which he alſo receives the uſual profit. The  
rent of the landlord and the profit of the farmer are there—  
fore nothing more than the ordinary profits of 7ws capitals  
belonging to zo different perſons, and united in the cultiva-  
tion of a farm: As in the other caſz, the ſurplus which ariſes  
upon any manufactory, after replacing the expences of  
carrying it on, anſwers to the ordinary profits of one or  
more capitals engaged in the proſecution of ſuch manufacto-  
ry. It is faid one or more capitals; becaule in fact, the

— 2.”  
  
( 12 )  
  
ſame thing which is contemplated in the caſe of the farm,  
ſometimes happens in that of a manufactory. There is one,  
who furniſhes a part of the capital, or lends a part of the  
money, by which it is carried on; and another, who car-  
ries it on, with the addition of his own capital. Out of the  
ſurplus which remains, after defraying expences, an intereſt  
is paid to the money lender for the portion of the capital fur-  
niſhed by him, which exactly agrees with the rent paid to  
the landlord; and the reſidue of that ſurplus conſtitutes the  
profit of the undertaker or manufacturer, and agrees with  
what is denominated the ordinary profits on the ſtock of the  
farmer. Both together make the ordinary profits

ts to tie employment of machines, which  
ſubſtituting the agency of fire and water, has prodigiouſſy  
teNened the neceſſity for manual labour; the employment of  
perſons ordinarily engaged in other occupations, during the  
feaſons, or hours of leiſure; which, belides giving occaſion  
to the exertion of a greater quantity of labour by the  
ſame number of perſons, and thereby increaſing the general  
ock of labour as has been elſewhere remarked, may alſo be  
taken into the calculation, as a reſource for obviating the  
ſcarcity of hands—laſtly, the attraction of foreign emi-  
grants, Whoever inſpects with a careful eye, the compo-  
fition of our towns, will be made ſenſible to what an extent  
this reſource may be relied upon. This exhibits a large  
proportion of ingenious and valuable workmen, in different  
arts and trades, who, by expatriating from Europe, have  
improved their own condition, aad addcd to the induſtry  
and wealth of the United States. It 1s a natural inference  
from the experience we have already had, that as foon as  
the United States ſhall preſent the, countenance of a ſerious  
proſecution of manufactures, as foon as foreign artiſts ſhall  
be made ſenſible that the ſtate of things here affords a mo-  
ral certainty of employment and encouragement, compe-  
tent numbers of European workmen will tranſplant them-  
ſelves, effectually to enſure the ſucceſs of the deſign. How  
indeed can it otherwiſe happen conſidering the various  
and powerful inducements, which the ſituation of this  
country offers; addreſſing themſelves to ſo many {tron  
paſſions and feelings, to ſo many general and particular  
intereſts.  
  
It may be aſſirmed, therefore, in reſpect to hands for  
carrying on manufactures, that we ſhall in a great meaſure  
trade upon 2 foreign ſtock ; reſerving our own, for the  
cultivation of our lands, and the manning of our ſhips; as  
far as character and circumſtances ſhall incline. It is not  
unworthy of remark, that the objection to the ſuccefs of  
manufactures, deduced from the ſcarcity of hands, is alike  
applicable to trade and navigation, and yet theſe are per-  
ceived to flouriſh, without any ſenſible impediment from  
that cauſe. | |  
  
As to the dearneſs of labour (another of the obſtacles  
alledged) this has relation principally to two circumſtances  
one, that which has been juſt diſcuſſed, or the ſcarcity of  
lands ; the other, the greatneſs of profits,  
  
  
n  
  
As far as it is a conſequence of the ſcarcity of hands, it  
is mitigated by all the conſiderations which have been ad-  
duced as leflening that deficiency. It is certain too, that  
the diſparity in this reſpect, between ſome of the molt ma-  
nufaQuring parts of Europe, and a large proportion of the  
United States, is not nearly ſo great as is commonly ima-  
gined. It is alſo much leſs in regard to artificers and manu—  
facturers than in regard to country labo!.rers 3 and while a  
carcful compariſon ſhews, that there is, in tis particular,  
much exaggeration z it is alſo evident that the effect of the  
degree of diſparity which does truly exiſt, is diminithed in  
proportion to the uſe which can be made of machinery.  
  
To illuſtrate this laſt idea—Let it be ſuppoſed, that the  
difference of price, in two countries, of a given quantity of  
manual labour requiſite to the fabrication of a given article,  
is as ten; and that ſome MHCHAN IC POWER is introduced  
into both countries, which performing half the neceſſary la-  
bour, Icaves only half to be done by hand, it is evident,  
that the difference in the coſt of the fabrication of the ar-  
ticle in queſtion, in the two countries, as far as jt is con-  
need with the price of labour, will be reduced from ten  
to five, in confequznce of the introduction of that  
FOWER, |  
  
This circumſtance- is worthy of the moſt particular atten-  
  
tion. It diminiſhes immenſely one of the o5jeions, moſt  
ſtrenuouſly urged, againſt the ſucceſs of manufactures in  
the United States.  
Io procure all ſuch machines as are known in any part  
of Europe, can only require a proper proviſion and due  
pains. Ihe knowledge of ſeveral of the molt important  
of them is already poſſeſſed. The preparation of them  
here, is in molt caſes practicable on nearly equal terms.  
As far as they depend on water, ſome ſuperiority of ad-  
vantages may be claimed, from the uncommon variety  
and greater cheapneſs of ſituations adapted to mill ſeats,  
with which different parts of the United States abound.  
  
So far as the dearneſs of labour may be a conſequence of  
the greatneſs of profits in any branch of buſineſs, it is no  
obſtacle to its ſuccels. The undertaker can afford to pay  
the price.  
  
There are grounds to conclude, that undertakers of manu—  
factures in this country can at this time afford to pay higher  
wages to the workmen they may employ, than are paid to  
ſimilar workmen in Europe. The prices of foreign fabrics,  
  
ia  
  
1  
  
in the markets of the United States, which will for a long  
time regulate the prices of the domeſtic ones, may be con-  
ſidered as compounded of the following ingredients. The  
firſt coſt of materials, including the taxes, if any, which  
are paid upon them where they are made; the expence of  
grounds, buildings, machinery and tools; the wages of the  
perſons employed in the manufactory; the profits on the ca-  
pital or ſtock employed; the commiſſions of agents to pur-  
chaſe them where they are made; the expence of tranſporta-  
tion to the United States, including inſurance and other inci-  
dental charges; the taxes or duties, if any, and fees of  
office which are paid on their exportation; the taxes or  
duties, and fees of office

of the United States, and, if they are a reſource at all,  
It is an extenſive one.  
  
To all the arguments which are brought to evince the  
impracticabiliiy of fucceſs in manufacturing eſtabliſhments  
in the United States, it might have been a ſufficient anſwer  
to have referred to the experience of what has been al-  
ready done Alt is certain that ſeveral important branches have  
grown up and flouriſhed with a rapidity which ſurpriſes  
affording an encouraging aſſurance of ſucceſs in future at-  
tempts; of theſe it may not be improper to enumerate the  
moſt conſiderable.  
  
I. Of ſkins. Tanned and tawed leather, dreſſed ſkins,  
ſhoes, boots and ſlippers, harneſs and ſadlery of all kinds,  
portmanteaus and trunks, leather breeches, gloves, muffs  
and tippets, parchment and glue.  
  
II. Of Iron. Barr and ſheet iron, ſteel, nail rods, and  
nails, implements of huſbandry, ſtoves, pots, and other  
houſhald utenſils, the ſteel and iron work of carriages, and  
for ſhip building, anchors, ſcale beams and weights, and  
  
F Various  
  
( 42 }  
  
various tools of artificers, arms of different kinds, though  
the manufacture of theſe laſt has of late diminiſhed for  
want of demand.  
  
IH. Of Wood. Ships, cabinet wares and turnery, wool  
and cotton cards, and other machinery for manufactures  
and huſbandry, mathematical inſtruments, coopers wares  
of every kind.  
  
IV. Of Flax and Hemp. Cables, ſail-cloth, cordage,  
twine and pack-thread.  
  
V. Bricks and coarſe tiles, and potters wares.  
  
VI. Ardent ſpirits, and malt liquors.  
  
VII. Writing and printing paper, ſheathing and wrap-  
ping paper, paſte-boards, fullers or preſs papers, paper  
hangings.  
  
VIII. Hats of fur and wool, and mixtures of both.  
Women&#x27;s ſtuff and filk ſhoes.  
  
IX. Refined ſugars.  
  
X. Oils of animals and feeds, ſoap, ſpermaceti and  
tallow cardles.  
  
XI. Copper and braſs wares, particularly utenſils for  
diſtillers, ſugar reſiners and brewers, and irons and other  
articles for houſehold uſe—philoſophical apparatus.  
  
XII. Tin wares for moſt purpoſes of ordinary uſe.  
  
XIII. Carriages of all kinds.  
  
XIV. Snuff, chewing and ſmoaking tobacco.  
  
XV. Starch and hair powder.  
  
XVI. Lampblack and other painters colours.  
  
XVII. Gunpowder.  
  
Beſides manufactories of theſe articles which are car-  
ried on as regular trades, and have attained to a conſiderable  
degree of maturity, there is a vaſt ſcene of houſehold ma-  
nufacturing, which contributes more largely to the ſupply  
of the community, than could be imagined; without  
having made it an object of particular inquiry. This ob-  
ſervation is the pleaſing reſult of the inveſtigation, to which  
the ſubject of this report has Jed, and is applicable as  
well to the ſouthern as to the middle and northern ſtates;  
great quantities of coarſe cloths, coatings, ſerges and  
flannels, linſey-woolſeys, hoſiery of wool, cotton and thread,  
coarſe fuſtians, jeans and muſlins, checked and ſtriped cot-  
ton and linen goods, bedticks, coverlets and counterpanes,  
tow linens, coarſe ſhirtings, ſheetings, toweling and table  
linen, and various mixtures of wool and cotton, and of  
cotton and flax, are made in the houſehold way, and in many  
inſtances  
  
1  
  
inſtances to an extent not only ſufficient for the ſupply ot  
the families in which they are made, but for ſale, and even  
in ſome caſes for exportation. It is computed in a number  
of diſtricts that two-thirds, three-fourths, and even four-  
fifths of all the clothing of the inhabitants are made by  
themſelves. The importance of ſo great a progreſs, as ap-  
pears to have been made in family manufactures, within a  
few years, both in a moral and political view, renders the  
fact highly intereſting.  
  
Neither does the above enumeration comprehend all  
the articles that are manufactured as regular trades. Man  
others occur, which are equally well eſtabliſhed, but which  
not being of equal importance have been omitted. And  
there are many attempts ſtill in their infancy, which though  
attended with very favourable appearances, could not have  
been properly comprized in an enumeration of manufacto—  
ries already eſtabliſhed. Ihere are other articles alſo of  
great importance, which, though ſtrictly ſpeaking, manu-  
faCtures, are omitted, as being immediately connected with  
huſbandry : ſuch are flour, pot and pearl aſh, pitch, tar,  
turpentine, and the like.  
  
There remains to be noticed an objection to the encou-  
ragement of manufactures, of a nature different from thoſe  
which queſtion the probability of ſucceſs— This is derived  
from its ſuppoſed tendency to give a monopoly of advan-  
tages to particular claſſes at the expence of the reſt of the  
community, who, it is affirmed, would be able to procure  
the requiſite ſupplies of manufactured articles on better  
terms from foreigners, than from our own citizens, and  
who, it is alledged, are reduced to a neceſſity of paying  
an enhanced price for whatever they want, by every mea-  
ſure, which obſtructs the free competition of foreign  
commodities.  
  
It is not an unreaſonable ſuppoſition, that meaſures, which  
ſerve to abridge the free competition of foreign articles,  
have a tendency to occaſion an enhancement of prices,  
and it is not to be denied that ſuch is the effect in a number  
of caſes z but the fact does not uniformly correſpond with  
the theory. A reduction of prices has, in ſeveral in-  
ſtances, immediately ſucceeded the eſtabliſhment of a do-  
meſtic manufacture. Whether it be that foreign manu-  
facturers endeavour to ſupplant, by underſelling our own,  
or whatever elſe be the cauſe, the effect has been ſuch as is  
{tated, and the reverſe of what might have been expected.  
  
F 2 But  
  
1  
  
But though it were true, that the immediate and certain  
effect of regulations controuling the competition of foreign  
with domeſtic fabrics was an increaſe of price, it is univer-  
ſally true, that the contrary is the ultimate effect with every  
ſucceſsful manufacture. When a domeſtic manufacture  
has attained to perfection, and has engaged in the profecu-  
tion of it a competent number of perſons, it invariably  
becomes cheaper. Being free from the heavy charges  
which attend the importation of foreign commodities, it  
can be afforded, and accordingly ſeldom or never fails to be  
ſold cheaper, in proceſs of time, than was the foreign  
article for which it is a ſubſtitute, The internal compe-  
tition, which takes place, ſoon does away every thing like  
monopoly, and by degrees reduces the price of the arti-  
cle to the minimum of a reaſonable profit on the capital em-  
ployed. I his accords with the reaſon of the thing, and  
with experience.  
  
Whence it follows, that it is the intereſt of a commu-  
nity, with a view to eventual and permanent ceconomy, to  
encourage the growth of manufaQures. In a national  
view, a temporary enhancement of price mult always be  
well compenſated by a permanent reduction of it.  
  
It is a refletion, which may with propriety be indulge  
here, that this eventual diminution of the prices of manu-  
factured articles, which is the reſult of internal manu-  
facturing eſtablithments, has a direct and very important  
tendency to benefit agriculture. It enables the farmer, to  
procure with a ſmaller quantity of his labour, the manu-  
factured produce, of which he ſtands in need, and con-  
ſequently increaſes the value of his income and property.  
  
&#x27;The objections which are commonly made to the ex-  
pediency of encouraging, and to the probability of ſucceed-  
ing in manufacturing purſuits, in the United States,  
having now been diſcuſſed, the conſiderations which have  
appeared in the courſe of the diſcuſſton, recommending  
that ſpecies of induſtry to the patronage of the govern-  
ment, will be materially ſtrengthened by a few general and  
ſome particular topics, which have been naturally reſerved  
for ſubſequent notice.  
  
I. There ſeems to be a moral certainty, that the trade  
of a country which is both manufacturing and agricul-  
tural, will be more lucrative and proſpetous, than that of  
a country, which is merely agricultural.  
  
  
(494-3  
  
One reaſon for this is found in that general effort of  
nations (which has been already mentioned) to procure  
from their own ſoils, the articles of prime neceſſity requi-  
ſite to their own conſumption and ule ; and which ſerves to  
render their demand for a foreign ſupply of ſuch articles in  
a great degree occaſional and contingent. Hence, while  
the neceſſities of nations excluſively devoted to agriculture,  
for the fabrics of manufacturing ſtates are conſtant and  
regular, the wants of the latter for the products of the for-  
mer, are liable to very conſiderable fluctuations and inter-  
ruptions. the great inequalities, reſulting from difference  
of ſeaſons, have been elſewhere remarked ; this uniformity  
of demand on one ſide, and unſteadineſs of it, on the  
other, mult neceſſarily have a tendency to cauſe the general  
courſe of the exchange of commodities between the par-  
ties, to turn to the diſadvantage of the merely agricultural  
ſtates. Peculiarity of ſituation, a climate and ſoil adapted  
to the production of peculiar commodities may, ſometimes,  
contradict the rule; but there is every reaſon to believe  
that it will be found in the main, a juſt one.  
  
Another circumſtance which gives a ſuperiority of com-  
mercial advantages to ſtates, that manufacture, as well as  
cultivate, conſiſts in the more numerous attractions, which  
a more diverſified market offers to foreign cuſtomers, and  
in the greater ſcope, which it affords to mercantile enter-  
priſe. It is a poſition of indiſputable truth in commerce,  
depending too on very obvious reaſons, that the greateſt  
reſort will ever be to thoſe marts, where commodities,  
while equally abundant, are moſt various. Each difference  
of kind holds out an additional inducement : and it is a po-  
ſition not leſs clear, that the field of enterpriſe muſt be en-  
larged to the merchants of a country, in proportion to the va-  
riety, as well as the abundance of commodities which they  
find at home for exportation to foreign markets.  
  
A third circumſtance, perhaps not inferior to either of  
the other two, conferring the ſuperiority which has been  
{tated, has relation to the ſtagnations of demand ſor certain  
commodities which at ſome time or other interfere more or  
leſs with the ſale of all.-— The nation which can bring to  
market but few articles, is likely to be more quickly and  
ſenſibly affected by ſuch ſtagnations, than one, which is  
always poſſeſſed of a great variety of commodities ; the for-  
mer frequently finds too great a portion of its ſtock of ma-  
terials, for ſale or exchange, lying on hand—or is obliged  
  
to  
  
or  
  
to make injurious ſacrifices to ſupply its wants of foreign  
articles, which are numerous and urgent, in proportion to the  
ſmallneſs of the number of its own. The latter commonly  
finds itſelf indemnified, by the high prices of ſome articles,  
for the low prices of others—and the prompt and advan-  
tageous ſale of thoſe articles which are in demand, enables  
its merchants the better to wait for a favourable change, in  
reſpect to thoſe which are not. There is ground to believe,  
that a difference of fituation, in this particular, has im-  
menſely different effects upon the wealth and proſperity of  
nations.  
  
From theſe circumſtances collectively, two important in-  
ferences are to be drawn; one, that there is always a higher  
probability of a favourable balance of trade, in regard to  
countries, in which manufactures founded on the baſis of  
a thriving agriculture flouriſh, than in regard to thoſe,  
which are confined wholly or almoft wholly to agriculture ;  
the other (which is alſo a conſequence cf the ſirſt) that  
countries of the former deſcription are likely to poſſeſs  
more pecuniary wealth, or money, than thoſe of the latter.  
  
Facts appear to correſpond with this concluſion. The  
importations of manufactured ſupplies ſeem invariably to  
drain the merely agricultural people of their wealth. Let  
the ſituation of the manufacturing countries of Europe be  
compared in this particular, with that of countries which  
only cultivate, and the diſparity will be ſtriking. Other  
cauſes, it is true, help to account for this diſparity between  
ſome of them; and among theſe caules, the relative ſtate  
of agriculture ; but between others of them, the moſt  
prominent circumſtance of diſſimilitude ariſes from the  
comparative ſtate of manufactures. In corroboration of  
the ſame idea, it ought not to eſcape remark, that the  
Weſt-India iſlands, the ſoils of which are the mot fertile,  
and the nation, which in the preateſt degree ſupplies the  
reſt of the world, with the precious metals, exchange to a  
loſs with almoſt every other country.  
  
As far as experience at home may guide, it will lead to  
the ſame concluſion. Previous to the revolution, the quan-  
tity of coin, poſſeſſed by the colonies, which now compoſe

borne. Of theſe exceptions, three caſes occur, which may  
ſerve as examples One, where the material is itſelf an ob-  
ject of general or extenſive conſumption, and a fit and pro-  
ductive ſource of revenue—Anather, where a manufacture  
of a ſimpler kind, the competition of which with a like do-  
meſtic article is deſired to be reſtrained, partakes of the na-  
ture of a raw material, from being capable, by a further pro-  
ceſs to be converted into a manufacture of a different kind,  
  
  
of the country, and in ſufficient abundance to furniſh a cheap  
and plentiful ſupply to the national manufaCturers,  
  
Under the firſt deſcription comes the article of molaſſes.  
It is not only a fair object of revenue, but being a ſweet,  
it is juſt that the conſumers of it ſhould pay a duty as well  
as the conſumers of ſugar.

VIII. The encouragement of new inventions and diſcoverics,  
at home, and of the intreduction into the United States of ſuch as  
may have been made in other countries; particularly thife. which  
relate do machinery. |  
  
This is among the moſt uſeful and unexceptionable of the  
aids which can be given to manufactures. The uſual means  
of that encouragement are pecuniary rewards, and, for  
a time, excluſive privileges. &#x27;The firit muſt be employed,  
according to the occaſion, and the utility of the jnvention,

deſireable in regard to improvements and ſecrets of extraor-

ducers, as well as authors and inventors; a policy which  
has been practiſed with advantage in other countries. Here,  
however, as in ſome other caſes, there is cauſe to regret,

another place, and need not be repeated ; but there is little

particular trades, of which it is the baſis, are capable of be-  
ing carried on without the aid of large capitals.  
  
Iron works have very greatly increaſed in the United  
States, and are proſecuted with much more advantage than  
formerly. The average price before. the revolution was  
about fixty-four dollars per ton, at preſent it is about  
eighty 3 a riſe which is chiefly to be attributed to the

and which renders it probable that the free admiſſion of  
foreign iron would not be inconſiſtent with an adequate profit  
to the proprietors of iron works; the other is, the augmen-  
tation of demand, which would be likely to attend the in-  
creaſe of manufactures of the article, in conſequence of  
the additional encouragements propoſed to be given. But  
caution neverthelets in a matter of this kind is moſt adviſe- |  
able. The meaſure ſuggeited ought perhaps rather to be \
  
contemplated, ſubject to the lights of further experience,  
than immediately adopted.  
  
N  
  
The manufactures of which this article is ſuſceptible are  
alſo of great extent and utility. Under this deſcription,  
thoſe of braſs, of which it is the principal ingredient, arc  
intended to be included.  
  
The material is a natural production of the country.  
Mines of copper have actually been wrought, and with  
profit to the undertakers, though it is not known, that any  
are now in this condition. And nothing is eaſier, than  
the introduction of it, from other countries, on moderate  
terms, and in great plenty.  
  
Copperſmiths and braſs founders, particularly the former,  
are numerous in the United States; ſome of whom carry  
on buſineſs to a reſpectable extent.  
  
To multiply and extend manufactories of the materials in  
queſtion is worthy of attention and effort. In order to this,  
it is deſirable to facilitate a plentiful ſupply of the materials.  
And a proper mean to this end is to place them in the claſs  
of free articles. Copper in plates and braſs are already in  
this predicament ; but copper in pigs and bars is not; nei-  
ther is /apis calaminaris, which together with copper and  
charcoal, conſtitute the component ingredients of braſs.  
  
Ihe exemption from duty, by parity ef reaſon, ought  
  
to embrace all ſuch of theſe articles, as are objects of im-  
portation.  
  
An additional duty, on braſs wares, will tend to the ge-  
neral end in view. Theſe now ſtand at five per cent. while

t impropriety be mentioned among the ſubjects  
of this report.  
  
A copions fuppiy of it would be of great conſequence to  
the iron branch: As aa article of houſehold fuel alſo it is  
an mtereſting production; the utility of which muſt in-  
creaſe in proportion to the decreaſe of wood, by the pro-  
greſs of ſettlement and cultivation. And its importance to  
navigation, as an immenſe article of tranſportation coaſt-  
wiſe, is ſignally exemplified in Great-Britain.  
  
It is known, that there are ſeveral coal mines in Virginia,  
now worked, and appearances of their exiſtence are in a  
number of places.  
  
The expediency of a bounty on all this ſpecies of coal of  
home production, and of premiums, on the opening of  
new mines, under certain qualifications, appears to be  
worthy of particular examination. The great importance  
of the article will amply juſtify a reaſonable expence in  
  
this way, if it ſhall appear to be neceſſary to, and ſhall be  
thonght likely to anſwer, the end.  
  
W O O D.  
  
Several manufactures of this article flouriſh in the  
United States. Ships are no where built in greater per-  
tectigp, and cabinet wares, generally, are made little if  
  
at  
  
2  
  
at all inferior to thoſe of Europe. Their extent is ſuch as  
to have admitted of conſiderable exportation. |  
An exemption {rom duty of the ſeveral kinds of woo  
ordinarily uſed in theſe manufactures feem to be al!, that is  
requiſite, by way of encouragement. It is recommended  
by the conſideration of a ſimilar policy being purſued in  
other countries, and by the expediency of giving equal  
advantages to our own workmen in wood. The abundance  
of timber proper for thip building in the United States does  
not appear to be any objeRion to it. The increaſing ſcar-  
city and the growing importance of that article, in the Eu-  
ropcan countries, admonii the United States to commence,  
and ſyſtematically to purſue, meaſures for the prefervation  
of their ſtock. Whatever may promote the regular eſta-  
bliſhment of magazines of ſhip timber, is in various views  
  
deſireable.  
3-0: £08:  
  
There are ſcarcely any manufaQtories of greater impor—  
tance, than of this article. Their direct and very happy  
influence upon agriculture, by promoting the raiſing of  
cattle of different kinds, is a very material recommenda-  
tion.  
  
It is pleaſing too, to obſerve the extenſive progreſs they  
have made in their principal branches; which are fo far ma-  
tured as almoſt to defy foreign competition. Tanneries in  
particular are not only carried on as a regular buſinais, in  
numerous inſtances and in various parts of the country;  
but they conſtitute in ſome places a valuable item of inci—  
dental family manufactures.  
  
Repreſentations however have been made, importing the  
expediency of further encouragement to the leather branch  
in two ways; one by increaling the duty on the manufac-  
tures of it, which are imported; the other by protibiting  
the exportation of bark. In ſupport of the latter ic is al-  
ledged, that the price of bark, chieſly in conſequence of  
large exportations, has riſen within a few years from about  
three dollars to four dollars and a half per cord.  
  
Theſe ſuggeſtions are ſubmitted rather as intimatians,  
which merit conſiderations, than as matters, the propriety  
of which is manifeſt. It is not clear that an increaſe of  
duty is neceſſary ; and in regard to the prohibition defired,  
there is no evidence of any conſiderable exportation hi-  
therto; and it is moſt probable, that whatever augmenta—  
  
tion  
  
18  
  
tion of price may hate taken place, is to be attributed to  
an extenſion of the home demand from the increaſe of  
manufactures, and to a decreaſe of the ſupply in conſe—  
quence of the progreſs of ſettlement, rather than to the  
quantities which have been exported.  
  
It is mentioned, however, as an additional reaſon for  
the prohibition, that one ſpecies of the bark uſually ex-  
ported is in ſome ſort peculiar to the country, and the ma-  
terial of a very valuable dye, of great uſe in ſome other ma-  
nufactures, in which the United States have begun a com-

n markets, There are however conſi-  
derations which fland in the way of ſuch an arrangement.  
Ardent ſpirits and malt liquors are, next to flour, the  
two principal manufactures of grain. The firſt has made  
a very extenſive, the laſt a conſiderable progreſs in the  
United States. In reſpect to both, an excluſive poſſcſhon  
ef the home market ought to be ſecured to the domeſtic  
manufacturers, as faſt as circumſtances will admit. Nothing  
is more practicable and nothing more deſirable.  
  
  
  
„  
  
The exiſting laws of the United States have done much  
towards attaining this valuable object; but ſome additions to  
the preſent duties, on foreign diſtilled ſpirits, and foreign  
malt liquors, and perhaps an abatement of thoſe on home-  
made ſpirits, would more effectually ſecure it; and there  
does not occur any very weighty objcAion to either.  
  
An augmentation of the duties on imported ſpirits would  
favour, as well the diltillation of ſpirits from molaſſes, as  
that from grain. And to ſecure to the nation the benefit of  
a manufacture, even of foreign materials, is always of  
great, though perhaps of ſecondary importance,  
  
A ſtrong imprethon prevails in the minds of thoſe con-  
cerned in diſtilleries (ingluding too the moſt candid and en-  
lighted) that greater diſterences in the rates of duty on fo-  
reign and domeſtic ſpirits are neceſſary, completely to ſecure  
the ſucceſstul manufacture of the latter; and there are facts  
which entitle this impreſſion to attention.  
  
It is known, that the price of molaſſes for ſome years  
palt, has heen ſucceſſively riſing in the Weſt-India markets,  
owing partly to a competition which did not formerly exiſt,  
and partly to an extenſion of demand in this country; and  
it is evident, that the late diſturbances in thoſe Iſlands,  
from which we draw our principal ſupply, muſt fo far in-  
terfere with the production of the article, as to occaſion a  
material enhancement of price. The deſtruction and de-  
vaitation attendant on the inſurrection in Hiſpaniola, in  
particular, muſt not only contribute very much to that  
eſfect, but may be expected to give it ſome duration.  
Theſe circumſtances, and the duty of three cents per gallon  
on molaſſes, may render it 61ihcult for the diſtillers of that  
material to maintain, with adequate profit, a competition,  
with the rum brought from the Welt Indies, the quality of  
which is ſo conſiderably ſuperior.  
  
The conſumption of Geneva or gin in this country is ex-  
  
  
among us, to any importance. They are now becoming of  
conſequence, but being ſtill in their infancy, they require  
protection.  
  
It is repreſented, that the price of ſome of the mate-  
rials is greater here, than in Holland, from which place  
large quantities are brought—the price of labour conſider-  
ably greater - the capitals engaged in the buſineſs there much  
larger, than thoſe which are employed here—the rate of  
profits, at which the undertakers can afford to carry it on,  
  
K much

much leſs—the prejudices, in favour of imported gin,  
ſtrong. Theſe circumſtances are alledged to outweigh the  
charges, which attend the bringing of the article from Eu-  
rope to the United States, and the preſent difference of duty,  
ſo as to obſtruct the proſecution of the manufacture, with  
due advantage.  
  
Experiment could perhaps alone decide with certainty the  
juſtneſs of the ſuggeſtions, which are made; but in rela-  
tion to branches of manufacture ſo important, it would  
ſeem inexpedient to hazard an unfavourable iſſue, and bet-  
ter to err on the fide of too great, than of too ſmall a  
difference, in the particular in queſtion.  
  
It is therefore ſubmitted, that an addition of two  
cents per gallon be made to the duty on imported ſpirits of  
the firſt claſs of proof, with a proportionable increaſe on  
thoſe of higher proof; and that a deduction of one cent  
per gallon be made from the duty on ſpirits diſtilled within  
the United States, beginning with the firſt claſs of proof,  
and a proportionable deduction from the duty on thoſe of  
higher proof.  
  
It is aſcertained, that by far the greateſt part of the malt  
liquors conſumed in the United States are the produce of  
domeſtic breweries, It is defirable, and, in all likehood,  
attainable, that the whole conſumption ſhould be ſupplied  
by ourſelves. |  
  
The malt liquors, made at home, though inferior to the  
beſt, are equal to a great part of thoſe, which have been  
uſually imported. The progreſs already made is an earneſt  
of what may be accompliſhed. The growing competition is  
an aſſurance of improvement. This will be accelerated by  
meaſures, tending to invite a greater capital into this chan-  
nel of employment.  
  
To render the encouragement of domeſtic brewerics de-  
ciſive, it may be adviſeable to ſubſtitute to the preſent  
rates of duty eight cents per gallon generally; and it  
will deſerve to be conſidered as a guard againſt invaſions,  
whether there ought not to be a prohibition of their im-  
portation, except in caſks of conſiderable capacity. It is to  
be hoped, that ſuch a duty would banith from the market,  
foreign malt liquors of inferior quality; and that the beſt  
kind only would continue to be imported till it ſhould be  
ſupplanted, by the efforts of equal ſkill or care at home.  
  
— Till that period, the importation ſo qualified would be an  
uſeful ſtimulous to improvement: And in the mean time,  
  
the  
  
„  
  
the payment of the increaſed price, for the enjoyment of a  
luxury, in order to the encouragement of a moſt uſeful  
branch of domeſtic induſtry, could not reaſonably be  
deemed a hardſhip.  
  
As a further aid to manufaCtures of grain, though upon  
a ſmaller ſcale, the articles of ſtarch, hair powder, and  
wafers, may with great propriety be placed among thoſe,  
which are rated at fifteen per cent. No manufactures  
are more ſimple, nor more completely within the reach  
of a full ſupply, from domeſtic ſources; and it 1s a po-  
licy, as common as it is obvious, to make them the objects  
either of prohibitory duties, or of expreſs prohibition.  
  
FL MAS IND HEM  
  
  
each other, and they are ſo often blended, that they may  
with advantage be conſidered in conjunction, The im-  
portance of the linen branch to agriculture—its precious  
eſfects upon houſehold induſtry—the eaſe, with which the  
materials can be produced at home to any requiſite extent—  
the great advances, which have been already made, in the  
coarſer fabrics of them, eſpecially in the family way, con-  
ſtitute claims, of peculiar force, to the patronage of go-  
vernment.  
  
This patronage may be afforded in various ways; by  
promoting the growth of the materials; by increaſing the  
impediments to an advantageous competition of rival foreign  
articles; by direct bounties or premiums upon the home  
manufacture.  
  
Firſt. As to promoting the growth of the materials.  
  
In reſpeA to hemp, ſomething has been already done by  
the high duty upon foreign hemp. If the facilities for do-  
meſtic production were not unuſually great, the policy of  
the duty, on the foreign raw material, would be highly  
queſtionable, as interfering with the growth of manufactures  
of it. But making the proper allowances for thoſe facili-  
ties, and with an eye to the future and natural progreſs, of  
the country the meaſure does not appear, upon the whole,  
exceptionable.  
  
A ſtrong wiſh naturally ſuggeſts itſelf, that ſome method  
could be deviſed of affording a more direct encouragement  
to the growth both of flax and hemp; ſuch as would be  
efteCtual, and at the ſame time not attended with too great  
  
K 2 incon-  
  
1  
  
inconveniencies. To this end, bounties and premiums offer  
themſelves to confederation; but no modification of them has  
yet occurred, which would not either hazard too much  
expence, or operate unequally in reference to the circum-  
ſtances of different parts of the Union; and which  
would not be attended with very great diſſiculties in the ex-  
ecution.  
  
Secondly. As to increaſeng the impediments to an advan-  
tageous competition of rival foreign articles.  
  
Lo this purpoſe, an augmentation of the duties on im-  
portation is the obvious expedient ; which, in regard to  
certain articles, appears to be recommended by ſufficient  
reaſons.  
  
The principal of theſe articles is ſail cloth; one inti-

the duty of ſeven and an half per cent. on certain  
kinds of cotton goods were extended to all goods of  
cotton, or of which it is the principal material, it would  
probably more than counterbalance the effect of the draw-  
back propoſed, in relation to the fabrication of the article,  
And no material objection occurs to ſuch an extenſion. The

tion of ſalt-petre, one of the principal ingredients of which it  
is compoſed, from duty. A like exemption of ſulphur,  
another chief ingredient, would appear to be equally pro-  
per. No quantity of this article has yet been produced,  
from internal ſources. The uſe made of it in finiſhing  
the bottoms of ſhips, is an additional inducement to placing  
it in the claſs of free goods. Regulations for the careful  
inſpection of the article would have a favourable ten-  
dency.  
.  
  
ManufaQtories of paper are among thoſe which are ar-  
rived at the greateſt maturity in the United States, and  
are moſt adequate to national ſupply. That of paper hang-  
ings is a branch, in which reſpectable progreſs has been  
made.  
  
Nothing material ſeems wanting to the ſurther ſucceſs of  
this valuable branch, which is already protected by a com-  
petent duty on ſimilar imported articles.  
  
In the enumeration of the ſeveral kinds, made ſubject  
to that duty, ſheathing and cartridge paper have been  
omitted. Theſe, being the moſt ſimple manufactures of  
the ſort, and neceſſary to military ſupply, as well as ſhip-  
building, recommend themſelves equally with thoſe of  
other deſcriptions, to encouragement, and appear to be  
as fully within the compaſs of domeſtic exertions.  
  
PRINTED BOOKS.  
  
The great number of preſſes diſſeminated throughout ne  
Union, ſeem to afford an aſſurance, that there is no need  
of being indebted to foreign countries. for the printing  
of the books which are uſed in the United States. A  
duty of ten per cent. inſtead of five, which is now charged  
upon the article, would have a tendency to aid the buſineſs  
internally.  
  
It occurs, as an objection to this, that it may have an  
unfayourable aſpect towards literature, by raiſing the prices  
of books in univeral uſe, in private families, ſchools, and  
other ſeminaries of learning. But the difference, it is con-  
ceived, would be without effect.  
  
As to books which uſually fill the libraries of the weal-  
thier claſſes and of profeſſional men, ſuch an augmenta-  
tion of prices, as might be occaſioned by an additional  
duty of five per cent. would be too little felt to be an  
  
  
L 2 And  
  
2 ed  
  
( 84 )  
  
And with regard to books which may be ſpecially im-  
ported for the uſe of particular ſeminaries of learning, and  
of public libraries, a total exemption from duty would-be  
allviſeable, which would go far towards obviating the  
objection juſt mentioned. They are now ſubject to a duty  
of five per cent.  
  
As to the books in moſt general family uſe, the con-  
ſtancy and univerſality of the demand would enſure exer-  
tions to furniih them at home, and the meens are com-  
pletely adequate. It may alſo be expected ultimately, in  
this as in other caſes, that the extenſion of the domeſtic  
manufacture would conduce to the cheapneſs of the article.  
  
It ought not to paſs unremarked, that to encourage the  
printing of books is to encourage the manufacture of  
  
paper.  
REFINED SUGARS AND CHOCOLATE  
  
Are among the number of extenſive and proſperous do-  
meſtic manufactures.  
  
Drawbacks of the duties upon the materials, of which  
they are reſpeciively made, in caſes of exportation, would  
have a beneficial influence upon the manufacture, and  
would conform to a precedent, which has been already fur-  
niſhed, in the inilance of molaſſes, on the exportation of  
diſtilled ſpirits.  
  
Cocoa, the raw materi now pays a duty of one cent per  
Ib. while c1,0c0:4:0,, which is à prevailing and very ſimple  
manufacture, is compriſed in the mals of articles rated  
at no more than five per cent. F  
  
There would appear to be a propriety in encouraging the  
manufacture, by a iomewhat higher duty, on its foreign  
rival, than is paid on the raw material. Two cents per  
Ib. on imported chocolate would, it is preſumed, be with-  
out inconvenience.  
  
THE foregoing heads compriſe the moſt important of  
  
the ſeveral kinds of manufaQures, which have occurred  
as requiring, and, at the ſame time, as moſt er for &#x27;  
ublic encouragement; and ſuch meaſures for affording &#x27;.  
  
it, as have appeared beſt calculated to anſwer the end,  
have been ſuggeſted. | ;  
The obſervations, which have accompanied this delinea-  
tion of objects, ſuperſede the neceflity of many ſupplemen-  
- - } &gt; p tary  
  
  
  
  
tary remarks. One or two however may not be altogether  
ſuperfluous. CF  
  
Bounties are in various inſtances propoſed as one ſpecies  
of encouragement.  
  
Tt is a familiar objection to them, that they are difficult  
to be managed and liable to frauds. — But neither that dif-  
hculty nor this danger ſeems ſulſiciently great to countervail  
the advantages of which they are productive, when rigttly  
applied. And it is preſumed to have been thewn, that  
they are in ſome caſes, particularly in the infancy of new:  
enterpriſes, indiſpenſable.  
  
It will however be neceſſary to guard with extraordinary  
circumſpection, the manner of dipenüng them. The  
requiſite precautions have been thought of; but to enter  
into the detail would ſwell this report, already voluminous,  
to a ſize too inconvenient,  
  
If the principle fliall not Le deemed inadmiſſible, the  
means of avoiding an abuſe of it will not be likely to pre-  
ſent inſurmountable obltacles. There are uſeſul guides  
from practice in other quarters.  
  
It thall therefore only be remarked here, in relation to  
this point, that any bounty, which may be applied to the  
manufatture of an article, cannot with ſafety extend beyond:  
thoſe manufaCtories, at which the making of the article is a  
regular trade, It would be impoſſible to annex adequate  
precautions to a benefit of that nature, if extended to every  
private family, in which the manufacture was incidentally  
carried on, and its being a merely incidental occupation  
which engages a portion of time that would otherwiſe be  
loft, it can be advantageouſly carried on, without fo ſpe-  
cial an aid. |  
  
The poſſibility of a diminution of the revenue may alſo  
preſent itſelf, as an objection to the arrangements, which  
have been ſubmitted.  
  
But there is no truth which may be more firmly relied  
upon, than that the intereſts of the revenue are promoted,  
by whatever promotes an increaſe of national induſtry and  
wealth. :  
  
In proportion to the degree of theſe, is the capacity of  
every country to contribute to the public treaſury; and  
where the capacity to pay is increaſed, or even is not de-  
created, the only conſequence of meaſures, which di-  
miuiſh any particular reſource, is a change of the object.  
If by encouraging the manufacture of an article at home,  
  
the  
  
— — »  
  
  
( 86 )  
  
the revenue, which has been wont to accrue from its im-  
portation, ſhould be leflened, an indemniſication can eaſily  
be found, either out c: the manufacture itſelf, or from ſome  
other object, which may be deemed more convenient.  
The meaſures however which have been ſubmitted taken,  
appregately, will for a long time to come, rather augment  
  
  
&quot;There is little :vom to hope, that the progreſs of manu-  
factures will ſo equally keep pace with the progreſs of po-  
puiation, as to prevent, even a gradual augmentation of  
the produtt of the duties on imported articles,  
  
As, nevertheleſs, an abolition in ſome inſtances, and a  
reduction in others of duties, which have been pledged  
for the public debt, is propoſed, it is effential, that it ſhould  
be accompanied, with a competent ſubſtitute. In order to  
this, it is requiſite, that all the additional duties which  
mall be laid, be appropriated in the firſt inſtance, to replace  
all defalcations, wich may proceed from any ſuch aboli-  
tion or diminution. It is evident, at firit glance, that they  
will not only be adequate to this, but will yield a conſi-  
derable ſurplus. This ſurplus will ſerve,  
  
Firſt. To conſtitute a fund for paying the bounties which  
ſha!l have been decreed, |  
  
Secondly, To conſtitute a fund ſor the operations of a  
board, to be eſtabliſhed, for promoting arts, agriculture,  
manufactures and commerce. Of this inſtitution, diffe-  
rent intimations have been given, in the courſe of this

account of their tranſactions and diſburſements; and all  
fuch ſums as ſhall not have been applied to the purpoſes ot  
their truſt, at the end of every three years, to revert to the  
treaſury. It may alſo be enjoined upon them, not to draw  
out the money, but for the purpoſe of ſome ſpecific diſ-  
burſement. .  
  
It may moreover be of uſe, to authorize them to receive  
voluntary contributions; making it their duty to apply  
them to the particular objects for which they may have  
been made, if any ſhall have been defignated by the donors.  
  
There is reaſon to believe, that the progreſs of particular  
manufactures has been much retarded by the want of {kilful  
workmen. And it often happens that the capitals em-  
ployed are not equal to the purpoſes of bringing from  
abroad workmen of a ſuperior kind. Here, in caſes,  
worthy of it, the auxiliary agency of government would in  
all probability be uſeful. There are alio valuable work-  
men, in every branch, who are prevented from emigrat-  
ing ſolely by the want of means. Occaſional aids to ſuch  
perſons, properly adminiſtered, might be a ſource of va-  
luable acquiſitions to the country.  
  
The propriety of ſtimulating by rewards, the invention  
and introduction of uſeful improvements, is admitted  
without difficulty. But the ſucceſs of attempts in this  
way muſt evidently depend much on the manner of con-  
ducting them. It is probable, that the placing of the  
diſpenſation of thoſe rewards under {ſome proper diſcreti-  
onary direction, where they may be accompanied by c-  
teral expedients, will ſerve to give them the ſureſt eſſicacy.  
It ſeems impracticable to apportion, by general rules, ſpe-  
ciſic compenſations for diſcoveries of unknown and difpro-  
portionate utility. |  
  
The great uſe which may be made of a ſund of this nature  
to procure and import foreign improvements is particularly  
  
  
form a moſt important item. 5  
  
The operation and utility of premiums have been ad—  
verted to; together with the advantages which have reſulted  
from their diſpenſation, under the direction of certain  
public and private ſocieties. Of this, ſome experience has  
been had in the inſtance of the Pennſylvania Society, for the  
promotion of manufactures and uſeful arts; but the funds  
of that aſſociation have been too contracted to produce  
  
more  
  
66  
  
more than a very ſmall portion of the good to which  
the principles of it would have led. It may confidently  
be affirmed that there is ſcarcely any thing, which has been  
deviſed, better calculated to excite a general ſpirit of im-  
provement than the inſtitutions of this nature. They arc  
truly invaluable. 775  
In countries where there is great private wealth much  
may be eſſected by the voluntary-contributions of patriotic  
incividuals; but in a community fituated like that of the  
United States, the public purſe muſt ſupply the deficiency  
of private reſource, In what can it be ſo uſeful as in  
prompting and improving the efforts of induſtry ?

all thofe, who are engaged inthe fame purfuit. And if it may likewife be affumed  
as a fact, that manufa@ures open a wider ‘field to exertions of ingenuity than agricul-  
ture, it would not be a {trained conjecture, that the labour employed in the former, be-  
ing at once more coafant, more uniform, and more ingenious, than that which is em-  
ployed in the latter, will be found at the fame time more productive.  
  
But it is not meant to lay ttrefs on obfervations of this nature ; they ought only to  
{erve as a counterbalance to thofe of a fimilar complexion. Curcumitances fo vague  
and general, as weil as fo abitract, can afford little inftruction in a matter of this  
kind ae  
  
Another, and that which feems to be the principal argument offered for the fuperior  
productivenefs of agricultural labour, turns upon the allegation, that labour employ-  
ed on manufactures yields nuthing equivalent to the rent of land or to that nett  
{urplus, as at is cailed, which accrues to the proprietor of the foil. But this diftinc-  
tion, important as it has been deemed, appears rather verba/ than /ubfantial,  
  
It as cafily difcervible, that wha, in the firit inftance, is divided into two parts, un-  
der:the des minations uf the ordinary prei vt the ttock of the farmer and rent to the  
landlord, is in tue fecvud inttance united under the general appellation of the ordina-  
ry i on the thock ef the undertaker ; and that this forma! or verbal diftribution  
conttitutes the whole difference in the ewe cafes. It feemsto have been overlooked,  
that the land is ittelf a Rock or capital, advanced or lent by its owner to the occupier  
  
fenant, and that the rent he receives is only the ordinary profit of a certain tteck  
  
id, not managed by the proprietor himfelf, but by another to whom he lends or  
ets at, aod who, on his part, advances a fecond capital, to tock and improve the land,  
upon which he alio reccives the ulual profit, The rent.of the landlord and the pro-  
fit of the farmer are therefore nothing more than the ordinary profits of two capitals  
belonging to two different perfons, and united in the cultivation of a farm: asin the  
other cafe, the furplus which arifes upon any manufattory, after replacing the ex-  
pences of carrying it on, anfwers to the ordinary profits of one or mere capitals en-  
gaged in the prefecution of fuch manufatory. It is faid one or more capitals ; becaufe  
in fact, the fame thing which 1s contemplated in the cafe of the farm, jometimes hap-  
pens in that of a manufactory. ‘There is ene who furnifhes a part of the capital, or  
jeads a part of the money, by which it is carried on, and another who carries it on,  
with the addition of hisown capital. Out of the furpius which remains, after de-  
fraying expences, an intereit is paid to the money lender for the portion of the capi-  
tal furnished by him, which exactly agrees with the rent paid to the landlord; and  
the refidue of that furplus conititutes the profit of the undertaker or manufactarer,  
and agrees with what is denominated the ordinary profits on the flock of the farmer.  
Both together make the ordimary protits ef two capitals employed in a manuladory ;  
asin the other cafe the rent of the landlord and the revenue of the farmer compote  
the ordinary profits of two capitals, employed in the cultivation of a farm.  
  
The rent, therefore, accruing to the proprictor of the land, far from being a criteri-  
on of exelufve productivenefs, as has been argued, is no criterion even of fuperior pros  
ductiveneis, The queition muft ftill be, whether the furplus, after defraying expen-  
ces, of a given capital, employed in the parcha/e and improvement ot a piece of land, is  
greater or lefs, than that of a like capital employed in the profecution of a manufadto -  
ry ; or whether the whale value produced from a given capital and a given quantity of Ja  
éour employed in one way, be greater or lefs than the whole value preduced irom an equ-  
al eafital and an equal quantity of labour employed in the other way ; or rather, perhaps,  
whether the bufiveis of agriculture or that of manufactures will yield the greatett  
product, according to a compound ratio of the quantity of the capital and the quantity  
of labour, which are enyployed in the one or in the other.  
  
‘The folution of either of thele quefions is not eafy; it involves numerous and com-  
plicated details, depending on an accurate knowledge of the objects to be compared.  
it is not known that the comparifon has ever yet becn made upon fuflicient data, pro-  
perly afcertained and analifed. To be able te make it on the prefent occafion, with  
fatisfaciory precifion, would demand more previous enquiry and inveftigation, than  
there has been hitherto either leifure or opportunity to accomplith,  
  
Some effays, however, have been made towards acquiring the requifite informa~-  
tion; which have rather ferved to throw doubt upon, than to confirm, the hypothe-  
fis under examination. But it ought to be acknowledged, that they have been too  
Little diverfified, and are too imperfcét to authorile a definitive conclufien either way;

leading rather to prebable conjeure than to certain deduction. They render it pro-  
  
bable, that there are various branches of manuiactures, in which a given capital wi j  
yield a greater total product, and a confiderable greater nett product, than an equat  
capital invefted in the purchafe and improvement of lands; and that there are alfe fome  
branches, in which both the grofi and the nett produce will exceed that of agriculrurai

aimed at thewing, that the one, as well as the other, occafions a pofi-  
tive augmentation of the total produce and revenwe of the fociety.  
  
It isnow proper to proceed a ttep further, and to enumerate the principal circum-  
ftances from which it may be inferred —That manufaduring eftablifhments net on-  
ly occafion a potitive angmentation of the produce and revenue of the fociety, but  
that they contribute effentially to rendering them greater than they could poffibly  
be, without fuch eftablifhments. Thefe circumftances are,  
  
1. The divifion of labour.  
  
2. An extenfion of the ufe of machinery.  
  
3 Additional employment to clafles of the community not ordinarily engeged in  
the bufinefs.  
  
4. The prometing of emigration from foreign conntries.  
  
s. ‘The furnithirg greater feope for the diverfity of talents and difpofitions which  
difcriminate men from each other.  
  
6. The affording a more ample and various field for enterprife.  
  
7. ‘The ercating in fome inttances a new, and fecuring in all, a more certain and  
fteady demand for the furplus produce of the for.  
  
Each of thefe circumftances has a confiderable influence upon the total mafs of in-  
duftrious effort in a community; together, they add to it a degree of energy and ef-  
fe, which are not eafily conceived. Some comments upon cach of them, in the or-  
der in which they have been fated, may ferve to explain their importance,  
  
I. As to the dinifion of labour,  
  
Ir has juitly been obferved, that there is fearcely any thing of greater moment in  
  
the economy of anstion, than the proper divilion of Jibour. ‘The feparation of oc-

cupations caules ¢aca to be carried to a much greater perfeQion than it could pofli-

bly acquite, if they were blended. ‘This arifes principally frem three circum-  
flances. :  
  
rt. The greater fkil] and dexterity naturally refulting from a conftant and undi-  
vided application to a fingle obje&amp;. It is evident, that thefe propertics mult increate,  
in proportion to the feparation and fimplification of objects, and the fteadincfs of the  
attention devoted to cach; and muft be lefs, in proportion to the conrplication ef ob-  
jects, and the number among which the attention is diftraced.  
  
ad. ‘The economy of time, by avoiding the lefs of it, incident to @ frequent tranfi-  
tion from one operation to another of a different natu This depends en various  
circumftances; the tranfition itic!f; the erderly difpofition of the implements, ma-  
chines and materials employed in the operation to be relinquifhed ; the preparatory  
fteps to the commencement of a new one.; the inte rruption of the impuife, which the  
mind of the workman acquires, from being engaged in a particular operation; the dif-  
tractions, hefitations, and reluc:ances, which attend the paflage from,one kind of bufi-  
nefs to another.  
  
3d. An extenfion of the ufe of machinery. A man ot cupied on a fingle obje@ will  
  
have it more in his power, and wil! be more naturally led to exert his imagination in-  
devifing methods to facilitate and abridge labour, than if he wete perplexed by a va-  
riety of independent and diffimilar operations. Befides this, the fabrication of ma-  
  
follows  
  
provement in 18 per-

tended.

are willing to devote the leifure refulting from the intermiffions of their ordinary pur-  
fuits to collateral labours, as a refource for multiplying their acquifitions or their en-  
joyfents. The hefbandman himfelf experiences a new fource of profit and fupport  
from the increafed induftry of his wife and daughters, invited and ftimulated by the  
demands of the neighbouring manufactorics.  
  
Befide this advantage of occafional employment to claffes having different occtpa-  
tions, there is another of a nature allied to it, and of a fimilar tendency. ‘Thisis, the  
employment of perfons who would otherwife be idle (and in many cafes a burthen  
ou the community) either from the bias of temper, habit, infirmity of body, or fome  
other caufe, indifpoling or difqualitying them for the toils of the country. It is wor-  
thy of particular remark, that, in general, women and children are rendered more  
uicful, and the latter more carly uleful, by manufaQuring eftablifhments, than they  
would otherwife be. Of the number of perfons employed in the cotton manufactories  
of Great-Britain, it is computed that 4-7 nearly are women and children ; of whom  
the greateft proportion are children, and many ef them of a tender age.  
  
And thus it appears to be one of ths attributes of manufaQures, and one of ro fmall  
confequence, to give octafion to the exertion of a greater quantity ef induftry, even  
by the /ame number of perfous, whercthey happen to prevail, than would exilt, if there  
were no fuch eftablifhments.  
  
1V. As to the promoting of emigration from foreign countries,  
  
Men reluantly quit one courle of occupation and livelihood for another, unlefs in-  
vited to it by very apparent and proximate advantages. Many, who would go from  
ene country to another, if they had a profpect of continuing, with more benefit, the  
callings to which they have been educated, will often not be tempted to change their  
ficuation, by the hope of doing better in fome other way. Manufacturers, who, lit-  
iening to the powerlul invitations of a better price for their fabrics or their labour, of  
greater cheapnels of provifions and raw materials, af an exentption from the chief  
part of the taxes, burthens, and reftraints, which they endure in the old world, of greate  
cr pertonal independence and confequence, under the operations of a more equal go-  
vernment, and of what is far more precious than mere religious toleration, a perfect e+  
quality of religious privileges, would probably flock from Europe to the united fates,  
to purfue their own trades or profeflions, if they were once made fenfible of the ad-  
vantages they would enjoy, and were infpired with an aflurance of encouragement  
and employment, will with difficulty be induced to tranfplant themfelves, with a  
view to becomihg cultivators of land  
  
if it be true then, that it is the intereft of the united ftates to open every poflible  
avenue to emigration from abroad, it affords a weighty argument for the encourage  
micnt of manufactures; which, for the reafon juft afligned, will have the ftrongeft  
tendency to multiply the inducements to it,  
  
Here is perceived an important refource, not only for extending the population, and  
with it the ufeful and productive labour of the country, but likewife for the profecu-  
tion of manufactures, without deducting from the number of hands which might o-  
therwife be drawn to tillage; and even for the indemnification of agriculture, for  
{uch as might happento be diverted from it. Many, whom manufacturing views  
would induce to emigrate, would afterwards yicld to the temptations which the  
particular fituation of this country holds out to’ agricultural purfuits. And,  
while agricuiture would in other refpects derive many fignal and unmingled advan-  
tages from the growth of manufactures, it is a probiem whether it would gain or  
lofe, asto the article of the number of perfons employed in carrying it on.  
  
V. ds to the furnifoing greater Jeope for the diverfity of talents and difpcfitions, which  
@i/-riminate men from each olber,  
  
his isa much more powerful mean of augmenting the fund of natiousl induftry  
chan may acfirit fightappear. It isa juft obfervation, that minds, of the ttrongeft and  
moli active powers for their proper objects, fall below mediocrity, and labour without  
effec, if confined to uncongenial purfuits. And it is thence to be inferred, that the  
rciults of human exertion may be immenfely increafed by diverfifying its objeds.  
Woaen all the different kinds of induftry obtain in a community, cach individual can  
fiud bis proper element, ave can cail into activity the whole vigour of his nature. And  
the community is bencfited by the fervices of its refpedtive members, in the manner  
iw which each can krve it with mok cffea.

ivation to he better improved, and more  
productive —And while, by their influence, the condition of each individual farmer  
would be meliorated, the total mafsof agricultural produ@tion would probably be  
encreafed. For this mutt evidently depend as much, if not more, upon the degree of  
improvement, than upon the number of acres under culture.  
  
It merits! particular obfervation, that the multiplication of manufaories not only  
furnifhes a market for thole articles which have been accuftomed to be produced in  
abundance, in a country; but it likewife creates a demand for fuch as were either  
unknown or produced in confiderable quantities. The bowels as well as the furface  
of the earth are ranfacked for articles which were before negleed. Animals, plants,  
and minerals acquire a utility and value which were before unexplored.  
  
The foregoing confiderations feem fufficient to eftablifh, as general propofitions,  
that it is the intereft of nationsto diverfify the induftrious purfuits of the individu-  
als who cempofe them—That the eitablifhment of manufactures is calculated not  
only to encreafe the general ftock of ufeful and productive labour; buteven to im-  
prove the ftate of agriculture in particular; certainly to advance the interefts of  
thofe who are engaged in it. ‘There are other views that will hereafter be taken of  
the fubje@, which, it is conceived, will ferve to canfirm thefe inferences.  
  
Ill. Previoufly to a further difcuflion of the gbjections to the encouragement of  
manufa@ures which have been fated, it will be of ufe to fee what can be faid, in re-  
ference co the particular fitwation of the united fates, againft the conclufions appear-  
ing to refult from what has been already offered.  
  
It may be obferved, and the idea is of no inconfiderable weight, that however true  
it might be, that a ftate which poffeffing large traéts of vacan: and fertile territory,  
was at the fame time fecluded from foreign commerce, would find its intereft, and  
the intereft of agriculture, in diverting a part of its population from tillage to manu-  
fatures ; yet it will not follow, that the fame is true of a fate, which having fuch  
vacamt and fertile territory, has at the fame time ample opportunity of procuring  
from abroad, on good terms, all the fabrics of which it ftands in need, for the fupply  
of itsinhabitants. The pewer of doing this at lea(t fecures the great advantage of  
a divifion of labour, leaving the farmer free to purfue exclufively the culture of his  
land, and enabling him to procure, with its products, the manufactured fupplies re-  
quifite either to his wants or to his enjeyments. And though it fhould be true, that  
in fettled countries, the diverfification of induftry is conducive to an encreafe in the

lar interetts.  
  
It may be affirmed, therefore, in refpe&amp; to hands for carrying on manufa@ures,  
that we thall ina great meafure trade upon a foreign ftock ; relerving cur own for  
the cultivation of our lands, and the manning of our fhips, as far as character and cir-  
cumftances fhall incline. It is not unworthy of remark, that the objection to the fue-  
cefs of manufactures, deduced from the fearcity of hands, is alike applicable to trade  
and navigation, and yet thele are perceived to Mourifh, without any fenfible impedi-  
ment from that caufe.  
  
As tothe dearnefs of labour, (another of the obftacles alledged) this has relation  
principally to two circumftances; one, that which has been juft difcufled, or the fear-  
city of hands; the other, the greatnefs of profits.  
  
As far as it is a confequence of the fcarcity of hands, it is mitigated by all the confi-  
derations which have been adduced as lefiening that deficiency. It is certain too,  
that the difparity in this refpe&amp;t, between fome of the moft manufaduring parts of  
Europe, and a large proportion of the united fates, is not nearly fo great as common-  
ly imagined. It is alfo much lefs in regard to artificers and manufacturers, than in  
regard to country labourers ; and while a careful comparifon fhews, that there is, in  
this particular, much exaggeration; it is alfo evident, that the effeét of the degree of  
difparity which does truly exift,is diminifhed in proportion to the ufe which can be  
made of machinery.  
  
To illuftrate this lait idea—Let it be fuppofed, that the difference of price, in two  
countries, of a given quantity of manual labour requifite to the fabrication of a given  
article, isas ten; and that fome MeCHANIC POWER is introduced into both countries,  
which, performing half the neceflary labour, leaves only half to be done by hand, it  
is evident, that the difference in the cott ef the fabrication of the articie in quettion,  
in the two countrics, as far as it is connected with the price of labour, will be reduced  
from ten to five, in confequence of the introduction of that power.  
  
This circumftance is worthy of the moft particular attention. It diminifhes im-  
meniely one of the objections, moft ftrenuoufly urged, againft the fuccels of manu-  
factures in the united flatcs.  
  
‘To procure all fuch machines as are known in any part of Europe, can only require  
a proper provifion and due pains. ‘The knowledge of feveral of the moft important  
of them is already pofiefled. ‘The preparation of them here, is, in moft cafes, prac-  
ticable,on nearly equal terms. As far as they depend on water, fome fuperiority  
of advantayes may be claimed; from the uncommon variety and greater cheapnefs of  
fituations adapted to mill feats, with which different parts of the united ftates abound.  
  
So far as the dearnefs of labour may be a confequence of the greatnefs of profits in  
any branch of bufinefs, it isno obftacie to its fuccels. ‘The undertaker can afford to  
pay the price.  
  
There are grounds to conclude, that undertakers of manufaures in this country  
can at this time ailerd to pay higher wages to the workmen they may employ, than  
are paid to fimilar workmen in Europe. The prices of foreign fabrics in the maf-  
kets of the united ftates, which will for a long time regulate the prices of the domef-  
tic ones, may be confidered as compounded of the following ingredients. ‘The firtt  
coft of materiais, including the taxes, if any, which are paid upon them where the  
are made; the expence of grounds, buildings, machinery, and tools; the wages of the  
perfens employed in the manufactory; the profitson the capital or ftock employed;  
the cominillions ot agents te purchafe them where they are made; the expence of  
  
tranfportatien to the united fates, including infurance and other incidentaj charges ;  
the taxes or duties, if any, and fees of ofhee, which are paid on their exportation ; the  
taxes or duties, and fees of office, which are paid on their importation.  
  
As tothe frit of thefe items, the coft of materials, the advantage, upen the whole,  
is at prefent on the fide of the united fates, and the difference, in their favour, mutt  
encreafe, in proportion as a certain and extenfive domeftic demand fhall induce the  
proprietors of land to devote more of their attention to the production of thofe ma-  
terials. It ought not to efcape obfervation, in a compasifon on this point, that fome  
of the principal manufaQuring countries of Europe are much more dependent on fo-  
reign fupply ior the materials of theis manufaQuyes, than would be the wnited Rates,

he courfe of this report, he cannot but  
perceive very‘powerful inducements to a transfer of himfelf and hiscapital to the uni-  
ted ftates. Among the reflections, which a moft interefting peculiarity of fituation  
is calculated to fugyeft, it cannot efcape his obfervation, as a cireumftance of moment  
in the calculation, that the progreflive population and improvement of the united  
ftates, enfure a continually encreafing domeftic demand for the fabrics which he fhall  
produce, not to be affected by any external cafualties or viciflitudes.  
  
But while there gre circumftances fufficiently trong to authorife a cenfiderable de-  
gree of reliance on the aid of foreign capital, towards the attainment of the objec iu  
view, it is fatisitatory to have good grounds of affurance, that there are domettic re-  
fources, of themfelves adequate to it. It happens, that there isa fpecies of capital ac-  
tually exifting within the united ftates, which relieves from all inquietude on the  
{core of want of capital—this is the funded debt,  
  
‘The effe&amp; of a funded debt, as a fpecies of capital, has been noticed upon a former  
eccafion ; but a more particular elucidation of the point feems to be required by the  
fireis which is here laid.wpon it—this hall accordingly be attempted.  
  
Public funds anfwer the purpofe of capital, fromthe eftimation in which they are  
ufuaily held by monied men; and confequently, from the eafe and difpatch with  
which they can be turned into money. This capacity, of prompt convertibility into  
money, caules a transfer of ttock to be ina great number of cafes equivalent to a pay-  
ment in coin—And where it does not happen to fuit the party who is to receive, to  
accept a transfer of ftock, the party who is to pay is never at a lofs, to find elfewherea  
purchafer of his Lock, who will furnifh him,in lieu of it, with the coin of which ke  
ftands in need.

Hence in a found and fettied fate of the public funds, a man poffeffed of a fum in  
them cana embrace any {cheme of bufinefs which offers, with as much confidence as if  
he were pofleffed of an equal fum in coin.  
  
This operation of public funds, as capital, is too obvious tobe denied: but it is ob-  
jected to the idea of their operating as an augmentation of the capital ef the communi-  
  
ty, that they ferve to occafion the defrudtion of fome other capital to an equal  
amount.  
  
The capital which alone they can be fuppofed to deftrey, muft confit of—The an-  
nual revenue, which is applied to the payment of intereft on the debt, and to the gra-  
dual redemption of the principal—The amount of the coin which is employed in cir-  
culating the funds, or, in other words, in cffe@ting the different aliemations which they  
undergo.  
  
But the following appears to be the true and accurate view of this matter-—  
  
tit. Asto the point of the annual revenue requifite for payment of interch and res  
demption of principal.  
  
Asa determinate proportion will tend to per[picuity in the reafoning, let it be fup-  
pofed that the annual revenue to be applied, corre{ponding with the modification of  
the 6 per cent. tock of the united flares, is in the ratio of eight upon the hundred;  
that is, in the firft infkance, fix on accownt of intereft, and two en account of prine  
cipal.  
  
Thus far it is evident, that the capital deflroyed to the capital created, would bear  
no greater propertion than 8to 100. ‘There would he withdrawn from the ‘total  
ae of other capitals a fum ef cight dollars to be paid to the public creditor: while  
he would be pofleffed of a fum of one hundred dollars, ready to be applied to any  
purpofe, to be embarked in any enterprife, which might appear to him eligible  
Here then the augmentation of capital, or the excels of that which is produced, beyond  
that which is deitroyed, is equal to nimety-two dollars.  
  
To this couclufion it may be ebjected, that the fum of eight dollars is to be with-  
dray.n anoually, until the whole hundred is extinguifhed, and it may be inferred,  
that in procefs of time a capital will be deftroyed equal to that which is at firk  
created.  
  
But it is neverthele(s true, that during the whole of the interva), between the cre  
ation of the capital of 100 dollars, and its reduction to a fum not greater than that  
of the annual revenue appropriated to its redemption there will be a greater ac-  
tive capital in exiftence than if no debt had been contraded. The fum drawn from  
other capitals tn any one year will not exceed eight dollars : but there will be af every  
inflant of time during the whole period in queition, a fum correfponding with /o much  
of she principal, as remains unredeemed, in the hands of fome perfon or other, employed  
or ready to be employed in fome profitable undertaking. ‘There will therefore con-  
{tantly be more capital, in capacity to be employed, than capital taken from employ-  
ment. The excefs for the firit year has been ftated to be ninety-two dollars; it will  
dimiaith yearly ; but there always will be an excefs, uatil the principal of the debe  
is brought to a level with the rnepeeMING ANNuiry ; that is, in the cafe which  
has been affumed by way of example, to e1cuT pottars. The reality of this ex-  
cefs becomes palpable, if it be fuppofed, as often happens, that the citizen of a fo-  
reign country imports inte the united fates 160 dol&#x27;ars for the purchafe of an equal  
fum of public debt here isan abfolute augmentation of the mafs of circulating  
coin to the extent of reo dollars. «At the end of a year the foreigner is prefumed  
to draw back eight dollars on account of his principal and intereft, but he {till leaves  
ninety-twe of his original depolit in circulation, as he in like manner leaves eighty  
four at the end of the fecond year, drawing back then alfo the annuity ef eight dol-  
Jars: And thus the matter proceeds; the capital left in circulatien diminifhing each  
year, and coming nearer to the level of the annuity drawn back. There are howe-  
ver fome differences in the ultimate operation of the part of the debt which is pur-  
chafed by foreigners, and that which remains in the hands of citizens. But the ge-  
neral effect im cach cafe, though in different degrees, is to add tothe ative capital of  
the country.  
  
Hitherto the reafoning has proceeded on a conceffion of the pofition, that there  
is a deftruction of fome other capital, to the extent of the annuity appropriated to  
the payment of the intereft and the redemption of the principal.ef the debt ; but in  
this, too much has been conceded. There is at moft a temporary tranaler of fom

other capital, to the amount of the annuity, from thofe who pay to the creditor whe  
receives; which he again reftores to the circulation to refume the offices of a capital,  
This he does either immediately ,by employing the money in fome branch of indufiry,  
er mediately, by lending it to fome other perfon whe does fo employ it, or by fpend-  
ing it on his own maintenance. In either fuppofition, there is no deftruction of capi-  
tal; there isnothing more than a fufpenfion of its motion for atime; that is, while  
it is paffing from the hands of thofe who pay inte the public coffers, and thence  
through the public creditor, into fome other channel of circulation. When the pay-  
ments of intereft are periodical and qwick, and made by the inftrumentality of  
banks, the diverfion or {ufpenfion of capital may almoft be denominated momentary.  
  
Hence the deduction on this account is far lefa, than it at firft fight appears  
to be.  
  
There is evidently, as far as regards the annuity, no deftru@ion nor transfer of any  
other capital, than that pertion of the income of each individual which goes to make  
up the annuity. The land which furnifhes the farmer with the fum which he is to  
contribute remains the fame; and the like may be obferved of other capitals. Indeed  
as far as the tax, which is the object of contribution (as frequently happens when it  
docs not opprefs by its weight) may have been a motive to greater exertion in any O¢-  
cupation ; it may even ferve to encreafe the contributory capital: This idea is not  
without importance in the general view of the fubject.  
  
It remains to fee, what further deduction ought to be made from the capital which  
is created, by the exiftence of the debt, on account of the coin which is employed in  
its circulation. ‘This is fufceptible of much lefs precife calculation than the article  
which hasbeen juft difcuffed. It is impoflible to fay what preportion of coin is ne-  
ceffary to carry on the alienations which any fpecies of property ufually undergoes,  
‘The quantity indeed varies according to circumftances. But it may ftill without he-  
fitation be pronounced, fram the quicknefs ef the rotation, or rather of the tranfitions,  
that the medium of circulation always bears but a {mall proportion to the amount of  
the property circulated. And it si thence fatisfa@torily deducible, that the coin em-  
ployed in the negociations of the funds, and which ferves to give them activity, as  
capital, is incomparably lefs than the fum of the debt negociated for the purpofe of  
bufinefs.  
  
It ought not, however, to be omitted, that the negociation of the funds becomes  
itfelf a diflinét bufinefs ; which employs, and by employing, diverts a portion of the  
circulating coin from other purfuits. But making due allowance for this circum-  
fiance, there is no reafon to conclude, that the effeét of the diverfion of coin, in the  
whole operation, bears any confiderable proportion to the amount of the capital to  
which it gives activity. ‘The fum of the debt in circulation is continually at the  
command of any ulfeful enterprife, the coin itfelf which circulates it, is never more  
than momentarily fufpended from its ordinary funGions. It experiences an inceflant  
and rapid flux and reflux to and from the channels of induftry to thofe of {peculations  
in the funds,  
  
There are ftrong circumftances in confirmation of this theory. The force of mo-  
nied capital which has been difplayed in Great-Britain, and the height to which eve-  
ry (pecies of induflry has grown up under it, defy a folution, from the quantity of  
coin which that kingdom has ever poffefled. Accordingly it has been, coeval with  
its funding fyftem, the prevailing opinion of the men of bufinefs, and of the generali-  
ty of the moft fagacious theorifts of that country, that the operatien of the public  
funds as capital has contributed to the effec in queftien. Among ourfelves appear-  
ances thus far favour the fame conclufion. Induftry in general feems to have been  
reanimated. There are fymptoms indicating an extemfion of our commerce. Our  
navigation has certainly of late had a confiderable {pring, and there appears to he in  
many parts of the union a command of capital,which, till lately, fince the revolution at  
Jeaft, was unknown. But it is at the fame time to be acknowledged, that other circum-  
ttances have concured (and in a great degree) in producing the prefent ftate of things,  
and that the appearances are not yct fufliciently decifive to be entirely relied upon  
  
In the queftion under difcuffion, it is important to diftinguith between an ab/olute  
encreafe of capital er an accefion of real wealth, and an artificial encreafe of capital, as an en-  
giue of bafinefs, or as an initrument of induftry and commerce.—In the firft fenfe,  
a funded debt has no pretenfions to being deemed ap encreafe of capital; in the lait,

it har pretenfions which are not ecafy te be controverted. Of a fimilar nature is bank  
eredit, and, in an inferior degree, every {pecies of private credit.  
  
But though a funded debt is not in the firft initance, ‘an abfolute encreafe of capi-  
tal, or an augmentation of real wealth; yet by ferving as a new power in the opera-  
tions of induftry, it has within certain bounds a tendency to encreafe the real wealth  
of a community ; in like manner as money borrowed by a thrifty farmer, to be laid  
eut in the improvement of his farm, may, in the end, add to his {tock of real riches.  
  
There are refpectable individuals, who, from a juft averfion to an accumulation of  
  
ublic debt, are unwilling to concede to it any kind of utility, who can difcern no  
good to alleviate the ill with which they fuppofe it pregnant; who cannot be per-  
fuaded that it ought in any fenfe to be viewed as an encreafe of capital, leit it thould  
be inferred, that, the more debt the more c: apital, the greater the burthens the greater  
the bleffings of the community.  
  
But it interefts the public councils to eftimate every objeé as it truly is; to appreci-  
ate how far the good in any meafure is compenfated by the ill; or the ill by the good ;  
either of them is feldom unmixed.  
  
Neither will it follow, that an accumulation of debt is defirable, becaufe a certain  
degree of it operates as capital.— here may be a plethora in the political, as in the  
natural body; there may be a ftate of things in which any fuch artificial capital is  
unneceflary. The debt too may be {welled to fucha fize, as that the greateft part of  
it may ceafe to be ufeful as a capital, ferving only tu pamper the diflipation of idle  
and diflolute individuals; as that the fums required to pay the intereft upon it may  
become oppreflive, and beyond the means which a government can employ, confil-  
tently with its tranquility, to raife them ; as that the refources of taxation, to face  
the debt, may have been ftrained too far, to admit of extenfions adequate to exigen-  
cies which regard the public fafety.  
  
Where this critical point is, cannot be pronounced ; but it is impoflible to believe  
that there is not fuch a point.  
  
And as the viciflitudes of nations beget a perpetual tendency to the accumulation  
ef debt, there ought to be,ian every government a perpetual, anxious, and unceafing  
effort to reduce that which atany time exifts, as fait as thall be practicable, confiftent-  
ly with integrity and good faith  
  
Reafonings on a fubje&amp; comprehending ideas fo abftrac&amp;t and complex, fo little re-  
ducible to precife calculation, as thofe which enter into the queftion juft difcuffed, are  
always attended with a danger ef running into fallacies. Due allowance ought there-  
fore to be made for this poflibility—But as far as the nature of the fubje@ admits of  
it, there appears to be fatisfaCtory ground for a belief that the public funds operate as  
a refource of capital to the citizens of the united ftates, and, if they are a refource at  
all, it is an extenfive one.  
  
To all the arguments which are brought to evince the impracticability of fuccefs  
in manufa@uring eftablifhments in the united fates, it might have beema fufficient  
anfwer to have referred to the expericace of what has been already done—It is certain  
that feveral important branches have grown up and flourifhed with a rapidity which

oraland pelitical view, renders the fact highly intercfting.  
  
Neither does the above enumeration comprehend all the articles that are manu-  
faCtured as regular trades. Many others occur, which are equally well eftablithed,  
but which, not being of equal importance, have been omitted. And there are many  
attempts {till in their infancy, which, though attended with very favourable appear-  
ances, could not have been properly comprized in an enumeration of manufa@ories  
already eftablifhed. There are other articles alfo of great importance, which, though  
ftriftly {fpeaking, manufadtures, are omitted, as being immediately conneéted with  
hufbandry : fuch are flour, pot and pearl ath, pitch, tar, turpentine, and the like.  
  
‘There remains to be noticed, an objection tothe encouragement of manufadiures,  
of a nature different from thofe which queftion the probability of fuccefs: This is  
derived from its fuppofed tendency to give a monopoly of advantages to particular  
claffes, at the expemce of the ret of the community, who, it is affirmed, would be able  
to procure the requifite fupplies of manufactured articles om better terme from fo-  
reigners, than from our own citizens, and who, it is alledged, are reduced to a necef-  
fity of paying an enhanced price for whatever they want, by every mealure which  
obitructs the free competition of foreign commodities.  
  
It is notan unreafonable feppofition, that meafures which ferve to abridge the  
free competition of foreign articles, have a tendency to occafion an enhancement of  
prices, and it is not to be denied, that fuch is the efie in a number of cafes; but the  
fact docs not uniformly correfpond with the theery. A redaion of prices has in  
{everal intances immediately faccecded the eftablifhment of a domeflic manufa@ure.  
Whether it be that foreign manufaclurers endeavour to fupplant, by underfelling our  
own, or whatever elfe be the caufe, the effe@ has been fuch as is ftated, and the re-  
verfe of what might have been expected.  
  
But though it were true, that the immediate and certain effe&amp; of regulations cen-  
trouling the competition of foreign with domestic fabrics was an encreafe of price, it  
isuniverially truce, that the contrary is the ultimate effect with every fuccefsful manu-  
facture. When adomefic manufacture has attained to perfeAion, and has engaged  
in the profecution ef it, a competent number of perfons, it invariably becomes cheap-  
er, Being free from the heavy charges which attend the importation of foreign  
commodities, it can be afforded, and accordingly feldom or never fails to be fold  
cheaper, in procels of time,than was the foreign article for which it isa fubfMitute.

poly, and by degrees reduces the price of the article to the minimum of a reafonable  
prout on the capital employed. bhis accords with the reafun of the thing and with  
expericnce.  
  
Whence it follows, that it isthe intereft of a community, with a view to even-  
tual and permanent cconomy, to en ourage the growrn ot manulactures. In a na-  
tional view, @ temporary enhancement of price mult always be weil compenlated  
by a permanent reduction of it.  
  
It is a reflection which may with propriety be indulged here, that this eventual  
diminution of the prices of manufactured articles, which is the refule of incernal  
manufacturing eftablifhments, has a dire&amp;t, and very important tendency to benefit  
agriculture. it enables the farmer to procure, with a fmalier quantity of his labour,  
the manufactured produce of which he flands in need, and confequently encrcafes  
the value of his income and property.  
  
The objections which are commoniy made to the expediency of encouraging, and  
to the probability of fucceeding in manufacturing purfuits, in the united tiates,  
having now been difcufied, the confiderations which have appeared in the courte ef  
the difeuflion, recommending that fpecies of induftry to the patronage of the ge-  
vernment, will be materially itrengthened by a few general and fomce particular to-  
pics, which have been naturally referved for {ubfequent notice  
  
1. There feems te be a moral certainty, that the trade of a country which is both  
manufacturing and agricultural, will be more lucrative and profperous than that of a  
country which is merely agricultural.  
  
One reafon for this is fouad in that general effort of nations (which has been a  
ready mentioned) to procure from their own foils, the articles of prime neceflity  
requifite to their own confumption and ule ; and which ferves to render the demand  
for a foreign fupply of fuch articles in a great degree occafional and contingent.  
Hence, while the neceilities of nations, exclulively devoted to agriculture, fer the  
fabrics of manufacturing ftates are conftant and regular, the wants of the latter, for  
the produdts of the former, are liable to very confiderable fluuations and interrup-  
tions. The great mequalities, reiulting from difference of feafons, has been elfewhere  
emarked ; this uniformity of demand on one fide, and untteadinefs of it om the  
other, mult neceflurily have a tendency to caufe the general courfe of the exchange  
of commodities between the parties to turn to the difadvantages of the merely agre-  
cultural ftates. Peculiarity of fituatien, a climate and foil adapted to the produc-  
tion of peculiar commodities may, fometimes, contradict the rule; but there 1s eves  
ry reafon to believe that it will be found, in the main, a jut one.  
  
Another circumitance which gives a fuperiomty of commercial advantages to ftates  
that manufacture, as well as cultivate, confiits in the mvore numerous attractions,  
which a more diverfified market offers to foreign cuftomers, and in the greater fcope  
which it affords to mercantile enterprife. It 1s a pofition of indifputable truth in  
commerce, depending too on very obvious reafons, that the greateft refort will e-  
ver be to thofe marts, where commodities, while equally abundant, are mott various.  
Each difference of kind, holds out an additional! inducement : and it isa pofition nat  
lefs clear, that the field of enterprife mutt be enlarged to the merchants of a country,  
in proportion to the variety, as wellas the abundance of commodities which th  
find at home for exportation to forcign markets  
  
A third circumftance, perhaps not inferior to either of the other two, conferring the  
fuperiority which has been flated, has relation to the thaynations of demand for certay  
commodities, which at fome time or other interfere m« or lefs with the fale ot al  
Che nation which can bring to market but few articles, is likely to be more quickiy  
andfenfibly affected by fuch ftagnations, than one which is always pofleffled of a great  
variety of commoditics: the former frequently fiuds too great a portion of its Lock  
ef materials, for fale or exchange, lying on hand—or is: obliged to make injuricvs  
facrifices to fupply its want of foreign articles, which are nwmerows and ergent, in  
proportion to the fmalinefs of the number of itsown. The latter commonly finds  
iticll indemnified, by the high prices of fome articles, for the low price of others  
—and the prompt and advantageous fale of thofe articles which are in demand,  
evalles its merchants the better to wait for a favourable change, in refpect te  
  
thofe which are not. ‘There is ground to believe, that a difference of f ‘

54 Political Regifter.  
  
From thefe cireumfances colle@ively, two important inferences are to be drawn ;  
one, that there is alwaysa higher probability of a favourable balance of trade, im  
regard to countries, in which manufactures, founded on the bafis of a thriving a-  
yriculture Mourifh, than in regard to thofe which are confined wholly, er almott  
whoily to agriculture; the other (which is alfo a confequence of the firit) that coun-  
tcics of the former defeription are likely to poflefs more pecuniary wealth, or money,  
than thote of the latter  
  
Facts appear to correfaond with this conclufion. The importations of manufaQur-  
ed fupplies feem iuvariably to drain the merely agricultural people of their wealth.  
Let the fituation of the manufacturing countries of Europe be compared in this par-  
ticular, with that ef countries which only cultivate, and the difparity will be ftrik-  
ing. Okxher caufes, it is true, help to account for this difparity between fome of  
them ; and among thefe caufes, the relative ftate of agriculeure; but between o-  
thers of them, the mot prominent circumttance of diflimilitude arifes from the com-  
parative ftateof manufa@ures. In corroboration of the fame idea, it ought not to  
efeape remark, that the Weft-India iflands, the foils of which are the moft fertile,  
and the nation which in the greateft degree fupplics the reft of the world with the  
precious metals, exchange to a lofs with almott every other country-  
  
As far as experience at home may yuide, it willlead tothe fameconclufion. Pre-  
viaus to the revolution, the quantity of coin, poficiied by the colonies, which now  
compole the united flates, appeared to be inadequate to their cigculation ; and their  
debt to Great-Britain was progreflive. Since the revolution, the ftates in which  
thanufactures have moft encreafed, have recovered failer from the injuries of the  
jate war; and abound moft in pecuniary refources.  
  
It ought to be admitted, however, in this, asin the preceding cafe, that caufes irre-  
lative to the ftate of marifaciures account, in a degree, for the phenomena remark-  
ed. ‘The continual progrefs of new iettlements has a natural tendency to occafion  
au unfavourabic balance of trade ; though it indemnifies for the inconvenience, by  
that encreale of the national capital which flows from the converfion of waite inte  
improved lands; and the different degrees of external commerce, which are carried  
en by the different ftates, may make material differences in the comparative ftate of  
their wealth. The firft circumitance has reference to the defieicncy of coin, and the  
encreaie of debt previous to the revolution; the lait, to the advantages which the moft  
manufacturing {tates appear to have eujoyed, over the others, fince the termination  
ef the late war.  
  
But the uniform appearance of an abundance of fpecie, as the concomitant of  
a flourifhing flate of manufactures, and of the reverfe

lance of trade, and very pre judic tal to their intereits,  
Thefe difadvantages preis with no {mall weight, on the landed intercft of the  
  
country. In feafons ef peace, they caufe a ferious deduction from the intrinfic va-  
Jue of the products of the toil. Inthe time of a war, which fhould either involv  
ourfelves or another nation, poflefling a confiderable there of our c: rrying trade, the  
  
charges on the tranfportation ef our commodities, bulky as moft of them are, could  
  
o  
  
hardly fail to prove a grievous burthen to the farmer: while obliged to depend, in  
fo great a degrce, ashe now docs, upon foreign markets for the vent of the furplus  
of his labour.  
  
As far as the profperity of the fifheries of the united ftates is impeded by the want  
of an adequate market, there arifes another {pecial reafon for defiring the extention of  
  
manufaGures. Befides the fifth, which, in many places, would be likely to make a  
part of the fubfiftence of the yr yee nployed; it is known that the oils, bones, and  
ikins of marine animals are of ext alive ufe in various manufacures. Hence the  
profpect of an additional demand for the produce of the fifheries.  
  
One more point ef view only remains, in which to confider the expediency of ca-  
couraging manufactures in the united fates.  
  
It isnot uncommon to meet with an opinion, that though the promoting of manu-  
attures may be the intercit of a part of the union, it is contrary to that of another  
part. The northern and fouthern regions are fometimes reprefented as having ad-  
verfe interefts, in this refpect. Thole are called manufacturing, thefe ag ricultural  
ftates, and a {pscies of oppofition is imagined to fubfift between the manufacturing  
and agricultural interefts.  
  
This idea of an oppofition bet ween thofe two interefts is the common error of the  
early periods of every country, but experience gradually diffipates it. Indeed they  
are perceived fu often to fuccour and to befriend each other, that they come at length  
to be confidered as one; a fuppofition wich has been Srogne otly abufed, and is not  
univerlaliy true. Particular encouragements of particular ma nufatures m ay beofa  
nature to facrifiee the interefts of landholders to thofe of manufa@turers; but it is  
  
  
  
neverthelefs a maxim well eftablifhed by experienve, and generaily acknowledged,  
  
where there has been fufficient experience, that the egyregate profperity of manufac-  
tures, and the aggregate profperity of agriculture are 1otimately connected. In the  
courfe of the d:fcutfion which has had place, various weighty confidcrations have  
been adduced, operating in fupport of that maxim. Per haps the fuperior fteadinefs  
of the demand of a domettic scales for the furplus produc  
convincing argument ef its rach  
  
Ideas of a contrariety of interefts between the northern and fouthern regions of

circumftances on which fuch contrariety is ufually predicated, authorifes a diredHly  
contrary conclufion. Mutual wants conftitute one of the ftrongeft links of political  
conne@ion, and the extent of thefe bears a natural proportion t@ the diverfity in the  
means of mutual fupply. ;  
  
Suggeftions of an oppofite complexion are ever tu be deplored, as unfriendly to  
the fteady purfuit of one great common caufe, and to the perfect harmony of all the  
  
arts.  
  
, In proportion as the mind is accuftomed to trace the intimate conneAion of inter-  
ef, which fubfitts between all the parts of a fuciety, united under the /ame govern-  
ment; the infinite variety of channels which ferve to circulate the profperity of each  
to and through the reft, in that proportion will it be little apt to be diflurbed by fo-  
licitudes and apprehenfions which originate in local difcriminations. It isa truth as  
impertant as it is agreeable, and one to which it is not eafy to imagine exceptions,  
that every thing tending to eftablith /ufantial and permanent order, in the affairs of 3  
country, to encreale the total mafs of indufiry and opuleuce, is ultimately beneficial to  
every part of it. On the credit of this great truth, an acquiefcence may fafely bg  
accorded, from every quarter, to all inftitutions and arrangements which pramife a  
confirmation of public order, and an augmentation of natienal refource.  
  
But there are more particular confiderations which ferve to fortify the idea, that  
the encouragement of manufactures is the intercft of al! parts of the union. If the  
northern and middle ftates fhould be the principal fcenes of {uch eftablifhments, they  
would immediately benefit the more fouthern, by creating a demand for productions,  
fome of which they have in common with the other ftates, and others of which ei-  
ther are peculiar to them, or more abundant, or of better quality, than elfewhere;  
‘Thefe productions principally are, timber, flax, hemp, cotton, wool, raw filk, indigo,  
iron, lead, furs, hides, fkins, and coals; of thefe articles cotton and indigo are peculiar  
to the fouthern fates; as are hitherto, dead aud coal ; flax and hemp are, or may be,  
raifed in greater abundance there than in the more northen ftates; andthe wool of  
Virginia is faid to be of a better quality than that of any other ftate ; a circumfance  
rendered the more probable by the refle&amp;tion, that Virginia embraces the fame Jati-  
tudes with the fineft woo! countries of Europe. ‘The climate of the fouth isalfo bet-  
ter adaptedto the production of filk.  
  
The extenfive cultivation of cotton can perhaps hardly be expected, but from the  
previous efiablifhment of domeftic manufactories of the article; and the fureft en-  
covragement and vent for the others, would refult from fimilar eftablifhments ia  
refpect to them.  
  
If, then, it fatisfaXorily appears, that it is the intereft of the united fates, gene-  
rally, to encourage manufactures, it merits particular attention, that there are cir-  
cumftances which render the prefent a critica] moment for entering with zeal upon  
the important bufinels. The effort cannot fail to be materially feconded by a con-  
fiderable and encreafing influx of money, in confequence of foreign fpeculations im  
the funds—and by the diforders which exift in different parts of Europe.  
  
The firk circumftance not only facilitates the execution of manufa&amp;uring enter-  
prifes; but it indicates them as a neceflary mean to turn the thing itfelf to advaa-  
tage, and to prevent its being eventually an evil. If ufefulemployment be not found  
for the money of foreigners brought to the country to be inveited in purchafes of the  
public debt, it will quickly be re-experted to defray the expence of an extraordinary  
confumption of foreign luxuries; and diftrefling drains of our fpecie may hereafter  
be experienced, to pay the intereft and redeem the principa! of the purchafed debt.  
  
This ufeful employment too ought to be of a nature to produce folid and perma-  
nent improvements. Ifthe money merely ferves to give a temporary {pring to fo-  
reign commerce ; asit cannot procure new and lafling outlets for the products of the  
country ; there will be no real or durable advantaye gained. As far as it {hall find its  
way in agricultural ameliorations, in opening canals, and in fimilar improvements, it  
will be produtive of fubftantial utility. But there isreafon to doubt, whether in fuch  
channels it is likely to find fufficient employment, and till more,whether many of thofe  
who poflefs it would be as readily attracted to objets of this nature, as to manufac-  
turing purfuits; which bear greater analogy to thofe to which they are accuftomed,  
aud to the ipirit generated by them.  
  
To open the one field, as well as the other, will at leat fecure a better profped of  
ufeful employment, for whatever acceflion of money there has been or may be.

duty. Io the interval, between the laying of the duty and a propor-  
tional encreafe of price, it nvey difcourage importation, by interfering with the pro-  
fits to be « XI eGied from the fale of the article.  
  
Bounties are f{ometimes not only the beft, but the only proper expedient, for u-  
niting the encouragement of a new obje@ of agriculture, with that of a new object  
of manufaure. It is the intereft of the farmer to have the production of the raw  
material promoted, by co unterading the interference of the foreign material ef the  
fame kind ; it is the interef : of the manufadturer to have the material abundant and  
cheap. If prior to the domeftic produ@tion of the material, in fuflicient quantity,  
to fupply the manufaClurer on good terms, a duty be laid upon the importation of it  
from abroad, with a view to promote the raifing of it at home, the intereft beth of  
the farmer and manufaurer will be differved. By either deflroying the requifite  
fupply or raifing the price of the article, beyond what can be aflorded to be given for  
it, by the conduor of an infant manufaure, it is abandoned or fails ; and there be-  
ing no domefic manufaories te create a demand for the raw material, which is rail-  
ed by the farmer, it is in vain that the competition of the like foreign article may  
have been deftroyed.  
  
It cannot efeape notice, that a duty upon the importation of an article can no  
otherwife aid the domettic produdion of it, than by giving the latter greater advan-  
tagesin the home market. It can have no influence upon the advantageous fale of  
the article produced, in foreign markets; no tendency therefore, to promote its ex-  
portatic n.  
  
‘The true way to conciliate thefe two interefts, isto lay a duty on foreign manu-  
fadures of the material, the growth of which is defired to be encouraged, and to ap-  
ply the produce of that duty by way of bounty, either en the production ef the  
material itfelf, or upon its wanufa@ure at home, or upon beth. In this difpofition of  
the thing, the manufacturer commences his enterprife, under every advantage, which  
is attainable, as to quantity or price of the raw material : and the farmer, if the boun-  
ty be immediately to him, is enabled by it to enter into a fuccefsful competition with  
the for reign material; if the bounty be to the mantfadurer,on fo much of the domel-  
tic material as he confumes, theoperation is ucarly the fame; he has a motiveof inter

sincident tot  
  
  
  
60 Political Regifter.  
  
The only qualification of the generality of the phrafe in queftion, which feems te  
be admiffible, is this—That the object to which an apprepriation of money is to be  
made, be genera/ and not local; its operation extending in fa&amp;,or by poflibility,  
throughout the union, and not being confined to a particular fpot.  
  
No objection ought to arife to this conitru“tion, from a fuppofition that it will im.  
ply a power to do whatever elfe fhould appear to congrefs conducive to the general  
welfare. A power to appropriate money with this latitude, which is granted too, in  
expre/s ters, would not carry a power to do any other thing, not authorifed in the  
conilitution, cither exprefsly or by fair implication.  
  
V. Premiums.  
  
Thefe are of a nature allied to bountics, though diftinguifhable from them in fome  
important features  
  
Bounties are applicable to the whole quanlity of an article produced, or manufa4u-  
red,or exported,and involve a correfpondent expence— Premiums ferve to reward fome  
particular excellence or fuperiority, fome extraordinary exertion or fkil!, and are dif-  
penfed only in a {mall number of cafes : But their effec is to ftimulate general effort—  
contrived fo as to be both honorary and lucrative, they addrefs themfe ves to different  
paflions; touching the chords as well of emulation as of intereft: They are accor-  
dingly a very economical mean of exciting the enterprife of a whole commu-  
nity.  
  
There are various focieties in different countries, whofe obje&amp; is the difpenfation of  
premiums for the encouragement of agriculture, arts, manufa@ures, and commerce; and  
though they are for the moft part volumary aiffociations, with comparatively flender  
funds, their utility has been immenfe. Much has been done by this mean in Great-  
Britain ; Scotland in particu&#x27;ar owes materially to it a prodigious amelioration of  
condition. Froma fimilar eftablifhment in the united ftates, fupplied and fupport-  
ed by the government of the union, vaft benefits might reafonably be expected. Some  
further ideas on this head fhall accordingly be fubmitted, in the conclafion of this  
report.  
  
VI. The exemption of the materials of manufafures from duty.  
  
The policy of that exemption as a general rule, particularly in reference to new  
eftabliihments, is obvious. It can hardly ever be advifeable to add the obftruGions  
of fifcal burthens to the difficulties which naturally embarrafs a new manufadure :  
and where it is matured and in condition to become an object of revenue, it is generally  
{peaking better thatthe fabric,than the material, fhould bethe fubje&amp; of taxation. Ideas  
of proportion betwen the quantum of the tax and the value of the article, can be more  
eafily adjufted in the former, than in the latter cafe. An argument for exemptions of  
this kindin the united fates, isto be derived from the practice, as far as their necefli-  
ties have permitted, of thofe nations whom we are to meet as competitors in our own  
and in foreign markets.  
  
There are, however, exceptions to it; of which fome examples will be given under  
the next head.  
  
The laws of the union afford inftances of the obfervance of the policy here recom-  
mended ; but it will probably be found advifeable to extend it to fome other cafes.  
Of a nature bearing fome affinity to that policy, is the regulation whjch exempts from  
duty the tools and implements, as well as the books, clothes, and houfhold furniture  
of foreign artilts, who come to refide in the united tates ; am advantage already feeu-  
red to them bythe laws of the union, and which it is, in every view, proper to con-  
tinue.  
  
Vil Drawhacks of the duties which are impe led on the materials of manuf 2ures.  
  
It has already been obferved as a general rule, that duties on thofe materials ought  
with certain exceptions to be forborne. Of thefe exceptions, three cafes occur, which  
may ferve as examples—One, where the material is itfelf an object of general or exten-  
five confumption, and a fit and productive fource of revenue—Another, where a ma-  
nufacture of a fimpier kind, the competition of which with a like domettic article is  
defired to be rettrained, partakes of the nature of a raw material, from being capa-  
ble, by a further procefs, to be converted into a manufafure of a different kind, the  
introduction or growth of which is defired to be encouraged—A third, where the  
material itfeli isa production of the country, and in fufficieat abundance to furnilha  
cheap aad plentiful fupply to the uational manufafurers.

Under the fic defcription comes the article of molaffes. It is not only a fair ob-  
ject of revenue, but it being a fweet, it is jult that the confumers of it fhould pay a  
duty as well as the confumers of fugar.  
  
Cottons and linen im their white {tate fall under the fecond defeription. A duty  
upon fuch as are imported is proper, to promote t ic¢ Cometic manufacture of fimilar  
articles in the fame ftate ; a draw-back of that duty is proper, to encourage the print-  
ing and itaining at home of thofe which are Drought from abroad. When the iirf of  
thefe manufactures has attained fufficient maturity in a country, to furnith a full iup-  
py fer the fecond, the utility of the drawback cea!  
  
The article of hemp either now does, or may be expected foon to exemplify the  
third cafe, in the united ftates.  
  
Where duties on the materials of manufactures are not laid for the purpofe of pre-  
venting a competition with fome domettic praduction, the fame reafons which recom-  
  
mend, asa general rule, the exemption of thole mz ils from duties, would recom-  
  
mend, as a like general rule, the allowance of drawbacks, in favour of the

rer: accordingly, fuch draw-backs are familiar in countries which fyfRematically puriue  
the bufinefs of manufactures; which furnifhes an argument for the obfervance of a  
  
fimilar policy in the united fkates; and the idea has been adopted by the laws of the  
  
union, in the initance of falt and molafles. [tis believed chat it will be found advan-

Their infrumentality isevery where confpicuous.  
  
It is fortunate for the united flates that they have peculiar advantages for deriving  
the full benefits of this moft valuable material, and they have every motive to im-  
prove it, with fyftematic care. It is to he found in various parts of the united ftates,  
in great abundance, and of almo&amp; every quality ; and fuel, tue chief inrament in  
manufaturing it, is both cheap and plenty.—This particularly applies to charcoal ;  
but there are productive coal mines already in operation, and trong indications,  
that the material isto befound in abundance, in a variety of other places.  
  
The enquiries to which the fubject of this report hasled have been anfwered, with  
preofs, that manufactories of iron, though generally underftood to be extenfive, are  
far more fo than iscommonly fuppofed. ‘Lhe kinds in which the greateft progrefs  
has been made, have been mentioned in another place, and need not be repeated;  
but there is little doubt that every other kind, with due cultivation, will rapidly  
fucceed. It is worthy of remark, that feveral of the particular trades, of which  
it is the bafis, are capable of being carried on without the aid of large capitals.  
  
tron works have very greatly encreafedfin ths united ftates, andare profecuted with  
much more udvantage than formerly. The average price before the revolution was  
about fixty-four dollars per ton, at prefent it isabout eighty ; a rife which is chiefly  
to be attributed to the encreafe of manufaures of the material.  
  
‘The ftil! further extenfion and multiplication of Such manufa&amp;ures will have the  
double efle&amp; of promoting the extraction of the metal itfelf, and of converting it  
to a greater number of profitable purpofes.  
  
Thofe manufa@ures too unite in a greater degree, than almoft any others, the fe  
veral requifites which have been mentioned, as proper to be confulted in the feledlion  
of objcdts.  
  
The only further encouragement of manufactories of this article, the propriety of  
which mey be confidered as unqueftionable, feems to be an encreafe of the duties on  
foreiyn rival commodities.  
  
Steel is a branch which has already made a confiderable progrefs, and it is afcer- :  
  
tained that fome new enterprifes, on a more extenfive f{cale, have been lately fet on  
foot. ‘The facility of carrying it to an extent, which will fupply all internal demands,  
and furnifh a confiderable furplus for exportation, cannot be doubted. ‘The duty up-  
en the importation of this article, which isat prefent 75 cents per cwt. may it is con-  
ceived be fafely and advantageoufly extended to Ivo cents. It is defireable, by decifive  
arrangements, to fecond the efforts which are making, in fo

in Hifpaniola, in particular, muft not only contribute very much to that effect, but  
may be expe&amp;ted to give it fome duration, ‘Thefe circumftances, and the duty of  
three cents per gallon on molafies, may render it difficult for the diftillers of that ma-  
terial to maintain, with adequate profit, a competition with the rum brought from  
the Weft-Indies, the quality of which is fo confiderably fuperior.  
  
The confumption of geneva or gin in this country is extenfive. It is not long  
fince diftilleries of it have grown up among us, to any importance. They are now  
becoming of confequence, but being ftillin their infancy, they require prote@ion.  
  
It isreprefented, that the price of fome of the materials is greater here than in  
Holland, from which place large quantities are brought—the price of labour confider-  
ably greater—the capitals engaged in the bufinefs there much larger, than thofe  
which are employed here—the rate of profits, at which the undertakers can afford ta  
carry it om, much Jeis—the prejudices, in favour of imported gin, ftreng. Thefe  
circumftances are alledged to outweigh the charges, which attend the bringing of  
the article from Europe to the united ftates, and the prefent difference of duty, to as  
to obftrud&amp; the profecution of the manufacture, with due advantage.  
  
Experiment could perhaps alone decide with certainty the juitnefs of the fuggef-  
tions which are made; but in relation to branches of manufactures fo important, it  
would feem inexpedient to hazard an unfavourable iffue, and better to err on the fide  
of too great, than of too {mall a d.fference, in the particular queftion.  
  
It istherefore fubmitted, that an addition of two cents per gallon be made to the  
duty on imported fpirits of the firft clafs of proof, with a proportionable encreafe on  
thofe of higher proof, and that a deduction of one cent per gallon be made frem the  
duty on fpirits diftilled within the united ftates, beginning with the firft clafs of proof,  
and a proportionable deduction from the duty on thofe of higher proof.  
  
It is afcertained, that by far the greateft part of the malt liquors confumed in the  
united fates are the produce of domeftic brewerics. It is defirable, and, in all like-  
lihood attainable, that the whole confumption fhould be fupplied by ourfe!ves.  
  
The malt liquors, made at home, though inferior to the beft, are equal to a great  
part of thofe which have been ufually imported. ‘The progrefs already made is an  
earneft of what may be accomplifhed. ‘The growing competition is an affurance  
of improvement. ‘This willbe accelerated by meafures tending to invite a greater  
¢apital into this channel of employment.  
  
To render the encouragement of domeftic breweries decifive, it may be advifeable  
to fubftitute to the prefent rates of duty eight cents per gallon generally ; and it will  
deferve to be confidered, as a guard againft invafions, whether there ought not to be  
a prohibition of their importation, except in cafks of confiderable capacity. It isto  
he hoped, that fuch a duty would banifh from the market, foreign malt liquors of in-  
ferior quality ; and that the beft kind only would continue to be imported,till it fhould  
be fupplanted by the efforts of equal kill or care at home,  
  
Till that period, the importation fo qualified would be an ufeful ftimulusto im-  
provement. And inthe mean time, the payment of the encreafed price, for the en-  
joyment of luxury, in order to the encouragement of a moft ufeful-branch of domef,  
tic induftry, could not reafonably be deemed an hardfhip.  
  
Asa further aid to manufactures of grain, though upon a f{maller fcale, the articles  
of ttarch, hair powder, and wafers, may, with great propriety, be placed among thofe  
which are rated at fifteen per cent. No manufa@iures are more fimple, nor more com-  
pletely within the reach of a full fupply, from domeftic fources ; and it is a policy,  
as common as it is obvicus, to make them the objets cither of prohibitory duties, oF  
ef exprefs prohibition,  
  
FLAX and HEM P.  
  
Manufaétures of thefe articles have fo much aflinity to each other, and they are fo  
often blended, that they may with advantage be confidered in conjun@tion. The ime  
portance of the linen branch to agriculture—its precious effets upon houfhold indule  
try—the eafe with which the materials can be produced at home to any requifite  
extent—the great advances which have been already made, in the coarfer fabrics of  
them. eipecially in the family way, conftitute ¢laims, of peculiar force, to the patros  
nage of government.  
  
This patronage may be afforded in various ways; by promoting the growth of the  
materials: by encreafing the impediments to an advantageous competition of rival  
foreign articles; by direct bounties or premiue upon the home manufacture.

Firk. As to promoting the growth of the materials.  
  
In refpeét to hemp, fomething has been already done by the high duty upon fo-  
reign hemp. If the facilities for domettic production were not unufually great, the  
policy of the duty, en the foreign raw material, would be highly queftivnabie, as in-  
terfering with the growth of manufactures of it. But makin» the proper allowances  
for thofe facilities, and with an eye tothe future and natural p: ogres of the country,  
the meafures does not appear, upen the whole, exceptienable.  
  
A ftrong with naturally fuggetts itfelf, that fome method could be devifed of afford-  
ing a more direct encouragement to the growth both of flax and hemp; fuch as would  
be effectual, and at the fame time not attended with too great inconveniencies. ‘To  
this end, bounties and premiums offer themfelves to con stion ; but no modification  
of them has yet occurred which would not either hazard too much expence, er ope-  
rate uncqually in reference to the circumftanees of different parts of the union; and  
which would not be attended with very great difficulties in the execution.  
  
Secondly. As to enerea/ing thei n pediment: to an advant geaus competition of rival foreign  
articles.  
  
To this purpofe, an augmentation of the duties on importation is the obvious expe-  
dient which, in regard te certain articles, appears to be recommended by fufficicat  
reaions.  
  
The principal of thefe articles is fail-cloth ; one intimately conne@ed with naviga-  
tion and defence ; and of which a flourifhing manufactory is eftabhthed at Bollon,and  
very promifing ones at feveral ~_— laces. . -  
  
it is prefumed to be both fafe and advifeable to place this in the clafs of articles  
rated at 10 percent. A ftrong rtafon for it refults from the confideration, that a  
bounty of two pence fterling per ell is allowed in Great-Britain, upon the exporta-  
tion of the fail.cloth manufa&amp;ured in that kingdom.

72 Political Regifter.  
  
To encourage the raifing and improving the breed of fhecep, at home, would cer.  
tainly be the moft defirable expedient, for that purpofe ; but it may not be alone  
fuflicient, efpecially as it yet a problem, whether our wool be capable of fuchs  
degree of improvement, as to render it fit fur the finer fabrics.  
  
Premiums would probably be found the beft means of promoting the domeftic,  
and bounties the foreign fupply. ‘The firft may be within the compafs of the infti-  
tution hereafter to be fubmitted. The laft would require a {pecific legiflative provi-  
fion. If any bounties are granted, they ought of courfe to be adjufted with an eye  
to quality as well as quanuty.  
  
A fund for this purpofe may be derived from the addition of 24 per cent. to the  
prefent rate of duty, on carpets and carpeting ; an encreafe to which the nature of  
the article fuggefls no objection, and which may at the fame time furnith a motive  
the more to the fabrication of them at home ; towards which fome beginnings have  
been made.  
  
S [&gt; = K.  
  
The prodution of this article is attended with great facility in moft parts of the  
united itates. Some pleafing eflays are making in Connecticut, as well towards that  
as towards the manufacture of what is produced. Stockings, handkerchiefs, rib.  
bons, and buttons are made, though as yet but in {mall quantities.  
  
A manufactory of lace, upon a feale not very extenfive, has been long memorable  
at Ipfwich, in the ftate of Maflachufetts.  
  
An exemption of the material from the duty, which it new pays on importation,  
and premiums upon the productien, to be difpenfed under the direCtion ef the infti-  
tution before alluded to, feem tobe the only fpecies of encouragement advifeable at  
fo early a ftage of the thing.  
  
G L A s 8.  
  
‘The materials for making glafs are found every where. In the united ftates  
there is no deficiency of them. The fands and fltones called Tarfo, which include  
flinty and chryflaline fubftances generally, andthe falts of various plants, particu-  
larly the fea-weed kali or kelp, conititute the eflential ingredients. An extraordi-  
nary abundance of fuel is a particular advantage enjoyed by this country for fuch  
manufactures, They, however, require large capitals, and involve much manual  
labour.  
  
Different manufatories of glafs are now on foot in the united ftates. ‘The prefent  
duty of 124 percent, on all imported articles of glafs, amounts to a confiderable en-  
couragement to thofe manufactorics. If any thing in addition is judged eligible,  
the moit proper would appear to be a dire&amp;t bounty, on window glafs and black bot-  
tics,  
‘The firft recommends itfelf as an obje&amp; of general convenience ; the laft adds to  
that character, the circumftance of being an important item in breweries. A com-  
plaint is made of great deficiency in this refpect.  
  
GUN-POWDE R.  
  
No fmall progrefs has been made of late in the manufacture of this important arti-  
cle: It may indeed be confidered as already eftabhithed ; but its high importance  
renders its further extenfion very defirable.  
  
The encouragements which it already enjoys, are a duty of Ie per cent. on the  
forcign rival article, and an exemption of falt-petre, one of the principal ingredients  
of which it is compofed, from duty. A like exemption of fulphur, another chief  
ingredient, would appear to be equally proper. No quantity of this article has  
yet been produced, from internal fources. The ufe made of it in finifhing the bot-  
toms of fhips, is an additional inducement to placing it in the clafs of free goods.  
Regulations for the careful infpection of the article would have a favourable ten-  
dency.

Manufatories of paper are among thofe which are arrived at the greateft maturity,  
in the united flates, and are moft adequate to national fupply. That of paper hang-

Nothing material feems wanting to the further fuccefs of this valuable branch,  
which is already protecled by a eompetent duty on fimilar imported articles.

the fort, and neceflary to military fupply, as well as thip-building, recommend  
themfelves equally with thofe of other defcriptions to encouragement, and appear to  
be as fullywithin the eompafs of domettic exertions.  
  
PRINTED BOOKS.  
  
The great number of preffes difleminated throughout the union, feem to afford an  
affurance, that there isno need of being indebted to foreign countries for the printing  
of the books which are ufed in the united ftates. A duty of ten per cent. inftead of  
five, which is now charged upon the article, would have a tendency to aidthe bufinefs  
internally.  
  
Jt occurs, as an objeion to this, that it may have an unfavourable afped towards  
literature, by raifing the prices of booksin univerfal ufe  
end other feminaries of lcarnimg.  
out effect.  
  
As to books which ufually fill the librarics of the wealthier claffes, and of profef-  
fiona! men, fuch an augmentation of prices, as might  
duty of five per cent. would be too little felt to be  
fition.  
  
And with regard to books which may be fpecially  
cular feminaries of learning, and of public libraries,  
  
,in private families, {chools,  
But the difference, it is conceived, would be with-  
  
occafioned by an additional  
an tmpediment to the acqui-  
  
imported for the ufe of parti-  
li a total exemption from duty  
would be advifeable, which would go far towards obviating the objc&amp;tion juft men-  
tioned. They are now fubje&amp; toa duty of five per cent.  
As to the books in moft general family ufe, the conftancy and univerfality of the  
demand would enfure exertions to furnifh them at home, and the means are com-  
pletely adequate. [t may alfo be expected ultimately, in this, as in other cafes, that  
the extenfion of the domeftie manufacture would conduce to the cheapnefs of the  
article.  
It ought not to pals usremarked, that to encourage the printing of books is to en-  
courage the manuiacture of paper.  
REFINED SUGARS and CHOCOLATE.  
  
Are among the number of extenfive and profperous domeftic manufadures.  
  
= Drawbacks of the duties upon the materials, of which they are refpeCtively made,  
in cafes of exportation, would have a beneficial influence upon the manufacture, and  
would conform to a precedent, which has been already furnished in the inflance of  
  
molaffes, on the exportation of diftilled {pirits.  
  
Cocoa, the raw material,now pays a duty of one cent. per lb. whilechocolate, which  
isa prevailing, and very fimple manufacure, is cemprifed in the mafs of articles  
rated at no more than five per cent.  
  
Chere would appear to be a propriety in encouraging the manufaQure, by a fome-  
what higher duty, on its foreign riva&#x27;, than is paid on the raw material. Two  
  
cents per lb. on imported chocolate would, it is prefumed, be without inconvenience.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The foregoing heads comprile the moft important of the feveral kinds of manufac-  
tores, which have occurred as requiring, apd, at the fame time, as mof proper for  
public encouragement ; and fuch meafures Psqaffording it, as have appeared beik  
calculated to anfwer the end, have been fuggefed.  
  
The obfervations, which have accompanied this delineation of obje&amp;s, fuperfede  
the neceflity of mamy fupplementary remarks. Onc or two, however, may not be  
altogether fuperflueus.  
  
Boustics are in various inftances propofed as one fpecies of encouragement.  
  
It isa familiar objection to them, that they are difficult to be managed, and liable  
to frauds—But neither that difficulty nor this danger fecms fufficiently great to coun-  
tervail the advantages of which they are productive, when rightly applied. And  
is is prefumed to have been fhewn, that they are in fome cafis, pafticularly in the  
infancy of new enterprifes, indifpenfable.  
  
It will however be neceflary to guard with extraordinary circumf{pedtion, the man-  
ner of dilpenfing them. ‘The requifite precautions have been thought of ; but to  
enter ito the detail would {well this report, already voluminous, to a fige too incon-  
venient,  
  
If the principle thall not be deemed inadmiffible, the means of avoiding an abufe  
of it will not be likely to prefent infurmountable obftacles, There are uletul guides  
from practice in other quarters.

It thall cherefore only be remarked here, in relation to this point, that any bounty  
which may be applied to the anu/faéure of an article, cannot with fafety extend he-  
yond thofe manufactorics, at which the making of the articles isa regular trade. It  
would be impoffible to annex adequate precautions to a benefit of that nature, if ex-  
tended to every private family, in which the manufa&amp;ture was incidentally carried on;  
and from its being a merely incidental occupation, which engages a portion of time  
that would otherwife be loft, itcan be advantageoully carried en, withuut fo fpeci-  
al an aid.  
  
The pofiibility of a diminution of the revenue may alfe prefent itfe&#x27;f, as an objec-  
tion to the arrangements which have been fubm itted.  
  
But there is no truth which may be more firmlf relied upon, than that the inter-  
efts of the revenue are promoted, by whatever promotes an encreafe of national in-  
duftry and wealth. :  
  
In proportion to the degree of thefe, is the capacity of every country to contri-  
bute to the public treafury ; and where the capacity to pay is encreafed, or is even  
not decreafed, the only confequence of meafures which diminith any particular re-  
fource, isachange of the object. If by encouraging the manufacture of an article  
at home, the revenue which has been wont to accrue from its importation fhould be  
leffened, an indemnification can eafily be found, either out of the manufacture itfelf,  
or from fome other obje&amp; which may be deemed more convenient.  
  
The meafures, however, which have been fubmitted, taken aggregately, will for  
a long time to come rather augment than decreafe the public revenue.  
  
There is little room to hope, that the progrefs of manufaCures will fo equally  
keep pace with the progrefs of population, as to prevent, even a gradual augmentae  
tion of the produét of the duties on imported articles.  
  
As, neverthelefs, an abolition in fome inftanccs, and a reduction in others, of duties  
which have been pledged for the public debt, is propofed, it is effential, that it  
hould be accompanied with a competent fubititute. In order to this it is requifite  
thatall the additional duties which hall be laid, be appropriated in the firft initance  
to replace all defalcations, which may proceed from any fuch abolition or diminution.  
It is evident, at firft glance, that they will not only be adequate to this, but will yield  
a confiderable furplus. This furplus will ferve,

Seconnty. To conftitute a fund for the operations of a board, to be eftablithed,  
for promoting arts, agriculture, manufatures and commerce. Of this inftitution  
different intimations have been given, in the courfe of thisreport. An outline of a  
plan for it fhall now be fubmitted.  
  
Let a certain annual fum, be fet apart, and placed under the management of com-  
miflioners, not lefs than three, to confift of certain officers of the government, and  
their fucceffors in office.  
  
Let thefe commiflioners be empowered to apply the fund confided to them, to de-  
fray the expences of the emigration of artifts, and manufacturersin particular bragch-  
es of extraordinary importance—to induce the profecution and intreduction of ufe-  
ful difcoyeries, inventions, and improvements, by proportionate rewards judicioufly  
held out and applied.—to encourage by premiums, both henowrable and lucrative,  
the exertions of individuals, and of claffes, in relation to the feveral objects they are  
charged withpromoting—and to afford fuch other aids to thofe objcéts as may be  
generally defignated by law.

ations and difburfements 3 and all fuch fums as fhall not have been applied to the pur-  
poles of their truft, at the end of every three years to revert to the treafury. It may  
alfe be enjoined upon them, not to draw out the money, but for the purpofe of fonie  
{pecific difburfement.  
  
It may.moreover be of ufe, to authorife them to receive voluntary contributions;  
making it theirduty to apply them to the particular obje&amp;s for which they may have  
heen made, if any shall have been defignated by the donors,  
  
There is reafon to believe that the progrefs of particular manufactures has been  
much retarded by the want of fkilful workmen. And it often happens that the ca-  
pitals employed are not equa! to the purpofesof bringing from abroad workmen of  
a fuperior kind. Here, in cales worthy of it, the auxiliary] agency of government

would in all probability be ufeful. There are alfo valuable workmen, im every branch,  
who are prevented from emigrating, folely by the want of means. Octafional aids a  
fach perfons, properly adminiftered, might be a fource of valuable acquifitions to  
the country.  
  
The propriety of ftimulating by rewards, the invention and introduGtion of ufeful  
jmprovements, is admitted w ithout difheulty. But the fuccefls of attempts in this  
way muft evidently depend much on the manner of conducting them. It is proba-  
ble, that the placing of the difpenfation of thole re wards under fome proper difcre-  
tionary direétion, where they may be accompanied by collateral expedients, will ferve  
to give them the fureft efficacy. It feems impracticable to apportion, by general  
rules, fpecific compenfations for difcoveries of unknown and difproportienate uti-  
Jity-  
  
‘The great ufe which may be made of a fund of this nature to procure and import  
foreign i nprovements is particularly obvious. Among thefe, the article of machines  
would form a molt important item.  
  
The operation and utility of premiums have been adverted to; together with the  
advantages which have refulted from their difpenfation, under the direction of cer-  
  
tain public and private focieties. Of this fome experience has been had in the in-  
fiance of the Pennfylvania fociety, for the promotion of manufactures and ufeful  
arts; but the funds of that aflociation have been too contracted to produce more  
than a very fmall portion of the good to which the principles of it would have led.  
Ir may confidently be affirmed that there is fcarcely any thing, which has been de  
viled, better calculated to excite a general fpirit of improvement, than the inftitu-  
tions of this nature. They are truly invaluable.  
  
In countries where there is great private wealth, much may be effected by the vo-  
luntary contributions of petriotis individuals; but in a community fituated like thas  
of the united ftates, the public purfe mutt fupply the deficiency of private refource,  
In what can it be fo ufeful, as in prompting and improving the efforts of induf-  
  
  
  
Ly  
  
All which is bu mbly fubmitted.

&quot;there appears to be in many parts oi the timon a.  
command of capital) vhrch,&#x27; rill Irftelj&#x27;, finccthe  
revolution at least, was unknown. But 1t .is ui  
the fame tirne to be acknowledged, that othej  
circuroftances have concurred (and in a great de­  
gree) in producing the present state of things, and  
that the appearances are not yet fufiiciently deci­  
sive to be relied upon.  
In the quell ion under difcufiian, it is impor­  
tant to d.fHnguifh between an abjilute encreafe c/&#x27;  
tftiial3 orpnaccejjionofreal iveu:tb and an  
filial ettcrfaje of capitaly as an engine of buljnel$3  
or as an , instrument of iriduttry &quot;&#x27;&quot;and commerce.  
In the firft sense, a funded debt has no preten­  
tions to being deemed an encreafe of capital} in  
the last, it has pretentions which are not easy to  
be cyntroverred. Of a fim&#x27;ilar nature is bank  
credit, and, in an inferior degree, every species  
of private credit.  
But though a funded debt is not ir. th« firft in­  
stance, an absolute encreafe of capital, or aa aug­  
mentation of real wealth j yet by Ifrving as a  
Uew power in the operations of industry, it has  
within certain bounds a tendency to encreafe the  
real wealth of a community $ in like manner  
money borrowed by a thrifty farmer, to be laio  
out in the improvement of his farm, m«y, in tiv: &#x27;  
end, add to his stock of real riches.  
There are refpediahie individuals, who, from a  
juA aversion to an accumulation of public deb:,  
lity, who can discern no good to alleviate the il!  
with which they suppose it pregnant j who can­  
not be that it ought in any sense to be  
viewed as an encreafe of capital, left it fliould be  
inferred, that the more debt the more capital, the  
greater the burthens the greater the bleiiings of  
the community.  
But it ijiterefls the public councils to ertimate  
every object as it truly is j to appreciate how far the  
good in any measure i; compensated by the ill j  
r»r the ill by the good j either of them is seldom  
unmixed.  
Neither wi!! v. follow, that an accumulation of  
debt is desirable, becau»e a certain degree of ir  
operates as capital. There may be a plethora ir  
the political, as in the natural body j there ma)  
be a ft ate of things in which any such artificial  
capital is iinnecelfary. The debt too may be  
swelled to such a size, as that the greater! part or  
it may cease to be ufeful ai&quot;. capital, serving on­  
ly to pamper the difiipation of idle and diiTolute  
individuals ; as that the sums required to pay  
the interest upon it may Lecotue oppreflive, ano  
beyond the means which a government can em­  
ploy, confidently with its tranquility, to raift  
them ; as that the reJqurccs of taxation, to face  
the debt, mav have en drained too far to ad­  
mit of extensions adequate to exiger.cies, which  
regard the pubiic fafery.  
Where this critical point is, cannot be pro­  
nounced j but it is hnpotftble to believe, that  
there is not such a point«-  
And as the viciJlitudes of nations beget a per­  
petual tendency to the accumulation of debt,  
there ought to be in every government a perpetual,  
anxious and unceasing effort to reduce that,  
which at any time exilts, as fafl: as shall be prac­  
ticable, confidently with integrity and good faith.  
Reasonings on a fubjett comprehending ideas  
so abftraft and complex, so little reducible to  
precise calculation as those which enter into the  
question just difcufTed, are alvVavs attended with  
a danger of running into fallacies. Due allow­  
ance ought therefore to be made for this polli­  
bility—But as far as the nature of the fubjedt ad­  
mits of it, there appears to be fatisfa&amp;ory ground  
for a belief that the public funds operate as a re  
source of capital to the citizens of the Uniter  
States, and, it they are a refoutce at all, it is an  
extensive one.  
To all the argument&#x27;s which are brought so  
evince the impracticability of success in manufac­  
turing establishments in the United States, it  
might have been a fufficient answer to have re­  
ferred to the experience of what has been alr,ead\

commodities;  
It is not an unreasonable supposition, that mea  
fures which serve to abridge the free competitor  
of foreign articles, have a tendency to occasion ar  
enhancement of prices, and it is not to be denied  
that such is the efieCt in a number of cases ; bui  
the faCt dees not uniformly correlpond with the  
theory- A reduction of prices has in several in­  
(lances immediately succeeded the eftablifhmcnl  
of a domestic manufacture# Whether it be thai  
foreign manufacturers endeavor to supplant, b)  
uuderfelling our own, or whatever else be the  
caufc, the effeCt has been such as is Sated, and  
the reverse of what might have been expeCted.  
But though it were true, that the immediate  
and certain effeCt of regulations controuling the  
competition of foreign with domestic fabrics was  
an encreafe of price, it is univerfaily true, that  
the contrary is the ultimate effeCt with every fuc­  
cefsfui mnnufaCture. When a domestic manu­  
facture has attained to perfection, and has enga­  
ged in the prosecution of it a competent numbei  
of persons, it invariably becomes cheaper. Be-  
free from the heavy charges, which attenc  
  
Numb. 19.  
  
che importation of foreign commodities, it can  
oe ast&quot; rled, and accordingly seldom or never  
fjila to be fold cheaper, in process of time, than  
was tl e foreign article for which it: is a substitute.  
The internal competition, worth takes pl-ee,  
soon does away everything like monopoly, &#x27;and  
by degrees reduces the price of the article to tl e  
minimum of a reasonable profit on the capital enr­  
ployed. This accords with the reason of tl t  
chinp and with experience.  
Whence it follows, that it ij thjs inrereftcf a  
Community, with a view toeventual and perma­  
nent ceccnomy, to encourage the growth of manu­  
aCtures. In a national view, a temporary  
enhancement of price rr.uft alw: y , be well com­  
perrfafed by a permanent reduction of it.  
Jt is a reflection, which may with propriety bi  
indulged here, that this eventual diminution of the  
prices of manufactured articles, which is the re­  
pslt of internal m&amp;nufaCturing effabUfhments, has  
i direCt and very important tendency to benefit  
igricuiture. It enables the farmer, to procure  
A&#x27;iih a fmallet quantity of his labor, the manufac­  
tured produce,of which he stands in need, and  
confpquently encreafes the value of his income  
md property.  
The objections which are commonly made to  
lie expediency of encouraging and to the probabi­  
icy of succeeding in manufacturing pursuit*, in  
he United Scaces, having now been difcufTed, the  
onliderations which have appeared in the course  
&gt;f the discussion, recommending that species of in­  
lultry so the patronage of the government, will be  
naterially strengthened by a few general and some  
►articular topics, which have been naturally re­  
&quot;erved for subsequent notice.  
I. There seems to be a moral certainty, that the  
rade of a country which ii both manufacturing and  
igricultural, will be more lucrative and prolperous  
ban that of a country, which is merely agjicultu­  
?!.  
One reason for tlis is found in that general ef-  
Fort .of nations (which has been already mention­  
ed) to procure from their own foils, the articles of  
wume neceiiity requisite to their own consumption  
Mid use ; and which serves to render their demand  
for a foreign supply of such articles in a great de­  
cree occasional and contingent. Hence, while the  
neceflities of nations exclusively devoted to agri­  
:ulture, for the fabrics of manufacturing states are  
:onftant and regular, the wants of the latter for  
he produ&amp;s of the former, are liable to very con*  
IderabJe fluctuations and interruptions. The  
a. /iu»ar Crfl#rcece 01  
feafors, have been eifewnere remarked : this uni­  
formity of demand on one fide, and unsteadiness  
sf it, on the other, rr.uft necessarily have a tenden­  
cy to cause the general course of the exchange of  
commodities between the parties to turn to the  
djfadvantage of the merely agricultural states.  
Peculiarity of situation, a climate and foil adapt­  
jd to the production of peculiar commodities  
may, fomctiines, con • adiCt the rule j but there  
s every leafon to believe that it will be found in.  
:he main, a just one.  
Another circumstance which gives a fuperiori­  
:v of commercial advantages to states, that manu­  
facture, as well as cultivate, consists in the more  
icnaerous attractions, which a more diverfified  
market offers to foreign cuttomers, and in th£  
;reater scope, which it affords to mercantile en­  
srprife. It is a portion of indisputable truth in  
commerce, depending too on very obvious rea­  
sons, that the greatest resort will ever be to those  
marts, where comrn6dities, while equally abun­  
dant, are most various. Each difference of kind  
kolds out an additional inducement: and it is £  
position not less clear, that the field of enterprise  
must be enlarged to the merchants of a country,  
in proportion to the variety, as well as the abun­  
dance of commodities which they find at home  
for exportation to foreign markets.  
A third circumstance, perhaps not inferior to either  
of the other two, conferring the superiority which  
has been stated, has relation to the stagnations of  
lemand for certain commodities which at some  
time or other interfere more or less with the sale  
»f all-I——The nation which can bring to market  
but few articles is likely to be more quickly and  
fenllbly aft&#x27;eCted by such stagnations, than one,  
which is always pofiefTed of a great variety of  
commodities : the former frequently finds too great  
a portion of its stock of materials, for sale or  
sxchange, lying on hand—or is obliged to make  
injurious facrifices to supply its wants of foreign  
irticles,&#x27; which are numerous and urgent, in pro­  
portion to the fmallnefs of the number of its own.  
The latter commonly finds itfelf indemnified, by  
the high prices of some articles, for the low pri­  
ces of others—and the prompt and advantageous  
sale of those articles which are in demand enables  
its merchants the better to wait for a favorably  
changr, in respeCt to those which are not. There  
s ground to believe, that a difference of fitua..  
ion, in this particular, has immensely different  
&#x27;ffeCts upon the wealth and prolperity of nations.  
From these circumstances colleCtively, two im­  
portant inferences are to be drawn ; one, that  
there is always a higher probability of a favorable  
balance of trade, in regard to countries, in which  
manufactures founded on the basis of a thriving  
agriculture flourifh, than in regard to those, which  
are confined wholly or almeft wholly to agricul­  
ture ; the other (which is also a confequenceof the  
firft) that countries of the former description are  
likely to pofiefs more pecuniary wealth, or room**  
than ihofc of the latter

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

Fa&amp;s appear to correfpon.i with thisconcltUion.  
The importations of manufactured supplies feerr  
invariably to drain the merely agricultural peopli  
of their wealth. Let the situation of the manu­  
facturing countries of Europe be compared in thi:  
particular, with that of countries which only cul  
tivate, and the disparity will be striking. Othe  
causes, it is true, help to account lor this difpari  
ty between foine of them ; and among these causes  
the relative state of agriculture j but between o  
thersof them, themo ft promhasnt circumftasice o  
•&lt;Jiflimi 1 itude arises fiorn the comparative state o  
manufactures. In corroboration of the fame idea  
it ought not to escape remark, that the Weft-In  
dia ifiands, the foils of which are tht most fertile  
and the nation, which in the greatest degree sup  
plies the reft of the world with the pitcious me  
tals, exchange to a loss with aimoft every othe  
country.  
As far as experience at home may guide, it wii  
lead to the fame conclusion. Previous to the Re  
volution, the quantit) of coin, possessed by the co  
Innies, which now compose the United States, ap  
peared to be inadequate to their circulation j an&lt;  
their debt to Great-Britain was progreflive. Sinci  
the Revolution, the dates, in which manufacture  
have most encreafed, have recovered fafteft fron  
the injuries of the late war j and abound most ir  
pecuniary resources.  
It ought to be admitted, however, in this as ir  
the preceding cafe, thac causes irrelative to th&lt;  
state of manufactures account, in a degree, so  
thephenomena remarked. The continual progref  
of new settlements has a natural tendency to oc  
caiion an unfavorable balance of trade j thougl  
it indemnifies for the inconvenience, by that en  
crease of the national capital which flows from thi  
converlion of waste into improved lands : ant  
the different degrees of external commerce, whicl  
are carried on by the different states, may maki  
material differences in the comparative state o  
their wealth. The firft circumfta/ice has referenci  
to the deficiency of coin and the encreafe of deb  
previous to the revolution ; the last to the advan  
tages which the most manufacturing states appea  
to have enjoyed, over the oihers, fmce the termi  
nation of the late war.  
But the uniform appearance of an abundance o  
specie, as the concomitant of a flourishing state o  
manufactures, and of the reverse, where they d&lt;  
not prevail, afford a strong presumption of thei  
favorable operation upon the wealth of a country.  
Not only the wealth but the independence an&lt;  
security of a country, appear to be materially con  
ncCted with the prosperity of manufactures. Eve  
ry nation, with a view to tnofe great objeCts  
ought to endeavor to possess within itfelf all thi  
efl&#x27;entials of national supply. These comprise thi  
means of Jubfijience, habitation, cloathing, and de­  
fence.  
The pofiefiion of these is necelTary to the perfec  
tion of the body politic, to the fafety as well as t&lt;  
the welfare of the society ; the want of either, i  
the want of an important organ of political life an&lt;  
motion ; and in the various crises which await ;  
state, it must severely feel the effeCts of any fuel  
deficiency. The extreme embarrassments of th&lt;  
United States during the late war, from an inca  
pacity of supplying themselves, are Hill matter o  
keen recoll&#x27;Ction : a future war might beexpeCte&lt;  
again to exemplify the mifchiefs and dangers of;  
situation, to which that incapacity is still in to&lt;  
great a degree applicable, unless changed by time  
-ly and vigorous exertions. To effeCt this change  
a3 fait as (hall be prudent, merits all the attentioi  
and all the zeal of our public councils j &#x27;tis th  
next great work to be accompliflied.  
The want of a navy to proteCt our external com  
merce, as long as it ihall continue, must render i  
a peculiarly precarious reliance, for the supply o  
cflential articles, and must serve to strengthen pro  
digioufly the arguments in favor of manufaCtuies  
To these general considerations are added fom&gt;  
of a more particular nature.  
Our distance from Europe, the great fountaii  
of manufactured supply, subjeCts us in the exist  
ing state of things, to inconvenience and loss in twi  
ways.  
The bulkinefs of those commodities which ar  
the chief productions of the foil, necefiarily im  
poses very heavy charges on their transportation  
to distant markets. These charges, in the cases  
in which the nations, to whom our produCts an  
sent, maintain a competition in the supply ef thei  
own markets, principally fall upon us, and forn  
material deductions from the primitive value o  
the articles furniflied. The charges on manufac  
tured supplies, brought from Europe are great);  
enhanced by the fame circumstance of distance  
These charges, again, in the cases in which ou  
cwn|induftry maintains no competition, in our owi  
markets, also principally fall upon us j and are aj  
additional cause of extraordinary deduction fron  
the primitive value of our own produCts j these be  
ing the materials of exchange for the foreign fa  
brics, which we conl&#x27;ume.  
The equality and moderation of individual pro  
perty, and the growing settlements of new dif  
triCfcs, occasion, in this country an unusual de­  
mand for coarse manufactures j the charges o  
which being greater in proportion to their greatei  
bulk, augment the disadvantage, which has beer  
just defcrit. 1.  
As in most countries dom°4ic supplies maintaii  
a very considerable compet- on with such foreigr  
productions of the foil, as *re imported for sale  
if the extensive eftabli/hment of manufactories ir  
the United States does not create a similar compe­  
tition in respeCt to manufactured articles, it ap­  
pears to be clearly deducible, from the confidera  
tions which have been mentioned, that they muf  
sustain a double loss in their exchanges with so  
reign nations 5 strongly conducive to an unfavora­  
ble balance of trade, and very prejudicial to thei;  
interests.  
These disadvantages press with no fmalf weight,  
on the landed interest of the country. In feafoni  
of peace, they cause a serious deduction from.tlx  
intrinsic value of the produCts of the foil. In tlx  
time of a war, which ihould either involve our­  
selves, or another nation, pofTefitng a considerable  
ill are of our csfrrting trade, the charges on the  
transportation of our commodities, bulky as moll  
of them are, could hardly fail to prove a grievous  
•burthen to the farmer j while obliged to depend  
in so degree as he now does, upon foroigr  
markets&#x27; for the vsnt of the surplus of his labor.  
  
As far as the prosperity of the frfreries of the  
United States is impeded by the want of an ade­  
quate market, there arises another special real on  
sol cicfiring the extension of manuh&gt;Ctures. !&gt;e­  
fides the filh, which in many places, would be  
likely to make a part of the subsistence of the per­  
sons employed 5 it is known that the oils, bonr:  
and /kins of marine animals, arc of extensive uf&lt;  
in various manufacture*. Hence the ptofpeCt ol  
an additional demand for the produce of the fish­  
eries.  
One more point of view only remains, in which  
to consider the expediency of encouraging manu­  
factures in the United States.  
Jt is not uncommon to meet with an opinion,  
that though the promoting of manufactures, may  
be the inter eft of a part of the ifoion, it is contra­  
ry to that of another part. The northern and  
foothern regions are sometimes represented as ha­  
ving adverse interest? in this refpeCt. Those are  
called manufaCtui ing, these agricultural dates,  
and a species of oppoirtion is imagined to fubfin  
between the manufacturing and agricultural in­  
terejls.  
This idea of an opposition between those two in­  
tereft® is the common error of the early periods 0/  
every country, but experience gradually difiipates  
it. Indeed they are perceived so often to luccour  
and to befriend each other, that they come at  
length to be conli-dered as one ; a supposition  
which has been frequently abused, and is nor uni­  
versally true. Particular encouragements of par­  
ticular manufactures may be of a nature to facri­  
fice the interests of landholders to those of minu  
faCturers j but it is nevertheless a maxim well  
eftabli/hed by experience, and generally acknow­  
ledged, where there has been futficient experi- ice,  
that the aggr&#x27;gatc prosperity of manufacture? and  
the aggregate prosperity of agriculture are Ulti­  
mately connected. In the course of the difc&lt; fion  
which has had place, various weighty cons ora­  
tions have been adduced operating in fupp tol  
that maxim. Perhaps the superior fteadin ol  
the demand of a domestic maiket for the 1&lt; &gt;lu&lt;  
produce of the foil, is alone a convincing gu­  
ment of its truth.  
Ideas of a contrariety of interests betwee the  
northern and fo-uthern regions of the union are  
in the main as unfounded as they are miichie? jui.  
The circumstances, on which such con­  
trariety is ul&#x27;ually predicated, authorises a direCtl)  
contrary conclulion. Mutual wantsconfticute one 01  
the strongest links &#x27;eft* political connection, and the  
extent of these bears a natural proportion to th&lt;  
diversity in the means of mutual supply.  
Suggestions of an opposite complexion are evei  
to be deplored, as unfriendly to the steady purfuil  
of one great common cause, and to the perfeCt har­  
mony of ail the parts.  
In proportion as the mind is accustomed tc  
trace the intimate connexion of interest, which  
fublifts between all the parts of a society, united  
under the fame government ; the infinite variety  
of channels which serve to circulate the profpeiky  
of each to and through the reft, in that propor­  
tion will it be little apt to be disturbed by folici­  
tuues and apprehensions which originate in Joca!  
discriminations. It is a truth as important, ai ii  
is agreeable, and one to which it is not easy to  
imagine exceptions, that every thing tending tc  
eftabli.&#x27;h Jubfiarrial and fetmanent ord.it•, jr. *  
fairs of a country, to encreafe t|ie total mals of in­  
dustry and opulence, is ultimately beneficial t*  
every part of it. On the credit of this greai  
truth, an acquiescence may lately be accorded  
from every quarter, to all institutions, and ar­  
rangements, which proniife a confirmation ol  
public order, and an augmentation of national re.  
source.  
But there are more particular confederation!  
which fervfe to fortify the idea, that the encourage­  
ment of manufactures is the interest of all parts 0!  
the union. If the northern and middle state:  
ihould be the principal scenes of such eftabliih­  
ments, they would immediately benefit the mori  
southern, by creating a demand for productions  
some of which they have in common with tin  
other states, and others of which either are peculiai  
to them, or more abundant, or of better qoality  
than elsewhere. These productions, principal!}  
are timber, flax, hemp, cotton, wool, raw silk, in  
digo, iron, lead, furs, hides, /kins and coals 9 o  
these articles cotton and indigo are peculiar 4o the  
southern states $ as are hitherto lead and coak, flax  
and hemp are or may be raised in greater |bun­  
dance there, than in the more northern flftes 1  
and the wool of Virginia is said to be of sjetiei  
quality than that of any other state j a cirirum­  
ftance rendered the more probable by the refl|.3io&quot;  
that Virginia embraces the fame latitudes wijh the  
fineft wool countries of Europe. The climite 01  
the south is also better adapted to the prodtKtior  
of silk.  
The extensive cultivation of cotton can perhap*  
hardly be expe&amp;ed, but from the previous efta­  
bli/hment of domestic manufactories of the article :  
and the surest encouragement and vent, fcr thf  
Dthers, would result from similar eftabli/hments in  
■efpeCt to them.  
If, then, it fatisfaftorily appears, that it is the  
interest of the United States, generally, to encou­  
rage manufactures, it merits particular attention,  
that theie are circumstances which render the pre­  
sent a critical moment for entering with zeai up­  
[&gt;n the important bufineCs. The effort cannot fail  
to be materially feconAed by a considerable and  
increasing influx of money, in consequence cf fo­  
reign (peculations in the funds—and by the disor­  
ders which exist in different parts of Europe.  
The firft circumftanCe&#x27; not only facilitates the  
execution of manufa&amp;ui ing enterprises : but •.in­  
dicates them as a neceflary mean to turn the &#x27;h&#x27;.ng  
itfelf to advantage, and to prevent its being even­  
tually an evil. If ul&#x27;eful employment be not found  
for the money of foreigners brought to the coun­  
try to be inverted in purchases of the public debt,  
it will quickly be re-exported to defray the ex ■  
pence of an extraordinary consumption of foreign  
luxuries j and diftrefling drains of our specie may  
hereafter be experienced to pay the interest and  
redeem the principal of the purchased debt.  
This ufeful employment too ought to be of a  
nature to produce solid and permanent improve­  
ments. If the money merely serves to give a tem­  
porary spring to foreign commerce 5 as it cannot  
procure new and &quot;:ng outlets for the products of  
the country ; there will be. no ical or durable ad­  
  
vantage ga&#x27;r.ed. As far as it fliall fiad its wav in  
agricultural ameliorations, in opening canals, and  
in fimiiar improvements, it will be productive of  
fubftaniial utili y. But there is reason to boubt,  
whether in such channels it is likely to find fuffici­  
ent employment, and (tiil more whether many ofj  
thole who pofi&#x27;efs it, would be as readily attracted  
to obiects of this nature, as to manufaCturing pur­  
suits j which bear greater analogy to th &gt;fe to  
tWiich they are aCCustomed, and to the i\ i 1: gen  
erated by them.  
To open the one field, as well as the other, vl  
at least secure a better prospeCt of ufeful employ­  
ment, for whatever accession of money there   
been or may be.  
There is at the present juncture a certain fer­  
mentation of mind, a certain activity of foecula­  
cion and enterprise, which if properly directed  
may be made subservient to ufeful purposes j but  
which if left entirely to itfelf, may be attendee  
with pernicious effects.  
The disturbed state of Europe, inclining its citi­  
zens to emigration, the requisite workmen will be

ployment to those who emigrate, may be an en­  
:reafe of the number and extent of valuable ac­  
quisitions to&#x27;the population, arts and induttry oi  
the country*  
Tdfind pleasure in the calamities of other nati­  
ons would be criminal j but to benefit ourfrlves,  
L&gt;y opening an asylum to t-hofc who fufFer, in con­  
lequence of them, is as justifiable as it is po­  
litic.  
A full view having now been taken of the in­  
ducements to the promotion of manufactures in  
the United States, accompanied with an examina­  
tion of the principal objections which are com­  
monly urged in oppojition, it is proper in the next  
place to confide* the means by which it may be  
effected, as introductory to a fpecifieation of the  
objeCts which in the present ft2te of things appear  
the moll fit to be encouraged, and of the particu­  
lar measures which it may be advifeable to adopt,  
ki respeCt to each.  
Jn order to a better judgment of the means  
proper to be resorted to by the United States, it  
will be of use to advert to thole which have been  
employed with success in other countries. The  
principal of these are—  
I. Prote&amp;tr.g duties—or duties on tbofe foreign  
articles vub&#x27;uh a*e the rival: of the domejlic ones in­  
tended to be cnccuraged.  
Duties of this nature evidently amount to a vir­  
tual bounty on the domestic fabrics, since by en­  
hancing the charges on foreign articles, they ena­  
ble the national manufacturers to under fell all  
their foreign competitors. T.hc propriety of tnis  
fpeciesof encouragement need not be dwelt upon j  
as it is not only a clear result from the numerous  
topics which have been fugpefted, but is fanCti  
oned by the laws of the Unifd States, in a variety  
of instances J it has the additional recommendati­  
on of being a refour.ee of revenue—lndeed all the  
duties imposed on imported articles, though with  
an exclusive view to revenue, have the efFeCl in  
contemplation, and except where they fall on raw  
materials wear a beneficent afpeCl towards the  
manufactures cf the country.  
11. Prohibitions of rival articles, or duties equi­  
valent to prohibition  
This is another and sn efficacious means of en­  
couraging national manufactures, but in general  
it is only fit to be employed when a manufacture  
has made such a progress, and is in so many hands  
as to ensure a due competition, and an adequate  
supply on reasonable terms—Of duties equivalent  
tcrprohibitions, there are examples in the laws of  
the United States, and there are other cases to  
which the principle may be advantageouily extend­  
ed, but they are not numerous.  
Considering a monopoly of the domestic market  
to its own manufacturers as the reigning policy of  
manufacturing nations, a fimiiar policy on the  
part of the United States in every proper instance,  
is dictated, it almost be fa id, by the princi­  
ples of diftri&#x27;outive justice } certainly by the duty  
of endeavoring to secure to their own citizens a re­  
ciprocity of advantages.  
111. Prohibitions of the exportation of the mate­  
rials of manufactures*  
The desire of securing a cheap and plentiful  
supply for the national workmen, and, where the  
article is either peculiar to the country, or of pecu­  
liar quality there, the jealousy of enabling foreign  
workmen to rival those of the nation, wirh its own  
materials, are the leading motives to this fpecres  
of regulation. It ought not to be affirmed, that  
it is in no instance proper; but it is certainly one  
which ought to be adopted with great circumipcc­  
tion, and only in very plain cafe*. It is seen at  
once, that i immediate operation, is to abridge  
the demand and keep down the price of the pro­  
duce of some other branch of induftrv. general!)  
speaking, of agriculture, to the prejudice of those  
who carry it on ; and though if it be really efTen­  
tial to the prosperity of any very important nation­  
al manufacture, it may happen that those who are  
injured in the firft instance, may he eventually  
indemnified, by the fu peri or steadiness of an ex­  
tensive domestic market oe-pending on that pros­  
perity : yet in a matter, in which there is so much  
room for nice and difficult combinations, in which  
such opposite confidrrations combat each other,  
prudence seems to dictate, thzt the expedient in  
tjueftion, ought to be indulged with a Iparing  
hand.  
IV. Pecuniary bounties*  
This has been found one of the most efficacious  
means of encouraging manufactures, and it is, in  
some views, the best- Though it has not yet been  
praCtised upon by the government of the United  
States (unless the allowance on the exportation of  
dried and pickled fifli and salted meat could be  
confidcred as a bounty) and though it is less fa­  
vored by public opinion than some other modes—  
Its advantages are these—  
1. It is a species of encouragement more positive  
and direCt than any ether, and for that very reason,  
lias a more immediate tendency to ftimulat; and  
uphold new enterprises, encreafing the chances of  
jrofit, and diminishing the risks oflofs, in the firft  
attempts.  
2. It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary  
  
augmentation of price, which I* Inc! r* fomfl  
ather modes, or it produces it to a -*fs degree j  
either by making no addition to the charges on  
the rival foreign article, as in the cafe of protect­  
ing duties, or by making a fma-ller addition. The  
ririt happens when the fund for rhe bonoty is de­  
rived from a different objeCV (which may or may  
not encreafe the price of some other article, ac­  
cording to the nature of that object J the second,  
when the fund is derived from the fame or a si mi -  
lar object of foreign manufacture. One per cent,  
duty on the foreign article converted into a boun­  
ty on the domestic, will have an equal efreCt with  
a duty of two per cent, exciofive of such bounty ;  
and the price of the foreign commodity is liable  
to be railed, in the one cafe, in the proportion of  
one per cent, in the other, in that of two per cent.  
Indeed the bounty when drawn from another  
source is calculated to promote a reduction of  
price ; because without laying any new charge on  
the foreign article, it serves to introduce a compe­  
tition with jr, and to encreafe the total quantity of  
the article in the market.  
3. Bounties have not like high protcCHng du­  
ties, a tendency to produce Icarcity. An encreafe  
of price is not always the immediate, though,  
where the progress of a domestic manufacture doe«  
not counteract a ri-fe, it is commonly the ultimate  
effcCt of an additional duty. In the interval, be­  
tween the laying of the duty and a proportional en­  
bltrafe of price, it may discourage importation, by  
interfering with the profits to be expeCted from the  
sale of the article.  
4. Bounties are sometimes not only the best,  
but the only proper expedient, for uniting the en­  
couragement of a new objeCt of agriculture, with  
that of a new objeCt, of manufacture. It is the in­  
terest of the farmer to have the production of the  
raw material promoted, by counteracting the in­  
terference of the foreign material of the fame  
kind—lt is the interest of the manufacturer to  
have the material abundant and cheap. If prior  
to the domestic production of the material, in fuf­  
ficient quantity, to supply the manufacturer on  
good terms, a duty be laid upon the importation  
of it from abroad, with a view to promote the rai­  
sing of it at home, the interest both of the farmer  
and manufacturer will be dii-erved—By either de­  
stroying the requisite supply, or railing the price  
of the article, beyond what can be afforded to be  
given fpr it, by the conductor of an infant manu­  
facture, it is abandoned or fails, and there being  
no domestic manufactories to create a demand for  
the raw material, which is raised by the farmer,  
it is in vain, that the competition of the like fo­  
reign article, may have been destroyed.  
It cannot elcape notice, that a duty upon tie  
importation of an article can no otherwise aid the  
domestic production of it, than by giving the lat­  
ter greater advantages in the home market. It  
can have no influence upon the advantageous sale  
of the article produced, in foreign markets ;no  
tendency, therefore, to promote its» exportation.  
The true way to conciliate these two intcrefts,  
is to lay a duty on foreign manufactures of the  
material, the growth of which is defiied to be en­  
couraged, and to apply the produce of that duty  
by way of bounty, either upon the production of  
the material itfelf, or upon its manufacture at  
home,or upon both. In this disposition of the  
thing, the manufacturer commences his enterprise,  
under every advantage, which is attainable, as to  
quantity or price of the raw material : And the  
farmer, if the bounty be immediately to him, is  
enabled by it to enter into a fuccefsful competition  
with the foreign material ; If the bounty be to the  
manufacturer on so mucn of the domestic materi­  
al as he consumes, the operation is nearly the fame;  
he has E motive of interest to prefer the domestic  
commodity, if of equal quality, even at a higher  
price than the foreign, so long as the difference of  
price is any thing short of the bounty, which is al­  
lowed upon the article.  
Except the fi&#x27;mple and ordinary kinds of  
houfliold manufacture, or those for which there  
are very commanding local advantages,pecuniary  
bounties are in most cases indifpenfible to the  
introduflicm of a new branch. A flimulus  
and a support not less powerful and direel is,  
generally Ipeaking, eflential 10 the overcoming  
of the obstacles which arise from the competi­  
tions of superior (kill and maturity elsewhere.  
Bounties are especially cflential, in regard to ar­  
ticles, upon which those foreigners who have  
been accustomed to supply a country are in the  
practice of granting them.

TCI. The fact &#x27;itdtlr.g of tie tranff*rtation ef  
commodities.  
improvements favoring this objeCt intimately  
concern all the domeltic interests of a communi­  
ty ; but they may without impropriety be men­  
tioned as having an important relation to manu­  
factures. There is perhaps scarcely any thing,&#x27;  
which has been better calculated to assist the ma­  
nufaCtures of Great-Britain, than the ameliora­  
tions of the public roads of that kingdom, and rhe  
great which has been of late made in  
opening canals. Of the former, the United States  
stand much in need j for the latter they prel&#x27;ent  
uncommon facilities.  
The fymptomsof attention to the improvement  
of inland navigation, which have lately appeared  
in some quarters, mult fill with pleafur&#x27;e every  
brealt waim~d with a true zeal for the   
of the country. These examples, it is to be ho­  
ped, will stimulate the exertions of the government  
and citizens of every Hate. There can certainly  
fce no ohjeCt, more worthy of the cares of the lo­  
cal alrniniftrations ; and it were to be wished,  
that there was no doubt of the power of the natio­  
nal government to lend its direCt aid, on a com­  
prehensive plan. This is one of those improve­  
ments, which could be prolecuted with more effi­  
cacy by the whole, than by any part or parts of  
the Union. There are cases in which the general  
jnfereft will be in danger to be facrificed to the  
coliifion of some iuppofed local interests. Jea­  
)oufies,&#x27;in matters of this kind, are apt to exist,  
as th*&gt;y are apt to be erroneous.  
The following remarks are fafficifently judicious  
and pertinent to deserve a literal q-iotation :  
il Good roads, canals and navigable rivers, by di-  
Ttiiniihing the expcnce of carriage, put the remctt  
farts of a country more nearly upon a level with  
those. in the neighborhood of the town. They  
arc uton that account the greatest of all improve­  
ments. They encourage the cultivation of the re­  
mote, which must always be the most extensive  
circle of the country. They are advantageous tc  
the town, by breaking d vvn the monopoly ol  
the country in its neighborhood. They a e  
advantageous even to that part of the country.  
Though they introduce some rival commodities  
into the old market, thry open many new markets  
to its produce. Monopoly besides is a great enem&quot;  
to good management, which can never be univer­  
sally eftsblifhed, but in confequencc of shat free  
and universal competition, which forces every bo­  
dy to have recourse to it for the fake of felf de­  
fence. It is not more than fifty years ago that  
font? of the counties in the neighborhood of London  
petitioned the parliament again ft the extension oj  
the turn-pike roads, into the remoter counties. Those  
remoter counties, they pretended, from the cheapness  
(J labor, 70 uld be to fe I thei&quot; grajs and com  
cheaper in the London market, than themfelves&gt; ana  
they ivould thereby reduce their rents and ruin their  
cultivation. Their rents however have risen,  
and their cultivation has been improved, fincc  
that time.&quot;  
Specimens of a spirit, similar to that which go  
verr.ed the counties herefpoken of present them­  
selves too frequently, to the eye of an impartial  
observer, and render it a wish of patriotism that the  
body in this country, in whose councils a local or  
partial spirit is least likely to predominate, were  
at liberty to pursue and promote the general inter­  
est, in those instances, in which there might be  
danger of the interference of such a spirit.  
The foregoing are the principal of the means,  
by which the growth of manufactures is ordinari­  
ly promoted. It is, however, not merely necefia­  
ry, that the mcafures of government, which have  
a direCt view to manufactures, Ihould be calcula­  
te a Gift and protect them, but that those which  
tioly collaterally affeCt them, in the general course

f almofl every  
quality } and fuel the chief instrument in manu­  
facturing it, is both cheap and plenty.—This par­  
ticularly applies to charcoal ; but there are pro­  
ductive coal mines already in operation, and strong  
indications, that the material is to be found in  
abundance, in a variety of other places.  
The enquiries to which thefubjeCl of this report  
i as led have been answered, with proofs, that ma­  
nufactories of iron, though generally underflood to  
be extenfjvCj are far more 10 than is commonly lup»  
[&gt;ofed. The kinds, in which the greatest progress  
has been have been mentioned in another  
placc, and need not be repeated j but there is lit­  
tle doubt that every other kind, with due cultiva­  
tion, will rapidly succeed. it is worthy of remark  
that several of the particular trades, of which it is­  
the basis, are capable of being carried on without  
the aid of large capitals.  
iron works have very greatly encieafed in the  
United States, and are profecutea with mueh more  
advantage than formerly. The average price &quot;be­  
fore the revolution was about sixty-sour dollars  
per ton, atprefentit is about eighty ; a rife which  
is chiefly to be attributed to the encreafe of manu­  
factures of the material.  
The ft:li further extenSon and multiplication  
of such manufactures will have the double effett  
of promoting the extraction of the metal itfeif, and  
of converting it to a greater number of profitable  
purposes.  
Those manufactures too unite in a greater de­  
gree, than almost any othertf, the several requi­  
sites, which have been mentioned, as proper to be  
consulted in the fcieclion of oDjeCtff.  
The only further encouragement of manufacto­  
ries of this the propriety of which may pe  
Confidsred as unqueitionable, I&#x27;eems to be an en­  
creafe of the duties on foreign rival commodities.  
Steel is a branch which has already made a  
considerable progress, and it is ascertained that  
some new enterprises, on a more extensive kale,  
have been lately let on foot. The facility of car­  
rying it to an extent, which will Jupply all inter­  
nal demand, and furnifh a considerable lurplus for  
exportation cannot be doubted. The duty upon  
the importation of this article, which is at present  
feventy-five cent? per cwt. mav, it is conceived,  
be fafely and advantageoully extended to ico  
cents. It is defirahle, by decisive arrangements,  
to second the efforts, which arc making in so very  
valuable a branch.  
The United States already in a great measure  
supply themselves with nails and spikes. They  
are able, and ought certainly to do it entirely. The  
firft and most laborious operation, in this manu­  
facture, is performed by water-millr. j and of the  
persons afterwards employed a great proportion arc­  
oovs, whose eari) habits of indufrry are of impor­  
tance to the community, to the present support  
of their families, and to their own future com  
fort. It is not less curious than true, that in cer­  
tain parts of the country, the making of nails is  
an occasional family manufacture.  
The expediency of an additional duty on tJieft  
articles is indicated by an important faCt. About  
1,890,000 pounds of them were imported into th&#x27;  
United States in the course of a year, ending- tht  
30th of Sept. 1790. A duty of. two cents pei  
pound would, it is presumable, (peeJily put anend  
to so considerable an importation. And it is ir:  
every view proper that an end should be put to it.  
The manufacture of these articles, like that o!  
Lome others, fuflfersYrom the carelelTnefs and dif ]  
honesty of a part of those who carry it on, Anj  
;nfpeCtion in certain cases might tend to correCt&#x27;  
the evil. It will i.eferve confiderarion whether aj  
regulation of this fort cannot be applied, without  
incon vcnience, to the exportation of the articled  
either to foreign countries, or from one state to a­  
nother.  
The implements of husbandry are made in  
lev eral states in great abundance. In many place.1  
it is done by the common blacksmiths. Anc  
there is no doubt that an ample supply for the  
whole country can with great ease be procured  
among ourfeives.  
Various kinds of edged tools for the use of me­  
chanics are also made ; and a considerable quanti­  
ty of hollow wares ; though the business of cart­  
ings has not yet&quot; attained the perfection which  
  
might be wifiied. It is however Improving, anij  
as there are respeCtable capitals in good hands,  
embarked in the prosecution of those branches of  
iron manufactories, which are yet in their infan­  
cy, they may all be contemplated as objeCts not  
difficult to be acquired.  
To ensure the qnd, it seems equally fafe anc!  
rudent to extend the duty ad valorem upon al.  
manufactures of iron, or of which iron is the ar­  
ticle of chief value, to ten per cent.  
Fire arms and other military weapons may it i:  
conceived, be placed without inconvenience in thi  
clals of articles rated at fifteen per cent. Then  
exilt already manufactories of these articles, w&#x27;nicf  
only require the stimulus of a certain demand t&lt;  
render them adequate to the supply of the Unitei  
States.  
It would also be a material aid to mannfaCtorie  
of this nature, as well as a mean of public fecun  
ty, if provilion should be made for an annual pur  
chafe of military weapons, of home manufaCtur  
to a certain determinate extent, in order to thi  
formation of arsenals j and to replace from tim  
to time such as should be withdrawn for use, so a  
always to have in store the quantity of each kind  
which should be deemed a competent supply.  
But it may hereafter deserve legillative confi  
deration, whether of all the necef  
(ary weapons of war ought not to be eltabiifhed  
on account of government itfelf. S-ich eftabiiih  
ments are agreeable to the usual practice of nu  
:10ns, and that praCtice ieems founded on fuflicien  
rcafon.  
There appears to be an improvidence, in leav  
ing these elfential instruments of national de  
rence to the casual peculations of individual ad  
venture ; a resource which canlels be relied upon  
in this cale than in mod others 5 the articles ii  
quertion not being objects of ordinary and indif  
penfable private consumption or use. As a gener  
al rule, manufactories on the immediate accoun  
of government are to be avoided j but this seem  
to be one of the few exceptions, which that ru&gt;&lt;  
admits, depending on very special reasons.  
Manufactures of steel, generally, or of whici  
steel is the article of chief value, may with advan  
cage be placed in the clals of goods rated at fevej  
ana an half per cent. As manufactures of thi  
kind have not yet made any considerable progress  
t is a reason for nut rating them as as t&#x27;nof&lt;  
&gt;f iron ; but as this material is the basis of them  
ind as their extenfjon is not less practicable, thai  
mportanr, it is deferable to promote it by a some  
vhat higher duty than the present.  
A question arises, how far it might be expedien  
o permit the importation of iron in pigs and bar  
ree from duty. It would certainly be favorabii  
o manufacturers of the article ; but the doubt i  
vhether it might not interfere with its produc  
ion.  
Two circumstances, however, abate if they d&lt;  
lot remove apprehension, on this score ; one is  
he considerable encreafe of price, which has beer  
ilready remarked, and which renders it probabli  
hat the free admifilon of foreign iron would no  
&gt;e inconsistent with an adequate profit to the pro  
;rietors of iron works ; the other is, the augmen  
a:ion of demand, which would be likely to atten&lt;  
:nc encreale of manufactures of the article, ir  
:onlequence of the additional encouragements pro  
)o!ed to be given. But caution nevertheless in «  
natter of this kind is mod advisable. The mea­  
ure fuggefled ought perhaps rather to be contem  
tlated, lubjeCt t;&gt; the lights of further experience  
han imoituiati iy adopted.  
COPPER.  
The rr:anufailures of which this article is fuf  
:t.{&gt;tible are also of great extent and utility. Un­  
ier Xliis ciefcription, those of brass, of which it i:  
:he principal ingredient, are intended to be in  
C 1 ud-rd *  
The material is a natural production of thi  
:ountry. Mines of copper have aCtually beer  
vroiight, and with profit to th- undertakers  
hough it is not known, that any are now in rhii  
:ondit»on. And nothing is easier, than the intro­  
luCtion of it, from other countries, on moderau  
:erms, and in great plenty.  
and brass founders, particularly  
he foimer, are numerous in the United States,  
rome of whom carry on business to a reTpcCta&#x27;uli  
sxtent.  
To multiply and extend manufactories of thi  
materials in question is woithv of attention ant  
effort. In order to this, it is desirable to facili  
rate a plentiful supply of the materials. And ;  
proper mean to this end is to place them in tin  
clals of free articles. Copper in plates and bras  
are already in this predicament j but copper ir  
pigs and bars is not j neither is iaph calamivaris  
which together with coppcr and charcoal, confti

out impropriety be mentioned  
amoDg the subjeCts ©f this report.  
  
A cop&quot;.-.!;? {•;pply of it would be of confe­  
quencc to tne iron branch : As an article of hou/e­  
---liold fuel alio ic is an interesting production ; the  
utility of which must encreafe in proportion to the  
of wood, by the progress of i&#x27;ettJeraent  
and cultivation. And its importance to naviga­  
tion, as an immenle article of tra.nfportation  
Lualt-wife, is signally exemplified in Great-Liri­  
tain.  
I is known, that there are several coal mines  
in Virginia, now worked, and appearances of their  
exigence are familiar in a number of places.  
The expediency of a bounty on all this species  
or coal of home production, and of premiums, on  
the opening of new mines, under certain qualifica­  
tions, appears to be worthy of particular examina­  
tion. &#x27;1 he great importance of the article will  
ampiv jufiify a reasonable expence in this way, if  
it (hall appear to be necefiary to, and ihail be  
thought likely to answer, the end.  
WOOD.  
Several manufactures of this article flourifli in  
the United Stales. Ships are no where in  
greater perfection, and cabinet wares, generally,  
are made little if at all inferior to those of Eu­  
rope. Their extent is such as to have admitted  
;&gt;f considerable exportation.  
An exemption from duty of the several kinds of  
&#x27;Vood orornarily used in these feetns  
obe all, that is req ui site, by way of encourage­  
rnent. Jc is recommended by the consideration of  
i fimiJar policy being pursued in other countries,  
ind by the expediency of giving equal advantages  
o our own workmen in wood. The abundance  
&gt;f timber proper for (hip building in the (Jniied  
States does no: appear to be any objection to it.  
rhe encreafing icarcity and the growing import  
:ance of that article, in the European countries,  
idmoniih the United States to commence, and  
y(tematically to pursue, measures for the prefer­  
/ation of their flock. Whatever may promote  
he reguiar eftabiiflrment of magazines of ihip  
iinber, is in various views defireable.  
SKINS.  
There are scarcely any manufactories of rrra-er  
mpwrtance, than of this article. Their direct  
«nd very happy influence upon agriculture, by pro­  
moting the railing of cattle of different kinds, is, a  
&#x27;ery material recummendation.  
It is plealing too, to observe the extensive nro­  
;rels they have made in their piincipal brandies j  
vhich are lo lar matured as almost to defy foreign  
ompetition. Tanneries in particular are not on­  
y carried on as a regular bufinels, in numerous  
nltances and in various parts of the country ;  
)ut they constitute in lome places a valuable  
tem of incidental family manufactures.  
Representations however have been made, ;m­  
---&gt;orting the expediency of further encouragement  
o the leather branch in two ways j one by en­  
reafing the duty on the manufactures of it, which  
ire imported ; the other by prohibiting the ex­  
&gt;ortation of bark. In support of the latter it is  
[Hedged, that the price of bark, chiefly in confe­  
rence of large exportations, has risen within a  
&quot;ew years from about three dollars to four dollars  
*ad a half per cord.  
These suggestions are submitted rather as into­  
nations, which merit considerations, than as mat­  
ers, the propriety of which is manifelt. It is  
ioc clear, rhat an encrrafe of duty is necefTary ;  
rnd in regard to the prohibition defiied, there is  
»o evidence of any considerable exportation hi­  
herto ; and&#x27;it is most probable, that whatever  
lugmentation of price may have taken place, is to  
&gt;e attributed to an extension of the home demand  
rom the encreafe of manufactures, and to a dc­  
reafe of the supply in consequence of rhe pro­  
ofs of fettlcment, rather than to the quantities  
vhich have been expoited.  
It is mentioned, however, as an additional rea­  
on for the prohibition, that one species of the  
&gt;ark usually exported is in some fort peculiar to  
he country, and rhe material of a very valuable  
Ive, of great use in some other manufaCtuies, in  
vhiih the United Scates have begun a compe­  
ition

FLAX and HEMP.  
Manufactures or&#x27; these articles have so muc!  
affinity to each other, and th/cy are so often Men  
ded, that they may with advantage be Confidere  
in conjunction. The importance fvf the linei  
branch io agriculture—its precious e&amp;&#x27;e&amp;a upoi  
houCiotd induftry—rhe ease, with which the mn  
Si/r: ,&#x27;iC .iVc L 1  
extent-—the great advances, which have been a 1  
ready -made, in the coarser fabrics of them, elpc  
cially in the family way, constitute claims, o  
peculiar force, to the pationage of government.  
This patronage may be afFurded in variou,  
wavs j by promoting the growth of the materials  
by encre3hng the impediments to an advantageou  
competition of rival foreign articles ; by direC  
bounties or premiums upan the bome manufac  
ture.  
Eirft. As to promoting the growth ef the ma  
tcrlaiu .  
Jn refpfcft to hemp, (omethinjj nas been ajrea  
dy done by the high c!ury upon foreign hemp. I  
the facilities for riomcftic production wore not un  
usually great, the policy of the duty, on the fo­  
reign raw material, would be highly queftionabic  
as interfering with the growth oi manufactures o  
it. Bat making the proper allowances for thof&lt;  
facilities, and with an eye to the future and ni  
tural progress of the country, the raeafure doe:  
not appear, upon the whole, exceptionable,  
A (trong wilh naturally suggests itfelf, tha  
some method could be deviied of affording a mori  
dired encouragement to the growth both of fla:  
and hemp j lucli as would be eftcctual, and a  
the fame time not attended with too great incon  
veniencies. To this end, bounties and premi  
umsrfjffer themselves to i•onjideraticn j but no rno  
dification of them has yet occurred which wjuh  
not either hazard too rnucli expence, or operati  
unequally inrefeience to the circumllances of&quot;dif  
ferent parts of (he Union ; and which woilJ no  
be attended with very great diliiculties in thi  
execution.  
Secondly. As to encreaßng thi impediments t  
an advantageous competition of rival foreign arti  
c/es.  
To this purpose, an augmentation of the duttr  
on importation is the obvious expedient ; which  
in regard to certain articles, appears to be recom  
mended by fufScient reasons.  
The principal of these articles is Sail-cloth :  
one intimately connected with navigation and de  
fence ; and of which a flourishing   
ls eftabl»{hed at* Boston, and very promising one1  
at several other places.  
It is presumed to be both fafe and advifeable tr  
place this in the class of articles rated at 10 pei  
cent. A strong reason for it relulfs from the con­  
iiderauoA that a &quot;bounty of two pence sterling pei  
ell is allowed, in Great-Britain, upon the ex­  
portation of the fail-cloth manufactured in that  
kingdom.  
It would likewlfe appear to be good policy tc  
raise the duty to 71-2 per cent, on the following  
articles. Drillings, ofnaburghs, ticklenburghs,  
dowlas, canvas, brown rolls, bagging, and upon  
all other linens the lirftcoft of which at the place  
of exportation does not cxcced 35 cents per yard.  
A boortty of 12 1-2 per cent, upon an average,  
on the exportation of such or similar linens from  
Great-Britain, encourages the manufacture ol  
them in that country, and cncrcafes the obstacle;  
to a fuccefsful competition, in the countries tc  
hich they arc fcnr.

COTTON.  
*t&quot;here is fomethlngin the texture of this mate  
r&#x27;uh which adapts it in a peculiar degree to the   
of machines. The signal utility ot th&lt;  
m *!•&#x27;for fuinning of cotton, not long lince invent  
ec &quot;a England, hae been noticed in another place  
b * *.!&gt;ere are other machines scarcely inferior i«  
uriity, which, in the difrerent manufactories o  
tins article are employed either excluSvely, or witl  
mKt than ordinary efFeCt. This very impottan  
ci recommends the fabrics of cotton, ii  
More particular manner, to a Country in .vhic 1  
a -JeCt of hjnds constitutes the greatest obftacl  
to^&#x27;nccefs.  
&quot;Fh* variety and extent of the uses to which th  
m.nufa«ftures of this article are applicable, is ano  
tk r powerful argument in their fa»vor.  
And the faculty of the United Stages roprodno

■a&#x27; ch though ailedged to be&#x27; inferior to some tha  
rudoced in other quarters,, is neverthfclefs capa

&lt;#tfceonent to the vigorous piirfuit o-6 the cottoj  
branch, in its Xeveral fubdivilions.  
Haw much has been already done has b.een fta&gt;te&lt;  
ii&gt; a preceding part of this report.  
In addltiofi to this, it may be announced-, that;  
society is foMning with a capital which Is expect  
«4 to be extended to at least half a million of dol  
on behalf of which measures are already ii  
train for prosecuting or&gt; a large scale, the makinj  
and printing of cotton goods.  
The lie ciicuniftances coaipire to indicate the-ex  
petliency of removing any o-bliruiiions which inaj  
r&gt;a^&gt;p«n to exist, to the advantageous profccutiOi  
of the manufactories in question, arvd of adding  
Tuch encouragements as may appear necefiary an&lt;  
proper.  
The present duty of three cent£ per pound on tlx  
foreign raw material, is undoubtedly a very feri­  
oos impediment to the progress of those manutac.  
: ories.  
The injurious tendency of f:milar duties, eithe:  
prior to the eftabliftiment, or in the infancy of thi  
iomeftic manufacture of the article, as it regard;  
the manufacture, and their worse than inutility  
in relation to the home production of the materia  
itfelf, have been anticipated, particularly in dif  
culling the fubje£t of pecuniary bounties.  
•Cotton has not the fame pretentions* with hemp  
to form an exception to the general rule.  
Not being, like homp, an universal produ&amp;io!  
of the country, it affords less aiFurance of an ade  
quate internal (upply ; hut the chief obj ftioi  
aiiles from the doubts, which afe entertained ion&#x27;  
cerning the quality of the national cotton. It i  
alledged, that the fibre of it is considerably (hort  
tr and weaker., than that of some other places  
and it has been observed as a general rule, that tin  
nearer the place of growth to the equator, trie bet  
u r the quality ai the c«t:on. That which come;  
I&#x27;lom Cayenne, Surinam and Demarara is said tc  
be preferable, even at a mateiial dilfetecce of price  
to the cotton of the Islands.  
While a hope may reasonably be indulged, thai  
with due care and attention the national cottor  
may be made to approach nearer than it now doe:  
to that of regions lomewhat more favored by cli­  
mate, and while fadts authorise an opinion, tha­  
very great use may be made of it, and that it is ;  
lefotuce which gives greater security to the cottor  
labrics of this country, than can be enjoyed by am  
which depends wholly on external supply, it wil  
certainly be wife, in every view, to let our infan  
manufactures have the full benefit of the best ma­  
terials on the cheapcft terms. It is obvious thai  
the necessity of having such materials is propor­  
tioned to the unfkilfulr.efs and inexperience of thi  
wotkmen employed, who, if inexpert, will not fai  
to commit great waste, where the materials the)  
are to work with are of an indifferent kind.  
To secure to the national manufactures so eilen­  
tial an advantage, a repeal of the present duty or  
imported cotton is indilpcnfable.  
A substitute for this, far more encouraging tc  
domeilic production, will be to grant a bounty or  
the national cotton, when wrought at a home ma­  
nufactory j to which a bounty on the export.itior

WOOL.  
In a country, the climate of whieh partakes of  
o confiderable-a proportion of winter as that ot a  
;r?aL partof the United States, the woollen branch  
:annot he regarded, as inferior to any, which re­  
ates to the cloathing of the inhabitants.  
HoufehoM manufactures of this material are  
:arried o:n, in different parts of the United States,,  
o a very interesting extent j but there is only onff  
)ia&gt;ncH, which, as a regular buiinefs, can be said  
o have acquired maturity. This is the making  
if hats.  
Hats of wool, and of wool mixed with fur, are  
nade in large quantities, in different states ; and  
-joining seems waiiting but an adequate supply of  
naterials, to render the manufacture commenfu­  
-ate with the demand.  
A promising essay, towards the fabrication of  
:loths, caflimcrs and other woollen goods, is like­  
wise going on at Hartford, in Connecticut. Spe­  
cimens of tbe different kinds which are made, in  
ilie poffefiion of the Secretary, evince that these  
fabrics have attained a very considerable degree of  
perfection. Their quality certainly surpasses any  
thing, that could have been looked for, in so fliort  
a time, and under so great disadvantages j and

have been at the command of the directors, to  
form the eulogium of that public spirit, perseve­  
rance and judgment, which have been able to ac­  
compli (h so much.  
To cherish and bring to maturity this precious  
embryo mull engage the most ardent wishes, and  
proportionable regret, as far as the means of doing

t ei&#x27;M-e c: improvement, as to render it fit for the  
finer fabrics.  
Premiums would probably be found the bef  
means of promoting thedomeftic, and bounties tlx  
foreign supply. The firft mav be within the com  
paf&gt; of the institution hereafter to be submitted  
The last would require a fpecific Jegiflative provi  
fir&gt;n. If any bounties are granted they ought o  
course to be adjusted with an eye to quality as wel  
as qnantity,  
A fund for this purpose may be derived fron  
the addition of i\ per cent, to the present rate o  
duty, on carpets and carpeting ; an increase, ti  
svhich the nature of the articles suggests no ob  
je&amp;ion, and which may at the fame time furniih  
motive the more to the fabrication of them a  
home; towards which some beginnings have beei  
made,  
SILK.  
The production of this article is attended wit!  
great facility iamoft parts of the United States  
Some pleasing *ffaye are making in ConneCticut  
as well towards that, as towards the manufaCtur  
cf what is produced. Stockings, handkerchiefs  
ribbons end buttons, are made, though as yet bu  
in small quantities.  
A manufactory of lace, upon a scale not ver  
extensive, has been long memorable at Ipswich ii  
the state of Maflachufetts.  
An exemption of the material from the duty  
which it now pays on importation, and premium  
upon the production, to be dispensed under the di  
reCtion of the institution before alluded to, seen  
to be the only species of encouragement advileabi  
at so early a stage of the thing.  
GLASS.  
The materials for making glass are found ever  
where. In the United States there is no deficien  
cy of them. The sands and stones called Tarfo  
which include flinty and chryftalline substance  
generally, and the salts of various plants, particu  
larly of the sea-weed kali or kelp constitute the ef  
fential ingredients. An extraordinary abundanc  
of fuel is a particular advantage enjoyed by thi  
country for such manufactures. They, however  
require large capitals and involve much manua  
labour.  
Different manufactories of glass are now on foo  
in the United States. The present duty of \z  
per cent, on all imported articles of glass amount  
to a considerable encouragement to those manufac  
tories. It any thing in addition is judged eligible  
the mod proper would appear to be a direct boun  
ty, on window glass and black bottles.  
The firft recommends itfelf as an objeCt of ge  
neral convenience ; the last adds to that character  
the circumft3Jice of being an important item ii  
breweries. A complaint is made of great defici  
ency in this refpeCt.  
GUN POWDER.  
No small progress has been of late made in th  
manufacture of this very important article : I  
may indeed be considered as already eftabliihed  
but its high importance renders its further exten  
iion very desirable.  
The encouragements, which it already enjoys  
are a duty of ten per cent, on the foreign rival ar  
ticle, and an exemption of falt-petre one of th  
principal ingredients of which it is composed  
from duty. A like exemption of sulphur, ano  
ther chief ingredient, would appear to be equall  
proper. No quantity of this article has yet beei  
produced, from internal fcurces. The use madi  
of it in finiihing the bottoms of {hips, is an addi  
lional inducement to placing it in the clafsof fre  
jjoods. Regulations for the careful inspeCtion o  
the article would have a favourable tendency.  
PAPER.  
Manufactories of paper are among those whic&#x27;  
are arrived at the greatest maturity in the Unite  
States, and are most adequate to national supply  
That of paper hangings is a branch, in which rei  
pcCtable progress has been made.  
Nothing material seems wanting to the furthe  
success of this valuable branch, which is alrea  
dy protected by a competent duty on similar im  
ported articles*  
In the enumeration of the several kinds, mad  
subjeCt to that duty, sheathing and cartridge pa  
per have been omitted. These, being the mol  
ftmple manufactures of the fort, and neceflary t  
military supply, as well as ship building, recom  
mend themselves equally with those of other de{  
criptions, to encouragement, and appear.to be a  
fully within the compass of dome(V»c exertions.  
PRINTED BOOKS.  
The great number of prefles difleminate  
throughout the Union, seem to afford an afiur  
ance, that there is no need of being indebted tc  
foreign countries for the printing of the book  
which are used in the United States. A duty q  
ten percent, instead of five, which is now charg  
ed upon the article, would have a tendency to ai&lt;  
the business. internally.  
It occurs, as an objeCtion to this, that it ma;  
have an unfavorable aspeCt towards literature, b;  
raising the prices of books in uoiverfal use, in pri  
vate families, schools and other seminaries o  
learning. But the difference, it is conceived  
would be without effeCt.  
As to books which usually fill the libraries o  
the wealthier clafies and of profefiional men, fuel  
an augmentation of price?, as might be occafionee  
by an additional duty of five per cent, would b&lt;  
too little felt to be an impediment to the acquiii­  
tion.  
And with regard to books which maybe speci­  
ally imported for the use of particular feminariej  
of learning, and of public libraries, a total exem­  
tion from duty would be advisable, which woulc  
r&lt;o far towards obviating the obje&amp;ion just men­  
rioned. They are now subjeCt to a duty of five  
per cent.  
As to the books .in most general family use, the  
confrancy and uaiverfality of the demand would  
  
ensure exeitTons to furnifii them at home, an»£ the  
means are completely adequate. It may alfo-.be  
expeCted ultimately, in this as in other cases, thai  
the extenlion of the domestic manufacture would  
conduce to the cheapness of the article.  
It ought not to pass unremarked, that to en­  
courage the printing of books is to cncourage the  
manufacture of paper.  
REFINED SUGARS and CHOCOLATE  
Are among the number of extensive and pVof­  
perous domestic manufactures.  
Drawbacks of the duties upon the materials, ol  
which they are refpeCtivelv made, in cases of ex­  
portation would have a beneficial influence upon  
the manufacture, and would conform to a prece­  
dent, which has been already furnifhed, in the in­  
stance of molasses, on the exportation of di(!il)e&lt;]  
spirits.  
Cocoa, the raw material now pays a duty of one  
cent per lb. while chocolate which is a pre­  
vailing and very simple manufacture, is comprised  
in the mass of articles rated at no more than five  
per cent.  
There would appear to be a propriety in en­  
couraging the manufacture, by a fomewbat high­  
er duty, on its foreign rival, than is paid on tlx  
raw materia). Two cents per lb. on importec  
chocolate would, it is presumed-, be without in­  
convenience.  
THE foregoing heads comprise the most impor­  
tant of the several kinds of manufaCtures, which  
have occurred as requiring, and, at the fame time  
as mod proper for public encouragement ; am  
such measures for affording if, as have appeared  
best calculated to anlwer the end, have been sug­  
gested.  
Th; observations, which have accompaniec  
this delineation of objeCts, supersede the neceffit;  
of many supplementary remarks. One or twi  
however may not be altogether fupeifluous.  
Bounties are in various instances proposed a  
one species of encouragement.  
It is a familiar objection to them, that they an  
difficult to be managed and liable to frauds.—  
But neither that difficulty nor this danger seem  
fufficiently great to countervail the advantages o  
which they are productive, when rightly applied  
And it is presumed to have been shewn, that the)  
are in some cases, particularly in the infancy o  
new enterprises, ir.difpenfabie.  
It will however be neceflary to guard with extrjt  
ordinary circumspeCtion, the manner of difpenfirvj  
them. The requisite precautions have bee»  
thought of; but to enter into the detail woulc  
swell this report, already voluminous, to a fjzi  
too inconvenient.  
If the principle fliall not be (teemed inadm&#x27;fiible  
the means of avoiding an abuse of it will not b&lt;  
likely to present insurmountable obstacles, Then  
are ufeful guides from praCtice in other quar  
ters.  
It fliall therefore only be remarked here, in re  
lation to this point, that any bounty&gt; which ma;  
be applied to the manufatture of an article, canno  
with latety extend beyond those manufactories  
at which the making of the article is a rtgn\a\
trade. It would be impoflible to annex adequate  
precautions to a benefit of that nature, if extend**  
to every private family, in which the manufaCtun  
was incidentally carried on, and its being a mere­  
ly incidental occupation which engages a portior  
of time that would otherwise be loft, ic can be ad­  
vantageoufty carried on, without so special ai  
aid.  
The poflibility of a diminution of the revenut  
may also present itfelf, as an objection ta the* ar­  
rangements, which have been fubmittedlk 4a*  
Butthere is no truth which may be more firm­  
ly relied upon, than that the interests of tire Ye  
venue are promoted, by whatever promotes an en­  
creafe of national ifiduftry and wealth.  
In proportion to the degree of these, is the ca  
pacity of every country to contribute to the publi&lt;  
treasury j and where the capacity to pay is en­  
creafed, or even is not decreased, the only confe­  
quencc of measures, which diminish any particu­  
lar resource, is a change of the objeCt. If by err*  
couraging the manufacture of an article at home,  
the revenue, which has been wont to accrue fiorr  
its importation, (hould be lefiened, an indemnifi­  
cation can eaftly be found, either out of the ma­  
nufacture itfelf,or from some other objeCt, whicl  
may be deemed more convenient.  
The measures however which have been sub­  
mitted, taken aggregately, will for a long time t&lt;  
come, rather augment than decrease the public  
revenue.  
There is little room to hope, that the progref;  
of manufactures will so equally keep pace wi{l  
the progress of population, as to prevent, even a  
gradual augmentation of the produCt of the dutie:  
on imported articles.  
As, nevertheless, an abolition in some inftancci:  
and a reduction in others of duties, which hay«  
been pledged for the public debt, is proposed, it 11  
eilerttial, that it flvbuld be accompanied with a  
competent substitute. In order to this, it is requi­  
site, that all the additional duties which fliall be  
laid, be appropriated in the firft instance, to   
place all defalcations, which may proceed from  
any such abolitron or diminution. It is evident,  
at fir ft glance, that they will not only be adequate  
to this, but will yield a considerable surplus. This  
surplus will serve,  
First. Taconftitute a fund for paying the  
bounties which Ilia 11 have been decreed.  
Secondly. To constitute a fund for the op­  
erations of a board, to be eftablifiied, for promot­  
ing arts, agriculture, manufactures and commerce.  
Of this institution, different intimations have  
been given, in the course of this report. An out­  
line of a plan for it {hall now be submitted.  
Let a certain annual sum, be set apart, anc  
placed under the management of comtiiifiionirrs,  
not less than three, to consist of certain officers oJ  
the government and their fucceifors in office.  
Let these commifHoners be empowered to apply  
the fund confided&quot;to them, to defray tbeexpcac­  
es of the emigration of artilis, and manufacturers  
in particular branches of extraordinary impor­  
tance—to induce tjtie proCecution and introducti­  
on of ufeful difcoteries, inventions and improve­  
ments, by proportionate rewards, j\)diciouHy hald  
out and applied—to encourage by premiums, po:h  
honorable and lucrative, the exertions of u»uivi  
duals, and of dalles, in relation to the feveaa! fcb­

m annual account of their .tranfattioAS and ci»T­  
,ti.-fements j and all such fares us ihall not have  
&gt;een applied lo the purposes of their trust, at the  
nd of three years, to revert to the treasury.  
r may also be enjoined upon them, not t© draw  
iK the sponey, but for the puipofc.of fomefpeci­  
ic dilburlemen t»  
It may morever be of ufc, to authorise them to  
eceive voluntary contributions j making it their  
uty to apply them to the particular objects foi  
vhich they may have been made, if any iha.l have  
►ecn designated by the donors.  
&#x27;there is reason to believe, that the progress or  
i articular ir.2nufaCtuies has been much retarded by  
hHwant ol fkiiful workmen. And it of en hap­  
»ens that the capitals employed are not equal to  
he purposes of bringing ftom abroad woikmen of  
i fupcrior kind. Here, in cases, worthy ol it, the  
i-jxiliary agency of government would in all prj­  
ubility be ufeful. There are a!fo valuable wOrk­  
nen , in every branch, who are prevented sum  
migrating foltly by the want of means. Occa­  
ional aids to such persons, properly &#x27; aciminiftcred,  
night be a fouice of valuable accuifKions to the  
ountry.  
The propriety 6f stimulating by rewards, the in­  
ention and introduction of lileful improvements,  
s admitted without difficulty. Out the fu.ee eis or  
ittempts in this way mult evidently depend much  
m the manner of conducting them. It is pro­  
&gt;able, that the placing of the gifyenfation of those  
ewards under some proper diicretionary divis­  
ion, where they may be accompanied by eiUnter­  
it expedients, will serve to give them the hw uit ef­  
kacy. it seems impracticable to apportion, by  
jeneral rules, fpecitic compensations for dileoVe­  
ries of unknown and disproportionate utility.  
The great use which may be made of a fund of  
his nature to procure and import foreign im­  
provements is particularly obvious. Among thefe.j  
he article of machines would form a mod impor­  
:ant item.  
The operation and utility of premiums have  
aeen adverted to j together with the advantages  
which haverefulted from their dispensation, un­  
ier the direction of certain public and. private lo­  
:ieties. Of this some experience has been had in  
he instance of the Pennsylvania society, for the  
promotion of manufactures and ufeful. aitsj. bul  
:he funds of that afiociarion have been too con­  
tracted to produce more than a very small portion  
jf the good to which the principles of it would  
bave led. It may confidently be affirmed that  
there is scarcely any thing, which has been devis­  
ed, better calculated to excite a general spirit ol  
improvement than the institutions of this nature.  
They are truly invaluable.

The foregoing fuggettions are not defigned to inculcate an opinion, that ma-  
pufaGiuring indultry is more prodeétive than that of agriculture, They are in-  
tenied rather to thow, ‘hat the reverfe of this propofition is not afcertained ;  
that the general arguments, which are brought.to eftablih it, are not fatisfa&amp;e-  
ry; and confequently, that a fuppofition of the fuperior produétivenefs of til-  
lage, ought to be no obitacle to jiftening to any fubftanrial ancucements to the  
encouragement of manutaftures, which may be otherwife perccaved to exift,  
through an apprebenfion, that they may have a tendency to divert labour froma  
more to a lefs profitable employment.  
  
It is extremely probable, that on a full and acourate developement of the  
matter, Ov the ground of fa&amp; and caleulation, it would be dileovergd that these  
is no materi | difference between the aggregate procutivenc&#x27;s of the one, and  
of the other kind of induftry ; and that the propriety of the encousagements,  
which may in any cafe he prope fed to be given to either, ovpght to be determine  
ed upon confiderations ielative to any comparifon of that nature.  
  
Il. But without contending for the fuperior produdtiveneis of manufa&amp;turing  
induftry, it may conduce to a better judgment of th pele., which o ght tobe  
purfued re(pefting its encouragement, to contemplate the fubjeét, under fome ad-  
ditional afpects, iending not only to confirm the idea, that this kind of indufry  
has been improperly reprefented as unprodugtive in itfeif ; but to evinee ip ad-  
dition, that the eftablifhment and diffufion of manutactues have the «Me&amp; of  
sevdering the total mals of uleful and preduétive labour, in a community, g: ea-  
ter than it would otherwile be. In profecuting this difcuffion, may be neccfa-  
ry, briefly to refume and review dome of the topics which have byen already  
touched.  
  
To afirm that the labour of the manufaflurer is unproduétive, becaufe he  
confumes as much of the produce of land, as he adds value to the raw materials  
which he manufa&amp;ure:, is not better founded, than it would he to affirm, that  
the labour of the farmer, which furnithes materials to the manutadiurer, is un-  
produdtive, becanfe he confumes an equal value of manufadluied arucies, Each  
furnifics a certaim portion of the produce of his labour to the other, and each  
deftioys a correfponJe:t portion of the produce of the labour of the other. Inthe  
mean tune, the maintenance of two cuizens, inftead of one, is going on; the  
Bate has two members inftead of one; and they together coniume twice the value  
of what is produced from the lan.  
  
If inftead of a farmer and artificer, there were a farmer only, he would be

ctures than in regard to country labourers , and while a careful coms  
parifon fhows, that there is, in this particular, much exaggeration ; it is alfo  
evident, that the effect of the degree of difparity which docs truly exilt, is di-  
minithed in proportion to the ufe which can be made of machinery.  
  
To illuftrate this laft idea—let it be fuppoled, that the difference of price, in  
two countries, of a given quantity of manual labour, r:equilit: to the fabrica-  
tion of a given article, is as ten; and that fome mechanic power is introduced  
into beth countries, which, performing half the neceflary labour, leaves only  
half to be done by hand, it is evident, that the difference in the coft of tre fa-  
brication of the article in queftion, in the two countries, as far it is connected  
with the price of labour, will be reduced from ten to five, in coniequence of the  
introduction of that power.  
  
This circumftance ts worthy of the moft particular attention. It diminifhes  
immenfely one of the objections, moft frenuoufly urged, againit the fuccets of  
manufactures in theganited fates.  
  
To procure all fuch machines as are known in any part of Europe, can only  
require a proper provifion and due pains. The knowledge of feveral ot the moit  
important of them is already poflefled. The preparation of them here, is, in moft  
cafes, practicable on neaily equal terms. As far as they depend on water, tome  
fuperiovity of advantages may be claimed, from the uncommon varicty and  
greater cheaprels of fituations adapted to mill feats, with which diffe:eut  
parts of the united ftates abound.  
  
So far as the dearnefs of labour may be a confequence of the greatnefs of  
profits in any branch of bufinefs, it is no obitacle to its fucecis. The undertuker  
can afford to pay the price.  
  
There are grounds to conclude that undertakers of manufaQtures in this  
country can, at this time, afford to pay higher wages to the workmen they may  
employ, than are paid to fimilar workmen in Europe. ‘The prices of foreign fa-  
brics, in the markets of the united ftates, which wil! for a long time regulate the  
prices of the domeftic ones, may be contidered as compounded of the following  
ingredients. The firft coft of materials, including the taxes, if any, which are  
paid upon them where they are made—the expenie of grounds, buiidings, ma-  
chinery and tools—the wages of the perions employed in the manutictory—ths  
profits on the capital er ftock employed—the commiffions of agents to purchafe  
them where they are made—the expen(e of tran{po:tation to the united fiates,  
including infurance and other incidental charges—the taxes or duties, if any,

omprifed in an enumera-  
tion of manufactories already eftabithed. There are other articles alfo of great  
importance, which, though, ttriétly peaking, manufaétures, are omitted, as be-  
ing immediately connected with hufbandry: fuch are flour, pot and pearl ath,  
pitch, tar, turpentine, and the like.  
  
There remains to be noticed an objeétion to the encouragement of manu-  
faftures, of a nature different from thofe which quettion the probability of fuc-  
cefs—this is derived from its fuppofed tendency to give a monopoly of advanta-  
ges to particular claffes, at the expenfe of the reft of the conramunity, who, it is  
affirmed, would be able to procure the requifite fupplies of manufactured arti-  
cles, on better terms from foreigners, than from our own citizens, and who, it  
is aileged, are reduced to a neceffity of paying an enhanced price for whate.  
ver they want, by every mesfure, which obitructs the free competition of fo.  
reign commodities.  
  
Itis not an unreafonable fuppofition, that meafures which ferve to abridge  
the free compeuition of foreign articles, have a tendency to occafion an enhance-  
ment of prices, and it is not to be denied, that duch is the effet of a number  
  
  
  
®  
  
Part 1.] Report of the f-cretary of the treafury tn manufaflures,  *2  
  
of cafes: but the faé&amp;t does not un:formly correfpond with the theory. A  
reduction of prices has, in feveral inftances, immediately fucceeded the eftab-  
lithment of a domeflic manufacture. Whether it be that foreign manufaétu-  
rers endeavour to {upplant, by underfelling our own, or whatever elie be the  
caufe, the effe&amp;l has been fuch as is ftated, and the reverie of what might have  
been expected.  
  
But though it were true, that the immediate and certain effe&amp; of regula-  
tions controuling the competition of foreign with domeftic fabrics, was an in.  
creafe of price, it is wniverfally true, that the contrary is the ultimate effeét  
with every fuccefsful manufaéture. When a domeftic manufaéiure has attained  
to perfe€lion, and has engaged in the profecution of it acompetent number  
of perfons, it invariably becomes cheaper. Being free from the heavy charges  
which attend the importation of foreign commodities, it can be afforded, and  
accordingly feldom or never fails to be fold cheaper, in procefs of time, than  
was the foreign article for which it is a fubftitute, The internal competition,  
whieh takes place, foon does away every thing like monopoly, and by degrees  
reduces the price of the article to the minimum of a reafonable profit on the  
capital employed. This accords with the reafon of the thing and with experi«  
ence.  
  
Whence it follows, that it is the intereft of the community, with a view to  
eventual and permanent economy, to encourage the growth of manufadtures,  
In a national view, a temporary enhancement of price muft always be well  
sompeniated by a permanent reduction of it.  
  
It is areflexion, which may with propriety be indulged here, that this even  
tual diminution of the prices of manufactured articles, which is the refult of  
internal manufacturing eftablithments, has a dire&amp;t and very important ten-  
dency to benefit agriculture. It enables the farmer to procure, with a finaller  
quantity of his labour, the manufaftured produce of which he ftands in need,  
and confequently increafes the value of his income and property.  
  
The objections, which are commonly made to the expediency of encouraging,  
and to the probability of fucceeding in manufa&amp;turing purfuits, in the united  
ftates, having now been difcuffed, the confiderations, which have appeared in  
the courfe of the difcufion, recommending that {pecies of induftry, to the pa-  
tronage of the government, will be materially ftrengthened by a few gere-  
ral and {ome particular topics, which have been naturally referved for fubie~  
guent notice.  
  
I. There feems to be a moral certainty that the trade of a country, which  
is both manufaturing and agricuitural, will be more lucrative and proiperous,  
than that of a country which is merely agricultural.  
  
One reafon for this is found in that general effort of nations (which has  
been already mentioned) to procure from their own foils, the articies of prime  
necefhity requifite te their own confumption and ule; and which leives to ren  
der their demand for a foreign fupply of fuch articles in a great degree occali-  
onal and contingent. Hence, while the neceffities of nations exciutively devoted  
to agriculture, for the fabrics of manufafturing tates, are conftant and regu-  
lar, the wants of the latter for the products of the former, are liable to very  
confiderable fluftuations

 finds ifeif indemnified, by the  
high prices of {ome articles, for the low prices of others—and the prompt and  
advantageous aie of thofe articles which are in demand enables its mere iants thie  
better to wait for a favourable change, in refpe&amp; to thofe which are not. There  
is ground to believe, theta difference of fitua:ion, in this particular, has im-  
menfely different cfs upon the wealth and profpe: itv of nttons.  
  
From thefe circumftances colle€tivily, two important inferences are to be drawn;  
one, that there isalwavs a hegher probability of a favourable balance of trade, in  
regard to countries, in which manufactures, founded on the bafis of a thriving  
agricu.ture, flourifi, than in regard to thofe, which are confined wholly or almoft  
wholly to ag iculture ; the other (which is alfo a confequence of the fir) that  
countries of the former defeription are likely to pofl:is more pecuniary wealth, or  
money, than thofe of the latter.  
  
Faéls appear to correfvon | with this conclufion. The importations of manu-  
foStured fupp ies feem invariably to drain the merely agriculturai people of their  
wealth. Let the fituation of the manufacturing countries of Europe be compar-  
ed in this particular, with that of countries which only cultivate, and the difpa-  
rity will be ftrikinz, Other caufes, it is true, help to account for this difparity  
between fome of them; and amorg thefe caules, the relstive ftate of agriculture ;  
but between others of them, the moft prominent circumftance of diffimilitude  
arifes from the com parative Rate of manutaGtures. In corroboration of the fame  
idea, it ought not to efeape remark, that the Weft India iflands, the fois of  
which are the moft fertile, and the nation, which in the greateft degree upplies  
the veft of the world, with the precious metals, exchange to a lofs with almott  
every cther country.  
  
As far as exnerience at home may guide, it will lead to the fame conclufon,  
Previous to the revolution, the quantity of coin, poffefled by the colonies, which  
now conipof2 the united ftates, appeared to be madequate to their circulation ;  
andthe rdehr to Great Britain was progreffive. Since the revolution, the ftates,  
in which manufagtuves have moft increafed, have recovered faite(t from the in-  
  
juries of the lote wa-, and abound mott in pecumary refources.  
  
It ought ‘o be aumitted, however, in this as in the preceding cafe, that caufes  
irrelative to the ftate of manufa€lures, account, in a degree, for the phenomena  
temarked. ‘The continual progreis of new fetuements has a natural tendency to

sa? Report of the fecrctary of the treafury on manufaflur es. (1796  
@omparatively fi-nder funds, their utility has been immenfe. Much has been  
dene by this man in G eat Britain: Scorland, in particular, owes mate: ially te  
it a prodigious amelioration of condition. From a fimi&#x27;ar efablifhment in the  
‘united Mates, fupplie’ and fupported by the government of the union, vatt bene-  
‘fits night reafona ly be expeted, Some further idess on this h a&#x27;, fla.) accord.  
ingly be fubmuitted in the concluficn of this report.  
  
VI. Tie exemption of the materials of manufaétures from duty.  
  
The pol.cy of tliat exemption, as a general ryi-, pai ticularly in reference to new  
eftablifhments, is obvious. It can haid&#x27;y ever be advf.ble to add the obitru@tions  
of fifcal burden: to the difficul:ies which naturaily eubarrafs a new manuf cture§  
and where it 16 matured «tid in condition to bee»me an o&#x27;ject of revenue, it is,  
generally fpe: iking, better that the fabric, than the materiul, fhould be the fub-  
ject of taxation. Ideas of propo.tion between the quantum of the tax and the.  
value of the article can be more eaftly adjitted i the former than in the latter  
eafe. An argument for ¢exem, tions of this kind inthe united ftates, is to be de-  
rived from the praé co, as far as their neceflities have permitted, of tuoie nutions  
whorn we are to mect as competitors in our own and in foveign markets.  
  
‘Thee are, however, exceptions to it; of which fome examples will be giver  
under the next head.  
  
The laws of the union affurd intonees of the obfervance of the policy here  
recommended ; but it will probably be found advifsble to extend it to fome other  
€ cs. Ota nature, bear ing fome affinity to that poiicy, is the regulation which  
exemp’s from duty the tocis and impiements, as weil as the books, clothes, and  
houfehold furniture of foreign artifts, who come to refide in the united ftates ;  
an acvantage already fecured to them by the laws of the union, and which, it is  
in eve y View, preper to continue.  
  
VII. Drawbacks of the dutics which are impofed on the materials of manw.  
fagtures.  
  
It has already heen obferve!, as a general rule, that duties on thofe maaterials  
ougit, with certain excep ions, to be forborne. Of thefe exceptions, three cates  
@ccur, which may ferve as exampl:s—one, where the material is itfelf an ob-  
je&amp; of general or extenfive confuinption, and a fit and produétive fource of re-  
Wenve another, where a manufaéture of a fimpler kind, the competition of  
which with a like domeitic article is’ defired to be reftrained, partakes of the  
nature of a :aw material, froin being capable by a farther procefs, to be con-  
verted mio a manufidture of a different kind, the introduction or growth of  
which is defired to be encouraged ; a third, where the material itfelf is a produc-  
tion of the country, and in fufficient abundance to furnifh a clicap and plentiful  
{apply tothe nanonal manufaéturers.  
  
Under the fi. ft defeription comes the article of melaffes. It is not only a fair  
obie&amp;of revenue, but being a iweet, it is jult that the confumers of it fhould  
pty a dutyas willas che confuners of fugar.  
  
Cottons and linen in their whfe ftate fall under the fecond defcription—-a duty  
upon fuch as are imported is pr per to promote the dometiic manufacture of fimi-  
lar articles inthe {ame flate—a drawback of that duty is proper to encourage  
the piinting and ftaining at home of thofe which are brought from abroad.  
When the firft of thefe manufactures has attained fufficient maturity in acoun-  
try, to furnith a full iuppily for the fecond, the utility of the drawback  
ceafes.  
  
The a:ticieof hemp either now does or may be expecied foon to exemplify the  
third cafe, in the united ftates,  
  
Where duties on the materials of manufaftures are not laid for the purrofe  
of preventing a comprtition with fome domeéttic produétion, the fame reaions  
which recommend, as a generai rule, the exemption of thole materials from

duties, would recommend, as alike general rule, the allowance of dsawbacks  
in favour of the manufaélurer : accordingly, fuch drawbacks are familiar  
in countries which fyftematically purfue the bufinels of nanufagtures 5 which  
furnithes an argument of the objervance of a fj nilar policy in the united ftates ;  
and the idea has been adopte! by the laws of the union,in the inflane-s of frit  
and melaffes. Jt is believed that it wiil be found adva:..ageous toextend it te Lume  
other articies.  
  
VIII. Theencouragement of new inyentions and difeoyeries, at home, and of  
the introduction into the united tates of fuch as may haye been mace in other  
countries ; particularly thofe which relate to mach:nery.  
  
This js among the moft uiefu) and unexceptionable of the aj.Js which can  
be given to manufaétures. Tie ufval means of that encouragement are pecuni-.  
ary rewards, and, for atime, exclufive privileges. ‘The ficit muf be enpioved,  
according to the occafion, and the utility of the invention or diicovery. For  
the laft, fo far as refpe&amp;ts “ authors and invent rs,” provifion has been made  
by law. But itis defirable, in regard to improvements and fecrets of extra  
ordinary value, to be able to extend the fanse benefit to introducers, as well as  
authors and inventors ; a policy which has been praétifed with advantage ig

on, is, in a vaft number of cafes, a very deceitful criterion of the profits which  
are made; yet it is, perhaps, the belt they can have, and it is the one.on which  
they will moft naturally rely. A bufineis, therefore, which may rather require  
ail, from the government, than be in a Capacity to be contributory to  
it, may find itfelf crufhed by the miftaken conjeStures, of the affetfors of

Arbitrary taxes, under which denomination are comprifed all thefe, that  
Jeavethe quantum of the tax to be railed on each perfon, to the difcretion of  
  
certain officers, are as contrary to the genius of liberty as to the maxims of

government, who have beftowed upon them the {everett epithets of reproba-  
tion ; as conftiiuting one of the worlt {catures ufually to be met with in the pt

These appears to be an improvidence in leaving thefe effential inftruments of  
national defence to the cafual fpeculations ef individual adventure ; a refource  
which can lefs be relied upon, in this cafe, than in moft others ; the articles  
in queftion not being objeéts of ordinary and indifpenfable private confumption  
er ule. Asa general rule, manufactories on the immediate account of govern.  
ment areto be avoided: but this feems to be one of the few exceptions, which  
that rule admits, depending on very fpecial reafons.  
  
Manufaétures of fteel, generally, or of which fteel is the article of chief value,  
fay with advantage be placed in the clals of goods rated at feven and an half  
per cent. As manufactures of this kind have not yet made any confiderable  
progrefs, it is a reafon for not rating them as high as thofe of iron ; but as  
‘this material is the bafisof them, and as their extenfion is not lefs praéticable,  
than important, itis defirable to promote it by a fomewhat higher duty than the  
prefent.  
  
A queftion arifes, how far it might be expedient to permit the im portation  
of iron in pigs and bars, free from duty. It would certainly be favourable to ma-  
nufaéturers of the article ; but the doubtis, whether it might not interfere with  
its produétion. :  
  
Two circumftances, however, abate, if they do not remove, apprehenfion  
on this fcore ; one is, the confiderable increafe of price, which has been already  
remarked, and which renders it probable, that the free admiflion of foreign  
iron would not be inconfiltent with aw adequate profit to the pi oprietors of iron  
works ; the other is, the augmentation of demand, which would be likely to  
attend the increafe of manufaétures of the article, in confequence of the addi-  
tional encouragenents propofed to be given. But cautiomp neverthelefs, in a  
matter of this kind, is moft advifable. The meafure fuggefted ought, perhaps,  
rather to be contemplated, fubjet to the lights of further experience, than im-  
mediately adopted.  
  
COPPER, The manufactures, of which this article is fufceptible, are alfo  
ef great extent and utility. Under this defcription, thofe of brafs, of which it is  
the principal ingredient, are intended to be included.  
  
The material is 2 natural produétion of the country. Mines of copper have  
a&amp;ually been wrought, and with profit to the undertakers, though it is not  
known that any ‘are now in this condition. And nothing is eafier, than the  
introduGtion of it, from other countries; on moderate terms, and in gréat  
plenty.  
  
Copperfmiths and brafs founders, particularly the former, are numerous  
in the united ftates ; fomeof whom carry on bufinefs to a refpe&amp;table extent.  
  
To multiply and extend manufaétories of the materials in queftion, is wor-  
thy of attention and effort, In order to this, it is defirable to facilitate a plenti-  
ful fupply of the materials. And a proper mean to this end is to place them in  
the clafs of free articles. Copper in plates, and brafs, are already in this predi-  
cament ; but copper in pigs and bars is not; neither is lapis calaminaris, which,  
together with copper and charcoal, conftitute the component ingredients of  
brafs. The exemption from duty, by parity of reafon, ought to embrace all  
fuch of thefe articles, as are objects of importation.  
  
An additional duty on brafs wares, will tend to the general end in view.  
‘Thefe now ftand at five per cent, while thole of tin, pewter, and copper, are  
rated at feven and an half,

elfe occurs as proper to be added.  
  
FOSSIL COAL. This, as an important inftrument of manufactures, mays  
witheut impropriety, be mentioned among the fubjeéts of this report.  
  
A copious fupply of it would be of great confequence to the iron bianch :  
as an article of houfehold fuel, alfo, it is an intereiting produétion, the utility  
of which mutt increafe in proportion to the decreafe of wood, hy the progrefs  
of fettiement and cultivation. And its importance to navigation, asan im-  
men(e article of tran{portation coalt-wife, is fignally exemplified in Great  
Britain.  
  
It is known, that there are feveral coal mines in Virginia, now worked, and  
apoearances of their exiltence are familiar ina number of places.  
  
Theexpediency of a bounty on all this fpecics of coal of home production,  
and of premiums, on the opening of new mines, under certain qualifications,  
appears to be worthy of particular examination. The great importance of the  
article will amply juttify a reafonable expenfe in this way, if it fhall appear to  
be neceffary to, and fhall be thought likely to anfwer the end.  
  
WOOD. Several manufaétures of this article flourifh in the united fates,  
Ships are no where built in greater perfection ; and cabinet wares, generally,  
are made little, if at all inferior to thofe of Europe. Their extent is fuch a5 to  
have admitted of confiderable exportation.  
  
An exemption from duty, of the feveral kinds of wood ordinarily ufed in  
thefe manufa&amp;ures, feems to be all that is requifite, by way of encouragement.  
It is recommended by the confideration of a fimilar policy being purfued in o-  
ther countries, and by the expediency of giving equal advantages to our own  
workmen in wood. The abundance of timber proper for fhip-building in the  
united ftates, does not appear to be any objeétion to it. The inereafing fearcity  
and growing mnportance of that agticle, in the European countries, admonifh  
the united {tates to ¢ mmence, and fy ftematically to purfue meafures for the pre-  
fervation of their ftock. Whatever may promote the regular eftablifhment of  
magazines of fhip timber, is in various views defrable.  
  
SKINS. There are fcarcely any manufadtories of greater importance, thaa of  
this article. Their dive&amp;t and very happy influence upon agriculture, by pro-  
moting the raifing of cattle of different kinds, is a very mateiial recommen-  
dation.  
  
It is pleafing, too, to obferve the extenfive progrefs they have made in their  
principal branches; which are fo far matured as alimoft to defy foreign compe-  
tition. Tanneries, in particular, are not only carried on as areguiar bufinefs,  
in numerous inftances, and in various parts of the country + but they cenkitute  
in fome p&#x27;aces a valuable item of incidental family maoutaéiures.  
  
Reprefentations, however, have been made, importing the expediettce of fur -  
ther encouw:agement to the leather branch in two ways; one, by increafing the  
duty on the manufa&amp;tures of it, which are importe , te other, by prohibiting  
the exportation of bark. Infupport of the latter, it is alleged, that the p rice of  
bark, chiefly in confequence of large exportations, has isfen within a few  
years, from about threedollars to four dollars and a half per cord.  
  
Thefe fuggeftions are fabmitted sather as intumations, which mit confide.

ration, than as matters, the propriety of which is manifeft. It is not clear,  
that anincreale of duty is neceflary ; and in regard to the prohibition defired,  
there is no evidence of any confiderable exportation hitherto; and it is moft  
probable, that whatever augmentation of price may have taken place, is to be  
attributed toan extenfion of the home demand from the increafeof manufac-  
tures, and toa decreafe of the fupply, in confequence of the progrefs of f{ettle-  
ment, rather than to the quantities which have been exported.  
  
It is mentioned, however, as an additional reafon for the prohibition, that  
one fpecies of the bark, ufually exported, is in fome fort peculiar to the coun-  
try, and the material of a very valuable dye, of great ufe in fome other manu-  
faétures, in which the united ftates have begun a competition.  
  
There may alfo be this argument in favour of an increafe of duty. The ob-  
je&amp; is of importance enough to claim decifive encouragement : and the progrefs  
which has been made, leaves no room to apprehend any inconvenience, on the  
fcore of fupply, from fuch an increafe.  
  
It would be of benefit to this branch, if glue, which is now rated at five  
per cent. were made the obje&amp; of an excluding duty, It is already made in large  
quantities at various tanneries ; and, like paper, is an entire economy of mate-  
rials, which, if not manufa&amp;tured, would be left to perith. It may be placed  
with advantage in the cliis of articles paying fifteen per cent.  
  
GRAIN. Manvfafiures of the feveral ipecies of this article havea title to  
peculiar favour ; not only becaufe they are moft of them immediately conne&amp;ted  
with the fubfiftence of the citizens, but becaufe they enlarge the demand for the  
moft precious produéts of the foul. :  
  
Though flour may, with propriety, be noticed as a manufacture of grain, it  
weie ulelefs to do it, but for the purpofe of fubmitting the expediency of a ge-  
neral fyltem of infpection throughout the ports of the united ftates, which, if  
eftablithed upon proper principles, would be likely to improve the quality of  
our flour every where, and to raife

te of pfofirs, at which the undertakers  
can afford to carry it on, mech lefs—the prejudices, in favour of imported gin,  
ftrong. Thefe circumftances are alleged to outweigh the charges, which at-  
tend the bringing of the article from Europe to the united ftates, and the prefert  
difference of duty, fo as to obftruct the profecution of the manufacture, with  
due advantage.  
  
Experiment could, perhaps, alone decide with certainty the jufnefs of the  
fuggettions which are made: but in relation to branches of manufacture fo im-  
portant, it would feem inexpediznt to hazard an unfavourable iflue, and better  
toerr on the fide of too great, than of too {wall a difference, in the particular in  
quettion.  
  
It is therefore fubmitted, that an addition of two cents per gillon be made  
to the duty on imported fpirits, of the firit clifs of proof, with a proportianable  
increafe on thofe of higher proof, and that a deduction of one cert per gallon  
be made from the duty on fpirits diftilled within the united flates, beginning  
with the firft clifs of proof, and a proportionable deduétion from the duty on  
thofe of higher proof.  
  
It is afcertained, that by far the gresteft part of the malt liquors econfumed in  
the united ftates are the produce of domeftic breweries. It is defirable, end, in  
ail likelihood, attainable, that the whole confumption fhould be fupplied by our-  
felves.  
  
The malt liqors, made at home, though inferior to the beft, are equal to a  
great part of thofe which have been ufually imported. The progrefs already  
made is an earneft of what may be accomplifhed. The growing competition is  
an aflurance of improvement. This will be accelerated by meafures, tending  
to invitea greate: capital into this channel of employment.  
  
Torender the encouragement of domeRic breweries decifive, it may be advife-  
able to fubftitute, to the prefent rates of duty, eight cents per gallon generally ;  
end it wiil deferve to be confidered asa guard again# evafions, whether there  
ought not to bea prohibition of th-ir importation, except in cafks of confider-  
able capacity, It is to be hoped, that fuch aduty would banifh from the market  
foreign malt liquors of inferior quality, and thatthe beft kind only would con.  
tinue to beimported,&#x27;till it Should be fupplanted, by the efforts of equal fkil] or  
care at home.  
  
Till that period, the importation fo qualified would be anufeful fimulus  
to improvement : and, in the mean time, the payment of the increafed  
price, for the enjoyment of a luxury, in order to the encouragement of a  
  
moft ufeful branch of domeftic induftry, could not reafOnably be deemed a  
hardhiip. .

Asa further aid to manufactures of grain, though upon a fmaller feale, the  
articles of ftaich, hair po.der, and wafers, may with great propriety be placed  
aniong thofe which are rated at fifteen per cent. No manufactures are more  
finple, nor more completely within the reach of a full fupply from domeftic  
fources ; and it isa policy, as common as it is obvious, to make them the object  
either of prohibitory duties, or of exprefs prohibition.  
  
FLAX AND HEMP. Manufactures of thefe articles have fo much affinity  
to e.ch other, and they are fu often blended, that they may with advantage be  
confidered in conjunétion. Theimportance of the linen branch to agriculture—  
its precious effe€ts upon houtehold indultry—the eafe with which the materials  
cau be produced at home, to any requifite extent—the great advances which  
been already made, in the coarler fabrics of them, efpecially in the family way,  
conftitute claims, of peculiar force, to the patronage of government.  
  
This patronage may be afforded in various ways—by promoting the growth  
of the msterials—by increafing the impediments co an advantageous competi-  
tion of rival foreign articles——by dire&amp;t bounties or premiums upon the home  
manufatture.  
  
Firft. As to promoting the growth of the materials.  
  
In refpe&amp; to hemp, fomething has been already done, by thehigh duty upon  
foreign hemp. If the facilities for domeftic produétion were not unufually great,  
the policy of the duty,on the foreign raw material, would be highly queftiona-  
ble, as interfering with the growth of manufaétures of it. But making the  
proper allowances for thofe faciJities, and with an eye to the future and natural  
progrels of the country, the meafure does not appear, upon the whole, excep-  
tionable,  
  
A ftrong with naturally fuggefts itfelf, that fome method could be deviled,  
of affording a more direé&amp;t encouragement to the growth both of flax and hemp,  
fuch as would be effectual, and at the fame time net attended with too great in-  
conveniencies. To this end, bounties and premiums offer themfelves to confide-  
ration; but no modification of them has’ yet occurred, which would not either  
hazari too much expenfe, or operate unequally in reference to the circumftances  
of different parts of the union: and which would not be attended with very  
great cifficulties in the execution. —  
  
Secondly. As to increaling the impediments to an advantageous competition  
of riyal foreign articles.  
  
To this purpole, an augmentation of the duties on importation is the obvious  
expedient ; which, in regard to certain articles, appears to be recommended by  
fufficient reaiqns. oF  
  
The privcipalof thefe articles is fail cloth ; one intimately conneéted with na-  
vigatioa and defence: and of which a flourithing manufaétory is eftablifhed at  
Botton, and very promifing ones at feveral other places.  
  
It is prefumed to be both fafe and advifable, to place this in the clafs of arti-  
eles rated atten per cert. A ftrong reafon for it refults fram the confideration,  
that a bounty of two pence Merling per ell is allowed, Hie “shee Britain, upon  
the exportation of the fail-cloth manufa&amp;tured in that kingdom.  
  
I: would likewife appear to be good policy, to raiie the duty to 7 1-2 per  
cent on the following articles. Drillings, oznaburghs, ticklenburghs, dowlas,

the prefent duty on imported cotton is indifpenfable.  
  
ss fubftitute for this, far more encouraging to domeftic produation, will be to  
grant a bounty on the national cotton, when wrought ata home manufaétory :  
to which a bounty on the exportation of it may beadded, Either or both would  
do much more towards promoting the growth of the article, than the merely  
nominal] encouragement, which it is propoted to abohith. ‘The firft would alfo  
have a direét influence in encouraging the manufaéture.  
  
The bounty, which has been mentioned, as ex:fting in Great Britain, upon  
the exportation of coarfe linens, not exceeding a certain value, applies alfo to  
certain deferp&#x27;ions of cotton goods of fimilar value.  
  
This furnifhes an additional argument for allowing to the national manu-  
facturers the ipecies of encourageinent juft fuggefted, and indeed for adding fome  
other aid.  
  
One cent per yard, rot lefs than of a given width, on all goods of cotton, or  
of cetton andiinen mixed, which are manufa&amp;tured in the united ftates, with  
the addition of one cent per pound weight of the material, if made of nation-  
al cotton, would amount to an aid of confiderable importance, both to the  
production, and tothe manufacture of that valuable article. Andit is con-  
ceived that the expenfe would be well juftified by the magnitude of the objeé.  
  
The printing and ftaining of cotton goods is known to be adiftinét bufinefs  
from the fabrication of them. It is one eafily accomplifhed, and which, as it  
adds materially to the value of the article in its white Mate, and prepares it for a  
wariety of new ules, is of importance to be promoted,  
  
As imported cottons, equally with thofe which are made at home, may be  
the objeéts of this manufacture, it will merit confideration, whether the whole,  
or a partof the duty, on the white goods, ought not to be allowed to be drawn  
back, in favour of thofe, who print or ftain them, This meafure would cer-  
tainly operate as a powerful encouragement to the bufinefs; and, though it  
may in a degree counteract the original fabrication of the articles, it would  
probably more than compenfate for this difadvantage, in the rapid growth of  
a collateral branch, which is of a nature fooner to attain to maturity. When a  
fufficient progrefs fhall have been made, the drawback may be abrogated, and  
by that tine the domeftic fupply of the articles to be printed er ftained will have  
been extended,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Part I.) Report of the fecretary of the treafury on manufaftares. &quot;47  
  
If the duty of feven and a half per cent. on certain kinds of cotton goods  
were extended to all goods of cotton, or of whictrit isthe principal material, it  
would probably more than counterbalance the effect of the drawhack propofed,  
jn relation to the fabrication of the article. And ne material objeétion occurs to  
fuch anextenfion. The duty, then, confidering all the circumftances which at-  
tend goods of this defcription, could not be deemed inconveniently high ; and it  
may be inferred from various caufes, that the prices of them would ftill continue  
moderate.  
  
Manufa@tories of cotton goods, not long fince eftablifhed at Beverly, in Maf-  
fachufetts, and at Providence, in the ftate of Rhode Ifland, and conduéted  
with a perfeverance correfponding with the patriotic motives which began them,  
feem to have overcome the firft obftacles to fuccefs ; producing corduroys, vel-  
verets, fuftians, jeans, and other fi:niiar artieles, of a quality, which will beara  
comparifon with the like articles brought from Mancheiter. The one at Prowvi-  
dence has the merit of being the fir in introlueing into the united Rates, the  
celebrated cotton mill ; which not only fu: nifhes materials for that manufactory  
itfelf, but for the fupply of private families for houfehold manufa&amp;ure.  
  
Other manufaétories of the fame material, as regular bufineffes, have alfo been  
begun at different places in the fiate of Conneécticut, but all upon a {maller  
feale than thofe above mentioned. Some effays are alfo moking in the printing

 of courfe, to be  
adjufted with aneye to quality as well as quantity.  
  
A fund for this purpofe may be derived from the addition of two and a half  
per cent, to the prefent rate of duty, on carpets and carpeting; an increafe, to  
which the nature of the articles fuggefts no objection, and which may, at the  
fame time, furnish a motive the more, to the fabrication of them at home; to-  
wards which fome beginning. have been made.  
  
SILK. The production of this article is attended with great facility in moft  
parts of the united ftates. Some pleafing eflays are making in Conneéticut, as  
well towards that, as towards the manufaéture of what is produced. Stock-  
ings, hancdkei chiefs, :ibands, and buttons, are made, though as yet but in {mall  
quantities, .  
  
A manufastory of lace, upon a feale not very extenfive, has been long memo-  
rable at Iptwich, in the fate of Maflachufetts.  
  
An exemption of the material from the duty, which it now pays on importa-  
tion, and premiums upon th: prodution, to be difpenied under the direétion of  
the inflirutien before alluded to, feem to be the only {pecies of encouragement  
advifeable at fo eariy a flage of the thing.  
  
GLASS. The materiais for making glafs are found every where. In the  
united ftates, there 1s no deficiency of them. The fands and ftones called tarfo,  
which include flinty and cryftaliine tubfances generally, and the falis of vari-  
ous plants, particularly of the f29-weed kali or kelp, conftitute the eflential in-  
gredients. An extraordinary abundance of fuel is a particular advantage en-  
foyed by this country for fuch manulastures. They, however, require large ca-  
pitals and involve much manual labour.  
  
Different manufactories of giafs are now on foot in the united fates. The  
pr fent Jucy of 12 4} per cent. on all imported articles of glafs, amounts toa  
coniide: »ie encouragement to thofe manufaétories. It any thing in addition is  
judged c ‘gible, the moft psoper would appear to be a direct bounty, on window  
g!ais and biack bot les.  
  
The firtt recommends itfelf as aw objeSt&#x27;of general convenience ; the laft adds  
to thatcharacter, the circumitance of being an important item in breweries. A  
complaint is made of great deficiency in this refpeét.  
  
GUN-POWDER. No fincil progres has been of late made in the manufac-  
ture of this very important article: it may, indeed, be confidered as already  
eftablifhed ; burits high importance renders its further extenfion very defirable.  
  
The encovragements, which it already enjoys, are a duty of ten per cent. on  
the foreign rival article, and an exemption of faltpetre, one of the principal in-  
giede ts of woch it is compoled, from duty. A like exemption of fulphur,  
a other chief ingredient, would appear to be equally proper. No quantity of  
t&#x27;ss article has yet been produced from internal fources. The ule made of it  
in finifhing the bottcms of fhips, is an additional inducement to placing it in  
the clefs of free goods. Regulations for the careful infpe&amp;ion of the article

 would {weil this report, already voluminous, te  
a fize too inconvenient.  
  
If the principle thall not be deemed inadmiffible, the means of avoiding an  
abufe of it will not be likely to prefent infurmountable obftacles. There are  
ufeful guides from practice in other quarters.  
  
It thill, therefore, only be remaiked here, in relation to this point, that any  
bounty, which may be applied to the manutacture of an article, cannot with  
fafety extend beyond thofe manufaétories, at which the making of the article is  
a regular trade. It would be impoffible to annex adequate precautions to a be-  
nefitof that nature, if extended to every private family, in which the manu.  
facture was incidentally carried on: and its being a merely incidental occu.  
pation which engages a portion of time, that would otherwife be loft, it can be  
advantageoufly carried on, without fo fpecial an aid.  
  
The pofiibility of a diminution of the revenue, may alfo prefent itfelf, as an  
ohieGtion to the arrangements, which haye been fubmitted.  
  
But there is no truth, which may be more firmly relied upon, than that the  
intereits of the revenue are promoted by whatever premotes an increafe of na-  
tional induitry and weaith.  
  
In proportion to the degree of thefe, is the capacity of every country te  
contiibute to the public treafury ; and where the capacity to pay is increafed,  
or even is not decreafed, the only contequence of meafures, which diminifh any  
particular refource, is a change of the objeét. If, by encouraging the manufac.  
ture of anarticle at home, the revenue, which has been wont to accrue from  
its importation, fhould be Icffened, an indemnification can eafily be found, either  
out of the manufacture itielf, or from fome other object, which may be deemed  
more convenient,  
  
The meafu:es, however, which hove been fubmitted, taken aggregately,  
will, for along time to come, rather augment than decreale the public re-  
venue.  
  
There is little room to hope, that the progrefs of manufaQures will fo equally  
keep pace with the progrefs of population, as to prevent even a gradual aug-  
mentation of the product of the duties on imported articles.  
  
As, neverthele{s, an abolition, in fome inftances, and a reduétion, in others,  
of duties, which have been pledged for the public debt, is propofed, it is  
effential that it fhould be accompanied with a competent fubfitute. In order  
to this, it is requifite, that ail the additional duties which fhail be laid, be ap-  
propriated, in the firft inftance, to replace all defalcations, which may proceed  
from any fuch abolition or diminution. It is evident, at firft glance, that they  
will not only be adequate to this, but will yield a confiderable furplus, ‘This  
furplus will ferve,  
  
Firft. To conftitute a fund for paying the bounties which fhall have been  
decreed.  
  
Secondly. To conftitute a fund for the operations of a board to be eftab-  
lithed for promoting arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce. Of  
this inflitution, different intimations have been given, in the courfe of this re-  
port. An outline of a plan for it ihall now be fubmitred,  
  
Let a certain annual fum be fet apart, and placed under the management of  
commiffioners not lefs than three, to coniitof cectain officers of the government  
and their fucceffors in office.

to defray the expenfes of the emigration of artifts, and manufaéturers in pare  
ticular branches, of extraordinary importance—to induce the profecution and  
introduation of uleful difcoveries, inventions, and improvements, by proper-  
tionate rewards, judicioufly held out and applied—to encourage by premiums,  
both honowiable and lucrative, the exertion’ of individuals, and of claffes, in  
relation to the feveral objeéts, they are charged with promoting—an. to afe  
ford fuch other aids to thofe objeéts, as may be generally defignated by law.

aétions and difburfements ; and all fuch fums as fhall not have been applied  
to the purpofcs of their truft, at the end of every three years, to revert to the  
treafury. It may alfobe enjoined upon them, not to draw out the money, but  
for the purpofe of fome specific difourfement.  
  
It may, moreover, be of ufe, to authorife them to receive voluntary contribu-  
tions ; making it their duty to apply them to the particular objects for which  
they may have been made, if any fhall have been defignated by the donors.  
  
There is reafon to believe, that the progrefs‘of particular manufactures has  
been much retarded by the want of fkilful workmen. And it often happens,  
that the capitals employed are not equal to the purpofes of bringing from  
abroad workmen of a fuperior kind, Here, in cafes woithy of a, the auxiliary  
agency of government would, in all probability, be ufefui. There are alfo va-  
luable workmen, in every branch, who are prevented from emigrating folely by  
the want of means. Occafional aids to fuch perions, properly adminiftered,  
might bea fource of valuable acquifitions to the country.  
  
The propriety of ftimuiating, by rewards, the invention and introduétion of  
ufeful improvements, is admitted without difficulty. But the fuccefs of attempts  
in this way mutt evidently depend much on the manner of conducting them. It is  
probable, that the placing of the difpenfation of thofe rewards under fome proper  
difcretionary direétion, where they may be accompanied by collateral expedients,,  
will ferve to give them the fureft efficacy. It feems impradicable to apportion,  
by general rules, fpecific compenfations for difcoveries of unknown, and difpro-  
portionate utility. :  
  
The great ufe, which may be made of a fund of this nature, co procure and  
import foreign improvements, is particularly obvious. Among thefe, the ar-  
ticle of machines would form a moft important item.  
  
The operation and utility of premiums have been adverted to—together with  
the advantages which have refuited from their difpenfation, under the direétion  
ef certain public and private focieties. Of this, fome experience has been had  
in the inftance of the Penntylvania fociety, for the promotion of manvfa&amp;ures  
and the ufeful arts: but the funds of that affociation have been too contracted  
to produce more than a very fmall portion of the good to which the principles  
ef it would have led, It may confidently be affirmed, that there is fcarcely  
any thing, which has been devifed, better calculated to excite a general {pi-  
rit of improvement, than the inftitutions of this nature. They are truly in-  
  
valuable.

leather breeches, gloves, muffs and tippets, parchment and glue.

fcale-beams and weights, various tools of artificers, arms of different  
kinds; though the manufaéture of thefe laft has of late diminithed for  
want of demand,  
  
3- Of wood. Ships, cabinet wares and turnery, wool and cotton  
cards, and other machinery for manufactures and hufbandry, ma-  
thematrcal inftruments, and cooper’s wares of every kind. - ’

* Befides manufaCtorics of thefe articles, which are carried on as  
regular trades, and have attained to a confiderable degree of matumity,  
there is a vaft fcene of houfhold manufacturing, which contributes  
more largely to the fupply of the community than could be imagined,  
without having made it an object of particular enquiry. This ob-  
fervation is the pleafing refult of the inveltigation to which the fub-  
je@ of this report has led, and is applicable as well to the foutherm as  
to the middle and northern ftates; great quantities of coarfe cloths,  
coatings, ferges, and flannels, linfey-woolfeys, hofiery of wool, cot-  
ton and thread, coarfe fuftians, jeans and muflins, checked and ftriped  
cotton and linen goods, bed-ticks, coverlets and counterpanes, tow  
finens, coarfe fhirtings, fheetings, towelling and table linen, and va-  
rious mixtures of wool and cotton, and of cotton and flax, are made  
in the houfhold way, and in many inftances to an extent not only  
fufficient for the fupply of the families in which they are made, but  
for fale, and even in fome cafes for exportation. It is computed in  
a number of diftriéts, that two-thirds, three-fourths, and even four-  
fifths, of all the clothing of the inhabitants, are made by themfelves.’

J admit that the agricultural ſyſtem has in-  
trinſically a ſtrong, but not an excluſive, claim  
to pre- eminence over every other kind of induf-  
try; but I contend that it is advanced by the  
due encouragement of manufactures. Great  
writers on political economy have maintained,  
that agriculture is not only the moſt productive,  
but the oNLY productive, ſpecies of induſtry;  
their calculations and facts are diſputable, and

“In every Country (say those who entertain them)  
agriculture is the most beneficial and productive  
object of human industry. This position, generally,  
if not universally true; applies with peeuliar em-  
phasis to the United States, on aceount of their im-  
mense tracts of fertile territory, uninhabited and  
unimproved, Nothing can afford so advantageous an  
employment for capital and labor, as the conver-  
sion of this extensive wilderness into cultivated,  
farms. Nothing equally with this, can contribute to  
the population, strength and real riches of the  
country. }  
  
“To endeavor, by the extraordinary patronage of  
government, to accelerate the growth of manufac-  
tures, iss in fact, to etideavor, by force and art,  
to transfer the natural current of industry, from a  
more to a less beneficial channel. Whatever has such  
a tendency must necessarily be unwise: indeed it  
can hardly ever be wise in a government, to attempt  
\to give a direction to the industry of its citizéns.  
This, under the quick-sighted guidance of private  
interest, will, if left to itself, infullibly find its own  
way to the most profitable employment; and it is by  
such employment, that the public prosperity will be  
most effectually promoted. To leave industry to  
iiself, therefore, is, in almost every case, the sound-  
est, as well as the simplest policy.  
  
“This policy is not only recommended to the  
United States, by considerations which affect all  
nations ; it is, i a manner, dictated to them by- the  
imperious force of a very peculiar situation. The  
smaliness of thcir population, compared with their

This mode of reasoning is founded upon facts and  
principles, which have certainly respectable preten-  
sions. If it had governed the conduct of nations,  
More generally than it has done, there is room to  
suppose, that it might have carried them faster to  
prosperity and greatness, than they have attaine: by  
the pursuit of maxims too widely opposite. Most  
general theories, however, admit of numerous ex-  
ceptions ; and there are few, if any, of the political  
kiad, which do not blend a considerable portion of  
error with the truths they inculcate.  
  
In order to an-accurate judgment, how far that,  
which has been just stated, ought to be deemed lia-  
ble to a similar imputation, it is necessary. to advert  
e«refully to the considerations which plead in favor  
of manufactures, and which appear to recommend  
the special‘and positive encouragement of them, in  
eertain cases, and under certain reasonable limi-  
tations. :  
  
Kt ought readily to be conceded, that the cultiva- |  
  
tion of the earth, as the primary and most certain  
source of national supply—as the immediate and  
ehief source of subsistence to man—as the principal  
source of those materials which constitute the nutri-  
ment of other kinds of labor—as including a state  
most favorable to the freedom and independence of  
the human mind—one, perhaps, most conducive to  
the mukiplication of the human species—has intrin-  
sically a strong claim to pre-eminence over every  
ether kind of industry.  
  
But, that it has a title tc any thing like an exclu-  
sive predilection, in any country, ought to be ad-  
mitted with great caution. That it is even more pro-  
ductive than every branch of industry, requires more  
evidence than has yet been given in support of the  
position. That its real interests, precious and im-  
portant as, without help of exaggeration, they truly  
are, Will be advanced, rather than injured by the due  
encouragement of manufactures, may, it is believed,  
be satisfactorily demonstrated. And it is also be-  
lieved, that the expediency of such encouragement,  
m a general view, may be shown to be recommended  
by the most cogent and persuasive motives of na-  
tional policy.  
  
It has been maintained, that agriculture is not  
enly the most productive, but the only productive  
species of industry. The reality of this suggestion,  
in either respect, has, however, not been verified by  
any accurate detail of facts and calculations: and  
the general arguments which are adduced to prove  
it, are rather subtle and paradoxical, than solid or  
gpnvincing.  
  
Those, which maintain its exclusive productive-  
ness, are to this effect :  
  
Labor, bestowed upon the cultivation of land,  
produces enough, not only to replace all the neces-  
gary expences incurred in the business, and to main-  
tain the persons who are employed in it, but to  
afford, tegether with the ordinary profit on the stock  
er capital of the farmer, a net surplus, or rent for the  
landlord or proprietor of the soil. But the labor of  
artificers does nothing more than replace the stock  
which employs them, or which furnishes materials,  
tools, and wages, and yield the ordinary profit upon  
that stock. It-yields nothing equivalent to the rent  
of land. Neither does it add any thing to the total  
talue of the whole annual produce of the land and  
kibor of the country. The additional value given to  
those parts of the produce of land, which are wrought  
into manufactures, is counterbalanced by the value  
of those other parts of that produce, which are con-  
sumed by the manufacturers, Itcan therefore only be  
iy saving or parsimony, not by the positive produc-  
tiveness of their labor, that the classes of artificers  
can many degreeaugment the revenue of the socicty.  
  
To this it has been answered,  
  
1. “That inasmuch as it is acknowledged, that  
manufacturing laborre-producesa value equal to that  
which is expended or consumed in carrying it on,  
and continues in existence the original stock or  
capital employed, it ought, on that account alone, to  
escape being considered as wholly unproductive :  
that though it should be admitted, as alledged, that  
the consumption of the produce of the soil, by the  
classes of artificers or manufacturers, is exactly  
equal to the value added by their labor to the ma-  
  
terials upon which it is exerted; yet it would not  
  
thence follow, that it added nothing to the revenue  
of the society, or to the aggregate value of the annual  
produce of its land and labor. If the consumption  
for any given period, amounted to a given sum, an  
the increased value of the produce manufactured, in  
the same period, to a like sum, the total amount of  
the consumption and production during that period,  
would be equal to the two sums, and consequently  
double the value of the agricultural produce coh-  
sumed. And though the increment of value, pro-  
duced by the classes of artificers, should at no time  
exceed the value of the produce of the land con-  
sumed by them, yet there would be at every mo-  
ment, in consequence of their labor, a grester value  
of goods in the market, than would exist indepen-  
dent of it.  
  
2. “That the position, that artificers can augment  
the revenue of a society, only by parsimony, is true  
in no other sense, than in one which is equally ap.  
plicable to husbandmen or cultivators. It may be  
alike affirmed of all these classes, that the fund  
acquired by their labor, and destined for their sup  
port, is not, in an ordinary way, more than equal to  
it. And hence it will follow, that augmentations of  
the wealth or capital of the community (except in  
the instances of some extraordimary dexterity or  
skill) can only procecd, with respect to any of them,  
from the savings of the more thrifty and parsimo-  
nious.  
  
3. “That the annual produce of the land and lIa-  
bor ef a country can dnly be increased, in two ways,  
by some improvement in the productive powers of  
the useful labor, which actually exists within it, or  
by some increase in the quantity of such labor; that  
with regard to the first, the labor of artificers being  
capable of greater subdivision and simplicity of  
operation, than that of cultivators, it is susceptible,  
in a proportionably greater degree, of improvement  
in its productive powers, whether to be derived from  
an accession of skill, or from the application of  
ingenious machinery; in which particular, there-  
fore, the labor. employed in the culture of land car  
pretend to no advantage over that engaged in ma-  
nufactures: that with regard to an augmentation of  
the quantity of useful labor, this, excluding adven-  
titious circumstances, must depend essentially upor  
an increase of capital, which again must depend upor  
the savings made out of the revenues of those, who  
furnish or munage that, which is at any time em-  
ployed, whether in : igriculture, or in manufactures,  
or in any other way.  
  
But while the exclusive productiveness of agricul-  
tural labor has been thus denied and refuted, the  
superiority of its productiveness has been conceded  
without hesitation. As this concession involves 2  
point of considerable magnitude, in relation to max-  
ims of public administration, the grounds on which  
it rests are worthy of a distinct and particular  
ex:mination.  
  
_ One of the arguments made use of, in support of  
the idea, may be pronounced both quaint and super-  
ficial ; it amounts to this :—That in the productions  
  
  
  
of the seil, nature co-operates with man; and that the

yaffect of their point labor must be greater than that.  
  
of the labor of man alone.  
  
This, however, is far from being a necessary th-  
ference. It is very conceivable, that the labor of man  
alone laid out upon a work, requiring great skill and  
art to bring it to perfection, may be more productive,  
an value, than the labor of nature and man combined,  
when directed towards more’ simple operations and  
objects: and when it is recollected to what an ex-  
‘tent the agency of nature,sin the application of the  
mechanical powers, is made auxiliary to the prose-  
cution of manufactures, the suggestion which has  
been noticed, loses even the appearance of plau-  
sibility  
  
It might also be observed, with a contrary view,  
dhat the labor employed in agriculture is in a great  
aneasure periodical and occasional, depending on  
seasons, liable to various and long intermissions ;  
while that occupied in many manufactures is con-  
stant and regular, extending through the year, em-  
bracing, in some instances, night as well as day. It  
is also probable, that there are among the cultiva-  
tors of land, more examples of remissness, than  
among artificers. The farmer, from the peculiar  
fertility of his land, or some other favorable circum-  
stance, may frequently obtain a livelihood, even with  
a considerable degree of carelessness in the mode of  
cultivation ; but the artisan can with difficulty effect  
the same object, without exerting himself pretty  
equally with all those, who are engaged in the sme

because, in fact, the satié thing which is éontem-  
  
{plated in the case of the farm, sometimes happens in  
  
that of a niattufactory. ‘There is one, who furnishes  
a part of the capital, or lends_a part of the monéy, by  
which it is carried on, arid another, who carries it on,  
with thé addition of his own capital. Out of the  
surplus which remains, afier defraying expences, ar  
interest is paid to the money-lender for the propor  
tion of the capital furnished by him, which exactly  
agrees with the rent puid to the landlord; and the  
residue of that surplus constituted the profit of the  
undertaker or manufacturer, and agrees with what  
is denominated the ordinary profits of the stock of  
the farmer. Both together make the ordinary profits  
of two capitals employed in a manufactory ; as m

venue of the farmer compose the ordinary profits of  
two éapitals, employed in the cultivation of a farm.  
The rent, therefore, accruing to the proprietor of

ductiveneéss, as has béen argued, is no criterion even  
of superior productiveness. The question must still  
be, whether the surplus, after defraying éxpences,  
of a given capital, employed in the purchase and  
improvement of a piece of land, is greater or less,  
than that of a like capital, employed in the prosecu-

ingenuity than agriculture, it would not be a strained  
conjecture, that the labor employed in. the former  
being at once more constant, more uniform, and more  
ingenious, than that which is employed in the latter,  
will be found at the same time more productive.  
  
But it is not meant to lay stress on observations of  
  
this nature : they ought only to serve as a counter.  
balance to those of a similar complexion. Circum-  
stances so vague and general, as well as so abstract,  
can afford little instructign in a matter of this kind.  
  
Another, and that which seems to be the principal  
  
argument offered for the superior productiveness of  
  
agricultural labor, turns upon the allegation, that  
  
dabor employed on manufactures yields nothing equi-  
  
valent to the rent of land; or to that surplus, as it is  
oulled, which accrues to the proprietor of the soil.  
But this distinction, important as it has been deemed,  
appears rather verbal than substantial.  
  
It is easily discernible, that what, in the first  
instance, is divided into two parts, under the deno-

only the ordinary profit of a certain stock in land,

greatest product, according to a compound ratie of  
the quantity of the capital and the quantity of labor,  
whieh ane employed in the one or in the other,  
  
The solution of either of these, questions 1s not  
easy: it involves numerous complicated details,  
depending on an accurate knowledge of the objects  
te be compared. [tis not known that the compari-  
son has ever\yet been made upon sufficient data,  
properly ascertained and anslized. To be able to  
make it on the present occasion, with satisfactory  
precision, would demand more previous enquiry and  
investigation, than there has been hitherto either  
leisure or opportunity to accomplish.  
  
Some essays, hewever, have been made towards  
acquiring the requisite information; which have  
rather served to throw doubt upon, than to confirm  
the hypothesis, under examination. But it ought to  
be acknowledged, that they have been too little  
diversified, and are too imperfect, to authorise a  
definitive conclusion, either way ; leading rather to  
probable conjecture than to certain deduction. They  
render it probable, that there are various branches  
of manufactures, in which a given capital will yield  
a greater total product, and a considerably greater  
net product, than an equal capital invested.in the  
purchase and improvement of lands; and that there  
are also some branches, in which both the gross and  
the net produce will exceed that of a pra  
industry: according to a compound ratio of capita  
  
and labor. But it is on this last point, that there ap-  
pears to be the greatest room for doubt. It is far  
less difficult, to infer generally, that the net pro-  
duce of capital engaged in manufacturing enter-

ral scale of national exertion, than might perhaps op  
a superficial view be supposed, and has effects not  
altoyether dissimilar from those of the cireumstance  
last noticed. To cherish and stimulate the activity  
of the huma# mind by multiplying the objceis of  
enterprize, is net among the least considerable of  
the expedienta, by which the wealth of a nation m:y  
be promoted. Even things, in themselves not posi-  
tively advantageous, sometimes become so, by their  
tendency to provoke exertion. Every wew scene  
which is opened to the busy nature of man, to rouse  
and exert itself, is the addition of a new energy te  
the general stock of effort. &#x27;  
  
The spirit of enterprize, useful and prolific as it  
is, must necessary be contracted or expanded in pro-  
portion to the simplicity or variety, of the occupa-  
tions and productions whick are to be found in a so-  
ciety. It must be less in a nation of mere cultiva-  
tors, than in a nation of cultivators and merchants;  
less in a nation of cultivators and merchants, than  
in a nation of cultivators, artificers, and merchants,  
  
Vil. As to the creating, in some instances, a new,  
and securing im all a more ¢ertain and steady demand  
for the surplus produce of the soil.  
  
This is agaong the most important of the circum:  
stances which have been indicated. It is a principal  
/mean, by which the establishment ef manufactures  
contributes to an augmentation of the produce or  
revenue of acountry, and has an immediate and di-  
rect relation to the prosperity of agriculture.  
  
It is evident, that the exertions of the husbandman  
will be steady or fluctuating, vigorous or feeble, in  
  
  
  
Here is perccived an important resource, not only | proportion to the steadiness or fuctuation, adequ:te-  
  
for extending the population, and with it the usefu! ness or inadequateness of the markets on which he  
and productive labor of the country, but likewise; must depend, for the vent of the surplus, which may  
for the presecution of manufactures, without de-| be produced by his labor; and that such surplus, in  
  
ducting from the mimber of hands which might  
  
otherwise be drawn to tillage; and even for the in-|  
  
demnification of agriculture for such as might hap-  
pen to be diverted from it. Many, whom manufac-  
turing views would induce to emigrate, would  
afterwards yield to the temptations, which the par-  
ticular situation of this country holds out to agricul-  
tural pursuits And while agriculture wouid in other  
vespects derive many signal and unmingled advanta-  
ges, from the growth of manufactures, it is a prob-  
tem, whether it would guin or lose, as to the article  
of the number of persons employed in carrying it on.  
  
V. As to the furnishing greater scope for the di-  
tersity of talents and dispositions, which discrimi-  
mate men from each other.  
  
This is a much move powerful mean of augment-  
ing the fund of national industry than may xt first  
sight appear. It is a just observation, that minds,  
of the strongest and most active powers for their  
proper objects, fail below mediocrity, and labor  
without effect, if confined to uncongenial pursuits.  
Aud it is thence to be inferred, that the resul¢ of  
human exertion may be immensely increased by di-  
versifying its objects. When sll the different kinds  
6f industry obtain in a community, each individual  
can find his proper element, and call into activity  
the whole vigor of his nature. And the community  
js benefited by the services of itsrespective members,  
in the manner in which each can serve it with most  
effect.  
  
If there be any thing in a remark ofter to be met  
with, namely, that there is, in the genius of the people  
of this country, a peculiar aptitude for mechanic  
improvements, it would operate as a forcible reason  
for giving oportunities to the exercise of that species  
of talent, by the propagation of manufactures.

ns in  
tiie countries, which are the consumers, make im-  
mense differences in the produce of their own soils,  
in different years, and consequefttly in the oe of  
their necessity, for foreign supply. Plentiful har-  
vests with them, especially if similar ones occur at  
the same time in the countries which are furnishers,  
eccision of course a glut in the markets of the  
latter.  
  
C nsidering how fast and how much the progress  
of new settlements in the United States must increase  
the surplus produce of the soil, and weighing seri-  
ously the tendency of the system, which prevails  
among most of the commercial nations of Europe ;  
whatever dependence may be placed on the force of  
natural circumstances to counteract the effects of an  
artificial policy ; there appear strong reasons to re-  
gard the foreign demand for that surplus, as too un-  
curtain a reliance, and to desire a substitute for it,  
in an extensive domestic market.  
  
To secure such a market, there is no other expe-  
dient, than to promote manufacturing establish-  
ments. Manufacturers, who constitute the most  
numerous class, after the cultivators of land, are for  
that reason the principal consumers of the surplus  
of their labor.  
  
This idea-of an extensive demestic market for the  
surplus produce of the soil, is of the first consequence.  
It is, of all things, that which most effectually condu-  
eés to a flourishing state of agriculture. If the effect  
of manufuctories should be to detaeh a portion of the  
hands, which would otherwise be engaged in tillage,  
it might possibly cause a smaller quantity of lands  
to be under cultivation: but by their tendency to  
procure a more certain demand for the surplus pro-  
duce of the soil, they would, at the same time, cause  
the lands, which were in cultivation,. to be better  
improved and more productive. And while, by their  
witiuence, the condition of each individal farmer  
would be meliorated, the total mass of agricultural  
production would probably be increased. For this  
must evidently depend as much, if not more, upon  
  
the degree of improvement, than upon the number of |  
  
acres under culture. .  
  
{t merits particular observation, that the multi-  
leation of manufactories not only furnishes a mar-  
et for those articles which have been accustomed  
  
to be produced in abundance, in a country; but it  
likewise creates a demand for such as were either  
unknown or produced in ‘inconsiderable quantities.  
The bowels, as well as the surface of the earth, are  
ransacked for articles which were before neglected.  
Animals, plants, and minerals acquire a utility and  
value, which were before unexplored.  
  
The foregoing considerations seem sufficient to:  
  
establish, as general propositions, that it is the inte-  
  
rest of nations to diversify the industrious pursuits of  
  
the individuals who compose them—that the esta-  
blishment of manufactures is calculated not only to  
increase the general stock of useful and productive  
labor, but even to improve the state of agriculture in  
particular, certainly to advance the interests of those  
who are engaged init. There are other views, that  
will be hereafier taken of the subject, which, it is  
tanceived, will’ serve to confirm these inferences.  
  
VU. Previously to a further discussion of the ob-  
  
can be said in reference to the particular situatio™  
of the United States, against the conclusions appear”  
  
ing to result from what has been already offered.  
It may be observed, that the idea is of no inconsi-  
  
derable weight, that however true it might be, that  
  
a state, which, possessing large tracts of vacant and  
fertiie territory, was at the same time secluded from  
foreign commerce, would find its interest and the  
mterest of agriculture, in diverting a part of its  
population from tillage to manufactures ; yet, it will  
not fullow that the same is true of a state, which,  
having such vacant and fertile territory, has, at the  
same time ample opportunity of procuring from  
abroad, on good terms, all the fabrics of which it  
stands in need, for the supply of its inhabitants. The  
power of doing this at least secures the great advan-  
tage of a division of labor, leaving the farmer free  
to pursue exclusively the culture of his land, and  
enabling him to procure with its products, the manu-  
factured supplies requisite either to his own wants  
orto his.enjoyments. And though it should be true,  
that in settled countries, the diversification of mdus-  
try is conducive to an increase in the productive  
powers of labor, and to an augmentation of revenue  
and capital; yet it is scarcely conceiveable that  
there can be any thing of so solid and permanent ad-  
vantage to an uncultivated and unpeopled country,  
as to convert its wastes into cultivated and inhabited  
districts. If the reveriue, in the mean time, should  
be less, the capital, in the event, must be greater.  
To these observations, tlie following appears to be  
a Satisfactory answer—  
  
1. If the system of perfect liberty to industry and  
commerce were the prevailing system of nations, the  
arguments, which dissuade a country, in the predica-  
ment of the United States, from the zealous pursuit  
of manufactures, would doubtless have great force.  
It will not be affirmed, that they might not be per-  
mitted, with few exceptions, to serve as the rule of  
national conduct. In such a state of things, each  
country would have the full benefit of its. peculiar  
advantages, to compensate for its deficiencies or dis-  
advantages. If one nation were in condition to sup-  
ply manufactured articles on better terms than ano-  
ther, that other might find an abundant indemnifica-  
tion ina superior capacity to furnish the produce of  
the soil. And a free exchange, mutually beneficial,  
of the commodities which each was able to supply,  
on the best terms, might be carried on between  
them, supporting in full vigor the industry of each.  
And though the circumstances which have been  
mentioned, and others, which will be unfolded here-  
after, render it probable, that nations merely agri  
cultural, would not enjoy the same degree of opu-  
lence, in proportion to their numbers, as those which  
united manufactures with agriculture ; yet the pro-  
gressive improvement of the lands of the former,  
might, in the end, atone for an inferior degree of  
opulence in the mean time; and in a case, in which  
opposite considerations are pretty equally balanced,  
the opinion ought perhaps always to be, in favor of  
leaving industry to its own direction.  
  
But the system, which has been mentioned, is far  
from characterising the general policy of nations.  
The prevalent one has been regulated by an opposite  
spirit. The consequence of it is, that the United  
States are, to a certain extent, in the situation ofa  
country precluded from foreign commerce. They  
ean, indeed, without difficulty, obtain from abroad  
the manufactured supplies, of which they are in  
want; but they experience numerous and very in-  
  
their own commodities. Nor is this the case in re

Wie of viese turns on the proposition, that in-  
dustry, if left to itself, will naturally find its way  
to the most useful and profitable employment.  
whence it is inferred, that manufactures, without the  
aid of government, will grow up as soon and as fast,  
as the natural state of things and the interest of the  
community may require.  
  
Against the solidity of this hypothesis, in the full  
latitude of the terms, very cogent reasons may be  
offered. These have relation to the strong influence  
of habit aiid spirit of imitation, the fear of want of  
success in untried enterprises, the intrinsic difficul.  
ties incident to first essays towards a competition  
with those who have previously attamed to perfec-  
tion in*the business to be attempted, the bounties,  
premiums, and other artificial encouragements, with  
which foreign nations second the exertions of their  
own citizens in the branches in which they are to be  
rivalled.  
  
‘Experience teaches, that men are often so much  
froverned by what they are accustomed to see and  
practice, that the simplest and most obvious im-  
provements, in the most ordinary occupations, are  
adopted with hesitation, reluctance, and by slow  
gradations. The spontaneous transition to new pur-  
suits, in a community long habituated to different  
ones, may be expected to be attended with propeor-  
tionably greater difficulty. When former occwpa-  
tions ceased to yield a profit adequate to the sub-  
sistence of their followers, or when there was an  
absolute deficiency of employment in them, owing to  
the superabundance of hands, changes would ensue:  
but these changes would be likely to be more tardy  
than might consist with the interest either of indivi-  
duals or of the society. In many cases they would  
not happen, while a bare support could be ensured  
by an adherence to ancient courses; though a resort  
to a more profitable employment might be practica-  
ble. To produce the desirable changes, as early as  
may be expedicnt, may therefore require the incite-  
ment and patronage of government.  
  
The apprehension of failing in new attempts is  
perhaps a more serious impediment. Fhere are  
dispositions apt to be attracted by the mere novelty  
of an undertaking; but these are not always those  
best calculated to give it success. To this, it is of  
importance,that the confidence of the cautious, sa-  
gacious Capitalists, both citizens and foreigners,  
  
nufactories, for the reasons assigned, must be ‘ad- should be excited. And to.inspire this description of

(Continued from supplement, to No.9, page 160.)  
cases, by the nations in which the estabiishments to  
be imitated, are previously intfoduced. It is well  
known (and particular examples in the course of the  
report will be cited) that certain nations grant  
bounties on the exportation of particular commodi-  
ties, to enable their own workmen to undersel! and  
supplant all competitors, in the countries to which  
those commodities are sent. Hence the undertakers  
of anew manufacture have to contend not only with  
the natural disadvantages of a new undertaking, but  
with the gratuities and remunerations which other  
governments bestow. To be enabled to contend with  
success, it is evident, that the interference and aid  
of their own government are indispensable.  
  
Combinations by those engaged in a particular  
branch of business, in one country, to frustrate the  
first efforts to introduce it into another, by tempo-  
rary sacrifices, recompensed perhaps by extraordi-  
nary indemnifications of the government of such  
country, are believed to have existed, and are not  
to be regarded as destitute of probability. The  
existence or assurance of aid from the government  
of the country, in which the business is to be in-  
troduced, may be essential to fortify adventurers  
against the dread of such combinations—to defeat  
their effects, if formed, and to prevent their being |  
formed, by demonstrating that they must in the  
end prove fruitless.  
  
Whatever room there may be for an expectation  
that the industry of a people, under the direction of  
private interest, will, upon equal terms, find out the  
most beneficial employment for itself, there is nene  
fora reliance, that it will struggle against the force  
of unequal terms, or will, of itself, surmount ail the)  
adventitious barriers to a successful competition, |  
which may have been erected either by the advan-;|  
tages naturally acquired from practice and previous!  
possession of the ground, or by those which may  
have sprung from positive regulations and an arti-  
ficial policy. This general reflection might alone  
suffice as an answer to the objection under exami-|  
nation; exclusively of the weighty considerations)  
which have been particularly urged.  
  
The objections to the pursuit of manufactures in  
the United States, which next present themselves |  
to discussion, represent an impracticability of suc-  
cess, arising from three causes—scarcity of hands,  
dearness of labor, want of capital.  
  
The two first circumstances are, to a certain ex-  
tent, real, and, within due limits, ought to be ad-  
mitted as obstacles to the success of manufacturing  
enterprise in the United States. But there are va-  
rious considerations, which lessen their force, and  
tend to afford an assurance, that they are not suffi-  
cient to prevent the advantageous prosecution of  
Many very useful and extensive manufactories.  
  
_ With regard to the scarcity of hands, the fact

terspersed with flourishing and increasing bey  
  
they are not remote from it, and are approaching  
fast towards it; and having perhaps fewer attrac-  
tions to agriculture, than some other parts of the  
union, they exhibit a proportionably stronger ten-  
dency towards other kinds of industry. In these  
districts, may be discerned, no inconsiderable ma-  
turity for manufacturing establishments.  
  
But there are circumstances, which have been al-  
ready noticed with another view, that materially  
diminish every where the effect of a scarcity of  
hands. These circumstances are—the great use  
which can be made of women and children; on  
which point a very pregnant and instructive fact  
has been mentioned ; the vast extension given by  
late improvements to the employment of machines,  
which substituting the agency of fire and water, has  
prodigiously lessened the necessity for manual la-  
bor—the employinent of persons ordinarily engaged  
in other occupations, during the seasons, or hours of  
leisure~ which, besides giving occasion to the exer-  
tion of a greater quantity of labor by the same num-  
ber of persons, and thereby increasing the general  
stock of labor, as has been elsewhere remarked, may  
ulso be taken into the calculation, as a resource for  
obviating the scarcity of hands—lastly, the attrac-  
tion of foreign emigrants. Whoever inspects with  
a careful eye, the composition of our towns, will be  
made sensible to what an extent this resource may  
be relied upon. . This exhibits a large proportion of  
ingenious and valuable workmen, in different arts  
and trades, who, by expatriating from Europe, have  
improved their own condition, and added to the in-  
dustry and wealth of the United States. It is a na-  
tural inference from the experience, we have already  
had,that as scon as the United States shall present the  
countenance ofa serious prosecution of manufactures,  
as svon as foreign artists shall be made sensible that  
the state of things here affords a moral certainty of  
employmentand encouragement, competent numbers  
of European workmen will transplant themselves,  
effectually to insure the success of the design. How  
indeed can it otherwise happen, considering the va-  
rious and powerful inducements, which the situation  
  
lof this country offers, addressing themselves to so  
  
many strong passions and feelings, to so many gene&lt;  
ral and particular interests ?  
  
It may be affirmed, therefore, in respect to hands  
for carrying on manufactures, that we shall in a great  
measure trade upon a foreign stock; reserving our  
own for the cultivation of our lands, and the manning  
of our ships, as far as character and circumstances  
shall incline.* It is not unworthy of remark, that the  
objection to the-success of manufactures, deduced  
from the scarcity of hands, is alike applicable to  
trade and navigation; and yet these are perceived  
to flourish, without any sensible impediment from  
that cause.  
  
As to the desrness of labor, (another of the ob-  
stacles alleged) this has relation principally to twe  
circumstances ; one, that which has been just discus,  
sed, or the scarcity of hands; the other, the great  
ness of profits. &quot;  
  
As far as it is a consequence of the scarcity of  
hands, it is mitigated by all the considerations  
which have been adduced as lessening that deficien-  
  
* which the complaint of scarcity of hands ceases, cy. It is certaim, too, that the disparity m this re

spect, between some of the most manufacturing  
parts of Europe and a large proportion of the United |  
States, is not nearly so great as is commonly ima-  
gined. [tis also much less m regard to country la-  
borers ; and while a careful comparison shows, that  
there is, in this particular, much exaggeration ; it  
is also evident, that the effect of the degree of dis-  
parity which does truly exist, is diminished in pro-  
portion to the use which can be made of machinery.  
  
To illustrate this last idea—let it be supposed, that  
the difference of price, in two countries, of a given  
quantity of manual labor, requisite to the fabrica-  
tion of a given article, is as ten ; and that some me-  
chanic power is iniroduced into both countries,  
Which, performing half the necessary labor, leaves  
only half to be done by hand, it is evident, that the  
difference in the cost of the fibrication of the arti-  
cle in question, in the two countries, as far as it is  
connected with the price of labor, will be reduced  
from ten to five, in consequence of the introduction  
of that power.  
  
This circumstance is worthy of the most particular  
attention. It diminishes immensely one of the  
OLjections, most strenuously urged, against the  
success of manufactures in the United States.  
  
To procure all such machines as are known in  
any part of Europe, can only require a proper pro-  
Vision and due pains. ‘The knowledge of several of  
the most important of them is already possessed.  
Tie preparation of them here, is, in most cases,  
practicable on nearly equal terms. As far as they  
depend on water, some superiority of advantages

There is evidently, as far as regards the annuity,  
go destruction nor transfer of any other capital, than  
that portion of the income of each individual, which  
goes to make up the annuity. The land, which fur-  
nishes the farmer with the sum which he .s to con-  
tribute, remains the same ; and the like may be ob-  
gerved of other capitals, Indeed, as far.as the tax,  
which is the object of contribution (as frequently  
happens, when it dees not oppress by its weight)  
may have been a motive to a greater exertion in any  
eccupition: it may even serve to increase the con-  
tributory capital : this idea is not without importance  
in the general view of the subject.  
  
t remains to see, what further deduction ought  
to be made from the capital which is created, by the  
existence of the debt, on account of the coin, which  
is employed in its circulation. This is susceptible  
of much less precise calculation than the article  
which has been just discussed. It is impossible to  
say what proportion of coin is necessary to carry on  
tie alienations which any species of property usually  
undergoes. The quantity, indeed, varies according  
to circumstances. But it may still, without hesita-  
tion, be pronounced, from the quickness of the rota-  
tion, or rather of the transitions, that the medium of  
circulation always bears but a small proportion to  
the amount of the property circulated. And it is  
thence satisfactorily deducible, that the coin em-  
ployed in the negociations of the funds, and which  
serves to give them activity, as capital, is incompara-  
bly less than the sum of the debt negociated for the  
purpose of business.  
  
it ought not, however, to be omitted, that the  
negociation of the funds becomes itself a distinct  
business ; which employs, and by employing, diveris  
a portion of the circulating coin from other pursuits.  
But making due allowance for this circumstance,  
there is no reason to conclude, that the effect of the  
diversion of coin in the whole operation bears any  
considerable proportion to the amount of the capital  
to which it gives activity. The sum of the debt in  
circulation is continually at the command of any use-  
ful enterprise, the coin itself which circulates it, is  
never. more than momentarily suspended from its or-  
dinary functions. It experiences an incessant and  
rapid flux and reflux to and from the channel of in-  
dlustry to those of speculations in the funds.  
  
There are strong circumstances in confirmation of  
this theory. The force of monied capital which has  
been displayed in Great Britain, and the height to  
which every species of industry has grown up under  
it, defy a solution from the quantity of coin which  
that kingdom has ever possessed. Accordingly it  
has been, coeval with its funding system, the pre-  
Vailing opinion of the men of busigess, and of the  
generality of the most sagacious theorists of that  
Country, that the operation of the public funds as  
Capital has contribuied to the effect in question.—  
Among ourselves appearances thus far favor the same  
conclusion. . Industry in general seems to have been  
fe-animated, There are symptoms indicating an ex-  
tension of our commerce. Qur navigation has cer.  
  
tunly of late bad a considerable spring, and taere  
  
appears to be in many parts of the union a comma  
  
of capital, which, till lately, since the Schation tt  
least, was unknown... But it is at the same time to  
be acknowledged, that other circumstances have  
concurred (and in a great degree) in producing the  
present state of things, and that the appearances are  
not yet sufficiently decisive to be entirely relied  
upon.  
  
In the question under discussion, it is important  
to distinguish between an absolute increase of capi-  
tal, or an accession of real wealth and an artificial  
increase of capital, as an engine of business, or a$  
an instrument of industry and commerce. In the  
first sense, a funded debt has no pretensions to bei  
deemed an increase of capital; in the last, it has  
pretensions which are not easy to be controverted —  
Of a similar natiwe is bank credit, and, in an inferior  
degree, every species of private credit.  
  
But though a funded debt is not in the first in-  
stance, an absolute increase of capital, or an aug»  
mentation of real wealth; yet by. serving as a new  
power in the operations of industry, it has, within  
certain bounds, a tendency to increase the real wealth  
of acommunity ; in like manner as.meney borrowed  
by a thrifty farmer, to be Jaid out in the improve-  
ment of his farm, may, in the end, add te his stock  
of real riches.  
  
There are respectable individuals, who, from a  
  
just aversion to an accumulation of public debt, are  
  
unwilling to concede to it any kind of utility, who  
can discern no good to alleviate the ill with whicla  
they suppose it pregnant; who cannot be persuaded,  
that it ought in any sense to be viewed as an increase  
of capital, lest it should be inferred, that the more  
debt the mote capital, the greater the burdens the  
greater the blessings of the community.  
  
But it interests the public councils to estimate eve-  
ry object as it truly is; to appreciate how far the  
good in any measure is compensated by the ill; or  
the ill by the good ; either of them is seldom un-  
mixed. ,  
  
Neither will it follow, that an accumulation of  
debt is desirable, because a certain degree of it ope-  
rates as capital. There may bea plethora in the  
political, as in the natural body; there may be a  
state of things in which any such artificial capital is  
unnecessary. The debt too may be swelled to such a  
size, as that the greatest part of it may cease to be  
useful as a capital, serving only to pamper the dissi-  
pation of idle and dissolute individuals: as that the  
sums required topay the interest upon it may become  
oppressive, and beyond the means which a govern.  
ment can employ, consistently with its tranquillity,  
to raise them ; as that the resources of taxation, te  
face the debt, may have been strained too far to ad-  
mit of extensions adequate to exigencies, which re-  
gard the public safety.  
  
Where this critical point is, cannot be pronounced;  
but it is impossible to believe, that there is not such  
a point,  
  
And as the vicissitudes of nations beget a perpe-  
tual tendency to the accumulation of debt, there  
ought to be in every government, a perpetual, aax-  
ious, and unceasing eflart to reduce that which at  
any time exists, as fast as shall be practicable, cone  
sistently with integrity and good faith.  
  
Reasonings on a subject comprehending fdeas se  
abstract and complex, so little reducible to precise  
calculation as those which enter into the question  
just discussed, are always attended with a danger of  
  
running into fallacies. Due allowance ought there-  
  
fore to be made for this possibility—but as far as the  
nature of the subject admits of it, there appears te  
be satisfactory ground for a belief that the public  
  
  
  
funds operate a8 a resource ef capital te the citizens

of the United States, and, if they are a resource at  
all, it is an extensive one.  
  
To all the arguments which are brought to evince  
the impracticability of success in manufacturing es-  
tablishments in the United States,-it might have  
been a sufficient answer to have referred to the ex-  
perience of what has been already done: it is cer-  
tain that several important branches have grown up  
and flourished with a rapidity which surprises ; af-  
fording an encouraging assurance of success in fu-  
ture attempts ; of these it may not be improper to  
enumerate the most considerable—  
  
I. Of skins.—Tanned and tawed leather, dressed  
skins, shoes, boots and slippers, harness and saddlery  
ef all kinds, portmanteaus and trunks, leather  
breeches, gloves, muffs and tippets, parchment and  
glue.  
  
Il. Of iron.—Bar-and sheet iron, steel, nail rods  
and nails, implements of husbandry, stoves, pots and  
other household utensils, the steel and iron work of  
carriages, and for ‘ship building, anchors, scale |  
beams, and weights, and various tools of artificers, |  
arms of different kinds, though the manufacture of&#x27;|  
#hese last has of late diminished for want of demand. |  
  
Ill. Of wood.—Siips, cabinet wares and turnery, |  
wool and cotton cards, and other machinery for ma-|  
nufactures and husbandry, mathematical imstru-;  
ments, coopers wares of every kind.  
  
1V. Of fax and hemp.—Cables, sail-cloth, cord-|  
age, twine and packthread.  
  
Y. Bricks and coarse tiles, and potters’ wares.  
  
VI. Ardent spirits, and malt liquors.  
  
VII. Writing and printing paper, sheathing and  
wrapping paper, pasteboards, fullers’ or press pa-|  
pers, paper hangings.  
  
Vill. Hats of fur and wool, andof mixtures of  
both. Women’s stuff and silk shoes.  
  
1X. Refined sugars.  
  
X. Oils of animals and seeds, soap, spermaceti  
  
and tallow candles.  
_ XI. Copper and brass wares, particularly utensils |  
for distillers, sugar-refiners and brewers, andirons |  
and other articles for household use—philosophical |  
apparatus.  
  
X1I. Tin wares, for most purposes of ordinary  
use.  
  
Xfil. Carriages of all kinds.  
  
XIV. Snuff, chewing and smoking tobacco.  
  
XV. Starch. and hair powder.  
  
XVI. Lampblack and other painters’ colours.  
  
XVII. Gunpowder.  
  
Besides manufactories of these articles, which are  
earried on as regular trades, and have attained to a  
considerable degree of maturity, there is a vast  
scene of household manufacturing, which contri-  
butes more largely to the supply of the community,  
than could be imagined, without having made it an  
object of particular enquiry. This observation is  
the pleasing result of the investigation to which the  
subject of this report has led,and is spplicable as well  
to the southern,as to the middle and northern staies ;

es. . The importance of sO great a progress, a%  
appears to have been made in family manufactures,  
within a. few. years, both ina moral and political  
view, renders the fact highly interesting.  
  
Neither does the above enumeration comprehend  
all the articles that are manufactured as regular  
trades. Many others occur, which are equally well  
established, but which not being of equal: importance  
have been omitted. And there are many attempts  
still in their infancy, which, though attended with  
very favorable appearances, could not have been  
properly comprised in an enumeration of manufac.  
tories already established. There are other articles  
also of great- importance, which, though strictly  
speaking, manufactures, are omitted, as being im-  
mediately connected with husbandry: such are flour,  
pot and pearl ash, pitch, tar, turpentine, and the  
like.  
  
There remains to be noticed, an objection to thie  
encouragement of manufactures, of a nature differ.  
ent from those which question the probability of suc-  
cess—this is derived from its supposed tendency to  
give a monopoly of advantages to particular classés,at  
the expense of tne ‘rest of the community, who, it  
is affirmed, would be able to procure the requisite  
supplies of manufactured articles, on better terms  
from foreigners, than from our own citizens, and  
who, it is alleged, are reduced to a necessity of  
paying an enhanced price for whatever they want,  
by every measure, Wiich-obstructs the free compe-  
tition of foreign commodities. |  
  
li isan unreasonable supposition, that measures  
wiich serve to abridge the free competition of fo-  
reign articles, have atendency to occasion an en-  
hancement of prices, and it is not denied, that such  
is the effect of a number of cases: but the fact  
does not uniformly correspond with the theory. A  
reduction of prices has, in several instances, imme-  
diately succeeded the establishment of a domestic  
manufacture. Whether it be that foreign manufac-  
turers endeavors to supplant by underselling our  
own, or Whatever else be the cause, the effect has  
been such as is stated, and the reverse of what might  
have been expected.  
  
But though it’were true, that the immediate and  
certain effect of regulations controuling the compe-  
tition of foreign with domestic fabrics, was an in-  
crease of price, it is universally true, that the con-  
trary is the ultimate effect with every successful ma-  
nufacture. When a domestic manufacture has attain-  
ed to perfection, and has engaged in the prosecution  
of it a competent number of persons, it invariably be-  
comes cheaper. Being free from the heavy charges  
which attend the importation of foreign commodities,  
it can be afforded, and accordingly seldom or never  
fails to be sold cheaper, in process of time, than was  
the foreign articie for which itis a substitute. The  
internal competition, which takes place, soon does  
away every thing like monopoly, and by degrees re-  
duces the price of the article to the minimum of a  
reasonable profit on the capital employed. This  
accords with the reason of the thing and with ex-  
perience.  
  
Whence it follows, that it is the interest of the  
community, with a view to eventual and permanent  
economy, to encourage the growth of manufactures,  
in a national view, a temporary enhancement of  
price must always. be well compensated by a perma-  
nent reduction of it.  
  
It is a reflection, which may with propriety b¢  
indulged here, that this eventual diminution of the  
prices of manufactured articles, which is the result  
of internal manufacturing establishments, has a di-  
rect and very important tendency to benefit agricul-  
ture. It-enables the farmer to procure, with @

mate-  
rially strengthened by a few general and some par-  
ticular topics, which have been naturally reserved  
for subsequent notice.  
  
I. There seems to be a moral certainty that the  
trade of a country, which is both manufacturing and  
agricultural, will be more lucrative and prosperous,  
than that of a country which is merely agricultu-  
ral.  
  
One reason for this is found in that general effort  
of nations (which has been already mentiened) to  
procure from their own soils, the articles of prime  
necessity requisite to their own consumption and  
ase; and which serves to render their demand fora  
foreign supply of such articles in a great degree oc-  
casional and contingent. Hence, while the necessi-  
ties of nations exclusively devoted to agriculture,  
for the fabrics of manufacturing states, are con-  
stant and regular, the wants of the latter for the  
  
roducts of the former, are liable to very considera-  
bie fluctuations and interruptions. The great ine-  
qualities, resulting from difference of seasons, have  
been elsewhere remarked: this uniformity of de-  
mand, on one side, and unsieadiness of it on the  
  
ethers—and the prompt and advantageous sale of  
those articles which are in demand, enables its  
merchants the better to wait for a favorable change,  
in respect to those which are not. There is ground  
to. believe, that a diflerence of situation, in this par-  
ticular, has immensely. different effects upon the  
wealth and prosperity of nations.  
  
From these circumstances collectively, two im+  
portant inferences are to be drawn; one, that there  
is always a higher probability of a favorable ba-  
lance of trade, in regard to countries, in which  
manufactures, founded on the basis of a thriving’  
agriculture, flourish, than in regard to those, which  
are confined wholly, or almost wholly, to agricul-  
ture; the other, (which is also a consequence of the  
first) that couatries of the former description are  
likely to possess more pecuniary wealth, or money,  
than those of the laiter.  
  
Facts appear to correspond with this conclusior.  
The importation of manufactured supplies, seem in-  
variably to drain the merely agricultural people of  
their wealth. Let the situation of the manufactur-  
  
ing countries of Europe, be compared in this parti- ~  
  
cular, with that of countries winch only cultivate,  
and the disparity will be striking. Other causes, it  
is true, help to account for this disparity between  
some of them; and among these causes, the rela-  
tive state of agriculture; but between others of  
them, the most prominent circumstance of dissimili-  
tude arises from the comparative state of manufac-  
tures. In corroboration of the same idea, it ought  
not to escape remark, that the West India islands,  
the soils of which are the most fertile, and the na-  
  
  
  
other, must necessarily have a tendency to cause the  
eneral course of the exchange of commodities  
Bet ween the parties, to turn to the disadvantage  
of the merely «gricultural states. Peculiarity of

nies, which now compose the United States, appear-  
ed to be inadequate to their circulation ; and their  
debt to Great Britain was progressive. Since the  
‘revolution, the states, in which manufactures have  
‘most increased, have recovered fastest from the in-

It ought to be admitted, however, in this as in  
the preceding case, that causes, irrelative to the  
state of manufactures, account, in a degree, for the  
  
new settlements, las a natural tendency to occasion  
an unfavorable balance of trade; though it indem-  
nifies for the inconvenience, by that increase of the  
national capital, which flows from the conversion  
of waste into improved lands: and the different de-

The possession of these is necessary to the per-  
ction of the body politic, to. the safety as well as  
tlie welfare of the society: the want of either, is  
tlie want of an’ important organ of political life and.  
MOtion; and in the various crisis which await a state,  
it: must severely feel the effects of such deficiency.  
Fhe extreme embarrassment of the United States,  
during the late war, from an incapacity of supply-.  
ing themselves, are still matter of keen recollection:  
2 future war might be expected again te exemplify  
the mischiefs and dangers of a situation, to whieh  
that ineapeeity is still in too greata degree appli-  
cable, uvless changed by timely and vigorous exer-  
tions. &#x27;Fo-effect ‘this change, as fast as shall be  
prudent, merits all the attention, and all the zeal of  
‘our public counsels ; ’tis the next great work to be  
accomplished.  
  
Fhe want of a navy to pace our external com-  
meree, as long as it shall-continue, must render it  
a peciliarly precarious reliance, for the supply of  
essentyél articles, and must serve to strengthen pro-  
mo Nae the arguments in favor of manutactures.  
Fo these general considerations are added some of  
@ more particular nature. _  
  
@ur distance from Europe, the great fountain of  
manufactured supply, sabjects us, in the existing  
state of things, to inconvenience and loss in two  
ways.  
  
The builkiness of those commodities which are the  
ehief produetions of the soil, necessarily imposes  
  
“¥ery heavy charges on their transportation, to dis-  
  
@ant markets. These charges, in the cases, in which  
the nations, to whom our products are sent, main-  
tain a competition in the supply of their own mar-  
kets, principally fall upon us, and form material de-  
‘ductions from the primitive value of the articles fur-  
nished. ‘The charges on manufactured supplies,  
brought from Europe, are greatly enhanced by the  
same circumstance of distance. These charges,  
  
again, in the cases in. which our own industry main-  
  
tains no competition, incur own markets, also prin-  
cipally fall upon us; and are an additional cause of  
extraordinary deduction from the primitive value of  
our own products ; these being the materials of ex-  
change for the fereign fabrics, which we consume.  
  
Theequality and moderation of individual proper-  
ty, and the growing settlements of new districts,  
eccasion, in this country, an unusual demand for  
Coarse manufactures ; the charges of which being  
greater in proportion to their greater bulk, augment  
the disacivantage, which has been just described.  
  
As in most countries domestic supplies maintain a  
very considerable competition with such foreign pro-  
ductions of the soil, as are imported for sale; if the  
extensive establishment of manufactories in the U.  
States does not create a similar eompetition in re-  
spect to manufactured articles, it appears to be clear-  
ly deducible, from the considerations which have  
Been mentioned, that they must sustain a double loss  
in their exchanges with foreign nations; strongly  
eonducive to an unfavorable balance of trade, and  
very prejudicial to their interests. |  
  
These disadvantages press with no small weight,  
ga the landed interest of the country. In seasons of  
peace, they cause a serious deduction from the in.  
trinsic value of the products of the soil. In the  
which should either involve our-  
  
share of our carrying trade, the charges on the trans-  
portation of our commodities, bulky as most of them  
are, could hardly fail to prove a grievous burden t:  
the farmer, while obliged to depend in so great de-  
gree as he now does, upon foreign markets for the  
vent for the surplus of his labor.  
  
As far as the prosperity of tire fisheres of thel  
  
United States is impeded by the want of an aceqtiate  
market, there arises another special reason. for de.  
siting the extension of manufactures. Besides the  
fish, which, in many places, would be likely to  
make a part of the subsistence of the persons em.  
ployed ; it is known, that the oils, bones, and skins  
of marine animals, are of extensive use in varions  
manufactures. Hence the prospect of an additional  
demand for the predtee of the fisheries. __  
  
One more point of view only remains, in which ty  
consider the expediency of encouraging manufac.  
tures in the United States.  
  
It is not uncommon to meet with an opinion, that  
though the promoting of manufactures, may be the  
interest of apart of the union, it is contrary to that  
of another part. The northern and southern regions  
are sometimes represented as having adverse inter.  
ests in ‘this respect. ‘Fhose are called manufactur.  
ing, these agricultural states; and » species of o  
position is imagined to subsist between the manufac.  
turing and agricultural interest.  
  
This idea of an opposition between those two ‘in.  
terests is the common errer of the early periods of  
every country; but experience gradually dissipates  
it. Indeed they are perceived so often to succour  
and to betiriend each other, that they come at length  
to be considered as one ; asupposition which has  
been frequently abused, and is not universally true.  
Particular encouragements of particular manufac.  
tures may be of a nature to sacrifice the interests of  
landholders to those of manufacturers ; but it is ne-  
vertheless a maxim well established by experience,  
and generally acknowledged where there has been  
sufficient experience, that the “aggregate” prosperi-  
ty of manufactures, and the “aggregate” prosperity  
of agriculture are intimately connected. In the  
course of the discussion which has had place, various  
weighty considerations have been adduced operating  
in support of that maxim. Perhaps the superior  
steadiness of the demand of a domestic market for  
the surplus produce of the soil, is alone a convincing  
argument of its truth.  
  
Ideas of a contrariety of interests between the  
northern and southern regions of the unien,. are ir  
the main unfounded as they are mischievous. The  
diversity of circumstances, on which such contra-  
riety is usually predicated, authorises a directly con-  
trary conclusion. Mutual wants constitute one of  
the strongest links of political connexion: and the  
extent of these bears a natural proportion to the di-  
versity in the means of mutual supply.  
  
Suggestions of an opposite complexion, are ever  
to be deplored, as tsrieghlly to the steady pursuit  
of one great common cause, and to the perfect har-  
meny of. all the parts. )  
  
In proportion as the mind is accustomed to trace  
the intimate connexion of interest, which subsists  
between all the parts of a society, united under the  
same government—the infinite variety of channels  
which serve to circulate the prosperity of each te  
and through the rest—in that proportion it will be  
little apt to be disturbed by solicitudes and appre-  
aensions, Which originate in local discriminations.—

by the reflection, that Virginia embraces the same  
latitudes with the finest wool countries in Europe.  
The climate of the south is also better adapted to  
the production of silk.  
  
The extensive cultivation of cotton, can, perhaps,  
hardly be expected, but from the previous establish-  
ment of domestic manufactories of the article ; and  
the surest encouragement and vent for the others,  
would result from similar establishments in respect  
to them.  
  
I, then, it satisfactorily appears, that it is the in-  
terest of the United States, generally, to encourage  
manufactures, it merits particular attention, that  
there are circumstances which renders the present  
a critical moment for entering with zeal upon the  
important business. The effort cannot fail to be  
materially seconded by a considerable and increasing  
influx of money, in consequence of foreign specula-  
tions in the funds, and by the disorders which exist  
in different parts of Europe.  
  
The first circumstance not only facilitates the  
execution of manufacturing enterprises: but it in-  
dicates them as a necessary mean to turn the thing  
itself to advantage, and to prevent its being even-  
tually an evil. If useful employments be not found  
for the money of foreigners, brought to the country  
to be invested in purchases of the public debt, it  
will quickly be re-exported to defray the expense o!  
an extraordinary consumption of foreign luxuries ;  
and distressing drains of our specie, may hereafter  
be experienced, to pay, the interest and redeem the  
principal of the purchased debt.

To find pleasure in the calamities of other na‘  
tions, would be criminal: but to benefit ourselves,  
by opening an asylum to those who suffer, in conse-  
quence of them, is as justifiable as jt js politic.  
  
A full view having now been taken of the induce.  
ments to the promotion of Manufactures in the U,  
States, accompanied with an examination of the  
principal objections which areé commonly urged in  
opposition, it is proper, in the next place, to consi-  
der the means by which it may be effected, as in-  
troductory to a specification of the objects, which,  
in the present state of things, appear the most fit to  
be encouraged, and of the particular measures  
which it may be advisable to adopt, in respect to  
each.  
  
In order to a better judgment of the means pra-  
per to be resorted to by the United States, it will be  
of use to advert to those which have been employed  
with success in other countries. The principal of  
there are—  
  
I. Protecting duties—or duties on those foreign  
articles which are the rivals of the domestic ones in-  
tended to be encouraged.  
  
Duties of this nature ev dently amount to a vir  
tual bounty on the domest.c f-bries, since, by en-  
hancing the charges on for-ign urticles, they enable  
the national manufacturers to un‘ersell all their fo-  
reign competitors. The propriety of this species  
of encouragement, need not to be dwelt upon ; as it

which have been suggested, but is sanctioned by the

the United  
States, and there are other cases, to which the prin-  
  
‘ciple may be advantageously extended: but they are  
  
not numerous.  
  
Considering a monopoly of the domestic market to  
its own manufacturers, as the reigning policy of  
manufacturing nations, a similar policy, en the part  
of the United States, in every proper instance, is dic-  
tated, it might almost be said,by the principles of dis-  
tributive justice : certainly by the duty of endea-  
voring to secure to its citizens, a reciprocity of ad-  
Vantages.  
  
If. Prohibitions of the exportation of the mate-  
rials of manufactures.  
  
The desire of securing a clieap and plentiful sup-  
ply for the national workmen, and, where the article  
is either peculiar to the country, or of peculiar qua-  
lity there, the jealousy of enabling foreign workmen,  
to rival those of the nation, with its own materials,  
  
are the leading motives to this species of regulation.  
  
{It ought not to be affirmed, that it is in no instance  
proper; but it it is certainly one which ought to be  
adopted with great circumspection, and only in very  
plain cases. It is scen at once, that its immediate  
operation is to abridge the demand and keep down  
the price of the produce of some other branch of  
industry, generally speaking, of agriculture, to the  
prejudice of those who carry it on ; and though, if  
it be really essential to the prosperity of any very  
important national manufacture, it may happen that  
those who are injured, in the first instance, may be  
eyentually indemnified, by the superior steadiness  
of an extensive domestic market, depending on  
that prosperity; yet ina matter, in which there is  
so much room for nice and difficult combinations,  
in which such opposite considerations combat each  
other, prudence seems to dictate, that the expedient  
i question, ought to be indulged with a sparing  
hand.  
  
IV. Pecuniary bounties.  
  
This has been found one of the most efficacious  
Means of encotiraging manufactures, and it is, in  
some views, the best. Though it has not yet been  
practised upon by the government of the United  
States (unless the allowance of the exportation of  
dried and pickled fish and salted meat could be con-  
sidered as a bounty) and though it is less favored  
by public opinion, than some other modes—its ad-  
vantages are these— i  
  
1. It is a species of encouragement more positive  
and direct than any other, and for that very reason,  
has a more immediate tendency to stimulate and up-  
hold new enterprizes, increasing the chances of  
profit, and diminishing the risques of loss, in the  
first attempts.  
  
9. It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary aug-  
mentation of price, which is incident to some other  
modes,or it produces it toa less degree; either by  
making no addition to the charges on the rival fo-  
reign article, as in the case of protecting duties, or  
by making a smaller addition. The first happens  
when the fund for the bounty is derived from a dif:  
  
ferent object, (which may, or may not, increase the  
price of some other article, according to the nature  
of that object) ; the second, when the fund is de-  
rived from the same or a similar object of foreign  
manufacture. One per cent. dufy on the foreign ar-  
ticle, converted into a bounty on the domestic, will  
have an equal effect with a duty of two per cent. ex.  
clusive of such bounty; and the price of the foreign  
commodity is liable to be raised, in the one case, in  
the proportion of one per cent. in the other, in that  
of two per cent. Indeed, the bounty, when drawn  
from another source, is calcwlated to promote a re-  
duction of price; because, *ithout laying any new  
charge on the foreign article, it serves to introduce  
a competition with it, and to increase the total quan-  
tity of the article inthe market.  
  
3. Bounties have not, like high protecting duties,  
a tendency to produce scarcity. An increase of  
price is not always the immediate, though, where  
the progress of a domestic manufacture does not  
counteract a rise, it is commonly the ultimate effect  
of an additional duty. In the interval, between the  
laying of the duty and a proportionable increase af  
price, it may discourage importation, by interfering  
with the profits to be expected from the sule of the  
article.  
  
4. Bounties are sometimes not only the best, but  
the only proper expedient, for uniting the encou-  
ragement of a new object of agriculture with that  
of a new object of manufacture. It is the interest  
of the farmer to have the production of the raw ma-  
terial promoted, by counteracting the interference  
of the foreign material of the same kind. It is the  
interest of the manufacturer to have the material  
abundant and cheap. If, prior to the domestic pro-  
duction of the material, in sufficient quantity, to  
supply the manufacturer on good terms, a duty be  
laid upon the importation of it from abroad, witha  
view to promote the raising of it at home, the inte-  
rest both of the farmer and manufacturer will be  
disserved. By either destroying the requisite sup-  
ply, or raising the price of the article, beyond what  
cannot be afforded to be given for it, by the condue-  
torof an infant manufacture, it is abandoned or  
fails; and there being no domestic manufactories  
to create ademand for the raw materia!, which is  
raised by the farmer, it is in vain, that the competi-  
tion of the like foreign article, may have been de-  
stroyed.  
  
It cdnnot escape notice, that a duty upon the im-  
portation of an article can no o:herwise aid the do-  
mestic production of it, than by giving the latter  
greater advantages in the home market. It can have  
no influence upon the advantageous sale of the arti-  
cle produced, in foreign markets; no tendency,  
therefore, to promote its exportation.  
  
The true way to conciliate these two interests, iS  
to lay aduty on foreign manufactures of the mate-  
rial, the growth of which is desired to be encourag-  
ed, and to apply the produce of that duty by way  
vf bounty, either upon the production of the mate-  
rial itself, or upon its manufacture at home, or upon  
both. In this disposition of the thing, the manufac-  
turer commences his enterprise, under every advan-  
tage, which is attainable as to quantity or price of  
the raw material ; and the farmer, if the bounty be  
immediately given, is enabled by it to enter into a  
successful competition with the foreign material ;  
if the bounty be to the manufacturer on so much  
of the domestic material as he consumes, the opera-  
tion is nearly the same; he has a motive of inte-  
rest to prefer the domestic commodity, if of equal  
quality, even at a higher price thas the foreign, so  
  
  
  
  
  
long as the difference of price is “ thing short of  
the bounty, which is allowed upon the article.

such case, that there were natural and inherent im-  
pediments to success. But in new undertakings,  
they are justifiable, as they are oftentimes necessary.  
  
There is a degree of prejudice against bounties,  
from an appearance of giving away the public mo-  
ney, without an immediate consideration, and froma  
supposition, that they serve to enrich particular  
classes, at the expense of the community.  
  
But neither of these sources of dislike will bear  
serious examination. There is no purpose to which  
public money can be more beneficially applied, than  
to the acquisition of anew and useful branch of in-  
dustry; no considerations more valuable than a  
permanent addition to the general stock of produc-  
tive labor.  
  
As to the second source of objection, it equally  
lies against other modes of encouragement which  
are admitted to be eligible. As often as a duty up-  
on a foreign article makes an addition to its price, it  
causes an extra expense to the community, for the  
benefit of the domestic manufacture. A bounty  
does no more. But it is the interest of the society,  
in each case, to submit to a temporary expense,  
  
which is more than compensated, by an increase of  
  
industry and wealth—by an augmentation of resour-  
  
ces and independence—and by the circumstances of  
  
eventual cheapness, which has been noticed in ano-  
ther place.  
  
It would deserve attention, however, in the em-  
ployment of this species of encouragement in the  
United States, as a reason for moderating the degree  
of it in the instances in which it might be deemed  
eligible, that the great distance of this country from  
Europe imposes very heavy charges on all the fabrics  
which are brought from thence, amounting from 15  
to SU per cent. on their value, according to their  
bulk.  
  
A question has beer made, concerning the consti-  
tutional right of the government of the United  
  
States to apply this species of encouragement; but.  
  
there is certainly no good foundation for such a ques-  
tion. The national legislature has express authori

be no room for a doubt, that whatever concerns the  
eneral interests of learning, of agriculture, of manu-  
fuctures, and of commerce, are within the sphere  
of the national councils, as far as regards an appli-  
cation of money.  
  
The only qualification of the generality of the  
phrase in question, which seems to be admissible, is  
this—that the object, to which an appropriation of  
money is to be made, be general and not local; its  
operation, extending in fact, or by possibility,  
  
throughout the union, and not being confined to a  
  
p rticular spot.  
  
No objection ought to arise to this construction,  
|from a supposition that it would imply a power to do  
\whatever else should appear to congress conducive  
to the general welfare. A power to appropriate mo-  
ney, With this latituce, which is granted too in  
express terms, would not carry a power to do any  
other thing, not authorised in the constitution, ei-  
ther expressly or by fair implication.  
  
V. Premiums.  
  
These are of a nature allied to bounties, though  
distinguishable from them in some important fea~  
tures.  
  
Bounties are applicable to the whole quantity af  
an article produced or manufactured, or exported,  
and involve a correspondent expense; premiums  
serve to reward some particular excellence or supe-  
riority, some extraordinary exertion or skill, and  
  
  
  
are dispensed only in a small number of cases. But  
their eftect is to stimulate general effort: contrived  
‘so as to be both honorary and lucrative, they address  
themselves to different passions ; touching the chords  
‘as well of emulation as of interest. They are ace  
cordingly a very economical mean of exciting the  
enterprise of a whole community.  
  
There are various societies in different countries,  
whose object is the dispensation of premiums for the  
lencouragement of agriculture, arts, manufactures,  
and commerce : and though they are, for the most  
part, voluntary associations, with comparatively  
slender funds, their utility has been immense. Much

amelioration of condition. From a similar establish-  
ment in the United States, supplied and supported  
by the government of the union, vast benefits might  
reasonably be expected. Some further ideas on this  
head, shall accordingly be submitted in the conclu-  
sion of this report.  
  
VI. The exemption of the materials of manufac.  
tures from duty, .  
  
The policy of that exemption, as a general rule,  
particularly in reference to new establishments, is  
obvious. It can hardly ever be advisable to add the  
obstructions of fiscal burdens to the difficulties  
which naturally embarrass a new manufacture ; and  
where it is matured and in condition to become ap  
object of revenue, it is, generally speaking, better  
that the fabric, than the material, should he the

subject of taxation. Ideas of proportion between  
the quantum of the tax and the value of the articie  
can be more easily adjusted in the former than in the  
lawer case. An argument for exemptions of this  
kind in the United States, is to be derived from the  
practice, as far as their necessities have permitted,  
of those nations whom we are to meet as competi-  
tors in our own and in foreign markets.  
  
There are, however, exceptions to it; of which  
some examples will be given under the next head.  
  
Tie laws of the union afford instances of the ob-  
Servance of the policy here recommended; but it  
will probably be found advisable to extend it to some  
other cases. Of a nature, bearing some affinity to  
that policy, is the regulation which exempts from  
duty the tools and implements, as well as the books,  
clothes, and household furniture of foreign artists,  
who come to reside in the United States; an advan-  
tage already secured to them by the laws of the  
union, and which, it is in every view, proper to con-  
tinue. ~  
  
VII. Drawbacks of the duties which are imposed  
on the materials of manufactures.  
  
_Tt has already been observed, as a general rule,  
that duties on those materials ought, with certain  
exceptions, to be forborne. Of these exceptions,  
three cases occur, which may serve as examples—  
one, where the material is itself an object of general  
or extensive consumption, and a fit and productive  
source of revenue: another, where a manufacture of  
a simpler kind, the competition of which with a like  
domestic article is desired to be restrained, partakes  
of the nature of a raw material, from being capa-  
ble by a farther process, to be converted into a ma-  
nufacture of a different kind, the introduction or  
growth of which is desired to be encouraged; a  
third, where the material itself is a production of  
the country, and in sufficient abundance to turnish  
a cheap and plentiful supply to the national manu-  
facturers.  
  
Under the first description comes the article of  
molasses. It is not only a fair object of revenue, but  
being a sweet, it 1s just that the consumers of it

the United States of such as may have been made in  
other countries; particularly those which relate to  
machinery.  
  
This is among the most useful and unexceptiona-  
ble of the aids which can be given to manufactures.  
‘The usual means of that encouragement are pecunia-  
ry rewards, and, for atime, exclusive privileges.—  
The first must be employed, according to the occa-  
sion, and the utility of the invention or discovery. —  
For the last, so far as respects “authors and inven-  
tors,” provision has been made by law. But it is  
desirable, in regard to improvements and secrets of  
extraordinary value, to be able to extend the same  
benefit to introducers, as well as authors and inven-  
tors; a policy which has been practised with advan-  
tage in other countries. Here, however, as in some  
other cases, there is cause to regret, that the com-  
petency of the authority of the national government  
to the good, which might be done, is not without a  
question. Many aids might be given to industry—  
many internal mprovements of primery magnitude  
might be promoted, by an authority operating  
throughout the union, which cannot be effected, as  
well, if at all, by an authority confined within the  
limits of a single state.  
  
But if the legislature of the union cannot do all  
the good that might be wished, it is at least desira-  
bie, that all may be done which is practicable.—  
Means for promoting the introduction of foreign im-  
provements, though less efficaciously than might be  
accomplished with more adequate authority, will  
form a part of the plan intended to be submitted in  
the close of this report.  
  
itis customary with manufacturing nations to pro-  
hibit, under severe penalties, the exportationof im-  
plements and machines, which they have either in-  
vented or improved. There are already objects for  
a similar regulation in the United States ; and others  
may be expected to occur from time to time. The  
adoption of it seems to be dictated by the principle  
}of reciprocity. Greater liberality, in such respects,  
might better comport with the general spirit of the  
  
  
  
&#x27; 4 J . ° Py .  
/country ; buta selfish and exclusive policy in other  
  
should pay&#x27;a duty as well as the consumers of su-| quarters will not always permit the free indulgence  
  
ar.  
Cottons and linen in their white state fall under  
  
the second description—a duty upon such as are im-  
ported is proper to promote the domestic manufac-  
ture of similar articles in the same state—a draw-  
back of that duty is proper to encourage the print-  
ing and staining at home of those which are brought  
from abroad. When the first of these manufactures  
has attained sufficient maturity in a country, to fur-  
nish a full supply for the second, the utility of the  
drawback ceases.  
  
The article of hemp. either now does or may be  
expected soon to exemplify the third case, in the  
United States  
  
Where duties on the materials of manufactures  
  
‘e not laid ‘for the purpose of preventing a compe-  
tition with some domestic production, the same rea-  
sons which recommend, as a general rule, the ex-  
emption of those materials from duties, would re-  
commend, as a like genera] rule, the allowance of  
drawbacks in favor of the manufacturer ; according-  
ly, such drawbacks are familiar in countries which  
systematically pursue the business of manufactures;  
which furnishes an argument of the observance of a

of aspirit, which would place us upon an unequal  
footing. As far as prohibitions tend to prevent fo-  
reign Competitors from deriving the benefit of the  
improvements made at home, they tend to increase  
the advantages of those by whom they may have

1X. Judicious regulations for the inspection of  
manufactured commodities.  
  
This is not among the least important of the means,  
by which the prosperity of manufactures may be pro-  
moted. Itis indeed in many cases one of the most  
essential. Contributing to prevent frauds upon con-  
sumers at home, and exporters to foreign countries—  
to improve the quality and preserve the character of  
the national manufactures, it cannot fail to aid the  
expeditious and advantageous’sale of them, and to  
serve as a guard against successful competition from  
other quarters. The reputation of the flour and  
lumber of some states, and of the potash of others,  
  
  
  
  
  
has been established by an attention to this point.—

ioration of the public roads of  
that kingdom, and the great progress which has  
been of late made in opening canals.  
the United States stand much in need ; for the lat-  
ter they present uncommon facilities.  
  
‘The symptoms of attention to the improvement of  
  
inland navigation, which have lately appeared in|  
  
some quarters, must fill with pleasure every breast  
warmed with a true zeal for the prosperity of the  
country. These examples, it is to be hoped, will  
stimulate the exertions of the government and citi-  
zens of every state.  
ject more worthy of the cares of the local adminis-  
trations ; and it were to be wished, that there was  
no doubt of the power of the national goverment to  
lend its direct aid ona comprehensive plan. This is  
one of those improvements, which could be prose-  
cuted with more efficacy by the whole, than by any  
partor parts of the union. There are cases in which  
the general interest will be in danger to be sacrificed  
to the collision of some supposed iacal interests. Jea-  
lousies, in matters of this kind, are as apt to exist,  
as they are apt to be erroneous.  
  
The following remarks are sufficiently judicious  
and pertinent to deserve a literal quotation: “good  
roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminishing  
the expense of carriage, put the remote parts of a  
country more nearly upon a level with those in the  
neighborhood of. the town. They are, upon that ac-  
count, the greatest of all improvements. They en-  
courage the cultivation of the remote, which must  
always be the most extensive circle of the country.  
They are advantageous to the town,by breaking down  
the monopoly of the country :n its neighbor! ood. They  
are advantageous even to that part of the country.  
Though they introduce some rival commodities into  
the old market, they open many new markets to its  
produce. Monopoly, besides, is a great enemy to  
good management, which can never be universally  
established, but in consequence of that free and uni-  
versal competition, which forces every body to have  
recourse to it, for the sake of self-defence. It is  
not more than fifty years ago that some of the coun-  
ties in the neighborhood of London petitioned the  
parliament, against the extension of the turnpike  
roads, into the remoter counties. These remoter  
counties, they pretended, from the cheapness of&#x27;Ia-  
bor, would be able to sell their grass and corn cheap-  
er in the London market, than themselves, and they  
would thereby reduce their rents and ruin their cul-  
tivation. Their rents, however, have risen, and  
their cultivation has been improved, since that time.”  
  
Of the former, |  
  
verned the counties, here spoken of, present them-  
selves too frequently to the eye of an impartial ob-  
server, and render it a wish of patriotism, that the  
body in this country, in whose councils a local or  
partial spirit is least likely to predominate, were at  
liberty to pursue and promote the general interest, 11  
those instances, in which there might be danger of  
the interference of such a spirit.  
  
The foregoing are the principal of the means, by  
which the growth of manufactures is ordinarily pro-  
moted. It is, however, not merely necessary, that  
the measures of government, which have a direct  
view to manufactures, should be calculated to assist  
and protect them; but that those, which only colla-  
teraliy aficct them in the general course of the ad-  
ministration, should be guarded from any peculiar  
tendency to injure them.  
  
There are certain species of taxes, which are apt  
to be oppressive to different parts of the community,  
and, among other ill effects, have a very unfriendly  
aspect towards manufactures. All poll or capitation  
taxes are of this nature. They either proceed ac-  
cording to a fixed rate which operates unequally, and  
injuriously to the industrious poor; or they vest a  
discretion in certain officers, to make estimates and  
assessments,’ which are necessarily vague, and con-  
jectural, and liable to abuse. hey ought, there-  
tore, to be abstained from, in all but cases of dis-  
tressing emergency.  
  
All such taxes (including all taxes on occupations)  
Which proceed according to the amount of capital  
supposed to be employed in a business, or of profits  
  
There can certainly be no ob-| supposed to be made in it, are unavoidably hurtful  
  
to industry. It is in vain that the evil may be endea-  
Voured to be mitigated by leaving it, in the first in-  
Stance, in the option of the party to be taxed, to de-  
clare the amount of his capital or profits.  
  
Men engaged in any trade or business have com-  
monly weighty reasons to avoid disclosures, which  
would expose, with any thing like aecurzcy, the real  
state of their affairs. They most frequently find it  
better to risk oppression, than to avail themselves of  
so inconvenient a refuge. And the consequence is,  
that they often suffer oppression.  
  
When the disclosure, too, if made, is not defini-  
itive, but controlable by the discretion, or, in other  
words, by the passions and prejudices of the revenue  
officers, it is not only an ineffectual protection, but  
the possibility of its being so, is an additional reason  
for not resorting to it.  
  
Allowing to the public officers the most equitable  
dispositions—yet where they are to exercise a discre-  
tion without certain data, they cannot fail to be of-  
ten misled by appearances. The quantity of busi-  
ness which seems to be going on, is, in a vast,num-  
ber of cases, a very deceitful criterion of the pro-  
fits which are made; yet it is, perhaps, the best  
they can have, and itis the one on which they will  
most naturally rely. A business, therefore, which  
may rather require aid, from the government, than  
be in a capacity to be contribtrtory to it, may find  
itself crushed by the mistaken conjectures, of the  
assessors of taxes.  
  
Arbitrary taxes, under which denomination are  
comprised all those, that leave the quantum of the  
tux to be raised on each person, to the discretion of  
certain officers, are as contrary to the genius of li-  
berty as to the maxims of industry. In this light  
  
ers on government, who have bestowed upon them  
the severest epithets of reprobation; as’ constitnt-  
ing one of the worst features usually to be met with  
in the practice of despotic governments.

It is certain, at least, that such taxes are particu-  
larly inimical to the success of manufacturing indus-  
try, and ought carefully to be avoided by a govern-  
ment, which desires to promote it.  
  
The great copiousness of the subject of this re-|  
port has insensibly led to a more lengthy prelimi-  
nary discussion, than was originally contemplated |  
or intended. It appeared proper to investigate prin-  
ciples, to PNY it objections, and to endeavor to  
establish the utility of the thing proposed to be  
encouraged previous to the specification of the ob-  
jects which might occur, as meriting or requiring  
encouragement, and of the measures which might  
be proper in respect to each. The first purpose!  
having been fulfilled, it remains to pursue tne second.)  
  
In the selection of objects, five circumstances seem  
entitled to particular attention: the capacity of the  
country to furnish the raw material—the degree, in  
which the nature of the manufacture admits of a  
substitute for manual labor in machinery—the faci-  
lity of execution—the extensiveness of the uses to  
which the article can be applied—its subserviency  
to other interests, particularly the great one of  
national defence. There are, however, objects, to  
which these circumstances are little applicable,  
which, for some special reasons, may have a claim  
to encouragement.  
  
A designation of the principal raw material, of  
which each manufacture is composed, will serve to  
introduce the remarks upon it. As in the first  
place,  
  
IRON. The manufactures of this article are en-  
titled to pre-eminent rank—none are more essential  
in their kinds, nor so extensive in their uses. They  
constitute, in whole, or in part, the implements or  
the materials, or both, of almost every useful occu-  
pation. Their instrumentality is every where con-  
spicuous.  
  
it is fortunate for the United States, that they  
have peculiar advantages for deriving the full bene-  
fit of this most valuable material, and they have  
every motive to improve it, with systematic care.

The enquiries, to which the subject of this report,  
has led, have been answered with proofs, that manu-|  
  
factories of iron, though generally understood to be  
extensive, are far more so than is commonly sup-|

factures of iron, or of which iron is the article of  
shief value, to ten per cent.  
  
Fire arms and other military weapons may, it is  
conceived, be placed witheut inconvenience in the  
class of articies, rated at fifteen per cent. There  
exist already manufactories ef these articles, which  
only require the stimulus of a certain demand, to  
render them adequate to the supply of the United  
States.  
  
It would also bea material aid to manufactories of  
this nature, as well as a mean of public security, if  
provision should be made for an annual purchase of  
military weapons of home manufacture, to a certain  
determinate extent, in order to the furmation of  
arsenals ; and to replace, from time to time, such  
as should be withdrawn for tse, so as always to have  
in store, the quantity of each kind, which should be  
deemed a competent supply.  
  
But it may hereafter deserve legislative consider-  
ation, whether manufactories of all the necessary  
weapons of war ought not to be established, on  
account of government itself. Such establishments  
are agreeable to the usual practice of nations; and  
that practice seems founded on sufficient reason.  
  
There appears to be an improvidence in leaving  
these essential instruments of national defence to the  
casual speculations of individual adventure; a re-  
source which can less be relied upon, in this case,  
than in most others; the articles in question not  
  
iat seven and an half.  
  
  
  
being objects of ordinary and indispensable private  
consumption ortse. As a general rule, manufacto-|  
ries on the immedixte account of government are to)  
be avoided ; but this seems to be one of the few ex-,  
eeptions, which that rule admits, depending on very,  
special reasons.  
  
Manufactures of steel, generally, or which steel is  
the article of chief value, may with advantage be  
placed in the class of goods rated at seven and an  
half per cent. As manufactures of this Kind have!  
not yet made any considerable progress, it is a rea-  
  
son for not rating them as high as those of iron;|

other countries, on moderate terms, and in great.  
plenty.  
  
Coppersmiths and brassfounders, particularly the  
former, are numerous in the United States: some of  
whom carry on business to a respectable extent.  
  
To multiply and extend manufactories of the ma-  
terixls in question, is worthy of attention and effort.  
In order to this, it is desirable to facilitate a plenti-  
ful supply of the materials. And a proper mean to  
this end is to place them in the class of free arti-  
cles. Copper in ptates, and brass, are already in this  
predicament: but copper in pigs and bars is not;  
neither is lapis calaminaris, which together with eop-  
per and charcoal, constitute the component ingredi-  
ents of brass. ‘The exemption from duty, by parity  
of reason, ought to embrace all such of these arti-  
cles, as are objects of importation.  
  
An additional duty on brass wares, will tend to the  
general end in view. These now stand at five per  
cent. while those of tin, pewter and copper, are rated  
There appears to be a proprie-  
ty, in every view, in placing brass wares upon the  
same level with them: and it merits consideration,  
whether the duty upon all of them ought not to be  
raised to ten per cent.  
  
LEAD. There are numerous proofs, that this ma-  
terial abounds in the United States, and requires  
little to unfold it to an extent, more than equal to  
every domestic occasion. A prolific mine of it has  
long been open in the south-western parts of Virgi-  
nia, and, under a public administration, during the  
late war, yielded a considerable supply for military  
use. This is now in the hands of individuals, who  
not only carry it on with spirit, but have established  
manufactories of it, at Richmond, in the same state.  
  
The duties, already laid upon the importation of  
this article, either in its unmanufactured or manu-  
  
j 3 , ice ‘  
factured state, insure it a decisive advantage in the  
  
home market—which amounts to considerable en-  
couragement. If the duty on pewter wares should  
be raised, it would afford a further encouragement.

but as this material is the basis of them, and as their! Nothing else occurs as proper to be added.  
  
extension is not less practicable, than important, it  
  
is desirable to promote it by a somewhat higher duty |

A question arises, how far it might be expedient |  
to permit the importation of iron in pigs and bars,  
free from duty. It would certainly be favorable to  
manufacturers of the article ; but the doubt is, whe-  
ther it might not interfere with its production.  
  
T wo circumstances, however, abate, if they do not  
remove, apprehension on this score ; one is, the con-  
siderable increase of price, which has been already  
remarked, and which renders it probable, that the  
free admission of foreign iron would not be incon-  
‘sistent with an adequate profit to the proprieters of  
iron works; the other is, the augmentation of de-  
mand, which would be likely to attend the increase  
of manufactures of the article, in consequence

FOSSIL COAL. This, as an important instru-  
ment of manufactures, may, without impropriety,  
be mentioned among the subjects of this report.  
  
A copious supply of it would be of great conse-  
quence to the iron branch: as an article of house-  
hold fuel, also, it is an interesting production, the  
utility ef which must increase in proportion to the  
decrease of wood, by the progress of settlement and  
cultivation. And its importance to navigation, as an  
immense article of transportation coast-wise, is sig-  
nally exemplified in Great Britain.  
  
It is knewn that there are several coal mines in  
Virginia, now worked, and appearances of their cx-  
istence are familiar in a number of places.  
  
The expediency of a bounty on ail this species of  
coal of home production, and of premiums on the  
opening of new mines, under certain qualifications,  
appears to be worthy of particular examination. The  
great importance of the article will amply justify a  
reasonable expense in this way if it shall appear te  
be necessary to, and shall be thought likely to an-  
swer the end. s  
  
WOOD. Several manufactures of this article flou-  
rish in the United States. Ships are no where built  
in greater perfection; and cabinet wares, generally,  
are made little, if at all, inferior to those of Europe.  
Their extent is such as to have admitted of conside-  
rable exportation.

considerations which stand in the way ef such an  
  
arrangement.  
  
Ardent spirits and malt liquors ate, next to flour,  
the two principal manufactures ef grain. The first  
has made a very extensive, the last a considerable  
progress in the United States. In respect to both, ar  
exclusive possession of the home market eught to  
be secured to the domestic manufactures, as fast as  
circumstances will admit. Nothing is more practi-  
cable and nothing more desirable.  
  
The existing laws of the United States have done  
much towards attaining this valuable object: but  
some additions to the present duties, on foreign  
distilled spirits, and foreign malt liquors, and per  
haps an abatement of those on home made spiritg,  
would more effectually secure it: and there does  
not occur any very weighty objection to either.  
  
An augmentation of the duties on imported spi-  
rits would favor as well the distillation of spirits  
from molasses, as that from grain. And to secure to  
the nation, the benefit of a manufacture, even of  
foreign materials, is always of great, though perhaps  
of secondary importance.

ported ; the other, by prohibiting the expertation of  
bark. In support of the latter, it is alleged, that the,  
price of bark, chiefly in consequence of large ex-|  
portations, has risen within a few years, from about,  
three dollars to four dollars and a half per cord.  
  
These suggestions are submitted rather as intima-:  
tions, which merit consideration, than as matters,  
the propriety of which is manifest. It is not clear, |  
that an increase of duty is necessary; and in regard |  
to the prohibition desired, there is no evidence of;  
ahy considerable exportation hitherto; and it is |  
niost probable, that whatever augmentation of price,  
may have taken place is to be attributed to an exten-&#x27;  
sion of the home demand from the increase of ma-&#x27;  
nufactures, and to a decrease of the supply, in con-,  
sequence of the progress of settlement, rather than  
to the quantities which have been exported.  
  
It is mentioned, however, as an additional reason  
for the prohibition, that one species of the bark,|  
usually exported, is in some sort peculiar to the)  
country, and the material of a very valuable dye, of |  
great use m some other manufactures, in which the  
United States have begun a competition.  
  
There may also be this argument in fayor of an  
increase of duty. The object is of importance enough  
to claim decisive encouragement: and the progress  
which has been made, leaves no room to apprehend  
any inconvenience, on the seore of supply, from such  
  
an increase.  
  
It would be a benefit to this branch, if glue, which  
is now rated at five per cent. were made the object  
of&#x27;an exclading duty. It is already made in large  
quantities at various tanneries ; and, like paper, is an  
entire economy of materials, which if not manufac-  
tured, would be left to perish. It may be placed with  
advantage in the class of articles paying fifteen per  
cent.  
  
  
  
GRAIN. Manufactures of the several species of  
this article have a title to peculiar favor; not only  
because they are most of them immediately con-  
nected with the subsistence of the citizens, but  
because they enlarge the demand for the most pre-  
cious products of the soil.  
  
Though flour may, with propriety, be noticed as a  
manufacture of grain, it were useless to do it, but  
for the purpose of submitting the expediency of a  
general system of inspection throughout the ports

A strong impression prevails in the minds of those  
concerned in distilleries (ineluding, too, the most  
candid and enlightened) that greater differences in  
the rates of duty on foreign th domestic spirits are  
necessary, completely to secure the successful md-  
nufacture of the latter: and there are facts which  
entitle this impression to attention.  
  
It is known, that the price of molasses for sonie  
years past, has been successively rising in the West  
tndia markets, owing partly to a competition which  
did not formerly exist, and partly to an extension of  
demand in this country; and it is evident, that the  
late disturbances in those islands, from which we  
draw our principal supply, must so far interfere  
with the production of™be article, as to occasion &amp;  
material enhancement ice. The destruction and  
devastation attendant om insurrection in Hispa+  
niola in particular, mus only contribute very  
much to that effect, but e expected to give it  
some duration. These circtmstances, and the duty  
of three cents per gallon on mglasses, may render it  
difficult for the distillers of that material to main-  
tain, with adequate profit, a competition, with the  
rum brought from the West Indies, the quality of  
which is so considerably superior.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The consumption of geneva, or gin, m this coun-  
try, is extensive. It ig not long since distilleries of it  
have grown up among us to any importance. They  
are now becoming of consequence: but being stilt  
in their infancy they require protection.  
  
It is represented, that the price of some of the  
materials is greater here than in Holland, from  
which place large quantities are brought—the price:  
of labor considerably greater—the capitals engaged,  
in the business there much larger than those which  
are employed here—the rate of profits, at which the  
undertakers can afford to carry it on, much less—  
the prejudices, in favor of imported gin, strong.  
These circumstances are alleged to outweigh the  
charges, which attend the bringing of the article  
from Europe to the United States, and the present  
difference of duty, so as to obstruct the prosecution  
of the manufacture, with due advantage.  
  
Experiment could, perhaps, alone. decide with  
certainty the justress of the suggestionS which are  
made: but in relation to branch of manufacture

this material, which adapts it in a péculiar degree to  
the application of machines.  
  
The singular utility of the mill for spinning of cot-  
ton, not long since invented in England, has been  
noticed in another place: but there are other ma-  
chines s¢arcely inferior in utility, which, in the dif-  
ferent manufactures of this article, are emploved  
either exclusivly or with more than ordinary effect.  
This very important ¢ircumstance recommends the  
fabrics of cotton, in a more particular manner, to a  
country in which a defect of hands constitutes the  
  
atest obstacle to success.  
  
The variety and extent of the uses to which the  
manufactures of this article are applicable, is ano-  
ther powerful argument in their favor.  
  
And the facutty of the United States to produce  
the raw material in abundance, and of a quality,  
which, though alleged to be inferior to some that is  
produced in other quarters, is nevertheless capable  
of being uséd with advantage in many fabrics, and  
ts probably susceptible of being carried, by a more  
experienced culture, to much greater perfection,  
suggests an additional anda very cogent induce-  
ment to the vigorous pursuit of the cotton branch,  
m its several subdivisions.  
  
How much has been already done, has been stated  
in a preceding part of this report.  
  
In addition to this it may be announced, that a so-  
ciety is forming, with a capital which is expected to  
be extended to at least half a million of dollars; on  
behalf of which measures are already in train for  
prosecuting, ona large scale, the making and print-  
ing of cotton goods.  
  
be made to approach nearer than it now does tp that  
of regions somewhat’ more favored by climate, and  
while facts authorise an opinion, that very great use  
may be made of it, and that it is a resource which  
gives greater security to the cotton fabrics of this  
country, than can be enjoyed by any which depends  
wholly on external supply, it will certainly be wise  
in every view, to let our infant manufaciures have  
the full benefit of the best materials, on the cheap-  
est terms. It is obvious, that the necessity of hav-  
ing such materials, is proportioned to the unskiiful-  
ness and inexperience of the workmen empleyed,  
who, if inexpert, wil! not fail to commit great waste,  
where the materials they are te work with, are of an  
indifferent kind.  
  
To secure to the nationsl manufacturers so essen-  
tial an advantage, a repeal of the present duty on  
imported cotton is indispensable.  
  
A substitute for this, far more encouraging to de-  
mestic production, will be to grant a bounty on the  
national cotton, when wrought at a home manufac-  
tory : to which a bounty on the exportatton of it may  
be added. Either or both would do much more to-  
wards promoting the growth of the article, than the  
merely nominal encouragement, which it is proposed  
to ‘abolish. The first would also have a direct in-  
fluence in encouraging the manufacture.  
  
The bounty, which has been mentioned, as exist-  
ing in Great Britain, upon the exportation of coarse  
‘linens, not exceeding a certain value, applies also to  
icertain descriptions of cotton gocds of similar  
  
  
  
value.  
  
This furnishes an additional argument for allow

ing the subject of pecuniary bounties.  
  
Cotton has not the same pretensions with hemp,  
to form an exteption to the general rule.  
  
Not being, like hemp, an universal production of  
the country, it affords less assurance of an adequate  
internal supply ; but the chief objection arises from  
the doubts, which are entertained concerning the!  
quality of the national cotton. It is alleged, that  
the fibre of it is considerably shorter and weaker,  
than that of some other places; and it has been ob-;  
served, as a general rule, that the nearer the place  
of growth to the equator, the better the quality of  
the cotton. That which comes from Cayenne, Suri-  
  
  
  
  
  
ham, and Demarara, is sail to be preferable, even:  
ata material difference of price, to the cottan of the

The printing and staining of cotter goods is Known  
to be a distinct business from the fabrication of them.  
It is one easily accomplished, and which, as it adds  
materially to the value of the article in its white  
state, and prepares it for a variety of new uses, is of  
importance to be promoted.  
  
As imported cottons, equally with those which are  
made at home, may be the objec&#x27;s of this manufac-  
ture, it will merit consideration, whether the whoie}  
or apart of the duty, on the white goods, ought not  
to be allowed to be drawn b=ck, in favor of those,  
who print or stain them. This measure would cer-  
tainly operate as a powerful encouragement to the  
business; and, though it may in a degree counter:  
act the original fabrication of the articles, it woull  
probably more than compensate for this disadvan-  
tage, in the rapid growth of a collateral bronch,  
which is of a nature sgoner to cttain to maturity.

When a sufficient progress shall have been made, the  
tirawback may be abrogated, and by that time’ the  
domestic supply of the articles to be printed or stain-  
ed will have been extended. |  
  
If the duty of seven and a half per cent. on certain  
kinds of cotton goods were extended to all beste ot  
cetton, or of which it is the principal material, it  
would probably more than counterbalance the effect  
of the drawback proposed, in relation to the fabri-  
cation of the article. And no material objection oc-  
curs to such an extension. The du&#x27;y, then, consi-  
dering all the circumstances which attend goods of  
this description, could not be deemed inconvenient-  
ly high; and it-may be inferred from various causes,  
that the prices of them would still continue mo-  
gerate.  
  
- Manufactories of cotton goods, not long since es-  
tablished at Beveriy, in Massachusetts, and at Pro-  
vidence, in the state of Rhode Island, and conduct  
ed with a perseverance corresponding with the pa-  
triotic motives which began them, seem to have  
overcome the first obstacles to success ; producing  
eorduroys, velverets, fustains, jeans, and other si-  
milar articles, of a quality, which will bear a com-  
parison with the like articles brought from Manches-  
ter. The one at Providence has the merit of being  
the first in introducing into the United States, the  
celebrated cotton mill; which not only furnishes  
materials for that manufactory itself, but for the sup-  
ply of private families for household manufacture.  
  
ther manufuctories of the same material, as re-  
gular business¢s, have also been begun at different  
places in the state of Connecticut, but all upona  
smaller scaie than those above mentioned. Some es-  
says are also making in the printing and staining of  
cotton goods. There are several small establish-  
ments of this kind already on foot.  
  
WOOL. In a country the climate of which par-  
takes of so considerable a proportion of winter, as  
that of agreat part of the United States, the wool-  
len branch cannot be regarded as inferior toany, which  
relates to the clothing of the inhabitants.  
  
Household manufaciures of this material are car-  
ried.on, in different parts of the United Siates, to a  
Very interesting extent : but there is only one branch,  
which, as a regular business, can be said to have ac-  
quired maturity. This is the making of hats.  
  
Hats of wool, and of wool mixed with fur, are  
made in large quantities, in different states; and  
nothing seems wanting, but an adequate supply of  
materials, to render the manufacture commensurate  
with the demand. :  
  
A promising essay, towards the fabrication of  
eloths, cassimers, znd other woollen goods, is like-  
wise going on at Hartford, m Connecticut. Speci-  
mens of the different kinds which are made, in the  
possession of the secretary, evince that these fabrics  
have attained a very considerable degree of perfec-  
tion. Their quality certainly surpasses any thing,  
that could have been looked for, in so short a time,  
and under so great disadvantages ;. and conspires  
with the scantiness of the means, which have been  
at the command of the directors, to form the eulo-  
gium of that.public spirit, persevérance, and judg-  
ment, which-have been able to accomplish so much.  
  
Yo cherish and bring to maturity this precious  
embryo must engage the most ardent wishes, and  
proportionable regre*, as faras the means of doing  
it may appear difficult or uncertain.  
  
, Measures, which should tend to promote an abun-  
dant supply of wool, of good quality, would proba-  
  
sirable expedient, for that purpose ; but it may not  
be alone sufficient, especially as it is yet a problem,  
whether our wool be capable of such a degree of  
improvement, as to render it fit for the finer fabrics,  
  
Premiums would probably be found the best means  
of promoting. the domestic, and bounties the foreign  
supply : the first may be within the compass of the  
instivution hereafter to be submitted. The last would  
require a specific legislative provision. Lf «ny boun.  
ties are granted, they ought, of course, to be ad.  
justed with an eye to quality as well as quantity.  
  
A fund for this purpose may be derived frem the  
addition of two and a half per cent. to the present  
tate of duty, on carpets and carpeting ; an increase,  
to which the nature of the articles suggests no ob.  
jection, and which may, at the same time, furnish  
a motive the more, to the fabrication of them at  
home; towards which some beginnings have been.  
made.  
  
SILK. The production of this article is attended  
with great facility in most parts of the United  
States. Some pleasing essays are making in Con-  
necticut, as well towards that, as towards the ma-  
nufacture of what is produced. Stockings, hand-  
kerchiefs, ribands and buttons, are made, though as  
yet but in smail quantities.  
  
A manufactory of lace, upon a scale not very ex-  
tensive, has been long memorable at Ipswich, in the  
state of Massachusetts.  
  
An exemption of the material from the duty,  
which it now pays on importatisn, and premiums  
upon the production, to be dispensed under the  
direction of the institution before alluded to, seem  
to be the only species of encouragement advisable  
at so early a stage of the thing.  
  
GLASS. The materials for making glass are found  
every where. In the United States, there is no defi-  
ciency of them. The sands and stones calied tarso,  
which inciude flinty and crystaline substances gene-  
raliy, and the salts of various plants, particularly of the  
sea weed kali or Kelp, constitute the essential in-  
gredients. An extraordinary abundance of fuel is a  
  
  
  
particular advantage enjoyed in this country for  
isuch manufactures. They however require large  
capitals and involve much manual labor.  
  
Different manvfactories of glass are now on foot  
in the United States. The present duty of.12 12  
per cent. on all imported articies of glass, amounts to  
a considerable encouragement to those manufacto-  
ries. If any thing in addition is judged eligible, the  
most proper would appear to be a direct bounty, on  
window glass and biack bottles.  
  
The first recommends itself as an object of gene-  
ral convenience ; the last adds to that character, the  
circumstance of being an important item in brewe-  
ries. A complaint is made of great deficiency in this  
respect.  
  
GUN-POWDER. No small progress has been  
of Jate made in the manufacture of this very im-  
portant article; it may, indeed, be considered 4s  
already established ; but its high importance renders  
its further extension very desirable.  
  
The encouragements, which it already enjoys, are  
a duty of ten per cent. on the foreign rival article,  
and an exemption of saltpetre, one of the principal  
ingredients of which it is composed, from duty. A  
like exemption of sulphur, another chief ingredicnt,  
would appear to be equally proper. No quantity of  
this article has yet been produced from internal  
sources. The use made of it in finishing the bottoms  
of ships, is an additional inducement to placing it

effect.  
  
As to books which usually fill the libraries of the  
wealthier classes, and of professional men, such an!  
augmentation of prices, as might be occasioned by  
an additional duty of five per cent. would be too  
little felt to be an impediment to the acquisition.  
  
And with regard to books which may be specially  
imported for the use of particular seminaries of  
learning, and of public libraries, a total exemption  
from duty would be advisable, which would yo far!  
towards obviating the objection just mentioned. They,  
are now subject to a duty of five per cent.  
  
As to the books in most general family use, the  
constancy and universality of the demand would  
Insure exertions to furnish them at home; and the  
means are completely adequate. It may also be ex-|  
pected ultimately, in this, as in other cases, that the  
extension of the domestic manufacture would con-  
duce to the cheapness of the article.  
  
It ought not to pass unremarked, that to encou-  
rage the printing of books is to encoarage the ma-  
hufacture of paper.  
  
“FINED SUGARS AND CHOCOLATE are  
among the number of extensive and prosperous do-  
Mestic manufactures.  
  
Drawbacks of the duties upon the materials, of  
which they are respectively made, in cases of expor-  
tation, would have a beneficial mfuence upon the  
manufacture, and would conform to a precedent,  
which has been already furnished in the instance of  
Molasses, on the exportation of distilled spirits.

the making of the article is a regular trade. It would  
be impossible to annex adequate precautions to a  
benefit of that nature, if extended to every private  
family, in which the manufacture was incidentally  
carried on: and its being a merely incidental occu-  
pation which engages a portion of time, that would  
otherwise be lost, it can be advantageously carried  
on, without so special an aid.  
  
The possibility of a diminution of the revenue,  
may also present itself, as an objection to the ar-  
rangements, which have been submitted.  
  
But there is no truth, which may be more firmly  
relied upon, than that the interests of the revenue  
are promoted by whatever promotes an increase  
of national industry and wealth.  
  
In proportion to the degree of these, is the capre  
city of every country to contribute to the public trea-  
sury; and where the capacity to pay is increased,  
ov even is not decreased, the only consequence of  
measures, which diminish any particular resource,  
is a change of the object. If, by encouraging the  
manufacture of an article at home, the revenue,  
which: has been wont to accrue from its importation,  
should be lessened, an indemnification can easily  
found, either out of the manufacture itself, or from.  
some other object, which may be deemed more  
convenient.  
  
The measnres, however, which have been submit.  
ited, taken awgregately, will, for a long time to come,.  
‘rather augment than decrease the public revenue.

IF the system of perfect liberty to industry and commerce,  
were the prevailing system of nations, the arguments which dis-  
suade a country, in the predicament of the United States, from  
the zealous pursuit of manufactures, weuld doubtless have great  
force. It will not be affirmed, that they might be permitted,  
with few exceptions, to serve as a rule of national conduct. In  
such a state of things, each country would have the full benefit  
of its peculiar advantages. If one nation were in a condition to  
supply manufactured articles on better terms than another, that  
other might find an abundant indemnification, in a superior ca-  
pacity to furnish the produce of the soil. And a free exchange,  
  
_ mutually beneficial, of the commodities which each was able to  
supply, on the best terms, might be carried on between them,  
supporting in full vigor the industry of each. And though the  
  
a circumstances which have been mentioned, and others which

of : ly agricultural, would not enjoy the same degree of opulence, in

siderations are pretty equally balanced, the option ought perhaps  
always to be in favor of leaving industry to its own course.

e regulations, which in foreign markets abridge  
the vent of the increasing surplus of our agricultural produce, serve to  
beget an earnest desire, that-a more extensive demand for that sur-  
plus may be created at home. And the complete success which has  
rewarded manufacturing enterprise, in some valuable branches, con-  
spiring with the promising symptoms which attend some less mature  
essays in others, justify a hope, that the obstacles to the growth of  
this species of industry, are ice formidabie than they were appre-  
hended to be; and that it is not difficult to find in its further exten-  
sion, a full indemnification for any external disadvantages, which are,  
or may be experienced, as well as an accession of resources favourable  
to national independence and safety.  
  
There still are, nevertheless, respectable patrons of opinions, un-  
friendly to the encouragement of manufactures. The TS tle te are,  
substantially, the arguments by which these opinions are defended:  
  
“In every country (say those who entertain them) agriculture is the  
most beneficial and productive object of human industry. This posi-  
tion, genera’ ly if not universally true, applies with peculiar em fasts  
to the United States, on account of their immense tracts. of fertile  
territory, uninhabited and unimproved. Nothing can afford so advan-  
  
eous an employment for capital and labour, as the conversion of  
this extensive wilderness into cultivated farms. Nothing equally with  
this, can contribute to the population, strength, and real riches of the  
country. |  
  
“&#x27;To endeavour, by the extraordinary patronage of government, to  
accelerate the growth of manufactures, is, in fact, to endeavour, by  
force and art, to transfer the natural current of industry, from a more  
to a less beneficial channel. Whatever has such a tendency must  
necessarily be unwise: indeed it can hardly ever be wise in a govern-  
ment, to attempt to give a direction to the industry of its citizens.  
This, under the quick-ciahted guidance of private interest, will, if left  
fo itself, infallibly find its own way to the most profitable employ-  
ment; and it is by such employment, that the public prosperity will be  
most effectually promoted. 0 leave industry to itself, therefore, is,  
in almost every case, the soundest, as well as the simplest policy.  
  
“This policy is not only recommended to the United States, by  
considerations which affect all nations; it is, in a manner, dictated to  
them by the imperious force of a very peculiar situation. ‘The small-  
ness of their population, compared with their territory—the constant  
allurements to emigration from the settled to the unsettled parts of  
the country—the facility with which the less independent condition of  
an artisan can be exchanged for the more independent condition of a

farmer—these, and similar causes, conspire to produce, and, for a  
length of time, must continue to occasion, a scarcity of hands for  
manufacturing occupation, and dearness of labour, generally. To these  
disadvantages for the prosecution of manufactures, a deficiency of  
pecuniary capital being added, the prospect of a successful compe-  
tition with the manufacturers of Europe, must be regarded as little  
less than desperate. Extensive manufactures can only be the off-  
spring of a redundant, at least of a full population. Till the latter  
shall characterize the situation of this country, ’tis vain to hope for  
the former.  
  
“Tf, contrary to the natural course of things, an unseasonable and  
premature spring can be given to certain fabrics, by ayy duties,  
prohibitions, bounties, or by other forced expedients; this will only be  
to sacrifice the interests of the community to those of particular classes.  
Besides the misdirection of labour, a virtual monopoly will be given  
to the persons employed on such fabrics; and an enhancement of  
price, the inevitable consequence of every acto, ae must be defrayed  
at the expense of the other parts of the society. It is far preferable,  
that those persons should be engaged in the cultivation of the earth,  
and that we should procure, in exchange for its productions, the com-  
modities, with which foreigners are able to supply us in greater perfec-  
tion, and upon better terms.”  
  
This mode of reasoning is founded upon facts and principles,  
which have certainly respectable pretensions. If it had governed the  
conduct of nations, more generally than it has done, there is room to  
suppose, that it might have carried them faster to prosperity and  
greatness, than they have attained by the pursuit of maxims too  
widely opposite. Most general theories, however, admit of numerous  
exceptions; and there are few, if any, of the political kind, which  
do not blend a considerable portion of error with the truths they  
inculcate.  
  
In order to an accurate judgment, how far that, which has been just  
stated, ought to be aeamed liable to a similar imputation, it is neces-  
sary to advert carefully to the considerations which plead in favour of  
manufactures, and which appear to recommend the special and positive  
encouragement of them, in certain cases, and under certain reasonable  
limitations.  
  
It ought readily to be conceded, that the cultivation of the earth,  
as the primary and most certain source of national supply—as the  
immediate and chief source of subsistence to man—as the prin-  
cipal source of those materials which constitute the nutriment of  
other kinds of labour—as including a state most favourable to the  
freedom and independence of the human mind—one, perhaps, most  
conducive to the multiplication of the human species—has intrin-  
a a strong claim to pre-eminence over every other kind of  
industry.  
  
_ But, that it has a title, to any thing like an exclusive predilection,  
in any country, ought to be admitted with great caution. That it is  
even more productive than every branch of industry, requires more  
evidence than has yet been given in support of the position. That  
its real interests, precious and important as, without the help of ex-  
aggeration, they truly are, will be advanced, rather than injured by

the due encouragement of manufactures, may, it is believed, be satis.  
factorily demonstrated. And it is also believed, that the expediency  
of such encouragement, in a general view, may be shown to be  
rok Cnn by the most cogent and persuasive motives of national  
icy.  
  
Plt iat been maintained, that agriculture is not only the most pro-  
ductive, but the only productive species of industry. ‘The reality of  
this suggestion, in either respect, has, however, not been verified by  
any accurate detail of facts and calculations: and the general argu-  
ments, which are adduced to prove it, are rather subtile and paradoxi-  
cal,.than solid or convincing.  
  
Those, which maintain its exclusive productiveness, are to this  
effect :  
  
Labour, bestowed upon the cultivation of land, produces enough,  
not only to replace all the necessary expenses incurred in the busi-  
ness, and to maintain the persons who are employed in it, but to afford,  
together. with the ordinary profit on the stock or capital of the farmer,  
a net surplus, or rent for the landlord or proprietor of the soil. But  
the labour of artificers does so, more than replace the stock  
which employs them, or which furnishes materials, tools, and wages,  
and yield the rdinary profit upon that stock. It yields nothing equi-  
valent to the rent ofland. Neither does it add any thing to the total  
value of the whole annual preduce of the land and labour of the coun-  
try. The additional value given to those parts of the produce of  
land, which are wrought into manufactures, is counterbalanced by the  
value of those other parts of that produce, which are consumed by the  
manufacturers. It can therefore only be by saving or parsimony, not  
by the positive productiveness of their labour, that the classes of arti-  
ficers can in any degree augment the revenue of the society.  
  
To this it has been answered,  
  
1. “ That inasmuch as it is acknowledged, that manufacturing la-  
bour reproduces a value equal to that which is expended or con-  
sumed in carrying it on, and continues in existence the original stock  
or capital employed, it ought, on that account alone, to escape being  
considered as wholly unproductive: that though it should be admit-  
ted, as alleged, that the consumption of the produce of the soil, by the  
classes of artificers or manufacturers, is exactly equal to the value  
added by their labour to the materials upon which it is exerted ; yet it  
would not thence follow, that it added nothing to the revenue of the  
society, or to the aggregate value of the annual produce of its land  
and labour. If the consumption, for any given period, amounted to a  
  
iven sum, and the increased value of the produce manufactured, iv  
  
e same period, to a like sum, the total amount of the consumption  
and production during that period, would be equal to the two sums,  
and consequently double the value of the agricultural produce con-  
sumed. And though the increment of value, produced by the classes  
of artificers, should at no time exceed the value of the produce of the  
land consumed by them, yet there would be at every moment, in con-  
sequence of their labour, a greater value of goods in the market, than  
would exist independent of it.  
  
2. “ That the position, that artificers can augment the revenue of a  
  
gociety, only by parsimony, js true in no other sense, than in one

which is equally sepiccalpe to husbandmen or cultivators. It may be  
alike affirmed of all these classes, that the fund acquired by their la-  
bour, and destined for their support, is not, in an ordinary way, more  
than equal to it. And hence it will follow, that augmentations of the  
wealth or capital of the community (except in the instances of some  
extraordinary dexterity of skill) can only proceed, with respect to  
any of them, from the savings of the more thrifty and parsimonious.  
  
3. “ That the annual produce of the land and labour of a country  
can only be increased, in two ways, by some improvement in the pro~  
ductive powers of the useful labour, which soni exists within it, or  
by some increase in the quantity of such labour; that with regard to  
the first, the labour of artificers being capable of greater subdivision  
and simplicity of operation, than that of cultivators, it is susceptible,  
in a proportionably greater.degree, of improvement in its productive  
powers, whether to be derived from an acctssion of skill, or from the  
application of ingenious machinery; in which particular, therefore, the  
labour employed in the culture of land can pretend to no advantage  
over that engaged in manufactures: that with re to an augmen-  
tation of the quantity of useful labour, this, excluding adventitious  
circumstances, must depend essentially upon an increase of capital,  
which again must depend upon the savings made out of the revenues  
of those, who furnish or manage that, which is at any time employed,  
whether in agriculture, or in manufactures, or in any other way.”

It is now proper to enumerate the principal circumstances, from  
which it may be inferred—that manufacturing establishments not on-  
ri occasion a positive augmentation of the produce and revenue of  
  
e society, but that they contribute essentially to rendering them  
reater than they could possibly be, without such establishments.  
hese circumstances are,  
  
1, The division of labour.  
  
2. An extension of the use of machinery.  
  
3. Additional employment to classes of the community, not ordina-  
rily engaged in the business.  
  
4. The promoting of emigration from foreign countries.  
  
5. The furnishing greater scope for the diversity of talents and dis-  
positions which discriminate men from each other.  
  
6. The affording a more ample and various field for enterprise.  
  
7. The creating, in some instances, a new, and securing, in all, a  
more certain and steady demand for the surplus produce of the soil.  
  
Each of these circumstances has a considerable influence upon the  
total mass of industrious effort in a community: together, they add  
to ita degree of energy and effect, which are not easily conceived.  
Some comments upon each of them, in the order in which they have  
been stated, may serve to explain their importance.  
  
I. As to the division of labour.  
  
It has justly been observed, that there is scarcely any thing of  
greater moment in the economy of a nation, than the proper division  
of labour. The separation of occupations causes each to be carried  
to a much greater perfection than it could possibly acquire, if they  
were blended. ‘This arises principally from three circumstances.  
ist, The greater skill and dexterity naturally resulting from @ con

stant and undivided application to a single object. It is evident, that  
these eg must increase, in proportion to the separation and  
simplification of objects and the steadiness of the attention devoted  
to each ; and must be less, in. proportion to the complication of ob-  
jects, and the number among which the attention is distracted.  
  
2d. &#x27;The economy of time, by avoiding the loss of it, incident to a  
frequent transition, from one operation to another of a different na-  
ture. This depends on various circumstances ; the transition itself—  
the orderly disposition of the implements, machines, and materials  
employed in the operation to be relinquished—the preparatory steps  
to the commencement of a new one—the interruption of the impulse,  
which the mind of the workman acquires, from being en = ina  
particular mc distractions, hesitations and reluctances,  
which attend the passage from one kind of business to another.  
  
Sd. An extension of the use of machinery. A man occupied on a  
single object, will have it more in his power, and will be more natur-  
ally led to exert his imagination in devising methods to facilitate and  
abridge labour, then if he were perplexed by a variety of independ-  
ent and dissimilar operations. Besides this, the fabrication of ma-  
chines, in numerous instances, becoming itself a distinct trade, the  
artist, who follows it, has all the advantages which have been enume-  
rated, for improvement in this particular art: and in both ways the  
‘amatia eal application of machinery are extended.  
  
And from these causes united, the mere separation of the occupa-  
tion of the cultivator, from that of the artificer, has the effect of aug-  
pee the productive powers of labour, and with them, the total  
mass of the produce or revenue of a country. In this view of the  
subject, therefore, the utility of artificers or manufacturers, towards  
promoting an increase of productive industry, is apparent.  
  
II. As to an extension of the use of machinery, a point which,  
though partly anticipated, requires to be placed in one or two addi-  
tional lights.  
  
The employment of machinery forms an item of great importance  
in the general mass of national industry. *Tis an artificial force  
brought in aid of the natural force of man; and, to all the purposes  
of labour, is an increase of hands; an accession of strength, unincum-  
bered too by the expense of maintaining the labourer. May it not  
therefore be fairly inferred, that those occupations which give greatest  
scope to the use of this auxiliary, contribute most to the general  
stock of industrious effort, and, in consequence, to the general pro-  
duct of industry?  
  
It shall be taken for granted, and the truth of the position referred  
to observation, that manufacturing pursuits are susceptible in a great-  
er degree of the application of oe than those of agriculture.  
{f so, all the difference is lost to a community, which, instead of  
manufacturing for itself, procures the fabrics requisite to its supply  
from other countries. ‘The substitution of foreign for domestic manu-  
factures is a transfer to foreign nations of the advantages accruing  
from the employment of machinery in the modes in which it is capable  
of being employed, with most utility and to the greatest extent.  
  
‘The cotton-mill invented in England, within the last twenty years,  
is a signal illustration of the general proposition, which has been just

advanced. In consequence of it, all the different processes for spin-  
ning cotton are performed by means of machines, which are put in  
motion by water, and attended chiefly by women and children; and  
by a smaller number of persons, in. the whole, than are requisite in the  
ordinary mode of spinning. And it is an advantage of great moment,  
that the operations of the mill continue with convenience, during the  
night, as well as through the day. The prodigious effect of such a  
machine is easily conceived. To this invention is to be attributed  
essentially the immense progress, which has been so suddenly made in  
Great Britain, in the various fabrics of cotton.  
  
III. As to the additional employment of classes of the community,  
not originally engaged in the particular business.  
  
This is not among the least valuable of the means by which manu-  
facturing institutions contribute to augment the general stock of in-  
dustry and production. In places where those institutions prevail,  
besides the persons regularly engaged in them, they afford occasional  
and extra employmeut to industrious individuals and families, who  
are willing to devote the leisure resulting from the intermissions of  
their ordinary pursuits to collateral labours, as a resource for multi-  
plying their acquisitions or their enjoyments. The husbandman him-  
self experiences a new source of profit and support from the increased  
industry of his wife and daughters; invited and stimulated by the  
demands of the neighbouring manufactories.  
  
Besides this advantage of occasional employment to classes having  
different occupations, there is another of a nature allied to it, and of a  
similar tendency. This is; the employment of persons who would  
otherwise be idle (and, in many cases, a burden on the community)  
either from the bias of temper, habit. infirmity of body, or some other  
cause, indisposing or disqualifying them for the toils of the country.  
{t is worthy of particular remark, that, in general, women and chil-  
dren are rendered more useful, and the latter more early useful, by  
manufacturing establishments, than they would otherwise be. Of the  
number of persons employed in the cotton manufactories of Great  
Britain, it is computed that four-sevenths nearly are women and chil-  
dren; of whom the greatest proportion are children, and many of them  
of a tender age.  
  
And thus it appears to be one of the attributes of manufactures, and  
one of no small consequence, to give occasion to the exertion of a  
greater quantity of industry, even by the same number of persons,  
where they happen to prevail, than would exist, if there were no such  
establishments.  
  
IV. As to the promoting of emigration from foreign countries.  
  
Men reluctantly quit one course of occupation and livelihood for  
another, unless invited to it by very apparent and proximate advan-  
tages. Many, who would go from one country to anothey, if they had  
a prospect of continuing, with more benefit, the callings to which they  
have been educated, will often be tempted to ~— their situa-  
tion by the hope of doing better in some other way. Manufacturers,  
who (listening to the powerful invitation of a better price for their  
fabrics, or for their labour, of greater cheapness of provisions and raw  
materials, of an exemption from the chief part of the taxes, burdens  
gnd restraints, which they endure in the old world, of greater perso

nal independence and consequence, under the operation of a more  
equal government, and of what is far more precious than mere reli-  
gious toleration, a perfect equality of religious privileges) would pro-  
bably flock from Europe to the United tates to pursue their own  
trades or professions, if they were once made sensible of the advan-  
tages they would enjoy, and were inspired with an assurance of en-  
couragement and employment, will, with difficulty, be induced to  
transplant themselves, with a view of becoming cultivators of land.  
  
If it be true, then, that it is the interest of the United States to open  
every possible avenue to emigration from abroad, it affords a weighty  
argument for the encouragement of manufactures; which, for the rea-  
son just assigned, will have the strongest tendency to multiply the  
inducements to it.  
  
Here is perceived an important resource, not only for extending the  
  
pulation, and with it the useful and productive labour of the coun-  
try, but likewise for the prosecution of manufactures, without deduct-  
ing from the number of hands which might otherwise be drawn to  
tillage; and even for the indemnification of agriculture for such as  
might ee to be diverted froni it. Many, whom manufacturing  
views would induce to emigrate, would afterwards yield to the temp-  
tations, which the particular situation of this country holds out to  
agricultural pursuits. And while agriculture would in other respects  
derive many signal and unmingled advantages, from the growth of  
manufactures, it is a problem, whether it would gain or lose, as to the  
article of the number of persons employed in carrying it on.  
  
V. As to the furnishing greater scope for the diversity of talents  
and dispositions, which discriminate men from each other.  
  
This is a much more powerful mean of augmenting the fund of  
national industry than may at first sight appear. It isa just observa-  
tion, that minds, of the strongest and most active powers for their  
proper objects, fall below mediocrity, and labour without effect, if  
confined to uncongenial pursuits. And it is thence to be inferred, that  
the result of human exertion may be immensely increased by diversi-  
fying its objects. When all the different kinds of industry obtain in a  
community, each individual can find his proper element, and call into  
activity the whole vigour of his nature. And the community is bene-  
fited by the services of its respective members, in the manner, in which  
each can serve it with most effect.  
  
If there be any thing in a remark often to be met with; namely, that  
there is, in the genius of the people of this country, a-peculiar aptitude  
for mechanic improvements, it would operate as a forcible reason for  
giving opportunities to the exercise of that species of talent, by the  
propagation of manufactures.  
  
I. As to the affording a more ample and various field for enterprise.  
  
This also is of greater consequence in the general scale of national  
exertion, than might perhaps on a superficial view be supposed, and  
has effects not altogether dissimilar from those of the circumstance  
last noticed. ‘To cherish and stimulate the activity of the human  
mind by a ing the objects of enterprise, is not among the least  
considerable of the expedients, by which the wealth of a nation may be  
  
promoted. Even things, in themselves not positively perenne’  
sometimes become so, by their tendency to provoke exertion.

new scene which is opened to the busy nature of man, to rouse and  
exert itself, is the addition of a new energy to the general stock of  
effort.  
  
The spirit of enterprise, useful and prolific as it is, must necessarily  
be contracted or expanded in proportion to the simplicity or variety  
of the occupations aid productions which are to be found in a society.  
It must be less in a nation of mere cultivators, than in a nation of  
cultivators and merchants; less in a nation of cultivators and mer-  
chants, than in a nation of cultivators, artificers, and merchants.  
  
VII. As to the creating, in some instances, a new, and securing in  
all a more certain and steady demand for the surplus produce of the  
soil.  
  
This is among the most important of the circumstances which have  
been indicated. It is a principal mean, by which the establishment  
ef manufactures contributes to an augmentation of the produce or re-  
venue of a country, and has an immediate and direct relation to the  
prosperity of agriculture.  
  
It is evident, that the exertions of the husbandman will be steady  
or fluctuating, vigorous or feeble, in proportion to the steadiness or  
fluctuation, adeqyateness, or inadequateness of the markets on which  
he must depend, for the vent of the surplus, which may be produced  
by his labour; and that such surplus, in the ordinary course of things,  
will be greater or less in the same proportion,  
  
For the purpose of this vent, a domestic market is greatly to be  
preferred to a foreign one; because it is, in the nature of things, far  
more to be relied upon.  
  
It is a primary object of the policy of the

 tending te  
render the external demand for the surplus of agricultural nations a  
precarious reliance. The differences of seasons in. the countries which  
are the consumers, make immense differences in the produce of their  
own soils, in different years, and consequently in the degrees of their  
necessity for foreign supply. Plentiful harvests with them, especially  
if similar ones occur at the same time in the countries which are the  
furnishers, occasion of course a glut in the markets of the latter.  
~ Considering how fast and how much the progress of new settle.  
ments in the United States must increase the surplus produce of the  
soil, and weighing seriously the tendency of the system, which pree  
yails among most of the commercial nations of Europe ; whatever de-  
pendence may be placed on the force of natural circumstances to  
counteract the effects of an artificial policy; there appear strong rea-  
sons to regard the foreign demand for that surplus, as too uncertain  
a reliance, and to desire a substitute for it, in an extensive domestic  
market. |  
  
To secure such a market, there is no other expedient, than to pro-  
mote manufacturing establishments. Manufacturers, who constitute  
the most numerous class, after the cultivators of land, are for that  
reason the principal consumers -of the surplus of their.labour. |  
  
This idea of an extensive domestic market for the surplus produce  
of the soil, is of the first consequence. It is, of all things, that which  
most effectually conduces to a flourishing state of senate, If the  
effect of manufactories should be to detach a portion of the hands,  
which would otherwise be engaged in tillage, it might possibly cause  
a smaller quantity of lands to be under cultivation: but by their ten-  
dency to procure a more certain demand for the surplus produce of  
the soil, they would, at the same time, cause the lands, which were  
in cultivation, to be better improved and more productive. And  
while, by their influence, the condition of each individual farmer  
would be meliorated, the total mass of agricultural production would  
probably be increased. For this must evidently depend as much, if  
not more, upon the degree of improvement, than upon the number of  
acres under culture. |  
  
It merits particular observation, that the multiplication of manv-  
factories not only furnishes a market for those articles which have  
been PS tN to be produced in abundance, in a country; but it  
likewise creates a demaad for such as were either unknown or b nat  
duced in inconsiderable quantities. The bowels,as well.as the surface  
of the earth, are ransacked for articles which were before neglected.  
Animals, plants, and minerals acquire a utility and value, which were  
before unexplored.  
  
The foregoing considerations seem sufficient to establish, as gene-  
ral propositions, that it is the interest of nations to diversify the in  
dustrious pursuits of the individuals who compose them—that the es-  
tablishment of manufactures is calculated not only to increase the  
general stock of useful and productive labour, but even to improve the

the foreign article for which it is a substitute. The internal compe-  
tition, which takes place, soon does away every thing like pea wl  
and by degrees reduces the price of the article to the minimum of a  
reasonable profit on the capital employed. This accords with the  
reason of the thing and with experience.  
  
Whence it follows, that it is the interest of the community, with a  
view to eventual and permanent economy, to encourage the growth of  
manufactures. In a national view, a temporary enhancement of price  
must always be well compensated by a permanent reduction of it.  
  
It is a reflection, which may with propriety be indulged here, that  
this eventual diminution of the prices of manufactured articles, which  
is the result of internal manufacturing establishments, has a direct and  
very important tendency, to benefit agriculture. It enables the far-  
mer to procure, with a smaller quantity of his labour, the manufactur-  
ed produce of which he stands in need, and consequently increases  
the value of his income and property.  
  
The objections, which are commonly made to the expediency of en-  
couraging, and to the probability of succeeding in manufacturing pur-  
suits, in the United States, having now been discussed, the conside-  
rations, which have appeared in the course of the discussion, recom-  
mending that species of industry, to the patronage of the government,  
will be seatetiall strengthened by a few sede and some particular  
topics, which have been naturally reserved for subsequent notice.  
  
I. There seems to be a moral certainty that the trade of a country,  
which is both manufacturing and naticuliaral, will be more lucrative  
and prosperous, than that 2 a country which is merely agricultural.  
  
One reason for this is found in that general effort of nations (which  
has been already mentioned) to procure from their own soils, the ar-  
ticles of prime necessity requisite to their own consumption and use;  
and which serves to render their demand for a foreign supply of such  
articles in a great degree occasional and contingent. Hence; while  
the necessities of nations exclusively devoted to agriculture, for the  
fabrics of manufacturing states, are constant and regular, the wants of  
the latter for the products of the former, are liable to very considera-  
ble fluctuations and interruptions. ‘The great inequalities, resulting  
from difference of seasons, have been elsewhere remarked: this uni-  
formity of demand, on one side, and unsteadiness of it on the other.  
must necessarily have a tendency to cause the general course of the  
exchange of commodities between the parties, to turn to the disadvan-  
tage of the merely agricultural states. Peculiarity of situation, a cli-  
mate and soil adapted to the production of peculiar commodities.  
may, sometimes, contradict the rule: but there is every reason to be-  
lieve, that it will be found, in the main, ajust one.  
  
Another circumstance, wliich gives a superiority of commercial ad-  
vantages to states that manufacture, as well as cultivate, consists in  
the more numerous attractions, which a more diversified market of-  
fers to foreign customers, and in the greater scope which it affords to  
mercantile enterprise. It is a position of indisputable truth in com-  
merce, depending too on very obvious reasons, that the greatest resort  
will ever be to those. marts, where commodities, while equally abund-  
ant, are most various. Each difference of kind holds out an addi-  
tional inducement: and it is a position not less clear, that the field of

enterprise must be enlarged to the merchants of a country, in pro-  
portion to the variety as well as the abundance of sonesttn which  
pee find at home for exportation to foreign markets. |  
  
) third circumstance, perhaps not inierior to either of the other  
two, conferring the caged which has been stated, has relation to  
the stagnations of demand for certain commodities which at some  
time or other interfere more or less with the sale of all. ‘The nation  
which can bring to market but few articles, is likely to be more quick-  
ly and sensibly affected by such stagnations, than one, which is al-  
ways possessed of a great variety of commodities: the former fre-  
quently finds too great a portion of its stock of materials, for sale or  
exchange, lying on hand—or is obliged to make injurious sacrifies to  
supply its wants of foreign articles, which are numerous and urgent,  
in proportion to the smallness of the number of its own. The latter  
commonly finds itself indemnified, by the high prices of some articles,  
for the low prices of others—and the prompt and advantageous sale  
of those articles which are im demand enables its merchants the bet-  
ter to wait for.a favourable change, in respect to those which are not.  
There is ground to believe, that a difference of situation, in this par-  
ticular, has immensely different effects upon the wealth and prosperi-  
ty of nations.  
  
From these cireumstances collectively, twoimportant inferences are  
to be drawn; one, that there is always a higher probability of a fa-  
vourable balance of trade, in regard to countries, in which manufac-  
tures, founded on the basis of a thriving agriculture, flourish, than in  
r to those, which are confined wholly or almost wholly to agri-  
culture; the other (which is also a consequence of the first) that  
countries of the former description are likely to possess more pe-  
cuniary wealth, or money, than those of the latter.

It isnot uncommon to meet with an opinion, that though the pro-  
moting of manufactures, may be the interest of a part of the union, it.  
is contrary to that of another part. The northern anc southern re-  
gions are sometimes represented as having adverse interests in this

and a species of pert imagined to subsist between the manufac-  
turing and agricultural interest. |  
  
This idea of an opposition between those two interests is the com-  
mon-error of the early periods of every country; but experience gradu-  
ally dissipates it. Indeed they are perceived so often to succour and  
to befriend each other, that they come at length to be considered as.  
one: a supposition which has been frequently abused, and is not uni-  
versally true. Particular encouragements of particular manufactures  
may be of a nature to sacrifice the interests of landholders to those  
of manufacturers: but it is nevertheless a maxim well established b  
experience, and generally acknowledged where there has been s  
cient experience, that the “ aggregate” pemaeny of manufactures,  
and the “ aggregate” prosperity of agriculture are intimately connect-  
ed. In the course of the discussion which has had place, various  
weighty considerations have been adduced operating in support of  
that maxim. Perhaps the superior steadiness of the demand of a do-  
mestic market for the surplus produce of the soil, is alone a cenvinc-  
ing argument of its truth..  
  
&quot;ea of a contrariety of interests between the northern and south-  
ern regions of the union, are in the main as unfounded as they are  
mischievous. The diversity of circumstances, on which such contra-  
riety is usually predicated, authorises a directly contrary conclusion.  
Mutual wants constitute one of the strongest Yuks of political con-  
nexion: and the extent of these bears a natural proportion to the  
diversity in the means of mutual supply.  
  
Suggestions of an opposite complexion are ever to be deplored, as  
unfriendly to the steady pursuit of one great-common cause, and to  
the perfect harmony of all the parts. |  
  
In proportion as the mind is accustomed to trace the intimate con-  
nexion of interest, which subsists between all the parts of society,  
united under the same government—the infinite variety of channels  
which serve to circulate the prosperity of each to and through the  
rest—in that proportion it will be little apt to be disturbed by solici-  
tudes and apprehensions, which originate in local discriminations. I€  
is a truth as important as it is agreeable, and-one to which it is not  
easy to imagine exceptions, that every thing tending to establish sub-  
stantial and permanent order, in the affairs of a country, to increase  
the total mass of industry and opulence, is ultimately beneficial to  
every part of it. On the credit of this great truth, an acquiescence  
may sately be accorded, from every quarter, to all institutions, and  
arrangements, which promise a confirmation of public order, and an  
augmentation of national resource.

the idea, that the enc ment

A full view having now been taken of the inducements to the pro-  
motiongf manufactures in the United States, accompanied with an  
examination of the principal objections which are commonly urged im  
opposition, it is proper, in the next place, to consider the means by  
which it may be effected, as introductory to a specification of the ob-  
jects which, in the present state of things, appear the most fit to be  
encouraged, and of the particular measures which it may be advisa-  
ble to adopt, in respect to each.  
  
In order to a better judgment of the means proper to be resorted  
to by the United States, it will be of use to advert to those which  
have been employed with success in other countries. ‘The principal  
of these are—  
  
I. Protecting duties—or duties on those foreign articles which are  
the rivals of the domestic ones intended to be encouraged.  
  
Duties of this nature evidently amount to a virtual bounty on the  
domestic fabrics, since, by enhancing the charges on foreign articles,  
they enable the national manufaeturers to undersell all their foreign  
competitors. ‘The progriety of this species of encouragemeut need  
not to be dwelt upon ; as it is not only a clear result from the nume-  
rous topics which have been suggested, but is sanctioned by the laws  
of the United States, in a variety of instances: it has the additional  
recommendation of being a resource of revenue. Indeed all.the du-  
ties imposed on imported articles, though with an exclusive view to  
revenue, have the effect incontemplation, and, except where they  
fall‘on raw materials, wear a beneficent aspect towards the manu-  
factures of the country. :  
rR If. Prohibitions of rival articles, or duties equivalent to -prohi-  
  
tions.  
  
This is another and an efficacious means of encouraging national  
manufactures: but in general it is only fit to be employed when a  
manufacture has made such a progress, and is in so many hand, as to  
insure a due competition, and an adequate supply, on reasonable  
terms. Of duties equivalent to prohibitions, there are examples in  
the laws of the United States, and there are other cases, to which  
the principle may be advantageously extended: but they are not nu-  
merous.  
  
Considering a monopoly of the domestic market to its own manu-  
facturers as the reigning policy of manufacturing nations, a similar  
policy, on the part of the United States, in every proper instance, is  
dictated, it might almost be said, by the principles of distributive

citizens a reciprocity of advantages.  
  
III. Prohibitions of the exportation of the materials of manu  
factures. :  
  
The desire of securing a cheap and plentiful supply for the nation-  
al workmen, and, where the article is either peculiar to the country,  
or of peculiar quality there, the jealousy of enabling foreign wirk  
men to rival those of the nation, with its own materials, are the  
leading motives to this species of regulation. It ought not to be af-  
firmed, that it is in no instance proper ; but it is certainly one which  
ought to be adopted with great circumspection, and only in very  
  
lain cases. It is seen at once, that its immediate operation is to  
abridge the demand and keep down the price of the produce pf some  
other branch of industry, generally speaking, of agriculture, to the  
prejudice of those who carry it on; and though, if it be really essen-  
tial to the prosperity of any very important national manufacture, it

3. Bounties have not, like high protecting duties, a tendency to  
produce 7. An increase of price is not always the immediate,  
though, where the progress of a domestic manufacture does not coun-  
teract arise, it is commonly the ultimate effect of an additional duty.  
In the interval, between the laying of the duty and a proportionable  
increase of price, it may discourage importation, by interfering with  
the profits to be expected from the sale of the article.  
  
4. Bounties are sometimes not only the best, but the only proper  
expedient, for uniting the encouragement of a new object of agricul-  
ture, with that of a new object of manufacture. Itis the interest of  
the farmer to have the production of the raw material promoted, by  
counteracting the interference of the foreign material of the same  
kind—It is the interest of the manufacturer to have the material  
abundant or cheap. If, prior to the domestic production of the ma-  
terial, in sufficient quantity, to supply the manufacturer on good  
terms, a duty be laid upon the importation of it from abroad, with a  
view to promote the raising of it at home, the interest both of the far-  
mer and manufacturer will be disserved. By either destroying the  
requis supply, or raising the price of the article, beyond what can  
be afforded to be given for it, by the conductor of an infant manufac-  
ture,it is abandoned or fails; and there being no domestic manufac-  
tories to create a demand for the raw material, which is raised by the  
farmer, it is in vain, that the competition of the like foreign article,  
may have been destroyed.  
  
it cannot escape notice, that a duty upon the importation of an  
article can no otherwise aid the domestic production of it, than by  
giving the latter greater advantages in the home market. It can have  
no influence upon the advantageous sale of the article produced, in  
foreign markets; no tendency, therefore, to promote its exportation.  
  
The true way to conciliate these two interests is to lay a duty on  
foreign manufactures of the material, the growth of which is desired  
to be encouraged, and to apply the produce of that duty by way of  
bounty, either upon the production of the material itself, or upon its  
manufacture at home, or upon both. In this disposition of the thing,  
the manufacturer commences his enterprise, me every advantage,  
which is attainable as to quantity or price of the raw material: and  
the farmer, if the bounty be immediately given to him, is enabled by it  
toenter into a sanceadhl competition with the foreign material: if the  
bounty be to the manufacturer on so much of the domestic material  
as he consumes, the operation is nearly the same; he has a motive of  
interest to prefer the domestic commodity, if of equal quality, even  
at a higher price than the foreign, so long as the difference of price is  
any thing short of the bounty, which is allowed upon the article.  
  
xcept the simple and ordinary kinds of household manufacture,  
er those for which there are very commanding local omy rs: pecu-  
niary bounties, are in most cases indispensable to the introduction of  
anew branch. A stimulus and a support not less powerful and direct  
is, generally speaking, essential to the overcoming of the obstacles  
which arise from the competitions of superior skill and maturity else-  
where. Bounties are especially essential, in regard to articles, upor

V. Premiums. ;  
  
These are of a nature allied to bounties, though distinguishable  
from them in some important features.  
  
Bovnties are applicable to the whole quantity of an article produc-  
ed or manufactured, or exported, and involve a corres onledl ex-  
pense; premiums serve to reward some particular a or su-  
periority, some extraordinary exertion or skill, and are dispensed  
only in a small number of cases. -But their effect is to stimulate  
general effort: contrived so as to be both honorary and lucrative, they  
addyess themselves to different passions; touching the chords as well  
of emulation as of interest. They are accordingly a very economical  
mean of exciting the enterprise of a whole community.  
  
There are various societies in different countries, whose object is  
the dispensation of premiums for the encouragement of agriculture,  
arts, manufactures, and commerce; and though they are, for the most  
part, voluntary associations, with comparatively slender funds, their  
utility has been immense, Much has been done by this mean in G.  
Britain: Scotland in particular, owes «aterially to it a prodigious  
amelioration of condition. From a similar establishment in the United  
States, supplied and supported by the government of the union, vast  
benefits might reasonably be expected. Some further ideas on this  
head, shall accordingly be submitted in the conclusion of this report.  
  
VI. The smamption of the materials of manufactures from duty.  
  
The policy of that exemption, as a general rule, particularly in re-  
ference to new establishments, is obvious. It can hardly ever be ad-  
visable to add the obstructions of fiscal burdens to the difficulties  
which naturally embarrass a new manufacture; and where it is ma-  
tured and in condition to become an object of revenue, it is, generally

speaking, better that the fabric, than the material, should be the sub-  
  
ject of taxation. Ideas of proportion between the quantum of the tax  
  
and the value of the article can be more easily adjusted in the former  
than in the latter case. Anarguntent for exemptions of this kind in  
the United States, is to be derived from the practice, as far as their  
necessities have permitted, of those nations whom we are to meet as  
competitors in our own and in foreign markets.

Vil. Drawbacks of the duties which are imposed on the materials  
of manufactures. 7  
  
It has already been observed, as a general rule, that duties on those  
materials ought, with certain exceptions, to be forborne. Cf these ex-  
ceptions, three cases occur, which may serve as examples—one,  
where the material is itself an object of general or extensive con-  
sumption, and a fit and productive source of revenue: another, where  
a manufacture of a nae kind, the competition of which with a like  
domestic article is desired to be ie a partakes of the nature of  
a raw material, from being capable by a further process, to be co~-  
verted into a manufacture of a different kind, the introduction or  
growth of which is desired to be encouraged: a third, where the ma-  
terial itself is a production of the country, and in sufficient abundance  
to furnish a cheap and plentiful supply to the national manufacturers.  
  
Under the first description comes the articles of molasses. It is not  
only a fair object of reyenue, but being a sweet, it is just that the con-  
sumers of it shield pay a duty as well as the consumers of sugar.  
  
Cottons and linen in their white state fall under the second de-  
scription—a duty upon such as are imported is proper to promote  
the domestic manufacture of similar articles in the same state—a  
drawback of that duty is proper to encourage the printing and staining  
at home of those which are Erduphe from abroad. ‘When the first of  
these manufactures has attained sufficient maturity in a country, te  
furnish a full supply for the second, the utility of the drawback ceases.  
  
The article 4 hemp either now does or may be expected soon to  
exemplify the third case, in the United States.  
  
Where duties on the materials of manufactures are not laid for the  
purpose of preventing a competition with some domestic production,  
the same reasons which recommend, as a general rule, the exemption  
of those materials from duties, would recommend, as a like general  
rule, the allowance of drawbacks in favour of the manufacturer: ac-  
cordingly, such drawbacks are familiar in countries which systema-  
tically pursue the business of manufactures; which furnishes an  
argument of the observance of a similar policy in the United States:  
and the idea has been adopted by the laws of the union, in the in-  
stances of salt and molasses. It is believed that it will be found ad-  
vantageous to extend it to some other articles.  
  
VIIL. The encouragement of new inventions and discoveries, at  
home, and of the introduction into the United States of such as may  
have been made in other countries; particularly those which relate to  
machinery.

 The adoptien of it seems to be  
  
ictated by the principle of reciprocity. Greater liberality, in such  
respects, might better comport with the general spirit of the country;  
but a selfish and exclusive policy in other quarters will not always  
permit the free indulgence of a spirit which would place us upon an  
equal footing. As far as prohibitions tend to prevent foreign compe-  
titors from deriving the benefit of the improvements made at home,  
they tend to increase the advantages of those by whom they may  
have been introduced; and operate as an encouragement to exertion.

This is not among the least important of the means, by which the  
prosperity of manufactures may be promoted. It is indeed in many  
cases one of the mostessential. Contributing to prevent frauds upon  
consumers at home, and exporters to foreign countries—to improve  
  
. the quality and preserve the character of the national manufactures,  
  
it cannot fail to aid the expeditious and advantageous sale of them,  
and to serve as a guard against successful competition from other  
quarters. ‘The reputation of the flour and lumber of some states, and  
of the potash of others, has been established by an attention to this  
point. And the like good name might be procured for those articles,  
wheresoever produced, by a judicious and uniform system of inspec-  
tion, throughout the ports of the United States. A like system might  
also be extended with advantage to other commodities.  
  
X. The facilitating of pecuniaty remittances from place to place.

It ought readily to be conceded, that the  
cultivation of the earth, as the primary and  
most certain source of national supply ;  
as the immediate, and chief source of sub-  
sistence to man; as the principal source  
of those materials which constitute the  
nutriment of other kinds of labour ; as in-  
cluding a state most fayourable to the free-  
dom and independence of the human mind ;  
one, perhaps, most conducive to the mul-  
tiplication of the human species ; has in-  
trinsically a strong claim to pre-eminence  
over yy begee! kind of industry.  
  
But, that it hasa title to any thing like  
an exclusive ilection, in any country,  
ought to be itted with great caution.  
That itis even more productive than every  
other branch of industry, requires more  
evidence than has yet been given in sup-  
port of the position, That its real interests,  
precious and important as, without the  
help of exaggeration, they truly are, will be

‘due encoura, t of manufactures, may,  
it is believed, be satisfactorily demon-  
strated. And —_ also belie that the  
expediency of encouragement, in a  
general view, may be my be recom-  
mended by the most cogent and persuasive  
motives of national policy.  
  
It has been maintai that agriculture  
is not only the most productive, but the  
only productive species of industry. The  
reality of this suggestion, in either respect,  
has, however, not verified by any ac-  
curate detail of facts and calculations ;  
and the general arguments, which are ad-  
duced to prove it, are rather subtle and  
paradoxical, than solid or convincing.  
  
Those which maintain its exclusive pro-  
ductiveness are to this effect ;—  
  
Labour, bestowed upon the cultivation  
of land, produces enough, not only to re-  
place all the necessary expenses incurred  
in the business, and to maintain the per-  
sons who ate employed in it, but to afford,  
together with the ordinary profit on the  
stock, or capital of the farmer, a neat sur-  
plus, or rent, for the landlord or proprie-  
tor of the soil. But the labour of artifi-  
cersdoes nothing more than replace the  
stock which employs them, (or which fur-  
nishes materials, tools, and wages,) and  
  
ield the ordinary profit upon that stock.  
tyields nothing equivalent to the rent of  
land. Neither does it add any thing to  
the total value of the whole annual pro-  
duce of the land and labour of the country.  
The additional value given tc those parts  
of the produce of land, which are wrought  
into manufactures, is counterbalanced by  
the value of those other parts of that  
produce, which are consumed by the man-  
ufacturers. It can, therefore, only be by  
faving, or parsimony, not by the positive  
productiveness of their labour, that the  
classes of artificers can in any degree  
augment the revenue of the society.  
  
To this it has been answered,  
  
1. “That inasmuch as it is acknow-  
ledged, that manufacturing labour re-pro-  
duces a value equal to that which is ex-  
pended or consumed in carrying it on,  
and continues in existence original  
stock or capital emplo it ought on that  
account alone, to escape being considered  
as wholly unproductive. That though it  
should be itted, as alleged, that the  
consumption of the produce of the soil, by  
the classes of artificers or manufacturers,

their labour to the materials upon which

made out of the revenuesof those, who  
furnish or manage that which is at any time  
employed, whether in agriculture, or in  
manuiactures, or in any other way.”’  
  
But while the exciusive productiveness of  
agricultural labour has been thus denied and  
refuted, the superiority of its productive-  
ness has been conceded without hesitation.  
As this concession involvesa point of con-  
siderable maguitude, in relation to max-  
ims of public administration, the grounds  
on which it rests are worthy of a distinct  
and particular examination.  
  
One of the arguments made use of in  
  
  
  
aftificers, should at no time exceed the  
value of the produce of the land consumed  
by them, yet there would be atevery mo-  
ment, in consequence of their labour, a  
greater value of goods in the market than  
would exist independent of it.”  
  
2. “That the position, that artificers  
can augment the revenue of a society,  
only by parsimony, is true iv no other  
sense, than in one which is equally appli-  
cable‘to husbandmen or cultivators. It  
may be alike affirmed of all these classes,  
that the fund acquired by their labour  
and destined for their support, is not,  
in an ordinary way, more than equal to  
it. And hence it will follow, that aug-  
mentations of the wealth or capital of  
the community, (except in the instances  
of some extraordinary dexterity or skill,)  
can only proceed, with respect to any of  
them, from the savings of the more thrifty  
and parsimonious.”  
  
3. ‘* That the annual produce of the  
land and jabour of a couatry, can only be  
increased in two ways—by some improve-  
ment in the preducttve powers of the usefui  
labour, which actually exists within it,  
or by some increase in the quantity of  
such labour: That with regard to the first,  
the labour of artificers being capable ot  
greater subdivision and simplicity of ope-  
ration, than that of cultivators, it is sus-  
ceptible, in a proportionably greater de-  
gree, of improvement in its productive  
powers, whether to be derived from an ac-  
cession of skill, or from the application of  
ingenious machinery ; in which particular,  
therciore, the lebour employed in the cul-  
ture of land can pretend to no advantage  
over that engaged in manufactures: That  
with regard to an augmentation of the  
quantity of useful labour, this, excluding  
adventitious circumstances, must depend  
essentially upon an increase of capital,  
which again must dépend upon the savings  
  
support of the idea, may be pronounced  
‘both quaint aud. superficial. It amounts  
to this—That im the productions of the  
soil, nature c rates with man; and  
| that the effect of their joint labour must  
‘be greater than that of the labour of man  
alone.

nerally, if not universally true, applies with pecu.  
liar emphasis to the United States, on account of  
their immense tracts of fertile territory, uninhabit.  
edand unimproved. Nothing can afford so advan.  
tageous an employment for capital and labor, as the  
conversion of this extensive wilderness into cultivat.  
ed farms. Nothing equally with this, can contri.  
bute to the population, strength and real riches of  
the country.  
  
“lo endeavor, by the extraordinary patronage of  
government to accelerate the growth of manufac.  
tures, is, in fact, to endeavor by force and art to  
transfer the natural current of industry, from a more  
te a less beneficial channel. Whatever has suc) 9  
tendency must necessarily be unwise: indeed it can  
hardly ever be wise in a government, to attemntty  
give a direction to the industry of its citizens, This,  
under the quick sighted guidance of private inte.  
rest, will, if left to itself, infallibly find its own way  
to the most profitable employment; and it is by such  
employment, that the public prosperity will be  
most efiectually promoted. To leave industry to  
itself, therefore, is in almost every case, the sound.  
est ad well as the simplest policy.  
  
“This policy is aot only recommended to the  
United States, by considerations which affect all na-  
tions; it is, in a manner dictated to them by the im.  
perious force of a very peculiar situation. The  
smallness of their population, compared with their  
territory—the constant allurements to emigration  
from the settled to the unsettled parts of the coan-  
try —the facility with which the less independent  
condition »fan artisan can be exchanged for the  
more independent condition ofa farmer—these, and  
similar causes conspire to produce, and for a length  
of time, must continue to occasion, a scarcity of  
hands for manufacturing occupations, and dearness  
of labor, generally. &#x27;o these disadvantages for the  
prosecution of manufactures a deficiency ofa pecu-  
niary capital being added, the prospect ofa success-  
ful competition with the manufacturers of Europe,  
must be regarded as little less than desperate. Ex-  
tensive manufactures can only be the offspring ofa  
redundant, at least ofa full population, Till the  
latter shalicharactcrize the situation of this country,  
*tis vain to hope for the former.  
  
“If, contrary to the natural course of things, an  
unreasonable and premature spring can be given to  
  
  
  
sicy of enlarging the sphere of our domestic com-  
  
certain fabrics, by heavy duties, prohibitions, boun

every kind ofindustry.  
  
But that it has a title, to any thing like an exclu-  
sive predilection, in any country, ought to be ad-  
mitted with great caution. That itis even more  
productive than every other branch of industry, re-  
juires more evidence than has yet been given in  
support of the position. That its real interests,  
precious and important as, without the help of exag-  
geration, they truly are, will be advanced, rather  
than injured by the due encouragement of manu-  
factures, may, it is believed be satisfactorily de-  
monstrated. And it is also believed, that the ex-  
pediency of such encouragement, in a general view,  
may be shown to be recommended by the most co-  
gent and persuasive motives of national policy.  
  
“It has been maintained, that agriculture is not  
only the most productive, but the only productive  
species of industry. ‘The reality of this suggestion  
in either respect, has, however, not been verified  
byany accurate detail of facts and calculations; and  
the general arguments, which are adduced to prove  
it, are rather subtile and paradoxical, than solid and  
convincing.  
  
Those which maintain its exclusive productive-  
ness, are to this effect:  
  
“Labor bestowed upon the cultivation of land, pro-  
duces enough, not only to replace all the necessa-  
ry expenses incurred in the business, and to main-  
tain the persons who are employed in it, but to af-  
ford, together with the ordinary profit on the stock  
or capital of the farmer, a net surplus, or rent for  
the landlord or proprietor of the soil. But the la-  
hor of artificers does nothing more than replace the  
stock which employs them, or which furnishes ma-  
terials, tools, and wages, and yield the ordinary  
profitupon thatstock. It yields nothing equivalent  
tothe rent of land. Neither does it add any thing  
C0 the total value of the whole annual produce of the  
land and labor of the country. The additional va-  
“1c given to those parts of the produce of land,  
Which are wrought into manufactures, is counter  
balanced by the value of those other parts of that  
produce, which are consumed by the manufacturers.  
It can therefore only be by saving or parsimony, not  
by the positive productiveness of their labor, that  
the classes of artificers can in any degree augment  
the revenue of the society.”  
  
To this it has been answered,  
  
1. “That inasmuch as it is acknowledged, that  
manufacturing labor reproduces a value equal to  
that which is expended or consumed in carrying it  
  
on, and continues in existence the original stock or  
Capital employed, it oneht, on that account alone,  
to escape being considered as wholly unproductive:  
that though it should be admitted as alleged, that  
the Constunption of the produce of the seil, by the  
  
Kind, whi  
  
  
  
  
  
classes of artificers or manufacturers, is exactly  
equal to the value added by their labor to the mate-  
rials upon which it is exerted; yet it would not  
thence follow, that it added nothing to the revenue  
of the society or tothe aggregate value ofthe annu..  
al produce ofits land and labor. If the consump.  
tion, for any given period, amounted toa given sum,  
and the increased value of the produce manufactur.  
ed, inthe same period, to a like sum, the total  
amount of the consumption and production during  
that period, would be equal tothe two sums, and  
consequently double the value of the agricultural  
produce consumed. And though the increment of  
value, produced by the classes of artificers, should  
at no time exceed the value of the produce of Jand  
consumed by them, yet there would be every mo-  
ment, in consequence oftheir labor, a greater value  
of goods in the market, than wouid exist indepen.  
dent of it.  
  
2. “rhat the position, that artificers can augment  
the revenue ofa society only by parsimony, is true  
in no other sense, than in one which is equally ap-  
plicable to husbandmen or cultivators. It may be  
alike affirmed of all these classes, that the fund ac-  
quired by their laber, and destined for their support  
is not, inan ordinary way, more than equal to it.  
And hence it will follow, that augmentations of the  
wealth or capital of the community (except in ir.  
stances of some extraordinary dexterity or skill)  
can only proceed, with respect to any of them, from  
the savings of the more thrifty and parsimonious.  
  
3. “That the annual produce of the land and la-  
bor of a country can only be increased in two  
ways, by some improvement in the productive pow-  
ers ofthe useful labor, which actually exists within  
it, or by some increase in the quantity of such  
labor: that with regard to the first, the labor of ar-  
tificers being capable of greater subdivision and  
simplicity of operation than that of cultivators, it is  
susceptible in a proportionably greater degree, of  
improvement inits productive powers, whether to  
be derived from an accession of skill, or from the  
application of ingenious machinery, in which parti-  
cular, therefore, the labor employed in the culture  
of land can pretend to no advantage over that en-  
gaged in manufactures; that with regard to an aug-  
mentation of the quantity of useful labor, this, ex-  
cluding adyentitious circumstances, must depend  
essentially upon an increase of capital, which again”  
must depend upon the savings made out of the re-  
venues of those who furnish or manage that which  
is atany time employed, whether in mahufuctures,o

that four-sevenths nearly are women and children; of  
whom the greatest proportion are children, and many of  
them ef a tender age.  
  
And thus it appears to be one of the attributes of  
manufactures, and one of no small consequence, to  
give occasion to the exertion of a greater quantity.  
of industry, even by the same number of persons,  
where they happen to prevail; than would exist, if  
there were no such establishments.  
  
IV. As to the promoting of emigration from fo-  
reign countries.  
  
Men reluctantly quit one course of occupation and  
livelihood for another, unless invited to it by very  
apparent and proximate advantages. Many, who  
would go from one country to another, if they had  
a prospect of continuing, with more benefit, the cal-  
lings to which they have been educated, will not  
often be temptedto change their situation by the  
hope of doing better in some other way. Manufac-  
turers, who (listening to the powerful invitation of  
a better price for their fabrics, or for their labor;  
srreater cheapness of provisions andraw materials;  
of an exemption from the chief part of the taxes,  
burdens, and restraints, which they endure in the old  
world; of great personal independence and conse-  
quence, under the operation of a more equal go-  
vernment; and of what is far more precious than  
mere religious toleration, a perfect equality of re-  
Jigious privileges) would probably flock from Eu-  
rope to the United States to pursue their own trades,  
or professions, if they were once made sensible of  
the advantages they would enjoy, and were inspired  
with an assurance of encouragement and employ-  
ment; will, with difficulty, be induced to transplant  
themselves, with a view of becoming cultivators of  
land.  
  
If it be true, then, that it is the interest of the U.  
States to open every possible avenue to emigration  
from abroad, it affords a weighty argument forthe  
encouragement of manufactures, which, for the rea-  
son just assigned, willhave the strongesttendency to  
multiply the inducements to it.  
  
Here is perceived an important resource, not only  
for extending the population, and with it the useful  
and productive labor of the country, but likewise  
for the prosecution of manufactures, without de-  
ducting from the number of hands which might  
otherwise be drawn to tillage, and even for the in-  
demnification of agriculture for such as might hap-  
pen to be diverted from it. Many, whom manufac-  
turing views would induce to emigrate, would af-  
terwards yield to the temptations which the parti-  
cular situation of this country holds out to agricul-  
tural pursuits. And while agriculture would in  
other respects derive many signal and unmingled  
advantages from the growth of manufactures, it isa |  
problem whether it would gain or lose, as to tie ar-  
ticle of the number of persons employed in Carry-  
ing it on.  
  
V. As to the furnishing greater scope for the di-  
versity of talentsand dispositions, which discrimi-  
nate men from each other.  
  
This is a much more powerful mean of augment-  
ing the fund of national industry than may at first  
sightappear. It is a just observation, that minds,  
eft the strongest and most active powers for their  
proper objects, fall below mediocrity, and labor  
without effect, 1f confined to uncongenial pursuits.

human exertion may be immensely increased by dj.  
versifying its objects. When all the different kinds  
of industry obtain ina community, each individual  
can find his proper element, and call into activity  
the whole vigor of hisnature. Andthe community  
is benefited by the services ofits respective mem-  
bers inthe manner in which each can serve it with  
most effect.  
  
If there be any thing ina remark often tobe met  
with, namely, that there is, in the genius of the  
people of this country, a peculiar aptitude for me-  
chanic improvements, it would operate as a forci-  
ble reason for giving opportunities to the exercise  
of that species of talent, by the propogation of ma.  
nufactures.  
  
VI. As to the affording a more ample and various  
field for enterprize.  
  
This also is of greater consequence in the gene-  
  
ral scale of national exertion, than might perhaps  
on a superticial view be supposed, and has effects  
not altogether dissimilar from those of the cir-  
cumstance last noticed.—To cherish and stimulate  
the activity ofthe human mind by multiplying the  
objects of enterprize, is not among the least consi-  
derable of the expedients, by which the wealth of  
a nation may be promoted. Even things, in them-  
selves not positively advantageous, sometimes  
becomes so, by their tendency to provoke exertion.  
—Every new scene which is opened to the busy  
nature of man, to rouse and exert itself, is the ad-  
dition of a new energy to the general stock of ef:  
fort.  
_ The spirit of enterprize, useful and prolific as it  
is, Must necessarily be contracted or expanded in  
proportion to the simplicity or variety of the occu-  
pations and productions which are to be found ina  
society. It must be less in a nation of mere culti-  
vators than in a nation of cultivators and merchants;  
less ina nation of cultivators and merchants, than  
in a nation of cultivators, artificers and merchants.  
  
VII. As to the creating, in some instances, a new,  
and securing in all amore certain and steady de-  
mand for the surplus produce of the soil.  
  
This isamong the most important of the circum-  
stances which have been indicated. It is a princi-  
pal mean by which the establishment of manufac-  
tures contribute to an augmentation of the pro-  
duce or revenue of a country, and has an immedi-  
ate and direct relition tothe prosperity of agricul-  
ture.  
  
It is evident that the exertions of the husbandman  
will be steady or fluctuating, vigorous or feeble, in  
proportion tothe steadiness or fluctuation, adequate-  
ness or inadequateness of the markets on which he  
must depend, for the vent of the surplus which may  
be produced by his labor; and that such surplus, in  
the ordinary course of things, will be greater or  
less in the same proportion. ,  
  
For the purpose of this vent, a domestic market  
greatly to be preferred toa foreign one; because it},  
in the nature of things, far more to be relicd on.  
  
It is a primary object of the policy of nations, to  
be able to supply themselves with subsistence from  
their own soils; and manufacturing nations, as far as  
circumstances permit, endeavor to procure from the  
same source, the raw materials necessary for their  
own fabrics. This disposition, urged by the spirit  
of monopoly, is sometimes even carried to an Inju-  
It seems not always to be recol-

togive a due course to this exchange, they must of  
  
necessity make every possible effort to manufacture  
for themselves; the eifect of which is, that the manu-  
hactureng nations abridge the natural advantages of  
  
agricultural countries to enjoy the advantage of theirs,  
and sacrifice the interest of a mutually beneficial in-  
tercourse to ea vain project of selling every thing  
and buying notinng.  
  
ak it is sles a cannes of the policy which  
has Been noted, that the foreign demand for the  
products ofagricultural countries és ina great derree  
rather casual. and occasional, than certain or con-  
stant. ‘To what extent injurious interruptions of  
the demand for some of the staple commouities of  
the United States, may have been experienced from  
that cause, must be referred to the judgment of  
those who are engaged in carrying on the com-  
merce of the country, but it may be safely affirm-  
edthat such interruptions are at times very incon-  
veniently felt, and that cases not frequently occur,  
jn which markets are so confined and restricted, as |  
to render the demand very unequal to the supply.  
  
Independently likewise of the artificial impedi-  
ments which are created by the policy in question,  
there ave natural causes tending to render the external  
demand for the surplus of agricul:ural nations a pre-  
carious reliance. ‘The difference of seasons in the  
countries which are the consumers, make immense  
differences in the produce of their own soils, in  
different years, and consequently in the degrees of  
their necessity for foreign supply. Plentiful har-  
vests with them, especially if similar ones eccur at  
the same time in the countries which are the fur-  
nishers, occasion of course a glut in the markets of  
the latter.  
  
Considering how fast and how much the progress  
of new settlements in the United States must in-  
crease the surplus produce of the soil, and weigh-  
ing the tendency of the system which preyails  
among most of the commercial nations of Europe;  
whatever dependence may be placed on the force  
of natural circumstances to counteract the effects of  
an artificial policy; there appear strong reasons to re-  
gardthe foreign demand for that surplus, as too uncer-  
tain @ reliance, and to desire a substitute for it in an  
ectensive domestic market.  
  
‘’o secure such a market there is no other expedient  
than to promote manufacturing establishments. Ma-  
nufacturers, who constitute the most numerous class,  
after the cultivators of land, are for that reason the  
principal consumers of the surplus of their labor.  
  
This idea of an extensive domestic market for the  
surplus produce of the soilis of the first consequence.  
It is, of all things, that which most effectually con-  
duces to a flourishing state of agriculture. If the  
effect of manuiactories should be to detach a por-  
tion of the hands, which would otherwise be en-  
gared in tillage, it might possibly cause a smaller  
quantity of lands to be under cultivation: but by  
their tendency to procure a more certain demand  
for the surplus produce of the soil, they would at  
the same time, cause the lands which were in culti-  
vation, to be better improved and more productive.  
And while, by theirinfluence, the condition of each  
individual farmer would be meliorated, the total  
mass of agricultural production would probably be  
increased. Forthis mustevidently depend as much,  
if not more, upon the degree of improvement, than  
  
ates a demand for such as were either unknown, or pro-  
duced in inconsiderable quantities. The bowels, sa  
well as the surface of the earth, are ransacked for  
articles which were before neglected. Animals,  
plants and minerals acquire a utility and value,  
which were before unexplored.  
  
The foregoing considerations seem sufficient to  
establish, as general propositions, that it is the in-  
terest of nations to diversify the industrious pursuits  
of the individuals who compose them—that the es-  
tablishment of manufactures is calculated not only to in-  
crease the general stock of useful and productive labar,  
but even to improve the state of agriculture in parti-  
cular, certainly to advance the interests of those  
who are engaged in it. There are other views  
that will be hereafter taken of the subject, which  
it is conceived will serve to confirm these infe-  
rences.

1. If the system of perfect liberty to industry and  
commerce, were the prevailing system of nations,  
the arguments which dissuade a country in the pre-  
dicament of the United States, fromthe zealous  
pursuit of manufactures, would doubtless have great  
force, It will not be affirmed that they might not  
be permitted, with few exceptions, to serve asa  
rule of national conduct. In such a state of things,  
each country would have the full benefit of its pe-  
culiar advantages, to compensate for its deficiencies  
or disadvantages. If one nation was ina condition  
to supply manufactured articles on better terms  
than another, that other might find an abundant in-  
demnification in a superior capacity to furnish the  
produce of the soil. Andafree exchange, mutually  
beneficial, of the commodities which each was able  
to supply, on the best terms, might be carried on  
between them, supporting in full vigor the industry  
of each. And though the circumstances which have  
been mentioned, and others which will be unfolded  
hereafter, render it probable that nations, merely  
agricultural, would not enjoy the same degrees of  
opulence, in proportion to their numbers, as those  
which united manufactures with agriculture; yet the  
progressive improvement of the lands of the former,  
might, in the end, atone for an inferior degree of  
opulence in the meantime; and in a casein which  
opposite considerations are pretty equally balanced,  
the option ought, perhaps, always to be infavor of  
leaving industry to its own direction, But the sys-  
tem which has been mentioned is far from charac-  
terising the general policy of nations.—The pre-  
valent one has been regulated by an opposite spirit.  
The consequence of it is, that the United States are,  
to a certain extent, in the situation of a country  
precluded frem foreign commerce. They can in-  
deed, without difficuity, obtain from abroad, the ma-.  
nufactured supplies of which they are in want; but  
they experience numerous and very injurious im-  
pediments tothe emission and vent of their own  
commodities. Nor is this the case in reference toa  
single foreign nation only. The regulations of seve-  
ral countries with which we have the most exten-  
sive intercourse, throw serious obstructions in the  
way of the principal staples of the United States.

factures. The desire of being an independent pro-  
prietor of land, is founded on such strong principles  
  
mm the human breast, that where the opportunity of:  
  
becoming s0, isas great as it isin the United States,  
the proportion will be small of those, whose situa-  
tions would otherwise lead to it, who would be di-  
verted from it towards manufactures. And it is  
highly probable, as already intimated, that the ac-  
cession of foreigners, who, originally drawn over by  
manufacturing views, would afterwards abandon  
them for agricultural, would be more than an equi-  
valent for those of our own citizens, who might hap-  
pen to be detached from them.  
  
The remaining objections to a particular encou-  
ragement of manufactures in the U, States now re-  
quire to be examined.  
  
One of these turns on the proposition, that in-  
dustry, if left to itself, will naturally find its way to  
the mostuscful and profitable employment. Whence  
it is inferred, that manufactures, withwut the aid of  
government, will grow up as soon, and as fast as the  
natural state of things, and the interest of the com-  
munity may require.  
  
Against the solidity of this hypothesis, in the full  
latitude of the terms, very cogent reasons may be  
  
‘offered. These have &quot;relation to the strong influ-  
ence of habit, and the spirit of imitation, the fear  
of want of success in untried enterprizes, the intrin-  
sic difficulties incident to first essays towards a com

stow. To be enabled to contend with success, it  
is evident, that the interference and aid of their  
government are indispensable. Combinations by  
those engaged in a particular branch of business in  
one country, to frustrate the first efforts to introduce  
itinanother, by temporary sacrifices, recompensed  
perhaps by extraordinary indemnifications of the  
government of such country, are believed to have  
existed, andare not to be regarded, as destitute of  
probability, The existence or assurance of aid from  
the government of the country in which the busi-  
ness is to be introduced, may be essential to fortify  
adventurers against the dread of such combinations  
—to defeat their effects, if formed, and to prevent  
their being formed, by demonstrating that they  
must in the end prove fruitless. Whatever room  
there may be for an expectation that the industry of  
a people, under the direction of private interest,  
will upon equal terms find out the most beneficial  
employment for itself: there is none for a reliance;  
that it will struggle against the force of unequal  
terms, or will of itself surmount all the adventitious  
barriers to a successful competition which may have  
been erected from practice and previous posse:,&gt; 0m  
of the ground, or by those which may have sprung  
from positive regulation, and an artificial policy.  
This general reflection might alone suffice as an an-  
swer tothe objection under examination; exclusive-  
ly of the weighty considerations which have been  
particularly urged.

and other household utensils, the steel and iron  
work of carriages, and for ship building; anchors,  
scale beams and weights, and various tools of arti-  
ficers; arms of different kinds; though the manu-  
facture of these last has of late diminished for want  
of demand. ;

wool and cotton cards, and other machinery for  
manufactures and husbandry, mathematical instru-  
ments, coopers’ wares of every kind.

twine and pack thread.

Besides manufactories of these articles which are

considerable degree of maturity, there is a vast  
scene of household manufacturing which contri-  
butes more largely to the supply of the community

omitted. And there are many attempts still in their  
infancy, which, though attended with very favora«  
ble appearances, could not have been properly coms  
prised in an enumeration of manufactories already  
established.—There are other articles also of great  
importance, which, though strictly speaking manu-  
faciures, are omitted as being immediately connect-  
ed with husbandry; such as flour, pot and pearl ash,  
pitch, tar, turpentine and the like.  
  
There remains to be noticed an objection to the  
encouragement of manufactures, of a nature differ,  
ent from those, which question the probability of  
success—this is derived from its supposed tenden-  
cy to give a monopoly of advantages to particular  
classes, at the expense of the rest of the communi-  
ty, who, itis affirmed, would be able to procure the  
requisite supplies of manufactured articles on bet-  
ter terms from foreigners, than from our own citi-  
zens,‘and who, it is alleged, are reduced to a ne-  
eessity of paying an enhanced price for whatever  
they want, by every measure which obstructs the  
free competition of toreign commodities.  
  
Is it not an unreasonable supposition, that mea-  
sures which serve toabridge the free competition of  
foreign articles, have a tendency to occasion an en-  
hancement of prices, and itis not to be denied,  
that such is the effect of a number of cases: but the  
fact does not uniformly correspond with the theory,  
A reduction of prices has, in several instances, im-  
mediately succeeded the establishment of a domes-  
tic manufacture. Whether it be that foreign ma-  
nufacturers endeavor to supplant, by underselling  
our own, or whatever else be the cause, the effect  
has been such as is stated, and the reverse of what  
might have been expected.  
  
But though it were true, that the immediate and  
certain efiect of regulations controlling the compe-  
tition of foreign with domessic fabrics, was an in-  
crease of price, itis universally true, that the con-  
trary is the ultimate effect with every successfud  
manufacture. Whena domestic manufacture has  
attained to perfection, and has engaged in the pre-  
secution of it acompetent number of persons, it in-  
variably becomes cheaper. Being free from the  
heavy charges which attend the importation of fo-  
reign commodities, it can be afforded, and accord-  
ingly seldom or never fails, to be sold cheaper, in  
process of time, than wasihe foreign article tor  
which itis a substitute. The internal competition,  
which takes place, soon does away every thing like  
monopoly, and by degrees reduces the price of the  
article to the minimum of a reasonable profit on the  
capital employed.—This accords with the reason of  
the thing and with experience.  
  
Whence it follows, that it is the interest of the  
community, with a view to eventual and perma-  
nent economy, to encourage the growth of manufac-  
tures. Ina national view, a temporary enhance-  
ment of price must always be well compensated by  
a permanent reduction of it.  
  
It isa reflection, which may with propriety be  
indulged here, that this eventual diminution of the  
prices of manufactured articles, which is the result  
of internal manufacturing establishments, has a di-  
rect and very important tendency to benefit agri-  
culture. It enables the farmer to procure, with a  
smiller quantity of his labor, the manufactured pro-  
duce of which he stands in need, and consequently  
increases the value of his income and property.

presperity of nations.  
  
From these circumstances collectively, two im.  
portant inferences are to be drawn; one, that there  
is always ahigher prebability of a favorable balance  
of trade, in regard to countries, in which manufac.  
tures, founded on the basis ofa thriving agriculture,  
flourish, than in regard to those, which are confined  
wholly or almost whelly to agriculture; the other,  
(which is also a consequence of the first) that coun.  
  
and agricultural, will be more lucrative and pros- ; tries of the former description are likely to possess  
  
perous, than that of a country which is merely agri-  
cultural.

the products of the former, are liable to very consi- | tials of national supply. These comprise the means  
  
derable fluctaations and interruptions. The great  
inequalities, resulting from difference of seasons,  
have been elsewhere remarked: this uniformity of  
demand, on one side, and unsteadiness of it on the  
other, must necessarily have a tendency to cause  
the general course of the exchange of commodities  
between the parties, to turn to the disadvantage of  
the merely agricultural states. Peculiarity of situa-  
tion, a climate and soil adapted tothe production of  
peculiar commodities, may, sometimes, contradict  
the rule; but there is every reason to believe, that  
it will be found, in the main, a just one.  
  
Another circumstance, which gives a superiority  
of commercial advantages to states that manufac-  
ture, as well as cultivate, consistsin the more nu-  
merous attractions, which a more diversified mar-  
ket offers to foreign customers, and in the greater  
scope which it affordsto mercantile enterprize. It  
is a position of indisputable truth in commerce, de-  
pending too on very obviousreasons, that the great-  
est resort will be to those markets, where commodi-  
ties, while equally abundant, are most various.  
Each difference of kind holds out an additional in-  
ducement; and it isa position not less clear, that the  
field of enterprize must be enlarged to the mer-  
chants of a country, in proportion to the variety as  
well as the abundance of commodities which they  
findat home for exportation to foreign markets.  
  
A third circumstance, perhaps not inferior to  
either of the other two, conferring the superiority  
which has been stated, has relation to the stagna-  
tions of demand for certain commodities which at  
some time or other interfere more or less with the  
sale ofall.—The nation which can bring to market  
but few articles, is likely to be more quickly and  
sensibly aftected by such stagnations, than one,  
which is always possessed of a great variety of com-  
modities; the former frequently findstoo great a  
portion ofits stock of materials, tor sale or ex-  
change, lyingon hand—or is obliged to make inju-  
rious sacrificesto supply its wants of foreign articles,  
which are numerous and urgent, in proportion to  
the smallness of the number of its own. ‘The latter  
commonly finds itself indemnified, by the high pri-  
ces ofsome articles, for the low prices of others—  
andthe prompt and advantageous sale of those ar-  
ticles which are in demand, enables its merchants  
the better to wait fora favorable change, in respect  
to those which are not. —There is ground to believe,

ited States  
during the late war, from an incapacity of supplying  
themselves, are still matters of keenrecollection; a  
future war might be expected again to exemplify  
the mischiefs and dangers of a situation, to which  
that incapacity is still in too great a degree applica-  
ble, unless changed by timely and vigorous exer-  
tions. Yoeffect this change as fast as shall be pru-  
dent, merits all the attention and all the zeal of our  
public councils; *tis the next great work to be ac-  
complished.  
  
The want of anavy to protect our external com-  
merce, as long at it shall continue, must render ita  
peculiarly precarious reliance, for the supply of es-  
sential articles; and must serve to strengthen pro-  
digiously the arguments in favor of manufactures.  
  
To these general considerations are added some  
of a more particular nature.  
  
Our distance from Europe, the great fountain of  
manufactured supply, subjects us, in the existing  
state of things, to inconvenience and loss,in two  
ways.  
  
The bulkiness of those commodities which are  
the chief productions of the soil, necessarily impo-  
ses heavy charges on their transportation, to dis-  
tant markets. These charges in the cases in which  
the nations, to whom our products are sent, main-  
tain a competition in the supply of their own mar-  
kets, principally fall upon us, and form material de-  
ductions, from the primative value of the articles  
furnished. The charges on manufactured supplics  
brought from Europe, are greatly enhanced by the  
same circumstance of distance. These charges  
again, in the casesin which our own industry main-  
tains no competition, in our own markets, also prin-  
cipally fall upon us; and are an additional cause of  
extraordinary deduction from the primative value  
of our own products; these being the materials of  
exchange for the foreign fabrics which we consume.  
  
The equality and moderation of individual pro-  
perty, and the growing settlements of new districts,  
occasion, in this country, an unusual demand for

coarse manufactures; the charges of which being  
greater in proportion to their greater bulk, aug-  
ment the disadvantage, which has just been dce-  
scribed.  
  
As in most countries, domestic supplies maintain  
a very considerable competition with such foreign  
productions of the soil as are imported for sale, if  
the extensive establishment of manufactories in the  
United States does not create a similar competition  
in respect to manufactured articles, it appears to  
he clearly deducible, from the considerations which  
have been mentioned, that they must sustain a dou-  
ble loss intheir exchanges with foreign nations,  
strongly conducive to an unfavorable balance of  
trade, and very prejudicial to their interests,  
  
  
  
  
  
These disadvantages press with no small weight  
onthe landed interest of the country. Ja seasons  
of peace, they cause a serious deduction from the tn-  
trinsic value of the products of the soil. In the time  
of awar, which should cither involve ourselves, or  
another nation, possessing a considerable share of  
our carrying trade, the charges on the transporta-  
tion of our commodities, bulky as most of themare,  
eould hardly failto prove a grievous burcden tothe  
farmer, while obliged to depend in so greata de-  
gree as he now does, upon foreign markets, for the  
vent of the surplus of his labor.

ern and southern regi-  
ons are sometimes represented as having adverse  
interests in this respect. Those are called manu-  
facturing, these agricultural states; and a species of  
opposition is imagined to subsist between the ma-  
nufacturing an! agricultural interest.  
  
This idea of an opposition between those two in-  
terests is the common error of the early periods of  
cvery country; but experience gradually dissipates  
it. Indeed they are perceived so often to succour  
and to befriend each other, that they come at length  
to be considered as one: a supposition which has  
been frequently abused, and is not universally true.  
Particular encouragements of particular manufac-  
tures may be ofa nature to sacrifice the interest of  
landholders to those of manufacturers: but it is ne-  
vertheless a maxim well estab} shed by experience,  
and generally acknowledged wheve there has heen  
suficient experience, that the “aggregate” prospe-  
rity of manufactures, and the “aggregate” prospe-  
  
  
  
= = =  
market for the surplus produce of the soil, is aione  
a colvincing argument of its truth.  
  
Ideas of a conirariety of interests between the  
northern and soutiiern regions of the union, are m  
the main as unfounded as they are mischievous,  
The diversity of circumstances, on which such a  
contraricty is usually predicated, authorises a di-  
rectly contrary conclusion. Mutual wants consti-  
tute one of the strongest links of political connexion;  
and the extent ofthese bearsa natural proportion  
tothe diversity in the means of mutual supply.  
  
Suggestions of an opposite complexion are ever  
tobe deplored, as unfriendly to the steady pursuit  
of one greatcommon cause, and to the perfect har-  
mony ofall the parts.  
  
In proportion as the mind is accustomed to trace  
he intimate connexion of interest, whiclr subsists  
between all parts of society, united under the same  
government—the infinite variety of channels which  
serve to circulate the prosperity of each and  
through the rest—in that proportion it will be little  
apt to be disturbed by solicitudes and apprehen-  
sions, Which origimate in local discriminations. If.  
isa truth as importznt as it is agreeable, and oneto  
which it is not easy to imagine. exceptions, that  
every thingtending to establish substantial and per-  
manent order, in the affairs of a country, to in-  
crease the total mass of industry and opulence, is  
ultimately beneficial to every part of it. On the  
creditof this great truth, an acquiescence may safe-  
ly be accorded, from every quarter, to all institu.  
tions, and arrangements, which promisea confirma-  
tion of public order, and an augmentation of nation-  
al resource.  
  
But there are more particular considerations  
which serve to fortify the idea, that the encourage-  
ment of manufactures is the interest of all parts of  
the union. Ifthe northern and middle states should  
be the principal scenes of such establisy:nents, they  
would immediately benefit the more southern, py  
creating a demand for productions, some of which  
they have in common with the other states, and  
others of which are either peculiar to them, or more  
abundant, or of better quality than elsewhere,  
These productions, principally, are timber, flax,  
hemp, cotton, wool, raw silk, indigo, iron, lead, furs,  
hides, skinsand coals; of these articles, cotton and  
indigo are peculiar te the southern states; as are,  
hitherto, lead and coal; flax and hemp are or may  
be raised in greater abundance there, than inthe  
more northern states; and the wool of Virginia ‘is  
said to be of better quality than that of any other  
state: a circumstance rendered the more probable  
by the reflection, that Virginia embraces the same  
latitudes with the finest woolcountries of Europe.  
The climate of the south is also better adapted to  
the production of silk. :  
  
The extensive cultivation of cotton can perhaps: .

expense: premiums  
serve to reward some particular excellerice or su-  
periority, some extraordinary exertion or skill, and  
are dispensed only in a small number of cases.—  
But their effect is to stimulate general effort, con-  
trived so as to be both honorary and lucrative, they  
address themselves to different passions, touching  
the chords as well of emulation as of interest. They  
are accordingly a very economical means of excite  
ing the enterprize of a whole community.  
  
there are various societies in different countrie%  
whose objectis the dispensation of premiums for the  
  
encouragement of agriculture, arts, manufactures,  
and commerce: and tho’ they are, for the most part  
voluntary associations, with comparatively slender  
funds, their utility has been immense.  
  
Much has  
been done by this mean in Great Britain; Scotland  
in particular, owes materially to it a prodigious amc-  
lioration of condition. From a similar establishment  
in the United States, supplied and supported by the  
goverment of the union, vast benefits might reason-  
ably be expected.  
  
Vi. The exemption of the meterials of manufac-  
tures from duty.  
  
The policy of that exemption, as a general rule,  
particuiarly in reference to new establishments, is  
obvious. Itcan hardly ever be advisable to add the  
obstructions of fiscal burdens to the difficulties  
which naturally embarrass anew manufacture; and  
where it is matured and in condition to become an  
object of revenue, it is, generally speaking, better  
that the fabric, than the material, should be the sub-  
ject oftaxation. Ideas of proprotion between the  
quantum of the tax and the value of the article can  
be more easily adjusted in the former than in the  
latter case, An argument for exemptions of this kind  
in the United States, is to be derived from the prac-  
tice, as far as their necessities have permitted, ot  
those nations whom we are to meet as competitors  
in our own and in foreign markets.

Vil. Drawbacks of the duties which are imposed  
onthe materials of manufactures.  
  
It has already been observed, as a general rule,  
that duties on those meterials ought, with certain  
exceptions, to be forborne. Of these exceptions,  
three cases occur, which may serve as exainples—  
one, where the material is itself an chject of general  
or extensive consumption, and a fit and productive  
source of revenue;—another, where a rmuanufacture  
of a simpler kind, the competition of which with a  
like domestic article is desired to be restrained,  
partakes of the nature of a raw material, from being  
capable, by a further process, to be converted into a  
manufacture of a different kind, the introduction or  
growth of which is desired tobe encouraged: a third,  
where the material itselris a production of the coun.  
try, and in sufficient abundance to furnisha cheap  
and plentiful supply to the national manufacturers,  
  
Under the first description comes the article of

The article of hemp either now does or may be  
expected soon to exemplify the third case, in the  
United States.  
  
Where duties on the materials of manufactures  
are not laid for the purpose of preventing a competi-  
tion with some domestic production, the same rea-  
sons which recommend, as a general rule, the ex-  
emption of those materials from duties, would re-  
commend, as a like general rule, the allowance of  
drawbacks in iavor of the manufacturer: according-  
ly, such drawbacks are familiar in countries which  
systematically pursue the business of manufactures;  
which furnishes an argument for the observance of  
a similar policy in the United States; and the idea  
fas been adopted by laws of the union, in the in-  
stances of salt and molasses. Itis believed that it  
will be found advantageous to extend it to other  
articles.  
  
Vill. The encouragement of new inventions and  
discoveries, at home, and of the introduction into  
the United States of such as may have been made  
in other countries; particuliarly those which re-  
Jate to machinery.  
  
it is customary with manufacturing nations to pro-  
hibit, under severe penalties, the exportation of  
implements and machines, they have either invent-  
ed or improved. Where are already objects for a  
similar regulation in the United States; and others  
may be expected to occur from time to time.—  
The adoption of it seems to be dictated by the prin-  
ciple of reciprocity. Greater liberality, in such re-  
spects, might better comport with the general spirit  
et the country; but a selfish and exclusive policy in  
other quarters, will not always permit the free in-!  
dulgence ofa spirit which would place us upon an  
equal footing. As far as prohibitions tend to pre-  
rent foreign competitors from deriving the benefit of  
the improvements made at home, they tend to in-  
crease the advantages of those by whom they may  
have been introduced —and operate as an encou-  
ragement to exertion.  
  
IX, Judicious regulations for the inspection of  
matrufactured commodities.  
  
  
  
means, by which the prosperity of manufactures may  
be promoted. It isindeedin many cases one of the  
most essential. Contributing to prevent frauds upon  
consumers at home, and exporters to foreign coun-  
trics—to improve the quality and preserve the cha-  
racter of the national manufactures, it cannot fail to  
aid the expeditious and advantageous sale of them,  
and to scrve asa guard against successful competi-  
tion from other quarters. The reputation of the  
fiour and lumber of some states, aud of the potash  
of others, bas been esiablished by an attention to  
this point. And the like good name might be pro-  
cured for those articles, wheresoever produecd,  
y a judicious and uniform system of inspection  
throughout the ports of the United States. A like  
system might, also, be extended with advantage to  
other commodities  
  
XK. The facilitating of pecuniary remittances from  
place to place.

The possibility of a diminution of the revenue,  
may present itself, as an objection to the alTange.  
ments which have been submitted.  
  
But there is no truth which may be more firmly  
relied upon, than that the interests of the revenue  
are promoted by whatever promotes an increase 9;  
‘national industry and wealth.  
  
In proportion to the degree of these, is the capa.  
city of every country to contribute to the public  
treasury; and when the capacity to pay is increas.  
ed, or even is not decreased, the only consequence  
of measures which diminish any particular resource  
isthe change of the object. If by encouraging the  
manufacture of an article at home, the revenue,  
which has been wont to accrue from its importation,  
should be lessened, an indemnification can easily be  
found, either out of the manufacture itself, or from  
some other object which may be deemed more con.  
venient.

** Considering how fast and how much the progress of new settlements in  
** the United States must increase the surplus prepuce of the soil, and weigh-  
** ing jieriously the tendency of the system, which prevails among most of the  
** commercial nations of Europe, whatever dependence may be placed on the  
** force of natural circuma(»ncesto counteract the effects of an artificial policy;  
  
there appear strong reasene f regard the foreign detnanil for that ourpluo, as  
** too uncertain a reliance, and to desire a substitute for it in an extensive domestic  
** market.  
  
** To secure such a market, there is no other expi^ent, than to promote manufac^  
taring establishments. Manufacturers, who constitute the most numerous class,  
after the cultivators of the land, are for that reason the principal consumers  
of the surplus of their labour.  
  
** This idea of an extensive domestic market for the surplus produce of the soil,  
is of the first consequence. It is, of all things, thtU lohich most effectually con-  
** duces to a flourishing state of agriadture. If the effect of manufactories  
should be to detach a portion of the hands, which would otherwise be en-  
gaged in tillage, it might possibly cause a sn^er quantity of lands to be un-  
der cultivation; but by their tendency to procure a more certiun demand for  
the surplus produce of the soil, they would, at the same time, cause the  
^ lands, which were in cultivation, to be better improved and more productive.  
** And while, by their influence, the condition of each individual farmer woM be  
** meliorated, the total mass of agricultural production would probably be hmreased.  
** For this must evidently depend as much, if not more, upon the degree ofimprsmement,  
“ than upon the number of acres under culture.  
  
It merits particular observation, that the multiplication of manufactories not  
** only furnishes a market for those articles which have been accustomed to be produced  
** in abundance, in a country ; but it likewise avates a demand for such as were either  
** unknown or produced in inconsiderable quantities. The bowels as well as the sur-  
face of the earth are ransacked for articles which were before neglected.  
Animals, plants, and minerals acquire a utility and value, which were before  
“ unexplored.  
  
The foregoing considerations seem sufficient to establish as general propo*  
sitions, that it is the interest of nations to diversify the industrious pursuits  
** of the individuals who compose them^that the establishment of manufactures  
** is calculated not only to increase the general stock of useful and productive labour,  
  
** but even to improve the state of agriculture in particular, certainly to advance the  
interests of those who are engaged in it.** Alexander Hamilton, voL 1. p. 182.

«If the system of perfect liberty to industry  
and commerce, were the prevailing system of  
nations, the arguments which dissuade a coun-  
try in the predicament of the United States, from  
a zealous pursuit of manufactures, would doubt- |  
less have great force.”’*** &lt;‘* But this system is  
far frgm characterising the general policy of na-  
tions. The prevalent one hasbeen regulated by  
an opposite spirit. The consequence of it is,  
that the United States are, to acertain extent, in  
the situation of a country‘precluded from foreign  
commerce. They can, indeed, without difficul-  
ty, obtain from abroad the manufactured supplies |  
ef which they are in want. But they experience ||  
numerous and very injurious impediments to the |,  
emission and vent of their commodities. Nor is  
this the case in reference to a single foreign na-  
tion only. The regulations of several countries  
with which we have the most extensive intercourse,  
throw serious-obstructions in the way of the princt-  
pal staples of the United States.”’ Alexander Ha

Extensive manufactures can only be the off-

given to certain fabgics, by heavy duties, pro-

monopoly, must be defrayed at the expense of

«It is now proper to enumerate the princi-  
pal circumstances, from which it may be infer-  
red—that manufacturing establishments not  
only occasion a positive augmentation of the  
produce and revenue of the society, but that  
  
than they could possibly be, withoat such es-  
tablishments. These circumstances are,  
  
1. “ The division of labour,  
  
2. “An extension of the use of machinery.  
  
3. * Additional employment to classes of the  
community not ordinarily engaged in business.

eign countries.  
  
5 “ The turnishing greater scope for the di-  
versity of talents and dispositions which dis-  
criminate nen from each other.  
  
6. “ The afiording a more ample and vari-  
ous field for enterprise.  
  
7. “% The creating, in some instances,a new, |  
and securing in all, a more certain and steady  
demand for the surplus produce of the soil.  
  
“ Each of those circumstances has a consid-  
evable influence upon the total mass of indus-  
trious effort ina community: together, they  
add to ita degree of energy and effect, which  
are not easily conceived. Some comments up-

“This is not among the least valuable  
of the maens by which manufacturing institu-  
tutions contribute to augment the general stock  
of industry end productive. In places where  
these intitutions prevail, besides the persons  
regularly engaged inthem, they afford oecca-  
sional and extra employment for idustrious in-  
dividuals and families, who are willing to de-  
vote tha leisure from the intermissions of their  
ordinary pursuits to collateral labours, as a re-  
source for multiplying their acquisitions or en-  
joyments. The husbandman himself experien-  
ces @ new source of profit and support from  
increased industry of his wife and daughters;  
invited and stimulated by tie demands of the  
neighhouring manufactories.  
  
“ Besides this advantage of occasional em-  
ployment to classes having different occupa-  
tions, there is another of a nature allied to it,  
and ofa similar tendency. This is, the employ-  
ment of persons who would otherwise be idle  
(and in many cases a borden on the society)  
either from the bias of temper, habit, infirmity  
ot body, Of some other cause, indisposing or  
disqualif for the toils of the country. It is  
feular remark, that, in general.  
are rendered mere useful,  
aud the latter more early useful, by analac-  
turing establishments, than they would other-|  
wise be. Of the number of perons employed  
in the cotton manufactories of Great Britatny, it  
is computed that four sevenths nearly are wo-  
men and children ; of whom the greatest pro-  
portion are childran, aud many of them of a  
tender age.  
  
** And thus it appears to be one of the attri-  
hutes of manufactures, one of so small conse-  
quence, to give occasion to the exertion of a  
greater quantity of industry, even by the same  
number of persons, where they happen to pre-  
vail, than would exist, if there were no such es-  
tablishments.

IV. “ As to the promotion of emigration  
from foreign countries.  
  
“ Men reluctantly quit one course of occu-  
pation and livelihood for another, unless invit-  
ed to it by very apparent and proximate ad-  
vantages. Many who would go from one  
country to another, if they had a prospect of  
continuing with more benefit, the callings to  
which they have been educated, will not often  
be tempted to change their situation by the  
hope of doing better in some other way. Man-  
ufacturers, who, (listening to the powerful in-  
vitation of a better price for their fabrics, or  
for their labour; of greater cheapness of pro-  
visions and raw materials ; of an exemption  
from the chief part of the taxes, burdens and  
restraints, which they endure in the old world ;  
of greater personal independence and conse-  
quence, uuder the operation of a more equal  
government ; and of what is far more pre-  
cious than mere religious toleration, a perfect  
equality of religious privileges,) would proba-  
bly flock from Europe to the United States to  
pursue their trades or professions, if they were  
once made sensible of the advantages they  
would enjoy, and were inspired with an assur-  
ance of encouragement and employment ; will  
with difiiculty, be induced to transplant them-  
selves, with a view of becoming cultivators of  
land.  
  
“If it be trife, then, that it is the interest of  
the United States to open every possible ave-  
nue to emigration from abroad, it affords a  
weighty argument for the encouragement of  
manufactures ; which, for the reason just as-  
signed, will have the strongest tendency to mul-  
tiply the inducements to it.  
  
“‘ Here is perceived an important resource,  
not only for extending the population, and with  
it the useful and productive labour of the coun-  
try, but likewise for the prosecution of manu-  
  
hands which might otherwise be drawn to til-  
lage ; and even for the indemnification of agri-  
culture for such as might happen to be divert-  
Many whom manvfacturing views  
would induce to emigrate, would afterwards  
yield to the temptations, which the particular  
situation of this country holds out to agricultu-  
ral pursuits. And while agriculture would in  
other respects derive many signal and unmin-  
gled advantages, from the growth of manufac-  
tures, it is a problem, whether it would gain or

permit the agricultural countries to enjoy the  
sdvantages of theirs ; and sacrifice the inter-  
est of a mutually beneficial intercourse to the  
vain project of selling every thing and buying  
vothing.  
  
* But it is also a consequence of the policy,  
which has been noted, that the foreign demand  
for the products of agricultural countries, is in  
a great degree rather casual and occasional,  
than certain or constant. To what extent in-  
jurious interruptions of the demand for some of  
the staple commodities of the United States,  
may have been experienced, from that canse  
must be refesred to the judgement of those  
who areengaged in carrying on the commerce of  
the country: but ii may be safely affirmed, that  
such interruptions are at times very inconven-  
iently felt, and that cases not unfrequently oc-  
cur,in which markets are so confined and re-  
stricted, as to render the demand very unequal  
to the supply.  
  
“ Independently likewike of the artificial im-  
pediments, which are created by the policy in  
question, there are natural causes tending to  
render thé external demand for the surplus of  
agricultural nations a precarious reliance.  
The differences of seasons in the countries  
which are consumers, make immense differen-  
ces in the produce of their own soils, in diiler-  
ent years, and conseqnentiy in the degrees of  
icir necessity for foreign supply.  Plentifal  
harvests with them, especially if similar ones  
  
  
  
s gh  
eceuy et the same tune in the countries which  
  
ure furnishers, oceasion of course a glut in those |  
markets of the latter.  
  
“ Considering how fast and how much the  
progress of new settlements in the United States _  
must increase the surplus produce of the soil,  
and weighing seriously the tendency of the sys-  
tem, which prevails among most of the com-  
mercial nations of Europe, whatever depend-  
ence may be placed on the force of natural cir-  
cumstances to counteract the effects of an arti-  
ficial policy; there appear strong reasons to  
regard the foreign demand of that surplus, as  
too ugcertain reliance, and to desire a substi-  
tute Yor it in an extensive domestic market.  
  
“ To secure such a market, there is no other  
expedient, than to promote manufacturing es-  
tablishments. Manufacturers, who constitute  
the most numerous class, after the cultivators  
of land, are for that reason the principal consu-  
mers of the surplus of their labour.  
  
“ This idea of an extensive domestic mar-  
ket for the surplus produce of the soil, is of the  
first consequence. It is, of all things, that  
which effectually conduces to a flourishing state  
of agriculiure. Jf the effect of manufactur ies  
should be to detach a portion of the hands,  
which would otherwise be engaged in tillage,  
it might possibly cause a smaller quantity of  
lands to be under cultivation ; but by their ten-  
dency to procure a more certain demand for |  
the surplus produce of the soil, they would, at  
the same time, cause the lands, which require  
cultivation, to be better improved &amp; mote pro-  
ductive. And while, by their influence, the  
condition of each individual farmer would be  
meliorated, the total mass of agricultural pro-*  
duction would probably be increased. For &#x27;  
this must evidently depend as much, if not’  
more upon the degree of improvement, than |  
upon the number of acres under culture. {  
  
It merits particular observation, that the |  
multiplication of mamufactories not only fur-  
nishes a market for those articles which have  
been accustomed to be produced in abundance,  
ina country ; but it likewise creates a de-  
mand for such as wore either unknown or pro- |  
duced in inconsiderable quantities. The bow- |  
els, as well as the surface of the earth, are ran-  
sacked for articles which were before neglect-  
ed. Animals, plants, and minerals acquire a  
utility and value, which were before unexplo-  
red,

XXXVIT. “It is not anunreasonable supposition that measures, which  
“serve to abridge the free competition of foreign articles, have a tendenc  
“to occasion an enhancement of prices, and it is not to be denied that aa  
‘is the effect in a number of cases; but the fact does not uniformly corres-  
“pond with the theory. A reduction of prices has, in several instances, im-  
*‘ mediately succeeded the establishment of a domestic manufacture.’”  
  
XXXVIII. Though it were true, that the immediate and certain effect  
“ of regulations controlling the competition of foreign with domestic fabrics  
‘‘ was an increase of price, it is universally true, that the contrary is the  
‘“‘ ultimate effect with every successful manufacture. When a domestic ma-  
“ nufacture has attained to perfection, and has engaged in the prosecution  
“ a it a competent number of persons, it invariably becomes cheaper. Being  
‘free from the heavy charges which attend the importation of foreign com-  
‘“‘ modities, it can be afforded, and accordingly seldom or never fails to be  
“sold cheaper, in process of time, than was the foreign article for which it  
“is a substitute. The internal competition, which takes place, soon does  
“away every thing like monopoly, and by degrees reduces the price of the  
“article to the minimum of a reasonable profit on the capital employed.  
** This accords with the reason of the thing, and with experience.””® :  
  
XXXIX. Whence it follows, that it it the interest of a community, with  
‘a view to eventual and permanent economy, to encourage the growth of  
‘* manufactures. In a national view, a temporary enhancement of price must  
*‘ always be well compensated by a permanent reduction of it.”*7

It is assumed that protecting duties on the importa-  
tion of foreign manufactures, greatly. enhance the prices,  
and oi course, impose an oppressive tax on the consu..  
mer. Nothing can be more foreign from thefact. Alex.  
ander Hamilton exposed the fallacy of this notion above  
thirty years ago ;— |  
  
“When a domestic manufacture has attained to perfec.  
tion, and has engaged in the prosecution of it, a compe-  
tent number of persons, it invariably becomes cheaper.  
Being free from the heavy charges which attend the im-  
portation of foreign commodities, it can be afforded, and  
accordingly seldom or never fails to be sold cheaper, in  
process of time, than was the foreign article, for which it  
is a substitute. Zhe internal competition which takes  
place, soon does away every thing like monopoly and by  
degrees reduces the price of ihe article to the minimum of  
a reasonable profit on the capital employed.”

Now if the committee only mean by this, that if the  
price of an article in the consumption of an individual

that or some other object of his expendanures, must be

They say with Alexander Hamilton, that when a do.

engaged in the prosecution of it a competent number of  
persons, it invariably becomes cheaper; and that this op’-

resulting from the introduction of the cotton manufacture,  
That whenever an agricultural nation restricts itself to the  
exportation of its raw materials, and depends on a foreign  
nation for the supply of manutactures, the manufacturing  
nation will invariably drain it of its wealth; and that al}  
history proves, that in every country in which manufac-

value of land and its productions. That as the state of

will show that it is intended to refer to the production of iron.  
We have carefully examined Hamilton’s Report, and we assert  
that nothing of the kind is to be found there, relating to the  
production of iron. We will, however, present to our readers  
something which is to be found there, at the close of his exa-  
mination of the article of iron and manufactures thereof. Mr.  
Hamilion says:  
  
* A question arises, how far it might be expedient to permit  
the importation of iron, in pigs and bars, free from duty. It  
would certainly be favorable to manufacturers of the article—  
but the doubt is whether it might not interfere with its produe-  
uon.  
  
** Two circumstances, however, abate, if they do not remove,  
apprebension on this score. One is, the considerable increase  
of price which has been already remarked, and which renders  
it probable that the free admission of foreign iron would not be  
inconsistent with an adequate profit to the proprietors of iron  
works. The other is, the augmentation of demand which  
would be likely to attend the increase of manufactures of the  
article, in consequence of the additional encouragement pro-  
pesed to be given to manufacturers of iron wares. But cau-  
tien, nevertheless, in a matter of this kind, is most advisable.  
The measure suggested ought, perhaps, rather to be contem-  
plated, subject to the lights of further experieuce, than imme-  
diately adopted.”  
  
This is the opinion of Hamilton. The duty on bar iron was  
then &gt; per centum, and we leave it to our opponents to recon-  
cile this with their assertion that he advocated its prohibition  
by duties, as now imposed, of from 40 to 159 per centum, ou  
the raw material of the very manufactures he wished to en-  
courage. Aod eveu for these manufactures he asked but a  
duty of less than 1 cent per pwund on steel, 2 cents per pound  
on nails and spikes, 74 per cent. on manufactures of steel, and  
  
U per ceut. on those of iron.

by the difficulties and the cost of transportation. .  
Dr. Adam Smith, the author of the Wealth of  
Nationx, observes, that good roads, canals, and  
navigable rivers, by diminishing the expense of  
carnage, put the remote parts of a country more  
nearly upon a level with those in the neighborhood  
of large towns, and on that account they are tho  
greatest of all improvements. They encourage  
the cultivation of the remote parts, which must al­  
ways be the most extensive circle of the country ;  
they are advantageous to towns, by breaking down  
the monopoly of the country in the neighborhood ;  
aud thoy are advantageous to all parts of the coun­  
try ; for though they introduce some rival com­  
modities into the markets, they open many new&#x27;  
markets to its produce.  
That in all societies there should be found many &#x27;  
who blindly adhere to the existing stale of things,­  
from an undefined apprehension of danger from all  
changes, is lo he expected from the nature of men :  
thus we are tulJ hy the same author, in 1776, that  
fifty years before that time, some of the counties in  
the neighborhood of London petitioned tho Parlia­  
ment against the extension uf Ihe turnpike ruad4  
into the remoter counties, &quot;the rammer counties,  
they pretended, from the cheapness of labor, would  
be able to sell Ibeir grass and com cheaper in tho  
London markets, than themselves, and would there­  
by reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation.  
Their rents, however, have risen, and the cultiva­  
tion haa been improved sines that time.

nation. In the course of that report he remarked: “ But there are more  
particular considerations which serve to fortify the idea that the encour-  
agement of manufactures is the interest of all parts of the Union. If the  
northern and middle states should be the principal scenes of such estab-  
lishments, they would immediately benefit the more southern by creating  
a demand for productions, some of which they have in common with the  
other states, and others of which are either peculiar to them, or more  
abundant, or of better quality than elsewhere. These productions princi-  
pally are: timber, flax, hemp, cotton, wool, raw silk,’ indigo, iron, lead,  
furs, hides, skins, and coals. Of these articles, cotton and indigo are  
uliar to the southern states, as are hitherto lead and coals. Flax and  
emp are or may be raised in greater abundance there than in the more  
northern states, and the wool of Virginia is said to be of better quality than  
that of any other state; a circumstance rendered the more probable by the  
reflection, that Virginia embraces the same latitudes with the finest wool  
countries of Europe. The climate of the south is also better adapted to  
the production of silk.”&quot;* The influence of this report was felt throughout  
the country, proceeding as it did from so able a mind, and embodying a  
mass of statistical matter connected with the production of the country,  
which was peculiarly valuable at that period, and more satisfactory to the  
people, inasmuch as it recommended some uniform and systematic course  
of policy upon the subject. Meanwhile, Mr. Samuel Slater, a manufac-

be advanced, rather than injured, by the due en  
couragement of manufactures, may, it is believed, be  
satisfactorily demonstrated. And is it also believed

general view, may be shown to be recommended by  
the most cogent and persuasive motives of national  
policy.  
&quot;It is evident that the exertions of the husband­  
man will be steady or fluctuating, in proportion to  
the steadiness or fluctuation of the market, on which  
he depends for the vent of the surplus which may  
be produced by his labour; and that such surplus,  
in the ordinary course of things, will be greater or  
less in the same proportion. For the purpose of  
this vent, a domestic market is greatly to be pre­  
ferred to a foreign one: because it is, in the nature  
of things, far more to be relied upon. To promote  
this market in the United States,

of the Treasury (Mir Hamilton) made his celebrat­

I should be glad, sir, if this invaluable document

The grounds upon which he rested the policy are  
very briefly summed up in the following paragraph,

&quot;The emberrassments which have obstructed the pro

on the necessity of enlarging the sphere of our domestic  
commerce. The restrictive regulalions which, in foreign  
markets, abridge the vent for the incressing surplus of our  
agricultural produce, serve to beget an earnest desire that  
a more exten- ve demand for that surplus may be created  
at home; and the complete suceess which has rewarded  
manufacturing enterprise in ome valuable branches, con­  
spiring with the promising symptoms which attend come

cles to the growth of this specics of industry are less for­  
midable than they were apprehended to be and that it may

&quot;Though it were true that the imediate and certain  
effects of regulations controlling the competition of for-  
eign with domestic fabrics was increased of prices, it is  
universally true that the contrary is the ultimate effect  
with every successful manufacture. When a domestic  
manufacture has attained to perfection, and has engaged  
in the prosecution of it a competent number of persons, it  
invariably becomes cheaper. Being free from the heavy  
charges which attend the importation of foreign commo­  
dities, it can be afforded, and, accordingly, seldom or  
never falls to be sold cheaper, in process of time, than  
was the foreignarticle for which it is a substitute. The  
iuternal competition which takes place, soon does away  
every thing like monopoly, and, by degress, reduces the  
price of the article to the minimuin of a reasonable profit  
on the capital employed. This accords with the reason of  
the thing, and with experience. Whence it follows, that  
it is the interest of a community, with a view to eventual  
and permanent cconomy, to encourage the growth of ma-  
nufactures. In a nationol viets, a temporary enhance  
ment of price miast always be well compensated by o per­  
manent reduction of it.&quot;

‘“ But there are more particular considerations which serve to  
fortify the idea that the encouragement of manufactures is the  
interest of all parts of the Union. If the northern and middle  
states should be the principal seats of such manufacture, they  
would immediately benefit the more southern by creating a  
demand for productions, some of which they have in common  
with other states, and others of which are either peculiar to  
them, or more abundant, or of better quality than elsewhere.  
These productions are principally timber, flax, hemp, cotton,  
wool, raw silk, indigo, iron, lead, furs, hides, skins and coal. Of  
these articles cotton and indigo are peculiar to the southern  
states, as are lead and coal. Flax and hemp are, or may be,  
raised in greater abundance there than in the more northern  
states ; and the wool of Virginia may be of better quality than  
that of any other state—a circumstance rendered the more  
  
robable by the reflection that Virginia embraces the same  
atitudes as the finest wool countries of Europe.’’  
  
The idea of Hamilton was, that the American continent—a  
world in itself, with every diversity of soil and climate—could  
produce everything from its own native resources, and become  
independent of the rest of the globe. To realise that idea he  
deemed it wise to lay the foundations of future greatness wid

“When a domestic manufacture has at­

Paper.—Manufactories of paper are among those which  
are arrived at the greatest maturity in the United States,  
That of paper  
  
hangings is a branch, in which respectable progress has  
| been made.  
  
Nothing material seems wanting to the further  
success of this valuable branch, which is already protected  
by a competent duty on similar imported articles. In the  
enumeration of the several kinds, made subject to that duty,  
sheathing and cartridge paper have been omitted. These,  
being the most simple manufactures of the sort, and neces-  
  
| sary to military supply, as well as ship building, recom-  
  
mend themselves equally with those of other descriptions,  
to encouragement, and appear te be as fully within the  
compass of domestic exertions.  
  
Printed Books.—The great number of presses dissemi-  
nated throughout the Union seem to afford an assurance  
that there is no need of being indebted to foreign countries  
for the printing of the books which are used in the United  
A duty of ten per cent., instead of five, which is  
now charged upon the article, would have a tendency to aid  
the business internally. It occurs, as an objection to this,  
that it may have an unfavorable aspect towards literature,  
  
| by raising the prices of books in universal use, in private  
  
familjes, schools, and other seminaries of learning. But  
the difference, it is conceived, would be without effect. As  
  
| to books which usually fill the libraries of the wealthier  
  
classes and of professional men, such an augmentation of  
prices as might be occasioned by an additional duty of five  
per cent., would be too little felt to be an impediment to  
the acquisition. And with regard to books which may be  
specially imported for the use of particular seminaries of  
learning, and of public libraries, a total exemption from  
duty would be advisable, which would go towards obviating  
the objection just mentioned. They are now subject to a  
duty of five per cent. As to the books in most general  
family use, the constancy and universality of the demand  
would insure exertions to furnish them at home, and the  
means are completely adequate. It may also be expected  
ultimately, in this as in other cases, that the extension of  
the domestic manufacture would conduce to the cheapness  
of the article. It ought not to pass unremarked, that to  
encourage the printing of books is to encourage the manu-  
facture of paper

Hamilton further observed that, when duties on the materials

recommended, as a general rule, the exemption of those materials

familiar to countries which systematically pursued the business of

The greatest statesman America ever pro­  
duced, Alexander Hamilton, summed up the  
philosophy of a protective tariff in these  
words:  
“But, though it were true that the immedi­  
ate and certain effect of a tariff was an increase  
of price, it is universally true that the contrary  
is the ultimate effect with every successful  
manufacture. When adomesticmanufacture  
has attained to perfection and has engaged in  
the prosecution of it a competent number of  
persons, it can be afforded and accordingly  
seldom or never fails to be cheaper, in process  
of time, than the foreign article for which it is  
a substitute. The internal competition which  
takes place soon does away with anything  
like monopoly, and by degrees reduces the  
minimum to a reasonable profit on the capital  
employed. This accords with the reason of  
the thing and with experience.”

The National Legislature has express  
authority to lay and collect taxes, duties,  
imposts and excises, to pay the debts and  
provide for the common defense and gen­  
eral welfare, with no other qualifications  
than that all duties, imposts and excises  
shall be uniform throughout the United  
States; that no capitation or other direct  
tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to  
numbers; and that no tax or duty shall be  
laid on articles exported from any State.  
These three qualifications excepted, the  
power to raise money is plenary and in-  
jefinite; and the objects to which it may  
be appropriated are no less comprehensive  
than the payment of the public debts and  
he providing for the common defense and  
he general welfare. The terms &#x27;general  
velfare&#x27; were doubtless intended to sig  
nify more than was expressed or imported  
in those which preceded; otherwise nu­  
merous exigencies, incident to the affairs  
of the nation, would have been leit with­  
out provision. The phrase is as compre  
hensive as any that could have been used;  
because it was not fit that the constitu­  
tional authority of the Union to appropri-  
ate its resources should have been restricted  
within narrower limits than  
ae eneral welare  
and because this necessarily embraces a  
vast variety of particulars, which are sus­  
ceptible neither of specification nor of  
delnition. It is, therefore, of necessity  
left to the discretion of the National Leg­  
islature to pronounce upon the objects  
which concern the general welfare, and  
for which, under that description, an ap­  
propriation of money is requisite and  
proper, and there seems no room for a  
doubt that whatever concerns the general  
interests of learning, of agriculture, of  
manufactures and of commerce are within  
the sphere of the national councils, so far  
as regards the application of money. The  
only qualification of the generality of the  
phrase in question, which seems to be ad­  
missible, is this: That the object to which  
an appropriation of money is to be made  
must be general and not lecal; its opera­  
tion extending in fact, or by possibility,  
throughout the Union, and not being con­  
fined to a particular spot. No objection  
ought to arise to this construction from a  
supposition that it would imply a power  
to do whatever else should appear to Con­  
gress conducive to the general welfare. A  
power to appropriate money with this lati  
tude, which is granted in express terms,  
would not carry a power to do any other  
thing not authorized in the Constitution  
either expressly or by fair implication.

tained it, from the words and intent of the Constitution, with a power of  
argument never surpassed and never answered. I ask your indulgence in  
giving a single extract Irom that report. He says: &quot;The national  
legislature has express authority to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts  
and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and  
general welfare,&#x27; with no other qualifications than that all duties, imposts

that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported Irom any State.  
These three qualifications excepted, the power to raise money is plenary  
and indefinite, and the objects to which it may be appropriated are no less  
cnmprehensiv.tihan the payment of the public debts and the providing  
for the common defense and the general welfare. The terms &#x27; general  
welfare &#x27; were doubtless intended to signify more than was expressed or

The phrase is as comprehensive as any that could have been used, because  
it was not fit that the constitutional authority of .the Union to appropriate

Traces of the impress of the art are  
found here and there all through the  
early history of the United States.  
In obedience to a resolution of the first  
congress of January 15, 1790, Mr. Alex-  
ander Hamilton, secretary of the treas-  
ury, laid before the house of representa-  
tives an able and voluminous report on  
the subject of manufactures in the new  
and struggling nation. In that docu-  
ment he touches on glass, as follows:  
  
The materials of glass are everywhere found. In  
the United States there is no deficiency. The sands  
and stones called ¢arso, which include flinty and  
  
  
  
PITTSBURGH.  
  
crystalline substances generally, and the salts of  
various plants, particularly of the sea-weed kali or  
kelp, were the essential ingredients, Fuel was  
abundant for such manufactures, They, however,  
required large capitals and much manual labor.  
Different manufactures of glass were on foot in the  
United States, and received considerable encourage-  
ment in’ the duty of two and a half per cent. If  
more was given, a bounty on window-glass and black  
bottles would be the most proper. Bottles were an  
important item in breweries, and a deficiency was  
complained of.

&quot;Though it were that the immediate and  
certain effects of regulations Controlling  
the competition of foreign -with domestic  
fabrics was increase of prices, it is univer  
sally true that the countrary is the ultimate  
effect with every successful manufacture.  
When a domestic manufacture has attained  
to perfection, and has engaged in the pros  
ecution of it a competent number of per­  
sons, it invariably becomes cheaper. Being  
free from the heavy charges which attend  
the importation of foreign commodities, it  
can be afforded, and, accordingly, seldom  
or never fails to be old cheaper in process  
of time than was the foreign article for  
which it is a substitute. The internal  
competition which takes place, soon does  
away with everything like imonopoly, and  
by degrees, reduces the price of the article  
to the mi.. imnm of a reasonable profit on  
the capital employed. This accords with  
the reason of the thing, and with experi-  
ence. wnence it xoiiows, that it is the  
interest of a community, with a view to  
eventual and permanent economy, to ei

a national view, a temporary enhancement of  
price must always be well compensated by a  
permanent reauciion oj it

Hamilton observed in his report on

scarcely anything which has assisted the  
manufacturers of Great Britain better  
than the melioration of the public roads  
of that kingdom and the great progress  
which has been of late made in canals.  
Of the former the United States stands  
much in need. There can certainly be  
no object more worthy of the cares of  
the local administrations, and it were to  
be wished that there was no doubt of  
the power of the national government to  
lend its direct aid on a comprehensive

money that has come into the pockets of  
American farmers in this section of the  
United States, more than would have come  
if the Mckinley tariff had not been enact-  
ed, makes a pretty substantial argument in  
favor of the party and the policy which is  
protecting their industry.  
Alexander Hamilton was a great states  
man. He is called the father of American  
protection. In a famous report to Con  
gress he demonstrated to his own satisfac  
tion and that of thousands of wise and can­  
did statesmen of his own day and of the gen­  
erations which have followed him, &quot;that the  
exertions of the husbandman will be  
steady or fluctuating, vigorous or feeble, in  
proportion to the steadiness or fluctuation,  
adequateness or inadequateness of the mar  
kets on which he must rely for the vent of  
the surplus which may be produced by his  
labor,&quot; and, &quot;that for the purpose of this  
vent a domestic market is greatly to  
preferred to a foreign one because it is in  
the nature of things far more to be relied  
upon;&quot; that it is the policy of nations to be  
upply themselves with subsistence from  
their own soil. That in foreign markets  
the interruptions of the demand for agri­  
cultural supplies are liable to occur to a  
very in jurious extent. That from natural  
causes the external demand for &quot;the sur  
plus of agricultural nations&quot; is &quot;a precar­  
ious reliance.&quot; That &quot;to secure such a  
market there is no other expedient than to  
promote manufacturing establishments.

He begins, ‘To this it has been  
answered ” :—]  
  
1. That inasmuch as it is ac-  
knowledged that manufacturing  
labor reproduces a value equal to  
that which is expended or con-  
sumed in carrying it on, and con-  
tinues in existence the original  
stock or capital employed, it  
ought, on that account alone, to  
escape being considered as wholly  
unproductive. That, though it  
should be admitted, as alleged,  
that the consumption of the prod-  
uce of the soil by the classes of  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
value of the daily, monthly, and  
yearly consumption of this class  
was exactly equal to that of its  
daily, monthly, and yearly produc-  
tion, yet it would not from thence  
follow that its labor added nothing  
to the real revenue, to the real  
value of the annual produce of the  
land and labor of the society.

of which Hamilton states in a gen-

artificers or manufacturers is ex-  
actly equal to the value added by  
their labor to the materials upon  
which it is exerted, yet it would  
not thence follow that it added  
nothing to the revenue of the soci-  
ety or to the aggregate value of the  
annual produce of its land and  
labor. If the consumption, for  
any given period, amounted to a  
given sum, and the increased value  
of the produce manufactured in  
the same period to a like sum, the  
total amount of the consumption  
and production during that period  
would be equal to the two sums,  
and, consequently, double: the  
value of the agricultural produce  
consumed, And though the incre-  
ment of value produced by the  
classes of artificers should at no  
time exceed the value of the prod-  
uce of the land consumed by  
them, yet there would be at every  
moment, in consequence of their  
labor, a greater value of goods in  
the market than would exist inde-  
pendent of it.  
  
2. That the position that artifi-  
cers can augment the revenue of  
a society only by parsimony is true  
in no other sense than in one  
which is equally applicable to hus-  
bandmen or cultivators.  
  
8. That the annual produce of  
the land and labor of a country  
can only be increased in two ways,  
—by some improvement in the  
productive powers of the useful  
labor which actually exists within  
it or by some increase in the  
quantity of such labor. That with  
regard to the first, the labor of  
artificers being capable of greater  
subdivision and simplicity of ope-  
ration than that of cultivators, it  
is susceptible, in a proportionately  
  
  
  
  
  
836  
  
  
  
of being more subdivided, and the  
labor of each workman reduced to  
« greater simplicity of operation  
than that of farmers and country  
laborers, so it is likewise capable  
of both these sorts of improve-  
ment in a much higher degree.  
In this respect, therefore, the class  
of cultivators can have no advan-  
tage over that of artificers and  
manufacturers.

One of the arguments made  
use of in support of the idea may  
be pronounced both quaint and  
superficial. It amounts to this:  
that in the productions of the soil  
nature co-operates with man, and  
that the effect of their joint labor  
must be greater than that of the  
labor of man alone. (p. 7.)

Another, and that which seems  
to be the principal argument of-  
fered for the superior productive-  
ness of agricultural labor, turns  
upon the allegation that labor em-  
ployed on manufactures yields  
nothing equivalent to the rent of  
land, or to that neat surplus, as it  
is called, which accrues to the pro-  
prietor of the soil. (p. 8.)

Upon equal or nearly equal  
profits, most men will choose to  
employ their capitals rather in the  
improvement and cultivation of  
land than either manufactures or  
in foreign trade. The man who  
employs his capital in land has it  
more under view and command,  
and his fortune is less liable to  
accidents, than that of the trader.

1. As to the division of labor.  
  
It has justly been observed that  
there is scarcely anything of  
greater moment in the economy  
of a nation than the proper divi-  
sion of labor. The separation of  
occupations causes each to be car-  
ried to a much greater perfection  
than it could possibly acquire if  
they were blended. This arises  
principally from three circum-  
stances.  
  
ist. The greater skill and dex-  
terity naturally resulting from a  
constant and undivided applica-  
tion to a single object. It is evi-  
dent that these properties must  
increase in proportion to the sep-  
aration and simplification of ob-  
jects, and the steadiness of the  
attention devoted to each, and  
must be less in proportion to the  
complication of objects and the  
number among which the atten-  
tion is distracted.  
  
2d. The economy of time, by  
avoiding the loss of it, incident  
to a frequent transition from one  
operation to another of a different  
nature. This depends on various  
circumstances,—the transition it-  
self, the orderly disposition of the  
implements, machines, and ma-  
terials employed in the operation  
to be relinquished, the preparatory  
steps to the commencement of a  
new one, the interruption of the  
impulse which the mind of the  
workman acquires from being en-  
gaged in a particular operation,  
the distractions, hesitations, and  
reluctances which attend the pas-  
sages from one kind of business to  
another,

“ There are natural causes tending to render the external demand  
Sor the surplus of agricultural nations a precarious reliance. The differ-  
ence of seasons, in the countries which are the consumers, make immense  
differences in the produce of their own soils, in different years ; and con-  
sequently in the degrees of their necessity for foreign supply. Plentiful  
harvests with them, especially tf similar ones occur at the same time in the  
countries which are the furnishers, occasion of course a glut in the markets  
of the latter... . There appear strong reasons to regard the foreign de-  
mand for that surplns as too uncertain a reliance, and to desire a substi-  
tute for it, in an extensive domestic market.  
  
“To secure such a market, there is no other expedient, than to pro-  
mote manufacturing establishments. Manufacturers, who constitute the  
most numerous class, after the cultivators of land, are for that reason the  
principal consumers of the surplus of their labor.  
  
“ This idea of an extensive domestic market for the surplus produce  
of the soil ts of the first consequence. It ts of all things, that which most  
effectually conduces to a flourishing state of agriculture... . It merits  
particular observation, that the multiplication of manufactortes not only  
Surnishes a market for those articleswhich have been accustomed

REMARKABLE GROWTH.  
Tho growth of the nail-making industry*

and within the past few years the growth  
in the exports of this production has been  
equally noteworthy. Alexander Hamilton, in
