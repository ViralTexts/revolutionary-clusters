Mr. Murray—May it please your honours, and you, gentlemen of the  
  
jury.  
  
That the prisoner is a Romish emissary, sent according to the intima-  
tion in general Oglethorpe’s letter, [ think must be concluded from what  
has been given in evidence against him ; and from the known principles of  
the Romish religion, it may be judged what inducement the prisoner had to  
undertake so wicked and diabolical a project. The letter of general Ogle-  
thorpe has been offered hy way of inducement, and in aid of other evidence  
in general, to shew that there was a plot, and therein I apprehend we are  
justified by the precedents and authories in law before cited.
