At eleven this forenoon, Mr. Williams gave us, the second, philosophical lecture: it was upon the incidental properties of matter, and excepting very few deviations, was expressed in the same terms with that we had last year upon the same subject: indeed, whether the professor’s time is taken up by other studies, or whether he is too indolent to make any improvements in his lectures, it is said he gives every year the same course, without adding or erasing a line.

 a proposition, which perhaps no one would deny. Enough therefore has been said, to this Point.  
This fondness for harmony is then one of the characteristics which distinguish man from the brute creation: and it is one of the richest sources of enjoyment, that an indulgent providence has granted him. Harmony, under various forms can rouse, soften or restrain all the passions in the human breast. There is scarce a sensation in the heart, but there may be found a musical note in unison with it. I appeal to the experience of every person, whether all their passions have not been influenced by the power of harmony?   
  
“If in the breast tumultuous joys arise,  
Music her soft assuasive voice applies.  
  
And when the soul is prest with cares  
Awakes it with enlivening airs.  
Warriors she fires, with animating sounds,  
Pours balm into the bleeding lovers wounds.”  
  
It is remarkable that this charm is rather falsified, and co

Thomas Gray, “The Progress of Poesy,” lines 13–16 (Poetical Works of Mr. Gray, new edn., London, 1785, p. 25, at MQA). This poem was copied by JQA as early as Sept. 1782, while he was living in St. Petersburg (M/JQA/26, Adams Papers, Microfilms, Reel No. 221).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
“Ode for Music on St. Cecilia’s Day,” lines 24–29. JQA copied Pope’s poem into another of his commonplace books in Aug. 1782 (M/JQA/24, Adams Papers, Microfilms, Reel No. 219). The poet’s lines 26–27 read: “Or, when the soul is press’d with cares,/Exalts her in enlivening airs.”

JQA is apparently referring to Octavianus, or Augustus (63 B.C.–A.D. 14), who did not oppose Antony’s nomination of Cicero as victim of proscriptions under the new triumvirate of 43 B.C., composed of Antony, Lepidus, and Augustus. Cicero was murdered by soldiers shortly thereafter (Harper’s Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities, ed. Harry Thurston Peck, N.Y., 1898).

I went down this morning to the president to know the determination of the Corporation with respect to a private Commencement; and was told that the petition of the Class was rejected: because they supposed that if public Commencements were lain aside, there would be no stimulus to study among the scholars: and they are afraid, that by granting our petition, they might establish a precedent which the following Classes, would take advantage of, and claim as a right, what we only request as a favour. Another reason which Mr. Willard said, had weight, although the gentlemen did not choose to avow it publicly, was their fear of offending the future governor by depriving him of that opportunity to show himself in splendor and magnificence.

philosophical lecture. It was upon the incidental properties of matter,  
and, excepting very few deviations, was expressed in the same terms  
with that we had last year upon the same subject. Indeed, whether  
the professor’s time is taken up by other studies, or whether he is too  
indolent to make any improvements in his lectures, it is said he gives  
every year the same course, without adding or erasing a line.

“ April 11, 1787. I went down this morning to the President to  
know the determination of the corporation with respect to a private  
Commencement, and was told that the petition of the class was rejected,  
because they supposed that if public Commencements were lain aside,  
there would be no stimulus to study among the scholars, and they are afraid  
that by granting our petition they might establish a precedent which  
the following classes would take advantage of, and claim as a right what  
we only request as a favor. Another reason which Mr. Willard said  
had weight, although the gentlemen did not choose to avow it publicly,  
was the fear of offending the future Governor by depriving him of that  
opportunity to show himself in splendor and magnificence.”
