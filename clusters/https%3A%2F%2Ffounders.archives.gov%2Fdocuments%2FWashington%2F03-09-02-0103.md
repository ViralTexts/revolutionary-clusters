Sir  
Morristown April 9th 1777.  
  
I take the liberty of transmitting you a Copy of a paper addressed to me by Lieut. Colo. Walcot of your Army, which came inclosed in a Letter from Lieut. Genl Lord Cornwallis. It is with peculiar regret, I am constrained to observe, that this illiberal performance of Colo. Walcot, is obviously calculated, to answer a less generous purpose than that of merely effecting an exchange—contains a gross misrepresentation of facts, and is a palpable deviation from that delicate line, which I expected would mark his conduct, as a man of candor &amp; ingenuity.  
That Gentleman has censured two Articles insisted on by me through Lieut. Colo. Harrison at their meeting on the 10th Ulto “as groundless, unprecedented and inconsistent with any degree of reason or common sense,” tho founded, as I conceive, in the clearest principles of Equity and justice. Nor contenting himself with this, which would have given me no concern; he has assumed the privilege of mutilating and mistating those Articles in such a manner, as to change their meaning, and to adapt them to the unfair conclusions he wished to establish.  
Having premised these things, and being charged in direct and positive terms by Colo. Walcot, who acted under your authority, with a violation of the Agreement made between us for the Exchange of prisoners, and called upon for a performance of the same, I think it necessary, to explain the motives of my conduct, and the grounds on which those Articles or Objections stand.  
In respect to the first, I freely repeat, that I do not hold myself bound, either by the spirit of Agreement, or by the principles of justice, to account for those Prisoners, who from the rigor &amp; severity of their treatment, were in so emaciated and languishing a State at the time they came out as to render their death almost certain and inevitable; and which in many instances happened while they were returning to their Homes and in many Others immediately after their arrival. You must be sensible, that our Engagement, as well as all others of the kind, tho in Letter, it expresses only an equality of rank and number, as the Rule of Exchange, yet it necessarily implies a regard to the general principles of mutual compensation and advantage. This is inherent in its nature—is the voice of reason, and no stipulation, as to the condition in which prisoners should be returned, was requisite. Humanity dictated that their treatment should be such, as their health and comfort demanded, and where her laws have been duly respected, their condition has been generally good. Nor is this the language of Humanity alone—justice declares the same. The Object of every Cartel  
  
or similar agreement, is the benefit of the prisoners themselves and that of the contending powers—on this footing it equally exacts that they should be well treated, as that they should be exchanged: The reverse is therefore, an evident infraction, and ought to subject the party, on whom it is chargeable, to all the damage and ill consequences resulting from it. Nor can it be expected, that those unfitted for future service by acts of severity in direct violation of a Compact are proper subjects for an Exchange. In such case, to return Others not in the same predicament, would be to give without receiving an Equivalent; and would afford the greatest encouragement to cruelty and inhumanity. The argument drawn from the mere circumstance of the prisoners having been received, is of no validity. Though from their wretched situation they could not at that time be deemed proper for an Exchange, Our Humanity required, that they should be permitted to return among us. It may perhaps be fairly doubted, whether an apprehension of their death or that of a great part of them, did not contribute somewhat to their being sent out when they were. Such an event whilst they remained with you, would have been truly interesting, because it would have destroyed every shadow of claim for a return of the prisoners in our Hands; and therefore, policy concurring with Humanity dictated, that the measure should be adopted. Happy had it been, if the Expedient had been thought of, before these ill fated men were reduced to such extremity. It is confessed however on all sides, that after their delivery they still continued your prisoners &amp; would be so, till regularly exchanged. I acknowledge that I should be, and I have been always willing, notwithstanding this concession, to account for every man who was in a proper condition and fit to be exchanged at the time they came out so far as the proportion of prisoners with us would extend. With what propriety or upon what foundation of justice can more be demanded? This has been proposed, or what is the same, was most clearly implied in the first Article or Objection made by Lieut. Colo. Harrison, and illiberally rejected since, as inconsistent with any degree of reason or common sense. Painful as it is, I am compelled to consider it, as a fact not to be questioned, that the usage of our prisoners whilst in your possession, the privates at least, was such, as could not be justified. This was proclaimed by the concurrent testimony of all who came out—their appearance sanctified the assertion—and melancholy experience in the speedy death of a large part of them, stamped it with infallible certainty.  
In respect to the Second Article insisted on, Your discriminating Major Genl Lee from other Captive Officers belonging to the American Army, demanded my particular attention. I was authorized to conclude from your laying him under peculiar restraints, and from your  
  
Letter of the 23d of January last, that you considered him in a singular point of view, and meant to exclude him from the common right of exchange, stipulated for all Officers in general terms. This distinction the more injurious and unwarrantable, as you never excepted him, though you knew him to be an Officer in our Army, at the time and long before the Agreement was entered into, made it my duty, to assert his right in an explicit manner, and to endeavour to put the matter upon so unequivocal a footing as to insure his enlargement, when ever an Officer of equal rank belonging to your Army should be in our power. This was attempted by the Article and nothing more—nor is any other inference to be drawn from it. It is true a proposition was made since his captivity, to give a certain number of Officers of inferior rank in exchange for him, but it was not claimed, as a matter of right. What name then, does that proceeding merit, by which it is suggested, that the immediate release of Genl Lee had been demanded, without having an Officer of equal rank to give for him? The suggestion cannot be supported by the most tortured exposition nor will it have credit, where candor is deemed a virtue, and words preserve their form &amp; meaning.  
As to the charge of delay in not returning the prisoners in our hands, the dispersed situation of those taken at a more early period of the War, through the different States, arising from the circumstances of their captivity and a regard to their better accomodation, made their detention for a considerable time unavoidable. When the Agreement subsisting between us took place, the speediest directions were given to have them collected, that an Exchange might be effected. This was done in part, and at a juncture when motives of policy opposed the measure, but were made to yield to the rigid maxims of good faith. We were pursuing the exchange and continued our exertions to accomplish it; till the miserable appearance, indicating an approaching catastrophe, of those sent out by you, made it improper. foreseeing that a difficulty might arise, and that It might be expected, I should account for the whole of them, which I by no means thought equitable, it became necessary that the matter should be adjusted and the due proportion settled for which I ought to be responsible, before any thing further could be done on my part. upon this ground stands also the detention of those, who have been since captured.  
Added to these considerations, the discrimination set up in the instance of Genl Lee is to be regarded, as utterly irreconcileable to the tenor of our Agreement, and an insurmountable obstacle to a compliance with your demands.  
Thus Sir, have I explained the motives of my conduct, and, I trust, vindicated myself in the eye of Impartiality, from the improper and  
  
groundless charge which you &amp; the Gentleman acting by your authority have been pleased to alledge against me. If in doing this, I have departed in the smallest degree from that delicacy, which I always wished should form a part of my character, you will remember, I have been forced into recrimination &amp; that it has become an act of necessary justice.  
I shall now declare it to be my ardent wish, that a General exchange may take place on generous &amp; liberal principles as far as it can be effected and that the Agreement subsisting between us for that purpose should be inviolably observed; and I call upon you, by every Obligation of good faith, to remove all impediments on your part to the accomplishment of it. If however you do not, I console myself with a hope that those unfortunate Men, whose lot it is to be your prisoners, will bear their sufferings with becoming fortitude and magnanimity. I am Sir with due respect Yr Most Obedt Sert

would be to give without receiving an equi­

fol asit is, I am compelled to confider it as  
a salt not to be Gueltioned, that the usage  
of our prisoners whilst in yoor poffe(fon, the  
privates at least, was such as could not be  
juftified. This was proci#imed by the con­  
currerit testimony of all whocame out. their  
appearance fanciified the aficrtion,— and

This ditin&amp;ion, the mere injurious and un­  
warrantable as you never evcepted him,  
though you knew him to be an officer in  
our army at the time, and long before, the  
agreement was entered into, made it my  
duty to assert his right in an explicic manner,  
and to andeavour to put the matter on so  
unequavocal a footing as to ensure his en­  
largement whenever an&quot;officer of equal rank,  
belonging to your army, should be in our  
pewer. This was atcempted by the article,  
snd nothing more—nor is any other infe- .  
rence to be drawn from it.—=lt is true a pro­  
position was made since his captivity, to  
jve a cértain number of officers of ifferios

2imott certain end inevitable. and which, in  
many inflances, happened while they were re-  
urning to their homes, and in manv others  
after their arrival. You muft be fenfidle that  
our engagement, as well as all others of the  
kind, though in letter it exprefes only an  
equality of rank and number as the rule of  
excharge, yet it neceffarily implies a regard to  
the eeneral princtples of mutual compenfation  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
and advantage. ‘Phis is inherent in its nature,  
isthe voice of reafon, and no ftipulation, as to  
the condiuken in which prifoners fhould be  
relurced, was requilite. Humanity aictated,  
that ¢ trestment fhould be fuch as their  
health ard comfort demanded ; and where her  
Jaws have been du&#x27;y refpeéted, their condiiion  
has been generally good.——Nor is thie the lane  
  
guage of humanity alone—juRice declares ihe  
fame. The objeet of every cartel, or fimilar agree.  
ment, is the benefit of the prifoners themfe&#x27;ves  
and that of the contending pewerrm——on this  
fonting, it equatiy exaéts, that they thould be  
well treated, as that they thouid be exchanged:  
  
  
  
The reverfe is therefore an evident infra€tion,  
and ought to fubie&amp; the party, on whom it is  
chargeable, to abi the damace and il} confe-  
gue ices refulting from it. Nor can it be ex-  
pected, that thefe unfitted for future fervice by  
acts of feverity, in direét viokution of a com  
  
pact. are proper fubjets for an exchange. ia  
fuch a cafe, to return others not in the iame  
predicament, would be to give without receiving  
Bo equivalent, and would aftere the preateft en-  
couragement to cruelty and inhumanity. The  
arguuient drawn from the mere clrumfance of  
  
  
  
the prifoners having been received, is of no  
validity. Tho” front their wretched fituation  
  
they could not at that time be deemed proper  
for an exchange, our humanity required that!  
they fhould be permitted to return amongft us,  
It may perhaps be fairly doybted, whether an  
apprehenfion of their death, or that of a great  
part of them, did not contribute fomewhat to  
their being fent out when they were. Such an  
event, whilft they remained with you, would  
have been truly interefting, becaufe it would  
have defroyed every fhadéw of claim for the  
eturn of the pritoners in your hands; and there.  
fote policy, concurring with humanity, diGated  
that the meésfure fhould be adopted. Happy  
had it been, if the expedient had been thought  
of before thefe ill-fated men were reduced to  
fuch extremity. Itis confeffed however onal  
fides, that after their delivery they ftill con.  
tinued your prifoners, and would be fo, till re-  
gularly exchanged. I acknowledge, that I fhould  
be, and I have been, always willing, notwith-  
fianding this confefiion, to account for every  
man who was in a proper condition, and  
fit to be exchanged at the time they came out,  
fo far as the proportion of prifoners with us  
woul! extend. With what propriety, or upon  
what foundation of juftice, can more be de-  
manded? This has been propofed, or what is  
the fame, was moft clearly implied in the firk  
article, or objeétion, made by Lievt. Col,  
Harriton, and illiberably rejected fince, incon-  
fiftent with any degree of reafon or common  
fenfe, Painful as it is, I am compelled to con-  
fider it as a fa€t not to be queftioned, that the  
ulage of our prifoners whilft in your pofleffion,  
the privates at leaft; was fuch as could not be  
juttificd. ‘This was proclaimed by the concur-  
rent tefiimony of all who came out, their ap-  
pearance fanétified the affertion—and melan-  
choly experience, in the fpeedy death of a large  
pert of them, ftlamped it with infallible cer-  
tainty.  
  
In refoe&amp; to the fecond article infifted on  
your ditcriminating M ‘jor Gen. Lee from other  
captive officers belonging to the American  
army, demanded my particular attention, IJ  
was authorised to conclude from yeur laying

fideved him ina fingular point of view, and  
meant to exclude him from the common right  
of exchange, ftipulated for all officers in gene-  
ralterms. ‘This diftingtion, the more injuri-  
Gus znd unwarrantable as you never excepted  
him, though you knew him to be ancfiicer in  
our army at the time, and long before the  
agreement was entered into, made it my duty  
to aflert hisright in an explicit manner, and to  
endeavour to put the matter on fo unequivocal  
a tooting as to enfure his enlargement whens  
ever an officer of equal rank, belonging to your  
arey, fhiuld be in our power, This. was  
aitempted by the article, and nothing more—~

but ir was mot claimed as a matter of right.—  
What name then does that proceeding merit,  
by which it is fuggefted, that the immediate re-  
leafe of Gen. Lee had been demanded, without  
having 2a officer of equal rank ¢» give for him ?  
The fuggeftion cannot be fupported by the mot  
tortured expofition, nor will it have credit  
where candour is deemed a virtue, and words  
preferve their form and meaning. .  
  
As to the charge of delay in not returning  
the prifoners in our hands—the difperfed fitua-  
tion of thofe taken at a more early period of  
the wat, through the different States, arifing  
from the circumftances of their captivity, and  
a regard to their better accommodation, made  
their detention for a confiderable time unavoid-  
able, When the agreement fubfifting between  
us took place, the fpeedieft directions were  
given to have them colleQed, that an ex-  
change might be effected. This was done in  
part, and at a juncture when motives of policy  
oppofed the meafure, but were made ty yield to  
nid maxims of good faith. We were pur-  
fuing the exchange 5 and continued our exer-  
tions to accomplifh it, till the mifcrable ap-  
pearanca, iadicating an approaching cataftrophe,  
of thofe fent out by you, made it improper.  
For feeing that a difficulty might arife, and  
that it might be expected that I fhould account  
for the whole of them, which I by no means  
thought equitable, it became necefiary that the  
matter fhould be adjufted, and the due propor-  
tion fettled, for which T’ought to be refpon-  
file, before any thing farther could be done  
on my part, Upon this ground flands alfo the  
  
detention of thofe who have been fince cap-  
tured,  
  
Added to thefe confiterationsthe difcrimi-  
nation fet up in the inftance of General Lee, is  
to be regarded a$ utterly irreconcilcable to  
the tenor of our agreement, and an uvafur-  
mountable obftacle to a compliance with your  
demands,  
  
Thus, Sir, have I explained the motives of  
my conduct, and, I tru@, vindicoted mvifelt,  
in the eye of impartiality, from the improper  
and groundlefs charge which you, and the  
gentleman aéting by your authority, have beea  
pleafed to alledve againit me. ~ifin doing  
this J have deourted in the fialleit degree from  
that delicacy which 1 always wifhed fhould  
form a part of my charaer, you will remem-  
ber I have been forced into recrimination, and  
that it has becume an att of neceTary juftice.  
  
I fhali now declaye it to be my ardent with,  
that a general exchange may take plice on gene-  
rous and liberal principles, as tar as it can be  
effected, and that the azreement fubfifling be-

oblerved 5 and I cal! upon you, by every obli-  
gation of good faith, to remove all impedimen:s  
On your part to the accomplifhment of it. If,  
however, you do not, I confole my felf with a

Morris-Town, April 9, 1777.  
Sir,  
I TAKE the liberty of tranfinitting  
yee a copy of a paper addreffed to me  
  
y Lieut. Col. Walcott, of your ar-  
my, which came inclofed in a letter  
from Lieut. Gen. Lord Cornwallis.  
Tt is with peculiar regret I am con-  
ftrained to obferve, that this illiberal  
performance of Col. Walcott is ob-  
vioufly calculated to anfwer a Icfs ge-  
perous purpofe than that of merely  
effe€ting an exchange, contains a grofs  
mifreprefentation of faéts, and is a  
palpable deviation from that delicate  
Fine which I expeGled would mark his  
conduét as a man of candcur and jn-  
genuity.  
  
That gentleman has cepfured twa  
articles infifted on by me throuch Lieut.  
Col. Harrifon, at their meeting on the  
roth ult. as groundlefs, unprecedentcd,  
and inconfiflent with any degree of rea-  
fon or common fenfe, though founded,  
as I conceive, in the dearth principles  
of equity and juftice.— Not contenting  
h.mfelf with this, which would have  
  
a  
  
given me no concern, h. has affumed  
the privilege of mutilating and mis-  
tating thofe articles, in fuch a manner  
as to change their meaning, and to  
adapt them to the unfair conclufions  
kee wifhed to eftablith.  
  
Having premifed thefe things, and  
being charged in dire&amp;t and pofitive  
terms by Col. Walcott, who aéted  
under your authority, with a violation  
of the agreement made between us for  
the exchange of prifoners, and called  
upon for a performance of the fame,  
I think it neceffary to explain the mo-  
tives of my conduét, and the grounds  
on which thofe articles or objections  
ftand.  
  
By refpe&amp; to the firft, I freely re-  
peat, that I do not hold myfelf bound,  
either by the fpirit.of the agreement,  
or by the principles of juftice, to ac-  
count for thofe prifoners, who, from  
the rigour and feverity of their treat-  
ment,were in fo emaciated and languifh-  
ing a ftate, at the time they came out,  
as to render their death almoft certain  
and inevitable, and which, in many  
inftances, happened while they were  
returning to their homes, and in many  
others after their arrival. You mutt  
be fenfible that our engagement, as  
well as all others of the kind, though  
in letter it exprefles only an equality  
of rank and number as the rule of  
exchange, yet it neceflarily implies a  
regard to the general principles of  
mutual compenfation and advantage.  
This is inherent in its nature, is the  
voice of reafon, and no ftipulation as  
to the condition in which prifoners  
fhould be returned, was requifite. Hu-  
manity distated, that their treatment  
fhonld be fuch as their health and  
comfort demanded ; and where her laws  
have been duly refpeéted, their condi-  
tion has been generally good. Nor is  
this the language of Humanity alone  
—Juftice declares the fame. The ob-  
ject of every cartel, or fimilar agree-  
ment, is the benefit of the prifonerg  
themfelves, and that of the contend-  
ing powers—on this footing, it equal-  
ly exaéts, that they fhould be well  
treated, as that they fhould be ex-  
changed : the reverfe is therefore an  
evident infraction, and ought to fub-  
ject the party, on whom it is charge-  
able, to all the damage and ill confe-  
quences refulting from it. * Nor can if  
be expected, that thofe unfitted for  
future fervice by adts of feverity, in di-  
rest violation of the compaé, are pro-  
per fubjects for an exchange. In fuch

3. cafe, to return others not in the fame  
predicament, would he to give without  
receiving an equivalent, and would af-  
ford the greateft encouragement to  
cruelty and inhumanity. The argu-  
ment drawn from the mere circum-  
ftances of the prifoners having been  
received, is of no validity. Though  
from their wretched fituation, they  
could not at that time be deemed pro-  
per for an exchange, our humanity re-  
quired that they fhould be permitted  
to return amongft us. It may perhaps  
be fairly doubted, whether an appre-  
henfion of their death, or that of a  
great part of them, did not contribute  
fomewhat to their being fent out when  
they were. Such an event, whilft they  
remained with you, would have been  
truly interefting, becaufe it would have  
dettroyed every fhadow of claim for  
the return of the prifoners in your  
hands, and therefore policy, concur-~  
sing with humanity, digtated that the  
meafure fhould be adopted. Happy  
had it been, if the expedient had been  
thought of before thefe ill-fated men  
were reduced to fuch extremity. It is  
confeffed, however, on all fides, that  
after their. delivery they ftill continued  
your prifoners, and would be {o, till  
regularly exchanged. I acknowledge  
that I fhould be, and I have been, &lt;4  
ways willing, notwithftanding this  
confeffion, to account for every man  
who was in a proper condition, and  
fit to be exchanged at the time they  
came out, fo far as the proportion of  
prifoners with us would extend. With  
what propriety, or upon what founda-  
tion of juitice, can more be demanded ?  
This has been propofed, or, what is  
the fame, was moft clearly implied in  
the fir&#x27;t article, or objection, made by  
Lfeut. Col. Harrifon, and illiberally  
rejected fince, inconfiftent with any  
degree of reafon or common fenfe.  
Painful as it is, I am compelled to  
confider it as a faé&amp;t not to be quef-  
tioned, that the ufage of our prifoners  
whilft in your pofleffion, the privates  
at leaft, was fuch as could not be juf-  
tified. This was proclaimed by the  
concurrent teftimony of all who came  
out, their appearance fanétified the af-  
fertion, and melancholy experience, in  
the fpeedy death of a large part of  
them, ftamped it with infallible cer-  
tainty. ‘  
  
In.refpe&amp; to the fecond article in-  
fifed on, your difciiminating Major-  
General Lee from other captive officers  
belonging to the American army, de-  
  
~~  
  
  
  
manded my particular attention. I was  
authorized to conclude from your let-  
ter of the 23d of January laft, that you  
confidered him in a fingular point of  
view, and meant to exclude him from  
the common right of exchange ftipu-  
lated for all jo in general terms.  
This diftin&amp;tion, the more injurious and  
unwarrantable as you never excepted  
him, though you knew him to be an of-  
ficer in our army at the time, and long  
before, the agreement was entered into,  
made it my duty to affert his right in  
an explicit manner, and to endeavour to  
put the matter on fo unequivocal a  
footing as to enfure his enlargement  
whenever an officer of equal rank, be-  
longing to your army, fhould be in our  
power. This was attempted by the  
article, and nothing more —nor is any  
other inference to be drawn from it.—  
It is-true, a propofition was made fince  
his captivity to give‘a certain number  
of officers of inferior rank in exchange.  
for him, but it was not claimed as a  
matter of right.—What mame then  
does that proceeding merit, by which  
itis fuggetted that the immediate re-  
leafe of General Lee had been de-  
manded, without having an officer of  
equal rank to give for him? The fug-  
geftion cannot be fupported by~ the  
moft tortured expofition, nor will it  
have credit where candour is deemed a  
virtue, and words preferve their form  
and meaning.  
  
As to the charge of delay in net re-  
turning the prifoners in our hands—  
the difperfed fituation of thofe taken  
at a more early period of the war,  
through the different States, arifing  
from the circumftauces of their cap-  
tivity, and a regard to their better ac-  
commodation, made their detention for  
aconfiderable time unavoidable. When  
the agreement fubfiiting between us  
took place, the fpeedieft direétions were  
given to have them collected, that an  
exchange might be effe€ted. This was  
done in part, and at a junéture when  
motives of policy oppoied the mea-  
fures, but were made to yield to rigid  
maxims of good faith. We were pur-  
fuing the exchange, and continued our  
exertions to accomplith it, till the mi-  
ferable appearance indicating an ap-  
proaching cataftrophe of thofe fent out  
by you, made it improper: for feeing  
that a difficulty might arife, and that  
it might be expeéted that I fhould ac-  
count for the whole of them, which I  
by no means thought equitable, it be-  
came necetlary that the matter fhould  
  
be  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
358  
be adjufted, and the due proportion  
fettled, for which I ought to be re-  
fponfible, before any thing farther  
could be done on my part. Upon this  
ground ftands alfo the detention of  
thofe who have been fince captured.  
  
Added to thefe confiderations, the  
difcrimination fet up in the inftance of  
Gen. Lee, is to be regarded as utterly  
irreconcileable to the tenor of our a-  
greement, and an infurmountable ob-  
ftacle to a compliance with your de-  
mand.  
  
Thus, Sir, have I explained the mo-  
tives of my conduét, and, I truft, vin-  
dicated myfelf, in the eye of impar-  
tiality, from the improper and ground-  
lefs charge which you, and the Gen-  
leman acting by your authority, have  
been pleafed to allege againft me. If,  
in doing this, I have departed, in the  
fmalleft degree, from that delicacy  
which I always wifhed fhould form a  
~ of my charaéter, you will remem-  
  
er I have been forced into a recrimi-  
nation, and that it has become an act  
of neceffary juftice.  
  
I fhall now declare it to be my ar-  
dent with, thata general exchange may  
take place, on juft and liberal princi-  
ples, as far as it can be effected, and  
that the agreement fubfifting between  
us for that purpofe fhould be invio-  
lably preferved’; and I call upon you,  
by every obligation of good faith, to  
remove ‘all impediments on your part  
to theaecamplifhment of it. If, how-  
ever, you donot, I confole myfelf with  
a hope that thofe unfortunate men,  
whofe lot it is to be your prifoners,  
will bear their fufferings with becom-  
ing fortitude and magnanimity.

SIR  Morriftown, April 9, 1777.  
I TAKE the liberty of tranfmit-  
ting you acopy of ‘a paper addreffed  
to me by Lieut..Col. Walcott of your  
army, which came inclofed in a letter

which I expeéted would mark his  
conduct as a man of candour and in-

‘That gentleman has cenfured two

of matilating and miftating thofe apti-  
cles, in fach a| manner as to change

the unfair conclufions he wifhed to  
eftablith.  
  
Having premifed thefe thingssgpnd  
being charged in dire&amp; and pofitive

SIR, Morrifiown, April 95 £777  
Take the liberty of tranfmitting you a  
copy of a paper addrefled ta me by  
  
Lieut. Colonel Walcott of your army,  
which came inclofed in a letter from Lieut.  
Gen. Lord Cornwallis. It 1s with pecu-  
liar regret I am conftrained to obferve,  
that this illiberal performance of Col. Wal-  
cott is obvioufly calculated to anfwer a  
lefs generous purpofe than that of merel  
efiecting an exchange, containg a gro  
mifreprefentation of facts, and is a palpa-.  
ble deviation from that delicate line, which  
I expected would mark his conduct asa  
man of candour and ingenuity.  
  
That gentleman has cenfured two arti-  
cles infitted on by me through Lieut. Col,  
Harrifon, at their meeting on the roth ult.  
as groundlefs, unprecedented, and incon-  
fiftent with any degree of reafon or com-  
mon fenfe, though founded as I conceive,  
in the cleareft principles of 7 pee and  
juftice.— Not contenting himfeif with this,  
which would have given me no concern,  
he has affumed the privilege of mutilating  
and miftating thofe articles, infuch a man-  
ner, as to change their meaning, and to  
adapt them to the unfair conclufions he  
withed to eftablith. a

c€4 Proceedings of the American Colonics. Ay  
  
charged in direct and pofitive terms by  
Col. Walcott, who acted under your au-  
thority, with a violation of the agreement  
made between us for the exchange of pri-  
foners, and called upon for a performance  
of the fame, I think it neceflary to ex-  
plain the motives of my conduct and the  
grounds on which thofe articles or objec-  
tions ftand.  
  
By refpect to the firlt, I freely repeat,  
that 1 donot hold myfelf bound, either by  
the {pirit of the agreement, or by the prin-  
ciples of jufticé, to account for thofe pri-  
foners, who, from the rigour and feverity  
of their treatment, were in fo emaciated  
  
and languifhing a ftate at the time they  
  
came out, asto render their death almott  
certain andinevitable, and which, mm many  
inflances, happened while they were re-  
turning to their homes, andin many others  
after their arrival, You muft be fenfible  
that our engagement, as well as all others  
of the kind, though in letter it expreffes  
only an equality of rank and number as  
the rule of exchange, yet it neceflarily  
implies a regard to the general principles  
of mutual compenfation and advantage.  
‘This is inherent in its nature, isthe voice  
of reafon, and no flipulation, as to the  
condition in which prifoners would be re-  
turned, was requifite. Humanity dictated,  
that their treatment fhould be fuch as  
their health and comfort demanded; and  
where her laws have been duly refpected,  
their condition has been generally good.—  
Nor is this the language of humanity  
alone—jufltice declares the fame. ‘The ob-  
jet of every cartel, or fimilar agreement,  
is the benefit of the prifoners themfeives  
and that of the contending powers,—on  
thisfooting, it equally exacts, that they  
fhould be well treated, as that they fhould  
be exchanged: ‘The reverfe is therefore  
an evident infraction, and ought to fub-  
ject the party, on whom it is chargeable,  
to all the damage and ill confequences re-  
foltine from it. Nor can it be expected,  
that thofe unfitted for future fervice by acts  
of feverity, in direct violation of a compact,  
are. proper fubjects for an exchange. In  
fuch a cafe, to return others not in the  
  
me predicament, would beto give with-  
out receiving an equivalent, and would af-  
ford the greateft encouragement to cruclty  
and inhumanity. The argument drawn  
from the mere circumilance of the prifon-  
ers having been received, is of no validity.  
Tho’ from their wretched fituation, they  
could not at that time be deemed propcr  
for an exchange, our humanity required  
thatthey fhould be peygnitted to return  
amongft us. It may perhaps be fairly  
doubted, whether an apprehenfion of their  
  
@eath, or that cf a great part qf them,  
  
did not contribute fomewhat to theirhe:  
fent out when they were. Such ap  
whilft they remained with y titer,  
  
rae te - YOU, Would  
have been truly interefting, becaufe ;  
would -have deftroyed every thadow &gt;  
claim for the return of the Prifoners j  
your hands ; and therefore policy, concur.  
ring with humanity, dictated that the mea.  
fure fhould be adopted. Happy hag .  
been, if the expedient had been thought  
of before thefe ill-fated men were reduced  
to fuch extremity. It is confeffed however  
on all fides, that after their delivery they  
{till continued your prifoners, and would  
be fo, tillregularly exchanged. I acknow.  
ledge, that I fhould be, and I have beep  
always willing, notwithftanding this con.  
feffion, to account for every man who wag  
in a proper condition, and fit to be ex.  
changed at the time they came out, f  
far as the proportion of prifoners with ys  
would extend. With what propriety, of  
upon what foundation of juftice, can more  
be demanded? This has been propofed,  
or what isthe fame, was mott clearly im-  
plied in the firft article, or objection, made  
by Lieut. Col. Harrifon, and illiberally re.  
jected fince, inconfiftent with any degree  
of reafon or common fenfe. Painful asit  
is, Iam compelled to confider it asa fad  
not to be queftioned, that the ufage of  
our prifoners whilft in your poffeftion, the  
privates at leaft, was fuch as could not be  
juftified. This was proclaimed by the con-  
current teftimony of all who came out,  
their appearance fanctified the aflertion,—  
and melancholy experience, 1n the {peedy  
death of a large part of them, ftamped tt  
with infallible certainty.  
  
In refpect to the fecond article infilted  
on,—your diicriminating Major Gen. Lee  
from other captive officers belonging to  
the American army, demanded my parte

with you would have been truly interesting ; because  
it would have destroyed every shadow of claim  
for a return of the prisoners in our hands; and  
therefore policy concurring with humanity dic-  
tated that the measure should be adopted. Happy  
had it been if the expedient had been thought of  
before these ill-fated men were reduced to such  
extremity.” He also accuses him directly o

that the engagement, though in the letter,  
expressed only an equality of rank and

to she geheral principles of mutual compen

and no stipulation as to the condition in  
which prisoners should be returned, is  
requisite. Nor can it be expected that these  
unntted for future service by acts of severi  
ty, in direct violation of a compact, are  
proper subjects for an exchange. In such  
case, to return others not in the same pre­  
dicament, would be to give without re­  
ceiving an equivalent, and would afford the  
greatest encouragement to cruelties and in­  
humanities.&quot; &quot;Painful as it is,&quot; he said in  
conclusion, &quot;I am compelled to consider it  
as a fact not to be questioned, that the usag  
of our prisoners whilst in your possession, of  
the privates at least, was such as could not  
be justified. This was proclaimed by the  
concurrent testimony of all who came out;

and melancholy experience, in the speedy  
death of a large part of them, stamped it  
with infallible certainty.&quot;Letter to Oen
