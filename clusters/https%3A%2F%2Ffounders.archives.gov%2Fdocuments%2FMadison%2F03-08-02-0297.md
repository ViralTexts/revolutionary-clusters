Under these circumstances no choice remain’d to the U.S. but a surrender of their rights as an Independent nation, &amp; their interests as a Commercial one, or a determination to maintain both, by open &amp; honorable war.  
This puts to silence the 2d charge that a moment was chosen by the U.S. for their declaration of war, when G.B. was struggling for her own existence, agst. a power threatening to overwhelm the Independence of all Europe. As the war was forced by the persevering aggressions of G.B. the moment of it was forced by that at wch. G.B. chose to render a further delay disgraceful.  
Is it true that the existence of G.B. was in danger? The U.S. never believed it, and events have justified the belief. It was always their opinion, that they had more to dread from her maritime power, than she had to dread from the territorial power of her Enemy, and the present state of th

The U.S. notwithstanding the unfriendly dispositions and illiberal policy of G.B. towards them, have never indulged sentiments incompatible with a reciprocity of good will, and a system of intercourse favorable to both parties. They wish to see the B. nation, great prosperous &amp; happy, safe in its maritime rights, and powerful in the resources for maintaining them. But they wish to see her Councils guided by justice &amp; respect for the equal rights of other nations; and her maritime power not extending beyond the controul, of that of all the world united: because so transcendent a power in a single hand, is more likely to be abused, than a greater power in many hands is to be combined for purposes of oppression &amp; usurpation.

‘the Americans having already declared war. It is expressly  
  
admitted in the document before us (p. 68.) that, * had their  
repeal been made known to the United States before their  
resort to arms, it would have arrested it ; and, that cause of  
war being removed, the other essential cause, the practice  
of impressment, would have been the subject of renewed  
negociation.’

We copy with still greater satisfaction a passage from the  
end of the work, which is expressive, we hope, of the real  
feelings of America towards us: ‘ The United States have  
never indulged towards England sentiments incompatible  
with the reciprocity of good will, and an intercourse of mu-  
tual benefit and advantage. ‘They can never repine at seeing  
the British nation great, prosperous, and happy; safe in its  
maritime rights, and powerful in its means ef maintaining  
them.’

war, the repeal of these decrees against neutral com-  
merce would have arrested the resort to arms; and  
that one cause of the war being removed, the other  
essential cause—the practice of impressment—would  
have been the subject of renewed negotiation. But  
the declaration of war having given the practice of  
impressment as one of the principal causes, peace  
could only be the result of an express abandonment  
of that practice.  
  
I think we may say that if the elec-  
tric telegraph had been in existence on  
the twenty-third of June, 1812, it is at
