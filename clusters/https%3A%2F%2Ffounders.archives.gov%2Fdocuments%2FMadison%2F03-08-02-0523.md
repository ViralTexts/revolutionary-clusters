shington February 18th 1815  
  
I lay before Congress, copies of the Treaty of Peace and Amity, between the United States and His Britannic Majesty, which was signed by the commissioners of both parties, at Ghent, on the 24th of December 1814, and the ratifications of which have been duly exchanged.  
While performing this act, I congratulate you, and our constituents, upon an event which is highly honorable to the nation, and terminates, with peculiar felicity, a campaign signalized by the most brilliant successes.  
The late war, although reluctantly declared by congress, had become a necessary resort, to assert the rights and independence of the nation. It  
  
has been waged with a success, which is the natural result of the wisdom of the Legislative Councils, of the patriotism of the people, of the public spirit of the militia, and of the valor of the military and Naval forces of the country. Peace, at all times a blessing, is peculiarly welcome, therefore, at a period, when the causes for the war have ceased to operate; when the Government has demonstrated the efficiency of its powers of defence; and when the nation can review its conduct, without regret, and without reproach.  
I recommend to your care and beneficence, the gallant men, whose achievements, in every department of military service, on the land, and on the water, have so essentially contributed to the honor of the American name, and to the restoration of peace. The feelings of conscious patriotism and worth, will animate such men, under every change of fortune and pursuit; but their country performs a duty to itself, when it bestows those testimonials of approbation and applause which are, at once, the reward, and the incentive, to great actions.  
The reduction of the public expenditures, to the demands of a peace establishment, will doubtless engage the immediate attention of Congress. There are however, important considerations which forbid a sudden and general revocation of the measures that have been produced by the war. Experience has taught us, that neither the pacific dispositions of the American people, nor the pacific character of their political Institutions can altogether exempt them from that strife which appears, beyond the ordinary lot of nations, to be incident to the actual period of the world; and the same faithful monitor demonstrates that a certain degree of preparation for war, is not only indispensable to avert disaster in the onset, but affords also the best security for the continuan⟨ce⟩ of peace. The wisdom of congress will therefore I am confident provide for the maintenance of an adequate regular force; for the gradual advance of the naval establishment; for improving all the means of Harbour defence; for adding discipline to the distinguished bravery of the militia; and for cultivating the military art, in its essential branches under the liberal patronage of the Government.  
The resources of our Country were, at all times competent to the attainment of every national object; but they will now be enriched &amp; invigorated by the activity which peace will introduce, into all the scenes of domestic enterprize &amp; labour. The provision that has been made for the public creditors, during the present session of Congress, must have a decisive effect in the establishment of the public credit, both at home &amp; abroad. The reviving interests of commerce will claim the Legislative attention, at the earliest opportunity; and such regulations will I trust be seasonably devised, as shall secure to the United States, their just proportion of the navigation of the world. The most liberal policy towards other nations, if met by corresponding dispositions, will in this respect, be found the most  
  
beneficial policy towards ourselves. But there is no subject, that can enter, with greater force &amp; merit into the deliberations of congress, than a consideration of the means, to preserve and promote the manufactures which have sprung into existence, and attained an unparalleled maturity, throughout the U. States during the period of the European wars. This source of national independence &amp; wealth, I anxiously recommend, to the prompt &amp; constant guardianship of Congress.  
The termination of the Legislative Sessions, will soon separate you, Fellow Citizens, from each other, and restore you, to your Constituents. I pray you to bear with you, the expressions of my sanguine hope that the peace which has been just declared, will not only be the foundation of the most friendly intercourse between the U. States and Great Britain, but that it will also be productive of happiness &amp; harmony, in every section of our beloved Country. The influence of your precepts &amp; example, must be every where powerful: And while we accord in grateful acknowledgments for the protection which Providence has bestowed upon us, let us never cease to inculcate obedience to the laws, and fidelity to the Union, as constituting the Palladium of the national independence &amp; prosperity.

I lay before Congress a copy oftlie  
treaiy of peace &amp; amity between the  
U. States anti his Britannic Majesty,  
which wsw signed by the entnom­  
sianers of both parties at Ohm!, on  
the 2Ufa of December, iSii,. and  
the ratifications of which luve been  
duly exchanged.  
While performing this :ict. I con- !  
gratulate you, and o»jr constituents,  
upon an event which is highly bonbra  
hie to the uationuand terminateswith  
peculiar felicity a campaign sigmtlis  
ed by the «iost brilliant smcec*s~  
P9.  
The late war, altho^gn reluctantly  
declared by Congress, hull become n  
necessary resort, to assert the i ights  
and independence of the nation, it  
has been waged with* success which  
is the natural result of the legislative  
counsels, of the patriotism of the  
people, of tlie public spirit of the  
militia, and of the valor of the uiili­  
tary;and naval forces of the country.  
Peace, at all times a blessing, is  
peculiary welcome, therefore, at a  
period when the causes for the war  
have ceased to operate ; when the  
government bus demonstrated the  
efficiency of its powers of defence;  
and when the nation can review its  
cbnduitt without regret, and without  
reproach. \
  
I recommend to your care St bene­  
,licence, tbe gallant men whose  
achievements, in every dep irtmeut of  
military service, on tbe land and on  
the water* have so essentially con  
tributed to tbe honor of*, he Vmericin  
name, and to the restoration of  
peace. The feelings of conscious  
patriotism and worth will animate  
such men, under every change of  
fortune and pursuit ; but their coun­  
try performs a duty to itself, when  
it bestows those testimonials of ap  
probation and applause, which are,  
at once, the reward, tbe incentive,  
to great actions.  
The reduction of tbe public ex­  
penditures (o tbe demands of a peace  
establishment will, doubtless, engage  
the immediate attention of Congress.  
There are, however, important con­  
siderations which forbid a sudden and  
general revocation of the measures  
that have been produced by the war.  
Experience has taught us, that nei­  
ther the pacific dispositions of the A­  
uieriean people, nor the pacific  
character of their political institu­  
tions, can altogether exempt them  
from that strife which appears, be­  
yond the ordinary lot of nations, to  
be incident to the actual period ot  
the world ; and the same faithful  
monitor demonstrates that a certain  
degree of preparation for war* is not  
only indispensable to avert disaster  
in the onset, but affords also the best  
security for the continuance of peace.  
The wisdom of Congress will, there­  
fore, I am confident, provide for the  
maintenance of an adequate regular  
force ; for the gradual advance of the  
naval establishment; for improving  
all the moans of harbor deionee; lot

adding discipline to the distinguished  
bravery of lbe militia, aud fee eul­  
jyaiiog the military an, in it«  
seutial branches, under lb© liberal  
patronage ®l# government. | , v ^  
The resources of our country were  
at hII times, eonipetem to the attain­  
ment of every national objtfet ; but  
they will now be enriched aud in­  
vigorated by the activity which  
peace will introduce into all the  
seenesof domestic’ enterprise and  
labour. The provision that has been  
made for the public creditors, during  
the present session of Congress, must  
have a decisive in the.establish­  
ment of the public credit, both at  
home and abroad. The reriving in­  
terests of commerce will claim the  
legislative attention at the earliest  
opportunity; and such regulations  
will, f trust be seasonably devised as  
shall secure to the U. States their  
just proportion of the navigation of  
the world. The most liberal policy  
towards other nations, if met by cor  
responding dispositions, will* in this  
respect, be found the must beneficial  
policy towards ourselves. Rut there  
is no* subject that can enter with  
greater force and merit into the  
deliberation of Congress, than a con­  
j side ratio ii of the means to preserve  
and promote the manufacture* w hicb

throughout the IJ. S. during the pe­  
riod of the European war. fl his

1 lay before congress copies of the treaty of  
  
peace and amity between the United States and  
his Britannic majesty, which was signed by the  
commissioners of both parties at Ghent, on the  
24th of December, 1314, and the ratifications oi  
which have been duly exchanged.  
  
While performing this act, I congratulate you,  
and our constituents, upon an event which is  
highly honourable to the nation, and terminateii  
with peculiar felicity a campaign signalised by  
the most brilliant successes.  
  
The late war, although reluctantly declared  
by congress, had become a necessary resort,  
to assert the rights and independence of the na¬  
tion. It has been waged with a success which  
is the natural result of the legislative counsels,  
of the patriotism of the people, of the public  
spirit of the militia, and of the valour of the mili¬  
tary and naval forces of the country. Peace, at  
all times a blessing, is peculiarly welcome,  
therefore, at a period w hen the causes for the  
war have ceased to operate; when the govern¬  
ment has demonstrated the efficiency of its pow¬  
ers of defence; and when the nation can review*  
its conduct without regret, and without re¬  
proach.&#x27;  
  
I recommend to your care and beneficence,  
the gallant men whose achievements, in every  
department of military service, on the land and  
on the water, have so essentially contributed to  
the honour of the American name, and to the  
restoration of peace. The feelings of conscious  
patriotism and worth will animate such men,  
under every change of fortune and pursuit; hut  
their country performs a duty to itself, when  
it bestows those testimonials of approbation and  
applause, which are, at once, the revvaril, and  
the incentive, to great actions.  
  
The reduction of the public expenditures to  
the demands of a peace establishment will,  
doubtless, engage the immediate attention of  
congress. There are, however, important con¬  
siderations which Ibrbid a sudden and general  
revocation of the measures that have been pro¬  
duced by the war. Experience has taught us,  
that neither the pacific dispositions of the Ameri¬  
can people, nor tlie pacific character of their po¬  
litical institutions, can altogether exempt them  
from that strife which appears, beyond the or¬  
dinary lot of nations, to be incident to the actual  
period of the world ; and the same faithful mo¬  
nitor demonstrates that a certain degree of pre¬  
paration for war, is not only indispensable to  
avert disaster in the onset, but affords also the  
best security for the continuance of peace. The  
wisdom of congress will, therefore, I am confi¬

I lay before Con gress copies of the treaty of  
peace and amity between the U. States and his  
Britannic Majesty, which was signed by the  
commissioners of both parties at Ghent, on the  
24th of December, 1814, and the raifications of  
which have been duly exchanged. &#x27;  
While performing this act, I congratulate  
you, and our constituents, upon an event which  
is highly honorable 1o the nation, and terminates  
with peculiar felicity a campsign signalised by  
the most brilliant success.  
The late war, although rcluctantly declared  
by Comgress, had become a nceessury resort, 1o  
assert the rights and independence of the na­  
tion. It has been waged with a success whiclh  
is the nawral result of the legislative counseis,  
of the patriotism of the peopie, of the public  
spirit of the militia, and of the valour of ihe  
military and naval forces of the country. Peuce,  
at all times a blessing, is peculiarly welcome,  
therefore, us a period when the causes for the  
war have ceased to operate ; when the govern.-  
ment has demonstrated the efficacy of its pow­  
ers of defence; and whed the nation can re­  
view its conduct without regret, and without  
reproach.  
  
I recommend to your care and beneficence,  
the gallant men whose achievements, in every  
department of military service, on the lund and  
on the water, have so essentially contributed to  
the honor of the American name, and to the  
restoration of peace. The feelings of conscious  
patriotism and worth will animate such men,  
under every change of fortune and pursuit ;  
but their country performs a duty to itseli,  
when it bestows those testimonials of approba­  
tion and applause, which are, at once, the re­  
ward and the incentive to great actions.  
The reduction 6f the public expeaditures to  
the demands of a peace establishment will,  
doubtless, engage the immediate attention of  
Congress. There are, however, important con­  
siderations which forbid a sudden and general  
revocation of themeasures that -have been pro­  
duced by the war. Experience has taught us,  
that neither the pacific dispositions of the A­  
merican people, ner the pacific character of  
their political institutions, can altogether ex­  
empt them from that strife which appears, be­  
yond the ordinary lot of nations, to be incident  
to the actual perivd of the world; and the  
same faithful monitor, demonstrates that a cer­  
tain degree of preparation for war, is not only  
indispensable to avert disaster in the onset but  
affords also the best security for the continu­  
ance of peace. The wisdom of Congress will,  
therefore, I am confident, provide for the main­  
tenance of anadequate regular force ; for the  
gradual advanee of the naval establishment ;  
for improving all the means of harboer defence :  
for adding discipline to the distinguished brav­  
ery of the militia, and for eultivating the mili­  
tary art, in its essential branches, under the  
liberal patronage of gevernment.  
The resources of our country were, at all  
times, competent to the attainment of every  
national object ; but they will now be enriched  
and invigorated by the activity which peace  
will introduce inte all the scenes of domestic  
enterprize and labor. The prevision that has  
been made for the public creditors, during the  
present session of Congress, must have a deci­  
sive effect in the establishment of public cred­  
it, both at homs and abroad. The reviving in­  
terests of ceininerse will claim the legislative  
attention at the earliest opportunity ; and such  
regulations will, I trust, be seasonably devised  
as shall secure to the U. States their just pro­  
portion of the navigation of the world. The  
most liberal policy towards other natious, if met  
by corresponding dispositions, will, in:this re­  
spect, be found the most beneficial policy to­  
wards ourselves, DBut there is no subject that  
can enter with greater force and merit into the  
deliberations ot Congress; than.a consideration  
of the means to preserve and promote the man­  
ufactures which have sprung into existence, &amp;  
atlained an unparalleled maturity throughout  
the United States during the period of the Eu­  
ropean wars. This source of national inde­  
pendence and wealth, I anxiously recommend  
to the prompt and censtant guardianship of  
Congress,  
The termination of the legislative session  
will soon separate you, fellow-citizens, from  
each other, and restore you to your constituents.  
I pray you to bear with you the expression of  
my sanguine hope, that the peace which has

tion of the most friendly intercourse between

The late war, although reluctantly declared  
by Congress, had become a neccssary resort,  
to assert the rights and independence of the  
nation. It has been waged witha success  
which is the natural result of the legislative  
counsels, of the patriotism of the people, of

Peoce, at all times a blessing, is pecultasly  
welcome, therefore, ata period when the  
causes for the war have ceased to’ operate;  
when the governm.ent has demonstrated the  
cfficacy of 11s powers of defence ; and when  
the naton can review its conduct withoit re­  
gret, and without reproach.  
I recommend to your care and ben« ficencs,  
the gallant men whose achicvements, in eve&#x27;y

The reduction of the public expenditures

considerations which forbid a sudden and gens

us, that neither the pacific dispositicns of the  
American people, nor the pacific character of

empt them from that strife which appears,  
beyond the ordinary lot of nations, to be inci­

the same fanthful monitor demonstraies that  
a certain degree of preparation for war,is not  
only indispensabie to avert disaster in the ons  
sct, but affords also the best security for g  
continvance of peace. The wisdom of Cont

for the maintenance of an adequate regular

beyond the ordinary lot of nations, to be incident to  
the actual period of the world -r and the same faith­  
ful monitor demonstrates thai a certain degree of

Tlay before Congress copies of the Treaty  
of peace and amity between the United States  
and his Britannic Majesty, which was signed  
by the commissioners of both parties at Ghent,  
on the 2tth of Dec. and the raittfications of  
which have been duly exchanged,  
  
While performing this act, I congratulate  
you and your constituents, upon an event  
which is highly honourable to the nation, and  
terminates with peculiar felicity a campaign  
signalized by the most brilliant success.  
  
The late war, although reluctantly declared  
by Congress, had become a necessary resort,  
of the nation. It has been waged with a sue-  
cess which is the natural result of legislative  
counsels, of the patriotism of the people, ofthe  
wiblick spirit ofthe militia, and of the valour  
of the military and naval forces of the country.  
Peace, atall timcs a blessing, is peculiarly  
welcome, therefore, at a period when the  
causes for the war have ceased to operate :  
when the government has demonstrated the  
eficiency of its powers of defenee ; &amp; when  
the nation can review its conduct without re-  
gret, and without reproach.  
  
I recommend to your care and beneficence,  
the gailant men whose achievements, inevery  
department of military service, on the land &amp;  
on the water, have soessentially contributed to  
the honour of the American name, and to the  
restorition of peace. The feelings of conscious  
patriotism and worth will animate such men,  
under every change of fortune and pursuit ; but  
their country performs a daty to itself, when it  
bestows those testimonials of approbation and  
applause, which are at once the reward and in-  
centive to to great actions.  
  
The reduction of the public exnenditares to  
the demauds of a peace establishinent, wilt  
doubtless engage the attention of Congress.  
There are, however, important eonsiderations  
which forbid a certain and general revo-  
cation ofthe measures that have been pron  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
duced jy the war. Experience has taught  
us, that neither the pacifick dispositions of the  
American people, nor the pacifick character of  
their political institutions, can altogether ex-  
empt them from that strife which appears, be-  
yond the ordinary lot of nations, to be incident  
to the actual period of the world: and the  
same faith{ul monitor dcmonstrates that a cer-  
tain degree of preparation for war, is net cniy  
indispensable lo avert disasters in the onset, but  
affords also the best security for the continu-  
ance of peace. ‘The wisdom of Congress will  
therefore, I am confident, provide for the  
maintenance of an adequate regular  
force; for the gradual advance of the na-  
val establishment; for improving all the  
means of harbour defence: for adding dis-  
cipline to the\distinguished Lravery of the  
militia, and for cultivating the military art, in  
its essential branches under the liberal patren-  
age of Government.  
  
The resources of our country were, at all  
times, competent to the attainment ofevery na-  
tisnal object; but-they will now be enriched  
and invigorated by the activity which peace  
will introdaee into al! the scenes of domestic  
enterprize and labour. ‘The provision that has  
been made for the publick creditors, during the  
present session of congress, must have a deei-  
sive effect in the establishment of the publick  
eredit, both at aome &amp; abroad. ‘The reviving  
interests of comamerce will claim the legislative  
attention at the earliest opportunity ; and suc!  
regulations will, E trust, be seasonably devised  
as shall secure to the United States their just  
proportion of the navigation of the world. The  
mest liberal policy tewards other nations, if  
  
‘met by corresponding dispositions, will, in this  
respect, be found the most beneficial poliey to-  
wards ourselves.—~ But there is no olaject that  
can enter with greater force and merit into the  
deliberation of Congress, than a consideratioa  
of the means to preserve and promote the ma-  
nafactares, which have sprung into existence,  
and attained an unparalleled maturity terough-  
out the United States, during the period ef  
the European war. This searce ef netional in-  
dependence and wealth, T anxiously recons-  
moad to the prompt and constant guardianship  
of Cangress.  
  
The termination of the legislative session will  
soon separate you, fellow-citizens, from each  
other, and restore you to your constituents. I  
pray you te bear with you the expression of  
my sangaine hope, that the peave tat has just  
been declared, will not only be the foundation  
of the most friendly intercourse between the  
§). Siates and G. Britain, butthat it will also  
be predactive of happiness and harmony in  
every section of our beloved couney. The  
influence of your presepts and example must  
be every where powerful ; and while we ac-  
cord in grateful acknowlecements for the pro-  
tection which Providence has bestowed] upen  
us, iet ws never cease to inculcate obedience to  
laws, and fidelity to the union, as constituting  
the palladiam of our national independence

1 lay before Congress copies of the treaty of  
peace and amity between the U. States and his  
Britannic Majesty, which was signed by the  
commissioners of both parties at Ghent, on the  
24lh of December, 1814, and the ratifications of  
which have been duly exchanged.  
  
While performing this act, 1 congratulate  
you, and our constituents, upon an event which  
is highly honorable to the nation, and termi-  
nates with peculiar felicity a campaign signal-  
ized by the most brilliant successes.  
  
The late war, although reluctantly declared  
by Congress, had become a necessary resort, to  
assert the rights and independence of the na-  
tion. It has been waged with a success which  
is the natural result of the legislative coun-  
sels, of the patriotism of the people, of the  
public spirit of the militia, and of the valor of  
  
the military and naval forces of the county.  
  
Peace, at all times a blessing, is peculiarly  
welcome, therefore, at a period when the causes  
for the war have ceased to operate ; when the  
government has demonstrated the efficiency of  
its powers of defence ; and when the nation  
can review its conduct without regret, and

I recommend to your care and beneficence,  
the gallant men whose achievements, in every

ted to the honor of the American name, and  
to the restoration of peace. The feelings of  
conscious patriotism and worth will animate  
such men, under every change of fortune and  
pursuit : but their country performs a duty to  
itself, when it bestows those testimonials of  
approbation and applause, which, are, at once,  
the reward, and the incentive, to great ac-  
tions.  
  
The reduction of the public expenditures to  
the demands of a peace establishment will,  
doubtless, engage the immediate attention of  
Congress. There are, however, important con-  
siderations which forbid a sudden and general  
revocation of the. measures that have been pro-  
duced by the war. Experience lias taught  
us, that neither the pacific dispositions of the  
American people, nor the pacific character ot  
their political institutions, can altogether ex-  
empt them from that strife which appears,  
bevor.d the ordinary&#x27; lot of nations, to be inci-

the same faithful monitor demonstrates tha -  
certain degree of preparation for war, is ,

but affords also the best security for the con-

ving interests of commerce will claim the  
legislative attention at the earliest opportuni-  
ty ; and such regulations will, 1 trust, be sea-  
sonably devised as shall secure the U. States  
their just proportion of the navigation of the

no subject that can enter witli greater force

sprang into existence, anil attained an unpa-  
ralleled maturity throughout the U. States  
during the period of the European wars. This  
source of national independence and wealth, I  
anxiously recommend to the prompt and con-

The termination of the legislative session

I pray you to bear with vou the expressions of  
mv sanguine hope, that the peace which has

i iie resources oi our country were, at all  
times, competent to the attainment of every na­  
tional object ; but they will now be enriched and  
invigorated by the activity which peace will intro­  
duce into all the scenes of domestic enterprise and  
labour. The provision that has been made for the  
public creditors, during the present session of Con­  
gress, m’H have decisive effect in the establish­  
ment of the public credit, both at home and abroad.  
The reviving interests of commerce will claim the  
legislative attention at the earliest opportunity; and  
such regulations will, I trust, be seasonably devis­  
ed as shall secure to the United States their just  
proportion of the navigation of the world. The  
most liberal polfty towards other nations, if met  
by corresponding dispositions, will, in this respect,  
be found the most beneficial policy towards our­  
selves. But there is no subject which can enter  
with greater force into the deliberations of Con­  
gress, than a consideration of the means to pre­

ago forgot the message of President  
Munroe, writtten in 1815 :—‘‘ Experi-  
ence has taught us that neither the pa-  
cific disposition of the American people  
nor the pacific character of their politi-  
cal institutions can altogether exempt  
them from that strife which appears,  
beyond the ordinary lot of nations, to be  
incident to the actual period of the  
world; and the same faithful monitor  
demonstrates that a certain degree of  
preparation for war is not only indis-  
pensable to avert disaster in the outset,  
but affords also the best security for the  
continuance of peace. The wisdom of  
Congress will, therefore, Iam confident,  
provide for the maintenance of an ade-  
quate regular force ; for the gradual ad-  
vancement of the naval establishment ;  
for improving all the means of harbor  
defence ; for adding discipline to the dis-  
tinguished bravery of the militia; and  
for cultivating the military art, in all  
its branches, under the liberal patronage  
of government.”’
