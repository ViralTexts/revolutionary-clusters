The numerous defects, in our present military establishment, rendering many reformations and many new arrangements absolutely necessary, and Congress having been pleased to appoint you a Committee, in concert with me, to make and recommend such, as shall appear eligible, in persuance, of the various objects, expressed in their resolution for that purpose—I have in the following sheets briefly delivered my sentiments upon such of them as seemed to me most essential; so far, as observation has suggested, and leisure permitted. These are submitted to consideration, and I shall be happy, if they are found conducive to remedying the evils and inconveniences, we are now subject to, and putting the army upon a more respectable footing. Something must be done—important alterations must be made; necessity requires, that our resources should be enlarged and our system improved: for without it, if the dissolution of the army should not be the consequence, at least, its operations must infallibly be feeble, languid and ineffectual.  
  
As I consider a proper and satisfactory provision for officers, in a manner, as the basis of every other regulation and arrangement, necessary to be made; since without officers no army can exist and unless some measures be devised to place those of ours in a more desireable situation, few of them would be able, if willing, to continue in it, I shall begin with a few reflections, tending to prove the necessity.  
Of a half pay and pensionary establishment.  
A small knowledge of human nature will convince us, that, with far the greatest part of mankind, interest is the governing principle; and that, almost, every man is more or less, under its influence. Motives of public virtue may for a time, or in particular instances, actuate men to the observance of a conduct purely disinterested; but they are not of themselves sufficient to produce a persevering conformity to the refined dictates and obligations of social duty. Few men are capable of making a continual sacrifice of all views of private interest, or advantage, to the common good. It is in vain to exclaim against the depravity of human nature on this account—the fact is so, the experience of every age and nation has proved it, and we must, in a great measure, ch⟨ange⟩ the constitution of man, before we can make it otherwise. ⟨No⟩ institution, not built on the presumptive truth of these ma⟨xims,⟩ can succeed.  
We find them exemplified in the American officers, as well as in all other men. At the commencement of the dispute—in the first effusions of their zeal, and looking upon the service to be only temporary, they entered into it, without paying any regard to pecuniary, or selfish considerations. But finding its duration to be much longer, than they at first suspected, and that, instead of deriving any advantage f⟨rom⟩ the hardships and dangers, to which they were exposed, they on the contrary, were losers by their patriotism, and fell far short even of a competency to supply their wants, they have gradually abated in their ardor; and with many, an intire disinclination to the service under its present circumstances, ha⟨s⟩ taken place. To this, in an eminent degree, must be ascribed the frequent resignations, dayly happening, and the more frequent importunities for permission to resign, and from some officers of the greatest merit. To this also may we ascribe the apathy, inattention and neglect of duty, which pervade all ranks, and which will necessarily continue and increase, while an officer, instead of gaining any thing, is impoverished by his commission; and conceives he is conferring not receiving a favor, in holding it. There can be no sufficient tie upon men, possessing such sentiments. Nor can any method be adopted to oblige those, to a punctual discharge of duty, who are indifferent about their continuance in the service, and are often seeking a pretext to disengage themselves from it. Punishment, in this case, will be unavailing; but when an officer’s commission is made valuable to him, and he fears to lose it, you may then exact obedience from him.  
  
It is not indeed consistent with reason, or justice, to expect, that one set of men should make a sacrifice of property; domestic ease and happiness—encounter the rigors of the field—the perils and vicissitudes of war, to obtain those blessings, which every citizen will enjoy, in common with them, without some adequate compensation. It must also be a comfortless reflection to any man, that after he may have contributed to securing the rights of his country, at the risk of his life and the ruin of his fortune, there would be no provision made to prevent himself and family, from sinking into indigence and wretchedness. Besides adopting some methods to make the provision for officers equal to their present exigences, a due regard should be paid to futurity. Nothing, in my opinion, would serve more powerfully to reanimate their languishing zeal; and interest them thoroughly in the service, than a half pay and pensionary establishment. This would not only dispel the apprehension of personal distress, ⟨at⟩ the termination of the war, from having thrown themselves ⟨out⟩ of professions and employments, they might not have it in ⟨their⟩ power to resume; but would in a great degree, releive the painful anticipation, of leaving their widows and orphans, a burthen on the charity of their country, should it be their lot to fall in its defence.  
I am earnest in recommending this measure, because I know it is the general wish and expectation; and that many officers whom, upon every principle, we should wish to retain in the service, are only waiting to see whether something of the kind will, or will not, take place, to be determined in their resolutions, either of staying in, or quitting it immediately; and I urge my sentiments with the greater freedom, because I cannot, and shall not, receive the smallest benefit from the establishment, and can have no other inducement for proposing it, than a full conviction of its utility and propriety.  
I am sensible, the expence will be a capital objection to it; but to this I oppose the necessity—The officers ⟨are⟩ now discontented with their situation; if some generous expedient is not embraced to remove their discontent, so extensive a desertion of the service will ensue, and so much discouragement be cast upon those, who remain, as must wound it in a very essential manner. Every thing, that has this effect, has a tendency, at least, to protract the war; and, though dictated by a well-inten⟨ded⟩ frugality, will, I fear, in the end, prove erroneous œconomy.

OF A HALF-PAY. ESTABLISHMENT,  
  
A ſmall knowledge of human nature will convince us, that, with far -  
the greateſt part of mankind, intereſt is the governing principle; and  
that, almoſt, every man is more or leſs under its influence, Motives of  
public virtue may for a time, or in particular inſtances, actuate men to

dictates and obligations of ſocial duty. 5 ˖

they are not of themſelves ſufficient to produce a perſe-

depravity of human nature on this account—rthe fact is ſo,

We find them exemplified in the American officers, as  
well as in all other men. At the commencement of the  
diſpute; in the firſt effuſions of their zeal, and jooking n  
on the ſervice to be only temporary, they entered into it  
without paying any regard to pecuniary or ſelfiſh conſi ·  
derations ; but finding its duration to be much longer  
&#x27; than they at firſt ſuſpected, and that, inſtead of deriving  
any advantage from the hardſhips and dangers to which -  
they were expoſed, they, on the contrary, were loſers  
by their patriotiſm, and fell far ſhort even of a competen-  
cy to ſupply their wants; they have gradually abated in  
© their ardor ; and with many an entire diſinelinatjion to  
the ſervice, under its preſent circumſtances, has taken place,  
To this, in an eminent degree, inuſt be aſcribed the fre-  
quent reſignations daily happening, and the more fre-  
quent importonities for permiſſion to refign, and from  
ſome officers of the greateſt merit; to this alſo may be af.  
eribed the apathy, inattention and neglect of duty, which  
pervade all ranks, and which will neceſſarily continue
