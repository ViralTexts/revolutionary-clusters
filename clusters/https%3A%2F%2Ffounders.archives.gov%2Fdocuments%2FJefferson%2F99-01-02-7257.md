Sir   
  
Washington Jan. 23. 08.  
  
I have duly recieved your favor of the 18th and am thankful to you for having written it, because it is more agreeable to prevent than to refuse what I do not think myself authorised to comply with. I consider the government of the US. as interdicted by the constitution from intermedling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises. this results not only from the provision that no law shall be made respecting the establishment, or free exercise, of religion, but from that also which reserves to the states the powers not delegated to the US. certainly no power to prescribe any religious exercise, or to assume authority in religious discipline, has been delegated to the general government. it must then rest with the states, as far as it can be in any human authority.   but it is only proposed that I should recommend, not prescribe a day of fasting &amp; prayer. that is that I should indirectly assume to the US. an authority over religious exercises which the constitution has directly precluded them from. it must be meant too that this recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it: not indeed of fine &amp; imprisonment but of some degree of proscription perhaps in public opinion. and does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommendation the less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed? I do not believe it is for the interest of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct it’s exercises, its discipline or its doctrines: nor of the religious societies that the General government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them. fasting &amp; prayer are religious exercises. the enjoining them an act of discipline, every religious society has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises &amp; the objects proper for them according to their own particular tenets. and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the constitution has deposited it.  
I am aware that the practice of my predecessors may be quoted. but I have ever believed that the example of State executives led to the assumption of that authority by the general government, without due examination, which would have discovered that what might be a right in a state government, was a violation of that right when assumed by another. be this as it may every one must act according to the dictates of his own reason, &amp; mine tells me that civil powers alone have been given to the President of the US. and no authority to direct the religious exercises of his constituents.  
I again express my satisfaction that you have been so good as to give me an opportunity of explaining myself in a private letter, in which I could give my reasons more in detail than might have been done in a public answer: and I pray you to accept the assurances of my high esteem &amp; respect.

one, by argument. ‘I consider the government of the United States,’ said he, ‘ as  
interdicted by the constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their  
doctrines, discipline, or exercises.’ This results not only from the provision that  
no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, but from that also,

&quot;Washington, Jan. 2!?, 1608.  
&quot;Sir: I have duly received your favor of the Icth, and  
am thankful to you for having written it, because it is  
more agreeable to prevent than to refuse what I do  
not think myself authorized to comply with. 1 consi­  
der the Government of the U. S. as interdicted by  
the Constitution, from intermeddling with religious  
institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.?  
This results not from the provision that no law shall  
be made respecting the establishment or free exercise  
of religion, hut from tliat also which reserves to the  
States the powers not delegated to the United States.  
Certainly no power t? prescribe any religious exercise,  
or to assume authority in religious discipline, has bee?  
delegated to the General Government. It must then  
rest with the States, as far as it can be in any  
human authority. Hut it is only proposed that  
should recommend, not prescribe, a day of lasting ane  
praver; that is, that I should indirectly assume to the  
United States an authority over relngious exercises,  
which the Constitution has directly precluded them  
from It must be meant, too, that this recommendation  
is to carrv some authority, and be sanctioned by some  
penalty on those who d sregard it; not indeed of fine  
and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription,  
perhaps in public opinion. And does the change in the  
nature of the penalty make the recommendation the  
less a law of conduct for those to whom it is di­  
rected? I do not believe it is for the interest of rc­  
|j.ri..n to invite the civil magistrate to direct its ex­  
excises, its discipline, or its doctrines; nor if reli­  
gions societies, that the General Government should  
be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity  
of time or matter among them. Fasting and prayer  
are religious exercises; the enjoining them an act of dis­  
cipline. Every religious society has a right to deter­  
mine for itself the times for their exercises, and the ob­  
  
ji-cfs proper for them, according totlieirown partiei.lir  
tenets; and this right can never be safer than mi mi ir  
own hand:*, where the Constitution lias deposited it.  
&quot;I am awai&gt;? that the practice of my predecessors mav  
be quoted. But I have ever believed that the example&#x27;  
of State Executive led to the assu option of tint au­  
thority by the General Government, without due ex­  
amination, which would have discovered that what  
might be a right in a State Government, was a viola­  
tion of that right when assumed by another. He this  
as it may, every one must act according to the &lt;???&#x27; -  
tales of his own reason, and mine tells me that civ.l  
powers alone have been given to the President of the  
l&#x27;. S , and no authority to direct the religious exercises  
of his constituents.  
&quot;I a train express my satisfaction that you have been  
so good as to give me an opportunity of explaining my­  
self in a private letter, in which 1 could give my rea­  
sons more in detail than might have been done in a  
public answer; and I pray you to accept the assurances
