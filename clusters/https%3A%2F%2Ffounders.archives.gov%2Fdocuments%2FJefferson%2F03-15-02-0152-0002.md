PUBLIC MEETING,  
						Respecting Slavery.  
						AT a large and respectable Meeting of the Citizens of the State of New-Jersey, held at the State-house in Trenton, the 29th of October, 1819, pursuant to public notice, for the purpose of taking into consideration the subject of SLAVERY in States hereafter to be admitted into the Union.  
						  
						The Honourable Jesse Upson, Vice-President of the State, was appointed Chairman, and Wm. Griffith Esq. Secretary.  
						The Meeting after due consideration and discussion, unanimously adopted the following preamble &amp; resolutions:  
						WHEREAS, the abolition of Slavery in this country, and, most especially, the prevention of the importation of Slaves into it, are not only the anxious and ardent desires of the just and humane citizens of the United States, but in truth, important objects of national policy, happiness and security; And whereas, the early, continued and strenuous efforts of the people of the United States to accomplish these great and interesting objects, have highly exalted their character in the estimation of the world, and must be acceptable to the God and Creator of all mankind—This meeting would view, with unspeakable pain and mortification, any measure adopted by the Federal Legislature, tending to extend and perpetuate Slavery among us; and holding out encouragement and temptation to the dealers in human flesh to continue their infamous trade, in defiance of the laws of the land, and the more sacred will of Heaven—Therefore,  
						Resolved, That in the opinion of this meeting, the permission of Slaves in the new states admitted into the Union, has a direct tendency to perpetuate Slavery in these United States, by extending the sphere of its influence and action; to increase its danger, by spreading that species of population over the land; and to promote and encourage the importation of Slaves, by providing an extensive and growing market for them, in which the demand and competition for the purchase of them, will be such as so greatly to enhance their prices, that evil and avaricious men will be tempted to run all hazards of the violation of our laws, by the prospect of the enormous gains of this horrible traffick.  
						Resolved, That the members of the late Congress who opposed the admission of Slaves into the proposed state of Missouri, have the sincere and respectful thanks of this meeting, for their manly and unanswerable opposition, to a measure fraught with so much mischief and disgrace to our country.  
						Resolved, That the Senators and Representatives of New Jersey in the next Congress, be most earnestly and respectfully solicited to use their utmost means and influence to prevent the introduction of Slavery into Missouri, and every other new state that may hereafter be admitted into the Union.  
						Resolved, That in the opinion of this meeting, the prohibition of Slaves in the new states coming into the Union, is not forbidden by any Article of the Constitution of the United States; but is in full accordance with the principles of the Constitution; and imperiously demanded by the honour and interests of the country.  
						Resolved, That this meeting has a sincere and respectful confidence in the good and virtuous dispositions of the national legislature on the subject of slavery; and, however some of the Members may be compelled by circumstances to submit to it for the present, that they will heartily unite with us in every measure calculated to arrest its progress, and finally, extinguish its existence.  
						Resolved, That Elias Boudinot, Joseph Hopkinson, William Newbold, Rev. Simon Wilmer, James Parker, and Samuel Emlen, be a Committee to correspond with other persons and bodies engaged in supporting the principles of the foregoing resolutions, and to use all lawful and proper means for effecting the object of the same.  
						Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be signed by the Chairman and Secretary, and be published in the Trenton Federalist and True American.   Signed,

ready entered into for the transportation  
of large quantities of salt, from Salina to  
Utica, the present season, on the Canal,  
at 31 cents per cask of 5 bushels. The  
distance between these two places is about  
55 miles, and the expense of transporting  
salt has hitherto been $1 per cask. The

‘The Missouri Question.  
  
PUBLIC MEETING RESPECTING SLAVERY.  
  
At a large and respectable meeting ofthe citizens  
of the state of New-Jersey, held at the state-house  
in Trenton, the 29th of October, 1819, for the pur-  
pose of taking into consideration the subject of sta-  
VERY in states hereafter to be admitted into the

The meeting, after due consideration and discus-  
sion, unanimously adopted the following preamble  
and resolutions:—  
  
Whereas the. adolition of slavery in this country,  
and, most especially, the prevention of the import-  
ation of slaves into it, are not only the anxious and  
ardent desires of the just and humane citizens of  
the United States, but, in truth, important objects  
of national policy, happiness and security; and whe-  
reas the early, continued, and strenuous efforts of  
the people of the United States to accomplish these  
freat and interesting objects, have highly exalted  
their character in the estimation of the world, and  
must be acceptable to the God and Creator of man-  
kind—This meeting would view, with unspeakable  
pain and mortification, any measure adopted by the  
  
federal legisiature, tending to extend and perpetuate  
  
  
  
slavery among us; and holding out encouragement  
  
and temptation to the dealers in human flesh to  
continue their infamous trade, in defiance of the  
laws of the land, and the more sacred will of Heaven  
— Therefore | :  
Resolved, That in the opinion of this meeting the  
permission of slaves in the new states, admitted into  
the union, has a direct tendency to perpetuate sla-  
very in these United States, by extending the  
sphere of its influence and action; to increase its  
danger by spreading that species of population over  
the land; and to promote and encourage the im-  
portation of slaves by providing an extensive and  
growing market for them, in which the demand  
and competition for the purchase of them, will be  
such as so greatly to enhance their price, that evil  
and avaricious men will be tempted to run all ha-  
zards of the violation of our laws, by the prospect  
of the enormous gains of this horrible traffic.  
Resolved, That the members of the late congress  
who opposed the admission of slaves into the pro-  
posed state of Missouri, have the sincere and re-  
spectful thanksof this meeting for their manly and  
unanswerable opposition to a measure fraught with  
so much mischief and disgrace to our country.  
Resolved, ‘That the senators and representatives  
of New-Jersey, in the next congress, be most earn-  
estly and respectfully solicited to use their utmost  
means and influence to prevent the introduction of  
slavery into Missouri, and every other new state  
  
that may be hereafter admitted into the union.  
  
Resolved, Thatin the opinion of this meeting the  
prohibition of slaves in the new states, coming into  
the union, is not forbidden by any article of the  
constitution of the United States; but is in full ac-  
cordance with the principles of the constitution;  
and imperiously demanded by the honor and inte-  
rests of the country.  
  
Htesolved, &#x27;Vhat this meeting has a sincere and re-  
spectful confidence in the good and virtuous dispo-  
sitions of the national legislature on the subject of  
slavery: and that, however some of the members  
may be compelled by circumstances to submit to it  
for the present, they will heartily unite with us in  
every measure calculated to arrest its progress, and,  
finally, extinguish its existence.  
  
Resolved, That Elias Boudinot, Joseph Hopkin-  
son, William Newbold, rey. Simon Wilmur, James  
Parker, and Samuel Emlen, be a couumittee to cor-
