For the National Gazette.  
Much declamation has been indulged against certain characters, who are charged with advocating the pernicious doctrine, that “public debts are public blessings,” and with being friends to a perpetuation of the public debt of the country. Among these characters, if the secretary of the treasury has not been named, he has been pretty plainly alluded to. It is proper to examine what foundation there is for those charges.  
That officer, it is very certain, explicitly maintained, that the funding of the existing debt of the United States would render it a national blessing: And a man has only to travel through the United States with his eyes open, and to observe the invigoration of industry in every branch, to be convinced that the position was well founded. But whether right or wrong, it is quite a different thing from maintaining, as a general proposition, that a public debt is a public blessing: particular and temporary circumstances might render that advantageous at one time, which at another might be hurtful.  
It is known, that prior to the revolution, a great part of the circulation of the country was carried on by paper money; that in consequence of the events of the revolution that resource was in a great measure destroyed, by being discredited, and that the same events had destroyed a large proportion of the monied and mercantile capital of the country, and of personal property generally. It was natural to think, that the chasm created by these circumstances required to be supplied, and a just theory was sufficient to demonstrate, that a funded debt would answer the end.  
To infer, that it would have such an effect, was no more to maintain the general doctrine of “public debts being public blessings,” than the saying, that paper emissions by the authority of government, were useful in the early periods of the country, was the maintaining, that they would be useful in all the future stages of its progress.  
But to put the matter out of all doubt, and to shew how destitute of candor the insinuations against the secretary of the treasury, on this head, have been, I have extracted and shall insert here some passages from three of his reports to the house of representatives; by which it will be seen, that his conduct, as well as his language, have been in uniform opposition to the doctrine charged upon him. The length of these reports, it is probable, have prevented many well disposed persons from being acquainted with their contents; the presumption of which emboldens the calumniators of public characters and measures to make assertions, of the falsehood of which, the mere perusal of official documents would convict them.  
  
Extract from a report of the secretary of the treasury, on the subject of a provision for the public debt, presented the 14th of January, 1790.  
“Persuaded as the secretary is, that the proper funding of the present debt, will render it a national blessing; yet he is so far from acceding to the position, in the latitude in which it is sometimes laid down, that “public debts are public benefits,” a position inviting to prodigality, and liable to a dangerous abuse,—that he ardently wishes to see it incorporated, as a fundamental maxim in the system of public credit of the United States, that the creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of extinguishment. This he regards as the true secret for rendering public credit immortal. And he presumes, that it is difficult to conceive a situation, in which there may not be an adherence to the maxim. At least he feels an unfeigned solicitude, that this may be attempted by the United States, and that they may commence their measures for the establishment of credit with the observance of it.”  
Extract from a report of the secretary of the treasury on manufactures, presented the 5th of December, 1791.  
After using several arguments to illustrate the operation of a funded debt as capital—the secretary concludes thus:—“There are respectable individuals, who, from a just aversion to an accumulation of public debt are unwilling to concede to it any kind of utility, who can discover no good to alleviate the ill with which they suppose it pregnant; who cannot be persuaded, that it ought in any sense to be viewed as an increase of capital, least it should be inferred, that the more debt the more capital, the greater the burthens, the greater the blessings of the community.  
“But it interests the public councils to estimate every object as it truly is; to appreciate how far the good in any measure is compensated by the ill, or the ill by the good; either of them is seldom unmixed.  
“Neither will it follow, that an accumulation of debt is desirable, because a certain degree of it operates as capital. There may be a plethora in the political, as in the natural body; there may be a state of things in which any such artificial capital is unnecessary. The debt too may be swelled to such a size, as that the greatest part of it may cease to be useful as a capital, serving only to pamper the dissipation of idle and dissolute individuals; as that the sums required to pay the interest upon it may become oppressive, and beyond the means which a government can employ, consistently with its tranquility, to raise them; as that the resources of taxation, to face the debt, may have been strained too far to admit of extensions adequate to exigencies, which regard the public safety.  
“Where this critical point is, cannot be pronounced; but it is impossible to believe, that there is not such a point.  
“And as the vicissitudes of nations beget a perpetual tendency to the accumulation of debt, there ought to be in every government a perpetual, anxious and unceasing effort to reduce that, which at any time exists, as fast as shall be practicable, consistently with integrity and good faith.”  
Extract from a report of the secretary of the treasury relative to additional supplies for carrying on the Indian war, presented the 16th of March, 1792.  
“The result of mature reflection is, in the mind of the secretary, a strong conviction that the last of the three expedients, which have been mentioned (that was the raising of the sum required by taxes) is to be preferred to either of the other two.  
“Nothing can more interest the national credit and prosperity, than a constant and systematic attention to husband all the means previously possessed for extinguishing the present debt, and to avoid, as much as possible, the incurring of any new debt.  
“Necessity alone, therefore, can justify the application of any of the public property, other than the annual revenues, to the current service, or the temporary and casual exigencies of the country—or the contracting of an additional debt, by loans, to provide for those exigencies.  
“Great emergencies indeed might exist, in which loans would be indespensible. But the occasions, which will justify them, must be truly of that description.  
“The present is not of such a nature. The sum to be provided is not of magnitude enough to furnish the plea of necessity.  
  
“Taxes are never welcome to a community. They seldom fail to excite uneasy sensations more or less extensive; hence a too strong propensity in the government of nations to anticipate and mortgage the resources of posterity, rather than encounter the inconveniences of a present increase of taxes.  
“But this policy, when not dictated by very peculiar circumstances, is of the worst kind. Its obvious tendency is, by enhancing the permanent burthens of the people, to produce lasting distress, and its natural issue is in national bankruptcy.  
“It will be happy, if the councils of this country, sanctioned by the voice of an enlightened community, shall be able to pursue a different course.”  
Here is an example, added to precept; In pursuit of a doctrine, the opposite of that which is charged upon him, the secretary did not scruple to hazard the popularity of his administration with a class of citizens, who, as a class, have been among the firmest friends of the government, and the warmest approvers of the measures, which have restored public credit. The circumstance indeed has been a weapon dexterously wielded against him by his enemies; who in consequence of the increase of duties proposed have represented him as the oppressor of trade. A certain description of men are for getting out of debt; yet are against all taxes for raising money to pay it off; they are amongst the foremost for carrying on war, and yet will have neither loans nor taxes. They are alike opposed to what creates debt, and to what avoids it.  
In the first case, their meaning is not difficult to be devined; in the last it would puzzle any man, not endowed with the gift of second sight, to find it out, unless it be to quarrel with and pull down every man who will not consent to walk in their leading strings; or to throw all things into confusion.

For the National Gazette.  
MUCH declamation h?.s been indul­  
ged against certain characters, who  
arc charged with advocating the pernicious  
d- &#x27; line, that &quot;public debts are public  
bjeffings,&quot; and with being friends to a per­  
petual on of tlv public debt of the coun­  
try Among these characters, it ihe se­  
cretary of the treasury lias not been na­  
me &#x27;, he has been pretty plainly alluded to.  
It is proper to examine what foundation  
there is for those charges.  
That officer, it is very certain, explicitly  
maintained, that the funding of the exist­  
ing debt of the United States would ren­  
der it a national blefiing: And a man has  
only to travel through the United States  
with his eyes open, and to obfeivethe in­  
vigoration of inditfiry in every branch, to  
be convinced that the pofiiion was well  
founded. But whether righturwrong.it  
is quite a d fferent thing from maintaining,  
as a general proposition, that a public debt  
is a public blelfing : particular and tem  
porary circumstances might render that  
advantageous at one time, which at ano­  
ther might be hurtful.  
It is known, that prior to the revolu  
tion, a great part of the circulation of the  
country was carried on by paper money ;  
that in confcquence of the events of the re­  
rolution that resource was in a great mea­  
fute destroyed, by being discredited, and  
that the fame events had destroyed a large  
proportion of the monied and mercantile  
capital of the country, and of personal  
property generally. It was natural tu  
think, that the ciiafm created by these  
circumstances required to be supplied, and  
a just theory was fufficient to demonflrate,  
that a funded debt would answer the  
end.  
To infer, that it would have fucli an cf  
fe£t, was no more to maintain the genera  
doctrine of &quot; public debts being public  
bleflings,&quot; than the faying, that paper e­  
millions by the authority of government,  
were ufeful in the early periods of the  
country, was the maintaining, that the)  
would be ufeful in all the future stages ol  
its progress.  
But to put the matter out of all doubt  
aud to (hew how destitute of candor the in­  
sinuations against the fi-cretary of the trea  
fury, on this head, have been, I have ex­  
tracted and (ball iiifert here some paflagei  
from three of his reports to the house ol  
representatives ; by which it will be seen,  
that his conduCt, as well as his language,  
have been in uniform opposition to the  
doCtrine cha-ged iipon him. The lengtl  
of these repofts, it is probable, have pre­  
vented many well disposed persons frorr  
being acquainted with their content#; the  
preemption of which emboldens the ca­  
lumniators of public charadters and mea­  
fnres to make assertions, of the falfliood ol  
whic&#x27;&gt;, the mere perusal of official docti­  
nients would coriviCt them.  
ExtraCt from a report of the secretary  
of the treasury, on the subjeCt of a provi­  
sion for the public debt, presented the 14th  
of January, 1790.  
&quot; Persuaded as the secretary is, that the  
proper funding of the present debt, will ren­  
der it a national blefling ; yet he is so fai  
from acceding to the position, in the lati­  
tude in which it is foinetimes laid down,  
tlia- &quot;public debts are public benefits,&quot; a  
position inviting to prodigality, and liable tc  
dangerous abuse,— that he ardently wishes  
to fee it incorporated, as a fundamental max  
im in the fyflem of public credit of the Uni­  
ted States. that the creition of debtJhouL  
always be accompanied with the means of ex­  
tinguishment. This he regards as the trui  
secret for rendering public credit immortal,  
And he pre fumes, that it is difficult tc  
conceive a situation, in which there may  
not be an adherence to the maxim. At  
least he feels an unfeigned jtlidtude, that  
this may be attempted by theUnitedStates,  
and that they may commence their mea  
fures for the tftablifhment of credit with  
the observance of it.&quot;  
Extract from a report of the secretary  
of the treasury on manufactures, prefentec!  
the yth of Decembei, 1791.  
After uiing several arguments to illuf.  
trate the operation of a funded debt as  
capital—the fecrctary concludes thus :   
&quot; There are respeCtable individuals, who,  
from a jufl av, rjion to an accumulation of  
public debt are unwilling to concede to it  
any kind of utility, who can discover no  
good to alleviate the ill with which they  
suppose it pregnant ; who cannot be per­  
suaded, that it ought in any sense to be  
viewed ac au increase of capital, least it  
  
(tiould be inferred, that the rcore debt the  
more capital, the greater the bnrtheni, the  
greater ilie bleflings of the community.&quot;  
&quot; But it intcreds the public councils to  
edimate every object as it truly is; to ap­  
preciate how far the good in any nieafure  
is comjJenfated by the ill, or the ill by the  
good ; either of them infeldom unmixed.&quot;  
&quot; Neither will it follow, that an accumu­  
lation of debt is dcjirab!:, becaule a certain  
degree of it operates as capital. There  
may be a plethora in the political, as in  
the natural body ; there may be a slate of  
things in which any such artificial capital is  
unnecrjfarj. The debt too m&lt;y be swelled  
to such a size, as that the greated part of  
it may cease to be ufeftil as a capital, fcr­  
ving only to pamper tire dilfipation of idle  
and diflblute individuals ; as that the suras  
required to pay the in&#x27;ereli npon it may  
become oppressive, and beyond the means  
which a government can employ, confid­  
ently with its trdnqnili y, to raise them ;  
as that the resources of taxation, to face  
the debt, may have been (trained too fartu  
adn it of extensions adequate to exigen  
cies, which regard the public fafety &quot;  
&quot; Where i his critical point is, cannot bt  
pronounced ; but it is impofiible to be­  
lieve, that there is not such a point.&quot;  
&quot; And as the vicissitudes of nations be­  
get a perpeiual tendency to the accumula­  
tion of debt, there ought to be in every go1  
vernment a perpetual, anxious antl   
effort to reduce that, which at any time exifls  
as fafl as /hall he practicable, confidently wit),  
integrity and good faith.&quot;  
l.xtraft from a report of the secretary  
of the treasury relative to additional sup­  
plies for carrying on the Indian war, pre  
ienteil the 16th of March, 1792.  
&quot; The result of mature rifledtion is, ir  
the mind of the secretary, aitrong convic  
tion that the hill of the three expedients  
which have been mentioned (that was th&lt;  
railing of the sum irquired by taxes) is tc  
be preferred to either of th« other two.&quot;  
&quot; Nothing can more intered the nation  
al credit and prosperity, than a condanl  
and fydematic attention to hujband all tin  
means previously poffeffedfor er.tingui/hing th,  
present debt, and to avoid, as much as poffi  
ble, the incurring of any new debt.&quot;  
&quot; Neceflity alone, therefore, can juftifj  
the application of any of the public pro  
pertv, other than the annual revenues, tc  
the current service, or the temporary, am  
casual exigences of the country—or th:  
contracting of an additional debt, b)  
loans, to provide forthofe exigencies.&quot;  
Great emergencies indeed might exist  
in which loans would be indifpenfible —  
But the occalions, which will juftify them

&quot; The present i 3 not of such a nature  
The sum to be provided is not of magni

Here is exampK added to precept ;  
In putfuit of a dodtrinc, the oppolite oi  
that which is charged upon him, the se­  
cretary did not fc-uple to hazard the po­  
pularity of his adminidration with a class  
of citizens, who, as a class, have been a­  
mong the firmed friends of the govern­  
merit, and the warmed approvers of the  
measures, which have redored public cre­  
dit. The circumstance indeed has been a  
weapon dexterouily wielded againd him  
by his enemies ; who in consequence of  
the increase of duties proposed have repre­  
sented him as the oppred&#x27;or of trade. A  
certain description of men are for getting  
out of debt ; yet are againd all taxes for

amougd the foremolt for carrying 011 war,  
and yet will have neither loans nor taxes.  
They are alike opposed to what creates  
debt, and to what avoids it.  
In the firlt cafe, their meaning is not  
difficult to be divined ; in the lad it would  
puzzle any man, not endowed with the  
of fecoiid fight, to find it out, unless  
  
it be to quarrel with and pull down every  
man who will not consent to walk in their  
leading firings ; or to throw all tilings in­  
to condition. FACT.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES  
  
MUCH declamation has been indulged against  
certain charters, who are charged with  
advocating the pernicious doctrine that u pub­  
lic debt} are public blcjfings,&quot; and with being friends  
to a perpetuation of the public debt of tlie coun­  
try. Ampng these characters, if the Secretary  
of the Treasury has not been named, he has  
been pretty plainly alluded to. It is proper to  
examine what foundation there is for those  
  
charges.  
  
Tiiat pfficer, it is very qertain explicitly  
maintained, that the funding of the existing  
debt of the United States would render it a  
national blessing.—And a man has only to tra­  
vel through the United States, with his eves  
open, and to oblervc the ii; v igoratlon of indus­  
try in ©very branch, to be co iv&#x27;nced, that the  
portion was well founded.,— wlether right  
or wrotK, it is quite a d.ierent thing from  
maintaining, as a general proposition, that a  
public debt is a public blefTji •— .and  
temporary ci &#x27;uinft mces might render that ad­  
van u.;&gt;e,nn, at one time, which at another  
might be urtfuL  
  
It is known, that prior to the revolution, a  
great part of tie circulation of the country was  
carried on by paper money ; that in confe­  
quencc of the events of the revolution, that re­  
fonrce was, in a great measure, destroyed, by  
being discredited, and that the fame events had  
d-ftroyed a large proportion of the monjed and  
mercantile capital of the country, and of per­  
sonal property generally. It was natural to  
think, that the chasm created by these circum­  
ltauces requiied to be supplied ; and a just the-  
  
Saturday, September 15. 1792.  
  
orv was fuffiqent to demonstrate, that a funded  
debt would ar.twer the end.  
  
To infer, that it would have such an efFect  
was no more to maintain the general doctrine of  
44 public debts being public benefitsthan the fay­  
ing, that paper emiifions, by the authority of  
government, were ufeful in the early periods of  
the country, was the maintaining, that they  
would be ufeful in all the future stages of its  
progress.  
  
But to put the matter out of all doubt, and  
to fliew how de£titute of caftdor the insinuations  
against the Secretary of the Treasury, on this  
head, have been, I have extracted, and ilia.ll  
insert here some paffaees from three of his re­  
ports to the Ho life of Representatives; by which  
it will be seen, that his conduct as well as his;  
language have been in uniform opposition to  
the dodtrine charged upon him. The length  
of these reports, it is probable have prevented  
many well disposed persons from being acquaint­  
ed with their contents ; the prelum ption of  
which emboldens the calumniators of public  
chara&amp;ers and measures to make airertions, of  
the faliehood of which, the mere perusal of of-:  
ficial documents would convict them.  
  
Extract from a report of the Secretary of the  
Treasury on the fubjeft of a provision for the  
  
public debt, presented the 14th of Jan. 1790.  
  
ii Persuaded as the Secretary isy that the proper  
funding of the present debt, will render it a national  
bleffng ; yet he is so far from acceding to the portion,  
in the latitude in which it is sometimes laid down, that  
•&#x27; public debts are public benefits,&quot; a position inviting  
to prodigality, and liable*to a dangerous abuse,—  
that he ardently wishes to fee it incorporated, as a  
fundamental maxim, in the lyilein of public crcdit  
of the United States, that the creation of debt (houid  
always be accompanied with the means of extin­  
guishment. This he regatds as the true ferret for  
rendering public ciedit immortal.—And he pre-  
Jnm.es that it ts difficult to conceive actuation, in which  
there may not be an adherence to the maxim. At leafl  
he feels an unfeigned solicitude, that this may be at­  
tempted by the United States, and that they may com­  
mence their meaj&#x27;ures for the eflablipiment of credit,  
with the observance of it.&quot;  
  
Extract fiorn a leport of the Secretary of the Trea­  
sury on Manufa6lures, presented the sth of De­  
cember, 1791.  
  
After using several arguments to illustrate the  
operation of a funded debt as capita!, the Secretary  
concludcs thus : &quot; There are refpedable indivi­  
duals&#x27;, who,front a just aversion to an accumulation  
of public debt, are unwilling to concede to it any kind of  
utility. wKo can djcern no good to alleviate the ill with  
which they Juppofe it pregnant ; who cannot be pcrfua­  
dedy that it ought in any fenje to be viewed as an en­  
creafe of capital, lejl it jhou/d be inferred, that the more  
debt the more capita!, the greater the burthens the great­  
er theblrffings of the community).  
44 But it inter efts the public councils to eflimate eve­  
ry objetl as it truly is, to appreciate how Jar the good  
in any measure is compenjated by the ill, or tile ill by  
I the good, either of them is f Idom unmixed.  
&#x27;* A&#x27;either will it folow, that an accumulation  
of debt is desirable, because a certain degree of it  
operates as capital. There may be a plethora in the  
political, as in the natural body ; there may be a Hate  
of tilings in which any such artificial capital is un­  
neceflary. The debt too may befwelled to such a size,  
as that the greatejl part oj it may cease to be ufejul as  
a capital, Jerving only to pamper the dissipation oj idle  
and uijjolute individuals ; as that the Ju/ns required to  
pay the interejl upon ii may become oppreJJivey and be­  
yond the means which a government can employ, con­  
fidently with its tranquility to raise them ; as that the  
rejources oj taxation, to face the debt, may have been  
Jlrained too far to admit oj extensions adequate to ex­  
igencies , which regard the public fafety.  
44 IV here this critical point is, cannot be pronounced;  
but it is impossible to believe, that there is not such a  
  
point.  
  
&quot; Andas the viefffiiudei of nations beget a perpetual  
tendency to the accumulation oj debt, there ought to be  
in every government a perpetual, anxious and un­  
ceafingettoit to reduce that, which at any time  
exiits, as fact as (hall be pra&amp;icable, confidently  
with integrity and good faith.&quot;  
  
Extra# from a report of the Secretary of the Trea­  
sury, relat ve to additional lupplies for carrying  
on the Indian War, presented the i6ch of March.  
  
J792  
  
&quot; Ihe result of mature refleflion is, in the mind of  
the Secretary, a jiiong conviction, that the lafl of the  
three expedients, which have been mentioned [that was  
the raising ot the sum required by taxis] is to be  
preferred to cither of the other two.  
  
&quot; Nothing can moie ivttreft the national credit and  
profperit)■, than a conflant and fflematic attention to  
buibaml 4i.1l ihe means previously polTeflVd tor ex­  
tinguishing the prclVntdcbt, andio avoid, as much  
as pofliblr, the incurring of any new debt.  
  
&quot; Necefjity alone therejorc can jufify the application  
of&#x27;any of the public property, other than the annual re­  
venues, to the current fetvice, or the temporary and  
casual exigencies oj the country- or the contracting of  
an additional debt, by loans, to provide for those exi-  
  
gencies.  
  
&quot; Great emergencies indeed might exifi\ in which  
loans &quot;would be indjpenfable. But the occasions which  
will jujlijy them mvft be truly of that description.  
44 Ihe prejent is not offucha nature ; the sum to he  
provided is net oj magnitude enough to furnifk the plea  
of nccf/ity.  
  
&quot; faxes are never welcome to a. community ; they  
seldom fail to excite tineafy fenfitiom more or less ex­  
tenfive—Hence a too frovg propensity, in the govern­  
ment of nations, to anticipate and mortgage therefour­  
ccs oj poferity, rather t/.an encounter the inconvenien­  
ces of a prejent increase of taxes.  
  
121  
  
&quot; But this policy, when not di&amp;atcd by *ery  
peculiar circumstances, is of the worit kind—its  
obvious tendency is, by enhancing the permanent bur­  
thens of the people, to produce Ufiing dijlrefs, arid ?ts  
natural ijjue is in national bankruptcy.  
4k Ji will be happy, if the councils of this coun­  
try, fanftioned by the voice of an enlightened  
community, ihall be able to purlue a diticrent  
  
COU&#x27; fe.&quot;  
  
liere is example added to precept—in pur­  
suit of a doctrine, the oppolite of that which  
is charged upon him—the Secretary did not  
scruple to hazard the popularity of his adminis­  
tration with a class of citizens, who, as a class,  
have been among the firmed: friends of the go­  
vernment, and the warmest approvers of the  
measures, which have restored public credit.  
—The circumstance indeed has been a weapon  
dexterously wielded against him by his enemies,  
who in consequence of the increase of duties  
proposed have represented him as the oppreflor  
of trade. A certain description of men are for  
getting out of debt; yet are against all taxes  
for railing money to pay it off. They are a­  
mongst the foremoft for carrying on war, and  
yet will have neither leans nor taxes.—They  
are alike opposed to what creates debt, and to  
what avoids it.  
  
In the iirft cafe, their meaning is not difficult  
to be divined—in the last it would puzzle any  
man not dndued with the gift of second light  
to find it out—unless it be to quarrel with and  
ptitl down every man who will not content to  
walk in their leading firings ; or to throw all  
thiugs into confufion. FACT.

ways be accompanied with the means of ex­
