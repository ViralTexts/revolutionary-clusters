The analogy of the stipulation in the 10th article with stipulations in our other treaties and in the treaties between other Nations is the remaining topic of discussion. After this, attention will be paid to such observations by way of objection to the article as may not have been before expressly or virtually answered.  
The 20th. article of our treaty of Amity and Commerce with France is in these words “For the better promoting of commerce on both sides it is agreed, that if a war shall break out between the said two Nations, six months after the proclamation of War shall be allowed to the Merchants in the cities and towns where they live for selling and transporting their goods and merchandizes, and if any thing be taken from them or any injury be done them within that term by either party or the people or subjects of either full satisfaction shall be made for the same.”  
The 18th article of our Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the Netherlands is in these words “For the better promoting of Commerce on both sides, it is agreed, that if a war should break out between their High Mightinesses the States General of the United Netherlands and the United States of America, there shall always be granted to the subjects on each side the term of Nine Months after the date of the rupture, or the proclamation of War, to the end that they may retire with their effects and transport them where they please, which it shall be lawful for them to do, as well as to sell or transport their effects and goods, in all freedom and without any hindrance, and without being able to proceed, during the said term of Nine Months to any arrest of their effects much less of their persons; on the contrary there shall be given them for their vessels and their effects which they would carry away passports and safe conducts for the nearest ports of their respective countries and for the time necessary for the voyage.”  
The 22d article of our Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Sweden is in these words “In order to favour Commerce on both sides as much as possible, it is agreed that in case War should break out between the two nations, the term of nine months after the declaration of War shall be allowed to the Merchants and subjects respectively on one side and the other, in order that they may withdraw with their effects and moveables, which they shall be at liberty to carry off or to sell where they please without the least obstacle; nor shall any seize their effects and much less their persons during the said nine months; but on the contrary passports which shall be valid for a time necessary for their return shall be given them for their vessels and the effects which they shall be willing to carry with them. And if any thing is taken from them or any injury is done to them by one of the parties their people &amp; subjects, during the term above prescribed, full and entire satisfaction shall be made to them on that account.”  
  
The 23 article of our Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Prussia contains this provision “If war should arise between the two contracting parties, the merchants of either country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain nine months to collect their Debts and settle their affairs, and may depart freely carrying off all their effects without molestation or hindrance.”  
These articles of four and the only commercial Treaties we had with foreign powers, prior to the pending Treaty with Great Britain, though differing in terms agree in substance; except as to time which varies from six to nine months. And they clearly amount to this, that upon the breaking out of a War between the contracting parties in each case, there shall be for a term of six or nine months full protection and security to the persons and property of the subjects of one which are then in the territories of the other; with liberty to collect their debts  
  
The term “debts” is only expressed in the Prussian Treaty but there are in the other treaties terms which include debts and this is the manifest spirit &amp; intent of all.  
  
to sell their goods and merchandizes and to remove with their effects to their own country. For this term of six or nine months, there is a complete suspension of the pretended right to confiscate or sequester, giving and being designed to give an opportunity to withdraw the whole property which the subjects or citizens of the one party have in the country of the other.  
The differences between these stipulations and that in the article under examination are chiefly these. The latter is confined to debts property in the public funds, and in public &amp; private banks, without any limitation of the duration of the protection. The former comprehend, besides, goods and merchandizes, with a limitation of the protection to a term of six or nine months, but with the intent and supposition that the term allowed may and will be adequate to intire security. The principle therefore of all the stipulations is the same. Each aims at putting the persons and property of the subjects of one enemy, especially Merchants, being within the country of the other enemy at the commencement of a war, out of the reach of confiscation or sequestration.  
The persons, whose names are to our other treaties, on the part of the UStates, are Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, Arthur Lee, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. The three first are to the Treaty with France. Mr. Adams is singly to that with the United Netherlands, Doctor Franklin singly to that with Sweden, and these two with Mr. Jefferson are jointly to that with Prussia. The treaty with Sweden was concluded in April 1783 that with Prussia in August 1785. These dates repel the idea that considerations of policy relative to the war might have operated in the case.  
We have consequently the sanction of all these characters to the principle, which governed the stipulation entered into by Mr. Jay, and not only from the ratification of the former treaties at different periods distant from each other by different descriptions of men in our public councils, but also from there never having been heard in the community, a lisp of murmurs against the stipulations, through a period of seventeen years counting from the date of the Treaty with France there is just ground to infer a coincidence of the public opinion of the Country.  
I verily believe that if in the year 1783 a Treaty had been made with England containing an article similar to the 10th in the present Treaty, it would have met with general acquiescence. The spirit of party had not then predisposed mens minds to estimate the propriety of a measure, according to the agent, rather than according to its real fitness and quality. What would then have been applauded as wise liberal equitable and expedient is now in more instances than one, under the pestilential influence of that baleful spirit condemned as improvident impolitic and dangerous.  
Our Treaty with Prussia, the 23 article of which has been cited, is indeed a model of liberality, which for the principles it contains does honor to the parties, and has been in this country a subject of deserved and unqualified admiration. It contradicts, as if studiously, those principles of restriction and exclusion, which are the foundations of the mercantile and navigating system of Europe. It grants perfect freedom of conscience and worship to the respective subjects and citizens, with no other restraint than that they shall not insult the religion of others. Adopting the rule that free ships shall make free goods, it extends the protection to the persons as well as the goods of enemies. Enumerating as contraband only “arms amunition and military stores” it even provides that contraband articles shall not be confiscated but may be taken on the condition of paying for them. It provides against embargoes of vessels and effects. It expressly exempts women children scholars of every faculty, cultivators of the earth, artizans manufacture[r]s and fishermen unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns villages and places, and in general all others whose occupations are for the common subsistence and benefit of mankind—their houses fields and goods, from molestation in their persons and employments and from burning wasting and destruction, in time of war; and stipulates payment at a reasonable price for what may be necessarily taken from them for military use. It likewise protects from seizure and confiscation in time of war vessels employed in trade, and inhibits the granting commissions to private armed vessels empowering them to take or destroy such trading vessels or to interrupt their commerce. And it makes a variety of excellent provisions to secure to prisoners of War a humane treatment.  
These particulars are stated as evidence of the temper of the day, and of a policy which then prevailed to bottom our system with regard to foreign nations upon those grounds of moderation and equity, by which reason religion and philosophy had tempered the harsh maxims of more early times. It is painful to observe an effort to make the public opinion in the respect retrograde, and to infect our Councils with a spirit contrary to these salutary advances towards improvement in true civilization and humanity.  
If we pass from our own Treaties to those between other Nations, we find that the provisions which have been extracted from ours have very nearly become formulas in the Conventions of Europe. As samples of this may be consulted the following articles of Treaties between Great Britain &amp; other powers (to wit) the XVIII article of a Treaty of Peace &amp; Commerce with Portugal in 1642 the XXXVI article of a Treaty of Peace Commerce and Alliance with Spain in 1667 the XIX article of a Treaty of Peace and the II of a Treaty of Commerce with France both in 1713 and the XII article of a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Russia in 1766.  
The article with Portugal provides that if difficulties and doubts shall arise between the two Nations, which give reason to apprehend the interruption of Commerce public notice shall be given of it to the subjects of both sides, and after that notice, two years shall be allowed to carry away their merchandizes and goods, and in the mean time there shall be no injury or prejudice done to any persons or goods on either side.  
The articles with France, in addition to the provisions common in other cases, particularly stipulate that during the term of the protection (six months) “the subjects on each side shall enjoy good and speedy justice, so that during the said space of six months, they may be able to recover their goods and effects, entrusted as well to the public as to private persons.”  
The article with Russia, besides stipulating an exemption from confiscation for one year with the privilege to remove and carry away in safety, provides additionally that the subjects of each party “shall be further permitted either at or before their departure to consign the effects, which they shall not as yet have disposed of, as well as the debts that shall be due to them to such persons as they shall think proper, in order to dispose of them according to their desire &amp; for their benefit—which debts, the Debtors shall be obliged to pay in the same manner as if no such rupture had happened.”  
All these articles are with those in our treaties analogous in principle, as heretofore particularly explained, to the tenth article of the Treaty under discussion. That of the British Treaty with France designates expressly debts due from the Public as well as those due from private persons—that with Russia goes the full length of our tenth article; empowering the creditors on each side to assign the debts which they are not able to collect within the term of their residence to whomsoever they think fit for their own benefit, and declaring that these debts shall be paid to the Assignees in the same manner as if no rupture had happened.  
There is a document extant which may fairly be supposed to express the sense of the Government of France at the period to which [it] relates of the foundation of these stipulations. It is a memorial of Mr. Bussy Minister from the Court of France to that of London for negotiating peace dated in the year 1761 and contains these passages “As it is impracticable for two princes who make war with each other to agree between them which is the aggressor in regard to the other,  
  
Note *Thus we find it the sentiment of this Minister that it is impossible for two princes who make war with each other, to agree which is the aggressor with regard to the other—and yet Mr. Jay was to extort from Great Britain an acknowlegement, that she was the aggressor with regard to us, and was guilty of pusyllanimity in waving that question.  
  
Equity and Humanity have dictated these precautions, that where an unforeseen rupture happens suddenly and without any previous declaration, foreign vessels, which navigating under the security of peace and of treaties happen, at the time of the rupture, to be in either of the respective ports shall have time and full liberty to withdraw themselves.”  
“This wise provision, so agreeable to the rules of good faith, constitutes a part of the law of Nations; and the article of the Treaty which sanctifies these precautions, ought to be faithfully executed notwithstanding the breach of the other articles of the Treaty, which is the natural consequence of the War.”  
“The Courts of France &amp; Great Britain used this salutary precaution in the Treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle.”  
  
These passages place the security stipulated in the Treaties for the persons and property of the subjects of one party found in the Country of another at the beginning of a War upon the footing of its constituting a part of the law of Nations; which may be considered as a formal diplomatic recognition of the principle for which I contend. As this position was not itself in dispute between the two Governments, but merely a collateral inference from it, applicable to vessels taken at sea prior to a declaration of War, it may be regarded as a respectable testimony of the law of Nations on the principal point.  
If the law of Nations confers this exemption from seizure upon vessels, which at the time of the rupture happen to be in the respective ports of the belligerent parties, it is evident that it must equally extend its protection to debts contracted in a course of lawful Trade. Vessels are particularly mentioned because the discussion turned upon vessels seized at sea. But the reference to the Treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle shews that the Minister in his observation had in view the whole subject matter of the articles of those treaties, which provide for the security of Merchants and their effects in the event of War.  
This conformity, in principle, of the article, under examination with the provisions in so many Treaties of our own and of other Nations, taken in connection with the comment of Mr. Bussy, brings a very powerful support to the article. It is additional and full evidence that our Envoy in agreeing to it did not go upon new and untrodden ground, that on the contrary he was in a beaten tract, that in pursuing the dictate of reason and the better opinion of Writers as to the rule of the law of Nations respecting the point, he was at the same time pursuing the examples of all the other Treaties we had ourselves made and of many of those of other Countries.  
It is now incumbent upon me to perform my promise of replying to such objections to the Article as may remain unanswered by the preceding remarks. It is with pleasure, I note, that the field is very narrow—that indeed there scarcely remains any thing which is not so frivolous and impotent as almost to forbid a serious replication. It will therefore be my aim to be brief.  
  
It is said there is only an apparent reciprocity in the article, millions being due on our side and little or nothing on the other.  
The answer to this is, that no right being relinguished on either side—no privilege granted—the stipulation amounting only to a recognition of a rule of the law of Nations—to a promise to abstain from injustice &amp; breach of faith—there is no room for an argument about reciprocity—further than to require that the promise should be mutual, as is the case. This is the only equivalent which the nature of the subject demands or permits. It would be dishonorable to expect a boon merely for an engagement to fulfil a moral obligation.  
But it has been shewn, that the stipulation will be beneficial to us by the confidence which it will give on the other side; obviating and avoiding the obstructions to trade, the injuries to and incumbrances upon Credit naturally incident to the distrust and apprehension, which after the question had been once moved, were to be expected. Here if a compensation were required there is one. Let me add as a truth which perhaps has no exception that in the wise order of Providence Nations in a temporal sense may safely trust the maxim that the observance of Justice carries with it its own and a full reward.  
It is also said that having bound ourselves by Treaty we shall hereafter lose the credit of moderation which would attend a forbearance to exercise the right. But it having been demonstrated that no such right exists, we only renounce a claim to the negative merit of not committing injustice, and we acquire the positive praise of being willing to renounce explicitly a pretension which might be the instrument of oppression and fraud. It is always honorable to give proof of upright intention.  
It is further said, that under the protection of this stipulation, The King of Great Britain, who has already speculated in our funds  
  
The Assertors would be puzzled to bring proof of the fact.  
  
may engross the whole Capital of the Bank of the U States and thereby secure the uncontrouled direction of it—that he may hold the Stock in the name of his ambassador or of some citizen of the U States, perhaps a Senator, who if of the virtuous twenty,  
  
Those who advised to a Ratification of the Treaty  
  
might be proud of the honor—that thus our citizens in time of peace might experience the mortification of being beholden to British Directors for the accommodations they might want, that in time of War our operations might be cramped at the pleasure of his Majesty and according as he should see fit or not to accommodate our Government with loans &amp; that both in peace and war we may be reduced to the abject condition of having the whole Capital of our national Bank administered by his Britannick Majesty.  
Shall I treat this Rhapsody with seriousness or ridicule?  
The Capital of the Bank of the U States is ten millions of dollars; little short at the present Market Price of [three millions of] pounds Sterling; but from the natural operation of such a demand in raising price ’tis not probable that much less than four Millions Stereling would suffice to complete the monopoly. I have never understood that the private purse of his Britannic Majesty, if it be true as asserted that he has already witnessed a disposition to speculate in our funds (a fact however from which it was natural to infer a more pacific disposition towards us) was so very ample as conveniently to spare an item of such size for a speculation across the Atlantic. But perhaps the national purse will be brought to his aid. As this supposes a parliamentary grant, new taxes and new loans it does not seem to be a very manageable thing, without disclosure of the object; and if disclosed so very unexampled an attempt of a foreign Government would present a case completely out of the reach of all ordinary rules, justifying by the manifest danger to us even war and the confiscation of all that had been purchased. For let it be remembered, that the article does not protect the public property of a foreign Government Prince or State; independent of the observation just made that such a case would be out of the reach of all ordinary rules. It may be added that an attempt of this kind from the force of the pecuniary Capital of G Britain would, as a precedent, threaten and alarm all Nations. Would consequences like these be incurred?  
But let it be supposed that the inclination shall exist and that all difficulties about funds have been surmounted, still to effect the plan there must be in all the stockholders a willingness to sell to the British King or his Agents as well as the will and means on his part to purchase. Here too some impediment might be experienced. There are persons who might choose to keep their property in the shape of Bank Stock, and live upon the income of it, whom price would not readily tempt to part with it. Besides there is an additional obstacle to complete success. The U States are themselves the proprietors of two Millions of the Bank Stock.  
Of two things one—Either the monopoly by his Britannic Majesty would be known (and it would be a pretty arduous task to keep it a secret especially if the Stock was to stand as suggested in the name of his ambassador) or it would be unknown and concealed under unsuspected names. In the former supposition, the observations already made recur—there would be no protection to it from the article—and the extraordinary nature of the case would warrant any thing. Would his Majesty or the Parliament choose to trust so large a property in so perilous a situation?  
If to avoid this the plan should be to keep the operation unknown the most effectual method would be to place the Stock in the names of our own citizens. This it seems would be attended with no difficulty; since even our senators would be ambitious of the honor; and if they should have qualms or fears, others could no doubt be found amongst the numerous sec [re]taries or adherents of Great Britain in our Country—probably some of the patriots would not be inexorable if properly solicited, or in the last resort persons might be sent from Great Britain to acquire naturalization for the express purpose.  
In this supposition too the article would be at least innocent. For its provisions are intirely foreign to the case of stock standing in the names of our own citizens. It neither enlarges nor abriges the power of the Government in this respect.  
Further. How will the article, work the miracle of placing the Bank under the management of British directors? It gives no new rights, no new qualifications.  
The constitution of the Bank (Sections the 5th. and 7th of the Act of Incorporation) has provided with solicitude these important guards against foreign or other sinister influence. I  That none but a citizen of the U States shall be eligible as a Director. II  That none but a stockholder actually resident within the U States shall vote in elections by proxy. III  That one fourth of the Directors, who are to be elected annually, must every year go out of the direction. IV That a Director may at any time be removed &amp; replaced by the Stockholders at a general Meeting. V  That a single share shall give one vote for directors, while any number of shares, in the same person copartnership or body politic, will not give more than thirty votes.  
Hence it is impossible that the Bank can be in the management of British Directors. A British subject is incapable of being a director. It is also next to impossible that an undue British Influence could operate in the choice of Directors out of the number of our own Citizens. The British King, or British subjects out of the U States, could not even have a vote by Attorney in the choice. Schemes of secret monopoly could not be executed because they would be betrayed unless the secret was confined to a small number. A small number, no one of whom could have more than thirty votes, would be easily overruled by the more numerous proprietors of single or small number of shares with the addition of the votes of the U States.  
But here again it is to be remembered that as to combinations with our own citizens, in which they were to be ostensible for any pernicious foreign project, the article under consideration is perfectly nugatory. It can do neither good nor harm, since it merely relates, as to the exemption from confiscation and seizure on our part to the known property of British subjects.  
It follows therefore that the dangers pourtrayed to us from the speculating enterprizes of His Britannic Majesty are the vagaries of an overheated imagination or the contrivances of a spirit of Deception, and that so far as they could be supposed to have the least colour, it turns on circumstances upon which the Treaty can have no influence whatever. In taking pains to expose their futility I have been led principally by the desire of making my fellow Citizens sensible in this instance, as in others, of the extravagances of the opposers of the Treaty.  
One artifice to render the article unacceptable has been to put cases of extreme misconduct on the other side, of flagrant violations of the laws of nations of war of justice and of humanity and to ask whether under such circumstances the confiscation or sequestration of debts would not be justifiable. To this the answer is, that if circumstances so extraordinary should arise as without the Treaty would warrant so extraordinary an act, they will equally warrant it under the Treaty. For cases of this kind are exceptions to all general rules. They would excuse the violation of an express or positive as well as of a tacit or virtual pledge of the public faith which describes the whole difference between the existence &amp; non existence of the Article in question. They resemble those cases of extreme necessity (through excessive hunger for instance) which in the eye of the law of nature will excuse the taking of the property of another, or those cases of extreme abuse of authority in rulers, which amounting unequivocally to tyranny, are admitted to justify forcible resistance to the established authorities. Constitutions of Government laws, Treaties, all give way to extremities of such a description. The point of obligation is to distinguish them with sincerity and not to indulge our passions and our interests in substituting pretended for real cases.  
  
A writer who disgraces by adopting the name of Cicero makes a curious remark by way of objection. He affirms that the article is nugatory because a Treaty is dissolved by the state of War, in which the provision is designed to operate. If this be true, the article is at least harmless, and the trouble of painting it in such terrific colours might have been spared. But it is not true. Reason, writers, the practice of nations all accord in this position that those stipulations which contemplate the state of War—in other words which are designed to operate in case of War preserve their force and obligation when war takes place. To what end else all the stipulations which have been cited from so many Treaties?  
  
Note This Writer is as profligate as he is absurd. Besides imputing to Camillus in general terms a number of things of which he never dreamt, he has the effrontery to forge as a literal quotation from him calling it his own language, &amp; designating by inverted commas, a passage respecting the impressing of seamen which certainly not in terms, nor even in substance upon fair construction, are to be found in any thing he has written.  
  
  
  
Previous to a conclusion, I shall observe barely with a view to accuracy, that the article leaves unprotected all Vessels goods and merchand

ament, or National Honor to blush at the sentence you shall pronounce.  
The articles, which adjust the matters of controversy between the two Countries, all those which are permanent, have now been reviewed. Let me appeal to the consciences of those who have accompanied me in the Review. If these articles were all that composed the Treaty, would it be better that they should exist, or that all the sources of rupture and War with Great Britain should have survived the negotiation to extinguish them and should still subsist in full vigour? If every enlightened and honest man must prefer the former, then let me make another observation &amp; put another question. The remaining articles of the Treaty which constitute its commercial part expire by their own limitation at the end of twelve years. It is in the power of either party consistently with the instrument to terminate them at the expiration of two years after the present war between France &amp; Great Britain. Is it at all probable that they can contain any thing so injurious, considering the short duration which may be assigned to them, as to counterballance the important consideration of preserving peace to this young Country, as to warrant the excessive clamours which have been raised, as to authorise the horrid calumnies which are vented and to justify the systematic efforts which are in operation to convulse our country and to hazard even civil War.

THE analogy of the rtipulation in the ioth  
article, with llipulations in otir other treaties,,and  
in the trcatiei between oilier nations, is the Kmain­  
ing topic of difcuflion. After this, attention will  
f be paid to such obfervationj, by way of obje&amp;ion  
to the article, ai may m&gt;t Have been before express­  
ly or virtually answered.  
The loth ankle of our treaty of amity and com­  
merce wi;K Frauccj is in these words :  
•• For .the better promoting of commerce on  
both fides, it is agreed, that if a warrlhall break  
au: between the said two natians, fix months al­  
ter the proclamation of war, (hail be allowed to the  
nlerchantl in the cities and tovkns where they live,  
for felting and traofporting their goods and mcr­  
cliandizesj and if any thing be taken from them,&#x27;  
or any injury t)e done them within that term by  
tither party, or the people or fubjefts of either,  
full fatisfa£tion lhall be made for the fame.&quot;  
The 18th article of our treaty of amity and  
commerce with the United Netherlands, is in these  
words:  
&quot; Eor the better promotirtg of commerce on  
bos h fides, it is agreed, that if a war should br«alt  
out between their high mightinesses, the States  
Genetal of jhe United Netherlands, and the United  
Stares of America, there {hall always be jjranttd  
to th« fabje&amp;son each fide, the term of 9 months,  
after the date of the rupture or the proclamation  
of war, to the end that they may retire with their  
effc&amp;s and transport them where they pk-afe, which  
it shall be lawful for them to de, as weij as to fell  
and transport their effects and goods with all free­  
dom and without any hindrance, a»d without being  
able to proceed, during the said term of 9 months,  
to any arrest of their effe&amp;s, much less of their  
persons } on the contrary, there (hall be given them  
for their veflels and effects which they would carry  
away, paffpoitr and fafe conducts for the nearelt  
ports of their refpeftire countries, and for the time  
necessary for the voyage.&quot;  
The ijd article of our treaty of amity and com.  
merce with Sweden, is in these words :  
&quot; In order to faror commerce on buth fides as  
murh as- poflible, it i 3 agreed, that in cafe war  
/hould break 01K between the two nations, the term  
of nine months alter the declaration of war (hall  
be allowed to the merchants and fubjeits refpe£tive­  
ly on one fide and the other, in order that they  
may withdraw with their effects and moveables,  
&#x27; which&#x27;they lhall be at liberty, to carry off »r to fell&#x27;  
wliere they please, without the lead obltacle—nor  
(hall any seize their effc£ts, and much less their  
persons, during the said nine months ; but on the  
contrary, passports, which (hallbe ralid for a tiwe,  
necessary for their return, (ball be given them for  
their vessels and the effects which they&#x27;(hall be wil­  
ling to carry with them—and, if any thing is taken  
from them, or any injury is done to thens&#x27;by one  
of the parties, their people and fubjedts during  
the term above prefer:&#x27;tjli, full and entire fatisfa£t:-  
on (hall be made tr, ii&#x27;iiuwt-■  
*r±j t««»»ry&lt;Tnrd article of our treaty of amity  
and commence with fruffia, contains&quot; this provi­  
sion :  
■&#x27; If war (liould arise between the two contract*  
ing parties, th&lt; merchants of either coantry, then  
reffding in the other, (hall be allowed to remain  
nine months to collect their debts and fettle their  
affairs, apd may depar.t freely, carrying off all their  
effects without molestation or&#x27;hindrance.&quot;  
These articles of four, and the. only commercial  
treaties we had with foreign powers, prior to the  
pending treaty with Great Britain, though differ­  
ing in terms, in substance ; except as to time  
which varies from fix to nine months. And they  
clearly amount to this, that upon the breaking out  
of a- war between the c&#x27;ontiafting parties in each  
cafe, there lhall be for a term&#x27;of fix r nine months  
full prote£tion jnd security to the persons and pro­  
perty of the fubje&amp;s of one, which arc then in the  
territories of the other, with liberty to collect their  
debts*, to fell their gsods and merchandizes, and  
to remove, with their effetfts, wberefocver they  
please. For this term of fix or nine months there  
is a complete suspension of the pretended right to  
confifcate or fcquelter, giving or being designed to  
give an opportunity to withdraw the whole property  
which the fubjetts &lt;sr citizens of one party have in  
the country of the other.  
The differences between these flipulations and  
that in the article under examination are chiefly  
these . the latter is confined to property in  
the public funds and in public and private banks,  
without any limitation of the duration of the pro  
teftion—The former comprehends, in addition,  
goods and merchandizes, with a limitation of the  
protedtion to a term of fix or nine mont-hs ; but  
with the intent and fappofition that the term al- &#x27;  
lowed may and will be adequate to entire security. 1  
The principle, therefore, of all the llipulations is :  
the fame j each aims at putting the persons and &lt;  
property of the fHbjeds of oRe enemy, especially 1  
merchants, being within the country of the ether 1  
enemy a! tfee commencement of a war, out ef the 1  
reach of confifcation or feqaeftration.  
The persons wltofe names , are to our other trea- (  
ties, on the part of the United States, are Benja­  
min Franklin, Silas Deane, Arthur Lee, John j  
Adams, and Thomas Jcfferfon. The three firft &lt;  
are to the treaty with France—Mr. Adams is singly (  
to that with the United Netherlands—Dr. Frank- &lt;  
lin singly to that with Sweden, and these two, with 1  
Mr. Jefferfen, are jointly to that with Ptuffia   
Ihe treaty with Sweden was concluded in April,- ,  
1783 ; that with Prussia in Aiiguft, 1785. These t  
dates reptl the idea, that confideratiorts of policy, t  
relative to the war, might have operated in the t  
cafe. (  
We have consequently the fanftion of all these 1  
characters to the prinfiiplffji which governed the  
Itipulation entered into by Mr. Jay, and »ot on I  
Iy from the ratification of the fprmei*treaties at  
different periods,* distant from each other, by dif- I  
* The term &quot; debrs,&quot; „ 9n}j exfrefed in the I  
PruJJinn treaty, lut there are in the other treaties ,  
terms -which include debts, end this is the manifeU ft,,- i  
rit and intent of til..   
  
- ferent defection: of wn i« oU, puMtc coumiU,  
but also (rotn theie never having been heard, in the  
community, a lisp or murrhur against the ftipula­  
tioo, through a period o! seventeen years, count*  
, nig from the date of the treaty with France, there  
i is jistl ground to infer a coincidence of the public  
- opinion of the country.  
II I verily believe, that if in th« year 1783, atrea­  
n ty had been made with Englaad, containing an ar­  
. ticle limilar to the lOth in the present treaty, it  
would have met with general acquieicencc.  
1. fpiiitof party had not then pre&#x27;difpofed men* minds  
to cftimafc the propriety of a meafurc according  
11 to thS agent, rather than according to its real fit­  
c ness and quality. What would then have been ap­  
plauded as wife, liberal, equitable and expedient,  
e is now in more inflances than one, under the pes­  
tilential influence of that baleful spirit, condemn­  
- cd as improvident, impolitic and dangerous.  
Our treaty with Pruflia, the 23d article ofwhich  
f has been cited, is indeed a model of liberality,  
which for the principles it coutains, docs honour  
to the parties, and has been in this country a fub­  
-1 jest of deserved and unqualified admiration. It  
t contradi&amp;s, as if studiously, those principles of  
reftriflion and exclusion, which art the foundations  
i of the mercantile and navigating fyftein of Europe.  
1 It grants perfect freedom of conscience and wor­  
s (hip to therefpe&amp;ive fubjedit and citrzeni, with no  
i (Jthet- refbaint than that they (hall not inftilt the re­  
i ligion of others, adopting the rule that free (hip*  
, (hall malts free goods, it extends the protection to  
1 the persons as well as t« the goods of enemies.—  
r Enumerating, asContiaband, only &quot;arms, ammu­  
-1 uition, and military (lores,&quot; it even provides that  
1 contraband article* (hall not be confifcated, but  
. may be taken on the condition of paying for them,  
r It provides again ft embargoes of vessels and effect*.  
, It exprefily exempts women, children, scholars of  
r every faculty, cultivators *f the earth, artisans,  
1 manufacturers, and fifhermen, unarmed and inhab­  
r iting unfortified towns, villages and places, and in  
t general, all others whose occupations are for the  
common fubfiftance and benefit of mankind, their  
houses, fields, and goods, from molestation in their  
, persons and employments, and from burning, waft­  
ing, and dellrudtion, in time of war ; and ftipu­  
-1 lates payment at a reasonable price for what may  
r be necessarily taken from them for military use.—  
! It likewise prote&amp;s from feiznrc and canfifcation,  
1 in time of w*r, vessels employed in trade, and in­  
hibits the granting commifiions to private armed  
r vessels, empowering them to take or destroy ftich  
, trading vessels, or to interrupt their commerce ;  
j and it makes a variety of excellent provifiotis to fe-&gt;  
r cure to prisoners of war, a humane treatment,  
r These particulars are dated as evidence of the  
t temper of the day, and of a policy, which then  
t prevailed, to bottom our system with regard to  
r foreign nations upon those grounds of moderation  
and equity,&#x27; by which reason relip-ion and philofo­  
, phy had tempered maxims of more early  
: times. It is painful to observe an effort to make  
the public opinion, in this refpedt, retrogade, and  
to infect our councils with a spirit contrary to  
- \m&#x27;\&#x27; f — J--- towards improvement in  
■ true civilization and humaurtyi&quot;1-^-- —  
If we pafs.from our own treaties,&#x27;to those be­  
tween other nations, we friid that the provisions,  
■ which have been cxtrafted from ours, have very  
&#x27; nearly become formula* in the Conventions of Eu­  
-1 rope. As examples of this may be confuhed, the  
■ following articles of treaties between Great Bri.&#x27;  
• tain and other powers (to wit) the XVfll. article  
of a treaty of peace and commerce with Portugal,  
1 in 164.2—the XXXVI. article of a treaty of peace  
commerce, and alliance with Spain, in &quot;1667—  
the XIX. article of a treaty of peace, and the 11.  
of a treaty of commerce with France, both in ty 13  
and the XII. article of a treaty of commerce and  
navigation with Ruffu, in 1766.  
1 The articles with Portugal provides, that if dif­  
&gt; ficulties and doubts (hall arifc between the two na­  
• tions, which give reason to apprehend the inter­  
ruption of commerce, public notic of it (hall be  
■ given to the fubjeth on both fides, and after that  
notice, two years (hall be allowed to carry away  
tfie merchandizes and goods, and in the mean time,  
there (hal! be no injury or prejudice done to any  
&#x27; pei (on* or goods on cither fid*.  
The articles with France, in addition to the  
provifien* common in other cafps, particularly stip­  
ulate, that during the term of the pTote&amp;ion (fix  
.months) &quot; the fubjedU on each fide shall enjoy  
good and speedy jilt ice, so that during the said  
space of fix months, they may be able to recover  
their goods and effcfW.entrufted as well to the pub­  
lic, as to private persons.&quot;  
ihe article witn Russia, bsfides (lipulatirrg an  
exemption fiom eonlifeation for one year, with the  
privilege (9 tenmvr and carry away in fafety, pro- |  
vides additionally, that the fubjefts of each party 1  
&quot; shall be furthrr permitted, cither at 01 before 1  
their departure, to confrg* the effedh which they  
fhill not as ret have difpoled of, as well as the j  
debts that shall be dne to them to such persons as ■  
they (hall think proprr, in order to dispose of them .  
according to their deftre and for their ben eft t, which i  
debts, the debtors (hail be obliged to pay in the  
fame manner as if no such rupture bad happen-  
A.; these articles are, with those in our treaties, j  
analagous in principle, as heretofore particularly 1  
explained, to th« loth article of the treaty under j  
discussion. That of the Britiih treaty with France ,  
dtfigijates expressly debts due from the public as  
well as those ducjfrom private persons. That with j  
Rufiia gpes-the full length of our tenth aiticle ; 1  
empowering the creditor* on each fide to aflign j  
the debts, which they are not able to colle&amp; within •  
the teim of their refidtnce to whomfocver they j  
think fit, for their own benefit, and declaring that 1  
these debts (hall he paid to the afijgns in the fame  
manner as if no rupture had happened.  
There is a document extant, which may fair&#x27;y be 1  
tippofed t« cxprefs the sense »f the government of  
I&#x27;ranee, at the period to which it relates, of the  
foundation of these ftipularion*. It is a memorial  
of Mr. Bu(fy, minifler from the Court of France to &#x27;  
that of London, for negotiating peace, dated in  
the year 1701, and contains these pafcges &quot;As  
it is impracticable for two Princes, who rr»ake wai i  
with each uth:vt to be:wetm gjem ivpiii it if,c \
  
&gt;, *XZreJar re &lt;« ike «Ler*_ equity and F,„  
e ruanity have di&amp;atcd tliefe precaution*, ti.at

•* out *n7 Previous declaration, foreign vefTels, wh-ch  
e navigating under the security ofpeact, aitd of ~0 &#x27;  
c ties, happen, a( the time of the rapture, to be in  
either of the refpedive ports, (hall have time and  
i- full liberty to withdraw themselves.  
&quot; Thii wife provision so agreeable to the rules  
t of good faith, ccnjiitute a. part of the law of nations  
e and the article of the treaty, which falsifies these  
s precautions, ought to be faithfully .executed, not.  
J withstanding the breach of the other articles of tl,c  
treaty which is the natural confcquence of tl*e  
i- war.&quot;  
•« The Courts of France and Great Britain used  
this salutary precaution in the treaties of Utrcctr  
and Aix la Chapelle.&quot;  
These presages jjlace the security ftfrulated in  
h the.treaties for the persons and property of .he  
-, fubjea* of one party found in tKe country, of ~n„  
ir ther, at the beginning of a war, upon tint fontW  
- of in tonjlituting apart if tie Jaw of nations, wl.ic&#x27;i  
t 1 iflay be considered as a fotm.il diplomatic rfccogni­  
,f tioH of the principle for which we contend. As  
s this position was not itfelf in dispute between the  
r. two governments, but merely a collateral inference  
from it, applicable to veflcls taken at sea, prior to a  
0 declaration of war, it may be regarded as a rcfpec­  
- table teflimOny of the law of nations on the piinci­  
-1 pal point.  
0 If the law of nations confers this exemption from  
_ fcizure upon vefTels, which, at the time of the rup­  
i- ture, happen to be in the refpethve ports of the­  
,t belligerent parties, it is evident that it must equa!-  
t ly extend its proteflion to debts i.l a  
i. course of lawful trade. Vcfiels are partictilaily  
i. mentioned, because the difcufiion turned upon tef­  
,f fels seized at sea. But the reference to the treaic.  
i, of Utrecht and Aix Ja Chapelle (hews that the mi­  
. nifter, in his observation, had in view the whole  
n fubjeft matter of the articles of those treaties, which  
e provide for the security of merchauts and their ef­  
r fefts in the event of war. \
r This conformity, in principle of the article.un­  
. der examination, with the provisions in so many  
treaties of our own and of other nations, liken in  
f connection with the comment of Mr. Bu/Ty, brings  
- a very powerful support to the article. It is addi­  
, tional and full evidence that our.Envoy, in agree­  
- ing to it, did not go Upon new and untrodden  
1 ground ; that, on the contrary, he was in a beaten  
b track ; that in pursuing the dictates of reason, and  
; the letter opinion of wi iters, as to the rule of the  
law of nations refpefting the point, he was at the  
fame time pursuing the examples of all the other  
e treaties which we had otirfclvcs made, and of many  
i of tfiofe of other countries  
&gt; CAMILLUS.  
(Übr Continued.)  
• Thus we find it the sentiment of this minister,  
J that it is imptfjibit for two Princes who make war  
c with each other, to agree •which it the aggrejfar  
- with regard to the other. And yet Mr. Jay was to  
&#x27; extort from GiCat Britain an acknowledgment that  
1 A, &lt;vai the aggressor with regard to at, and was  
guilty &quot;ot puiilanunity in waving uw^jucAiwi.

vantage from each several stipulation.  
n But it has been fliewn, that the stipulation will  
be beneficial to us, by the confidence which it will  
give on the other fide, wbviatiug and avoiding the  
obftru&amp;ions to trade, the injuries to and incum­  
brances upon credit, naturally incident to the dif­  
e trust and apprehenliou, which after the question had  
been once moved, were to be expefled—Here, if  
a compenfatioti were required, there is one—Let  
&quot; me add as a truth, which perhaps has no exception,  
however uncongenial with the fashionable patriotic  
in the wife ortjei of Providence, na­  
tions in a temporal sense may fafely tr«lt the maxim,  
that the obfervjn.-e of juitice carries withit it«  
s own aud a full reward.  
3 It is also said, that having bound ourselves by  
treaty, we (hall hereafter lose the credit of mode­  
ration which would attend a forbearance to exercise  
the right. But it having demonstrated that  
no such right exills, wc only re;nosnce a claim t»  
the negative merit of not committing injtillice, and  
we acquire the positive praise of exhibiting a wil­  
lingness to r#notince explicitly a pretention which  
C might be the indrument of ogprcfllon and-fraud—  
It is always honourable to give proof of upright  
intention.  
It is further said, that under the pioteiSion of  
r this Ripulatiou the King of Great-Britain, who  
has already /peculated in .cur funds, (the afTertors  
- would be puzzled to bring proof oftl.efaft) may  
cngrof* the whole capital of the bank of the United  
Sta es, and thereby secure the uncoi!tro{jled dircCti­  
non of it—that he may hold the ftpek in name  
of his-ambaflador, or of foir.e citizen of the&#x27;Ui.it­  
ed States, perhaps a Senator, who if of the vn­  
tuoui twenty* might be proud of the honotii —  
that thus our citizens it) time of peace might expe­  
rience the mortification of being beholden to Bri­  
tish Dircftors, sot the accommodations they might  
e want, that in time of war our operations might be  
cramped at the ple-afure of his majesty and accord­  
ing as he (hould fee fit or not to accommodate ou  
_ government with loans—and that both in peace aud  
. war we may be reduced to the ahjeft condition of  
I, havingjhe whole capital of our national bank ad­  
&quot; miniUercd by his Britannic majesty.  
&#x27; Shall f treat this rhapsody with seriousness or  
_ ridicule ?  
The capital of the bank of the, United States is  
ten n &#x27;lions of dollars, little fhorf,/ at the ptefent  
t maiket price, of three millions as pounds Heiling ;  
, but from the natural operation of such s demand  
s in raising price, &#x27;tis not probable .that mtich less  
than four millions ilerling would fuffice to com­  
[ plete the monopoly. I have never understood, that  
. the private purse of his Btitannic majesty, if it be  
true as afltrted, that he has already witn&#x27;efled a re­  
lish for fpeculatibn in our fuads (a fact, however,  
from which i. was natural to infer a more pacific  
difpolition towards us) ivas so very aniole as coa­  
veniently to spare an item of such fize-fora fpecu  
. lati-m across the Atluntie. But perhaps the nati.  
- onal purse will be brought to his aid—As thisfup  
f poses a parliamentary grant, new taxes and new  
: loans, it does not f&lt;-etn to be 3 very miuiagrahle­  
&#x27; thing, without difelofurc of the object, and if dis­  
closed, so very unexampled an attempt of a foreign  
govcir.trunt would present a cafe completely out of  
the reacli of all ordinary rules, jullifying by the  
manifelt danger teu&#x27;s even war and the confifcation  
of til that had been puithafed. For let it be re­  
membered, that the article does hot protest the  
public poverty of a foreign government, piince,&#x27;  
or (lite, independent of the observation jull made,  
» that such a cafe would be witheat the reach us or­  
dinary rules. It may be added, that an attempt  
of this kind, from the force of the pecuniary ca­  
pital of Great Britain, woidd as a precedent threa  
. ten and alarm all natious. W-buld confluences  
like these be incurred ?  
But let it be foppoled, that the inclination (hall  
&quot; exiit and that a!i about funds have been  
surmounted—Still to effect the plan there must be&quot;  
in all the Itockholdets a willingness to fell lo the  
1 B&#x27; itilh King ot his agents, as well as the will and  
means on his patt to purchase. yere, too, some  
, impediments might, be experienced ; There are per­  
foiis who might choose to keep their property in  
the ft&gt;ape of bank (lock, and live upon the incomc  
of it, whom price would not readily tempt to p-;rt  
with if. Besides, there is an additional obUacle to  
complete success &#x27;The Unite&#x27;d States are them­  
selves the proprieteis of two millions of tfie bank  
uock. &gt;  
Of two thiags, one, eithcrthe monopoly of his  
Btitinnic majrlly would be known, (and it would  
b- a pretty arduous talk to keep it 4 secret efpeci  
ally if the stock was to stand as suggested in the  
name of his ambafiadur). or it would be unknown  
and tonrealed nnder unl&#x27;ufpefted names : In the  
former fnppofition, the observations already made  
r&lt;vu-. T e.-c would he no protedior r&lt; j&#x27;t  
&#x27; ThaJ&lt; &quot;dvtjfd tu a Ratijicutttn of the  
j   
  
as tie article ; and the extrarrjimiy »ature of die  
cafe would warrant any thing—Would bis majelly  
or the parliamei t choofc to trufl so large a property  
in so perilous a lku»tiv» ?  
It&#x27; to avoid this, the plan should be to keep the  
•y operation unknown, the most efft&amp;ual method  
would be to place the Slock in the names of our  
&lt;g own citizens. This it fecrcs would be attended  
&#x27;d with no difficulty ; since even our senators would be  
•8 ambitions of the honors and if they Ihould have  
a? 1 qualms ahdjFcau, otheio more compliant could no  
e&#x27; doubt be found amonflthe numerous Secretaries or  
Adherents of Great Britain in our Country : pro­  
-111 bably some of the patiiots would not be inexorable  
if properly solicited. Or in the lad resort peifons.  
micjlit be teitf from Great Britain to apquire nstur­  
slization for the cxprefs purport.  
Ie In this~fuppofition too, the article would be at  
a the lealf innocent. For its piovifions are entirely  
n foreign to the cafe of Stock (landing in the names  
0 of our awn Citizerts. It neither enlarges nor o­  
n briges the power of the Government in this re­  
n fpect.  
l* 1 Further how will the article work the miricle,of  
placing the Bank under the management of Briti/h  
: Direflors It givts no r.e&#x27;w rights, no new quali  
1S si cations.  
n The conlVitntion of the Bank (icftion the sth  
&#x27; 7th ot the aft of Incorporation) has provided with  
fulicitude these iirport&#x27;r.nt guards, agaiiHt foreign  
&quot; or other fUifter i»iHienct&gt;—l. &#x27;\ hat none but aci­  
-11 tizrn of the United States shall be eligible as a idi­  
e rector. 11. That norie but a ftockholdei actually .  
relident within the United States, shall vote in the 1  
- jfhjftions by proxy. 111. That one fourth of the  
J director*, who aie to be defied annually, must ev­  
f ery year go out&#x27;of the direction. IV. That a di- j  
1 redtor may at any time be removed and replaced fey 1  
&gt; the llockholders at a general meeting. V. That a j  
e (ingle share shall give one vote foi&quot; directors while I  
- any number of (hare#, in the fame peifon, co part- 1  
&gt; ncrfhip or body politico-will not give more than i  
• Thirty votes.  
Hence it is impofiible, that the Bank can be in  
f the management of British directors—A British .  
fubjeft being incapable of being a director. It is :  
e also next to impossible that an undue Biitith influ- ]  
t ence could operate in the choice of direfters, out 1  
u o! the number of our own citizens. The British I  
1 King, or British lubjefts Out of the United States, 1  
could not even have a vote by Attorney in the i  
1 choice. Schemes of, secret monopoly could not be I  
- executed, because they would be betrayed, unless 1  
&#x27; the secret was confined to a small number. A small &lt;  
number, no one of whom could have more than &lt;  
f thirty votes, would be easily overruled by the more t  
B numerous proprietors of single or a ftnall number j  
s of&#x27;(hares; with(the addition of the votes of the 1  
Y United States. J  
&#x27; But here again it is to be remembered, ttiai &lt;■• &lt;  
• to combination with our own citizens, in which 1  
&lt;■&#x27; they were to be ostensible, for any pernicious for­  
- eign projedl—the article under consideration is pei- 1  
- feftly -ngatory—lt can do neither good nor harm, 1  
- .since it merely iclates, as to the exemption from t  
- confirmation and seizure on our part, to the known t  
property of British fubjefts. t  
&#x27; It follows, therefore, that the dangers pourtray- t  
« ed to us fn ni the fpeculatiugenterprizes of his Brit  
tannic Majelly are the vagaries of an overheated t  
imagination—or the contrivances of a spirit of d»- 1  
1 ception—and that so far as they could be supposed  
f to have the leall colour, it turns upon circumllanc- -  
- es, upon which the treaty can have no . influence 1  
whatever. In taking pains to expbfe their futility, 1  
r I have been principally led by the desire of maki g &#x27;  
my fellow citizens fcnfible, in this inflance as in  
&#x27; others, of the extravagancies of the oppofcrs of  
t the treat jr. J  
i One aitifice to render the article unaeceptable has r  
1 been to put cases of extreme mifeondtift, on the t  
&#x27; other fide, of flagrant violations of the law of na- e  
tions, of war,of juflice, and,of humanity ; and to  
t a(lc whether under such circumstances tbe confifca­  
tionor fequeflration of debts, would not be juftifi­  
able—To this the answer is, that if circumstances  
. so extraordinary should arise as, without the treaty, &#x27;  
would warrant so extraordinary an they will  
equally warrant it Hnder the treaty. For cases of  
this kind are exceptions to all general rules. They  
• would excuse the violation of aa express, or posi­  
tive, as well as of a tacit or virtual pledge of the i;  
&#x27; public faitlv: which describes the whole difference a  
• between the exigence and pon-exillence of the ar- n  
ticlcin queition. They referable those cases of ex­  
-1 tremeiteceffiiy (thro&#x27; exceflive hunger for inllance) r  
r which in the eye of the law of nafurt will cxcufe d  
the taking of the property of another, or those si  
» cases of extreme abuft of authority of rulers,which a  
amounting unequivocally to tyranny, are admitted t  
to jnllify forcible rt liftance to the established author- c  
i&quot; ities. Constitutions of government, laws, treaties, e  
&gt; all give way to extiemities of fuck a description d  
■ the point of obligation is ta diilinguifli them with b  
firreerity, *and not to indulge &lt; ur pafTtons and iuter­  
• efts in fubjtituting pretended f«r rea&#x27;cafes. v  
A writer, who disgraces by adopting the name 11  
i of Cicero, makes a curious remark by way of ob- &#x27; 5  
jedtion. lie affirms that the article &#x27;is nugatory, vi  
I because a treaty ir dissolved by a date of war, in o  
1 which Hate the provision is designed to operate. If n  
&#x27; this be true, the artiele is at leafl harmless, and the li  
trouble of paiuting it in fueh terrific colour night  
&#x27; ha,[&#x27;e spared. But it is not true. Reafun, y  
wi iters, the practice of *11 nations accord in this r&lt;  
pofi nan, tlut those stipulations, which contemplate ir  
the (late of war, in other words which arc designed m  
to operate in war, preserve their force and Ie

stipulations which contemplate a state of future  
war and make provision for such an exigency, they  
preserve their force and obligation when the rupture  
takes place.&quot;

the general rule In international law is  
that war extinguishes all treaties be­

treaties between two nations that con­

make provisions for it, they must nec­  
essarily remain in force, and no one of  
the contracting parties can declare it

Spain and the United States, however, pro­  
vides that, should a war break out be­

proclamation of the war the right shail be  
allowed the merchants in the cities and

their goods and merchandise; and  
if anything be taken from them

&quot;This clause in the treaty should pro­  
tect American merchants residing in Span­

travelers.  
&quot;Formal declaration of war ought to be
