Its characteristic peculiarities are 1. the mode of its formation, 2. its division of the Supreme powers of  
Govt. between the States in their united capacity, and the States in their individual capacities.  
1. It was formed not by the Governments of the States as the Federal Government, superseded by it was formed;  
nor by a majority of the people of the U. S. as a single Community, in the manner of a consolidated Government.  
It was formed by the States, that is by the people of each State, acting in their highest sovereign capacity  
thro’ conventions representing them in that capacity, in like manner and by the same authority, as the State Constitutions  
were formed; with this characteristic &amp; essential difference that the Constitution of the U. S. being a compact

2. And that it divides the supreme powers of Govt. between the two Governments is seen on the face of it; the  
powers of war &amp; taxation, that is of the sword &amp; the purse, of commerce and of treaties, &amp;ce. vested  
in the Govt. of the U. S. being of as high a character as any of the powers reserved to the State Govts.  
If we advert to the Govt. of the U. S. as created by the Constitution it is found also to be a Govt. in as  
strict a sense of the term, within the sphere of its powers, as the Govts. created by the Constitutions of the States are  
within their respective spheres. It is like them organized into a Legislative, Executive, &amp; Judicial Dept. It has,  
like them, acknowledged cases, in which the powers of those Departments are to operate. And the operation is to be the  
same in both; that is directly on the persons &amp; things submitted to their power. The  
concurrent operation in certain cases is one of the features constituting the peculiarity of the System.  
Between these two Constitutional Govts., the one operating in all the States, the others operating in each

3. The last resort within the purview of the Constn. is the process of amendment provided for by itself, and  
to be executed by the States.  
Whether these provisions taken together be the best that might have been made: and if not, what are the  
improvements that ought to be introduced, are questions altogether distinct from the object presented by your  
communication, which relates to the Constitution as it stands.  
In the event of a failure of all these Constitutional resorts against usurpations and abuses of power and of  
an accumulation thereof rendering passive obedience &amp; non resistance a greater evil, than resistance &amp;  
revolution, there can remain but one resort, the last of all, the appeal from the cancelled obligations of the  
Constitutional compact, to original rights and the law of self-preservation. This is the ultima ratio, under all  
Governments, whether consolidated, confederated, or partaking of both those characters. Nor can it be doubted, that in

It is due to the distinguished names, who have given that construction to the Resolutions and the Report on  
them, to suppose that the meaning of the Legislature though expressed with a discrimination and fulness sufficient  
at the time may have been somewhat obscured by an oblivion, of cotemporary indications and impressions.

If any further lights on the subject could be needed a very strong one is reflected from the answers given to
