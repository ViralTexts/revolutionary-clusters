Gentlemen,  
[New York, 30 May-5 June 1789]  
  
I receive with great sensibility the testimonial, given by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, of the live and unfeigned pleasure experienced by them on my appointment to the first office in the nation.  
Although it will be my endeavor to avoid being elated by the too favorable opinion which your kindness for me may have induced you to express of the importance of my former conduct, and the effect of my future services: yet, conscious of the disinterestedness of my motive it is not necessary for me to conceal the satisfaction I have felt upon finding, that my compliance with the call of my country, and my dependence on the assistance of Heaven to support me in my arduous undertakings, have, so far as I can learn, met the universal approbation of my countrymen.  
While I reiterate the possession of my dependence upon Heaven as the source of all public and private blessings; I will observe that the general prevalence of piety, philanthropy, honesty, industry and œconomy seems, in the ordinary course of human affairs are particularly necessary for advancing and confirming the happiness of our country. While all men within our territories are protected in worshipping the Deity according to the dictates of their consciences; it is rationally to be expected from them in return, that they will be emulous of evincing the sincerity of their profession by the innocence of their lives, and the beneficence of their actions: For no man, who is profligate in his morals, or a bad member of the civil community, can possibly be a true Christian, or a credit to his own religious society.  
I desire you to accept my acknowledgements for your laudable endeavors to render men sober, honest, and good Citizens, and the obedient subjects of a lawful government; as well as for your prayers to Almighty God for his blessing on our common country and the humble instrument, which he has been pleased to make use of in the administration of it’s government.

Although it will be my endeavor to avoid being  
elated, by the too favorable opinion which your  
kindness for me may have induced you to express  
of the importance of my former conducft, and  
the effeift of my future services : Yet, conscious of  
the difinterellednefs of my motives, it is not ne­  
ceflary for me to conceal the latisfacftion I have  
felt upon finding that my compliance with the  
call of my country and my dependence ontheaf­  
ftftance of Heaven to support me in my arduous  
undertakings, have, so far as I can learn, met  
the universal approbation of my countrymen.  
While I reiterate the profeffions of my de­  
pendence upon Heaven as the source of all pub­  
lic and private blessings ; I will observe that the  
general prevalence of piety, philanthropy, ho­  
neily, iuduftryand economy seems, in the ordi­

fary for advancing and confirming the happiness  
of our country.—While all men within our ter­

cording to the dictates of their consciences ; it  
is rationally to be expected from them in return,

For no man who is profligate in his morals or  
a bad member of the civil community, can pos­  
sibly be a true christian or a credit to his own re­  
ligious society.  
I defile you to accept my acknowledgments for

“ Gentlemen, I receive with great sensi¬

Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the  
United States of America, of the lively and  
unfeigned pleasure experienced by them,  
on my appointment to the first office in the  
nation.  
  
&quot;Although it will be my endeavor to  
avoid being elated, by the too favorable  
opinion, which your kindness for me .may  
have induced you to express, of the impor¬  
tance of my former conduct, and the effect  
of my future services ; yet, conscious of the  
disinterestedness of my motives, it is not  
necessary for me to conceal the satisfaction  
I have felt, upon finding that my compli¬  
ance with the coll of my country, and my  
dependence on the assistance of Heaven to  
support me in my arduous undertakings,  
have, so far as I can learn, met the univer¬  
sal approbation of my countrymen.  
  
&quot; While I reiterate the professions of my  
dependence upon Heaven, as the source of  
all public and private blessings; I will ob¬  
serve that the general prevalence of piety,  
philanthropy, honesty, industry, and econ¬  
omy, seems, in the ordinary course of hu¬  
man affairs, particularly necessary for ad¬  
vancing and confirming the happiness of  
our couutry. While all men within our  
territories are protected in worshipping the  
Deity according to the dictates of their con¬  
sciences ; it is rationally to be expected  
from them in return, that they will all be  
emulous of evincing the sincerity of their  
professions, by the innocence of their lives  
and the beneficence of their actions. For  
no man, who is profligate iu his morals, or  
a bod member of the civil community, can  
possibly be a true Christian, or a credit to  
his own religions society.  
  
&quot; I desire you to accept my acknowledg¬  
ments for your laudable endeavors, to ren¬  
der men sober, honest, and good citizens,  
and the obedient subjects of a lawful gov¬  
ernment ; as well as for your prayers to  
Almighty God, for his blessing on our com¬  
mon country, and the humble instrument,  
which he has been pleased to make use oi„
