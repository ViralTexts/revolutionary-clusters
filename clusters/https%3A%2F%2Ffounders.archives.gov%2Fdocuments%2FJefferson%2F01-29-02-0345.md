Dear Sir  
Philadelphia June 17. 1797  
  
The newspapers give so minutely what is passing in Congress that nothing of detail can be wanting for your information. Perhaps however some general view of our situation and prospects since you left us may not be unacceptable. At any rate it will give me an opportunity of recalling myself to your memory, and of evidencing my esteem for you.

and mystery is affected to be observed by the present, which marked the former administration. I had always hoped that the popularity of the late president being once withdrawn from active effect, the natural feelings of the people towards liberty would restore the equilibrium between the Executive and Legislative departments which had been destroyed by the superior weight and effect of that popularity; and that their natural feelings of moral obligation would discountenance the ungrateful predilection of the Executive in favor of Great Britain. But unfortunately the preceding measures had already alienated the nation who was the object of them, had excited reaction from them, and this reaction has on the minds of our citizens an effect which supplies that of the Washington popularity.

n colony. I have been much pleased to see a dawn of change in the spirit of your state. The late elections have indicated something which, at a distance, we do not understand. However, what with the English influence in the lower and the Patroon influence in the upper parts of your state, I presume little is to be hoped. If a prospect could be once opened upon us of the penetration of truth into the Eastern states, if the people there, who are unquestionably republican, could discover that they have been duped into the support of measures calculated to sap the very foundations of republicanism, we might still hope for salvation, and that it would come, as of old, from the East. But will that region ever awake to the true state of things? Can the middle, Southern and Western states hold on till they awake? These are painful and doubtful questions: and if, in assuring me of your health, you can give me a comfortable solution of them, it will relieve a mind devoted to the preservation of our republican government in the true form and spirit in which it was established, but almost oppressed with apprehensions that fraud will at length affect what force could not, and that what with currents and countercurrents, we shall in the end be driven back to the land from which we launched 20. years ago. Indeed, my dear Sir, we have been but as a sturdy fish on the hook of a dexterous angler, who letting us fl

P.S. Since writing the above we recieve a report that the French Directory has proposed a declaration of war against the US. to the Council of antients, who have rejected it. Thus we see two nations, who love one another affectionately brought by the ill temper of their Executive administrations to the very brink of a necessity to embrue their hands in the blood of each other
