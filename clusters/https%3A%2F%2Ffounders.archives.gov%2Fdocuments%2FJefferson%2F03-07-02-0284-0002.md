3 Aug. 1759   
The defence of Eugene Arum on his trial at the York Assizes.  
First, my Lord, the whole tenor of my conduct in life contradicts every particular of this indictment. yet I had never said this, did not my present circumstances extort it from me, and seem to make it necessary. permit me here, my Lord, to call upon malignity itself, so long and cruelly busied in this prosecution, to charge upon me any immorality, of which prejudice was not the author. no, my lord, I concerted no schemes of fraud, projected no violence, injured no man’s person or property. my days were honestly laborious, my nights intensely studious. and I humbly concieve my notice of this, especially at this time, will not be thought impertinent or unseasonable; but at least deserving some attention. because, my lord, that any person, after a temperate use of life, a series of thinking &amp; acting regularly and without one deviation from sobriety, should plunge into the very depth of profligacy precipitately and at once, is altogether improbable &amp; unprecedented, and absolutely inconsistent with the course of things. villainy is always progressive, and declines from right step by step, till every idea of probity is lost, and every sense of moral obligation totally perishes.  
Again, my lord, a suspicion of this kind, which nothing but malevolence could entertain and ignorance propagate, is violently opposed by my very situation at that time with respect to health; for, but a little space before, I had been confined to my bed, and suffered under a very long and severe disorder, and was not able, for half a year together, so much as to walk. the distemper left me indeed; yet slowly &amp; in part; but so emaciated, so enfeebled, that I was reduced to crutches; and was so far from being well about that time I am charged with this fact, that I never to this day have perfectly recovered. could then a person in this condition take any thing into his head so unlikely, so extravagant? I, past the age of vigor of my age, feeble &amp; valetudinary, with no inducement to engage, no ability to accomplish, no weapon wherewith to accomplish perpetrate such a fact, without interest, without power, without motive, without means.  
Besides, it must needs occur to every one that an action of this atrocious nature is never heard of, but, when it’s springs are laid open, it appears that it was to support some indolence, or supply some luxury, to satisfy some avarice, or oblige some malice; prevent some real, or some imaginary want. yet I lay not under the influence of any one of these. surely, my lord, I may, consistent with both truth and modesty affirm thus much; &amp; none who have any veracity, &amp; know me, will ever question this.  
In the second place, the disappearance of Clark is suggested as an argument of his being dead. but the uncertainty of such an inference from that, and the fallibility of all conclusions from such circumstances, are too obvious, &amp; too notorious to require instances. yet, superseding many, permit me to produce a very recent one, and that afforded by this castle.  
			 in June 1757 William Thompson, for all the vigilance of this place, in open day light, and double ironed, made his escape. notwithstanding an immediate enquiry set on foot, the strictest search, and all advertisement,  
			 was never seen nor heard of since. if then Thompson got off unseen, thro’ all these difficulties, how very easy was it for Clark, when none of them opposed him? but what would be thought of a prosecution commenced against any one seen last with Thompson?  
Permit me, my lord, to observe a little upon the bones which have been discovered. it is said, which perhaps is saying very far, that these are the skeleton of a man. it is possible indeed they may: but is there any certain known criterion which incontestably distinguishes the sex in human bones? let it be considered, my lord, whether the ascertaining of this point ought not to precede any attempt to identify them. the place of their depositum too claims much more attention than is commonly bestowed on it: for of all places in the world none could have mentioned any one wherein there was greater certainty of finding human bones, than a hermitage; except he should point out a church yard; hermitages in times past being not only places of religious retirement, but of burial too; and it has scarcely ever been heard of but that every cell now known contains, or contained, these relicks of humanity, some mutilated, and some entire. I do not inform, but give me leave to remind your lordship, that here sat solitary sanctity, and here the hermit or the Anchoress, hoped that repose for their bones when dead, they here enjoyed when living.  
All this while, my lord, I am sensible this is known to your lordship, &amp; many in this court, better than to me. but it seems necessary to my case that others, who have not at all perhaps adverted to things of this nature, and may have concern in my trial, should be made acquainted with it. suffer me then, my lord, to produce a few of many evidences that those cells were used as repositories of the dead, and to enumerate a few in which human bodies have been found, as it happened in this in question; lest to some that accident might seem extraordinary, &amp; consequently occasion prejudice. 1. the bones, as was supposed, of the Saxon saint Dubritius were discovered buried in his cell, at Guy’s cliff near Warwick, as appears from the authority of  
			 Sr William Dugdale.2. the bones that were thought to be those of the Anchoress Rosia were but lately discovered in a cell at Royston, entire, fair &amp; undecayed; tho’ they must have lain interred for several centuries, as is proved by  
			 Doctor Stukely.3. But our own country, nay almost this  
			 neighborhood, supplies another instance. for in January 1747. was found by  
			 mr Stovin, accompanied by a reverend gentleman, the bones, in part, of some recluse in the cell at Lindholm near Hatfield. they were believed to be those of William of Lindholm, a hermit, who had long made this cave his habitation.4. in February 1744. part of Woburn abbey being pulled down, a large portion of a corpse appeared, even with the flesh on, and which bore cutting with a knife; tho’ it is certain this had laid above 200. years, and how much longer is doubtful: for this abbey was founded in 1145. and dissolved in 1538. or 9. what would have been said, what believed, if this had been an accident to the bones in  
			 question?  
Further, my lord, it is not yet out of living memory that a little distance from Knaresborough, in a field part of the manor of the worthy baronet and patriot baronet who does that borough the honor to represent it in parliament, were found, in digging for gravel, not one human skeleton only, but five or six, deposited side by side, with  
			 each an urn placed at it’s head, as your lordship knows was usual in antient interments. about the same time, and in another field almost close to this borough was discovered, also in searching for gravel, another human skeleton. but the piety of the same worthy gentleman ordered both pits to be filled up again, commendably unwilling to disturb the dead. is the  
			 invention of these bones forgotten then, or industriously concealed, that the discovery of those in question may appear the more singular and extraordinary? whereas in fact there is nothing  
			 extraordinary in it. my lord, almost every place conceals such remains. in fields, in hills, in highway sides, in commons, lie frequent and unsuspected bones. and our present allotment of rest  
			 for  
			 the departed is but of some centuries. another particular seems to claim not a little of your  lordship’s notice, and that of the gentlemen of the jury; which is that perhaps no example occurs of more than one skeleton being found in one cell; and in the cell in question was found but  
			 one; agreeable in this to the peculiarity of every known cell in Britain. not the invention of one skeleton then, but of two, would have appeared suspicious &amp; uncommon.  
But then, my lord, to attempt to identify these, when even to identify living men has proved so difficult, as in the case of Perkin Warbeck, &amp;  
			 Lambert Symnal at home, and  
			 Don Sebastian abroad, will be looked upon perhaps as an attempt to determine what is  
			 indeterminable. and I hope too it will not pass unconsidered here, where gentlemen believe with caution, think with  
			 reason, and decide with humanity, what interest the endeavor to do this is calculated to serve in assigning proper personality to these bones, whose particular appropriation can only appear to  
			 eternal omniscience.  
Permit me, my lord, also to remonstrate that as human bones appear to have been the inseparable adjunct of every cell, even any person naming such a place at random as containing them in this case, shews him rather unfortunately prescient, than conscious; and that these attendants on every hermitage accidentally concurred with this conjecture; a mere casual coincidence of words &amp; things.  
But, it seems, another skeleton has been discovered by some laborer which was full as confidently averred to be Clark’s as this. my lord, must some of the living, if it promotes some  
			 interest, be made answerable for all the bones that earth has concealed, or chance exposed? and might not a place where  
			 bones lay be mentioned by a person by chance, as well as found by a laborer by chance? or is it more criminal accidentally to name where bones lie, than accidentally to find where they lie?  
Here too is a human skull produced, which is fractured. but was this the cause, or was it the consequence of death? was it owing to violence, or the effect of natural decay? if it was violence, was that violence before or after death? my lord, in May 1732 the remains of William, Lord archbishop of this province, were taken up by permission in this cathedral, and the bones of the skull were found  
			 broken. yet certainly he died by no violence offered to him alive that could occasion that fracture  
			 there.let it be considered; my lord, that upon the dissolution of religious houses, and the commencement of the reformation, the ravages of those  
			 times both affected the living and the  
			 dead. in  
			 search after imaginary treasures coffins were broken up, graves &amp; vaults dug open, monuments ransacked, and shrines demolished. your lordship knows that these violations proceeded so far as  
			 to  
			 occasion parliamentary authority to restrain them; and it did, about the beginning of the reign of  
			 Q. Elizabeth. I intreat your lordship, suffer not the violence, the depredations, and the iniquities of those times to be  
			 imputed to  
			 this.  
Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant that Knaresborough had a castle, which tho now run to ruin, was once considerable both for it’s strength and garrison? all know it was vigorously besieged by the arms of the parliament. at which siege, in sallies, conflicts, flights, pursuits, many fell in all the places round it, and where  
			 they fell were buried; for every place, my lord, is burial earth in war; and many, questionless, of these rest yet unknown whose bones futurity shall discover.  
I hope, with all imaginable submission, that what has been said will not be thought impertinent to this indictment, and that it will be far from the wisdom, the learning, and the integrity of this place, to impute to the living what zeal in it’s fury may have done, what nature may have taken off, and piety interred; or what war alone may have destroyed, alone deposited.  
  
As to the circumstances that have been racked, I have nothing to observe; but that all circumstances whatsoever are precarious, and have been but too frequentlyfound lamentably fallible. even the strongest have failed. they may rise to the utmost degree of probability; yet are they but probability still. why need I name to your lordship the two Harrisons recorded in Doctor Howel who both suffered upon circumstances, because of the sudden disappearance of their lodger, who was in credit, had contracted debts, borrowed money, and went off unseen, and returned again a great many years after their  
			 execution? why name the intricate affairs of Jacques de Moulin, under  
			 King Charles the second, related by a gentleman who was Counsel of the crown?  
			 and why the unhappy Coleman, who suffered innocently, tho’ convicted upon positive evidence, and whose children perished for want because the world uncharitably believed the father guilty? why mention the perjury of  
			 Smith, incautiously admitted King’s evidence, who, to screen himself, equally accused  
			 Faircloth and  
			 Loveday of the murder of Dun? the first of whom in 1749. was executed at Winchester; and Loveday was about to suffer at Reading had not Smith been proved perjured, to the satisfaction of the court, by the Surgeon of the Gosport hospital?  
Now, my lord, having endeavored to shew that the whole of this process is altogether repugnant to every part of my life; that it is inconsistent with my condition of health about that time; that no rational inference can be drawn that a person is dead, who suddenly disappears; that hermitages were the constant repositories of the bones of the recluse; that the proofs of this are well authenticated; that the revolutions in religion, or the fortune of war, has mangled, or buried the dead; the conclusion remains, perhaps no less reasonably than impatiently wished for. I, last, after a year’s confinement equal to either fortune, put myself upon the candor, the justice, and the humanity of your lordship, and upon yours, my countrymen, gentlemen of the jury.

that of this Honourable Court.  
Firft, My Lord, the whole Tenor of my Con-  
  
  
my preient Circumſtances extort it from me, anc  
| ſeem  
  
C43 1  
  
ſeem to make it neceſſary. Permit me here, m  
  
  
cruelly buſied in this Proſecution, to charge upon  
me any Immorality, of which Prejudice was not  
the Author. No, my Lord, I concerted not  
Schemes of Fraud, projected no Violence, in-  
jured no Man&#x27;s. Perſon or Property. My Days  
were honeſtly laborious, my Nights intenſely  
ſtudious. And, I humbly conceive, my Notice  
of this, eſpecially at this Time, will not be  
thought impertinent, or unſeaſonable; but, at  
leaſt, deſerving ſome Attention: Becauſe, my  
  
Lord, that any Perſon, after a temperate Uſe of  
  
  
and without one ſingle Deviation from Sobræty,  
ſhould plunge into the very Depth of Profligacy,  
precipitately and at once, is altogether impro-  
bable and unprecedented, and abi folute ly incon-  
  
  
never corrupted at once; Villainy i is always pro-  
oreſſive, and declines from Right, Step after  
Step, till every Regard of Probity is loſt, and every  
Senſe of all Moral Obligations totally periſhes.  
Again, my Lord, a Suſpicion of this Ki,  
  
which nothing but Malevolence could entertain,  
and Ignorance propagate, is violeatly oppoſed by  
my very Situation at that Time, with reſpect to  
Health : For, but a little Space betore, I had been  
confined to my Bed, and ſuffered under a very  
long and ſevere Diſorder, and was not able, tor  
half a Year together, ſo much as to walk. The  
Diſtemper left me indeed, yet lowly and in Party  
but ſo macerated, ſo enfcebled, that I was res  
duced to Crutches; and was fo far from being  
well about the Time I am charged with this Fa&amp;;

thing into his Head ſo unlikely, fo extravagant?  
I, paſt the Vigour of my Age, feeble and vale-  
tudinary, with no Inducement to engage, no  
Ability to accompliſh, no Weapon wherewith to  
perpetrate ſuch a Fact; without Intereſt, without  
Power, without Motive, without Means.  
  
Beſides, it muſt needs occur to every one, that  
an Action of this atrocious Nature is never heard  
of, but, when its Springs are laid open, it appears  
that it was to ſupport ſome Indolence, or tupply  
fome Luxury, to fatisfy ſome Avarice, or oblige  
ſome Malice; to prevent ſome real, or ſome ima-  
ginary Want: Yet I lay not under the Influence  
of any one of theſe, Surely, my Lord, I may, con-  
ſiſtent with both Truth and Modeſty, affirm thus  
much; and none who have any Veracity, and  
  
knew me, will ever queſtion this.  
  
In the ſecond Place, the Diſappearance of  
Clark 1s ſuggeſted as an Argument of his being  
dead : But the Uncertainty of fuch an Inference  
from that, and the Fallibility of all Concluſions  
of ſuch a Sort, from ſuch a Circumſtance, are  
too obvious, and too notorious, to require In-  
ſtances : Let, ſuperceding many, permit me ts  
produce a very recent one, and that afforded by  
this Caſtle. |  
  
In June, 1757, William Thompſon, for all the  
Vigilance of this Place, in open Day-light, and  
double-ironed, made his Eſcape; and, notwith-  
ſtanding an immediate Enquiry ſet on Foot, the  
ſtricteſt Search, and all Advertiſements, was ne-  
ver ſeen or heard of ſince. If then Thompſon got  
off unſeen, thro? all theſe Difficulties, how very  
eaſy was it for Clark, when none of them oppoſed  
him? But what would be thought of a Proſe-  
cution commenced againſt any one ſeen laſt with  
  
Thompſon?

Permit me, next, my Lord, to obſerve a little  
upon the Bones which have been diſcovered. It  
is ſaid, which prongs is ſaying very far, that theſe  
are the Skeleton of a Man, *Tis poſſible indeed  
it may: But is there any certain known Cri-  
terion, which inconteſtibly diſtinguiſhes the Sex  
in Human Bones? Let it be conſidered, my  
Lord, whether the aſcertaining of this Point  
ought not to precede any Attempt to identity  
them,  
  
The Place of their Depoſitum too claims  
much more Attention than is commonly beſtow&#x27;d  
upon it: For, of all Places in the World, none  
could have mentioned any one, wherein there was  
greater Certainty of finding Human Bones,  
than a Hermitage; except he ſhould point out a  
Church- yard: Hernutages, in Time paſt, be-  
ing not only Places of Religious Retirement, but  
of Burial too. And it has ſcarce or never been  
heard of, but that every Cell, now known, con-  
tains, or contained, theſe Relicts of Humanity;  
ſome mutilated, and ſome entire. I do not in-  
form, but give me Leave to remind, your Lord-  
ſhip, that here ſat ſolitary Sanctity, and here the  
Hermit, or the Anchoreſs, hoped that Repoſe for  
their Bones, when dead, they here enjoyed when  
living.  
  
All this while, my Lord, I am ſenſible this is  
known to your Lordſhip, and many in this Court,  
better than I. But it ſeems neceſſary to my Caſe  
that others, who have not at all, perhaps, adverted  
to Things of this Nature, and may have Concern  
in my Trial, ſhould be made acquainted with it.  
Suffer me then, my Lord, to produce a few of  
many Evidences, that theſe Cells were uſed as  
Repoſitories of tl. Dead, and to enumerate 2,  
tew, in which Human Bones have been found,

Authority of Sir William Dugdale.  
  
2. The Bones, thought to be thoſe of the An-  
chorels Raſia, were but lately diſcovered in a  
Cell at Royſton, entire, fair, and undecayed,  
though they mult have lain interred for ſeveral  
Centuries, as is proved by Dr. Stußely.  
  
3. But our own County, nay, almoſt this  
Neighbourhood, ſupplies another Inſtance : For,  
in January, 1747, was found, by Mr. Stovin, ac-  
companicd by a Reverend Gentleman, the Bones,  
in Part, of ſome Recluſe, in the Cell at Lind-  
bolm, near Hatfield, They were believed to be  
thoſe of William of Lindbolm, a Hermit, who had  
long mad- this Cave his Habitation.  
  
A. In February, 1744, Part of Weburn Abbey  
being pulled down, a large Portion of a Corpſe  
appeared, even with the Fleſh on,- and which  
bore cutting with a Knife; though it is certain  
this had laid above 200 Years, and how much  
longer js doubtful, for this Abbey was founded  
  
  
What would have been {aid, what believed,  
if this had been an Accident to the Bones in  
Queſtion ?  
  
Farther, my Lord, it is not yet out of living,  
Memory, that a little Diſlance from Knare/brough,  
in a Field, Part of the Manor of the Worthy and  
Patriat Baronet, who docs that Borough the Ho-  
nour to repreſent i it im Parliament, were found, in  
digging for Gravel, not one Juman Skeleton  
on, but five or ſix e Side by Side, with  
  
cach  
  
( 27)  
each an Urn placed at it&#x27;s Head, as your Lord-  
ſhip knows was uſual in antient Interments.  
About the ſame Time, and in another Field,  
almoſt cloſe to this Borough, was diſcovered alſo,  
in ſearching for Gravel, another Human Skele-  
ton; but the Piety of the ſame worthy Gentle-  
man ordered both the Pits to be filled up again,  
commendably unwilling to diſturb the Dead.  
Is the Invention of theſe Bones forgotten, then,  
or induſtriouſly concealed, that the Diſcovery of  
_ thoſe in Queſtion may appear the more ſingular  
and extraordinary? Whereas, in Fact, there is  
nothing extraordinary in it. My Lord, almoſt  
every Place conceals ſuch Remains. In Fields,  
in Hills, in Highway Sides, in Commons, lie fre-  
2 and unſuſpected Bones. And our pre-  
ent Allotments for Reſt for the Departed, is but  
of ſome Centuries. |  
Another Particular ſeems not to claim a little  
of your Lordſhip&#x27;s Notice, and that of the Gen-  
tlemen of the Jury; which is, that perbaps no  
Example occurs of more than one Skeleton bei  
found in one Cell; and in the Cell in Queſtion  
was found but one; agreeable, in this, to the  
Peculiarity of every other knoven Cell in Britain.  
Not the Invention of one Skeleton, then, but of  
two would have appeared ſuſpicious and uncom-  
mon. |  
But then, my Lord, to attempt to indentify  
theſe, when even to indentify living Men ſome-  
times has proved fo difficult, as in the Caſe of  
Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Symnel at home, and  
of Don Sebaſtian abroad, will be looked upon,  
perhaps, as an Attempt to determine what is in-  
determinable. And I hope too it will not paſs  
unconſidered here, where Gentlemen believe  
with Caution, think with Reaſon, and decide  
| D 2 with  
  
( 28 ) |  
with Humanity, what Intereſt the Endeavour to  
do this is calculated to ſerve, in aſſigning proper  
Perſonality to thoſe Bones, whoſe particular Ap-  
propriation can only appear toeternalOmniſcience.  
  
Permit me, my Lord, alſo, very humbly to  
remonſtrate, that, as Human Bones appear to  
have been the inſeparable Adjuncts of every Cell,  
even any Perſon&#x27;s naming ſuch a Place at random  
as containing them, in this Caſe, ſhews him ra-  
ther unfortunate than conſcious preſcient, and  
that theſe Attendants on every Hermitage only  
accidentally concurred with this Conjecture. A  
mere caſual Coincidence of Words and Things.  
| But it ſeems another Skeleton has been diſco-  
| i vered by ſqqne Labourer, which was full as  
4 confidently averred to be Clark&#x27;s as this. My  
„ Lord, muſt ſome of the Living, if it promotes  
5 ſome Intereſt, be made anſwerable for all the  
Bones that Earth has concealed, and Chance  
«| expoſed ? And might not a Place where Bones  
N lay be mentioned by a Perſon by Chance, as  
14 well as found by a Labourer by Chance? Or, is  
it more criminal accidentally to name where Bones  
＋ lic, than accidentally to ind where they lie?  
Here too is a Human Skull produced, which  
. is fractured; but was this the Cauſe, or was it  
| „the Conſequence of Death; was it owing to  
Violence, or was it the Effect of natural Decay? If  
it was Violence, was that Violence before or after  
Death? My Lord, in May, 1732, the Remains  
a { | of Milliam Lord Archbiſhop of this Province were  
f taken up, by Permiſſion, in this Cathedral, and  
1 the Bones of the Skull were found broken; yet  
certainly he died by no Violence offered to him-  
alive, that could occaſion that Fracture there.  
Let it be conſidered, my Lord, that, upon the  
Diſſolution of Religious Houſes, and the Com-  
mencement  
  
( 29 )  
mencement of the Reformation, the Ravages of  
thoſe Times both affected the Living and the  
Dead. In Search after imaginary Treaſures,  
Coffins were broken up, Graves and Vaults dug  
open, Monuments ranſack&#x27;d, and Shrineggde-  
moliſhed ; your Lordſhip knows that theſe Vio-  
lations proceeded ſo far, as to occaſion Parlia-  
mentary Authority to reſtrain them; and it did,  
about the Beginning of the Reign of Queen  
Elizabeth. I entreat your Lordſhip ſuffer not the  
Violences, the Depredations, and the Iniquities  
of thoſe Times, to be imputed to this.  
Moreover, what Gentleman here is ignorant  
that Knaręſbrough had a Caſtle ; which, tho* now  
a Ruin, was once conſiderable both for its  
Strength and Garriſon, All Know it was vigo-  
rouſly beſieged by the Arms of the Parliament:  
At which Siege, in Sallies, Conflicts, Flights,  
Purſuits, many fell in all the Places round it;  
and where they fell were buried: For every  
Place, my Lord, is Burial Earth in War; and  
many, queſtionleſs, of theſe reſt yet unknown,  
whoſe Bones Futurity ſhall diſcover.  
I hope, with all imaginable Submiſſion, that  
. what has been ſaid will not be thought imperti-  
neht to this Indictment ; and that it will be far  
from the Wiſdom, the Learning, and the Inte-  
grity of this Place, to impute to the Living what  
Zeal in its Fury may have done; what Nature  
may have taken off, and Piety interred ; or what  
War alone may have deſtroyed, alone depoſited.  
As to the Circumſtances that have been rak&#x27;d  
  
together, I have nothing to obſerve; but that all  
Circumſtances whatſoever are precarious, and

the Perjury of Smith, incautiouſly admitted

ſtances: Yer, ſuperſeding many, permit me to  
produce a very recent one, and that afforded by  
  
  
In June, 1737, William Thompſon, for all  
  
  
ver  
  
r W909  
  
[25]  
  
  
got off unſeen, through all theſe difficulties, how  
very ealy was it for Clark, when none of them  
oppoſed him ? But what would be thought of a  
proſecution commenced againſt any one ſeen laſt  
with Thompſon ?_ 1 |  
Permit me, next, my lord, to obſerve a little  
upon the bones which have been diſcovered. It  
is ſaid, which perhaps is ſaying very far, that  
theſe are the ſkeleton of a man. It is poſſible  
indeed it may: but is there any certain know  
criterion, which inconteſtibly diſtinguiſnhes the  
ſex in human bones? Let it be conſidered, my  
lord, whether the aſcertaining of this point  
ought not to - precede any attempt to identify  
them. . -  
The place of their depoſitum too claims  
much more attention than is commonly beſtowed  
upon it : for, of all places in the world, none  
could have mentioned any one, wherein there was  
greater certainty of finding human bones, than  
a hermitage; except he ſhould point out a  
church- yard: hermitages, in time paſt, _  
not only places of religious retirement, but o  
burial&#x27; too. And it has ſcarce or never been  
heard of, but that every cell, now known, con-  
rains, or contained, theſe relicts of humanity ;  
ſome mutilated, and ſome entire. I do not in-  
form, but give nie leave to remind, your lord-  
ſhip, that here ſat ſolitary ſanctity, and here the  
hermit, or the anchoreſs, hoped that repoſe for  
their bones, when dead, they here enjoyed when  
living. = 1  
All this while, my lord, I am ſenſible this is  
  
known to your lordſhip, and many in this court,  
  
(#F-  
  
better chan I. But it ſeems neceſſary to my caſe  
that others, who have not at all, perhaps, advert-  
ed to things of this nature, and may have con-  
cern in my trial, ſhould be made acquainted  
with it. Suffer me then, my lord, to produce  
a few of many evidences, that theſe cell were  
ufed as repoſitories of the dead, and to enume-  
rate a few, in which human ones have been  
found, as it happened in this in queſtion ; leſt,  
to Fae that accident might ſeem extraordina-  
ry, and, confequently, occaſion prejudice.  
  
1. The bones, as was ſuppoſed, of the Saxon,  
St. Dubritius, were diſcovered buried in his cell  
at Guy&#x27;s cliff near Warwick, as appears from the  
authority of Sir William Dugdale.  
  
  
cell at Royſton, entire, fair, and undecayed,  
though they muſt have lain interred for ſeveral  
centuries, as is proved by Dr. Stukely.  
  
  
neighbourhood, ſupplies another inſtance : for,  
in January, 1747, was found, by Mr. Stovin,  
accompanied by a reverend gentleman, the  
bones, in part, of fome recluſe, in the cell at  
Lindholm, near Hatfield. They were believed  
to be thoſe of William of Lindholm, a hermit,  
who had long made this cave his habitation.  
  
4. In February 1744, part of Woburn abbey  
Ava pulled down, a large portion. of a&#x27; corpſe  
appeared, even with the fleſh on, and which  
bore cutting with a knife ; though it is certain  
this had laid above 200 years, and how much  
longer is doubtful; for this abbey was founded  
in 1145, and diſſolved i in 1538 or 9.

nothing extraordinary in it. Rly lord, almoſt

Another particular ſeems not to claim a little  
of your lordſhip&#x27;s notice, and that of the gen-  
tlemen of the jury ; which is, that perhaps no  
Faw ap occurs of more than one ſkeleton being  
found in one cell; and in the cell in queſtion  
  
  
peculiarity of every other known cell in Britain.  
; EE. Ez : | Not  
  
  
: [28]  
  
Not the invention of one ſkeleton, then, but of  
  
  
Eut then, my lord, to attempt to indentify  
  
  
times has proved ſo difficult, as in the caſe of  
  
  
paſs unconſidered here, where gentlemen believe  
with caution, think with reaſon, and decide

do this is calculated to ſerve, in aſſigning proper  
  
  
propriation can only appear to eternal omni-  
D_AC_CTTTS TI 8  
Permit me, my lord, alſo, very humbly to  
  
  
have been the inſeparable adjuncts of every cell,  
  
  
as containing them, in this caſe, ſhews him ra-  
ther unfortunate than conſcious preſcient, and  
  
accidentally concurred with this conjecture. A  
  
Bur it ſeems another fkeleton has been diſco-  
vered by ſome labourer, which was full as  
confidently averred to be Clark&#x27;s as this. M  
lord, muſt ſome of the living, if it promotes  
  
  
bones that earth has concealed, and chance  
expoſed ? And might not a place where bones

Ment too is a human ſkull produced, which is  
  
  
conſequence of death; was it owing to violence,  
or was it the effect of natural decay? If it was  
violence, was that violence before or after death?  
My lord, in May, 1732, the remains of William  
lord archbiſhop of this province were taken up,  
by. permiſſion, in this cathedral, and the bones  
  
  
died by no violence offered to him alive, that  
  
  
Let it be conſidered, my lord, that, upon the  
  
  
ſearch after 1 imaginary treaſures, coffins were bro-  
  
  
ranſack*d, and ſhrines demoliſhed ; your lordſhip  
knows that theſe violations proceeded ſo far, as  
fo occaſion parliamentary authority to reſtrain  
  
  
I entreat your lord-  
  
Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant  
that Knareſbrough had a caſtle; which, tho&#x27; now  
à ruin, was once conſiderable both for its ſtrength  
and garriſon. All know it was vigorouſly be-  
  
  
fell in all the places round it; and where they

L 301  
theſe reſt yet unknown, whoſe bones futurity ſhall  
diſcover. ; | |  
I hope, with all imaginable ſubmiſſion, that  
what has been ſaid will not be thought imperti-  
nent to this indictment; and that it will be far  
  
  
of this place, to impute to the living what zeal  
in its fury may have done; what nature may have  
  
  
may have deſtroyed, alone depoſited. - |  
  
As to the circumſtances that have been rak*d  
together, I have nothing to obſerve ; but that  
all circumſtances whatſoever are precarious, and  
have been but too frequently found lamentably  
fallible; even the ſtrongeſt have failed. They  
may riſe to the utmoſt degree of probability;  
yet are they but probability ſtill, Why need 1  
  
  
corded in Dr. Howel, who both ſuffered upon  
circumſtances, becauſe of the ſudden diſappear-  
ance of their lodger, who was in credit, had  
contracted debts, borrowed money, and went  
off unſeen, and returned again a great many  
years after their execution. Why name the in-  
tricate affair of Jaques du Moulin, under king  
Charles II. related by a gentleman who was  
council for the crown: and why the unhappy  
Coleman, who ſuffered innocent, tho* convicted  
upon poſitive evidence, and whole children pe-  
riſhed for want, becauſe the world uncharitabl  
  
believed the father guilty. Why mention the  
  
  
evidence; who, to ſcreen himſelf, equally accu-  
cuſed Fainloth and Loveday of the murder of  
Dunn; the firſt of whom, in 1749, was executed  
  
[ 31 }  
at Wincheſter ; and Loveday was about to ſuffer  
at Reading, had not Smith been proved perjur-  
ed, to the ſatisfaction of the court, by the ſur-  
geon of the Goſport Hoſpital.  
  
Now, my lord, having endeavoured to ſnew  
that the whole of this proceſs is altogether re-  
pugnant to every part of my life; that it is in-  
conſiſtent with my condition of health about that  
time; that no rational inference can be drawn,  
that a perſon is dead who ſuddenly diſappears. ;  
that hermitages were the conſtant repoſitories of  
the bones of the recluſe ; that the proofs of this  
are well authenticated ; that the revolutions in  
religion, or the fortune of war, has mangled, or  
buried, the dead; the concluſion remains, per-  
haps, no leſs reaſonably than impatiently wiſhed  
for. I, laſt, after a year&#x27;s confinement, equal  
to either fortune, put myſelf upon the candor,  
the juſtice, and the humanity of your lordſhip,  
  
and upon yours, my countrymen, gentlemen of

Firſt, my lord, the whole tenor of my con-  
duct in life contradicts every particular of this  
indictment. Yet I had never ſaid this, did not  
my preſent circumſtances extort it from me, and  
ſem to make it neceſſary, Permit me here, my  
lord, to call upon malignity itſelf, ſo long and  
cruelly buſied in this proſecution, to charge upon  
me any immorality, of which prejudice was not  
the author. No, my lord, I concerted not ſchemes  
of fraud, projected no violence, injured no man&#x27;s  
perſon or property. My days were honeſtly la-  
borious, my nights intenſely ſtudious. And, I  
humbly conceive, my notice of this, eſpecially at  
this time, will not be thought impertinent, or  
unſeaſonable ; but, at leaſt, deſerving ſome atten-  
tion : becauſe, my lord, that any perſon, &#x27;after a  
remperate uſe of life, a ſeries of thinking and  
acting regularly, and without one ſingle devia-  
tion from ſobriety, ſhould plunge into the very  
depth of profligacy, precipitately and at once, is  
altogether improbable and unprecedented, &#x27;and  
abſolutely inconſiſtent with the courſe of things.  
Mankind is never corrupted at once ; villainy is  
always progreſſive, and declines from right,  
ſtep after ſtep, till every regard of probity is loſt,  
and every ſenſe of all moral obligations totally  
periſhes. bo 3 77  
  
Again, my lord, a ſuſpicion of this kind,  
which nothing but malevolence could entertain,  
and ignorance propagate, is violently oppoſed by  
my very ſituation at that time, with reſpect to  
health : For, but a little ſpace before, I had been  
confined to my bed, and ſuffered under a&#x27; very  
long and ſevere diſorder, and was not able, for  
half a year together, ſo much as to walk. The  
diſtemper left me indeed, yet ſlowly and in part;  
  
| but  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
241  
but ſo macerated, ſo enfeebled, that T was re-  
duced to crutches; and was ſo far from bein  
well about the time I am charged with this fact,  
that I never to this day perfectly recovered.  
Could then a perſon in this condition take any  
thing into his head ſo unlikely, ſo extravagant?  
I, paſt the vigour of my age, feeble and vale-  
tudinary, with no inducement to engage, no  
ability to accompliſh, no weapon wherewith to  
perpetrate ſuch a fact; without intereſt, without  
power, without motive, without means.  
  
Beſides, it muſt needs occur to every one, that  
an action of this atrocious nature is never heard  
  
  
that it was to ſupport ſome indolence, or ſupply  
ſome luxury, to ſatisfy ſome avarice, or oblige  
ſome malice ; to prevent ſome real, or ſome ima-  
ginary want: Yet I lay not under the influence  
of any one of theſe. Surely, my lord, I may,  
conſiſtent with both truth and modeſty, affirm  
thus much ; and none who have any veracity, and  
knew me, will ever queſtion this. ;  
  
In the ſecond place, the diſappearance of  
Clark is ſuggeſted as an argument of his being  
dead: but the uncertainty of ſuch an inference  
from that, and the fallibility of all concluſions  
of ſuch a ſort, from ſuch a circumſtance, are  
too obvious, and too notorious, to require in-  
ſtances : Let, ſuperſeding many, permit me to  
produce a very recent one, and that afforded by  
this caſtle.  
  
In June, 17957, William Thompſon, for all  
the vigilance of this place, in open day- light, and  
doubled-ironed, made his eſcape; and, notwith-  
ſtanding an immediate enquiry ſet on foot, the  
ſtricteſt ſearch, and all advertiſement, was ne-  
  
| Ver  
  
| b 25 }  
  
ver ſeen or heard of ſince. If then Thompſon  
got off unſeen, through all theſę difficulties, how  
very eaſy was it for Clark, when none of them  
oppoſed him? But what would be thought of x  
  
proſecution commenced againſt any one ſeen laſt  
Permit me, next, my lord, to obſerve a little  
upon the bones which have been diſcovered. It  
  
is ſaid; which perhaps is ſaying very far, that  
theſe are the ſkeleton of a man. It is poſſible  
indeed it may: but is there any certalm known  
criterion, which inconteſtibly diftingutſhes the  
ſex in human bones? Let it be conſidered, my  
Jord, whether the aſcertaining&#x27; of &quot;this point  
ought not to precede any attempt to identify

The, place of their depoſitum top claims

better chan I. But it ſeems neceſſary to my caſe  
that others, who have not at all, perhaps, advert-  
ed to things of this nature, and may have con-  
cern in my trial, ſhould be made acquainted  
with it. Suffer me then, my lord, to produce  
  
a few of many evidences, that theſe cells were  
uſed as repoſitories of the dead, and to enume-  
  
  
found, as it happened in this in queſtion; leſt,  
to ſome, that accident might ſeem extraordina-  
ry, and, conſequently, occaſion prejudice,  
  
1. The bones, as was ſuppoſed, of the Saxon,  
St. Dubritius, were diſcovered buried in his cell  
at Guy&#x27;s cliff near Warwick, as appears from me  
authority of Sir William Duggdale.  
  
2. The bones, thought to be thoſe. of the an-  
choreſs Roſia, were but lately diſcovered in a  
cell at Royſton, entire, fair, and undecayed,  
Though they muſt have lain interred for ſeveral  
£enturies, as is proved by Dr. Stukely.  
  
But our own country, nay, almoſt this  
neighbourbood, ſupplies another inſtance : for,  
  
  
accompanied by a reverend gentleman, the  
bones, in part, of ſome recluſe, in the cell at  
Lindholm, near Hatfield. They were believed  
  
  
who had long made this cave his habitation.  
  
4. In February 1744, part of Woburn abbey  
Pint pulled down, a large portion of a corpſe  
appeared, even with the Ach on, and which  
bore cutting with a knife; though it is certain  
this had laid above 200 years, and how much  
  
  
in 1445, and diſſolved i in 1538 or 9,  
What

What would have been ſaid, what believed,  
if this had been an accident to the bones in  
  
  
Farther, my lord, it is not yet out of living  
memory, that a little diſtance from Knareſ-  
  
  
thy and patriot baronet, who does that borough  
  
  
ſkeleton only, bur five or ſix depoſited ſide by  
  
  
lordſhip knows was ulual in antient interments.  
About the ſame time, and in another field,  
  
  
in ſearching for gravel, another human ſkele-  
ton ; but the piety of the ſame worthy gentle-  
man ordered both the pits to be filled up again,  
commendably unwilling to diſturb the dead.  
  
Is the invention of theſe bones forgotten, then,  
or induſtriouſly concealed, that the diſcovery of  
thoſe in queſtion may appear the more ſingular  
and extraordinary ? Whereas, in fact, there is  
nothing extraordinary in it. Ny lord, almoſt  
  
  
in hills, in highway ſides, in commons, lie fre-  
quent and unſuſpected bones. And our preſent  
  
  
Another particular ſeems not to claim a little  
of your lordſhip&#x27;s notice, and that of the gen-  
  
  
found in one cell; and in the cell in queſtion  
was found but ; agreeable, in this, to the  
  
  
Sz” Not  
  
WT... .[«7  
Not the invention of one ſkeleton, then, but of  
two, would have appeared ſuſpicious and uncom-  
/ a EEE  
But then, my lord, to attempt to indentify  
theſe, when even to indentify living nien ſome-  
times has proved fo difficult, as in the caſe of  
Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Symnel at home,  
and of Don. Sebaſtian abroad, will be looked  
Vpon, perhaps as an attempt to determine what  
is indeterminable. And I hope too it will not  
paſs unconſidered here, where gentlemen believe  
with caution, think with reaſon, and decide  
with humanity, what intereſt the endeavour to  
do this is calculated to ſerve, in afligning proper  
perſonality. to thoſe bones, whoſe particular ap-  
8 51 can only appear to eternal omni-  
ſcience. 5  
  
Permit me, my lord, alſo, very humbly to  
  
remonſtrate, that, as human bones appear to  
have been the inſeparable adjuncts of every cell,  
even any perſon&#x27;s naming ſuch a place at random  
as containing them, in this caſe, ſhews him ra-  
ther unfortunate. than conſcious preſcient, and  
that theſe attendants on every hermitage only  
accidentally concurred with this conjecture. A  
mere caſual coincidence of words and things.  
  
But it ſeems Another ſkeleton has been diſco-  
vered by. ſome labourer, which was full as  
confidently averred to be Clark&#x27;s as this. My  
Jord, muſt ſome of the living, if it promotes  
ſome intereſt, be made anſwerable for all the  
bones that earth has concealed, and chance  
expoſed ? And might not a place where bones  
lay be mentioned by a perſon by chance, as  
well as found by a labourer by chance? Or, is  
  
it  
  
-  
  
| 29 }  
it more criminal accidentally to name where bones  
lie, than accidentally to find where they lie?  
Here too is a human ſkull produced, which is  
fractured; but was this the cauſe, or was it the  
conſequence of death ; was it owing to violence,  
or was it the effect of natural decay? If it was  
violence, was that violence before or after death ?  
  
My lord, in May, 1732, the remalns of William  
lord archbiſhop of this province were taken up,  
by permiſſion, in this carhedral, and the bones  
of the ſkull were found broken; yet certainly he  
died by no violence offered to him alive, that  
gould occaſion that fracture there.  
  
Loet it be confidered, my lord, that, upon the  
diſſolution of religious houſes, and the commence-  
ment of the reformation, the ravages of thoſe  
times both affected the living and the dead. In  
ſearch after imaginary treaſures, coffins were bro-  
ken up, graves and vaults dug open, monuments  
ranſack&#x27;d, and fhrines demolithed ; your lordſhip  
knows that theſe violations proceeded fo far, as  
to occaſion parliamentary authority to reſtrain  
them; and it did, about the beginning of the  
reign of queen Elizabeth. I entreat your lord-  
ſhip ſuffer not the violences, the depredations,  
and the iniquities of thoſe times, to be imputed  
to this. 1 | ” |  
| Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant  
that Knareſbrough had a caſtle ; which, tho? now  
a ruin, was once conſiderable both for its ſtrength  
and garriſon. All know it was vigorouſly be-  
fieged by the arms of the partiament : at which  
ſiege, in ſallies, conflicts, flights, purfuits, many  
Fell in all the places round it; and where they  
fell were buried; for every place, my lord, is  
burial earth in war; and many, 3 of  
  
| theſe  
  
[ 30]  
  
theſe reſt yet unknown, whoſe bones futurity ſhall  
diſcover. F  
I hope, with all imaginable, ſubmiſſion, that  
what has been ſaid will not be thought imperti-  
nent to this indictment; and that it will be far  
from the wiſdom, the learning, and the integrity  
of this place, to impute to the living what zeal  
in its fury may have done; what nature may have  
taken off, and piety interred; or what war alone  
may have deſtroyed, alone depoſited.  
  
As to the circumſtances that have been rak&#x27;d  
together, I have nothing to obſerve; but that  
all circumſtances whatſoever are precarious, and  
have been but too frequently found lamentably  
fallible ; even the ſtrongeſt have failed. They  
may riſe to the utmoſt degree of probability;  
yet are they but probability ſtill, Why need I  
name to your Jordſhip the two Harriſons re-  
corded in Dr. Howel, who both ſuffered upon  
circumſtances, becauſe of the ſudden diſappear-  
ance of their lodger, who was in credit, had  
contracted debts, borrowed money, and went  
off unſeen, and returned again a great many  
years after their execution. Why name the in-  
tricate affair of Jaques du Moulin, under king  
Charles II. relared by a gentleman who was  
council for the crown : and why the unhappy  
Coleman, who ſuffered innocent, tho&#x27; convicted  
upon poſitive evidence, and whoſe children pe-  
riſhed for want, becauſe the world uncharitably  
believed the father guilty. Why mention, the  
perjury af Smith, incautiouſly admitted king&#x27;s  
evidence; who, to ſcreen himſelf, equally accu-  
cuſed Fainloth and Loveday of the murder of  
Dunn; the firſt of whom, in 1749, was executed  
8 f | I»  
  
L 31]  
at Wincheſter ; and Loveday was about to ſuffer  
at Reading, had not Smith been proved perjur-  
ed, to the ſatisfaction of the court, by the ſur-  
geon of the Goſport Hoſpital.  
  
Now, my lord, having endeavoured to ſhow  
that the whole of this proceſs is altogether re-  
pugnant to every part of my hfe ; that it is in-  
conſiſtent with my condition of health about that  
time; that no rational inference can be drawgs  
that a perſon is dead who , ſuddenly diſappears z  
that hermitages were the conſtant -repaſitories of  
the bones of the recluſe; that the proofs of this  
are well authenticated; that the revolutions in  
religion, or the fortune of war, has mangled,.&#x27;or  
buried, the dead; the conclufionyremains, per-  
haps, no lefs reaſonably; than impatiently wiſhed  
for. I, laſt, after a year&#x27;s canfinement, equal  
to either fortune, put myſelf upon the candor,  
the juſtice, and the humanity of your lordſhip,  
and upon yours, my countrymen, nn of  
the Jury. 5 1245

that of this Honourable Court. 3  
Firſt, My Lord, the whole Tenor of my Con-  
duct in Life contradicts every Particular of this  
Indictment. Yet I had never faid this, did not

ſeem to make it neceſſary. Permit me here, m  
  
Lord, to call upon uty itſelf, ſo long —  
cruelly buſied in this Proſecution, to charge upon  
me any Immorality, of which Prejudice was not  
the Author. No, my Lord, I concerted not  
Schemes of Fraud, projected no Violence, in-  
jured no Man&#x27;s Perſon or Property. My Days  
were honeſtly laborious, my Nights intenſely  
  
ſtudious. And, I humbly conceive, my Notice  
of this, eſpecially at this Time, will not be  
thought impertinent, or unſeaſonable ; but, at  
leaſt, deſerving ſome Attention: Becauſe, my  
Lord, that any Perſon, after a temperate Uſe of  
Life, a Series of thinking and acting regularly,  
and without one 1 Deviation from Sobriety,  
ſhould plunge into the very Depth of Profligacy,  
  
1 and at once, is altogether impro-  
  
  
fiſtent with the Courſe of Things. Mankind is  
never corrupted at once; Villainy is always pro-  
8 and declines from Right, Step after  
tep, till every Regard of Probity 1s loſt, and every  
Senſe of all Moral Obligations totally periſhes.  
Again, my Lord, a Suſpicion o Nis Kind,  
which nothing but Malevolence could entertain,  
and Ignorance propagare, is violently oppoſed by  
my very Situation at that Time, with reſpe&amp; to  
Health : For, but a little Space before, I had been  
confined to my Bed, and ſuffered under a very  
long and ſevere Diforder, and was not able, for  
half a Year together, ſo much as to walk. The  
Diſtemper left me indeed, yet ſlowly and in Part;  
but ſo macerated, ſo enfeebled, that I was re-  
duced to Crutches; and was ſo far from bei  
well about the Time I am charged with this F  
that I never to this perfectly recovered,

thing into his Head ſo unlikely, fo extravagant?  
I, patt the Vigour of my Age, feeble and vale:  
tudinary, with no Inducement to engage, no  
Ability to accompliſh, no Weapon wherewith to  
erpetrate ſuch a Fact, without Intereſt, Without  
  
Power, without Motive, without Means.  
Beſides, it muſt needs occur to every one, that  
an Action of this atrocious Nature is never heard  
of, but, when 1ts Springs are laid open, it appears  
that it was to ſupport ſome Indolence, or ſupply  
ſome Luxury, to ſatisfy fore Avarice, or lee  
  
  
ginary Want: Yet I lay not under the Influence  
of any one of theſe. Surely, my Lord, I may, con-  
ſiſtent with both Truth and Modeſty, affirm thus  
much; and none who have any Veracity, and  
Knew me, wall ever queſtion this.  
In the ſecond Place, the Diſappearance of  
  
  
dead: But the Uncertamty of ſuch an Inference  
from that, and the Fallibility of all Concluſions  
of ſuch a Sort, from ſuch a, Circumſtance, are  
too obvious, and too notorious, to. require In-  
ſtances: Yet, ſuperceding many, permit me to  
eros very recent one, and that afforded. by  
In June, 1757, William Thompſon, for all the  
Vigilance of this Place, in open Day-light, and  
double-ironed, made his Eſcape; and, notwith-  
ſtanding an immediate F 9 I on Foot, the  
ſtricteſt Search, and all Advertiſements, was ne-  
ver feen or heard of ſince. If then Thowp/on.gat

eaſy was it for Clark, when none of them oppoſed  
him? But what would be thought of. a Proſe-  
cution 7” againſt any one Jeen alt-with =

*  
Permit me, next, my Lord, to obſerve a little  
upon the Bones which have been diſcovered. © It  
is ſaid, which perhaps is ſaying very far, that theſe  
are the Skeleton of a Man. Tis poſſible indeed  
it may: But is there any certain known Cri--  
terion, which meonteſtibly diſtinguiſhes the Sex  
in Human Bones? Let it be conſidered, my  
Lord, whether the aſcertaining of this Point  
5 not to precede any Attempt to identify  
em. | £58 | |  
The Place of their Depoſitum too claims  
much more Attention than is commonly beſtow&#x27;d  
upon it: For, of all Places in the World, none  
could have mentioned any one, wherein there was  
greater Certainty of finding Human Bones,  
than a Hermitage; except he ſhould pomt out a  
Church-yard: Hermitages, in Time paſt, be-  
ing not only Places of Religious Retirement, but  
of Burial too. And it has ſcarce or never been  
heard of, but that every Cell, now known, con-  
tains, or contained, theſe:Reh&amp;s of Humanity;  
fome murilated, and ſome entire. I do not in-  
form, but give me Leave to remind, your Lord-  
ſhip, that here at ſolitary Sanctity, and here the  
Hermit, or the Anchorels, hoped that Repoſe for  
their Bones, when dead, they here erjoyed when  
living. | h | |  
All this while, my Lord, I am ſenſible this is  
known to your L. ip, and many in this Court,  
better than I. But it ſeems neceſſary to my Caſe +  
that others, who have not at all, perhaps, adverted  -  
to Fhings of this Nature, and may have Concern - :  
in my Trial, thould be made achuainted with it.  
Suffer me then, my Lord, to produce a few of

MfoD or property. My days were honedly la-  
torious, my nights intenlly fludious. And I  
humbly conceive, my notice of this, erpecially at  
this time, will not be thought impertineni, or un-  
fcafonable; but, at lead, deferving fame attentioo:  
hecaufe, my Lord, that any perfon, after a tem¬  
perate ufc of life, a fer&#x27;es of thinking and aff-  
ing regularly, and without one Tingle deviation  
from Tobricty, Oioiild plunge into the vefy depth  
of profligacy, precipitately and at once, is alto¬  
gether improbable antj unprecedented, and ab-  
Tduteiy inconlfflent with the courfe of things.  
Mankind is never corrupted at once ; villainy is  
always progrelTive, and declines from riglu, Ilep  
after ilep, till every regard of probity is loft, and  
every fenfe of all moral obligations totally  
perilbes.  
  
• Again, my Lord, a fufpicion of this kind,  
which nothing but malevolence could entertain,  
and ignorance propagate, is violently oppofed by  
my very (iiuation at that time, with rcTpefl to  
heidth : fur, but a little Tpace before, I had been  
eonflned to my bed, and Tuffered under a very  
long and fevere diforder, and was not able, for  
half a year together, fo much as to walk. The  
dillempar Ir^ me indeed, yet (lowly and in part;  
but fo macerated, ib enfeebled, that I was re¬  
duced to crutbhts; and was fo far from being  
well about the time I am charged with this fafl,  
(bat I neven. to-&#x27; this day perfcflly recovered.  
Could then a perfon In this condition take any  
thing into hit bead fb unlikely. To extravagant ?  
I, paft the vigour of my age, feeble and valetu¬  
dinary, with no indhceibent to engage, no abili¬  
ty to aecompliih, no weapon wherewith to per¬  
petrate fuch a ftdl; Without&#x27;^ntereft, without  
{lower, without nvotive, without means.  
  
&#x27; Bclides, it mull needs occur to every one, that  
an aflion of this attocibus&#x27; nature is never heard  
of, but, when ,its fprings are laid openi k ap¬  
pears that it was to fuppori fom&#x27;e fndnlence, or  
fupply (bane luxury; to fatisty fomc&#x27; avarice, or  
bblige foroe maKce ; to prevent fume real, or  
fome imaginary want ; Yet I by not&#x27; qnder the  
influence of any one of thefe. Surely, my Lord;  
I may, confiftent with both truth and modefty,  
alErm this much ; and none who have any veraci¬  
ty, and know nie» will ever queftion this. &#x27;  
  
In the fecond place; the diftLppearancc of Clark  
Is fuggefted as kn argument of his being dead :  
but the uncertainty of Tuch an irtference from  
lhat, and the sx.libility of&#x27;all conciuTions of fucli  
a fort, from fuch a eircumftance, arc too obvious,  
and too notorious, to require inrtances-: yet, fup-  
erfeding many, permit me to produce a very re¬  
cent one, and that afforded by this caftle.  
  
In June 1657, ^V&quot;^lliam Thomptbn, for all  
the vigilance on- ibis&#x27;place, in open day-light, and  
double ironed, made his efcape; and, notwith-  
ftanding an imnirdiate enquiry fet on foot, the  
ftrifleft Larch, and all adveriKement, was never  
feeu or heard of lincev it&#x27; ti’-en Thompfon got  
  
fpeech of Eugene Aram. 439  
  
off unfeen, tlirough all thefe difficulties, bow  
very eafy was it for Clark, when none of them  
oppfed him 1 But what would be thought of a  
prolixution commenced agaioft any one Teen la(|  
with &#x27;1 bompfon.  
  
Permit me, next, my Lord, to obferve a little  
upon tlie bones which nave&#x27;been difeovered. It  
is faid, which perhaps is faying very far, that thefe  
arc the Ikeleton of k • man. It is poffibe indcctt  
it may: but is there any certain known criterion,  
whicli incontcftibly diltinguilbes&#x27; the fex in hu-^  
man bones 1 Let it be confidercd, my Lord,  
whether the ^ceriaining of this point ought not  
to precede any attempt to indeiitii^ them.  
  
The place of their depofitum, too, claims much  
more attendon than is commonly beftowed up¬  
on it: for, of all places in the world, none dould  
have mentioned any one, whrt&#x27;ein there was  
greater certainty of finding human bones, than a  
hermitage ; except he Ihould point out a church¬  
yard : hermitages, in times paft, being not only  
places of rcligjous retirement, but of burial too.  
And it has I&#x27;carce, or never, been heard of, but  
that every cell, now known, contains, or con*  
tained, thefe reticks of humanity ; fome mutila¬  
ted, and fome entire. 1 do not inform, but  
give me leave to remind your lurdlhip, that here  
fat folitary fanfUty, and here the hermit; or the  
anchorefs, hoped that repofe for their bones,  
when dead, they here enjoyed when living.  
  
All this while, my Lord, I am ienliblc tbit 1 $  
known to your lordlnip, and ma^ in this court,  
better thin 1 . But k feems neceflary to my cafe,  
that others, who have not it all, perhap*. ad¬  
verted to things of this natures.and may have  
concern in iny trial, ihould be inade.Acquainied  
with it SufJer me then, my Lord, to produce a  
few of many evidences, that thefe fcHs were  
ufed as repoiitorics of tlie dead, and to enume¬  
rate a few in which human ly)nes hkve been  
found, as k happened in this in queftion ; left,  
to fome, that accident might leem extraor^na.

Could then a perion in this condition take any

I, patt the vigour ot my age, feeble and vale-  
tudinary, with no inducement to engage, no  
ability to accomplith, no weapon. wherewith to  
perpetrate fuch a tact; without intereft, with-  
out power, without motive, without means.  
  
Betides, it mutt needs occur to every one, that  
an action of this atrocious nature is never heard  
of, but, when its tprings are laid open, it ap-  
pears that it was to fupport fome ind lence, or  
fupply fome luxury; to fatisty fome avarice, or  
oblige fome malice ; to prevent fome real, or  
fume imaginary want: yet I Jay not under the  
influence of any one of thele. Surely, my Lord,  
I may, conhiilent with both truth and modeity,  
afhirm thus much; and none who have any ve-  
racitv, and knew me, will ever quettion this.  
  
In the fecond place,the difappearance of Clark

who have not at all,  
periips, adverted to things of this nature,  
aud may have concern in my trial, fhould be  
made acquainted with it. Suffer me then, my  
Lord, to produce a few of many evidences,  
that thete cells were uled as repofitories of the  
dead, and to enumerate a few, in which hu-  
man bones have been found, as it happened ia  
this in queftion ; leit, to fome, that accident  
might feem extraordinary, and, confequently,  
occation prejudice.  
  
1. The bones, as was fuppofed, of the Sax-  
vn, St. Dubritius, were difcovered buried in  
his cell at Guy&#x27;s cliff, near Warwick, ‘as aj-  
pears trom the authority of Sir William Dug-  
  
dale.  
  
z. The bones, thought to be thofe of the  
anchoreis Rotia, were but lately difcovered in  
a cell at Royitou, cniire, fa&#x27;r, and undecayed,  
though ihicy mult have lain jaterred for feveral  
centuries, as is proved by Dr. Stukely. *.  
  
3- But our own country, nay, almof this  
neigubourhood, fupplies another initance: for  
ia January, 1747, was found by Mr. Stovift,  
accumpanied by a reverend Geatieman, the  
bones, in part, of iome reclufg, in the cell at  
Lindholm, near Hatfield. ‘They were believ-  
ed to be thoie of William of Lindholm, a  
hermit, who had long made this cave his habi-  
tation.  
  
q4- In February 1744, part of Woburn ab-  
bey being pulled down, a large portion of a  
corpie appeared, even with the flefh on, and  
which bore cutting with a knife; though it is  
certain this had laid above 200 years, and how  
much longer is doubtful; for this abbey was  
founded ia 1145, and diilolved in 1538 or 9.  
  
What would have been taid, what believed, if  
this had been an accident tothe bones in queftion?  
  
Further, my Lord, it is not yet out of liv-  
ing memory, that a little diftance from Knaref-  
brough, ina field, part cf the manor of the  
worthy and patriot Baronet, who does that  
borough the honour to reprejent it in Parli-  
ament, were found, in digging for gravel,

at its head, as your Lordihip knows was ufual  
in antient interments. :  
About the tame time, and in another field,  
almoft clote to this borough, was difcovered  
alfo, in fearching for gravel, another human  
skeleton; but the picty of the fame worthy  
Gentleman ordered both the pits to be filled  
  
up again, commendably unwilling to ditturb  
the dead.  
Is tie invention of thefe bones forgotten,  
  
then, or induttrioufly concealed, that the dif  
covery of thofe im queilion may appear the  
more fingular and extracrdinary ? Whertas,  
in fuét, there ts nothing extracrdinary in it.

commons, he frequent aad ualufpecied

bones. And our prefent allotments for ref  
for the departed, is but of fome centuries.  
  
Another particular feems not to claim a lit-  
tle of your Lordfhip’s notice, and that of the  
Gentlemen of the jury ; which is, that per-  
haps no example occurs of more than one skeé-  
Jeton being found in ove cell ; and in the cell  
in queftion was found but ove ; agreeable, in  
this, to the peculiarity of every other known  
cell in Britain. Not the invention of one ske-  
Jeton, then, but of two, would have appeared  
fulpicious and uncommon.  
  
But then, my Lord, to attempt to identify  
thefe, wien even to identify living men fome-  
times has proved fo difficult, as in the cafe of  
Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Symnei at home,  
and of Don Sebaitian abroad, will be Jooked  
upoa perhaps as an attempt to determine what  
is ud-terminavle. And I hope too it will not  
  
ais uncontidered here, where Gentlemen be-  
a with caution, think with reafon, and de-  
cide with humanity, what intereft the endea-  
vour to dothis is calculated to ferve,in aligning  
proper perfonatity to thofe bones, whofe par-  
ticular appropriation can only appear to eter-  
nal Omniicience.  
  
Permit me, my Lord, alfo, very humbly to  
remonttrate, that, as human bones appear to  
have been the infeparable adjuncts of every  
cell, even any perfon’s naming fuch a place at  
random as containing them, in this cafe, fhews  
him rather unfortunate than confcious pre-  
fcient, and that thefe attendants on every her-  
mitage only accidentally concurred with this  
conjecture. A mere cafual coincidence of  
ewords and thiags.  
  
But it feems another fkeleton has been difco-  
vered by fome labourer, which was full as con-  
fidently averred to be Clark&#x27;s as this. My Lord,  
muft fome of the living, if it promotes fome  
intereft, be made anfwerable for all the bones  
that earth has concealed, and chance expofed ?  
And might not a place where bones lay be men-  
tioned by a perfon by chance, as well as found  
by a labourer by chance? Or, is it more cri-  
minal accidentally to name where bones lie, than  
accidentally to fiud where they lie?  
  
Here too is a human skull produced, which is  
fractured; but was this the cau/e, or was it the  
confequence of death; was it owing to vio-  
lence, or was it the effect of natural decay? If  
it was violence, was that violence before or af-  
ter death ? My Lord, in May, 1732, the re.  
mains of William Lord Archbithop of this pro-  
vince were taken up, by permiffion, in this ca-  
thedral, and the bones of the skull were found  
broken ; yet certainly he died by no violence  
offered to him alive, that could occafion that  
fra&amp;ture there.  
  
Let it be confidered, my Lord, that, upon the  
Giffolution of religious houfes, and the com-  
mencement of the Reformation, the ravages of  
thofe times both affected the living and the dead.  
  
In fearch after imaginary treafures, coffins were  
broken up, graves and vaults dug open, monu-  
ments ranfack&#x27;d, and fhrines demoiithed ; your  
Lordthip knows that thefe violations proceeded  
fu far, as to occasion parliamentary authority  
to reftrain them ; and it did, about the begin  
ing of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. I entreat  
your Lordthip fuffer not the violences, the de-  
predations, and the iniquities of thofe times to  
be imputed to this.  
  
Moreover, what Gentleman here is ignorant  
that Knaresbrough had a caftle ; which, tho’  
now aruin, was once confiderable both for its  
  
ftrength and garrifon. All know it was vigor-  
oufly befieged by the arms of the Parliament:  
at which fhege, in fallies, confli&amp;ts, flights, pur-  
fuits, many feil in all the places round it; and  
where they fell were buried 3 for every place,  
my Lord, is burial earth in war; and many,  
queftionlefs, of thefe reft yet unknown, whofe  
bones futurity fhall difcover.  
  
I hope, with all imaginable fubmiffion, that  
what has been faid will not be thought imperti-  
nent to this indiétment ; and that it will be far  
trom the wifdom, the learning, and the inte.  
grity of this place, to impute to the living what  
zeal in its fury may have done; what nature  
may have taken off, and piety interred ; or what  
war alone may have dettroyed, alone depo-  
fited.  
  
As to the circumftances that have been rak&#x27;d  
together, I have nothing to obferve ; but that  
all circumftances whatfoever are precarious, and  
have been but too frequently found lamentably  
fallible; even the ftrongeft have failed. They  
may rife to the utmoft degree of probability ;  
yet are they but probability ftill. Why need I  
uame to your Lordship the two Harrifons re-  
corded in Dr. Howel, who both fuifered upon  
circumftances, becaufe of the fudden difappear-  
ance of their lodger, who was in credit, had  
contracted debts, borrowed money and went  
otf unfeen, and returned again a great many  
years after their execution &gt;? Why name the in.  
tricate affair of Jacques du Moulin, under King  
Charles IT. related by a Gentleman who was  
Council for the Crown ? and why the unhappy  
Coleman, who fuffered innocent, tho’ convicted  
upon pefitive evidence, and whofe children pe-  
rifhed for want, becaufe the world uncharitably  
believed the father guilty. Why mention the  
perjury of Smith, incautioufly admitted King’s  
evidence ; who, to fcreen himfelf, equa&#x27;&#x27;y ac-  
cufed Faircloth and Loveday of the murder of  
Dunn ; the firft of whom, in 1749, was execu-  
ted at Winchefter ; and Loveday was about to  
fuffer at Reading, had not Smith been proved  
perjured, to the fatisfaction of the Court, by  
the Surgeon of the Gofport hofpital.  
  
Now, my Lord, having endeavoured to thew  
that the whole of this procefs is altogether re-  
pugnant to every part of my life; that it is in-  
confiftent with my condition of health about  
that time; that no rational inference can he  
drawn, that a perfon is dead who fuddenly dif-  
appears ; that hermitages were the conftant re-  
  
proofs of this are well authenticated; that the  
revolutions in religi  
  
&gt;  
  
fion remains, perhaps, no lefs reafonably than  
  
manity of your Lordthip, and upon yours, my  
countrymen, Gentlemen of the Jury.

my conduét in life contradiéts ony  
particular of this indiétment: Yet  
had never faid this, did not my pre-  
fent circumftances extort it from me,

no man’s perfon or property . My  
days were honeftly laborious, my  
nights inten(fely ftudious. And I hum-

avarice, or oblige fome malice, te  
prevent fome real, or imaginary want ;  
  
et I lay not under the influence of  
any one of thefe. Surely, myJord, I  
inay, confitent with both truth and  
modefty, afirm thus much; and none,  
who lave any veracity, and knew.me,  
will ewer queition this. ;  
  
Ln the fecond: place, the difappear-  
ance of Clark is fuggetted as an ar-  
guiment of his being dead; but the  
uncertaimty of fuch am inference from  
that, and the fallability of all conclu-  
fions of fuch a fort, from® fach a cir-  
cumftance, are tao obvieus and too  
notonous to requure inftances: Yet  
fuperfeding many, permit me to pro-  
duce a very recent one, and that af-  
forded by this cattle.  
  
In June, 1757, William Thompfon,  
for all the vigilance of this place, in  
open daylight, and double-ironed,  
made his efcape, and notwithftanding  
an immediate enquiry fet on foot, the  
Arictett fearch, and all advertifement,  
was never feen or herd of fince. If  
then ‘T’hompfon got off unfeen, thro’  
all thefe difficulties, how very ealyv  
was&#x27;it for Clark, when none of them  
oppofed him? But what would be  
thought cf a profecution commenced  
ugainit any one feen laft with Thomp-  
jon ?  
  
Permit me, next, my lord,.to ob-  
ferve a little upom the bones which  
  
The Monthly Mifcellany,

which perhaps is faying very far, that  
thefe are the fkeleton of a man Tt is  
poffible indeed it may ; but is there  
any certain known criterion which

lruman bones? Let it be confidered,  
my lord, whether the afcertainty of  
this point ought net fo precede  
auy attempt to indentify them.  
  
The plage of their depofitum too  
clauns, much more attention than is  
commonly beftowed upon it: For of  
all places in the world, noné could  
howe mentioned any one, wherein  
there Was greater certainty of finding  
  
human bones, than an ermitage ;  
  
except he fhould point out a church. _  
  
yard: Hermitages in times palit, be-  
ing not only places of religious retire~  
meat, but of burial too. And it has.  
fcarce or never been heard of, but  
thatevery cell now known, contains  
or contained thefe reliques of huma-  
nity, fome mutilated, and fome en-  
tire. Ido not inform, but give me  
leave to remind, yor lordfhip, that  
here fat folitary fanctity; and here  
the hermit, or the anchorefs, hoped  
that repofe for their bones, when  
dead, they bere enjoyed when living.  
  
All this while, my lord, I am fenfi-  
ble this is known to your lordfhip and  
many in this court better than I. But  
it feems neceflary to my cafe, that  
others, who’ have net at all perhaps  
adverted to things of this nature, and  
may have concern in my trial, fhould  
be made acquainted with it. Suffer  
me then, my lord, to produce a few  
of many evidences, that thefe cells  
were ufed as repofitories of the dead ;  
and to enumerate a few, in which hu-  
man bones have been found, as it  
happened in this queftion; left to  
fome that accident might feem extra-  
ordinary, and confequently occafion  
prejudice.  
  
1. The bones, as was fuppofed, of  
the Saxon St. Dubritius, were difco-  
vered buried in: his cell at Guy&#x27;s Cliff  
near Warwick ; as appears from the  
authority of Sir William Dugdale.  
_ 2. The bones, thought to be thofe  
of the anchorefs Rofia, were but late-  
ly difcovered in a cell at Roytton, en-  
tire, fair, and undecayed, though  
they mutt have lain interred for feve-  
ral centuries, as is proved by Dr.  
Stukely, 3- But

5. But our, own, country, nay al-  
mot this neighbourhood, fupplies  
another inftance; for in January,  
1749, was found, by Mr. Stovin, ac-  
companied by a reverend géntleman,  
the bones in part of fome reclule, in  
the cell at Lindholm near Hatfield.  
They were believed to be thofe of  
William of Lindholm, a hermit, whe  
had long made this cave his habita-  
tion. |  
  
4. In February, 1744, part of Wo-  
burn-Abbey beimg pulled down, a  
large portion of a corpfe appeared,  
even with the fiefh on, and which  
bore cutting with a knife; though it  
was certain this had lain above 200  
  
ears, and how much longer is doubt-  
ul; for this abbey was founded in  
1145, and diffolved in 1538 or 9.  
  
What would have been faid, what  
believed, if this had been an accident  
to the bones in queftion ?  
  
Yarther, my Jord, 3 is not yet out  
of living memory, that a little dif-  
tance from Knarefbgrough, in a field,  
part of the manor of the worthy and  
pariot baronet, who does that bo-  
rough the honour to reprefent it in  
parliament, were found, in digging  
for gravel, not-one human fkeleton  
only, but five or fix depofited fide by  
fide, with each an urn placed at its  
head ; as your lordfhip knows was u-  
fual in antient interments,  
  
About the fame time, and in ane-  
ther field, almoft clofe to his borough,  
was difcovered alfo, in fearching for  
gravel, another human fkeleton; but  
the piety of the fame worthy gentle-  
man ordered both the pits to be filled  
up again, commendahly unwilling to  
difturb the dead.  
  
Is the invention of thefe bones for-  
gotten then, or induftrioufly conceal-  
ed, that the ditcovery of thofé in  
queftion may appear the more fingular  
and extraordinary ? Whereas in fat,  
there is nothing extraordinary in it.  
My lord, almoft every place conceals  
fuch remains. In fields, fn bills, in  
highway fides, in commons, lie fre-  
quent and unfulpected bones. And  
our prefent allotments for reft for the  
departed, is but of fome centuries.  
  
Another particular, feems not to  
claim a little of your lordfhip’s no-  
tice, and that of the gentlemen of  
the jury, which is, that perhaps no  
  
For MARC H, 1760. 83  
  
example occurs of more than one  
tkeleton being found in one cell ; and  
in the ceil in quéftjon was found but  
one ; agreeable in this to the pecu.ia-  
rity of every other known ceil in Bri-  
‘tain. Not the invention of one fke-  
Jeton then, but of two, would have  
appeared /yfpicieas and asuncommon.  
  
jut then, my lord, to attempt to  
identify thefe, when even to aod  
living men fometimes has proved fo  
dificult, as wn’ the cate of Perkin  
Warbeck and Lambert Symne] at  
home, and Don ‘Sebatian abroad,  
will be looked pan perhaps as an at-  
tempt to détertrine what is incdeter-  
minable ; and J hope too it will not  
pals unconfidered here, where gentle-  
nien believe with caution, think with  
reafon, and decide with humanity,  
what intereft the endeavour to. de this  
is calculated to ferve, in aflignjng pro-  
per perfonality to thafe bones, whote  
particular appropriation can only ap-  
pear to éternal omniitiéace.  
  
Permit me, my lord, alfo very ham-  
bly to remonftrate, that as humar  
bones appear to have Povo the inf-  
parable adjuntts of every cell, even  
any perfon’s naming fich a place at  
random as containing them, in this  
cafe, fhews him .rather wrafortunate  
than cénfcious prefcient, and that  
thefe attendants on every, hermitage  
only accidentally concarred with this  
conjeé tre; a mere cafual coincidence  
of words and things.  
  
But it feems another fkeleton has  
been: difcovered by fame Ia &gt;ourer,  
which was fall as conixiently averred  
to be Clark’sasthis. My lord, mutt  
fome of the living, if it promotes  
fome intereft, be made anfwerabie for  
all the bones that earth has concealec,  
and chance expofed? And might not  
a place where bones Iny, be mention  
ed by a perfon by chance, as well eo:  
found by a labouter by chance? Cr  
is it more criminal accidental&#x27;y to  
namé where bofies Hie, than acciden-  
tally to find where they lie ?  
  
Here too is a Ruman fkull produ-  
ced, which was frattured; but was  
this the caufe, or was it the coale-  
quence of death; was it awing-to the  
violence, or was it the effect of natu-  
ral decay? If it was violetice, wes  
that violence before of after @eati ?

of William, Lord Archbifhop of this  
province, were taken up by permiffi-  
on in this cathedral, and the bones of  
the fkull were found broken; yet cer-  
tainly he died by no violence offered  
to him alive, that could occafion that  
fracture there.  
  
Let it be confidered, my lord, that  
upon the difiolution of religious  
houles, and the commencement of  
the reformation, the ravages of thofe  
times both affected the living and the  
dead. In (earch after imaginary trea-  
fures, coffins were broken up, graves  
and vaults dug open, monuments  
ranfacked, and fhrines demolifhed ;  
  
our lordthip knows, that thefe vio-  
  
ations proceeded fo far as to occafion  
parliamentary authority to retrain  
them ; and it did about the begin-  
ning of the reign of queen Elifabeth.  
I intreat your Jordship futter not the  
violences, the depredations, and the  
iniquities of thole times to be imput-  
ed to this.  
. Morgoyer, what gentleman here is  
ignorant, that Knare(borough had a  
caftle; which though now a ruin, was  
once confideralle both for its ftrength  
and garrifon: All know it was vigo-  
befieged by the arms of the  
fd . io mg fiege, in fal-  
  
y conflicts, flights, purfuits, man;  
fell in all places tind ond and nivaend  
they fell were buried; for every place,  
my lord, is burial earth in war; and  
many, queitjonlefs, of thefe reft yet  
unknown, whofe bones futurity fhail  
difcover. |  
  
I hope, with all i inable fubmif-  
fion, that what has bee faid will net  
be thought impertinent to this indiét-  
ment; and that it will be far from the  
wifdom, the learning, and the inte-  
grity of this place, to impute to the  
  
iving what zea] in its fury may have  
done, what nature may late taken  
off, and piety interred ; or what war  
alone may have deftroyed, alone de-  
pofited.  
  
As to the circumftances that have  
been raked together, I have nothing  
to obferve, but that all circumftances  
whatfoever are precarious, and have  
been too frequently found lamenta-  
bly fallible ; even the ftrongett pare  
  
failed : They may rife to the uttott  
depree of probability, yet are they  
  
The Montbly Mifeellany,  
  
but probability ftill, Why need I  
name your lordfhip the two Harri-  
fon’s, recorded in Dr. Howel, who  
both fuffered upon circumilances, be-  
caufe of the fudden difappearance of  
their lodger ; who was in credit, had  
contraéed debts, borrowed money,  
and went off unfeen, and returned a-  
gain a great miany years after their  
execution ? Why name the intricate  
affair of Jacques du Moulin, under  
King Charles II. related by a gentle-  
man who was counfel for the crown ?  
And why the unhappy Coleman, who  
futlered innocent, tho’ convicted up-  
on pofitive evidence, and whote chil-  
dren perifhed for want, becauie the  
world uncharitably believed the fa-  
ther guilty ? Why mention the per-  
jury ot Smith, incautioufly admitted  
na evidence ; who, to fcreen him-  
felt, equally accufed Faircloth and  
Loveday of the murder of Dunn; the  
hrit of whom, in 1749, was executed  
at Winchelter ; and Loveday was 2-  
bout to fuffer at Reading, had not  
Smith been ptoved perjured, to the  
fatisfa€tion ot the court, by the fur-  
geon of the Gofport hofpital.  
  
Now, my lord, having endeavoured  
to thew that the whole of this procefs  
is altogether repugnant to every part  
of my life; that it is inconfiftent  
with my ¢eondition of health about  
that time; that no rational inference  
can be drawn, that a perfon is dead,  
who fuaddenly difappears ; that her-  
mjtages were the conftant repofitories  
of the boues of the reclufe ; that the  
proofs of this are well aythenticated ;  
that the revolutions in religion, or  
the fortune of war, has mangled or  
buried the dead; the conclufion re-  
mains perhaps no lefs reafonably than  
impatiently with&#x27;d for. I, laft, after  
a year’s confinement, equal to either  
fortune, put myfelf upon the candor,  
the juftice, and the humanity of your

trymen, gentlemen of the jury

Firft, My Lord, the whole Tenor of my Con-  
duct in Lite, contradicts every Particular of this  
Indictment. Vet I had never ſaid this, did not  
my preſent Circumſtances extort it from me, and  
ſeem to make it Neceſſary. Permit me here, my  
Lord, to call upon Malignity itſelf, jſo long and  
cruelly buſied in this Proſecution, to charge upon  
me any Immorality, of which Preju ſice was not  
the Author. No, my Lord, I concerted not  
de hemes ot Fraud, projected no Violence, injured  
no Man&#x27;s Perton or 2 My Days were ho-  
neſtly laborious, my Nights intenſely ſtudious,  
And, I humbly conceive, my Notice of this, eſpe-  
cially at this Time, will not be thought imperti-  
nent, or unfeaſonable ; but, at leait, deſerving  
ſome Attention: Becauſe, my Lord, that any  
  
Perfon, after a temperate Uſe of Lite, a Series of  
  
  
ſingle Deviation from Sobriety, ſhould plunge into  
the very Depth ot Profligancy, precipitately and  
at Unce, is altogether improbable and unprece-  
dented, and abiolutely inconſiſtent with the Courſe  
of 1 hings. Mankind is never corrupted at «nce ;  
Viliany is always progreflive and declines from  
Right, Step atter Step, till every Regard of Pro-  
bity ix lott, and every Sente of all moral Obliga-  
tion totally perithes,  
  
C Again  
  
; ( 26 )  
Again, my Lord, a Sutpicion of this Kind,  
which nothing but Malevolence could entertain,  
and Ignorance propogate, is violently oppoſed by  
my very Situation at that I ime, with Reſpe&amp;t to  
Health : For but a little Space before, I had been  
confined to my Bed, and 1uttered jmuch under a  
very long and ſevere Diſorder, and was not able,  
for half a Year together, ſo much as to walk.  
Ihe Diſtemper left me indeed, yet flowly and in  
Part; but ſo macerated, fb enfeebled, that I was  
reduced to Crutches ; and was ſo far from bein  
well about the Time] am charged with this Fact,  
that I never to this Day perfectly recovered.  
Could then a Perſon in this Condition take any  
Thing into his Head ſo unlikely, ſo extravagant?  
I, paſt the Vigour of my Age, feeble and valetu-  
dinary, with no Inducement to engage, no Abili-  
ty to accomplith, no Weapon wherewith to per-  
Detrate ſuch a Fact; without Intereſt, without  
ower, without Motive, without Means.  
  
Beſides, it muſt needs occur to every one, that  
an Action of this attrocious Nature is never heard  
of, but, when its Springs are laid open. it appears  
that it was to ſupport ſome Indolence, or 1ujply  
ſome Luxury, to jatisfy ſome Avarice, or oblige  
ſome Malice; to prevent ſome real, or ſome ima-  
ginary Want: Let! lay not under the Influence  
of any one of theſe. Surely, my Lord, I may,  
conſiſtent with.both Truth and Modeſty, affirm  
thus much ; and none who have any Yeracity;  
and kiew me, will ever queſtion this.

and too notorious to require Inſtances :* Yet, ſu-  
perceding many, permit me to produce a very re-  
cent one, and that affor-ied by this Cattle. _  
  
In June, 17 57, William Thompſon, tor all the Vi-  
gilance of this Place, in open Day-light, and dou-  
  
  
ing an immediate Enquiry ſet on Foot, the ſtrict-  
eſt Search, and all Advertiſements, was never ſeen  
or heard of ſince. If then Thompſon got off un-  
ſeen, through all theſe Difficulties, how very eaſy  
was it forClark, when none of them oppoſed him?  
But what would be thought of a Proſecution com-  
menced againſt any one ſeen laſt with Thompſon  
Permit me, next, my Lord, to obſerve a little  
upon the Bones which have been diſcovered. It  
is ſaid, which perhaps is ſaying very far, that theſe  
are the Skeleton of a Man. Tis poſſible indeed  
it may . But is there any certain known Criterion,  
which inconteſtibly diſtinguiſhes the Sex in Human  
Bones? Let it be conſidered, my Lord, whether  
the aſcertaining of this Point ought not to precede  
any Attempt to indentity them:  
he Place of their Depoſitum too claims muclr  
more Attention than is commonly beſtow&#x27;d upon  
it : For, of all Places in the World,. none could  
have mentioned any one, wherein there was great-  
er Certainty of finding. Human Bones, than an  
Hermitage; except he ſhould point out a Church-  
yard. Hermitages Time paſt, beingnot only Places  
of religious Retirement, but of Burial too: And  
it has ſcarce or never been heard of, but that eve  
Cell, now known, contains, or contained, thefe  
Relicts of Humanity; ſome mutilated, and ſome  
entire. I do not inform, but give me Leave to  
remind, your Lordſhip, that here fat ſolitary  
  
628)  
SanQity, and bere the Hermit. or the Anchorefſi  
hoped that Repoſe for their Bones, when dead,  
they here enjoyed when living.  
  
I this while, my Lord, Lam ſenfible this is  
  
  
better than I. But it ſeems neceſſary to my Caſe  
that others, who have not-at all, perhaps, advert-  
ed to things of this Nature, and may have Concern  
in my Trial, ſhould be made acquainted with it.  
Suffer me then, my Lord, to produce a few of  
many Evidences, that theſe Cells. were uſed as  
Repofitories of the Dead; and to enumerate a  
few, in which Human Bones have been found,  
as it happened in this Queſtion ; leſt, to ſome,  
that Accident might ſeem extraordinary, and,  
conſequently, occaſion Prejudice. *

at Guiſcliff near Warwick, as appears from the  
Authority of Sir William Dugdale.  
  
2. The Bones, thought to be thoſe of the An-

William of Lindkolm, a Hermit, who had. long  
made this Cave his Habitation.

es, Is the Invention of theſe Bones ſorgatten, then.  
or induſtriouſly concealed, that the Diſcovery , of  
  
his thoſe in Quſtion may appear the more ſingular  
  
dor and extraordinary? Whereas, in Fact, there is no-  
  
a- thing extraordinary in it. My Lord, almoſt every  
  
nes Place conceals ſuch Remains. In Fields, in Hills  
in Highway Sides, in Commons, lie frequent and  
unſutpected Bones, And our preſent Allotments  
  
Another Particular ſeems not to claim a little of

ample occurs of more than one Skeleton being  
found in one Cell; and in the Cell in Queſtion was  
found but one ; agreable, in this, to the Peculiari-  
ty of every other known Cell in Britain. Not the  
Invention of one Skeleton, then, but of two  
would appeared ſuſpicious and uncommon.  
  
But then, my Lord, to attempt to indentify  
theſe, when even to indentify living Men ſome-  
times has proved ſo difficult, as in the Caſe of  
Perkin Warb.ck and Lambert Symnel at home, and  
of, Don Sebaſtian abroad, will be looked upon,  
perhaps, as an Attempt to determine what is in-  
determinable. And I hope-too it will not paſs  
unconſidered here, where Gentlemen believe with  
Caution, think. with Reaſon, and decide with

ation can only appear to eternal Om»iſcience-  
  
Permit me, my Lord, alſo, very kumbly to re-  
monltrate, that, as Human Bones appear to have  
been the inſeparable Adjuncts of every Cell, even  
any Perſon&#x27;s naming 1uch a Place at Random as  
containing them, in this Cate, ſhews him rather  
unfortune than conſcious preſcient, and tha! theſe  
Attendants on every Hermitage only accidenta&#x27;ly  
concurred with this Conjecture. A mere calual  
Coincidence ot Words and Things.  
  
But it ſeems another Skeleton has been diſco-  
vered by ſome Labourer, which was full as con-  
  
fident:&#x27;y averred to be Clark&#x27;s as this. My Lord,  
muſt ſome of the Living, if it promotes tome Jn-  
tereſt, be made anſwerable for all the Bones that  
Earth has concealed, and Chance expoſed ?. And

eidentially to name where Bones lie, that accident-  
ally to find where they lie?  
  
Here too is a human Skull produced, which  
is fractured; but was this the Cauſe, or was it the  
Conſequence of Death; was it owing to Violence,  
or was it the Effect of natural Decay? It it was  
Violence, was that Violence before or after Death ?  
My Lord in. May, 1732 the Remains of William  
Lord Archbithop ot this Province were taken up,  
by Permiſſion, in this Cathedral, and the Bones  
of the Skull were found broken; yet certainly he  
died hy no Violence offered to kim alive, that  
could occaſion that Fracture there. |  
  
Let it be conſidered; my Lord, that, upon the  
Diſſolution of Religious Houſes, and the Com-  
mencement-of the Reformation, the Ravages cf  
thoſe Times both affected the living and the dead.  
In Search after imaginary Treaſures, Coffins were  
broken up, Graves and Vaults dug open, Monu-  
ments ranſack&#x27;d, and Shrines. demoliſhed; your  
Lordſhip knows. that theſe Violations proceeded  
fo far, as to occaſion Parliamentary Authori&#x27;y to

the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. I entreat your-  
Lordihip- ſuffer not the Violences. the Depradae.

m | Again, my Lord, a ſuſpicion of this kind, whith  
i dthing but malevolence could entertain, and ig-  
ol drance propagate, is violently oppoſed by my  
al ry ſituation at that time, with reſpect to health:  
* r but a little ſpace before, I had been confined  
my bed, and ſuffered under a very lon  
al ad ſevere diſorder, and was not able, for half a  
- Far together, ſo much as to walk. The diſtem-  
icteſer left me indeed, yet ſlowly and in part; but  
wh macerated, ſo enfeebled, that I was reduced to  
utches; and was ſo far from being well about  
e time I am charged with this fact, that I ne-  
Er to this day pertectly recovered. Could then  
perſon in this condition take any thing into bis  
ad fo unlikely, ſo extravagant? J, paſt the vi-  
zur of my age, feeble and valetudinary, with  
Id inducement to engage, no ability to accom»

ation Wat it was to ſupport ſome indolence, or ſupply  
8 me luxury, to ſatisfy ſome avarice, or oblige  
  
me malice; to prevent ſome real, or ſome ima-  
nary want: Yet I lay not under the influence  
any one of theſe. Surely, my Lord, I may,

In the ſecond place, the diſappearance of Clark\M.  
is ſuggeſted as an argument of his being dead:  
But the uncertainty of ſuch an inference from  
that, and the fallibility of all concluſions of ſuch 2  
ſort, from ſuch a circumſtance, are too obvious  
and too notorious to require inſtances: Yet, ſu  
preceding many, permit me to produce a very  
recent one, and that afforded by this Caſtle. 4  
In June, 1757, William Thompſon, for all the  
vigilance of this place, in open day-light, and  
double - ironed, made his eſcape; and, not with.  
ſtanding an immediate inquiry ſet on foot, the  
ſtricteſt ſearch, and all advertiſements, was never

« Firſt, my lord, the whole tenor of my con-  
duct in life contradicts every particular of this  
indictment, Yet I had never ſaid this, did not  
my preſent circumſtances extort it from me, and  
ſeem to make it neceſſary. Permit me here, my  
lord, to call upon malignity itſelf, fo long and  
cruelly buſied in this proſecution, to charge upon  
me any immorality, of which prejudice was not  
the author. No, my lord, I concerted no ſchemes  
of fraud, projected no violence, injured no man&#x27;s  
perſon or property. My. days were honeſtly la-  
borious, my nights intenſely ſtudious. And I  
humbly conceive, my notice of this, eſpecially  
at this time, will not be thought impertinent, or  
unſeaſonable ; but, at leaſt, deſerving ſome at-  
tention: becauſe, my lord, that any perſon, after  
a temperate uſe of life, a ſeries of thinking and  
acting regularly, and without one ſingle devia-  
tion from ſobriety, ſhould plunge into the very  
depth of profligacy, precipitately and at once,  
is altogether improbable and unprecedented, and  
abſolutely inconſiſtent with the courſe of things.  
Mankind is never corrupted at once: villainy is  
always progreſlive, and declines from right, ſtep  
by ſtep, till every regard of probity is loſt, and  
every ſenſe of all moral obligations totally pe-  
riſhes.  
  
Again,  
  
( 73 )  
  
« Again, my lord, a ſuſpicion of this kind,  
which nothing but malevolence could entertain,  
and ignorance propagate, is violently oppoſed by  
  
my very fituation at that time, with reſpect to  
health : for, but a little ſpace before, I had been  
confined to my bed, and ſuffered under a very  
long and fevere diſorder, and was not able, for  
half a year together, ſo much as to walk. The  
diſtemper left me indeed, and yet flowly and in  
part: but ſo macerated, ſo enfeebled, that I was  
reduced to crutches; and was fo far from being  
well about the time I am charged with this fact,  
that I never to this day perfectly recovered,  
Could then a perſon in this condition take any  
thing into his head ſo unlikely, fo extravagant?  
I, paſt the vigour of my age, teeble and valetudi-  
nary, with no inducement to engage, no ability  
to accompliſh, no weapon wherewith to perpe-  
trate ſuch a fact; without intereſt, without power,  
without motive, without means.  
  
« Beſides, it muſt needs occur to every one,  
that an action of this atrocious nature is never  
heard of, but when its ſprings are laid open, it  
appears that it was to ſupport ſome indolence, or  
ſupply ſome luxury; to ſatisfy ſome avarice, or  
oblige ſome malice; to prevent ſome real, or ſome  
imaginary want: yet I lay not under the influ-  
ence of any one of theſe. Surely, my lord, I  
may, conſiſtent with both truth and modeſty,  
affirm thus much; and none who have any vera-  
city, and know me, will ever queſtion this,  
  
In the ſecond place, the diſappearance of  
Clarke-is ſuggeſted as an argument of his being  
dead: but the uncertainty of ſuch an inference  
tom that, and the Ty of all e  
  
| | D

of ſuch ſort from ſuch a circumſtance, are too  
obvious, and too notorious, to require inſtances ;  
yet ſuperceding many, permit me to produce a  
Very recent one, and that afforded by this caſtle.  
  
In June, 1757, William Thompſon, for  
all the vigilance of this place, in open day-light,  
and double-ironed, made his eſcape; and not-  
withſtanding an immediate enquiry ſet on foot,  
the ſtricteſt ſearch, and all advertiſement, was  
never ſeen or heard of ſince. If then Thomp-  
ſon got off unſeen, through all theſe difficulties,  
how very eaſy was it for Clarke to abſcond, when  
none of them oppoſed him? But what would be  
thought of a proſecution commenced againſt any  
one ſeen laſt with Thompſon ?  
  
« Permit me, next, my lord, to obſerve a  
little upon the bones which have been diſcovered.  
It is ſaid, which perhaps is ſaying very far, that  
theſe are the ſkeleton of a man. It is poſſible  
indeed they may; but is there any certain known  
criterion, which inconteſtibly diſtinguiſhes the  
ſex in human bones? Let it be conſidered, my  
Jord, whether the aſcertaining of this point ought  
not to precede any attempt to identify them.  
  
« The place of their depoſitum too claims  
much more attention than is comu:only beſtowed  
upon it: for of all places in the world, none  
could have mentioned any one, wherein there  
was a greater certainty of finding human bones,  
than a hermitage; except he ſhould point out a  
church-yard. Hermitages, in time paſt, being  
not only places of religious retirement, but of  
burial too. And it has ſcarce ever been heard of,  
but that every cell nuw known, contains, of con-  
tained, theſe relicks of humanity ; ſome muti-  
  
| lated,  
  
( 75)  
  
lated, and ſome entire, I do not inform, but  
  
ive me leave to remind your lordſhip, that here  
Fat ſolitary ſanctity, and here the hermit or the  
anchoreſs hoped that repoſe for their bones, when  
dead, they axe enjoyed when living.  
  
All this while, my lord, I am ſenſible this  
is known to your lordſhip, and many in this  
court, better than I. But it ſeems neceſſary to  
my caſe, that others, who have not at all, per-  
haps, adverted to things of this nature, and may  
have concern in my trial, ſhould be made ac-  
quainted with it, Suffer me then, my lord, to  
produce a few of many evidences, that thoſe  
cells were uſed as repoſitories of the dead, and  
to enumerate a few, in which human bodies have  
been found, as it happened in this in queſtion :  
leſt, to ſome, that accident might ſeem extra-  
ordinary, and, conſequently, occaſion prejudice,  
  
1. The bones, as was ſuppoſed of the Saxon,  
St. Dubritius, were diſcovered buried in his cell  
at Guy&#x27;s cliff, near Warwick, as appears from  
the authority of Sir William Dugdale.  
  
2. The bones, thought to be thoſe of the  
anchoreſs Roſia, were but lately diſcovered in a  
cell at Roy ſtan, entire, fair, and undecayed,  
though they muſt have lain interred ſeveral cen-  
turies, as is proved by Dr. Stukely. |  
  
3. But our own country, nay, almoſt this  
neighbourhood, ſupplies another inſtance: for in  
January 1747, was found by Mr, Stovin, ac-  
companied by a reverend gentleman, the bones,  
in part, of ſome recluſe, in the cell at Lindholm,  
near Hatfield. They were believed to be thoſe  
of William of Lindholm, a hermit, who had  
long made this cave his habitation,  
  
E 2 : 2. © In  
  
( 76 )  
  
4. In February, 1744, part of Woburn-  
abbey being pulled down, a large portion of a  
corpſe appeared, even with the fleſh on, and which  
bore cutting with a knife: though it is certain  
this had lain above 100 years, and how much  
longer is doubtful; for this abbey was founded  
in 1145, and diſſolved in 1538 or 9.  
  
«© What would have been ſaid, what believed,  
if this had been an accident to the bones in  
queſtion ?  
  
*« Further, my lord, it is not yet out of living  
memory, that a little diſtance from Knareſbo-  
rough, in a field, part of the manor of the wor-  
thy and patriot baronet who does that borough  
the honour to repreſent it in parliament, were  
found, in digging for gravel, not one human  
ſkeleton only, but five or fix depoſited fide by  
fide, with each an urn placed on its head, as  
your lordſhip knows was uſual in ancient inter.  
ments,  
  
% About the ſame time, and in another field,  
almoſt cloſe to this borough, was diſcovered  
alſo, in ſearching for gravel, another human  
ſkeleton ; but the piety of the ſame worthy gen-  
tleman ordered both pits to be filled up again;  
commendably unwilling to diſturb the dead.  
  
Is the invention of theſe bones forgotten,  
then, or induſtriouſly concealed, that the diſ-  
covery of thoſe in queſtion may appear the more  
ſingular and extraordinary? Whereas, in fact,  
there is nothing extraordinary in it. My lord,  
almoſt every place conceals ſuch remains, In  
fields, in hills, in highway ſides, in commons,  
lie frequent and unſuſpected bones. And our  
preſent allutment for reſt for the departed, is but  
of ſome centuries,  
  
; Another  
  
(77 )  
  
% Another particular ſeems not to claim a Tit-  
tle of your lordſhip&#x27;s notice, and that of the  
gentlemen of the jury; which 1s, that perhaps  
nv example occurs of more than one ſkeleton  
being found in one cell; and in the cell in queſ-  
tion, was found but one; agreeable, in this, to  
the peculiarity of every other known cell in Bri-  
tain, Not the invention of one ſkeleton, then,  
but of two, would have appeared ſuſpicious and  
uncommon. 5  
© But then, my lord, to attempt to identify  
theſe, when even to identify living men ſome-  
times has proved ſo difficult, as in the caſe of  
Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Symnel, at home,  
and of Don Sebaſtian abroad, will be looked up-  
on perhaps as an attempt to determine what is  
indeterminable. And I hope too it will not paſs  
unconſidered here, where gentlemen believe with  
caution, think with reaſon, and decide with hu-  
manity, What intereſt the endeavour to do this is  
calculated to ſerve, in aſſigning proper perſona-  
lity to theſe bones, whole particular appropriation  
  
can only appear to eternal omniſcience.  
  
„Permit me, my lord, alſo very humbly to  
remonſtrate, that, as human bones appear to have  
been the inſeparable adjuncts of every cell, even  
any perſon&#x27;s naming ſuch a place at random as  
containing them, in this caſe ſhews him rather  
unfortunate than conſcious preſcient: and that  
theſe attendants on every hermitage accidentally  
concurred with this conjecture, was a mere caſual  
coincidence of words and things, _  
  
„ But it ſeems another ſkeleton has been diſ-  
covered by ſome labourer, which was full as con-  
fidently averred to be Clarke&#x27;s as this. My lord,  
  
E 3 muſt  
  
.  
  
| ( 78 )  
  
muſt fome of the living, if it promotes ſome  
intereſt, be made anſwerable for all the bones  
that earth has concealed, or chance expoſed ?  
And might not a place where bones lay be men-  
tioned by a perſon by chance, as well as found  
by a labourer by chance? Or, is it more crimi-  
nal accidentally to name where bones lie, than  
accidentally to find where they lie?  
  
« Here too is a human ſkull produced, which  
is fractured; but was this the cauſe, or was it  
the conſequence of death? Was it owing to vio-  
lence, or the effect of natural decay? If it was  
violence, was that violence before or after death ?  
My lord, in May 1732, the remains of William  
Jord archbiſhop of this province were taken up,  
by permiſſion, in this cathedral, and the bones  
of the {kul] were found broken: yet certainly he  
died by no violence offered to him alive, that  
could occaſion that fracture there,  
  
Leet it be conſidered, my lord, that upon the  
diſſolution of religious houſes, and the commence-  
ment of the reformation, the ravages of thoſe  
times, both affected the living and the dead. In  
fearch after imaginary treaſutes, coffins were  
broken up, graves and vaults dug open, monu-  
ments ranſacked, and ſhrines demoliſhed; your  
 Jordſhip knows that theſe violations proceeded fo  
far, as to occaſion parliamentary authority to  
reſtrain them; which it did, about the beginning  
of the reign of queen Elizabeth. I entreat your  
lordſhip, ſuffer not the violences, tne depreda-  
tions, and the iniquities of thoſe times to be im-  
puted to this, |  
  
« Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant  
that Knareſborough had a caſtle; which though  
  
nuw  
  
(79)  
mow run to ruin, was once conſiderable both for  
its ſtrength and garrifon. All know it was vi-  
gorouſly beſieged by the arms of the parliament:  
at which fiege, in ſallies, conflicts, flights, pur-  
ſuits, many fell in ail the places round it; and  
where they fell they were buried; for every place,  
  
  
queſtionleſs, of theſe reſt yet unknown, whole  
bones futurity ſhall diſcover.  
  
I hope, with all imaginable ſubmiſſion, that  
what has been ſaid will not be thought imperti-  
nent to this indictment; and that it will be far  
from the wiſdom, the learning, and the integrity  
of this place, to impute to the living what zeal  
in its fury may have done; what nature may have  
taken off, and piety interred ; or what war alone  
may have deſtroyed, alone depoſited.  
  
„As to the circumſtances that have been  
raked together, I have nothing to obſerve, but  
that all circumſtances whatſoever are precarious,  
and have been but too frequently found lamentably  
fallible ; even the ſtrongeſt have failed. They  
may riſe to the utmoſt degree of probability; yet  
they are but probability ſtill. Why need I name  
to your lordſhip the two Harriſons recorded in  
Dr. Howel, who both ſuffered upon circum-  
ſtances, becauſe of the ſudden diſappearance of  
their lodger, who was in credit, had contracted  
debts, borrowed money, and went off unſeen,  
and returned again a great many years after their  
execution? Why name the intricate affairs of  
Jacques de Moulin, under king Charles II, re-  
lated by a gentleman who was counſel for the  
crown? and why the unhappy Coleman, who  
tuftered innocent, though convicted upon po-  
  
E 4 ſive  
  
( 8 )  
  
poſitive evidence, and whoſe children periſhed for  
want, becauſe the world uncharitably believed  
the father guilty? Why mention the perjury of  
Smith, incautiouſly admitted king&#x27;s evidence;  
who, to ſcreen himſelf, equally accuſed Fair-  
cloth and Loveday of the murder of Dunn ; the  
firſt of whom in 1749, was executed at Win-  
cheſter; and Loveday was about to ſuffer at  
Reading, had not Smith been proved perjured,  
to the ſatisfaCtion of the court, by the ſurgeon of  
the Goſport hoſpital?  
  
* Now, my lord, having endeavoured to ſhew,  
that the whole of this proceſs is altogether repug-  
nant to every part of my life; that it is in-  
conſiſtent with my condition of health about that  
time; that no rational inference can be drawn,  
that a perſon is dead who ſuddenly diſappears ;  
that hermitages were the conſtant repoſitories of  
the bones of the recluſe; that the proofs of this  
are well authenticated; that the revolutions in  
religion, or the fortune of war, has mangled, or  
buried, the dead: the concluſion, remains, per-  
haps, no leſs reaſonably, than impatiently withed  
for. I, at laſt, after a year&#x27;s confinement, equal  
to either fortune, put myſelf upon the candour,  
the juſtice, and the humanity of your Lordſhip,  
and upon yours, my countrymen, gentlemen of  
the jury.”

an inference from that, and the ——  
of all conclufions of fuch a fort from fuc  
a circumitance, are too obvious, and too  
notorious, to require initances : yet, fuper-  
feding many, permit me to produce a very  
yecent one, and that afforded by this caftle.  
  
¢In June, 1757, William Thompfon,  
for all thg vigilance of this place, in open  
day-light, and doubied-ironed, made  
his eicape ; and, noiwithftanding an im-  
mediate inquiry fet on foot, the ftrifteit  
fearch, and all adver:iement, was never  
feen or heard of iince. If then Thomp-  
fon got off unfcen, through all thefe d ffi-  
culues, how very ealy was it for Clark,  
when none of them oppofed him? But  
what would be thought of a profecution  
comm« need againft any one feen laft with  
Thompton ?  
  
« Permit me, next, my Lord, to obferve  
a little upon the bones which have been  
difcovered. It is faid, which perhaps is  
faying very far, that thefe are the fkeleton  
of a man. It is poffible indeed it may :  
but is there any certain known criterion,  
which inconteftably diftinguithes the fex in  
human bones? Let it be confidered, my  
Lord, whether the afcertaining of this  
point ought not to precede any attempt to  
identify them.  
  
* The place of their depofitum too  
claims much more attention than is com-  
monly beftowed upon it: for, of all places  
in the world, none could have mentioned  
any one, wherein there was greater cer-  
tainty of finding human bones, than a her-  
mitage 5 except he fhould point out a  
church-yard; hermitages, in time pait, be-  
ing not onty places of religious retirement,  
but of burial too. And it has fearce or  
never been heard of, but that every ceil,  
now known, contains, or contained, thefe  
relics of humanity ; fome mutilated, and  
fome intire. Ido not inform, but give me  
Jeave to remind your Lordthip, that here  
fat folitary fanétity, and here the hermit,  
or the anchorefs, hoped that repofe for their  
bones, when dead, they here enjoyed when  
living.  
  
¢ All this while, my Lord, I am fenfible  
this is known to your Lordthip, and many  
in this Court, better than I. But it feems  
neceffary to my cafe, that others, who have  
not at all, perhaps, adverted to things of  
this nature, and may have concern in my  
trial, thould be made acquainted with it.  
Suffer me then, my Lord, to produce a few  
of many evidences, that thefe cells were  
ufed as repofitories of the dead, and to  
enumerate a fev, in which human bones  
have been found, as it happened in this in  
quettion ; left, to fome, that accident might

feem extraordinary, and, confequently,  
occafion prejudice.  
  
1. The bones, as was fuppofed, of the  
Saxon, St. Dubritius, were difcovered bu-  
ried in his cell at Guy’s cliff, near War-  
wick, as appears from the authority of Sir  
William Dugdale.  
  
2. The bones, thought to be thofe of the  
anchorefs Rx, were but lately difCovercd  
in a cell at Royfton, intire, fair, snd unde-  
cayed, though they mutt have lain iaterred  
for feveral centuries, as is proved by Dr.  
Stukelv.  
  
3. But our own country, nay, almoft  
this neighbourhood, fupplies another in-  
ftance : for, in January, 174.7, were found  
by Mr. Stovin, accompanied by a reve-  
rend Gentleman, the bones, in part, of  
fome reclufe, in the cell at Lindholm, near  
Hatfield. They were believed to be thofe  
of William of Lindholm, a hermit, who  
had long made this cave his habitation.  
  
4-In February 1744, part of Wooburn-  
abbey being pulled down, a large portion  
of a corpfe appeared, even with the flefla  
on, and which bore cutting with a knife ;  
though it is-certain this had lain above two  
hundred years, and how much longer is  
doubtful ; for this abbey was founded in  
13145, and diffolved in 1538 or 9.  
  
© What would have been faid, what be-  
lieved, if this had been an accident to the  
bones in queftion ?  
  
* Further, my Lord, it is not yet out of  
living memory, that at a little diilance  
from Knarefborough, in a field, part of the  
manor of the worthy and patriot Baronet,  
who does that borough the honour to re-  
prefent it in Parliament, were found, in  
digeing for gravel, not one human {kele-  
ton only, but five or fix, depofited fide by  
  
fide, with each an urn placed at his head,  
as your Lordfhip knows was utual in an-  
cient interments.  
  
* About the fame time, and in another  
field, almoft clofe to this borough, was  
difcovered alfo, in fearching for gravel,  
another human fkeleton ; but the piety of  
the fame worthy Gentleman ordered both  
the pits to be filled up again, commendably  
unwilling to difturb the dead.  
  
© Is the invention of thefe bones forgot-  
ten, then, or induftrioufly concealed, ‘that  
the difcovery of thofe in queition may ap-  
pear the more fingular and extraordinary ?  
Whereas, in fast, there is nothing extra-  
ordinary in it. My Lord, almoit every  
place conceals fuch remains. In fields, in  
hills, in hich-way fides, in commons, lie  
frequent and untufpeéted bones. And our  
prefent allotments for reft for the departed  
are but of dome centuries.

© Another particular feems not to claim  
a little of your Lordfhip’s notice, and that  
of the Gentlemen of the jury ; which is,  
that perhaps no example occurs of move  
than one fkeleton being found in one cell ;  
and in the cell in queftion was found but  
one; agreeable, in this, to the peculiarity  
of every other known cell in Britain, Not  
the invention of one fkeleton, then, but of  
two, would have appeared {ufpicious and  
uncommon.  
  
* But then, my Lord, to attempt to iden-  
tify thefe, when even to identify living men  
fometimes has proved fo difficult, as in the  
cafe of Perkin Warbeck and Lambert  
Symnel at home, and of Don Sebattian a-  
broad, wil] be looked upon perhaps as an  
attempt to determine what és indetermina-  
ble. And I hope too it will not pafs un-  
confidered here, where Gentlemen believe  
with caution, think with reafon, and de-  
cide with humanity, what intereft the en-  
deavour to do this is calculated to ferve, in  
affigning proper perfonality to thofe bones,  
whofe particular ———— can only  
appear to eternal Omnifcience.  
  
¢ Permit me, my Lord, alfo. very hum-  
bly to remonitrate, that, as human bones  
appear to have been the infeparable ad-  
junéts of every cell, even any perfon&#x27;s  
naming fuch a place at random as con-  
taining them, in this cafe, fhews him ra-  
ther unfortunate than con{cious prefcient,  
and that thefe attendants on every hermi-  
tage only accidentally conctured with this  
conjecture. A mere cafual coincidence of  
words and things.  
  
« But it feems another fkeleton has been  
difcovered by fome labourer, which was  
full as confidently averred to be Clark’s as  
this. My Lord, mutt fome of the living,  
if it promotes fome intereft, be made an-  
fiverable for all the bones that earth has  
concealed, and chance expofed? And  
might not a place where bones lay be  
mentioned by a perfon by chance, as well  
as found by a labourer by chance? Or is  
it more criminal accidentally to name where  
bones lie, than accidentally to find where  
they lie ?  
  
“ Here too is a human fkull produced,  
which is fraétured ; but was this the caufe,  
or was it the confequence of death ; was it  
owing to violence, or was it the efte&amp;t of  
natural decay ? If it was violence, was  
  
that violence befcre or after death? My  
Lord, in May 1732, the remains of Wil-  
jiam, Lord Axchbithop of this province,  
were taken up, by permiffion, in this ca-  
thedral, and the bones of the tkull were  
found broken ; yet cestainly he died by no  
  
violence offered to him alive, that could  
occafion that fracture there. .  
  
‘Let it be confidered, my Lord, that,  
upon the diflolution of religious houles,  
and the commencement of the Reforma-  
tion, the ravages of thofe times both af-  
feéted the living and the dead. In fearch  
after imaginary treafures, coffins were bro-  
ken up, graves and vaults dug open, mo-  
numents ranfacked, and fhrines demolifhed ;  
your Lordthips knows that thefe violations  
proceeded fo far, as to occafion Parliamen-  
tary authority to reftrain them; and it  
did, about the beginning of the reign of  
  
ween Elifabeth. I intreat your Lordfhip  
futfer not the violences, the depredations,  
and the iniquities of thof times to be im-  
puted to this.  
  
* Moreover, what Gentleman here is ig-  
norant that Knaresborough had a cattle;  
which, though now a ruin, was once con-  
fiderabie botk for its ftrength and garrifon.  
All know it was vigoroufly befieged by the  
arms of the Parliament ; at which fiege, in  
fallies, conflicts, flights, purfuits, many fell  
in all the places round it ; and where they  
fell were buried ; for every place, my  
Lord, is burial earth in war ; and many,  
quettionlefs, of thele reft yet unknown,  
whofe bones futurity fhall difcover.  
  
‘I hope, with all imaginable fubmif-  
fion, that what has been {aid will not be  
thought impertinent to this indi&amp;ment ;  
and that it will be far from the wifdom,  
the learning, and the integrity of this  
place, to impute to the living what zeal in  
its fury may have done ; what nature may  
have taken off, and piety interred ; or  
what war alone may have deftroyed, alone  
depofited.  
  
‘ As to the circumitances that have  
been raked together, I have nothing to ob-  
ferve, but that all circumftances whatle-  
ever are precarious, and have been but too  
frequently found lamentably fallible ; even  
the itrongeft have failed. ‘They may rife  
to the utmoft degree of probability ; yet  
are they but probability fill. Why need  
Tname to your Lordfhip the two Harrifons  
recorded in Dr. Howel, who both fuffered  
upon circumftances, becaufe of the fudder  
difappearance of their lodger, who was in  
credit, had contracted debts, borrowed mo-  
ney, and went off unften, and returned a-  
gain a great many years after their exeou-  
tion? Why name the intricate affair of  
Jacques du Moulin, under King Charles  
II, related by a Gentleman who was Coun-  
cil for the Crown ? And why the unhap-

day was about to fuffer at Reading, had  
not Smith been proved perjured, to the fa-  
tisfaction of the Court, by the furgeon of  
the Golport hofpital ?  
  
‘ Now, my Lord, having endeavoured  
to fhew that the whole of this procefs is al-  
together repugnant to every part of my  
life; that it is inconfiftent with my condi-  
tion of health about that time; that no  
yational inference can be drawn, that a  
perion is dead who fuddenly difappears ;  
that hermitages were the conitant repofito-  
ries of the bones of the reclufe; that the  
proofs of this are well authenticated ; that  
the revolutions in religion, or the fortune  
ot war, have mangled, or buried, the dead ;  
the conclufion remains, perhaps, no lels  
reafonably than impatiently withed for. I,  
lait, after a year’s confinement, equal to  
either fortune, put myfelf upon the can-  
dour, the juftice, and the humanity of your  
Lordihip, and upon yours, my country-

Firſt, My Lord, the whole tenor of my  
conduct in life, contradicts every particular of  
this indictment. Yet I had never ſaid this,  
  
did not my preſent circumſtances extort it from  
me, and feem to make it neceſſary. Permit

me here, my Lord, to call upon malignit;  
itſelf, ſo long and cruelly buſied in this pro.  
ſecution, to charge upon me any immorality,  
of which prejudice was not the author. No,  
my Lord, I concerted not ſchemes of fraud,  
projected no violence, injured no man&#x27;s perſon  
or property. My days were honeſtly labori-  
ous, my nights intenſely ſtudious. And, I  
humbly conceive, my notice of this, eſpecially  
at this time, will not be thought impertinent,  
or unſeaſonable; but, at leaſt, deſerving ſome  
attention: Becauſe, my Lord, that any per-  
  
  
thinking and acting regularly, and without one  
ſingle deviation from ſobriety, ſhould plunge  
into the very depth of profligacy, precipitately  
and at once, 1s altogether improbable and un-  
precedented, and abſolutely inconſiſtent with  
the courſe of things. Mankind are never cor-  
rupted at once; villany is always progreſſive  
  
  
every regard of probity is loſt, and every ſenſe  
of all moral obligation totally periſhes.  
Again, my Lord, a ſuſpicion of this kind,  
which nothing but malevolence could enter-  
tain, and ignorance propagate, 1s violently op-  
poſed by my very fituation at that time, with  
reſpect to health: For but a little ſpace before,  
I had been confined to my bed, and ſuffered  
under a very long and ſevere diſorder, and was  
not able, for half a year together, ſo much as  
to walk. The diſtemper left me indeed, yet  
Nowly and in part; but ſo macerated, fo enfee-

bled, that I was reduced to crutches; and was  
ſo far from being well about the time I am  
charged with this fact, that I never to this day  
perfectly recovered. Could then a perſon in  
this condition take any thing into his head ſo  
unlikely, ſo extravagant? I, paſt the vigour of  
my age, feeble and valetudinary, with no in-  
ducement to engage, no ability to accompliſh,  
no weapon wherewith to perpetrate ſuch a  
fact; without intereſt, without power, with-  
out motive, without means. |  
Beſides, 1t muſt needs occur to every one,  
that an action of this attrocious nature is never  
heard of, but, when its ſprings are laid open,  
it appears that it was to ſupport ſome indo-  
lence, or ſupply ſome luxury, to ſatisfy ſome  
avarice, or oblige ſome malice; to prevent ſome  
real, or ſome imaginary want: Yet I lay not  
under the influence of any one of theſe. Sure-  
ly, my Lord, I may, conſiſtent with both truth  
  
  
who have any veracity, and knew me, will  
ever queſtion this.  
  
In the ſecond place, the diſappearance of  
Clark 1s ſuggeſted as an argument of his being  
dead: But the uncertainty of ſuch an inference  
from that, and the fallibility of all conclu-  
ſions of ſuch a ſort, from ſuch a circumſtance;  
are too obvious, and too notorious to require  
inſtances: Yet, ſuperſeding many; permit me  
to produce a very recent one, and that afforded  
by this Caſtle. |

retirement, but of burial too: And it has

3- But our own country, nay, almoſt thi;  
neighbourhood, ſupplies another inſtance: for  
in January, 1747, was found by Mr. Stovin,  
accompanied by a reverend gentleman, the  
bones in part, of ſome recluſe in the cell at  
Lindholm, near Hatfield. They were believed  
to be thoſe of William of Lindholm, a hermit,  
who had long made this cave his habitation.  
4. In February, 1744, part of Woburn- Ab-  
bey being pulled down, a large portion of a  
corple appeared, even with the fleſh on, and  
which bore cutting with a knife; though it is  
certain this had laid above 200 years, and how  
much longer is doubtful; for this Abbey was  
founded in 1145, and diffolved in 1538 or 9.  
  
W hat would have been ſaid, what believed,  
if this had been an accident to the bones in  
queſtion ?  
  
Farther, my Lord, it is not yet out of liv-  
ing memory, that a little diſtance from Knareſl-  
brough, in a field, part of the manor of the  
worthy and patriotic baronet, who does that  
borough the honour to repreſent it in Parlia-  
ment, were found, in digging for gravel, not  
one human ſkeleton only, but five or ſix de-  
poſited fide by fide, with each an urn placed  
at its head, as your Lordſhip knows was uſual  
in ancient interments.  
  
About the ſame time, and in another field,  
almoſt cloſe to this borough, was diſcover  
alſo, in ſearching for gravel, another human  
ſkeleton ; but the piety of the ſame worthy  
gentleman ordered both the pits to be filled  
  
W Ow Wu  
  
(  
  
up again, commendably unwilling to diſturb  
the dead.  
  
Is the invention of theſe bones forgotten,  
then, or induſtriouſly concealed, that the diſ-  
covery of thoſe in queſtion may appear the  
more fingular and extraordinary ? Whereas,  
in fact, there is nothing extraordinary in it.  
My Lord, almoſt every place conceals ſuch  
remains, In fields, in hills, in highway ſides,  
and in commons, lie frequent and unſuſpected  
bones. And our preſent allotments for reſt  
for the departed, is but of ſome centuries.  
  
Another particular ſeems not to claim a little  
of your Lordſhip&#x27;s notice, and that of the  
Gentlemen of the Jury; which is, that perhaps  
no example occurs of more than oNE ſkeleton  
being found in one cell; and in the cell in  
queſtion was found but oNE; agreeable, in this,  
to the peculiarity of every other known cell  
in Britain. Not the invention of one ſkeleton,  
then, but of two would have appeared ſuſ-  
picious and uncommon.  
  
But then, my Lord, to attempt to identify  
theſe, when even to identify living men ſome-  
times has proved ſo difficult, as in the caſe of  
Perkin &#x27;Warbeck, and Lambert Symnel at  
home, and of Don Sebaſtian abroad, will be  
looked upon, perhaps, as an attempt to deter-  
  
  
too it will not paſs unconſidered here, where  
  
gentlemen believe with &#x27;caution, think with  
  
realon, and decide with humanity, what in-  
  
tereſt the endeayour to do this is calculated to  
EY&quot;,  
  
6 8.)  
  
ſerve, in aſſigning proper perſonality to thoſe  
bones, whoſe particular appropriation can on]y  
appear to eternal Omniſcience.  
  
Permit me, my Lord, alſo, very humbly to  
remonſtrate, that, as human bones appear to  
have been the inſeparable adjuncts -# every  
cell, even any perſon&#x27;s naming ſuch a place  
  
  
ſhews him rather unfortunate than conſcious  
preſcient, and that theſe attendants on every  
hermitage only accidentally concurred with  
this conjecture. A mere caſual coincidence  
of words and things.  
  
But it ſeems another ſkeleton has buen dis  
covered by ſome labourer, which was full as  
confidently averred to be Clark&#x27;s as this. My  
Lord, muſt ſome of the living, if it promotes  
ſome intereſt, be made anſwerable for all the  
bones that earth has concealed, and chance  
expoſed? And might not a place where bones  
lay be mentioned by a perſon by chance, as  
well as found by a labourer by chance? Or, is  
it more criminal accidentally to name where  
bones he, than accidentally to find where they  
lie ?  
  
Here too is a human ſkull produced, which  
is fractured; but was this the cauſe, or was it  
the conſequence of death; was it owing to  
violence, or was it the effect of natural decay?  
  
  
My Lord, in May, 1732, the  
remains of William Lord Archbiſhop of this  
  
Province were taken up, by permiſſion, in this  
  
YES, «8 2? 3  
Cathedral, and the bones of the ſkull were  
found broken; yet certainly he died by no  
violence offered to him alive, that could. « OC=  
caſion that fracture there.  
  
Let it be conſidered, my Lord, that upon  
the diſſolution of religious houſes, and the  
commencement of the reformation, the rava-  
ges of thoſe times both affected the living and  
the dead. In ſearch after imaginary treaſures,  
coffins were broken up, graves and vaults dug  
open, monuments ranſacked, and ſhrines de-  
moliſned; your Lordſhip knows that theſe  
yiolations proceeded fo far, as to occafion Par-  
liamentary authority to reſtrain them; and it  
did, about the beginning of the reign of Queen  
Elizabeth. I entreat your Lordſhip ſuffer not  
the violences, the depredations, and the ini-  
quities of thoſe times to be imputed to this: Il  
  
Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant 10  
that Knareſbrough had a Caſtle, which, tho” |  
now a ruin, was once conſiderable both for its 140  
ſtrength and garriſon. All know it was vigo- | | |  
  
rouſly befieged by the arms of the Parliament.  
At which ſiege, in ſallies, conflicts, flights, 4  
purſuits, many fell in all the places round it; i |  
and where they fell were buried : For every 4  
place, my Lord, is burial earth in war; and  
many, queſtionleſs, of theſe reſt yet unknown,  
whole bones futurity ſhall diſcover, | ?  
I hope, with all imaginable ſubmiſſion, that  
what has been ſaid will not be thought im-  
pertinent to this indictment; and that it will | [ |  
  
be far from the n the learning, and the 1  
  
-  
  
( 34 )  
  
integrity of this place, to impute to the living  
what zeal in its fury may have done ; what  
nature may have taken off, and piety interred;  
  
or what war alone may have deſtroyed, alone  
depoſited.  
  
As to the circumſtances that have been raked  
together, I have nothing to obſerve ; but that  
all circumſtances whatſoever precarious, and  
have been but too frequently found lamentably  
fallible; even the ſtrongeſt have failed. They  
may riſe to the utmoſt degree of probability,  
  
yet are they but probability ſtill. Why need  
  
  
recorded in Dr. Howell, who both ſuffered  
upon circumſtances, becauſe of the ſudden dil.  
appearance of their lodger, who was in credit,  
had contracted debts, borrowed money, and  
went off unſeen, and returned again a great  
many years after their execution. Why name  
  
  
King Charles II. related by a gentleman who  
was Council for the Crown. And why the un-  
  
  
convicted upon poſitive evidence, and whole  
children perilhed | for want, becauſe the world  
uncharitably believed the father guilty. Why  
mention the perjury of Smith, incautiouſly ad-  
mitted King&#x27;s evidence; who, to ſcreen him-  
  
  
the murder of Dunn; the firſt of whom in  
1749, was executed at Wincheſter; and Love-  
day was about to ſuffer at Reading, had not.  
Smith been proved perjured, to the ſalisſac-  
  
1 1 . ¹ re. Ms 1  
  
&amp;.  
  
tion of the Court, by the ſurgeon of the Goſ-  
port Hoſpital. |  
  
Now, my Lord, having endeavoured to  
ſhew that the whole of this proceſs 1s altogether  
repugnant to every part of my life; that it is  
inconſiſtent with my condition of health about  
that time; that no rational inference can be  
drawn, that a perſon is dead who ſuddenly  
diſappears; that hermitages were the conſtant  
repolitories of the bones of the recluſe ; that  
the proofs of this are well authenticated; that  
the revolutions in religion, or the fortune of  
war, has mangled, or buried, the dead; the  
concluſion remains, perhaps, no leſs reaſonably  
than impatiently wiſhed for. I, laſt, after a  
year&#x27;s confinement, equal to either fortune,  
put mylelf upon the candour, the juſtice, and  
the humanity of your Lordſhip, and upon yours,  
wy countrymen, Gentlemen of the Jury.

‘ Firft, my Lord, the whole tenor of mv conduct  
in life contradicts every particular ol this indidment.  
ict I had never faid this, did not my prefent firctitn­  
ftatices extort it from me, and feetn to make it necef- 1  
fary. Permit me here, to call upon malignity itfelf, j  
fo long Si cruelly bailed in this profectition, to charge  
upon me any immorality, of which prejudice was not  
the author. No, my Lord, I concerted no fclieni*:s  
of fraud, projected no violence, injured no riian’s per­  
lon or property. My days were honeftly laborious,  
my nights intenfely ftiidious. And, I humbly con­  
ceive, my notice of this, efpecially at this time, will  
not be thougnt impertinent, or unfeafonable ; but, at  
leaf}, defervmg fome attention : becaufe, thut any  
perfon, alter a temperate ufe of life,a feries of tlunk­  
mg and atSing regularly, anil without oue fingle devi­  
ation from lobricty, Ihould plunge into die very depth  
of profligacy, precipitately and at once, is altogether  
improbable and unprecedented, and abfolutely iuton­  
filtent with the courfe of things. Mankind is never  
corrupted at once ; villainy is always progreflive, and  
declines from right, flep after &lt;lep, till every regard  
of probity is loft, &amp; every fenfeof all moral obligation  
totally pcrilhes.  
Aga.n, my Lord, a fufpicioh of this kind, which  
I nothing but malevolence could entertain, and igao­  
! ra.rce propagate, is violently oppofed byniy very fitu­  
| at ion at that time, with rcfpe&amp; to health : for, but a  
| little ipace before, I had been confined to my bed, and  
| fuflered under a very long and levere diforder, and  
. was not able, for half a year together, fo much as to  
I walk. The diftemper left me indeed, yet (lowly and  
| in part; but fo macerated,foinfeebled,that I was re­  
] duced to crutches; and was fo far from being well a­  
bout the time I ant charged with this fadl, that I ne­  
ver to this day perfe&amp;ly recovered. Could then a  
perfon in this condition take any thing into liis head fo  
unlikely,fo extravagant ? I, paft the vigour of my  
| fee ole and valetudinary, with no inducement to  
| engage, no ability to accomplifh, tio weapon where­  
■ with to perpetrate fuch a fad ; without filtered, with­  
| out power, without motive, without means.  
| Hefides, it mud needs occur to every one,that an  
! a.Stion of this attrociotis nature is never heard of, hut,  
when its fprings are laid open, it appears that it was&#x27;  
to fupport fome indolence, or fupply fome luxury, to  
fatisfy fome avarice, or oblige fome malice; to pre­  
vent fome real, or fome imaginary want: yet 1 lay  
not under the influence of any one of thefe. Surely I  
may, confident with both truth and modefty, affirm  
thus much; and rone, who have ary veracity, and  
knew roe, will ever qtiedion this.  
‘ In the feccnd place, th&quot; difappearance of Clark  
isfiggefted as an argument nf his being dead: hut  
the uncertainty of fuch an inference fiom that,and the  
fallibility of all conclufions uf fuch a fort, from tueh a  
circumftance, are too obvious, and too notoi i.ur , to re­  
quire inftances: yet, fiiperfedlng many, permit nie to  
produce a very recent one, and that ailbided by this  
cr.file. 1  
  
In June, 17.77, William Thcnipfon, Tor all the  
vigilance of this place, in open day-light, anrl doit­  
bled-ironed, made his r.fcape ; ...ml&#x27; iiutwithllandW  
an immediate inquiry fet on foot, the fiihfleft fearch  
and ell advertiffiment, was never fcen or heard of  
fine.-. If then Thompfon got off nnfeen, through all  
thefe difficulties, how very only was it for Clark, when  
nor.c of them oppofed him ? But what would be  
thought of a prolecution commenced againft any one  
feen lad with Thompfon ?  
* perniit next, my Lord,to obferve a little no­  
on the bones which have been difeovered. It is faid.  
which perhaps is faying very far, that thefe are the  
(keleton of a man. It is poffible indeed it may : hut  
j u *bere any certain known criterion, which incemetla­  
j bly diftinguifiies the fex in human hones? I.ctitbe  
ronfidered whether the afeertaining of this point ouvht  
not to precede any atrempt to identify them.  
‘ *hc l,,ace their depofitum too claims much  
more attention than is commonly bellowed upon it :  
for, of all places in the world, none coulj have menti­  
oned any one, wherein there was greater certainty of  
finding human hones, than a hermitage : except he  
fhotdd point out a rhur -h-yard : hermitages, in time  
p~ft, being not only jd it es of religious retirement, but  
of buriel too. And if L:.s fcarce or never !»een heard  
of, hut that every cell, now known,contain*, or con­  
tained, thefe relics of humanity ; fome mutilated and  
&#x27;erne irfire t do no£ inform, h»t gtVl me Icxc to  
remind your Lordfhin, that here fat folitary famftity,  
a,id here the hermit,or the anchored, hoped that re­  
poft for their bones, when dead, they here enjoyed  
when living.  
* tt,&quot;‘ w,‘ile, my Lord, 1 am fenfible this is  
known to your I-nrdihip, and many ir. this Court, bet­  
ter than to mr, But it feems nectifary to my cafe,  
ti at others, who have not at all, perhaps, adverted to  
thine* of this nature, and may have concern in my tri­  
al. ff.uuld be made acqnr.inted with it. Suffer me  
then to produce .i few of many evident es, that thefe  
tells w« re ufed r.s rt pofltories of the dead, and to enu­  
merate s few, in which human bom s have been found,  
as it happen* I in thirin queftion ; left, to fome, that  
actid* rtf irfyhr feem extraordinary, and, cenlequeutly,  
occafioti prejudice.  
I Tie Iwima.as was fuppofed, of th* Saxon. St.  
Dubritiui, were difeovered buried in his cell at (Joy&#x27;s  
ihff. nr T Warwick, as appears from the authority of  
Sir William Dngdale.  
° &#x27;I he honeX, thought to be thnfe of rh- -iniho­

j fieri, bit ire, fair, and underayed, though they mull  
: hjvr lain in*, rred for fevera! centuries&#x27;, as is proved by  
I ftr. Sfuktly. ’  
} 0 Rut our owneotmrry, nay, almoft this neigh­  
Lo&#x27; rhv.&quot; ,- j p’iti another inftai/ce s for, in January,  
  
| 1747, were found by Mf. Stoviu, ac^.mpanied by a  
reverend Gentleman,the bores, in part, of fome re­  
dufe, ir &#x27;he tell at Lindh&quot;lrt, tv-ar Hatfield. They  
believed to he thofe &lt;&gt;f William of 1 indholm, a  
hetmit, who had ior*g made this cave bis habita­  
tion.  
■i. In 1 ebtuary 1714, part of Wooburn-abbey be­  
ing pulled doe n, a large portion of a corple appeared,  
even with the fifth on, and which bore cutting with  
a knife ; though it is ccriain this had lain almve two  
hundred years, and how much longer is doubtful; for  
•bis ahbev was founded in J Ho, and diflclved in  
ln.78 nr !).  
* •*&#x27; would have been faid, what believe&#x27;!, if  
this bad been an accident to the bones in quellior. ?  
* Further, my I.ord, it is not yet out of living nit­  
mnry, that at a little diilance from Kuarefborough, in  
a tu-id, part of the manor of the worthy and patriot  
baronet, who does that borough the honour to repre­  
fent it in Parliament, were found, in digging for gra­  
vel, not one human (keleton only, but five or fix, dc­  
pofited fide by fide, with each an urn placed at his  
head. a» your Lordlhip knows was ufual in ancient in­  
terments.  
* About the fame time, and in another field, almoft  
clofe to this borough, was difeovered aifo, in fearch­  
iog for gravel, another human (keleton ; but the pie­  
ty of the fame worthy gentleman ordered both the  
pits to be filled up again, cunuuendably unwilling to  
difiurb the dead.  
Is the invention of thefe bones forgotten, then, or  
indufirioufly concealed, that the difeovery of thofe in  
quellion may appear the more fii.guk.r ar.d eu&#x27;.iaordi­  
nary ? Whereas, iu fi»Cl, than.* is nothing extraordi  
nary in it. A Inn.ft every place conceals fuch remains  
hi fields, in hills, in high-way (ides, in commons, lie  
frequent and unfufpeifted bones. Aud our prefent  
allotments for reft for the departed are but of ft,me  
centuries.  
Another particular ft tins not to claim a little of  
your Lordthip’s notice, and that of the gentlemen of  
the jury ; which is, that perhaps no example occurs of  
more than onF (keleton being found in one cell; and  
in the cell in queftiou, was found but one ; agreeable,  
in this, to the peculiarity of every other known cell in’  
Britain. Not the invention of one (keleton, then, but  
of two, would have appeared fufpicious ind uncom­  
mon.  
4 But then, my Lord, to attempt to identify thefe,  
wlun even to identify living men lomctinies has prov­  
ed fo difficult, as in the cafe of Perkin Warbeck and  
Lambert Symnel at home, and of Dan Sebaftian a­  
broad, will be looked upon perhaps as an attempt to  
determine what is indeterminable. And I hope too  
■twill not pafs unconfidered here, where Gentlemen  
believe with caution, thii.k with reafon, aiij decide  
with humanity, what intereft the endeavour to do this  
is calculated to ferve.in aligning proper perfonality to  
thofe bo.ics, whofe particular appropriation can only  
appear to eternal Omtiifcience.  
Permit me, my I.ord, alfo very humbly to re­  
monftrate, that, as human bones aj.pear to have been  
thiMnfepaiable adjuiuftsof every cell, even any per­  
fott s naming fuch a place at random as containing  
.hem, m this cafe, (hews him rather unfortunate than  
confcious prefeient, and that thefe attendants on eve­  
ry hermitage only accidentally concurred with this  
corjuiuSure. A mere cafual coincidence of words and  
th&#x27;tigs.  
‘ But if fwms annih-r fkeleton had been difeover­  
ed oy fome labourer, which was full as confidently a­  
verred to be Clark’s as this. My Lord, nuift fome of  
the living, if it promotes fome intereft, be made an­  
fwerable for all the bones that eartli has concealed, &amp;.  
chance expofed ? And might not a place where bones  
.ay be mentioned by a perfon by chance, as well as  
found by a labourer by chance ? Or is it mere cri­  
minal accidentally to name win-.- bor.es lie, than ac­  
cidentally to find where they lie ?  
4 Here too is a human (kull produced, which is  
fraftured ; but was this the caufe, or was it the con­  
fcquence of death; was it owing to violence, or was  
it the efledt of natural decay ? If it was violence, was  
that violence before or after death ? My Lord, in  
May 1732, the remains of William, Lord Arcl.bifiiop  
of this province, were taken up, by perniiffion, iu this  
cathedral, and the bones of the (kull were found bro­  
ken ; yet certainly he died by no violence offered  
to him alive, that could occafion that fraclure there.  
4 Let it be cunfidered, my Lord, that, upon the  
diffolution of religious houles, and the commence­  
ment of the Reformation, the ravages of thofe times  
both affedted the living and the dead. In fearch af­  
ter imaginary treafures, coffins were broken up,  
graves and vaults dug open, monuments ranfacked,  
fhrines demoliflied ; your Lcrdlhips knows that thefe  
violations proceeded fo far, as to occafion Parliamen-I  
tary authority to reftrain them; and it did, about!  
the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. I in­  
treat your Lordftiip fuffer not the violences, the de­  
predations, and the iniquities of thofe times to be im­  
puted to this.  
  
‘ Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant that  
Knarefliorough had a caftle ; which, though now a  
ruin, was once confiderable both for irs ftrength and  
garrifon. All know it was vigoroufly befieged by  
the arms of the Parliament ; at which fiege, in failles,  
conflicts, flights, purfuits, many fell in afi the places  
round it ; and where they fell were buried ; for eve­  
ry place is burial earth in war; and many, queftion­  
lefs, of thefe reft yet unknown, whofe bones futurity  
(hall difcover.  
‘ I hope, with all imaginable fubmiffion, that what  
ha* been laid willnot be thought impertinent to this  
indhflment ; and that it will be far from the wifdorn,  
the learning, and the integrity of this place, to im­  
i !ita to the living what zeal in its fury may have done  
—what nature may have taken off, &amp; piety interred ;  
or what war alone may have deftroyed, alone depofit­  
rd.  
• As to the circumfrance* that have been raked to­  
gether, I have nothing to obferte, but that all cir­  
cuntftances whatfoever are precarious, and have been  
but too frequently found lamentably fallible ; even  
the flrongeft have failed. They may rife to the ut­  
rrnft degree of probability; yet ate they but probabi­  
lity flill. Why need I name to your I.trdfllip the  
two I larrifons recorded in Dr. Howel, who both fuf­  
fered upon circnmftances, becaufe of the fudden difap­  
prarance of their lodger, who was in credit, had con­  
trafled debts, borrowed money, and went off ttnfeen,  
and returned again a great many years after their exe­  
cution? Why name the intricate affair of Jacques du  
Moulin, under King Charles!!, related by a Gentle­  
man who was Council for the Crown ? And why the  
unhappy Coleman, who fuffered innocent, tho’ con­  
viifled upon pofitive evidence,and whofe children •-».  
rilhed for want, becaufe the world uncharitably be­  
lieved the father guilty ? Why mention the perjury  
of .Smith, incautioufly admitted King&#x27;s evidence; v»ho,  
to fcrcen himfelf, equally accufed haircloth and i.ove­  
day of the murder of Dunn ; the firft of whom, in  
1 ”10, was executed at Winchefter ; and i.oveda-’was  
about to fuffer at Reading, had not Smith been proved  
perjured, to the £»ti*fa&lt;9ion of the Court, by the !ur­  
geon of the Gofport hofpital ?  
‘ Non&gt;, my Lord, having endeavoured to (hew that  
the whole of this prncejs is altogether repugnant to  
every part of my life ; that it isinconflflent with my  
condition of health about that time ; that no  
inference can be drawn, that a perfon is dead who  
fuddenly difappears ; that hermitages were the con­  
ftatif repofitorte., of the hones of thcredufe ; that the  
proofs of this are well authenticated ; that the revo­  
tions in religion, or the fortune of war, have mangled,  
or buried, the dead; the conelnfion remains, perhaps,  
no lefs reafonahly than impatiently wilhed for. |,  
laft, after a year’s confinement, equal to either for­  
tune, put myfelf upon the candour, the juftice, 3-,d

‘ First, my lord, the whole tenor  
of my conduct in life contradicts  
every particular of this indictment.  
Yet I had never said this, did not  
my present circumstances extort  
it from me, and seem to make it  
Necessary. Permit me here, my  
lord, to call upon malignity itself,  
So long and cruelly busied in this  
prosecution, to charge upon me  
any immorality, of which prejudice  
Was not the author. No, my lord,  
I concerted no schemes of fraud,  
projected no violence, injured no  
  
man’s person or property. My  
days were honestly laborious, my  
nights intensely studious. And, I  
humbly conceive, my notice of this,  
especially at this time, will not be  
thought impertinent, or unseason-  
able ; but, at least, deserving some  
attention : because, my lord, that  
any person, after a temperate use  
of life, a series of thinking and act-  
ing regularly, and without one sin-  
gle deviation from sobriety, should  
plunge into the very depth of pro-  
fligacy, precipitately and at once,  
is altogether improbable and un-  
precedented, and absolutely incon-  
sistent with the course of things.  
Mankind is never corrupted at  
once ; villainy is always progres-  
sive, and declines from right, step  
after step, till every regard of pro-  
bity is lost, and every sense of all  
moral obligations totally perishes.  
“ Again, my lord, a suspicion of  
this kind, which nothing but ma-  
levolence could entertain, and ig-  
norance propagate, is violently op-  
posed by my very situation at that  
time, with respect to health : for,  
but a little space before, I had been  
confined to my bed, and suffered  
under a very long arid severe dis-  
order, and was not able, for half a  
year together, so much as to walk.  
The distemper left me indeed,  
yet slowly and in part ; but so ma-  
cerated, so enfeebled, that I was  
reduced tocructhes ; and was so  
far from being well about the time  
I am charged with this fact, that I  
never to this day perfectly recov-  
ered. Could then a person in this  
condition take any thing into his  
head so unlikely, so extravagant ;  
I, past the vigour of my age, fee-  
ble and valetudinary, with no in-  
ducement to engage, no ability to  
accomplish, no weapon wherewith  
to perpetrate such a fact ; without  
intcrest, without power, without  
motive, without means ?

_.¢ Besides, it miist.needs occur  
to every one, that an action of this  
atrocious nature is never heard of,  
but, when its springs are laid opens  
it appears that it was to support  
some indolence, or supply some  
luxury, to satisfy some avarice, or  
oblige some malice ; to prevent  
some real, or some imaginary  
want: yet I jay not under the in-  
fluence of any one of these. Surely,  
my lord, I may, consistent with  
both truth and modesty, affirm  
thus much ; and none who have  
any veracity, and knew me, will  
ever question this.  
  
‘In the second place, the disap-  
pearance of Clark is suggested as  
an argument of his being dead :  
but the uncertainty of such an in-  
ference from that, and the fallibil-  
ity of all conclusions of such a sort,  
from such a circumstance, are too  
obvious, and too notorious, to re-  
quire instances : yet, superseding  
many, permit me to produce a very  
recent one, and that afforded by  
this castle.  
  
‘In June, 1757, William  
Thompson, for all the vigilance of  
this place, in open day-light, and  
double-ironed, made his escape ;  
and, notwithstanding an immedi-  
ate inquiry set on foot, the strict-  
est search, and all advertisement,  
was never seen or heard of since.  
If then Thompson got off unseen,  
through all these difficulties, how  
very easy was it for Clark, when  
none of them opposed him? But  
what would be thought of a pros-  
ecution commenced against any  
one seen last with Thompson ?  
  
‘ Permit me next, my lord, to  
Observe a little upon the bones  
which have been discovered. It  
is said, which perhaps is saying  
very far, that these are the skele-  
tonofa man. It is possible indeed  
it may: butis there any certain  
known criterion, which incontesta-  
  
bly distinguishes the sex in hu.  
man bones? Let it be considered,  
my lord, whether the ascertaining  
of this point ought not to precede  
any attempt to identify them.  
  
‘The place of their depositum  
too claims much more attention  
than is commonly bestowed upon  
it : for, of all places in the world,  
none could have mentioned any  
one, wherein there was greater  
certainty of finding human bones,  
than a hermitage ; except he  
should point out a church-yard :  
hermitages, in time past, being not  
only places of religious retirement,  
but of burial too. And it has  
scarce or never been heard of, but  
that every cell, now known, con-  
tains, or contained, these relicks  
of humanity ; some mutilated, and  
some entire. I do not inform, but  
give me leave to remind your lord-  
ship, that here sat solitary sanctity,  
and here the hermit, or the an-  
choress, hoped that repose for  
their bones, when dead, they here  
enjoyed when living.  
  
‘ All this while, my lord, I am  
sensible this is known to your lord-  
ship, and many in this court, bet-  
ter than I, But it seems necessa-  
ry to my Case, that others, who  
have not at all, perhaps, adverted  
to things of this nature, and may  
have concern in my trial, should  
be made acquainted with it. Suf-  
fer me then, my lord, to produce  
a few of many evidences, that these  
cells were used as repositories of  
the dead, and to enumerate a few,  
in which human bones _ have been  
found, as it happened in this in  
question ; lest, to some, that acci-  
dent might seem extraordinary;  
and, consequently, occasion preju-  
dice.

appears from the authority of Sir  
William Dugdale.  
  
‘2. The bones, thought to be  
those of the anchoress Rosia, were  
but lately discovered in a cell at  
Royston, entire, fair, and unde-  
cayed, though they must have lain  
interred for several centuries, as is  
proved by Dr. Stukely.  
  
‘3. But our own country, nay,  
almost this neighbourhood, sup-  
plies another instance: for, in Jan-  
uary, 1747, was found by Mr. Sto-  
vin, accompanied by a reverend  
gentleman, the bones, in part,  
of some recluse, in the cell at  
Lindholm, near Hatfield. They  
were believed to be those of Wil-  
liam of Lindholm, a hermit, who  
had long made this cave his habit-  
ation.  
  
‘4, In February, 1744, part of  
Woburn abbey being pulled down,  
a large portion of a corpse appear-  
ed, even with the flesh on, and  
which bore cutting with a knife ;  
though it is certain this had lain  
above 200 years, and how much  
longer is doubtful ; for this abbey  
was founded in 1145, and dissolved  
in 1538 or 9.  
  
‘ What would have been said,  
what believed, if this had been an  
accident to the bones in question ?  
  
‘Further, my lord, it i$ not  
yet out of living memory, that a  
little distance from  Knaresbo-  
rough, in a field, part of the ma-  
nor of the worthy and patriot  
Baronet, who does that borough  
the honour to represent it in par-  
liament, were found, in digging  
for gravel, not one human skele-  
ton only, but five or six, deposited  
side by side, with each an urn  
Placed at its head, as your lordship  
knows was usual in ancient inter-  
ments.  
  
‘ About the same time, and in  
another field, almost close to this  
borough, was discovered also, in  
scarching for gravel, another hu-  
  
man skeleton ; .but the piety of  
the same worthy ¢entleman order-  
ed both the pits to be filled up  
again, commendably unwilling to  
disturb the dead.  
  
‘ is the invention of these  
bones forgotten, then, or industri-  
ously concealed, that the discovery  
of those in question may appear  
the more singular and extraordi-  
nary? Whereas, in fact, there is  
nothing extraordinary in it. My  
Lord, almost every place con-  
ceals such remains. In fields, in  
hills, in highway sides, in com-  
mons, lie frequent and unsuspect-  
ed bones. And our present allot-  
ments for rest for the departed, is  
but of some centuries.  
  
‘ Another particular seems not  
to claim a little of your lordship’s  
notice, and that of the gentlemen  
of the jury ; which is, that perhaps  
no example occurs of more than  
one skeleton being found in one  
cell; and in the cell in question  
was found but one ; agreeable, in  
this, to the peculiarity of every  
other known cellin Britain. Not  
the invention of one skeleton, then,  
but of two, would have appeared  
suspicious and uncommon.  
  
‘ But then, my lord, to attempt  
to identify these, when even to i-  
dentify living men sometimes has  
proved so difficult, as in the case  
of Perkin Warbeck and Lambert  
Symnel at home, and of Don Se-  
bastian abroad, will be looked up-  
on perhaps as an attempt to deter-  
mine what is indeterminable.  
And I hope too it will not pass un-  
considered here, where gentlemen  
believe with caution, think with  
reason, and decide with humanity,  
what interest the endeavours to do  
this is calculated to serve in assign-  
ing proper personality to those  
bones, whose particular appropria-  
tion can only appear to eternal  
Omniscience.

very humbly to remonstrate, that,  
ws human bones appear to have  
been the inseparable adjuncts of  
every cell,even any person’s nam-  
ing such aplace at random as con-  
taining them, in this case, shews  
him rather unfortunate than con-  
scious prescient, and that these at-  
tendants on every hermitage only  
accidentally concurred with this  
copjecture. A mere casual coin-  
cidence of words and things.  
  
‘ But it seems another skeleton  
has been discovered by some Ja-  
bourer, which was full as confi-  
dently averred to be Clark’s as  
this. My Lord, must some of the  
living, if it promotes some interest,  
be made answerable for all the  
bones that earth has concealed, and  
chance exposed ? And might not  
a place where bones lay be men-  
tioned by a person by chance, as  
well as found by a labourer by  
chance? Or,is it more criminal  
accidentally to mame where bones  
lic, than accidentally to find where  
they hie?  
  
‘ Here too is a human skull pro-  
duced, which is fractured; but  
was this the cause, or was it the con-  
sequence of death ; was it owing  
  
to violence, or was it the effect of’  
  
natural decay ? Ifit was violence,  
was that violence before or after  
death ? My lerd, in May 1732,  
the remains of William Lord Arch-  
bishop of this province were taken  
up, by permission, in this cathe-  
dral, and the benes of the skull  
were found broken ; yet certainly  
he died by no violence offered to  
him alive, that could occasion that  
fracture there.  
  
‘ Let it be considered, my ford,  
that upon the dissolution of relig-  
ious houses, and the commence-  
ment of the Reformation, the ra-  
vages of these times both affected  
the living and the dead. In  
search after imaginary treasures,  
  
coffins wete broken up, #raves and  
vaults dug open, monuments ran-  
sack’d, and shrines demolished ;  
your Lordship knows that these  
violations proceeded so far, as to  
occasion parliamentary authority  
to restrain them ; and it did, about  
the beginning of the reign of  
Queen Elizabeth. 1 entreat your  
Lordship suffer not the violences,  
the depredations, and the iniquities  
of those times to be imputed to this.  
  
‘ Moreover, what . gentleman  
here is ignorant that Knaresbor-  
ough had a castle ; which, though  
now a ruin, was once considerable  
both for its strength and garrison.  
All know it was vigorously besieg-  
ed by the arms of the parliament ;  
at which siege, in-sallies, conflicts,  
flights, pursuits, many fell in all  
the places round it: and where  
they fell were buried ; for every  
place, my lord, is burial earth in  
war ; and many, questioniess, of  
these rest yet unknown, whose  
bones futurity shall discover.  
  
‘] hope, with all imaginable  
submission, that what has been  
said will not be thought imperti-  
nent to this indictment ; and that  
it will be far from the wisdom, the  
learning, and the integrity of this  
place, to impute to the living what  
zeal in Hts fury may have done ;  
what nature may have taken off,  
amd piety interred ; or what wat  
alone may have destroyed, alone  
deposited.  
  
‘ As to the cireumstances that  
have been raked together, I have  
nothing to observe ; but that all  
circumstances whatsoever are pre-  
carious, and have beer but too fre-  
quently found lamentably fallible ;  
even the strongest have failed. ‘They  
may rise to the etmost degree of  
probability ; yet are they but pro-  
bability still. Why need I name  
to your lordship the two Harr  
sons recorded in Dr. Howel, whe

both suffered on circumstances,  
because Of the sudden disappear-  
ance of their lodger, who was in  
credit, had contracted debts, bor-  
rowed money and went off unseen,  
and returned again a great many  
years after their execution ? Why  
name the intricate affair of Jacques  
du Moulin, under King Charles IT.  
elated by a gentleman who was  
council for the crown? and why  
the unhappy Coleman, who suffer-  
ed innocent, though convicted up-  
on positive evidence, and whose  
children perished for want, be-  
cause the world uncharitably be-  
lieved the. father guilty. Why  
mention the perjury of Smith, in-  
cautiously admitted King’s evi-  
dence ; who, to screen himself,  
equally accused Faircloth and  
Loveday of the murder of Dunn ;  
the first of whom, in 1749, was  
executed at Wincester; and Love-  
day was about to suffer at Read-  
ing, had not Smith been proved  
perjured, to the satisfaction of  
the court, by the surgeon of the  
Gosport hospital.

¢ Now, my lord, having endeav-  
oured to shew that the whole of  
this process is altogether repug-  
nant to every part of my life ;  
that it is inconsistent with my con-  
dition of health about that time ;  
that no rational inference can be  
drawn, that a person is dead who  
suddenly disappears ; that hermi-  
tages were the constant reposito-  
ries of the bones of the recluse ;  
that the proofs of this are well au-  
thenticated ; that the revolutions  
in religion, or the fortune of war,  
has mangled, or buried, the dead ;  
the conclusion remains, perhaps,  
no less reasonably than impatiently  
wished for. I, last, after a year’s  
confinement,equal to either fortune,

justice and the humanity of your

‘* First, my lord, the whole tenor of my conduct in life  
contradicts every particular of this indictment. Yet had I  
never said this, did not my present circumstances extort it  
from me, and seem to make it necessary. Permit me here,  
my lord, to call upon malignity itself, so long and cruelly  
busied in this prosecution, to charge upon me an immorali-  
ty, of which prejudice was not the author. No, my lord, I  
concerted no schemes of fraud ; projected no violence ; in-  
jured no man’s person or private property ; my days were  
honestly laborious, my nights intensely studious. And I  
humbly conceive my notice of this, especially at this time,  
will not be thought impertinent, or unseasonable ; but, at  
least deserving some attention, because, my lord, that any  
person, alter a temperate use of life, aseries of thinking and  
acting regularly, and without one single deviation from so-  
briety, should plunge into the very depth of profligacy, pre-  
cipitatcly, and at once, is altogether improbable and unpre-  
cedented, and absolutely inconsistent with the course of  
things. Mankind is never corrupted at once ; villainy is  
always progressive, and declines from right, step after step,  
till every regard of probity is lost, and every sense of all  
moral obligation totally perishes.  
  
* Again, my lord, asuspicion of this kind, which nothing  
but malevolence could entertain, and ignorance propagate, is  
violently opposed by my very situation at that time, with re-  
spect to health; for but a little space before I had been con-  
fined to my bed; and suffered under a very long and severe  
disorder, and was not able, for half a year ‘together, so much  
as to walk. The distemper left me indeed, yet slowly and  
in part; but so macerated, so enfeebled, that I was reduc-  
ed to crutches; and so far from being well about the time  
I am charged with this fact, that I ney er, to this day, per-  
fectly recovered. Could thena person in this condition take  
any thing i into his head so unlikely, so extravagant? I, past  
the vigour of my age, feeble and valetudinary, with no in-  
ducement to engage, no ability to accomplish, no weapon  
wherewith to perpetrate such a fact; without interest, with-

* Besides, it must needs occur to every one, that an ac-  
tion of this atrocious nature is never heard of but, when its  
springs are laid open, it appears that it was to support  
some indolence, or supply some luxury ; to satisfy some av-_

PERMIT me, next, my lord, to observe a little upon the  
bones which have been discovered. It is said, which per-  
haps is saying very far, that these are the skeleton of a man.  
It is possible indeed it may; but is there any certain crite-  
rion, which incontestibly distinguishes the sex in human  
bones? Let it be considered, my lord, whether the ascer-  
taining of this point ought not to precede any attempt to  
identity them.  
  
‘* The place of their depositum too claims much more  
attention than is commonly bestowed upon it; for, of all  
places in the world, none could have mentioned any one,  
wherein there was greater certainty of finding human bones,  
than a hermitage, except he should point out a church-  
yard; hermitages, in time past, being not only places of  
religious retirement, but of burial too. And it has scarce,  
or never been heard of, but that every cell now known con-  
tains, or contained those relics of humanity ; some mutilated  
and some entire. Ido not inform, but give me leave to re-  
mind your lordship, that here sat solitary sanctity, and here  
the hermit, or the anchoress, hoped that repose for their  
bones, when dead, they here enjoyed when living.  
  
** All the while, my lord, I am sensible this is known to  
your lordship, and many in this court, better than to me.  
But it seems necessary to my case that others, who have not  
at all, perhaps, adverted to things of this nature, and may  
have concern in my trial, should be made acquainted with  
it. Suffer me then, my lord, to produce a few of many  
evidences, that these cells were used as repositories of the  
dead, and to enumerate a few in which human bones have

been found, as it happened in this question; lest, to some,  
that accident might seem extraordinary, and, consequently,  
occasion prejudice.  
  
1. “ The bones, as was supposed, of the Saxon St. Du-  
britus, were discovered buried in his cell at Guy’s cliff, near  
Warwick, as appears from the authority of Sir William  
Dugdale.  
  
2. “ The bones, thought to be those of the anchoress  
Rosia, were but lately discovered in a cell at Royston, en-  
tire, fair, and undecayed, though they must have lain inter-  
red for several centuries, as is proved by Dr. Stukely.  
  
3. “ But my own county, nay, almost this neighbour-  
hood, supplies another instance, for in January, 1747, were  
found, by Mr. Stovin, accompanied by a reverend gentle-  
man, the bones, in part, of some recluse, in the cell at  
Lindholm, near Hatfield. They were believed to be those  
of William of Lindholm, a hermit, who had long made  
this cave his habitation.  
  
4. “In February, 1744, part of Wooburn-abbey being  
pulled down, a large portion of a corpse appeared, even  
with the flesh on, and which bore cutting with a knife ;  
though it is certain that this had lain above 200 years, and  
how much longer is doubtful, for this abbey was founded  
in 1145, and dissolved in 1538 or 9.  
  
“ What would have been said, what believed, if this had  
been an accident to the bones in question?  
  
“« Farther, my lord, it is not yet out of living memory,  
that a little distance from Knaresborough, in a field, part of  
the manor of the worthy and patriotic baronet who does that  
borough the honor to represent it in parliament, were found,  
in digging for gravel, not one human skeleton only, but  
five or six, deposited side by side, with each an urn placed  
at its head, as your lordship knows was usual in ancient  
interments.  
  
“ About the same time, and in another field, almost  
close to this borough, was discovered also, in searching for  
gravel, another human skeleton; but the piety of the same  
worthy gentleman ordered both pits to be filled up again,  
commendably unwilling to disturb the dead.  
  
** Is the invention of these bones forgotten, then, or in-  
dustriously concealed, that the discovery of those in ques-  
tion may appear the more singular and extraordinary ?  
whereas, in fact, there is nothing extraordinary in it. My  
lord, almost every place conceals such remains. In fields,

* But it seems another skeleton has been discovered by  
some labourer, which was full as confidentially averred to  
be Clark’s as this. My lord, must some of the living, if it  
promotes some interest, be made answerable for all the  
bones that earth has concealed, and chance exposed? and  
might not a place where bones lay be mentioned by a person  
by chance, as well as found by a labourer by chance? or is  
it more criminal accidentally to name where bones lie, than  
accidentally to find where they lie‘  
  
** Here too is a human skull produced, which is fractured,  
but was this the cause, or was it the consequence of death?  
was it owing to violence, or was it the effect of natural  
decay ? if it was violence, was that violence before or after  
death? My lord, in May, 1732, the remains of Wilham,  
lord archbishop of this province, were taken up, by per-  
mission, in this cathedral, and the bones of the skull were  
found broken ; yet certainly he died by no violence offered  
to him alive that could occasion that fracture there.  
  
** Let it be considered, my lord, that upon the dissolution  
of religious houses, and the commencement of the reforma-  
tion, the ravages of those times affected both the living and  
the dead. In search after imaginary treasures, coffins were  
broken open, graves and vaults dug open, monuments ran-  
sacked, and shrines demolished; and it ceased about the  
beginning of the reign of queen Elizabeth. I entreat your  
lordship, suffer not the violences, the depredations, and the  
iniquities of those times, to be imputed to this.  
  
‘* Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant that  
Knaresborough had a castle; which, though now a ruin,  
was once considerable both for its strength and garrison?  
All know it was vigorously besieged by the arms of the  
parliament ; at which siege, in sallies, conflicts, flights,  
pursuits, many fell in all the places round it, and where

they fell were buried; for every place, my lord, is burial  
earth in war; and many, questioniess, of these, yet unkuown,  
whose bones futurity shall discover.  
  
“{ hope; with all imaginable submission, that what has  
been said will not be thought impe ‘tinent to this indicement;  
and that it will be far from the wisdom, the learning, and  
the integrity of this place, to impute to the living what zeal  
in its fury may have done; what nature may have taken off,  
and piety interred; or what war alone may have destroyed,  
alone deposited.  
  
“ As to the circumstances that have been raked together,  
I have nothing to observe, but that all circumstances what  
ever are precarious, and have been bat too frequently fouad  
lamentably fallible; even the strongest have failed. They  
may rise to the utmost degree of probability, yet they are  
but probabitity still Why need I name to your lordship the  
two Harrisons recorded by Dr. Howel, who both suftered  
upon circumstances, because of the sudden disappearance  
of their lodger, whe was in credit, had contracted debts,  
borrowed money, and went off unseen, and returned a great  
many years after their execution? © Why name the intricate  
affair of Jacques du Moulin, under king Charles [1- related  
by a gentleman who was counsel for the crown? and why  
the unhappy Coleman, who suffered innocent, though con-  
victed upon positive evidence, and whose children*perished  
for want, because the world uncharitably believed the father  
guilty? Why mention the perjury of Smith, incautiously  
admitted king’s evidence ; who, to s¢reen himself, equally  
accused Faircloth and Loveday of the murder of Dun; the  
first of whom, in 1749, was executed at Winchester; and  
Loveday was about to suffer at Reading, had not Smith  
been proved perjured, to the satisfaction of the court, by  
the surgeon of Gosport hospital?  
  
“ Now, my lord, having endeavoured to shew that the  
whole of this process is altogether repugnant to every part  
of my life; that it is inconsistent with my condition of  
health about that time; that no rational inference can be  
drawn, that a person is dead who suddenly disappears ; that  
hermitages were the constant repositories of the bones of  
the recluse ; that the revolutions in religion, or the fortune  
of war, have matigled, or buried the dead; the conclusion  
remains perhaps no less reasonably than impatiently wished  
for. 1, at last; after a year’s confinemen!, equal to either  
  
fortune, put myself upon the candour, the justice, and the

we shall give his defence, which he delivered into the court in  
writing.  
  
‘s First, my Lord, the whole tenor of my conduct in life contra-  
dicts every particular of this indictment. Yet I had never said  
this, did not my present circumstances extort it from me, and  
seem to make it necessary. Permit me here, my Lord, to call  
upon malignity itself, so long and cruelly busied in this prosecu-  
tion, to charge on me any immorality, of which prejudice was  
not the author. No, my Lord, I concerted not schemes of fraud,  
projected no violence, injured no man’s person or property. My  
days were honestly laborious, my nights intensely studious. And  
I humbly conceive, my notice of this, especially at this time, will  
not be thought impertinent, or unseasonable ; but, at least, de-  
serving some attention: because, my Lord, that any person, after  
a temperate use of life, a series of thinking and acting regularly,  
and without one single deviation from sobriety, should plunge into  
the very depth of profligacy, precipitately and at once, is altogether  
  
  
  
72 Trial and Defence [8  
  
improbable and unprecedented, and absolutely inconsistent with  
the course of things. Mankind is never corrupted at once; vil.  
lany is always progressive, and declines from right, step by step,  
till every regard of probity is lost, and every sense of all moral  
obligations totally perishes.  
  
s Again, my Lord, a suspicion of this kind, which nothing but  
malevolence could entertain, and ignorance propagate, is violen  
opposed by my very situation at that time, with respect to health;  
for, but a little space before, I had been confined to my bed, and  
suffered under a very long and severe disorder, and was not able,  
for half a year together, so much as to walk. The distemper left  
me indeed, yet slowly and in part; but so macerated, so enfeebled,  
that I was reduced to crutches; and was so far from being well  
about the time I am charged with this fact, that I never to this  
day perfectly recovered. Could then a person in this condition  
take any thing into his head so unlikely, so extravagant ? I, past  
the vigor of my age, feeble and valetudinary, with no inducement  
to engage, no ability to accomplish, no weapon wherewith to per-  
petrate such a fact; without interest, without power, without  
motive, without means.  
  
«s Besides, it must needs occur to every one, that an action of  
this atrocious nature is never heard of, but, when its springs are  
laid open, it appears that it was to support some indolence, or  
supply some luxury; to satisfy some avarice, or oblige some ma-  
lice; to prevent some real, or some imaginary want: yet I :  
not under the influence of any one of these. Surely, my Lord,  
may, consistent with both truth and modesty, affirm thus much;  
and none who have any veracity, and knew me, will ever question  
this.  
  
‘¢ In the second place, the disappearance of Clark is suggested  
as an argument of his being dead : but the uncertainty of such an  
inference from that, and the fallibility of all conclusions of such  
sort,.from such a circumstance, are too obvious, and too notori-  
ous, to require instances: yet, superseding many, permit me to  
produce a very recent one, and that afforded by this castle.  
  
«In June, 1757, William Thompson, for all the vigilance of  
this place, in open day-light, and double-ironed, made his es-  
cape ; and, notwithstanding an immediate enquiry set on foot,  
the strictest search, and all advertisement, was never seen nor  
heard of since. If then Thompson got off unseen, through all  
these difficulties, how very easy was it for Clark, when none of  
them opposed him! But what would be thought of a prosecution  
commenced against any one seen last with Thompson ?

which have been discovered. It is said, which perhaps is saying

very far, that these are the skeleton of a man. It is possible in-  
deed it may: but is there any certain known criterion, which  
incontestibly distinguishes the sex in human bones? Let it be  
considered, my Lord, whether the ascertaining of this point ought  
not to precede any attempt to identify them.

used as repositories of the dead, and to enumerate a few, in which  
human bodies have been found, as it happened in this in question ;  
lest, to some, that accident might seem extraordinary, and, conse-  
quently, occasion prejudice.  
  
‘1, The bones, as was supposed, of the Saxon, St. Dubritius,  
were discovered buried in his cell at Guy’s cliff, near Warwick, as  
appears from the authority of Sir William Dugdale.  
  
«2. The bones, thought to be those of the anchoress Rosia,  
were but lately discovered in a cell at Royston, entire, fair, and  
undecayed, though they must have lain interred for several centu-  
nies, as is proved by Dr. Stukely.  
  
‘* 3. But our own country, nay, almost this neighborhood, sup-  
plies another instance: for in January, 1747, was found by Mr.  
Stovin, accompanied by a reverend gentleman, the bones, in part,  
6f some recluse, in the cell at Lindholm, near Hatfield. They  
were believed to be those of William of Lindholm, a hermit, who  
had long made this cave his habitation.  
  
“4, In February, 1744, part of Woburn abbey being pulled  
down, a large portion of a corpse appeared, even with the fleshon,  
and which bore cutting with a knife ; though it is certain this had  
Jain above 100 years, and how much longer is doubtful ; for this  
abbey was founded in 1145, and dissolved in 1538 or 9.

conscious prescient, and that these attendants on every hermitage  
accidentally concurred with this conjecture. A mere casual coin-

«s But it seems another skeleton has been discovered by some  
Jaborer, which was full as confidently averred to be Clark’s as  
this. My Lord, must some of the living, if it promotes some  
interest, be made answerable for all the bones that earth has con-  
cealed, and chance exposed ? And might not a place where bones  
lay be mentioned by a person by chance, as well as found by a  
Laborer by chance? Or, is it more criminal accidentally to name  
where bones lie, than accidentally to find where they lie ?  
  
« Here too is a human skull produced, which is fractured; but  
was this the cause, or was it the consequence of death? was it  
owing to violence, or the effect of natural decay? If it was vio-  
lence, was that violence before or after death? My Lord, in May,  
1782, the remains of William Lord Archbishop of this province  
were taken up, by permission, in this cathedral, and the bones.of  
the skull were found broken : yet certainly he died by no violence  
offered to him alive, that could occasion that fracture there.  
  
« Let it be considered, my Lord, that, upon the dissolution of  
religious houses, and the commencement of the reformation, the  
ravages of those times both affected the living and the dead. In  
search after imaginary treasures, coffins were broken up, graves  
and vaults dug open, monuments ransacked, and shrines demo-  
lished ; your lordship knows that these violations proceeded so far,  
as to occasion parliamentary authority to restrain them; and it did,  
about the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. I entreat  
  
lordship, suffer not the violences, the depredations, and the  
iniquities of those times to be imputed to this.  
  
s Moreover, what gentleman bare is ignorant that Knaresho-  
rough had a castle; which, though now run to ruin, was once  
considerable both for its strength and garrison? All know it was  
vigorously besieged by the arms of the parliament : at which siege,  
in sallies, conflicts, flights, pursuits, many fell in all the places  
round it; and where they fell were buried; for every place, my  
Lord, is burial earth in war ; and many, questionless, of these rest  
yet unknown, whose bones futurity shall discover.  
  
* I hope, with all imaginable submission, that what has been  
said will not be thought impertinent to this indictment; and that  
it will be far from the wisdom, the learning, and the integrity of  
this place, to impute to the living what zeal in its fury may have  
done, what nature may have taken off, and piety interred ; or what  
war alone may have destroyed, alone deposited.  
  
** As to the circumstances that have been raked together, I  
have nothing to observe ; but that all circumstances whatsoever  
are rious, and have been but too frequently found lamentably  
fallible 5 even the strongest haye failed. They may rise to the  
utmost degree of probability; yet are they but probability still.

Why need I name to your lordship the two Harrisons recorded jn  
Dr. Howel, who both suffered on circumstances, because of the  
sudden disappearance of their lodger, who was in credit, had con.  
tracted debts, borrowed money, and went off unseen, and returned  
again a great ~~ a after their execution? Why name the  
intricate affairs of Jacques de Moulin, under King Charles II,  
related by a gentleman who was counsel for the crown? and why  
the unhappy Coleman, who suffered innocent, though convicted  
upon positive evidence, and whose children perished for want,  
because the world uncharitably believed the father guilty? Why  
mention the perjury of Smith, incautiously admitted king’s evi.  
dence ; who, to screen himself, equally accused Faircloth and  
Loveday of the murder of Dunn; the first of whom, in 1749, was  
executed at Winchester; and Loveday was about to suffer at  
Reading, had not Smith been proved perjured, to the satisfaction  
of the court, by the surgeon of the Gosport hospital ?  
  
« Now, my Lord, having endeavored to show that the whole of  
this process is altogether repugnant to every part of my life; that  
it is inconsistent with my condition of health about that time;  
that no rational inference can be drawn, that a person is dead who  
suddenly disappears ; that hermitages were the constant reposito-  
ries of the bones of the recluse; that the proofs of this are well  
authenticated ; that the revolutions in religion, or the fortune of  
war, has mangled, or buried, the dead; the conclusion remains,  
perhaps, no less reasonably than impatiently wished for. I, last,  
after a year’s confinement, equal to either fortune, put myself  
upon the candor, the justice, and the humanity of your lordship,  
and upon yours, my countrymen, gentlemen of the jury.

* *}irst, my lord, the whole tenor of my conduct in life contra  
  
UsslZes,  
  
  
  
——— —_  
  
dicts every particular of this indictment. Yet had I never said this,  
did not my present circumstances extort it from me, and seem to  
make it necessary. Permit me here, my lord, to call upon malignity  
itself, so long and cruelly busied in this prosecution, to charge upon  
me any immorality, of which prejudice was not the author. No,  
my lord, | concerted no schemes of fraud, projected no violence, in-  
jured no man’s person or private property ; my days were honestly  
laborious, my nights intensely studious. And I humbly conceive  
my notice of this, especially at this time, will not be thought imper-  
tinent or unseasonable, but at least deserving some attention; be-  
cause, my lord, that any person, after a temperate use of life, a series  
of thinking and acting regularly, and without one single deviation  
from sobriety, should plunge into the very depth of profligacy, pre-  
  
| cipitately, and at once, is altogether improbable and unprecedented,  
  
and absolutely inconsistent with the course of things. Man is  
never corrupted at once; villainy is always progressive, and declines  
from right, step after step, till every regard of probity is lost, and  
every sense of all moral obligation totally perishes.  
  
* * Again, my lord, a suspicion of this kind, which nothing but  
malevolence could entertain, and ignorance propagate, is violently  
opposed by my very situation at that time, with respect to health ;  
for but a little space before I had been contined to my bed, and suf-  
fered under a very long and severe disorder, and was not able,  
for half a year together, so much as to walk. The distemper left  
me indeed, yet slowly and in part; but so macerated, so enteebled,  
that | was reduced to crutches ; and so far from being well about  
the time 1 am charged with this fact, that 1 never, to this day, per-  
fectly recovered. Could, then, a person in this condition take any  
thing into his head so unlikely, so extravagant? I, past the vigor  
of my age, feeble and valetudinary, with no inducement to engage,  
no ability to accomplish ; without interest, without power, without  
motive, without means,  
  
“ * Besides, it must needs occur to every one, that an action of  
  
this atrocious nature is never heard of, but when its springs are laid  
open, it appears that it was to support some indolence, or supply  
some luxury; to satisfy some avarice, or oblige some malice; to  
prevent some real, or some imaginary want; yet | lay not under the  
influence of any one of these. Surely, my lord, | may, consistent with  
both truth and modesty, affirm thus much; and none who have any  
veracity, and knew me, will ever question this, ;  
  
“*Tn the second place, the disappearance of Clarke is suggested  
as an argument of his being dead; but the uncertainty of such an  
inference from that, and the fallibility of all conclusions of such a  
sort, from such a circumstance, are too obvious, and too notorious  
to require Instances ; vet, supe rseding many, pertuit me to procure  
a very recent one, and that afforded by this castle.  
  
“* In June, 1757, William Thompson, for all the vigilance of this  
place, m open daviight and double-ironed, made his escape; and  
notwithstanding an immediate inquiry set on foot, the strictest  
search, and all advertisement, was never seen or heard of since. If  
then Thompson got off unseen, through all these difficulties, how  
very easy Was it for Clarke, when none of them opposed him? But  
what would be thought of a prosecution commenced against any  
one seen last with Thompson ?  
  
‘Permit me neat, my lord, to observe a little upon the bones  
which have been discovered. It is said, which perhaps is saying  
very far, that it is the skeleton of aman. It is possible, indeed, it  
may be; but is there any certain criterion, which incontestably dis  
tinguishes the sex in human bones? Let it be considered, mv lord  
whether the ascertaining of this point ought not to precede any at  
tempt to identify them.  
  
‘The place of their depositum, too, claims much more attention  
than is commonly bestowed upon it; for, of all spots in the world  
none could have mentioned any one, wherein there was greater cer  
tainty of finding human bones, than a hermitage, exeept he should  
point out a churchyard; hermitages, in time past, being not only  
places of religious retirement, but of burial too. And it has searce,  
or never been heard of, but that every cell now known, contains, or  
contained those relies of humanity ;:  
tire. I do not inform, but give me leave to remind your lordship  
that here sat solitary sanctity, and here the hermit, or the anchoress,  
hoped that repose for their bones, when dead, they here enjoyed  
when living . ‘  
  
some mutilated, and some en  
  
** Allthe while, my lord, [ am sensible this is known to vour lord  
ship, and many in this court, better than me. But it seems neces-  
sary to my case that others, who have not at all, perhaps, adverted  
to things of this nature, and may have concern in my trial, should  
be made acquainted with it. Suffer me, then, my lord, to produce  
a few of many evidences, that these cells were used as re positories of  
the dead, and toenumerate a few in which human bones have  
found, as it happened in this question ;  
  
bee n  
lest, to some, that accident  
might seem extraor linary, and conse jue ntly oecasion prejudice

were discovered buried in his cell at Guv’s clit! near Warwick

another instance ; for in January, 1747, were found by Mr. Stovin,  
accompanied by a reverend gentleman, the bones, in part, of some

«« In June, 1757, William Thompson, amidst all the vigilance of this  
place, in open daylight, and double-iruned, made his escape ; notwith-  
standing an immediate enquiry set on foot, notwithstanding all adver-  
tisements, all search, he was never seen or heard of since. If this man  
escaped unseen through all these difficulties, how easy for Clarke, whom  
no difficulties opposed. Yet what would be thought of a prosecution  
commenced against any one seen last with Thompson ?  
  
«« These bones are discovered! Where? Of all places in the world,  
can we think of any one, except, indeed, the church-yard, where there is  
so great a certainty of finding human bones, as a hermitage? In times  
past, the hermitage was a place, not only of religious retirement, but of  
burial. And it has scarce, or never been heard of, but that every cel! now  
known, contains, or contained, these relics of humanity, some mutilated,  
some entire! Give me leave to remind your Lordship, that there sat  
soLirary sanctity, and here the hermit and the anchorite hoped that  
repose for their bones when dead they here enjoyed when living. I glance

+ My Lord, my Lord, must some of the living be made answerable  
for all the bones that the earth has concealed and chance exposed. The  
skull that has been produced has been declared fractured. But who can  
surely tell whether it was the cause or the consequence of death. In May,  
1732, the remains of William Lord, Archbishop of this province, were taken  
up, by permission, in their cathedral; the bones of the skull were found  
broken as these are. Yet he died by no violence! by no blow that could  
have caused that fracture. Let it be considered how easily the fracture  
on the skull produced is accounted for. At the dissolution of religious  
houses, the ravages of the times affected both the living and the dead. In  
search after imaginary treasures, coffins were broken, graves and vaults  
dug open, monuments ransacked, shrines demolished. Parliament itself  
was called in to restrain these violations. And now are the depredations,  
the iniquities, of those times, to be visited on this? But here, above all

** First, my lord, the whole tenor of my conduct in  
life contradicts every particular of this indictment.  
Yet I had never said this, did not my present circum-  
stances extort it from me, and seem to make it neces-  
sary. Permit me here, my lord, to call upon malignity  
itself, so long and cruelly busied in this prosecution,  
to charge upon me any immorality, of which prejudice  
was not the author. No, my lord, I concerted no  
schemes of fraud, projected no violence, injured no  
man’s person or property. My days were honestly  
laborious, my nights intensely studious, And I hum-  
bly conceive my notice of this, especially at this time,  
will not be thought impertinent or unseasonable, but  
at least deserving some attention: because, my lord,  
that any person, after a temperate use of life, a series  
of thinking and acting regularly, and without one  
single deviation from sobriety, should plunge into the  
very depth of profligacy precipitately and at once, is  
altogether improbable and unprecedented, and abso-  
lutely inconsistent with the course of things. Man-  
kind is never corrupted at once; villany is always  
progressive, and declines from right, step by step, till  
every regard of probity is lost, and every sense of all  
moral obligation totally perishes.  
  
Again, my lord, a suspicion of this kind, which no-  
thing but malevolence could entertain, and ignorance  
propagate, is violently opposed by my very situation at  
that time, with respect to health; for, but a little space  
before, I had been confined to my bed, and suffered un-  
der a very long and severe disorder, and was not able,  
for half-a year together, so much as to walk. The  
distemper left me indeed, yet slowly and in part; but  
so macerated, so enfeebled, that I was reduced to  
crutches, and was so far from being well about the time  
I am charged with this fact, that I never till this day  
perfectly recovered. Could then a person in this con-  
dition take any thing into his head so unlikely, so ex-  
travagant ? I, past the vigour of my age, feeble and  
valetudinary, with no inducement to engage, no ability  
to accomplish, no weapon wherewith to perpetrate such  
a fact ; without interest, without power, without mo-  
tive, without means,  
  
Besides, it must needs occur to every one that an  
action of this atrocious nature is never hea’ of, bu  
when its springs are laid open, it appears that it was  
to support some indolence, or supply some luxury ; to  
satisfy some avarice, or oblige some malice; to pre-  
vent some real or some imaginary want: yet I lay not  
under the influence of any one of these. Surely, my  
lord, I may, consistent with both truth and modesty,  
affirm thus much ; and none who have any veracity,  
and knew me, will ever question this.”  
  
[He then endeavours, by instances, to show that the  
disappearance of a man is but an imperfect argument  
for the supposition of his being dead.

“ Permit me next, my lord, to observe a little upon  
the bones which have been discovered, It is said,  
which perhaps is saying very far, that these are the  
skeleton of aman, It is possible indeed they may;  
but is there any certain known criterion which incon.  
testibly distinguishes the sex in human bones? Let  
it be considered, my lord, whether the ascertaining of  
this point ought not to precede any attempt to iden-  
tify them.  
  
The place of their depositum, too, claims much more  
attention than is commonly bestowed upon it; for of  
all places in the world, none could have mentioned  
any one, wherein there was greater certainty of find-  
ing human bones, than a hermitage, except he should  
point out a churchyard : hermitages, in time past, be-  
ing not only places of religious retirement, but of  
burial too, And it has scarcely ever been heard of,  
but that every cell now known contains, or contained,  
these relics of humanity; some mutilated, and some  
entire, I do not inform, but give me leave to remind  
your lordship, that here sat solitary sanctity, and here  
the hermit, or the anchoress, hoped that repose for  
their bones, when dead, they here enjoyed when living.  
  
1, The bones, as was supposed, of the Saxon St  
Dubritius, were discovered buried in his cell at Guy’s  
cliff, near Warwick, as appears from the authority of  
Sir William Dugdale.  
  
2. The bones thought to be those of the anchoress  
of Rosia, were but lately discovered in a cell at Roy-  
ston, entire, fair, and undecayed, though they must  
have lain interred for several centuries, as is proved  
by Dr Stukeley.  
  
3. But our own county, nay, almost this neighbour-  
hood, supplies another instance ; for in January 1747,  
were found by Mr Stovin, accompanied by a reverend  
gentleman, the bones in part of some recluse, in the  
cell at Lindholm, near Hatfield. They were believed  
to be those of William of Lindholm, a hermit, who  
had long made this cave his habitation,  
  
4. In February 1744, part of Woburn Abbey being  
pulled down, a large portion of a corpse appeared, even  
with the flesh on, and which bore cutting with a knife;  
though it is certain this had laid above two hundred  
years, and how much longer is doubtful; for this ab«  
bey was founded in 1145, and dissolved in 1538 or 9.  
  
What would have been said, what believed, if this  
had been an accident to the bones in question ?  
  
Further, my lord, it is not yet out of living memory,  
that a little distance from Knaresborough, in a field,  
part of the manor of the worthy and patriotic baro-  
net who does that borough the honour to represent it  
in Parliament, were found in digging for gravel, not  
one human skeleton only, but five or six deposited side  
by side, with each an urn placed on its head, as your  
lordship knows was usual in ancient interments,  
  
About the same time, and in another field almost  
close to this borough, was discovered also in searching  
for gravel another human skeleton; but the piety of  
the same worthy gentleman ordered both pits to be  
filled up again, commendably unwilling to disturb the  
dead.  
  
Is the invention of these bones forgotten, then, or  
industriously concealed, that the discovery of those in  
question may appear the more singular and extraore  
dinary ? whereas, in fact, there is nothing extraordi-  
nary in it. My lord, almost every place conceals such  
remains. In fields, in hills, in highway sides, in com-  
mons, lie frequent and unsuspected bones. And our  
present allotment of rest for the departed is but of  
some centuries,  
  
Another particular seems not to claim a little of  
your lordship’s notice, and that of the gentlemen of  
the jury; which is, that perhaps no example occurs  
of more than one skeleton being found in one cell ; and  
in the cell in question was found but one ; agreeable in  
this to the peculiarity of every other known cell in Bri-  
tain. Not the invention of one skeleton, then, but of  
two, would have appeared suspicious and uncommon,

But it seems another skeleton has been discovered  
by some labourer, which was full as confidently averred  
to be Clarke’s as this. My lord, must some of the liv-  
ing, if it promotes some interest, be made answerable  
for all the bones that earth has concealed, or chance  
exposed ? And might not a place where bones lay be  
mentioned by a person by chance, as well as found by  
a labourer by chance? Or, is it more criminal acci-

“ Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant that  
Knaresborough had a castle, which, though now run  
to ruin, was once considerable both for its strength  
and garrison? All know it was vigorously besieged  
by the arms of the Parliament ; at which siege, in sale  
  
lies, conflicts, flights, pursuits, many fell in all the  
places round it, and where they fell were buried ; for  
every place, my lord, is burial earth in war; and  
many, questionless, of these rest yet unknown, whose

to the living what zeal in its fury may have done ;  
what nature may have taken off, and piety interred ;  
or what war alone may have destroyed, alone deposited.  
  
As to the circumstances that have been raked to-  
gether, I have nothing to observe; but that all cir-  
cumstances whatsoever are precarious, and have been  
but too frequently found lamentably fallible ; even the  
strongest have failed. They may rise to the utmost  
degree of probability, yet are they but probability  
still. Why need I name to your lordship the two  
Harrisons recorded in Dr Howel, who both suffered  
upon circumstances, because of the sudden disappear-  
ance of their lodger, who was in credit, had contracted  
debts, borrowed money, and went off unseen, and re-  
turned agair a great many years after their execution ?  
Why name the intricate affairs of Jacques de Moulin,  
under King Charles II., related by a gentleman who  
‘was counsel for the crown? and why the unhappy  
Coleman, who suffered innocent, though convicted  
upon positive evidence ; and whose children perished  
for want, because the world uncharitably believed the  
father guilty ? Why mention the perjury of Smith,  
incautiously admitted king’s evidence ; who to screen  
himself, equally accused Faircloth and Loveday of the  
murder of Dun, the first of whom, in 1749, was exe-  
cuted at Winchester, and Loveday was about to suffer  
at Reading, had not Smith been proved perjured, to  
the satisfaction of the court, by the surgeon of the  
Gosport hospital ?  
  
Now, my lord, having endeavoured to show that  
the whole of this process is altogether repugnant to  
every part of my life; that it is inconsistent with my  
condition of health about that time; that no rational  
inference can be drawn that a person is dead who sud-  
denly disappears; that hermitages were the constant  
repositories of the bones of the recluse ; that the proofs  
of this are well authenticated ; that the revolutions in  
religion, orthe fortune of war, have mangled, or buried,  
the dead ; the conclusion remains, perhaps, no less  
reasonably than impatiently wished for, I, last, after  
a year’s confinement, equal to either fortune, put my-  
self upon the candour, the justice, and the humanity  
of your lordship, and upon yours, my countrymen,  
gentlemen of the jury.

to your lordship’s consideration, and that  
of this honorab.e court.  
  
“ First, my lord, the whole tenor of my  
conduct in life contradicts every partic-  
ular of thisindictment. Yet, I had never  
said this; did not my present circum-  
stances extort it from me, and seem to  
make it necessary. Permit me_ here,  
my lord, to call upon malignity itself, so  
long and cruelly busied in this prosecu-  
tion, to charge upon me any immorality  
of which prejudice was not the author.  
No, my lord, I concerted no scheme of  
fraud; projected no violence, injured no  
man’s person or private property; my  
days were honestly laborious, my nights  
intensely studious. And I humbly con-  
ceive iny notice of this, especially at this  
time, will not be thought impertinent  
or unseasonable, but at least deserving  
some attention; because, my Lord, that  
any person, after a temperate use of life,  
a series of thinking and acting regularly,  
without one single deviation from sobri-  
ety, should plunge into the very depth  
of profligacy, precipitately, and at once,  
is altogether improbable and unprece-  
dented, and absolutely incons&#x27;stent witn  
the course of things. Mankind is never  
corrupted at once; villany is always  
progressive, and declines from right, step  
after step, till every regard of probity is  
lost, and every sense of all moral obliga-  
tion totally perishes.  
  
* Again, my lord, a suspicion of this  
kind, which nothing but malevolence  
could entertain and ignorance propagate,  
is violently opposed by my very situation  
at that time, with respect to health; for,  
but a little space before, I was confined to  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
6 EUGENE ARAM.  
  
my bed, and suffered under a very long  
and severe disorder, and was not able,  
for half a year together, so much as to  
walk. The distemper left me, indeed,  
yat slowly and in part ; but so macerated,  
so enfeebled, that I was reduced to  
crutches; and so far from being well  
about the time I am charged with the  
fact, that I never, to this day, have per-  
fectly recovered. Could then a person  
in this condition, take anything into his  
head so extravagant? I, past the vigor  
of my age, feeble and valetudinary, with  
no irducement to engage, with no ability  
to accomplish, no weapon wherewith to  
perpetrate such a feat; without inter-  
est, without power, without motive, with-  
out means.  
  
“ Besides, it must need occur to every  
one, that an action of this atrocious na-  
ture is never heard of, but, when its  
springs are laid open, it appears that  
it was to support some indolence, or  
supply some luxury; to satisfy some  
avarice, or oblige some malice ; to pre-  
vent some real or some imaginary want:  
yet I lay not under the influence of  
any of these. Surely, my lord, I may,  
consistently with both truth and modesty :  
affirm this much; and none who have  
any veracity, and know me, will ever  
question it.  
  
“In the second place, the disappear-  
ance of Clarke is suggested as an argu-  
ment of his being dead; but the uncer-  
tainty of such an inference from that,  
and the fallibility of all conclusions of  
such a sort, from such a circumstance,  
are too obvious and too notorious, to  
require instances; yet, superseding ma-  
ny, permit me to procure a very recent  
one, and that afforded by this castle.  
  
“Tn June, 1757, William Thompson,  
for all the vigilance of this place, in  
open day-light, and double-ironed, made  
his escape ; and, notwithstanding an im-  
mediate inquiry set on foot, the strictest  
search and all advertisement, was never  
  
seen or heard of since. If, then, Thom  
son got off unseen through all these dith-  
culties, how very easy was it for Clarke,  
when none of them opposed him? But  
what would be thought of a prosecution  
commenced against any one seen last  
with Thompson ?  
  
Permit me next, my lord, to observe a  
little upon the bones which have been  
discovered. It is said, which perhaps  
is saying very far, that these are the  
skeleton of a man. It is possible, in-  
deed, they may; but is there any cer-  
tain criterion, which incontestably dis-  
tinguishes the sex in human bones?  
Let it be considered, my lord, whether  
the ascertaining this point ought not to  
precede any attempt to ide ntify them.  
  
“The place of their depositum, too,  
claims much more attention than is com-  
monly bestowed upon it; for of all places  
in the world none could have mentioned  
any one, wherein there was greater cer-  
tainty of finding human bones than a her-  
mitage, except he should point out a  
church-yard ; hermitages, in times past,  
being not only places of religious retire  
ment, but of burial too. And it has scarce  
or never been heard of, but that every cell  
now known, contains or contained these  
relics of humanity, some mutilated and  
some entire. I do not inform, but give  
me leave to remind your lordship, that  
here sat solitary sanctity, and here the  
hermit or the anchoress, who hoped for  
that repose to their bones, when dead,  
which they here enjoyed when living.  
  
« All the while, my lord, | am sensi-  
ble this is known to your lordship and  
many in this court, better than to me.  
But it seems necessary to my case, Mat  
others who have not at all, perhaps, ad-  
verted to things of this nature, and may  
take an interest in my trial, should be  
made acquainted with it. Suffer me,  
then, my lord, to produce a few of many  
evidences, that these cells were used as  
repositories of the dead, and to enumie

rate a few in which human bones have  
been found, as it happened in this ques-  
tion; lest to some that accident might  
seem extraordinary, and, consequently,  
occasion prejudice.  
  
Ist. The bones, as was supposed of  
the Saxon, St. Dubritius, were discov-  
ered buried in his cell, at Guy’s Cliff,  
near Warwick, as appears from the au-  
thority of Sir William Dugdale.  
  
“2d. The bones, thought to be those  
of the anchoress Rosia, were but lately  
discovered ina cell at Royston, entire,  
fair, and undecayed, though they must  
have lain interred for several centuries,  
as is proved by Dr. Stukeley.  
  
“3d. But my own country, nay,  
almost this neighborhood, supplies an-  
other instance, for, in January, 1747,  
were found, by Mr. Stovin, accompanied  
by a reverend gentleman, the bones in  
part of some recluse, in the cell at Lind-  
holm, near Hatfield. They were sup-  
posed to be those of William of Lind-  
holm, a hermit, who had long made this  
cave his habitation.  
  
“4th. In February, 1744, part of Wo-  
burn abbey being pulled down, a large  
portion of a corpse appeared, even with  
the flesh on, which bore cutting with a  
knife; though it is certain this had lain  
above two hundred years, and how much  
longer is doubtful; for the abbey was  
founded in 1145, and dissolved in 1538  
or 39.  
  
“What would have been said, what  
believed, if this had been an accident to  
the bones in question ?  
  
“ Farther, my lord, it is not yet out of  
living memory, that a little distance  
from Knaresborough, in a field, part of  
the manor of the worthy and patriotic  
baronet who does that borough the hon-  
or to represent it in parliament, were  
found, in digging for gravel, not one  
human skeleton only, but five or six,  
deposited side by side, with each an  
urn placed at its head, as your lord-  
  
ship knows was usual in ancient inter-  
ments.  
  
“ About the same time, and in another  
field, almost close to this borough, was  
discovered also, in searching for gravel,  
another human skeleton; but the piety  
of the same worthy gentleman ordered  
both pits to be filled up again, commend-  
ably unwilling to disturb the dead.  
  
Is the invention of these bones forgot  
ten, then, or industriously concealed, that  
the discovery of those in question may  
appear the more singular and extraordi-  
nary ? whereas, in fact, there is nothing  
extraordinary in it. My lord, almost  
every place conceals such remains. In  
fields, in hills, in highway sides, in  
commons, lie frequent and unsuspected  
bones. And our present allotments for  
rest for the departed, are but of some cen  
turies.  
  
“Another particular seems not to  
claim a little of your lordship’s notice,  
and that of the gentlemen of the jury  
which is, that perhaps no example oc-  
curs of more than one skeleton being  
found in one cell; and in the cell in  
question was found but one ; agreeable,  
in this, to the peculiarity of every other  
known cell in Britain. Not the inven-  
tion of one skeleton, but of two, would  
have appeared suspicious and uncommon.

*“ But it seems another skeleton has  
been discovered by some laborer, which  
was full as confidently averred to be  
Clarke’s as this. My lord, must some  
of the living, if it promotes some inter-  
est, be made answerable forall the bones  
that earth has concealed, and chance ex-  
posed? and might not a place where  
bones lay, be mentioned by a person by  
chance, as well as found by a laborer by  
chance? or is it more criminal aceciden-  
tally to name where bones lie, than ac-  
cidentally to find where they lie?

it owing to violence, or was it the effect  
of natural decay? If it was violence,  
was it before or after death? My lord,  
in May, 1732, the remains of William,  
lord archbishop of this province, were  
taken up, by permission, in this cathe-  
dral, and the bones of the skull were  
found broken; yet certainly he died by  
no violence offered to him alive, that  
could occasion that fracture there.  
  
“Let it be considered, my lord, that  
upon the dissolution of religious houses,  
and the commencement of the reforma-  
tion, the ravages of those times affected  
both the living and the dead. In search  
afte; «maginary treasures, coffins were  
broken up, graves and vaults dug open,  
monuments ransacked, and shrines de-  
molished ; and it ceased about the be-  
ginning of the reign of queen Elizabeth.  
I entreat your lordship, suffer not the  
violences, the de »predations, and iniqui-  
ties of those times to be imputed to  
this.  
  
“ Moreover, what gentleman is igno-  
rant that Knaresborough had a castle ;  
which, though now a ruin, was once  
considerable, both for its strength and  
garrison? All know it was vigorously  
besieged by the arms of parliament; at  
which siege, in sallies, conflicts, flights,  
pursuits, many fell in the places round  
it, and where they fell, were buried; for  
every place, my Bey is burial earth in  
war; and many, questionless, of these,  
rest yet unknown, whose bones futurity  
shall yet discover.  
  
“T hope, with all imaginable submis-  
sion, that what has been said will not be  
thought impertinent to this indictment ;  
and that it will be far from the wisdom,  
the learning, and the integrity of this  
place, to impute to the living, what zeal  
in its fury may have done; what nature  
may have done; what nature may have  
taken off, and piety interred; or what  
war alone may have destroyed, alone  
  
deposited.  
  
“As to the circumstances that have  
been raked together, I have nothing to  
observe, but that all circumstances what-  
ever, are precarious, and have too fre-  
quently been found lJamentably fallible ;  
even the strongest have failed. They  
may rise to the utmost degree of proba-  
bility, yet they are but probability still,  
Why need I name to your lordship the  
two Harrisons, recorded by Dr. Howel,  
who both suffered upon circumstances  
because of the sudden disappearance of  
their lodger, who was in credit, had con-  
tracted debts, borrowed money, and went  
off unseen, and returned a great many  
years after their execution ? WwW hy name  
the intricate affair of Jac ques de Moulin,  
under king Charles II., related by a gen-  
tleman w ho was coanasl for the crown ?  
and why the unhappy Coleman, who  
suffered innocent, though convicted upon  
positive evidence, and whose children  
perished for want, because the world  
uncharitably believed the father guilty ?  
Why mention the perjury of Smith, in-  
cautiously admitted king’s evidence,  
who, to screen himself, equally aceused  
Faircloth and Loveday of the murder  
of Dunn; the first of whom, in 1749,  
was executed at Winchester; and Love-  
day was about to suffer at Reading, had  
not Smith been proved to be perjured, to

geon of the Gosport hospital ?  
  
“ Now, my lord, having endeavored to  
show that the whole of this process is

life ; that it is inconsistent with my con-  
dition of health about that time; that no  
rational inference can be drawn that a  
person is dead who suddenly disappears ,  
that hermitages were the constant repos-  
itories of the bones of the recluse; that  
the revolutions in religion, or the fortunes  
of war, have mangled or buried the dead;  
the conclusion remains, perhaps no less  
reasonably than impatiently wished for.

n of St. Rob-  
ert&#x27;s Cave, where the party had no soon­  
er arrived than Aram knocked down  
Clarke and murdered him. Houseman,  
according to his own account, then retir.  
ed; but it afterwards appeared that he  
had assisted in burying the body in the  
cave. The clothes of the murdered man  
were brought to Aram&#x27;s house and burnt,  
but not without betraying the secret to  
Mrs. Aram. After this and other evi-  
dence had been givon. Aram delivered a  
written defence, in which he endeavored,  
by the exercise of much ingenuity, and  
also a show of curious learning, to make  
up for the want of exculpatory evidence:  
First, my lord, the whole tenor of my  
conduct in life contradicts every partic  
ular of this indictment. Yet I had ney­  
er said this, did not my present circum­  
stances extort it from me, and seem to  
make it necessary. Permit me here, my  
lord, to call upon malignity itself, so  
long and cruelly busied in this prosecu-  
tion, to charge upon me any immorality  
of which prejudice was not the author.  
No, my lord, I concerted no schemes of  
fraud, projected no violence, injured no  
man&#x27;s person or property. My days  
were honestly laborious, my nights in­  
tonsely studious. And I humbly con­  
ceive my notice of this, especially at this  
time, will not be thougnt impertinent or  
unreasonable, but at least deserving some  
attention, because, my lord, that any  
person after a temperate use of life, a se­  
ries of thinking and acting regularly and  
thout ole siligle eviatioll fromn sobrI  
ety should plunge into the very depth of  
profligacy precipitately and at ance, is  
altogether improbable &amp; unprecedented,  
absolutely inconsistent with the course  
of things. Man is never corrupted at  
once; villany is always progressive, and  
declines from right, step by step, till ev  
ery regard of probity is lost, and every  
sense of all moral obligation totally per-  
ishes.  
&quot;Again, my lord, a suspicion of this  
kind, which nothing but malevolence  
could entertain, and ignorance propagate,  
is vioent opposed b iay very situn  
tion at the time, with respect to health;  
for, but a little space before, I had been  
confined to my bed, and suffered under a  
ery long and severe disorder, and was  
not able, for half a year together, so  
much as to walk. The distemper left  
me, indeed, yet slowly and in part; but  
so emaciated, so enfeebled, that I was  
reduced to crutches, and was so far from  
being well about the time I am charged  
with this fact, that I have never till this  
day perfectly recovered. Could, then,  
any person in this condition lake any  
thing into his head so unlikely, so  
extravagant? I, past the vigor of  
y age, feeble and valetudinary,  
with no inducement to engage, no abili­  
ty to accomplish, no weapon wherewith  
to perpetrate such an act; without in-  
terest, without power, without motive,  
without means.  
&quot;Besides it must needs occur to eve  
ry one that an action of this atrocious  
nature is never heard of, but, when its  
springs are laid open, it appears that it  
was to support some indolence, or sup-  
ply some luxury; to satisfy some ava­  
rice, oblige some malice; to prevent some  
real or imaginary want; yet I lay not  
under the influence of any one of these.  
Surely, my lord, I may, consistent with  
both truth and modesty,amrm this much,  
and none who have any veracity, and  
know me, will ever question this.&quot;  
He thon endeavors, by instances, to  
show that the disappearance of a man is  
but an imperfect argument for the sup  
position of his being dead.!  
&quot;Permit me next, my lord, to observe  
a little upon the bones which have been  
discovered. It is said, which perhaps  
saying very far, that these are the skele  
ton of a man. It is possib  
  
they may be; but is there any certain because the worid uncharitably believed try whenever I thought best. Now that  
known criterion which incontestibly disthe father guilty? Why mention the was jest what I liked; you couldn&#x27;t

Saxon St. Dubritius were discovered bu  
ried in his cell at Guy&#x27;s Cliff, near War-  
wick, as appears from the authority of  
Sir William Dugdale.  
&quot;2. The bones thought to be those of  
the anchoress of Rosia, were but lately  
discovered in a cell at Royston, entire  
fair, and undecayed though they must  
have lain interred for several centuries,  
as is proved by Dr. Stukeley.  
23. But our own country, nay, almost  
this neighborhood, supplies another in­  
stance; for, in January, 1747, were found  
by Mr. Stovin, accompanied by a rever­  
end gentleman, the bones in part of some  
recluse, in the cell at Lindholm, near  
Hatfield. They were believed to be  
those of William of Lindholm, a hermit,  
who had long made his cave his habita­  
tion. Ia February, I741, part of wo­  
burn Abbey being pulled down, a large  
portion of a corpse appeared, even with  
the flesh on, and which bore cutting with  
a knife; though it is certain this had  
lain above two hundred yeats, and how  
much longer is doubtful; for this abbey  
was founded in 1145, and dissolved in  
1538 or &#x27;0.  
&quot;What would have been said, what be  
lieved, if this had been an accident to  
the bones in question?  
&quot;Further, my lord, it is not yet out of  
living memory, that, a little distance from  
Knaresborough, in a field, part of the  
manor of the worthy and patriotic bar-  
onet who does that borough the honor  
to represent it in Parliament, were found  
usual in ancient interments,  
&quot;About the same time, and in anoth  
er field almost close to this borough  
was  
avel.  
ety  
discovered, also, in searching for grav  
another human skeleton; but the piety  
of the same worthy gentleman ordered  
both pits to be filled up again, commend­  
ably unwilling to disturb the dead.

in one cell; and in the cell in question  
there was but one; agreeable in this to  
the peculiarity of every other known cell  
in Britain. Not the invention of one  
skeleton, then, but of two, would have ap­  
peared suspicious and uncommon.  
&quot;But it seems another skeleton has  
been discovered by some laborer, which  
was fully as confidently averred to be  
Clarke&#x27;s as this. My lord, must some of  
the living, if it promotes some interest,  
be made answerable for all the bones  
that the earth has concealed, or chance  
exposed? And might not a place where  
bones lay be mentioned by a person by  
chance, as well as found by a laborer by  
e e e o e a a e   
enance? Or, is it more criminal acei  
dentally to name where bones lie, than  
accidentally to knd where they lie?&quot;  
He then adverts to the damage found  
to have been inflicted upon the skull,  
which he shows might have been occa­  
sioned in the ravages committed at the  
Reformation.  
&quot;Moreover, what gentleman here is  
ignorant that Knaresborough had a cas­  
tle, which, though fallen to ruins, was  
once considerable, both for its strength,  
and garrison? All knew it was vigor­  
ously besieged by the arms of the Par­  
liament; at such siege, in sallies, con-  
flicts, fights, pursuits, many fell in all the  
places around it, and where they fell  
were buried; for every place, my lord,  
is burial earth in war; and many, ques-  
tionless, of these rest yet unknown,  
whose bones futurity shall discover,  
in its fury may have done; what nature  
may have taken off and piety interred;  
or what war alone may have destroyed,  
alone deposited.  
&quot;As to the circumstances that have been  
taken together, I have nothing to ob  
serve; but that all circumstances what  
soever are precarious, and have been but  
too frequently found lamentably fallible,

&quot;Now, my lord, having endeavored to  
show that the whole of this process is al  
together repugnant to every part of my

. &quot; First, niy lord, the whole tenor of uiy con  
duct of life contradicts every partioular of this  
indiotment. Yet I had never said this, did not  
my present circumstances extort it from rue, and  
seem to make it necessary. Permit me here, my  
lord, to call upon malignity itself, so long and  
cruelly busiedin this prosecution, to charge upon  
me any immorality of which prejudioe was not  
the author. No, my lord, I concerted no  
schemes of fraud, projected no violence, injured  
no man&#x27;s person or property. My days were  
honestly laborions, my nights intensely studi­  
ous. And I humbly conoeive my notice of this,  
especially at this time, will not be thought im­  
pertinent or unreasonable, but at least deserv­  
ing some attention ; because, my lord, that any  
person, after a temperate use of life, a series of  
thinking and acting regularly, and without one  
single deviation from sobriety, Bbould plunge  
into the very depth of profligacy precipitately  
and at once, is altogether improbable and un­  
precedented, and absolutely inconsistent with  
the eourse of things. Mankind are never cor­  
rupted at onoe ; villainly is always progressive,  
and declines from right, step by step, till every  
regard of probity is lost, and every sense of  
all moral obligation totally perishes.  
&quot; Again, my lord, a suspioion of this kind,  
which nothing but malevolence could entertain,  
and ignorance propagate, is violently opposed  
by my very situation at that time, with respect  
to health ; for, bat little space before, I had  
been confined to my bed, and suffered under a  
very long and severe disorder, and was not ablo,  
for half a year together, so much as to walk.  
The distemper left me, indeed, yet slowly and  
in part ; but so macerated, so enfeeblod, that I  
was reduced to crutches, and was so fur from  
being well about the time I am charged with  
this fact, that I never till this day perfectly re­  
covered. Could, then, any person in this con­  
dition take anything into his head to unlikely,  
so extravagant ? I, past the vigor of my age,  
feeble and valetudinary, with bo inducement to  
engugn, no ability to accomplish, no weapon  
wherewith to perpetrate such a fact ; without  
interest, without powor, without motive, with  
out means.  
&quot; Besides, it must needs oocur to every one  
that an action of this atrocious nature is never  
heard of, but, when its springs are laid open,  
it appears that it vtas to support some indo  
lence, or supply some luxury ; to satisfy some  
avarice, or obligo some malice ; to prevent some  
real or imaginary want : yet I lay not under the  
influence of any ono of these. Surely, my lord,  
I may, consistent with both truth and inodesty,  
affirm thus much ; and none who have any ve  
racity, and knew me, will ever quegtion this.&quot;  
Ho then endeavors, by instances, to show that  
tho disappearance of a man is but an imperfect  
argument for the supposition of his being dond.  
&quot; Permit me next, my lord, to observe a lit  
tle upon the bonos which have been discovered  
It it said, which perhaps is saying very far, that  
these are the skeleton of a man. It is possible,  
indeed, they may be ; but is there any certain  
known criterion which incontcstably distil  
guishet the box in human bones? Let it be  
considered, my lord, whether the ascertaining  
of this point ought not to procede any attempt  
to identity them.  
&quot; The plaoe of their depositum, too, claims  
much mors attontion than is commonly bestow­  
ed upon it; for, of all placet in the world, none  
  
TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. THAT  
  
could have mentioned any one wherein thero  
was greater oertainty of finding human bones  
than a hermitage, except he should point out a  
churchyard : hermitages, in times past, being  
not only places of religious retirement, but of  
burial, too ; and it has scaroely ever been heard  
of, but that every cell known contains, or con­  
tained, these relics of humanity ; soms) .muti  
lated, and some entire. I do not inform, but  
give me leave &quot;to remind your lordship, that  
here tat solitary sanctity, and hers the hermit,  
or the anohoross, hoped that repose for their  
bones, when dead, they here enjoyed whenliving.-&quot;  
i  
1. The bones, as was supposed, of the Sax  
on St. Durbritius wero discovered buried In hit  
cell at Guy&#x27;s Cliff, near Warwiok, as, appears  
from the authority of Sir Willian Dugdale.  
&quot;2. The bones thought to be those of the  
anchoress of Rosia, were but lately .djjciyrered&quot; i  
in a cell at Royston, entire, fair, and decay­  
ed, though they must have lain interred for  
several centuries, as is proved by Dr. Sukeloy.  
&#x27; 3. But our own county, nay, almost thu  
neighborhood, supplies another instance ; for,  
in January, 1747, were found by Mr. Stovin,  
accompanied by a reverened gentleman, the  
bones in part of some reoluse, m the coll at  
Lindholm, near Hatfield. They were believed  
to be those of William of Lindholm, a hermit,  
who had long mado this cavo his habitation.  
4. In Februnry, 1744, part of Wobarn  
Abbey being pulled down, a large portion of a  
corpso appeared, even with flesh on, and which  
bore cutting with a knife ; though it is cer­  
tain this had lain above two hundred years, and  
how much longer is doubtful ; for this abbey  
was founded in 1145, and dissolved in 1538 or &#x27;9.  
&quot; What would have been said, what belioved,  
if this had been an aocident to the bones la  
question ?  
&quot; Further, my lord, it is not yet out ot liv  
ing momory, that, a little distance from Knares­  
borough, in a field, part of the manor of the  
worthy and patriotio baronet who does that  
borough tho honor to represent it in Parliament,  
were found in digging for gravel, not one hu­  
man skeleton only, but five or six deposited side  
by side, with each an urn placed on its head,  
as your lordship knows was usual in anoient  
interments.  
&quot; About the same time, and in another field  
almost close to this borough, was discovered,  
also, in searching for gravel, another human  
skeleton ; but tho piety of the same worthy  
gontlomen ordered both pits to be filled up again,  
commeadably unwilling to disturb tbe dead.  
Is the invention of those bones forgotten,  
then, or industriously concealed, that the dis  
covery of these in question may appear the  
more singular and extraordinary ? whereas, in  
fact, there is nothing extraordinary in it. My  
lord, almost every place conceals such remains.  
In field, in bills, in highway sides, In com­  
mons, lie frequent and unsuspected bonos. And  
our present allotment of rest for tbe departed  
is but of some centuries. &quot; T&#x27;YC&quot;  
&quot; Another particular soems not to claim a  
little of your lordship&#x27;s notice, and that of the  
gentlemen of the jury ; which is, that perhaps  
no example occurs of more than one skeleton  
being found in one cell ; and in the cell in ques­  
tion there was but one; agreeable in this to  
the peculiarity of every other known cell in  
Britain. Not the invention of one skeleton,  
then, but of two, would have appeared sus­  
picious and uncommon.

may extract one beautiful passage :—  
  
“ First, my lord, the whole tenour of my con-  
duct in life contradicts every particular of this  
indictment. Yet I had never said this did not my  
present circumstances extort it from me and seem  
to make it necessary. Permit me here, my lord,  
to call upon Malignitly itself, so long and cruelly  
busied in this prosecution, to charge upon me  
any immorality of which Prejudice was not the  
author. No, my lord, I concerted not schemes of  
fraud, projected no violence, injured no man’s  
person or property. My days were honestly  
laborious, my nights intensely studious; and |  
humbly conceive my notice of this, especially at  
this time, will not be thought impertinent or un-  
reasonable, but at least deserving some attention.  
Because, my lord, that any person, after a tem-  
perate use of life, a series of thinking and acting  
regularly, and without one single deviation from  
sobriety, should plunge into the very depth of  
profligacy, precipitately and at once, is altogether  
improbable and unprecedented, and inconsistent  
with the course of things. Mankind are never  
corrupted at once; villainy is always progressive,  
and declines from right, step after step, till every  
regard of probity is lost, and every sense of moral  
obligation totally perishes.”

use of life, a series of thinking and acting  
regularly, and without one single deviation  
from sobriety, should plunge into the very  
depth of profligacy, precipitately and at  
once, is altogether improbable and unprec-  
edented and absolutely inconsistent with  
the course of things. ankind is never cor-  
rupted at once ; villainy is always progres.  
sive, and declines from right, step after step,  
till every regard of probity is lost and every  
sense of all moral obligations totally perishes.  
  
Again, my lord, a suspicion of this kind,  
which nothing but malevolence could enter-  
tain and ignorance propagate, is violently  
opposed by my very situation at that time  
with respect to health ; for but a little space  
before I had been confined to my bed, and  
suffered under a very ag and severe disor-  
der, and was not able, for half a year to-  
gether, so much as to walk. Could, then, a  
  
rson in this condition take anything into  
  
is head so unlikely, so extravagant? I,  
past the vigor of my age, feeble and vale-  
tudinary, with no inducement to engage, no  
ability to accomplish, no weapon wherewith  
to perpetrate such a fact ; without interest,  
without power, without motive, without  
means.  
  
Besides, it must needs occur to every one  
that an action of this atrocious nature is  
never heard of but when its springs are  
laid open it appears that it was to support  
some indolence or supply some luxury, to  
satisfy some avarice or oblige some malice,  
to prevent some real or some imaginary want ;  
yet I lay not under the influence of any  
one of these. Surely, my lord, I may, con-  
sistent with both truth and modesty, affirm  
thus much ; and none who have any veracity,  
and knew me, will ever question this.  
  
In the second place, the disappearance of  
Clark is suggested as an argument of his  
being dead ; but the uncertainty of such an  
inference from that, and the fallibility of all  
conclusions of such a sort, from such a cir-  
cumstance, are too obvious and too notorious  
to require instances ; yet, superseding many,  
permit me to procure a very recent one, and  
that afforded by this castle.  
  
In June, 1757, William Thompson, for all  
the vigilance of this place, in open daylight,  
and double-ironed, made his escape ; and,  
notwithstanding an immediate inquiry set

on foot, the strictest search, and all adver-  
tisement, was never seen or heard of since.  
If, then, Thompson got off unseen through  
all these difficulties, how very easy was it  
for Clark, when none of them opposed him !  
But what would be thought of a prosecution  
commenced against any one seen last with  
Thompson ? .  
  
Permit me, next, my lord, to observe a lit-  
tle upon the bones which have been dis-  
covered. It is said—which, as. is say-  
ing _ far-_that these are the skeleton of a  
man. It is possible, indeed, it may ; but is  
there any certain known criterion which in-  
contestably distinguishes the sex in human  
bones? Let it be considered, my lord,  
whether the ascertaining of this point ought  
not to precede any attempt to identify them.  
  
The place of their depositum, too, claims  
much more attention than is commonly be-  
stowed upon it; for of all places in the  
world, none could have mentioned any one  
wherein there was greater certainty of find-  
ing human bones than a hermitage, except  
he should point out a church-yard ; hermit-  
ages in time past being not only places of  
religious retirement, but of burial too. And  
it has scarce or never been heard of but that  
every cell now known contains or contained  
these relicts of humanity—some mutilated and  
some entire. I do not inform, but give me  
leave to remind your lordship, that here sat  
solitary sanctity, and here the hermit or  
the anchoress hoped that repose for their  
bones, when dead, they here enjoyed when  
living.  
  
  
  
THE TRUE STORY  
  
Further, my lord, it is not yet out of living  
memory that a little distance from Knares-  
borough, in a field, part of the manor of the  
worthy and patriot baronet who does that  
borough the honor to represent it in Parlia-  
ment, were found, in digging for gravel, not  
one human skeleton only, but five or six de-  
posited side by side, with each an urn placed  
at its head, as your lordship knows was usual  
in ancient interments.  
  
Is the invention of these bones forgotten.  
then, or industriously concealed, that the  
discovery of those in question mey appear the  
more singular and extraordinary ? hereas,  
in fact, there is nothing extraordinary in it.  
My lord, almost every place conceals such  
remains. In fields, in hills, in highway sides,  
in commons, lie’ frequent and unsuspected  
bones. And our present allotments for rest  
for the departed is but of some centuries.  
  
Another particular seems not to claim a  
little of a lordship’s notice, and that of  
the gentlemen of the jury, which is, that  
perhaps no example occurs of more than one  
skeleton being found in one cell ; and in the  
cell in question was found but one—agree-  
able in this to the peculiarity of every other  
known cell in Britain. Not the invention of  
one skeleton, but of two, would have ap-  
peared suspicious and uncommon.

Here, too, is a human skull produced which  
is fractured ; but was this the cause or was  
it the consequence of death? Was it owing  
to violence or was it the effect of natural de-  
cay? If it was violence, was that violence  
before or after death? My lord, in May,  
1732, the remains of William, lord archbishop  
of this province, were taken up, by permis-  
sion, in this cathedral, and the bones of the  
skull were found broken ; yet certainly he  
died by no violence offered to him alive that  
could occasion that fracture there.  
  
Let it be considered, my lord, that upon the  
dissolution of religious houses, and the coim-  
mencement of the Reformation, the ravages  
of those times affected both the living and  
the dead. In search after imaginary treas-  
ures, coffins were broken up, graves and  
vaults dug open, monuments ransacked, and  
shrines demolished ; and it ceased about the  
beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.  
I entreat your lordship suffer not the vio-  
lence, the depredations, and the iniquities of  
those times to be imputed to this,  
  
As to the circumstances that have been  
taked together, I have nothing to ob-  
serve but that all circumstances whatever  
are precarious, and have been but too fre-  
quently tound lamentably fallible ; even the  
strongest have failed. They may rise to the  
utmost degree of -—oE yet they are  
but probability still. Why need I name to  
sop lordship the two Harrisons recorded by  
  
r. Howel, who both suffered upon circum-  
stances because of the sudden disappearance  
of their lodger, who was in credit, had con-  
tracted debts, borrowed money, and went  
off unseen, and returned a great many years  
after their execution? Why name the in
