. His court attend him, as do also the foreign diplomatic corps. But as this is not indispensably required, and my finances do not admit the expence of a continued residence here, I propose to come occasionally to attend the king’s levees, returning again to Paris, distant 40 miles. This being the first trip, I set out yesterday morning to take a view of the place. For this purpose I shaped my course towards the highest of the mountains in sight, to the top of which was about a league. As soon as I had got clear of the town I fell in with a poor woman walking at the same rate with myself and going the same course. Wishing to know the condition of the labouring poor I entered into conversation with her, which I began by enquiries for the path which would lead me into the mountain: and thence proceeded to enquiries into her vocation, condition and circumstance. She told me she was a day labourer, at 8. sous or 4 d. sterling the day; that she had two children to maintain, and to pay a rent of 30 livres for her house (which would consume the hire of 75 days), that often she could get no emploiment, and of course was without bread. As we had walked together near a mile and she had so far served me as a guide, I gave her, on parting 24 sous. She burst into tears of a gratitude which I could perceive was unfeigned, because she was unable to utter a word. She had probably never before received so great an aid. This little attendrissement, with the solitude of my walk led me into a train of reflections on that unequal division of property which occasions the numberless instances of wretchedness which I had observed in this country and is to be observed all over Europe. The property of this country is absolutely concentered in a very few hands, having revenues of from half a million of guineas a year downwards. These employ the flower of the country as servants, some of them having as many as 200 domestics, not labouring. They employ also a great number of manufacturers, and tradesmen, and lastly the class of labouring husbandmen. But after all these comes the most numerous of all the classes, that is, the  poor who cannot find work. I asked myself what could be the reason that so many should be permitted to beg who are willing to work, in a country where there is a very considerable proportion of uncultivated lands? These lands are kept idle mostly for the sake of game. It should seem then that it must be because of the enormous wealth of the proprietors which places them above attention to the increase of their revenues by permitting these lands to be laboured. I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property, only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind. The descent of property of every kind therefore to all the children, or to all the brothers and sisters, or other relations in equal degree is a politic measure, and a practicable one. Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise. Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right. The earth is given as a common stock for man to labour and live on. If, for the encouragement of industry we allow it to be appropriated, we must take care that other employment be furnished to those excluded from the appropriation. If we do not the fundamental right to labour the earth returns to the unemployed. It is too soon yet in our country to say that every man who cannot find employment but who can find uncultivated land, shall be at liberty to cultivate it, paying a moderate rent. But it is not too soon to provide by every possible means that as few as possible shall be without a little portion of land. The small landholders are the most precious part of a state.—The next object which struck my attention in my walk was the deer with which the wood abounded. They were of the kind called ‘Cerfs’ and are certainly of the same species with ours. They are blackish indeed under the belly, and not white as ours, and they are more of the chesnut red: but these are such small differences as would be sure to happen in two races from the same stock, breeding separately a number of ages.—Their hares are totally different from the animal we call by that name: but their rabbet is almost exactly like him. The only difference is in their manners; the land on which I walked for some time being absolutely reduced to a  honeycomb by their burrowing. I think there is no instance of ours burrowing.—After descending the

“I set out yesterday morning to  
take a view of this place (Fontaine­  
bleau). For this purpose I shaped  
my course toward the highest of the  
mountains in sight, to the top of which  
was about a league. As soon as I had  
got clear of the town I fell in with a  
poor woman walking at the same rate  
with myself and going the same course.  
Wishing to know the condition of the  
laboring poor I entered into conver­  
sation with her, which I began by  
inquiries for the path which would  
lead me into the mountain, and hence  
proceeded to inquiries into her voca­  
tion, condition and circumstances.  
She told me she was a day-laborer,  
at eight sous, or fourpence sterling,  
the day; that she had two children to  
maintain and to pay a rent of thirty  
livres for her house (which would  
consume the hire of seventy-five days);  
that often she could get no employ­  
ment, and, of course, was without  
bread. As we had walked together  
nearly a mile and she had so far  
served me as a guide, I gave her, on  
parting, twenty - four sous. She  
burst into tears of gratitude, which I  
could perceive was unfeigned because  
slit’, was unable to utter a word. She  
hsd probably never before received  
do great an aid. This little attendriss­  
eraent with the solitude of my walk  
led me into a train of reflections on  
that unequal division of property  
which occasions the numberless in­  
stances of wretchedness which I had  
observed in this country, and is to be  
observed all over Europe. The prop­  
erty of this country is absolutely  
concentrated in a very few. hands,  
having revenues of from half a  
million guineas a year downward.

country as servants. They employ

of all classes—that is, the poor who  
cannot find work. I asked myself  
what could be the reason that so many  
should be permitted to beg, who are  
willing to work, in a country where  
there is a very considei&#x27;able portion  
of uncultivated lands. These lands  
are kept idle mostly for the sake of  
game. It would seem, then, that it  
must be because of the enormous  
wealth of the proprietors, which

of silently lessening the in­

all from taxation below a certain  
point, and to tax the nigher portions  
of property in geometrical progres­  
sion as they rise. Wherever there

and unemployed poor, it is clear that  
the laws of property have been so far

are blackish, indeed, under the belly,

 for a man to praise the  
acts of by-gone statesmen than to  
show wherein they were superior  
to the men of affairs of tbe pres­  
ent day. In my opinion tbe South  
is as strongly represented in con­  
gress to-day as she ever was. Mr.  
Hewitt has been a man of great  
force of character, but his latest  
speech does not reflect creditably  
upon his present mental condi­  
tion.”  
  
Thomas Jefferson has been fairly  
quoted on tbe side of taxing in­  
comes, and, ot course, he is the  
highest Democratic authority. In  
a letter written from France, Oc­  
tober 28, 1785, Mr. Jefferson ex­  
pressed himself as follows: “lam  
conscious that an equal division  
of property is impracticable; but  
the consequence of this enormous  
inequality producing so much mis­  
ery to tbe bulk of mankind, legis­  
lators cannot invent too many de­  
vices for subdividing property,  
only taking care to let their sub­  
divisions go hand in hand with the  
natural affections or the human  
mind. The descent of property of  
everv kind, therefore, to all the  
children, or to all the brothers  
and sisters or other relations, in  
equal degree, is a politic measure  
and a practicable one. “Another  
means of silently lessening the  
inequality of property is to except  
all from taxation below a certain  
point, and to tax tbe higher por­

I set out yesterday morning to take a view of this place (Fon-  
tainebleau). For this purpose I shaped my course toward the high-  
est of the mountains in sight, to the top of which was about a  
league. As soon as I had got clear of the town, I fell in with a poor  
woman walking at the same rate with myself and going the same  
course. Wishing to know the condition of the laboring poor I  
entered into conversation with her, which I began by inquiries for  
the path which would lead me into the mountain, and hence pro-  
ceeded to inquiries into her vocation, condition, and circumstances.  
She told me she was a day-laborer, at eight sous, or four pence ster-  
ling, the day; that she had two children to maintain and to pay a  
rent of thirty livres for her house (which would consume the hire of  
seventy-five days); that often she could get no employment, and of  
course, was without bread. As we had walked together nearly a  
mile and she had so far served me as a guide, I gave her on parting  
twenty-four sous. She burst into tears of gratitude, which I could  
perceive was unfeigned, because she was unable to utter a word.  
She had probably never before received so great an aid. This little  
attendrissement, with the solitude of my walk, led me into a train of  
reflections on that unequal division of property which occasions  
the numberless instances of wretchedness which I had observed in  
this country, and is to be observed all over Europe.  
  
The property of this country is absolutely concentrated in a very  
few hands, having revenues of from half a million of guineas a  
year downward. These employ the flower of the country as sery  
vants. They employ also a great number of manufacturers and  
tradesmen, and, lastly, the class of laboring husbandmen; but after |  
all thesé comes the most numerous of all classes, that is, the poor  
who cannot find work. I asked myself what would be the reason  
that so many should be permitted to beg, who are willing to work  
in a country where there is a very considerable portion of unculti-  
vated lands. These lands are kept idle mostly for the sake of game.  
It should seem, then, that it must be because of the enormous  
wealth of the proprietors, which places them above attention to the  
increase of their revenues by permitting these lands to be labored.  
I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable;  
but the consequence of this enormous inequality producing so much  
misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many  
devices for subdividing property, only taking care to let their sub-  
divisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human

His court attend him, as do also the foreign diplomatic corps,  
but as this is not indispensably required, and my finances do not  
admit the expense of a continued residence here, I propose to  
come occasionally to attend the King’s levees, returning again to  
Paris, distant forty miles. This being the first trip, I set out yes-  
terday morning to take a view of the place. For this purpose I  
shaped my course towards the highest of the mountains in sight,  
to the top of which was about a league. As soon as I had got  
clear of the town I fell in with a poor woman walking at the  
same rate with myself and going the same course. Wishing to  
know the condition of the laboring poor, I entered into conver-  
sation with her, which began by enquiries for the path which would  
lead me into the mountain; and thence proceeded to enquiries  
into her vocation, condition and circumstances. She told me she  
was a day laborer at 8 sous, or 4d sterling, the day; that she had  
two children to maintain, and to pay a rent of 30 livres for her  
house (which would consume the hire of 75 days); that often  
she could get no employment, and of course was without bread.  
As we had walked together near a mile, and she had so far served  
me as a guide, I gave her, on parting, 24 sous. She burst into  
tears of gratitude, which I could perceive was unfeigned, because  
she was unable to utter a word. She had probably never before  
received so great an aid. This little attendrissement, with the  
solitude of my walk, led me into a train of reflection on that un-  
equal division of property which occasions the numberless in-  
stances of wretchedness which I had observed in this country and  
is to be observed all over Europe. The property of this country  
is absolutely concentred in a very few hands, having revenues of  
from half a million guineas a year downwards. These employ the  
flower of the country as servants, some of them having as many as  
200 domestics not laboring. They employ also a great number of  
manufacturers and tradesmen, and lastly, the class of laboring  
husbandmen. But after all there comes the most numerous of all  
classes—the poor who cannot find work. I asked myself what  
could be the reason so many should be permitted to beg who are  
willing to work, in a country where there is a very considerable  
portion of uncultivated lands? These lands are undisturbed only  
for the sake of the game. It should seem then that it must be  
because of the enormous wealth of the proprietors which places
