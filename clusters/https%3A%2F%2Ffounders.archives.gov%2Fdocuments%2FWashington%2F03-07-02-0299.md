e Inclining to Winter Quarters or making a feint to throw us off our Guard.  
Since I came on this side I have been reinforced by about 2000 of the City Militia, and understand that some of the Country Militia (from the back Counties) are on their way—but we are at present in a very disaffected part of the Provence, and between you and me I think our Affairs are in a very bad way—not so much from the Apprehension of Genl Howes Army as from the defection of New York, New Jersey, and Pensylvania—In short the conduct of the Jersey, has been most Infamous—Instead of turning out to defend their Country and affording aid to our Army they are making their Submissions as fast as they can—If they had given us any Support we might have made a stand at Hackensack, and after that at Brunswick, but the few Militia that were in Arms disbanded themselves or slunk off in such a manner upon the approach of danger as to leave us quite unsupported, &amp; to make the best shift we could without them.  
I have no doubt but that General Howe will still make an attempt upon Philadelphia this Winter—I see nothing to oppose him in a fortnight from this time, as the term of all the Troops except those of Virginia, (reduced almost to nothing) and Smallwoods Regiment from Maryland (in the same condition) will expire in that time. In a word my dear Sir, if every nerve is not straind to recruit the New Army with all possible Expedition I think the game is pretty near up—owing in great Measure to the insiduous Arts of the Enemy and disaffection of  
  
the Colonies beforementioned, but principally to the accursed policy of Short Inlistments and depending too much on Militia, the Evil consequences of which were foretold 15 Months ago with a spirit almost prophetick.  
Before this reaches you, you will no doubt have heard of the Captivity of Genl Lee—this is an additional Misfortune, and the more vexatious as it was the effect of folly &amp; Imprudence (without a view to answer any good) that he was taken—going three Miles out of his own Camp (for the sake of a little better lodging) &amp; within 20 of the Enemy a rascally Tory gave information in the Night and a party of light Horse in the Morning seiz’d and carried him off with every mark of triumph and Indignity.  
You, at a distance, can f⟨orm⟩ no Idea of the perplexity of my Situa⟨tion.

“TI have no doubt but General Howe will still make an attempt upon Philadelphia  
this winter. I foresee nothing to oppose him a fortnight hence, as the time of all the  
troops, except those of Virginia, now reduced almost to nothing, and Smallwood’s  
regiment of Marylanders, equally as low, will expire before the end of that time.  
In a word, my dear sir, if every nerve is not strained to recruit the new army with  
all possible expedition, I think the game is pretty nearly up, owing, in a great mea-  
sure, to the insidious arts of the enemy, and disaffection of the colonies before men-  
tioned, but principally to the ruinous policy of short enlistments, and placing too  
great a dependence on the militia, the evil consequences of which were foretold  
fifteen months ago, with a spirit almost prophetic. Before you receive this letter,  
you will undoubtedly have heard of the captivity of General Lee. This is an addi-  
tional misfortune, and the more vexatious, as it was by his own folly and impru-  
dence, and without a view to effect any good, that he was taken. As he went to  
lodge three miles out of his own camp, and within twenty of the enemy, a rascally  
Tory rode in the night to give notice of it to the enemy, who sent a party of light-  
joe that seized him, and carried him off, with every mark of triumph and in-  
  
gnity.  
  
“You can form no idea of the perplexity of my situation. No man, I believe,  
ever had a greater choice of difficulties, and less means to extricate himself from  
them. However, under a full persuasion of the justice of our cause, I cannot enter-

46 Writings of Washington. (January,  
  
so great was the disaffection of the people at one time that it  
threatened the most serious consequences, and caused even  
Washington to speak somewhat doubtingly of the result. While  
flying through the Jerseys, deserted by his own troops, who were  
marching off by regiments, and closely pursued by his powerful  
and victorious foe, he writes to his brother thus :—‘‘ We are in a  
very disaffected part of the province, and, between you and me, I  
think our affairs are in a very bad condition: not so much from  
the apprehension of General Howe’s army as from the defection  
of New-York, the Jerseys, and Pennsylvania. In short, the con-  
duct of the Jerseys has been most infamous. Instead of turning  
out to defend their country, and affording aid to our army, they are  
making their submission as fast as they can. If they had givenus  
any support we might have made a stand at Hackensack, and after  
that at Brunswick ; but the few militia that were in arms disbanded  
themselves, and left the poor remains of our army to make the best  
we could of it.” ‘In a word, my dear sir, if every nerve is not  
strained to recruit the new army with all possible expedition, I  
think the game is pretty nearly up, owing, in a great measure, to  
the insidious arts of the enemy and disaffection of the colonies  
before mentioned, but principally to the ruinous policy of short

who sent a party of light-horse that seized him, and carried him off with  
every mark of triumph and indignity.” See, also, Treason of Charles Lee,  
by George H. Moore.
