before 12 Apr. 1812  
My acquaintance with mr Henry commenced in the winter of 1759–60. on my way  
			 to the college I passed the Christmas holidays at Colo Dandridge’s in Hanover, to whom mr Henry was a near neighbor. during the festivity of the season I met him in society every day, and we became well acquainted, altho’ I was much his junior, being then in my 17th year, &amp; he a married man.   
			 the spring following he came to Williamsburg to obtain a license as a lawyer, and he called on me at College. he told me he had been reading law only 6. weeks. two of the  
			 examiners however, Peyton &amp; John Randolph, men of great facility of temper, signed his licence with as much reluctance as their dispositions would permit them to shew. mr Wythe absolutely refused. Rob. C. Nicholas refused also at first, but, on repeated importunities &amp; promises of future reading, he signed. these facts I had afterwards from the gentlemen themselves, the two Randolphs acknoleging  
			 he was very ignorant of law, but that they percieved him to be a young man of genius &amp; did not doubt he would soon qualify himself.  
He was, some time after, elected a representative of the county of Hanover, &amp; brought himself into public notice on the following occasion which I think took place in 1762. or a year sooner or later. the gentlemen of this country had at that time become deeply  
			 involved in that state of indebtment which has since ended in so general a crush of their fortunes. Robinson, the Speaker, was also Treasurer, an officer always chosen by the assembly. he was an excellent man, liberal, friendly, &amp; rich. he had been drawn in to lend, on his own account, great  
			 sums of money to persons of this description, &amp; especially those who were of the assembly. he used freely for this purpose the public money, confiding, for it’s replacement, in his own means,  
			 &amp; the securities he had taken on those loans. about this time however he became   
sensible that his deficit to the public was become so enormous as that a discovery must soon take place, for as yet the public  
			 had no suspicion of it. he devised therefore, with his friends in the assembly, a plan for a public loan office to a certain amount, from which monies might be lent on public account, and on good  
			 landed security, to individuals. this  
			 was accordingly brought forward in the House of Burgesses, and had it succeeded, the debts due to Robinson on these loans would have been transferred to the public, &amp; his deficit thus compleatly covered. this state of things however was not yet known: but mr Henry attacked the scheme, on other general grounds, in that style of bold, grand &amp; overwhelming eloquence, for which he became so justly celebrated afterwards. he carried with him all the  
			 members of the upper counties, &amp; left a minority composed merely of the aristocracy of the country. from this time his popularity swelled apace; &amp; Robinson dying about 4. years after, his deficit was brought to light, &amp; discovered the true object of the proposition.  
The next great occasion on which he signalised himself was that which may be considered as the dawn of the revolution, in March 1764. the British parliament had passed resolutions preparatory to the levying a revenue on the Colonies by a Stamp tax. the Virginia assembly, at their next session, prepared &amp; sent to England very elaborate representations addressed in separate forms to the King, Lords, &amp; Commons, against the right to impose such taxes. the famous Stamp act was however passed in Jan. 1765.  
			   
and in the session of the Virginia assembly of May following, mr Henry introduced the celebrated resolutions of that date. these were drawn by George Johnston, a lawyer of the Northern neck, a very able, logical &amp; correct Speaker.  
			 mr Henry moved, &amp; Johnston seconded these resolutions successively. they were opposed by Randolph, Bland, Pendleton, Nicholas, Wythe &amp; all the old members whose influence in the house had, till then, been unbroken. they did it, not from any question of our rights, but on the ground that the same sentiments had been, at their preceding session, expressed in a more conciliatory form, to which the answers were not yet recieved. but torrents of sublime eloquence from mr Henry, backed by the solid reasoning of Johnston, prevailed. the last however, &amp; strongest resolution was carried but by a single vote. the debate on it was most bloody. I was then but a student, &amp; was listening at the door of the lobby (for as yet there was no  
			 gallery) when Peyton Randolph, after the vote, came out of the house, and said, as he entered the lobby, ‘by god, I would have given 500. guineas for a single vote.’ for as this would have divided the house, the vote of Robinson, the Speaker, would have rejected the  resolution. mr Henry left town that evening, &amp; the next morning before the meeting of the House, I saw Peter Randolph, then of the Council, but who had formerly been clerk to the house, for an hour or two at the Clerk’s table, searching the old journals for a precedent of a resolution of the house, erased, while he was clerk, from the journals, by a subsequent order of the house. whether he found it, or not, I do not remember; but, when the house met, a motion was made &amp; carried to erase  
			 that resolution: and, there being at that day but one printer, &amp; he entirely under the controul of the Governor, I do not know that this resolution ever appeared in print. I write this from memory: but the impression made on me, at the time, was such as to fix the facts indelibly in my mind.  
I came into the legislature as a Burgess for the county of Albemarle in the winter of 1768.9. on the accession of Ld Botetourt to this   
the government, and about 9 years after mr Henry had entered on the stage of public life. the exact conformity of our political opinions strengthened our friendship; and indeed the old leaders of the house being substantially firm, we had not after this any differences of opinion in the H. of Burgesses, on matters of principle; tho’ sometimes on matters of form. we were dissolved by Ld Botetourt at our first session, but all were re-elected. there being no divisions among us, occasions became very rare for any display of mr Henry’s eloquence. in ordinary business he was a very inefficient member. he could not draw a bill on the most simple subject which would bear legal criticism, or even the ordinary criticism which looks to correctness of stile &amp; idea: for indeed there was no accuracy of idea in his head. his imagination was copious, poetical, sublime; but vague also. he said the strongest things in the finest language, but without logic, without arrangement, desultorily. this appeared eminently &amp; in a mortifying degree in the first session of the first Congress, which met in Sep. 1774. mr Henry &amp; Richard Henry Lee took at once the lead in that assembly, &amp;, by the high style of their eloquence, were, in the first days of the session, looked up to as primi inter pares. a Petition to the king, an Address to the people of Great Britain and a Memorial to the people of British America were agreed to be drawn. Lee, Henry &amp; others were appointed for the first, Lee, Livingston &amp; Jay for the two last. the splendor of their debut occasioned mr Henry to be designated by his committee to draw the petition to the king, with which they were charged; and mr Lee was charged with the Address to the people of England. the last was first reported. on reading it, every countenance  
			 fell, &amp; a dead silence ensued for many minutes. at length it was laid on the table for perusal &amp; consideration till the  
			 next day, when first   
one member &amp; then another arose, &amp; paying some faint compliments to the composition, observed that there were still  
			 certain considerations, not expressed in it, which should properly find a place in it. at length mr Livingston (the Governor of New Jersey) a member of the Committee rose &amp; observed that a friend of his had been sketching what he had thought might be proper for such an address, from which he thought some paragraphs might be  
			 advantageously introduced into the draught proposed; &amp;  
			 he read an Address which mr Jay had prepared de bene esse as it were. there was but one sentiment of admiration. the Address was recommitted for amendment, and mr Jay’s draught reported &amp; adopted with scarce an alteration. these  
			 facts were stated to me by mr Pendleton &amp; Colo Harrison of our own delegation, except that Colo Harrison ascribed the draught to Govr Livingston, &amp; were afterwards confirmed to me by Govr Livingston, and I will presently mention an anecdote confirming   
confirmative of them from mr Jay &amp; R. H. Lee themselves.  
Mr Henry’s draught of a petition to the king was equally unsuccesful, &amp; was recommitted for amendment. mr John Dickinson was added to the committee, &amp; a new draught prepared by him was passed.  
The occasion of my learning from mr Jay that he was the author of the Address to the people of Great Britain requires explanation by a statement of some preceding circumstances.  
			 the  
			 2d session of the 1st Congress met on their own adjournment in May 1775. Peyton Randolph was their President. in  
			 the mean time Ld North’s conciliatory propositions came over, to be laid by the Governors before their legislatures.  
			 Ld Dunmore accordingly called that of Virginia to meet in June. this obliged Peyton Randolph, as Speaker, to return. our other old members being at Congress, he pressed me to draw the answer to Ld North’s propositions. I accordingly did so, &amp; it passed with a  
			 little softening of some expressions for which the times were not yet ripe, &amp; wire-drawing &amp; weakening some others to  
			 satisfy individuals. I  
			 had been appointed to go on to Congress in place of Peyton Randolph, &amp; proceeded immediately, charged with presenting this answer to Congress. as it was the first which had been given, and the tone of it was strong, the members were pleased with it, hoping it would have a good effect on the answers of the other states.  
			 a  
			 Committee which had been appointed to prepare a Declaration to be published by Genl Washington on his arrival at the army, having reported one, it was recommitted, &amp; Dickinson &amp; myself added to the Committee. on the adjournment of the house, happening to go out with Govr Livingston, one of the Committee, I expressed to him my  hope he would draw the Declaration. he modestly excused himself, &amp; expressed his wish that I would do it. but urging him  
			 with considerable importunity, he  
			 at length said ‘you &amp; I, sir, are but new acquaintances; what can have excited so earnest a desire on your part that I should be the draughtsman? why, Sir, said I, I have been informed you  
			 drew  
			 the Address to the people of Great Britain; I think it the first composition in the English language, &amp; therefore am anxious this declaration should be prepared by the same pen. he replied that I might have been misinformed on  
			 that subject.’   
a  
			 few days after, being in conversation with R. H. Lee in Congress hall, a little before the meeting of the house, mr Jay observing us, came up, &amp; taking R. H. Lee by a button of the coat, said to him pretty sternly, ‘I understand, Sir, that you informed this gentleman that the Address to the people of Great Britain, presented to the Committee by me, was drawn by Governor Livingston.’ the fact was that the Commee having consisted of only Lee, Livingston who was father in law of Jay, &amp; Jay himself, &amp; Lee’s draught having been rejected &amp; Jay’s approved so unequivocally, his suspicions naturally fell on Lee, as author of the report; &amp; the rather as they had daily much sparring in Congress, Lee being firm in the revolutionary measures, &amp; Jay hanging heavily on their rear. I immediately stopped mr Jay, &amp; assured him that tho’ I had indeed been so informed, it was not by mr Lee, whom I had never heard utter a word on the subject.  
I found mr Henry to be a silent, &amp; almost unmedling member in Congress. on the original opening of that body, while general grievances were the topic, he was in his element, &amp; captivated all with his bold &amp; splendid eloquence. but as soon as they came  
			 to specific matters, to sober reasoning &amp; solid argumentation, he had the good sense to percieve that his declamation, however excellent in it’s proper place, had no weight at all in such an  
			 assembly as that, of cool-headed, reflecting, judicious men. he ceased therefore in a great measure to take any part in  
			 the business. he seemed indeed very tired of the place, &amp; wonderfully  
			 relieved when, by appointment of the Virginia   
assembly Convention to be Colonel of their 1st regiment, he was permitted to leave Congress about the last of July.  
How he acquitted himself in his military command will be better known from others. he was relieved from this position again by being appointed Governor, on the first organisation of the government.After my service as his successor in the same office, my appointment to Congress in 1783. mission to Europe in 84. &amp; appointment in the new government in 93.   
89. kept us so far apart that I had no farther personal knolege of him.  
  
Mr Henry began his career with very little property. he acted, as I have understood, as barkeeper in the tavern at Hanover C.H. for some time. he married very young; settled, I believe, at a place called the Roundabout in Louisa, got credit for some little store of merchandize, but very soon failed. from  
			 this he turned his views to the law, for the acquisition or practice of which however he was too lazy.  
			 whenever  
			 the courts were closed for the winter season, he would make up a party of poor hunters of his neighborhood, would go off with them to the piney woods of Fluvanna, &amp; pass weeks in hunting deer, of which he was passionately fond, sleeping under a tent, before a fire, wearing the same shirt the whole time, &amp; covering all the dirt of his dress  
			 with a hunting shirt.he never undertook to draw  
			 pleadings, if he could avoid it, or to manage that part of a cause, &amp; very unwillingly engaged but as an assistant, to speak in the cause; and  
			 the  
			 fee was an indispensable preliminary, observing to the applicant that he kept no accounts, never putting pen to paper, which was true. his powers over a jury were so irresistible, that he  
			 recieved  
			 great fees for his services, &amp; had the reputation of being insatiable in money. after about 10. years practice in  
			 the County courts, he came to the General court, where however, being totally  
			 unqualified for any thing but mere jury causes, he devoted himself to these, &amp; chiefly to the criminal business. from these poor devils it was always understood that he squeezed exorbitant  
			 fees  
			 of 50. 100. &amp; 200.£. from this source he made his great profits, and they were said to be great. his other business, exclusive of the criminal, would never, I am sure, pay the expences of his  
			 attendance at the court.he  
			 now purchased from mr Lomax the valuable estate on the waters of Smith’s river, to which he afterwards removed. the purchase was on long credit, &amp; finally paid in depreciated paper, not worth oak leaves.about the close of the  
				war he engaged in the Yazoo  
			 speculation, &amp; bought up a great deal of depreciated paper at 2/ &amp; 2/6 in the pound to pay for it. at the close of the war, many of us wished to re-open all accounts which had been paid  
			 in  
			 depreciated money; &amp; have them settled by the scale of depreciation. but on this he frowned most indignantly; &amp;, knowing the general indisposition of the legislature, it was considered  
			 hopeless to attempt it with such an opponent at their head as Henry.I  
			 believe he never distinguished himself so much as on the similar question of British debts, in the case of Jones &amp; Walker. he had exerted a degree of industry in that case totally foreign to his character, &amp; not only seemed, but had made himself really learned on the subject. another of the great occasions  
			 on which he exhibited examples of eloquence, such as probably had never been exceeded, was on the question of adopting the new constitution in 1788.  
			 to this he was most violently  
				opposed, as is well known; &amp;,  
			 after it’s adoption, he  
			 continued hostile to it, expressing, more than any other man in the US. his thorough contempt &amp; hatred of Genl Washington.from being the most  
				violent of all anti-federalists however, he was brought over  
			 to the new constitution by his Yazoo speculation before mentioned. the Georgia legislature having declared that transaction fraudulent &amp; void, the depreciated paper which he had bought up to pay for the Yazoo purchase was likely to remain on his hands worth  
			 nothing. but Hamilton’s funding system came most opportunely to his relief, &amp; suddenly raised his paper from 2/6 to 27/6 the pound. Hamilton became now his idol, and abandoning the republican advocates of the constitution, the federal government, on federal principles, became his political creed.Genl Washington flattered him by an appointment to a mission to Spain, which however he declined; and by proposing to him the office of Secretary of state, on the most earnest sollicitation of Genl Henry Lee, who pledged himself that Henry should not accept it. for Genl Washington knew that he was entirely unqualified for it; &amp; moreover that his self-esteem had never suffered him to act as second to any man on earth.I  
			 had this fact from information; but that of  
			 the mission to Spain is of my own knolege; because, after my retiring from the office of Secretary of State, Genl  Washingtonpassed the papers to mr Henry through my hands. mr Henry’s apostacy, sunk him to nothing, in the estimation of his country.he  
			 lost at once all that influence which federalism had hoped, by cajoling him, to transfer with him to  
			 itself, and a man  
			 who, through a long &amp; active life, had been the idol of his country, beyond any one that ever lived, descended to the grave with less than it’s indifference, and verefiedverified the saying of the philosopher, that no man must be called happy till he is dead.

at startling  
and at variance with the cherished and  
traditionary reputation of the great orator,  
are far too valuable to be suppressed, and  
form a contribution to history which it is  
strange has been so long withheld. They  
will be read, especially those portions de  
rogatory to Mr. Henry as a man of pers­  
sonal integrity, with some caution. There  
are statements in this paper, the accu-­  
racy of which, we very much question, and  
in relation to which we shall in a day or  
two take an opportunity of stating our  
views. The paper, however, whether as  
evidence trustworthy or not, is a great  
curiosity:  
My acquaintance with Mr. Henry com­  
menced in the winter of 1759,&#x27;60. On my  
way to the college I passed the Nmas  
holidays at Colonel Dandridge&#x27;s, in Han  
over, to whom Mr. Henry was a near  
neighbor. During the festivity of the  
season I met him in society every day, and  
we became well acquainted, although I  
was much his junior, being then but in my  
seventeenth year, and he a married man.  
The spring following he came to williams  
burg to obtain a license as a lawyer, and  
he called on me at College. He told me  
he had been reading law only six weeks.  
Two of the examiners, however, Peyton  
and John Randolph, men of great facility  
of temper, signed his license with as much  
reluctance as their dispositions would per-­  
mit them to show. Mr. Wythe absolutely  
refused. Rob. C. Nicholas refused also  
at first, but on repeated importunities and  
promises of future reading he signed.  
These facts I had afterwards from the  
gentlemen themselves, the two Randolphs  
acknowledging he was very ignorant of  
law, but that they perceived him to be a  
young man of genius and did not doubt he  
would soon qualify himself.  
He was some time after elected a repre-­  
sentative of the County of Hanover, and  
brought himself into public notice on the  
following occasion, which, I think, took  
place in 1792, or a year sooner or later.  
The gentlemen of this country had ar that  
time become deeply involved in that state  
of indebtedness which has since ended in  
so general a crush of their fortunes the  
speaker was also Preasurer, an officer al­  
ways chosen by the Assembly. He was  
an excellent man, liberal, friendly, and  
rich. He had been drawn in to lend on  
his own account great sums of money to  
persons of this description, and especially  
those who were of the Assembly. He  
used freely for this purpose the public  
money, confiding for its replacement in  
his own means and the securities he had  
taken on those loans. About this time,  
however, he became sensible that his de-­  
ficit to the public was become so enor­  
mous as that a discovery must soon take  
place, for as yet the public had no suspi­  
cion of it. He devised, therefore, with his  
friends in the Assembly a plan for a pub-­  
lic loan office to a certain amount, from  
which moneys might be lent on public  
count and on good landed security, to in­  
dividuals. This was accordingly brought  
forward in the House of Burgesses, and  
had it succeeded the debts due to Robin-­  
son on these loans would have been trans-­  
ferred to the public, and his deficit thus  
completely covered. This state of things,  
however, was not yet known; but Mr,  
Henry attacked the scheme on other gene.­  
ral grounds in that style of bold, grand,  
and overwhelming eloquence for which he  
became so justly celebrated afterwards.  
He carried with him all the members of the  
upper counties, and left a minority, com­  
posed mainly of the aristocracy of the  
country. From this time his popularity  
swelled apace, and,-dying about four  
years after, his deficit was brought to light,  
and discovered the true object of the pro  
position.  
The next great occasion on which he  
signalized himself was that which may be  
considered as the dawn of the Revolution,  
in March, 1774. The British Parliament  
had passed resolutions preparatory to the  
levying a revenue on the Colonies by a  
stamp tax. The Virginia Assembly, at  
their next session, prepared and sent to  
Ingland very claborate representations,  
addressed, in separate forms, to the King,  
Lords, and Commons, against the right to  
impose such taxes. The famous Stamp  
Act was, however, passed in January,  
1705, and in the session of the Virginia  
Assembly of May following Mr. Henry in­  
troduced the celebrated resolutions of  
that date. These were drawn by George  
Johnston, a lawyer of the Northern Neck,  
a very able, logical, and correct speaker,  
Mr. Henry moved and Johnston seconded  
these resolutions successively. They  
were opposed by Randolph, Fendleton,  
Nicholas.Wythe, and all the old  
members whose influence in the House  
had till then been unbroken. They did it,  
not from any question of our rights, but  
on the ground that the same sontiments  
had been at their preceding session ex-­  
pressed in a more conciliatory form, to  
which the answers were not yet received.  
But torrents of sublime eloquence from  
Mr. Henry, backed by the solid reasoning  
of Johnston, prevailed. The last, how:­  
ever, and strongest resolution was carried  
but by a single vote. The debate on it  
was most bloody. I was then but a stue­  
dent, and was listening at the door of the  
lobby, Gfor as yet there was no gallery.  
when Feyton Randolph, after the vote,  
came out of the House and said as he en-­  
tered the lobby: &quot;By God, I would have  
given five hundred guineas for a single  
vote.&quot; For as this would have divided the  
House, the vote of the Speaker would have  
rejected the resolution. Mr. Henry left  
town that evening, and the next morning  
before the meeting of the House I saw pe-­  
ter Randolph, then of the Couneil, but who  
had formerly been Olerk to the House, for  
an hour or two at the Clerk&#x27;s table searche­  
ing the old journals for a precedent while  
he was clerk of a resolution of the House  
crased from the journals by a subsequent  
order of the House. Whether he found it  
or not I do not remember; but when the  
House met a motion was made and carried  
  
to erase that resoln,; and there being  
at that day but one printer, and he entire-­  
ly under the control of the Governor, I do  
not know that this resoln, ever appeared in  
print. I write this from memory, but the  
impression made on me at the time was  
such as to fix the facts indelibly in my  
mind.  
I came into the Legislature as a burgess  
for Albemarle in the winter of 1768.9, on  
the accession of L&#x27;d Botetourt to the go-­  
vernment, and about nine years after Mr.  
Henry had entered on the stage of public  
life. The exact conformity of our politi­  
cal opinions strengthened our friendship,  
and, indeed, the old leaders of the House  
being substantially firm, we had not after  
this any differences of opinion in the H.  
of B. on matters of principle, though  
sometimes on matters of form. We  
were dissolved by Ld. Botetourt at our  
first session, but all were reélected.  
There being no divisions among us, oc.­  
casions became very rare for the display  
of Mr. H.&#x27;s eloquence. In ordinary bue­  
siness he was a very inefficient mem-­  
ber. He could not draw a bill on the  
most simple subject which would bear  
legal criticism, or even the ordinary criti­  
cism which looks to the correctness of  
style and idea; for, indeed, there was  
no accuracy of idea in his head. His  
imagination was copious, poetical, sublime,  
but vague also. He said the strongest  
things in the finest language, but without  
logic, without arrangement, desultorily.  
This appeared eminently and in a morti­  
fying degree in the ist session of the 1st  
Congress, which met in September, 1774.  
Mr. Henry, and Richard Henry Lee, took  
at once the lead in that assembly, and, by  
the high style of their eloquence were, in  
the first days of the session, looked up to  
as primi inter pares.

eir  
debilt occasioned Mr. Henry to be designa.­  
ted by his committee to draw the petition  
to the King, with which they were  
charged, and Mr. Lee was charged with  
the address to the people of England.  
The last was first reported. On read-­  
ing it every countenance fell, and  
a dead silence ensued for many  
minutes. At length itswas laid on the ta.­  
ble for perusal and consideration till the  
next day, when first one member and then  
another arose, and, paying some faint com-­  
pliments to the composition, observed that  
there were still certain considerations not  
expressed in it which should properly find  
a place in it. At length Mr. Livingston  
(the Governor of New Jersey), a member  
of the committee, rose and observed that  
a friend of his had been sketching what he  
had thought might be proper for such an  
address, from which he thought some para-­  
graphs might he advantageously intro-­  
duced into the draught he proposed; and he  
read an address which Mr. Jay had pre.­  
pared de bene esse, as it were. There was  
but one sentiment of admiration. The ad­  
dress was recommitted for amendment,  
and Mr. Jay&#x27;s draught reported and  
adopted with scarce any alteration. These  
facts were stated to me by Mr. Pendleton  
and Colonel Harrison, of our own delega.­  
tion, fexcept that Colonel Harrison  
ascribed the draught to Governor Living-­  
ston,) and were afterwards confirmed to  
me by Governor Livingston; and I will  
prosently mention an anecdote confirma-­  
tive of them, from Mr. Jay and R. H. L.  
themselves.  
Mr. Henry&#x27;s draught of a petition to the  
King was equally unsuccessful, and was  
recommitted for amendment. Mr. John  
Dickinson was added to the committee,  
and a new draught prepared by him was  
passed.  
  
The occasion of my learning from Mr.  
Jay that he was the author of the address  
to the people of Great Britain requires ex.  
planation by a statement of some preced-­  
ing circumstances. The 2d session of the  
1st Congress met, on their own adjourn.­  
ment, in May, 1775. Peyton Randolph was  
their President. In the mean time Ld.  
North&#x27;s conciliatory propositions came  
over to be laid by the Governors before  
their Legislatures. Ld. Dunmore accord.  
ingly called that of Virginia to meet in  
June. This obliged P. Randolph, as  
Speaker, to return. Our other old mem­  
bers being at Congress, he pressed me to  
draw the answer to Ld. North&#x27;s propo-­  
sition. I accordingly did so, and it passed  
with a little softening of some expressions  
for which the times were not yet ripe, and  
wire-drawing and weakening others to sae­  
tisfy individuals. I had been appointed to  
go on to Congress in place of Peyton Rane­  
dolph, and proceeded immediately, charged  
with presenting this answer to Congress.  
As it was the first which had been given,  
and the tone of it was strong, the members  
were pleased with it, hoping it would have  
a good effect on the answers of the other  
States. A committee which had been ap-­  
pointed to prepare a declaration to be pub-­  
lished by General Washington on his ar-­  
rival at the army having reported one, it  
was recommitted, and Dickinson and my-­  
self added to the committee. On the ad-­  
journment of the House, happening to go  
out with Govr. Livingston, one of the  
committee, I expressed to him my hope  
he would draw the declaration. He mo-­  
destly excused himself, and expressed  
his wish that I would do it. But  
urging him with considerable impor-­  
tunity he at length said: &quot;You and I,  
sir, are but new acquaintances; what can  
have excited so earnest a desire on your  
part that I should be the draughtsman?&quot;  
&quot;Why, sir,&quot; said I, &quot;I have been informed  
you drew the address to the people of Gr.  
Britain. I think it the first composition in  
the English language; and, therefore, am  
anxious this declaration should be pre.  
pared by the same pen.&quot; He replied  
that I might have been misinformed on  
that subject.&quot; A few days after, being in  
conversation with R. H. Lee in Congress  
Hall, a little before the meeting of the  
House, Mr. Jay observing us, came up,  
and taking R. H. Lee by a button of the  
coat, said to him pretty sternly: &quot;I une­  
derstand, sir, that you informed this  
gentleman that the address to the  
people of Great Britain, presented to the  
committee by me, was drawn by Govr.  
Livingston.&quot; The fact was that the come­  
mittee having consisted of only Lee, Liv,­  
ingston (who was father in law of Jayl, and  
ay himself, and Lee&#x27;s draught having  
been rejected, and Jay&#x27;s approved so un­  
equivocally, his suspicions naturally fell  
on Lee as author of the report, and the  
rather, as they daily had much sparring in  
Congress, Lee being firm in the revolution-  
ary measures, and Jay hanging heavily on  
their rear. I immediately stopped Mr.  
Jay, and assured him that, though I had  
indeed been so informed, it was not by Mr.  
Lee, whom I had never heard utter a word  
on the subject.  
I found ifr. Henry to be a silent and al­  
most unmeddling member of Congress.  
On the original opening of that body, while  
general grievances were the topic, he was  
in his element, and captivated all by his  
bold and splendid eloguence. But as soon  
as they came to specifie matters, to sober  
reasoning and solld argumentation, he had  
the good sense to perccive that his declar­  
mation, however excellent in its proper  
place, had no weight at all in such an as­  
sembly as that of cooltheaded, reflecting,  
judicious men. He ceased, therefore, in  
  
a great measure to take any part in the  
business. He seemed, indeed, very tired  
of the place and wonderfully relieved  
when, by appointment of the Virginia Cone­  
vention to be Colo, of their first regiment,  
i a pruios t has cas el  
e last of July. How he aequitted him­  
self of his military command will be better  
known from others. He was relieved  
from this position again by being appoint-­  
ed Governor on the first organization of  
the Government. After my service as his  
successor in the same office, my appoint­  
ment to Congress in 1773, mission to En­  
rope in 84, and appointment in the new  
government in &#x27;89, kept us so far apart  
that I had no further personal knowledge  
Mr. Henry began his career with very  
little property. He acted, as I have un-­  
derstood, as bar-keeper in the tavern at  
Hanover Courthouse for some time. He  
married very young, settled, I believe, at  
a place called the Roundabout, in Louisa,  
got credit for some little store of merchan-­  
dise, but very soon failed. From this he  
turned his views to the law; for the acqui­  
sition or practice of which, however, he  
was too lazy. Whenever the courts were  
closed for the winter session he would  
make up a party of poor hunters of his  
neighborhood, would go off with them to  
the piney woods of Fluvanna, and pass  
weeks in hunting deer, of which he was  
passionately fond, sleeping under a tent,  
before a fire, wearing the same shirt the  
whole time, and covering all the dirt of his  
dress with a hunting-shirt. He never  
undertook to draw pleadings if he could  
avoid it, or to manage that part of a  
cause, and very unwillingly engaged  
but as an assistant to speak in the  
cause. And the fee was an indispensa­  
ble preliminary, observing to the applis­  
cant that he kept no accounts, never put­  
ting pen to paper, which was true. His  
powers over a jury were so irresistible  
that he received great fees for his services,  
and had the reputation of being insatiable  
in money. After about ten years practice  
in the County Courts he came to the Genl.  
Court, where, however, being totally un­  
qualified for anything but mere jury causes,  
he devoted himself to these, and chiefly to  
the criminal business. From these poor  
devils it was always understood that he  
squeezed exorbitant fees of $50, $100,  
and $200. From this source he made his  
great profits, and they were said to be  
great. His other business, exclusive of the  
criminal, would never, I am sure, pay the  
expenses of his attendance. He now pur-­  
chased from Mr. Lomax the valuable es.­  
tate on the waters of Smith&#x27;s River, to  
which he afterwards removed. The pur-­  
chase was on long credit, and finally paid  
in depreciated paper, not worth oak  
leaves. About the close of the war he en­  
gaged in the Yazoo speculation, and  
bought up a great deal of depreciated  
paper at 2s, and 2s. 6d, in the pound to pay  
for it. At the close of the war many of  
us wished to reépen all accounts which had  
been paid in depreciated money, and have  
them settled by the scale of depreciation.  
But on this he frowned most indignantly,  
and, knowing the general indisposition of  
the Legislature, it was considered hope­  
less to attempt it with such an opponent at  
their head as Henry. I believe he never  
distinguished himself so much as on the  
similar question of British debts in the  
case of Jones and Walker. He had exert-­  
ed a degree of interest in that  
case totally foreign, to his character,  
and not only seemed, but had made  
himself really, learned on the sube­  
ject. Another of the great occasions  
on which he exhibited examples of elo.­  
quence, such as probably had never been  
exceeded, was on the question of adopting  
the new Constitution in 1788. To this he was  
most violently opposed, as is well known;  
and after its adoption he continued hostile  
to it, expressing more than any other man  
in the U. S. his thorough contempt and  
hatred of General Washington. From  
being the most violent of all anti-Fede-­  
ralists, however, he was brought over to  
the new Constitution by his Yazoo specu­  
lation, before mentioned. The Georgia  
Legislature having declared that trans.­  
action fraudulent and void, the depre.­  
ciated paper which he had bought up to  
pay for the Yazoo purchase was likely  
remain on his hands worth no-­  
thing. But Hamilton&#x27;s funding system  
came most opportunely to his relief, and  
suddenly raised his paper from 2s. 6d to  
27s. 6d, the pound. Hamilton became now  
his idol, and abandoning the Republican  
advocates of the Constitution, the Federal  
Government, on Federal principles, became  
his political creed. Genl. Washington flat-­  
tered him by an appointment to a mission  
to Spain, which he declined; and by proe­  
posing to him the office of Secretary of  
State, on the most earnest solicitation of  
General Henry Lee, who pledged himself  
that Henry should not accept it. For Ge-­  
neral Washington knew that he was en­  
tirely unqualified for it, and moreover that  
his self-esteem had never suffered him to  
act as second to any man on earth. I had  
this fact from information, but that of the  
mission to Spain is of my own knowledge,  
because, after my retiring from the office  
of Secretary of State, Genl. Washing-­  
tonpassed the papers to Mr. Henry  
through my hands. Mr. Henry&#x27;s apostacy  
sunk him to nothing in the estimation of  
his country. He lost at once all that in-­  
fluence which Federalism had hoped, by  
cajoling him, to transfer with him to itself,  
and a man who, through a long and active  
life, had been the idol of his country be­  
yond any one that ever lived, descended  
to the grave with less than its indifference.  
and verified the saying of the philosopher,  
that no man must be called happy till he  
is dead

&quot;Mr. Henry began his career with very  
little property. He acted, as 1 have un­  
derstood, as bar-keeper in the tavern at  
Hanover C. H., for some time. He  
married very young, settled, I believe,  
at a place called Roundabout, in Louisa,  
got credit for some little store of mer­  
chandise, but very soon failed. From  
this he turned his views to the law, for  
the acquisition or practice of which,  
however, be was too lazy. Whenever  
the couris were closed for the winter  
session, be would make up a party ot  
poor hunters of his neighborhood;  
would go off with them to the piney  
woods of Fluvanna, and pass weeks in  
hunting deer, of which he was passion­  
ately fond; sleeping under a tent, be­  
fore&#x27;a fire, wearing the same shirt the  
whole time, and covering all the dirt of  
his dress with u hunting shirt. He  
never undertook to draw pleadings if  
lie could avoid It, or to manage that  
part of a cause, and very unwillingly  
engaged but as ati assistant to speak in  
the case. And the tee was au indispen­

plicant Unit ho kept no account, never  
putting |&gt;en tt? f?aper, which was true.

his services, and had the reputation of  
being insatiable iti money.

d at va­  
riance with the cherished and tradi­  
tionary reputation of the great orator,   
are far too valuable to be suppressed,   
and form a contribution to history which   
it is strange has been so long withheld.   
They will be read, especially those por­  
etions derogatory to Mr. Henry as a man   
of personal integrity, with some caution.   
There are statements in this paper, the   
accuracy of which we very much ques­  
tion, and in relation to which we shall,   
in a day or two, take an opportunity of   
stating our views. The paper, however,   
whether as evidence trustworthy or not,   
is a great curiosity.   
My acquaintance with Mr. Henry   
commenced in the winter of 1759-60. On   
my way to the College I passed the   
Xmas holidays at Col. Dandridge&#x27;s, in   
Hanover, to whom Mr. Henry was a   
near neighbor. During the festivity of   
the season I met him in society every   
day, and we became well acquainted,   
although I was much his junior, being   
then but in my 17th year and he a   
married man. The spring following he   
came to W&#x27;msb&#x27;g to obtain a license as   
a lawyer, and he called on me at College.   
He told me he had been reading law   
only 6 weeks. Two of ate examiners,   
however, Peyton and John Randolph,   
men of great facility of temper, signed   
his license with as much reluctance as   
their dispositions would permit them to   
show. Mr. Wythe absolutely refused.   
Rob. C. Nicholas refused also at first,   
but on repeated importunities and pro­  
mises of future reading, he signed.   
These facts.l had afterwards from the   
gentlemen -themselves, the two Ran­  
dolpbs acknowledging he was very ig­  
norant of law, but that they perceived   
him to be a young mau of genius and   
did not doubt he would soon qualify   
himself.   
  
He was some time after elected a rep­  
resentative of the County of Hanover,   
and brought himself into public notice   
on the following occasion, which, I   
think, took place in 1762, or a year soon­  
er or later. The gentlemen of this   
country had, at that time, become deep­  
ly involved in that state of indebted­  
ness which bas since ended in so:general   
a crush of their fortunes.   
the Speaker was also Treasurer,an:officer   
alwayschosen by the Assembly. He was   
an excellent man, liberal, friendly and   
rich. He had been drawn in to lend on   
his own act great sums of money to per­  
sons of this description, and especially   
those who were of the Assembly. He   
used freely for this purpose the public   
money, confiding for its replacement in   
his own means and the securities he   
had taken on those loans. About this   
time, however, he became sensible that   
his deficit to the public was become   
so enormous ar that a discovery must   
soon take place, for as yet the pub­  
lic had no suspicion of it. He   
devised, therefore, with his friends   
in the Assembly a plan for a pub­  
lic loan office to a certain amount   
from which monies might be lent on   
public count, and on good landed se­  
curity, to individuals. This was ac­  
cordingly brought forward in the House   
of Burgesses, and, had it succeeded, the   
debts due to Robinson on these loans   
would have been transferred to the pub­  
lic, and his deficit thus completely   
covered. This state of things, how­  
ever, was not yet known; but Mr.   
Henry attacked the scheme on other   
genera,&#x27; grounds in that style of bold,   
grand and overwhelming eloquence for   
which he became so justly celebrated   
afterwards. He carried with him all   
the members of the upper counties, and   
left a minority, composed mainly of the   
aristocracy of the country. From this   
time his popularity sWCIled apace, and,   
—dying about 4 yeare alter, his deficit   
was brought to light, and discovered   
the true object of the proposition.   
The next great occasion on which he   
signalized himself was that which may   
be considered as the dawn of the Revo­  
lution in March, 1774. The British   
Parliament had passed resolutions pre­  
paratory to the levying a revenue on   
the colonies by a &#x27;,tamp tax. The Vir­  
ginia Assembly, at their next session,   
prepared and sent to England very   
elaborate representations, addressed, in   
separate forms, to the King, Lords and   
Commons, against the right to impose   
such taxes. The famous Stamp Act   
was, however, passed in Jan., 176,5, and   
in the session of the Virginia Assembly   
of May following Mr. Henry introduced   
the celebrated resolutions of that date.   
  
These were drawn by George Johnston:   
a lawyer of the Northern Neck, a very   
able, logical and correct speaker. Mr.   
Henry moved and Johnston seconded   
these resolutions successively. They   
were opposed by Randolph, Pendleton,   
Nicholas, Wythe and all the old mem­  
bers whose influence in the House had   
  
till then been unbroken. They did it,   
not from any question of our rights, but   
on the ground that the same sentiments   
had been, at their preceding session, ex­  
pressed in a more conciliatory form, to   
which the answers were not yet received.   
  
But torrents of sublime eloquenc   
from Mr. Henry, backed by the solid   
reasoning of Johnston, prevailed. The   
last, however, and strongest resolution   
wascarried butby asinglevote. The de­  
bate on it was most bloody. I was then   
but a student and was listening at the   
door of the lobby, (for as yet there was   
no gallery) when Peyton Randolph,   
after the vote, came out of the House   
and said, as he entered the lobby : &quot;By   
God I would have given five hundred   
guineas for a single vote.&quot; For as this   
would have divided the House, the vote   
of the Speaker would have rejected the   
resolution. Mr. Henry left town that   
evening, and the next morning before   
the meeting of the House I saw Peter   
Randolph, then of the Council, but who   
had formerly been Clerk to the House,   
for an hour or two at the Clerk&#x27;s table   
searching the old journals for a prece­  
dent while he was clerk of a resolution   
of the House erased from the journals   
by a subsequent order of the House.   
Whether he found it or not I do not re­  
member; but when the House met a   
motion was made and carried to erase   
that resolution ; and there being at that   
day but one printer and he entirely   
under the control of the Governor, I do   
not know that this resolution ever ap­  
peared in print. I write this from   
memory, but the impression made on   
me at the time :was such as to fix the   
facts indelibly in my mind.   
I came into the Legislature as a bur­  
gess for Albermarle in the winter of   
1768.-9, on the access of Lord Botetourt   
to the government, and about nine years   
after Mr. Henry had entered on the   
stage of public life. The exact confor­  
mity of our political opinions strength­  
ened our friendship, and, indeed, the   
old leaders of the House being substan­  
tially firm we had not after this any   
differences of opinion in the H. of B.   
on matters of form. We were dissolved   
by Lord Botetourt at our first session,   
but all were re-elected. There being no   
divisions among us, occasions became   
very rare for the display of Mr. H&#x27;s elo­  
quence. In ordinary business he was a   
very inefficient member. He could not   
draw a bill on the most simple subject   
which would bear legal Briticism, or   
even the ordinary criticism which   
looks to the correctness of style and   
idea; for, indeed, there was no accu­  
racy of idea in his head. His imagine-  
  
NUMBER 30   
  
tion was copious, poetical, sublime, but&#x27;   
vague also. He said the strongest   
things in the finest language, but with   
JI   
-  
out arrangement, desultorily. This   
appeared eminently and in a mortify   
ing degree in the Ist session of the Ist   
Congress, which met in Sept. 1774. Mr.   
Henry and Richard Henry Lee took at   
once the lead in that assembly, and, by   
the high style of their eloquence were,   
in the first days of the session, looked   
up to as priori inter pares. A, petition   
to the King, an address to the people of   
Great Britain, and a memorial to the   
people of British America were agreed   
to be drawn. Lee, Henry and others   
were appointed for the first, and Lee,   
Livingston and Jay for the two last.   
The splendor •of their debut occa­  
sioned Mr. Henry to be designated by   
his committee to draw the petition to   
the King, with which they were   
charged, and Mr. Lee was charged with   
the address to the people of England.   
The last was first reported. On reading   
it every countenance fell and a dead   
silence ensued for many minutes. At   
length, it was laid on the table for   
perusal and consideration till the next   
day, when first one member, and then   
another, arose, and paying some faint   
compliments to the composition, ob­  
served that there were still certain con­  
siderations not expressed in it which   
should properly fine a place in it. At   
length Mr. Livingston, (the Governor   
of N. J.,) a member of the committee,   
rose and observed that a friend of his   
had been sketching what he had thought   
might be proper for such an address,   
from which he thought some paragraphs   
might be advantageously introduced in­  
to the draught proposed ; and he read an   
address, which Mr. Jay had prepared de   
bene esse, as it were. There was but one   
sentiment of admiration. The address   
was recommitted for amendment, and   
Mr. Jay&#x27;s draught reported and   
adopted with scarce any alteration.   
These facts were stated to me by Mr.   
Pendleton and Col. Harrison, of our   
own delegation, (except that Col. Har­  
rison ascribed the draught to Gov. Liv­  
ingston,)and were afterwards confirmed   
to me by Gov&#x27;r Livingston ; and I will   
presently mention an anecdote confir­  
mation of them, from Mr. Jay and R.   
H. L. themselves.   
Mr. Henry&#x27;s draught of a petition to   
the King was equally unsuccessful and   
was recommitted for amendment. Mr.   
John Dickinson was added to the com­  
mittee, and a new draught prepared by   
him was passed.   
The occasion of my learning from Mr.   
Jay that he was the author of the ad­  
dress to the people of Great Britain re­  
quires explanation by a statement of   
some preceding circumstances. The   
2d session of the Ist Congress met, on   
their own adjournment, in May, 1775.   
Peyton Randolph was their President.   
In the meantime Lord North&#x27;s concili­  
atory propositions came over to be laid   
by the Governors before their Legisla­  
tures. Lord Dunmore accordingly   
called that of Virginia to meet in June.   
This obliged P. Randolph, as Speaker,   
to return. Our other old members be­  
ing at Congress, he pressed me to draw   
the answer to Lord North&#x27;s proposition.   
I accordingly did so, and it passed with   
a little softening of some expressions for   
which the times were not yet ripe, and   
wire-drawing and weakening others to   
satisfy individuals. I had been ap­  
pointed to go on to Congress in place of   
Peyton Randolph, and proceeded im­  
mediately, charged with presenting   
this answer to Congress. As it   
was the first which had been given,   
and the tone of it was strong, the mem­  
bers were pleased with it, hoping it   
would have a good effect on the an­  
swers of the other States. A commit­  
tee which had been appointed to pre­  
pare a declaration to be published by   
General Washington on his arrival at   
the army, having reported one, it was   
recommitted, and Dickinson and my­  
self added to the Committee. On the   
adjournment of the House,  
happening   
to go out with &#x27;Governor Livingston,   
one of the committee,  
I expressed to   
him my hope he would draw the dec­  
laration. He modestly excused him­  
self, and expressed his wish that I   
would do it. But, urging him with   
considerable importunity, he at length   
said: &quot;you and I, sir, are but new ac­  
quaintances; what can have excited so   
earnest a desire on your part that I   
should be the draughtsman ?&quot; &quot; Why,   
air,&quot; said I, &quot; I have been informed you   
drew the address to the people of Great   
Britain. I think it the first composition   
in the English language; and, there­  
fore, am anxious this declaration should   
be prepared by the same pen.&quot; He re­  
plied &#x27; that I might have been misin­  
formed on that subject.&quot; A few days   
after, being in conversation with R. H.   
Lee in Congress Hall, a little before the   
meeting of the House, Mr. Jay observ­  
ing   
us, came up, and taking R. H. Lee   
by a button of the coat, said to him   
pretty sternly : &quot; I understand, sir, that   
you informed this gentleman that the   
address to the people of Great   
Britain, presented to the committee by   
me, was drawn by Governor Livings­  
ton.&#x27; The fact was that the committee   
having consisted of only Lee, Livings­  
ton, who was father-in-law of Jay, and   
Jay himself, and Lee&#x27;s draught having &#x27;   
been rejected, and Jay&#x27;s approved so   
unequivocally, his suspicions naturally   
fell on Lee as author of the report, and   
the rather, as they daily had much spar­  
ring in Congress, Lee being firm in the   
revolutionary measures, and Jay hang­  
ing heavily on their rear. I immedi­  
ately stopped Mr. Jay, and assured him   
that, though I had indeed been so in­  
formed, it was not by Mr. Lee, whom I   
had never heard utter a word on the   
subject.   
I found Mr. Henry to be a silent and   
almost unmeddling member of. Con.   
gress. On the original opening of that   
body, while general grievances were the   
topic, he was in his element, and capti­  
vated all by his bold and splendid elo­  
quence. But as soon as they came to   
specific matters, to sober reasoning and   
solid argumentation, he had the good   
sense to perceive that his declamation,   
however excellent in its groper place,   
had no weight at all in such an assembly   
as that, of cool headed, reflecting, judi­  
cious men. He ceased, therefore, in a   
great measure, to take any part in the   
business. He seemed, indeed, very   
tired of the place and wonderfully re­  
lieved when, by appointment of the   
Virginia Convention to be Colonel of   
their first regiment, he was permitted   
to leave Congress about the last of July.   
How he acquitted himself of his mili­  
tary command will be better known   
from others. He was relieved from this   
position again by being appointed Gov­  
ernor on the first organization of the   
government. After my service as his   
successorin the same office, my appoint­  
ment to Congress in 1783, mission to   
Europe in 1781 and appointment in the   
new government in 1789 kept us so far   
apart that I had no further personal   
knowledge of him.   
Mr. Henry began his career with   
very little property. He acted, as I   
have understood, as barkeeper in the   
tavern at Hanover C. H. for some time.   
He married very young, settled, I be­  
lieve, at a place called the Roundabout   
in Louisa, got credit for some little   
stores of merchaddize, but very soon   
failed. From this he turned his views   
to the law, for the acquisition or prac­  
tice of which, however, he was too   
lazy. Whenever the&#x27;courts were closed   
for the winter session he would make   
up a party of poor hunters of his neigh­  
borhood, would go off with them to the   
piny woods of Fluvanna and pass   
weeks in hunting deer, of which he   
was passionately fond, sleeping under   
a tent, before a fire, wearing the same   
shirt the whole time, and covering all   
the dirt of his dress with a hunting   
shirt. He never undertook to draw   
pleadings If he could avoid it, or to   
manage that part of a cause and very   
unwillingly engaged but as an assistant   
to speak in the cause. And the   
fee was an indispensable pre­  
liminary, observing to the appli­  
cant that he kept no accounts, never   
putting pen to paper, which was true.   
Pr&#x27; spowers over a jury were so irresis­  
tible that he received great fees for his   
services, and had the reputation of be­  
ing insatiable in money. Alter about   
ten years practice in the County Courts   
he came to the GenerarCourt, where,   
however, being totally unqualified for

anything but mere jury causes, he de­  
voted himself to these and chiefly to the   
criminal business. From these poor   
devils it was always understood that he   
squeezed exorbitant fees of £5O, £lOO   
and £2OO. From this source he made   
his great profits, and they were said to   
be great. His other business, exclusive   
of the criminal, would never, I ant sure,   
pay the expenses of his attendance.   
He now purchased from Mr. Lomax   
the valuable estate on the waters of   
Smith&#x27;s River, to which he afterwards   
removed. The purchase was on long   
credit and finally paid in depreciated   
paper, not worth oak leaves. About   
the close of the war he engaged in   
the Yazoo speculation, and bought   
up a great deal of depreciated paper at   
2s. and 2s. lid. In the pound to pay for   
it. At the close of the war many of us   
wished to reopen all accounts which   
had been paid in depreciated money,   
and have them settled by the scale tof   
depreciation. But on this he frowned   
most indignantly, and, knowing the   
general indisposition of the Legislature,   
it was considered hopeless to attempt it   
with such an opponent at their head as   
Henry. I believe he never distinguished   
himself so much as on the similar ques­  
tion of British debts in the case of Jones   
and Walker. He had exerted a degree   
of interest in that case totally foreign to   
his character, and not only seemed, but   
had made himself really learned on the   
subject. Another of the great occasions   
on which he exhibited examples of elo­  
quence such as probably had never been   
exceeded was on the question of adopt­  
ing the new Constitution iu 17SS. To   
this he was most violently opposed, as   
is well known ; and after its adoption   
he continued hostile to it, expressing   
more than any other man in the U. S.   
his thorough contempt and hatred of   
General Washington. From being the   
most violentof all anti-Federalists, how­  
ever he was brought over to the new   
Constitution by his Yazoo speculation,   
before mentioned. The Georgia Legis­  
lature having declared that transaction   
fraudulent and void, the depreciated   
paper which he had bought up to pay   
for the Yazoo purchase was likely to   
remain on his hands worth nothing.   
But Hamilton&#x27;s funding system came   
most opportunely to his relief and sud­  
denly raised his paper from 2s. I id. to   
275. rid. the pound. Hamilton became   
now his idol, and abandoning the Re­  
publican advocates of the Constitution,   
the Federal government on Federal   
principles became his political creed.   
General Washington flattered him   
by au appointment to a mission   
to Spain, which he declined ; and   
by proposing to him the office of   
Secretary of State, on the most earnest   
solicitation of ( leneral Henry Lee, who   
pledged himself that Henry should not   
accept it. For General Washington   
knew that he was entirely unqualified   
for it, and moreover that his self-esteem   
had never suffered hiin to act as second   
to any man on earth. I had this fact   
from information, but that of the mis­  
sion to Spain is of my own knowledge,   
because, after my retiring from the   
office of Secretary of State, Gen&#x27;. Wash­  
ington passed the papers to Mr. Henry   
through my hands. Mr. Henry&#x27;s apos­  
tacy sunk him to nothing in the estima­  
tion of his country. lie lost at once all   
that influence which Federalism had   
hoped, by cajoling him, to transfer with   
him to itself; and a man who, through   
a long and active life, had been the idol   
of his country beyond any one that ever   
lived, descended to the grave with less   
than its indifference, and verified tho   
saying Of the philosopher, that no man   
must be called happy till he is dead.

My acq® with mr Henry commenced in the  
winter of 1759-60. on my way to the college I  
past the X™* holidays at Cole Dandridge’s, in  
Hanover, to whom mr Henry was a near neigh.  
bor. during the festivity of the season I met  
him in society every day, &amp; we became well ac-  
quainted, altho I was much his junior, being then  
but in my 17&quot; year &amp; hea married man. The  
spring following he came to W™bg to obtain a  
license as a lawyer, &amp; he called on me at college.  
he told me he had been reading law only 6. weeks.  
two of the examiners, however, Peyton &amp; John  
Randolph, men of great facility of temper, signed  
his license with as much reluctance as their dis-  
positions would permit them to shew.  
  
mr Wythe absolutely refused. Rob: C. Nicholas  
refused also at first, but on repeated importuni-  
ties and promises of future reading, he signed.  
these facts I had afterwds from the gentlemen  
themselves, the two Randolphs acknoleging he  
was very ignorant of law, but that they percieved  
him to be a young man of genius, &amp; did not  
doubt he would soon qualify himself.  
  
He was some time after elected a representa-  
tive of the county of Hanover and brought him-  
self into public notice on the following occasion,  
which, I think took placein 1762. ora year sooner  
or later. the gentlemen of this country had at  
that time become deeply involved in that state of  
indebtment which has since ended in so general a  
crush of their fortunes. Robinson the Speaker  
was also Treasurer, an officer always chosen by  
the Assembly. he was an excellent map, liberal,

on his own account great sums of money to per-  
sons of this description, &amp; especially those who  
were of the assembly. he used freely for this  
purpose the public money, confiding for it’s re-  
  
acement in his own means &amp; the securities he  
  
d taken on those loans. about this time how-  
ever he became sensible that his deficit to the  
public was become so enormous as that a discov-  
ery must soon take place, for as yet the public  
had no suspicion of it. he devised therefore with  
his friends in the assembly a plan for a public  
loan office to a certain amount, from which monies  
might be lent on public acct &amp; on good landed  
security to individuals. this was accordingly  
brought forward in the House of Burgesses, and,  
had it succeeded, the debts due to Robinson on  
these loans would have been transferred to the  
public, &amp; his deficit thus compleetly covered.  
this state of things however was not yet known;  
but mr Henry attacked the scheme on other gen-  
eral grounds in that &amp;tyle of bold grand and  
overwhelming eloquence, for which he became so  
justly celebrated afterwds. he carried with him  
all the members of the upper counties, and left a  
minority composed merely of the aristocracy of  
the country. from this time his popularity  
  
swelled apace, &amp; Robinson dying 4. years after,  
his deficit was brought to light, &amp; discovered the  
true object of the proposition.  
  
The next great occasion on which he signalised  
himself was that which may be considered as the  
  
dawn of the Kevoln. in March 1774. the British  
parliament had passed resolns. preparatory to  
the levying a revenue on the colonies by a stamp  
tax. the Virginia assembly at their next session,  
prepared &amp; sent to England very elaborate repre-  
sentns addressed in separate forms to the King,  
Lords and Commons, against the right to impose  
such taxes. the famous stamp act was, however,  
past in Jan., 1765 and in the session of the Virgi  
assembly of May following, mr Henry introduced  
the celebrated resolns of that date. these were  
drawn by George Johnston, a lawyer of the  
Northern neck, a very able, logical. and correct  
speaker. mr Henry moved and Johnston seconded  
these resolns successively. they were opposed by  
Randolph, Blood, Pendleton, Nicholas, Wythe &amp;  
all the old members whose influence in the house  
had till then been unbroken. they did it, not  
from any question of our rights, but on the ground  
that the same sentiments had been at their pre-  
ceding session expressed in a more conciliatory  
form to which the answers were not yet received.  
but torrents of sublime eloquence from mr Henry,  
backed by the solid reasoning of Johnston, pre-  
vailed. the last however, &amp; strongest resoln was  
carried bit by a single vote. the debate on it  
was most bloody. I was then but a student and  
was listening at the door of the lobby (for as yet  
there was no gallery) when Peyton Randolph,

after.the vote, came out of the house and said, as  
he entered the lobby “By god I would have  
“ given 500 guineas for a single vote” for as this  
would have divided the house, the vote of Robin-  
son, the speaker, would have rejected the resolu-  
tion. mr Henry left town that evening and the  
next morning before the meeting of the house, I  
saw Peter Randolph, then of the Council, but  
who had formerly been clerk to the house, for an  
hour or two at the clerk’s table searching the old  
journals for a precedent while he was clerk, of a  
resolution of the house erased from the journals  
by a subsequent order of the house, whether he  
found it or not I do not remember; but when the  
house met, a motion was made &amp; carried to erase  
that resoln; and there being at that day but one  
printer, &amp; he entirely under the controul of the  
governor, I do not know that this resoln ever ap-  
peared in print. I write this from memory, but  
the impression made on me, at the time, was such  
as to fix the facts indelibly in my mind.  
  
I came into the Legislature as a burgess for  
Albermarle in the winter of 1768/9. on the ac-  
cession of L’d. Botetourt to the government and  
about 9. years after mr Henry had entered on the  
stage of public life. the exact conformity of our  
political opinions strengthened our friendship,  
and indeed, the old leaders of the house being  
substantially firm, we had not after this any dif-  
ferences of opn in the H. of B. on matters of prin-  
ciple, tho sometimes on matters of form. we were  
dissolved by Ld Botetourt at our first sesssion ;  
but all were re-elected. there being no divisions  
among us, occasions became very rare for any  
display of mr H.’s eloquence. in ordinary, busi-  
ness he was a very inefficient member. he could  
not draw a bill on the most simple subject which  
wd bear legal criticism, or even the ordinary crit-  
icism which looks to correctness of style &amp; idea  
for indeed there was no accuracy of idea in his  
head. his imagination was copious, poetical,  
sublime, but vague also. he said the strongest  
things in the finest language, but without logic,  
without arrangement, desultoryly. this appeared  
eminently &amp; in a mortifying degree in the 1* ses-  
sion of the 1** Congress which met in Sep 1774.  
  
mr Henry &amp; Richard Henry Lee took at nce  
the lead in that assembly, and by the high’‘style  
of their eloquence were in the first days of the  
session looked up to as primi inter pares. a peti-  
fion to the King, an Address to the people of G  
Britain, and a Memorial to the people of British  
America were agreed to be drawn. Lee, Henry  
&amp; others were appointed for the first, &amp; Lee, Liv-  
ingston &amp; Jay for the two last. the splendor of  
their debut occasioned mr Henry to be designated  
by his commee to draw the petn to the king, with  
which they were charged, and mr Lee was charged  
with the address to the people of England. the  
last was first reported. on reading it every coun-  
  
  
  
92  
  
tenance fell and a dead silence ensued for many  
minutes. at length, it was laid on the table for  
perusal and considn till the next day when first  
one member, and then another arose, &amp; paying  
some faint compliments to the composition ob-  
served that there were still certain considerns not  
expressed in it, which should pens find a place  
init. at length mr Livingston (the Govr of N. J.)  
a member of the commee rose &amp; observed that a  
friend of his had been sketching what he had  
thought might be proper for such an address,  
from which he thought some paragraphs might  
be advantageously introduced into the draught  
proposed: and he read an address which mr Jay  
had prepared de bene esse as it were. There was  
but one sentiment of admirn. the address was re-  
committed for amendment, and mr Jay’s draught  
reported &amp; adopted with scarce any altern. these  
facts were stated to me by mr Pendleton and  
  
Col’. Harrison ascribed the draught to Govr,  
Livingston &amp; were afterwards confirmed to me by  
Gov’r Livingston, &amp; I will presently mention an  
anecdote confirmative of them from mr Jay and  
R. H. Lee themselves.  
  
Mr. Henry’s draught of « petn to the king was  
equally unsuccessful, and was recommitted for  
amendment. mr John Dickerson was added to  
  
the commee &amp; a new draught prepared by him  
was passed.  
  
The occasion of my learning from mr Jay that  
he was the author of the Address to the people  
  
of Gr. Britain requires explanation by a statement  
of some preceding circumstances. The 2* session  
of the 1** Congress met on their own adjmt in  
May, 1775. Peyton Randolph was their presi-  
dent. in the meantime Ld. North’s conciliatory  
proposns came over to be laid by the Governors  
before their legislatures. Ld. Dunmore accdly  
called that of Virginia to meet in June. This  
obliged P. Randolph as Speaker to return. our  
other old members being at Congress, he pressed  
me to draw the answer to Ld. North’s proposn.  
I acedly did so, and it passed with a little soft-  
ening of some expressions for which the times  
were not yet ripe &amp; wire-drawing &amp; weakening  
some others to satisfy individuals. I had been  
appointed to go on to Congress in place of Peyton  
Randolph, &amp; proceeded immediately, charged  
with presenting this answer to Congress. as i  
was the first which had been given, and the ton  
  
of it was strong the members were pleased with  
it hoping it would have a good effect on the  
answers of the other states. a Commee which had  
been appointed to prepare a Declaration to be  
published by Genl. Washington on his arrival at  
the army, having reported one, it was recommit-  
ted, &amp; Dickinson &amp; myself added to the commee.

expressed to him my hope he would draw the  
Declaration. he modestly excused himself, &amp; ex-  
pressed his wish that I would do it. but urging  
him with considerable importunity, he at length  
said “ you &amp; I, sir, are but new acquaintances:  
“what can have excited so earnest a desire on

of the coat said to him pretty sternly, “ I under-

“that the Address to the people of Gr. Br. pre-  
“sented to the commee by me was drawn by  
“Govr. Livingston.” the fact was that the Com-  
mee having consisted of only Lee, Livingston, who  
was fath-in 1. of Jay &amp; Jay himself &amp; Lee’s  
draught having been rejected &amp; Jay’s approved  
so unequivocally, his suspicions naturally fell on  
Lee as author of the report; &amp; the rather as they  
had daily much sparring in Congress, Lee being  
firm in the revolutionary measures, and Jay  
hanging heavily on their rear. I immediately  
stopped mr Jay, and assured him that tho’ I had  
indeed been so informed, it was not by mr Lee,  
whom I had never heard utter a word on the sub-  
ject.  
  
I found mr Henry to be a silent &amp; almost un-  
meddling member in Congress, on the original  
opening of that body, while general grievances  
were the topic, he was in his element &amp; capti-  
vated all by his bold &amp; splendid eloquence. but  
as soon as they came to specific matters, to sober  
reasoning and solid argumentation he had the  
good sense to perceive that his declamation how-  
ever excellent in it’s proper place, had no weight  
at all in‘’such an assembly as that, of cool-headed,  
reflecting, judicious men. he ceased therefore in  
a great measure to take any part in the business.  
he seemed indeed very tired of the place &amp; won-  
derfully relieved when, by appointment of the  
Virginia convention to be Col*. of their 1* regi-  
ment he was permitted to leave Congress about  
the last of July. how he acquitted himself in his  
military command will be better known from  
others. he was relieved from this position again  
by being appointed Governor on the first organi-  
zation of the government. after my service as  
his successor in the same office my appointment  
to Congress in 1783. mission to Europé in 84. &amp;  
appointment in the new govmt in 89, kept us 80  
far apart that I had no further personal knolege  
of him.  
  
  
  
1867.)  
  
M&#x27; Henry began his career with very little  
mpoperty. he acted, as I have understood, as  
eeper in the tavern at Hanover C. H. for  
sometime. he married very young; settled, I  
believe, at a place called the Roundabout in  
Louisa, got credit for some little store of mer-  
chahdize, but very soon failed. from this he  
turned his views to the law, for the acquision  
or practice of which however he was too lazy.  
whenever the courts were closed for the winter  
session, he would make up a party of poor  
hunters of his neighborhood, would go off with  
them to the pinywoods of Fluvanna, and pass  
weeks in hunting deer, of which he was passion-  
  
wearing the same shirt the whole time, &amp; cover-  
ing all the dirt of his dress with a hunting-shirt.  
he never undertook to draw pleadings if he  
could avoid it or to manage that part of a cause  
&amp; very unwillingly engaged but as an assistant,  
to speak in the cause. and the fee was an indis-  
pensable preliminary, observing to the applicant  
that he kept no accounts, never putting pen to  
paper, w was true. his powers over a jury  
were 80 irresistible that he received great fees for  
his services, &amp; had the reputation of being insa-  
tiable in money. after about 10. years practice  
  
in the County courts he came to the Genl. court, |  
  
where however being totally unqualified for any-  
thing but mere jury causes, he devoted himself to  
these, &amp; chiefly to the criminal business. from  
  
these poor devils it was always understood that  
he squeezed exorbitant fees of £50, 100. &amp; 2002.  
from this source he made his great profits, &amp; they  
  
were said to be great. his other business, exclu-  
sive of the criminal, would never, I um sure, pay  
the expenses of his attendance. he now pur-  
  
chased from mr Lomax the valuable estate on the |  
  
waters of Smith’s river, to which he afterwards  
removed. the purchase was on long credit &amp;  
finally paid in depreciated paper not worth oak  
leaves. about the close of the war he engaged  
in the Yazoo speculation, &amp; bought up a great  
deal of depreciated paper at 2/ &amp; 2/6 in the  
pound to pay for it. at the close of the war,  
many of us wished to reopen all accounts which  
had Seon paid in depreciated money, and have  
them settled by the scale of depreciation. but on  
this he frowned most indignantly, &amp; knowing the  
general indisposition of the legislature, it was  
considered hopeless to attempt it with such an  
opponenj at their head as Henry. I believe he  
never distinguished himself ‘so much as on the  
similar question of British debts in the case of  
Jones &amp; Walker. he had exerted a degree of  
industry in that case totally foreign to his char-  
acter, and not only seemed, but had made him-  
self really learned on the subject. another of  
the great occasions on which he exhibited exam-  
ples of eloquence such as probably had never

Secietary of Stale, on the most earnest solicita­  
tion of uerjeial Henry Lee, who pledged nim­

General Washington knew that ho was entirely  
unqualified for U, and, moreover, that tils self­  
esteem bad never suffered htm to act as second  
to any ninn on earth. I had this fuel from in­  
formation, but that of the mission to Spain Is  
of my own knowledge, because, after ray re­  
tiring from the olllce of Secretary ol State Gene­  
ral Washington passed the papers to Mr. Ueury  
through my bands. Mr. Henry&#x27;s uposlacy sunk  
lilm to uothlug lu tbe estimation of his coun­  
try. He lost at ouce all that Influence whiih  
Federalism bad hoped, by cajoling him. to  
truusfer with blm to Itself; aud a man who,  
Inrough a long and active life, had been tbe  
idol of his country beyond any one that ever  
lived, descended to the grave with less than its  
indifference, and verified the saving of the phi­  
losopher, that no man must be called happy  
until he Is dead.

h somewhat startling and at variance  
with the cherished and traditionary reputa  
tion of the great orator, are far to valuable  
to be suppressed, and form a contribution  
to history which it is strange has been so  
long withheld. They will be read, especially  
those portions derogatory to Mr. Henry as  
a man of personal integrity, with some  
caution. There arestatements in this paper  
the accuracy of which we very much ques­  
tion, and in relation to which we shall in a  
day or two take an opportunity of stating  
our views. The paper, however, whether  
as evidence trustworthy or not, is a great  
curiosity:  
My acquaintance with Mr. Henry com  
menced in the winter of 1759-60. On my  
way to the College I passed the Amas holi­  
days at Col. Dandridge&#x27;s, in Hanover, to  
whom Mr. Henry was a near neighbor.  
During the festivity of the season I met  
him in society every day, and we became  
well acquainted, although I was much his  
junior, being then in but my 17th year and  
he a married man. The spring following  
he came to W&#x27;msb&#x27;g to obtain a license as  
a lawyer, and he called on meat College.  
He told me he had been reading law only  
6 weeks. Two of the examiners, however,  
Peyton and John Randolph, men of great  
facility of temper, signed his license with  
as much reluctance as their dispositions  
would permit them to show. Mr. Wythe  
absolutely refused also Rob. C. Nicholas re­  
fused at first but on repeated importunities  
and promises of future reading, he signed.  
These facts I had afterwards from the gentle  
men themselves, the two Randolphs ac  
knowledging he was very ignorant of law,  
but that they perceived him to be a young  
man of genius and did not doubt he would  
so soon qualify himself.  
He was some time after elected a repre  
sentative of the County of Hanover, and  
brought himself into public notice on the  
following occasion, which, I think, took  
place in 1762, or a year sooner or later. The  
gentlemen of this country had, at that time,  
become deeply involved in that state of in  
debtedness which has since ended in so  
general a crush of their fortune,- the  
Speaker was also Treasurer, an officer al­  
ways chosen by the Assembly. He was an  
excellent man, liberal, friendly andrich. He  
had been drawn in to lend on his own acct.  
great sums of money to persons of this de  
  
scription, and especially those who were of  
  
the Assembly. He used freely for this pur­  
pose the public money, confiding for its re­  
placement in his own means and the securi  
ties he had taken on those loans. About  
this time, however, he became sensible that  
his deficit to the public was become so enor  
mous as that a discovery must soon take  
place, for as yet the public had no suspicion  
of it. He devised, therefore, with his  
friends in the Assembly a plan for a public  
loan office to a certain amount, from which  
monies might be lent on public count, and  
on good landed security, to individuals. This  
was accordingly brought forward in the  
House of Burgesses, and, had it succeeded,  
the debts due to Robinson on these loans  
would have been transferred to the public,  
and his deficit thus completely covered.  
This state of things, however, was not yet  
known; but Mr. Henry attacked the scheme  
on other general grounds in that style of  
bold, grand and overwhelming eloquence  
for which he became so justly celebrated  
afterwards. He carried with him all the  
members of the upper counties, and left  
minority, composed mainly of the aristoc­  
racy of the country. From this time his  
popularity swelled apace, and,-dying  
about 4 years after, his deficit was brought  
to light, and discovered the true object of  
the proposition.  
The next great occasion on which he sig  
nalized himself was that which may be con  
sidered as the dawn of the Revoln, in  
March, 1774. The British Parliament had  
passed resolns, preparatory to the levyng a  
revenue on the colonies by a stamp tax. The  
Virginia Assembly, at their next session,  
prepared and sent to England very elaborate  
representations, addressed, in separate forms,  
to the King, Lords and Commons, against  
the right to impose such taxes. The famous  
Stamp Act was, however, passed in Jan  
1765, and in the session of the Virginia  
Assembly of May following Mr. Henry in  
troduced the celebrated resolutions of that  
date. These were drawn by George John  
son, a lawyer of the Northern Neck, a very  
able, logical and correct speakers. Mr.  
Henry moved and Johnston seconded these  
resolutions successively. They were opposed  
by Randolph, Pendleton, Nicholas, Wythe  
and all the old members whose influence in  
the House had till then been unbroken.  
They did it, not from any question of our  
rights, but on the ground that the same sen  
timents had been, at their preceding session  
expressed in a more conciliatory form, to  
which the answers were not yet received.  
But torrents of sublime eloquence from Mr.  
Henry, backed by the solid reasoning of  
Johnston, prevailed. The last, however,  
and strongest resolution was carried but by  
a single vote. The debate on it was most  
bloody. I was then but a student and was  
listening at thedoor of the lobby (for as yet  
there was no gallery) when Peyton Randolph  
after the vote, came out of the House and  
said, as he entered the lobby: &quot;By God I  
would have given five hundred guineas for  
a single vote.&quot; or as this would have i  
vided the House, the vote of the Speaker  
would have rejected the resolution. Mr.  
Henry left town that evening, and the next  
morning before the meeting of the House I  
saw Peter Randolph, then of the Council,  
but who had formerly been Clerk to the  
House, for an hour or two at the Clerk&#x27;s  
table searching the old journals for a pre  
cedent while he was clerk of a resolution of  
the House erased from the journals by a  
subsequent order of the House. Whether  
he found it or not I do not remember; but  
when the House met a motion was made  
and carried to crase that resolution; and  
there being at that day but one printer and  
he entirely under the control of the Gover­  
nor, I do not know that this resolution ever  
appeared in print. I write this from mem­  
ory, but the impression made on me at the  
time was such as to fix the facts indelibly in  
my mind.  
I came into the Legislature as a burgess  
for Albemarie in the winter of 1768-9, on  
the accession of L&#x27;d Botetourt to the gov­  
ernment, and about nine years after Mr.  
Henry had entered on the stage of public  
life. The exact conformity of our political  
opinions strengthened our friendship, and,  
indeed, the old leaders of the House being  
substantially firm we had not after this any  
differences of opinion in the H. of B. on  
matters of principle, though sometimes on  
matters of form. We were dissolved by  
Ld. Botetourt at our first session, but all  
were re-elected. There being no divisions  
among us, occasions became very rare for  
the display of Mr. H.&#x27;s eloquence. In ordi­  
nary business he was a very inefficient mem-  
ber. He could not draw a bill on the most  
simple subject which would bear legal criti­  
cism, or even the ordinary criticism which  
looks to the correctness of style and idea;  
for, indeed, there was no accuracy of idea  
in his head. His imagination was copious,  
poetical, sublime, but vague also. He said  
the strongest things in the finest language,  
but without logic, without arrangement,  
desultorily. This appeared eminently and  
in a mortifying degree in the first session of  
the first Congress, which met in September,  
1774. Mr. Henry and Richard Henry Lee  
took at once the lead in that assembly, and  
by the high style of their eloquence were,  
in the first days of the session, looked up to  
as prims snter pares. A petition to the  
King, an address to the people of Great  
Britain, and a memorial to the people of  
British America were agreed to be drawn  
Lee, Henry and others were appointed for  
the first, and Lee, Livingston and Jay for  
the two last. The splendor of their debut  
occasioned Mr. Henry to be designated by  
his committes to draw the petition to the  
  
King, with which they were charged, and  
Mr. Lee was charged with the address to  
  
the people of England. The last was first  
reported. On reading it every countenance  
fell and a dead silence ensued for many min-  
utes. At length, it was laid on the table for  
perusal and consideration till the next day,  
when first one member, and then another,  
arose, and paying some faint compliments  
to the composition, observed that there were  
still certain considerations not expressed in  
it which should properly find a place in it  
At length Mr. Livingston, the Governor  
of N. J.,) a member of the committee, rose  
and observed that a friend of his had been  
sketching what he had thought might be  
proper for such an address, from which he  
thought some paragraphs might be advan  
tageously introduced into the draught pro  
posed; and he read an address which Mr  
Jay had prepared de bene esse, as it were.  
There was but one sentiment of admiration.  
The address was recommitted for amend  
ment, and Mr. Jay&#x27;s draught reported and  
adopted with scarce any alternation. These  
facts were stated to me by Mr. Pendleton  
and Col. Harrison, of our own delegation,  
(except that Col. Harrison ascribed the  
draught to Gov&#x27;r. Livingston,) and were  
afterwards confirmed to me by Gov&#x27;r Liv­  
ingston; and I will presently mention an  
anecdote confermative of them, from Mr.  
Jay and R. H. L, themselves.  
Mr. Henry&#x27;s draught of a petition to the  
King was equally unsuccessful and was re  
committed for amendment. Mr. John  
Dickinson was added to the committee, and  
a new draught prepared by him was passed.  
The occasion of my learning from Mr.Jay  
that he was the author of the address to the  
people of Gr. Britain requires explanation  
by a statement of some preceding circum  
stances. The 2d session of the 1st Congress  
met, on their own adjournment, in May,  
1775. Peyton Randolph was their Presi  
dent. In the meantime Ld. North&#x27;s con­  
ciliatory proposition came over to be laid by  
the Governors before their Legislatures.  
Ld. Dunmore accordingly called that of Vir  
ginia to meet in June. This obliged P.  
Randolph, as Speaker, to return. Our  
other old members being at Congress, he  
pressed me to draw the answer to Ld. North&#x27;s  
proposition. I accordingly did so, and it  
passed with a little softening of some ex  
pressions for which the times were not yet  
ripe, and wire-drawing and weakening oth  
ers to satisfy individuals. I had been ap  
pointed to go on to congress in place of  
Peyton Randolph, and proceeded immedi  
ately, charged with presenting this answer  
to Congress. As it was the first which had  
been given, and the tone of it was strong,  
the members were pleased with it, hoping  
it would have a good effect on the answers  
of the other States. A committee which  
had been appointed to prepare a declaration  
to be published by Gena Washington on his  
arrival at the army, having reported one,  
it was recommitted, and Dickinson and my­  
self added to the committee. On the ad  
journment of the House, happening to go  
out with Govr. Livingston, one of the com­  
mittee, I expressed to him my hope he  
would draw the declaration. He modestly  
excused himself and expressed his wish that  
I would do it. But, urging him with con  
siderable importunity, he at length said:  
&quot;you and I, sir, are but new acquaintances;  
what can have excited so earnest a desire  
on your part that I should be the draughts­  
man?&quot; &quot;Why sir,&quot; said I, &quot;I have been  
informed you drew the address to the people  
Great Britain. I think it the first compo­  
sition in the English language; and, there  
fore, am anxious this declaration should be  
prepared by the same pen.&quot; He replied,  
&quot;that I might have been misinformed on  
that subject.&quot; A few days after, being in  
conversation with R. H. Lee, in Congress  
Hall, a little before the meeting of the  
House, Mr. Jay observing us, came up, and  
taking R. H. Lee by a button on the coat,  
said to him pretty sternly: &quot;I understand,  
sir, that you informed this gentleman that  
the address to the people of Great Britain  
presented to the committee by me, was  
drawn by Govr. Livingston.&quot; The fact was  
that the committee having consisted of only  
Lee, Livingston, who was fother-in-law of  
Jay, and Jay himself, and Lee&#x27;s draught  
having been rejected, and Jay&#x27;s approved so  
unequivocally, his suspicions naturany fell  
on Lee as author of the report, and the  
rather, as they daily had much sparring in  
Congress, Lee being firm in the revolution­  
ary measures, and Jay hanging heavily on  
their rear, I immediatery stopped Mr.  
Jay, and assured him that, though I had  
indeed been so informed, it was not by Mr.  
Lee, whom I had never heard utter a word  
on the subject.  
I found Mr. Henry to be a silent and al­  
most unmeddling member of Congress. On  
the original opening of that body, while  
general grievances were the topic, he was  
in his element, and captivated all by his  
bold and splendid cloquence. But as soon  
as they came to specific matters, to sober  
reasoning and solid argumentation, he had  
the good sense to preceive that his decla­  
mation, however excellent in its propper  
place, had no weight at all in such an assem­  
bly as that, of cool-headed, reflecting, judi­  
cious men. He ceased, therefore, in a  
great measre, to take any part in the busl  
He seemed, indeed, very tired of the  
place, and wonderfully relieved, by appoint­  
ment of the Virginia Convention to be Col.  
of their first regiment, he was permitted to  
leave Congress about the last of July. How  
he acquitted himself of his military command  
will be better known from others. He was  
relieved from this position again by being  
appointed Governor on the first organisatios  
  
of the Government. After my service as his  
successor in the same office, my appointment  
to Congress in 1783, mission to Europe in  
84 and appointment in the new governmont  
in &#x27;89 kept us so far apart that I had no  
further personal knowledge of him.  
Mr. Henry began his career with very  
little property. He acted, as I have under­  
stood, as barkeeper in the tavern at Hano­  
ver C. H. for some time. He married very  
young, settled, I believe, at a place called  
the Roundabout in Louisa, got credit for  
some little store of merchandize, but very  
soon failed. From this he turned his views  
to the law, for the acquisition or practice of  
which, however, he was too lazy. Wheney­  
er the courts were closed for the winter ses­  
sion he would make up a party of poor  
hunters of his neighborhood, would go off  
  
with them to the piny woods of Fluvanna  
and pass weeks in hunting deer, of which  
he was passionately fond, sleeping under a  
tent, before a fire, wearing the same shirt  
the whole time, and covering all the dirt of  
his dress with a hunting-shirt. He never  
undertook to draw pleedings if he could  
avoid it, or to manage that part of a cause  
and very unwillingly engaged but as an as  
sistant to speak in the cause. And the fee  
was an indespensible preliminary, observing  
to the applicant that he kept no accounts,  
never putting pen to paper, which was true.  
His powers over a jury were so irresistable  
that he received great fees for his services,  
and had the reputation of being insatiable  
in money. After about ten years practice  
in the County Courts he came to the Genl.  
Court, where, however, being totally unquali  
fied for anything but mere jury causes, he  
devoted himself to these and chiefly to the  
criminal business. From these poor devils  
it was always understood that he squeezed  
exorbitant fees of $50, $100 and $200.  
From this source he made his great profits,  
and they were said to be great. His other  
business, exclusive of the crimnal, would  
never, I am sure, pay the expences of his  
attendance. He now purchased from Mr.  
Lomax the valuable estate on the waters of  
Smith&#x27;s River, to which he afterwards re  
moved. The burchase was on long credit  
and finally paid in depreciated paper, not  
worth oak leaves. About the close of the  
war he engaged in the Yazoo speculation,  
and bought up a great deal of depreciated  
paper at 2s, and 2s. 6d, in the pound to pay  
for it. At the close of the war many of us  
wished to reopen all accounts which had  
been paid in depreciated money, and have  
them settled by the scale of depreciation.  
But on this he frowned most indignantly,  
and, knowing the general indisposition of  
the Legislature, it was considered hopeless  
to attempt it with such an opponent at their  
head as Henry. I believe he never distin  
guished himself so much as on the similar  
question of British debts in the case of  
Jones and Walker. He had exerted a de  
gree of interest in that case totally foreign  
to his character, and not only seemed, but  
had made himself really, learned on the  
subject. Another of the great occasions on  
which he exhibited examples of eloquence  
such as probably had never been exceeded  
was on the question of adopting the new  
Conslitution in 1788. To this he was most  
violently opposed, as is well known; and  
after this adoption he continued hostile to  
it, expressing more than any other man in  
the United States his thorough contempt and  
hatred of General Washington. From be­  
ing the vilest of all anti-Federalists, however  
he was brought over to the new Constitution  
by his Yazoo speculation, before mentioned.  
The Georgia Legislature having declaired  
that transaction fraudulent and void, the  
depreciated paper which he had bought up  
to pay for the Yazoo purchase was likely to  
remain on his hands worth nothing. But  
Hamilton&#x27;s funding system came most oppor  
tunely to his relief and suddenly raised his  
paper from 28. 6d, to 27s. 6d, the pound.  
Hamilton pecame now his idol, and aban  
doning the Republican advocates of the  
Constitution, the Federal government on  
Federal principles became his political creed,  
Genr Washington flattered him by an ap­  
pointment to a mission to Spain, which he  
declined; and by proposing to him the  
office of Secretary of State, on the most ear  
nest solicitation of General Henry Lee, who  
pledged himself that Henry should not ac-  
ceept it. For General Washington knew  
that he was entirely unqualified for it, and  
moreover that his selfesteem had never  
suffered him to act as second to any man  
on earth. I had this fact from information,  
but that of the mission to Spain is of my  
own knowledge, because, after my retiring  
from the office of State, General Washington  
passed the papers to Mr. Heny through my  
hands. Mr. Henry&#x27;s apostacy sunk him to  
nothing in the estimation of his country.  
He lost at once all the influence which Fed­  
eralism had hoped, by cajoling him, to  
transfer with him to himself; and a man  
who, through a long and active life, had  
been the idol of his country beyond any one  
that ever lived, descended to the grave with  
less than its indifference, and verrifled the  
saying of the philosopher, that no man must  
be called happy till he is dead.-Philadel

My acquaintance with Mr. Hanry  
commenced in the winter of 1759.  
60. On my way to the College I  
passed the Nmas holidays at Col.  
Dandridge&#x27;s, in Hanover, to whom  
Mr. Henry was a near neighbor.  
During the festivity of the season I  
met him in society every day, and  
we became well acquainted, although  
I was much his junior, being then  
but in my 17th year and he a mar  
ried man. The spring following he  
came to W&#x27;msb&#x27;g to obtain a license  
as a lawyer, and he called on me at  
College. He told me he had been  
reading law only 6 weeks. Two of  
the examiners, however, Peyton and  
John Randolph, men of great facili­  
ty of temper, signed his license with  
as much reluctance as their disposi­  
tions would permit them to show.  
Mr. Wythe abeolutely refused. Rob  
C. Nicholas refused also at first, but  
on repeated inpoctunities and promi  
ses of future reading, he signed  
These fasts I had afterwards from  
the gentlemen themselves, the two  
Randolphs ackaowleodging he was  
very ignorant of law, but that they  
perceived him to be a young man of  
ganius and did not doubt he would  
soon qualify himself.  
  
He was somotime after elected a  
Representative of the county of Han­  
over, and brought himself into pub­  
lie notice on the following occasion,  
which, I think, took place in 1762,  
er a year sconer or later. The gen  
tdemen of this country had at that  
time beseme deely involved in that  
state of indebtedness which has since  
ended in so goneral a crush of their  
fortunes. --the Speaker was  
alse Treasurer, an offleer always cho­  
son by the Asseably. He was as  
excellent man, liberal, friendly, and  
rich. He had besa drawn in to lend  
on his own account great sums of  
money to persons of this description  
and especlally those who were of the  
Assembly. He used freely for this  
purpose the public money, confiding  
for its replacement in his own means  
and the securities he had taken on  
those loass. About this time, how  
ever, he became ssasible that his de­  
felt to the publie was become so  
snormous as that a disoovery must  
soon take place, fer as yet the public  
had no suspicion of it. He ddevised  
therefore, with his frlends in the As­  
sembly a plan for a publis loan office  
to a certain amount, from which  
moneys might be leat on public  
count, and on good landed seourity,  
to individeals. This was according  
ly brought forward in the House of  
Burgesses, and had it suoceoded the  
debts due to Robiason on these lozas  
would have bosn transferred to the  
publie, and his dettoit thas complete  
y covored. This state of things,  
however, was not yet known; but  
Mr. Heary attacked the ssheme os  
other general grounds in that style  
of bold, grand, and overwhelming  
eloqusuce for which he became so  
justly celebrated afterwards. He  
carried with him all the members of  
the apper counties, and left a miner­  
ity, composed mainly of the aristoe­  
racy of the oountry. From this  
time his popularity swelled apece,  
and-- dying about 4 yoars  
after, his deficit was brought to light,  
and discovered the true object of the  
propesition.  
  
The next great occasion on which

membees whess laduence in  
the Houee hadd uilithen besa usbreken.  
They 4ld it, not from any queeuop of  
our rights, but on the groun that the  
same sontimonts had beoe, at theis  
preceding senslce, ezpreaned in a  
mese coneiliatery form, to which the  
answers wese aed yot recelved. But  
torreats of suallms eloquence from  
Mr. Hoary, basded by the solld ress­  
oaing ef Johnston, provalled. The  
last, howaver, andd strongeat resole­  
tions was earried but by a single  
vote. The dobate on it was mest  
bleedy. I was thea but a stueat  
and was listonlng at the deor of the  
lobby (for as yot there was se gal­  
Beyy when Peyton Randolph, after  
the vote, came out of the House and  
  
said, so he entered the lobby: &quot;By  
God, I would have given five hun  
drodd gulseas for a single vote.&quot; o  
as this would have divided the House,  
the vete of the Speaker would have  
rejocted the resolution. Mr. Heary  
left town that evening, and the next  
morning before the meeting of the  
House I saw Peter Randolph, thes  
of the Council, but who had former  
ly been Clerk to the House, for as  
hour or two at the Cierk&#x27;s table  
searching the old journals for a pre  
codent while he was clerk of a reso­  
lution of the House crased from the  
journals by a subsequent order of  
the House. Whether he found it or  
not I do not remember; but when  
the House met a motion was made  
and carrled to srase that resolution;  
and there being at that day but one  
printer and he entirely under the  
control of the Governor, I do not  
know that this resolution ever ap­  
peared in print. I write this from  
memory, but the impression made on  
me at the time was such as to fix the  
facts indelibly in my mind.  
  
I came into the Legislature as a  
burgess for Albermarle in the win  
ter 1768-9, on the accession of I.&#x27;d  
Botetourt to the Government, and  
about nine years after Mr. Henry  
had entered on the stage of public  
life. The exact conformity of our  
political opinions strengthened our  
friendship, and, indeed, the old lead­  
ers of the House being substantially  
firm we had not after this any differ  
ences of opiaion in the H. of B, on  
matters of principle, though some­  
times on matters of form. We were  
dirsolved by Ld. Botetourt at our  
first session, but all were re-elected.  
There being no divisions among us,  
occasions became very rare for the  
display of Mr. H.&#x27;s eloquence. In  
ordinary business he was a very in­  
efficient member. He could not  
draw a bill on the most simple sub­  
ject which would bear legal criticfsm,  
or even the ordinary criticiam which  
looks to the correctness of style and  
idea; for, indeed, there was no ac­  
curacy of idea in his head. His im  
agination was copious, poetical, sub  
lime, but vague also. He said the  
strongest things in the finest lan­  
guage, but without logic, without ar  
rangement, desultorily. This appear  
ed eminently and in a mortifying  
degrse in the first session of the  
Firat Congress, which met in Sep­  
tember, 1774. Mr. Henry and Rich  
ard Henry Lee took at once the lead  
in that assembly, and, by the high  
atyle of their eloquence were, in the  
first days of the session looked up to  
as priwel itater pares. A petition to  
the King, an address to the people of  
Great Britain, and a memorial to the  
people of British America were  
agreed to be drawn. Lee, Henry,  
and others were appointed for the  
first, and Lee, Livingston, and Jay  
for the two last. The splendor of  
their debet occasioned Mr. Henry to  
be designated by his committee to  
draw the petition to the King, with  
which they were charged, and Mr  
Lee was chargod with the address to  
the people of England. The last  
was first reported. On reading it  
every countenance full and a dead  
silence ensued for many minutes.  
At length it was laid on the table for  
perusal and consideration till the  
next day, when first one member and  
then another arose, and paying some  
faint compliments to the composition,  
obeerved that there were still certain  
considerations not expressed in it  
which should properly find a place  
in it. At length Mr. Livingston,  
(the Governor of N. J., a member  
of the committec, rose and observed  
that a friond of his had been sketch  
ing what he had thought might be  
proper for such an address, from  
which he thought some paragraphs  
might be advantagoously introduced  
into the draught proposed; and he  
read an address which Mr. Jay had  
propared de bene esse, as it were,  
There was but one sentiment of ad  
miration. The address was recom­  
mitted for amendment, and Mr. Jay&#x27;s  
draught reported and adopted with  
scarce any alteration. These facts  
were stated to me by Mr. Pendleton  
and Col. Harrison, of our own dele­  
gation, (except that Col. Harrison  
ascribed the draught to Gov. Liv­  
ingston,) and wore afterwards con­  
firmed to me by Gov. Livingston;  
and I will presently mention and  
aneedote coafirmative of them, from  
Mr. Jay and R. H. L., themselves.  
Mr. Henry&#x27;s draught of a petition  
to the King was equally unsuccess  
ful and was recomultted for amend­  
meat. Mr. John Dickinson was ad  
ded to the committee, and a new  
draught prepared by him was passed  
  
The occasion of my learning from  
Mr. Jay that he was the author of  
the address to the people of Great  
Britain requires explanation by a  
statement of some preceding circum  
stances. The 2d session of the 1st  
Congress met, on their own adjourn  
ment, in May, 1775. Peyton Ran  
dolph was their President. In the  
meantime Ld. North&#x27;s conciliatory  
prepositions came ever to be laid by  
the Governmont before their legisla  
tures. Ld. Dunmore accordingly  
called that of Virginia to meet in  
June. This obliged P. Randolph,  
as Speaker, to roturn. Our other  
old members being at Congress, he  
pressed me to draw the answer to Ld.  
North&#x27;s propesition. I accordingly  
did so, and it passed with a little  
sofftesing of some expressions for  
whish the times were not yet ripe,  
and wire draving aad weakening  
othess to satisfy individuals. I had  
beee appeiated to go on to Congress  
In plase of Peyton Randolph, and  
proscoded immediatsly charged with  
presenting this answor to Congress.  
As it wes the first which had beos  
glves, and the tone of it was strong,  
the members were plossed with it,  
heping it would have a good effest  
on the answese of the other States.  
A seqmite which had been ap  
peinted to prepare a declration to  
be pablicbed by Geal. Washington  
os his arrival at the army, having  
repertedd one, it was recommitted, and  
Dichiasa and myself added to the  
semmitess. On the acjournment of  
the Hoass, bepposing to go out with  
Ger. Liviagston, one of the com­  
mitsse, I esprossed to him my hepe  
he woald draw the deslaration. He  
modestly ezoused himself and eg,  
pressed his wish that I would do it.  
But, wgging him with considerable  
impartsulty, be at length said: &quot;yos  
and I, sls, are bat sow sequalatan­  
ess; chat san have exelted so ears­  
est a desire oo yoar part that I  
chould be the draughtomes?&quot; &quot;Why,  
sir,&quot; aald I, &quot;I have beee iaformed  
you drow the address to the people  
  
of Great Britain. I tink the first  
composition in the Enklish language  
and, therefore, am anglous this de­  
laration should be sropared by the  
pen.&quot; He replie &quot;that I might  
have been misinformed on that sub  
ject.&quot; A few days after, being in  
conversation with R. H. Lee in Con  
gress Hall, a little bfore the meet  
ing of the House, Mt Jay observing  
less, came up, and taking R. H. Lee  
by a button of the etot, said to Aim  
pratty sternly: &quot;I understand, sir,  
that you informed this gentleman  
that the address to the people of  
Great Britain, presented to the com  
mitte by me, was drawn by Gov. Liv  
ingstone.&quot; The fad was that the  
committee having consisted of sonly  
Lee, Livingston, who was father in  
law of Jay, and Jay himself, and  
Lee&#x27;s draught having been rejected,  
and Jay&#x27;s approved so unequivocally,  
his suspicions naturally fell on Lee  
as the author of the report, and the  
rather, as they daily had much spar  
ring in Congress, Lee being firm in  
the revolutionary measures, and Jay  
hanging heavily on their rear. I  
immediately stopped Mr. Jay, and  
assured him that, though I had in­  
deed been so informed, it was not by  
Mr. Lee, whom I had never heard  
atter a word on the subject.  
  
I found Mr. Heary to be a silent  
and almost unmeddling momber of  
Congress. On the original opening  
of that body, while general griev  
ances were the topic he was in hi­  
element, and captivate all by hi­  
bold and aplendid eloquence. But  
as soon as they came to speetfic mat  
ters, to sober reasoning and solid  
argumentation, he had the good sense  
to perceive that his declamation,  
however excellent in its proper place,  
had no weight at all in such an as­  
sembly as that of cool-headed, re  
flecting, judicious men. He ceased.  
therefore, in a great measure, to  
take any part in business. He  
seemed, indeed, very tired of the  
place and wonderfully relieved when,  
by appointment of the Virginia Con  
vention to be colonel of their first  
regiment, he was permitted to leave  
Congress about the last of July  
How he acquitted himself of his  
military command will be better  
known from others. He was reliev  
ed from this position again by being  
appointed Governor on the first or  
ganization of the Government. After  
my service as his successor in the  
same office, my appointment to Con  
gress in 1783, mission to Europe in  
84, and appointment in the new  
government in &#x27;89 kept us so far  
apart that I had no further personal  
knowledge of him  
  
Mr. Henry began his career with  
very little property. He acted, asI  
have understood, as barkeeper in the  
tavern at Hanover, C. H for some  
time. He married very young, set  
tled, I believe, at a place called  
Roundabout in Louisa, got credit for  
some little store of merchandize, but  
very soon failed. From this he turn  
ed his views to the law, for the acqui  
sition or practice of which, however  
he was toe lazy. Whenever the  
courts were closed for the winter ses  
sion he would make up a party of  
poor hunters of his neighborhood,  
would go off with them to the piny  
woods of Fluvanna and pass weeks in  
hunting deer, of which he was pas  
sionately fond, sleeping under a tent,  
before a fire, wearing the same shirt  
the whole time, and covering all the­  
dirt of his dress with a hunting shirt  
He never undertook to draw plead  
ings if he could avoid it, or to man  
age that part of a cause and very un  
willingly engaged but as an assistant  
to speak in the cause. And the fee  
was an indispensable preliminary  
observing to the applicant that he  
kept no account, never putting pen  
to paper, which was true. His pow  
ers over a jury were so irresistible  
that he received great fees for his ser  
vices, and had the reputation of being  
insatiable in money. After about  
ten years practice in the County  
Courts he came to the General Court  
where, however, being totally unqual  
ifed for anything but mere jury  
cases, he devoted himself to these  
and chiesly to the criminal business  
From these poor devils it was always  
understood that he squeezed exorbi  
tant fees of $50, C100, and $200  
From this source he made his great  
profits, and they were said to be great  
His other business, exclusive of the  
criminal, would never, I am sure, pay  
the expenses of his attendance. He­  
now purchased from Mr. Lomax the  
valu ble estate on the waters of  
Smith&#x27;s River, to which he afterwards  
removed. The purchase was on long  
credit and fnally paid in depreciated  
paper, sot worth oak leaves. About  
the close of the war he engaged in  
the Yasoo speculation, and bought  
up a grest deal of depreciated paper  
at 2s and d in the pound to pay for  
it. At the close of the war many of  
us wiahed to re open all accounts  
which had been paid in depreciated  
moncy, and have them settled by the  
seale of depreciation. But on this  
he frowsed most indignantly, and,  
knowing the general indisposition of  
the Legislature, it was considered  
hopeless to attempt it with such an  
opponent at their head as Henry. I  
bolieve he never distinguished him­  
self so much as on the similar ques  
tion of British debts in the case of  
Jones and Walker. He had exerted  
a degrep of interest in that case totally  
foreigs to his character, and not only  
seemed, but had made himself really,  
learned on the subject. Another of  
the great oscasions on which he ex  
hibited examples of eloquence such  
as probably had never been exceeded  
was os the question of adopting the  
Coastitation in 1788. To this  
he was most violently opposed, as is  
well keows; and after its adoption  
he continned hostile to it, expressing  
more than any other man in the  
S. his therough contempt and hatred  
of Gen. Washington. From being  
the most violent of all anti-Federal  
ists, however, he was brought over to  
the new Constitation by his Yasoo  
speculation, before mentioned. The  
Goorgia Legislature having declared  
that transaction fraudulent and void,  
tha deprociated paper which he had  
bought up to pay for the Yazoo pur  
shosd was linely to remain on his  
hands worth nothing. But Hamil-  
ton&#x27;s funding aystom cawe most op  
pertunely to his rolief and suddenly  
salced his papee from 28. 64, to T7s.  
$3, the poend. Hamilton became  
acth. is idel, and, abandoning the  
Repsblican adueates of the Cousti  
tutles, the Federal government on  
Fedeal princigles became his polit.  
deal eroed. Gc. Washiagten flatter  
ed him by an spointment to a mis  
  
sion to Spain, which he declined;  
and by proposing to him the office of  
Secretary of State, on the most ear­  
utst solicitation of General Henry  
Lee, who pledged himself that Heary  
should not accept it. For General  
Washington knew that he was en  
tirely unqualified for it, and more­  
over that his self-esteem had never  
suffered him to act as second to any  
man on earth. I had this fact from  
infermation, but that of the mission  
to Spain is of my own knowledge,  
because, after my retiring from the  
office of Secretary of State, General  
Washington passed the papers to Mr.  
Henry through my hands. Mr.  
Henry&#x27;s apostacy sunk him to nothing  
in the estimation of his country. He  
lost at once all that influence which  
Federalismn had hoped, by cajoling  
him, to transfer with long and active  
life had been the idol of his country  
beyond any one that ever lived, de  
seended to the grave with less than  
its indifference, and verifled the say  
ing of the philosopher, that no man  
must be called happy till he is dea

Henry in the following terms: &quot;Mr. Henry  
began his career with very little property.  
He acted, as I have understood, as barkeeper  
in the tavern of Hanover, C. H. for some  
time ; he married very young and settled, I  
believe, at a place called Roundabout, in Lou-  
isa, got credit for some little store of merchan-  
dise, but very soon failed. From this he turned  
his views to the law, for the acquisition or  
practice of which he was too lazy. Whenever  
the courts were closed for the winter season,  
he would make up a party of poor hunters of  
his neighborhood ; would go off with them to  
the piny woods of Fluyanna, and pass weeks  
in hunting deer, of which he was passionately  
fond : sleeping under a tent, before a fire,  
wearing the same shirt all the whole time, and  
covering all the dirt of his dress with a hunt-  
ing shirt. He never undertook to draw plead-  
ings if he could avoid it, or to manage that  
part of a cause, and very willingly engaged  
but as an assistant to speak in the case. And  
the fee was an indispensable preliminary, ob-  
serving to the applicant that he kept no ac-  
counts, never putting pen to paper, which was  
true. His powers ever a jury were so irre-  
sistible that he received great fees for his ser-  
vices, and had the reputation of being insatia-  
ble in money

Mr. Jefferson has endeavored to connect
