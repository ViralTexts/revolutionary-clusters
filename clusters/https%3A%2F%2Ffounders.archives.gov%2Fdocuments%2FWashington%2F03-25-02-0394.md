Morris-⟨t⟩own May 5th[–6 July] 1780  
  
Your Letters of the 26th of March, &amp; fourth of last Month came safe to hand.  
With respect to the Lotts I purchased at Mercer’s Sale, as I have no Deeds for them, nor in short know well upon what footing the matter stands, I do not incline to give any assurance of parting with the whole, or part of them at this time—What may happen hereafter I am unable to say—circumstances must govern.  
By a letter of the 5th of Decr last from Colo. Fairfax, I am informed that he had, in consequence of my earnest request to him to appt another Attorney, and the information he had recd that his Estate in Virginia was either confiscated or about to be so, sent a power to Robt Carter Nicholas Esqr. to take charge of his affairs and as I had also wrote to Mr Nicholas on this subject I will await his answer before I do any thing respecting Colo. Fairfax’s business. if his information, or apprehensions are well founded I should think it a cruel proceeding as the uniform tenor of his conduct has been friendly to the rights of this Country—his going to England the result of necessity and before hostilities either comme⟨n⟩ced or were thought of—and his return with his family in a manner impracticable.  
  
  
  
Bergen County, Jersey, 6th July 1780  
  
I had wrote thus far when some thing intervening, I was obliged to postpone my letter—a succession of business, of one kind and another, occasioned my laying it aside till I had altogether forgot I had begun a letter to you—and the constant moving state of the army since the 7th of last Month has kept me from my Papers, &amp; from the discovery of my havg begun a letter to you till now. thus much by way of apology—if the re⟨a⟩son is admissible.  
The Gazettes will have given you an Acct of the enemys movements o⟨n⟩ the 7th &amp; 23d of last Month from Elizabeth Town-point, &amp; of their having take⟨n⟩ Post there from the one date to the othe⟨r;⟩ there can be no occasion therefore to detail the acct in this place; but I may lament in the bitterness of my Soul, that the fatal policy which ha⟨s⟩ pervaded all our measures from the beginning of the War, &amp; from which ⟨no⟩ experience however dear bought can change, should have reduced our ar⟨my⟩ to so low an ebb as not to have given a more effectual opposition to those movements than we did; or that we should be obliged to be removing our Stores from place to place to keep them out of the way of the enemy instead of driving that enemy from our Country—but our weakness envited these insults, &amp; why they did not attempt at least to do more than they did, I cannot conceive—Nor will it be easy to make  
  
any one at the distance of 400 Miles believe that our Army, weakened as it is by the expiration of Men’s enlistments, should at times be five or Six days together without Meat—then as many without bread—and once or twice, two or three days together without either. And that, in the same Army, there should be numbers of Men with scarcely as much cloathing as would cover their nakedness and at least a fourth of the whole with not even the shadow of a blanket severe as the Winter has been—Under these circumstances it is no difficult matter to conceive what a time I must have had to keep up appearances &amp; prevent the most disastrous consequences.  
It may be asked, how these things have come to pass? the answer is plain—&amp; may be ascribed to want of system, not to say foresight—originally (if it is not still the case with some) a fatal Jealousy (under our circumsta⟨n⟩ces) of a standing Army—by which means we neglected to obtain Soldiers for the War when zeal &amp; patriotism run high, &amp; men were eager to engage for a trifle, or for nothing; the consequence of which has been, that we have protracted the War—expended millions, &amp; tens of Millions of pounds which might have been saved, &amp; have a new Army to raise &amp; discipline once or twice a year &amp; with which we can undertake nothing because we have nothing to build upon, as the men are slipping from us every day by means of their expiring enlistments. To these, fundamental errors, may be added another which I expect will prove our ruin, &amp; that is the relinquis⟨h⟩ment of Congressional powers to the States individually—all the business is now attempted, for it is not done⟨,⟩ by a timid kind of recommendation from Congress to the States; the consequence of which is, that instead of pursuing one uniform system which in the execution shall corrispond in time &amp; manner, each State undertakes to determine—1st—whether they will comply or not 2d In what manner they will do it—&amp; 3dly in what time—by which means scarcely any one measure is, or can be executed, while great expences are incurred &amp; the willing &amp; zealous state⟨s⟩ ruined—in a word, our measures are not under the influence and direction of one council, but thirteen, each of which is actuated by local views and politics, without considering the fatal consequences of not complying with plans which the united wisdom of America in its representative capacity have digested, or the unhappy tendency of delay, mutilation, or alteration. I do not scruple to add, &amp; I give it decisively as my opinion, that unless the States will content themselves with a full, &amp; well chosen representation in Congress, &amp; vest that body with absolute powers in all matters relative to the great purposes of War, and of general concern (by which the States unitedly are affected, reserving to themselves all matters of local &amp; internal polity for the regulation of order &amp; good government) we are attempting an impossibility, &amp; very soon shall become (if it is not  
  
already the case) a many headed monster—a heterogenious mass—that never will, or can, steer to the same point—The contest among the different States now, is not which shall do most for the common cause, but which shall do least—hence arise disappointments &amp; delay; one State waiting to see what another will or will not do through fear of doing too much &amp; by their deliberations, alterations, &amp; sometimes refusals to comply with the requisitions of Congress, after that Congress have spent months in reconciling (as far as it is possible) jarring Interests in order to frame their resolutions as far as the nature of the case will admit, upon principles of equality.  
There is another source from whence much of our present distress, &amp; past difficulties have flowed; And that is the hope &amp; expectation which siezes the States, &amp; Congress towards the close of every year, that Peace must take place in the Winter—this never fails to produce an apathy which lulls them into ease and security, &amp; involves the most distressing consequences at the opening of every Campaign. We may rely upon it, that we shall never have Peace till the enemy are convinced that we are in a condition to carry on the War. It is no new maxim in politics—that for a nation to obtain Peace, or insure it—It must be prepared for War.  
But it is time for me to recollect myself, &amp; quit a subject which would require a folio volume to ellucidate, &amp; expose the folly of our measures—To rectify past blunders is impossible, but we might profit by the experience of them tho’ even here I doubt, as I am furnished with man⟨y⟩ instances to the contrary.  
After the enemy had manœuvered in the Jerseys—not much I think to their advantage or credit—they, as you may have seen by the accts published, suddenly left the State and by thei⟨r⟩ movements seemed to threaten our Post⟨s⟩ on the North river—this, as we were apprehensive of them before, induced us to make such advances that way as gave us a moral certainty of covering &amp; securing them—whether the enemy’s plans were changed hereby—or whether their only views were to occupy certain grounds which they conceived would hereafter be of use to us in order to drain it of its forage I shall not undertake to say, but the fact is that after being on board their Vessels two ⟨o⟩r three days in the No. River they disembarked about four Miles above Kingsbridge &amp; Incamped across from thence over to the East River or Sound where they have lain ever since foraging—finding this to be the case, &amp; knowing it was not in my power to dislodge them, I came to this place to refresh my Troops—wait the expected reinforcements by Drafts—&amp; the arrival of the french fleet—thus the matter stands at presents—wh⟨at⟩ events may cast up hereafter the womb of time must discover.  
Letters of this length will be the best apology I can make for the infrequency of them, for were they not rare, they would be insufferable—My  
  
best Affections attend my Sister and the Family—with sentiments of the most perfect regard I am most sincerely Yrs  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
P.S. You will be so good as to let the Inclosed Letters be properly forwarded.

ranks by short enlistments; and then says,  
  
‘To these fundamental errors may be added another, which I  
expect will prove our ruin, and that is, the relinquishment of  
congressional powers to the states individually. All the business  
is now attempted, for it is not done, by a timid kind of recommen-  
dation from Congress to the states ; the consequence of which is,  
that instead of pursuing one uniform system, which in the execu-  
tion shall correspond in time and manner, each state undertakes  
to determine, first, whether it will comply or not ; secondly, in  
what manner it will do it; and, thirdly, in what time; by which  
means scarcely any one measure is, or can be executed, while  
great expenses are incurred, and the willing and zealous states  
ruined. Ina word, our measures are not under the influence  
and direction of one ‘council, but thirteen, each of which is actu-  
ated by local views and politics, without considering the fatal  
consequences of not complying with plans, which the united wis-  
dom of America in its representative capacity has digested, or the  
unhappy tendency of delay, mutilation, or alteration.  
  
I do not scruple to add, and I give it decisively as my opin-  
ion, that unless the states will content themselves with a full and  
well chosen representation in Congress, and vest that body with  
absolute powers in all matters relative to the great purposes of war  
and of general concern (by which the states unitedly are affect-  
ed, reserving to themselves all matters of local and internal polity  
for the regulation of order and good government), we are attempt-  
ing an impossibility, and very soon shall become, if it is not al-  
ready the case, a many headed monster, a heterogeneous mass,  
that never will or can steer to the same point. The contest  
among the different states now is not, which shall do most for the  
common cause, but which shal] do least ; hence arise disappoint-  
ments and delay ; one state waiting to see what another will or  
will not do, through fear of doing too much, and by their delibera-  
tions, alterations, and sometimes refusals to comply with Con-  
gress, after that Congress have spent months in reconciling jar-  
ring interests in order to frame their resolutions, as far as the  
nature of the case will admit, upon principles of equality.’

of  
  
the discovery of my having begun a letter to you tillnow. ‘Lhus  
much by way of apology, ithe fosose is admissible.  
  
Yhe will have given you an account of the enemy’s  
movements on the 7th and of dast month, from Elizabeth Town  
Point, and of their having taken post there from the one date to the  
other: bee be no occasion therefore to detail the account in  
this place. t I lament inthe bitterness of my soul, that the fatal.  
policy which has pervaded all our measures from the beginning of  
the war, and from which no tience however dear boug::t can  
change, should have reduced our army to so low an ebb as not to  
have given a moreeffectual opposition to thosc movements than we  
did, or that wa should be obliged to be removing our stores fiom  
place to place to keep them out of the way of the enemy, instead  
of driving that enemy fromourcountry. But our weakness invited  
these insults, and why they did not attempt, at least, to do more than  
they did, I cannot conceive. Nor will it be easy to make any one at  
the distance of 400 miles believe that our army, weakened as it is by  
the expiration of men’s enlistments, should at times be five or six  
days together without meat—then as many without bread—and once  
or twice two or three days together without either; and that in the  
same army there should be numbers of men with scarcely as much  
clothing as would cover their nakedness, and at least a fourth of  
the whole with not even the shadow of a blanket, severe as the &#x27;  
winter has been. Under these circumstances, it is no difficult mat- |  
ter to perceive what a time I must havé had to keep up appearan- |  
ces, and prevent the most disastrous consequences.  
  
It may be asked, how these thiags have come tofpass? The an-  
swer is plain, and may be ascribed to want of system—not to say  
of foresight—originally, (if it 18 not still the case with some,) to a &#x27;  
fatal jealousy, (under our circumstances) of a standing ariny—by —  
which means we neglected to obtain soldiers for the war when zeal |  
and patriotism run high, and men were eager to engage for a trifle,  
er for nothing ; the consequence of which has been, that we have  
protracted the war, expended millions and tens of million Zf 4  
pounds which might have been saved, and have a new army to ra  
and discipline once or twice a year; and with which we can under-  
take nothing, as we have nothing to build upon, as the men are slip-  
ping from-us every day by means of their expiring enlistments. To  
| these fundameatal errors, may be added another, which I expect  
  
will prove our ruin, and that is the rel.iniquishment of Congressional  
powers tothe states individually. . Allthe business is naw alfempt-

h!a answer before I do any thing respecting Col.  
Fairfax’s business. If his information, or appre­  
hensions, uro well founded, I should think it a cruel  
proceeding, as the uniform tenor of kis conduct  
has been friendly to the rights of his country—his  
going to England, the result of necessity, and before  
hotililiofl cither comntcncod, or wore thought of__  
andlhis roturu with his family, in a manner im­  
prectioahlo.  
IlKiioKN Con-CTT, Jeroct, July Gth, T7S0.  
I haJ wrote time fir when something interven­  
ing, I was obliged to postpone my letter—a succce.  
•ion of business, of ono kind and another, oc­  
casioned iny laying it aside till I had altoge.  
ther forgot I had begun a letter to you—and the  
constant moving state of tho army siuee the 7th &lt;&gt;f  
last month, batikept ine from my papere, and from  
tho discovery of ray having begun a letter to you  
till now—thus much by way of apology_if the rea­  
son is admissible.  
. - f»axettes will have given you an account of  
tae enemy&#x27;s movements on the 7th *n&lt;] 23d of last  
month from Elizabeth Town Point, and of their  
having taken post there from tho one date to tho  
oilier; there can ho no occasion, therefore, to de­  
t ii! tho ac a Hint in this place; but may lament in  
the bitterness of my soul, that tlw policy which  
has.pervaded aii our measures from tho beginning  
oi the war, and trorn which no experience, howev­  
er doar bought, car) change, should have reduced  
our army to so low an ebb, as not to have given a  
mor« effectual opposition to these movements than  
we diu, or that wo should be obliged to be remov­  
ing our storer from place to place, to keep them out  
ol the way of the enemy, instead ofdriving thatenc­  
m_&gt; from our country.Butour weakness invited these  
insults, and why they did not attempt af least to do  
more than they did, I cannot conceivo. Now,  
will it he easy to make any ono at the distance of  
400 miles, holicvo that our army, weakened as it ie  
by the expiration of men’s enlistments, should at  
times be five or six day* together without moat—  
tlier. as many without bread—and once or twice,  
tyro or three days together without either; and that  
i.t i lie same army-, there should be numbers of men  
with tcarcoly as much clothing as would cover  
their nakedness, and at least, a fourth of tho whole  
with not ovan the shado-v of a blanket, severe as  
tho winter has boon. Under these circumstances,  
it is no difficult matter toconcoivo what a time I  
rnnst have had to keep up. appearances, and pre­  
vent the most disastrous consequences.  
It may be asked, how these things have come to  
pass? the answer is plain—and may bo ascribed to  
want of system, not to say foresight—originally (if  
it is not still the case with some,) to a fatal jeal­  
ousy (under our circumstances.) ot a standing ar­  
my—by which moans we neglected to obtain sol-1  
diers for tho war when zeal and patriotism run high,  
and mer* W&#x27;-ro eager to engage for a trifle, or for no­  
thing; the consequence of which ha* been, that we  
| h ive protracted lire war—expended millions,  
and tens of millions of pounds which might have  
been saved, and have a new army to raise and dis­  
cipline once or twice a year; and with which we  
can undertake nothing because ire have nothi . j to  
i build upon, as the men arc slipping from us every  
i day by means of their expiring enlistments. To*  
j these fundamental errors, may bo added another,  
j which I expect will prove our ruin, and that is the  
! rclinqu shment of Congressional powors to the  
j hiutop individually; all the buBinnss is now aiternp­  
j !e&#x27;l—IO,‘ it is not done, by a timid kind of reccm­  
  
to uic otdip^, mv con­  
sequence c-f which is, that instead erf pursuing one  
uniform system, which in the execution shall cor.  
respond in time and manner, each Stato under,  
takes to determine—1st, whether they comply or  
not; 2d, in what manner they will do it; and, 3dly,  
in what time—!&gt;y which means -scarcely any one  
measure is or can be executed, while greatexpen­  
snsa.-e incurred, and the willing tnd zealous States  
ruined. Iiv*a word, our measurer are not under the  
i.ifluenco anil direction ot one council, but thir­  
teen, each of which is actuated ly local views and  
podiics, without considering tl&gt;e fatal consequen­  
ces of nut complying with plan* whieh the united  
wisdom of America, in its representative capacity  
nave digested, or the unhappy tendency ef delay,  
mutilation or alteration. I do not scruple to add,  
andj givs it ^decisively as ray opinion, that unless  
t.ic .itC-tCE wilt content themselves with a full and  
wc.l chosen representation in Congress, and vest  
t:iat body with absolute powers in all matters rela­  
tive to the groat purposes of w»rt and of general  
concert (by which the States unitedly are affected,  
reserving t* themselves all matters of local or in­  
lornal twil.n.. r_it. i .

penciling *(ae far as it is possible) jarring interests,  
in order to frame thnir resolutions, as fur ns the  
nature of t!i» case will admit upo* principles of  
equality.  
There is another source from whence much of  
our present distress and pajt difficulties have flow,  
ed, and that i* the hope nr.d expectation which  
seizes the States and Congress, towards the close of  
every year, that peace musttake place in the winter

The Gazettes x*ill leave given you an ac  
coiinf of the enemy’s movements on the 7th  
and fiJd of last month from Elizabeth Town  
Point, and of their having taken post there  
frpia tli« one dale to the other; there can be  
no occasion therefore to detail the account  
in this place; hut 1 may lament in the bitter  
nes* of my soul, that the fatal policy which  
  
has pervaded all our mrasuirs Iroin t!i« l«*  
ginning of the war, ami from which no expo  
nenee however dear bought can change,  
should have reduced #ur army to so low an

opposition to these movements than we did,  
or that we should be obliged to he remo­  
ving our stores from place to place to ktep  
them oet of tbo way ol the enemy, instead  
of driving that enemy from our country.—  
B it our weakness muled tin so insults, and  
why did not ulUm/it ol It&#x27;Utt to do mere than  
they did, 1 cannot conceive Nor will it be  
easy to make any one at the distance of 400  
utiles, believe that ouraimy, weakened as a  
is by th» expiration of men’s enlistments,  
-huuld sometimes lie five or six days together  
without meat—then as many without bn ad—  
and once or twice, two or th.ee days togethei  
without either;—and that in the same army,  
there should he numbers ol mea with scarce  
ly as much clothing as would cover their na  
kedness, and at least a fourth of the whole

vere as the wintor has been Under these .  
circumstances, it is no difficult matter to con- .  
ccive wliat a time I must hare had to keep i

Morristown May sth 1780  
Dear Sir  
  
Your Letters of the 26th of March &amp;  
fourth of last month came safe to hand—  
  
With respect to the Lotts I purchased  
at Mercer&#x27;s sale, as I have no Deeds for  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
them, nor in short know not upon what  
footing the matter stands, I do not in-  
cline to give any assurance of parting  
with the whole, or part of them at this  
time— What may happen hereafter I  
am unable to say—circumstances must  
govern—  
  
By a letter of the sth of Decr last  
from Colo Fairfax, I am informed that  
he had in consequence of my earnest  
request to him to appt another attorney,  
and the information he had recd that  
his Estate in Virginia was either confis-  
cated or about to be so, sent a power to  
Robt Carter Nicholas Esqr to take  
charge of his affairs and as I had also  
wrote to Mr Nicholas on this subject I  
will await his answer before I do any-  
thing respecting Colo Fairfax’s busi-  
ness.—if his information or apprehen-  
sions are well founded I should think it  
a cruel proceeding as the uniform tenor  
of his conduct has been friendly to the  
rights of this Country—his going to  
England the result of necessity and be-  
fore hostilities either commenced or  
were thought of, and his return with his  
family in a manner impracticable  
  
Bergen County Jersey 6th July 1780  
  
I had wrote thus far when some thing  
intervening, I was obliged to postpone  
my letter— a succession of business, of  
one kind and another occasioned my  
laying it aside ’till I had altogether for-  
got I had begun a letter to you—and  
the constant moving state of the army  
since the 7th of last month has kept me  
from my Papers, &amp; from the discovery  
of my havg begun a letter to you till  
now.— Thus much by way of apology—  
if the reason is admissible.

#### 1879-08-01 &middot; [New York City, New York](http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City)

ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
acct of the enemy’s movements on the  
7th &amp; 23d of last month from Elizabeth-  
town-point, &amp; of their having taken  
Post there from the one date to the  
other; there can be no occasion there-  
fore to detail the acct in this place ; but  
I may lament in the bitterness of my  
soul, that the fatal policy which has per-  
vaded all our measures from the begin-  
ing of the war, &amp; which no experience  
however dear bought can change, should  
have reduced our army to so low an  
ebb, as not to have given a more effect-  
ual opposition to those movements than  
we did; or that we should be obliged  
to be removing our stores from place to  
place to keep them out of the way of  
the enemy instead of driving that enemy  
from our Country—but our weakness  
invited these insults, &amp; why they did  
  
not attempt at least to do more than  
  
they did, I cannot conceive. Nor will  
it be easy to make any one at the dis-  
tance of 400 miles believe that our army,  
weakened as it is by the expiration of  
Men’s enlistments, should at times be  
five or six days together without meat—  
then as many without bread—and once  
or twice, two or three days together  
without either—and that, in the same  
army, there should be numbers of men  
with scarcely as much cloathing as  
would cover their nakedness and at least  
a fourth of the whole with not even the  
shadow of a blanket severe as the winter  
has been.— Under these circumstances  
it is no difficult matter to conceive what  
atime I must have had to keep up appear-  
ances &amp; prevent the most disastrous  
consequences,—  
  
It may be asked how these things  
have come to pass? the answer is plain  
  
497  
  
—&amp; may be ascribed to the want of sys-  
tem, not to say foresight—originally (if  
it is not still the case with some) to a  
fatal jealousy (under our circumstances)  
of a standing army—by which means  
we neglected to obtain Soldiers for  
the war when zeal &amp; patriotism run  
high, &amp; men were eager to engage for a  
trifle or for nothing ; the consequence  
of which has been that we have pro-  
tracted the war—expended millions &amp;  
tens of millions of pounds which might  
have been saved, &amp; have a new army to  
raise &amp; discipline once or twice a year  
&amp; with which we can undertake nothing  
because we have nothing to build upon,  
as the men are slipping from us every  
day by means of their expiring enlist-  
ments— To these fundamental errors,  
may be added another which I expect  
will prove our ruin, &amp; that is the relin-  
quishment of Congressional powers, to  
the states individually—all the business  
is now attempted, for it is not done, by a  
timid kind of recommendation from  
Congress to the States ; the consequence  
of which is, that instead of pursuing one  
uniform system which in the execution  
shall corrispond in time &amp; manner, each  
state undertakes to determine—  
  
1st Whether they will comply or not  
  
2nd In what manner they will do  
it &amp;  
  
3d in what time—by which means  
scarcely any one measure is, or can be  
executed, while great expences are in-  
curred &amp; the willing &amp; zealous states  
ruined. In a word our measures are  
not under the influence and direction of  
one Council, but thirteen, each of which  
is actuated by local views and politics,  
without considering the fatal conse-  
  
  
  
498  
  
quences of not complying with plans  
which the united wisdom of America in  
its representative capacity have digested,  
or the unhappy tendency of delay, mu-  
tilation or alteration— I do not scruple  
to add &amp; I give it decisively as my  
opinion—that unless the states will con-  
tent themselves with a full &amp; well chosen  
representation in Congress &amp; vest that  
body with absolute powers in all matters  
relative to the great purposes of War,  
and of general concern (by which the  
States unitedly are affected, reserving to  
themselves all matters of local &amp; inter-  
nal polity for the regulation of order &amp;  
good government) we are attempting an  
impossibility, &amp; very soon shall become  
(if it is not already the case) a many  
headed monster—a heterogenious mass  
—that never will or can steer to the  
same point— The contest among the  
different states now is not which shall do  
most for the common cause—but which  
shall do least, hence arise disappoint-  
ments &amp; delay, one state waiting to see  
what another will or will not do through  
fear,—of doing too much &amp; by their  
deliberations, alterations, &amp; sometimes  
refusals to comply with the requisitions  
of Congress, after that Congress spent  
months in reconciling (as far as it is  
possible) jarring interests in order to  
frame their resolutions as far as the  
nature of the case will admit, upon  
principles of equality—  
  
There is another source from whence  
much of our present distress, &amp; past  
difficulties have flowed; and that is the  
hope &amp; expectation which seizes the  
States, &amp; Congress toward the close of  
every year, that Peace must take place  
in the winter— This never fails to pro-  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
duce an apathy which lulls them into  
ease and security, &amp; involves the most  
distressing consequences at the opening  
of every Campaign. We may rely  
upon it, that we shall never have Peace  
till the enemy are convinced that we are  
in a condition to carry on the war.— It  
is nO new maxim in politics that for a  
nation to obtain Peace, or insure it, It  
must be prepared for war.—  
  
But it is time for me to recollect:  
myself, &amp; quit a subject which would  
require a folio volume to illucidate, &amp;  
expose the folly of our measures— To  
rectify past blunders is impossible, but  
we might profit by the experience of  
them, tho’ even here I doubt, as I am  
furnished with many instances to the  
contrary.  
  
After the enemy had manceuvered in  
the Jerseys—not much I think to their  
advantage or credit, they as you may  
have seen by the acct published, sud-  
denly left the State and by their move-  
ments, seemed to threaten our Posts on  
the North river— this, as we were ap-  
prehensive of them before, induced us  
to make such advances that way as gave  
us a moral certainty of covering and  
securing them— whether the enemy’s  
plans were changed hereby, or whether  
their only views were to occupy certain  
grounds which they conceived would  
hereafter be of use to us, in order to  
drain it of its forage, I shall not undertake  
to say, but the fact is that after being  
on board their Vessels two or three  
days in the No River they disembarked  
about four miles above Kingsbridge &amp;  
Incamped across from thence over to  
the East river or Sound where they  
have lain ever since foraging. finding
