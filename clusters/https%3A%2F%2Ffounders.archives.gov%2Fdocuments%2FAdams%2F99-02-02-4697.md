				The House of Representatives have received with great respect the communication which you have been pleased to make to the two Houses of Congress at the commencement of the present session.  
  
The final establishment of the seat of National Government, which has now taken place, within the District of Columbia is an event of no small importance in the political transactions of our country, and we cordially unite our wishes with yours that this Territory may be the residence of happiness and virtue.  
  
Nor can we on this occasion omit to express a hope that the spirit which animated the great founder of this city may descend to future generations, and that the wisdom, magnanimity, and steadiness which marked the events of his public life may be imitated in all succeeding ages.  
  
A consideration of those powers which have been vested in Congress over the District of Columbia will not escape our attention, nor shall we forget that in exercising these powers a regard must be had to those events which will necessarily attend the capital of America.  
  
The cheerfulness and regularity with which the officers and soldiers of the temporary army have returned to the condition of private citizens is a testimony clear and conclusive of the purity of those motives which induced them to engage in the public service, and will remain a proof on all future occasions that an army of soldiers drawn from the citizens of our country deserve our confidence and respect.  
  
No subject can be more important than that of the judiciary, which you have again recommended to our consideration, and it shall receive our early and deliberate attention.  
  
The Constitution of the United States having confided the management of our foreign negotiations to the control of the Executive power, we cheerfully submit to its decisions on this important subject; and in respect to the negotiations now pending with France, we sincerely hope that the final result may prove as fortunate to our country as the most ardent mind can wish.  
  
So long as a predatory war is carried on against our commerce we should sacrifice the interests and disappoint the expectations of our constituents should we for a moment relax that system of maritime defense which has resulted in such beneficial effects. At this period it is confidently believed that few persons can be found within the United States who do not admit that a navy, well organized, must constitute the natural and efficient defense of this country against all foreign hostility.  
  
The progress which has been made in the manufacture of arms leaves no doubt that the public patronage has already placed this country beyond all necessary dependence on foreign markets for an article so indispensable for defense, and gives us assurances that, under the encouragement which Government will continue to extend to this important object, we shall soon rival foreign countries not only in the number but in the quality of arms completed from our own manufactories.  
  
Few events could have been more pleasing to our constituents than that great and rapid increase of revenue which has arisen from permanent taxes. Whilst this event explains the great and increasing resources of our country, it carries along with it a proof which can not be resisted that those measures of maritime defense which were calculated to meet our enemy upon the ocean, and which have produced such extensive protection to our commerce, were founded in wisdom and policy. The mind must, in our opinion, be insensible to the plainest truths which can not discern the elevated ground on which this policy has placed our country. That national spirit which alone could vindicate our common rights has been roused, and those latent energies which had not been fully known were unfolded and brought into view, and our fellow-citizens were prepared to meet every event which national honor or national security could render necessary. Nor have its effects been much less important in other respects.  
  
Whilst many of the nations of the earth have been impoverished and depopulated by internal commotions and national contests, our internal peace has not been materially impaired; our commerce has extended, under the protection of our infant Navy, to every part of the globe; wealth has flowed without intermission into our seaports, and the labors of the husbandman have been rewarded by a ready market for the productions of the soil.  
Be assured, sir, that the various and important subjects recommended to our consideration shall receive our early and deliberate attention; and, confident of your cooperation in every measure which may be calculated to promote the general interest, we shall endeavor on our part to testify by our industry and dispatch the zeal and sincerity with which we regard the public goo

Sib,  
The House of R.eprefentatives have re­  
ceived, with great refpe£l, the communica­  
tion which you have been pleased to make to  
the two houles of Congress, kt the com­  
mencement of the prelent feflion.  
The final eftafelUhmeHt of the feat ef na­

cal tranfa&amp;ions of our country ; Sc we r ndi­  
ally unite our wiflies with yours, that this

Nor can we, en this occafios, omit to  
express a hope, that the spirit which anima­  
ted the great founder of this city&#x27;, may def-  
Cend to future generations, and that the  
wil&#x27;dom, magnanimity and Headings, which  
which marked ks events of his public life,  
may be intitatfed in a!i fuccteding ages.  
A consideration of those po.vei , which  
have been veiled in congress over the dii­  
triA of Columbia, will not eicape our at­  
tention, noj&#x27;lhall we forget, that in exer­  
cising these powers, a regard must be had to  
thole events, which will necessarily attend  
the capital of America.  
The cheerfulnefs and regularity, with  
which the officers and soldiers of the tempo­  
rary a-my, have returned to the conditions  
of private citizens, is a testimony, clear and  
conclulive, of the purity of those tViotives.  
which induced thena to engage in .the public

oecalions; that an army of soldiers, drawn  
from the citizens of our country, deserves  
our confidence and fefpeft.  
No fubjeft can be more important, than  
that of the Judiciary, which you have again  
recommended to our consideration, and it  
fhsll receive our early and deliberate atten­  
tion.  
  
The Conftltution of the United States  
having confid.d the man gemant of our  
foreign negociations to the controul of  
the executive power, we chearfully sub­  
mit to its decilions on this important

of our country, it carries along with it a  
proof which cannot be refitted, that those  
measures of maritime defence, wh.cli were  
calculated to meet our enemy upon the

fmnJed in wifdoin and policy. Ihe mind

TH House of Representatives have re-  
ceived with great respect the coinmunica-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
3  
  
which you have been pleased to make to the  
two Houses of Cougress, .t the commenrce-  
ment of the present session.  
  
The fisal establishment of the seat of na-  
tional government, which has now taken  
piace, withia the District of Columbia, is  
an event of no sniall importance in the po-  
liticai transactions of our couuatry; and we  
cordially unite our v isues with yours, that  
this territory may be the res.dence of happi-  
wess and Virtue.  
  
Nor can we, on th’s occasion, omit to ex-  
press a hope, that ihespirit which animated  
te great touuuder of tlis Cit,, may dcscend  
to future Zeucratious, aud ivat the wisdom,  
magnanin.ty aud sieadioess, \ hich marked  
the evenis of iu- puiici fe, way be imitaied  
Ath aii SUCCCECINS ages.  
  
A cous.ceraiiva of those powers Which  
have been vested in Congress over the dis-  
ivict of Coluusbia, will not escape or at-  
teatiou, nor snail we forget, thet in exer-  
C.Siig Cacse powers, a regard must be had  
to these eveuts, which wiil uecessarily at-  
tei Lode capital of America.

which the vilicers and su.dfers o. the tempo-  
ary ariily havereturned tothe conditions of  
private citizens, Is a testimoay ciear and  
couvinsive, uf the purity of those motives,  
wWiich induced them to engage in the pub-  
lic service, and will remain a proof on all  
future occasions, that an army of soldiers,  
Grawh irom the citizens of our country, de-  
serve our confidetice and respect.  
  
No subject can be more important than  
that of tue Judiciary, which you have again  
recuinmienved to our consideration, and it  
shall receive our early and deliberate at-  
téeuliou.  
  
The Constitution of the United States  
having confided the managemeiit of our fo-  
reign negociations to the coniroll of the  
Executive power, we cheeriul.y submit to  
its decisions on this important subject. And  
in respect to the negociations now pending  
with rrauce, we sincerely hope that the fi  
nal result may prove as fortunate to our  
country asthe most ardent mind can wish,  
  
Sv ioig asa predatory war is carried on  
against our commerce, we should sacri«  
fice the interests, and disappoint the ex pec-  
tatious of our constituents, should we, for  
a moment relax that system of maritime  
defence, which has resulted in such benefi-  
cial effects. At this period it is centident-  
ly be.ieved. that few persons can be found  
within the United States, whodo not admit  
thata navy, well organized, must consti-  
tute the natural and efficient defence of this  
couatry. against ali toreign hostility.  
  
ihe progress which has been made in the  
manufacture of aris, leaves nu doubt, that  
the pulic patronage has already placed this  
country beyond a:l necessary dependence  
on joreign markets, for an article so indis-  
peusible for defence ; and give us assurane  
ces, thatunder the encouragement which  
government w ill continue to « xtg Na to this  
inparcesat eoject, we soon shal! rival foreign  
countries, pot only in the number bur in the  
qua ity of arms, completed trom our own  
mainufactories.  
  
_ Few events could have been more pleas-  
ing to our Conmstitue &#x27;ts, thau that gre t and  
rapid iscrease of revenue, wh ca has orisen  
from permenent taxes, . Whilvt this event  
  
  
  
  
  
explains the great and increasing resources  
of our country, it carries along with it a  
preof which cannot be resisted, that those  
measures of maritime defence, which were  
calcuiated to meet our enemy upon the  
ocean, and which have produced such ex-  
tensive protection to our commerce. were  
founded in wisdom and policy. The mind  
must, in our opinion, be insensible to the  
plainest truths, which cannot discern the e-  
Jevated groundon whichth policy has pla-  
ced our country. That ational spirit,  
which alone could vindicate our common  
rights, has been roused, and those jatent  
energies, which hid not been fully known,  
were unfolded and bronght into view, and  
our fellow citizens were prepared to meet  
every event which national honour or na-  
tional security could render necessary.  
  
Nor have its effects been much less impor-  
tant in other respects; whilst many of the  
nations of the earth have been i: poverished,  
and depopulated by internal commotions  
and national contests, our internal peace has  
not been materially imp.uired—our commerce  
has extended, under the protection of our

Wealth has flowed wit!:out intermission into  
our sea-poris, and the labours of the hus-  
bandinan, have been rewarded by a ready  
market for the production of the soil  
  
Be assured, Sir, that the various and im-  
portant subjects, recommended to our consi-  
deration, shall receive ourearly and delibe-  
rate attention, and confident of your co-ope-  
ration, in every measure which may becal-

that great and rapicrincreale of re-i  
venue, which has anleii from per­  
manent taxes. Whilfl this event  
expjains the great and increasing  
resources of our country, it carries  
along with it a proof which cannot  
be refilled, that thofe meafuiesof!  
maritime defence, which were cal-!  
culated to meet our enemy upon  
the ocean, and which have pro­  
duced fuch extenfive prote&amp;ion to  
our commerce, were founded in  
wifdom and policy.. The mind  
mull, in our opinion, be infenfible  
to the plainefl truths, which can­  
not difcern the elevated ground on  
which this policy has placed our  
country. That national fpirit,  
which alone could vindicate our  
common rights, has been roufed,  
and thofe , latent energies, which  
had&#x27; not been fully known, weie  
unfolded and brought into -view,  
and our fellow citizens vvere pre­  
pared to meet every event, which  
national honour or national fecu­  
rity could render neceflary. Nor  
have its effects Jbeen much lefs im­  
portant in other refpecls. Wnih&#x27;l  
many of the nations of the earth,  
have been impoverifhed and depo­  
pulated, by internal commotions,  
and national conteffs, our j internal  
peace has not been materially im­  
paired our commerce has extend­  
ed, under the protection of our in­  
fant navy, to every part of the  
globe wealth has flowed without  
intermiflion into our feaports, and!  
the labours of the hufbandman have  
been rewarded by a ready market  
for the productions of the Foil.  
.Be allured, Sir, that the various  
and important fubje&amp;s recommend­

ceive our early and deliberate at­  
tention, and confident of your co­

The House of Representatives have re—  
ceived with great respect, the communica­  
tion which you have been pleased to, make  
to the two Houses of Congrcss, at the com­  
mencement of the present sesiion.  
The final establishment of the seat osna.  
tional government, which has now taken  
place, within the District of Columbia, is­  
an evcnt of no small importance in the po­  
litical transactions osour country; and we  
cordially unite our wishes with yours, that  
this territory may be the residence of hap­  
piness and virtue.  
Nor can we, on this occasion, omit to  
express a hope, that the spirit which ani­  
mated the great founder of this city, may  
descend to future generations, and that  
the wisdom, magnanimity and steadiness  
which marked the events of his public  
life, may be imitated in all succeeding  
ages. . - -.

havcbeen vested in COngresei over the Bis­

ercising these powers, a regard must be  
had to those events which will necessarily  
attend the&#x27;capital of America. &#x27;  
The cheertsiulness and regularity with  
which the officers and sol&#x27;diers of the tem­  
porary army have returnedssto the conditi­  
on of private citizens is a&quot; testimony, clear  
; and conclusive of the purity of those mo­  
_ tives which induced them to engage in  
the public service ; and will&#x27; remain ;}  
proof, on all future occasions, that swarm}:  
of soldiers drawn from- the citizens of our  
country, deserve our confidence and respect;  
No subject can bectmore important than  
that of the judiciary, which you &quot;have a­  
gain recommended to our confideration,  
axidsshssfi;.si-=&#x27;-35:,eceive our early and delibera te  
attention.  
The conﬂitution of the United States  
having confided the management of our  
foreign negociations, to the control ostlch  
execurive-power, we cheerfully submit to  
its decisionssion this important subject.——  
And in respect to t e negociations now;  
pending with France, we sincerely hope  
that the final result may prove as fortu­  
  
nate to our country, as the molt ardentsisi  
mind can wish.  
  
  
So long as &amp; predatory war is carried  
on against our commerce, we should sacri­  
fice the interests, and disappoint the ex­  
pectations of our conlthuents, should we  
for a moment, relax that system of mar-i., .  
time defence, which has resulted in such  
beneficial eﬀects. At this period it is con­  
fidentl&#x27;y believed that few persons can be  
found within the-United States, who do  
not admit that a navy, well org&#x27;anized,  
must conititutc the natural and eﬄc&#x27;ient de-si  
tence of this country against all foreigu  
hostility. &#x27; &#x27;  
&#x27;l&#x27;he progress that has been made in the ,  
manufatture ofarms, leaves no&#x27;doubt that si  
the public patronage has already placed &quot;  
this country beyond necessary dependance  
; on foreign markets, for an article so indis- &#x27;  
? pensible for defence; and gives us assuranc- .  
ss es, that under the encouragement which  
3 government will continue to extend to  
3 this important object, we shall soon fival  
soreign countries, not only in the number,  
but in the quality oi&#x27;arms, complete? from

cvcnt explains the great and increasing te­  
shame: of our country, it carries alon  
with it &amp; proof which cannot be resiﬂ&#x27;ed,  
that those measures of maritime defende,  
which were calculatcd to meet our encm --  
upon the ocean, and which imvcproduccd ..  
such extcnsivc protection to but Cozinmcrcey -  
were founded in wisdom and policy. The f-ss

to the Plaictncst truths, which cannot dis.­

Sir,  
  
The houfe of reprefentatives have re-  
ceived with great refpeel, the communi-  
cation which you have been pleafed to  
make to the two houfes of congrei&#x27;s, at the  
commencement of the prelent feflion.  
The final edafclilhment of the feat of the  
national government, wdiich has now ta-  
ken place, within the Didriel o#Colum-  
bia, is an event of no fmall importance in  
the political traiiiaclions of our country :  
and we cordially unite our wifhes with  
yours, that this territory may be the re-  
lidence of happinels and virtue.  
  
Nor can we, on this occalion, omit to  
exprels a hope, that the fpttit which ani-  
mated the great founder of this city, may  
delcend to future generations, and that  
the wifdom, maguanimity and fteadinefs,  
which marked the events of his public  
life, may be initiated in all l&#x27;ucceeding  
ages.  
  
A confideration of thofe powers which  
have been veiled in congrefs, over the  
Didrict of Columbia, will not efcape our  
attention ; nor (hall we forget that in cx-  
ercifing tHSfe powers, a regard muft be  
had to thoi&#x27;e events which will necefiari-  
ly attend the cap&#x27;uol of Ameiica.  
  
&#x27;1 ne cheerfulnel&#x27;3 and regularity wit!)  
which the officers and foldiers of the tem-  
porary army have leturued to the condi-  
tion of private citizens, is a tellimony  
clear and conclulive, of the purity of  
thoi&#x27;e motives which induced them to en-  
gage in the public fervice ; and will. re  
main a proof, on all future occalions,  
that an army of foldiers, drawn from the  
citizens of onr dountry, deferve our con-  
fidence and refp\ct.  
  
No filbje&#x27;dl can be more important than  
that of the judiciary, which you have  
ngain recommended to our confideration,  
and it fhall receive our early and delibe-  
rate attention.  
  
The conltitution of the.Unitcd States  
having confided the management of our  
foreign negotiations to the control of the  
executive power, we cheerfully fubmit to  
its deci&#x27;.ions on this important fubject.  
And in refpect to t he negotiations now  
pending with France, we lincerely hope  
that the final refult may prove as fortu-  
nate to our country, as the molt ardent  
mind can with.  
  
So long .is a predatory war is carried  
on againil our commerce, we mould fa-  
crifice the intcrelts, and difappoint the  
expectations of our conftituents, fliould  
we for a moment, relax that fyftem of ma-  
ritime defence, which has refuited in  
filch beneficial effects. At this period it  
is confidently believed, that few perfons  
can be found within the United States,  
who do not admit, that a navy, well or-  
ganized, mud conftitute the natural and  
efficient defence of this country, againft  
all foreign hoftility.  
  
The progrefs which has been made in  
the manufacture of arms, leases no doubt  
that the public patronage has already  
j placed this country beyond all neceffary  
dependance on foreign markets, for an ar-  
ticle fo,indifpenfible for defence; and  
gives Ui allurances, that under the en-  
couragement which government will con-  
tinue to extend to this important object,  
we (hall loon rival foreign countries, not  
only in the number, but in the qualily of  
arms coinpleated from our own manufac-  
tories.  
  
Few&quot; events could have been more  
pleafing to our conftituents, than tiiat  
great and rapid increafe of revenue which  
has arifen from permanent taxes. Whilft  
this event explains the great and increaf-  
ing refources of our country, it carries  
il mg with it a proof which cannot be re-  
futed, that thoi&#x27;e meafures of maratime  
defence, which were calculated to meet  
our enemy upon the ocean, and which  
  
avoid the caufes which may have produ- &#x27;.&#x27; lutve produced fucli extenfive protection  
ced it. If, turning our eyes homeward, j| to ( &quot; QH£ commerce, were founded in wif-  
wc find reafon to rejoice at the profpeel I dom and policy. The mind mud, in our  
which prefents itfelf ; if we perceive the &quot; ,.„ n . be infenfible to the plained  
  
interior of our country profperou  
and happy; if all enjoy in fafety,un &#x27;  
  
.1^&#x27;  
,iX the ,ited ground a  
  
-uinot difcern the eleva-  
  
i u./i&#x27;uy La» pla-  
  
ced our country. That national ipirit,  
w hich alone could \ indicate our common  
ights, has been roufed, and thofe latent  
energies, which had not been fully known,  
were unfolded and brought into view, and  
our fellow citizens were prepared to meet  
every event winch national honor, or na-  
tional fecurity could render necefTary.  
Nor have its effects been much leis im-  
portant in other refpects. Whild many  
of&#x27; the nations of the earth have been im-  
poverished and depopulated, by internal  
commotions and national conteft, our in-  
ternal peace has not been materially im-  
paired — our commerce has extended, un-  
der the protection of our infant navy, to  
e very part of the globe — wealth has flow-  
ed without intermiHion,into our feaports,  
and the labors of the h&#x27;_- (band man have  
been rewarded by a ready market for the  
productions of the foil.  
  
Be affuredfir, that the various and im-  
portant fubjects recommended to our con-  
fideration, lhall receive our early and de-  
liberate attention, and confident of vour  
co-operation, in every meafure which may  
be calculated to promote the general in-  
tereft, we fliall endeavor on our part, to  
teftify by our injuftry and difpatch, the  
zeal and fincerity with which we regard  
the public good

4 - STATES. t ¥  
Sir, :  
THE House of Reprelentatives have  
received, with great refpeft, the communi.  
cation which you have been plealed 1o  
make to the two houses of Congress, at the  
commencement of the prelent session,  
The final establishment of the feat of na­  
tional government, which has now taken  
place, within the diftri&amp; of Columbia, is  
an cvent of no {mall importance in the po­  
litical tran{aions of our country ; and we  
cordially unite our wishes with yours, that  
this territory may be the residence of hap­  
piocls and virtue. - -  
Nor can we, on this occasion, omit to  
exprefls a hope, that the {pirit which anima­  
ted the great founder of this city, may de­  
scend 1o future gencrations, and that the  
wildem, magnanimity and steadiness, which  
marked:.che events of his public ‘life, may  
be imitated in all succeeding ages. .- -  
&quot;A consideration of those powers, which  
have beep vested in COngrcl:oover the dif­  
tri€t of Columbia, will not escape our at­  
tention, nor shall we forget, that in exerci:  
sing these powers, a regard must be had to  
those events, which will neccflarily attend  
the capital of America. :  
~ The cheerfulnefs and regularity, with  
which the officers and {oldiers of tl\e tem­  
porary army, have returned to the condi­  
tion of private citizens, is a teflimony, clear  
and conclusive, of&#x27;the purity of thole mo.  
tives, which induced them to engage in the  
public fervicey; and will remdin a proof on  
all future ocdafions that .an army of sol­  
diers, drawn from the citizens of our coun­  
try, deserves our confidence and refpeét.  
‘No {ubje&amp;t can &#x27;be mdre important, than  
that of the Judiciary, which you have a­  
gain recommended to our consideration,  
and it shall receive our early and deliber­  
ale attention. B B  
  
. .The Conflitution of the United States  
~having confided the management of our  
foreign negociations to the controul of the  
executive power, we- cheerfully submit to  
its decisions on this important fubjeft. And  
in refpeét 10 the negociations now pending  
with Franée we sincerely hope that the fipal  
reflult may prove as fortunate to our coun­  
try as the meft ardent mind can with, . -  
8o ‘long as a predatory war is carricd on  
against our commerce, we fhetld facrifice  
the iriterefts, and disappoint the expe&amp;a­  
tions of our conftitvents should we, fora  
dioment, relax that system of Manitime de­  
fence, which has resulted in such beneficial  
cifeéls. ‘At this period it is confidently be­  
lieved, that few perfonscan be found within  
the United States, who do not admit that a  
navy, well organized, must constitute the  
~ patural and cfficient defence of this country  
agaioft all foreign boftilicy. it  
&quot; The progress which has been made in  
the manufallure of arms, leaves no doubt  
that the public patronage, has already pla­  
ced this country beyond all necessary de­  
pendance on foreign markets, for an arti.  
cle so indispensable for defence : and gives  
us assurances, that under the encourage­  
~ ment which government will continue to  
extend to this important objeft, we shall  
. soon rival foreign countiies not only in the  
- number but in the quality of arms, com­  
- pleated from our own manufaflories,  
&#x27;~ Few events could have been more plea­  
~ sing to our conflituents, then that great and  
- rapid increase of revenue, which has arisen  
~ from permanent taxcs. Whillt this event  
explains the great and increasing resource of  
- our country, 1t carries along with it&quot;a proof  
~ which cannot be resisted, that those mea­  
~ fures of maritime defence, which were cal­  
- culated to meet our encmy upon the ocean,  
~and which have produced 4uch extensive  
- protcélion to our commeice, were founded  
1o wisdom apd policy. The mind must in  
! our opinion, be insensible to the plainest  
; truths, which cannot discern the eclevated  
- ground on which this policy has placed our  
couniry. Thar national spirit, which alone  
- could vindicate our common rights, bas been  
-roused, and those latent energies, which had  
not been fully knowr, were unfolded and  
_ brought into view, and our fellow citizens  
were prepared to meet every cvent, which  
national honour or national security could  
render neceflary. Nor have its effeßs been  
much less important in other refpefis,
