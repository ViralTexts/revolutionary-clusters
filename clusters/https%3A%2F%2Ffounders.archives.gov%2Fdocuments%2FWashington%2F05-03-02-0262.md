It is clear however that it could not be to Mr Grand, nor to the Commissioners from Congress, for we did not meet in France ’till the end of December 1776 or begining of January 1777. that Banker was not charged before with our Affairs. By the Ministers reserve in refusing him a copy of the receipt, I conjecture it must be money, advanced for our use to Mr Beaumarchais, and that it is a Mystere du Cabinet, which perhaps should not be farther enquired into, unless necessary to guard against more demands than may be just from that Agent; for it may well be supposed that if the Court furnished him with the means of supplying us, they may not be willing to furnish authentic proofs of such a transaction so early in our dispute with Britain—Pray tell me, has he dropped his demands, or does he still continue to worry you with them

That the aforesaid sums, when paid, shall be passed to the credit of the States respectively, on the terms prescribed by the resolve of Congress of the 6th day of October 1779, and shall be applied in conformity to the statement in the preceding part of this report, giving preference according to the order in which they are placed in the Estimate.  
As one million, six hundred and six thousand, five hundred and sixty Dollars called for, is to be applied to the payment of the Interest of the Domestic Debt, that the several States be allowed to discharge the same by Indents for Interest on Loan-Office Certificates, and upon other certificates of the liquidated Debts of the United States: And to ascertain the evidences of Interest due upon loan-Office Certificates, the holders thereof respectively shall be at liberty to carry them to the office from which they issued, and the holders of other certificates of liquidated debts of the United States, to carry the same to the loan-office of that State wherein they are Inhabitants, or if foreigners, to any loan-office within the united States, and to have the interest thereon settled and certifyed to the last day of the year 1785.  
Provides that the Commissioner of the Continental loan-office in any State, shall not on any pretence whatever, settle or issue any Certificate or Certificates, for the Interest due on any Continental loan-office Certificate, or other certificate of liquidated debts, until the State for which he is continental Loan-officer, shall have passed a legislative act complying with this requisition, nor shall the commissioner aforesaid, in any State that shall have complied with this requisition, issue any Certificate, or take any other measure whereby a discrimination may be made by such state, between the holders of loan office Certificates issued from his Office, who are Citizens of that State, and foreigners, or the Citizens of any other State that shall have complied with this requisition: Provided always, that any continental Loan officer shall issue Certificates for interest as aforesaid, due on Continental loan office Certificates issued from his office &amp; belonging to Foreigners, and also to the Citizens of such states as shall have passed a legislative act complying with this requisition.  
That every Commissioner of the Continental loan-office previously to settling and issueing Certificates as aforesaid for the Interest due on Certificates of liquidated debts, other than loan office Certificates, shall administer an oath or affirmation, or require a Certificate signed by one of the persons whom the State in which the Commissioner resides, shall, in the legislative Act complying with this requisition, appoint, that he has administered to the owner or possessor of every such certificate, an oath or affirmation that the same is bona fide the property of the particular State in which the said Commissioner resides, or of a Citizen or Citizens of the said State, or of some Corporate body or charitable institution within the same, or of some person who is not a citizen of any of the United States, describing the Certificate or Certificates alluded to in every such oath or Affirmation, in such manner as shall be necessary to identify the same, or as may be prescribed by the Legislature of the said State.  
And for preventing the depreciation of Certificates to be issued as aforesaid, the legislature  
  
of each State is required to provide, in the Act complying with this requisition, that if, on the first day of July 1787 the said States quota of the said certificates so to be issued, shall not be in the hands of the State Treasurer, or other proper officer, the deficiency shall be collected and paid into the continental treasury in specie, which, when so paid, is hereby apropriated to the redemption of such surplus certificates. That the board of Treasury furnish the several loan-officers with Certificates to be issued for interest, as aforesaid; and also with such checks and instructions as they from time to time shall judge necessary to prevent counterfeited Certificates of debts, from obtaining a settlement of Interest, and to detect counterfeit evidences of interest, and thereby to avoid receiving them in discharge of Taxes: which certificates of interest being parted with by the holders of the principal, shall be deemed evidence that he has received satisfaction for the same; and therefore shall be receivable from the Bearer in lieu of money, in the proportion of one dollar and one third in specie for one dollar in Indents, in any other State in the Union, as well as in the State in which they were issued. That the state receiving such Certificates, and paying the same into the public Treasury, with a proportion of specie as aforesaid, shall have credit therefor, which payment shall be considered as a discharge of the interest on the Domestic Debt in the proportion that each state avails itself of the said Certificates of interest. That all loanoffice Certificates issued after the first day of March 1778 shall be reduced to their specie value, conformably to the resolution of Congress of the 28th June 1780 and the interest shall be ascertained and settled agreeably to the Specie value of the certificate.
