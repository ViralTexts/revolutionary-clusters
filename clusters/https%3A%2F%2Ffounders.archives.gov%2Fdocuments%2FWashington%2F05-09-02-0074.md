ear Harriot  
Philadelphia October 30th 1791.  
  
I have received your letter of the 21st instant, and shall always be glad to hear from you—When my business will permit inclination will not be wanting in me to acknowledge the receipt of your letters, and this I shall do more cheerfully as it will afford me opportunities at those times of giving you such occasional advice as your situation may require.  
At present I could plead a better excuse for curtailing my letter to you than you had for shortening of yours to me, having a multitude of business before me while you have nothing to do, consequently you might, with equal convenience to yourself, have set down to write your letter an hour or two, or even a day sooner, as to have delayed it until your Cousin was on the point of sending to the Post-Office—I make this remark for no other reason than to shew you it is better to offer no excuse than a bad one, if at any time you should happen to fall into an error.  
Occupied as my time now is, and must be during the sitting of Congress, I nevertheless will endeavor to inculcate upon your mind the delicacy and danger of that period, to which you are now arrived under peculiar circumstances—You are just entering into the state of womanhood without the watchful eye of a Mother to admonish, or the protecting aid of a Father to advise and defend you; you may not be sensible that you are at this moment about to be stamped with that character which will adhere to you through life—the consequence of which you have not perhaps attended to, but be assured it is of the utmost importance that you should.  
Your Cousins, with whom you live are well qualified to give you advice, and I am sure they will if you are disposed to receive it—But if you are disobliging—self willed and untowardly it is hardly to be expected that they will engage themselves in unpleasant disputes with you, especially Fanny, whose mild and placid temper will not permit her to exceed the limits of wholesome admonition or gentle rebuke. Think then to what dangers a giddy girl of 15 or 16 must be exposed in circumstances like these—To be under but little or no controul may be pleasing to a mind that does not reflect, but this pleasure cannot be of long duration,  
  
and reason, too late perhaps, may convince you of the folly of misspending time. You are not to learn, I am certain, that your fortune is small—supply the want of it then with a well cultivated mind. with dispositions to industry and frugality—with gentleness of manners—obliging temper—and such qualifications as will attract notice, and recommend you to a happy establishment for life.  
You might instead of associating with those from whom you can derive nothing that is good, but may have observed every thing that is deceitful, lying, and bad, become the intimate companion of and aid to your Cousin in the domestic concerns of the family.  
Many Girls before they have arrived at your age have been found so trustworthy as to take the whole trouble of a family from their Mothers; but it is by a steady and rigid attention to the rules of propriety that such confidence is obtained, and nothing would give me more pleasure than to hear that you had acquired it—The merits and benefits of it would redound more to your own advantage in your progress thro’ life, and to the person with whom you may in due time form a matrimonial connexion than to any others—but to none would such a circumstance afford more real satisfaction than to Your affectionate Uncle

who had resided for some time in his family, and to  
whom he continued to extend his care and aid. She  
then resided with some of the other relatives at Fred-

Dear Harriet,—Occupied as my time now is,  
and must be during the sitting of Congress, I  
nevertheless will endeavor to inculcate upon  
your mind the delicacy and danger of that period,  
to which you are now arrived under peculiar cir-  
cumstances. Yov are just entering into the state  
of womanhood, without the watchful eye of a  
mother to admonish, or the protecting aid of a  
father to advise and defend you; you may not be  
sensible, that you are at this moment about to be  
stamped with that character, which will adhere to  
you through life; the consequences of which you  
have not perhaps attended to, but be assured it is  
  
  
  
  
  
give you advice; and I am sure they will if you|  
  
are disposed to receive it. But if you are diso-  
bliging, self-willed and untowardly, it is hardly to  
be expected that they will engage themselves in  
unpleasant disputes with you, especially Fanny,  
whose mild and placid temper will not permit her  
to exceed the limits of wholesome admonition or  
gentle rebuke. Think then, to what dangers a  
giddy girl of fifteen or sixteen must be exposed in  
circumstances like these. To be under little or  
no control’ may be pleasing to a mind that does  
not reflect, but this pleasure cannot be of long  
duration, and reason, too late perhaps, may con-  
vince you of the folly of misspending time. You  
are not to learn, I am certain, that your fortune  
is small. Supply the want of it, then, with a well  
cultivated mind, with dispositions to industry and  
frugality, with gentleness of manners, an obliging  
temper, and such qualifications as will attract no-  
tice, and recommend you to a happy establishment  
for life.  
  
You might, instead of associating with those  
from whom you can derive nothing that is good,  
but may have observed every thing that is deceit-  
ful, lying, and bad, become the intimate compan-  
ion of, and aid to your cousin in the domestic  
concerns of the family. Many girls before they  
have arrived at your age, have been found so  
trustworthy as to take the whole charge of the  
family from their mothers; but it is by a steady  
and rigid attention to the rules of propriety, that  
such confidence is obtained, and nothirg would  
give me more pleasure than to hear that you had  
acquired it. The merits and benefits of it would  
redound more to your advantage in your progress  
through life, and to the person with whom you  
may in due time form a matrimonial connection,  
than to any others; but to none would such a cir-  
cumstance afford more real satisfaction, than to  
  
Your affectionate Uncle.

Dear Harriet : I received your letter of the 21st

At present I could plead a better excuse for

which will adhere to you through life; the conic­

that you should. Your cousins, with whom you

it. But if you are duobliging, clf-wil!od, and

! Fredericksburg. It is dated Philadelphia, SOtb l  
Oct. 1791 :  
Dear Harriet : I received your letter of the  
21st inst. and shall always be glad to tirai from  
you. When my business vviM permit, inclina­  
linn will not be wanting in in* to acknowledge  
the receipt of your letters ; and this I shall do

portunities at those times, of giving you much  
occasional advice, as your situation may re­  
quire;  
At present I Could plead a better excuse  
for curtailing my letter to you, than you had  
for shortening yours to me. having a multitude  
of occupations before me, while voo have  
nothing to do; consequently you might with  
ns much convenience to yourself have sat

reason than to show it is better to offer no ex­  
cuse than a bad one, if at any time you should  
happen to fall into an error.  
Occupied as mv time now is and must lie  
1 during the sitting of Congress, I nevertheless,  
will endeavor to inculcate upon your mind  
the delicacy and danger of thnt period to  
w hich you are now arrived under peculiar cir­  
cumstances. You are just entering into the  
state of womanhood, without the watchful eye  
of a mother to admonish, or the protecting  
aid of a father to advise and defend you, you  
may not be sensible, that you are at this mo­  
ment about to lie stamped with that character,  
which will adhere to you through life, the  
consequence of which you have not perhaps  
attended to, hut lie assured it is of the utmost  
importance that you should. Yqur cousins,  
with whom you live, are well qualified to give  
you advice; and I am sure they will if you  
are disposed to receive it. Bu( if you are dis­  
obliging, self-willed, and untnwardly, it is  
hardly to he expected that Ifley wijj engage  
themselves in unpleasant disputes wtlli you,  
especially Fanny, whose mild and placid tem­  
per will trot permit Iter to exceed the limits  
of w holesome admonitions or gentle rebuke.  
Think then, to what dangers a giddy girl ol  
fifteen or sixteen must he exposed to in cir­  
cumstances like these. To he under little or  
control may lie pleasing to a mind that dues  
not reflect, lint this plcrsuie cannut be of long  
duration, and reason, too late perhaps, may  
convince you of the folly of mispending time.  
You are not to learn, I am certain, that your  
fortune is small. Supply the w ant of it, then,  
with a well cultivated mind, with dispositions  
to industry and frugality, with gentleness of  
manners, an obliging temper, and such quali­  
fications as will attract notice, and recommend  
you to a happy establishment for this life.  
You might, instead of associating with those  
from whom you can derive nothing that is  
| good, lint may have observed every thing that  
is deceitful, lying, and had, become the inti­  
mate companion of, and aid to your cousin in  
the domestic concerns of the family. Many  
girls, before they have arrived at )»ur age,  
have been found so trust worthy as to lake the  
whole charge of the family from their moth­  
er; but it is by a steady and rigid attention  
to Ibe rules of propriety, that such confidence  
is obtained, and nothing would give me more  
pleasure than lo hear that you had acquired it.  
The merits and benefits of il would redound  
more to your advantage in your progress

Dear Harriet: I have received your letter  
of the 2lst instant, and shall always be glad to  
hear from you. When my business will per-  
mit, inclination will not be wanting in me to  
acknowledge the receipt of your letters ; and  
this I shall do the more cheerfully, as it wall  
afford me opportunities at those times of giving  
  
you such occasional advice as your situation |  
  
may require.  
  
At present I could plead a better excuse for  
curtailing my letter to you, than you had for  
shortening yours to me, having a multitude of  
occupations before me, while you have nothing  
to do, consequently you might with as much  
convenience toyourself have sat down to write  
your letter an hour or two or even a daysoon-  
er as have delayed it until your cousin was on  
the point of sending to the post-oflice. I make  
this remark fox no other reason, than to show  
  
  
  
it is better to offer »o excuse than a bad one, if  
  
at any time you should fall iute an error,

Or  
  
  
  
Oecupied as my time now is, and must be,  
during the sitting of Congress, I nevertheless  
will endeavor to inculcate upon your mind the  
delicacy and danger of that period, to which  
you are now arrived under peculiar eircumstan-  
ces. You are just entering into the state of  
womanhood, without the watehfal eye of a  
| mother to admonish, or the protecting aid of a  
| father to advise or defend you ; you may not  
be sensible, that you are at this moment about  
to be stamped with that character, which will  
adhere to you through life ; the consequences  
of which you may not have perhaps attended  
to, but be assured that itis of the utmost impor-  
tance that you should. Your cousins with  
whom you live, are well qualified to give you  
advice, and I am sure they willif you are dis-  
posed to receiveit. But if youare disobliging,  
self-willed and untowardly, it is hardly to be  
expected that they will engage themselves in  
unpleasant disputes with you, especially Fan-  
ny, Whose mild and placid temper, will not per-  
mit her to exceed the limits of wholesome ad-  
monition or gentle rebuke. Think then, to  
what dangers a giddy girl of fifteen or sixteen  
must be exposed in circumstances like these.--  
To be under little or.mo control may be pleas-  
ing toa mind that-does not reflect, but this  
pleasure cannot be of long duration, and rea-  
son, too late perhaps, may convince you of the  
| folly of mispending time. Youare not to learn  
Tam certain, that your fortune issmall. Sup-  
ply the want of it, then, with a well cultivated  
mind, with dispositions to industry and frugal-  
ity, with gentleness of manners, an obliging  
temper, and such qualifications as will attract  
notice, and recommend you to a happy estab-  
lishment for life.  
  
You might, instead of associating with those  
from whom you can derive nothing that is  
good, but may have observed every thing that  
is deceitful, lying and bad, becéme the compan-  
ion of, and aid to your cousin in the domestic  
concerns of the family. Many girls before  
they have arrived at your age, have been found  
so trust-worthy as to take the whole charge of  
the family from their mothers ; but it is by a  
steady and rigid attention to the rules of pro-  
priety, that such confidence is obtained, and  
nothing would give me more pleasure than to  
hear that you had acquired it. The merits  
zand benefits of it would redound more to your  
| advantage in your progress through life, and to  
| ihe person with whom you may in due time  
  
forui a matrimonial connection, than to any  
| others; butto none would such a circumstance  
-aflord more real satisfaction, than to your af-

and frugality, with gentleness of manners,  
an obliging temper, and such qualifications  
as will attract notice, and recommend you to  
a happy establishment for life.  
  
You might, instead of associating with  
those from whom you can derive nothing  
that is good, but may have observed every-  
thing that is deceitful, lying, and bad, be-  
come the intimate companion of, and aid to  
your cousin in the domestic concerns of the  
family. Many girls before they have ar-  
tived at your age, have been so trustworthy  
as to take the whole charge of the family  
from their mothers; but it is by a steady  
and rigid attention to the rules of propriety,  
that such confidence is obtained, and nothing  
would give me more pleasure than to hear  
that you had acquired it. The merits and  
benefits of it would: redound more to your  
progress through life, and to the person with  
whom you may in due time form a matrimo-  
nial connexion, than any other; but to none  
would such a circumstance afford more real  
satisfaction, than to your affectionate uncle.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
dated at Philadelphia, 29th of October, 1791:  
  
Dear Harriet.—I received your letter of  
the 2Ist instant, and shall always be glad to  
hear from you. When my business will per-  
mit, inclination shall not be wanting in me to  
acknowledge the receipt of your letters; and  
this I shall do more carefully, as it affords me  
opportunities at those times, of giving you such  
occasional advice, as your situation may re-  
quire.  
  
At present, I could plead a better cause for  
curtailing my letter to you, meri no had for  
shortening yours to me, while you have nothing  
to do; consequnetly you might, with as much  
convenience to yonrself, have sat down to write  
your letter an hour or even a day sooner, as  
have delayed it until your cousin was on the  
point of sending to the Post Office. I make  
this remark for no other reason, than to show  
you it is better to offer no excuse than a bad  
one, if at any time you should happen to fall  
into an error.  
  
Occupied as my time now is, and must be  
during the session of Congress, I nevertheless  
will endeavour to inculcate upon your mind the  
delicacy and danger of that period, to which  
you are now arrived under peculiar circumstan-  
ces, You are just enternig into the state of  
womanhood, without the watchful eye of a mo-  
ther to admonish, or the protecting aid of a  
father to advise and defend you; you may be  
sensible, that you are this moment about to be  
stamped with that character, which will adhere  
to you through life, the consequences of which  
you have not perhaps attended to, but be  
assured it is of the utmost importance you  
should. Your cousins, with whom you live, are  
well qualified to give you advice; andI am sure  
they willif you are disposed to receive it. Butif  
you are disobliging, self-willed, and untoward-  
ly, it is hardly to be expected they will engage  
themselves in unpleasant disputes with you,  
especially Fanny, whose mild and placid tem-  
per will not permit her to exceed the limits of  
wholesome admonition or gentle rebuke.  
  
Think, then, to what dangers a giddy girl of  
fifteen or sixteen must be exposed in circum-  
stances like these. To be under little or no  
concern may be pleasing to a mind that does  
not reflect, but this pleasure cannot be of long  
duration, and reason, too late, perhaps, may

you to a happy establishment for life.  
  
You might, instead of associating with those  
from whom you can derive nothing that is good,  
but may have observed everything that is de-  
ceitful, lying, and bad, become the intimate  
companion of and aid to your cousin in the  
domestic concerns of the family. Many girls  
before they have arrived at your age have been  
so trustworthy as to take the whole charge of  
the family from their mothers; but it is by a  
steady and rigid attention to the rules of pro-  
priety, that such confidence is obtained, and  
nothing would give me more pleasure than to  
hear that you had acquired it. The merits and  
benefits of it would redound more to your pro-  
gress through life, and to the person with whom  
you may in due time form a matrimonial con-  
nexion, than any other ; but to none would sucha  
circumstance afford more real satisfaction, than  
your affectionate ‘uncle,

education, clothes, etc., he expended some two thousand  
ounds in about ten years. His letter to his niece,  
arriot, is worthy of reproduction. As our first Presi-  
dent he was struggling, almost to mental and physical  
exhaustion, under the multifarious cares incident to the  
successful initiation of a novel and somewhat distrusted  
scheme of government. That he should then have  
written with his own hand a long letter of advice to a  
dependent girl of fifteen is one of the many acts indicat-  
ing the greatness of his character. He says in part :  
  
“Your cousins, with whom you live, are well qualified to  
give you advice ; and I am sure they will, if you are disposed  
to receive it. But if you are disobliging, self-willed and  
untowardly it is hardly to be expected that they will engage  
themselves in unpleasant disputes with you. To be  
under little or no control may pleasing to a mind that does  
not reflect, but this pleasure cannot be of long duration ; and  
reason, too late, perhaps, may convince you of the folly of  
misspending time. You are not to learn, I am certain, that  
your fortune is small. Su ply the want of it, then, with a  
weill-cultivated mind, wit ispositions to industry and  
frugality, with gentleness of manner, obliging temper, and  
such qualifications as will attract notice, and recommend you  
to a happy establishment for life.’’
