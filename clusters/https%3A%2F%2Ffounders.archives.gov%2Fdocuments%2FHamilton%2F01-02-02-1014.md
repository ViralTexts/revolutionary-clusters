 the cause of keeping such shoals of Militia on foot, and their service has been accompanied with such destruction and loss as has almost laid waste the whole Country. Nothing has been more destructive to the true interest of this Country, than the mode adopted for its defence. Two misfortunes happening one after the other may have renderd it unavoidable the last season; but should it be continued, the Inhabitants are inevitably ruined, and the resources of the Country rendered incapable of affording support to an Army competent to its defence. Government here is infinitely more popular than to the Northward; and there is no such thing as National character or National Sentiment. The Inhabitants are from all quarters of the globe; and as various in their opinions projects and schemes, as their manners and habits are from their early education. Those in office from a vanity to be thought powerful join in the measure of imposing upon the public respecting the strength and resource of these Southern States; and while Congress and the Minister of France are kept under this fatal delusion I fear little support will be given to this department. The Inhabitants are numerous but they would be rather formidable abroad than at home. They are scatterd over such a vast extent of Country that it is difficult to collect and still more difficult to subsist them. There is a great spirit of enterprise among the back people; and those that come out as volunteers are not a little formidable to the enemy. There are also some particular Corps under Sumpter Marion and Clarke that are bold and daring; the rest of the Militia are better calculated to distroy provisions than oppose the Enimy.

 ability is wanting with some and inclination with others. Public credit is so totally lost, that private people will not give their aid, though they see themselves involved in one common ruin. It is my opinion that General Washingtons influence will do more than all the Assemblies upon the Continent. I always thought him exceeding popular; but in many places he is little less than ador’d; and universally admir’d. His influence in this Country might possibly effect something great. However I found myself exceedingly well receivd; but more from being the friend of the Generals than from my own merit.

If I cannot inspire the Army with confidence and respect by an independant conduct I foresee it will be impossible to instill dicipline and order among the troops.

that both should be performed. He called no councils  
of war, studying every question himself, and com-  
municating his intentions to only two or three of his  
officers whom he trusted most. In a letter to General  
Hamilton, he says, ‘If I cannot inspire the army with  
confidence and respect by an independent conduct, I  
foresee it will be impossible to instill discipline and
