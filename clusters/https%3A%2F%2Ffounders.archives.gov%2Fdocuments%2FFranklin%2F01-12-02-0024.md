The Paper Money Act of 1739, being the compleatest of the kind, as containing all the Improvements which Experience had from time to time suggested, in the Execution of preceding Acts, an Account of that Act will probably be most satisfactory.  
The Sum thereby directed to be printed was £80,000 Proclamation Money, to be emitted on Loan.  
Five Persons were nominated Trustees of the Loan-Office, under whose Care and Direction the Bills were to be printed, and emitted.  
To suit the Bills for a common Currency, they were of small and various Denominations from Twenty Shillings downwards to One Shilling.  
Various Precautions were taken to prevent Counterfeits, by Peculiarities in the Paper, Character, Manner of Printing, Signing, Numbering, &amp;c.  
The Trustees took an Oath and gave Security for the due and faithful Execution of their Office.  
They were to lend out the Bills on real Security of at least double the Value, for a Term of Sixteen Years, to be repaid in Yearly Quotas or Installments, with Interest at Five per Cent. Thus One Sixteenth Part of the Principal, was yearly paid back into the Office. The Interest was apply’d to Publick Services; the Principal during the first 10 Years, let out again to fresh Borrowers.  
The new Borrowers from Year to Year, were to have the Money only for the remaining Part of the Term of Sixteen Years, paying by fewer and of course proportionably larger Installments, and during the last Six Years of the Sixteen, the Sums paid in were not to be re-emitted, but burnt and destroyed, so that at the End of the 16 Years, the whole might be call’d in and sunk, and the Accounts compleatly settled.  
The Trustees were taken from all the different Counties of the Province, their Residence in different Parts giving them better Opportunities of being acquainted with the Value and Circumstances of Estates offered them in Mortgage.  
They were to continue but Four Years in Office, were to account annually to Committees of Assembly, and at the Expiration of that Term they were to deliver up all Monies and Securities in their Hands to their Successors, before their Bonds and Sureties could be discharged.  
Lest a few wealthy Persons should engross the Money which was intended for more general Benefit, no one Person, whatever Security he might offer, could borrow more than One Hundred Pounds.  
Thus Numbers of poor new Settlers were accommodated and assisted with Money to carry on their Settlements, to be repaid in easy Portions yearly, as the yearly Produce of their Lands should enable them.

Let the Bills be issued for Ten Years, payable a Tenth Part of the Principal Sum yearly, with Interest at 6 per Cent.  
Let the Bills be made by the Act a legal Tender in all the Colonies: and the Counterfeiting made Felony of Death.  
Let there be no Limitation of the Sum to be borrowed by one Person, but that every one may borrow as much as he can give double Security for by a Mortgage of real clear Estate.  
And to prevent an over Quantity existing, let an Interest of 5 per Cent be allow’d for all Sums lodg’d in the Office, during the Time the Owner suffers it to remain there. By this means it is suppos’d the proportion will find itself, and adapt itself from time to time to the Occasions of Commerce.

They wer© to lend out the bills on real  
security of at least double the value for a  
term of sixteen years, to be paid with inter­

in Pennsylvania in 173!) was the completeet  
of the kind, containing all the improve­  
ments which experience had from time to  
time suggested, in the execution of preced­  
ing acts; an account of that act will beat ex­  
plain and recommend the measure contained  
in the following proposal:  
The sum of the notes, by that act directed  
to be printed, was 80,000 proclamation  
money. This money was to be emitted to  
the several borrowers, from a loan office es­  
tablished for that purpose.  
Five persona were nominated trustees of  
the loan office, under whose care and direc­  
tion the bills or notes were to be printed  
and emitted.  
To suit the bills for a common currency,  
they were of small and various denomina-.  
tions, from twenty shillings down to one  
shilling.  
Various precautions were taken to pre­  
vent counterfeits, by peculiarities in the  
paper, character, manner of printing, sign­  
ing, numbering, etc  
The trustees took an oath, and gave se  
curity for the due and faithful execution of  
their office.  
They were to lend out the bills on real  
security of at least double the value, for a  
term of at least sixteen years, to be repaid  
in yearly quotas or installments, with in  
terest. Thus one sixteenth part of the prin­  
ciple was yearly paid bark into the office,  
which made trie payment easy to the  
borrower. The interest was applied to pub­  
lic services, the principal during the first  
ten years let out again to fresh borrowers.  
The new borrowers, from year to year,  
were to have the money only for the re­  
maining part of the sixteen years, repaying  
by fewer, and, of course, proportionably  
larger installments, and, during the last six  
years of the sixteen, the sums paid in were  
not to be remitted, but the notes burnt and  
destroyed; so that at the end of sixteen years,  
the whole might be called in and burnt, and  
the accounts completely settled.  
The trustees were taken from all the differ­  
ent counties of the province, their residence  
in different parts giving them better opportu­  
nities of being acquainted with the value and  
circumstances of the estates offered in  
mortgage.  
They were to continue but four years in  
office; were to account annually to com­  
mittees of the Assembly; and, at the expira­  
tion of that term, they were to deliver up  
all money? and securities in their hands to  
their successors; before their bonds and  
securities could be discharged.  
Lest a few wealthy persons should custom  
the money, which was intended for more  
general benefit, no one person whatever  
security he might offer, could borrow more  
than 100.  
Thus numbers of poor new settlers were  
accommodated and assisted with money to  
carry on their settlements, to bere;daia  
epjjy portions yearly, as the yosrly produca  
of their lands pbouli ccsl a ttcra.
