Letter 9.  
My Dear Son.  
St: Petersburg 4. April 1813.  
  
The imperfections of the Mosaic Institutions which it was the object of Christ’s Mission upon Earth to remove appear to me to have been these.  
1. The Want of a sufficient sanction. The Rewards and the Penalties of the Levitical Law had all reference to the present life—There are many passages in the Old Testament which imply a state of existence after death, and some which directly assert a future state of retribution—But none of these were contained in the delivery of the Law—At the time of Christ’s advent it was so far from being a settled article of the Jewish faith, that it was a subject of sharp and bitter controversy between the two principal sects of the Pharisees who believed in it, and of the Sadducees who denied it—It was the special purpose of Christ’s appearance upon Earth to bring immortality to light.—He substituted the rewards and the penalties of a future state in the room of all others—The Jewish Sanctions were exclusively temporal—those of Christ exclusively Spiritual.  
2. The Want of Universality. The Jewish Dispensation was exclusively confined to one small and obscure Nation—The purposes of the Supreme Creator in restricting the knowledge of himself to one petty hord of Egyptian slaves are as inaccessible to our intelligence, as those of his having concealed from them as well as from all the rest of mankind the certain knowledge of their own immortality—The fact is unquestionably so—The mission of Christ was intended to communicate to the whole human race, all the permanent advantages of the Mosaic Law, superadding to them upon the condition of repentance, the kingdom of Heaven; the blessings of eternal life.  
3. The Complexity of the Objects of Legislation. I have remarked in a former Letter that the Law from Sinai comprized not only all the ordinary subjects of regulation for human Societies, but those which human Legislators cannot reach—It was a Civil Law, a Municipal Law, an Ecclesiastical Law, a Law of Police, and a Law of Morality and Religion—It prohibited Murder, Adultery, theft and perjury, and it prescribed the number of taches for the curtains of the tabernacles, and directed how the snuffers for the holy Candlesticks were to be made—It prescribed rules for the thoughts as well as for the Actions of Men—This complexity however practicable and even suitable, for one small national Society, could not have been extended to all the families of the Earth.—The parts of the Jewish Law adapted to promote the happiness of mankind, under every variety of situation and of Government in which they can be placed, were all recognized and adopted by Christ, and he expressly separated them from all the rest—He disclaimed all interference with the ordinary objects of human Legislation—He declared that his kingdom was not of this World. He acknowledged the Authority of the Jewish Magistrates—He paid for his own person the tribute to the Romans—He refused in more than one instance to assume the office of a judge in matters of legal controversy—He strictly limited the objects of his own precepts and authority to religion and morals. He denounced no temporal punishments; he promised no temporal rewards. He took up man as a governable being, where the human Magistrate is compelled to leave him, and supplied both precepts of virtue and motives for practicing it, such as no other moralist or Legislator ever attempted to introduce.  
4. The burdensome duties of positive rites, minute formalities and expensive sacrifices. All these had a tendency not only to establish and maintain the separation of the Jews from all other Nations, but in process of time had been mistaken by the scribes and Pharisees and Lawyers, and probably by the great body of the People, for the Substance of Religion. All these were abolished by Christ, or as St: Paul expresses it were “nailed to his Cross.”  
You will recollect that I am now speaking of Christianity not as the scheme of redemption to mankind from the consequences of original Sin, but as a system of morality for regulating the conduct of men while on Earth. And the most striking and extraordinary feature of its character in this respect is its tendency and its exhortations to absolute perfection—The Language of Christ to his disciples is explicit “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” And this he enjoins at the conclusion of that precept so expressly laid down and so unanswerably argued, “to Love their enemies, to bless those that cursed them, and to pray for those that despitefully used, and persecuted them.” He seems to consider this temper of benevolence in return for injury as constituting of itself a perfection similar to that of the divine Nature—It is undoubtedly the greatest conquest which the spirit of man can atchieve over its own infirmities, and to him who can attain that elevation of Virtue, which it requires, all other Victories over the evil Passions must be easy—Nor was this absolute perfection merely preached by Christ as a doctrine; it was practiced by himself throughout his life—practised to the last instant of his agony upon the Cross—practised, under Circumstances of trail such as no other human being was ever exposed to—He proved by his own example the possibility of that Virtue which he taught; and although possessed of miraculous powers sufficient to controul all the Laws of Nature, he expressly and repeatedly declined the use of them to save himself from any part of the sufferings which he was to endure. The Sum of Christian Morality then consists in Piety to God, and Benevolence to Man—Piety manifested not by formal solemnities and sacrifices of burnt offerings; but by Repentance—by obedience, by Submission by Humility; by the worship of the heart—and Benevolence, not founded upon selfish motives, but superior even to the sense of wrong or the resentment of injuries—Worldly Prudence, is scarcely noticed among all the instructions of Christ—The pursuit of Honours and of Riches the objects of Ambition and Avarice, are strongly discountenanced in many places; an undue solicitude about the ordinary cares of life, is occasionally and forcibly reproved—Of worldly Prudence there are rules enough in the Proverbs of Solomon, and in the compilation of the Son of Sirach—Christ passes no censure upon them—But he left what I have called the Selfish Virtues, where he found them—It was not to proclaim common place morality that he came down from Heaven—His commands were new—That his disciples should love one another—that they should love even Strangers—Nay that they should love their Enemies. He prescribed barriers against all the maleficent Passions; he gave us a Law the utmost point of perfection of which human power are susceptible; and at the same time he allowed degrees of indulgence and relaxation to human frailty proportioned to the powers of every individual.  
An Eminent and ingenious Writer in favour support of Christianity, Dr: Paley, expresses the opinion that the direct object of the Christian Revelation was “to supply motives and not rules, sanctions and not precepts”—and he strongly intimates that independent of the purposes of Christ’s atonement and propitiation for the sins of the World, the only object of his mission upon Earth was to reveal a future State—to bring life and immortality to light. He does not appear to think that Christ promulgated any new principal of morality, and he positively asserts that “morality neither in the gospel, nor in any other book, can be a subject of discovery—Because the qualities of actions depend entirely upon their effects, which effects must all along have been the subject of human experience.” (Paley. Evidences of Christianity, 2—p. 25-26.)  
To this I reply that Christ in the expressly terms of Christ. (John XIII.34.) “A new Command I give unto you—that ye love one Another”—And I add that this command, explained, illustrated and dilated as it was by the whole tenor of his discourses, and especially by the Parable of the good Samaritan appears to me to have been not only entirely new, but in the most rigorous sense of the word a discovery in morals—and a discovery the importance of which to the happiness of the human species, as far exceeds any discovery in the physical Laws of Nature, as the Soul is superior to the body.  
If it be objected that the principle of benevolence towards Enemies, and the forgiveness of injuries, may be found not only in the Books of the old Testament but even in some of the heathen writers, and particularly in the discourses of Socrates, I answer that the same may be said of the immortality of the Soul, and of the rewards and punishments of a future State—The doctrine was not more a discovery than the precept—But their connection with each other, the authority with which they were taught, and the miracles by which they were enforced, belong exclusively to the mission of Christ.—Attend particularly to the miracle recorded in the second Chapter of St: Luke as having taken place at the birth of Jesus—When the Angel of the Lord said to the Shepherds “Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all People—For unto you is born this day in the City of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”—In these words the character of Jesus as the Redeemer was announced—But the Historian adds “And suddenly there was with the Angel a Multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth Peace, good will toward men.”—Which words as I understand them announce the moral precept of benevolence, as explicitly for the object of Christ’s appearance, as the preceding words had declared the purpose of Redemption.  
It is related in the life of the Roman Dramatic Poet Terence, that when one of the personages of his Comedy, the Self-Tormentor, the first time uttered on the Theatre the line “Homo sum, Humani nil a me alienum puto,” an universal shout of applause, burst forth from the whole Audience; and that in so great a multitude of Romans, and of deputies from the Nations their subjects and allies, there was not one individual but felt in his heart the power of this noble sentiment—Yet how feeble and defective it is, in comparison with the Christian command of Charity, as unfolded in the Discourses of Christ, and enlarged upon in the writings of his Apostles!—The heart of man, will always respond with rapture to this sentiment, when there is no selfish or unsocial Passion at work to oppose it—But the command to lay it down as the great and fundamental rule of Conduct, for human life, and to subdue and sacrifice all the tyrannical and selfish Passions to preserve it, this is the peculiar and unfading glory of Christianity—This is the conquest over ourselves, which without the aid of a gracious and merciful God, none of us can atchieve, and which it was worthy of his special interposition, to enable us to accomplish.  
From your affectionate father  
A.

is of the Mosaic institutions  
which it was the object of Christ&#x27;s mission upon  
arth to remove, appear to me to have been these  
etThe want of a sufficient sanction. The rewards  
the Levitical law had all a refer  
present life. There are many passages  
Old Testament which imply a state of ex-  
e after death, and some which directly as  
sert a future state of retribution; but none of these  
were contained in the delivery of the Law. At  
the time of Christ&#x27;s advent it was so far from be­  
ing a settled article of the Jewish faith, that it was  
a subject of bitter controversy between the two  
pal sects--of Pharisees who believed in, and  
Sadducees who denied it. It was the special pur  
e of Christ&#x27;s appearance upon earth to bring  
immortality to light. &quot;He substituted the re  
wards and punishments of a future state of exis  
tence in the room of allothers. The Jewish sanctions  
were exclusively temporal those of Christ exelu  
sively spiritual. 2d-The want of universality.  
The lewish dispensation was exclusively confined  
to a small and obscure nation. The perposes of the  
Supreme Creator in restricting the knowl  
himself to one petty herd of Egyptian slaves, are as  
inaccessible to ourintelligence as those of his having­  
ealed from them, and from the rest of mankind,  
rtain knowledge of their own immortality;  
yet the fact is unquestionable. The mission of  
Christ was intended to communicate to the whole  
human race all the permanent advantages of the  
Mosaic Law, superadding to them--upon the con  
of repentance--the kingdom of Heaven, the  
blessing of eternal life. 2d-The complexity of the  
is of legislation. I have observed in a former  
letter, that the law of Sinai comprised, not only all  
the ordinary subjects of regulation for human so  
cieties, but those which human legislators cannot  
reach. It was a civil law, a municipal law, an  
ecclesiastical law, a law of police, and a law of  
morality and religion: it prohibited murder, adul  
tery, theft and perjury; it prescribed rules for the  
thoughts as well as for the actions of men. The  
xity, however practicable and even suitable  
e small nationa&#x27; society, could not have at  
tained to all the families of the earth. The parts  
of the Jewish Law adapted to promote the happi  
ness of mankind, under every variety of situation  
and Government in which they can be placed, were  
all recognized and adopted by Christ, and He ex  
pressly separated them from the rest. He dis  
laimed all interference with the ordinary objects  
of human legislation; He declared that His &quot;King.  
dom was not of this world.&quot; He acknowledged the  
authority of the Jewish magistrates; He paid for His  
own person the tribute to the Romans; He refused  
in more than one instance to assume the office of  
Judge in matters of legal controversy; He strictly  
limited the object of His own precepts and authori  
religion and morals; He denounced no tem  
poral punishment, He promised no temporal re  
wards; He took up Man as a governable being,  
where the human Magistrate is compelled to leave  
him, and supplied both precept of virtue and mo  
tive for practicing it, such as no other moralist or  
legislator ever attempted to introduce. tth-The  
burdensome duties of positive rites, minute for  
malities and expensive sacrifices. All these had a  
tendency, not only to establish and maintain the  
separation of the Jews from all other nations, but  
in process of time had been mistaken by the­  
Scribes and Pharisees and Lawyers, and probably  
by the body of the people, for the substance of re.  
All the rites were abolished by Christ or  
fas Paul expresses it) &quot;were nailed to His Cross.&quot;  
You will recollect that I am now speaking of Chris  
tianity, not as the scheme of redemption to man  
kind from the consequences of original sin, but as  
a system of morality for regulating the conduct of  
men while on earth; and the most striking and ex  
traordinary feature of its character in this respect,  
is its tendency and exhortations to absolute per  
fection. The language of Christ to His disciples is  
explicit. &quot;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your  
Father in Heaven is perfect&quot;--and this he enjoins at  
the conclusion of that precept, so expressly laid  
down, and so unanswerably argued, to &quot;love their  
enemies, to bleas those who cursed them, and pray for  
those who despitefully used and pertecuted them.&quot;  
He seems to consider the temper of benevolence in  
return for injury, as constituting of itself a perfec.  
tion similar to that of the Divine Nature. It is un  
doubtedly the greatest conquest which the spirit of  
man can achieve over its infirmities; and to him  
who can attain that elevation of virtue which it re  
quires, all other victories over the evil passions  
must be comparatively easy. Nor was the abso  
lute perfection merely preached by Christ as a doc  
trine: it was practiced by Himself throughout His  
Me practiced to the last instant of His agony on  
the Soss; practiced under circumstances of trial,  
such as no other human being was ever exposed  
He proved by His own example the possi  
bility of that virtue which He taught, and although  
possessed of miraculous powers sufficient to con  
the laws of Nature, He expressly and re  
y declined the use of them to save Hims  
from any part of the sufferings which He was able  
to endure. The sum of Christian Morality, then,  
consists in piety to God, and benevolence to Man  
piety, manifested not by formal solemn rites and  
sacrifices of burnt offerings, but by repentance,  
by obedience, by submission, by humility, by the  
  
worship of the heart, and by benevolence, not  
founded upon selfith motives, but superior even to  
Asense of wrong, or the resentment of injuries.  
Worldly prudence is scarcely noticed among all  
the institutions of Christ; the pursuit of bonors  
and riches, the objects of ambition and avarice, are  
strongly discountenanced in many places; and an  
undue solicitude about the ordinary cares of life is  
occasionally reproved. Of worldly prudence, there  
ge rules enough in the Proverbs of Solomon, and  
ia the compilations of the son of Sirach; Christ  
pustes no censure upon them, but He left what I  
call the selfish virtues where He found them. It  
wes not to proclaim common-place morality that  
He came down from Heaven; His commands were  
hew, that His disciples should &quot;love one another,  
hat they should love even strangers, that they  
should &quot;love their enemies.&quot; He prescribed barri  
Gagainst all the maleficient passions, He gave as  
&quot;hy, the utmost point of perfection of which hu  
Ba powers are susceptible, and at the same time  
Soved degrees of indulgence and relaxation to  
hma tralty, proportioned to the power of any ine  
  
dividaal. An eminent writer in support of Ch  
tianity, tDr. Paley) expresses the opinion, that  
t of the Christian revelation wat  
supply motives, and not rules--sanctions, and  
timates that, inde  
hrist&#x27;s atonement and  
tiation for the sins of the world, th  
of His mission upon earth was to reveal a fot  
state, &quot;to bring life and immortality to  
does not appear to think that Christ promulgt  
any new principle of morality, and he positir  
asserts that &quot;morality neither in the Gospel  
in any other book can be a subject of discove  
because qualities of actions depend entirely  
a, which effects, must all alon  
been the subjects of human experience. To th  
the express words of Jesus: &quot;A  
iment I give you, that ye love one  
other,&quot; and I add, that this command explain  
illustrated, and dilated, as it was by the wh  
&quot;His discourses, and especially by the pa  
the Good Samaritan, appears to me to be  
only entirely new, but, in the most rigorous a  
of the word, a discovery in morals, and a discov  
the importance of which to the happiness of  
human race, as far exceeds any discovery in  
phy sical laws of Nature, as the soul is superiot  
the body. If it be objected that the principlet  
benevolence toward enemies, and the forgivn  
of injuries, may be found not only in the old t  
tament, but even in some of the heathen write  
particularly the discourses of Socrates, I answ  
that the same may be said of the immortality of  
soul, and of the rewards and punishmenrs of a  
ture state. The doctrine was not more a discove  
than the precept, but their connexion with et  
wother, the authority with which they were tang  
and the miracles by which they were enforced  
long exclusively to the mission of Christ. Atte  
particularly to the miracle recorded in the secd  
apter of Luke, as having taken place at  
birth of Jesus; when the angel of the Lord said  
the shepherds; &quot;Fear not, for bebold I bring,  
glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to allp  
ple, for unto you is born this day in the City  
David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.  
these words the character of Jesus, as a Redeem  
was announced; but the historian adds--&quot;A  
suddenly there was with the angel a multitude  
the heavenly host praising God and singing, Glory  
od in the highest, and on earth peace, good w  
toward men.&quot; These words, as I understand the  
announced the moral precept of benevolence as o  
plicitly for the object of Christ&#x27;s appearance.  
the preceding words had declared the purpose  
redemption. It is related in the life of the Rome  
dramatic Poet, Terence, that when one of t  
perronages of his comedy the Self Tormentor.  
first time uttered on the stage the line &quot;Ho  
sum, humani nil alienum puto,&quot; (I am a man, I  
thing human is uninteresting to me,) a univers  
 shout of applause burst forth from the whole au  
ence, and that in so great a multitude of Romar  
and deputies from the nations, their subjects ar  
allies, there was not one individual but felt in I  
heart this noble sentiment. Yet how feeble ar  
defective it is, in comparison with the Christi  
command of Charity as unfolded in the discover.  
of Christ and enlarged upon in the writings of he  
apostles. The heart of man will always respor  
with rapture to this sentiment when there is  
selfish or unsocial passion to oppose it but th­  
mand to lay it down as the great and fundament  
rule of conduct for human life, and to subdue ar  
sacrifice all the tyrannical and selfish passions  
preserve it, this is the pecuhar and unfading glor  
of Christianity; this is the conquest over ou  
selves, which without the aid of a merciful God  
none of us can achieve, and which it was worth  
of His special interposition to enable us to accom

The imperfections of the Mosaic institutions |  
which it was the object of Christ’s mission upon |  
earth to remove, appear to me to have been |  
these: Ist—The want of a sufficient sanction.  
|The rewards and penalties of the Levitical law |  
|had alla reference to the present life. There |  
are many passages in the old Testament which  
imply a state of existence after death, and some |  
which directly assert a future state of retribu-|  
tion: but none of these were contained in the  
delivery of the Law. At the time of Christ&#x27;s  
advent, it was so far from being a settled article  
of the Jewish faith, that it was a subject of bit-  
ter controversy between the two sects—of Phari-  
  
nied it. It was the special purpose of Christ’s  
appearance upon earth to ‘bring immortality to  
light.” He substituted the rewards and pun-  
ishments of a fuiure state of existence in the  
room of all others. The Jewish sanctions were  
exclusively temporal; those of Christ excla-  
sively spiritual.  
  
2d—The want of universality. The Jewish  
dispensation was exclusively confined to a small |  
and obscure nation. The purposes of the Su-|  
preme Creator in restricting the knewledge of  
himself to one petty herd of Egyptian slaves, |  
are as inacceasible to our intelligence as those of |  
his having concealed from them and from the rest  
of mankind, the certain knowledge of their own |  
immortality; yet the fact is unquestionable. |  
The mission of Christ was intended to commu-  
nicate to the whole human race all the perma-  
nent advantages of the Mosaic Law, superadd-  
ing to them—upon the condition of sepentnnee|  
—the kingdom of Heaven, the blessing of eter- |  
nal life.  
  
3d—The complexity of the objects of legis-  
lation. 1 have observed in a former letter, that  
the law of Sinai comprised, not only all the or- |  
dinary subjects of regulation for human socie- |  
ties, but those which human legislators cannot  
reach. It was a civil law, a municipal law, an |  
ecclesiastical law, a law of police, and a law of |  
morality and religion: it prohibited murder,  
adultery, theft and perjury ; it prescribed rules |  
for the thoughts as well as for the actions of)  
men. ‘The complexity, however practicable |  
and even suitable for one smal! national society, |  
could not have attained to all the families of the,  
earth. The parts of the Jewish Law adapted |  
to promote the happimess of mankind, under |  
every variety of situatien and government in|  
which they can be placed, were all recognized |  
and adopted by Christ; and He expressly sepa-  
rated them from the rest. He disclaimed all in-  
terference with the ordinary objects of human |  
legislation ; He declared that His ‘Kingdom |  
was not of this work! ;’’ He acknowledged the!  
authority of the Jewish magistrates; He paid  
for His own person the tribute to the Romans ;  
He refused in more than one instance to assume  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Several of | the office of Judge in matiers of legal contro- |  
  
versy ; He strictly limited the object of His |  
own precepts and authority te religion and mor- |  
als; He denounced no temporal punishment ; |  
He promised no temporal rewards ; He took up|  
where the human!  
Magistrate is compelled to leave him, and sup-  
plied both precept of virtue and motive for prac-  
ticing it, such as no other moralist or legislator |  
ever attempted to introduce.  
  
4th—The burdensome duties of positive  
rites, minute formalities and expensive sacri-  
fices. All these had a tendency, not only to es-|  
tablish and maintain the separation of the Jews |  
from all other nations, but in process of time |  
had been mistaken by the Scribes and Phari-|  
sees and Lawyers, and probably by the body of |  
the people, for the substance of religion. All|  
the rites were abolished by Christ, or (as Paul  
expresses it) “were nailed to His Cross.” You  
will recollect that 1 am now speaking of Chris- |  
tianity, not as the scheme of redemption to man-  
kind from the consequences of original sin, but  
as asystem of mora\ty for regulating the con-  
duct of men while on earth; and the most strik- |  
  
  
  
this respect, is its tendency and exhortations to,  
perfection. ‘The language of Christ to His dis- |  
ciples is explicit: ‘Be ye therefore perfect,  
  
  
  
theirs, before, from the alluring gloss of expec-| €¥e” a8 your Father in Heaven is perfect”—and |  
  
this he enjoins at the couclusion of that precept, |  
so expressly laid down, and so unanswerably |  
| argued, to ‘‘love their enemies, to bless those |  
| who cursed them, and pray for those who de-|  
them.” He  
| seems to consider the temper of benevolence in  
| return for injury, a8 constituting of itself a per- |  
fection similar to that of the Divine Nature. It

He was able to endure. The sum of Christian!  
Morality, then, consists in piety to God, and/|  
benevolence to Man: piety, manifested not by |  
forma! solemn rites and sacrifices of burnt-offer-_  
ings, but by repentance, by obedience, by sub-)  
mission, by humility, by the worship of the}  
heart, and by benevolence: not founded upon |  
selfish motives, but superior even to a sense of |  
wrong, or the resentment of injuries.  
  
Worldly prudence is scarcely noticed among  
all the institutions of Christ: the pursuit of  
honors and riches, the objects of ambition and  
avarice, are strongly discountenanced in many  
places ; and an undue solicitude about the ordi-  
nary cares of life is occasionally reproved. Of  
worldly prudence, there are rules enough in the  
Proverbs of Solomon, and in the compilations  
of the son of Sirach ; Christ 8 no censure  
upon them, but He left what I call the selfish  
virtues where He found them. Ii was not to  
proclaim common-place morality that He came  
down from Heaven ; His commands were new ;  
that His disciples should “love one another,”  
that they should love even strangers, that they  
should ‘‘love their enemies.” He prescribed  
barriers against all the maleficient passions ; He  
gave as a law, the utmost point of perfection of  
which human powers are susceptible, and at the  
same time allowed degrees of indulgence and  
relaxation to human frailty, proportioned to the  
power of any individual. An eminent writer,  
in support of Christianity (Dr. Paley) expresses  
the opinion, that the direct object of the Chris-  
tian revelation was to supply motives, and not  
rules— sanctions, and not precepts; and he  
strongly intimates that, independent of the pur-  
pose of Christ’s atonement and propitiation for  
the sins of the world, the only object of His  
mission upor earth was to reveal a future state,  
“to bring life and immortality to light.” He  
does not appear to think that Christ promulgated  
any new principle of morality ; and positively  
asserts that “morality, neither in the Gospel, nor  
ia any other book can be a subject of discovery,  
because qualities of actions depend entirely on  
their effects, which effects must all along have  
been the subjects of human experience.” To  
this I reply in the express words of Jesus: A  
new command ; meg I give you, that ye love one  
  
  
  
  
  
another” ; &quot; command ex-  
plained, illustrated, and dilated, as it was by the  
  
whole tenor of His discourses, and especially  
by the parable of the good Samaritan, appears  
to me to be not only entirely new, but, in the  
most rigorous sense of the word, a discovery in  
morals; and a discovery, the importance of  
which to the happiness of the human race, as  
far exceeds any discovery in the physical laws  
of Nature, as the soul is superior to the body.  
  
If it be objected that the principles of benevo-  
lence toward enemies, and the forgiveness of  
injuries, may be found not only in the Old Tes-  
ment, but even in some of the heathen writers,  
particularly the discourses of Socrates, | arswer,  
that the same may be said of the immortality of  
the soul, and of the rewards and punishments  
of a future state. The doctrine was not more  
a discovery than the precept ; but their connex-  
ion with each other, the authority with which  
they were taught, and the miracles by which  
they were enforced, belong exclusively to the  
mission of Christ. Attend particularly to the  
miracle recorded in the second chapter of Luke,  
as having taken place at the birth of Jesus ;/  
when the angel of the Lord said to the shep-|  
herds : “Fear not, for behold [| bring you glad}  
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all peo-  
ple; for unto you ts born this day in the city of  
David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.” In  
these words the character of Jesus, us a Re-  
deemer, was announced ; but the historian adds,  
“And suddenly there was with the angel a mol-  
titude of the heavenly host praising God and}  
singing, Glorysto God in the highest, and on |  
earth peace, good will toward men.” These)  
words, as I understand them, announced the  
moral precepts of benevolence as explicitly for  
the vbject of Christ’s appeatance, as the pre-  
ceding words had declared the purpose of re-  
demption. It is related in the life of the Ro-  
man dramatic Poet, Terence, that when one of  
the personages of his comedy, the “Self Tor-  
mentor,’ the first time uttered ov the stage the  
line‘*Homo sam, homani nil a me alienum puto,”  
(Lam a man, nothing human js uninteresting to  
me,) a universal shout of applause burst forth  
from the whole audience, and that in so greata  
multitude of Romans, and deputies from the na-  
tions, their subjects and allies, there was not  
one individual but felt in his heart this noble  
sentiment. Yet how feeble and defective itis,  
in comparison with the Christian command of  
Charity as unfolded in the discoveries of Ohrist, |  
and enlarged upon in the writings of His apos- |  
les, The heart of man will always respond |  
with rapture to this sentiment when there is no  
selfish or unsocial passion to oppose it; but the |  
command to lay it down as the great and funda- |  
mental rule of conduct for human life, and to  
subdue and sacrifice all the tyrannical and sel-|  
fish passions to preserve it, this is the peculiar |  
and unfading glory of Christianity ; this is the  
conquest over ourselves, which without the aid.  
of a merciful God, none of us can achieve, and |

man as a governable being, where the human  
Magistrate is compelled to leave him, and sup-

ever attempted to introduce.  
  
4th—The burdensome duties of positive

as asystem of morality for regulating the con-

ing and extraordinary feature of its character in  
this respect, is its tendency and exhortations to  
perfection. The language of Christ to His dis-  
ciples is explicit: “*Be ve therefore perfect,  
even as your Father in Heaven is perfect”—and  
this he enjoins at the conclusion of that precept,  
so expressly laid down, and so unanswerably  
argued, to ‘love their enemies, to bless those  
who cursed them, and pray for those who de-  
spitefully used and persecuted them.” He  
seems to consider the temper of benevolence in  
return for injury, as constituting of itself a per-  
fection similar to that of the Divine Nature. It  
is undoubtedly the greatest conquest which the  
spirit of man can achieve over its infirmities;  
and to him who can attain that elevation of vir-  
tue which it requires, all other victories over  
the evil passions must be comparatively easy.  
Nor was this absolute perfection merely  
preached by Christ as a doctrine; it was prac-  
ticed by Himself throughout His life ; practiced  
to the last instant of His agony on the ross ;  
practiced under circumstances of trial, such as  
no other human being was ever exposedto. He

The imperfections of the Mosiac institutions  
which it was the object of Christ&#x27;s mission,  
upon earth to remove, appear to me to have  
been these, 181--The want of a suffcient sanc  
tion. The rewards and penalties of the Leviti-  
cal law had all a reference to the present life.  
There are many passages in the Old Testament  
which imply a state of existence after death,  
and some which directly assert a future state  
of retribution; but none of these were contain  
ed in the delivery of the law. At the time of  
Christ&#x27;s advent, it was so far from being a set  
tled article of the Jewish faith, that it was a  
subject of bitter controversy between the two  
principal sects- of Pharisees who believed in,  
and Sadducees who denied it. It was the spe  
cial purpose of Christ&#x27;s appearance upon earth  
to bring immortality to light. &quot;He substitu­  
ted the rewards and punishments of a future  
state of existence in the room of all others.  
The Jewish sanctions were exclusively tempo  
ral; those of Christ exclusively spiritual. 2d  
The want of universality. The Jewish dispen  
sation was exclusively confined to a small and  
obscure nation. The purposes of the Supreme  
Creator in restricting the knowlege of himself  
to one petty herd of Egyptian slaves, are as in  
accessible to our intelligence as those of his  
having concealed from them, and the rest of  
mankind, the certain knowledge of their own  
immortality; yet the fact is upquestionable.  
  
I he mnission of Unrist was intended t0 comin  
nicate to the whole human race all the perma  
nent advantages of the Mosaic law, superadd  
ing to them--upon the condition of repent  
ance--the kingdom of Heaven, the blessing of  
cternal iile, od-The complexlty of the on  
jects of legislation. I have observed in a for  
mer letter, that the law of Sinia comprised, not  
only all ordinary subjects of regulation for hu  
man societies, but all those which human le  
gislators cannot reach. It was a civil law, a  
municipal law, an ecclesiastical law, a law of  
police, and a law of morality and religion: it  
prohibited murder, adultery, theft and perjury;  
it prescribed rules for the thoughts as well as  
for the actions of men. The complexity, how  
ever practicable and even suitable for one small  
national society, could not have attained to all  
the families of the earth. The parts of the  
Jewish Law adapted to promote the happiness  
of mankind, under every variety of situation  
and government to which they can be placed,  
wefe all recognized and adopted by Christ; and  
aao e  
He expressly separated them from the rest. He  
disclaimed all interference with the ordinary  
objects of human legislation, He declared that  
 a   eoo  
mis Ningdom was not of this world, He ac­  
knowledged the authority of the Jewish magis­  
trates; He paid for His own person the tribute  
of the Romans; He refused in more than one  
instance to assume the office of Judge in mat­  
ters of legal controversy; He strictly limited  
the object of hiis own precepts and authority  
to religion and morals; He denounced no tem  
poral punishment; He promised no temporal  
reward; He took up Man as a governable being,  
where the human magistrate is compelled to  
leave him, and supplied both precept of virtue  
and motive for practicing it, such as no other  
moralist or legislator ever attempted to intro­  
duce. 4th- The burdensome duties of posi­  
tive rights, minute formalitice and expensive  
sacrifices. All these had a tendency, not only  
to establish and maintain the separation of the  
Jews from all other nations, but in process of  
time had been mistaken by the Scribes and  
Pharisees and Lawyers, and probably the body  
of the people, for the substance of religion.  
All the rites were abolished by Christ, or (as  
Paul expresses it) &quot;were nailed to His Cross.&quot;  
You will recollect that I am now speaking of  
Christianity, not as the scheme of redemption  
to mankind from the consequences of original  
ee  e o e  ee eeee eeeoeeeo  
sin, but as a system of morality for regulating  
the conduct of any man while on earth; and  
the most striking snd extraordinary feature of  
its character in this respect is its tendency and  
exortations to absolute perfection. The lan­  
guage of Christ to His disciples is explicit:  
&quot;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father  
in Heaven is perfect&quot; and this he enjoins at  
the conclusion of that precept, so expressly laid  
down, and so unanswerably argued, to &quot;love  
their enemies, to bless those that curse them,  
and pray for those who despitefully used and  
persecuted them.&quot; He seems to consider the  
temper of benevolence in return for injury, as  
constituting of itself a perfection similar to that  
of Divine nature. It is undoubtedly the great­  
est conquest which the spirit of man can  
achieve over its infirmities; and to him who  
can attain that elevation of virtue which it re­  
quires, all other victories over the evil passions  
must be comparatively easy. Nor was the ab  
solute perfection merely preached by Christ as  
a doctrine; it was practised by Himself through  
out His life; practised to the last instant of  
His agony on the Cross; practised under cir­  
cumstances of trial, such as no other human  
being was ever exposed to. He proved by His  
own example the possibility of that virtue  
which he taught; and although possessed of  
miraculous powers sufficient to control all the  
laws of Nature, He expressly and repeatedly  
declined the use of them to save Himself from  
any part of the sufferings which He was able  
to endure.  
The sum of Chiistian Morality, then consists  
in piety to God, and benevolence to Man; pi­  
ety manifested not by formal rites and sacrifi­  
ces of burnt-offerings, but by repentance, by  
obedience, by submission, by humanity, by the  
worship of the heart, and by benevolence; not  
founded upon selfish motives, but superior to  
even a sense of wrong; or the resentment of  
injuries. Worldly prudence is scarcely notic­  
ed among all the institutions of Christ; the  
pursuit of honor and riches, the objects of am­  
bition and avarice are strongly discountenanc­  
ed in many places; and an undue solicitude  
about the ordinary cares of life is occasionally  
reproved. Of worldly prudence, there are  
rules enough in the Proverbs of Solomon, and  
in the compilations of the son of Sirach; Christ  
passed no censure upon them, but He&quot; left  
what I call the selfish virtues where he found  
them. It was not to proclaim the common  
place morality that He came down from Hea­  
ven; His commands were new; that His disci­  
ples should &quot;love one another,&quot; that they should  
love even strangers, that they should &quot;love their  
enemies.&quot; He prescribed barriers against all  
the malefficient passions; He gave as a law,  
the utmost point of perfection of which human  
powers are susceptible, and at the same time  
allowed degrees of indulgence and relaxation  
to human frailty, proportioned to the power  
of any individual. An eminent writer in sup­  
port of Christianity, (Dr. Paley,) expresses the  
opinion, that the direct object of the Christian  
revelation was to supply motives and not rules  
sanctions and not precepts; and he strongly  
intimates that, independence of the purpose of  
Christ&#x27;s atonement and propitiation for the  
sins of the world, the only object of his mis­  
sion upon carth was to reveal a future state,  
  
&quot;to bring life and immortality to light.&quot; He  
does not anpear to think that Christ promul  
  
gated any new principle of morality; and he  
positively asserts that &quot;morality, neathes th  
Gospel nor inany other book can be a subject  
of discovery, beeause qualities of actions de  
pend entirely on their effects, most att atons  
have been the subjects of human experience.  
To this I reply in the express words of Jesus;  
Anetn command have a given you, that ye  
love one another;&quot; and I add, that this com­  
mand explained, illustrated and dilated, as it  
was by the whole tenor of his discourses, and  
especially by the parable of the good Samaritan  
appears to me to be not entirely new, but, in  
the most rigorous sense of the word, a discov­  
ery in morals; and a discovery, the importance  
of which to the happiness of the human race,  
eeee o o e o e eee  
far exceeds any discovery in the physical laws  
of Nature, as the soul is superior to the body.  
If it be objected that the principles of benevo-  
 a  oi ee e o  
lence toward enemies, and the lorgiveness of  
injuries, may be formed not only in the Old  
Testament, but even in some of the heathen  
writers, particularly the discourses of Socrates,  
I answer, that the same may be said of the im­  
mortality of the soul, and of the rewards and  
punishments of a future state. The doctrine  
was not more a discovery than the precept;  
but their connexion with each other, the au  
thority with which they were taught, and the  
miracles by which they were enforced belong  
exclusively to the mission of Christ. Attend  
particularly to the miracle recorded in the sec  
ond chapter of Luke, as having taken place at  
the birth of Jesns; when the angel of the Lord  
said to the Shepherds: &quot;Fear not, for behold I  
bring you glad tidings of great joy, which  
shall be to all people; for unto you is born this  
day in the city of David, a Savior, who is sesus  
Christ the Lord.&quot; In these words the charac  
ter of Jesus as a Redeemer, was announced; but  
the historian adds--&quot;And suddenly there was  
with the angel a multitude of the heavenly  
host praising God, and singing, Glory to God  
in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will  
toward men.&quot; These words, as I understand  
them, announced the moral precept of benevo­  
lence as explicitly for the object of Christ&#x27;s ap­  
pearance, as the preceding words had declared  
the purpose of redemption. It is related in the  
life of the Roman dramatic Poet, Therence,  
that when one of the personages of his come-  
dy the &quot;SelfTormentor, the first time utter­  
ed on the stage the line &quot;Homo suru, humani  
nil alienum puto.&quot; (I am a man, nothing hu  
man is uninteresting to me,) a universal shout  
of applause burst forth from the whole auni  
ence, and that in so great a multitude of Ro  
mans, and deputies from the nations, their suh­  
jects and allies, there was not one individual  
but felt in his heart the noble sentiment. Yet  
how feeble and defective it is, in comparison  
with the Christian command of Charity as un­  
folded in the discoveries of Christ and enlarg­  
ed upon in the writings of His apostles. The  
heart of man will always respond with rap­  
ture to this sentiment when there is no selfish  
or unsocial passion to oppose it; but the com­  
mand to lay it down as the great and funda­  
mental rule of conduct for human life, and to  
subdue and sacrifice all the tyrannical and sel­  
fish passions to preserve it, this is the pecull­  
ar and unfading glory of Christianity; this is  
the conquest over ourselves, which without  
the aid of a merciful God, none of us can  
achieve, and which it was worthy of His spe­  
cial interposition to enable us to aecomplish.

He left what I call ; the selfish virtues wheri  
He found them. It was not to proclaim common­

&quot;love one another.&quot; that , the v . &#x27; should love even

He prescribed barriers against all the maleficient  
passions j He gave as a law, the utmost point of  
periection of which human powers are susceptible,  
and at the same time allowed degrees of indulgence  
and relaxation to ? human frailty, proportioned -to  
the, power of any individual.. y if&#x27;j&amp;?iJI  
An eminent writer in support 1 of Christianity,  
(Dr. Paley,) expresses the opinion! that the direct  
object of the christiah.ievelation T. was to . supply  
motive find riot tdessdnctions, and not pre­  
cepts ; . and he strongly intimates that, independ­  
ent of the purpose, of ChristV atonement and pro-&#x27;  
piiuiiion lor me sms oi tne worjp, tne oniy ODjecc  
of His mission upon earth was to reveal &#x27; a ! future  
state, to bring life &quot;and immortality to light.&quot;  
He does not appear to think that Christ promulga­  
ted any new principle of morality and he &#x27; posii  
lively asserts that M morality, neither in the gosj  
pel nor in any other book can be a subject&#x27; tf dis-  
covery, because qualities of act ions depend en­  
tirely on their &#x27;eflectsj which effects must all &#x27; a­  
long have been the subjects of human experience.&quot;  
To this I reply in the express, words of. Jesus:  
a A new commandment I give ybu that ye love  
one another ;&quot; and I add, that this command ex-,  
piained, illustrated, and &#x27;dilated, las it was by the  
whole tenor of His discourses,5 and especially by  
the parable of the good Samaritan, appears to me  
to be not only entirely new, butin the most rig  
orous sense of the word, a discovery in morals j  
and a discovery,&#x27; the importance of which to the  
happiness of the human race, as far exceeds any  
discovery in the&#x27; physical laws&#x27;of Nature, as the  
soul is superior to the body. ; ff it be objected  
mat me principles or oenevoience; towaras ene­  
mies, and the forgiveness of injuries may be found  
not only in; the&#x27; Old Testament, but even&quot; in some of  
the heathen writersj particularly the discourses of  
Socrates, I answer, that the same may be said of  
the immortality of the soul, and of the rewards  
and punishments of a future state.&quot; The doctrine  
was not more a discovery than the &quot; precept : but  
their connexion- with each - other the authority  
with which they are taught, and the miracles by  
which they were enforced beloriof exclusively to  
the mission of (rist&#x27; r Attend particularly to the  
miracle recorded irt the second chapter of .&#x27; Luke,  
a3 havion taken place at the birth of Jesus when  
the angel of the Lord said to the shepherds :  
&quot; Fear not, for behold I bring you glad tidings of  
greai joy; wnicn snail oe io an peopiej tor onto  
you is born this day in the city of David, a . Sa  
vior who is Christ the Lord.&quot; In - these: words  
the character of Jesus, as a Redeemer, was an­  
nounced ; but the historian adds---&quot; And sudden,  
ly there was with the angel a multitude of the  
heavenly host praising God and singing, Glory&#x27; to  
hod m the. highest,: and on earth peace, good will  
toward men&quot;, j .These words as I understand  
them, announced the mora) precept of benevolence  
as explicitly for the object of Christ s appearance,  
as the preceeding words had declared the purpose  
ot redemption. It is related in the life of the Ro  
ma n d ra malic Poet, Terence, that ; when one of  
the personages of his comedy, the.Self Tormen­  
tor,&quot; the first time uttered on the stage the line  
f Homo sum, humani nil alienum puto,&quot; (I am a  
man, nothing&#x27;hutnan is uninteresting to me,) a  
universal shout of applause burst; forth from the  
whole audience, and that in so great a multitude  
of Romans, and deputies from the nations, their  
subjects and allies, there was not one individual  
but felt in his heart this noble sentiment. Yet  
how feeble and defective it is, in comparison with  
the christian command of Charity as unfolded in  
the writings of his apostles. The heart of man  
willahvay8 respond with rapture to. this Eenli­  
ment when there is no selfish or unsocial passion  
to oppose it i- but the command to lay it down as  
the great and fundamental , rub cf conduct for hu­  
man life, and to subdue and sacifice all the tyr  
ranical end selfish passions to preserve it, this is  
the peculiar and unfading glory cf Christianity ;  
this is the conquest over ourselves, which without  
the aid of a merciful God, none cf us can achieve,  
and which it was worthy of His &#x27;special interposi­  
tion to enable us to accomplish. V ; - ,

The imperfection of the Mosaic institutions   
which it was the object of Christ&#x27;s mission   
upon earth to remove, appear to me to have   
been these : 1. The wan! of a sufficient sanc­  
tion. The rewards and penalties of the Le­  
vitical law had all a reference to the present   
lite. There are many passages in the Old   
Testament -which imply a state of existence   
after death, and some which directly assets   
a future state of retribution ; but none of these   
were contained in the delivery of the Law.   
At the time of Christ&#x27;s advent, it was so far   
from being a settled article of the Jewish   
fah, that it was a subject of bitter controver­  
sy between the two principal sects—of Phu=   
isees, who believed in, and Sadducees, who   
denied it. It was the special pqrpose M   
Christ&#x27;s appearing on earth to bring immor­  
tality to light. He substituted the rewards   
ami punishments of a future state of existence   
in the room of all others. The JewiSh sanc­  
tions were exclusively temporal those of   
Christ exclusively spiritual.   
2. The want of universality. The JeWish   
dispensation was exclusively confined to a   
small and obscure nation&#x27;. The purposes&#x27;of   
the Supreme Creator in restriction the knowl­  
edge of himself to .one petty herd of Egyp­  
tian slaves, are as inaccessible to our intel­  
ligence as thoge of his having concealed from   
them, and from the rest of mankind, the per,   
fain knowledge of their own immortalityr--  
yet the fact is unquestionable:. • Trifi&#x27;missiori   
of Christ was intended to communicate to.   
the whole human race all the pejmanent ad,   
r   
vantages of the 14. al&amp; Law, syperadding to   
them—upon the condition of repentance—

most striking, end extraortlionry fearute of its &#x27;   
character in this respect, is its tendency and   
exhortations to absOlute perfection. The len­  
.guagi3 of Christ to His disciples is explicit :  
‘,lle ye therefore perfect, even as your Fath­  
er in Heaven is perfects&#x27;—and this lie enjoins   
at the conclusion of that precept, so express­  
ly faid.doWn, and so unanswerably argited,   
to &quot; lave their enemies, to bless those who   
cursed -them and pray for those who des­  
piiefully use&#x27;d&#x27; and persecuted them..&quot; He   
seems to consider the temper of benevo­  
lence in return far injury, as constituting el   
itself- a perfectionsirriilaijo that of Divine   
Nature. It is undoubtedly the greatest eon.&#x27;   
quest which the spirit of man can achieve   
over. its- infirmities; and to him even who,   
can attain that elevation or virtue which it   
reeufres, all other victories over the evil pas­  
sions must be comparatively- easy. Nor   
was she &#x27;absOlute perfection merely preached.   
by. Christ as a doctrine; it was practicer! by   
Himself threughent flis life ; practiced to the   
latest ir.stant of His agony on the Cross,

astir, ethe,r human being -was ever exposed

possibility of that Virtue which He taught;   
and although possessed of miraculous pow­  
ers,sutVicient to control all the laws of Na­  
ture, lie expressly and repeatedly declined   
the Ilse of them to save Himself from any

The Sum of Christian Morality, then con­  
sists in piety to God, and benevolence to   
.Klan; piety, manifested not by formal solemn   
rites and, sacrifices of burnt offerings, but by   
rerientani3e; obedience-, bysubmission,ty hit;   
mility, by the worship of the head. and by   
benevolence, not founded upon selfish mo­  
tives but superior even to a sense of wrong,   
or the resentinCnt of injuries. Worldly pru­  
dence is scarcely noticed among all&#x27; the in­  
stitutons of Christ; the pursuit of honors and   
tiches, the objects of ambition and avarice,   
are Stioirgly discountenanced in mailyAlla­  
ces- and au undue solicitude about the ordi­  
nary caies,of life is occasionally reproved,-  
0! worldly prudence them are rules enough   
in the Proverbs of ti,oloinort, and in thecom­  
pilations of the son of •Sivach; Christ passes   
no console upon them, but lie left what ! call   
the selfish virtues, where He found them.   
It wasricit to proclaim common:place moral­  
by -that lie came Alow.r. (rota Heaven; His   
commands avers new; that his clfileirdes   
should ever &#x27;&#x27;love one anothei.,,hat they

&quot;litre their mernies.&quot; Fla prescribed bat­  
riers against all the Maleficient -passions ;

tion of which liquati powers are susceptible,.   
mud-at time alliiited&quot; Itegiefirtf   
indulgence mid relaxation to human_   
proportioned to the power of any individual.   
Au eminent writer in support of. Christianity,   
(I tr. Paley) expresses the opinion, that the   
direct object of the Christian revelation was   
to supply inu&#x27;ives sod not rules—sanctions,   
and list precepts: and lie strongly intimates   
that, independent of the put pose of Christ&#x27;s   
atonement and propitiation lor the sins of   
the world, the&#x27; only object of his ltnission   
upon earth was to reveal a future state-,—&quot;ter­  
bring life and irmnottality.&#x27; iffe does not ap­  
peal to think that Christ promulgated any   
new principle of morality: and he positively   
asserts that &quot;morality, neither in the Gospel   
nor in any other book can be a subject of   
discovery, bet:omit, qualities of actions de­  
pend entirely oti their effects, &#x27;,s bleb effects,   
all alougMlist have been tho subjects of hu­  
man experienceA&#x27;—To this I reply in the   
express words of Jesus: &#x27;‘A.new command-  
Ment 1 give you, ihat ye love one ailed&#x27;   
er;&quot; and I add that this command, explained,&#x27;   
illustrated and dilated,. as it was by the   
whole tenor of Ills discourses, and especial­  
ly by the parable of the good Samaritan,   
appears to nie to be not only entirely new   
but, in the most rigorous saute of the word,   
a discovery in motels; and a discovery, the   
importance at which to the happiness of the   
human race, as tar exceeds any discovery in   
the physical laws of Nature, as tho soul is su­  
perior to the body.   
If it be objected that the ptineiples of bb­  
nevolenee toward enemies, and the feritive­  
nese of injuries, may be found not only ui   
the Old Testament, but oven in some of the   
  
heathen writers, particulaily the discourses   
of Socrate., I answer, that the seine may be   
said of Pie immortatity of the soul, and the   
rewards and punisninenta el a fu►urp state.—  
&#x27;he doctrine was not more a discpvery than   
  
the precept, but their connection with each   
other, he authority with which they were   
taught, and the miracles l.ty wriigh ley were   
enforced belong exclusively •to OP Mies

no other human being was ever exposed
