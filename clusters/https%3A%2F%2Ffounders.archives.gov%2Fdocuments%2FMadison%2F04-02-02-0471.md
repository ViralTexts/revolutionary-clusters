I observe with particular pleasure the view you have taken of the immunity of Religion from Civil Jurisdiction, in every case where it does not trespass on private rights or the public peace. This has always been a favorite point with me: and it was not with my approbation, that the deviation from it took place in Congress when they appointed Chaplains to be paid from the national Treasury. It would have been a much better proof to their Constituents of their pious feelings, if the members had contributed for the purpose, a pittance from their own pockets. As the precedent is

as a Legislative topic, to its broadest principle.  
Notwithstanding the general progress made within the two last Centuries in favor of this branch of liberty, and the full establishment of it, in some parts of our Country, there remains in others, a strong bias towards the old error, that without some sort of alliance or coalition between Government &amp; Religion, neither can be duly supported. Such indeed is the tendency to such a Coalition, and such its corrupting influence on both the parties, that the danger can not be too carefully guarded against. And in a Government of opinion, like ours, the only effectual guard must be found in the soundness &amp; stability of the general opinion on the subject. Every new &amp; successful example therefore of a perfect separation between ecclesiastical &amp; Civil matters is of importance. And I have no doubt that every

ast one has done, in shewing that Religion &amp; Govt. will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together. It was the belief of all Sects at one time that the establishment of Religion by law was right &amp; necessary; that the true Religion ought to be established in exclusion of all others; and that the only question to be decided was, which was the true Religion. The example of Holland proved that a toleration of Sects dissenting from the established Sect, was safe and even useful. The example of the Colonies now States, which rejected Religious establishments altogether, proved that all Sects might be safely &amp; advantageously put on a footing of equal &amp; entire freedom. And a continuance of their example since the Declaration of Independence has shewn, that its success in Colonies was not to be ascribed to their connection with the parent Country. If a further confirmation of the truth could be wanted, it is to be found in the examples furnished by the States which have abolished their religious Establishments. I can not speak particularly of any of the cases excepting that of Virginia, where it is impossible to deny that Religion prevails with more zeal, and a more exemplary priesthood, than it ever did when established and patronized by Public authority. We are teaching the World the great truth, that Governments do better without Kings &amp; Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson, that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Government.

gress. It was his conviction that religion was the gainer by  
its separation from politics. We have an interesting testi-  
mony to this effect from his pen in a letter to Edward  
Livingston, dated Montpellier, July 10, 1822. ‘“ It was the  
belief of all sects at one time,” he says, “ that the establish-  
ment of religion by law was right and necessary; that the  
true religion ought to be established in exclusion of every  
other; and that the only question to be decided was, which  
was the true religion. The example of Holland proved that  
a toleration of sects dissenting from the established sect was  
safe, and even useful. The example of the colonies, now  
States, which rejected religious establishments altogether,  
proved that all sects might be safely and advantageously  
put on a footing of equal and entire freedom. . . . It is  
impossible to deny that in Virginia religion prevails with  
more zeal and a more exemplary priesthood than it ever did  
when established and patronized by public authority. We  
are teaching the world the great truth that governments  
do better without kings and nobles than with them. The  
merit will be doubled by the other lesson: that religion
