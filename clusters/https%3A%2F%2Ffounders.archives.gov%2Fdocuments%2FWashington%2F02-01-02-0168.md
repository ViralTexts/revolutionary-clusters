]  
To The Honble Robt Dinwiddie Esqr.WilliamsburghHonble Sir  
  
As I am favourd with an oppertunity, I shoud think myself inexcusable, was I to omit givg you some acct of our late Engagemt with the French on the Monongahela the 9th Inst.  
We continued our March from Fort Cumberland to Frazer’s (which is within 7 Miles of Duquisne) witht meetg with any extraordinary event, havg only a stragler or two picked Up by the French Indians. When we came to this place, we were attackd, (very unexpectedly I must own) by abt 300 French and Indns; Our number’s consisted of abt 1300 well armd Men, chiefly regular’s, who were immediately struck with such a deadly an inconceivable Panick, that nothing but confusion and disobedience of order’s prevaild amongst them: The Officer’s in genl behavd with incomparable bravery, for which they greatly sufferd, there being near 60 killd and woundd A large Proportion out of the number we had! The Virginians Companies behavd like Men, and died like Soldier’s; for I believe out of 3 Companys that were there on the ground that Day, scarce 30 were left alive: Captn Peyrouny and all his Officer’s down to a Corporal, were killd; Captn Polson shard almost as hard a Fate, for only one of his Escap’d: In short the dastardly behaviour of the English Soldier’s Regular Troops exposd all those who were inclin’d to do their duty, to almost certai⟨n⟩ Death; and at length, in despight of every effort to the contrary, broke &amp; run as Sheep before the Hounds, leavg the Artillery, Ammunition, Provision, and every individual s Baggage &amp; in short every thing we had with us a prey to the Enemy; and when we endeavourd to rally them in hopes of regaining our invaluable loss, the ground and what we had left upon it it was with as much little success as if we had attempted to have stopd the wild Bears of  
  
the Mountains. or rivulets with our feet, for they wd break by in spite of every effort that could be made to prevent it.  
The Genl was wounded behind in  the Shoulder, &amp; into the Breast; of wch he died three days after; his two Aids de Camp were both wounded, but are in a fair way of Recovering; Colo. Burton and Sir Jno. St Clair are also wounded, and I hope will get over it; Sir Peter Halket, with many other brave Officers were killd in the Field: I luckily escapd witht a wound, tho I had four Bullets through my Coat and two Horses shot under me: It is supposed that we left had 300 or more dead in the Field killed; abt that number we brought off wounded; and it is imagin’d conjectured (I believe with great justice too much truth) that two thirds of both those number’s receiv’d their shott from our own cowardly dogs of Soldier’s Regulars, who gatherd themselves into a body contrary to orders 10 or 12 deep, woud then level, Fire, &amp; shoot down the Men before them.  
I Tremble at the consequences that this defeat may have upon our back setlers, who I suppose will all leave their habitation’s unless their are proper measures taken for their security.  
Colo. Dunbar, who commands at present, intends so as soon as his Men are recruited at this place, to continue his March to Philia into for Winter Quarter’s; so that consequently there will be no Men left here unless it is the poor shattered remains of the Virginia Troops; who now are, &amp; will be too small to guard our are totally inadequate to the protection of the Frontiers. As Captn Orme is writg to yr honour I doubt not but he will give you a circumstantial acct of all things, which will make it needless for me to add more than that I am Honble Sir Yr most Obt &amp; most Hble Servt

unexpectedly) by about three hundred French  
and Indians. Our numbers consisted of  
about thirteen hundred well-armed men,  
chiefly regulars, who were immediately struck  
with such an inconceivable panic, that noth­

prevailed amongthem. The officers in gener­  
al behaved with incomparable bravery, for  
which they greatly suffered; there being near­

Honorable Sir :—As I am favored

Fort Cumberland to Frazer’s (which

men, chiefly regulars, who wore  
immediately struck with such an

officers iu general behaved with  
incomparable bravery, for which  
they greatly suffered ; there being  
.nearly sixty killed and wounded, a  
lurge proportion out of tbe number  
we bad.  
The Virginia companies behaved  
like men and died liko soldiers ; for,  
I believe, out of the three companies  
that were on tho ground that day,  
scarce thirty were left alive. Capt

In short, the dastardly behavior of  
tbo regular troops (so called) exposed  
those who were inclined to do their  
duly to almost certain death ; and at  
length, in spite of every effort to the  
contrary, (they) broke und ran as

baggage, and in short, everything, a  
prey to the enemy ; and when we  
endeavored to rally them in hopes of  
regaining tho ground and what wo  
had left upon it, it was with as little  
success as if wo bail attempted to  
have stopped tho wild bears of the  
mountains or rivulets with our feet;  
for they would break by in spito of  
every’ effort that could be mado to  
prevent it.  
Tho General was wounded in tho

died tkreo days after ; his two aides­

Barton and Sir John St Clair are

that two-thirds of both received

Honorable Hut:—As I am favored  
with an opportunity, I should think  
myself inexcusable was I to omit go ing  
you some account of our late engage­  
ment with the French on the Mouon­  
gahelu, the sth inst.  
Wo continued our march from Fort  
Cumberland to Frazer’s (which is w ith­  
in seven miles of Du Qtiesue), without  
meeting any extraordinary event, hav­  
ing only a straggler or two picked up  
by the French Indians. When wo  
came to this place we were attacked  
(very unexpectedly) by about three  
hundred French and Indians. Our  
numbers consisted of about thirteen  
hundred well-armed men, chiefly regu­  
lars, who were immediately struck with  
such an inconceivable panic, that noth­  
ing but confusion and disobedience of  
orders prevailed among them. The  
officers in general behaved with incom­  
parable bravery, for which they greatly  
suffered; there being nearly sixty  
killed and wounded, a large proportion  
out of the number we had.  
  
The Virginia companies behaved like ,  
men and died like soldiers; for, [ be­  
lieve, out of the three companies that  
were on the ground that day, scarce  
thirty were left alive. Captain Pev­  
roune and ull his officers down to a  
corporal were killed. Captain Poison  
had almost as hard a fate, for only one  
of his escaped.  
In short, the dastardly behavior of  
the regular troops (so called) exposed  
those who were inclined to do their  
duty to almost certain death; ami at  
length, in spite of every effort to the  
contrary, (they) broke and ran as sheep  
before hounds, leaving the artillery,  
ammunition, provisions, baggage, and,  
in short, everything, a prey to the en­  
emy ; and when we endeavored to rally  
them in hopes of regaining the ground  
and what we had left upon it, it was  
with as little success as if we had at­  
tempted to have stopped the wild bears  
of the mountains or rivulets with our  
feet ; for they would break by in spite  
of every effort that could be made to  
prevent it.  
The General was wounded in the  
shoulder and breast, of which he dh and  
three days after ; his two aides-de-camp  
were both wounded, but are in a fair  
way of recovering. Col. Barton and  
Sir John St. Clair are also wounded,  
and I hope will get over it. Sir Peter  
Ilulket, with many other brave officers,  
were killed in the field. It is supposed  
that ve had three hnndrt and or move  
killed; about that number we brought  
off wounded ; and it is conjectured (1  
believe with much truth) that two­  
thirds of both receiw and their shot from  
our own cowardly regular.!,* who gath  
ered themselves into a body, contrary  
lo orders, ten or twelve deep; would  
then lire and shoot down the men be­  
fore them.  
I tremble at the consequence that  
this defeat may have upon our back  
settlers, who, I suppose, will all leave  
their habitations, mile.- x there are  
proper measures taken for their s.-  
curity.  
Col. Dunbar, who commands at pres­  
ent, intends, as &#x27; bi n n a  
united at this place, to continue hG  
march to Philadelphia tbr winter quar­  
ters : consequently there will be no  
men left here, unless it i&gt; the si;altered  
remains of the Virginia troops, who  
are totally inadequate to the protection  
i of the frontier*.  
As Capt. Gone is writing to you,  
however, I doubt not bn that lie wiil  
I give you a circumstantial account of  
! all things; which xvill make it needless  
j for me to add more than that 1 am,

To THE Hon. RoBEeRT DINWIDDIE, EsqQ., Williamsburg.  
  
Fort CUMBERLAND, July 18, 1755.  
  
HONORABLE S1rR,—As I am favored with an opportunity, I should  
think myself inexcusable was I to omit giving you some account of our  
late engagement with the French on the Monongahela, the 9th inst.  
  
We continued our march from Fort Cumberland to Frazer’s (which is  
within seven miles of Du Quesne) without meeting any extraordinary  
event, having only a straggler or two picked up by the French Indians,  
When we came to this place we were attacked (very unexpectedly)  
by about three hundred French and Indians. Our numbers consisted of  
about thirteen hundred well-armed men, chiefly regulars, who were im-  
mediately struck with such an inconceivable panic that nothing but con-  
fusion and disobedience of orders prevailed among them. The officers in  
  
eneral behaved with incomparable bravery, for which they greatly suf-  
ered ; there being near sixty killed and wounded, a large proportion out  
of the number we had.  
  
The Virginia companies behaved like men and died like soldiers;  
for, I believe, out of three companies that were on the ground that day,  
scarce thirty were left alive. Captain Peyroune and all his officers down  
to a corporal were killed. Captain Polson had almost as hard a fate, for  
only one of his escaped.  
  
In short the dastardly behavior of the regular troops (so called) ex-  
posed those who were inclined to do their duty to almost certain death ;  
and at length, in spite of every effort to the contrary, [they] broke and  
ran as sheep before hounds, leaving the artillery, ammunition, provisions,  
baggage, and in short every thing, a prey to the enemy, and when we  
endeavored to rally them in hopes of regaining the ground and what  
we had left upon it, it was with as little success as if we had attempted  
to have stopped the wild bears of the mountains, or rivulets with our  
feet; for they would break by in despite of every effort that could be  
made to prevent it.  
  
The General was wounded in the shoulder and breast, of which he  
died three days after; his two aides-de-camp were both wounded, but are  
in a fair way of recovering. Colonel Barton and Sir John St. Clair are  
also wounded, and I hope will get overit. Sir Peter Halket, with many  
other brave officers, were killed in the field. It is supposed that we  
had three hundred or more killed: about that number we brought off  
wounded ; and it is conjectured (I believe with much truth) that two-  
thirds of both received their shot from our own cowardly regulars, who  
gethered themselves into a body, contrary to orders, ten or twelve deep ;  
would then fire and shoot down the men before them.  
  
I tremble at the consequence that this defeat may have upon our back  
settlers, who, I suppose, will all leave their habitations, unless there are  
proper measures taken for their security.  
  
Colonel Dunbar, who commands at present, intends, as soon as his men  
are reunited at this place, to continue his march to Philadelphia for win-  
ter quarters: consequently there will be no men left here, unless it is the  
shattered remains of the Virginia troops, who are totally inadequate to  
the protection of the frontiers.
