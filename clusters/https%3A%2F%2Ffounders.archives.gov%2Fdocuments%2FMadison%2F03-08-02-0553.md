Resolved  
That in order to counteract the baneful effects of the many false and malignant reports daily circulated by evil minded persons, Such as “that our Armies are destitute of proper food or Cloathing, Arms and ammunition” we shall use all our endeavours to detect and expose to public Scorn the authors and propagators of Such false reports which are only calculated to alarm and distress the wives and families of our fellow Soldiers who are gone forth to fight the Battles of our Country—  
Resolved  
That in our opinion “to Struggle in a Just cause and for our Countrys Safety is the best office of the sons of men, and to decline it when the motive urges, is infamy beneath a cowards baseness;” We therefore view the conduct of the militia, who refused to cross the river during the late battle of Queenstown as not only disgraceful and cowardly but derogatory of the American character and Justly meriting the reprobation of all good Citizens,
