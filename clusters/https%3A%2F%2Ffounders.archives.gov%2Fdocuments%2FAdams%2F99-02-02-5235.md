Republicans who reserve to themselves Such a Trust as is implied, in the multiplied Elections of this Country, ought to be very attentive to their own Motives, and examine their own hearts, in order to be sure, that under a pretext of Republican Jealousy, they do not conceal, Ambition Avarice Envy, Revenge Resentment, hatred or any other Sinister Passion or Interest.  
I shall not charge Mr Pickering with any intentional deception in any part of his Letter: but in Stating the Papers laid by the President before Congress as the Grounds of the Embargo, he has given So partial a description of one of them, as might have a tendency to deceive many and I doubt not has deceived thousands of his Readers. I mean the Proclamation of the King of Great Britain. Mr Pickering calls it “The Proclamation of the King of Great Britain, requiring the Return of his Subjects, the Seamen especially from foreign Countries, to Aid, in this hour of peculiar danger in the defence of their Country.” But this is concealing the Asp in a Basket of Figgs. The dangerous, alarming and fatal Part of the Proclamation is kept carefully out of Sight.  
Proclamations of this kind though perhaps of immemorial Usage in the Beginnings of Wars, are in Substance and Effect, Simple Invitations to natural born Britons who happen to be abroad to return home. Today the Right of the King to issue them, would be as absurd as to deny his right to Send a Card of Compliment to any of his Subjects to dine with him on St. George’s day. As it is natural to every human Mind to Sympathize with its native Country, when in danger and distress, it is well known that considerable numbers of British Subjects commonly return home from various foreign Countries

Mr Pickering Says it is an acknowledged Principle, that every Nation has a Right to the Service of its Subjects in time of War.—By whom is this Principle acknowledged?—By no Man, I believe, in the unlimited Sense, in which it is here asserted.—With certain qualifications and restrictions it may be admitted. Within the Realm and in his own Dominions The King has a Right to the Service of his Subjects by voluntary Inlistments by Sea and Land, and to Send them abroad upon foreign Voyages and Expeditions: but it would be difficult to prove the Right of any Sovereign of a free People to compell

rfeit foisted into that Law by this arbitrary fraud, an Interpolation into that Law with a Vengeance. Such a Title as “Impressment of Seamen,” was never found in any Code of Laws since the first Canoe was launched into the Sea; not even in that of England. Whoever Claims a Right must produce a Law to Support it. But this Proclamation attempts to transfer the pretended Right, of impressing Seamen from their own Ships which in truth is only an enormous Abuse, of to the Impressment of Seamen over from foreign Nations, foreign Ships and foreign Subjects. The horror of this gross Attempt; this affront to our Understandings as well as Feelings; this contempt of our natural and national Resentment of Injuries, as well as of our Sympathies with fellow Creatures and Fellow Citizens, Suffering the vilest oppression under Inhumanity and Cruelty; could

During the Administration of Adams, Mr Pickering knows what Remonstrances and Demands were made, and the Success of them while he was Secretary of State: and Mr Madison can Shew him, in the office of State what Representations were made and what Instructions were given to our Minister in London, while Chief Justice Marshall was Secretary of State; and Mr King can inform him, what Memorials he presented to the British Court, upon this Subject, in conformity to his Instructions. The Instructions and Memorials were drawn in as Strong terms as the English Language could furnish. Mr Pickering himself could not have employed Stronger Sentiments or Expressions; nor could any other Writer without violating that Respect and Decorum, which ought always to be preserved between Nations and Governments, even in Declarations of War. The Practice and the Pretension were represented, not only as incompatible with every Principle of Justice and every feeling of Humanity, but as wholly irreconcile irreconcileable with all thoughts of a Continuance of Peace and Friendship between the two Nations. Mr King can tell the Effect and Success of his Memorial. It was an immediate order to all the Commanders of the Navy, to liberate and discharge, the demanded Men, that is all impressed American Seamen.
