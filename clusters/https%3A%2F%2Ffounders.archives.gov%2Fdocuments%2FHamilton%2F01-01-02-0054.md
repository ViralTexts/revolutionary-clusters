remarks. The only distinction between freedom and slavery consists in this: In the former state, a man is governed by the laws to which he has given his consent, either in person, or by his representative: In the latter, he is governed by the will of another. In the one case his life and property are his own, in the other, they depend upon the pleasure of a master. It is easy to discern which of these two states is preferable. No man in his senses can hesitate in choosing to be free, rather than a slave.  
That Americans are intitled to freedom, is incontestible upon every rational principle. All men have one common original: they participate in one common nature, and consequently have one common right. No reason can be assigned why one man should exercise any power, or pre-eminence over his fellow creatures more than another; unless they have voluntarily vested him with it. Since then, Americans have not by any act of their’s impowered the British Parliament to make laws for them, it follows they can have no just authority to do it.

nd some of the conveniencies of life. The necessaries, and many of the conveniencies, our own fertile and propitious soil affords us.  
No person, that has enjoyed the sweets of liberty, can be insensible of its infinite value, or can reflect on its reverse, without horror and detestation. No person, that is not lost to every generous feeling of humanity, or that is not stupidly blind to his own interest, could bear to offer himself and posterity as victims at the shrine of despotism, in preference to enduring the short lived inconveniencies that may result from an abridgment, or even entire suspension of commerce.  
Were not the disadvantages of slavery too obvious to stand in need of it, I might enumerate and describe the tedious train of calamities, inseparable from it. I might shew that it is fatal to religion and morality; that it tends to debase the mind, and corrupt its noblest springs of action. I might shew, that it relaxes the sinews of industry, clips the wings of commerce, and introduces misery and indigence in every shape.  
Under the auspices of tyranny, the life of the subject is often sported with; and the fruits of his daily toil are consumed in oppressive taxes, that serve to gratify the ambition, avarice and lusts of his superiors. Every court minion riots in the spoils of the honest labourer, and despises the hand by which he is fed. The page of history is replete with instances that loudly warn us to beware of slavery.

. We can live without trade of any kind. Food and clothing we have within ourselves. Our climate produces cotton, wool, flax and hemp, which, with proper cultivation would furnish us with summer apparel in abundance. The article of cotton indeed would do more, it would contribute to defend us from the inclemency of winter. We have sheep, which, with due care in improving and increasing them, would soon yield a sufficiency of wool. The large quantity of skins, we have among us, would never let us want a warm and comfortable suit. It would be no unbecoming employment for our daughters to provide silks of their own country. The silk-worm answers as well here as in any part of the world. Those hands, which may be deprived of business by the cessation of commerce, may be occupied in various kinds of manufactures and other internal improvements. If by the necessity of the thing, manufactures should once be established and take root among us, they will pave the way, still more, to the future grandeur and glory of America, and by lessening its need of external commerce, will render it still securer against the encroachments of tyranny.

We are told, “that it is highly improbable, we shall succeed in distressing the people of Great-Britain, Ireland and the West-Indies, so far as to oblige them to join with us in getting the acts of Parliament, which we complain of, repealed: The first distress (it is said) will fall on ourselves; it will be more severely felt by us, than any part of all his Majesty’s dominions, and will affect us the longest. The fleets of Great-Britain command respect throughout the globe. Her influence extends to every part of the earth. Her manufactures are equal to any: Superior to most in the world. Her wealth is great. Her people enterprizing and persevering in their attempts to extend, and enlarge, and protect her trade. The total loss of our trade will be felt only for a time. Her merchants would turn their attention another way: New sources of trade and wealth would be opened: New schemes pursued. She would soon find a vent for all her manufactures in spite of all we could do. Our malice would hurt only ourselves. Should our schemes distress some branches of her trade, it would be only for a time; and there is ability and humanity enough in the nation to relieve those, that are distressed by us, and put them in some other way of getting their living.”

unheard, unconvicted of any crime.” This may be justice, but it looks so much like cruelty, that a man of a humane heart would be more apt to call it by the latter, than the former name.  
The affair of Canada, if possible, is still worse. The English laws have been superceded by the French laws. The Romish faith is made the established religion of the land, and his Majesty is placed at the head of it. The free exercise of the protestant faith depends upon the pleasure of the Governor and Council. The subject is divested of the right of trial by jury, and an innocent man may be imprisioned his whole life, without being able to obtain any trial at all. The parliament was not contented with introducing arbitrary power and popery in Canada, with its former limits, but they have annexed to it the vast tracts of land that surround all the colonies.  
Does not your blood run cold, to think an English parliament should pass an act for the establishment of arbitrary power and popery in such an extensive country? If they had had any regard to the freedom and happiness of mankind, they would never have done it. If they had been friends to the protestant cause, they would never have provided such a nursery for its great enemy: They would not have given such encouragement to popery. The thought of their conduct, in this particular shocks me. It must shock you too my friends. Beware of trusting yourselves to men, who are capable of such an action! They may as well establish popery in New-York and the other colonies as they did in Canada. They had no more right to do it there than here.  
Is it not better, I ask, to suffer a few present inconveniencies, than to put yourselves in the way of losing every thing that is precious. Your lives, your property, your religion are all at stake. I

le to pay them. The law ruins many a good honest family. Disputes may be settled in a more friendly way; one or two virtuous neighbours may be chosen by each party to decide them. If the next congress should think any regulations concerning the courts of justice requisite, they will make them; and proper persons will be appointed to carry them into execution, and to see, that no individuals deviate from them. It will be your duty to elect persons, whose fidelity and zeal for your interest you can’t depend upon, to represent you in that congress; which is to meet at Philadelphia, in May ensuing.  
The Farmer cries, “tell me not of delegates, congresses committees, mobs, riots, insurrections, associations; a plague on them all. Give me the steady, uniform, unbiassed influence of the courts of justice. I have been happy under their protection, and I trust in God, I shall be so again.”  
I say, tell me not of the British Commons, Lords, ministry, ministerial tools, placemen, pensioners, parasites. I scorn to let my life and property depend upon the pleasure of any of them. Give me the steady, uniform, unshaken security of constitutional freedom; give me the right to be tried by a jury of my own neighbours, and to be taxed by my own representatives only. What will become of the law and courts of justice without this? The shadow may remain, but the substance will be gone. I would die to preserve the law upon a solid foundation; but take away liberty, and the foundation is destroyed.  
The last thing I shall take notice of, is the complaint of the Farmer, that the congress will not allow you “a dish of tea to please your wives with, nor a glass

The affair of Canada is still worse. The Romish faith is made the es-  
tablished religion of the land and his Majesty is placed at the head of it.  
The free exercise of Protestant faith depended upon the pleasure of the  
Governor and Council. The Parliament was not content with introducing  
arbitrary power and Popery into Canada with its former limits, but they have  
annexed to it vast tracts that surround all the Culonies. Does not your blood  
run cold, to think an English Parliament should pass an Act for the estab-  
lishment of arbitrary power and Popery in such an extensive eountry. If  
they had had any regard to the freedom and happiness of mankind, they  
would never have done it. If they had been friends to the Protestant cause  
they never would have provided such a nursery for its great enemy. They  
would never have given such encouragement to Popery. The thought of their  
conduct in this particular shocks me. It must shock you too my friends.  
Beware of trusting yourselves to men who are capable of such an action [  
They may as well establish Popery in New York and the other colonies as.  
they did in Canada. They had no more right to do it there than here.—  
Your lives, your property, your religion are all at stake.—(p. 26.)

a marked influence. The author, although probably under  
eighteen when he wrote the Vindication, was already a states-  
man. For grasp of principles, mastery of facts, clearness of  
statement and cogency of reasoning, these papers deserve high  
rank in the political literature of the Revolution. What, at  
that time, were the politics of this youth, who, up to 1772, had  
been an inhabitant of the West Indies? Had he, within the  
short space of two years, become an American? In arguing  
against the claim that Parliament had an unlimited right to  
legislate for the colonies, he wrote :  
  
All men have one common original: they participate in one common  
nature, and consequently have one common right. No reason can be  
advanced why one man should exercise any power or pre-eminence  
over his fellow-creatures more than another, unless they have voluntarily  
vested him with it. Since, then, Americans have not, by any act of  
theirs, empowered the British Parliament to make laws for them, it fol-  
lows they can have no just authority to do it.&quot;  
  
It is not (he continued) the burden of a particular tax which  
the colonies resent :  
  
The Parliament claims a right to tax us in all cases whatsoever ; its  
late acts are in virtue of that claim. How ridiculous, then, it is to  
affirm that we are quarrelling for the trifling sum of three pence a  
pound on tea, when it is evidently the principle against which we  
contend.”

‘We can live without trade of any kind. Food and clothing we  
have within ourselves. Our climate produces cotton, wool, flax and  
hemp; which with proper cultivation would furnish us with sum-  
mer apparel in abundance. The article of cotton, indeed would do  
more; it would contribute to defend us from the inclemency of  
the winter. We have sheep, which, with due care in improving  
and increasing them, would soon yield a sufficiency of wool. The  
large quantity of skins we have among us would never let us want  
a comfortable suit. It would be no unbecoming employment for  
our daughters to provide silk for their own country. The silk  
worm answers as well here as in any part of the world. Those  
hands which may be deprived of business by the cessation of com-  
merce, may be occupied in various kinds of manufactures and other  
internal improvements. If, by the necessity of the thing, manu-  
factures should unce be established, and take root among us, they  
will pave the way still more to the future grandeur and glory of  
America, and by lessening its need of external commerce, will  
  
render it still securer against the encroachments of tyranny.  
It would be extremely hurtful to the commerce of Great Britian t
