Dear Sir  
Monticello  
Feb. 4. 24.  
I duly recieved your favor of the 13th and, with it, the last No of the N. A. Review. this has anticipated the one I should recieve in course, but have not yet recieved under my subscription to the new series. the article on the African colonisation of the people of colour, to which you invite my attention, I have read with great consideration. it is indeed a fine one, and will do much good. I learn from it more too than I had before known of the degree of success and promise of that colony.In the disposition of these unfortunate people, there are two rational objects to be distinctly kept in view. 1. the establishment of a colony on the coast of Africa, which may introduce among the Aborigines the arts of cultivated life, and the blessings of civilisation and science. by doing this, we may make to them some retribution for the long course of injuries we have been committing on their population. and considering that these blessings will descend to the ‘nati natorum, et qui nascentur ab illis,’ we shall, in the long run, have rendered them perhaps more good than evil. to fulfil this object the colony of Sierra leone promises well, and that of Mesurado adds to our prospect of success. under this view the colonization society is to be considered as a Missionary society, having in view however objects more humane, more justifiable, and less aggressive on the peace of other nations than the others of that appellation.The 2d object, and the most interesting to us, as coming home to our physical and moral characters, to our happiness and safety, is to provide an Asylum to which we can, by degrees, send the whole of that population from among us, and establish them under our patronage and protection, as a separate, free and independant people, in some country and climate friendly to human life and happiness. that any place on the coast of Africa should answer the latter purpose, I have ever deemed entirely impossible. and, without repeating the other [[arguments which have been  urged by others, I will appeal to figures only, which admit no controversy. I shall speak in round numbers, not absolutely accurate, yet not so wide from truth as to vary the result materially. there are in the US: a million and a half of people of colour in slavery. to send off the whole of these at once nobody concieves to be practicable for us, or expedient for them. let us take 25. years for it’s accomplishment, within which time they will be doubled. their estimated value as property, in the first place, (for actual property has been lawfully vested in that form, and who can lawfully take it from the possessors?) at an average of 200. D. each, young and old, would amount to 600. millions of Dollars, which must be paid or lost by somebody. to this add the cost of their transportation by land &amp; sea to Mesurado, a year’s provision of food and clothing, implements of husbandry and of their trades which will amount to 300. millions more, making 36. millions of Dollars a year for 25. years, with ensurance of peace all that time, and it is impossible to look at the question a second time. I am aware that at the end of about 16. years, a gradual detraction from this sum will commence, from the gradual diminution of breeders, and go on during the remaining 9. years. calculate this deduction, and it is still impossible to look at the enterprize a second time. I do not say this to induce an inference that the getting rid of them is for ever impossible. for that is neither my opinion, nor my hope. but only that it cannot be done in this way. there is, I think, a way in which it can be done, that is, by emancipating the after-born, leaving them, on due compensation, with their mothers, until their services are worth their maintenance, and then putting them to industrious occupations, until a proper age for deportation. this was the result of my reflections on the subject five and forty years ago; and I have never yet been able to concieve any other practicable plan. it was sketched in the Notes on Virginia, under the 14th Query. the estimated value of the new-born infant is so low (say 12½ Dollars) that it would probably be yielded by the owner gratis, and would thus reduce the 600, millions of Dollars, the first head of expence, to 37. Millions &amp; a half. leaving only the expences of nourishment while with the mother, and of transportation. and from what fund are these expences to be furnished? Why not from that of the lands which have been ceded by the very states now needing this relief? and ceded on no consideration, for the most part, but that of the general good of the whole. these cessions already constitute one fourth of the states of the Union. it may be said that these lands have been sold, are now the property of the citizens composing those states, and the money long ago recieved and expended. but an equivalent of lands in the territories since acquired, may be appropriated to that object, or so much, at least, as may be sufficient; and the object, altho’ more important to the slave-states, is highly so to the others also, if they were serious in their arguments on the Missouri question. the slave-states too, if more interested, would also contribute more by their gratuitous liberation, thus taking on themselves alone the first and heaviest item of expence. In the plan sketched in the Notes on Virginia no particular place of asylum was specified; because it was thought possible that, in the revolutionary state of America, then commenced, events might open to us some one within practicable distance. this has now happened. St. Domingo is become independant, and with a population of that colour only; and, if the public papers are to be credited, their Chief offers to pay their passage, to recieve them as free citizens, and to provide them employment. this leaves then for the general confederacy no expence but of nurture with the mother a few years, and would call of course for a very moderate appropriation of the vacant lands. suppose the whole annual increase to be of 60 thousand effective births. 50. vessels of 400. tons burthen each, constantly employed in that short run, would carry off the increase of every year, &amp; the old stock would die off in the ordinary course of nature, lessening from the commencement until it’s final disappearance. in this way no violation of private right is proposed. voluntary surrenders would probably come in as fast as the means to be provided for their care would be competent to.]] looking at my own state only, and I presume not to speak for the others, I verily believe that this surrender of property would not amount to more annually than half our present direct taxes, to be continued fully about 20. or 25. years, and then gradually diminishing for as many more until their final extinction: and even this half tax would not be paid in cash, but by the delivery of an object which they have never yet known or counted as part of their property: and those not possessing the object will be called on for nothing. I do not go into all the details of the burthens and benefits of this operation. and who could estimate it’s blessed effects? I leave this to those who will live to see their accomplishment, and to enjoy a beatitude forbidden to my age. but I leave it with this admonition to rise and be doing. a million and a half are within their controul; but 6. millions (which a majority of those now living will see them attain) and one million of these fighting men, will say ‘we will not go.’I am aware that this subject involves some constitutional scruples, but a liberal construction, justified by the object, may go far, and an amendment of the constitution the whole length necessary. the separation of infants from their mothers too would produce some scruples of humanity. but this would be straining at a gnat, and swallowing a camel.I am much pleased to see that you have taken up the subject of the duty on imported books. I hope a crusade will be kept up against it until those in power shall become sensible of this stain on our legislation, and shall wipe it from their code, and from the remembrance of man, if possible. I salute you with assurances of high respect and esteem.Th: Jefferson

In the same letter, speaking again of his plan for getting rid of slavery,  
Mr. Jefferson says that it is  
  
“By emancipating the after born, leaving them on due compensation, with their moth-

‘ ous occupations, until a proper age for pDEPporTATION. This was the result of my ret.ec-

‘any other practicable plan.” * * “In the plan sketched in the Notes on Virginia, no

! in course, but have not vet received, under my aubst rip­

j Ionization of the people of cuUir, lo which you i ivi&#x27;i my  
attention, I have read with great consideration ll la,  
indeed, a fine one, and will do much good. I I.am  
j from it more, too, than I had before known, of the tie  
| grei- of success and promise of thai colony  
; In the disposition of these unfortunate people, there  
are two rational objects to ho distinctly kept in i ? w

I of cultivati d life, arid the blessings of ctviiiaatton d  
I a&lt; teiice liy doing this, wc inay make to them mime  
retribution for the long course of injuries at have been

el qui natrrnitrr ab wo shall, tn the herun,  
| have rendered them, perhaps, more good than ? &lt; i lo  
; fulfil this object, the colony of Sierra Leone promiaea  
well, and that of Meaurado add* to our prospect ol nu -

however, nluecta more huuia ?. more justifiable, ai &lt;i?

The second object, and the moat interesting to us,

which we can, by decrees, send the whole of that |

revenue to the colonization and emancipa­  
tion of the slaves—provided their owners  
would agree to the measure. Now, what  
will our candid and honest Van Buren  
friends say when they are informed that  
this very measure originated with Mi. Jef­  
ferson himself, as we will prove by his  
own letters. In Vol. IX, of his correspon­  
detfee. .nage 388, will be found a letter from  
Mr. Jefferson to Jarea o&#x27;truugy -daled Mon­  
ticello Feb. 4, 1824, from which we make  
the following  
EXTRACTS.  
&quot;In the disposition of these unfortunate  
people, (the slaves,) there are two rational  
objects to be kept in view. 1. The esta­  
blishment of a colony on the coast of Africa,  
which may introduce among the aborigines  
the arts of civilized life, and the blessings  
of civilization and science. By doing this,  
we may make to them some retribution for  
the long course of injuries we have been  
committing on their population.  
&quot;Thesecond object,&quot; says Mr. Jefferson,  
&quot;and the most interesting to us, as coming  
home to our physical and moral characters,  
to our happiness and safety, is to provide  
an asylum to which we can,*by degrees,  
seqd the whole of that population from  
among us, and establish them under our  
protection, as a separate, free, and inde­  
pendent people, in some country and cli­  
mate friendly to human life and happiness.&quot;  
&quot; There is a way,&quot; he continues, &quot;I think,  
in which it can be done; that is by emanci­  
pating the after born, leaving them, on due  
compensation, with their mothers, until their  
services are worth their maintenance, and  
then putting them to industrious occupa­  
tions, until a proper age for deportation.  
* * • •  
&quot;And from what funds are these expen­  
ses to be furnished ? Why not from that  
ofthe LANDS, which have been ceded by  
the very States notv needing this relief?—  
And ceded for no consideration, for the  
most part, but that of the general good of  
the whole. These cessions already consti­  
tute one-fourth of the States of the Union.  
It may be said that these lands have been  
sold: are now the property of the citizens  
composing those States; and the money  
long ago received and expended. But an  
equivalent of lands in the territories since  
acquired, may be appropriated to that ob­  
ject, or so much at least, us may be suffi­  
cient, and the object, although more impor­  
tant to the slave States, is highly so to the  
others also, if they were serious in their  
arguments on the Missouri question. The  
*lave States, too, if more interested, would

slavery, he proceeds thus : #  
&quot; There w, I think, a way in which it can he done ; that  
is by emancipating the aftei born, leaving them, on duecom­  
I pensation, with their mother*, until their serviced are worth  
their maintenance, and then putting them to industrious oc­  
cupations, untd a proper age tor deportation. Thin was the  
result of my reflection*) on the subject five and forty years ago,  
and I have never yet been able to conceive any other practi­  
cable plan. It was sketched in the Notes on Virginia, under  
the fourteenth query. The estimated value of the new-born  
infant is so low (sav twelve dollar* and fifty cents) that it  
would probably be yielded by the owner gratis, and would  
thus reduce the six hundred millions of dollars, the first head  
of expense, to thirty-seven millions and a half; leaving only  
the expenses of nourishment while with the mother, and of  
transportation. And from what fund are these expenses to be  
furnished &#x27; Why not from that of the lands which have been  
ceded by the very States now needing this relief And ceded  
on no consideration, for the most part, but that of the general  
good of the whole. These cessions already coriatitute one­  
fourth of the States of the I&#x27;nion. It may be said that then*  
lands have been sold ; are now the propeijy of the citizens  
composing th&lt;we States ; and the money long ago received and  
expended. But an equivalent of lands in the territories since  
I acquired, may t&gt;e appropriated to that object, or so much at  
leist as may be sufficient; and the object, although more im­  
portant to the slave States, is highly so to the others also, if  
they weri* serious in their arguments on the Missouri question.  
The slave States, too, if more interested, would also contri­  
tribute more by their gratuitous liberation, thus taking on  
themselves alone the first ami heaviest item of ex|ienie.  
&quot; In the plan sketched in the Notes on Virginia, no parti­  
cular place o( asylum was specified ; because it was thought  
possible that, in the revolutionary state of America, then com­  
menced, events might open to us some one within practicable  
distance. This has now happened. St.* Domingo has be­  
come independent, and with a population of that color only ;  
i and, if the public papers are to l?e credited, their Chief offers  
: to pay their passage, to receive them ns free citizens, and to  
provide them employment. This leaves, then, for the gene­  
| ral confederacy, no expense but of nurture with the mother a  
tew years, and would call, of course, for a very moderate ap­  
| propriation of the vacant lands.

To Jared Sparks.  
Mokti(-km.o, February 4, 1824.  
Dear Sir: I duly received your favor of the  
13th, and with it the last number of the North  
American Review. Tine has anticipated the  
one I should receive in course, hut have not  
yet reoeived, under my subscription to the new  
series. The artitie on the African colonization  
of the people of color, to which you invite  
my attention, I have read with much consideration.  
It is, indeed, a tine one, and will do  
much good. I learn from it more, too, than I  
had l&gt;efore known, of the degree of euoce-s  
and promise of that colony. In the disposition  
of these unfortunoto people, there are two  
rational objects to be distinctly kept in view  
l &#x27;The establishment of a colony on the oooM  
  
of Africa, which may introduce among the  
aborigines the arti of cultivated life, and the  
blessings of civilization and science. By doing  
this, we may make to them some retribution  
for the long course of injuries we have been  
committing on their population. And considering  
that those blessings will descend to the  
&quot;noli natorum, 11 qui nascent ur al&gt; tilts,&#x27;&#x27; we  
shall in the long run have rendered them  
perhaps more good than evil. To fulfil thin  
object the colony of Sierra I^eono promise*  
well, and that of Mesurado adds to our prospect  
of success. Under this view, the Colonization  
Society is to l&gt;e considered as a mission  
nry society, having, in view, however, object*  
more humane, more justifiable, and less ug  
gressive on the peace of other nations, than  
the others of that appellation.  
The secoud object, and the most interest  
ing to us, as cowing to home to our physical  
and moral characters, to our happiness and  
safety, is to pmndt- an asylum, to which we  
can, by degrees, send the whole of that population  
from among us, and establish them under  
our patronage and protection, as a separate,  
free, and independent people, in somo  
country and climate friendly to human life  
and happiness. That any place on the coast  
of Africa should answer the latter purpose, I  
have ever deemed entirely impossible. And  
without repeating the other arguments which  
have lawn urged by others, 1 will appeal to  
figures only, which admit of no controversy.  
I shall speak in round numbers, not absolutely  
accurate, yet not so wide from truth as to vary  
the result materially. There are in the United  
States a million and a half of people of color in  
slavery. To send oft the whole of these at once,  
nobody conceives to l?e practicable for us, or  
expedient for them bet us take twenty-five  
years for its accomplishment, within w hich time  
they will be doubled Their estimated value

J do not nay thin to induce an inference that  
the petting rid of them is forever impossible  
for that is neither my opinion nor uiy hopo.  
but only that it cannot I?o done in this way  
There is. I think, a way in which it oan be  
I done?that is, by emancipating the after-borti,  
leaving tbeui. on due compensation, with their  
mothers, until their services are worth their  
maintenance, and then putting them to industrious  
occupations, until a proper ugc for deportation.  
This was the result of mv reflections  
on the subject live and forty years ago.  
and I have uevcr yet !&gt;eon alile to conceive any  
other practicable plan. It was sketched in the  
Notes on Virginia, under the fourteenth query  
The estimated value of the new-born inlni.t is  
mj low, (say twelve dollars and lifty cents ) thai  
it would probably be yielded by the owner t  
gratis. an&lt;i would lhu? reduce the six hundred .  
millions of dollars?the first head of expense? (  
to thirty se\cn millions and a half; leaving only  
the expi ti-es of nourishment while with the  
mother, and of transportation. And from what  
tund are the c expenses to lie furnished? Why  
not from that of the lands which have been  
. eded by the very States now needing this relief??and  
cedtuon no consideration, for the  
most part, but that of tho general good of the  
whole. These cessions already constitute onefourth  
of the Statcti of the Cnion. It may be  
Mid that these lands have been sold, are now  
the property of the citizens composing those  
&gt;tatt ?. and the money long ago rccoited and  
  
expended. Hut an equivalent of lands in the  
territories since acquired may be appropriated  
to &#x27;hat object, or so much, at least, an may be  
sufficient: and the object, although more important  
to the slave States, in highly ho to the  
others also, if they were serious in their arguments  
on the Missouri question. The slave  
States, too if more interested, would also contribute  
more by their gratuitous liberation  
thus taking on themselves alone the tirst and  
neavieat itein of expense In the plan sketched  
in the Notes on Viiginia, no particular place  
of asylum wa?, sjH&#x27;citied, because it won thought  
possible tiuit. in the revolutionary state ol  
America, then commenced, events might open  
to us some one within practicable distance.  
Thiw has now happened. St. Oomingo has become  
independent, ami with a population ol  
that color only ; and, il the public papers are  
to be credited, their chief offors to pay their !  
passage, to receive them as free citizens, and to  
provide them employment. This loaves, then,  
tor the general Confederacy, no expense but ol  
nurture with the mother a low years, and  
would call, of course, for a very moderate ap  
propriatioo of tho vacant lands. Suppose the  
whole annual increase to be of sixty thousand  
effective births; lifty vessels, of four hundred  
tons burthen each, constantly employed in  
that short run, would carry off the increase ol  
every year, and tho old stock would die off in  
the ordinary course of nature, lessening from  
the commencement until its tinal disappearance  
In this wav. no violation of private right  
is proposed. Voluntary surrenders would  
probably oome in as last as the means to hi  
provided for their care would be oompeteht t  
it. Looking at my own State only?and I pre  
sumo not to speak for the others?I verily In  
iieve that thin surrender of property would not  
I amount to more, annually, than half our pros  
out direct taxes, to bo continued fully about

ally diminishing for im muny more, until their  
final extinction ; and eyen thin half tax would  
not be paid in cash, but by the delivery of an  
object which they have never yet known or  
counted oh part of their property; and those  
not pommrfriag tho object will be called on for  
nothing. I do not no into All the detail* of Unburdens

who could estimate it* blessed effeots 1 I leave  
this to those who will live to see their accomplishment.

to rise and be doing. A million and a  
half are within their control; but six million*,  
(which a majority of those now living will nee  
thorn attain.) and one million of these fighting  
inen, will nay, &quot; Wo will not go.&quot;  
I arn aware that this subject involve* some

justified by the object, may go far, and an  
amendment of tho Constitution the whole

he was induced to write a couple of letters

Three years later after speaking of the Col  
onizator Society, he said, &quot;There is I think,  
a way in which it can be done; that is, by  
emancipating the after born, leaving them  
on due compensation, with their mothers,  
until their services are worth their main

deportation. This was the result of my re­  
flections on the subject five and forty years

ceive any other practicable plan. It was  
sketched in the Notes on Virginia, under  
the fourteenth query.&quot; &quot;I do not go into

its blessed effets? I leave this to those whe

rational objects to be distinctly kept in view: First, the establishment of a
