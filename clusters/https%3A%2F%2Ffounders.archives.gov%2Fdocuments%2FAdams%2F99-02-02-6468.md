Dear Doctor  
Quincy May. 15. 1815  
  
I thank you for your favour of the 10th. and the Pamphlet inclosed “American Unitarianism.” I have turned over its Leaves, and found nothing that was not familiarly known to me  
In the preface, Unitarianism, is represented as only thirty years old in New England. I can testify as a Witness to its old Age. Sixty five years Ago, my own Minister the Reverend Lemuel Briant, Dr Jonathan Mayhew of the West Church in Boston, The Reverend Mr Shute of Hingham The Reverend John Brown of Cohasset, and perhaps equal to all, if not above all, The Reverend Mr Gay of Hingham; were Unitarians. Among the Laity, how many could I name Lawyers, Physicians, Tradesmen, Farmers? I could fill a Sheet, but at present will name only one. Richard Cranch a Man who had Studied Divinity, and Jewish and Christian Antiquities more than any Clergyman now existing in New England  
More than fifty years ago I read Dr Samuel Clark, Emlyn, and Dr Waterland. Do you expect, my dear Doctor to teach me any new thing in favour of Athanasianism?  
There is, my dear Doctor, at present existing in the World a Church phylosophic, as Subtle as learned, as hypocritical, as the holy roman, Catholic, Apostolic and Œcumenical Church.  
This phylosophical Church was originally English. Voltaire learned it from Lord Herbert, Hobbes Morgan Collin Shaftsbury Bolingbroke &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c  
You may depend upon it, your Exertions will promote the Church phylosophic more than the Church Athenasian, or Presbyterian.  
This and the coming Age will not be ruled by Inquisitions or Jesuits. The restoration of Napoleon, has been caused by the Resurection of Inquisitions and Jesuits.  
I am, and wish to be your Friend  
John Adam

“Dear Doctor— I thank you for your favor  
of the 10th, and the pamphlet enclosed, enti-  
tled «American Unitarianism.’ I have turned  
over its leaves, and found nothing that was not  
familiarly known to me. Inthe preface Unita-  
rianism is represented as only thirty years old  
in New-England. I can testify as a wilness to  
its old age. Sixty-five years ago, my own min-  
ister, the Rev. Lemuel Byrant; Dr Jonathan  
Mayhew, of the West Church in Boston ; the Rev.  
Mr Shute of Hingham; the Rey. John Brown,  
of Cohasset; and perhaps equal to all, if not  
above all, the Rev. Mr Gay, of Hingham, were  
  
Unitarians. Among the laity, how many cou  
I name, lawyers, physicians, tradesmen, oe  
ich-  
  
ers! But at present I will name only one,  
ard Cranch, a man who had studied divinity, and  
Jewish and Christian antiquities, more than any  
clergyman now existing in New-England. More  
than fifty years ago I read Dr Clarke, Emlyn,  
and Dr Waterland: do you expect, my dear  
doctor, to teach me any thing new in favor of  
Athanasianism ?—There is, my dear doctor, at  
present existing in the world, a Church Philo-  
sophic, as subtle, as learned, as hypocritical,  
as the Holy Roman Catholic, Apostolic, and  
(Ecumenical Church. The Philosophical Church  
was originally English. Voltaire learned it  
from Lord Herbert, Hobbes, Morgan, Collins,  
Shaftsbury, Bolinbroke, &amp;c.&amp;c. &amp;c. You may  
depend upon it, your exertions will promote the  
  
  
  
  
  
Church Philosophic, more than the Church

Athanasian or Presbytery i end
