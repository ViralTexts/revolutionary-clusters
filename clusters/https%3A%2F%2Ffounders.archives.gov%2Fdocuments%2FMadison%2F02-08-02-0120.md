ioned, we had much general Conversation on the topicks depending between us, which as it corresponded with what had passed before and been communicated to you, it is unnecessary to repeat. He appeared to agree with me with great sincerity in the advantage to be derived to both countries, from the preservation of their present amicable relations and to be quite satisfied with the state in which the negotiation was left, assuring me that he would not fail to take it up on my return, with an earnest desire to Conclude it to the Satisfaction of both parties; tho’ he intimated that there was great difficulty attending certain branches of it. He suggested that as I was forced to go to Spain he hoped that the suspension would prove equally Convenient to us both, to which I assented. He thought it unnecessary for me to go to Weymouth to take leave of the King, as he kept no regular court there and my absence would be short; he promised however to communicate to his Majesty my request to be presented to him there, as of his undertaking to prevent it, with which view he desired me to address him a special note to that effect to be submitted to the King, a copy of which is enclosed.  
In the Course of this Conversation Lord Harrowby expressed concern to find the U. States opposed to G. Britain on certain great neutral questions, in favor of the doctrines of the modern law, which he termed novelties. I replied that in adhering to our principles the President had endeavoured to arrange them in a friendly manner with his government; that he had taken no step of an opposite character; that he had sought no concert with the neutral powers in support of them, as he had supposed that a satisfactor⟨y⟩ arrangement to both governments might be made by direct communication betwee⟨n⟩ them which he preferr’d. He observed that altho’ while the negotiation was suspended his government would adhere to its principles, yet that it would act in what concerned us, with moderation, in the practice of them.  
I informed you in my letter of the 8. of September that a case had occurr⟨e⟩d of an American vessel engaged in commerce between Batavia and Holland as was inferred, by her having an European destination, being brought int⟨o⟩ port and subjected to trial. The case is not yet decided, tho’ in his remarks, while the cause was in hearing before the Court, the Judge maintained the British doctrine: it was postponed to give time to ascertain what th⟨e⟩ regulations of the government of Holland were in peace respecting our Commerce with that colony. He did not say if they prohibited the trade, that they would Condemn the vessel. It is probable she may be acquitted on some other point in the cause without impugning that principle. I⟨t⟩ is understood that several other vessels engaged in the Same trade which were stopped and examined at the Texel by the British Cruizers, were permitted to prosecute their voyage; hence it is presumable that orders were given to that effect by the government. It is certain that on no principle or pretext whatever, has more than one of our vessels been condemned, on which judgment there is an appeal.  
The whole subject is now before the President, on which I have to remark, that in discharging this trust I have endeavoured in eve⟨ry⟩ stage, to give full effect to the feelings and sentiments of my country in respect to the objects in question, especially the unwarrantable practice of impressment, without taking any step which should compromit our government, in the part it should take, when the result was submitted to it. In that state the affair now is, for after the expiration of a few months, it is perfectly consistent with it, to revive the negotiation in such form as the President may deem adviseable. The proceeding here lays a foundation for any course which the publick honor and interest may dictate. If it is deemed expedient in pursuing our just rights to profit of time and circumstances and in the interim, unless they be secured by a fair and equal Treaty, to act with moderation ’till the occasion invites to a more decisive and hazardous policy, the state of things permits it. Or if it should be deemed more adviseable to adopt the latter course at present, the opportunity is fair for such a measure. The situation in which our government will find itself on receiving this communication is a very different one from that in which I have stood throughout. If the latter course is preferr’d it cannot be doubted that the moderation which has been so far observed will strengthen the government in any the most vigorous measures which may be thought necessary. A virtuous and free people will be more united in support of such measures however Strong they may be, when they see by the clearest evidence that the cause is not only just but that their government has done every thing in its power which the national honor and interest would permit to avoid such an extremity.

Harrowby, Me had much general conver­  
sation on the topics depending between us,  
which, as it corresponded with what has pas­  
sed before and communicated to you, it is  
unnecessary to repeat. lie appeared to a­  
gree with me with great sincerity in the ad­  
vantage to be derived to both countries, from  
the preservation of their present amicable  
relations, and to be quite satisfied with the  
vtate in which the negotiation was left, as­  
| suring me that he would not fail to take it  
[up on my return, with an earnest desire to  
i conclude it to the satisfaction of both parties ; I  
though he intimated that there was great !  
difficulty attending certain branches of it —  
lie suggested that as I was forced to go to  
Spain, Ik. hoped that the suspension would  
prove equally convenient to us both, to which  
I assented. I to thought it unnecessary for  
me to go to Weymouth to take leave of the  
king, as he kept no regular court there, and  
ray absence would be short; he promised  
however to communicate to his majestv my  
request to be presented to him there, as of  
his undertaking to prevent it, with which  
view he desired me to address him a special  
ote to that elFect to be submitted to the king, !  
a copy of which is enclosed.  
In the Course of this conversation lord |  
Harrowby expressed concern to find the U- i  
nited States opposed to Great-Britain on cc.r- j  
tain great neutral questions, in favor of the j  
doctrines of the modern law which he term­  
ed novelties. I replied, that in adhering to  
our principles&#x27;, the president had endeavor­  
ed to arrange them in a friendly manner with !  
his government ; that he had taken no step J  
of an opposite character ; that he had sought  
ho concert w ith the neutral powers in sup­  
port of them, as he had supposed that a sat­  
isfactory arrangement to both governments  
might be made by direct communication be­  
tween them, which he preferred, lie ob­  
served, that although while the negotiation  
was suspended, his government would ad­  
here to its principles, yet that it would act  
in what concerned us, with moderation in  
the practice of them.  
1 informed you in my letter of the 8th of  
September, that a case had occurred of. an  
American vessel engaged in commerce be­  
tween Batavia and Holland, as was inferred,  
by her having tin European destination, be­  
ing brought into port and subjected to trial.  
The case is not yet decided, though in his i  
remarks, while the cause was in bearinerbe- I  
  
tore the court, the judge maintained the Bri­  
tish doctrine; it was postponed to give time  
to ascertain what the regulations of the go­  
vernment of Holland were in peace respect­  
ing our commerce with that colony. He did  
not say if they prohibited the trade, that he  
would condemn the vessel. It is probable  
she may be acquitted or some other point in &#x27;  
the cause without impugning that principle. 1  
It is understood that several other vessels ;  
engaged in the same trade which were stop­  
ped and examined at the Texel by the Bri- !  
tish cruizers, were permitted to prosecute  
their voyage; hence it is presumable that  
orders were given to that effect by the go­  
vernments. It is certain that on no princi­  
ple or pretext whatever, has more than one  
of our vessels been condemned, on which  
judgment there is an appeal.  
1 lie whole subject is now before the Pre­  
sident, on which 1 have to remark, that in  
discharging thistru^t. I have endeavored in  
every stage to give full effect to the feelings  
and sentiments of my country, in respect to  
the objects in question, especially the un- 1  
warrantable practice of impressment, with- j  
out taking any step which should conipromit  
our government, in the part it should take,  
when tne result was submitted to it. In that  
state the affair now is, for after the expi­  
lationof a few months, it is perfectly consis­  
tent with it, to revive the negotiation in such  
form as the president may deem adviseablc.  
The proceeding here, lays a foundation for  
any course which the public honor and inte­  
rest may dictate. If it is deemed expedient  
in pursuing our just rights to profit of time  
and circumstances, and in the interim, un­  
less they be secured by a fair and equal trea­  
ty, to act with moderation till the occasion  
invites to a more decisive and hazardous po­  
i Jicy, the state of things permits it. Or if it  
i should be deemed more adviseable to adopt  
the latter course at present, the opportunity  
is fair for such a measure. The situation in  
| which our government will find itself on re­  
I ceiving this communication, is a very dif­  
j ferent one from that in which I have stood  
througheuti If the latter course is prefer­  
red, it cannot be doubted that the moderation  
which has been so far observed, will strength­  
en the government in any the most vigor­  
ous measures which may be thought neces­  
■ sary.  
| A virtuous and free people will be more  
united in support of such measures, however  
| strong they may be, when they see by the  
I Clearest evidence that the cause is not only­  
just, but that their government has done c­  
very thing in its power which the national  
honor and interest would permit, to avoid  
such an extremity.”
