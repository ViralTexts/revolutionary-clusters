ears to be essential to the preservation of our civil rights.  
  
The pilgrims, who landed at Plymouth, seemed to have been fully possessed of the value of military science; for they brought out a military leader, as well as ministers and elders with them, knowing that they should not be able to enjoy the rights of conscience, and their spiritual privileges, without the aid of temporal power. Their danger from the Indians convinced them, that this was a subject which was not to be left to accidental acquirement; and, in fifteen years after their landing, captain Myles Standish and Lieutenant William Holmes, were appointed &quot;to teach the use of arms for the towns of Plymouth and Duxbury.&quot; These officers were each allowed a salary of £20 sterling a year, &quot;to be paid in corn or beaver, as it should then pass.&quot; As the settlement in other towns increased, provision was made for their instruction in like manner. To encourage attention to the subject, military attainments were made the ground of honorary titular distinctions which were allowed by the express grant of the civil government. It is remarkable, in the early old colony records to observe, that those who filled important civil offices are noticed by the appellation of Mr. only, while such as held military commissions were always distinguished by the titles which their rank conferred.  
  
In founding their military establishments upon the love of distinction, which animates mankind to the most extraordinary exertions, our ancestors discovered that accurate knowledge of the human character which deserves the consideration of their descendants. The charter of the school for military discipline, which was granted in Plymouth in 1642, is so instructive on the point of the application of many of those principles, which will always be necessary for making good citizen soldiers, that 1 cannot forbear to notice its leading characteristics. It provides,  &quot;That the officers should be chosen by the association, and approved by the court.  
  
&quot;That their exercise should be begun and ended with prayer.  
  
&quot;That they should have a sermon preached to them once a year, on the election of their officers.  
  
&quot;That none should be received into the company, but such are honest and of good report, freemen and not servants; and that they should be well approved by the officers, and the majority of the company.  
  
&quot;That every man who should be admitted as a member, should be subject to the command of his officers, and every delinquent, and those who should not keep silence, or, who exercised jeering, fighting or quarrelling, should be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and punished according to the order of military discipline, and the nature of the offence.  
  
&quot;That every man who should be absent, except on good occasion, or the hand of God was upon him, should pay for his default; and, if he refused, he should be distrained, and put out of the list.  
  
  
&quot;That every man who entered the military list, and did not provide his arms, should be put out of the list; and that all who came with defective arms, should be fined sixpence for each article deficient.  
  
&quot;That all that are, or shall be elected, chief officers of the military company shall be so titled, and forever afterwards be so reputed, unless he obtain a higher place.  
  
&quot;That if any member of the company die, the members shall assemble with their arms, upon warning, and inter his corpse, as a soldier, according to his place and qualitie.  
  
&quot;That none shall be taken into the company without being propounded, one meeting, before they shall be received; and, that none shall be admitted, who shall not first take the oath of fidelity.&quot;  
  
The same principles are contained in the grant of the first military company in Massachusetts, in 1638. That company is now composed of between two and three hundred members, who are principally active officers in the staff and in the line of the militia. They frequently meet together for drill and mutual instruction; and the names of some of the most distinguished military commanders in our history are borne on its rolls. The patronage of all the branches of the civil government, afforded to their public ceremonies, which are performed, according to the requisitions of their ancient charter, on the day of their annual election of officers,

his state, at the commencement of the late war, by the executive authority, (I speak of it in a military view only,) was founded upon its full conviction of the confidence of the people in their own ability to defend themselves. The governor, in his letter to the secretary of war, justly set forth the advantages resulting from the location and character of our population and force; he says, &quot;If the president was fully acquainted with the situation of this state, I think he would have no wish to call our militia into service, in the manner proposed.  
  
&quot;Predatory incursions are not likely to take place in this state, for at every point, except Passamaquoddy, which can present an object to those incursions, the people are too numerous to be attacked by such parties, as generally engage in expeditions of that kind.  
  
&quot;General Dearborn proposed that the detached militia should be stationed at only a few of the ports and places on the east; from the rest, a part of their militia were to be called away; this circumstance would increase their danger; it would invite the aggressions of the enemy, and diminish their power of resistance.  
  
&quot;Every harbour or port, within the state, has a compact settlement, and generally the country, around the harbours, is populous. The places contemplated in general Dearborn’s specifications, as the rendezvous of the detached militia, excepting in one or two instances, contain more of the militia than the portion of the militia assigned to them. The militia are well organized, and would, undoubtedly, prefer to defend their firesides, in company with their friends, under their own officers, rather than be marched to some distant place, while strangers might be introduced to take their places at home.  
  
&quot;In Boston the militia is well disciplined, and could be mustered in an hour, upon any signal of an approaching enemy; and in six hours the neighbouring towns would pour in a greater force than an invading enemy will bring against it.  
  
&quot;The same remark applies to Salem, Marblehead, and Newburyport, places whose harbours render an invasion next to impossible. In all of them there are, in addition to the common militia, independent corps of infantry and artillery, well disciplined and equipped, and ready, both in disposition and means, to repair to any place where invasion may be threatened, and able to repel it, except it should be made by a fleet of heavy ships, against which nothing, perhaps, would prove any defence, until the enemy should land; when the entire militia would be prepared to meet them.  
  
&quot;Against predatory incursions, the militia of each place would be able to defend their property; and in a very short time they would be aided, if necessary, by the militia of the surrounding country. In case of a more serious invasion, whole brigades, or divisions, could be collected seasonably for defence. Indeed, considering the state of the militia in this commonwealth, I think there can be no doubt that, detaching a part of it, and distributing it into small portions, will tend to impair the defensive power.&quot;  
  
  
Supported in his views of the ability and character of the militia, by the best military councils, the governor did not hesitate to place the authority, to call out and employ the force under their commands, in the hands of the officers themselves. But in a state, where the militia was not organized and trained, as well as armed; where the population was not sufficiently dense, wh

in a body; and in the interior, a portion of them are drilled sufficiently to hold the fastnesses, which abound in our country roads, while the rest, by hanging on the flanks of the enemy, acting under cover as sharpshooters; or in small parties, by intercepting his supplies, harassing his rear, cutting off his baggage,  
  
and picking up his wounded, will destroy him in detail. The success which attended this mode of warfare, by undisciplined troops at Lexington, was so marked, that it is wonderful it should since have been so much disregarded. The very men, who, when formed in a body, scattered like sheep upon the approach of the British columns, rendered signal services, the same day, on the enemy’s retreat, when they were left to the exercise of their individual intelligence. With such troops formed in line, as assembled at Hampden, and Bladensburg, there could be no hope of success. Whereas, in the routes of the enemy, there were bridges and defiles for the defence, of the artillery and disciplined corps; and buildings, bushes, and other cover, sufficient to have given that confidence to individual bravery, and effect to its exercise, which might have caused a different result to both of the expeditions of the enemy, which were attended with such disastrous consequences. But where the militia have been skilfully directed, from their superior individual intelligence, and the great interest they have at stake, they have always manifested an impetuosity and valour, which have done their country honour, and frequently enabled them to pluck the laurel from the brows of veterans. What, but their obstinate resistance, could have compelled the British troops to return twenty miles to Boston, the same day they marched out to destroy the stores at Concord? What, better than their steady perseverance at Bunker’s Hill, would have inspired the whole country with confidence in its physical strength? What could have arrested Burgoyne in his prog

It is, that the officers of the army unite in opinion, that one who has never shouldered a musket, is a better recruit than a militia man. Admit it. Does it thence follow, because militia drills will not make a soldier fit for the army ranks, they do not qualify him for his own?

he more perfect the men are as militia, the nearer will they approach to regulars. It should never be argued as an objection to the militia that it is inferior to the army.

And, when a British fleet, with troops and transports fitted for the purpose, was hovering on our coast, and there were not two hundred United States troops on the whole sea-board of the state, what could have prevented sir John Sherbroke their commander, who surprised and blew up one ship of war at Hampden, from destroying those on the stocks at Portsmouth, and at Boston, but the militia? Have we, who, when a fleet and transports, with twenty-seven hundred troops on board, was on our coast in 1814, prepared to execute the devastating order of admiral Cochrane, “to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts upon the coast, as might be found assailable,&quot; were flying into the interior with our families and moveables, for safety, so soon forgotten our dependence on the militia, when it was called out for our preservation?

ia is a burden too heavy to be borne? God grant that so long as such sentiments are disseminated, the recollection of these events may not be forgotten.  
Notwithstanding the protection it has afforded; yet, judging from the numerous propositions which have been made in congress, within the last ten or fifteen years, for new modifying the law of 1792, and from the speeches of the members on the subject, we should be led to conclude that the system had not answered the hopes of its projectors. This makes it necessary for us to examine the proposed  
  
substitutes, and see whether they are more likely to accomplish it.  
  
The plan which is most countenanced, is that which is founded upon a system of classification. This proposes, that the enrolled militia shall be divided into distinct corps, according to age, and that the youngest class shall be encamped, each year, for a definite period, and the officers and men paid for their services.

The elective principle was early applied to military institutions in this country, by those who regarded military power, both as the most important to the preservation of their civil rights, and the most dangerous to their existence. The people chose to keep the control of it, therefore, in their own hands. The advantage resulting from it, under the colonial government, and the aggressions of the troops, whose officers received their appointments from the crown, upon the citizens, just before the revolution, confirmed the favourable opinion of the principle which was already entertained, and induced our civil fathers to incorporate it into their frame of government. It is there provided that the privates shall choose their company officers; and the captains and subalterns, the field officers. These latter are made the electors of their respective brigadier generals; and the two branches of the legislature, by a concurrent vote, designate the person on whom the governor shall confer the high and important office of major-general. Thus, in all cases, the power is lodged with those, who not only have the most interest in the choice, but who are the best judges of the requisite qualifications for the vacant office. The disposition which is generally manifested for regular promotion, from the lowest to the highest station, operates as an inducement for the subordinate officers to hold their commissions some years, with a view to the attainment of the honours and distinction of higher rank. An officer is seldom superseded without cause, while the power of the electors to do it, every time a vacancy occurs, is a continual stimulus to the ambitious to qualify themselves for their present duties, as well as for those of higher places. Additional motives for the officers to continiie in command, long enough, not merely to obtain a competent knowledge of the active duties of the field, and to become acquainted with the provision of the laws regulating enrolments, inspections, and the returns of their respective commands; but, to gain a practical knowledge of the modes of filling up the blanks, the regular modes of their transmission, and in fact, the routine and forms of the military department, and the principles which govern it, are afforded by the laws which confer immunities upon those, who have been honourably discharged from their offices of a greater or less value, in proportion to the length of their period of service. These inducements are also increased by the established principle, which will not permit an officer to resign at his own will

But when the mode of election is compared with that of appointment by the executive, who cannot be personally acquainted with the merits of all the candidates, for the numerous offices in his gift, and who therefore acts, as in some of the states, upon the irresponsible recommendations which are made of candidates, to fill subordinate stations, by those who are invested with the powers of higher offices: or, as in others, upon the proposition of the judges of the county courts, who, of all men, are the least likely to be acquainted with the qualifications of the candidates, it can hardly be doubted that it has the preference. It has also this farther advantage, that men of elevated standing, who might refuse an executive appointment, when they are chosen to command by their fellow citizens, consider it as so decisive an indication of their partiality, as will hardly permit them to disregard it.

Officers who perform their military duties acceptably, become the objects of civil promotion. It is strictly a republican principle. The doors are open to all. There are as many men introduced into the municipal, county, and state offices, and into our legislative assemblies, from the militia, as from the bar. The gentlemen of the latter are fitted for them by education; and those of the former are selected from among their fellows, for that natural strength of mind and decision of character, which fit them for the acceptable performance of their duties, as officers. Those who accept commis  
  
sions are placed in situations, in which the qualities of the mind and the heart are developed, and their temper and morals disclosed. They are obliged to appear in the public presence, and thus afford, to its discerning eye, opportunities of discovering their faults, and measuring the extent of their capacities for usefulness in civil stations. Not only so: every act of their lives has relation to the promotion or disgrace to which they subject themselves, when they first take commissions. By the frequency of elections their character and conduct are brought to trial, not according to previous notice, but whenever a vacancy happens by the discharge of any of their superiors. They are, therefore, obliged to be ever watchful of their conduct. Knowing that they act at all times under its special observance, militia officers feel a responsibility that does not attach to other members of the community. All are taught to consider them as men of honour; and it is only by acting like them that they can expect a continuance of the estimation in which they are held. Every man who wears an epaulette feels, in a greater or less degree, the pride of his station. This causes him to cultivate upon all occasions, that propriety, and dignity of demeanour, which are so essential to give effect to official authority. Militia offices have much the same

The first elections are made by the citizens, from among themselves. Ensigns are put upon probation. If they are attentive to their duty, and behave with propriety, they, like other officers, are regularly promoted. It is true that the electors, in their original selections from the ranks, may be deceived in the character and talents of the persons chosen, and often are so; but, when this is the case, or officers of any rank lose their standing in society, from any cause whatever, the next election cures the evil; and the subjects of it, by the choice of their subordinates to superior stations, are induced to request their discharges, as superseded officers, which are never refused. While, therefore, from the discernment of the people, it turns out in practice, that more ensigns are superseded than all the other company officers united, it ought to’be made known, that, as our schools afford equal opportunities to all classes of the community, for obtaining a good education ; often, very often, is it, that military elections bring men of respectable talents and acquirements into the notice of society, from the humbler walks of life, who are, in consequence, enabled to display those qualities which recommend them for important civil employments.

s founders for a continuance of their aid in its support.  
  
The early habits of the people of this commonwealth prepared the way for the adoption of a militia system which differs from that of all other nations. It was engrafted on a stock, which was able to support, and which long continued to nourish it. The founders of our political constitutions anticipated its influence in support of civil government. They acted on the principle, which will stand the test of ages, that “a militia is the only safe defence of a free state.&quot; This sentiment was not confined to statesmen; but a very great proportion of the illustrious officers of this state, who, by their skills in arms, had eminently contributed to the establishment of our independence, gave their first endeavours, on the return of peace, to the improvement of the militia. The journals of the legislature shew them to have been ardently engaged in framing laws for carrying their plans into operation, and constantly urging the importance of the institution to the preservation of our civil privileges. The law of 1787, which contains the fundamental principles of those which are now in force, was drafted by the most distinguished officer of the revolutionary army, now living in this commonwealth ; and those only, who know the lax state of militia discipline, at that time, are able fully to appreciate the extent of the exertion which was required to induce the whole people to lay themselves under the restraints, which experience testifies were indispensable to its improvement. Their efforts did not terminate with their legislative labors. They joined the &quot;military company of Massachusetts&quot; for the instruction of officers; took commissions in the staff, and in the line of the militia; and upon the enactment of the law of congress of 1792, establishing its organization and discipline, by their personal exertions, assisted to carry its provisions into immediate effect. They strove to introduce into it that discipline

His short speech was delivered in a tremulous voice, with a slow and emphatic manner. He uttered the axioms, only, of political wisdom; and made a commanding nod at the close of each sentence.

That thearmy of ten thousand men,author­  
-Ized at this feflion to be raised by the state,  
was intended less to contend against the en­  
emy, than to awe the natiunal government,  
and that portion of the citizens who fted­  
faltly adbered to that government, is a fa&amp;  
too clear to be doubted. Were they want­  
ed to refit the enemy? The letter of  
Gov. Strongto Mr. Eultis, the Secretary  
of War, dated Aug. 5, 1812, answers, no.  
Gov. 8. fays : el  
¢ Every harbor or port within the state has  
a compact settlement, and generally the coun­  
try around the harbors is populous.” * The mil­  
itia are well organized, and would undoubtedly  
prefer tc defend their sire-sides, in company with  
their friends, under their own officers, rather  
than to be marched to some distant place, while  
strangers might be introduced to take their  
places at home.  
* In Boston the militia is well disciplined, and  
would be mustered in an hour, upon any signal  
of an approaching enemy, and in fix hours the  
neighboring towns could pour im a greater  
force than any invading enemy will bring a­  
ganft it. ;  
*“The {ame remark applics to Salem, Marble­  
head, and Newburyport ; places whose harbors  
render an invasion next to impossible.”  
“ Kennebunk is unassailable by any thing but  
boats, which the numerous armed population is  
competent to refilt. Portland has a militia and  
independent corps fufficiently numerous for its  
defence, and the fame is the case with Wifcaflet  
and Cafltine. [Mark Calftine.]  
“ Again(t predatory incursions the militia of  
cach place would be able to defend their proper­  
ty, and in a very short time they would be aided,  
if neceflary, by the militia of the surrounding  
country. In case of a more serious invasion,  
whole brigades or divisions could be collected  
seasonably for defence.

elements of an efficient army. We hardly accede to the full  
latitude. of General Sumner’s remark, ‘that the officers of  
the army unite in opinion, that one who has never shouldered  
a musket is a better recruit than a militiaman.? Some of  
them doubtless are selfsufficient and obstinate with their little  
proficiency, and may at first resist instruction more than one,  
whose utter ignorance induces him to surrender himself en-  
tirely to the direction of others. But, as a general rule, we

General Sumner correctly and forcibly remarks, that ‘ it  
should never be argued as an objection to the militia, that it  
is inferior to the army. The militia of no state ever was or  
ever will be its equal; the nature of the institution does not  
require it.’ p. 29. We would add, it absolutely forbids it, at

for which the militia can be kept in the field, must confine  
their proficiency within narrow bounds, and leave them far  
behind the practical, professional soldier. But surely, be

THE NECESSITY FOR ARMORIES (No. V.)  
  
HERE is very little doubt that  
  
the early habits of the people  
of this commonwealth pre-  
pared the way for the adoption of  
a military system which differs  
from that of all other nations; for  
it was engrafted upon a stock which

In its support and maintenance of  
the civil government the founders  
of our political institutions antici-  
pated its useful influence, and acted  
on the principle, which has stood  
the test of years, that ‘‘a militia is  
the only safe defence of a State.’’  
And this sentiment was not con-  
fined to our statesmen alone, for a  
very large proportion of the mili-  
tary officers of the State, who, by  
their skill in arms, had greatly con-  
tributed tothe establishment of our  
independence, gave their first en-  
deavors, on the return of peace, to  
the improvement of the militia sys-  
tem.  
  
The journals of the General  
Courts show them to have been  
constantly engaged in framing  
laws for carrying their plans for  
the improvement of the militia into  
active operation, and in assiduously  
urging the importance of the insti-  
tution to the preservation of our  
civil privileges.  
  
The law of 1787, which contains  
the fundamental principles of those  
which are even now in force, was  
drafted by the most distinguished  
officer of the Revolutionary Army,  
and nothing more is needed than  
the provisions which it seeks to en-  
force, to prove the extent of the  
exertion which was required to  
induce the whole people to subject  
themselves to the restraints which  
experience has testified were indis-  
  
(7)  
  
pensable to its improvement. Nor  
did the efforts of these patriotic  
men terminate with their legisla-  
tive labors. They joined ‘‘the  
military company of Massachu-  
setts ’’ for the instruction of officers.  
They took commissions in the staff,  
and in the line of the militia. And  
upon the enactment of the law of  
Congress of 1792, establishing its  
organization and discipline, they  
assisted by their personal endeav-  
ors in carrying its provisions into  
immediate effect. Their actions  
proved their entire confidence in  
the system they were striving t

It has always been at critical  
junctures in the history of our na-  
tion that the militia has proved it-  
self equal to the emergency that  
called them out. It is granted  
that nothing save constant disci-  
pline and drill can render them  
useful, when combined. But when  
even without these, they are left to  
the exercise of their individual in-  
telligence, they have been of signal  
service in harassing and some-  
times finally defeating the enemy.  
And where they have been skil-  
fully directed they have manifested  
an impetuosity and valor which  
have frequently enabled them to  
pluck the laurels from the brows of  
veterans. Their obstinate resist-  
ance compelled the British troops  
to return twenty miles to Boston,  
the same day they marched out  
with such confidence to destroy the  
stores at Concord. Their steady  
perseverance at Bunker Hill in-  
spired the whole country with con-

gained for them virtual victory.  
And these qualities had been care-  
fully nurtured in them from the  
moment of the landing of the Pil-  
grims at Plymouth Rock. They  
seemed to have been fully possessed  
of the value of military science,  
and the danger from the Indians  
convinced them that such knowl-  
edge should not be left to acci-  
dental acquirement.  
  
In fifteen years after their land-  
ing, Capt. Myles Standish and  
Lieut. William Holmes were ap-  
pointed ‘‘to teach the use of arms,  
for the towns of Plymouth and  
Duxbury.’’ Each of them was al-  
lowed a salary of twenty pounds  
sterling a year, ‘‘to be paid in corn  
or beaver, as it should then pass ;’’  
and as the settlement of other towns  
increased, provision in like man-  
ner was made for their instruction,  
and in order to encourage the mil-  
itary spirit, any special knowledge  
of the subject was made the ground  
of honorary titular distinctions,  
which were allowed by the express  
grant of the civil government. In-  
deed, to such an extent was this  
practice carried that, as may be  
seen from the old Colonial records,  
those who filled important civil of-  
fices were noticed by the appella-  
tion of ‘‘ Mr.’’ only, while such as  
held military commissions were  
always distinguished by the titles  
which their rank conferred. And  
it was wise that this should be so.  
Love of distinction has always ani-  
mated the average man to the most  
extraordinary exertions of which  
he is capable, and in thus minister-  
ing to this partially selfish quality  
our forefathers proved that they  
were possessed of that accurate  
knowledge of the human character  
for which they have ever since been  
  
  
  
THE NECESSITY FOR ARMORIES  
  
given credit by their descendants.  
As evidence of this we may cite the  
charter of ‘‘the school for military  
discipline,’ granted in Plymouth,  
in 1642, and inculcating many of  
those principles which are abso-  
lutely necessary for making good  
citizen soldiery. Among other  
things it provides :  
  
‘“That the officers should be  
chosen by the Association, and ap-  
proved by the Court.  
  
‘‘’&#x27;That their exercises should be  
begun and ended with prayer.  
  
‘“That they should have a ser-  
mon preached to them once a year,  
on the election of their officers.  
  
‘‘That none should be received  
into the company but such as were  
honest, and of good report — free-  
men, and not servants — and that  
they should be well appfoved by  
the officers and the majority of the  
company.  
  
‘*’That every man who should be  
admitted as a member should be  
subject to the command of his of-  
ficers; and every delinquent, and  
those who should not keep silence,  
or who exercised jeering, fighting,  
or quarelling, should be adjudged  
guilty of a misdemeanor, and pun-  
ished according to the order of mil-  
itary discipline, and the nature of  
the offence.  
  
‘That every man who should be  
absent, except on good occasion,  
or the hand of God was upon him,  
should pay for his default ; and if  
he refused he should be distrained,  
and put out of the list.  
  
‘That every man who entered  
the military list, and did not pro-  
vide his arms, should be put out of  
the list; and that all who came  
with defective arms should be fined  
sixpence for each article deficient.  
  
‘“That all that are, or shall be  
elected, chief officers of the mili-  
tary company shall be so titled, and  
forever afterwards be so reputed,  
unless he obtain a higher place.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
‘““That if any member of the  
company die, the members shall  
assemble with their arms, upon  
warning, and inter his corpse as a  
soldier, according to his place and  
qualitie.  
  
‘‘That none should be taken  
into the company without being  
propounded, one meeting before  
they shall be received, and that  
none should be admitted who should  
not first take the oath of fidelity.’’  
  
These same principles were con-  
tained in the grant of the first mil-  
itary company in Massachusetts, in  
1638, which company, the Ancient  
and ‘Honorable Artilery, was, in  
1823, composed of between two and  
three hundred members, who were  
principally active officers of the  
staff, and in the line of the militia.  
They frequently met together, for  
drill and mutual instruction, and  
the names of some of the most dis-  
  
tinguished military commanders in °  
  
our early history are still borne  
upon its rolls. On their public  
ceremonies, performed then as now  
according to the requisitions of their  
ancient charter, and on the day of  
their annual election of officers,  
the patronage of all the branches of  
the civil government had a most de

The elective principle was early  
applied to our military institutions,  
because the people regarded a mil-  
itary system of any kind as at the  
same time most important to the  
preservation of their civil rights,  
and the most dangerous to their  
perpetuation, and, therefore, chose  
to keep the absolute control of it in  
theirown hands. The aggressions  
upon the citizens, just before the  
Revolution, by the British troops,  
whose officers received their ap-  
pointments from the Crown, con-  
firmed the favorable opinion of this  
principle which the fathers already

entertained, and induced them to  
incorporate it into their form of  
government. It was provided that  
the privates should choose their  
company officers, and that the cap-  
tains and the subalterns should  
elect the field officers. These latter  
were made the electors of their re-  
spective brigadiers-general; and  
the two branches of the General  
Court, by a concurrent vote, des-  
ignated the person upon whom the  
Governor should confer the re-  
sponsible and important position of  
major-general. Thus it was that  
in all cases the power was lodged  
with those who not only had the  
greatest interest in the choice, but  
who were also the best judges of  
the requisite qualifications for  
whatever office it might become  
necessary to fill. The idea of a  
regular promotion, from the lowest  
to the highest station, operated as  
an inducement for the subordinate  
officers to hold their commissions  
for some years, with a view to the  
attainment of the honors and the  
distinctions of a higher rank. It  
was seldom that an officer was su-  
perseded without adequate cause,  
while the power of the electors to  
carry removal into effect, whenever  
a vacancy occurred, was a contin-  
ual stimulus to the ambitious to  
qualify themselves for the duties of  
the stations they occupied, as well  
as for those of a more distinguished  
place. Lawswerealso passed whic

these served as additional motives  
for the officers to continue in com-

which they had placed themselves,  
—when the men, ashamed of their  
folly, requested their incompetent  
officers to resign. We can scarcely  
doubt that this mode of election,  
even with its liability to abuse, is  
far preferable to the appointment  
of the officers by the Governor.  
He cannot be personally acquainted  
  
  
  
  
  
THE NECESSITY FOR ARMORIES  
  
with the merits of all the candi-  
dates for the various positions ;  
and he would therefore have to  
act, as is done in some of the States,  
upon the irresponsible recommenda-  
tions which the applicants might  
file. The elective system has this  
further merit and advantage,—that  
men of elevated standing might re-  
fuse to accept an executive ap-  
pointment, while they would hesi-  
tate to disregard an election by  
their fellow men.  
  
Another benefit which it was  
thought resulted from the applica-  
tion of this elective principle, was  
that officers who acceptably per-  
formed their military duties, quick-  
ly became the objects of promotion  
in the civil grade. It was looked  
upon as strictly a republican prin-  
ciple, in which the doors were open  
to all. There were as many de-  
serving men introduced into the  
municipal, State,and county offices,  
and into the General Court, from  
the militia as from the bar. And  
such promotion, too, was deemed  
an honor of higher degree. For  
the latter were fitted for their oc-  
cupation by a long course of study  
and education; while the former  
were selected from among their fel-  
low citizens on account of their  
natural strength of mind and de-  
cision of character. Those who  
accepted military commissions were  
placed in situations which plainly  
developed their qualities of mind  
and heart, and disclosed their tem-  
per and moral appreciation. They  
were obliged to appear in the pub-  
lic presence, and thus afford to its  
discerning eye full opportunity to  
discover their faults, and to meas-  
ure their capacity for usefulness in  
civil place; thus obliging them to  
be always watchful of their con-  
duct, and to realize that every act  
of their lives would be considered  
to bear some relation to either the  
promotion or the disgrace to which,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
when they first accepted commis-  
sions, they subjected themselves.  
By the frequency of the elections  
their character and behavior were  
practically brought to trial; and  
not according to previous notice,  
but whenever a vacancy happened  
by the discharge of any of their  
superiors. Knowing that their ac-  
tions would be at all times under  
this special observance, militia offi-  
cers felt a degree of personal respon-  
sibility which did not attach to other  
members of the community. All  
their fellow citizens were taught to  
consider them as men of honor ; and  
it was only by acting as if they really  
were such, that they could expect a  
continuance of the estimation in  
which they were held. Every man  
who wore an epaulette was con-  
scious of the pride of station, to a  
greater or a less degree, which  
caused him to cultivate, upon all  
occasions, that propriety and dig-  
nity of demeanor so essential to  
give effect to official authority.  
The primary elections were made  
by the people, from among them-  
selves. Ensigns were put upon pro-  
bation. If they were attentive to  
their duties, and bore themselves  
with propriety, they, like other  
officers, were regularly promoted.  
Of course it was possible that the  
electors, in their original selections  
from the ranks, might be deceived  
in the character and the talent of  
the persons they picked out. But  
when this was the case, or officers  
of any rank lost their standing in  
society, from any cause whatever,  
the election next in order would be  
sure to cure the evil; and the sub-  
jects of it were induced to request  
their discharges, as superseded off-  
cers, which were never refused.  
While, therefore, from the discern-

vasion might be threatened, and  
able to repel it, unless it should be  
made by a fleet of heavy ships,
