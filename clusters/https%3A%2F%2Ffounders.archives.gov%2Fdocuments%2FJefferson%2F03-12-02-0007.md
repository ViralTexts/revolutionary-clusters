COMFULHOBT EDUCATION.  
A queotioH of some doubt, might lie  
raised on the latter part of this sec­  
tion as to the rights and duties of so­  
ciety towards its members, infant and  
adult. Is it a right or a duty in soci­  
ety to take care of their’ infant mem­  
bers in opposition to the will of the  
parent? How far does this right and  
duty extend? to guard the life of the  
infant, his property, his instruction,  
his morals? The Boman lather was  
supreme in all these; we draw a line,  
but where? public sentiment doesnot  
seem to have traced it precisely.  
.What is proposed hv:c is to remove  
the objection to the expense by mak­  
ing gratis, and to strengthen parental  
excitement by the disfranchisement  
of his child while uneducated. Soci­  
ety has certainly a right to disavow  
him whom they offer and arc not jiei­  
mltted to qualify for the duties of  
citizenship. Ik we no not force in­  
struction let us at least strengthen  
the MOTIVE TO BECEIVE IT WHEN OF­  
FERED.—Thomas Jefferson.  
We have heard of quite a great deal  
of objection to our new election law
