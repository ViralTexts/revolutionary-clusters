, but the fact, extraordinary as it is, is unquestionable. No man living, out of your own family, has been admitted to so near an intimacy with your heart as you indulged to me for the purpose of furnishing me with materials for the renovation of sound principles in the minds of my countrymen, and for resussitating your reputation after your decease. I allude to your communications in the years 1803–4–and 9. I do not mean to say, that like Despreaux and Racine, I was appoin

I have thus accounted for the unreservedness with which you have revealed yourself to me on the various principles and characters imbibed and extolled by your countrymen; and distinguishing those principles you which had wrought such wonderful effects in the  twelve years they guided the National Government, and which you had chosen to have associated with your name by generations to come. How fortunate for these principles! How auspicious to the fame of their advocates! How damning to the adverse side!

.  
Look at your Defence of the Constitutions of the United States— Look at your Communications to Congress, and Answers to Addresses—Look at your Letters to me in the years 1803–4, and say which are the “sentiments under your own hand,” we must regard as “wise plans and generous efforts,” those, which at the periods referred to, you inculcated, or those which you are now propping? Of the alternatives in the answer you may make your election. You “cannot buckle your distemper’d cause with the belt of rule.”  
“Honest and generous spirits will disdain to deceive the people.” I need not tell you where this compliment to integrity is recorded; but what sort of spirit is he who, because he is not Cicero will attach himself to Cataline? What he, who because he is not Augustus till to the hour of “give me your applause,” will forfeit his title to commendation by repairing to the standard of Anthony? What he, whose heart is like the fountain of the Scamandar, pouring out from one side a stream smoking as it rolls, and from the other, a stream stiffened with cold, and rattling with the loose pieces of congealed water? This you will understand as referring to your treatment of the Federalists, the heads of whom you pursue with virulence, while you look with coldness on the great body, and call them “Nothing”  
Not wishing to fatigue you with quotations from your own works, I shall leave to your memory to supply the omission of much applicable matter.  
“Some eminent spirit, assisted by two three or four families connected with him, gains an ascendency, and excites an enthusiasm, and then the spirit and letter, too, of the Constitution is made to give way to him.” Def. Cons. Vol. III. p. 246. Have you not in your Letters to me characterized Mr. Jefferson as such a leading spirit? Have you not also mentioned Mr. Madison as his confederate a brother of the same principle? Have you not particularized many more of the seducing spirits who were defrauding the public credulity? Have you not said that the spirit, and letter too of the Constitution, have fell before them? Have you not laid to the charge of Genet, that he was the principal of the mob which beset Gen. Washington in his house at Philadelphia. And have you not since, in the public papers, passed high encomims on Messrs. Jefferson, and Madison; and even set this Genet, this man whom you exultingly told me in Philadelphia, that your son John had laid upon his back, and whom you yourself then loaded with all that obloquy which you can throw out so roundly when roused—even this Genet, sent here to war upon the American Government under Washington, and whom you branded as the vilest incendiary that ever lived, and whose exposure by your son was so pleasing to you, that you told me in your Letter of Oct. 15. 1808, that “not all Washington’s ministers, Hamilton and Pickering included, could have written the Papers which were so fatal to Genet,” as those written by him,—even this Genet, and perhaps the more earnestly for his revolutionary adroitness, you have attempted to set before the American People as a Patriot! Here are your words as contained in your Letter to the Printers which appeared Sep. 16. 1809. You speak first of the father, and say:—“He spoke the English language with great propriety and facility; was a man of letters and an excellent writer, a zealous advocate for America, and very friendly to all Americans.” To crown the climax of his desert, and in this way to eulogize the Son, you add—“He was the father of Mr. Genet, the Minister of the French Republic to the United States, who has been so much celebrated in this Country, has married into one of our  most illustrious families, and still resides here.” Gracious Heaven! that a man of seventy five, who has been caressed by his country, and enjoyed its highest honours, could use his Reason as a thing to sport with, as a musician a pipe with stops; and for the same purpose, that the musician varies his tones—to please the ear of a fickle multitude. Or  
“To face the garment of rebellion  
With some fine colour that may please the eye  
Of fickle changlings, and poor discontents,  
Which gape, and rub the elbow, at the news  
Of hurly-burly innovation.”  
You observed in a Letter of Feb. 11. 1809, that “we have had a Shays’ disturbance—a Gallatin’s disturbance—a Fries’ disturbance.” And are you not yourself employed on “Themes of insurrection’s arguing.”  
In an Answer to the Address of the Officers of the first Brigade, of the Third Division, of the Militia of Massachusetts.” You thus describe “The Dangers of American Liberty.” “Avarice, Ambition, Revenge and Gallantry, would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net.” Revenge is one of these strong-handed foes

ll attested by the expressions applied to the negotiations with France:—“This conduct should not have brought upon me disgrace”—and:—“Why did the Federalists try to render me unpopular for this? They ought to have known that there was not another man in the union that they could carry.”  
You offer in excuse for Manlius the infirmities of humanity. You have said to me of yourself, in answer to an entreaty to act with more elevation of character, that you “confess human nature” are you not fortifying your maxims with your own practises?  
There is much more which you have rendered useful as a key applied to yourself. “The people by their elections will continue the Government generally in the same families from generation to generation. Descent from certain families will eternally have such an influence over the affections and imaginations of the people, as no arts, or institutions of policy will controul. Time will come when these circumstances will have more influence over great numbers of minds than any considerations of virtue and talents, and whatever influences numbers is of great moment in popular governments, and in all elections.” These

 assigned as one reason for your advice, that the office “is a carbuncle shining in the dark.” A strange description for a Republican to make of the highest office in the State! Another reason was, that “the compensation is not a living for a common gentleman.” Pray what did you mean by the Avarice which can break the strongest cords of our Constitution? Very probably—“The Dangers of American Liberty,”—applied to Revenge, Ambition and Avarice will not prove “a misnomer.”  
You have the read the In the standing code of corrupt Ambition, you have read the command.  
…Be great,  
With Praise or Infamy, leave that to fate;  
Get place and Wealth if possible with grace,  
If not, by any means, get Wealth and Place.”  
It is an Expositor as well as a Rule.  
“There are conjunctures when it is the duty of every good citizen to hazard and sacrifice all to his country,” this you said yourself; and having, moreover, your concession that such a conjuncture is created here, the precept shall be to you, the apology for my practice.  
“Yes, while I live, no rich or noble…  
Shall walk the world in credit to his grave;  
To Virtue only, and her friends a friend,   
The world beside may murmur or commend.”  
These lines are a continuation of a passage contained in one of your Letters, under the shelter of which you placed yourself; but as you did not use marks of quotation, and had changed some of the words, and the arrangement, I treated them as your own.  
How is the conjuncture, which commands the sacrifice of every thing to our Country, constituted? By enmity to England, and a love of France—by  
“The very extacy of Love,  
Whose violent property foredoes itself,  
And leads the will to desperate undertaking,  
As oft as any passion under heaven.”  
But the enmity and the love, are both fomented and fed in the bosom of a majority of the people, and having grown to a head their propagators the inflamers of them dare not attempt to disperse, they determine to leave them to a suppuration. Have they forgotten the declaration of Buonaparte himself, to his Brother of England, that “The fate, of all civilized nations is attached to the termination of a war which involves the whole world?” But our Plan, and our Places!

tion planned by the Monticellonian. He is our Silentiarius, and it might be better on the score of economy, to invest him with a right to dictate, than to pay for so much dribbling in debate as  trickles in our halls of legislation. This reflection on our spouters is not one-sided. The Ulema, I mean the small fry of the order, make on either side, a most despicable figure. What connection is there between assault and battery, and wounds on our national honor? What between actions in assumsit and those wholly assumed? What between Quare Clausum Freget, and trespasses on our commerce and the violation of Treaties? “The tribe of vulgar politicians, are the lowest of our species. There is no trade so vile and mechanical as Government in their hands.”  
The plan of administration pursued by Mr. Jefferson, had the help of France primarily in view. What will happen in the farther pursuit of this plan, and before we arrive at its ultimate consequence, is an enquiry of much circuit and uncertainty—We must actually go the round before we can answer. The war of sentiment, fiercely waged, produces that of the sword, which, “in its progress methodises its own course.” Hence the hopes of the aspiring.

ddered at the calamities which he was preparing for his country from a mean thirst of popularity, an inordinate ambition and a want of sincerity.” Since then you have declared your predictions verified; and since making this declaration, you have become his Eulogist! What is there that Ambition, a thirst of Popularity, and Insincerity, will not perform? You compared Mr. Jefferson, with others, to Lovelace, and the people to Clarissa—and said—“The artful villain will pursue the lovely girl to her ruin and her death.” This is the painting of your own pencil. Whose likeness can you trace in it?  
I mentioned in my last, that the intimations therein contained should be a shield against the censure of yourself and family. These intimations related principally to two characters. You shall now know my meaning explicitly. First of Mr. Pickering.  
In your Letter to me of Nov. 7th. 1808, you remark, that the Letters of this gentleman to the Legislature of this Commonwealth “shew the character of the man bitter and malignant; ignorant and jesuitical.” In the same Letter, you accuse him of “Intrigues with Senators which led the Senate into violations of the Constitution.” You call him “a man in a mask, sometimes of silk, sometimes of iron, and sometimes of brass.” By which you intended to describe him as a Proteus. In your Letter of Nov. 15. of the same year, you charge him with exceeding any other man you ever knew in “a contempt of Washington.” “Yet now,” you go on and say, “he appears to the world a devout adorer of him.” In the same Letter, and in the one of Feb. 22d. 1809, you say of him, “No man was a more animated advocate for the French, even to the highest strain of Jacobinism and king–killing; yet now he is as ardent in th his attachment to the English.” In your Letter of March 4. you mention, that “the British practice of searching our ships of war, as well as our merchantmen for seamen, was one great point on which he was pleased to differ in opinion from you;” and

How much contempt has at any time been expressed of Washington, you have had better opportunities of knowing then I have. You know how much detraction was vented by Duane, Giles, and other hairbrained partizans of France. Did Gen. Pickering outdo these disparagers in contempt of Washington? Did he more than call him “the source of our misfortunes?” Did he more than call him “a conspirator against public liberty?” Did he more than rejoice at his death? Did he more than say, that the day of his death “ought to be a day of Jubilee in the United States?” If he did, let him be damned forever. Let no ray of mercy ever reach him.  
The excesses of the most violent in favour of France you have described, much at large, in your Letter of Oct. 15. 1808. Toasting the Revolutionary madcaps of France—exciting an insurrection in Philadelphia to curse and menace Washington. Demanding War against England, and an Alliance with France.   
Mr. Pickering You alledge against Mr. Pickering, that he rose to the highest point of this ardency for France—To the highest pitch of this inveteracy against England. Such conduct, in a private citizen, might have found some apology in a thoughtless enthusiasm for Liberty; but would have been inexcuseable in a Member of the Government.  
But what have you taught me, by your condemnation of Gen. Pickering, to think of yourself? Have I not your explicit declaration, that instead of wielding the pen to vindicate your pretension to a merit above Mr. Jay in the negociations of 1783, you have taken it in hand to keep alive a Gallic mania in this Country, in opposition to the leading Federalists with whom, at the period above referred to, you acted in concert—and you are now inflaming the people with this madness in co–operation with the very leading Jacobins to whom, at that period, you were in opposition! Surely this is a wandering which is bereft of the palliation of a virtuous but mistaken zeal.
