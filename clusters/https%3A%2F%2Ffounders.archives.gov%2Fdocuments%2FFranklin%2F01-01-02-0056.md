Burlington, Oct. 12. Saturday last at Mount-Holly, about 8 Miles from this Place, near 300 People were gathered together to see an Experiment or two tried on some Persons accused of Witchcraft. It seems the Accused had been charged with making their Neighbours Sheep dance in an uncommon Manner, and with causing Hogs to speak, and sing Psalms, &amp;c. to the great Terror and Amazement of the King’s good and peaceable Subjects in this Province; and the Accusers being very positive that if the Accused were weighed in Scales against a Bible, the Bible would prove too heavy for them; or that, if they were bound and put into the River, they would swim; the said Accused desirous to make their Innocence appear, voluntarily offered to undergo the said Trials, if 2 of the most violent of their Accusers would be tried with them. Accordingly the Time and Place was agreed on, and advertised about the Country; The Accusers were 1 Man and 1 Woman; and the Accused the same. The Parties being met, and the People got together, a grand Consultation was held, before they proceeded to Trial; in which it was agreed to use the Scales first; and a Committee of Men were appointed to search the Men, and a Committee of Women to search the Women, to see if they had any Thing of Weight about them, particularly Pins. After the Scrutiny was over, a huge great Bible belonging to the Justice of the Place was provided, and a Lane through the Populace was made from the Justices House to the Scales, which were fixed on a Gallows erected for that Purpose opposite to the House, that the Justice’s Wife and the rest of the Ladies might see the Trial, without coming amongst the Mob; and after the Manner of Moorfields, a large Ring was also made. Then came out of the House a grave tall Man carrying the Holy Writ before the supposed Wizard, &amp;c. (as solemnly as the Sword-bearer of London before the Lord Mayor) the Wizard was first put in the Scale, and over him was read a Chapter out of the Books of Moses, and then the Bible was put in the other Scale, (which being kept down before) was immediately let go; but to the great Surprize of the Spectators, Flesh and Bones came down plump, and outweighed that great good Book by abundance. After the same Manner, the others were served, and their Lumps of Mortality severally were too heavy for Moses and all the Prophets and Apostles. This being over, the Accusers and the rest of the Mob, not satisfied with this Experiment, would have the Trial by Water; accordingly a most solemn Procession was made to the Mill-pond; where both Accused and Accusers being stripp’d (saving only to the Women their Shifts) were bound Hand and Foot, and severally placed in the Water, lengthways, from the Side of a Barge or Flat, having for Security only a Rope about the Middle of each, which was held by some in the Flat. The Accuser Man being thin and spare, with some Difficulty began to sink at last; but the rest every one of them swam very light upon the Water. A Sailor in the Flat jump’d out upon the Back of the Man accused, thinking to drive him down to the Bottom, but the Person bound, without any Help, came up some time before the other. The Woman Accuser, being told that she did not sink, would be duck’d a second Time; when she swam again as light as before. Upon which she declared, That she believed the Accused had bewitched her to make her so light, and that she would be duck’d again a Hundred Times, but she would duck the Devil out of her. The accused Man, being surpriz’d at his own Swimming, was not so confident of his Innocence as before, but said, If I am a Witch, it is more than I know. The more thinking Part of the Spectators were of Opinion, that any Person so bound and plac’d in the Water (unless they were mere Skin and Bones) would swim till their Breath was gone, and their Lungs fill’d with Water. But it being the general Belief of the Populace, that the Womens Shifts, and the Garters with which they were bound help’d to support them; it is said they are to be tried again the next warm Weather, naked

TSurtington, October 12.  
Saturday last, at Mount Holley, about  
eight miles from this place, near 300 peo­  
ple were gathered to see an experiment  
on two trials on some persons accused  
of witchcraft. It seems the&#x27;accttsed hati  
J been charged with making their neigh­  
bor&#x27;s sheep tiance in an uncommon man­  
ner, and with causing hogs to speak and  
psalm, &lt;kc. to the great terror and amuse­  
ment of the king’s good and peaceful  
subjects in this province, anti the accus­  
ers being very positive that if the accus­  
ed were wt ighed in scales against a Bi­  
ble, the Ilible would prove too heavy for  
them ; r.r that if they were bound tip and  
put in the river thry would swim ; in*  
said accused desirous of making their  
innocence appear, voluntarily offered to  
undergo the said trials, if two of the most  
violent of their accusers would botriei  
with them.  
-Accordingly the time and place was  
1 agreed on, anti advertised about the coun­  
J try ; the accusers were one man and one  
| woman, and titu accused the same. The  
■ parties being met, and the people got  
together, a gre.it consultation was held  
before they proceeded to trial, in which  
it was agreed muss the scales first ; and  
a committee of men were appointed to  
search the men, and a committee of wo­  
men to search the women, to see if they  
bad any thing of weight about them, par­  
ticularly pins. After the scrutiny was  
over, a huge g&quot;eat Bible, belonging to  
the justice of the place, was provided,  
and a iane through the populace was  
made, from tire justice’s house to the  
scales, which were fixed on a gallows  
erected lor that purpose, opposite to the  
house, that the justices.wife and the rest  
of the ladies might see&#x27;the trial without  
coining among the mob; and after the  
manner of Moot fields, a large ring was  
made. Then came out of the house a  
| grave tall man carrying the Holy Writ  
I iaefore the supposed wizard,-Sec. (as  
solemnly as the sword hearer of London  
before the Lord Mayor.) The wizard  
was first put into scales, and over him  
was read a chapter out of the hook of  
I -.loses, and then the Bible was put in the  
other scale, (which being kept down be­  
fore) was immediately let go, but to the  
great surprise ofihe spectators, flesh and  
blood canio down plump, and out-weigh­  
ed the great and good book by abun­  
dance. After the same manner the  
others were served, and their lumps of  
mortality severally were too heavy for  
A/ores and all the prophets and apostles.  
This being over, the accusers and the  
j rest of the mob, not satisfied with this ex­  
; periment, would have the trial by water ;  
1 accordingly a most solemn procession ]  
I was made to the mill-pond, where both  
accusers and accused were stripped,  
(saving only the womens’ shifts) were  
bound hand and foot and severally placed  
in the water, lengthwise, from the side  
of a barge or il it, having for security on­  
ly c rope about the middle ofearb, which  
was held by some in the flat. The ac­  
cused man being thin anti spare, nidi!  
some difficulty began to sink at last; but j  
  
. the rest every ore of them, swam very  
; light upon the water. A sailor in the  
j flat jumped out upon the hack of the  
j man accused, thinking to drive him down  
. to the bottom ; but the person bound  
! without any help, came up some time be­  
fore the other. The woman arcused be­  
ing told that if she did not sink, site  
would be duck’d a second time, swam  
again as light as before, upon which she  
declared that she believed the accuser  
had bewitched her to make her so light,  
and that she would be duck’d again a  
hundred times but site would duck the  
, devil out of her. The accused man be­  
ing surprised at bis own swimming, was  
not so confident of his innocence as be­  
fore, but said, if I am a witch, it is more  
than I know. The more thinking part  
&#x27; of the spectators were of the opinion that  
| any peison so bound and placed in the  
water (unless they were skin and bones)  
would switn till their breath was gone,  
and their lungs filled with water. But it  
being the general belief of the populace  
that the women’s shifts and the garters  
with which they were bound helped to  
support them, it is said they are to bo  
tried again the next warm weather  
naked

from the Pennsylvania Gazette for Oc­  
tober 22, 1730, printed in this city by  
B. Franklin.  
BURLINGTON&#x27;, OCT. 12.  
Saturday last, at Mount Holly, about  
8 miles from this place, near 800 peo­  
ple were gathered together to see an  
experiment or two tried on some per­  
sons accused of witchcraft. It seems  
the accused had been charged with  
  
nuking their neighbors sheep danct j  
in an uncommon manner, and with  
causing hogs to speak, sing psalms, he.  
to the great terror and amusement of  
the good and peaceable subjects in this  
province, and the accusers being very  
positive that if the accused were weigh­  
ed in scales against a Bible, the Bible  
would prove too heavy for them ; or  
if they were bound up and put in the  
river, they would swim ; the said ac­  
cused, desirous to make their inno­  
cence appear, voluntarily offered to  
undergo the said trials if two of the  
most violent of their accusers would  
be tried with them.  
Accordingly the time and place was  
agreed on, and advertised about the  
country ; the accusers were one man  
and one wotvun, and the accused the  
same. The parties being met, and the  
people got together, a great consulta­  
tion was held before they proceeded  
to trial, in which it was agreed to use  
the scales first ; and a committee of  
men were appointed to search the  
men, and a committee of women to  
search the women, to see if they had  
any thing of weight about them, par­  
ticularly pins. After the scrutiny was  
over, a huge great bible, belonging to  
the justice of the place, was provided,  
and a lane through the populace w as  
made, from the justice&#x27;s bouse to the  
scales, which were fixed on a gahows  
erected for that purpose, opposite to  
the house, that the justice&#x27;s wife and  
the rest of the ladies, might see the  
trial without coming among the mob,  
and after the manner i(.thc-Moor-fields,  
a large ring was made. Then  
came outnf the house a grave tall man  
carrying the Holy writ before the sup­  
posed witch, ?cc. (as solemnly as the  
sword bearer of London before the  
Lord Mayor.) The wizard wa3 first  
put into the scales, and over him was  
read a chapter out of the boo&#x27;; of  
Moses, and then the bible was put in­  
to the other scale, (which being kept  
down before,) was immediately let go,  
but to the great surprise of the spec­  
tators, flesh and blood came down  
plump and outweighed the great good  
book in abundance. After the same  
manner, the others were served, and  
their lumps ot mortalilv sever.ulv were  
too heavy for mosct and all the proph­  
ets and apostles. This being over,  
the accusers and the rest of the mob,  
not satisfied with this experiment  
would have the trial bv water; accor  
ally placed in the water, .lengthwise,  
from the side of a barge or flat, hav  
ing for security only a rope about the  
middle of each, which was held by  
some in the flat. The accuser man  
being thin and spare, with some diffi­  
culty began to sink at last ; the rest  
every one of them, swam very light  
upon the water. A sailor jumped out  
upon the back of the m.ui accused,  
thinking to drive htm dow n to the bot-  
&#x27;torn : biit the person bound, without  
an help, came up some time before the  
&#x27;other. The w oman accuser being told  
(that if she did not sink, she would be  
iducked a second time, swam a-rain as  
light as before, upon which she de  
clared the accused had bewitched lu r  
to make her so fight, and that she  
would be ducked again a hundred times  
but she would duck the devil out of her.  
The accused man being surprised at  
his own swimming, was notsoconft­  
dent of his ow n innocence as before, but  
said, f I am a witch, it is more than  
I knoM. The more thinking part ci  
the spectators were of opinion that any

“Saturday last at Mount Holly, about eig u  
miles from this place, near three hundred people  
were gathered to see an experiment or twotiie  
on some persons accused ot w tchcra •  
seems the accused hadbeen charge vu^»

and sin«r psaims, etc., to the y e .  
amazement of the K&#x27;.ne* ‘.rood and peaceable  
subjectstn th s provmo, t! e accusers being very  
positive that if the accused were weighed »u  
Sklk against a Bible, shat the Bible woul.l  
prove too heavy for them, or if the, were bourn!  
and put in the creek, they would swim—the  
aaid accused, desirous to make their innocence  
appear, voluntarily offered to undergo the ^aiu  
trials, if two of the mo-t violent of their accu­  
sers would he tried with them  
Accordingly the time and place were agreed on  
and advertised about the country: the accusers  
were one man and one woman: ami the nc&lt; u —  
ed the same. The paities hemg met, and the  
people got together, a grand consultation was  
held before they proceeded to trial, in J&#x27;btch 1  
was agreed to use the scales first: and a tori­  
millee of men were appointed to search the  
men. and so also the women to see i they  
had anything of weight about them, paiticu.a \
pins.  
After the scrutiny was over, a huge great Bi­  
ble, belonging to the Justice &lt;H the Peace was  
provided, and a lane was made from tae Jus­  
tice s to the scales which were fixed on a gal­  
lows erected express y lor that purpose right  
opposite to the hou-e, that the Justices wi.e  
ami the rest of the lb lie- might *ee the trial,  
without coming amongst the mob; and at:et tne  
manner of Mooifields, a large ring was at o  
made. Then caine out of the house a grave  
tall man, carrying the Holy W rit before the sup­  
posed wizard,’etc., {as solemnly as the sword  
hearer of Loudon before the Lord Ma\ur.)­  
The wizard was first put into the scale, and  
over him was read a chapter out ot the book  
of Moses, and then the Bible was put in the  
other scale, which being *^pl down t»etoie, wa&gt;  
immediately let ^ hut to the great surprise of  
the spectators, fle^h and bones came down  
plump, and out weighed that great good hook by  
abundance.  
After the same manner, others were serve^.  
and their lumps ot mortal ty severally were  
too heavy for the big book—plump they came  
clown. . 4l .  
This being over, the accusers and tne mob.  
not satisfied with this experiment, would have  
the trial by water; accordingly a most -oleum  
procession wasma le to the null; ond, a bet® ho* h  
accused and accusers, being partially shipped  
of their clothing, were bound hand apd toot, anu  
each placed in the water, length ways from the  
side of a barge, h iv ng for security a rope about  
the middle of each which was held bv a person  
in the barge The accuse 1 man being thin  
and spare, with some difficulty began to sink at  
last, but the other three -warn very lightly upon  
the water. A sailor in the barge jumped out

in this province; the accusers being very posi­  
tive that if the accused were weighed in scales  
against a Bible, that the Bible would prove too

After the scrutiny was over a huge great Bible  
belonging to the Justice of the Peace was pro­

the scales which was fixed on a gallows erected  
expressly for that purpose right opposite to the

From the Penns; lvania Gtz, tte, Oct. 22 1730.  
WITCHCRAFT.  
Burlington October 12,1730.  
Saturday last at Mount-Holly, about  
eight miles from this place, near throe  
hundred people were gathered together  
to seo an experiment or two tried on  
some persons accused of Witchcraft.  
It seems the accused had been charged  
with making their neighbour’s sheep  
dance in an uncommon manner, and  
causing hogs to speak and sing psalms,  
&amp;e., to the great terror and amazement  
of the King’s good and peaceable sub­  
jects in this province; the accusers be­  
ing very positive that if the accused  
were weighed in scales against a bible,  
would prove too heavy for them; or  
that if they were bound and put into  
the creek they would swim; the said  
accused desirous to make their inno­  
cence appear, voluntarily offered to  
undergo the said trials, if two of the  
most violent of their accusers would  
be tried with them. Accordingly the  
time and place was agreed on, and ad­  
vertised about the country; the ac­  
cusers were one man and one woman;  
and the accused the same. The par­  
ties being met and the people got to­  
gether, a grand consultation was held,  
before they proceeded to trial; in  
which it was agreed to use the scales  
first; and a committee of men were ap­  
pointed to search the men. and so also  
the women, to see if t hey had any­  
thing of weight about them, particu­  
larly pins. After the scrutiny was  
over, a huge great bible belonging to  
the Justice of the place was provided,  
and a lane through the populace was  
made from the Justice’s house to the  
scales, which were fixed on a Gallows  
erected for that purpose oposite to the  
house, . that the Justice’s wife and the  
rest of the ladies might see the trial,  
without comming amongst the mob;  
and after the manner of Moornelds, a  
large ring was also made. Then came  
out of the house a grave tall man  
carrying the Holy Writ before the  
supposed wizard, Ac., (as solemnly as  
the sword-bearer of London before the  
Lord Mayor) the Wizard was first put  
into the scale, and over him war read  
a chapter out of the books of Moses,  
and then the bible was put in the&#x27;,  
other scale, (which being kept down  
before) was immediately let go; but toj  
the great surprise of the spectator,&#x27;  
flesh and bones came down plump*  
and out-weighed that great good book  
by abundance.  
After the same manner, the others  
were served, and their lumps of mor.  
tality severally were too heavy for the  
book—plump they came down,  
j, TUB being over. Hie *a*uau» tu&gt;4  
the mob, not satisfied with this experi­  
ment, would have the trial by water;  
accordingly a most solemn procession  
was made to the mill pond; where  
both accused and accusers being strip­  
pod (saving only to the women their  
shift) were bound hand and foot, and  
severally placed in the water, length­  
ways from the side of a barge, having  
for security a rope about the middle of  
each, which was held by some in the  
barge. The accused man being thin  
and spare, with difficulty began to sink  
at last; but the other three swam very  
light upon the water. A sailor in the  
barge jumped out upon the back of the  
man accused, thinking to drive him  
down to the bottom; but the person  
bound, without any help, came up  
some time before&quot; the other. The  
woman accuser, being told that she did  
not sink, would b.e ducked a second  
time; when she swam as light as be  
fore. Upon which she declared, that  
she believed the accused had be­  
witched her to make her so light, and  
that she would be ducked a hundred  
times, but she would duck the devil  
out of her. The accused man being  
snrprised at his own swimming, was  
not so confident of ids innocence as  
before, but said, if 1 am a Witch it is  
more -ban I know. The more think­  
ing part of the spectators were of opin­  
ion that any person so bonud and  
placed in the water (unless tbev were  
mere skin and bone) would sw’im till  
their breath was gone, and their lungs  
were filled with water. But it being  
the general belief of the populace that  
the women’s shifts and the garters with  
which they were bound helped to sup­  
port them, it is said thev are to be  
tried again the nex* warm weather  
naked

OFFiCre — Burlington, Oct 12. — Saturday last at Mount-Holly, about 8  
Miles from this Place, near 300 People were gathered together to see an  
Experiment or two tried on some Persons accused of Witchcraft. It seems  
the Accused had been charged with making their Neighbours Sheep dance  
in an uncommon Manner, and with causing Hogs to speak, and sing  
Psalms, etc., to the great Terror and Amazement of the King’s good and  
peaceable Subjects in this Province, and the Accusers being very positive  
that if the Accused were weighed in Scales against a Bible, the Bible would  
prove too heavy for them; or that, if they were bound and put into the  
River, they would swim ; the said Accused desirous to make their Inno-  
cence appear, voluntarily offered to undergo the said Trials, if 2 of the  
most violent of their Accusers would be tried with them. Accordingly the  
Time and Place was agreed on, and advertised about the Country ; The  
Accusers were 1 Man and 1 Woman; and the Accused the same. The  
Parties being met, and the People got together, a grand Consultation was  
held, before they proceeded to Trial; in which it was agreed to use the  
Scales first ; and a Committee of Men were appointed to search the Men,  
and a Committee of Women to search the Women, to see if they had any  
Thing of Weight about them, particularly Pins. After the Scrutiny was  
over, a huge great Bible belonging to the Justice of the Place was provided,  
and a Lane through the Populace was made from the Justices House to the  
Scales, which were fixed on a Gallows erected for that Purpose opposite to  
the House, that the Justice’s Wife and the rest of the Ladies might see the  
Trial without coming amongst the Mob; and after the Manner of JAfoor-  
fields, a large Ring was also made. Then came out of the House a grave  
tall Man carrying the Holy Writ before the supposed Wizard, etc. (as  
solemnly as the Sword-bearer of Zondon before the Lord Mayor), The  
Wizard was first put in the Scale, and over him was read a Chapter out of  
the Books of Moses, and then the Bible was put in the other Scale (which  
being kept down before) was immediately let go ; but to great Surprize of  
the Spectators, Flesh and Bones came down plump, and outweighed that  
great Book by abundance. After the same Manner, the others were served,

and their Lumps of Mortality severally were too heavy for Moses and all  
the Prophets and Apostles. This being over, the Accusers and the rest of  
the Mob, not satisfied with this Experiment, would have the Trial by  
Water; accordingly a most solemn Procession was made to the Mill-pond ;  
where both Accused and Accusers being stripp’d (saving only to the  
Women their Shifts) were bound Hand and Foot, and severally placed in  
the Water, lengthways, from the Side of a Barge or Flat, having for Secu-  
rity only a Rope about the Middle of each, which was held by some in the  
Flat. The Accuser Man being thin and spare, with some Difficulty began  
to sink at last ; but the rest every one of them swam very light upon the  
Water. A Sailor in the Flat jump’d out upon the Back of the Man ac-  
cused, thinking to drive him down to the Bottom ; but the Person bound,  
without any Help, came up some time before the other. The Woman  
Accuser, being told that she did not sink, would be duck’d a second Time ;  
when she swam again as light as before. Upon which she declared, That  
she believed the Accused had bewitched her to make her so light, and that  
she would be duck’d again a Hundred Times, but she would duck the  
Devil out of her. The accused Man, being surprized at his own Swimming,  
was not so confident of his Innocence as before, but said, 7/7 am a Witch,  
it is more than I know. ‘The more thinking Part of the Spectators were of  
Opinion, that any Person so bound and plac’d in the Water (unless they  
were mere Skin and Bones) would swim till their Breath was gone, and  
their Lungs fill’d with Water. But it being the general Belief of the Popu-  
lace that the Womens Shifts, and the Garters with which they were bound,  
help’d to support them, it is said they are to be tried again the next war
