3 January 1794]  
  
  
In Committee of the Whole, JM offered seven resolutions to implement the recommendations of Jefferson’s “Report of the Secretary of State on the Privileges and Restrictions on the Commerce of the United States in Foreign Countries” of 16 December 1793. For the context of those resolutions, see Madison in the Third Congress, 2 December 1793–3 March 1795.  
  
  
Mr. Madison after some general observations on the report, entered into a more particular consideration of the subject.  
He remarked that the commerce of the United States is not at this day on that respectable footing, to which from its nature and importance it is entitled. He recurred to its situation previous to the adoption of the constitution, when conflicting systems prevailed in the different States—the then existing state of things gave rise to that convention of delegates from the different parts of the Union, who met to deliberate on some general principles for the regulation of commerce which might be conducive in their operation to the general welfare, and that such measures should be adopted as would conciliate the friendship and good faith of those countries who were disposed to enter into the nearest commercial connections with us. But what has been the result of the system which has been pursued ever since? What is the present situation of our commerce? From the situation in which we find ourselves after four years experiment, he observed, that it appeared incumbent on the United States to see whether they could not now take measures promotive of those objects for which the government was in a great degree instituted. Measures of moderation, firmness, and decision, he was persuaded were now necessary to be adopted, in order to narrow the sphere of our commerce with those nations who see proper not to meet us on terms of reciprocity.  
Mr. Madison then read the following Resolutions:  
Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, that the interest of the United States would be promoted by further restrictions and higher duties, in certain cases, on the manufactures and navigation of foreign nations, employed in the commerce of the United States, than those now imposed.  
1. Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, that an additional duty ought to be laid on the following articles, manufactured by European nations, having no commercial treaty with the United States.  
On all articles of which leather is the material of chief value, an additional duty of  per centum ad valorem.  
On all manufactured iron, steel, tin, pewter, copper, brass, or articles of which either of these metals is the material of chief value, an additional duty of  per centum ad valorem.  
On all articles of which cotton is the material of chief value, an additional duty of per centum ad valorem.  
On all cloths of which wool is the material of chief value, where the estimated value on which the duty is payable is above  an additional duty of  per centum ad valorem; where such value is below  an additional duty of  per centum ad valorem.  
On all cloths of which hemp or flax is the material of chief value, and of which the estimated value on which the duty is payable is below , an additional duty of  per centum ad valorem.  
On all manufactures of which silk is the material of chief value, an additional duty of  per centum ad valorem.  
2. Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, that an additional duty of  per ton, ought to be laid on the vessels belonging to the nations having no commercial treaty with the United States.  
3. Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, that the duty on vessels belonging to the nations having commercial treaties with the United States ought to be reduced to  per ton.  
4. Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, that where any nation may refuse to consider as vessels of the United States, any vessels not built within the United States, the foreign built vessels of such nation ought to be subjected to a like refusal, unless built within the United States.  
5. Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, that where any nation may refuse to admit the produce or manufactures of the United States, unless in vessels belonging to the United States, or to admit them in vessels of the United States, if last imported from any place not within the United States, a like restriction ought, after the  day of  to be extended to the produce and manufactures of such nation, and that, in the mean time, a duty of  per ton extraordinary ought to be imposed on vessels so importing any such produce or manufacture.  
6. Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, that where any nation may refuse to the vessels of the United States a carriage of the produce or manufactures thereof, whilst such produce or manufactures are admitted by it in its own vessels, it would be just to make the restriction reciprocal: but inasmuch as such a measure, if suddenly adopted, might be particularly distressing in cases which merit the benevolent attention of the United States, it is expedient, for the present, that a tonnage extraordinary only of  be imposed on the vessels so employed: and that all distilled spirits imported therein shall be subject to an additional duty of one —— part of the existing duty.  
7. Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, that provision ought to be made for liquidating and ascertaining the losses sustained by citizens of the United States, from the operation of particular regulations of any country contravening the law of nations, and that such losses be reimbursed, in the first instance, out of the additional duties on the manufactures, productions and vessels of the nation establishing such unlawful regulations.  
Mr. Madison, took a general view of the probable effects which the adoption of something like the resolutions he had proposed, would produce. They would produce, respecting many articles imported, a competition which would enable countries who do not now supply us with those articles to do it and would encrease the encouragement on such as we can produce within ourselves. We should also obtain an equitable share in carrying our own produce; we should enter into the field of competition on equal terms, and enjoy the actual benefit of advantages which nature and the spirit of our people entitle us to.  
He adverted to the advantageous situation this country is entitled to stand in, considering the nature of our exports and returns. Our exports are bulky, and therefore must employ much shipping, which might be nearly all our own; our exports are chiefly necessaries of life, or raw materials, the food for the manufacturers of other nations. On the contrary chief of what we receive from other countries we can either do without, or produce substitutes.  
It is in the power of the United States he conceived, by exerting her natural rights, without violating the rights or even the equitable pretensions of other nations; by doing no more than most nations do for the protection of their interests, and much less than some, to make her interests respected; for what we receive from other nations are but luxuries to us, which if we chose to throw aside we could deprive part of the manufacturers of those luxuries of even bread, if we are forced to contest of self denial; this being the case, our country may make her enemies feel the extent of her power.  
We stand with respect to the nation exporting those luxuries in the relation of an opulent individual to the labourer in producing the superfluities for his accommodation; the former can do without those luxuries, the consumption of which gives bread to the latter.  
He did not propose, or wish that the United States should, at present, go so far in the line which his resolutions point to as they might go. The extent to which the principles involved in those resolutions should be carried will depend upon filling up the blanks. To go to the very extent of the principle immediately might be inconvenient: He wished only that the legislature should mark out the ground on which we think we can stand, perhaps it may produce the effect wished for, without unnecessary irritation: we need not at first go every length.  
  
Another consideration would induce him, he said, to be moderate in filling up the blanks: not to wound public credit. He did not wish to risk any sensible diminution of the public revenue. He believed, that if the blanks were filled with judgment, the diminution of the revenue from a diminution in the quantity of imports would be counterbalanced by the increase in the duties.  
The last resolution he had proposed, he said, is in a manner distinct from the rest. The nation is bound by the most sacred obligation, he conceived, to protect the rights of its citizens against a violation of them from any quarter; or, if they cannot protect, they are bound to repay the damage.  
It is a fact authenticated to this house by communications from the executive, that there are regulations established by some European nations, contrary to the law of nations, by which our property is seized and disposed of in such a way that damages have accrued. We are bound either to obtain reparation for the injustice, or compensate the damage. It is only in the first instance, no doubt, that the burden is to be thrown upon the United States; the proper department of government will no doubt take proper steps to obtain redress.  
The justice of foreign nations will certainly not permit them to deny reparation when the breach of the law of nations appear evidently; at any rate it is just that the individual should not suffer.  
He believed the amount of the damages that would come within the meaning of this resolution, would not be very considerable.

Friday Jan. 3, 1794.  
  
IN committee of the whole on the re­  
port of the Secretary of State refpe&amp;ing  
foreign Commerce—Mr. Trumbull in the  
chair.  
  
Mr. Madison after some general obfer­  
vatious 011 the report, entered into a more  
particular consideration of the fubjeft.  
  
He remarked that the commerce of the  
United States is not at this day on that  
refpe&amp;able footing, to which from its na­  
tnre and importance it ii entitled. He re­  
curred to its situation previous to the a­  
doption of the constitution, when con­  
i: cting fyllemß prevailed in the different  
States—the then existing state of tilings  
gave rife to that convention of delegates  
from the different parts of the Union, who  
met to delibeiate on some general princi­  
ple;; for the regulation of commerce which  
might be conducive in their operation  
to the general welfare, and that such mea­  
furcs {houlu be adop&#x27;ed as would concili­  
ate the fricndlhip and good faith of those  
countries who were disposed to enter into  
the nearest commercial connexions with us.  
But what has been the result of the sys­  
tem which has been pursued ever since ?—  
What is the present situation of our com­  
meice ? From the situation in which we  
find ourselves after four years experiment,  
he observed, that it appeared incumbent  
on the Ur.ited States to fee whether they  
could not now take measures promotive of  
those objects for which the government  
was in a great degree ioftituted. Mea­  
sures of moderation, firmnefs, and deci­  
sion, he was persuaded were now necessa­  
ry to be adopted, in order to narrow the  
sphere of our commerce with those na­  
tions who fee proper not to meet us on  
terms of reciprocity.  
  
Mr. Madison then read the following  
Resolutions:  
  
Rrfoliied, as the opinion of this com­  
mittee* that the interest of the United  
States would be promoted by further re­  
ftriCtion* and higher duties, in certain cases,  
on the manufactures and navigation of fo­  
reign nations, employed in the commerce  
of the United State, than those now im­  
posed.  
  
1. RefeheJ, at the opinion of this com­  
mittee, that an additional duty ought to  
be laid on the following articles, manufac­  
tured by European nations, having no  
commercial treaty with the United States.  
  
On all articles of which leather i&gt; the  
material of chief vjlue, an additional duty  
of per centum ad valorem.  
  
On all manufactured iron, fleel, tin,  
pewter, copper, brass, or articles of which  
either of these metals is the material of  
chief value, an additional duty of per  
centum ad valorem.  
  
On all article* of which cotton is the  
material of chief value, an additional duty  
of per centum ad valorem.  
  
On all cloths of which wool is the ma­  
terial of chief value, where the estimated  
value on which the duty is payable is above  
  
an additional duty of per ceutum  
ad valorem ; where such value is below  
  
an additional duty of per centum  
  
ad valorem.  
  
On all cloths of which hemp or flax is  
the material of chief value, and of which  
the eilimated value on which the duty i&gt;  
payable is below , an additional duty  
of per centum ad valorem.  
  
On all manufa&amp;ures of which silk is the  
material of chief value, an additional duty  
of per centum ad valorem.  
  
i. Refolvtd, as the opinion of this com­  
mittee, that an additional duty of  
per ton, ought to be laid on the vessels  
  
belonging to the nations having no com­  
mercial treaty with the United States.  
3. Refolvtd, as the opinion of this com­  
mittee, that the duty on vessels belong­  
ing to the nations having commercial  
treaties with the United States ought  
to be reduced to per ton.  
4. Rtfolved, as the opinion of this com­  
mittee, that where any nation may re­  
fute to consider as vessels of the United  
States, any vessels not buiI.&#x27;1.&#x27; within the  
United States, the foreign built vessels  
of such nation ought to be fubje&amp;ed to  
a like refulal, unlets built within the  
  
United States. -  
5. Rtfohxd, as the opinion of this com-  
  
mittce, that where aay nation miy r«-  
fufe to admit the produce or manufac­  
ture! «f the United Statu, upleft in  
vdld* befenging to the United States,  
cr«#,*|®jt Ami ia Tcffeb of the Uni­  
ted tiWa, if Wft imported from any  
  
place not within the United States, a  
like reftri&amp;ion ought, after the day  
of to be extended to the produce  
and manufactures of such nation, and  
that, in the mean time, a duty of  
  
per toll extraordinary ought to be im­  
posed on vessels so importing any such  
produce or manufa&amp;ure.  
  
6. Rcfolvtd, as the opinion of this com­  
mittee, that #here any nation may re.  
fufe to the vessels of the United States  
a carriage of the produce or manufac­  
tures thereof, whilst such produce or  
manufactures are admitted by it in its  
own vessels, it would be just to make  
the reftri&amp;ion reciprocal: but inasmuch  
as such a measure, if suddenly adopted,  
might be particularly distressing in ca­  
ses which merit the benevolent atten­  
tion of the United States, it is expedi­  
ent, for the present, that a tonnage ex­  
traordinary only of be imposed on  
the vessels so employed: and that all  
distilled spirits imported therein lhall be  
fubjeA to an additional duty of one  
part of the existing duty.  
  
7. Resolved, as the opinion of this com­  
mittee, that provilion ought to be made  
for liquidating and ascertaining the los­  
ses sustained by citizens of the United  
States, from the operation of particular  
regulations of any country contravening  
the law of nations, and that such lofles  
be reimbursed, in the firft instance, out  
of the additional duties on the manu­  
factures, productions and vessels of the  
nation establishing such unlawful regu-  
  
latione.  
  
Mr. Madison, took a general view of  
the probable effects which the adoption of  
something like the resolutions he had pro­  
posed, would produce. They would pro­  
duce, refpc&amp;ing many articles imported,  
a competition which would enable coun­  
tries who do not now supply us with those  
articles to do it and would encreafe the  
encouragement on such as we can produce  
within ourselves. We Ihould also obtain  
an equitable (hare in carrying our own  
produce; we fliould enter into the field  
of competition on eqaal terms, and enjoy  
the a&amp;ual benefit of advantages which na­  
ture and the spirit of our people entitle us  
to.—  
  
He adverted to the advantageous situa­  
tion this country is entitled to stand in,  
considering the nature of our. export!  
and returns. Onr exports are bulky,  
and therefore mult employ much (hip­  
ping, which might be nearly all our  
own; our exports are chiefly necefiaries  
of life, or raw materials, the food for the  
manufacturers of other nations. On the  
contrary chief of what we receive from  
other countries we can either do without,  
or produce substitutes.  
  
It is in the power of the United States  
he conceived, by exerting her natural  
nghts, without violating the rights or  
even the equitable pretensions of other  
nations; by doing no more than molt na­  
tions do for the protection of their inter­  
ests, and much less than some, to make  
her interests refpefted ; for what we re­  
ceive from other nations are but luxuries  
to ui, which if we chose to throw aside  
we could deprive part of the manufacturers  
of those luxuries of even bread, if we  
are forced to contest of felf denial; this be­  
ing the cafe, our country may make her  
enemies feel the extent of her power.  
  
We stand with refpeA to tfte nation ex­  
porting those luxuries in the relation of an  
opulent individual to the labourer in pro­  
ducing the fuperfluities for his accommo­  
tion ; the former can do without those  
luxuries, the consumption of which gives  
bread to the latter.  
  
He did not propose, or wi(h that the  
United States (hould, at present, go so far  
in the line which his resolutions point to  
as they might go. The extent to which  
the principles involved in those resolution%  
(hould be carried will depend upon filling  
up the blanks. To go to the very extent  
of the principle immediately might be in­  
convenient : He wilhed only that the le­  
gislature (hould mark out the ground on  
which we think we can stand, perhaps it  
may produce the effect wiflied for, with­  
out unnecessary irritation: we need not  
at firft go every length.  
Another confideratioa would induce  
him, he said, to be moderate in filling up  
the blanks :—not to wound public credit.  
He did not wi(h to rilk any sensible dimi­  
nution of the public revenue. He believ­  
ed, that if the blanks were filled with  
judgment, the diminution c» the revenue  
from a diminution in the quantity of im­  
ports would be counterbalanced by the in­  
creafc in the duties.  
  
The last rcfolutipa he had proposed, he  
{aid, is in a manner diftinft from the reft.  
The nation is bound by the moil sacred  
obligation, he conceived, to protest the  
rights of its citizens against a violation of  
them from any quarter; or, if they can­  
not protest, they are bound to repay the  
damage.  
It is a fact authenticated to this house  
by communications from the executive,  
that there are regulations eftablilhed by  
some European nations,contrary to the law  
of nations, by which our property is sei­  
zed and difpoled of in such a way that  
damages have accrued. We are bound ei­  
ther to obtain reparation for the injustice,  
or compensate the damage. It is only in  
thefirft instance, no doubt, that the bur­  
den is to be thrown upon the United  
States; the proper department of go­  
vernment will no doubt take proper steps  
to obtain redress.  
  
The justice of foreign nations will cer­  
tainly not permit them to deny reparation  
when the breach of the law of nations  
appear evidently; at any rate it is just that  
the individual lliould not fuffer.  
  
He believed the amount of the dama­  
ges that would come within the meaning  
of this resolution, would not be very con­  
siderable.

adison, after some prefatory remarks  
6 on the situation of the United States be­  
fore the adoption of the Federal Constitution,  
the want, then, of an unity of measures in sup­  
port of their general interests ; Which want,  
md-od, gave rife to the Conflitution ; the un­  
prot-cted slate of our commerce since, notwith­  
fianding Its adoption, for want of some regula­  
tions tending to counterbalance thys. sl Stions  
laid on ours by some European nations, and the  
neceflity now of taking some firm and decisive,  
yet moderate steps, read in his place, and laid  
on the table of the committee, the following  
resolutions : :  
Resolved, as the opinion of this committee,  
that the interest of the United States would be  
promoted, by further restrictions and higher du­  
ties, 1n certain cases, on the manufaétures and  
navigation of foreign nations, employed in the  
commerce of the United States, than those now  
imposed.  
1. Resolved, as the opinion of this commit­  
tee, that an additional duty ought to be laid on  
the following articles, manufactured by Euro­  
pean nations, having no commercial treaty with  
the United States,  
On all articles of which leather is the mate­  
ral of chief value; an additional duty of  
per centum, ad valorem.  
On all manufattured iron, fleel, tin, pewter,  
cepper, brals, or arucles of which either of these  
metals 1s the material of chief value, 2n addition­  
al duty of per centum ad  
valorem.  
On all articles of which cotton is the mate.  
rial of chief value, an additional duty of |  
per centum ad valorem. ;  
On all cloths of which wool is the material  
of chief value, where the estimated value on  
which the duty is payable, is above an  
additional duty of per cen­

finftion reciprocal ; but inalmuch as such a  
measure, if suddenly adopted, might be parti­  
cularly distressing in cases, merit the benevolent  
attention of the %Jnited States, it is expedient,  
for the present, that a tonnage extraordinary on­

therein shall be fubjetied to an additional duty  
of one part of the existing duty,

• hlr. Mmifka then took a gene-  
ral view of the probable elects  
which the adoption of fomeching  
like the rcfolmions which he hail  
propoled would produce. They  
would produce, refpecting many  
articles importeded, a competition  
which would enable countries,  
who do not now fupply us with  
thofe ai tides, to do ii, and would  
encreaie the encouragement on  
fljch as we can produce within 6ur-  
felves. We Ihould alio obtain an  
equitable mare in carving our own  
produce j we mould enter into the  
field of competition on equal terms,  
and enjoy the actu.d benefit of ad-  
vantages which nature and the&#x27;  
fpirit of ou; people entitltle us to.  
  
He adverted to the advantage-  
ous iituation this country is end.  
tied to ltand in coniidering the na-  
ture of our exports and returns.  
Our exports are bulky, and there-  
fore muft employ much lhipping,  
Which might be nearly all our own;  
our expoits are chiefly necellaries  
of life, of raw mateiials, the food  
for the m ami fact u es ot other na-^  
tions. On the contrary; the chief  
of what we receive front otiier  
countries we can either dj with&#x27;  
out or produce lubftitutes.  
  
It is In the power of the United  
States, he conceived, uy tx6 trig  
her natural rights, wkhoot viola-  
ting the rights or even the equita-  
ble pretentions of other nations,  
by doing no more than molt nati-  
ons do for the protecti m of their  
interefts, and much left than fome,  
to make her intercity refpectcd ;  
for what we receive from otiier  
nations are but luxuries to us,  
which, if we chofe to throw alide,  
■we could deprive part of the ma-  
nufacturers of thote luxuries, of  
even bread t If we are forced to a  
contelt of felf-denial, this being  
the cafe, our country may make  
he.- enemies feel the extent of her  
power.  
  
We Hand with refpect to the na-  
tion exporting thofe luxuries, in  
the relation ot an opulent Indivi-  
dual to the laborer employed in  
producing the fuperrluitis for his  
accomodation ; &#x27;&#x27;he former can do  
without thofe luxuries, the con-  
iiimprion of which gives bread to  
the latter.  
  
He did not propofe or wi(h that  
the United Sates ihould at prefent,  
go ib far in the line which his re-  
fjl unions point to as fhey might  
go.&quot; The extent to which the  
principles involved in thofe refo-  
lutions ihould be carried will de-  
pend upon tilling up the blanks.  
To go to the very extent of the  
principle immediately, might be  
inconvenient : He wimed only  
that the legiflature (bo old mark  
ont the ground on which they  
think our national rights may be  
vindicated.  
  
Let us eftablifh found principles ;  
let us occupy the ground on which  
ve think we ftand, perhaps it may  
produce the effect wi.lied for,  
•without unnecellary irritation ;  
•we need not at firll go every  
length.

withholding his assent, prevents the Legislature from going into consideration of  
other important matters inseparably connected with the passage of the said Bill,
