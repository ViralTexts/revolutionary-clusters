H[amilton] made several just criticisms on difft. parts of it. But where I asserted that the U.S. had no right to alienate an inch of the territory of any state he attacked and denied the doctrine.

the height of imprudence in us while treating for the surrender of the posts to engage in any thing which wd. irritate them, that if we did so, they wd. naturally say ‘these people mean war, let us therefore hold what we have in our hands.’ This argument struck me forcibly, and I said ‘if there is a hope of obtaining the posts, I agree it wd. be imprudent to risk that hope by a commercial retaliation.

idence in the event of the French revolution. The fact is that Gouverneur Morris, a high flying Monarchy-man, shutting his eyes and his faith to every fact against his wishes, and believing every thing he desires to be true, has kept the President’s mind constantly poisoned with his forebodings. That the President wishes the revolution may be established I believe from several indications. I remember when I recd. the news of the king’s flight and capture, I first told him of it  at his assembly. I never saw him so much dejected by any event in my life. He expressed clearly on this occasion his disapprobation of the legislature referring things to the heads of departments.  
Written Mar. 12.  
Eod. die. 10. aclock A. M. The preceding was about 9. aclock. The Presid. now sends Lear to me to ask what answer he shall give the committee, and particularly whether he shall add to it that ‘in making the communication it was not his expectation that the house should give any answer.’ I told Mr. Lear that I thought the house had a right, independantly of legislation, to express sentiments on other subjects. That when these subjects did not belong to any other branch particularly they would publish them by their own authority; that in the present case which respected a foreign nation, the Pres. being the organ of our nation with other nations, the house would satisfy their duty if instead of a direct communication they shd. pass their sentiments thro’ the President. That if expressing a sentiment were really an invasion of the Executive power, it was so faint a one that it would be difficult to demonstrate it to the public and to a public partial to the French revolution, and not disposed to consider the approbation of it from any quarter as improper. That the Senate indeed had given many indications of their wish to invade the Executive power. The Represent. had done it in one case which was indeed mischeivous and alarming, that of giving orders to the heads of the executive departments without consulting the Pres., but that the late vote for directing the Sec. of the Treasy. to report ways and means, tho’ carried, was carried by so small a majority and with the aid of members so notoriously under a local influence on that question as to give a hope that the practice would be arrested, and the constitutional course be taken up, of asking the Pres. to have information laid before them, but that in the present instance, it was so far from being clearly an invasion of the Executive, and wd. be so little approved by the genl. voice that I cd. not advise the Pres. to express any dissatisfaction at the vote of the house, and I gave Lear in writing what I thought should be his answer. See it.  
Mar. 31. A meeting at the ☉’s. Present Th: J. A. H. H. K. and E. R. The subject was the resol. of the H. of Repr. of Mar. 27. to appt. a committee to enquire into the causes of the failure of the late expedition under Majr. Genl. St. Clair with power to call for such persons, papers and records as may be necessary to assist their enquiries. The Committee had written to Knox for the original letters, instructions &amp;c. The President he had called us, to consult, merely because it was the first example, and he wished that so far as it shd. become a  precedent, it should be rightly conducted. He neither acknoleged nor denied, nor even doubted the propriety of what the house were doing, for he had not thought upon it, nor was acquainted with subjects of this kind. He could readily conceive there might be papers of so secret a nature as that they ought not to be given up.—We were not prepared and wished time to think and enquire.  
Apr. 2. Met again at ☉’s on same subject. We had all considered and were of one mind 1. that the house was an inquest, and therefore might institute enquiries. 2. that they might call for papers generally. 3. that the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit, and ought to refuse those the disclosure of which would injure the public. Consequently were to exercise a discretion. 4. that neither the Committee nor House had a right to call on the head of a department, who and whose papers were under the Presidt. alone, but that the Committee shd. instruct their chairman to move the house to address the President. We had principally consulted the proceedings of the communications in the case of Sr. Rob. Walpole. 13. Chandler’s deb. For point 1. see pages 161. 170. 172. 183. 187. 207. For the 2d. pa. 153. 173. 207. For the 3d. 81. 173. Append. pa. 44. For the 4th. pa. 246. Note Hamilt. agreed with us in all these points except as to the power of the house to call on heads of departments. He observed that as to his department the act constituting it had made it subject to Congress in some points; but he thought himself not so far subject as to be obliged to produce all papers they might call for. They might demand secrets of a very mischeivous nature [here I tho’t he began to fear they would go to examining how far their own members and other persons in the government had been dabbling in stocks, banks &amp;c. and that he probably would chuse in this case to deny their power, and in short he endeavored to place himself subject to the house when the Executive should propose what he did not like, and subject to the Executive when the house shd. propose any thing disagreeable.] I observed here a difference between the British parliament and our Congress, that the former was a legislature, an inquest, and a council for the king. The latter was by the constitution a legislature and an inquest, but not a council.—Finally agreed to speak separatim to the members of the committee and bring them by persuasion into the right channel. It was agreed in this case that there was not a paper which might not be properly produced, that copies only should be sent, with an assurance that if they should desire it, a clerk should attend with the originals to be verified by themselves. The committee were Fitzsimmons, Steele, Mercer, Clarke, Sedgewick, Giles, Vining

h in the execution. It was possible too to concieve a treaty which it would not be their duty to provide for. He said that he did not like throwing too much into democratic hands, that if they would not do what the constitution called on them to do, the government would be at an end, and must then assume another form. He stopped here, and I kept silence to see whether he would say any thing more in the same line, or add any qualifying expression to soften what he had said. But he did neither.

 they held the purse strings and would be jealous of them. However he desired me to strike out the intimation  that the seal would not be put till both houses should have voted the money.  
Apr. 6. The President called on me before breakfast and first introduced some other matters, then fell on the representation bill which he had now in his possession for the 10th day. I had before given him my opinion in writing that the method of apportionmt. was contrary to the constitution. He agreed that it was contrary to the common understanding of that instrument, and to what was understood at the time by the makers of it: that yet it would bear the construction which the bill put, and he observed that the vote for and against the bill was perfectly geographical, a Northern agt. a Southern vote, and he feared he should be thought to be taking side with a Southern party. I admitted this motive of delicacy, but that it should not induce him to do wrong: urged the dangers to which the scramble for the fractionary members would always lead. He here expressed his fear that there would ere long be a separation of the union; that the public mind seemed dissatisfied and tending to this. He went home, sent for Randolph the Atty. Genl. desired him to get Mr. Madison immediately and come to me, and if we three concurred in opinion that he should negative the bill, he desired to hear nothing more about it but that we would draw the instrument for him to sign. They came. Our minds had been before made up. We drew the instrumt. Randolph carried it to him and told him we all concurred in it. He walked with him to the door, and as if he still wished to get off, he said, ‘and you say you approve of this yourself.’ ‘Yes, Sir, says Randolph, I do upon my honor.’ He sent it into the H. of Representatives instantly. A few of the hottest friends of the bill expressed passion, but the majority were satisfied, and both in and out of doors it gave pleasure to have at length an instance of the negative being exercised.—Written this 9th. of April

gress and the heads of department. The passage reads:  
11 Mot again at the president’s on the same subject. We  
had all considered, and were of one mind, that neither  
the committee nor house had a right to call on the head  
of a department, who and whose papers were under the  
president alone, but that the committee should instruct

heads of departments. He observed, that as to his de­  
partment, the act constituting it, had made it subject to  
congress in some points ; but he thought himself not so  
far subject, as to bo obliged to produce ull the papers  
they might call for. They might demand secrets of a  
very mischievous nature. Here 1 thought he began to  
fear they would go to examining how far their own  
members and other persons in the. government had  
been dabbling in stocks, bonks, &amp;e. and that he would  
probably choose in this case to deny their power • and  
in short, lie endeavored to place himself subject to the  
house, when the executive should propose what lie did  
not like, and subject to the executive when the house  
should propose any thing disagreeable.

fell on the Representation Bill, which he had now ii  
his possession for the 10th day. I bad before given  
him my opinion in writing, that the method of appokit­

tlut it waa contrary to the common understanding of  
that instrument, and to what was understood at tie  
time by the makers of it; that yet it would bear the  
construction which the bill put; and he observed tkat  
the vole for arid against the bill was perfectly geogra­  
phical?a Northern against a Southern vote?and he  
feared he ahould l&gt;e thought to be taking side with a  
Southern parly. 1 admitted the motive of delicacy,

urged the dangers to which the scramble for the frtc­

pressed his fear that there would, ere long, be a sepa­  
ration of the Union ; that the pablic mind teemsd

for Randolph, the Atto&#x27;rney General, desired him to

it, but that we would draw up the instrument for hia  
to sign. They came?our minds had been befon  
made up?we drew the instrument. Randolph car­

some light on the cantious exercise of the Veto,

,&#x27; &quot;April Oth.?The President called on me before breakfast,  
and first introduced some other matter, then fell on &#x27;  
the representation bill, which he had now in his posses- 11  
sion for the t?nth day. 1 had before given him my opin- t  
ion, in writing, that the method of apportionment was  
contrary to the constitution. He agreed that it was con- 0  
trary to the common understanding of that instrument,  
and to what was understood at the time by the makers ot 1  
it; that vet it would bear the construction which the hill 1  
put; and he observed that the vote for and against the  
bill was jierfectly geographical?a northern against a 1  
southern vote?and he feared he would be thought to be 1  
taking sides with a southern party. I admitted the mo- a  
live of delicacy, hut then it should not induce him to do c  
wrong; and urged the dangers to which the scramble for 4  
the fractionary members would always lead. He here u  
expressed his fear that there would ere long be a separation  
of the Union; that the public mind seemed dissa&#x27;- 1  
i^iiwt nml tpinliiifr to this. He went home; sent for Ran- -  
  
dolph, the Attorney General; desired him to get Mr 1  
Madison immediately, and come to me; and if we three tconcurred  
in opinion, that he would negative the bill n  
He desired to hear nothing more about it, but thai b  
we would draw up the instrument tor him to sign b  
Fhey came: our minds had been before made up; we  
drew the instrument. Randolph carried it to him, and t  
told him we all concurred in it. He walked with him to (&lt;  
the door, and, as if he still wished to get off, lie said, s  
&#x27; and you approve of this yourself ?&#x27; &#x27; Yes sir,&#x27; says c  
Randolph, &#x27; 1 do, upon my honor.&#x27; He sent it to the &#x27;  
House of Representatives instantly A few of the hottest  
friends of the bill expressed passion, but the majority t  
were satisfied, and both in and out of doors it gave  
pleasure to have at length an instance of the negative &gt;  
being exercised. Written this luth April.

the common understanding of that instrument and to what  
was understood at the time by the makers of it, but that the  
Constitution would bear the construction which the bill  
implied. And, inasmuch as the vote for and against the  
bill was perfectly geographical, a Northern against a South-  
ern vote, he feared that he should be thought to be taking  
sides with the Southern party if he sent ina veto. Jefferson  
admitted the motive of delicacy, but insisted that the Presi-  
dent should not allow this feeling to lead him to a wrong  
course of action in the matter, and urged the dangers to  
which the scramble for the fractional members would lead  
if such a principle should once be adopted. Washington  
then expressed his fear that there would, ere long, be a  
separation of the union, for the public mind seemed to be  
dissatisfied and tending toward this end. Upon returning  
home, he sent for Randolph, the Attorney-General, and

walked with him to the door, and, as if he still wished to  
avoid the responsibility for the action, said to him, ‘‘And
