I recieved in due season the Address of the Legislature of    bearing date the   of   in which, with their approbation of the general course of my administration, they were so good as to express their desire

That I should lay down my charge at a proper period, is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully. if  
some termination to the services of the chief magistrate be not fixed by the constitution, or supplied by practice, his

I should unwillingly be the person who, disregarding the sound precedent set by an illustrious predecessor, should furnish  
the first example of prolongation beyond the second term of office.  
Truth also requires me to add that I am sensible of that decline which advancing years bring on; and feeling  
their physical, I ought not to doubt their Mental effect. happy if I am the first to percieve &amp; to obey this admonition  
of nature, and to sollicit a retreat from cares too great for the wearied faculties of age.  
For the approbation which the Legislature of    has been  
pleased to express of the principles &amp; measures pursued in the management of their affairs, I am sincerely thankful:  
and should I be so fortunate as to carry into retirement the equal approbation &amp; good will of my fellow citizens

Dec. 10, 1607. I received in dne season the  
address of the Legislature of Vermont, bearing  
date tbe Sth of November, 1606, in which, with  
their approbation of the geueral course of my  
Administration, they were so good as to express  
their desiro that I wonld consent to bo proposed  
again to tho public voica on the expiration of  
my present term of tiQJc.. Entertaining as I do  
for tho Legislature of Vermont those sentiments  
of high respect which would h.ive prompted an  
immediate answer, I was certain, nevertheless,  
they would approve a delay which had for ita  
object to avoid a premature agitation of tbe pub­  
lic mind on a subject so interesting as the elec­  
tion of a Chief Magistrate.  
That I tbould lay do n my charge at a proper  
period is as much a duty as to hava borne it  
faithfully. If some termination to the services  
of tbe Chief Magistrate be not tiled by tbe Con­  
stitution, or supplied by practice, his office,  
nominally fur ears, will in tact become for life;  
and hiitory thoirt how ca$itg that degenerate into  
an inheritance. Behaving that a representative  
government respunsibla at short periods of elec­  
tion is that which produces the greatest sum of  
bappimssto mankind, I feci it a duty to do no  
act trAicA stall e$icntiallj impair that principle ;  
and I shonid unwillingly be the person who,  
disregarding (Ac tound precedent ft If an illustri­  
ous predecator, should fniuish the lirst example  
of prolongation beyond the second term of of­  
fice.Truth also reqnirss me fo aOd that I am sen­  
Mblo of that decline which advancing years bring  
on, and feeling their physical, I uught not to  
doubt their mental eSect. Happy if I am tho  
first to peiceive and to obey the admonition of  
Nature, and to solicit a retreat from cares too  
great for tho wearied faculties of age.  
For the approbation which the Legislature of  
Vermont has been pleased toexpret-sof the prin­  
ciples and measures purtued in tho management  
of their uflaira, I am sincerely thankful ; aud  
hould I bo so fortunate as to carry into retire­  
ment the equal approbation and good will of my  
lellow-citizeus generally, and it will be tbe com­  
fort of my future days, and will close a service  
of forty years with the only reward it ever  
wished. Respectfully,
