The Secretary of state to whom was referred, by the house of representatives, to prepare and report a proper plan or plans for establishing uniformity in the currency, weights and measures of the U.S. in obedience thereto, makes the following report.  
To obtain uniformity in measures, weights and coins, it is necessary to find some measure of invariable length, with which, as a standard, they may be compared.  
There exists not in nature, as far as has been hitherto observed, a single subject, or species of subject accessible to man, which presents one constant and uniform dimension.  
The globe of the earth itself indeed might be considered as invariable in all it’s dimensions, and that it’s circumference would furnish an invariable measure. But no one of it’s circles great or small, is accessible to admeasurement through all it’s parts: and the various trials to measure definite portions of them have been of such various result, as to shew there is no dependance on that operation for certainty.  
Matter then, by it’s mere extension, furnishing nothing invariable, it’s Motion is the only remaining resource.  
The motion of the earth round it’s axis, tho’ not absolutely uniform and invariable, may be considered as such for every human purpose. It is measured obviously but unequally, by the departure of a given meridian from the sun, and it’s return to it, constituting a solar day. Throwing together the inequalities of Solar days, a mean interval, or day, has been found, and divided by very general consent into 86,400 equal parts.  
A pendulum, vibrating freely in small and equal arcs, may be so adjusted in it’s length as by it’s vibrations, to make this division of the earth’s motion into 86,400 equal parts called seconds of mean time.  
Such a pendulum then becomes itself a measure of determinate length, to which all others may be referred, as to a standard.  
But even the pendulum is not without it’s uncertainties.  
  
1. The difficulty of ascertaining in practice it’s center of oscillation, as depending on the form of the Bob and it’s distance from the point of suspension; the effect of the weight of the suspending wire towards displacing the center of oscillation; that center being seated within the body of the bob, and therefore inaccessible to the measure; are sources of considerable incertainty.  
2. Both theory and experience prove that, to preserve it’s isochronism, it must be shorter towards the equator, and longer towards the poles.  
3. The height of the situation above the common level, as being an increment to the radius of the earth, diminishes the length of the pendulum.  
4. The pendulum being made of metal, as is best, it varies it’s length with the variations in the temperature of the atmosphere.  
5. To continue small and equal vibrations through a sufficient length of time, and to count these vibrations, machinery and a power are necessary, which may exert a small but constant effort to renew the waste of motion: and the difficulty is so to apply these as that they shall neither retard nor accelerate the vibrations.  
1. In order to avoid the uncertainties which respect the center of oscillation, it has been proposed by Mr. Leslie, an ingenious artist of Philadelphia, to substitute for the pendulum, an uniform cylindrical rod, without a Bob.  
Could the diameter of such a rod be infinitely small, the center of oscillation would be exactly at two thirds of the whole length, measured from the point of suspension. Giving it a diameter which shall render it sufficiently inflexible, the center will be displaced indeed; but, in a Second rod, not the 600,000th part of it’s length,  and not the hundredth part as much as in a Second pendulum, with a Spherical Bob of proper diameter. This displacement is so infinitely minute then, that we may consider the center of oscillation for all practical purposes as residing at two thirds of the length from the center of suspension. The distance between these two centers might be easily and accurately ascertained in practice. But the whole rod is better for a standard than any portion of it, because sensibly defined at both it’s extremities.  
2. The uncertainty arising from the difference of length requisite for the Second pendulum, or the Second rod, in different latitudes, may be avoided by fixing on some one latitude to which our standard shall refer. That of 38.° as being the middle latitude of the United states, might seem the most convenient, were we to consider ourselves alone. But connected with other nations by commerce and science, it is better to fix on that parallel which bids fairest to be adopted by them also. The 45th. as being the middle term between the Equator and Pole has been heretofore proposed in Europe; and the proposition has been lately renewed there under circumstances which may very possibly give it some effect. This parallel is distinguished with us also, as forming our principal Northern boundary. Let the completion of the 45th. degree then give the Standard for our Union, with the hope that it may become a line of union with the rest of the world.  
The difference between the Second rod for 45.° of latitude, and that for 31.° our other extreme, is to be examined.  
The Second pendulum for 45.° of latitude, according to Sr. Isaac Newton’s computation, must be of  39.14912 inches English measure, and a rod, to vibrate in the same time, must be of the same length between the centers of suspension and oscillation; and consequently it’s whole length 58.7 (or more exactly 58.72368) inches. This is longer than the rod which shall vibrate seconds in 31.° of Latitude by about 1/679 part of it’s whole length; a difference so minute that it might be neglected, as insensible, for the  common purposes of life. But in cases requiring perfect exactness, the Second rod, found by trial of it’s vibrations in any part of the U.S. may be corrected by computation for the latitude of the place, and so brought exactly to the standard of 45.°  
3. By making the experiment in the level of the ocean, the difference will be avoided which a higher position might occasion.  
4. The expansion, and contraction of the rod with the change of temperature is the fourth source of uncertainty beforementioned, according to the high authority so often quoted. An iron rod, of given length, may vary, between summer and winter, in temperate latitudes, and in the common exposure of houseclocks from 1/1728 to 1/2592 of it’s whole length: which in a rod of 58.7 inches will be from about two to three hundredths of an inch. This may be avoided by adjusting and preserving the standard in a cellar, or other place, the temperature of which never varies. Iron is named for this purpose, because the least expansible of the metals.  
5. The practical difficulty resulting from the effect of the machinery and moving power, is very inconsiderable in the present state of the arts; and in their progress towards perfection, will become less and less. To estimate and obviate this, will be the artist’s province. It is as nothing when compared with the sources of inaccuracy hitherto attending measures.  
Before quitting the subject of the inconveniencies, some of which attend the pendulum alone, others both the pendulum and rod, it must be added that the rod would have an accidental, but very precious advantage over the pendulum in this country, in the event of our fixing the foot at the nearest aliquot part of either: for the difference between the common foot and those so to be deduced would be three times greater in the case of the pendulum than in that of the rod.  
Let the Standard of measure then be an uniform cylindrical rod of iron, of such length as in lat. 45.° in the level of the ocean, and  in a cellar or other place, the temperature of which does not vary thro’ the year, shall perform it’s vibrations, in small and equal arcs, in one second of mean time.

m to the same invariable standard.  
The first settlers of these states having come chiefly from England brought with them the measures and weights of that country. These alone are generally established among us, either by law or usage, and these therefore are alone to be retained and fixed. We must resort to that country for information of what they are or ought to be.  
This rests principally on the evidence of certain standard measures  and weights, which have been preserved of long time in different deposits. But differences among these having been known to exist, the house of commons in the years 1757. and 1758. appointed committees to enquire into the original standards of their weights and measures. These committees, assisted by able mathematicians and artists, examined and compared with each other the several standard measures and weights, and made reports on them in the years 1758. and 1759. The circumstances under which these reports were made entitle them to be considered as far as they go, as the best written testimony existing of the standard measures and weights of England: and as such they will be relied on in the progress of this report.

ith the standards at the Exchequer as near as it was possible. They furnish no means, to persons at a distance, of knowing what this standard is. This however is suppli[ed by the evidence of the Second pendulum, which according to the authority before quoted is, at London, 39.1682 English inches, and consequently the Second rod there is of 58.7523 of the same inches. When we shall have found then, by actual trial, the Second rod for 45.° by adding the difference of their computed length, to wit  287/10000 of an inch, or rather 3/10 of a line (which in practice will endanger less error than an attempt at so minute a fraction as the ten thousandth parts of an inch) we shall have the Second rod of London, or a true measure of 58¾ English inches. Or to shorten the operation, without varying the result,]  
Let the Standard rod of 45.° be divided into 587⅕ equal parts; and let each of these parts be declared a line;  
  
10 lines an inch;  
12 inches a foot;  
3. feet a yard;  
3. feet 9. Inches an ell;  
6. feet a fathom;

2. quarts a pottle;  
2. pottles a gallon;

8. gallons make a measure, called a firkin in liquid substances, and a bushel dry;  
2. firkins or bushels, makes a measure called a rundlet, or kilderkin liquid, and a strike, dry;  
2. kilderkins or strikes make a measure called a barrel liquid, and a coom dry; this last term being antient and little used;

e of the corn bushel.  
Of the standard measures before stated two are principally distinguished in authority and practice. The statute bushel of 2150. cubic inches, which gives a gallon of 268.75 cubic inches, and the standard gallon of 1601. called the Corn gallon, of 271. or 272. cubic inches which has introduced the mercantile bushel of 2176. inches. The former of these is most used in some of the grain states, the latter in others. The middle term of 270. cubic inches may be taken as a mutual compromise of convenience, and as offering this general advantage, that the bushel being of 2160. cubic inches is exactly a cubic foot and a quarter, and so facilitates the conversion of wet and dry measures into solid contents and tonnage, and simplifies the connection of measures and weights, as will be shewn hereafter. It may be added in favor of this as a medium measure that eight of the standard or statute measures before enumerated are below this term, and nine above it.  
The measures to be made for use being foursided, with rectangular sides and bottom,  
  
The Pint will be 3. inches square and 3¾ I. deep;  
The Quart 3. I. square and 7½ I. deep;  
The Pottle 3. I. square and 15. I. deep, or 4½, 5, and 6. I.  
The Gallon 6. I. square and 7½ I. deep, or 5, 6, and 9. I.  
The Peck 6, 9, and 10. I.  
The Half-bushel 12. I. square, and 7½ I. deep;  
and the Bushel 12. I. square, and 15. I. deep, or 9, 15, and 16. I.  
Cylindrical measures have the advantage of superior strength: but square ones have the greater advantage of enabling every one, who has a rule in his pocket to verify their contents, by measuring them. Moreover till the circle can be squared, the cylinder cannot be cubed, nor it’s contents exactly expressed in figures.  
Let the measures of capacity then for the U.S. be  
A gallon of 270. cubic inches;  
The gallon to contain two pottles;  
The pottle 2. quarts;  
The quart 2. pints;

s divided into 12 ounces;  
The Ounce (according to the subdivision of the Apothecaries) into 8. drams;  
The Dram into 3. scruples;  
The Scruple into 20. grains.  
  
According to the subdivision for gold and silver  
The Ounce is divided into 20 pennyweight;  
and the pennyweight into 24. grains.  
so that the pound Troy contains 5760. grains, of which 7000. are requisite to make the pound avoirdupois. Of course the weight of the pound Troy is to that of the pound Avoirdupois as 5760. to 7000. or as 144. to 175.  
It is remarkeable that this is exactly the proportion of the antient liquid gallon of Guildhall of 224. cubic inches to the corn gallon of 272. for 224. are to 272. as 144. to 175.  
It is further remarkeable still that this is also the exact proportion between the specific weight of any measure of wheat, and of the same measure of water. For the statute bushel is of 64. pounds of wheat. Now as 144. to 175. so are 64. ℔. to 77.7. ℔. But 77.7 ℔. is known to be the weight of 2150.4 cubic inches of pure water; which is exactly the content of the Winchester bushel as declared by the stat. 13. 14. W. 3. That statute determined the bushel to be a cylinder of 18½ inches diameter, and 8. inches depth. Such a cylinder, as nearly as it can be cubed, and expressed in figures, contains 2150.425 cubic inches: a result which reflects authority on the declaration of parliament and induces a favorable opinion of the care with which they investigated the contents of the antient bushel, and also a belief that there might exist evidence of it as that day unknown to the committees of 1758. and 1759.  
We find then in a continued proportion 64. to 77.7 as 224. to 272. and as 144. to 175. that is to say: the Specific weight of a measure of wheat, to that of the same measure of water, as the cubic contents of the wet gallon, to those of the dry; and as the weight of a pound Troy to that of a pound Avoirdupois.  
This seems to have been so combined as to render it indifferent whether a thing were dealt out by weight or measure. For the dry gallon of wheat, and the liquid one of wine, were of the same weight; and the Avoirdupois pound of wheat, and Troy pound of wine were of the same measure. Water and the vinous liquors which enter most into commerce, are so nearly of a weight, that the difference, in moderate quantities, would be neglected by both buyer and seller; some of the wines being a little heavier, and some a little lighter than water.  
Another remarkeable correspondence is that between weights  and solid measures. For 1000. ounces avoirdupois of pure water, fill a cubic foot with mathematical exactness.  
What circumstances of the times, or purposes of barter or commerce, called for this combination of weights and measures with the subjects to be exchanged or purchased, are not now to be ascertained. But a triple set of exact proportionals representing weights, measures, and the things to be weighed and measured, and a relation so integral between weights and solid measures, must have been the result of design, and scientific calculation, and not a mere coincidence of hazard. It proves that the dry and wet measures the heavy and light weights must have been original parts of the system they compose: contrary to the opinion of the committee of 1757. 1758. who thought that the avoirdupois weight was not an antient weight of the kingdom, nor ever even a legal weight, but during a single year of the reign of H. 8. and therefore concluded, otherwise than will be here proposed, to suppress it altogether. Their opinion was founded chiefly on the silence of the laws as to this weight. But the harmony here developed in the system of weights and measures, of which the avoirdupois makes an essential member, corroborated by a general use, from very high antiquity, of that, or of a nearly similar weight under another name, seem stronger proofs that this is a legal weight, than the mere silence of the written laws is of the contrary.  
Be this as it may, it is in such general use with us, that, on the principle of popular convenience, it’s higher denominations, at least, must be preserved. It is by the Avoirdupois pound and ounce that our citizens have been used to buy and sell. But the smaller subdivisions of drams and quarters, are not in use with them. On the other hand, they have been used to weigh their money and medecine with the pennyweights and grains, Troy weight, and are not in the habit of using the pounds and ounces of that series. It would be for their convenience then to suppress the pound and ounce Troy, and the dram and quarter avoirdupois; and to form into one series, the avoirdupois pound and ounce, and the Troy pennyweight and grain. The Avoirdupois ounce contains 18. pennyweight 5½ grains Troy weight. Divide it then into 18. pennyweight, and the pennyweight as heretofore into 24. grains, and the new pennyweight will contain between a third and a quarter of a grain more than the present Troy pennyweight; or more accurately, it will be to that as 875. to 864. a difference not to be noticed either in money or medicine below the denomination of an ounce.  
  
But it will be necessary to refer these weights to a determinate mass of some substance, the specific gravity of which is invariable. Rain water is such a substance, and may be referred to every where and through all time. It has been found, by accurate experiments, that a cubic foot of rainwater weighs 1000. ounces avoirdupois, standard weights of the Exchequer. It is true that among these standard weights, the committee reports small variations. But this experiment must decide in favor of those particular weights, between which and an integral mass of water, so remarkeable a coincidence has been found. To render this standard more exact the water should be weighed always in the same temperature of air; as heat, by increasing it’s volume, lessens it’s specific gravity. The cellar of uniform temperature is best for this also.  
Let it then be established that an ounce is of the weight of a cube of rainwater, of one tenth of a foot or rather that it is the thousandth part of the weight of a cubic foot of rain water weighed in the standard temperature; that the series of weights of the U.S. shall consist of pounds, ounces, pennyweights, and grains whereof  
24. grains shall be one pennyweight;  
18. pennyweight one ounce;  
16. ounces one pound.  
Coins.  
Congress in 1786. established the Money unit at 375.64 Troy grains of pure silver. It is proposed to enlarge this by about the third of a grain in weight, or a mill in value; that is to say, to establish it at 376. (or more exactly 376.02985) instead of 375.64 grains, because it will be shewn that this, as the Unit of coin, will link in system with the Units of length, surface, capacity and weight, whenever it shall be thought proper to extend the decimal ratio through all these branches. It is to preserve the possibility of doing this that this very minute alteration is proposed.  
We have this proportion then. 875. to 864. as 376.02985 grains Troy to 371.30261 the expression of the Unit in the new grains.  
Let it be declared therefore that the Money unit, or Dollar of the U.S. shall contain 371.3 American grains of pure silver.  
If nothing more then is proposed than to render uniform and stable the system we already possess, this may be effected on the plan herein detailed; the sum of which is 1. that the present measures of length be retained and fixed by an invariable standard: 2. that the measures of surface remain as they are, and be invariable also as the measures of length to which they are to refer: 3. that  the Unit of capacity, now so equivocal, be settled at a medium and convenient term, and defined by the same invariable measures of length: 4. that the more known terms in the two kinds of weights be retained, and reduced to one series, and that they be referred to a definite mass of some substance, the specific gravity of which never changes: and 5. that the quantity of pure silver in the money unit be expressed in parts of the weight so defined.  
In the whole of this no change is proposed, except an insensible one in the Troy grain and pennyweight, and the very minute one in the Money unit.  
II  
But if it be thought that, either now, or at any future time, the citizens of the U.S. may be induced to undertake a thorough reformation of their whole system of measures, weights and coins, reducing every branch to the same decimal ratio already established in their coins, and thus bringing the calculation of the principal affairs of life within the arithmetic of every man who can multiply and divide plain numbers, greater changes will be necessary.  
The Unit of measure is still that which must give law through the whole system: and from whatever unit we set out, the coincidences between the old and new ratios will be rare. All that can be done will be to chuse such an Unit as will produce the most of these. In this respect the Second rod has been found on trial to be far preferable to the Second pendulum.  
Measures of length.  
Let the Second rod then, as before described, be the Standard of measure; and let it be divided into five equal parts, each of which shall be called a Foot: for perhaps it may be better, generally to retain the name of the nearest present measure, where there is one tolerably near. It will be about one quarter of an inch shorter than the present foot.  
  
Let the foot be divided into 10. inches;  
  
The Inch into 10. lines;  
The line into 10. points;  
  
Let 10. feet made a decad;  
  
10. decads a rood;  
10. roods a furlong;  
10. furlongs a mile.  
  
  
  
Superficial measures.  
Superficial measures have been estimated, and so may continue to be, in squares of the measures of length, except in the case of lands, which have been estimated by squares called roods and acres. Let the Rood be equal to a square, every side of which is 100. feet. This will be 6.483 English feet less than the English rood every way, and 1311. square feet less in it’s whole contents; that is to say, about one eighth, in which proportion also, 4 rood will be less than the present acre.  
Measures of capacity  
Let the Unit of capacity be the cubic foot, to be called a Bushel. It will contain 1620.23 cubic inches English; be about ¼less than that before proposed to be adopted as a medium; 1/10 less than the bushel made from 8. of the Guildhall gallons, and 1/14 less than the bushel made from 8. Irish gallons of 217.6 cubic inches.  
  
Let the bushel be divided into 10. pottles;  
  
Each pottle into 10. demi-pints;  
Each demi-pint into 10. metres, which will be of a cubic inch each.  
  
Let 10. bushels be a quarter, and  
  
10. quarters a last or double-ton.  
The measures for use being foursided and the sides and bottoms rectangular,  
The bushel will be a foot cube;  
The pottle 5. inches square and 4. inches deep;  
The demi-pint 2. inches square and 2½ inches deep;  
The Metre an inch cube.  
  
Weights.  
Let the weight of a cubic inch of rain-water or the thousandth part of a cubic foot be called an ounce; and let the ounce be divided into 10 double scruples; the double scruple into 10. carats; the carat into 10. minims or demi-grains, the minim into 10. mites.  
Let 10. ounces make a pound; 10 pounds a stone; 10 stone a kental; 10 kental a hogshead.  
Coins.  
Let the Money-unit, or Dollar contain eleven twelfths of an ounce  of pure silver. This will be 376 Troy grains (or more exactly 376.02985 Troy grains,) which will be about a third of a grain (or more exactly .38985 of a grain) more than the present Unit. This with the twelfth of alloy, already established, will make the Dollar or Unit of the weight of an ounce, or of a cubic inch of rain water exactly. The series of Mills, Cents, Dimes, Dollars and Eagles to remain as already established.  
The Second rod, or the Second pendulum, expressed in the measures of other countries, will give the proportion between their measures and those of the U.S.  
Measures, weights, and coins thus referred to standards, unchangeable in their nature, (as is the length of a rod vibrating seconds, and the weight of a definite mass of rain water) will themselves be unchangeable. These standards too are such as to be accessible to all persons, in all times and places. The measures and weights derived from them fall in so nearly with some of those now in use, as to facilitate their introduction; and being arranged in decimal ratio, they are within the calculation of every one who possesses the first elements of arithmetic, and of easy comparison, both for foreigners and citizens, with the measures, weights, and coins of other countries.  
A gradual introduction would lessen the inconveniences which might attend too sudden a substitution, even of an easier, for a more difficult system. After a given term, for instance, it might begin in the Custom houses, where the merchants would become familiarised to it. After a further term, it might be introduced into all legal proceedings, and merchants, and traders in foreign commodities, might be required to use it in their dealings with one another. After a still further term, all other descriptions of people might recieve it into common use.—Too long a postponement on the other hand, would increase the difficulties of it’s reception, with the increase of our population.

In the Second pendulum with a Spherical Bob, call the distance between the centers of suspension and of the Bob, 2 x 19.575, or 2d. and the radius of the Bob = r. Then 2d : r :: r : r²/2d and ⅖ of this last proportional expresses the displacement of the center of oscillation, to wit 2rr/5 x 2d = rr/5d. 2 inches have been proposed as a proper diameter for such a Bob. In that case r. will be = 1. I and rr/5d = 1/97.87 I. In the Cylindrical Second rod, call the length of the rod 3 x 19.575, or 3d. and it’s radius = r. and rr/2 x 3d = rr/6d will express the displacement of the center of oscillation. It is thought the rod will be sufficiently inflexible if it be ⅕ of an inch in diameter. Then r. will be = .1 I. and = rr/6d = 1/11745I. which is but the 120th. Part of the displacement in the case of the pendulum, with a Spherical Bob; and but the 689710th. part of the whole length of the rod. If the rod be even of half an inch diameter, the displacement will be but 1/1879 of an inch, or 1/110356 of the length of the rod.  
  
  
  
Sr. Isaac Newton computes the pendulum for 45.° to be 36. pouces 8.428 lignes. Picard made the English foot 11. pouces 2.6 lignes, and Dr. Maskelyne 11. pouces 3.11 lignes. D’Alembert states it at 11. pouces 3. lignes, which has been used in these calculations as a middle term, and gives us 36 po.—8.428 li. = 39.1491 inches. This length for the pendulum of 45.° had been adopted in this report before the Bishop of Autun’s proposition was known here. He relies on Mairan’s ratio for the length of the pendulum in the latitude of Paris, to wit, 504 : 257 :: 72. pouces to a 4th. proportional, which will be 36.71428 pouces = 39.1619 inches, the length of the pendulum for Lat. 48°—50.’ The difference between this and the pendulum for 45.° is .0113 of an inch: so that the pendulum for 45.° would be estimated according to Mairan at 39.1619—.0113 = 39.1506 inches, almost precisely the same with Newton’s computation herein adopted.

The fecretary of fate, to whom was referred, by the haufe of reprefentatives, “ts  
prepare and report a proper plan or plans sor cftablijoing untjormity in the cur-  
rency, weights, and meajures of the united flates, in obedience thereto, makes the  
Soliowing REPOR T:  
  
TO obtain uniformity in meafures, weights, and coins, it is neceflary to find fome  
meaiure of invariable length, with which, as a ftandard, they may be compared,  
  
There exifts not in nature, as far as has been hitherto obferved, a fingie fubjeé  
or ‘pecies of fubjeét, acceflible to man, which prefents one conflant and uniform  
dimerfion.  
  
The globe of the earth itfelf, indeed, might be confidered as invariable in al]  
its dimenfions, and that its circumference would furnifh an invariable meafure:  
but no one of its circles, great or fmall, is acceflible to admeafurement through  
all its parts: and the various trials, to meafure definite portions of them, have  
been of fuch various refult, as to thew thereis no dependence on that operation for  
eertainty.  
  
Matter then, by its mere extenfion, furnifhing nothing invariable, its motion  
is the only remaining refource.  
  
The motion of the earth round its axis, though not abfolutely uriform and in-  
variable, may be confidered as fuch for every human purpote, It is meafured ob-  
vioully, but unequally, by the departure of a given meridian from the fun, and its  
reiurn to it, conitituting a folar day. Throwing together the inequalities of folar  
days, 2 mean interval, or day, has been found, and divided, by very general con-  
fent, into eighty-fix thoufand four hundred equal parts.  
  
A pendulum, vibrating freely, in fmall and equal arcs, may be fo adjufted in  
itslength, as, by its vibrations, to make this divifion of the earth&#x27;s motion into  
éighty-tfix thoufand four hundred equal parts, cailed feconds of mean tine.  
  
Such a pendulum, then, becomes itlelf a meafure of determinate length, to  
which ali others may be referred, as toa ftandard.  
  
But even the pendulum is not without its uncertainties.  
  
I. The difficulty of afcertaining in pragtice its centre of ofcillation, as depend-  
ing on the form of the bob, and its diftance from the point of iufpenfion—the  
effe&amp; of the weight of the fufpending wire, towards difplacing the centre of  
ofc ijlation—that center being feated within the body of the bob, and, therefore,  
inacceflible to the meafure—are fources of confiderable uncertainty.  
  
Il. Both theory and experience prove, that to preferve its ifochronifin, it mu  
be fhorter towards the equator, and longer towards the poles.  
  
III. The height of the fituation, above the common level, as being an_ incre-  
ment to the radius of the earth, diminifhes the length of the pendulum.

IV. The pendulum b.ting made of metal, as is elt, it varies its length  
with the variations in the temperature of the atmoiphere.  
  
V. To continue fmall and equal vibrations, through a fufficient length of  
time, and to count thete vibrations, machinery and a power are neceflary, whch  
may exert a fmall, but co aftant effort to renew the waite of notion: and the uit-  
ficulty is, fo to apply thefc:, as that they fhall neither retard nor accelerate the  
vibrations.  
  
1. In order to avoid the uncertainti:s, which refpect the centre of ofciliaticn, it  
has been propofed by mr. L tflie, an ingenious artift of Philadelphia, to fubfiture,  
for the pendulum, an unifor u cylindrical rod, without a bob.  
  
Could the diameter of fuch a rod be infinitely {mall, the centre of ofcillation  
would be exactly at two-thirds: of the whoie iength, meafured from the point of  
fufpenfion. Giving it. diamete.t which fhall render it fufhciently inflexible, the  
centre will be diipiaced, mdeed ; but, in a fecond rod, not the (1.) 602,000th part  
of its length, and not the hundre (th part as much as in a fecond penduium, win  
  
a ipherical bob, of proper diametei*. This difplacement is fo infinitely minu‘e,  
  
ict  
  
then, that we may confider the centre of ofcillation, for all praétice! purpoles, as  
reliding at two-thirds of the length, trom the centre of fufpeniion. The diitance  
between theie two centres might be eafily and accurately afce.tained in practice,  
But the whole rod is better for a ftandard, than any portion oi it, becaule jenubiy  
defined at both tts extvenuties.  
  
2. The uncertainty arifing from the difference of length requifite for the  
cond pendulum, or the fecond rod, in different latitudes, may be avoided by ix.  
ing on fome one Jatitude, to which our ftandard fhail reter. That of 38°, as  
being the middle latitude of the united ftates, might feem the moit convenicnr,  
were we to confider ourfelves alone: but connected with other nations by con-  
merce and {cience, it is better to fix on that parallel, which biss juireit to be  
adopted by them alfo. The forty- fifth, as being the middle term betwen + e  
equator and pole, has been heretofore propoted in Europe : and the propolition  
  
t  
  
been lately renewed there, under circumitances which may very poilibiy give 3  
fome effeét. This parallei is diftinguifhed with us alfo, as form ug our principal  
northern boundary. Let the compietion of the forty-fitth degree then vive  
  
the ftandard for our union, with the hope that it may become a line of u: lvl  
with the refit of the world.  
  
The difference between the fecond rod for 45 ° of latitude, and that for 31°,  
our other extreme, 16 to be examined.  
  
The fecond pendulum for 45° of latitude, accordiug to fir Ifaac Newton&#x27;s  
omputation, muit be of (3.) 39.14912 inches, Englifh meafure: and arod, to  
vibrate in the {ame time, mult be of the fame length between the centres of ju;-  
penfion and oicillation, and, coniequently, its whole length 58.7 (or more exactiy  
§8.72368) imches, This is longer than the rod, which fhall vibrate feconds in  
31° of latitude, by about g}g part of its whole length; a difference (&amp; :a1-  
nute, that it might be neglected, as infenfible, for the common purpoles of lit  
but in cafes requiring perte&amp;t exaétnefs, the fecond rod, found by trial of ity vi  
brations in any part of the united ftates, may be corrected by computation tor  
the (3.) latitude of the place, and fo brought exaétly to the itandard of 45 °  
  
3- By making the experiment in the level of the ocean, the difference will  
avoided, which a higher pofition might occafion.  
  
4. The expanfion and contraétion of the rod, with the change of temperature, ‘s  
the fourth fource ot uncertainty before mentioned. Ac scording to the “en aut  
  
rity, fo often quoted, an iron rod, of given length, may vary, between fuamer and  
winter, = taagerete latitudes, and in the common expofure of houle-clocks,

This feems to have been fo combined as to render it indifferent whether a thing  
were dealt out by weight or meafure ; for the dry gallon of wheat, and the liquid  
one of wine were of the fame weight: and the avoirdupois pound of wheat, and  
the troy pound of wine, were of the fame meature. Water and the vinous liquors,  
which enter moft into commerce, are fo nearly of a weight, that the difference, in  
moderate quantities, would be negleéted by both buyer and feller; fome of the  
wines being a little heavier, and fome a little lighter than water.  
  
Another remarkable correfpondence is that between weights and folid meafures.  
For 1000 ounces avoirdupois of pure water, fill a cubic foot, with mathematical  
exactnefs,  
  
What circumftances of the times, or purpofes of barter or commerce, called  
for this combination of weights and meafures, with the fubjeéts to be exchanged  
or purchafed, are not now to be afcertained. But a triple fet of exact proportion-  
ais, reprefenting weights, meafures, and the things to be weighed and mea{ured,  
and a relation {o integral, between weights and folid meafures, muft have been  
the refult of defign and {cientific calculauon, and not a mere coincidence of ha-  
zard. It proves, that the dry and wet mealures, the heavy and light weights, mut  
have been original parts of the fyftem they compofe: contrary to the opinion of  
the committee of 1757—1752, who thought, that the avoirdupois weight was not  
an ancient weight of the kingdom, nor ever even a legal weight, but during a  
tingle year of the reign of H. 8. and therefore, concluded, otherwife than will be  
here propofed, to {upprefs it altogether, Their opinion was founded chiefly on the  
lilence of the laws, as to this weight. But the harmony here developed in the  
fyitem of weights and meafures, of which the avoirdupois makes an_ effential  
member, corroborated by a general ule, from very high antiquity, of that, or of a  
nearly fimilar weight under another (6.) name, feem ftronger proofs, that this is  
a legal weight, than the mere filence of the written laws is of the contrary.  
  
Be this as it may, it is in fuch general ufe with us, that, on the principle of  
popular convenience, it’s higher denominations, at lea&#x27;i, muft be preferved. It is  
by the avoirdupois pound and ounce, that our citizens have been uted to buy and  
ici]. But the fmaller fubdivifions of drams and quarters, are not in ule with them.  
On the other hand, they have been ufed to weigh their money and mediciné with the  
penny-weights and grains troy-weight, and are net in the habit of ufing the  
pounds and ounces of that feries. It would be for their convenience, then, to  
juppreis the pound and ounce troy, and the dram and quarter avoirdupois ; and  
to turm iato one fe ries the avoirdupois pound and ounce, and the ony penny-  
weight and grain. “Che ayowdupois ounce contains 18 penny-weishts 5} grains  
troy- sects Divide itthen into 18 penny-weights, and the penny - -weight, as here-  
tofore, into 24 grains ; and the new penny-weight will contain between s third and  
a quarter of a grain more than tne prefent troy penny-weight; or, more accu-  
rately, it will be to that, as 875 to 864, a difference not to be noticed, either in mo-  
ney or medicine, below the denomination of an ounce.  
  
But it wall be nece flary to refer thete weights to a determinate mafs of fome  
fubftance, the {pecific gravity of which is invariable, Rain-water is fuch a tub-  
ftance, and may be referred to eyery where, and through all tame. It has been  
found, by aecurate experiments, that a cubic foot of rain-water weighs 1000  
ounces avoirdupois, tiandard weights of the exchequer, Itis true, that among  
thefe ttandard weights, the committee report finall variations ; but this experiment  
snuit decide in favour of thole particular weigits, between which and an integral  
mals of water, fo remarkable a coincidence has been found. ‘To render this ftan-  
dard more exaét, the water thould be weighed always inthe fame tempevature ot  
air; as heat, by increafing its volume, leilens its ipecific gravity. “he cellar ¢i  
uniform temperatuie is bett tor this alio. :

weight of a cubic foot of rain-water, weighed in the ftandard temperature ; that  
the feries of weights of the united ftates thall confit of pounds, ounces, penny-  
weights, and grains ; whereof 24 grains fhall be one penny-weight, 18 penny-  
weights one ounce, 16 ounces one pound.  
  
Coins.  
  
Congrefs in 1786 eftablithed the money unit at 375.64 troy srains of pure filver.  
It is propofed to enlarge this, by about the third of a grain, in weight, or a mill,  
infvalue ; that is to fay, to eftablifh it at 376 (or, more exactly, 376.029%5) in-  
ftead of 375.64 grains; becaufe it will be thewn that this, as the unit of coins  
will link in fyftem with the units of length, furface, capacity, and weight, when-  
ever it fhall be thought proper to extend the decimal ratio through all thefe  
branches. It is to preferve the poffibility of doing this, that this very minute al-  
teration is propofed.  
  
We have this proportion, then, 875 to 864, as 376.02985 grains troy to  
371.3026, the expreffion of the unit in the new grains.  
  
Let it be declared, therefore, that the money unit, or dollar of the united  
tates, fhall contain 371.3 American grains of pure filver.  
  
If nothing more then be propofed, than to render uniform and ftable the fy!-  
tem we already poffefs, this may be effected on the plan herein detailed; the fum  
of which is, 1. That the prefent meafures of length be retained and fixed by  
an invariable ftandard: 2. That the meafures of furface remain as they are,  
and be invariable allio, as the meafures of length, to which they are to refer:  
3- That the unit of capacity, now to equivocal, be fettled at a medium and  
convenient term, and defined by the fame invariable meafures of length: 4. That  
the more known terms, in the two kinds of weights, be retained, and reduced to  
one feries ; and that they be referred to a definite mafs of fome fubftance, the fpe-  
cific gravity of which never changes: And 5. That the quantity of pure filver  
in the money unit be expreffed in parts of weights fo defined.  
  
In the whole of this, no change is propofed, except an inlenfible one in the  
troy grain and penny-weight, and the very minute one in the money unit.  
  
II. But if it be thought that, either now or at any future time, the citizens  
of the united ftates may be induced to undertake a thorough reformation of their  
whole fyftem of meafures, weights, and coins, reducing every branch to the fame  
decimal ratio already eftablithed in their coins, and thus bringing the calculation  
of the principal affairs of life within the arithmetic of every man, who can mul-  
tiply and divide plain numbers, greater changes will be neceffary.  
  
The unit of meafure is ftill that which muft give law through the whole {yftem :  
and from whatever unit we fet out, the coincidences between the old and new  
ratios will be rare. All that can be done, will be to choofe fuch an unit as will  
produce the moft of thefe. In this refpeét, the fecond rod has been found, on  
trial, to be far preferable to the fecond pendulum.  
  
Mea/fures of length.  
  
Let the fecond rod, then, as before defcribed, be the ftandard of meafure ; and  
let it be divided into five equal parts, each of which fhall be called a foot: for, per-  
haps, it may be better generally to retain the name of the neareft pretent mea-  
jure, where there is one tolerably near. It will be about one quarter of an inch  
fhorter than the prefent foot.  
  
Let the foot be divided into 10 inches ; the inch into 10 lines ; the line into 10  
points: let to feet make adecad ; 10 decadsa rood; 10 roods a furlong; 10  
turlongs a mile.  
  
Superficial meafures.  
  
Superficicl meafures have been eftimated, and fo may continue to be, in fquares  
of the meafures of length, except in the cafe of lands, which have been eftimated  
hy squares, called roods and acres, Let the rood be equal to a fquare, every fide

Meafures of capacity.  
  
Let the unit of capacity be the cubic foot, to be called a bufhel. It will con-

bic inches.  
  
Let the buthel be divided into 10 pottles ; each pottle into 10 demi-pints, each  
demi-pint into 10 metres, which will be of a cubic inch each,  
  
Let 10 buthels be a quarter, and 1@ quarters a laft, or double ton.  
  
The meafures for ufe being fourfided, and the fides and bottoms rectangu-  
lar, the bufhel will be a foot cube.  
  
The pottle 5 inches fquare and 4 inches deep ; the demi-pint 2 inches fquare,  
and 24 inches deep ; the metre, am inch cube.  
  
Weights.  
  
Let the weight of a cubic inch of rain water, or the thoufandth part of a cnbic  
foot, be called an ounce ; and let the ounce be divided into ten double feruples ;  
the double fcruple into ten carats ; the carat into ten minims, or demi-grains ; the  
minim into ten mites. Let ten ounces make a pound; ten pounds a ftone; ten  
{tones a kental ; ten kentals a hogflead.  
  
Coins.  
  
Let the money unit, or dollar, contain eleven twelfths of an ounce of pure fil-  
ver. This wiil be 376 troy grains (or, more exa@tly, 376.0298 5 troy grains) which  
will be about a third of a grain (or, more exaétly, .38985 of a grain) more than  
the prefent unit. This, with the twelfth of alloy, already eftablithed, will make  
the dollar or unit, of the weight of an ounce, or of a cubic inch of rain-water  
exagily. ‘The feries ot mills, cents, dimes, dollars, and eagles to remain as al-  
ready eitablifhed. (8.)  
  
The fecond rod, or the fecond pendulum, exprefled in the meafures of other  
countries, will give the proportion between their meafures and thoie of the united  
ftates.  
  
Mecfures, weights, and coins, thus referred, to ftandards unchangeable in their  
nature (as is the length of a rod vibrating feconds, and the weight of a definite  
mafs of rain-water) will themfelves be unchangeable. Thefe ttandards too are  
fuch as to be acceflible to all perfons, in all times and places. The meafures and  
weights derived from them fall in fo nearly with tome of thofe now in ufé, as to  
facilitate their introduétion ; and, being arranged in a decimal ratio, they are  
within the calculation of every one who poffefles the firtt elements of arithmetic, and  
of eafy comparifon, both for foreigners and citizens, with the meafures, weights,  
and coins of other countries.  
  
A gradual introduftion would leffen the inconveniences, which might attend  
too fudden a {ubftitution, even of an eafier, for a more difficult fyftem. After a  
given term, for initance, it might begin in the cuflom-houfes, where the mer-  
chants wouid become familiarized to it. After a further term, it might be in-  
troduced into all legal proceedings : and merchants and traders in foreign com-  
modities, might be required to ufe it in their dealings with one another. After a  
fill turther term, all other deicriptions ef people reight receive it into common  
ufe. Too long a poftponemant, on the other hand, would increafe the difficulties  
ef its reception with the increale of our population.

pouces 8.428 lignes. Picard made the Englifli foot 11 pouces 2 -6 lignes, and  
dr. Mafkelyne 11 pouces 3.11 lignes. D’Alembert ftates it at 11 pouces 3 lige  
nes, which has been uled in thefe calculations as a muddle term, and gives us  
pouces 36, lignes 3.428—39.1491 inches. This length for the pendulum of 45  
deg. had been adopted in this report before the bifhop of Autun’s pro; pofition was  
hepwis here. He relies on Mairan’s ratio for the length of the pendul iM in the  
Jatitude of Paris, to wit, 504 : 257: : 72 pouces toa 4th proportional, which wil be  
pouces 36.71428—39.1619 inches, the length of the rena latitude 43 leg.

The secretary of state, to whom was referred, by the  
house of representatives, to prepare and report @  
proper plan or plans for establishing uniformity in  
the currency, weights, and measures of the United  
Staies, in obedience thereto, makes the following  
  
REPORT.  
  
To obtain uniformity in measures, weights and  
coins, it is necessary to find some measure of inva-  
riable length, with which, as a standard, they may  
be compared.  
  
There exists not in nature, as far as has been hi-  
therto observed, a single subject or species of sub-  
ject, accessible to man, which presents one constant  
‘and uniform dimension.  
  
The globe of the earth itself, indeed, might be  
considered as invariable in all its dimensions, and  
that its circumference would furnish an invariable  
measure; but no one of its circles, great or small,  
is accessible to admeasurement through all its parts :  
and the various trials, to measure definite portions  
of them, have been of such various result, as to shew  
there is no dependence on that operation for cer-  
aunty.  
  
Matter then, by its mere extension, furnishing  
‘nothing invariable, its motion is the only remaining  
resource.  
  
The motion of the earth round its axis, thongh  
not absolutely uniform aud invariable, may be eon-  
sidered as such for everv hiunan purpose. It is  
measured obviously, but unequally, by the depar-  
ture of a given meridian from the sun, and its return  
to it, constituting a solar day. VUhrowing together  
the inequalities of solar days, a mean interval, or  
| day, has been found, and divided, by very general  
consent, mto eighty-six thousand four hundred equal  
| parts.  
  
A pendulum, vibrating freely, in small and equal  
arcs, may be so adjusted in its length, as, by its  
vibrations, to make this division of the earth’s mo-  
tion into eighty-six thousand four hundred equal  
parts, called seconds of mean time.

Such a pendulum, then, becomes itself a measure  
of determinate length, to which all others may be  
referred, as to a standard.  
  
But even the pendulum is not without its un-  
certainties,  
  
I. The difficulty of ascertaining in practice its  
centre of oscillation, as depending on the form of,  
the bob, and its distance frem the pgint of suspen-  
sion—the effect of the weight of the suspending  
wire, towards displacing the centre of oscillation—  
that center being seated within the body of the bob,  
and, therefore, inaccessible to the measure—are  
sources of considerable uneertainty.  
  
Ii. Both theory and experience prove, that to pre-  
Serve its isochronism, it must be shorter towards  
the equator, and longer towards the poles.  
  
Hit. The height of the sitnation, above the com-  
mon level, as being an increment to the radius of  
the earth, diminishes the length of the pendulum.  
  
IV. The pendulum being made of metal, as is  
best, it varies in length with the variations in the  
temperature of the atmosphere.  
  
VY. To continue small and equal vibrations,’  
through a sufficient length of time, and to count the  
vibrations, machinery and a power necessary, which  
may exert a small, but eonstant effort to renew the  
waste of motion: and the difficulty is, so to apply  
these, as that they shall ueither retard nor accelerate  
the vibrations.  
  
1. In order to avoid the uncertainties, which res-  
pect the centre of oscillation, it has been proposed  
by Mr. Leslie, an ingenious artist of Philadelphia,  
to substitute, for the pendulum, an uniform cylin-  
drical rod, without a bob.  
  
Could the diameter of such a red be infinitely  
small, the centre of oscillation would be exactly at  
two-thirds of the whole leagth, measured from the  
point of suspension. Giving it a diameter which  
shall render it sufficiently inflexible, the centre will  
be displaced, indeed ; but in a second rod, not the  
(1.) 600,000th part of its length, and not the hun-  
dredth part as much as in a second pendulum, with  
a spherical bob, of proper diameter. This displace-  
ment is so infinitely minute, then, that we my con-  
sider the centre of oscillation, for all practical pur-  
poses, as residing at two-thirds of the length, from  
the centre of the suspension. The distance between  
these two centres might be easily and accurately  
ascertained in practice. But the whole rod is better  
for a standard, than any portion of it, because sensi-  
bly defined at both its extremities. |  
  
2. The uncertainty arising from the difference of  
length requisite for the second pendulum, or the  
second rod, in different latitudes, may be avoided by  
fixing on some one latitude, to which our standard  
shall refer. That of 38°, as being the middle lati-  
tude of the United States, might seem the mest con-  
venient, were we to consider ourselves alone; but  
connected with other nations by commerce and sci-  
ence, it is better to fix on that parallel, which bids  
fairest to be adopted by them also. The forty-ffth,  
as being the middle term between the equator and  
pole, has been heretofore proposed in Europe; and  
the proposition has been lately renewed there, under  
circumstances which may very possibly give it some,  
effect. This parallel is distinguished with us also, as|  
forming our principal northern boundary. Let the  
completion of the forty-fifth degree then give thie,  
standard for our union, with the hope that it may  
become a line of union with the rest of the world.  
  
The difference between the second rod for 45° of|  
latitude, and that for 31°, our otherextreme, is to be  
examined.  
  
  
  
itn  
  
  
  
The second pendulum for 45° of latitude, aceord-  
ing to sir Isaac Newtan’s computation, must be of  
  
-  
  
(2.) 39,14912 inches, English measure: and a rod,  
to vibrate ia the same time, must be of the same  
length between the centres of suspension and oscil-  
lation, and, consequently, its whole length 58.7 (or  
more exactly 58,72368) inches. This is longer than  
  
|the rod, which shall vibrate seconds in 31° of Jati-  
  
tude, by about ¢49 part of its whole length; a dif-  
ference so minute, that it might be neglected, as  
insensible, for the common purposes of life: but in  
cases requiring perfect execiness, the second rod,  
found by trial of its vibrations in any part of the  
United States, may be corrected by computation for  
the (3.) latitude of the place, and so brouglit exactly  
to the standard of 45°. iki  
  
3. By making the experiment in the level of the  
ocean, the difference will be avoided, which a higher  
position might occasion.  
  
4. The expansion and contraction of the rod, with  
the change of temperature, is the fourth source of  
uncertainty before mentioned. According to the  
high authority, so often quoted, an iron rod, of given  
length, may vary, between summer and winter, m  
  
temperate latitudes, and in the common exposure of  
  
hasuse-clocks, from + 5_ tO s:/y¢ of its whole  
length, which, in arod of 58.7 inches, will be from  
about two to tree hundredths ofan inch. This may  
be avoided by adjusting and preserving the standard  
ina cellar, or other place, the temperature of which  
never vuries. Iron is named for this purpose, be-  
cause the least expansible of the metals.  
  
5. The practical difficulty, resulting from the  
effect of the machinery and moving power, is very  
inconsiderable in the present state of the arts: and  
in their progress towards perfection, will become  
less and less. ‘To estimate 2nd obviate this, will-be  
the artist’s province. It is as nothing, when com-  
pared with the sources of imaccuracy hitherto at-  
iending measures.  
  
Before guitting the subject of the inconveniences,  
some of which attend the pendulum alone, others,  
both the pendulum and ‘rod, it must be added, that  
the red would have an accidental, but very precious  
advantage over the pendulum in this country, in the  
eveut of our fixing the foot at the nearest aliquot  
part of either; for the difference between the com-  
mon foot aud those se to be dedueed, would bethree  
times yreater in the case of the penduluga, than in  
that of the rod.  
  
Let the standard of measure, then, be an uniform  
cylindrical rod of iron, ef such iength, as, im latitude  
45° in the level of the ocean, and in a cellar, or  
other place,

s divided into twelve  
ounces ; the ounce, according to the subdivision of  
the apothecaries, into 8 drams; the dram into 3  
scrujmes; the scruple mto 20 grains.  
  
Accor ding to the subdivision for gold and silver,  
the ounce is divided into 20 penny-weight; and the  
penny-weight into 24 grains.  
  
So that the pound troy contains 5760 grains, of  
which, 7,000 are requisite to meke the pouid avoir-  
dupas; of course the weight of ye pound troy is  
to that of the pound avoirdupois, as 5760 to 7000, or  
as 144 to 175.  
  
It is remarkable, that this is exactly the propor:  
tion of the ancient liquid gallon of Guildhall, of 224  
cubic inches, to the corn gallon of 272; for 224 are  
to 272, us 144 to 175 (4.)  
  
It is further remar kale still, that this is also the  
exact proportion between the specific weight, of any  
measure of wheat, and of the sane measure of water,  
  
  
  
Of the standard measures before stated, two are  
principally distinguished in authority and practice.  
The statute bushel of 2150 cubic inches, which  
gives a gallon of 268.75 cubic inches, and the stan-  
dard gallon of 1601, called the corn gallon, of 271 or  
272 cubic inches ; which has introduced the mer-  
cantile bushel of 2176 inches. The former of these  
is most used in some of the grain states, the latter in  
others. The middle term, of 270 cubic inches, may  
be taken as a mutual compromise of convenience,

opinion of the care with which they invested the  
‘contents of the ancient bushel, and also a belief,  
that there might exist evidence of it at that day,  
unknown to the committees of 1758 and 1759.  
  
We find - nina continued proportion, 64 to 77.7  
as 224 to 272, and as 144 to 175, that is to say, tire  
specific weight of a measure of wheat to that of  
the sanic measure of water, us the cubic contents of  
the wet-gullon, to those of the dry; and as. the  
weight ofa pound troy to that of a pound avou-  
dupois.  
  
‘This seems to have been so combined as to render  
it indifferent whether a thing were dealt out by  
weight or measure; for the dry gallon of wheat,  
and the liqnid one of wine were of the same weight ;  
and the avoirdupois pound ef wheat, and the trov  
pound of wine, were of the same measure. Water  
r ad the vinous liquors, which enter most into con-  
merce, are so nearly of a weight, that the ditterence,  
in moderate quantities, would be neglected by both  
vuyer and seller; some of the wines being a littic  
heavier, and some a litle lighter than water.  
  
Another remarkable correspondence is tat be-  
iween weights and solid measures. For 1000 ounces  
avoirdupois of pure water, fills a cubic fooi, Wik  
mathematical exactness.

exchanged or purchased, are not now to be ascer-  
taincd. But a triple set of exact proportionals,

representing weights, measures, and the things to  
be weighed and measured, and a relation so inte.  
gral, between weights und solid measures, must  
have been the result of design and scientific calcula-  
Jation, and not a mere coincidence of hazard. Ii  
proves, that the dry and wet measures, the heavy  
and light weights, must have been original parts of  
the system they compose : contrary to the opinion of  
the coinmittee of 1757—1758, who thought, that the  
bvoirdupois weight was not an ancient weight of the  
kingdom, nor ever even a legal weight; but during a  
single year of the reign of H. 8. and therefore, con-  
cluded, otherwise than will be here proposed, to  
suppress it altogether. Their opinion was founded  
chiefly on the silence of the laws, as to this weight.  
But the harmony here developed in the system of  
weights and measures, of which the avoirdupois  
makes an essential member, corroborated by a gene-  
ral use, from very high antiquity, of that, or of a  
nearly similar weight under another (6.) name, seem  
stronger proofs, that this is a legal weight, than  
the mere silence of the written laws is of the  
contriry.  
  
Be this as it may, it is in such general use with us,  
that, on the principal of popular convenience, its  
higher denominations, at least, must be preserved.  
It 1s by the avoirdupois pound and ounce, that our  
citizens have been used to buy and sell. But the  
smaller subdivisions of drams and quarters, are not  
in use with them. On the other hand, they have  
been used*to weigh their money and medicine with  
the penny-weights and grains troy-weight, and are  
not in the habit of using the pounds and ounces of

in weight, or a mill, im value; that is to say, to  
establish at 376 (or, more exactly, 376,02985) in-  
stead of 375.64 grains; because it will be shewn  
this, as the unit of coin, will link in system with the  
units of length, surface, capacity, and weight,  
whenever it shall be thought proper to extend the  
decimal ratio through all these branches. It is to  
preserve the possibility of doing this, that this very  
minute alteration is proposed.  
  
We have this proportion, then, 875 to 864, as  
376,02985 grains troy to 371,30261, the expression  
of the unit in the new grains.

or dollar of the United States, shall contain 371.3  
American grains of pure silver.  
  
If nothing more then be proposed, than to render  
uniform and stable the system we already possess,  
i&#x27;this may be effected on the plan herein detailed ;  
‘the sum of which is, 1. That the present measure of  
length be retained and fixed by an invariable stan-  
dard: 2. That the measures of surface remain as  
they are, and be invariable also, as the measures of  
length, to which they are to refer: 3. That the unit  
of capacity, now so equivocal, be settled at a medium  
and convenient term, and defined by the same inva-  
riable measures of length: 4. That the more known  
terms, in the two kinds of weights, be retained, and  
reduced to one series ; and that they be referred toa  
definite mass of some substance, the specific gravity  
of which never changes: And 5. That the quantity  
of pure silver in the money unit be expressed in  
parts of weights so defined.

that series. It would be for their convenience, then,  
to suppress the pound and ounce troy, and the dram)  
and quarter avoirdupois ; and to form into one series  
the avoirdupois pound and ounce, and the troy  
penny-weight and grain. The avoirdupois ounce  
contains 18 penny-weights 5 1-2 grains troy-weight.|  
Divide it then into 18 penny-weights, and the penny-  
weight, as heretofore, into 24 grains; and the new  
penny-weight will contain between a third and a  
quarter ofa grain more than the present troy penny-  
weight; or, more accurately, it will be to that, as  
875 to 864, a difference not to be noticed, either in  
money or medicine, below the denomination of an!  
ounce.  
  
But it will be necessary to refer these weights to  
a determinate mass of some substance, the specific  
gravity of which is invariable. Rain-water is such  
a substance, and may be referred to every where,  
and through all time. It has been found, by accu-  
yate experiments, that a cubic foot of rain-water  
weighs 1000 ounces avoirdupois, standard weight of  
the exchequer. It is true, that among the standard  
weights, the committee report small variations : but  
Uns experiment must decide in favor of those parti-  
cular weights, between which and an integral mass  
ot water, so remarkable a coincidence has _ been  
found. To render this standard more exact, the  
water should be weighed always in the same tempe-  
rature of air; as heat, by increasing its volume,  
lessens its specific gravity. The cellar of uniform  
  
Let it then be established, that an ounce is of the  
weight of a cube of rain water, of one-tenth of a foot,  
or rather, that it is the thousandth part of the weight  
of a cubic foot of rain-water, weighed in the stan-  
dard temperature ; that the series of weights of the  
Waited States shall consist of pounds, ounces, penny-  
weights, and grains ; whereof 24 grains shali be one  
peuny-weight, 18 penny-Weights ane ounce, 16

In the whole of this, no change is proposed, ex-  
cept an insensible one im the troy grain and penny-  
weight, and the very minute one in the money unit.  
  
II. But if it be thought that, either now or at any  
future time, the citizens of the United States may  
be induced to undertake a thorough reformation of  
their whole system of measures, weights and coins,  
reducing every branch to the same decimal ratio  
already established in their coins, and thus bringing  
the calculation of the principal affairs of life within  
the arithmetic of every man, who can multiply and  
divide plain numbers, greater changes will be ne-  
cessary.  
  
The unit of measure is still that which must give  
law through the whole system : and from whatever  
unit we set out, the coincidences between the old  
and new ratios will be rare. All that can be done,  
will be to choose such an unit as will produce the  
most of these. In this respect, the second rod has  
been found, on trial, to be far preferable to the  
second pendulum.  
  
Measures of length—Let the second rod, then, as  
before described, be the standard of measure ; and  
let it be divided into five equal parts, each of which  
shall be called a foot : for, perhaps, it may be better  
generally to retain the name of the nearest present  
measure, where there is one tolerably near. It will  
be about one quarter of an inch shorter than the  
present foot.  
  
Let the foot be divided into 10 inches; the inch  
into 10 lines; the line into 10 points: let ten feet  
make a decsd; 10 decads a rood; 10 roods a fur-  
long ; 10 furlongs a mile.  
  
Superficial measures.—Superticial measures have  
been estimated, and so may continue to be, in  
squares of the measures of length, except in the  
cuse of lands, which haye been estimated by squares,  
called roods and acres. Let the rood be equal to 2  
squere, every side of which is 100 feet. This will be  
6,483 English feet less, than the English (7.) rood  
every way, and 1311 square feet less im its whole

Measures of capacity.—Let the unit of capacity be  
the cubic foot, to be calied a bushel. It will contain  
1620.23 cubic inches, English ; be about one fourth  
less than that before proposed to be adopted as a  
medium ; one-tenth less than the bushel made from  
8 of the Guildhall gallons; and one-fourteenth less  
than the bushel made irom ¢ ivish gallons, of 217.6  
cubic inches. .  
  
Let the bushel be divided into 10 pottles; each  
pottle into 10 demi-pints, each demi-pint ‘into lv  
metres, which will be of a cubic inch each.  
  
Let 10 bushels be a quarter, and 10 quarters a  
Jast or double ton.  
  
The measures for use being foursided, and the  
sides and bottoms rectangular, the bushel will be a  
foot cube.  
  
The pottle 5 inches square and 4 inches deep ;  
the demi-pint 2 inches square, and 2 1-2 inches  
deep ; the metre, an inch cube.  
  
Weights—Let the weight of a cubic inch of rain  
water, or the thousandth part of a cubic foot, be  
called an ounce; and let the ounce be divided into  
ten double scruples; the double scruple into ten  
carats; the carat into ten minims, or demi-grains ;  
the minim into ten mites. Let ten ounces make a  
pound ; ten pounds a stone; ten stones a kental;  
ten Kentals a hogshead.  
  
Coins —Let the money unit, or dollar, contain  
eleven-twelfths of an ounce of pure silver. This  
wll be 376 troy grains (or, more exactly, 376,02985  
troy grains) which will be about a third of a grain  
(or, more exactly, .38985 of a grain) more than the  
present unit. This, with the twelfth alloy, already  
established, will make the dollar or unit, of the

rr—6d= 1—117.45 inches, which is but the 120th  
part of the displacement in the ease of the pendu-  
lum, with a spherical bob; and but the 689,710th  
part of the whole length of the rod. If the rod be

pendulum for 45 deg. to be 36 pouces 8,428 lignes.  
Picard made the English foot 11 pouces 2.6 lignes,  
and Dr. Maskelyne 11 pouces 3.11 lignes. D’Alem-  
bert states it at 11 pouces 3 lignes, which has been  
used in these calculations as a middle term, and  
gives us pouces 36, lignes 8,428—39,1491 inches.  
This lengih for the pendulum of 45 deg. had been  
adopted in this report before the bishop of Autun’s  
proposition was known here. He relies on Mairan’s  
ratio for the length of the pendulum im the latitude  
of Paris, to wit, 504:257::72 pouces to a 4th  
proportional, which will be pouces 36,71428=  
39,1619 inches, the length of the pendulum for lJa-  
titude 48 deg. 50. The difference between this and  
the pendulum for 45 deg. is .0113 of an inch : so that  
the pendulum for 45 deg. would be estimated, ac-  
cording to Mairan, at 39.1619.0113—39.1506 inches,  
almost precisely the same with Newton’s computa+

The First Congress passed a vote, 15th  
January, 1790, calling upon the Secretary  
of State for a “plan or plans for establishing  
uniformity in the currency, weights and  
measures of the United States.” In his  
  
very able report in reply, dated 4th July, |  
  
  
  
1790, Thomas Jefferson said: “The ex- |

1786, by declaring that there should be one  
money of account and payment through the  
United States, and that its parts and multi-  
ples should be in a decimal ratio, has ob-  
tained such general approbation both at home  
and abroad, that nothing seems wanting but  
the actual coinage to banish the discordant

the different states, and to establish in their |

The second plan was to reduce ‘‘every branch to the same decimal ratio

affairs of life within the arithmetic of every man who can multiply and

Except in the length of the fundamental unit, and in the nomenclature,  
this was essentially that of the metrical system of France.  
  
These two plans were sharply opposed to each other, and it was to be ex-  
pected that the desire for a decimal division, and symmetry of system on the  
one hand, and the reluctance to make a violent change on the other, should  
elicit no little discussion.
