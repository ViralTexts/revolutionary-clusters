Sir  
Philadelphia March 2. 1794.  
  
In your message to both Houses of Congress on the 5 of December 1793, you inform them  
that “the vexations and spoliations, understood to have been committed on our vessels  
and commerce, by the Cruisers and Officers of some of the belligerent powers appeared to  
require attention”: that “the proofs of these, however, not having been brought forward,  
the description of Citizens, supposed to have suffered, were notified, that on  
furnishing them to the Executive, due measures would be taken to  
obtain redress of the past, and more effectual provisions against the future;” and that “should such documents be furnished, proper representations  
will be made thereon, with a just reliance on a redress, proportioned to the exigency of  
the case.”  
On my succession to the department of State I found a large  
volume of complaints, which the notification had collected, against severities on our  
trade, various in their kind and degree. Having reason to presume, as the fact has  
proved, that every day would increase the catalogue, I have waited to digest the mass,  
until time should have been allowed for exhibiting the diversified forms, in which our  
commerce has hourly suffered. Every information is at length obtained, which may be  
expected.  
The sensations excited by the embarrassments, danger, and even ruin, which threaten our  
trade, cannot be better expressed, than in the words of the Committee of  
Philadelphia. After enumerating particular instances of  
injury, their representation to Government proceeds thus—  
“On these cases which are accompanied by the legal proofs the Committee think it  
unnecessary to enlarge; as the inferences will of course occur to the Secretary; but  
they beg leave to be permitted to state other circumstances which tho’ not in legal  
proof, are either of such public notoriety as to render legal proof unnecessary, or so  
vouched to the Committee as to leave them in no doubt of the truth of them.  
“It has become a practice for many of the privateers of the Belligerent Powers, to send  
into Port all American Vessels they meet with, bound from any of the French Ports in the  
West Indies, to the United States, and it is positively asserted that the owners of some  
of them have given general instructions to their Captains to that effect—And tho’ many  
of those Vessels have been afterwards liberated, yet the loss by plunder, detention and  
expence is so great as to render it ruinous to the American Owner—In many cases where  
the Cargoes have been valuable, the owners of the Privateers after acquittal have lodged  
appeals which they never intended to prosecute, but merely with a view of getting the  
property into their hands upon a valuation made so unfairly, as to insure them a  
considerable profit, even if they should be finally made liable.  
“Fourteen days only are allowed to an American owner to make his claim which renders it  
impossible for him except he is on the spot, and every difficulty  
which a combination of interested persons can devise is thrown in the way to prevent his  
getting security; and in few instances can it be done but by making over his Vessel  
&amp; Cargo to the Securities, and thereby subjecting himself to the heavy additional  
charge of Commission, Insurance &amp;c.—it may be added that the most barefaced bribery  
is sometimes practised to prevail on unwary boys or those who know little of the  
obligation of an Oath to induce them to give testimony in favor of the Captors.  
“Beside the cases here enumerated the committee have information of a number of vessels  
belonging to this Port, being captured, and carried into different Ports, but as the  
legal proofs are not come forward they forbear to mention them.  
“It is proper however for them to add that besides the loss of property occasioned by  
those unjust captures &amp; detentions the masters and crews of the Vessels are  
frequently subjected to insults &amp; outrages that must be shocking to Americans. Of  
this the case of Captn Wallace is an instance, there are others within the knowledge of  
the committee of which they only wait the legal proof to lay them before the  
Secretary.  
“To this list of grievances the Committee are sorry to find it their duty to add that  
by reason of the vexation loss and outrages suffered by the Merchants of the United  
States it’s commerce already begins to languish, and it’s products are likely to be left  
upon the hands of those who raise them. Prudent men doubt the propriety of hazarding  
their property when they find that the strictest conformity with the laws of nations, or  
of their own Country will not protect them from the rapacity of men who are neither  
restrained by the principles of honor, nor by Laws sufficiently coercive to give  
security to those who are not subjects of the same Government.  
“The Committee conclude this representation with an assurance that they have in no  
degree exaggerated in the statement they have made, and that they will continue to  
communicate all such information as they may further receive, of which nature before the  
closing of this report they are sorry to add is that of the irruptions of the Algerines  
from the Mediterranean in consequence of a truce concluded with that regency it is said  
by the British Minister on behalf of Portugal &amp; Holland—This  
alarming event to which some American Ships we hear have already  
become Victims is of so distressing a nature as must soon deprive us of some of the most  
lucrative branches of our Commerce, if not speedily checked or prevented. The immediate  
rise it has produced in Insurance and the fears it may instil into our Seamen and  
Commanders are of a nature highly deserving the serious consideration of Government, on  
whose protection and zeal for the interests commercial and agricultural of the Country  
the committee implicitly rely.”   
In a supplementary letter the Committee of Philadelphia, make this conclusion; [“]that  
the cases, which they recite, and others less formally announced serve to shew, that  
there are frequent instances of suppression of papers, registers &amp;c: very  
prejudicial to our shipping⟨,⟩ on their trials, and of injuries—by the destruction of  
Letters, to the general correspondence of the Country with foreign nations.”   
When we examine the documents, which have been transmitted from different parts of the  
Union, we find the British, the French, the Spaniards and the Dutch, charged with  
attacks upon our Commerce.  
It is urged against the British—  
1. That their privateers plunder the American Vessels; throw them out of their  
cour⟨s⟩e, by forcing them upon groundless suspicions into ports other than those to  
which they were destined; detain them even after the hope of a regular confiscation is  
abandoned; by their negligence, while they hold the possession, expose the cargoes to  
damage, and the vessels to destruction—and maltreat their crews.  
2. That British Ships of war, have forcibly seized mariners belonging to American  
vessels, and in one instance under the protection of a Portuguese fort.  
3. That by British regulations and practice our Corn and provisions are driven from the  
ports of France; and restricted to ports of the British &amp; those of their  
friends.  
4. That our vessels are not permitted to go from the British ports in the Islands,  
without giving security, (which is not attainable but with difficulty and expense), for  
the discharge of the Cargo in some other British or a neutral port.  
5. That without the imputation of a contraband trade as defined by the law of  
nations, our vessels are captured for carrying on a  
commercial intercourse with the French West Indies, altho’ it is  
tolerated by the laws of the French Republic: and that for this extraordinary conduct no  
other Excuse is alledged than that by some edict of a King of France, this intercourse  
was prohibited—and  
6. That the conduct of the British Admiralty in the Islands, is impeachable for an  
excess of rigor, and a departure from strict judicial purity; and the expences of our  
appeal to England too heavy to be encountered, under all the circumstances of  
discouragement.  
Against the French it is urged.  
1. That their privateers harrass our trade no less than those of the British.  
2. That two of their Ships of war have committed enormities on our vessels.  
3. That their Courts of Admiralty are guilty of equal oppression.  
4. That besides these points of accusation, which are common to the French and  
British—the former have infringed the Treaty between the United States and them, by  
subjecting to seizure and condemnation our vessels, trading with their enemies in  
merchandize which that treaty declares not to be contraband; and under circumstances not  
forbidden by the law of Nations.  
5. That a very detrimental embargo has been laid upon large numbers of American vessels  
in the French ports; (There is reason to believe that the embargo was removed in  
December last, and the detention compensated by an order of the Committee of public  
safety in France)—and  
6. That a Contract with the French Government for Coin had been discharged with  
depreciated assignats.  
Against the Spaniards the outrages of privateers are urged; and against the Dutch one  
condemnation in the Admiralty is insisted to be unwarrantable.  
Under this complication of mischief, which persecutes our commerce, I beg leave Sir, to  
submit to your consideration, whether as far as facts may justify, representations ought  
not to be immediately pressed upon the foreign Governments in those of the preceding  
cases for which they are responsible. Among these I class, first the violences  
perpetrated by public Ships of war; secondly prohibitions or regulations, inconsistent  
with the law of nations; thirdly the improper conduct of Courts; fourthly, infractions of treaty; fifthly—the imposition of embargoes; and  
sixthly—the breach of public Contracts. How far a government is liable to redress the  
rapine of privateers, depends upon the peculiarities of the case. It is incumbent upon  
it, however, to keep its Courts freely open; and to secure an impartial hearing, to the  
injured applicant. If the rules, prescribed to privateers, be too loose, and  
opportunities of plunder or ill treatment be provoked from that cause, or from the  
prospect of impunity, it is impossible to be too strenuous in remonstrating against this  
formidable evil.  
Thus, Sir, have I reduced to general heads the particular complaints; without making  
any inquiry into the facts beyond the Allegations of the parties interested.  
I will only add, that your message seems to promise to Congress some statement upon  
these subjects. I have the honor, sir, to be with the highest  
respect yr mo. ob. serv.

Pliladelphia, March o, 1794.  
SIR,  
IN your meflage to both Houses of Congress,  
on the sth of December, 1793, you inform  
them, that ¢ the vexations and {poliations un­  
‘¢ derftood to have been committed on our vef­  
‘¢ {els and commerce, by the cruifersand officers  
of some of the belligerent powers, appeared to  
‘“ require attention :—That ¢¢ the proofs of  
““ these, however, not having been brought for­  
‘“ ward, the description of citizens, supposed to  
o Ilave fuffered, were notified, that on furnifh­  
““ Ing them to the executive, due measures  
‘“ would be taken to obtain redress of the pait,  
¢¢ and more effeftual provisions against “the fu­  
¢ ture,” and that ¢¢ should {uch documents be  
¢¢ furnifhed, proper representations will be made  
““ thereon, with a just reliance on a redress pro­  
¢¢ portioned to the exigencies of the case.”  
On my succession to the Department of State,  
I found a large volume of complaints, which  
the notification had collefted, against severities  
on our trade, various in their kind and degree.  
Having reason to presume, as the faét has prov­  
ed, that every day would increase the catalogue,  
I have waited to digest the mass, until time  
should have been allowed, for exhibiting the diver­  
fified forms, in which our commerce has hourly  
{uffered. Every information is at length obtain­  
ed, which may be expeéted.  
The sensations excited by the embarraflments,  
danger, and even ruin, which threaten our trade,  
cannot be better exprefled, than in the words of  
the committee of PKiladelphia. After enume­  
rating particular instances of injury, their repre­  
{entation to government proceeds thus ; ¢ On  
these cases, which are accompanied by the legal  
proofs, the committee think it necessary to en­  
large, as the inferences will, of course, occurto  
the Secretary ; but they beg leave to be per­  
mitted to ({ate other circumitances, which,  
though not in legal proof, are, either of f{uch  
public notoriety as to render legal proof unneces­  
sary, or so vouched to the committee as to leave  
them in no doubt of the truth of them.  
¢¢ It has become a praétice for many of the  
privateers of the belligerent powers,to fend into  
port all American veflels they meet with,  
bound from any of the French ports in the  
Welt-Indies, to the United States ; and 1t is  
positively asserted, that the owners of {ome of  
them have given general inftrutions to their  
captains to that ef%e&amp;——And though many of  
those veflels have been afterwards liberated, yet  
the loss by plunder, detention and expence, is so  
great as to render it ruinous to the American  
owner :—ln manr cases, where the cargoes  
_have been valuable, the owners of the priva­  
teers, after acquittal, have lodged appeals which  
they never intended to prosecute, but merely  
‘with a view of getting the property into their  
  
hands upo 4 valuation made {o unfairly, as te  
ensure them a considerable profit, even if they  
fhonld be finally made liable.  
‘¢ Fourteen days only, are allowed to an A­  
merican owner to make his claim, which renders  
it impossible for him, except he 15 on the fg_»o&#x27;t,  
and every difficulty which a combination of 1a  
terefted persons can devise, is&#x27; thrown in the  
way, to prevent his getting fecarity, and in few  
instances canit be done, but by making over his  
veflel and cargo to the securities, and thereby  
fubjetting himfelf to the heavy additional charge  
of commiflion, insurance, &amp;c.—lt may be ad­  
ded, that the most bare-faced bribery 1s {ome­  
times prattifed to prevail on unwary boys, or  
those who know little of the obligation of an  
oath, to induce them to give testimony in saver  
of the captors.  
¢t Besides the cases here enumerated, the  
committee have information of a number of vef­  
{els belonging to this port, being captured and  
carried into different pdrts ; but as the legal  
proofs are not come forward, they forbear to  
mention them.  
¢¢ Itls proper, however, for them to add,  
that besides the loss of property occasioned by  
those unjust captures and detentions, the masters  
and crews of the veflels are frequently {ubjetted  
to insults and outrages, that must be shocking to  
Americans. Of this, the case of Captain Wa L.-  
LACE 1s an instance—There are otheis within  
the knowledge of the committee, of which they  
only wait the legal proof, to lay them before  
the Secretary.  
“ To this lift of grievances, the committee  
are sorry to find it their duty to add, that by rea­  
son of the vexation, loss and outrages, fuffcred  
by the merchants of the United States, its com­  
merce already begins to languish, and its pro­  
duts are likely to be left upon the hands of  
those who raise them. Prudent men doubt the  
propriety of hazarding their property, when  
they find that the ftrifteft contormity with the  
laws of nations, or of their own country, will  
not protett them from the rapacity of men who  
are neither restrained by the principles of hon­  
or,nor by laws fufficieutly cocrfive to give {ecu­  
rity to those who are not fubjetts of the fame  
government.  
  
¢ The committee conclude this representa­  
tion, with an assurance, that they have, in no  
degree, exaggerated in the statement they have  
made, and that they will continue to communi­  
cate ali such information as they may further re­  
ceive ; of which nature, before the closing of  
this report, they are sorry to add, is that of the  
irruptions of the Algerines from the Mediterra­  
nean, in consequence of a truce concluded with  
that regency,itss said by the Britith minifter,on  
behalf of Portugal and Holland. This alarming  
event to which some American ships, we hear  
have already become vitims, is of {o diftrefling  
a nature, as must {oon deprive us of some of the  
most lucrative branches of our commerce, if  
not {peedily checked or prevented. The im­  
mediate rife it has produced in insurance, and  
the fears it may inflil into our seamen and com­  
manders, are of a nature highly deserving the  
{erious consideration of government, on whose  
protetion and zeal for the interefls, commercial  
and agricultural, of the country, the committee  
implicitly rely.”  
In a fuplementary letter, the committee of  
Philadelphia make this conclusion. ¢¢ that the  
cases which they recite; and others lels formally  
announced, serve to shew, that thereare frequent  
inflances of fuppreflion of papers, registers, &amp;c.  
very prejudicial to our shipping on their trials,  
and of mjuries by the deftru&amp;tion of letters, to  
the general correspondence of the country with  
foreign nations.”  
When we examine the documents, which  
have been transmitted from different parts of  
the Union, we find the Bnitifh, the French, the  
Spaniards, and the Dutch, charged with attacks  
upon our commerce.  
It 1s urged against the Britfh,  
1. That their privateers plunder the Ame­  
rican veflels, throw them out of their cour{e, by  
forcing them upon groundless suspicion, into  
ports, other than those, to which they were des­  
tined ; detain them, even after the hope of a  
-regular confifcation is abandoned ; by their neg­  
ligence, while they hold the pofleflion, expose  
the cargoes to damage, and the vellels to destruc­  
tion ; and mal-treat their crews.  
2. That British {hips of war have forcibly  
seized mariners, belonging to American veflels,  
and in one instance, under the protettion of a  
Portuguese fort.  
8. That by British regulations and pralice,  
our corn and provisions are driven from the  
yorts of France, and reflriéted to the ports of the  
Eriti{h, or those of their friends.  
4. That our veflels are not permitted to go  
from the British ports 1n the islands without  
giving security (which is not attainable but with  
difficulty and expence) for the discharge of the  
cargo, in some other British or a neutral port.  
5. &#x27;That without the inputation of a contra­  
band trade, as defined by the law of nations,  
our veflels are captured for carryiug on a com­  
mercial intercourse with the French Weit-  
Indies ; although it 1s tolerated by the laws of  
the French Republic, and that for this extraor­  
dinary conduft, no other excufle is alledged,  
than that by some edift of a King of France,  
this intercourse was prohibited and :  
6. That the condu&amp;t of the admiralty in the  
British islands, is impeachable for an excess of  
rigor, and a departure from {trié&amp; judicial puri­  
ty ; and the expenses of an appeal to. England,-  
too heavy to be encountered, under all the cir­  
cumstances of discouragement. 3  
- Against the French 1t 1s urged,

4 That besides these points of accusation,  
which are common to the French and Bnitifh,  
the former have infringed the treaty between  
the United States and them, by fubje@ting to  
seizure and condemnation our vellels trading  
with their enemies in merchandize, which that  
treaty declares not to be contraband, and under  
circumflances not forbidden by the law of na­  
tions.  
5+ That a very detrimental embargo has been  
laid upon large numbers of American vessels in  
the French ports ;* and,  
6. That a contraét with the French govern­  
ment for coin has been discharged in deprecia­  
ted aflignats.  
Againit the Spaniards the outrages of priva­  
teers are urged ;  
And against the Dutch, ene condemnation in  
the admiralty is insisted to be unwarrantable.  
Under this complication of mifchief, which  
persecutes our commerce, 1 beg leave, Sir, to  
submit to your consideration, whether represen­  
tations as far as fafts may juftify, ought not to  
be immediately pressed upon the foreign gov­  
ernments, 1n those of the preceding cases for  
which they are responsible.  
Among these, I class, 1. The vislences  
perpetrated by public ships of war. e¢. Prohi­  
bitions or regulations inconsistent with the law  
of nations. 3. The improper condu&amp; of courts.  
4. Infradlions of treaty. 5. The imposition of  
embargoes : _and, 6. The breach of public  
contratts. How far a government is liable to  
redress the rapine of privateers, depends upon  
the peculiarities of the cafe.—lt is incumbent  
upon it, however, to keep its courts treely  
open, and to secure an impartial hearing to the  
injured apphicant. 1f the rules prescribed to  
privateers, be too loose, and opportunities of  
plunder or 11l treatment be provoked from that  
cause, or from the profpeét of impunity, it is  
impoflible to be too itrenuous in remonttrating  
against this formidable evil. &#x27;  
Thus, Sir, have I reduced to general heads,  
the particular complaints, without making any  
inquiry to the fatts, beyond the allegations of  
the parties nterefted.  
I will ong add, that your meflage seems to  
romife to Congress some {tatement upon these  
Fubjc:&amp;s. I have the honor, Sir, to be, with  
the highest refpe&amp;t, Your most obedient servant,

^ drefs proportioned tu the*c:4i^ency  
of the cafe.&quot;  
  
On mv fucccflion to the dopart-  
ment of State, I found a large vo-  
lume of complaints, which ti\eno.  
tificatiou had collecled, aoainltle^  
veriiies cn our trade, various in  
their kind and dcgice. l:aving  
reafon to prefumt-.a-s the fa&lt;ft has  
proved, that every day would en-

ed to digell the r.raft, until lime  
ihould have been allowed, for ex-  
Jiibiting the divet fdied forms, in  
wliich &#x27;our commerce has hourly  
fuiFered. Every iulorniation is at  
leug&#x27;.h obtained, which may be  
expected.  
The fenfations excited by the em-  
&quot;l^ tarraliments, danger, and even ru-  
^^in, which threaten our trade, can-  
no: be better cxpi eflcd, than in the  
words of tht committee of Phila-  
dflphia :-«4«er enumerating par-  
ticular \mmcc^ oi v.&#x27;ja^y, incir  
reprefenvatjou to government pro-  
ceeds thus : Un_ thtfe cafes,  
which are accoir&gt;i&gt;anied by the le-  
gal proofs, the committee think it  
unnecefiary to enlarge, as the iu-  
fevences will, of courfe, occur to  
the Secretary ; but they beg leave  
y - to be permitted to Hate other cir-  
. cumkanccs which, though, not in  
le{£al proof are, either of Aich  
public notoriety as to render legal  
proof unnecefiary, or fo vouched  
to the committee as to leave them  
in no daubt of the truth of them.  
  
&#x27;&lt; It has become a pra&#x27;fuce for  
many of the privateers of the bel-  
lii&#x27;-erent i^owcrs, to fend into port  
arf America veiTels they meet  
vith, bound from any of the  
J rench ports in the Weft Indies,  
Ito the United States, and it is po-  
Mitivelvaflcrted, that the owners of  
fome oV them have given general in.  
ftrucdons to their captains to that  
fcftea— And though many of thole  
veAs have been afterwards libe-  
rvJ^L yet the lofs by plunder, de-  
tenpon and cxpenle, is fo great as  
to tender it ruinous to the Ameri-  
can owner: — In many cafes, where  
the cargoes have been valued, the  
owners of the privateers, after ac-  
quital, have lodged appeals which  
they never intended to profecute,  
but merely with a view of getting  
the property into their hands up-  
on a valuation made fo unfairly,  
as to enfure them a confiderable  
profit, even if they ftiould be final,  
ly made liable.  
  
Fourteen days only, are al-  
lowed •■o an American owner to  
make his claim, which renders it  
impolfible for him, except he is on  
the fpot, and every difficulty which  
a conibination of iuterefted perfons  
can devife, is thiown in the way,  
to prevent his getting iiecurity,  
  
in few in^&#x27;arces can it be done,  
but by making ever his \el\d and  
cargo to the lecurities, ami there-  
by liibjetfting hinifelf to the hcsiry  
additional charge of coniniiUion,  
infuiance, occ— It may be added,  
that the mcll barefaced bribery  
^rometijuespraetifed to prevail ou  
nnvvafry boys, or.tliofe who know  
litiic the ol ligation of an oath,  
to induce thc::i to give teltimony  
iu favor of ihc captors.  
  
Befidc the cnfes here enume-  
rated, the vO:nmittce have infor-  
mation of a number of vellels be-  
longing to this port, being captur-  
ed and (arrictl into d liferent ports,  
but as the legal proois are not come  
forward, they forbear to mention  
tliem.  
  
&quot; It is proper,however,for them  
to add, that beiides the lols of jiro-  
pcrty occafied bythofe unjiift cap-  
tnres and detentions, the nialltis  
and crews of the veflels are fre-  
quently fnbjci&#x27;ted to infulcs and  
outrages, tiiat nii^be fljockiiig to  
Americans. Of^s, the calt^ of  
capl. Vvalloce is an inltance.—  
^khere are others within the know-  
^fcge of the committee, of which  
they only wait the legal proof to  
lay them before the Secretary.  
  
&quot;To this liif of grievances&#x27;, th^  
comr.iiuce are forry to find it their/-  
duty add, that by reafon of they  
vexation, lofs, and outra&#x27;^es, fuf-,  
fercd by tlje mci chants of the U-  
nited Slates, its commerce already  
begins to langn^i, an&lt;l its products  
arc likely to ffe left upon the  
hands of thole who raife them.  
Prudent men doubt the propriety  
of hazarding their property, when  
they find that tlie ilricteft confor-  
mity with the laws of nations, or  
of theirov.n coinitry, will notpro-  
tecflthcm fiom therapaciiy ofujen  
who are neither reilrained by the  
principles of honor, nor by lavs  
liiiHciently coercive to give fecuri-  
ty to thoi&#x27;e, who are not fubjects of  
  
which they v.&#x27;ere uelllnrri ; detain  
them, even after the hope ofare-  
gular com&#x27;ifcation is abandoneil ;  
by their negligence, while they  
hold the poilellion, expofe the car-  
goes tq damage, and th&#x27;b vellels to  
deftru»ilion, and mal-treat their  
crews.  
  
2. That Biitiflifhips of war have  
forcibly fcized mariners, belonging  
to American vellels, and, in one  
inltanee, under the protetftion of  
a Portuguefc fort, ^  
  
3. That by Britifh regulations  
and practice, our. corn and provi-  
lions are driven from the ports of  
France, and reltr itfted to the ports  
of the Britilh, or thofe of their  
friends.  
  
4. That ourveflels are not per-  
mitted to go from the Britilli ports  
in the iliands without giving fe-  
curity (which is not attainable but  
with difficulty and expence) tor  
the dilcharge of the cargo, in foniC  
other Eritiih or neutral port.  
  
5. That V. idiout the imputation  
of a contraband trade, as defined  
by the law of nations, our vellels  
are captured for carrying on com-  
mercial intercourfe with ilief rench  
WelV Indies; although it is tole-  
  
rated by the laws ot the Frencl»\ ^

When we examine the documents which  
have been tranfmitted from different parts  
of the Union, we find the Britith, the  
French, the Spaniards, and the Dutch,  
charged with a’tacks upon our commerce.  
It is urged againit the Britifh,  
  
1. That their privateers plunder the  
American vellels, throw them cut of their  
courfe, by forcing them, upon groundlefs  
fafpicion, ino ports, other than thofe to  
which they are deftined; detain them, e.en  
after the hope of a regular confilcation  
is abandoned ; by their negligence, while they  
hold the potfefion, expofe their cargoes to  
damage, and the vefiels to de ftinétion, and  
maltreat their crews.  
  
2. That Britith thips of war have forci-  
bly feized mariners belonging to American  
veffels, and, in one inftance, under the  
protettion of a Portugueze Fort.  
  
3. That, by Britith regulations and prac-  
tice, our corn and provinves are driven  
from the ports of France, and reftriéte! to  
the ports of the Britifh, or thofe of their  
friends,  
  
4. That our veffels are not permitted to  
go from the Britifh ports in the Ifands  
without giving fecurity (which is not at-  
tainable bat with difficulty and expence}  
for the difcharge of the cargo in fome other  
Britith or an utral port.  
  
. That, without the imputation of a  
contraband trade, as defined by the !aw of  
mations, dur vefiels are Captured for care  
rying on a commercial intercourfe with the  
Frenth Weft-indies, a&#x27;though it is tolera-  
  
ted by the laws of the French Republic;  
and that, fer tis extreerdinaty conduct,  
no other excufe is allesta than that, by  
fome edit of a King of France, this  
intercourfe was prohi beted s and  
  
Gent. Mac. Sur, 1794.  
  
iI  
  
Inter gfing Intelligence from the American Congrefi.  
  
569  
  
6. That the condué&amp; of the Adntiralty  
in ye Britith Iflands is impeachable, for’  
an excefs of rigour, and a departure from  
ftri€t judicial purity; and the expences  
of an appeal to England: are too’ heavy  
to be encountered, under all the circum-  
ftances of difcouragement.  
  
Agai sft the French it is urged,  
  
1. That their privaeers harrafs our trade  
no lefs tha thofe of the Britith  
  
2. That wo of hheic fhips ‘war have  
committ. «) enormities on our yetfels.  
  
3. Hhat ther Courts of Adimual&#x27;y are  
guilty of equal oppre‘tion.  
  
4. That, befides thefe points of accufae  
tien, which are common to the French  
a! Botith, the former (the French) have  
infringed the treaty between the United  
Stites nd them, by fubjecting to feizure  
and condemnation our veffels trading with  
their enemies in merchandife which that  
treaty declares not to be contraband, and  
under curcnmitacces not forbidden by the  
Law of Nations.  
  
3. That a very detrimental embargo has  
been laid upon a large number of Asnerican  
veffels in the French ports *; and,  
  
6. That a contraét with the French Goe  
vernment for cornhas been &lt;cifcharged in  
depreciited affignats  
  
Againit the Spaniards the ou&#x27;razes of  
privateers are urged. And againft the  
Dutch, one condemnation in the Admirals  
ty infifted to be uawarrantable. +  
  
Under this complication of mifchief,  
which perfecutes our commerce, I beg  
leave, Sir, to fubmit to your confi&#x27;eration,  
whether reprefentations, as far as faéts may  
juftify, ought not to be immediately preffed  
upon the koreign Governments, in thofe of  
the preceding caf¢s fer which they are  
refponfible. Amon thefe { c&#x27;nfk—1, The  
violence perpetrated by public thips of war.  
2. Prohibitions, or regulations, inconfiftentc  
with the law of nations. 3. The improper  
conduét of Courts. 4. Infra@tions.of treaty.  
§- The imp fition of embargoes; and, 6.  
The breach of public contraéts. How fag  
a Government is liabde to redrefs the rapine  
of privateers depends upon the peculmri-  
ties of the cafe. Ic is incumbent upon it,  
however, to keep its Courts freely open,  
and to fecure an impartial hearing to the  
injured applicants, If the rules prefcribed  
to privateers be too loofe, and opportunites  
of plunder or ill4reatme nt be provoked  
from that cavfe, or from the profpe&amp; of  
impunity, it is impoffible to be too ftre«

Puitapetreuia, Maron 2, 1794.  
  
Sir— In your message to both Houses of Congress, on the  
5th December, 1793, you inform them, that “the vexations  
and spoliations, understoud to have been committed on our  
vessels and commerce, by the cruizers and officers of some of  
the belligerent powers, appeared to require attention: that the  
proofs of these, however, not having been brought forward, the  
description of citizens, supposed to have suffered, were noti-  
fied, that on furnishing them to the executive, due measures  
would be taken to obtain redress of the past, and more effect-  
ual provisions against the future,” and that “should such do-  
cuments be furnished, proper representations will be made  
thereon, with a just reliance on a redress proportioned to the  
exigency of the case.  
  
“On my accession to the Department of State, I found a  
large volume of complaints, which the notification had collect-  
ed, against severities on our trade, various in their kind and  
degree. Having reason to presume, as the fact has proved,  
that every day would increase the catalogue, I have waited to  
digest the mass, until time should have been allowed for exhi-  
biting the diversified forms, in which our commerce has hourly  
suffered. Every information is at length obtained, which may  
be expected.”  
  
The sensations excited by the embarrassments, danger, and  
even ruin, which threatened our trade, cannot be better ex-  
pressed, than in the words of the committee of Philadelphia.  
After enumerating particular instances of injury, their repre-  
sentation to government proceeds thus:  
  
“ On these cases, which are accompanied by the legal proofs,  
the committee think it unnecessary to enlarge, asthe inferences  
will of course occur to the Secretary; but they beg leave to be  
permitted to state other circumstances, which, though not in  
legal proof, are either of such public notoriety, as to render  
legal proof unnecessary, or so vouched to the committee, as to  
leave them in no doubt of the truth of them.  
  
“Tt has become a practice, for many of the privateers of the  
belligerent powers, to send into port all American vessels they  
meet with, bound from any of the French ports in the West

Indies, to the United States; and it is positively asserted, that  
the owners of some of them have given general instructions to  
their captains to that effect; and though many of those vessels  
have been afterwards liberated, yet the loss, by plunder, deten-  
tion, and expense, is so great as to render it ruinous to the  
American owner. In many cases, where the cargoes have been  
valuable, the owners of the privateers, after acquittal, have  
lodged appeals, which they never intended to prosecute, but  
merely with a view of getting the property in their hands, upon  
a valuation made so unfairly, as to ensure them a considerable  
profit, even if they should finally be made liable.  
  
“ Fourteen days only are allowed toan American owner, to  
make out his claim, which renders it impossible for him, un-  
less he is on the spot, and every difficulty which a combination  
of interested persons can devise, is thrown in the way, to pre-  
vent his getting security; and in few instances can it be done,  
but by making over his vessel and cargo to the securities, and  
thereby subjecting himself to the heavy additional charge of  
commission, ensurance, &amp;c. It may be added, that the most  
barefaced bribery is sometimes practised, to prevail on unwary  
boys, or those ole know little of the obligation of an oath, to  
induce them to give testimony in favor of the captors.  
  
“ Besides the cases here enumerated, the committee have in-  
formation of a number of vessels belonging to this port, being  
captured and carried into different ports; but as the legal  
proofs are not come forward, they forbear to mention them.  
  
“It is proper, however, for them.to add, that, besides the  
loss of property occasioned by those unjust captures and de-  
tentions, the masters and crews of the vessels are frequently  
subjected to insults and outrages, that must be shocking to  
Americans. Of this, the case of Captain Wallace is an in-  
stance. There are others within the knowledge of the com-  
mittee, of which they only wait the legal proof to lay them be-  
fore the Secretary.  
  
“ To this last list of grievances, the committee are sorry to  
find it their duty to add, that by reason of the vexation, loss,  
and outrages, suffered by the merchants of the United States,  
its commerce already begins to languish, and its products are  
likely to be left upon the hands of those who raise them. Pru-  
dent men doubt the propriety of hazarding their property,  
when they find that the strictest conformity with the laws of  
nations, or of their own country, will not protect them from  
the rapacity of men, who are neither restrained by the princi-  
ples of honor, nor by laws sufficiently coercive to give securi-  
ty to those, who are not subjects of the same government.  
  
“ The committee conclude this representation, with an assur-  
ance, that they have, in no degree, exaggerated in the state-  
ment they have made, and that they will continue to communi-  
cate all such information, as they may further receive; of which  
nature, before the closing of this report, they are sorry to add.

is that of the irriiptions of the Algerines from the Mediterra»  
nean, in consequence of a truce concluded with that regen-  
cy, it is said, by the British minister, on behalf of Portugal  
and Holland. ‘This alarming event, to which some American  
ships, we hear, have already become victims, is of so distressing  
a nature, as must soon deprive us of some of the most lucrative  
branches of our commerce, if not speedily checked or prevent-  
ed. The immediate effects it has produced in ensurance, and  
the fears it may instil into our seamen and commanders, are  
of a nature highly deserving the serious consideration of go-  
vernment, on whose protection and zeal, for the interests, com-  
mercial and agricultural, of the country, the committee impli-  
citly rely.”  
  
_In.a supplementary letter, the committee of Philadelphia  
make this conclusion: “ ‘That the cases which they recite, and  
others less formally announced, serve to show, that there are  
frequent instances of suppression of papers, registers, &amp;c..  
very prejudicial to our shipping on their trials, and of injuries,  
by the destruction of letters, to the general correspondence of  
the country with foreign nations.”  
  
When we examine the documents which had been transmit-  
ted from different parts of the Union, we find the British, the  
French, the Spaniards, and the Dutch, charged with attacks  
upon our commerce.  
  
It is urged against the British:—  
  
“1. That their privateers plunder American vessels, throw  
them out of their course, by forcing them, upon groundless sus-  
picion, into ports other than those to which they were destined;  
detain them even after the hope of a regular confiscation is  
abandoned, by their negligence, while they hold the possession,  
expose the cargoes to damage, and the vessels to destruction,  
and maltreat their crews.  
  
“2. That British ships of war have forcibly seized mariners  
belonging to American vessels, and in one instance under the  
protection of a Portuguese fort.  
  
“3. That by British regulations and practices, our corn and  
provisions are driven from the ports of France, and restricted  
to the ports of the British, or those of their friends.  
  
“4, That our vessels are not permitted to go from the Bri-  
tish ports in the Islands, without giving security, (which is not  
attainable but with difficulty and expense,) for the discharge  
of the cargo in some other British, or a neutral port.  
  
“5. That, without the imputation of a contraband trade, as  
defined by the law of nations, our vessels are captured for ear-  
rying on a commercial intercourse with the French West In-  
dies, although it is tolerated by the laws of the French republic;  
and that for this extraordinary conduct, no other exeuse is al-  
leged, than that by some edict of a King of France, this inter~  
course was prohibited; and,  
  
  
  
NAVAL CHRONICLE. &quot;4  
  
“6. That the conduct of the admiralty in the British islands,  
is impeachable for an excess of rigour, and a departure from  
strict judicial purity, and the expenses of an appeal to Eng-  
land too heavy to he encountered, under all the circumstances  
of discouragement.”  
  
Against the French, it is urged:—  
  
“1. That their privateers harrass our trade no less than  
those of the British.  
  
“2. That two of their ships of war, have committed enor-  
mities on our vessels.  
  
“3. That their courts of admiralty are guilty of equal op-  
pression.  
  
“4. That besides these points of accusation, which are common  
to the French and the British, the former have infringed the trea-  
ty between the United States and them, by subjecting to seizure  
and condemnation our vessels, trading with their enemies in  
merchandise, which that treaty declares not to be contraband,  
and under circumstances not forbidden by the laws of nations.  
  
“5. That a very detrimental embargo has been laid upon  
large numbers of American vessels, in the French ports; and,  
  
«6. That a contract with the French government for coin,  
has been discharged in depreciated assignats.”’  
  
Against the Spaniards, the outrages of privateers are urged;  
and,  
  
Against the Dutch, one condemnation in the admiralty is  
insisted to be unwarrantable,’”’ &amp;c.
