have added notes to the present edition: but I changed it, on reflecting that the appearance of the work would probably excite remarks and criticisms which might enable me to render them more full and satisfactory. The Honble John Jay has favoured me with his remarks upon my first volume at some length. He notices, however, but one error of fact; and that is, that general Montgomery’s widow never had any children, as stated in the History. He combats nevertheless the suggestion, which he finds often insinuated by the Author:“That anterior to the Revolution, there existed in the Colonies a desire of Independence.”“Explicit professions and assurances of Allegiance and Loyalty to the Sovereign (especially since the accession of King William) and of affection for the mother country, abound, says Mr Jay, in the Journals of the colonial Legislatures, and of the Congresses and Conventions, from early Periods to the second Petition of Congress, in 1775.If those professions and assurances were sincere, they afford Evidence more than sufficient to invalidate the charge of our desiring and aiming at Independence. If, on the other hand, those professions and assurances were factitious and deceptive, they present to the world an unprecedented Instance of long continued, concurrent, and detestable Duplicity in the colonies.—Our Country does not deserve this odious and disgusting imputation. During the course of my Life, and until after the second Petition of Congress (in 1775) I never did hear any American, of any class, or of any description, express a wish for the independence of the Colonies.—It has alway been, and still is, my opinion and Belief, that our country was prompted and impelled to Independence by Necessity, and not by Choice.

‘Explicit professions and assurances of allegiance and loyalty to

of affection of and for the Mother Country, abound in the journals  
of Colonial legislatures and of the Congresses and Conventions from  
early periods to the Second Petition of Congress in 1775. If these  
professions and assurances were sincere, they afford evidence more  
than sufficient to invalidate the charge of our desiring or aiming at
