hich the battle was maintained with a continual fire for three hours and forty minutes, when it became impossible for him to work his ships. He made an attempt to recommence the action, but found it impracticable. The Bienfaisant had lost her maintopmast, and the Buffalo her mizzen yard; and the other vessels were not less damaged in their masts, rigging and sails. The enemy did not appear in a better condition. The two squadrons remained sometime over against each other. At length the Dutch retired, taking, with their convoy, their course to the Texel. He was not in a condition to follow them.

Noble, respectable, and virtuous, our faithful and well beloved!  
We have learned with the greatest satisfaction, that the squadron of the state, under the command of rear Admiral Zoutman, although weaker by a great deal, in ships, guns and men, than the English squadron of Vice Admiral Parker: has resisted so courageously, on the fifth of this month, his attack, that the English squadron after a most obstinate combat, which lasted from 8 o’clock in the morning to half after eleven, has been obliged to desist and to retire. The heroic courage, with which vice Admiral Zoutman, the captains, officers, petty officers, and common sailors and soldiers, who have had a part in the action, and who under the blessing of God Almighty have so well discharged their duty in this naval combat, merit the praises of all, and our particular approbation. It is for this cause we have thought fit, by the present to write to you, to thank publicly in our name the said vice admiral captains, officers, petty officers and common sailors and soldiers, by reading this letter, on board of each ship, which took part in the action, and whose captains and crews have fought with so much courage and valour, and to transmit by the secretary of the fleet of the state, an authentic copy, as well to the said rear admiral Zoutman, as to the commanders of the ships under his orders, of the conduct of whom, the said rear admiral had reason to be satisfied. Testifying moreover, that we doubt not, that they and all the other officers of the state, and soldiers, on those occasions that may be presented, will give proofs that the state is not destitute of defenders of our dear country and of her liberty, and that the ancient, heroic bravery of the Batavians still exists, and will not be extinguished.  
Whereupon, noble, respectable, virtuous, our faithful and well beloved, we recommend you to the divine protection. Your affectionate friend,  
William, Prince of Orange.  
By order of his highness,  
T. J. De Larrey.

The United States of America, in congress assembled, to all to whom these presents shall come, send Greeting.  
Whereas these United States, from a sincere desire of putting an end to the hostilities between his most christian majesty and these United States on the one part, and his Britannic majesty on the other, and of terminating the same by a peace, founded on such solid and equitable principles, as reasonably to promise a permanency of the blessings of tranquility: did heretofore appoint the Hon. John Adams, late a commissioner of the United States of America at the court of Versailles, late delegate in congress, from the state of Massachusetts, and chief justice of the said state, their minister plenipotentiary, with full powers, general and special, to act in that quality, to confer, treat, agree, and conclude with the ambassadors or plenipotentiaries of his most christian majesty and of his Britannic majesty, and those of any other princes or states whom it might concern, relating to the re-establishment of peace and friendship. And whereas the flames of war have since that time been extended, and other nations and states are involved therein: now, know ye, that we still continuing earnestly desirous as far as  depends upon us, to put a stop to the effusion of blood, and to convince the powers of Europe, that we wish for nothing more ardently than to terminate the war, by a safe and honorable peace; have thought proper to renew the powers formerly given to the said John Adams, and to join four other persons in commission with him, and having full confidence in the integrity, prudence and ability of the Hon. Benjamin Franklin, our minister plenipotentiary at the court of Versailles, and the Hon. John Jay, late president of congress, and chief justice of the state of New-York, and our minister plenipotentiary at the court of Madrid, and the Hon. Henry Laurens, formerly president of congress, and commissioned and sent as our agent to the united provinces of the low countries, and the Hon. Thomas Jefferson, governor of the commonwealth of Virginia, have nominated, constituted and appointed, and by these presents do nominate, constitute and appoint the said Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Henry Laurens, and Thomas Jefferson, in addition to the said John Adams, giving and granting to them, the said John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Henry Laurens and Thomas Jefferson, or the majority of them, or such of them as may assemble, or in the case of the death, absence, indisposition or other impediment of the others, to any one of them, full power and authority, general and special, conjunctly and separately and general and special command to repair to such place as may be fixed upon for opening negotiations for peace, and there for us and in our name, to confer, treat, agree and conclude, with the ambassadors, commissioners and plenipotentiaries of the princes and states whom it may concern, vested with equal powers relating to the establishment of peace; and whatsoever shall be agreed and concluded for us, and in our name to sign, and thereupon make a treaty or treaties, and to transact every thing that may be necessary for completing, securing and strengthening the great work of pacification, in as ample form, and with the same effect as if we were personally present and acted therein; hereby promising in good faith, that we will accept, ratify, fulfil and execute whatever shall be agreed, concluded and signed by our said ministers plenipotentiary or a majority of them, or of such of them as may assemble, or, in case of the death, absence, indisposition or other impediment of the others, by any one of them, and that we will never act, nor suffer any person to act contrary to the same in whole or in part. In witness whereof we have caused these presents to be signed by our president, and sealed with his seal. Done at Philadelphia the fifteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty one, and in the fifth year of our independence, by the United States in congress assembled.
