Dear Sir  
Washington Mar. 27. 1801.  
  
I have to acknowlege the receipt of yours of Mar. 4. and to express to you the delight with which I found the just, disinterested &amp; honorable point of view in which you saw the proposition it covered. the resolution you so properly approve had long been formed in my mind. the public will never be made to believe that an appointment of a relative is made on the ground of merit alone, uninfluenced by family views. nor can they […] see with approbation offices, the disposal of which they entrust to their president for public purposes, divided out as family property. mr Adams degraded himself infinitely by his conduct on this subject, as Genl. Washington had done himself the greatest honor. with two such examples to proceed by, I should be doubly inexcusable to err. it is true that this places the relations of the President in a worse situation than if he were a stranger. but the public good which cannot be effected if it’s confidence is lost, requires this sacrifice. perhaps too it is compensated by sharing in the public esteem. I could not be satisfied till I assured you of the increased esteem with which this transaction fills me for you. accept my affectionate assurances of it.

Dear Sir : The public will never  
be made to believe that an appoint­  
ment of a relative is made on the  
ground of merit alone, uninflu­  
enced by family views ; nor can  
they ever see with approbation,  
offices, the disposal of which they  
entrust their President for public  
purposes, divided out as family  
property. Mr. Adams degraded  
himself infinitely by his conduct  
on this subject, as &quot;Washington had  
done himself the greatest honor.  
With such examples to proceed by,  
I should be doubly inexcusable to  
err. It is true that this places the  
relations of the President in a  
worse situation than if he were a  
stranger, but the public good,  
which cannot be effected if its con­  
fidence be lost, requires this sacri- i  
lice. Perhaps, too, it is compen- i  
sated for by charing in the public  
esteem. Tnos. Jefferson.

The four years oi his life as Vice Presi­

proceedings as President, being history,  
nothing need he said. One thing he  
resolved on, and that was to appoint no  
relative to otlice. To a kinsman lie wrote  
on this subject.
