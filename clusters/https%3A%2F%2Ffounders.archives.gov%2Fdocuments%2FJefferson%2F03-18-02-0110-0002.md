To the PEOPLE of VIRGINIA,  
WHO ARE BOUND TO PAY TAXES! WORK ON THE HIGHWAYS!! AND FIGHT FOR A COUNTRY THAT DENIES THEM A VOTE, THE NATURAL RIGHT OF FREEMEN!!!  
IN addressing you on a subject, of all others the most important of the earthly concerns of the human family, it may be proper to speak of myself and the motives which have induced this undertaking.  
MY love for Virginia will bear a comparrison with that of any individual in it. I have never sought an appointment for myself, or that of any member of my family, (a very extensive connection) within your limits. I have enjoyed the right of suffrage for more than twenty years, and do not believe I shall out live that privilege. The plan which I am about to propose to you, has the approbation of many years reflection; but no person has been consulted, and therefore I cannot say it meets with the sanction of a solitary being, besides the writer. Your lawful right to act in the manner proposed, has been maturely considered and approved. You are protected by the highest authority under heaven, in meeting together peaceably, and redressing your grievances in your own way. Your numbers, including the free holders in favor of universal suffrage, may be set down at about 70,000; and those opposed to you at about 20,000. Notice this difference and ask yourselves is it possible for the former number to commit a crime in regulating the affairs by which they are to be governed, when opposed to the last number only?  
I have no talent for this undertaking, and shall not attempt to rouse you by an appeal to your passions; I trust that is not necessary; a plain tale, embracing a mere glance at your situation, will answer, if your bosoms have not already lost the noble throbbings of freemen—my observations assure me they have not  
WHEN in company, where the business at Richmond, or your elections, were the topics, I have remarked that you turned your backs with indignant looks, which proved you were not insensible to your wrongs, and although a few, on such occasions, acted differently, as if they were satisfied, and would make good merry footmen for some noble peer, yet I am proud to say they are few indeed.  
A bountiful providence has favored you with a country inferior to few under heaven; and has sent among you a Washington, Henry, and Jefferson, to teach you the first principles of freedom; but you have failed in prosecuting the divine commands. You are bequeathing to your posterity a patient submission to wrongs—that dangerous legacy, which never fails to rivet the chains their fathers wore. Your lead in the first war, and manly share in the second, tells well in history; but settling down, quietly, without an effort to gain your rights at home, leaves a stain that must forever disgrace you. Virginians! if you love your country, only look back at what you were at the close of the first war; and what is your rank now among the states? Your population is departing, like Hagar and her son, with a morsel of bread, in search of homes. Your leading men are wasting their strength in a fruitless contest about state rights, while they trample on the rights of their fellow citizens, who, alone, are able to support them in that just cause. You have no more to do in the affairs of the state than slaves—land gives to the weakest heads in the country, power to govern the most virtuous, intelligent, among you Executions may issue against your bodies, and oppress you to the end of your days; but the land of a worthless wretch is protected by law. A bankrupt law, the only and last hope of the unfortunate, is denied you; and if you rise, it must be in some other country, to which your bad policy is fast driving you. New-York, not contented with leaving you behind in population and improvements, has, by a late change in her constitution, allowed her negroes to vote.  
VIRGINIANS! Can you hear this and rest satisfied one moment longer? Your oppressors consider you too ignorant to enjoy the immunities of Freemen. Hear what Mr. Jefferson says, in his letter of the 20th September last to Mr. Jarvis—his words are as follows:  
“I KNOW no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with wholesome discretion, the remedy is, not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by Education”  
HOW does the treatment you receive agree with the opinion of this great and good man? He is for cultivating your minds, and allowing you all power—your oppressors take from you all exercise of the intellect nature gave you, and thereby plunge you deeper in ignorance, while the landholder is protected by law your carcasses are given up to be tortured forever. The plan I set before you will deliver you from your bondage; but it is only intended as a form, leaving it to your deliberations to frame a better, so that the ultimate object is secured. Packets of this address will be sent to every post office in the state—your Printers may not aid the cause by a re-publication, if they do not, when you become the sovereigns of the state you can punish them by withholding public patronage.  
BE fearful of nothing but your own rashness. A mild, steady course brings you safe into the port so long shut against you—the least disorder on your part will be trumpeted forth as an evidence of your unfitness to rule.—Tell your opposers that it is not possible for you to do worse than they have done—that by a report in 1819, the item of muskets alone presented a loss of about three hundred thousand dollars. The many millions wasted besides has not yet come to light. A reform in Virginia will have a happy bearing on North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky—states that have received much population from Virginia. Ohio, Indiana and Illinois would look up to you for examples as to a mother, if your rulers, who surrendered your birthright to that large country had derived their authority from your suffrages instead of the soil under your feet. You will no doubt have the prayers and best wishes of thousands among the Freeholders of the state. I beseech you to treat them, as well as those opposed to you, as fellow citizens about to be reclaimed from the error of their ways; but by no means allow them to interfere in what you are about, until you are prepared to go into an election of officers for the whole state, and then invite them to share equally with you. This precaution is not so much necessary from the danger to be apprehended of their faithless conduct as from your jealousies—you will not have the same confidence in them while organizing your system as you have in each other, and therefore do not admit any but those who have suffered to participate in your committee appointments.  
YOU must have a Printing Press at Staunton, or at some other point to assist in the dispatch of your resolutions. Be mindful of tempering that establishment with the mildest conduct—the eyes of your sister states will be on you, and go with you in the reform—therefore for the honor of the cause and for the sake of yourselves and the state you live in do nothing spitefully.  
  
A PLAN, which will secure a VOTE to every Free White Man in the State of Virginia.  
1st. A FEW active, faithful citizens, in the boundary of every captain’s company, in each county, must visit the dwelling of such as cannot attend at appointed places, and make out a correct list of all who are not entitled to vote for the state, or general government, and at the same time take the vote of such persons for two delegates, to represent the company in a county meeting, to be held immediately at the court house of the county.  
2d. THE company delegates to appoint two county delegates, to meet in convention at Charlottsville, and also appoint a standing corresponding committee, to consist of six members and a chairman, in each county, who shall have power to watch over the tranquillity of the country, and be organs of communication with the general committee consisting of twelve members and a chairman, chosen by the company delegates of the county of Augusta, and to hold their meetings at Staunton. Charlottsville is selected on account of its central position, and the residence of Mr. Jefferson, whose opinion of your rights is already known, by his letter to Mr Jarvis, and his advice will no doubt always be at the service of his fellow-citizens. It will also afford him an opportunity of finishing the deliverance of his country from aristocracy, so hateful in his sight, as appears from his writings, and the whole tenor of his well spent life.  
3d. THE representatives of counties to meet at Charlottsville, on a day appointed by the general committee, and in a short session, of not more than one week, draft a petition to the body who have been elected by a few persons, and improperly styled the representatives of Virginia. Three commissioners, appointed by the representatives of counties, shall present said petition, praying for the call of a convention, and allowing every free white male, above the age of 21, to vote. If this just demand is refused, the general committee may order a day of election, and prescribe the rules regulating the same in the whole state, at which the people may vote for a suitable person for Governor of Virginia and two Representatives from each county.  
4th. THE Governor and members of the Legislature shall meet in the Capitol at Richmond, take an oath to execute the laws of the state until the same are amended or repealed. The governor to have power to do such acts as the governor of Virginia now does. The representatives to elect 36 of their own body to form another house, to be called the Senate. The governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Representatives, to appoint all officers necessary for the judiciary and military departments of the state; whose appointments shall continue to the end of the first session of the next legislature.  
5th. It shall be the duty of the legislature to authorize the Governor to take possession of all the public buildings and public property of every description, including the records of courts and other public documents, and to punish by imprisonment any attempt to obstruct a due execution of the said authority.  
6th. AT the first session of the legislature aforesaid, a law shall pass, calling a convention, to form a constitution: and the said legislature shall not adjourn, until the judiciary and military departments are filled with the functionaries necessary for the administration of the laws of the state.  
A NATIVE BORN VIRGINIAN.

TO THE TEOPLK OF VIliHINIA,  
tl7.o are bound to pay Taxes / work on the  
highways .&#x27; / and jight for a country that  
duties them a cote, the natural right of free­  
men .&#x27;f  
In addressing you on a subject of all  
others the most important of the carth­  
lv concerns of the human family, it  
may be proper to speak of myself and  
the motives which have induced this  
undertaking.  
My love for Virginia will bear a  
comparison with that of any individual  
in it. I have never sought an appoint­  
ment for myself, or that of any mem­  
ber of my family, (a vi rv extensive  
connection,) within your limits. I have  
enjoyed the right of suffrage for more  
than twenty years, and do not believe  
I shall out-live that privilege. The  
plan which 1 am about to propose to  
you, has the approbation of many years  
reflection; but no person has been con­  
sulted, aud therefore I cannot say it  
meets with the sanction of a solitary  
being besides the writer. Your lawful  
right to act in the manmr proposed,  
has been maturely considered and ap­  
proved.—You are protected by the  
highest authority under heaven, in  
meeting together peaceably, and re­  
dressing your grievances in your own  
way. Your numbers, including the  
freeholders in favor of universal suf­  
frage may be set down at about 70,000,  
and those opposed to you at about 20,­  
000. Notice this difference and ask  
yourselves is it possible for the former  
number to commit a crime in regula­  
ting the affairs by which they are to  
be governed, when opposed to the last  
number only ? I have no talent for this  
  
undertaking, and shall not attempt to  
rouse vou by an appeal to your pas­  
sions ;&#x27; I trust that is not necessary;  
a plain tale, embracing a mere glance  
at your situation, will answer, if your  
bosoms have not already lost th-s no­  
ble throbbings of freemen—my obser­  
vations assure me they have not.  
When in company, when the busi­  
ness at Richmond, or your elections  
were the topics, I have remarked that  
you turned your backs with indignant  
looks, which proved you were not in-,  
sensible to your wrongs; and although  
a few, on such occasions, acted differ­  
ently, as if they were satisfied, ami  
would make good merry footmen lor  
some noble peer, yet I am proud to  
sav they are few indeed.  
A bountiful Providence has favored  
you with a Country inferior to few un­  
der heavens, and has scut among you  
a Washington, Hc&#x27;irt/, and Jrff&#x27;irson, to  
teach you the lirst principles of free­  
dom; but you have failed in prosecu­  
ting the Divine commands.—You arc!  
bequeathing to your posterity a patient j  
submission to wrongs—that dangerous  
legacy, which never fails to rivet the  
chains their fathers wore. Your lead  
in the first war, and manly share in the  
second, tells well in history, but set­  
tling down quietly, without an effort to  
gain your rights at home leaves a stain  
that must forever disgrace you. Vir­  
ginians ! if you love your country, only  
look back at what you were at the close  
of the first war, and what is your rank  
among the states ? Your population is  
departing like Hagar and her Son,  
with a morsel of bread in search of  
homes. Your leading men are wast­  
ing their strength in a fruitless contest  
about State Rights, while they trample  
on the rights of their fellow citizens,  
who, alone, are able to support them  
in that just cause. You have no more  
to do in the affairs of State than slaves.  
Land gives to the weakest heads in  
the country, power to govern the most  
virtuous and intelligent among you —  
Executions may issue against your bo­  
dies and oppress you to the end of your  
days; but the land of a worthless  
wretch is protected by law. A bank­  
rupt law, the only and last hope of the  
unfortunate, is denied you, and if you  
rise, it must be in some other country,  
to which your bad policy is fast driv­  
  
ing you.  
Virginians! Can you hear this and  
rest satisfied one moment longer&#x27; Your&#x27;  
oppressors consider you too ignorant  
to enjoy the immunities of freemen.  
Hear what Mr. Jefferson says, in his  
letter of 20lh Sept. last, to Mr. Jarvis  
—his words are as follows:  
“ I know of no safe depositor)’ of the  
ultimate powers of the society hut the  
people themselves, atid if we think  
them not enlightened enough to exer­  
cise their control with wholesome dis­  
cretion, the remedy is not to take it  
from them, but to inform their discre­  
tion by education.”  
How dpes, the. lrratmi&gt;nf vw  
agree with the opinion of this great  
and good man. He is for cultivating  
your minds, and allowing you all pow­  
er. Your oppressors lake from you all  
exercise of the intellect nature gave  
you, and thereby plunge you deeper in  
ignorance. While the landholder is  
protected by law, your carcasses are  
given up to be tortured forever. The  
plan 1 set before you will deliver you  
from your bondage—but it is only in­  
tended as a form, leaving it to your de­  
liberation to frame a better, so that the  
ultimate object is secured. Packages  
of this address will be sent to every  
post office in the state.—-Your printers  
may not aid in the cause by a republi­  
cation, if they do not, when you become  
the sovereigns of the State, you can  
punish them by withholding public  
patronage.  
Be fearful of nothing only your own  
rashness. A mild and steady course  
brings you safe into the port so long  
shut against you. The least disorder  
on your part w ill be trumpeted forth as  
an evidence of your unfitness to rule.  
Tell your opposers that it is not possi­  
ble for you to do worse than they have  
done—that by a report in 1819, the i­  
tem of muskets alone presented a loss  
of about 300,000 dollars—The many  
millions wasted besides have not yet  
come to light. A reform in Virginia  
will have a happy bearing on North  
and South Carolina, Georgia, Alaba­  
ma, Tennessee, and Kentucky—States  
that have received much population  
  
from Virginia.—Ohio, Indiana, and  
Illinois, would look up to you for ex­  
amples as to a mother, if your rulers,  
who surrendered your birth right to  
that large country, had derived their  
authority from your suffrages instead of  
the soil under your feet. You will, no  
doubt, have the prayers and best wish­  
es of thousands among the freeholders  
of the state. I beseech you to treat  
them, as well as those opposed to you,  
as fellow citizens about to be reclaimed  
from the error of their ways, but by no  
means allow them to interfere in what  
you are about, until )ou arc prepared  
to go into an election of officers for  
the whole State, and then invite tkem  
to share equally with you.—This pre­  
caution is not so muc h necessary from  
the danger to be apprehended of their  
faithless conduct as from your jealous­  
ies. You w ill not have the same con­  
fidence in them while organizing your  
system as you have in each other, and  
therefore do not admit any but those  
who have suffered, to participate in  
your committtee appointments.  
You must have a printing press at  
Staunton, or at some other point, to  
assist in the despatch of your resolu­  
tions. Be mindful of tempering that  
establishment with the mildest conduct;  
the eyes of our sister States will be on  
  
you in the reform—therefore, for the  
honor of the cause, and for the sake of  
yourselves and the State you live in, do  
nothing spitefully.  
A PLAN which will insure a Vote to eve­  
ry Free White Man in the State of  
Virginia.  
1st. A few active, faithful Gitizens, in  
the boundary of every Captain’s com­  
pany, in each county, must visit the  
dwellings of such as cannot attend at  
appointed places, and make out a cor­  
rect list of all who are not entitled to  
vote for the State, or General Govern­  
ment, and at the same lime take the  
vote of .such persons for two delegates,  
to represent the company in a county  
meeting, to he held immediately at the  
Court I louse of the county.  
2 The company delegates to appoint  
two county delegates to meet in con­  
vention at Charlottesville, and also ap­  
point a standing corresponding com­  
mittee, to consist of six members and  
a chairman in each county, who shall  
have power to watch over the tiauqui­  
litv of the county, and be organs of  
communication with the general com­  
mittee, consisting of twelve members  
and a chairman, chosen by the compa­  
ny delegates of the county of Augusta,  
and to hold their meetings at Staunton.  
Charlottesville is selected on account  
of its central position and the residence  
of Mr. Jefferson, whose opinion of  
your rights are already known by his  
ietter to Mr.&#x27;Jarvis; and his advice will,  
no doubt, always be at the service of  
his fellow citizens. It will afford him  
an opportunity of finishing the deliver­  
ance of his country from aristocracy, so  
hateful iu his sight, as appears from  
his writings, and the whole tenor of  
  
his well spent lite.  
3d. The representatives of counties  
to meet at Charlottesville, on a day to  
be appointed by the general committee,  
and in a short session of not more than  
one week—draft a petition to the body  
who have been elected by a few persons,  
and improperly styled the representa­  
tives oi Virginia, I hree comtnission­  
ers appointed by the representatives of  
counties sliall present said petition,  
praying for the call of a convention,  
and allowing every free white male, a­
