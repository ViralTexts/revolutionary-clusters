						Dear Sir  
						London. Jany. 23d. 1809.  
					  
					I dined at Mr. Canning’s, with the Corps diplomatique, on the 18th. (the Day appointed for the Celebration of the Queen’s Birthday). Before Dinner he came up to me, and, entering into Conversation, adverted to a Report, which  
						he said had reached him, that the American Ministers (here &amp; in France) were about to be recalled. I replied that I was not aware that such a Step had already been resolved upon. He then took me aside, and observed, that, according to his View of the  
						late proceedings of Congress, the Resolutions of the House of Representatives in Commee. of the whole appeared to be calculated, if passed into a Law, to remove the Impediments to an arrangement with the U. S. upon the two Subjects of the Orders in Council and the Chesapeake;  
						that the President’s Proclamation had in Fact formed the great Obstacle to the Adoption of what we had lately proposed, and that every body knew that it had formed the

 by us that the View which they thus took of the Resolutions in Question was correct; and he intimated a Wish that we should say that the Intention of the American Government was in Conformity with that View. He added that it was another favourable Circumstance that the Non-Importation System was about to be applied to all the Belligerents.  
					As all this occurred rather unexpectedly (although my Reception at Court, and other Circumstances of much more Consequence, had seemed to give Notice of some Change)  
							and as I did not think it adviseable to say much, even informally, upon Topics of such Delicacy, at so short a Warning, I proposed to Mr. Canning that I should call on him in the Course of a Day or two for the purpose of a more free  
						Communication upon what he had mentioned than was then practicable. To this he readily assented, and it was settled that I should see him on the Sunday following (Yesterday) at 12 OClock at his own House. I thought it prudent, however, to suggest at once

r last Conversation, I said every Thing which I thought consistent with Discretion to confirm him in his Disposition to  
						seek the Re-establishment of good-Understanding with us, and especially to see in the expected act of Congress (if it should pass) an opening, to which the most scrupulous could not object, as well as the strongest Motives of Prudence, for such Advances, before it should be  
						late, on the Side of this Country, as could scarcely fail to produce the best Results.  
					It was of some Importance to turn their attention here, without Loss of Time, to the Manner of any proceeding which might be in Contemplation. It seemed that the Resolutions of the House of Representatives, if enacted into a Law, might render it proper, if  
						not indispensable, that the Affair of the Chesapeake should be settled at the same Time with the affair of the Orders and the Embargo, and this was stated by Mr. Canning to be his Opinion &amp; his Wish. It followed that the whole Matter ought to be settled at Washington;  
						and, as this was, moreover, desireable on various other Grounds, I suggested that it would be well (in Case a special Mission did not meet their Approbation) that the necessary Powers should be sent to Mr. Erskine; but I offered my Intervention for the Purpose of guarding  
						them against Deficiencies in those powers, and of smoothing the Way to a successful Issue. Mr. Canning gave no Opinion on this Point.  
					Although I forbear to trouble You in Detail with what I said to Mr. Canning, it is fit that you should know what was said by him on every Matter of Importance.  
					In the Course of the Conversation he proposed several Questions for Reflection, relative to our late proposal, which, when that proposal was made, were not even glanced at. The principal were the two following:  
					1. In Case they should now wish, either through me, &quot;or through Mr. Erskine&quot;, to meet us upon the Ground of our late overture, in what Way was the effectual Operation of our Embargo as to  
						France after it should be taken off as to G. B. to be secured? It was evident, he said, that, if we should do no more than refuse Clearances for the Ports of France &amp;c. or prohibit under penalties Voyages to such Ports, the Effect which my Letter of the 23d. of August and  
						my published Instructions professed to have in View would not be produced, for that Vessels, although cleared for British Ports, might, when once out, go to France instead of coming here. That this would in Fact be so (whatever the Penalties which the  
						American Laws might denounce against Offenders) could not, he imagined, be doubted; and he presumed, therefore (especially as he could see no possible Objection to it on our part) that the Govt. of the U. S. would not, after it had itself declared a  
						Commerce with France illegal, and its Citizens who should engage in it Delinquents, complain if the Naval Force of this Country should assist in preventing such a Commerce.  
					2. He asked whether there would be any Objection to making the Repeal of the B. orders &amp; of the American Embargo contemporaneous? He seemed to consider this as indispensable. Nothing could be less admissible, he said, than that G. B, after rescinding  
						her Orders, should, for any Time however short, be left subject to the Embargo in common with France whose Decrees were subsisting, with a View to an Experiment upon France, or with any other View. The U. S. could not upon their own principles apply the Embargo to this  
						Country one Moment after its Orders were removed, or decline after that Event to apply it exclusively to France &amp; the powers connected with her: G. B. would dishonor herself by any Arrangement which

“ 1 o the Hobs k of Represent at i vk s  
of the United States.  
“Agreeably to the request expressed in

fore the House extracts from the correspon­

United States at London.  
,“JAMES MADISON.  
“ December 16, 1809.”  
Erie/ account of un unofficial conversation  
between Mr. Canning and Mr. Piojiney,  
oh the 18th of January, 1809, continued  
on the 22d cf the same month. [Trans­  
mitted by Mr. Pinkney to the Secretary  
of State. ]  
I dined at Mr. Canning&#x27;s with the corfis  
difilomatiquc, on the 18th January. Before  
dinner he came up tome, and entering into  
conversation, adverted to a report which he  
said had reached him, that the American  
ministers, (here and in France,) were about  
to be recalled. I replied, that I was not a­  
warc that such a step had been resolved up­  
on. He then took me aside, and observed,  
that, according to his view of the late pro  
ceedings of Congress, the resolutions of the  
House of Kepresentatives, in committee of  
the whole, appeared to be calculated, if  
passed into a law, to remove the impeili  
ments to arrangement with the United  
States, on the subjects of the orders in  
council and the Chesapeake, by taking away  
the discrimination between Great Britain I  
  
ana rranee in the exclusion of vessels of  
war from American ports. He added, that  
it was another favorable circumstance, that  
the non importation system, which seemed  
to he in contemplation, was to be applied e  
qually to both parties, instead of affecting  
as heretofore G. Britain alone.  
I proposed to Mr, Canning, that I should  
call on him in the course of a dav or two for  
the purpose of a free communication upon  
what he had suggested. To this he readily  
assented ; and it was settled, that I should  
see him on Sunday following (the 2Cd,) at j  
11 o’clock, at his own house.  
In the interview of the S2d, Mr. Can-!

mentioned on the If h ; and I said every  
thing, which 1 thought consistent with candor,  
and discretion, to confirm him in his df»po5  
sition t&lt;» seek the re establishment of good  
understanding with us, and especially to see  
in the expected act of Congress, (if it should  
pass,) an opening for reconciliation.  
It was of some importance to turn their  
attention here, without loss of time, to .lie  
manner of any proceeding that might be in  
then contemplation. It seemed, that the  
reso.utions *f the House of Uepresentatives,  
if enacted into a law, might rein.er it pro­  
per, if not indisper.sible, th t the affair of  
the Chesapeake should be settled at the  
same time with the business of the orders  
anti emb irgo, and this I understood to be  
Me. Canning’s opinion and wish. It follow,  
ed. that the whole matter ought to be settled  
at VV ashington, and, as this was inoretwer  
desirable on various other grounds, I suggest  
etl. that it would be well (in case a special  
aiuiiou did not meet their approbation,}  
  
that the necessary, powers should he sent to,  
Mr. Erskine.  
In the course of the conversation, Mr. 1  
Canning proposed several questions relative  
toour late proposal : the principal were the &#x27;  
two following.  
1. In case they should wish, either thro’!  
me or thro* Mr. Erskine, to meet us upon I  
the basis of our late overture, in what way  
was the effectual operation of our embargo  
as to France, &amp;c. after it should he taken  
off as to Gi cttt Britain, to he secured? It  
was evident, he said, that if we should do  
no more than refuse clearances fur the i  
ports of France, See. or prohibit under pc.1  
unities voyages to such ports, the effect  
which my letter of the 23d of August, and  
my published instructions, proposed to have  
in view, would not be produced for thnt  
vessels, although cleared for British ports,  
might, when once out, go it. France instead  
of coming here ; that this would in fact, be  
k°, (whatever the pe nalties which the X­  
inerican laws might denounce against often­  
derj.) could not, he imagined, be doubted ;  
and he therefore presumed, that the govern­  
merit of the United States would not, after  
it had itself declared a commerce with  
France, &amp;c. illegal, and its citizens, who  
should engage in it, delinquents, and afte

objection to making the repeal of the Bri­  
tish orders and the American embargo con­  
temporaneous? He seemed to consider this  
asinctispeiisib&#x27;.a. Nothing could be less ad­  
missibl&#x27;e, he said, than that C.ieat Britain,  
alter rescinding her orders, should for any  
time, however short, be left subject to the  
embargo in common with France, whose de­  
crees were subsisting, with a view to an

in the exclusion of vessels of war from

another favorable circumstance that the

1. In cage they should wish enter

ture, in what way wus the effectual ope-  
ration of our embargo us to lrauce,. &amp;c.  
alter it should be tuken off us to Great-  
Britain, to be secured? kk was eviient, he  
suid, that if we should do no more than ree  
fuse clearances for the ports of France, &amp;c,  
or prohibit under penalties voyages to such  
ports, the effect which my lever of the  
23d of August, and my published instruc-

cleared for Uritish ports, might when ove  
out go to France instead of coming here;  
that this would in fact be so, (whatever  
the penalties which the American jaws  
might denounce against offvaders) could

2. He asked whether there would be  
any opyection (OMAN tre repeat of ttre  
  
British orders and the American embarzo  
contemporaneous ? He seemed to consid-  
er this as indispensible. Nothing could  
be less admissible, he said, than that Great-  
Britain, after rescinding her orders, should  
for any time, however short, be left sub-  
ject to the embargo in common with  
France, whose Cecrees were subsisting,  
with a view to an experiment upon France,  
  
or with any other view. The United  
  
States. could not upon their own principles  
apply the embargo to this country one  
  
moment after its orders were temoved, or  
  
decline after that event to apply it exclu-  
  
sively to France, and the powers connect-  
  
ed with her in system.  
  
I took occasion towards the close of our  
conversation to mention the receut up-  
pointment of admiral Berkley to the Lis-  
bon station. Mr. Canning said, that what-  
  
| ever might be their inclination to consult  
  
the feelings of the American government  
on that subgect, it was impossible for the  
admiralty to resist the claim of that officer  
to be employed (no other objection cxist-  
ing against him) after such alupse of time  
since his return from Halifaa, withour  
bringing him to acourt-martial. The u-  
sage of the navy was in this respect differ-  
ent from that of the army. But I under-  
stood Mr. Cagning to say that he might  
still be ‘cought toa court .martial ; al-  
though I did not understand . him to say  
that this would be the case. He said that  
admiral Berkley, in what he had done,  
I did  
not propose te enter inte any discussion  
upon the subject, and therefore contented  
myself with speaking of the appointment  
as onfortunate.  
  
In both of these conversations, Mr. Can-  
ning’s language and manner were m the  
highest degree conciliatory.

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
with the United States, on the  
  
subjects of the orders in council  
  
and the Chesapeake, by taking  
  
away the discrimination between  
  
Great Britain and France in the  
  
exclusion of vessels of war from  
  
American ports. He added that  
  
it was another favorable circum-  
  
stance that the non-importation  
  
system, which seemed to be in  
contemplation, was to be applied  
  
equally to both parties, instead of  
affecting as heretofore Great Bri-  
  
tain alone.  
  
I proposed to Mr. Canning,  
  
that I should call on him in the  
course of a day or two for the  
purpose of a free communication  
upon what he had suggested. To  
this he readily assented ; and it  
was settled that I should see him  
on the Sunday following (the 22d)  
at 12 o’clock, at his own house.

mentioned on the 18th; and I  
said every thing which I thought  
consistent with candor and dis-  
cretion to confirm him in his dis-  
position to seek the re-establish-  
mem of good understanding with  
us, and especially to see in the  
expected act of Congress, (if it  
should pass) an opening for re-  
conciliation.  
  
It was of some importance to  
turn their attention here, without  
loss of time, to the manner of any  
proceeding that might be in their  
contemplation. It seemed that  
  
the resolutions of the House of  
Representatives, if enacted into a  
law, might render it proper, if  
not indispensible, that the aflair  
of the Chesapeake should be set-  
tled at the same time with the  
business of the orders and embar-  
  
207  
  
go, and this I understood to be  
Mr. Canning’s opinion and wish.  
It followed that the whole matter  
ought to be settled at Washing-  
ton, and, as this was moreover de-  
sirable on various other grounds,  
I suggested that it would be well,  
(in case a special mission did  
not meet their approbation) that  
the necessary powers should be  
sent to Mr. Erskine.  
  
In the course of the conversa-  
tion, Mr. Canning proposed seve-  
ral questions relative to our late  
proposal: the principal were the  
two following :  
  
- 1. In case they should wish ei-  
ther through me or through Mr.  
Erskine, to meet us upon the ba-  
sis of our late overture, in what  
way was the effectual operation  
of our embargo as to France, &amp;c.  
after it should be taken off as to  
Great Britain, to be secured? It  
was evident, he said, that if we  
should do no more than refuse  
clearances for the ports of France,  
&amp;ec. or prohibit under penalties  
voyages to such ports, the effect  
which my letter of the 23d of Au-  
gust, and my published instruc-  
tions, proposed to have in view,  
would not be produced; for that  
vessels although cleared for Bri-  
tish ports, might when once out  
go to France instead of coming  
here ; that this would in fact be  
so, (whatever the penalties which  
the American laws might de-  
nounce against offenders) could  
not, he imagined he doubted ; and  
he therefore presumed that the  
government of the United States  
would not, after it had itself declar-  
edacommerce with France, &amp;e.il-  
legal, and its citizens, who should  
engee in it, delinquents, and af

tion, complain if the naval force  
of this country should assist in  
preventing such a commerce.  
  
2. He asked whether there  
would be any objection to making  
the repeal of the British orders  
and the American embargo co-  
temporaneous? He seemed to  
consider this as indispensible.  
Nothing could be less admissible,  
he said, than that Great Britain  
after rescinding herorders, should  
for any time, however short, be  
left subject to the embargo in  
common with Framce; whose de-  
  
crees were subsisting, with a view  
  
to an experiment upon France, or  
with any other view. The Uni-  
ted States could not upon their  
own principles apply the embar-  
go to this country one mement  
after its orders were removed, or  
decline after that event to apply  
it exclusively to France, and the  
powers connected with her in  
system.  
  
I took occasion towards the  
close of our conversation to men-  
tion the recent appointment of  
admiral Berkeley to the Lisbon  
station. Mr. Canning said, that  
whatever might be their inclina-  
  
tion to consult the feelings of the  
  
American government on that  
subject, it was impossible for the  
admiralty to resist the claim of  
that officer to be employed (no  
other objection existing against  
him) after such a lapse of time  
since his return from Halifax,  
withqut bringing him to a court-  
martial. ‘The usage of the navy  
was in this respect different from  
that of the army. But [ under-  
stood Mr. Canning to say that he  
might still be brought to a court-  
martial; although I did not un-  
derstand him to say that this  
would be the case. He said tha

I dined at Mr. Canning’s with the corps  
diplomatique on the 1¥th January. Before  
dinner he came up to me, and entering  
into conversation, adverted to a report  
which he said had reached him, that the  
American Ministers (here and it? France)  
were about to be recalled. IL replied, that  
I was not aware that such a step had been  
resolved upon. He then took me aside,  
and observed, that according to his view  
of the late proceedings of Congress, the  
  
| Resolutions of the House of Representa-  
  
tives, in committee of the whole, appeared  
to be calculated, if passed into a law, to  
remove the impediments to arrangement  
with the United States, on the subjects of  
the Orders in Council and the Chesapeake,  
by taking away the discrimination be-  
tween Great Britain and France in the  
exclusion of vessels of war from the Ame-  
rican ports. He added, that it was ano-  
ther favourable circumstance that the non-  
importation system which seemed to be  
in contemplation, was to be applied equally  
to both parties, instead of affecting, as

heretofore, Great Britain alone.—I pro-  
posed to Mr. Canning, that I should call  
on him in the course of a day or two, for  
the purpose of a free communication, upon  
what he had suggested. To this he readily  
assented; and it was settled that I should  
see him onthe Sunday following (the 22d)

onthe tsth; and I said every thing which  
I thought consistent with candour and dis-  
cretion, to.contiem him in his disposition  
to seek the re-establishment of good un-  
dersianding with us, and especially to see  
in the expected Act of Congress, if it  
should pass, an opening for reconciliation.  
-——It was of some ijnportance to tura their  
attention here, without loss of time, to the  
manner of any proceeding that might be  
in their centemplation. It seerned that  
the Resolutions of the House of Repre-  
sentatives, Mf enacted into a law, might  
render it proper, if not indispensable, that  
the affair of the Chesapeake should be  
settled at the same time with the business  
of the Orders and Embargo, and this I  
understood to be Mr. Canning’s opinion  
and wish. It followed that the whole mat-  
ter ought to be settled at Washington, and,  
as this was moreover desicoble on various  
other grounds, | suggested that it would  
be well, in case a special mission did not  
meet their approbation, that the necessary  
rowers should be sent to Mr. Erskine.  
Tn the course of the conversation, Mr.  
Canning proposed several questions rela-  
tive to our late proposal; the principal  
were the two following :  
  
1. In case they should wish either  
through me or threagh Mr. Erskine, to  
meet us upon the basis of our late over-  
ture, in what way was’ the effectual ope.  
ration of our embargo as to France, &amp;c.  
after it should be taken off as to Great  
Britain, to be ‘secured. - It was evident,  
he said, that we should do no more than  
refuse clearances for the ports of France,  
Sse. or prohibit under penalties, vovages  
to sach ports, the etfeet which my letter  
ofthe 23rd of August, and my published  
instructiogs, proposed to have in view,  
would nat be produced 3; for that vessels,  
although cleared for British ports, might,  
when once out, go to France instead of  
comuing bere; that this would im fact be

2d, He asked whether there wou!d bye ay  
objection to making the repeal of the Jj.  
tish Orders and the American Embars  
cotemporaneous? He seemed to consid  
this as indispensible. Nothing could \y  
less admissible, he said, than that Grey  
Britain, after rescinding her Orders, shou!  
for any time, however short, be Ici st.  
ject to the Embargo in common wil  
France, whose Decrees were subsisting,  
with a view to an experiment upon Fraaee,  
or with any other view. The Uniei  
States could not, upon their own print  
ples, apply the Embargo to this county  
one moment after its Orders were revobed,  
or.decline after the event to apply ite  
clusively to France, and the Powers car  
nected with her system.  
  
I took occasion, towards the close of ot  
conversation, to mention the recent a  
pointment of Admiral Berkeley to the Li  
bon station. Mr. Canning said that wha  
ever night be their inclination to const!  
the teelings of the American Governmet  
on that sabject, it was impossible fort  
Admiralty to resist the! claim of that  
ficer to be employed (go other object&quot;  
existing against lim), efter such a ls&quot;  
of time since his return from Halilis  
without bringing ‘him to a Court Mar

understood Mr. Canning to say that le  
might still be brought to a Court Maitits  
although I did not understand hin ‘  
that this would be the case. He said tl  
Admiral Berkeley, in what he had di  
had acted wholly without authority.

upon the subject, and therefore coute®
