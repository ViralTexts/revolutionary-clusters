Sir  
Mount Vernon 20th Jany 1799  
  
I have been honoured with a letter from you, dated at Berlin the 29th of Octr last; covering one from a namesake of mine, &amp; who, very probably, may be a distant relation; as our families were from the same Country. Mine earlier than his; two brothers migrating during the Commonwealth of England. or rather, during the troubles of Charles the First. Not knowing through what other medium to address him, I take the liberty of sending my answer to his request under cover to you.  
You know, my good Sir, that it is not the policy of this Country to employ aliens—where it can well be avoided—either in the Civil or Military walks of life: but, for want of provident care &amp; foresight, they will find themselves (indeed begin now to feel it) under the necessity of resorting to foreign aid for skilful men in the Engineering &amp; artillery Corps. and if my namesake is well instructed in either of these branches of Military science—which bye the by is hardly to be expected from his age—there would be no doubt of his favourable reception—without which I think it would be deceptious to encourage hopes of employment in the Army of the United States: for there is a species of self importance in all foreign Officers, that cannot be gratified without doing injustice to meritorious characters of our own Countrymen—who conceive, &amp; justly, where there is no great preponderency of experience, or merit, that they are entitled to the occupancy of all Offices in the gift their Government.  
When I offered my Valedictory Address to the People of the  
  
United States, I little thought that any event would arise in my day, that could withdraw me from the Retreat in wch I expected to pass the remnant of a life (worn down with cares) in ruminating on past scenes, &amp; contemplating the future granduer of this rising Empire—But we know little of ourselves, &amp; much less

You knov, my good sir, that it is not the policy

of life; but for want of provident care and fore­

structed in either of these branches of military  
science, which; by the by, is hardly to be expect  
ed from his age, there would he no doubt of his fa  
vorablefreception, without which I think it would  
be deceptious to encourage hopes of employment  
in the army of the United States; for there is a

MouNt VERNON, Jan. 20, 1799.  
Sir; I have been honored with a letter  
from you, dated at Berlin on the 29th of  
Oct, last, covering one from a namesake  
of mine, and who may very probably be a  
distant relation, as our families were from  
the same country--mine earlier than his  
two brothers migrating during the Com  
monwealth of England, or rather during  
the troubles of Charles I. Not knowing  
through what other medium to address  
him, I take the liberty of sending my an­  
swer to his request under cover to you.  
You know, my good sir, that it is not  
the policy of this country, to employ al­  
iens, where it can be well avoided, either in  
the military or civil walks of life; but for  
want of provident care and foresight, they  
will find themselves (indeed they how be  
gin to feel it) under the necessity of resort­  
ing to foreign aid for skillful men in the en  
gineering and artillery corps. If my name  
sake is well instructed in cither of these  
branches of military science, which, by  
the by, is hardly to be expected front his  
age, there would be no dougt of his lavor  
able reception, without which I think it  
would be deceptious to encourage hopes of  
employment in the army of the United  
States; for their is a species of self impor­  
tance in all foreign officers that cannot be  
gratifled without doing injustice to merito  
rious characters among our own country  
men, who can conceive, and justly, where  
there is no preponderance of experience or  
merit, that they are entitled to the occu­  
pancy of all offices in the gilt of the gov  
ernment--Yol. I1, pp.39 12
