repairing the ravages of an eight years absence except short occasional visits which allowed no time for that investigation which since my reestablishment here I have found my Buildings, Gardens, and every thing appertaining to them, so much required—Engaging Workmen of different sorts, providing for &amp; looking after them, together with the necessary attention to my farms, have occupied all my time since I have been at home.

I was far from entertaining sanguine hopes of success in my attempt to procure tenants from Great Britain, but being desirous of rendering the evening of my life as tranquil and free from care as the nature of things would admit I was willing to make the Experiment.

 may be classed and will account in part for their migration to the Westward. Conviction of these things having left little hope of obtaining such Tenants as would answer my purposes, I have had it in contemplation ever since I returned home to turn my farms to Grazing principally, as fast as I can cover the fields sufficiently with Grass—Labour &amp; of course expence will be considerably diminished by this change, the nett profit as great and my attention less divided, whilst the fields will be improving.  
Your Strictures on the Agriculture of this Country are but too  
  
just—it is indeed wretched—but a leading if not the primary cause of its being so is that instead of improving a little ground well we attempt much and do it ill; a half a third or even a fourth of what we mangle well wrought and properly dressed wou’d produce more than the whole under our system (if it deserves that epithet) of management yet  such is the force of habit that we cannot depart from it. The consequence of which is that we ruin the lands that are already cleared and either cut down more wood if we have it, or emigrate into the Western Country. I have endeavoured both in a public and private character to encourage the establishment of Boards of agriculture in this Country but hitherto in Vain; and what is still more extraordinary and scarsely to be believed I have endeavoured ineffectually to discard the pernicious practice just mentioned from my own Estate; but in my absence, pretexts of one kind or another have always been paramount to orders. Since the first Establishment of the National Board of Agriculture in Great Britain, I have considered it as one of the most valuable Institutions of Modern times; and conducted with so much ability and zeal as it appears to be under the auspices of Sir John Sinclair, must be productive of great advantages to the Nation and to mankind in General.

s a well known fact that no country produces better Oats than those that grow on the Allegany mountains immediately Westward of us—I have heard it affirmed that they weigh upwards of 50 lbs. the Winchester bushel. this may be occasioned by the fertility of the soil, and the attraction of moisture by the mountains—but another reason and a powerful one too, may be assigned for the inferiority of ours, namely that we are not choice in our seeds &amp; do not change them as we ought.  
The seeds you were so obliging as to give me, shared the same fate that Colo. Wadsworths did; and as I believe seeds from England generally will do, if they are put into the hole of the Vessel⟨.⟩ for this reason, I always made it a point, whilst I was in the habit of importing seeds to request my merchants and the masters of Vessels by which they were sent, to keep them from the heat thereof.  
You make a distinction and no doubt a just one between what in England is call’d Barley, and Big or Beer, if there be none of the true Barley in this Country—it is not for us without Experience  
  
to pronounce upon the Growth of it; and therefore, as noticed in a former part of this letter it might be interesting to ascertain whether our climate &amp; soil would produce it to advantage. No doubt as your observations while you were in the United States appear to have been extensive &amp; accurate it did not escape You, that both Winter and Spring Barley are cultivated among us; the latter is considered as an uncertain Crop—So. of New York and I have found it so on my farms—of the latter I have not made sufficient Trial to hazard an opinion of Success. About Philadelphia it succeeds well.

t required time and particular attention to effect it. I shall now (although it is too late in the day for me to see the result) begin in good earnest to Ditch and hedge; the latter I am attempting with various things but believe none will be found better than cedar; althoug[h] I have several kinds of white thorn growing spontaniously on my own Grounds. Rollers I have been in the constant use of many years in the way you mention, and find considerable benefit in passing them over my winter grain in the spring as soon as the ground will admit a hoof on it. I use them also on spring grain and grass seeds, after sowing and sometimes before, to reduce the clods when the ground is rough. My clover generally is sown with spring Grain; but where the ground is not too stiff &amp; binding it succeeds very well on wheat, sown on a light snow in February, or beginning of March, it sinks with the Snow and takes good root; and orchard Grass of all others is, in my opinion the best mixture  
  
with clover: it blooms precisely at the same time[—] rises quick again after cutting—stands thick—yields well—and both horses and cattle are fond of it—green or in hay. alone, unless it is sown very thick it is apt to form tussocks; if of this or any other seeds I can procure, you shou’d be in want, I shall hav
