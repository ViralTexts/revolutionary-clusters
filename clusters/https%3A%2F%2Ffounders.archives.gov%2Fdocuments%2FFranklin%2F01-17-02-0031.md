ding that it is intended to give the Publick, some Account of our dear departed Friend Mr. Peter Collinson, I cannot omit expressing my Approbation of the Design, as the Characters of good Men are exemplary, and often stimulate the well-disposed to an Imitation beneficial to Mankind, and honourable to themselves. And as you may be unacquainted with the following Instances of his Zeal and Usefulness in promoting Knowledge, which fell within my Observation, I take the Liberty of informing you, That in the year 1730, a subscription Library being set on foot in Philadelphia, he encouraged the same, by making several very valuable Presents to it, and procuring others from his Friends; And as the Library Company had a considerable Sum arising annualy to be laid out in Books, and needed a judicious Friend in London to transact the Business for them, he voluntarily and chearfully undertook that Service, and executed it for more than 30 years successively, assisting in the Choice of the Books, and taking the whole Care of Collecting and Shipping them, without ever charging or accepting any Consideration for his Trouble. The Success of this Library (greatly owing to his kind Countenance and good Advice) encouraged the erecting others in different Places, on the same Plan; and it is supposed there are now upwards of 30 subsisting in the several Colonies, which have contributed greatly to the Spreding of useful Knowledge in that part of the World, the Books he recommended being all of that kind, and the Catalogue of this first Library being much respected and followed by those Libraries that succeeded. During the same time he transmitted to the Directors the earliest Accounts of every new European Improvement in Agriculture and the Arts, and every philosophical Discovery: Among which, in 1745, he sent over an Account of the new German Experiments in Electricity, together with a Glass Tube, and some Directions for using it, so as to repeat those Experiments. This was the first Notice I had of this curious Subject, which I afterwards prosecuted with some Diligence, being encouraged by the friendly Reception he gave to the Letters I wrote to him upon it.  
Please to accept this small Testimony of mine to his Memory for which I shall ever have the utmost Respect, and believe me, with sincere Esteem, &amp;c Dear Sir Your most obedient humble Servant  
B Franklin

ing over a letter with a glass tube to Philadelphia.  
  
‘Understanding that an account of our dear departed friend Mr.  
Peter Collinson is, intended to be given to the public, I cannot omit  
expressing my approbation of the design. The characters of good  
men ‘are exemplary, and often stimulate the well-disposed to an imi-  
tation, beneficial to mankind, and honourable to themselves. And  
as you may be unacquainted with the following instances of his zeal  
and usefulness in promoting knowledge, which fell within my obser-  
vation, I take the liberty of informing you, that in 1730, a sub-  
scription library being set on foot at Philadelphia, he encouraged  
the design, by making several very valuable presents to it, and pro-  
curing others from his friends: and as the library company had a  
considerable sum arising annually, to be laid out in books, and need-  
ed a judicious friend in London to transact the business for them,  
he voluntarily and cheerfully undertook that service, and executed  
it for mofe than thirty years successively, assisting in the choice of  
books, and taking the whole care of collecting and shipping them,  
without. ever charging or accepting any consideration for his trouble.  
The success of this library (greatly owing to his kind countenance  
and good advice), encouraged the erecting others in different places  
on the same plan; and it is supposed there are now upwards of thirty  
subsisting in the séveral colonies, which have contributed greatly to  
the spreading of useful knowledge in that part of the world ; the books  
he recommended being all of that kind, and the catalogue of this first  
library being much respected and followed by those libraries that suc-  
ceeded.  
  
‘ During the same time, he transmitted to the director’ of the  
library, the earliest accounts of every new European improvement  
in agriculture and the arts, and every philosophical discovery ; among  
which, in 1745, he sent over an account of the ne ‘terman expe-  
riments in electricity, together with a glass tube, and me directions  
for using it, so as to repeat those experiments. This was the first  
notice I had of that curious subject, which I afterwards prosecuted with  
some diligence, being encouraged by the friendly reception he gave to  
the letters [ wrote to him upon it. Please to accept this small testi-  
mony of mine to his memory, for which I shall ever have the utmost  
respect.’ I, 10, 1)
