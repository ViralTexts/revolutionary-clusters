Property.  
This term in its particular application means “that dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in exclusion of every other individual.”  
In its larger and juster meaning, it embraces every thing to which a man may attach a value and have a right; and which leaves to every one else the like advantage.  
In the former sense, a man’s land, or merchandize, or money is called his property.  
In the latter sense, a man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them.  
He has a property of peculiar value in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them.  
He has a property very dear to him in the safety and liberty of his person.  
He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them.  
In a word, as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.  
Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties, or his possessions.  
Where there is an excess of liberty, the effect is the same, tho’ from an opposite cause.  
Government is instituted to protect property of every sort; as well that which lies in the various rights of individuals, as that which the term particularly expresses. This being the end of government, that alone is a just government, which impartially secures to every man, whatever is his own.  
According to this standard of merit, the praise of affording a just security to property, should be sparingly bestowed on a government which, however scrupulously guarding the possessions of individuals, does not protect them in the enjoyment and communication of their opinions, in which they have an equal, and in the estimation of some, a more valuable property.  
More sparingly should this praise be allowed to a government, where a man’s religious rights are violated by penalties, or fettered by tests, or taxed by a hierarchy. Conscience is the most sacred of all property; other property depending in part on positive law, the exercise of that, being a natural and unalienable right. To guard a man’s house as his castle, to pay public and enforce private debts with the most exact faith, can give no title to invade a man’s conscience which is more sacred than his castle, or to withhold from it that debt of protection, for which the public faith is pledged, by the very nature and original conditions of the social pact.  
That is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest. A magistrate issuing his warrants to a press gang, would be in his proper functions in Turkey or Indostan, under appellations proverbial of the most compleat despotism.  
That is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where arbitrary restrictions, exemptions, and monopolies deny to part of its citizens that free use of their faculties, and free choice of their occupations, which not only constitute their property in the general sense of the word; but are the means of acquiring property strictly so called. What must be the spirit of legislation where a manufacturer of linen cloth is forbidden to bury his own child in a linen shroud, in order to favour his neighbour who manufactures woolen cloth; where the manufacturer and wearer of woolen cloth are again forbidden the œconomical use of buttons of that material, in favor of the manufacturer of buttons of other materials!  
A just security to property is not afforded by that government, under which unequal taxes oppress one species of property and reward another species: where arbitrary taxes invade the domestic sanctuaries of the rich, and excessive taxes grind the faces of the poor; where the keenness and competitions of want are deemed an insufficient spur to labor, and taxes are again applied, by an unfeeling policy, as another spur; in violation of that sacred property, which Heaven, in decreeing man to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, kindly reserved to him, in the small repose that could be spared from the supply of his necessities.  
If there be a government then which prides itself in maintaining the inviolability of property; which provides that none shall be taken directly even for public use without indemnification to the owner, and yet directly violates the property which individuals have in their opinions, their religion, their persons, and their faculties; nay more, which indirectly violates their property, in their actual possessions, in the labor that acquires their daily subsistence, and in the hallowed remnant of time which ought to relieve their fatigues and soothe their cares, the influence will have been anticipated, that such a government is not a pattern for the United States.  
If the United States mean to obtain or deserve the full praise due to wise and just governments, they will equally respect the rights of property, and the property in rights: they will rival the government that most sacredly guards the former; and by repelling its example in violating the latter, will make themselves a pattern to that and all other governments.

PROPERTY.  
r I &quot;&quot;HIS term in its particular application  
X means that dominion which one  
man claims and exercises over the external

braces every,to which a man may at-  
value-, and have a right; and which  
leave&#x27;s to every one elj&#x27;e the-like advantage.  
In the former sense, a man&#x27;s land, or  
merchandize, or money is called his pro­  
perty.  
Ia the latter-sense, a man has a property  
in his opinions and the free communication  
of the 111.  
He has a property of peculiar value in  
his religious opinion s and 111 the profefiion  
and practice di£lated by them.  
He has a property very dear to him in  
the fjfety and liberty of his person.  
He has an equal property in the free life  
of his facultie and free choice of the ob­  
jefls on which to employ them.  
In a word, as a man is said to have a right  
to his property, he may be equally said to  
have a property in his lights.  
Where an excess of power prevails, pro­  
perty of no fort is duly refpefted. No man  
is fafe in his opinions, his person, his facul­  
ties, t&gt;r his poflelfions.  
Where there is an excess of liberty, the  
effect is the fame, tho&#x27; from an opposite  
canfe.  
Government is instituted to protest pro­  
perty of every fort; as well that which lies  
in the various rights of individuals, as that  
which the term particularly exprelles.  
This being the end of government, that a­  
lone. is a jvjl government, which impartially  
secures to every man, whatever is his ozun.  
According to this standard of merit, the  
praise of affording a just iecurity to pro­  
perty, Ihould be sparingly bestowed on a  
government which, how ever scrupulously  
guarding the polfeffions of individuals, does  
not protest them in the enjoyment and  
communication of their opinions, in which  
they have an equal, and in .the estimation  
ofi&#x27;ome, a more valuable property.  
More sparingly fbotiid this praise be al­  
lowed to a government, where a man&#x27;s re­  
ligious l ight.: are violated by penalties, or  
fettered by tests, or taxed by a hierarchy.  
Conscience is the mod sacred of all proper­  
ty ; other property depend ng in part on  
politive law, the exercise of that, being a  
natural and unalienable right. To guard  
a man&#x27;s house as his castle, to pay public  
and enforce private debts with the moll  
exact faith, can give 110 title to invade a  
man&#x27;s conscience which is more sacred ihan  
his castle. or to with&#x27;.old from it that debt  
of protection, for which the public faith it  
pledged, by the very nature and original  
conditions of thefocial part.  
That is not a just government, nor is

pos Property. [June,  
  
According to thig ftandard of merit, the praife of affording a juft fecurity to  
property, fhould be {paringly beftowed on a government, which, however fcru.  
puloufly guarding the poffeffions of individuals, does not protect them in the  
enjoyment and communication of their opinions, in which they have an equal,  
and in the eflimation of fome, a more valuable property.  
  
More f{paringly thould this praife be allowed to a government, where a man’s  
religious rights are violated by penalties, or fettered by tefts, or taxed by a  
hierarchy. Confcience is the moft facred of all property; other property de-  
pending in part on pofitive law, the exercife of that, being a natural and una.  
Jienable right. To guard a man’s houfe as his caftle, to pay public and en-  
force private debts with the moft exaé faith, can give no title to invade a man&#x27;s  
confcience, which is more facred than his caftle, or to withhold from it that  
debt of prote&amp;tion, for which the public faith is pledged, by the yery nature  
and original conditions of the focial compaét. z  
  
That is not a juft government, nor is property fecure under it, where the  
property which a man has in his perfonal fafety and perfonal liberty, is violated  
by arbitrary feizures of one clafs of citizens ‘or the fervice of the reft. A ma-  
giftrate iffuing his warrants to a prefs gang, would be in his proper funétions  
in Turkey or Indoftan, under appeliations proverbial of the moft complete  
defpotiim.  
  
That is not a juft government, nor is property fecure under it, where arbi-  
trary reftrigtions, exemptions, and monopolies deny to part of its citizeas that  
free ufe of their faculties, and free choice of their occupations, which not only  
conftitute their property, in the general fenfe of the word ; but are the means of  
_ acquiring property, ftriétly fo called. What mutt be the fpirit of leg flition,  
where a manufacturer of linen cloth is forbidden to bury his own child in a  
linen fhroud, in order to favour his neighbour who manufactures woolen cloth;  
where the manufa&amp;turer and wearer of woolen clothy are again forbidden the  
economical ufe of buttons of that material, in favour of the manufagturer ef  
buttons of other materials !  
  
A juft fecurity to property is not afforded by that government, under which  
unequal taxes opprefs one {pecies of property and reward another fpecies;  
where arbitrary taxes invade the domeftic fan&amp;uaries of the rich, and exceffive  
taxes grind the faces of the poor; where the keennefs and competitions of want  
are deemed an infufficient fpur to labour, and tyxes are again applied by an  
unfeeling policy, as another {pur ; in violation of that facred property which  
heaven, in decreeing man to earn his bread by the {weat of his brow, kindly  
referved to him, in the {mall repofe that could be {paved from the fupply of his  
neceffities.  
  
If there be a government, then, which prides itfelf in maintaining the invio-  
lability of property—which provites that none fliail be taken dire@ly, even tor  
public ufe, without indemnification to the owner, and yet direély violates the  
property, which individuals have in their opinions, their religion, their perfons,  
and their faculties—nay more, which indvedily violates their property in their  
aGtual poff flions, in the labour that acquires th-ir daily fubfiftence, and in the  
hallowed remnant of time, which ought to relieve their farigues and foothe their  
cares, the inference will have been anticipated, that tuch a government is nota  
pattern for the united flates.  
  
If the united fistes mean to obtein or deferve the full praife due to wife and  
jul governments, they wiil equally refpe&amp;t the rights of property, and the pro-  
perty in sights: they will rival the government that moft facredly guards the  
former ; and by repeiling its example in violating the latter, will make them-
