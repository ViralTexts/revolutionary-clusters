the Almighty is pledged to reward the kindness  
which cheerfully obeys the precept. “ Blessed is  
he that considereth the poor, the Lord will de  
liver him in time of trouble. The Lord will pre­  
serve him and keep him alive, and he shall be  
blessed upon the earth, and thou wilt not deliver  
him unto the will of his enemies. The Lord will  
strengthen him upon the bed of languishing, thou  
wilt make all his bed in his sickness.” Again,  
“ If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and  
satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise in  
obscurity, and thy darkness be as noon day. And  
the Lord shall guide them continually, and satisfy  
thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones, and  
thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a  
spring whose waters fail not.” But, “ whoso  
sloppeth his ears to the cry of the poor, he also  
shall cry himself and not-bVheard.” 1 wish those  
truths were engraven upon the hearts of your  
readers. To relieve the poor is a pleasant duty.  
Mercy to them is twice blest. &quot; It blesses him  
who gives and him who receives.
