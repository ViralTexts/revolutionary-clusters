[New York, November 27, 1787]  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
THE effects of union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have been sufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present enquiry.  
The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged, by all enlightened statesmen, to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth; and has accordingly become a primary object of their political cares. By multiplying the means of gratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise, it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness. The assiduous merchant, the laborious husbandman, the active mechanic, and the industrious manufacturer, all orders of men look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils. The often-agitated question, between agriculture and commerce, has from indubitable experience received a decision, which has silenced the rivalships, that once subsisted between them, and has proved to the satisfaction of their friends, that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven. It has been found, in various countries, that in proportion as commerce has flourished, land has risen in value. And how could it have happened otherwise? Could that which procures a free vent for the products of the earth—which furnishes new incitements to the cultivators of land—which is the most powerful instrument in encreasing the quantity of money in a state—could that, in fine, which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry in every shape, fail to augment the value of that article, which is the prolific parent of far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are exerted? It is astonishing, that so simple a truth should ever have had an adversary; and it is one among a multitude of proofs, how apt a spirit of ill-informed jealousy, or of too great abstraction and refinement is to lead men astray from the plainest paths of reason and conviction.  
The ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation, and to the celerity with which it circulates. Commerce, contributing to both these objects, must of necessity render the payment of taxes easier, and facilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury. The hereditary dominions of the Emperor of Germany, contain a great extent of fertile, cultivated

itory are to be found the best gold and silver mines in Europe. And yet, from the want of the fostering influence of commerce, that monarch can boast but slender revenues. He has several times been compelled to owe obligations to the pecuniary succours of other nations, for the preservation of his essential interests; and is unable, upon the strength of his own resources, to sustain a long or continued war.  
But it is not in this aspect of the subject alone, that union will be seen to conduce to the purposes of revenue. There are other points of view, in which its influence will appear more immediate and decisive. It is evident from the state of the country, from the habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point itself, that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation. Tax laws have in vain been multiplied—new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried—the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed, and the treasuries of the States have remained empty. The popular system of administration, inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding with the real scarcity of money, incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections, and has at length taught the different Legislatures the folly of attempting them.  
No person, acquainted with what happens in other countries, will be surprised at this circumstance. In so opulent a nation as that of Britain, where direct taxes from superior wealth, must be much more tolerable, and from the vigor of the government, much more practicable, than in America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind; from imposts and from excises. Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter description.  
In America it is evident, that we must a long time depend, for the means of revenue, chiefly on such duties. In most parts of it, excises must be confined within a narrow compass. The genius of the people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws. The pockets of the farmers, on the other hand, will reluctantly yield but scanty supplies in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and lands. And personal property is too precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way, than by the imperceptible agency of taxes on consumption.  
If these remarks have any foundation, that state of things, which will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource, must be best adapted to our political welfare. And it cannot admit of a serious doubt, that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general union. As far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce, so far it must tend to the extention of the revenue to be drawn from that source. As far as it would contribute to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more simple and efficacious, so far it must serve to answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties more productive, and of putting it in the power of the government to increase the rate, without prejudice to trade.

ment.  
It is therefore, evident, that one national government would be able, at much less expence, to extend the duties on imports, beyond comparison further, than would be practicable to the States separately, or to any partial confederacies: Hitherto I believe it may safely be asserted, that these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any States three per cent. In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent and in Britain they exceed this proportion. There seems to be nothing to hinder their being increased in this country, to at least treble their present amount. The single article of ardent spirits, under Fœderal regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue. Upon a ratio to the importation into this State, the whole quantity imported into the United States may be estimated at four millions of Gallons; which at a shilling per gallon would produce two hundred thousand pounds. That article would well bear this rate of duty: and if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it, such an effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture, to the œconomy, to the morals and to the health of the society. There is perhaps nothing so much a subject of national extravagance, as these spirits.  
What will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent? A nation cannot long exist without revenue. Destitute of this essential support, it must resign its independence and sink into the degraded condition of a province. This is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede. Revenue therefore must be had at all events. In this country, if the principal part be not drawn from commerce, it must fall with oppressive weight upon land. It has been already intimated, that excises in their true signification are too little in unison with the feelings of the people, to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation, nor indeed, in the States where almost the sole employment is agriculture, are the objects, proper for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very ample collections in that way. Personal estate, (as has been before remarked) from the difficulty of tracing it cannot be subjected to large contributions, by any other means, than by taxes on consumption. In populous cities, it may be enough the subject of conjecture, to occasion the oppression of individuals, without much aggregate benefit to the State; but beyond these circles it must in a great measure escape the eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer. As the necessities of the State, nevertheless, must be satisfied, in some mode or other, the defect of other resources must throw the principal weight of the public burthens on the possessors of land. And as, on the other hand, the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the sources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community under such embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation consistent with its respectability, or its security. Thus we shall not even have the consolations of a full treasury to atone for the oppression of that valuable class of the citizens, who are employed in the cultivation of the soil.

hich, by conducing to the interests of commerce,  
would tend to the production of a sufficient revenue. They  
describe duties on importation, not only as that species of tax-  
ation, of all others best adapted to our situation; not only as  
the most productive, the cheapest to collect, the least vexatious  
and the least oppressive, but as a resource indispensable to the  
well being of the American government. The observations  
which they make on this subject, furnish materials for much  
serious reflection, to all the friends of the Union, and especially  
to the agricultural classes of the community.

“But it ts in this aspect of the subject alone, that  
union will be seen to conduce to the purposes of revenue.—  
There are oiher points of view, in which its influence will  
appear more tmimediate and decisive. It is evident, from  
the state of the country, from the habits of the people, from  
the experience we have had on the point itself, that it is  
napracticable to raise any very considerablesums by dircet  
taxation. ‘Tax laws have in vain been multiplied, new  
methods to enforce the collection, have in vain been tried:  
the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed,  
and the treasuries of the states have remained empty. The  
popular system of administration, inberent in the nature of

hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collece

ports and from excises. Duties on unported articles form  
a large braneh of this latter description.  
  
“In America, it is evident, that we must a long time de-  
pend for the means of revenue, chiefly on such duties.—In  
most partsof it, excises must be confined within a narrow  
compass. The genius of the people will illy brook the in-  
quisitions and peremptery spirit of excise lawse The pock-  
cts of the farmers, on the other hand, will reluctantly vield  
but scanty supplics, in the unwelcome shape of impositions  
on thei houses and lands: and personal property is too preca-  
rious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any otherway,  
than by the imperceptible agency of taxes on consumption. ;  
  
“If these remarks have any foundation, that state of things  
which will but enable us to improve and extend so valua-  
ble a resource, must be the best adapted to our political wel-  
fare. And it cannot admit of a serious doubt, that this  
state of things must rest on the laws of a general union.—  
As far as this would be conducive to the interests of com-  
merce, so far it must tend to the extension of the revenue  
to be drawn from that source. As far as it would contri-  
bute to render regulations for the collection of the duties  
more simple and efficacious, we fear it must have to answer  
the purpose of making the same rate of duties more produc-  
tive, and of putting it in the power of government to in-  
crease the rate without prejudice to trade.”
