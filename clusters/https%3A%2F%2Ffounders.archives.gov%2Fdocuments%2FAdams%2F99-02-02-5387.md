An answer to the question, “Whether, and wherein, you have exposed yourself?,” must be grounded on a comprehensive view of your words and works—these are the praecognita to the decision. In the “Discourses on Davila,” which I contemplate as the Titian of your pencil, you observe:—“Nature, which has established in the universe a chain of being, and of universal order, descending from Arch-Angels to microscopic animalcules, has ordained, that no two animals shall be perfectly alike, and no two creatures perfectly equal.”...“No two men are perfectly equal in person, property, understanding activity and virtue, or ever can be made so by any power less than that which created them.” This is true; and in searching for the different features of understanding, which di

Discourses,” you say:—“In proportion to our affection for the notice of others, is our aversion to their neglect; the stronger the desire of the esteem of the public, the more powerful the aversion to their disapprobation. Every man not only desires the consideration of others, but he frequently compares himself with others, his friends or his enemies, and in proportion as he exults when he perceives that he has more of it than they, he feels a keener affliction when he sees that any one or more of them, are more esteemed than himself.”...“The desire of the esteem of others, is as real a want of nature as hunger; and the neglect and contempt of the world, as severe a pain as the gout or stone.”...“The awful feeling of a mortified emulation, is not peculiar to children”...“It almost universally happens, that a superceded officer feels his heart broken by his disgrace. His mind is enfeebled by grief or distorted by resentment; and the instances have been very rare of any brilliant action performed by such an officer”...“Minsters of State are frequently displaced in all countries, and what is the consequence? Are they seen happy in a calm resignation to their fate? Do they turn their thoughts from their former employments to private studies or business? Are they men of pleasant humour and engaging conversation? Are their hearts at ease? Or is their conversation a constant effusion of complaints and murmers, and their breast the residence of resentment and indignation, of grief and sorrow, of malice and revenge? Is it common to see a man get the better of his ambition, and despise the honours he once possessed? Or is he commonly employed in projects upon projects, intrigues after intrigues, and manoeuvres after manoeuvres to recover them? So sweet and delightful to the human heart is that complacency and admiration which attends public offices, that a mind must be sunk below the feelings of humanity; or exalted by religion or philosophy far above the common character of men, to be insensible, or to conquer its sensibility. Pretensions to such conquests are not uncommon, but the sincerity of such pretenders is often rendered suspicious by their constant conversation and conduct, and even by their countenances.”...“There are a few, and God knows but a few, who aim at something more than distinction. They aim at approbation as well as attention; at esteem as well as consideration; and at admiration and gratitude as well as congratulation.”...“But for our humiliation, we must still remember, that even in these esteemed, beloved and adored characters, the passion, although refined by the purest moral sentiments, and intended to be governed by the best principles, is a passion still, and therefore, like all other human desires, inf unlimited and insatiable. No man was ever yet contented with any given share of human adoration. When Caesar declared, that he had lived long enough to glory, Caesar might deceive himself, but he did not deceive the world, who saw his declaration contradicted by every action of his subsequent life. Man constantly craves for more,” &amp;c...“These feelings and resentments, are but other names for jealousy and envy; and altogether they produce some of the keenest, and most tormenting of all sentiments. These fermentations of the passions are so common, and so well known, that the people generally presume, that a person in such circumstances, is deprived of his judgment, if not of his veracity and reason. It is too generally a sufficient answer to any complaint, to any fact alledged, or to any argument advanced, to say that it comes from a disappointed man

The resolution you adopted of Martin Luther, was as aptly adapted to your situation as to your character—a Revolution, as important to mankind as the Reformation in 175 1517, took place in 1775, and of the one you were as much the head as Luther of the other.  
Again. Your Letter, published last Saturday (dated June 10th.) begins with a reflection on Hamilton’s venal appetites. You had alluded to them before, and if they were founded on the affair with his paramour, the bonaroba Reynolds, are you not unkind in laying open that wound? It is an aphorism of Lavater, that “He who has genius and eloquence sufficient to cover, or excuse his errours, yet extenuates not, but rather accuses himself, and unequivocally confesses guilt, approaches the circle of immortals.” It will not be disputed, that he who penitently makes this confession obtains acquitance at the bar of Reason

and, consequently, nothing unallowable. The demands made by Hamilton were very indefinite, and unauthorized by even the laws of Honor. These truths would not perish in oblivion; the mists of prejudice in which they have been obscured, will be dissipated; and the public yield their minds to their just operation. “Nothing,” says a most an acute observer, “is more impartial than the stream like public; always the same, and never the same; of whom, sooner or later, each misrepresented character obtains justice, and each calumniated honour.” Another, less known to fame, but not less accurate in his remarks, observes:—”Talents which are before the public, have nothing to dread from the transcient misrepresentations of party, spleen, or envy. In spite of opposition from any cause, their buoyant spirit will lift them to their proper grade.” “The man who comes fairly before the world, and who possesses the great and vigourous stamina which entitle him to a niche in the temple of glory, has no reason to dread the ultimate result; he will in the end, most indubitably receive that distinction.”

ere religious faith generates this  
fearlessness as to aught that science can do to the prejudice  
of revelation, — this willingness to accept all truth as Divine.  
  
Such are the benefactions of religion to science. Nor has  
science been ungrateful. The obligation of religion to science  
is a no less fruitful theme ; and we hope in another paper to  
trace in the mutual relations of faith and science a rendering  
back of gift for gift, thus verifying in the highest realm of  
thought the homely Hebrew proverb, “The liberal soul shall

unequivocally confesses guilt, approaches the circle of immortals

There is none among them more essential or remarkable, than the  
passion for distinction. A desire to be observed, considered, es-  
teemed, praised, beloved, and admired by his fellows, is one of the
