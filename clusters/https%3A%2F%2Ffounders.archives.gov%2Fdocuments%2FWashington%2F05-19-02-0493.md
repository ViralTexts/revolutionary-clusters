ertain questions arising out of the following case.  
On the 24th instant the following Resolution was passed in the House of Representatives of the United States.  
“Resolved that the President of the United States be requested to lay before this House a Copy of the instructions given to the Minister of the United States who negociated the Treaty with Great Britain communicated by his Message of the 1st instant, together with the correspondence &amp; documents relating to the said Treaty; excepting such of said papers as any existing negociation may render improper to be disclosed.”  
The general question to be considered is this, whether it be or be not expedient for the President to comply in whole or in part with the request contained in said resolution?  
The importance of this question may be inferred from the unqualified terms of the Resolution which clearly assert a right on the part of the House to demand the instruction

s who may be present in Session, the force and obligation of Law, without the consent of the House of Representatives?  
To a right Judgement upon this question a review of the public Acts and proceedings of the United States in respect to the obligation of Treaties appears to be proper.  
The ninth Article of the late confederation empowered the United States in Congress assembled to enter into Treaties &amp; Alliances provided that no Treaty of Commerce should be made whereby the legislative power of the respective States should be restrained from imposing such imposts &amp; duties on foreigners as their own people should be subjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or Commodities whatever.  
Thus it appears that although Congress under the Confederation, had no legislative powers whatever, and though they possessed no authority to regulate the general Interests of Commerce by any internal regulations or even to restrain the clashing systems of the seperate States; yet the powe

y given and actually exercised.  
The sense entertained by Congress of the obligation of Treaties is manifested by the following Resolution which was unanimously adopted on the 21st of March 1787.  
“Resolved that the Legislatures of the several States cannot of right pass any Act or Acts for interpreting explaining or  
  
construing a national Treaty or any part or clause of it: nor for restraining, limiting or in any manner impeding retarding or counteracting the operation &amp; execution of the same, for that on being constitutionally made, ratified &amp; published, they become in virtue of the Confederation part of the Law of the Land, and are not only independent of the power &amp; will of such Legislatures, but also binding and obligatory on them.”  
On the 13th of April 1787, a Circular letter to the States was unanimously agreed to in Congress, in which the principles of the resolution before recited are fully demonstrat

ed to or assumed by the  
continental congress, at variance or in any way in conflict with  
such state legislation.  
  
Nor was there anything in the articles of confederation, adopted  
in 1777, to impair or limit the exercise of legislation upon matters  
having reference to the mere internal police of the several states.  
Each state not only managed its internal police according to its  
pleasure, but exercised that pleasure to a very considerable extent,  
upon the intercourse of the country with other nations, notwith-  
standing the recommendations of congress ; the articles of confed-  
eration, providing that no treaty of commerce should be made  
whereby the legislative power of the respective states should be  
restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners as  
their own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the exporta-  
tion or importation of any species of goods or commodities what-  
ever. This power of laying duties, and regulating and even pro-  
hibiting exportation and importation, retained by the several states,  
was one of the principal causes which led to the subsequent forma-
