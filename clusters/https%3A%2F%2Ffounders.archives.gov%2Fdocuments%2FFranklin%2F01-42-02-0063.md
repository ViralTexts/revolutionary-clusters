e Monde: Tous, ainsi que moi, ont un grand Goût pour lEconomie, et font proffession de cette Vertu; tous ont de très bonnes Raisons de l’aimer, chargé comme ils le sont des impots très pesants qu’exigent les Besoins de lEtat. Or, cela posé, je dis, qu’il est impossible qu’un Peuple Sage, dans de semblables Circonstances, eut fait si longtems usage de  
  
la Lumiere fuligineuse, malsaine, et dispendieuse, de la Bougie et de la Chandelle, s’il eut connu, comme je viens de l’apprendre et de l’Enseigner, qu’on pouvoit s’éclairer pour rien, de la belle et pure Lumière du Soleil.

II.To the AUTHORS of the JOURNAL.  
  
Messieurs,  
  
You often entertain us with accounts of new discoveries. Permit me to communicate to the public through your paper, one that has been lately made by myself, and which I conceive may be of great utility.  
I was the other evening in a grand company, where the new lamp of Messrs. Quinquet and Lange was introduced, and much admired for its splendor; but a general enquiry was made, whether the oil it consumed was not in proportion to the light it afforded, in which case there would be no saving in the use of it. No one present could satisfy us in this point, which all agreed ought to be known, it being a very desireable thing to lessen, if possible, the expence of lighting our apartments, when every other article of family expence was so much augmented.  
I was much pleased to see this general concern for œconomy; for I love œconomy exceedingly.  
I went home, and to bed, three or four hours after midnight, with my head full of the subject. An accidental sudden noise waked me about six in the morning, when I was surprized to find my room filled with light; and I imagined at first that a number of those lamps had been brought into it; but rubbing my eyes I perceived the light came in at the windows. I got up and looked out to see what might be the occasion of it, when I saw the sun just rising above the horizon, from whence he poured his rays plentifully into my chamber, my domestic having negligently omitted the preceding night to close the shutters.  
I looked at my watch, which goes very well, and found that it was but six o’clock; and still thinking it something extraordinary that the sun should rise so early, I looked into the almanack, where I found it to be the hour given for his rising on that day. I looked forward too, and found he was to rise still earlier  
  
every day till towards the end of June; and that at no time in the year he retarded his rising so long as till eight o’clock. Your readers, who with me have never seen any signs of sun-shine before noon, and seldom regard the astronomical part of the almanack, will be as much astonished as I was, when they hear of his rising so early; and especially when I assure them that he gives light as soon as he rises; I am convinced of this. I am certain of my fact. One cannot be more certain of any fact. I saw it with my own eyes. And having repeated this observation the three following mornings, I found always precisely the same result.  
Yet so it happens, that when I speak of this discovery to others, I can easily perceive by their countenances, though they forbear expressing it in words, that they do not quite believe me. One indeed, who is a learned natural philosopher, has assured me that I must certainly be mistaken as to the circumstance of the light coming into my room; for it being well known, as he says, that there could be no light abroad at that hour, it follows that none could enter from without; and that of consequence my windows being accidentally left open, instead of letting in the light, had only served to let out the darkness; and he used many ingenious arguments to shew me how I might by that means have been deceived. I own that he puzzled me a little, but he did not satisfy me; and the subsequent observations I made, as above-mentioned, confirmed me in my first opinion.  
This event has given rise in my mind to several serious and important reflections. I considered that if I had not been awakened so early that morning, I should have slept six hours longer by the light of the sun, and in exchange have lived six hours the following night by candle light; and the latter being a much more expensive light than the former, my love of œconomy induced me to muster up what little arithmetic I was master of, and to make some calculations, which I shall give you, after observing that utility is, in my opinion, the test of value in matters of invention, and that a discovery which can be applied to no use, or is not good for something, is good for nothing.  
I took for the basis of my calculation the supposition that there are 100,000 families in Paris, and that these families consume in the night half a pound of bougies, or candles, per hour. I think this a moderate allowance, taking one family with another; for  
  
though I believe some consume less, I know that many consume a great deal more. Then estimating seven hours per day, as the medium quantity between the time of the sun’s rising and ours, he rising during the six following months from six to eight hours before noon; and there being seven hours of course per night in which we burn candles, the account will stand thus:  
In the six months between the 20 th of March and the 20 th of September, there are  
  
  
Nights,  
183  
  
  
Hours of each night in which we burn candles,  
   7  
  
  
Multiplication gives us for the total number of hours,  
1,281  
  
  
These 1281 hours, multiplied by 100,000, the number of families, give  
128,100,000  
  
  
One hundred twenty-eight millions and one hundred thousand hours, spent at Paris by candle-light, which at half a pound of wax and tallow per hour, gives the weight of  
64,050,000  
  
  
Sixty-four millions and fifty thousand of pounds, which, estimating the whole at the medium price of thirty sols the pound, makes the sum of ninety-six millions and seventy-five thousand livres tournois,  
96,075,000  
  
  
An immense sum! that the city of Paris might save every year, only by the œconomy of using sun-shine instead of candles.  
If it should be said that people are apt to be obstinately attached to old customs, and that it will be difficult to induce them to rise before noon, consequently my discovery can be of but little use; I answer, nil desperandum. I believe all who have common sense, as soon as they have learnt from this paper that it is day-light when the sun rises, will contrive to rise with him; and to compel the rest, I would propose the following regulations:  
First. Let a tax be laid of a louis per window, on every window that is provided with shutters to keep out the light of the sun.  
Second. Let the same salutary operation of police be made use of to prevent our burning candles that inclined us last winter to be more œconomical in burning wood; that is, let guards be placed in the shops of all the wax and tallow chandlers, and no family permitted to be supplied with more than one pound of candles per week.  
  
Third. Let guards also be posted to stop all the coaches, &amp;c. that would pass the streets after sun-set, except those of physicians, surgeons, and midwives.  
Fourth. Every morning, as soon as the sun rises, let all the bells in every church be set ringing; and if that is not sufficient, let cannon be fired in every street, to wake the sluggards effectually, and make them open their eyes to see their true interest.  
All the difficulty will be in the first two or three days; after which the reformation will be as natural and easy, as the present irregularity: for ce n’est que le premier pas qui coute. Oblige a man to rise at four in the morning, and it is more than probable he shall go willingly to bed at eight in the evening; and having had eight hours sleep, he will rise more willingly at four the morning following.  
But this sum of ninety-six millions and seventy-five thousand livres, is not the whole of what may be saved by my œconomical project. You may observe, that I have calculated upon only one-half of the year, and much may be saved in the other, though the days are shorter. Besides the immense stock of wax and tallow left unconsumed during the summer, will probably make candles much cheaper for the ensuing winter, and continue cheaper as long as the proposed reformation shall be supported.  
For the great benefit of this discovery, thus freely communicated and bestowed by me on the public, I demand neither place, pension, exclusive privilege, or any other reward whatever. I expect only to have the honour of it. And yet I know there are little envious minds who will, as usual, deny me this, and say that my invention was known to the antients, and perhaps they may bring passages out of old books in proof of it. I will not dispute with these people that the antients might know the sun would rise at certain hours; they possibly had, as we have, almanacks that predicted it; but it does not follow from thence that they knew he gave light as soon as he rose. This is what I claim as my discovery. If the antients knew it, it must have been long since forgotten, for it certainly was unknown to the moderns, at least to the Parisians, which to prove, I need use but one plain simple argument. They are as well-instructed, judicious, and prudent a people as exist any where in the world, all professing like myself  
  
to be lovers of œconomy; and from the many heavy taxes required from them by the necessities of the state, have surely an abundant reason to be economical. I say it is impossible that so sensible a people, under such circumstances, should have lived so long by the smoaky unwholesome and enormously-expensive light of candles, if they had really known that they might have had as much pure light of the sun for nothing. I am, &amp;c.

I was much pleafed to fee this gene-  
ral concern for economy: for I love  
economy exceedingly.  
  
I went home, and to bed, three or  
four hours after midnight, with my  
head full of the fubje&amp;t. An accidental  
fudden noife waked me about fix in the

I looked at my watch, which goes

be mittaken, as to the circumftance of  
the light coming into my room ; for it  
being well known, as he fays, that there  
could be no light abroad at that hour,  
it follows that none could enter from  
without; and that, of confequence,  
my windows, being accidentally left  
open, inftead of letting in the light, had  
only ferved to let out the darknefs :  
and he ufed many ingenious arguments  
to thew me how I might by that means  
have been deceived. Town, that he puz-  
giel me alittle, but hedid not fatisfy  
me ; and the fubfequent obfervations I  
made, as above-mentioned, confirmed  
me in my firft opinion.  
  
This event has given rife in my mind  
to fevéral ferious and important reflec-  
tions. I confidered, that if I had not  
been awakened fo early that morning, I  
fhould have flept fix hours longer by the  
licht of the fun, and in exchange, have  
lived fix hours the following night by  
candle-light ; and the latter being a much  
more expenfive light than the former,my  
bove for economy induced me to mutter  
up what little arithmetic I was matter of,  
and to make fome calculations, which I  
fhall give you, after obferving, that  
utility is, im my opinion, the teft of  
value in matters of invention; and that  
a difcovery, which can be applied to no  
ufe, or is not good for fomething, is  
good for nothing.  
  
I took for the bafis of my calculation,  
the juppofition that there are 100,000  
tamilies in Paris, and that thefe families  
  
confume in the night half a pound of .  
  
boug es,or candles, per hour. I think this  
a moderate allowance, taking one fami-  
ly with another; for though I believe  
fome confume lefs, I know that many  
confume a great deal more. Then efti-  
mating feven hours per day, as the me-  
dium quantity between the time of the  
fun’s rifling and ours, he rifing during  
  
. the fix following months from fix to  
  
eight hours betore noon—and there  
being feven hours of courfe per night  
in which we burn candles, the account  
will ftand thus :

March and the zoth of September, there  
are nights, 183

An immenfe fum! that the city of  
  
Paris might fave every year, only by  
  
the economy of ufing fun-fhine inftead

If it fhould be faid that people are  
apt to be obftinately attached to old  
cuftoms, and that it will be difficult to  
induce them to rife before noon, confe-  
quently my difcovery can be of but  
little ufe; I anfwer, nil defperandum.  
I believe all who have common fenfe,  
as foon as they have learnt from this  
paper, that itis day-light when the fun  
ries, will contrive to rife with him;  
and to compel the reft, I would pro-  
pofe the following regulations:  
  
Firft. Let a tax be laid of a louis per

vided with fhutters to keep out the light  
of the fun,  
  
Second. Let the fame falutary ope-  
ration of police be made ufe of to pre-  
vent our burning candles, that inclined  
us laft winter to be more economical in  
burning wood ; that is, let guards be  
placed in the fhops ef ali the wax and

tallow chandlers, and no family be per-  
mitted to be fupplied with more than  
one pound of candles per week.  
  
Third. Let guards alfo be pofted to  
ftop all the coaches, &amp;c. that would  
pals the ftreets after fun-fet, except  
thofe of phyficians, furgeons, and mid-  
wives,  
  
Fourth. Every morning, as foon as  
the fun rifes, let all the bells in’ every  
church be fet ringing; and if that is  
not fufficient, let cannon be fired in  
every ftreet, towake the fluggards ef-  
feStually, and make them open their eyes  
to fee their true intereft.  
  
All the difficulty will be in the firft  
two or three days; after which the re-  
formation will be as natural and eafy,  
as the prefent irregularity: for ce m&#x27;eff  
que le premier pas qui coute.Oblige a man  
to rife at four in the morning, and it is  
more than probable he fhall go willing-  
ly to bed at eight in the evening: and  
having had eight hours fleep, he will  
rife more willingly at four the morning  
following.  
  
But this fum of ninety-fix millions  
and feventy-five thoufand livres, is not  
the whole of what may be faved by  
my economical project. You may ob-  
ferve, that I have calculated upon only  
one-half of the year, and much may be  
faved in the other, though the days are  
fhorter. Befides the immenfe ftock of  
wax and tallow left unconfumed during  
the fummer, will probably make can-  
dies mueh cheaper for the enfuing win-  
ter, and continue cheaper as long as  
the propofed reformation fhall be fup-  
ported.  
  
For the great benefit of this difco-  
very, thus freely communicated and  
beftowed by me on the public, I de-  
mand neither place, penfion, exclufive  
privilege, or any other reward whatever.  
I expect only to have the honour of it.  
And yet I know there are littie envious  
minds who will, as ufual, deny me this,  
and fay that my invention was known  
te the ancients, and perhaps they may  
bring paffages out of old books in  
proot of it. Iwill not difpute with  
thefe people that the ancients might know  
the fun would rife at certain howrs ;

they poffibly had, as we have, alma-  
nacks that predicted it; but it does not  
follow from thence that they knew he  
gave light as foon as he rofe. This is  
what I claim as my dilcovery. If the  
ancients knew it, it muft have been  
long fince forgotten, for it certainly  
was unknown to the moderns, at Jeait  
to the Parifians, which to prove, I need  
ufe but one plain fimple argument.  
They are as well-inftructed, judicious,  
and prudent a people as exift any where  
in the world, all profefling like myfelf

many heavy taxes required from then  
by the neceflities of the fate, have fure-

I fay it is impoffible that fo fenfible a

ſigns of ſunſhine before noon, and ſeldom regard  
the: aſtronomical part of the almanack, will be at  
much aſtoniſtied as I was, when they hear of bis  
riſing fo early; and eſpecially when I aſſure them,  
that be gives light as ſoon as be rifes.&#x27; 1 am con-  
vinced of thts. I am certain of the fact. One  
cannot cannot be more certain of any fact. Tiaw  
it with my own eyes. And having repeated this  
obſervation the three following mornings, 1 found  
always preciſely the ſame reſult.  
  
Yet ſo it happens, that when I ſpeak of this dic.  
covery to others, I can ealily perceive by their  
countenances, though they torbear exprefling it  
in words, that they Us no not quite believe me.  
One, indeed, who is a learned natural philoſopher,  
has aſſured me, that I muſt certainly be miſtaken  
as ro the circumſtance of the light coming into  
my room; for it being well known, as he ſay  
  
  
it follows that none could enter from without 3  
  
  
dentally left open, inſtead of letting in the light,  
bad only ſerved to let out the darkneſs: and he  
  
uſed many ingenious arguments to ſhew me how-T  
might, by that means, have been deceived. - I own  
  
  
me; and the ſubſequent obſervations I made, as  
above mentioned, nie me in my firſt Ok.

ſix hours the following night by candle-light z and  
the latter being a much more expenſive light than  
the former, my love of economy induced me to  
muſter up what little arithmetic I was maſter of,  
and to make ſome calculations, which I ſhall give  
after obſerving, that utility is, in my opinion,  
  
the teſt of valve in matters of invention, and  
that a diſcovery which can be applied to no uſe,  
  
or is not good for ſomething, is good for nothing,  
! I took for the baſis of my calculation the ſuppo-  
ſition that there are 100,020 families in Pais,  
and that theſe families conſume in the night half  
à pound of bougies, or candles, per hour. I  
think this is a moderate allowance, taking one fa-  
mily with another; for though I believe ſome  
conſume leſs, I know that many conſume a great  
deal more, Then eſtimating ſeven hours per day,

placed in the ſhops. of the wax and tallow- chand-

mornings, I found always precifely. the  
fame refult.  
  
Yet fo it happens, that when I  
fpeak of this difeovery to others, I can  
eafily perceive by their countenances,  
tliough they forbear expreHTing it in  
words, that they do not quite believe  
me. .One indeed, who is a learned na¬  
tural philolbpher, has alfured me, that  
I mull certainly be miftaken as to the  
circumllance of tlie light coming into  
ray room j for it being well known, as  
he fays, that there could be no light  
abroad at that hour, it fallows that  
none could enter from without j and  
that of confcquence, my windows being  
accidentally left open, inllead of let¬  
ting in the light, had only lerved to  
let out the darknefs: and he ufed many  
ingenious ar|:udi?nts to (how me how  
I might, by that means, have been de¬  
ceived. I own, that he puzzled me  
a little,but he did not (atisfy me; and  
the fubfequent obfervations I made, as  
above mentioned, confirmed me in ray  
firif opinion.  
  
“ This event has given rife in my  
mind to feveral ferious and important  
ieflc6fions. I confidered that, if I had  
not been awakened fo early in the  
morning, I (hould have flept hx hours  
longer by the light of the fun, and in  
exchange have lived fix hours the fol¬  
lowing night by candle-light; and the  
latter being a much more expenfive  
light than the former, my love of eco¬  
nomy induced me to mutter up what  
little arithmetic I was matter of, and  
to make fume calculations, which I ‘  
(hall give you, afl^r obferving that uti¬  
lity is, in my opinion, the teft of value  
I . in matters of invention, and that a difr  
I covery which can be applied to no ufe,  
I or is not good for fometbing, is good  
for nothing.  
  
g “ I took for the balis of ray cal-  
culation the fuppofition that,there are  
100,000 families in Paris, and that thefe  
families confume in the night half a  
pound of bougies, or candles per hour.  
  
I think this is a moderate allowance,  
taking one family with another; for  
though I believe fome confume lc(s,  
I know that many confume a^grcit deal  
-more. 7 &#x27;hen ettimating (even* hours

Fourth, Every morning, at Toon at  
the fun riies, let all the bells in every  
church be fct ringing; and. if that it  
not AifHcient* let cannon be fired in  
every ftreet, to wake the fltiggards  
cfTe^fually, and make them open their  
eyei to fee their true intei clK  
  
“ All the difficulty will be in the  
firft two or tiuec days : after which  
the refornnation will be as natural and  
eafy as the preftnt irregularity: for,  
iin*^que it premer pas qui coutt. Oblige  
a man to rife at four in the morning,  
and it is more than probable he (hall go  
willingly to bed at eight in the even¬  
ing ; and, having had eight hours*  
deep, he will rife more willingly at  
four the morning following. But this  
fum of ninety-fix millions and feventy-  
five thoufand livres is not the whole of  
what may&#x27;be laved by my economical  
projeff. You may obferve, that I have  
calculated upon only one half of the  
year, and much may be faved in the  
other, though the days are (horter. Be-  
fidet, the immenfc dock of wax and  
tiUow left uncon fumed during the fum-  
mer will probably make candles much  
cheaper for th- enfuing winter, and  
continue them cheaper as long as the  
propofed reformation (hall be fup-  
ported.  
  
“ For the great benefit of this dlfco-  
very, thus freely communicated and  
beftowed by me on the public, I de¬  
mand neither place, penfion, exclufive  
privilege, nor any other reward what¬  
ever. Jexpe^f only to h.avc the honour  
of it. And yet I know there are little  
envious minds who will, as ufual, deny  
me this, and fay, that my invention  
was known to the ancients, and per-  
haps they may bring paffages out of  
the old books in proof of it. I will not  
difpute with thefe people, that the  
ancients knew not the (un would rife  
at ceruin hours; they pofTibly had,  
as we have, almanacks that predict¬  
ed it t but it does not follow from  
thence, that they knew be gave light  
asfoon at be ro/e. This is what I claim  
as my difeovery. If the ancients knew  
it, it might hate been long fince for¬  
gotten, for it certainly was unknown  
to the irodemt, at leaft to the Pari,  
fiant, which to prove, 1 need ufe but  
one plain (imple argument. They are  
as well indruffed, judicious, and pru¬  
dent a people as exift any where in  
the worlds all profelCng&#x27;, like rnyfelf.  
  
to be lovers of economy; and, from  
the many heavy taxes required from  
them by the neceffities of the ftatc,  
have furely an abundant reafon to be  
economical. I fay It is impoflTible, that  
fo fenfihlea people, under fuch circum-  
ffance$,(hould have lived long by the  
fmoaky, unwholcfome, and enormoufly  
expenfive light of candles, if they had  
really known, that they might have had  
as much pure light of the fun for no¬  
thing.

AN ECONOMICAL PROJECT.  
Atanslation of this Letter appeared in one of the daily papers  
of Paris about the year 1784. The following is the original  
piece, with sume a*ditions and corrections mace by the Author.  
To the Authors of the Journal.  
MESSIEURS,  
  
You often entertain us with accounts of new discoveries.  
Permit me to communicate to the public, through your paper,  
one that has lately been made by myself, and which I con-  
ceive may be of great utility.  
  
Iwas the other evening in a grand company, where the  
new a 4 of Messrs. Quinquet and Lange was introduced,  
tnd much admired for its splendor ;‘but a general inquiry was  
made, whether the oil it consumed was not in proportion to  
the light it afforded, in which case there would S no saving  
inthe use of it, No one present could satisfy us in that point,  
which all agreed ought to be known, it being a very desirable  
thing to lessen, if possible, the expense of lighting our apart-  
ments, when every other article of family expense was so  
much augmented.  
  
I was pleased to see this general concern for economy, for  
Llove economy exceedingly.  
  
I went home, and to bed, three or four hours after midnight,  
with my head full of the subject. An accidental sudden  
noise waked me about six in the morning, when I was sur~  
  
ised to find my room filled with hght; and I imagined at  
  
that a number of those lamps had been brought into it :  
but, rubbing my eyes, I perceived the light came in at the  
windows, I got up and looked out to see what might be the  
cecasion of it, when [ saw the sun just rising above the ho-  
tion, from whence he poured his rays plentifully into m  
chamber, my domestic having segignatly omitted the preced-  
mg evening to close the shutters,  
looked at my watch, which goes very well, and found  
that it was about six o’clock; and still thinking it something  
extraordinary that the sun should rise so early, I looked into  
the almanack, where I found it to be the hour given for his  
rismg on thatday. I looked forward too, and found he was  
to rise still earlier every day till towards the end of June ; and  
hat at no time in the year he retarded his rising so long as  
till eight o’clock. Your readers, who with me have never  
seen any signs of sunshine before noon, and seldom regard  
the astronomical part of the almanack, will be as much as-  
tonisned as [ was, when they hear of bis rising so early ; and  
especially when I assure them, that he gives light as soon as  
he rises, I am convinced of this. I am certain of my fact.  
One cannot be more certain of any fact. I saw it with my  
own eyes. And having repeated this observation the three  
wing mornings, I found always precisely the same result.  
  
Yet it so happens, that when T speak of this discovery to  
others, I can easily perceive by their countenances, though  
they forbear expressing it in words, that they do not quite be~  
  
me. One, indeed, who is a learned natural philosopher,  
bas assured me, that [ must certainly be mistaken as to the  
Circumstance of the light coming into my room ; for it being  
Well known, as he says, that there could be no light abroad at  
that hour, it follows that none could euter from without ; and  
that of consequence, my windows being accidentally left open,  
instead of letting in the light, had only served to let out the  
  
ness: and he used many ingenious arguments to show  
me how [ might, by that means, have been deceived. I own  
that he puzzled me a little, but he did not satisfy me ; and the  
  
  
  
  
  
subsequent observations I made as above mentioned, confirm-  
ed me in my first opinion,  
  
This event has given rise, in my mind, to several serious.  
and important reticctions. I considered that, if L had not  
been awakened so early in the morning, I should have slept  
six hours longer by the light of the sun, and in exchange have  
lived six hours the following night by candle-light; and the  
latter being a much more expensive light than the former, my  
love of economy induced me to muster up what little arith-  
metic I was master of, and to make some calculations, which  
I shall give you, after observing, that utility is, in my opinion,  
the test of value in matters of invention, and that a discove-  
ry which can be applied to no use, or is not good for some-  
  
ing, is good for ating,  
  
I took for the basis of my calculation the supposition, that  
there are 100,000 families in Paris, and that these families  
consume in the night half a pound of bougies, or candies, per  
hour. I think this is a moderate allowance, taking one faini~  
ly with another ; for though I believe some consume less, I  
know that many consume a great deal more. Then estimat-  
ing seven hours per day, as t i uantity t the  
time of the sun’s rising aud ours, he rising during the six fol-  
lowing months from six to eight hours before noon, and there  
being seven hours of course per night in which we burn can-  
dies, the account will stand thus :—  
  
In the six months between the twentieth of March and the  
  
twentieth of September, there are Nights . 183  
Hour of each night in which we burn candles , 7  
Multiplication gives for the total number of hours 1,281  
These 1,281 hours multiplied by 100,000, the  
  
number of inhabitants given . . « « « 128,100,000  
One hundred and twenty-eight millions and one  
  
hundred thousand hours, spent at Paris by can-  
  
dle-light, which at half a pound of wax and  
tallow per hour, gives the weight of :  
= millions and fifty thousand of pounds,  
which, estimating the whole at the medium  
price of thirty sols the pound, makes the sum  
of ninety-six millions and seventy-five thou-  
sand livres tournois. . ee - 96,075,000  
  
An immense sum! that the city of Paris might save every  
year by the economy of using sunshine instead of candles.  
  
If it should be said, that people are apt to be obstinately  
  
ttached to old . ee it will be difficult to induce  
them to rise before noon, consequently my discovery can be  
of little use; L answer, Nil desperandum. I believe all who  
have common sense, as soon as they have learnt from this  
paper, that it is day-light when the sun rises, will contrive to  
rise with him; and, to compel the rest, [ would propose the  
following regulation :  
  
First. Let a tax be laid of a louis per window, on every  
bp that is provided with shutters to keep out the light of  
the sun,  
  
Second. Let the same salutary operation of police be made  
use of to prevent our burning candles, that inclined us last  
winter to be more economical in burning wood; that is, let  
 amages be placed in the shops of the wax and tallow-chand-  
ers, and no family be itted to be supplied with more  
than one pound of candles per week,  
  
Third. Let guards also be posted to stop all the coaches,  
&amp;ec., that wonlt pass the streets after sunset, except those of  
physicians, surgeons, and midwives. .  
  
‘ourth, Every morning as soon as the sun rises, let all  
the bells in every church be set a ringing; and if that is not  
sufficient, let cannon be fired in every street, to wake the  
sluggards effectually, and make them open their eyes to see  
their true interest,  
  
All the difficulty will be in the first two or three days ; after  
which the reformation will be as natural and easy as the pre-  
sent irregularity ; for ce n’est que le premier pas qui coute.  
Oblige a man to rise at four in the morning, and it is more  
than probable he shall go willingly to bed at eight in the even-  
ing ; and, having had eight hours sleep, he will rise more wil-  
lingly at four the following morning. But this sum of nine-  
ty-six millions, and seventy-five thousand livres is not the  
whole of what may be saved by my economical —- You  
may observe that I have calculated upon only one half of the  
year, and much may be saved in the other, though the days  
are shorter. Besides, the immense stock of wax and tallow  
left unconsumed during the summer, will probably make can-  
dies much cheaper for the ensuing winter, and continue cheap-  
er as long as the proposed reformation shall be supported.  
  
For the great benefit of this discovery, thus freely commu-  
nicated bestowed by me on the public, I demand neither  
place, pension, exclusive privilege, or any other reward what-  
ever. I expect only to have the honor of it. And yet I know  
there are little envious minds who will, as usual, deny me  
this, and say, that my invention was known to the ancients,  
and perhaps they may bring passages out of the old books in  
proof of it, I wil! not dispute with these people that the an-  
cients knew not the sun would rise at certain hours; the  
possibly had, as we have, almanacks that predicted it : but it  
does not follow from thence, that they knew he gave light as  
soon ashe rose. ‘This is what I claim as my discovery. If  
the ancients knew it, it must have been long since forgotten,  
for it certainly was unknown to the moderns, at least to the  
Parisians; which to prove, I need but use one plain simple  
argument. They are as well instructed, judicious, and pru-  
dent a people as exist any where in the world, all professing,  
like myself, to be lovers of economy; and, from the many  
heavy taxes required from them by the necessities of the  
state, have surely reason to be economical. I say, it is im-  
possible that so sensible a people, under such cireumstances,  
should have lived so long by the smoky, unwholesome, and  
  
  
  
  
  
64,050,000  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
known that they might have had as much pure light of the  
sun for nothing. lam, &amp;e.
