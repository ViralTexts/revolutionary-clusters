United States January 1st 1796  
  
Born, sir, in a land of liberty; having early learned its value; having engaged in a perilous conflict to defend it; having, in a word, devoted the best years of my life to secure its permanent establishment in my own country; my anxious recollections, my sympathetic feelings, and my best wishes are irresistably excited, whensoever in any country I see an oppressed nation unfurl the banners of freedom. But above all, the events of the French Revolution have produced the deepest solicitude, as well as the highest admiration. To call your nation brave, were to pronounce but common praise. Wonderful people! Ages to come will read with astonishment the history of your brilliant exploits! I rejoice that the period of your toils and of your immense sacrifices, is approaching. I rejoice that the interesting revolutionary movements of so many years have issued in the formation of a constitution designed to give permanency to the great object for which you have contended. I rejoice that liberty, which you have so long embraced with enthusiasm, liberty, of which you have been the invincible defenders, now finds an asylum in the bosom of a regularly organised government; a government, which, being formed to secure the happiness of the French People, corresponds with the ardent wishes of my heart, while it gratifies the pride of every citizen of the United States by its resemblance to their own. On these glorious events accept, sir, my sincere congratulations.  
  
In delivering to you these sentiments, I express not my own feelings only, but those of my fellow citizens, in relation to the commencement; the progress, and the issue of the French Revolution: and they will cordially join with me in purest wishes to the Supreme Being, that the citizens of our sister republic, our magnanimous allies, may soon enjoy in peace, that liberty, which they have purchased at so great a price, and all the happiness which liberty can bestow.  
I receive, sir, with lively sensibility, the symbol of the triumphs and of the enfranchisement of your nation, the colours of France, which you have now presented to the United States. The transaction will be announced to congress; and the colours will be deposited with those archives of the United States, which are at once the evidences and the memorials of their freedom and independence. May these be perpetual! and may the friendship of the two republics be commensurate with their existence.

belongs to them as Americans. It is a con­  
tribution to the general fund in which all

From George Washington to Grover  
Cleveland.  
When monarchy was first overthrown in  
France, and republican government estab­  
lished in its place, GeorGe WAshinGToN  
was President of the United States.  
Through its Minister to this country, the  
new republic presented to the American  
people a standard of the French colors.  
This was the reply, in part, of President  
WAshinton to the presentation address  
of Mr. Adet, the French Minister:  
Born, sir, in a land of liberty; having early learned  
its value; having engaged in a perlious conflict to  
defend it; having, in a word, devoted the best years  
of my life to secure its permanent establishment in my  
own country, my anxious recollections, my sympa  
thetic feelings, and my best wishes are irresistibly  
  
excited, whensoever, in any country, I see an oppressed  
nation unfurl the banners of freedom. I rejoice that  
the period of your toils and your immense sacrifices is  
approaching. I rejoice that the interesting revolu  
tionary movements of so many years have issued in  
the formation of a Constitution designed to give  
permanency to the great object for which you have  
contended. I rejoice that liberty now finds an asylum  
in the bosom of a regularly organized Government; a  
Government which, being formed to secure the happi­  
ness of the French people, corresponds with the ardent  
wishes of my heart, while it gratifies the pride of  
every citizen of the United States, by its resemblance  
to their own. On these glorious events, accept, sir, my  
sincere congratulations.  
&quot;In delivering to you these sentiments, I axpres  
not my own feelings only, but those of my fellow citi­  
zens, in relation to the commencement, the progress,  
and the issue of the French revolution.&quot;
