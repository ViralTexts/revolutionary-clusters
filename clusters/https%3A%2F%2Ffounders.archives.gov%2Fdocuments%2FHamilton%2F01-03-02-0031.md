The great art is to distribute the public burthens well and not suffer them, either first, or last, to fall too heavily upon parts of the community; else distress and disorder must ensue. A shock given to any part of the political machine vibrates through the whole.  
As a sufficient revenue could not be raised from trade to answer the public purposes, other articles have been proposed.  
A moderate land and poll tax, being of easy and unexpensive collection, and leaving nothing to discretion, are the simplest and best, that could be devised.

Indeed many theorists in political œconomy have held, that all taxes, wherever they originate fall ultimately upon land; and have therefore been of opinion, that it would be best to draw the whole revenue of the state immediately from that source, to avoid the expence of a more diversified collection, and the accumulations which will be heaped in their several stages upon the primitive sums advanced in those taxes, which are imposed on our trade.

In the form under which it has been offered in these papers, the poor properly speaking are not comprehended, though it is true that beyond the exclusion of the indigent the tax has no reference to the proportion of property; but it should be remembered that it is impossible to devise any specific tax, that will operate equally on the whole community.

d in measuring the abilities of those over whom their power extends; and assessors will ever be a set of petty tyrants, too unskilful, if honest, to be possessed of so delicate a trust, and too seldom honest to give them the excuse of want of skill. The genius of liberty reprobates every thing arbitrary or discretionary in taxation. It exacts that every man by a definite and general rule should know what proportion of his property the state demands. Whatever liberty we may boast in theory, it cannot exist in fact, while assessments continue. The admission of them among us is a new proof, how often human conduct reconciles the most glaring opposites; in the present case the most vicious practice of despotic governments, with the freest constitutions and the greatest love of liberty.  
The establishment of permanent funds would not only answer the public purposes infinitely better than temporary supplies; but it would be the most effectual way of easing the pe

 Congress to appoint its own officers of the customs, collectors of taxes, and military officers of every rank, is to create in the interior of each state a mass of influence in favour of the Fœderal Government. The great danger has been shown to be, that it will not have power enough to defend itself and preserve the union, not that it will ever become formidable to the general liberty. A mere regard to the interests of the confederacy will never be a principle sufficiently active to curb the ambition and intrigues of different members. Force cannot effect it: A contest of arms will seldom be between the common sovereign and a single refractory member; but between distinct combinations of the several parts against each other. A sympathy of situations will be apt to produce associates to the disobedient. The application of force is always disagreeable, the issue uncertain. It will be wise to obviate the necessity of it, by interesting such a number of individuals in each state in support of the Fœderal Government, as will be counterpoised to the ambition of others; and will make it difficult for them to unite the people in opposition to the just and necessary measures of the union.  
There is something noble and magnificent in the perspective of a great Fœderal Republic, closely linked in the pursuit of a common interest, tranquil and prosperous at home, respectable abroad; but there is something proportionably diminutive and contemptible in the prospect of a number of petty states, with the appearance only of union, jarring, jealous and perverse, without any determined direction, fluctuating and unhappy at home, weak and insignificant by their dissentions, in the eyes of other nations.

sidered an income tax to fall within the one  
category or the other. It is certain that they  
never would have endorsed the theory of the  
Supreme Court that an income tax is an ex­  
cise. AdAM SMith was the great contem  
poraneous writer on questions of taxation  
and with his writings the fathers of the  
Jonstitution were familiar. It is not im  
probable that they considered an income  
tax to be in reality a capitation tax, for such  
is the view held by ADam SMith in his  
great work  
AlExANder HAMiltoN, in the Continen  
taltst, on July 18, 1781, said  
As a sufficient revenue could not be raised from  
trade to answer the public purposes, other articles  
have been proposed. A moderate land and poll tax  
being of easy and unexpensive collection, and leaving  
nothing to discretion, are the simplest and best that  
could be devised.  I has been ofected toa o  
tae at a flwed rate, that it will be unequal, and the  
rich will pay no more than the poor. In the form  
in tchich it has been offered in these pupers the poor  
properly speaking, are not comprehended, though it­  
is true, that bevond the exclusion of the indigent, the  
tarr has no reference to the proportion of property, but  
it should be remembered that it is impossible to de  
vise any specific tax that will operate equally on the  
whole community.
