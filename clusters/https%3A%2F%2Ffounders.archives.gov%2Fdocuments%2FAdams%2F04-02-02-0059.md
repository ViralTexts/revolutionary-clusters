.  
I am put upon a Committee to prepare a Device for a Golden Medal to commemorate the Surrender of Boston to the American Arms, and upon another to prepare Devices for a Great Seal for the confederated States. There is a Gentleman here of French Extraction, whose Name is Du simitiere, a Painter by Profession whose Designs are very ingenious, and his Drawings well executed. He has been applied to for his Advice. I waited on him yesterday, and saw his Sketches. For the Medal he proposes Liberty with her Spear and Pileus, leaning on General Washington. The British Fleet in Boston Harbour, with all their Sterns towards the Town, the American Troops, marching in. For the Seal he proposes. The Arms of the several Nations from whence America has been peopled, as English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch, German &amp;c. each in a Shield. On one side of them Liberty, with her Pileus, on the other a Rifler, in his Uniform, with his Rifled Gun in one Hand, and his Tomahauk, in the other. This Dress and these Troops with this Kind of Armour, being peculiar to America—unless the Dress was known to the Romans. Dr. Franklin shewed me, yesterday, a Book, containing an Account of the Dresses of all the Roman Soldiers, one of which, appeared exactly like it.  
This Mr. Du simitiere is a very curious Man. He has begun a Collection of Materials for an History of this Revolution. He begins with the first Advices of the Tea Ships. He cutts out of the Newspapers, every Scrap of Intelligence, and every Piece of Speculation, and pastes it upon clean Paper, arranging them under the Head of the State to which they belong and intends to bind them up in Volumes. He has a List of every Speculation and Pamphlet concerning Independence, and another of those concerning Forms of Government.  
Dr. F. proposes a Device for a Seal. Moses lifting up his Wand, and dividing the Red Sea, and Pharaoh, in his Chariot overwhelmed with the Waters.—This Motto. Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.  
Mr. Jefferson proposed. The Children of Israel in the Wilderness, led by a Cloud by day, and a Pillar of Fire by night, and on the other Side Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon Chiefs, from whom We claim the Honour of being descended and whose Political Principles and Form of Government We have assumed.  
I proposed the Choice of Hercules, as engraved by Gribeline in some Editions of Lord Shaftsburys Works. The Hero resting on his Clubb. Virtue pointing to her rugged Mountain, on one Hand, and perswading him to ascend. Sloth, glancing at her flowery Paths of Pleasure, wantonly reclining on the Ground, displaying the Charms both of her Eloquence and Person, to seduce him into Vice. But this is too complicated a Group for a Seal or Medal, and it is not original.

sketches. In one of them he showed the arms  
of the several nations from whence America had  
been peopled, as English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch,  
German, etc., each in a shield. On one side of  
them he placed Liberty, with her cap; on the  
other a rifleman in his uniform, with his rifle in  
one hand and a tomahawk in the other, that dress  
and weapons being peculiar to America. Dr.  
Franklin proposed for the device, Moses lifting  
his wand and dividing the Red Sea, and Pha-  
roah and his chariot overwhelmed with the wa-  
ters. For a motto, the words of Cromwell, I  
believe: ‘REBELLION TO TYRANTS I8 OBEDIENCE

The Great Seal af the Uaited State*.  
After the declaration of independence  
and the final separation of the colonies  
from England, one of the first matters to  
which the colonial Congress gave attention  
was the preparation of a great seal lor the  
use of the newly confederated States. As  
early as July 4, 1776, Dr. Franklin, John  
Adams and Thomas Jefferson were ap­  
pointed a committee to furnish a design,  
ind John Adams, in a letter to his wife,  
gives the first suggestions of the commit­  
tee. He writes: .  
••Dr Franklin proposes as a device tor a  
seal, Moses lifting np his wand and divid­  
ing the Red sea, and Pharaoh in his chariot,  
overwhelmed with the waters. This motto,  
&#x27;Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to G -id.

Saxon cniefs from whom we claim the  
honor ot being descended, and whose  
political principles and form of govern­

choice of Hercules; the hero resting on his
