n strict confidence, &amp; with frankness &amp; freedom.  
On my way home, and since my arrival here, I have endeavoured to learn from sensible &amp; moderate men—known friends to the Government—the sentiments which are entertained of public measures. These all agree that the Country is prosperous &amp; happy; but they seem to be alarmed at that system of policy, and those interpretations of the Constitution which have taken place in Congress.  
Others, less friendly perhaps to the Government, and more disposed to arraign the conduct of its Officers (among whom may be classed my neighbour, &amp; quandom friend Colo M) go further, &amp; enumerate a variety of matters, wch. as well as I can recollect, may be adduced under the following heads. Viz.  
First   That the public debt is greater than we can possibly pay before other causes of adding new debt to it will occur; and that this has been artificially created by adding together the whole amount of the debtor &amp; creditor sides of the accounts, instead of taking only their balances; which could have been paid off in a short time.  
2d.   That this accumulation of debt has taken for ever out of our power those easy sources of revenue, which, applied to the ordinary necessities and exigencies of Government, would have answered them habitually, and covered us from habitual murmerings against taxes &amp; tax gatherers; reserving extraordinary calls, for extraordinary occasions, would animate the People to meet them.  
3d.   That the calls for money have been no greater than we must generally expect, for the same or equivalent exigencies; yet we are already obliged to strain the impost till it produces clamour, and will produce evasion, and war on our citizens to collect it, and even to resort to an Excise law, of odious character with the people; partial in its operation; unproductive unless enforced by arbitrary &amp; vexatious means; and committing the authority of the Government in parts where resistance is most probable, &amp; coercion least practicable.  
  
4th   They cite propositions in Congress, and suspect other projects on foot, still to encrease the mass of the debt.  
5th.   They say that by borrowing at ⅔ of the interest, we might have paid of[f] the principal in ⅔ of the time; but that from this we are precluded by its being made irredeemable but in small portions, &amp; long terms.  
6th.   That this irredeemable quality was given it for the avowed purpose of inviting its transfer to foreign Countries.  
7th.   They predict that this transfer of the principal, when compleated, will occasion an exportation of 3 Millions of dollars annually for the interest; a drain of Coin, of which as there has been no example, no calculation can be made of its consequences.  
8th.   That the banishment of our Coin will be compleated by the creation of 10 millions of paper money, in the form of Bank-bills now issuing into circulation.  
9th.   They think the 10 or 12 pr Ct. annual profit, paid to the lenders of this paper medium, are taken out of the pockets of the people, who would have had without interest the coin it is banishing.  
10th.   That all the Capitol employed in paper speculation is barren &amp; useless, producing, like that on a gaming table, no accession to itself, and is withdrawn from Commerce and Agriculture where it would have produced addition to the common mass.  
11th   That it nourishes in our citizens vice &amp; idleness instead of industry &amp; morality.  
12th.   That it has furnished effectual means of corrupting such a portion of the legislature, as turns the balance between the honest Voters which ever way it is directed.  
13th.   That this corrupt squadron, deciding the voice of the legislature, have manifested their dispositions to get rid of the limitations imposed by the Constitution on the general legislature; limitations, on the faith of which, the States acceded to that instrument.  
14th   That the ultimate object of all this is to prepare the way for a change, from the present republican form of Government, to that of a monarchy; of which the British Constitution is to be the model.  
15th.   That this was contemplated in the Convention, they say is no secret, because its partisans have made none of it—to effect it then was impracticable; but they are still eager after their object, and are predisposing every thing for its ultimate attainment.  
16th.   So many of them have got into the legislature, that, aided by the corrupt squadron of paper dealers, who are at their devotion, they make a majority in both houses.  
17th   The republican party who wish to preserve the Government in its present form, are fewer even when joined by the two, three, or half a dozen antifederalists, who, tho’ they dare not avow it, are still opposed to any general Government: but being less so to a republican than a Monarchical one, they naturally join those whom they think pursuing the lesser evil.  
18th.   Of all the mischiefs objected to the system of measures beforementioned, none they add is so afflicting, &amp; fatal to every honest hope, as the corruption of the legislature. As it was the earliest of these measures it became the instrument for producing the rest, and will be the instrument for producing in future a King, Lords &amp; Commons; or whatever else those who direct it may chuse. Withdrawn such a distance from the eye of their Constituents, and these so dispersed as to be inaccessible to public information, and particularly to that of the conduct of their own Representatives, they will form the worst Government upon earth, if the means of their corruption be not prevented.  
19th.   The only hope of safety they say, hangs now on the numerous representation which is to come forward the ensuing year; but should the majority of the new members be still in the same principles with the present—shew so much deriliction to republican government, and such a disposition to encroach upon. or explain away the limited powers of the constitution in order to change it, it is not easy to conjecture what would be the result, nor what means would be resorted to for correction of the evil. True wisdom they acknowledge should direct temperate &amp; peaceable measures; but add, the division of sentiment &amp; interest happens unfortunately, to be so geographical, that no mortal can say that what is most wise &amp; temperate, would prevail against what is more easy &amp; obvious; they declare, they can contemplate no evil more incalculable than the breaking of the Union into two, or more parts; yet, when they view the mass which opposed the original coalescence, when they consider that it lay chiefly in the Southern quarter—that the legislature have availed themselves of no occasion of allaying it, but on the contrary whenever Northern &amp; Southern prejudices have come into conflict, the latter have been sacraficed and the former soothed.  
20th.   That the owers of the debt are in the Southern and the holders of it in the Northern division.  
21st.   That the antifederal champions are now strengthened in argument by the fulfilment of their predictions, which has been brought about by the Monarchical federalists themselves; who, having been for the new government merely as a stepping stone to Monarchy, have themselves adopted the very construction, of which, when advocating its acceptance before the tribunal of the people, they declared it insuceptable; whilst the republican federalists, who espoused the same government for its intrinsic merits, are disarmed of their weapons, that which they denied as prophecy being now become true history. Who, therefore, can be sure they ask, that these things may not proselyte the small number which was wanting to place the majority on the other side—and this they add is the event at which they tremble.  
These, as well as my memory serves me, are the sentiments which, directly and indirectly, have been disclosed to me.  
To obtain light, and to pursue truth, being my sole aim; and wishing to have before me explanations of as well as the complaints on measures in which the public interest, harmony and peace is so deeply concerned, and my public conduct so much involved; it is my request, and you would oblige me in furnishing me, with your ideas upon the discontents here enumerated—and for this purpose I have thrown them into heads or sections, and numbered them that those ideas may apply to the corrispondent numbers. Although I do not mean to hurry you in giving your thoughts on the occasion of this letter, yet, as soon as you can make it convenient to yourself it would—for more reasons than one—be agreeable, &amp; very satisfactory to me.  
The enclosure in your letter of the 16th. was sent back the Post after I received it, with my approvin

the pariicalar attention of our readers to the  
following passages:  
% Objection 3. That the Lanishment of our  
coin will be completed by the creation of ten  
milliong of paper money, in the form of bank  
bills, now issuing into circulation. l  
# 9. They think that ten or twelve per cent.  
annual profit, paid to the lenders of this paper |  
medium, is taken out of the pockets of the peo- i  
ple, who would have had without interest the  
coin it is banishing. &#x27;  
¢lO. That all the capital employed in paper  
circulation is barren and, useless, produe- 1  
ing, like that at a gaming table, no accession  
to itself, and is withdrawn from commerce and 1  
.ﬁriculture, when it would have produced an  
addition to the cominon mass. {  
4 11. That iv nourishes in our citizens habits  
of vice and idleness, instead of industry and  
morality.  
¢12.&quot; That it has furnished effectual means  
of corrnptlni such a portion of the Legislature  
as turns the balance between the honest voters,  
whichever way it is directed.  
©l3. That this corrupt squadron, deridin  
the voice of the Legislature, have mlnifcoteg  
Aheir disposition to get rid of the limitations  
imposed by the Constitution upon the General  
Legielature—limitations on the faith of whick  
the Siates acceded to that instrument,  
“14. That the ultimate object of all this is  
t» prepare the way for a change from the pre­  
gent republican form of government to that of  
molarchy, of which the British Constitution 1s  
to be the model.  
  
¢ 15, ‘il&#x27;hat this was contemplated in the Con­  
vention, they say, is no sccrel, beeause its par­  
tisans have made none of it. To effect it then  
was impracticable, but they are still eager after  
object, and are pre-disposing every thirg for  
its uitimate attainment.  
  
“16. So many of them hive got into the  
Legislatare, that, aided by the corrupt squad­  
ron of paper dealers, who areat their devotion,  
they inake a majority in both houses.  
“17. The Republican party, who wish to  
preserve the Government in its present foria,  
are fewer, even when joined by two or three,  
or half a dozen anti-Federalists, who, thoogh  
they dare not avow it, are still opposed to the  
General Government; but being less so to a  
republican than a monarchal one, they natural­  
ly join to those who they think are pursuing  
the less evil. 7  
  
18, Of ali the mischief objected to this sys­  
tem of measnres before mentioned, none, they !  
add, is so afflicting and fatal to every honest  
hape as the corraption of the Logislature. Au‘  
it was the earlicst of these measures, it beecame  
the instrument for producing the rest; and  
will be the instrument of producing in future,  
a King, Lords, and Comuwons, or whatever cles  
those who dircet it may choose, Wiithdrawn  
such a distance from the eyes of thewr con­  
stituents, and these g 0 disperscd as not to be  
accessibie to political inforination, and particu­  
larly to that of the conduct of their own Re­  
pres ntatives, they will form the worst gpovern­  
ment wpon carth, if the means of their corrup­  
tion be not prevented.  
«19. The only hepe of safety, they say,  
hangs now on the numerous representation  
which 1s $o come forward the ensuing year ;  
bat should the majority of the new members  
be still in the same principles with the px‘csunt,‘  
show 89 winzh dereliction from republican go­  
vernment, and such a disposition to encroach  
upon, or explain away, the limited powers of  
the Constitution, in order to change it, il is  
nol e:sy to conjectare what would be the re­  
sult, not what I,cans v ould be resorted to for  
the correction of th: ¢v:l. T&#x27;rue wisdom, they  
enknowledge, sliontd direet temperately and  
peaceably ; but, they add, the division of sen­  
timents and intorests hoppens unfortunately to  
be g 0 geograpiiical, that ne mortal can say that  
what 18 net wise and temperate would prevail  
against what is more easy and obvious. They  
declare they can contemplate no evil more in­  
calculable than the breaking of the Union into  
two or more parts; yet, when they view the  
mass which opposed the orizinal coalescence,  
they consider that it lay ehiefly in the Southern  
quarter, and that the legislatures have availed  
themselves of no occasion of allaying it; but,  
on the contrary, whenever Northern and Southe.  
ern prejudices have come into conflict, the  
latter have been sacrificed, and the former  
soothed. ’  
  
¢ 20. That the anti-Federal champions are  
now strengthened in argument by the fulfil­  
ment of their predictions, which has been  
brought about by the monarchical Federalists  
themselves ; who, having been for the new go­  
vernment merely as a stcgping-ntone to mon­  
archy, have themselves adopted the very con­  
struction

LPrivate and confidential  
Mount Vernon, July 23, 1792  
My Dear Sirt: On my way home, and  
strife my arrival here. have endeavored  
lo learn from sensible and moderate, risen,  
known Irieuds to the government, the senti­  
ments which are entertained of public mea­  
sures. These all agree thai the country is  
properotis ami happ , but they seem to be  
alarmed at that system of policy, and those  
interpretations of the constitution, which  
have taken place in Congress. Others less  
friendly, perhaps to the government, and  
more disposed lo arraign ihe conduct of i s  
ollicers (among whom may be classed my  
neighbor and qtiond-im friend Cdom-I  
M.,) f?o further, and enumerate a variety  
of inapers, which, its well as I recollect.  
nay be adduced under ihe following  
heads.  
1. &quot;That the public de&#x27;ni is greater than  
e can possibly pay, before other cans, s  
of adding new debt to it will occur; and  
that tins has been arnficially created. by ad­  
ding together ihe . hole amount of the debt­  
or ami creditor sides of the accounts, in­  
stead of taking only their balances, which  
could have been paid olf in a short  
time.  
2. &quot;That the accumulation of debt has  
taken forever out of our power those easy  
sources of revenue, which, applied to ihe  
ordinary necessities and exigencies of gov­  
ernment, would have anweied them hab­  
itually, and covered us from habitual ir.ur­  
murings against taxes and tax gatherers,  
reserving extraordinary calls for extraordi­  
nary occasions, which would animate the  
people to meet them.  
2-. &quot;That, though the calls for money  
have been no greater than wu must gene­  
eraily expect for the same or equivalent  
exigt-ncies, vet we are alreadv obliged lo  
strain the impost till it produces clamor,  
and will produce evasion ami war on our  
own Citizens lo co&#x27;iecl ii; and even to re­  
sort lo an excise law, of odious character  
with the people, partial in its operation,  
unproductive, unless enforced by arbitrary  
and vexatious means, and committing the  
authority of the jrovernment in parts where  
rrislanre is most probable and coercion  
least practicable.  
4. &quot;Thev cite proposition in Congress,  
and suspect other projects on foot, stiil to  
increase the mass of the debt.  
5. &quot;Thev say. that by borrowing at  
two thirds of the interest we might have  
paid off the principal in two-thirds of the  
lime; but that from this we are precluded  
by its being made irredeemable but in  
small portions and at long terms-  
6. &#x27;&quot;That this irredeemable quality was  
given to it for the avowed purpose of invi­  
ting its transfer to foreign countries.  
7. &quot;They predict that this transfer of  
the principal, when completed, will occa­  
sion an exportation of ihree millions of  
dollars annually for the interest, a drain of  
coin, of which as there has heed no exam­  
ple, no calculation can be made of its con­  
sequences.8. &quot;That the b . -iment of our coin will  
bo completed by the creation of ten millions  
  
of paper money in ihe form of bank bills,  
no&#x27;v issuing into circulation.  
&#x27;J. &quot; They think the ten or twelve per  
cent, annual profit, paid lo the lenders ol  
this paper medium, 13 taken out of the  
pockets of ihe people, who would .have  
had without interest liie coin it is banish­  
ing.10. &quot;That all the capital employed in  
paper speculation is barren and us- le?s.  
producing, like 1 lint on a gaming-lable, no  
accession to itself, and is withdrawn from  
commerce and agriculture where it would  
have produced an addition lo the comutoi;  
mass.  
11. &quot;That it nourishes in our citizens  
habits of vice and idleness instead of indus­  
try ami morality  
  
12. &quot;Thai it has furnished effectual  
means of corrup&#x27;ing such a poriioti of t&#x27;ie  
legislature, as turns the b dance bj-iwteii  
the honest voters, whichever way it is di­  
rected.13. &quot;That t&#x27;&#x27;js corntpt squadron, deci­  
ding the voice of the legislature have  
manifested their depositions ui gel rd of  
ihe limitations imposed by ihe constitution  
on the general legislaiure; limitations, on  
lite filth of which the Slates acceded to that  
instrument.  
14. &quot;That the ultimate object of allihis  
is to prepare the way for a change finii  
the gresent republican form of governmVni  
to thai of a monarchy, of which the Biit­  
ish constitution is to be the model.  
15. &quot;That this was contemplated in tfce  
convention, they say, is no secret because  
its partisans have made none of it. To  
effect it then was impracticable, bui they  
arc still eager al&#x27;ler their ol ject, and ate  
predisposing every tiling for its ultimate  
anainment.  
15. &quot;S many of them have got into the  
legislature, that, aided by the corrupt  
scju idroii of paper dealers, w ho are at rieir  
devotion, they make a majority in both  
houses.  
17. &quot;The republican party, who wisli  
to pre-erve the government in its pre-ent  
form, are fewer, even when joined by the  
two, three, or half-dozen anti-federalists,  
who though they dare not avow it, are stiil  
opposed to any general government; bui,  
being less so to a republican than a monar­  
chical one, they naturally join thos&#x27;e whom  
they think pursuing the less evil.  
IS. &quot;Of all ihe mischiefs objected (o the  
system of measures before u.entioned, none,  
they add, is t-o arlliclnig and fatal to every  
honest hope as the corruption of the legis­  
lature. As it was ihe earliest of these mea­  
sures, it became the instrument for produ­  
cing the resi; and will foe the instrument  
of producing in future a kii.g, lords, and  
commons, r whatever else those who di  
reel it may choose. W ithdrawn such a  
distance from the eve of iheir coiistiiuuits,  
and these so il.spe.sed as to. be iu;i-cessthe  
to public in lor nation, and p--itnctilarl v to

tives, ihey ili f iroi the w hi si g em uii&#x27;in

hangs ii.i.v on tne ti&#x27;.meroiis representation,

but s:.ou!d ihe majority of ihe new mem­  
bers be still in the same principles With the  
present, show so much lerel.ciion of i epuh  
lican government, and such a dtsposi ion  
to eneroacii upon or explain away the  
limited powers ol ihe constitution in ordrr  
to change it, it is not easj to conjecmre  
what would be the result, nor w hat means  
would be resorted lo for ihe correction of  
the evil. True wisdom, they ackno a ledge,  
should direct temperate and peaceable  
measures; but, ihey add, the division of  
sentiments ami interest happens nnlortu­  
naiely lo bo so geographical, that no mor­  
tal can say thai what is most vie and tem­  
perate would prevail agains w hat is more  
easy and obvious. They declare they can  
contemplate no evil more incalculable than  
the breaking of the Union into two or mor  
pans; yet when they view ihe mass, which  
opposed the original coalescence, they con­  
sider that it lay chiefly in the southern  
quarter, and that the legislature have avail­  
ed tlieui- le o) no occasion of allaying it,  
bu, on the contraiy, whenever nor. hern

. . - Private and confidential.  
Mount Vernan, July 29, 1792.  
i My Dear Sir: On my way home, and since  
my arrival here, I have endeavored to learn from  
sensible and moderate men, known friends to the  
goVernment the sentiments which are entertained  
of public measures. These all agree that the  
country is prosperous and happy, but they seem  
to be alarmed aX that system of policy, and those  
interpretations of the constitution, which have ta­  
ken place in Congress. Others less friendly, per  
haps, to the government and more disposed to ar  
raign the conduct of its officers (among whom  
may be classed my neighbor and quondam friend  
Colonel JV1., ) go further, and enumerate a variety  
of matters, which, as well as I recollect, may be  
adduced under the lollowmsr heads.  
1. &quot;That the public debt is greater than we can  
possibly pay, before other causes of adding new  
debt to it will occur ; and that this has been artifi  
cially created by adding together the whole a­  
mount of the debtor and creditor sides of the ac­  
counts, instead of taking only their balances, which  
could have been paid off in a short time.  
2. &quot; 1 hat this accumulation of debts has taken  
forever out of our power those easy sources of  
revenue, which, applied to the ordinary necessi­  
ties and exigences of government would have an  
swered them habitually, and covered us from hab  
itual murmmings against taxes ana taxgatnerers,  
reserving extraordinary calls for extraordinary oc  
casions, which would animate the people to meet  
them.  
3. &quot;That, though the calls for money have  
been no greatef than we must generally expect  
for the same or equivalent exigences, yet we are  
already obliged to strain the impost till it produces  
clamor, and Mall produce evasion and war on our  
own citizens to collect it ; and even to resort to an  
excise law, of odious character with the people,  
partial in its operation, unproductive, unless en­  
forced by arbitrary and vexatious means, and com  
mitting the authority 01 the government m parts  
where resistance is most probable and coercion  
least practicable.  
4. &quot;They cite propositions m Congress, and  
suspect other projects on foot, still to increase the  
mass of the debt  
5. &quot;They say, that by borrowing at two-thirds  
of the interest we might have paid off the princi­  
pal in two-thirds of the time ; but that from this  
we are precluded by its being made irredeemable  
but in small portions and at long terms.  
6. &quot;That this irredeemable quality was given  
to it for the avowed purpose of inviting its transfer  
to foreign countries.  
7. &quot;They predict that this transfer of the prin­  
cipal, when completed, will occasion an exporta­  
tion of three millions of dollars annually for the  
interest, a drain of coin, of which, as there has  
been no example, no calculation can be made of  
its consequences.  
8. &quot;That the banishment of our coin will be  
completed by the creation of ten millions of paper  
money in the form of bank bills, now issuing into  
circulation.  
9. &quot;They think the ten or twelve per cent an­  
nual profit, paid to the lenders of this paper me  
dium, is taken out cf the pockets of the people,  
111 11 . .  
who wouict nave naa witnout interest tne com it  
is banishing.  
10. &quot;That all the capital employed in paper  
speculation is barren and useless, producing, like  
that on a gaming-table, no accession to itself, and  
is withdrawn from commerce and agriculture,  
where it would have produced an addition to the  
common mass. .  
11. &quot;That it nourishes in our citizens habits of!  
vice and idleness instead of industry and morality.  
12. &quot;That it has furnished effectual means of  
corrupting such a portion of the legislature, as  
turns the balance between the honest voters,  
whichever way it is directed.  
13. &quot;That this corrupt squadron, deciding the  
voice of the legislature have manifested their dis­  
positions to get rid of the limitations imposed by  
the constitution on the gpneral legislature ; limi  
tations, on the faith of which the States acceded to  
that instrument  
14. &#x27;That the ultimate object of all this is to  
prepare the way for a change from the present re­  
publican form of government to that of a monar­  
chy, of which the British constitution is to be the  
model.  
15. &quot;That this was contemplated in the con  
vention, they say, is no secret, because its parti­  
sans have made none of it. To effect it then was  
impracticable, but they are still eager after their  
object, and are predisposing every thing for its ul­  
timate attainment  
16. &quot;So many of them ha ve got into the legis  
lature, that, aided by the corrupt squadron ofpaper-dealers,  
who are at their devotion, they make  
a majority in , both houses.  
17. &quot;The republican party, who wish to pre­  
serve the government in its present form, are few  
er, even when joined by the two, three, or naii­  
dozen anti-federalists, who, though they dare not  
avow it, are still opposed to any general govern­  
ment: but, being less so to a republican than  
a monarchical one, they naturally join tnose  
whom they think pursuing the less evil.  
18. &quot;Of all the mischiefs objected to the system  
of measures before mentioned, none, they add, is  
so afflicting and fatal to every honest hope, as the  
corruption of the.leffislature. . As it was the ear  
liest of these measures, it became the instrument  
for producing tbe rest ; and will be the instrument  
of producing in luture a king, lords, and commons  
or whatever else those who direct it may choose.  
Withdrawn such a distance from the eye of their  
constituents, and these so dispersed as to be mac  
cessible to public information, and particularly to  
that of the conduct of their own representatives,  
they will form the worst government upon earth  
if the means of their corruption be not prevented.  
19. &quot;The only hope of safety, they say, hangs  
now on the numerous representation, which is to  
come forward the ensuing year; but should the  
mioritv of the new members be still in the same  
principles with the present, show so much derelic­  
tion of republican government, arkl such a dis­  
position to : encroach upon or explain away the  
George Mason.  
  
limited powers of the constitution in order to  
change it, it is not easy to conjecture, what would  
be the result, nor what means would be resorted  
to for the correction of the evil. True wisdom,  
they acknowledge, should direct temperate and  
peaceable measures; but, they add, the division of  
sentiments and interest happens unfortunately to  
be so geographical, that no mortal can say that  
what is most wise and temperate would prevail a­  
gainst what is more easy and obvious. They de­  
clare they can contemplate no evil more incal­  
culable than the breaking of the Union into two  
or more parts; yet When they view tbe mass,  
which opposed the original coalescence, they con-  
  
sider that it lay chiefly in the southern quarter,  
and that the legislature have availed themselves  
of no occasion of allaying it, but, on the contrary  
whenever northern and southern &#x27; prejudices have  
come into conflict, the latter have been sacrific ed  
and the former soothed.  
20. &quot;That the owners- of the debt are in the  
southern, and the holders of it in the northern di­  
vision.21. &quot;That the anti-federal champions are now  
strengthened in argument by the fulfilment of their  
predictions, which has been brought about by the  
monarchical federalists themselves ; who, having  
been for the new erovernrnent merely as a stepping  
stone to monarchy, have themselves adopted the  
very constructions of the constitution, ofwhich when  
advocating the acceptance before the tribunal of the  
people, they declared it unsusceptible j whilst the  
republican federalists, who espoused the same gov?  
ernment for its intrinsic merits, are disarmed of  
their weapons ; that which they denied as pro  
phecy, being now become true history. Who,&#x27;  
therefore, can be sure, they ask, that these things  
may not proselyte the small number, which was  
wanting to place the majority on the other side ?  
And this, they add, is the event at which they trem  
ble.&quot; f .  
These, as well as my memory serves mo, are  
the sentiments, which directly and indirectly havo  
been disclosed to me. To obtain light and to pnr-  
sue truth being ray solo aim, and wishing to. have  
before me explanations of, as well as the com  
plaints on, measures, in which the public interest,  
harmony, and peace are so deeply concerned, and  
my public conduct so much involved, it is my re­  
quest, and you ,would oblige me by furnishing me  
with your ideas upon the discontents her.e enum­  
erated! ; and for this purpose I have thrown thern  
into heads or sections, and numbered them, that  
those ideas may be applied to the correspondent  
numbers. Although I do not mean to hurry you  
in giving your thoughts on the occasion of this  
etter, yet, as soon as you can make it convenient  
to yourself, it would for more reasons than one  
be agreeable and very satisfactory lo me.
