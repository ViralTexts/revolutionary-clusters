Sir,  
						Department of State March 25th: 1808:  
					  
					Having laid before the President Your Letter of the 23d. of Febry., explaining the character of certain British orders of Council issued in Novr. last, I proceed to communicate the observations and representation which will manifest to Your Government, the  
						Sentiments of the President, on so deep a violation of the commerce and rights of the United States  
					These Orders interdict to neutral nations, or rather to the United States, now the only Commercial nation in a State of neutrality, all Commerce with the enemies of Great Britain, now nearly the whole commercial world, with certain exceptions only, and  
						under certain regulations, but too evidently fashioned to the Commercial, the manufacturing, and the fiscal policy of Great Britain, and on that account, the more derogatory from the honor and Independence of neutral nations.  
					The Orders are the more calculated to excite surprize in the United States, as they have disregarded the remonstrances conveyed in my letters of March 20: &amp; 29th: 1807, against another order of Council issued on a similar plea; in the month of January  
						1807. To those just remonstrances, no answer was indeed ever given; whilst the Order has been continued in its pernicious operation, against the Lawful commerce of the United States. And we now find added to it others constituting still more ruinous depredations, without even  
						the addition of any new pretext: and when moreover, it is notorious, that the Order of January was of a nature, greatly to overbalance in its effects, any injuries to Great Britain that could be apprehended from the illegal operation of the French Decree on which the Order  
						was to retaliate, had that Decree, in its illegal operation, been actually applied to the United States, and been acquiesced in by them.  
					The last Orders, like that of Jany. proceed on the most unsubstantial foundation. They assume for fact, an acquiescence of the United States, in an unlawful application to them of the French Decree: and they assume for a principle, that the right of  
						retaliation accruing to one belligerent against a neutral, thro’ whom an injury is done by another belligerent, is not to have for its measure, that of the injury received, but may be exercised in any extent, and under any modifications, which may suit the pleasure, or the  
						policy of the complaining party.  
					The fact, Sir, is unequivocally disowned. It is not true that the United States have acquiesced in an illegal operation of the French Decree: Nor is it even true, that at the date of the British Orders of Novr. 11, a single application of that Decree to the  
						commerce of the United States on the high Seas, can be presumed to have been Known to the British Government.  
					The French Decree in question has two distinct aspects; one clearly importing an intended operation within the territorial limits as a local Law; the other aparently importing an intended operation on the high Seas.  
					Under the first aspect the Decree, however otherwise objectionable, cannot be Said to have violated the neutrality of the United States. If the Governing Powers on the Continent of Europe, chuse to exclude from their Ports, British property or British  
						productions, or neutral Vessels proceeding from British Ports, it is an Act of Sovereignty which the United States have no right to controvert. The same Sovereignty is exercised by Great Britain at all times, in peace as well as in War, Towards her Friends as well as her  
						enemies. Her Statute Book presents a thousand illustrations.  
					It is only, therefore; under the other aspect of the Decree, that it can have violated neutral rights; and this would have resulted from its execution on the high Seas, whether on the pretext of a nominal blockade, or with a view to enforce a domestic  
						regulation against foreign Vessels not within the domestic precincts, but under the authority and protection of the law of Nations.  
					Had then the French Decree been executed on the High Seas against the commerce of the United States with Great Britain? and have the United States acquiesced in the unlawfull and injurious proceeding?  
					I state, Sir, on undeniable authority that the first instance in which that Decree was put in force against the neutral rights of the United States, was that of the Horizon; an American Ship bound from Great Britain to Lima; wrecked within the territorial  
						jurisdiction of France, but condemned under an exposition of the Decree extending to the high Seas its operation against neutrals. This judicial decision took place as late as the 30th: day of October 1807, and was not officially Known to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the  
						United States at Paris, till some time in November. At the date therefore of the first Order of Great Britain, no injury whatever had been done to her, thro’ an aggression on the commerce of the United States. No presumption even had been Sufficiently authorized, that the  
						express Stipulations in the Treaty of France with the United States, would not exempt their commerce at least, from the operation of any Edict incompatible with them. At the date even of the latter Orders of Novr: 11: it appears that the only aggression, which had then  
						occurred, was pretty certainly unknown to the British Government, and could therefore have had no Share in producing this alledged retaliation.  
					To the fact that the case of the Ship Horizon was the first that occurred, of an execution of the French Decree, on the high Seas, I am able to add, that as late as the 30th: of November, no other case had been brought into the French Court of prizes. From  
						accounts which have lately appeared, it is more than probable that unlawful Captures by French Cruizers, have since taken place; but it remains to be Known, whether they are to be referred to the concurence of the French Government, in the judgment pronounced in the case of  
						the Horizon; or not rather, to a French Decree of the 17th. of December last, professing to be a retaliation on the British Orders of Novber. 11th.  
					I State with equal confidence, that at no time, have the United States acquiesced in violations of their neutral rights injurious to Great Britain, or any other belligerent nation. So far were they, in particular, from acquiescing in the French Decree of  
						Novber. 1806, that the moment it was Known to their Minister at Paris, he called for explanations of its meaning in relation to the United States, which were favorable; and uncontradicted by the actual operation of the Decree; that he Steadily watched over the proceedings  
						under it, with a readiness to interpose against any unlawful extention of them, to the commerce of the United States; that no time was lost, after the Decree came to the Knowledge of the Government here; in giving him proper instructions on the Subject; that he was equally  
						prompt, on receiving the Decision of the Court, in the case of the Horizon, in presenting to the French Government, a remonstrance in terms which can never be censured for a defect of energy, and that by the first opportunity after that decision reached the President, the  
						particular instructions required by it, were forwarded to that Minister. Nor is it to be forgotten, that previous to the British Orders of November, it had been explicitly communicated to the British Government, by the American Minister at London, that explanations,  
						uncontradicted by any overt act, had been given to our Minister at Paris, which justified a reliance that the French Decree would not be put in force against the United States; and that the communication was repealed to the British Government, immediately on the publication  
						of those orders.  
					What more could have been required on the part of the United States, to obviate retaliating pretensions of any Sort on the part of Great Britain? Retaliations are measures of rigor in all cases. Where they are to operate thro’ a third and involuntary party,  
						they will never be hastily resorted to, by a magnanimous, or a just power; which will always allow to the third party its right to discuss the Merits of the case; and will never permit itself to enforce its measures, without affording a reasonable time; for the use of  
						reasonable means for substituting another remedy. What would be the Situation of neutral powers if the first blow levelled thro’ them by one belligerent against another, was to leave them no choice, but between the retaliating vengeance of the latter, and an instant  
						declaration of war against the former. Reason revolts against this, as the sole alternative. The United States could no more be bound to evade the British Orders by an immediate War with France, than they were bound to atone for the burning of the French Ship of War on the  
						Shore of North Carolina, by an immediate resort to Arms, against Great Britain.  
					With respect to the principle assumed by the British Orders, it is perfectly clear, that it could not justify them in the extent given to their operation, if the facts erroniously assumed, could have been fully Sustained.  
					Retaliation is a specific or equivalent return of injury for injury received, and where it is to operate thro’ the interests of a third party having no voluntary participation in the injury received, the return ought, as already observed, to be inflected  
						with the most forbearing hand.  
					This is the language of common sense, and the clearest equity. As the right to retaliate results merely from the wrong suffered, it cannot in the nature of things extend beyond the extant of the Suffering. There may often be a difficulty in applying this  
						rule, with exactness, and a reasonable latitude may be allowable on that consideration. But a Manifest and extravagant departure from the rule can find no apology.  
					What then is the extent of the injury experienced by Great Britain from the measures of her enemies so far as the operation of these measures thro’ the United States, can render them in any sense responsible?  
					A mere declaration by a belligerent, without the intention or the means, to carry it into effect, against the rights and obligation of a neutral nation, and thence against the interests of another belligerent, could afford no pretext to the latter to  
						retaliate at the expence of the neutral. The declaration might give just offence to the neutral, but it would belong to him alone, to decide on the course prescribed by the respect he owed to himself.  
					No real damage having accrued to the belligerent, no indemnity could accrue.  
					For the same reason, a declaration of a belligerent which he is known to be either not in a Situation, or not to intend to carry, but partially into execution against a Neutral to the injury of another belligerent, could never give more than a right, to a  
						commensurate redress against the neutral. All remaining unexecuted, and evidently not to be executed, is merely ostensible, working no injury to any, unless it be in the disrespect to the neutral, to whom alone it belongs to resent or disregard it.  
					Bring the case before us to this plain and equitable test. The French Decree of Novber. 1806 undertook to declare the British Isles in a State of blockade, to be enforced, if you please, against the neutral commerce of the United States, on the high Seas,  
						according to the faculty possessed for the purpose. As far as it was actually enforced, or an effect resulted from an apprehension that it could, and would be enforced, it was an injury to Great Britain for which let it be supposed, the United States were  
						answerable. On the other hand, as far as it was not enforced and evidently, either would not, or could not be enforced, no injury was experienced by Great Britain, and no remedy could lie against the United States. Now, Sir, it never was pretended that at the date of the 1st.  
						British Order issued in Jany. 1807, any injury had occured to, or was apprehended by Great Britain from an execution of the French Decree against the Commerce of the United States, on the Theatre of their neutral rights: So far from it, that the Order Stands self condemned,  
						as a measure of retaliation, by expressly Stating that the Fleets of France and her allies, instead of being able to enforce the blockade of the British Isles, were themselves confined to their own Ports by the entire Superiority of the British Navy; converting thus, by the  
						Strongest of reasonings, the Security of Great Britain against injury from the French Decree, into a title to commit injury on a neutral party. In the Novber. Orders, also, whilst it is admitted, that the French Decree could not be but imperfectly executed for want of means,  
						it is asserted that the intention of the French Decree, and not the injury accruing from its operations, thro’ the commerce of the United States, is the Scale by which the retaliating injury against them is to be measured.  
					Such are the pretexts, and such the principles, on which one great branch of the Lawful commerce of this Country, became a victim to the first British Order, and on which the last orders are now Sweeping from the Ocean, all its most valuable remains.  
					Against Such an unprecedented System of Warfare on neutral rights, and National Independence, the common judgment, and common feelings of mankind, must forever protest.  
					I touch Sir, with reluctance the question on which of the belligerent side, the invasion of neutral rights had its origin. As the United States do not acquiesce in these invasions by either, there could be no plea for involving them in the controversy. But  
						as the British Orders have made the Decree of France, declaring contrary to the law of Nations the British Isles in a state of Blockade, the immediate foundation of their distructive warfare on our commerce, it belongs to the Subject, to remind Your Government of the illegal  
						interruption and Spoliations Suffered, previous to that Decree, by the neutral commerce of the United States, under the proceedings of British Cruisers and Courts, and for the most part, in consequence of express Orders of the Government itself. Omitting  
						proofs of inferior Note, I refer to the extensive aggressions on the trade of the United States founded on the plea of blockades, never Legally established according to recognized definitions, to the Still more  
						extensive violations of our commerce with Ports of her Enemies, not pretended to be in a State of blockade; And to the British order of Council issued near the commencement of the existing War. This order, beside its general interpolation against the  
						established law of Nations, is distinguished by a Special ingredient, violating that law as recognized by the course of decisions in the British Courts. It Subjects to capture and condemnation, all neutral vessels, returning with lawful cargoes, on the Sole  
						consideration, that they had, in their outward voyage deposited contraband of War, at a hostile Port.  
					If the commerce of the United States, could therefore in any case, be reasonably made the Victim and the Sport of Mutual charges and reproaches between belligerent parties with respect to the priority of their aggressions on Neutral  
						commerce; Great Britain must look beyond the Epoch she has chosen for illegal Acts of her adversary, in Support of the allegation on which She founds her retaliating Edicts against our Commerce.  
					But the United States are given to understand that the British Government has, as a proof of its indulgent and Amicable disposition toward them, mitigated the authorized rigor it might have given to its measures by certain exceptions peculiarly favorable to  
						the commercial interests of the United States.  
					I forbear Sir, to express all the emotions with which Such a language, on such an occasion is calculated to inspire a Nation, which cannot for a Moment be unconscious of its rights, nor mistake for an alleviation of wrongs, regulations, to admit the  
						validity of which would be, to assume badges of humiliation, never worn by an Independent Power.  
					The first of these indulgences is a commercial intercourse with the Dependences of the Enemies of Great Britain, and it is considered as inhanced by its being a deviation, in favor of the United States, from the ancient and  
							established principle of Maritime law, prohibiting altogether such an intercourse in time of War.  
					Surely, Sir, Your Government, in assuming this principle, in Such terms, in relation to the United States, must have forgotten their repeated and formal protests against it, as these are to be found in the discussions and communications of their Minister at  
						London, as well as in explanations occasionally made on that Subject, to the British representative here. But permit me to ask, more particularly, how it could have happened, that the principle is characterized as an ancient and established one? I put the question the more  
						freely, because it has never been denied, that the principle as asserted by Your Government, was for the first time introduced during the war of 1756. It is, in fact invariably cited and described in all Judicial and other official transactions &quot;as the rule of 1756.&quot; It can  
						have no pretensions therefore to the title of an Ancient rule.  
					And instead of being an established rule or principle, it is well Known that Great Britain is the only nation that has acted upon, or otherwise given a Sanction to it: Nay, it is not even an established principle in the  
						practice of Great Britain herself. When first applied in the War of 1756, the Legality of a Neutral trade with Enemy’s Colonies, was not contested by it. In certain cases, only, of the Colonial trade, the  
						Allegation was, that the presumptive evidence arising from circumstances against the bona fide Neutrality of the Ownership justified the condemnation, as of Enemy’s property. If the rule of condemnation was afterwards, during that war, converted into the  
						principle now asserted, it could not possibly have been in operation, in its new Shape, more than a very few Years. During the Succeeding war of 1778, it is admitted by every British Authority, that the principle was never brought into operation. It may be regarded, in fact  
						as having been Silently abandoned. And within the period of War, Since its commencement in 1792. the manner in which the principle has been alternately contracted and extended, explained sometimes in one way, sometimes in another, rested now on this  
						foundation, and now on that, is no secret to those who have attended to its history and progress in the British orders of Councils, and the British Courts of Admiralty.  
					With the exception therefore of a period, the l in modern times, from which authentic precedents of Maritime law will be drawn, and throughout which the United States more interested in the question, than any Other Nation, have  
						uniformly combatted the innovation, the principle has not in the British Tribunals, been in operation for a longer term than Three, four or five Years, whilst in no other has it ever made its appearance, but to receive a decision protesting against it.  
					Such is the Antiquity, and Such the Authority, of a principle, the deviation from which are held out as so many favors, consoling the United States, for the wide spread destruction of their legitimate commerce.  
					What must be said, as to the other exceptions which Seem to have been viewed as claims on the gratitude of the United States? Is it an indulgence to them, in carrying on their trade with the whole Continent of Europe, to be laid under the necessity of going  
						first to a British Port, to accept a British Licence, and to pay a tribute to the British Exchequer; as if we had been reduced to the Colonial situation, which once imposed these Monopolizing restraints?  
					What, again, must be said as to the other features which we see blended on the face of these regulations? If the policy of them be to Subject an Enemy to privations, why are channels opened for a British trade with them, which they are Shut to a Neutral  
						trade? If in other cases the real object be to admit a neutral trade with the Enemy, Why is it required that neutral Vessels, shall perform the ceremony of passing thro’ a British Port; When it can have no imaginable effect, but the known and inevitable one, of prohibiting  
						the admission of the trade into the Port of destination?  
					I will not ask, why a primary article of our productions and exports, Cotton wool, is to be distinguished in its transit, by heavy impost not imposed on other articles because it is frankly avowed, in your explanation of the orders, to be intended as an  
						encouragement to British Manufactures, and a check to the rival ones of France? I suppress also, tho’ without the Same reason for it, the enquiry, why less rigorous restrictions are applied to the trade of the Barbary Powers, than are enforced against that of a Nation such as  
						the United States, and in relations, such as have existed between them and Great Britain.  
					I cannot however pass without notice the very unwarrantable innovations contained in the two last of the Orders.  
					In one of them, a certificate of the local origin of a Cargo, altho permitted in the Port of departure, and required in the Port of destination, by regulations purely domestic in both, and Strictly analogous in principle to regulations in the Commercial  
						code of Great Britain, is made a cause of Capture on the high Seas, and of condemnation in her Maritime Courts. In the other order, the Sale of a Merchant Ship by a belligerent owner to a neutral, altho, a transaction as legal when fair, as a dealing in any other articles, is  
						condemned by a general rule; without an atom of proof, or of presumption, that the transfer, in the particular case, is fraudulent, and the property, therefore left in an Enemy.  
					In fine, Sir, the President sees in the Edicts communicated by you, facts assumed which did not exist; principles asserted which never can be admitted; and, under the name of retaliation, measures transcending the limits reconciliable with the facts, and  
						the principles, if both were as corrects as they are unfounded. He sees moreover, in the modifications of this System, regulations violating equally our neutral rights and our national Sovereignty. He persuades himself therefore, that Your Government will see, in the justice  
						of the observations now made, in addition to those I had the honor verbally to State to you in the first instance, that the United States are well warranted in looking for a Speedy revocation of a System, which is every day augmenting the Mass of injury, for which the United  
						States have the best of claims to redress. I have the honor to be, Sir, with Sentiments of high consideration and respect Your Most Obt. Servant

tral nations, or rather to the U.  
States, now the only commercial  
nation in a state of neutrality, all  
commerce with the enemies of  
Great Britain, now nearly the  
whole commercial world, with  
certain exceptions only, and un-  
der certain regulations, but too  
evidently fashioned to the com-  
mercial, the manufacturing, and  
the fiscal policy of Great Britain ;  
and, on that account, the more de-  
rogatory from the honor and inde-  
pendence of neutral nations.  
  
The orders are the more cal-  
culated to excite surprise in the  
United States, as they have dis-  
regarded the remonstrances con-  
veyed in my letters of the 20th  
and 29th of March, 1807, against  
another order of council, issued  
ona similar plea, in the month  
of January, 1807. To those just  
remonstrances no answer was in-  
  
deed ever given; whilst the or-  
  
der has continued in its pernicious  
operation against the lawful com-  
merce of the United States ; and  
we now find added to it, others,  
instituting still more ruinous de-  
predations, without even the ad-  
dition of any new pretext: and  
when, moreover, it is notorious  
that the order of January was of  
anature greatly to overbalance,  
in its effects, any injuries to Gt.  
Britain that could be apprehend-  
ed from the illegal operation of  
the French decree, on which the  
order was to retaliate, had that  
decree, in its illegal operation,  
been actually applied to the U.  
States, and been acquiesced in by  
them.  
  
The last orders, like that of  
January, proceed on the most  
unsubstantial foundation. They  
assume for fact, an acquiescence  
of the United States, in an un-  
  
VOL. Iv.  
  
lawful application to them of the  
Trench decree ; and they assume  
for a principle, that the right of  
retaliation accruing to one belli-  
gerent is not to have for its mea-  
sure that of the injury received ;  
but may be exercised in any ex-  
tent, and under any modifications,  
which may suit the pleasure or  
the policy of the complaining  
party.  
  
The fact, sir, is unequivocally  
disowned. It is not true that the  
United States have acquiesced in  
an illegal operation of the French  
decree ; nor is it even true, that  
at the date of the British orders  
of November 11, a single appli-  
cation of that decree to the com-  
merce of the United States, on  
the high seas, can be presumed  
to have been known te the British  
government.  
  
The French decree in question  
has two distinct aspects; one  
clearly importing an intended  
operation within the territorial li-  
mits as a local law ; the other ap-  
parently importing an intended  
operation on the high seas.  
  
Under the first aspect, the de-  
cree, however otherwise objec-  
tionable, cannot be said to have  
violated the neutrality of the U.  
States. Ifthe governing powers  
on the continent of Europe choose  
to exclude from their ports, Bri-  
tish property or British produc-  
tions, or neutral vessels, proceed-  
ing from British ports, it is an act  
of sovereignty which the United  
States have no right to contro-  
vert. The same sovereignty is  
exercised by Great Britain, at all  
times, in peace as well as in war,  
towards her friends as well as her  
enemies. Her statute books pre-  
  
- sents a thousand illustrations.  
  
It is only, therefore, under the

other aspect of the decree, that  
it can have violated neutral rights :  
and this would have resulted  
from its execution on the high  
seas, whether on the pretext of  
a nominal blockade, or with a  
view to enforce a domestic regu-  
lation against foreign vessels, not  
within the domestic precincts, but  
under the authority and protec-  
tion of the law of nations.  
  
Had then the French decree  
been executed on the high seas  
against the commerce of the U.  
States with Great Britain; and  
have the United States acquiesced  
in the unlawful and injurious  
proceeding ?  
  
I state, sir, on undeniable au-  
thority, that the first instance, in  
which that decree was put in  
force against the neutral rights of  
the United States, was that of  
the Horizon, an American ship  
bound from Great Britain to Li-  
ma, wrecked within the territo-  
rial jurisdiction of France, but  
condemned under an exposition  
of the decree, extending to the  
high seas its operation against  
neutrals. This judicial decision  
took place as late as the 16th day  
of October, 1807, and was not  
officially known to the minister  
plenipotentiary of the United  
States at Paris till some time in  
November. Atthe date, there-  
fore, of the first order of Great  
Britain, no injury whatever had  
been done to her, through an ag-  
  
ession on the commerce of the  
  
nited States. No presumption  
even had been sufficiently autho-  
rised, that the express stipulati-  
ons in the treaty of France with  
the United States would not ex-  
empt their commerce, at least,  
from the operation of any edict  
incompatible with them. At the  
  
date even of the latter orders of  
November ! 1, it appears that the  
oply aggression, which had then  
occurred, was pretty certainly  
unknown to the British govern-  
ment, and could therefore have  
had no share in producing this al-.  
leged retaliation.  
  
To the fact, that the case of  
the ship Horizon was the first  
that occurred, of an execution of  
the French decree on the high  
seas, I am able to add, that as late  
as the 30th of November, no other  
case had been brought into the  
French court of prizes. From  
accounts which have lately ap-  
peared, itis more than probable  
that unlawful captures by French |  
cruisers have since taken place ;  
but it remains to be known whie-  
ther they are to be referred to the  
concurrence of the French go-  
vernment in the judgment pro-  
nounced in the case of the Hori-  
zon, or not rather to a French de-  
cree of the 17th of December  
last, professing to be a retaliation  
on the British orders of Novem-  
ber 11.  
  
I state with equal confidence,  
that at no time have the United  
States acquiesced in violations of  
their neutral rights injurious to

that no time was lost, after the  
decree came to the knowledge of  
the government here, in giving  
him proper instructions on the  
subject; that he was equally  
prompt, on receiving the decision  
of the courtin the case of the  
Horison, in presenting to the  
French government a remon-  
strance in terms which never  
can be censured for a defect of  
energy; and that by the first op-  
portunity, after that decision  
reached the president the par-  
ticular instructions required by it  
were forwarded to that minister.  
Nor is it to be forgotten, that pre-  
vious to the British orders of No-  
vember, it had been explicitly  
communicated to the British go-  
vernment, by the -American mi-  
nister at London, that explana-  
tions, uncontradicted by any overt  
  
_act, had been given to our minis-  
  
ter at Paris, which justified a re-  
liance, that the French decree  
would not be put ia force against  
the United States; and that the  
communication was repeated to  
the British government immedi-  
  
ately on the publication of those »  
  
orders.  
  
What more could have been  
required on the part of the Unit-  
ed States, to obviate retaliating  
pretensions of any sort on the  
part of Great Britain: Retalia-  
tions are measures of rigor in all  
cases. Where they are to ope-  
rate through a third and involun-  
tary party, they will never be has-  
tily resorted to, bya magnanimous  
or a just power; which will al-  
ways allow to the third party, its  
right to discuss the merits of the  
case, and will never permit itself  
to enforce its measures without  
affording a reasonable time, for  
  
the use of reasonable means, for  
substituting another remedy.  
What would be the situation of  
neutral powers, if the first blow  
levelled through them by one bel-  
ligerent against another, was to  
leave them ne choice but between  
the retaliating vengeance of the  
latter, and an instant declaration  
of war against the former? Rea-  
son revolts at this, as the sole al-  
ternative. The United States  
could no more be bound to evade  
the British orders, by an immedi-  
ate war with France, thah they  
were bound to atone for the burn-  
ing of the French ship of war on  
the shore of North Carolina, by  
an immediate resort to arms a-  
guinst Great Britain.  
  
With respect to the principle  
assumed by the British orders, it  
is perfectly clear, that it could  
not justify them in the extent  
given to their operation, if the  
facts erroneously assumed could  
have been fully sustained.  
  
Retaliation is a specific or equi-  
valent return of injury, for inju-  
ry received; and where it is to  
operate through the interests of a  
third party, having no voluntary  
participation in the injury receiv-  
ed, the return ought, as already  
observed, to be inflicted with the  
most forbearing hand.  
  
This is the language of com-  
mon sense, and the clearest equi-  
ty. As the right to retaliate re-  
sults merely for the wrong suf-  
fered, it cannot in the nature of  
things, extend beyond the extent  
of the suffering. ‘There may of-  
ten be a difficulty in applying this  
rule with exactness, and a rea-  
sonable latitude may be allowable  
on that consideration. But a ma-  
nifest and extravagant departure  
from the rule ctn find no apology.

What then is the extent of the  
injury experienced by Great Bri-  
tain from the measures of her  
enemies, so far as the operation  
of those measures through the  
United States, can render them in  
any sense responsible ?  
  
A mere declaration by a belli-  
gerent, without the intention or  
the means te carry it into effect  
against the rights and obligations  
of a neutral nation, and thence a-  
gainst the interests of another bel-  
ligerent, could afford no pretext  
to the latter to retaliate at the ex-  
pense of the neutral. The de-  
claration might give just offence  
to the neutral, but it would be-  
long to him alone to decide on  
the course prescribed by the res-  
  
pect he owed to himself. No  
  
real damage, accruing to the bel-  
ligerent, no indemnity could ac-  
crue.  
  
For the same reason, a decla-  
ration of a belligerent which he is  
known to be either not in a situa-  
tion, or not to intend to carry, but  
partially, into execution against a  
neutral, to the injury of another  
belligerent, could never give more  
than a right to a commensurate  
tedress against the neutral. All  
remaining unexecuted, and eyi-  
dently notto be executed, is mere-  
ly ostensible ; working no injury  
to any, unless it be in the disres-  
pect to the neutral, to whom alone  
it belongs to resent or disregard  
it. Bring the case before us to  
this plain and equitable test. The  
French decree of November,  
1806, undertook to declare the  
British isles in a state of block-  
ade, to be enforced, if you please,  
against the neutral commerce of  
the United states, on the high  
seas, according to the faculty pos-  
sessed for the purpose, As far  
  
as it was actually enfouced, or ay  
effect resulted from an apprehen-  
sion that it could and would be  
enforced, it was an injury to Great  
Britain, for which, let it be sup-  
posed, the United States were  
answerable. On the other hand,  
as far as it was not enforced, and  
evidently either would not or  
  
could not be enforced, no injury J  
  
was experienced by Great Bni-  
tain, and no remedy could lie  
against the United States. Now,  
sir, it never was pretended that,  
at the date of the first British or-  
der, issued in January, 1807, any  
injury had accrued to, or was ap-  
prehended by Great Britain, from  
an execution of the French de-  
cree against the commerce of  
the United States, on the theatre  
of their neutral rights: so far  
from it, that the order stands self-  
condemned as a measure of reta-  
liation, by expressly stating that  
the fleets of France and her al-  
lies, instead of being able to en-  
force the blockade of the British  
isles, were themselves confined to  
their own ports, by the entire su-  
periority of the British navy:  
converting thus, by the strangest  
of reasonings, the security of  
Great Britain against injury from  
the French decree, into a title to  
commit injury on a neutral party.  
In the November orders also,  
whilst it is admitted that the  
French decree could not be but  
imperfectly executed, for want of  
means, it is asserted that the in-  
tention of the French decree, and  
not the injury-accruing from its  
operation through the commerce  
of the United States, is the scale  
by which the retaliating injury  
against them is to be measured.  
Such are the pretexts, and  
such the principles, on which one

great branch of the lawful com-  
merce of this country became a  
yictim-to the first British order,  
and on which the last orders are  
now sweeping from the ocean all  
its most valuable remains.  
  
Against such an unprecedented  
system of warfare on neutral  
rights, and national independence,  
the common judgment and com-  
mon feelings of mankind must  
forever protest.  
  
I touch, sir, with reluctance,  
the question, on which of the bel-  
ligerent sides the invasion of neu-  
iral rights had its origin. As the  
United States do not acquiesce in  
these invasions by either, there  
could be no plea for involving  
them in the controversy. But as  
the British orders have made the  
decree of France, declaring, con-  
trary to the law of nations, the  
British islands in a state of block-  
  
ade, the immediate foundation of  
  
their destructive warfare on our  
commerce, it belongs to the sub-  
ject to remind your government  
of the illegal interruptions and  
spoliations suffered, previous to  
that decree, by the neutral com-  
merce of the United States, un-  
der the proceedings of British  
cruizers and courts, and for the  
most part, in consequence of ex-  
press orders of the government  
itself. Omitting proofs of infe-  
rior note, I refer to the extensive  
aggressions on the trade of. the  
United States, founded on the  
plea of blockades never legally  
established according to recogni-  
zed definitions; to the sti!] more  
extensive violations of our com-  
merce, with ports of her enemies  
not pretended to be in a state of  
blockade ; and te the British or-  
der of council issued near the  
commencement of the existing  
  
war. This order, besides its ge-  
neral interpolation against the es-  
tablished law of nations, is distin-  
guished by a special ingredient,  
violating that law as recognized  
by the course of decisions in the  
British courts. It subjects to cap-  
ture and condemnation all neutral  
vessels, returning with lawful  
cargoes, on the sole considera-  
tion, that they had, in their out-  
ward voyage, deposited contra-  
band of war at a hostile port.  
  
If the commerce of the United  
States, could, therefore, in any  
case, be reasonably made the vic-  
tim and the sport of mutual char-  
ges and reproaches between bel-  
ligerent parties, with respect to  
the priority of their aggressions  
on neutral commerce, Great Bri-  
tain must look beyond the epoch  
she has chosen, for illegal acts of  
her adversary, in support of the  
allegation on which she founds  
her retaliating edicts against our  
commerce.  
  
But the United States are given  
to understand, that the British  
government has, as a proof of its  
indulgent and amicable disposi-  
tion towards them, mitigated the  
authorized rigor it might have  
given to its measures, by certain  
exceptions peculiarly favorable to  
the commercial interests of the  
United States.  
  
I forbear, sir, to express all the  
emetions with which such a lan-  
guage, on such an occasion, is  
calculated to inspire a nation  
which cannot for a moment be  
unconscious of its rights, nor mis-  
take, for an alleviation of wrongs,  
regulations, to admit the validity  
of which would be to assume  
badges of humiliation never worn  
by an independent power.

is acommercial intercourse with  
the dependencies of the enemies.  
of Great Britain, and it is consi-  
dered as enhanced by its being a  
deviation in favor of the United  
States, from the ancient and esta-  
blished principle of maritime law,  
prohibiting” altogether such an in-  
  
_tercourse in time of war.  
  
Surely, sir your government,  
in assuming this principle, in  
  
such terms, in relation to the  
  
United States, must have forgot-  
ten their repeated and formal pro-  
tests against it, as these are to be  
found in the discussions and com-  
maunications of their minister at  
London, © as well as in explana-  
tions occasionally made on that  
subject to the British representa-  
tive here. But permit me to ask  
more particularly, how it could  
  
have happened, that the principle  
  
is characterized as an ancient and  
established one? I put the ques-  
tion the more freely, because it  
has never been denied that the  
principle, as asserted by your go-  
¥vernment, was, for the first time,  
introduced during the war of  
1750. It is, in fact, invariably  
eited and described, in all judicial  
and other official transactions, “ as  
the rule of 1750.” It can have no  
pretension, therefore, to the title  
ef an ancient rule. |  
  
And instead of being an esta-  
blished rule or principle it is well  
known that Great Britain is the  
only nation that has acted upon,  
or otherwise given a sanction to  
it. Nay, itis not even an esta-  
blished principle in the practice  
of Great Britain herself. When  
first applied in the war of 1756,  
the legality ofa neutral trade with  
enemies colonies was not contest-  
ed by it. In certain cases only  
of the colonial trade, the allega-  
  
tion was, that the presumptive  
evidence arising from circum.  
stances, against the bona fide neu-  
trality of the ownership, justified  
the condemnation as of enemy’s  
property. If the rule of condem- §  
nation was afterwards, during that  
war, converted into the principle  
now asserted, it could not possi-  
bly have been in operation, in its  
new shape, more than a very few  
years. ~ During the succeeding  
war of 1778, itis admitted by eve-  
ry British authority, that the prin-  
ciple was never brought into ope-  
ration. It may be regarded, in  
fact, as having been silently aban-  
doned. And within the period of  
war, since its commencement in  
1793, the manner in which the  
principle has been alternately con-  
tracted and extended, explained |  
sometimes in one way, some-  
times in another, rested now on  
this foundation, now on that, is no  
secret to those who have attended  
to its history and progress in the  
British orders of council, and the  
British courts of admiralty.  
  
With the exception, therefore,  
of a period, the last in modern  
times from which authentic pre-  
cedents of maritime law will be  
drawn, and throughout which the  
United States, more interested in  
the question than any other na-  
tion, have uniformly combated the  
innovation, the principle has not  
in the British tribunals been in  
operation for a longer term than  
three, four, or five years, whilst  
in no others has it ever made its  
appearance but to receive a deci-  
sion protesting against it.”  
  
Such is the antiquity, and such  
the authority of a principle, the  
deviations from which are held  
out as so many favors consoling  
the United States for the wide

spread destruction of their legiti-  
mate commerce.  
  
What must be said as to the  
other exceptions which seem to  
have been viewed as claims on  
the gratitude of the United States?  
[s it an indulgence to them in car-  
rying on their trade with the  
whole continent of Europe, to he  
laid under the necessity of going  
first to a British port, to accept a  
British license, and to pay a ‘ri-  
bute to the British exchequer, as  
if we had been reduced to the co-  
lonial situation which once im-  
posed these monopolizing res-  
traints ?  
  
What again must be said as to  
the other features which we see  
blended on the face of these regu-  
lations? If the policy of them be  
to subject an enemy to privations,  
why are channels opened for a  
British trade with them which are  
  
_ghyt to a neutral trade? If, in  
  
other cases, the real object be to  
admit a neutral trade with the  
enemy, why is it required that  
neutral vessels shall perform the  
ceremony of passing through a  
British port, when it can have no  
imaginable effect but the known  
and inevitable one of prohibit-  
ing the admission of the trade in-  
to the port of destination ?  
  
I will not ask why a primary  
article of our productions and ex-  
ports, cotton-wool, is to be distin-  
guished, in its transit, by a heavy  
impost, not imposed on other ar-  
ticles, because it is frankly avow-  
ed, in your explanation of the or-  
ders, to be intended as an encou-  
ragement to British manufac-  
tures, and a check to the rival  
ones of France? I suppress, also,  
though without the same reason  
for it, the inquiry, why less rigo-  
vous restrictions are applied to  
  
the trade of the Barbary powers,  
than are enforced against that of  
a nation, such as the United  
States, and, in relations, such as  
have existed between them and  
Great Britain.  
  
I cannot, however, pass with-  
out notice the very unwarrantable  
innovations, contained in the two  
last of the orders. In one of them,  
a certificate of the local origin of  
  
~a cargo, although permittéd in  
  
the port of departure, and requir-  
ed in the port of destination, by  
regulations purely domestic in  
both, and strictly analagous in  
principle to regulations in the  
commercial code of Great Bri-  
tain, is made a cause of capture  
on the high seas, and of condem-  
nation in her maritime courts. In  
the other order, the sale of a mer-  
chant ship, by a belligerent owner  
to a neutral, although a transac-  
tion as legal, when fair, as a deal-  
ing in any other article, is cen-  
demned by a general rule, with-  
out an atom of proof, or of pre-  
sugoption, that the transfer in the  
particular case, is fraudelent, and  
the property, therefore, left in an  
enemy.  
  
In fine, sir, the president sees  
in the edicts communicated by  
you, facts assumed which did not  
exist ; principles asserted, which  
never can be admitted ; and, un-  
der the name of retaliation, mea-  
sures transcending the limits re-  
concilable with the facts and the  
principles, as if both were as cor-  
rect as they are unfounded. He  
sees, moreover, in the modifica-  
tions of this system, regulations,  
violating equally our neutral rights  
and our national sovereignty. He  
persuades himself, therefore, that  
your government will see in the

|„ time of peace. This an i :nt princi- &#x27;]hhr&lt;r  
&gt;f pie as asserted by the Br tlsh govern-   
~ ment was for the first time introduced in .  
lt the year 1756. It is invariably cited in Ju  
c all judicial decisions as the rule of re  
n 1756. Instead of being an ancient i st;  
. principle Great Britain is the only na- !ot  
X tion that has acted upon or otherwise |   
t given countenance to it. It is not |ov  
c even an established principle in the -  
. practice of G. Britain herself. When ,v  
. first applied in the year 1756, the lega- tr;  
j lity of a neutral trade with enemies co- 18  
c lonies was not contested by it. 1 wi  
. certain c ,ses only the allegation was jed  
_ that the presumptiv evidence, arising co  
. from circumstances against the bona tic  
&gt; fide neutrality of the ownership, justi- he  
. fied the coudemition of enemies pro. v  
5 perty. During the war of 1778 it is »&gt;  
! admitted by every Biilish authority rh  
. that the principle was never brought ed  
, into operation. It may be regarded .a&lt;l  
&#x27; in fact as having been rileidly ab ii- &gt;n  
. doned. And within the period of war &quot;(  
l since the commencement in 1793, the nu  
t manner in which the principle has to  
, been alternately contracted and ex- r  
f tended, explained sometimes in one &#x27;°t  
j way, sometimes in another, rested now the  
. on this foundation, now on that, is no r&gt;&quot;l  
t secret to those who have ;&gt;ttendcd to rel  
its history and progress in the British &#x27;  
.&#x27;orders of council and the British gri  
- j courts of admiralty. With the exec p. nation  
&#x27;■tion therefore ot a period the last in a^  
modern times from which authentic pre- rei  
: cedents of maritime law will be drawn, wi  
and thonghout which the United Suites, &#x27;  
more interested in the question than we  
any other nation, have uniformly com- let  
j batted the innovation, the principle has of  
n-d been in operation in the British tri- Cm  
bunuls for a longer period than three, he  
four, or five years, while In no other wit  
has it ever made its appearance but ha  
* to receive a decision ag list it. Such . tin  
is the antiquity and such the autho- j &#x27;  
rity of a principle the deviations ma  
from which are held out as so many !In

Such are the pretexts and such the  
\ priii which one great branch  
) of the lawful commerce of this conn­  
  
try became a victim to the first Bri- 1  
tish older, and on which the last or- t  
are now sweeping from the ocean  
all its most valuable remains.  
Against such an unprecedented! t  
m of warfafe on neutral rights &#x27;  
and national independence, the com- j  
mon judgment and common feelings I  
Eiikind must forever p(  
1 touch, sir, with reluctance  
question on which of the b&lt;  
the invasion of neutral rights had ;  
its origin. As the U. S. do not ac- •  
qtlicsce in these invasions by either, ■  
. could be no plea for involving !  
them in the controversy. But as the  
British orders have ma \$ the decree i  
nice, declaring, contrary to the \
law of of nations, the British islands in |  
te of blockade, the iinmi It  
lattoil of iheir destructive wat  
on our commerce, it belongs to

, commerce, Great Britain must look  
id the epoch she has chosen for  
| illegal acts of her adversary, in sup­  
-. allegation on which she  
tting edicts against  
| our commerce.  
But the U.Statesare given to tin­  
i derstand that the British government  
| has, as a proof of it* indulgent and  
! amicable disposition towards them,  
| mitigated the authorised rigor it might  
■ have givett to its measures, by certain  
exceptions peculiarly favorable to the  
imercial interests of the U. States.  
&quot;I forbtar, sir, to express all  
; emotions with which such aJangU  
|on such an occasion, is &#x27;d to  
inspire a nation which cannot for a  
tent be unconscious of its in  
nor mistake for an &#x27; allevi ti&gt;■&gt;  
wrongs regulations to admit the vali­  
of which would he to as  
humiliation never worn by  
Impendent power.  
The first of these indulgencies is a  
ial intercourse with the de­  
pendencies of ibe enemies of G. Bri­  
j tain, and it is considered as enhanced  
j by its being a deviation in favor of the  
!U. States from the ancient and esta­  
hed principle of maritime lowpro­  
j bibit r such an inter­  
».; in time of war.  
, sir, your government in  
assuming ibis principle in such terms  
in id U. S must have  
, fofgptten their repeated and form.-!  
protests against it, as ine-e are &#x27;o be  
, found iii the discussions and commu­  
; nidations oi&quot; their minister at London,  
j as well as in explanations occasionally  
I made on that subject to the British re  
i presentative here. But permit me to  
&#x27; ask, more particularly, how il could  
have happened that the principle is  
! characterised as an ancient and cstab­  
l.slu put the question the more  
ly, because it has never been de­  
• nied that the principle, as asserted by  
your government, was for the first  
! urnc introduced during the war ol  
j 1755. It is iv fact invariably cited and  
t described in all judicial and other offi­  
cial transactions &quot;asthe rule of 1756.&quot;  
It can have no pretension therefot  
the title of an ancient rule.  
And instead of being an established  
rule orpiin ;iple, it is well known that  
G. Britain is the only nation that has  
acted upon, or otherwise given a sanc­  
lo it. Nay, it is not even an esta­  
n the practice of G.  
Brii ; F. When first applied in  
| the war of 1756, the legality of a  
neutral trade with enemy&#x27;s co­  
lonies was not contested by it.  
In certain rases only of the colonial&#x27;  
trade, the allegation was, that the  
imptivc evidence arising from j  
circuins!. &quot;mst the bona lido I  
neutrality of the ©wjjership justified !  
enemy&#x27;s pro­  
perty. 1 rule of condemnation  
was after war, con- j  
rerti . principle now asserted, :  
it could in ily have been in ope­  
ration in its new shape, more than a  
very few years, During the succeed- ,  
ing war of 177 3, it is admitted by eve­  
ry British authority that the principle  
was never brought into operation. It i  
may be regarded, in fact, as having !  
i  
  
been silently abandoned ; and within J  
the period of war since its commence­  
mentin 1793, the manner in which the |  
principle has been alternately con- t  
tracted and extended,explained some- j  
. in one way, sometimes in ano- j ,  
thei-j rested now cm this foundation, J  
I now on that, is no secret lo those who 1  
■ have attei t» history and pro- l  
gress in the British order&#x27;- ofcoui  
and the British courts of admiralty.  
; With the exception, | of a  
• period, the last in modern times I&#x27;l  
j which authentic precedents of n  
! time law will be drawn, and thfou  
! out which the U. Stales mote i  
,&#x27; ested in the question than any i  
natii n, have uniformly combated the  
I innovation, the principle has not in  
I the British tribunals beenineperi  
for a lour&quot; nm three, four or  
&#x27; five years, whilst in no others 1.  
&#x27; ever made its :e but to re­  
. a decision protesting again  
ntiquity and such  
authority of a principle, the uevii  
i from win Id out as so many  
favors con  
wide spn iction of their legi- |  
j timale commerce.  
I What must be said as to the o  
I exceptions, which seem to hove been j  
. viewed ns claims on the gratitude of  
I the U. S. ? Is it ;ni indulgence to I  
I them in * • ade with ,  
the whole continent of Europe,  
i uderthe neceasitj . fust |  
to a British port, to accept a British !  
j licence and to pay a Iribute to the I  
; British Exchequer, as if we had been i  
i reduced to the Colonial situation1 which {  
imposed these monopolizing re- j  
its ?  
What again must be said as to other j  
I features which we sec blended on the &#x27;  
j face of these regulations ? If the i  
j policy of them be to subject an erie-  
Imy to privations, why are channels  
! opened for a British trad hem j  
I which are shut to a neutral Hade ? If  
jin other cases, the real object be to ■  
| admit a neutral trade with the enemy,  
! why is it required that neutral vessels I  
i shall perform the ceremony of pu  
I through a British port, when i  
| have no imaginable effect but the  
J known and inevitable one&quot; of prohibit- j  
1 ing the admission of che trade into the j  
port of destination ?  
I will not ask why a pri  
ol our productions and exports, cot- j  
ton wool, is to be distinguished, in its  
transit, by a heavy impost not impos- j  
ed on Other tfr odes, because it is |  
frankly avowed, in your explanation of j  
.i an en- j  
I couragement to British manufactures, J  
and a check to the I  
Prance ? I suppress also, (hi  
I without the same reason fur it, tin  
quiry, why less rigorous restrictions j

Whatever-had been done to her, through an

si authorised that the express stipulation in the

not exempt their commerce at least from the  
Operation of any edict inccmpatible sswit-h

aggreesion which &quot;had then occurred, was  
pretty certainly unknown to the British go­

To this fact that the ship Horizon wasss

to add that as late as the SOth of November, —  
no other cause had been &#x27;brought into the  
French court of prctizsies. From account-5.  
which have lately appeared, it is no more  
than _probahle that unlawful captures bv  
French cruizers have since taken place, but  
it remains to be known whether they are to  
be referred to the mneurrence ofthe French

ss I state v ith equal confidence, that at no &#x27;  
time have the United Stutes acquiesced in .

Great Britain, or an) other belii gerent

-.* si With respect to the principle asSUmed by  
the British orders,. it is peHectly clear that  
it enuld not justify them in the extent git en  
totheir operation, is the facts, erroneously  
ss&#x27; sidsisssiumed, could have been fully sustained  
Retaliation rs a specific or equivalent re­  
(tum &#x27;of injury for injury received; and  
- Where it is to operate through the interests  
(if-a third Party having no voluntary partici—  
_ tion in the injury received, the retuin  
on ht, as already observed, to be in ﬂicted  
the await forbearing hand.  
&quot;This is the language of common sense  
and-the clearest equity. As the right to  
s&#x27;retaltate results merely from the wrong suf­  
si &#x27; it cannot in the nature of things ex­  
&quot;yond the extent of the suﬀering.—  
may often be a difficulty in applving  
  
  
  
lm But a manife&#x27;st and extravagant de­  
partisslre fromct the rule can find no apolo&#x27;g).  
What then Is the extent of the mjur v ex­  
perienced by G. Britain from the measures  
of her enemies so far as the Operation of  
those measures through the United States­  
KZM render them in any-sense sire3ponsi­

A mere declaration by a be iigerent, with­  
earthe intentiOn or the means to carry it in­  
to eﬀect,a againSt the rights and obligatiOns  
of a neusitral nation, and thence against the j  
int-steps- of another belligerent, could aﬀord  
In prCiext to sithe latter to retaliate at the ex­  
nee of the neutral. The declaration might  
Eve just oﬀence to the neutral, but it would  
long to him alone to decide on the course  
Wenhed by the respect he owed to him­  
self- No real damage hat mo&#x27; accrued to  
the belligerent, no indemnity could accrue.  
ct For the same reason, a declamtion of a  
belligectrssent which he 13 known to be either  
  
nofi&#x27;in &amp; Situation. or not to intend, to carry  
but parfially into execution against a ueutra], ss  
to the injury of another belligcrent, could  
ctiisievet give more than a right to commensu­  
ratel&#x27;ss dress against theo ncutraif All re­  
  
. &quot;V.  
  
unfiiccuted and ev idei. dy not to be  
executed,- is merely osistensible, working no  
injury to any, unless It. be m the disrespect  
  
  
to the neutrzd, to w..o:n alone it beiongs to .  
  
&amp;sent or dis-regard it.  
Bring the case before us to this pliiin and  
equitable test. Tsihe French decree of No­  
vembck&#x27;, 1806, undertook to de ciaie the  
British isies in &amp; state of blocknde, to be sin­  
forced it y ou please against the ncuti al com­  
mcteme of the U. Statts on the high seaz, ac­  
tebrding to the faculty possessed for the Pht­  
ae. As far as it was actually enforced or  
An eﬀect resulted from an apprehcnsion that  
&quot;it come and would be enforced, it was ,.  
injury to Great Britain, for which let it be  
  
duppﬂsed the U States were answerahlc.—- *  
  
On the other hand, as far as it was not en­  
forced, &quot;and etidently either would not or  
in:-Would not be enforcetl, no injury was expe -  
rienced by G. Britain, and no remedv could

rmptetended that at the date of the  
W Brifish order issued In January, 1807,  
Mary rysshadsisi accrned to, or was appre­  
ended frOm G. Bt&#x27;itain by an eXecutionss of  
tle French decree against the commerce of  
the U. States, on the theatre of their neu­  
pil rights. So far from it,: that the order  
ct self condemned as anieasure of reta­  
this, by expffissly stsiating that the fieets

sides in general interpolation agaitzsLt the e­  
stablished law of nations, is distinguished ;  
by&#x27;a special ingredient violating that law as  
recognised by the course of decisions in the ss  
British courts. It subjects to capture and  
cossndemnation all neutral vessels, returning  
With lawful cargoes, on the sole considera­  
tion, that they had in their outWard thy-age,  
depositedsi&#x27; contraband of war at asisi hostiic ct

made the victim and the sport of mutual &#x27;  
charges and reproarhcs between beliigercnt  
parties, with respect to the-prmrityof their  
aggrcssisicns on neutral commerce, (). Britain ,  
must look be&#x27;y&#x27;siond the epoc—h she has chosen  
for illegal acts of her adversary, in support ss  
of the allegation on which she founds her ss  
retaliating edicus against our c&#x27;o&#x27;mmerce. !  
Butthe United States are given to under-. l  
stand that the British government has, as 3 4  
proof of its indulgent :mssd aniicabie disposi- i  
tion towards them, mitigated the authorised  
rigor it might have given to its measures, ,  
by certain exceptions peculiarlyfavorable&#x27;to 1  
  
. . , ,. . ss ct !  
the commercxal interests of the U. States. ?  
  
I forbear, sir, to express ail the emotions ;  
with which such a language, on such an oc- ss  
  
casion, is calculatt-d to inspire a nation  
which cannot for &amp; nssroment be unconscious  
of its rights, nor&quot; mistake for an aileviution  
of wrongs regulations to admit she validity  
of which would be to assume baclgcs of hu­  
niiliation ne ver worn by an independent  
power.  
  
The first of these inclulgencies is &amp; com- ;  
  
mercial intercourse with the dependeneics  
of the enemies of Great-Britain, and It is  
  
ss considered as enhanced by its being a devi­

&#x27; ing this principle in such ternsi : in reiatction&#x27;

I will not Ask why &amp; primary artich: of  
  
&#x27; our productions and exports, cottcn wool,  
  
is to be distinguished, in its transit, by a  
  
&quot;heavy impost, not imposcd on other arti­  
  
cles, because it is srunklyavowed, in your  
explanation of the orders, to be intended  
as an encourugcim-nt to Britishssmanufac­  
tures., and :: check to the rival ones of  
France. I suppress also, though without  
the same reason for it, the enquhy, why  
l&#x27;css rigorou&#x27;s re. strictions are applied to the  
tisi&#x27;nde of the B-sssitrlimy powers than are en­  
forced against that ofa nation, such as the  
Unitcd Siil&#x27;tsscS, and in relations such as have  
existed between them and Great-Britain.  
I cannot how c-rssir pass without notice the&quot;  
very utwnrrnntablc itsiino&#x27;vation contained in  
the two last of the orders._ ln one of them  
a ccrti&#x27;licatctc of the local origin of a curgo,  
altho&#x27; permitted in the }-0rt of departure  
and required in the port otdcrsstinationss by  
regulations purcly domestic in both, and,  
strictly annlogous inprineiple to the regular-e  
tions in the commerciul ende of G. Britain,  
is. made a cause of capturess on the high seus,  
and of condemnation in hcrmaritime courts.  
  
In the othtr order the sale of a merchant-t  
  
ship by a belligercnt owner to &amp; neutml. ul­  
thongh a transactisson as legal when fair, as a  
dealing in any other ::rticlc. is condemned  
by a. general rule, siwissthoutct an atom of proof

ing poweis on the continent of Kuiupe choose to

productions, or neutral vuserls plot etmng Iroin In  
tish ports, it is an art ol sovereignty which ih, t -  
oit.-d Bl.ues have no right to controvert. The s.ur.e  
sovereignty is exercised by Gieat Britain at all  
tlines, lit peace as wtjl as m war, towaufs her  
inemls as well as her enemies. Her statute hook  
presents a thousand illustration?.  
li is only,.therefore, under the other aspect of the  
dccieP, that’ it ran h&#x27;nvp sedated neutral rights ; and  
this would* have residual liin Us exertufdu mi the  
high seas, whether on the pretext ol a nominal  
blockade, or with a view to emorre a domestic regu­  
lati&#x27;on against foreign vessels,’ not within the&#x27;domes­  
tie precincts, hnWndrr the aulhofuy and pidttetion  
ol the law of nation?.  
  
Had ti»m the ii**nrh decree been eXef uted on li e  
1‘ig&#x27;i sens against the romnTt-rce hi the L&#x27;fliteil Stiles  
with Great Britain# and have the United States «c­  
(jui»seeil inr the. unlawful and injurious proceeding?  
I stale, sir, on undeniable authority tout the first  
instance in which tout decree was put :n (dree against  
the neutral rights ol the United States, was that ot  
the Horizon, an American ship bound from Greal­  
Uiitrtin to Li mi, wrecked within the territorial ju­  
risdiction ol iranee, but condemned under an expo­  
sition ol the decree extending to the high seas its o­  
peration against neutrals. This judicial decision  
took place as late as the 10&#x27;th day ol October lbOjL  
and was not officially know n to the minister plenipo­  
tentiary ot the L imed Stales at Baris, till some time  
in November. AljfeJkte therefore of the hist or­  
der o! Great iiritair^io injury whatever had lyn  
done to her, through an aggression on tile com­  
merce ot the United States. &#x27; No piesumption even  
had been sufficiently authorized that the express sti­  
pulation in the treaty of France with the United  
States would not exempt their commerce at lease  
irom the operatidn of tiny edict incompatible with  
thefn. At the date even ^f the latter outers ol No­  
vember 11, it appears thut the only aggression  
which had then occurred, was pretty certainly un­  
known to the British government, aud could tnere­  
fore have had no share tu producing this ulb dgul re­  
taliation.  
To this fact that the ship Horizon was the first  
that occurred ol an execution of the Freuch decree  
on the high seas, I am able to add that as lute gr  
the 30lh of November, tm other case had bccu bro’t  
into tbe Fj^nch; court of prnes. From accounts

Wth resjVctto the principle assumed hy tlie Bri­  
tis&#x27;i orders, it is perfectly clear that it could nut jus*  
tify them in li e exteht ufven to tl.eir operation, if  
flic ! ids, i rroneuualy assumed, could .have been luf­  
1_&lt;* sustained.  
Ketallirlion is a specific k or cqiiivafcnt return of  
injury tor injury received; apd where it is to opcr  
rate through the inn-rests of a third patty having nO  
vohmiary participation fn the injury lefeived, the  
relurh ought, as already observed, to be inflicted  
with the most forbearing Iwnd.  
Ti is is&#x27; the language of common sense and the  
clearest equity. As the right to retaliate results  
nierdy irom the wrong sutured, it cannot, in the  
nature &lt;•( thitler, extend beyond tbe extent of the  
suffering. There rnay often he a difficulty jn apply­

a manifest and extrav. g.mt departure from the rule,  
can lind no apology. 1  
df l.at then is liie extent of the injury experienced  
by GrP&#x27;a&#x27;t BiitJtin from tlie measures of her enemies  
so far as tbe operation r.f those measures through the  
Ln’iied■Stales can render them in any sense respon­  
sible?  
  
A mere df l tir.linn 1»y a belligerent, without the  
inteiutVii&#x27;or iiie means to carry it into effect, against  
&#x27;ilia rights P.nd ohlig.ilions of a ntu’.rp.l nation, and  
tbcnce against lli^iiiterests qf another belligerent,  
rntiM afford no pretext to the latter to retaliate at  
the expence of thgj_ieutraj. The declaration might  
give just oiTtuK e u||^he neutral, but it would belong  
to hint alone to nmiie on the course prescribed by  
the respect Ire o\t»d to himself. No real damage  
haying accrued to the belligerent, no indemnity could  
acciue.  
For the same reason, a declaration of a belligerent  
w hich he is known to be either not m a situation,.or  
not to intend, to carry hut partially into execution  
■ HjjuVnst a neutral, to the lujury uf another beljige­  
« «!n», could never give tm&gt;rc than a right to a com­  
i no n=urate redress against.the neutral. All renoain­  
ng unexecuted, and evidently apt to be executed*,  
; is merely ostensible, working no injury to any, un­  
less it be in thedisrespect to the neutral, to whom it  
alone belongs to resent or disregard it.  
Bung the rase before us to this plain and equita­  
ble Us:. The French deci.-e uf November, I80f&gt;,  
undertook to de. hue the Billiefi isles in a Stale of  
blockade, to be Ptdoiced.il you please ugaiust the  
neul.al commerce of the Foiled States on the high  
Spas, accordtng to the faruljy possessed for the pur­  
pose. As far as it was actually eulufced, or an ef­  
fect resulted from an apprehension that it could and  
would be enforced, it was an injury to Great Britain, „  
&#x27;•or which let it he supposed the UcileikSuies wtrj  
I auswerable. On the othe other baud,&#x27; as fair at il.

was not enforced, and evidently either would not or  
enukl not be enforced, no injury was experienced by  
Great-Britain, and no remedy could lie against the  
United States. Now, sir, it orver was pietendcd  
that at the date of the lirat British order, issued in  
January, 1807, any injury Imd accrued to, or was  
apprehended by Great-Britain liom an execution of  
the French decree against the commerce of the Uni­  
ted States, on the theatre of their neutral rights.—  
So far from it, that the ord-r stands sell condemned  
as a measure of retaliation, by e.ipreasly staling  
that the fleets of France and her ; Hies, instead ol  
being able t« enforce the blockade of the British j  
isles, were themselves confined to theii own pons by  
the entire superiority of the British navy : concert  
iog thus, by the strangest ufreasonings, the sc, ui ity  
of Greal-Britam against injury from the Ficn h de­  
cree, into a title to commit injury on a neutral par­  
ty. lu the November orders also, whilst U is ad­  
mitted that the French decree could not be out im­  
perfectly executed for want of means, it is asserted  
that the intention of the French decr c, ami n d the  
injury accruing from its operation through the rum­  
merce &lt;&gt;i the United State*, 11 the scale by which  
the retaliating njury against them is to he measured.  
Such are the pr&gt; texts and such the principles on  
which one great iranch of the lawful commerce ol  
this country became a victim to the first lintisb or­  
der, and on whir h the last orders are now sweeping  
from theorem) all its most valuable re mnrr.  
Against such an unprecedented system ut warfare  
On neutral rights and national independence the  
common judgment and common feelings of inan­  
Jjnd must forever protest.  
  
I touch, sir, will) reluctance the question on  
which of the belligerent sides the incision o! neu­  
tral right* had it* oiigm. As the United Stales do  
Out acquiesce in these invasions t.y etthei, there  
Could be no plea lor involving them in the • ntro­  
versy. But «s the British orders have made the dr­  
cree of France, declaring, contrary to the law ot n.e­  
tions, the Britisti islands in a state.iii blockade, ttie

of the United States, found, d on the pica ol luck­  
odes, nrver legally established mC- didine to |r-ognt­

United States could, therefore, n any ,se, lie rea­  
sonably made the vi inn and tin: sport ot muta.ii

with r -it to tii. priority of then aggressions on

Hie epocji which wie lias chosen lor illegal arts ot  
bn adversary, in support f the dlegation on whirl,  
the founds her retaliating edicts against our com­  
merce.  
But the Ur.&#x27;ted Stnt“s ate given to understand  
that the Bn. government has, as a proof of its  
indulgent an- amirahle &#x27;4-«positi«rn towards them,  
ntltig-.leil the aui boriS&#x27;-d r.gour il might have given  
to its measures, by cm ,.t- i exceptions peciiii-.rly la­  
vourable to the comm r nil interests ot the United  
States.  
I forbear, sir, to express all the emotions with  
whirhsurh u h,;.gunge, on such an occasion, is cal- j  
rulated to in- .ore a nation wlnrh cannot lor a mo­  
ment be twcnvjfi&#x27;.m* of its ng is. nor mistake for  
•n alleviation of wrongs, regnl.-U nns to admit the  
Validity of which would he to .. some badges of hu­  
miliation never worn hy ou inurpenocnt power.  
The first of these indulgence* is a commercial  
intercourse with the dependen. ies of the enemies  
of Great-Britain, and it is considered as enhanced i  
by Us being a deviation in favour of tin- Uaited1  
States Irum ihr a/icuat and --uhhsbed principle of  
maritime law, prohibiting altogether such an inter­  
course in time of war.  
  
surely, sir, your goverainent in assuming this  
principle in such terms in relation to the United  
States, must have forgotten tiieir repented mill lor­  
nnl protests against it, .&lt;s these are lobe I nun a in the  
discussions mid communications of their minister at  
London, as well as in explanations occasionally made  
on that subject to ti e lit it iai) representative here.  
But perini&#x27; me to ask, more pariirnlailv, how it  
could have happened thut ti e principle is character­  
ised as an ancient and estublista-d one. I pot the  
question t^e more freely, btr use it never has been  
dented that the principle, as asserted by your gov­  
ernment, was for the lirst time introduced during the  
war of 1756. It is in fact invariably cited and des­  
cribed in nil jndlrial and other ottirial transactions  
“ as the rule of 1750&#x27;.” It c m have no pretension  
therefoie to the title of an ancitnt rule.  
And instead of being an established rule or prin­  
ciple. it is well known that GreuBnt.iin is the on­  
ly nation that has acted upon, hif%therwise given .1  
sanction to it. Nay, it is not even an established  
psinciplein the practice of Great Britain herself,  
V ben first applied in the wai of 1750&#x27;. the figa/rfy ot  
• neutial Irarle will- enemy’s colonies whs not con­  
tested bv 1. In certain rases only of the colonial  
trade, the allegation was, that the presumptive evi­  
dence arsing from circumstances against the bona  
tide neutrality ofthe iwm rsnip justified the condem­  
nation es of enemy&#x27;s properly, ll the rule of con­  
demn it 1 n was afterwards, during that war, conver­  
ted into the principle now asserted, it could not pos­  
sibly have been in operation in its new shape, more  
thar.i: v»ry few years. During the succeeding war  
of 1773, it is rduntted by every British authority  
thut the principle was never brought into operation.  
It may bv leoarded, in fact, as having been silently  
aba Mooed; alia within the period of war since its  
commencement in 1799. the manner in which th«  
pr .neiple has been alternately contracted add ex­  
truded, explained sometimes in one way. sometimes  
iii another, rested now on this foundation, now on  
that, is no secret to those who have attended to its  
history and progress in the British orders of coau­  
Cil sud Ike British courts of admiralty.  
  
With the exception, therefore, of a period, th«  
last in modern times Irom which authentic prece­  
dents of maritime law will he drawn, and through­  
out which the United States more interested in the  
question tnaiiaoy oilier nation,have uniformly ruin*  
haled the innovation, the principle lias not in the  
British tribunals oeeu in opeiation fora longer term  
than three, four or live years, whilst in no others  
has it ever made its appearance butto receive a deri­  
sion protesting against it.  
Such is the antiquity and such the authority of a  
principle, the deviations from which ale held out as  
so many favors consoling the United States lor thr  
wide spread dcsliuctiun of their legitimate com­  
merce.  
What must, he said as to the other exceptions,  
which beem to hare been viewed as claims on ttie  
gratitude of the United States? Is it an indulgence  
to them in carrying on their trade with the whole  
continent of Europe, to be laid under the necessity  
ol going first to a British port, to accept a British  
licence and to pay a tribute to the British Exche­  
quer, as il we had been reduced to the colonial situ­  
ation which once imposed these monopolizing rea­  
tranils ?  
\\ hut again must he suidas toother features which  
we see blinded on the face of these regulations? If  
the policy of them e t&lt;&gt; soldi &lt; t an enemy to priva­  
tions, why are channels opened lot a British trade  
with tin m which are slint to a neutral trade ? !l

In tlic Nat Int. the sub**’|ucnt letter fol­  
lows Mr. Cunning’s better published in our  
lust.  
from the Secretary of State to Mr. ErrKine.  
SIR,  
Department of Statk, 7  
s March 25, 1608. $  
Having laid before the President yonr let­  
ter of the 23d of February, explaining the  
character of certain British orders of coun­  
cil issued in November last, I procv cd to com­  
municate the observations and representati­  
ons which will manifest to your government  
the sentiments of the President on so deep a  
violation of the commerce and rights of the  
’U. States. »  
Tlieso orders interdict to neutral nations-,  
or rather to the United States, now the only  
commercial nation in a state of neutrality,  
all commerce with the enemies of G. Britain,  
now nearly the whole commercial world,  
with certain exceptions only, and under cer­  
tain regulations, but too evidently IftcfTioned  
to the commercial, the WtynufapCuring and  
the fiscal policy of Great Britain ; and on  
that account, the more derogatory from the  
lionsr and independence of neutral nations.  
The orders? are the more calculated to  
excite surprise in the United States as they  
have disregarded the remonstrances convey­  
ed in my tetters of the 20th and 29th March,  
3307, against another order of council issued  
on a similar plea, in the month of January,  
3807. To those just remonstrances, no an­  
swer was indeed ever given-; whilst the or­  
der has been continued in its pernicious ope­  
ration against- dtc lawful commerce of the  
W. States, and wc now find added to it others  
instituting siici mure j ui»u..:-. depredation:  
without even the addition of any new pre­  
text, and when.iuoreover it is notorious, that  
the order cf January Was of a nature greatly !  
to overbalance in its effects any injuries to  
Great Britain that could-be apprehended!  
from the illcgal/iperntion of the French de­  
cree on which the order was to retaliate, had  
that decree in its illegal operation been actu­  
ally applied to the U. States, and been acqui­  
esced in by them.  
The last orders, like that of January, pro­  
ceed on the most unsubstantial foundation —  
They assume for fact an acquiescence of the  
United States in an unlawful application to  
them of the French decree ; and they assume  
for a principle that the right of retaliation  
accruing to one belligerent against a neutral  
through whom an injury is done by another  
belligerent, is not to have for its measure  
that of the injury received, but may be exer­  
cised in any extent, and under any modifi­  
cations which may suit the pleasure or the  
policy of the complaining party.  
The fact, sir, is unequivocally disowned. I  
It is not true that the United States have ac- I  
quiesced in an illegal operation of the French j  
decree; nor is it even true that at the date I  
of the British orders - f November 11, a sin- j  
gle application of that decree to tli© . com­  
merce of the United States on the high seas ;  
can be presumed to have been known to the  
British government.  
The French decree in question has two  
distinct aspects, one clearly importing an in­  
tended operation within the territorial limits  
as a local law, the other apparently impor­  
ting an intended operation on the high seas.  
Under the first aspect, the decree, howe­  
ver otherwise objectionable, cannot be- said  
tohave t minted the neutrality of the (J.S.  
If the governing powers on the continent of  
Europe choose to exclude from their ports  
British property or British productions, or  
neutral vessels proceeding from British ports,  
it is an act of sovereignty which the United  
States have no right to controvert. The same  
sovereignty is exercised by Great Britain at  
all times, in peace as well as in war, to­  
wards her friends as well as her enemies.  
Her statute book presents a thousand illus­  
  
trr.tjons.  
It is only, therefore, under the other as­  
pect of tl»e decree, that it can have violated  
neutral rights : and this would have result­  
ed from its execution, on the high seas, whe­  
ther on the pretext of a nominal blockade,  
or with a view to enforce a domestic regu­  
lation against foreign vessels, net within the  
domestic precincts, hut under the authority  
and protection of the. law of nations. Had  
thwn the French decree been executed on the  
high seas against the commerce of the TV  
States with Great Britain, and have the U.  
States acquiesced in the unlawful and inju­  
rious proceeding ?  
I state, sir, on undeniable authority that  
the first instance in which that decree was  
put in force against the neutral rights of the  
United State®, was fh it of the Horizon, an  
American ship bourn} from Great Britain to  
Lima, wrecked within the territorial juris­  
diction of France, hut condemned under on  
exposition ef the decree extending to the  
high seas 1t:&lt; opcvurhnt against nesYtrals._  
&#x27;l itis judicial decision t«x&gt;k j&gt;l trr» late as  
the 10th day of October-, l*-07, id was not  
officially known to the minister plenipoten­  
tiary of the United States at Paris, till some  
time in November. At the date therefore of  
the first order of Great Britain, no infhry  
whatever had been done toiler, through nil  
aggression on ihe&#x27;comnit&#x27;rce of tiie U. States.  
Ns presumption • von had been sufficiently  
authorized that U«e Ocpressssipnlatirn in tin!  
treaty of France with the U. States vvenld  
not exempt their commerce it least from the  
operation «&gt;f aitv edit r inrnmpntible wi &#x27;,i  
them. A&#x27; • iitr dftte even ni* the latter orders  
of November IT, it &#x27;*p, ears that the only ag­  
gression which bad then rCCurt&#x27;d, was pret­  
ty certainly unknown to tb*- llt-iiisli goveni­  
tnent, fk Could »hen*(&#x27; ,.*• bs-c had no share io  
producing this aiicdgcd rcsdiatltn.  
To this fsrt that the - hip&#x27; Horizon was the  
first that occurred of an execution of the  
French decree en the high - cas; I am able  
to add that as lute as tin* . tali o* November,  
no other ca o hart been brought into the  
French&quot; court of prize&#x27;;. From act omits which  
have lately npm ired, it. i, pjort* than ;»ro­  
bab&#x27;e that nnla wl&#x27;nl c.iptflres !,v I re.:ir.1i crui­  
sers have since taVon pi ice, hot it remains  
te be known whet) &lt; rthey a e tohe referred  
to tlie concurrence oftiie French government  
ill the judgement pronounced in the ca y of  
the Ilorizcn, ortid tatlu rtor French decree  
of the JT&#x27;.li December in&lt;tt prufessing to be a  
retaliation on Lite Iliiiish orders of Novetu­  
ber 11.  
  
I state with **qiial confidence, that at no  
time have the United Stiites acquiesced in  
violations of tiudr neutral rights injurious to  
Great Hritain, or ary other beiljfjerent na­  
tion. So far were thev, in pnrtiralar, from  
acqnie®&#x27;’;.&quot; r |n tlieFrein&#x27;.h decree of Novem­  
ber, lKuf&gt;, that the mni.-.i it. &lt;••-» Icr&#x27;-wn to  
their mm ster at I^ns, he called forexpet­  
tiatiosa of its meaning in relation to the U.  
States, v. hieh wore favorable, and uncontra­  
AicteUo/ &lt;u» ac-iuai operation of the dec re* ;  
  
that he s*ecdily watched over the proceed-|  
irjis ujic’ter it, with a rcad&#x27;mess to interpose  
against any unlawful extension of them to  
the commerce of the U. States; that hotline  
was lost, after the decree caine *p the know­  
ledge of the government here, in giving him  
proper instructions on the subject ; that hr  
was equally prompt, cn receiving the decision  
of the court in the case of the Horizon, in  
presenting to the French government u re*  
monstrance in terms which can never hr  
censured fora defect of energy ; and that by  
the first opportunity after that decision reach­  
ed the President, the particular instructions  
I required hy it were forwarded to that mini  
ster. Nor is it to he forgot;*;-, that prevbrtS  
to the British orders of November, it had  
been explicitlyoommurtlnatcd to the British  
.government hv the .&lt;*ericnn minister.at Lon­  
don, that e:&lt;pianafrons uncontradicted bv any  
overt art had been given to our minister at  
j Paris, whi^i justifies a reliance that the  
I French decree would not he put in force a­  
j gaii*i*f the United States, and that the com­  
| n*&quot;tmcaticm was repeated to the P#ritish go­  
| vernment immediately on the publication ut  
I these ordefn.  
\Vliat more con’d have been required on  
| the part of the U. States, to obviate retnl.a­  
| ting pretensions ol any sort on the part, of G.  
Britain ? Rataliations are measures of rigor  
in all cases. Where they are to operate  
tiirough a third add involuntary party, they  
will never be hastily resorted to by a n».«q­  
j nanimous or a just power ; which will always  
I allow to the third party its right to discuss  
! the merits of the case and will never permit  
itselt to enforce its measures, without afford­  
ing a reasonable time for the use of reasona­  
ble means for substituting another remrilv.  
VVh.it would be the situation of neutral pow­  
ers. if the first blow levelled through them,  
by one belligerent against another, was to  
ICit*.&#x27;C them &quot;0 choice SpIw—,*h the rcta­  
liating vengeafsce of the latter and instant de­  
claration oi war against the former? Reason  
revolts against that as the sole alternative.  
Thfc United States could, no more be bftund  
to evaded’.* British orders by an immediate  
war with* France than tliev were bound to  
atone for the burning of the French ship of  
war on the shore of North Carolina., br an  
immediate r esort to arms against Great Bri­  
tain.  
With respect to the principle assumed by  
the British orders, it is perfectly clear that  
it could not justify them in the extent given  
to their operations, if the facts, erroneously  
assumed, could have been fully sustained.  
Retaliation is a specific or equivalent re­  
turn of injury for injury received ; Sc where it  
is tqoperate thro’ the interests of a 3d party  
having no volmi&#x27;ary participation in the in­  
jury received, the return ought, as already  
observed, to be inflicted with the m^st for­  
bearing hand. This is the language of com  
mon sense andtho clearest equity. As the  
right to retaliate results merely from the  
wrong suffered, it cannot in the nature of  
things extend beyond the extent &gt;&gt;frhe suf­  
fering. There may often be a difficulty in  
applying the rule with exactness, and a&#x27;rea­  
sonable latitude may be allowable on that  
consideration. But a manifest and extrava­  
vant departure from the vale can liwcl no a­  
pology.  
VVliat then is the extent of the injury ex  
pcricnced by Great-Britain from the mea­  
sures of her enemies, so far as the operati­  
on of those measures through the United  
States can render them in anv sense respon­  
sible ?  
  
A meYe declaration by a belligerent, with­  
out the intention or the means to carry it in­  
to effect, against the rights and cbligations  
ot a neutras nation, and thence against the  
interests of another beHigerent, could afford  
no pretext to the latter to retaliate at the  
expence of the neutral. The declaration  
might give iust offence to the neutral, but  
it would belong to him alone todecidc on the  
course prescribed by the respect he owed to  
himself. No real damage having accrued to  
the belligerent, no indemnity could accrue.  
For the same reason, a declaration of a  
belligerent which Ire is known to he either  
not in h situation, or not to intend, to carry  
but partially into execution against a neutral  
to the injury of another belligerent, could ne­  
ver give more than a right to a commensu­  
rate redress against the neutral. All re­  
maining unexecuted and evidently not to be  
executed, is merely ostensible, working no  
injury to ahv unless it be in the disrespect to  
the neutral, to whom alone it belongs to re­  
sent or disregard it.  
- Bring the case before its to this plain and  
equitable te«t. The French Decree of Nov.  
IB06, undertook to declare the British isles  
in a state of blockade, to be enforced if you  
please against the neutral commerce of the  
United States on the high seas, according to  
tilt Faculty possessed for the purpose. As  
far as was actually enforced, or an effect  
resulted bom an apprehlnsjon that it could  
and wo&gt;&lt;id he enforced, it was an injury to  
Grcat-1 itahi, for which let it be supposed  
the United States were answerable. Outlie  
other hand, as far ns it was not enforced,  
and evidently either would net or could not  
be enforced, no injury was experienced by  
Great-Britain, and no remedy could iie a­  
guinst the United States. Now. Sir, it ne­  
ver was pretended that at the date of the  
first British Order issued in January, IBOf,  
any if.jury had accrued to, or was appre­  
hended by Great-Britain from an execution  
of the French Decree against the commerce  
of the United States, on the theatre of their  
neutral right*. So far from it, that the or­  
der stands self-ccndeinned as a measure of  
retaliation, by expressly stating that the  
fleets of France and her allies, instead of  
being able to enforce the blockade of the Bi i­  
tish Isles, were themselves confined to their  
own uorts by the entire superiority of the  
British navy : r,-averting thus by the stran­  
ge of reisoninus, the security of Great­  
Britain against injury from the r’&quot;ench de­  
cree, into a title to commit injti * n a neu­  
tral party. In the Novemiw-r orders also,  
whilst ?t is admitted that thd French decree  
rou’d not be but Imnerfectlv executed for  
want of means, it. is asserted that tin inten­  
tion of the French decree, and not the inju­  
ry accruing from its operation through the  
commerce of the United States, is the. scale  
bv which the retaliating injury against them  
is to be measured.  
  
Such ore the pretexts and such the prin­  
ciples on which one ftreat brunch of the law­  
ful commerce f this country became a vic­  
tim to the first Hf itish order, uml on which  
the lust orders ar* now sweeping from the o­  
cer.n all its most valuable remains.  
Against such an unprecedented system of  
warfare on neutral rights and national iride­  
pendcttcc, the common judgment and Com­  
mon feedings of mankind mtist forever pro­  
test.  
I touch, fiir, with reluctance1, th*&#x27; fjuestion  
on which of the bcligcrent sides the invasion  
of neutral rights had its origin. As the U  
S. do n.‘. acquiesce in these invasions by ei­  
  
ther, there .cc drt he no plea for &#x27;involving &gt;  
then in the controversy. * lint as fhe British  
| orders have Uia.de the decree of *&#x27;ranee, de­  
claring. contrary to die law of nations, the  
British Islands in a Mate of blockade, the&quot;  
immediate foundation ,of their destructive  
warfare on our commerce, it belongs to the  
subject to re&#x27;iiiind your government of the iU  
legal intrmptinmtmml spoliations suffered,  
previous to tnat decree, by the neutral com­  
merce of the United States, under the pB»  
ceedings of British cruisers and courts, and  
for the most part In cuusequence of express  
• orders of tH* government itself. Omitting  
t proofs of inferior note, 1 refer to the exten­  
sive aggressions on die trade of the United  
States, founded on the plea of blockades,  
never legally established according to recog  
ni/ed. definitions ; to the still more extensive  
violation of our commerce with ports of her  
enemies, not pretended to hr in a state of  
blockade ; St to the British order of council is­  
sued near the comim neement of the existing  
war. This order besides its general inter­  
polation against the established law of nati­  
ons is distinguished by a&#x27;special ingredient  
violating that law recognized by the  
course of derisions in the British churls. It  
subjects to capture and Condemnation ail  
neutral Vessels, returning with law u. car­  
goes, on the s &gt;5e consideration, that they  
had in their outward voyage, deposited con­  
traband of war sit a liosti!** port. If tiie  
commerce of the United States could there­  
fore in any case be reh:- :&gt;nably made the vic­  
tim and the rport of mutual charges and re­  
proaches between belligerent parties; with  
respect to the priority of their aggressions  
on neutral commerce. Great-Britain must  
look beyond the&#x27;epoch she has chosen far il­  
legal acts cf her adversary, in support of  
the allegation on which she founds her re­  
taliating edict against our commerce.  
But tiie United States are given to under­  
stand that tiie British £*«%cYI....».r.; ha;,  
a proof of its indulgent and amicable dispo­  
sition towards them, mitigated the authori­  
s&#x27;d rigor if might have given to its measures,  
I by certain exceptions peculiarly favorable  
I to the commercial interests of the United  
States.  
I forbear. Sir, to express all the emotions  
with Which such a language on such an oc­  
casion, is calculated to inspire a nation, which  
cannot for a moment be unconscious of its  
rights, nor mistake for an alleviation of  
wrongs regulations, to admit the val ditv of  
which would be to assume badges of liumili­  
ation never worn by an independent power.  
The first of these indulgences is a com­  
mercial intercourse with the dependencies  
of the enemies of Great-Britain, and it is  
considered as enhanced by its being a devi­  
ation in favor of the United States from the  
nncient and established principle of mari­  
time law prohibiting altogether such an in­  
tercourse in time of war.  
  
Surely, Sir. your government in assuming  
this principle in such terms in relation to  
1 the U. S. must have forgotten their repeat­  
i ed and formal protest against it, as these  
are to he found in the discussions and com­  
munications of their minister at London, as  
•.veil as in explanations occasionally made on  
that subject to the British representative  
here. But permit me to ask, more particu­  
larly, how it could have happened that the  
principle is characterised as an ancient and  
established one. I put the question the  
more freely, because it has never been de­  
nied that the principle, as asserted by vour  
government, was for the first time introdu­  
ced during the war of 1756 It is in fact in­  
variably cited and described in all judicial  
and other official transactions, “as the rule  
of 1756.&quot; It can have no pretension there­  
fore to the title of an ancitru rule  
Ami instead of being an entablia/iccl rule  
or principle, it is well known that Great­  
Hritain is the only nation that has acted up­  
on, or otherwise given a sanction to it. Nav.  
it is not even an established principle in the  
practice of Great Britain herself. When  
first applied in the war of 1756, the legali­  
ty of a neutral trade with enemy’s colo­  
nies was not contested by it In certain ca­  
ses only of the colonial trade the allegation  
was, that the presumptive evidence arising  
from circumstances against the bona tide  
neutrality of the ownership justified the  
condemnation as of enemy’s property. If  
the rule of condemnation was afterwards,  
during that war, converted into the princi­  
ple now asserted. it could not possibly have  
bee&#x27;n in operation in its new shape, more  
than a very tew years. During the succeed­  
ing war of 177H, it is admitted by every Bri­  
tish authority, that the principle was never  
brought into operation. It may be regarded,  
in fact, as having been silently abandoned ;  
and within the period of war since its com­  
mencement in 179 ’&gt;, the manner in which  
the principle lias been alternately contract­  
ed and extended, expla ned sometimes in  
one way, sometimes in another, rested now  
on this foundation, now m that, is no secret  
tathose who have attended to its history and  
progress in the British orders of council add  
the British courts of admiralty.  
With the exception, therefore, of a pe­  
riod, the last in modern times from which  
authentic precedents of maritime law will  
be drawn, and throughout which the United  
States more interested in the question than  
any other nation, have uniformly combatted  
the innovation, the principle has not in the  
British tribunals been in operation fora long­  
er term than three, frtur or five yeitrs, whilst  
in no others has it ever made iis appearance  
but tu receive a decision protesting against  
  
It  
fsuch is the antiquity ami such the autho­  
rity of a principle, the deviations from which  
are held out as so many favors consoling the  
United States for the wide-spread destruc­  
tion of their legitimate commerce.  
»What roust be said as to th • other excep­  
tions, which seem to have been vie ved h  
claims o.i the gratitude of the U. S. ? Is it  
; tin indulgence to them in carrying on their  
[trade with the whole continent of Eu­  
rope, tob« laid under the necessity ot going  
1 lirst to a British port to accept a British  
! !isconce and to pay a tribute to tlie Bri­  
tisli Exchequer, hs if wo had been reduced  
to the colonial situation which once imposed  
the e monopolizing restraints?  
What again must lie said as to other Tea  
tit res which we see blended on the face of  
these regulations? If the policy of them lie  
to subjectnn nuemv to privations, wlty ate  
channels opened fora British trade with  
them which are shut to a neutral trade ? If  
in other cases, the real object he to admit a  
neutral trade with the enemy, why is it re­  
quired that neutral vessels shall perform the  
cercmonv of passing through a British port,  
when it can have no imaginable effect but  
the known and inevitable one of prohibiting  
the admission e&quot; the trade into the port of  
destination ?  
1 will lint.&#x27;ask why si itnnrv article of  
our productions arid exports, cotton Wool, b  
to be distinguished. *n its transit, by a heavy!  
impost not imposca on other articles, because i  
  
it ft frankly &#x27;hVowech Hu your exp! irrtirm of i  
the orders, to bo intended as an encourage*  
meat to British manufactures, and r check,  
to the rival ones of 1‘raucc ? I suppress alsw,  
though withoet the same reason for it, the  
enquiry, why less rigorous restrictions arc  
applied to the trade of t’ne Harbavy powers  
than are enforced rgainst that of a nation,  
such as the U. S. and in &#x27;relations such as  
have existed between them and Great-Bri  
tain.  
I cannot however pass without notice, the  
very unwarrantable innovation contained in ,  
the two last of the orders, in one of them,  
a certificate of the ’acal origin of *i cargo,  
allhisigh perm:.ted in the port of departure  
l and required in the. port of destination, by  
| regulation* part ly domestic in both, and  
j strictly analogues in princip&#x27;e th the regula- !  
tions in the commercial code of Great-Bri­  
i tain, is made a came of capture on thelrgh  
seas, and of condemnation in her maritime  
jcodrts. In life other order, tlie sale of a I  
i merchant ship by a belKge*-*-nt owner to a  
| neutral, although a transaction ns leira1, (  
when fair, as a dealing in&#x27;any other article, &#x27;  
iscondemned by a general rule, without an  
I atom of proof or of presumption, that the  
[transfer in the ■particular case is fraudulent  
and the property therefore left in an enemv. [  
In fine, sir, tin President sees in the e­  
; diets communicated bv you tacts assumed |  
which did not exist,* principles asserted j  
which never can be admitted: and, under I  
the name of retaliation, measures transcen­  
, ding the limits reconcileable with the fa*-ts 1  
and the principles, as if both were ar. correct !  
as they are unfounded. He sees moreover \
[In the modifications of this system, regula­  
tions violating equally our neutral rights and 1  
our neutral sovereigut). He persuades hitn- [  
self therefore that vour government will see 1  
in the justice of the observations now made 1  
in addition to those I had the honor verbal- i  
ly to ) «&#x27; the first instance. that &#x27;  
the United States are well warranted in &#x27;  
looking for a speedy revocation of a svs- &#x27;  
-cm which is every day augmenting the mas* j  
of injury for which the United States have;  
the best of claims to redress  
I have the honor to he. icc. &amp;c.

These orders interdict to neutral nations 1  
,r rather to the IT. S. now the only com- (  
nercial nation in a state of neutrality, all 1  
ommercc with the enemies of G. Britain, 1  
iow neartv the whole commercial world, j  
nth certain exceptions only, am! under cer- &#x27;

iie fiscal policy of G. Britain ; and on thaiH  
  
iccount, the more derogatory from the .ho. I  
i t and indeprnd- nee of iiou&#x27;ral nations.

regur led iltc remmstrsnres conveyed in mv

igains&#x27; another order of council issued on  
* si-nlir pici, ib the month xf January,  
I&#x27;lor. To those just remonstrances, no  
swer was indeed ever given ; wh tat the or­  
der has been continued in its pernicious o  
O-ration ngainst-tiie lawful commerce of the  
U. S. and we now lind added to it others,  
instituting still more ruinous depredations,  
without even the addition &lt; • any new pre­  
text : and when moreover it is notorious,  
•.hat -the order of Janu iry w s of a mtui e  
greatly to overbalance in its etfecij any in­  
juries to Grc it Britain&#x27; that could lie ap­  
prehended from *he illegal operation of the  
French decree on which the order was to  
retaliate, had that d-cree in iis illcg .1 op­  
eration been actually applied to the U. S.  
and been acquiesced mi by them.  
The last orders, likethat ofJanuary, p.m  
cee l on the most unsubstantial foundation.  
They assume for f.&lt;ct an acquiescence of  
the G. S. in an unlawful application to them  
of the French decree : and they assume for  
a principle that the right of retaliation ac­  
cruing to one belligerent against a neutral,  
through whom an injury is done by another  
belligerent, is not to have for its measure  
that of the injury rece.ved, but may be ex .  
ercised in any extent, and under any modi  
fic at ions, which may suit the pleasure of the  
policy of the complaining party.  
The fact, sir, is un qu vocully disowned.  
It is not true that tlv U. S have acquies  
ced in anilleg.il operation of the French de­  
cree : nor is it even true :h it at the dale ol  
the British orders of Nov 11, a single ap­  
plication of that decree to the commerce of  
the U. S. on the hi h seas can be presum­  
ed to have been known to the British gov­  
ernment  
The French decree in question has two  
distinct aspects, one clearly importing an !  
intended operation within the teir tor a. li  
mils as a local law $ the other apparently  
importing an Intended operation on die h.gli  
  
Under the first aspect, the decree, howe­  
ver .tlierw s • objectionable, cannot be said  
to have violated the neutrality o the U. S.  
I’ the governing powers on the continent of  
Europe choose to exclude from their ports  
British property or British productions, or  
neutral vesse s proceeding fiom British  
ports it is an ac of sovereignty which the  
U S.havener rlit tocont:overt. The same  
sovereignty is exercised by G. Britain at  
all times, in peace as well as in war, to­  
wards her frien Is as well as her enemies.  
Iler st .lute book, presents a thousand illus­  
trations.  
It is only, therefore, under the other as­  
pect of the df cr e, that it can have v.nlat­  
ed neu ral rights; and this would have re­  
sulted from its execution on the high seas,  
whether on the pretext of a nominal block­  
ade, or with a view to enforce a domestic  
regulation against foreign vessels, not w.th­  
in the domestic precincts, but under the au i  
thority and protection oftnc law of nations  
Had then the French decree been execu-1  
ted on the high seas against the commerce  
o} the U. S. with G. B itain, and have the  
U. S acquiesced in the unlawful and inju­  
rious proceeding ?  
I stite, sir, on undeniable authority that  
the first instance tn which that decree was  
put in force against the neutral rights ut  
the U. S. was that of the Horizon, an Aim -  
r can ship bound from G. Britain to L.ma,  
wrecked within the territorial jurisdiction  
of France, but condemned under an expo­  
sition of the decree ex ending to the h&#x27;gh j  
s-as its operation against neutrals. Tins  
judicial decision took place as late as the  
16 r. day of Oct. 1807, and was not official 1  
ly known to the minister plempot ntnryol  
the U. S at Farts, till &gt;nme time iti Novem­  
ber. At the date then fore of the first or., i  
derot G. Britain, no injury whatever had  
been done to her, through un aggression on  
the com me ret of the IT S. NopresunptL  
on even had been sufficiently author.sed tii.u 1  
the express stipulation in the treaty of  
l* ranee with the LJ Spates would not exempt  
their commerce at least from the operati­  
on of »ny edict incompatible with them. At j  
• he date even of the lutter orders&#x27; of Nov. !  
11, it appears- that the only aggression which  
bad then occurred, was pretty certainly un­  
known to the British government, and &lt;ould  
therefore have had no share In producing  
thi- alleged retaliation.  
Tn ihl* f ir-f lh It |K&lt;| sliln U/I.l.—. __  
  
he fi&#x27;-st th.it occurred of aw execution ofj  
the French decree on the high sea:, I ain  
able to add that aa late as the 30th ot’ No.  
•rember no other case had been brought in­  
to the French court of prizes. From acl  
counts whicli have lately appeared, it is  
non* than probable that unlawful captures  
iy French crulzers have since taken place,  
uut it remains to be known whether they  
)re to be referred iotfce conrun ence of Hie

Uritish orders of Nov. 11.  
1 state wi h equal confidence, that at no  
i’ne h«vr tue U. S acquiesced in virdati­  
&gt;ns of tneir neutral rights injurious to G.  
Britain, or any other belligerent nation. So  
»r were they, m particular, from acquits*  
ing in the French decree of Nov. 1806, that  
he moment it w.s known to their minister

ne it.ing in relation to the U S. winch were  
uv-rthle, anil uncontradicted by the ictu­  
il operation of the decree; thrt he steadi*  
y watch id over the proceedings under it,  
vith a readiness to interpose nguost any  
inlnwful ex&#x27;en.ion of them to the commerce  
»f the LT. S tliat no tune was lost, after the  
lecree c me to the knowledge of the gov­  
ernment here, in giving him proper iustruc­  
ions on the subject; that he was equ illy  
jrompt, on receiving the decision of tne  
:ourt in the case of the Horizon, in presen  
ing to the French government a reinon­  
itrance in terms which can never be cen  
mred for a defect of energy ; and that b&gt;  
lie first opportunity after that decision rea_  
died the Pies.dent the particular iustruc*  
ions required by it were forwarded to that  
nmister. Nor is it to be forgotten tha  
irevioas to the British orders of November,  
t had been explicitly conmitimcated to the  
fritisn government by the American min­  
ster at London, that explanations uncon  
radicted by any overt act had been given  
  
to our minister at Paris, which justifi s a

veiled through them by one belligerent  
gainst another was to leave lue.ii nochoice  
but between the retaliating vengeance of  
the latter, and an instant declaration of war  
against the former? Reason revolts again*!  
this :&lt;s the sole alternative. The rj o

of North Carotins, by »n immediate res &gt;rt

With respect to the principle assumed by  
the Brush orders, it is perfectly clear t ut  
it could not justify them in the extent given  
to their operation, if the facts, erroneously  
assumed, c-mld have been fully sustained.  
Retaliation is a specific or equivalent re­  
turn of injury for injury received; and where  
it .s to operate through the interests of a  
third party having no voluntary particioat  
tion m the injury received, the return ought,  
as already observed, to be inflicted with the  
uioat forbearing hand.

Six,—Having laid before the President your letter of the 23d of  
February, explainingthe chara&amp;er of certain Britith orders of coun­  
eitiflued in November last, T procecd to communicate the observa­  
tions and representations which will manifelt to your government  
the sentiments of the president on so deep a violation of the com­  
merce and rights of the United States. -  
Thelc orders interdi&amp; to neutral nations, or rather to the United  
States, now the only commercial natiea in a state” of necutrality, all  
commerce with she encmics of G. Britain, now nearly the whole  
gommercial world, with certain exceptions only, and under certain  
rcgulations, but too cvidently fathioned to the commereial, the  
manufa&amp;uring and the fifcal policy of Great Britain ; and on that  
account, the more derogatory from the honor and independence of  
neutral nations.  
The orders are the more calculated to excite surprise in the Uni­  
ted States,as they have d?frcgardcd the remonfirances conveyed in  
my letters of the 2cth and 29th March, 1807, against another order  
of council issued on a ﬁmilv plea, in the month of January, 1807.  
Fo thole jult remonfirances, no answer was indeed ever given ;  
whillt the order has been continued in its pernicious operation a­  
gainst the lawful commerce of the United States, and we now find  
added to it others, inflituting still more ruinous depredations, with­  
out even the addition of any ncw pretext : and whea moreover it  
is notorious, that the order of January was of a nature greatly to  
overbalance in its effcCls any injurics to Great Britain that could be  
gpprechended from the illegal operation es the French decree on  
which the order was to retaliate, had that decree in its illegal op­  
eration been actually applied to the United States, and been acqui­  
efeed in by tham. &#x27;  
The last orders, like that of January, proceed on the most unfub­  
fantial foundation.—They aflume for fa® an acquiescence of the  
Uaited States in an unlawful apphication to them of the French  
decree : and they affuome for a priuciple that the right of retalia­  
tion accruing to one belligerent againit a neutral, through whom  
an injury is donc by another belligerent, is not to bave for its mea­  
sure that of the injury reecived, but may be exercised in any extent  
and under any modifications, which may suit the pleasure or the  
policy of the complaining party.  
- The fa&amp;, fir, is uncquivocally difowned.—lt is not true that the  
Unired States have-acquicefced in an illegal operation of the French  
decrec: mor is it even true that at the date of the Britith orders of  
Nov. 11, a single application of that deeree to the commerce of the  
United States onthe high [cas can be presumed to have been known  
to the Britith government.  
The French decree in question has twe diftin&amp; afpedts, one clear­  
}y importing an intended operation within the territorial limits as a  
Jocal law ; the other apparently importing an intended operation  
on the high seas.  
Uoder the fir® afped®, the decree, however otherwile objsciona­  
bie, cannot be said to have violated the meutrality of the United  
States. If the governiny powers of the contineat of Europe choose  
to cxrlude from their ports British property or British prodations  
or ncutral veflels proceedivg from British ports, it is an a&amp; of fov.  
ereignty which the United States have no right to controvert. The  
fame fovercignty is cxercifed by Great Britaia at all times, in peace  
as weil 1s in war, towards her (riends as well as her encmics. Her  
statute book prefcats a thousand illustrations. ;  
It is ouly thercfore, under the other afpe of the decree, that it  
ean have violated meniral rights ; and this would have resulted  
from its cxecution on the bigh seas, whether on the pretext of 2  
nominal ‘blockade, or with a view to enforce a domestic regulation  
against foreign veflels, not within the domestic precinéts, but under  
the authority and protection of the law -of nations. -  
Had then the Fiench decree been exccuted on the high seas, a­  
g3init the commerce of the United States with Great Britain, and  
have the United States acquicfced in thé unlawful and injurious  
procecding ? :  
I Rtate, fir, on uadeniable authority, that the firlt inftansc in  
which that decree was put in force against the neutral rights of the  
U. States, was that of the Herizon, an American ship bound from  
Great Britain to Lima, wrecked within the territorial jurisdiction  
of France, but coudemned under an exposition of the decres exten­  
ding to the high fcas its operation against ncutrals. This judicial  
decision took place as late as the 16th day of O&amp;ober, 1807, and  
was got officially known to the minister plenipotentiary of the U­  
nited States at P.ris, till some time in November, At the date  
tl*™ zfcre of the firft order of Great Britain, no injury whatever  
had becn done to her, through an aggression on the commerce of  
the United States. No presumption even had been fufficiently au­  
thorifed, that the express flipulations in the treaty of France with  
#1 - United States would not cxempt their commerce at lesft from  
the operation of any edi&amp; incompatible with them. At the date  
even of the late orders of Nov. 11, it appears that the only aggres­  
sion which had then occurred, was pretty certainly unknown to  
the Britith government, and could thereforc have had no fthare in  
producing this alledged retaliation,  
/To thi‘ fact that the thip Horizon was the firft that occurred of  
an execution of the French decree on the high seas, lam able to  
add, that as late as the 30th of November, no other case had been  
brought into the French coust of prizes. From accounts which  
have latclg appeared, it is more than probable that unlawful cap-’  
tures by Fremch cruigers have since taken place, but it remains to  
be known wheiher they are to be referred to the concurrence of  
the French government in the judgment prononnced in the case  
of the Horizon, or not rather to a French decree of the 17th Dec.  
last, profefling to be a retaliation con the British orders of Nov. 11.  
I state with cqual confidence, that at no time have the Taited  
States acquicfeed in violations of their nentral rights injurious to  
G. Britain, or any other belligerent nation. So far were they in  
particular, from acquiefeing in the French decree of November  
1305, that the moment it was known to their minister at Paris, he  
called for explanations of jts muning in relation to.the U. States  
which were favorable, and uncontradiéted by the actual operation  
of the decrae - that ‘he steadily watched over the proceedings un­  
der it, with a readiness to interpose again{l any nalawful extension  
ofg}&amp;em 10 the commerce of the United States; that o time was  
Joft, aftzr the decree came to the knowlege of the government here,  
in giving him proper inftru@ioas on the subject ; that he was equal­  
ly prumipt oa recciving the decision of the court in the case of the  
Horizon,in presenting to the French government a remonstrance in  
terms which can never be fenfnred for a defeét of cnergy ; and that  
by the ﬁrﬁ:gportunity after that decision reached the president, the  
particular infiractions required by ity were forwarded to that min­  
ificr.—Neor isit to be Zorgotten, that previous to the Britith orders  
oi November, it had been cxplicitly communicated to the Britith  
government by the American minister at London, that explanations  
nocontradidted by any overt a had been given to our miniffer at  
Paris, which juflitics a reliance, that the French decree would not be  
put in force agfv [t the United States, and that the ecmmunication.  
was repeated to the British government immediatcly on the publica­  
sion of thofc erders, ) 7 . ST T  
What more conld have been requircd on the part of the U. States  
to obviate rctaliating pretensions of any fort om the &#x27;part of Great  
Britain ? Retaliatious are meafuresof rigor in all cales. Where thcf  
are tooperate through a third and involuntary party, they will nev­  
er be hastily resorted to by 2 magnaninous or a jult power ; which  
will always allow to the third glrl:lh)ﬂ right to discuss the merits of  
the case, and will-never permit itfelf to enforce its measures, without  
affording a reafunsble time for tlie use of reasonable means for substi­  
tuting anofher remedy. - What would be the situation of ncutral  
powers, if the firlt blow levelled Whm Mﬁgtm  
gainkt auother, was to leave them. no cheice, but between the re-

Retaliation is a {pecific or equivalent return of injury for injury ,  
received—an? where it is to operate through the interests of a third  
party having no voluntary pacticipation in thainjury received. the |  
.returs ought, as alrcady oblerved, to be infhicted with the most for­  
bearing hand. .. Pl  
- This is the language of common sense and the clearclt cquity. As  
the right to retaliate results mcrely from the wrong fuffered, it can­  
not in the nature of things extcod beyond the extent of the fuficring.  
There may often be a difficulty in applying this rule with cxactac(s,  
and a reaionable latitude may be allowable on that consideration.  
But a manifelt and extravagant departure from the rule can find no  
apology. -&#x27; : X 1 S : 3  
What then is the extent of the injury expericnced by Great Bri­  
tain from the meafurcs of her enemices, so far as the opcrat.ion of  
those measures through the United States,can render them in any  
sense responsible. e k. : :  
A mere declaration by a belligerent, without the intention or the  
means to carry itinto effe@, against the rights and obligations of a  
neutral nation, and thence again(t the interests of another belligerent  
cquld afford po pretext to the latter to retaliate at the-expence of  
the neutral. The declatation mightgive jult offence to the neutral,  
but it would belong to him alone to decide on the course prescribed  
by the respect he owed to himfelf, No real damage having accru­  
cd to the beiligerent, no indemnity could accrue. |  
For the {ame reason a declaration of a belligerent which he is  
known to be cither not in a situation or not to intend, to carry but  
partially into exccution against a neutral, to the injury of another  
belligerent, could never give more than a right to a commen(urate  
redress against the ncutral. All remaining unexecuted and evidently  
not to be. executed is merely ostensible, working no injury to any,  
uanlefs it be in the difrefpe@ to the ncutral, to whom alone it be­  
longs to resent or disregard it. g |  
“Ering the case before us&#x27;to this plain and equitable test. The  
French decrée of November, 1806, undertook to declare the Bri­  
[ tifhh [fles in a (tate of blockade, to be enforced if you please again(t  
the wcutral commerce of the United States oun the high seas, accord­  
ing 1o the faculty poflefled for the purpose. As far as it was actu­  
ally enforced; or an effet resulted from an apprehesnfion that it  
could and would be enforced, it was an injury to Great Britain, for  
which let it be [uppofed the United States were answerable. On  
the other hand, as far as it was not enforced, and evidently cither  
would not or could not be enforeed, no injury was experienced by  
Great Britaig, and no remedy could lic against the United States.—  
Now, fir, it never was pretended that at the date of the firft Britith  
ocder issued in January, 1807, any injury had accrued to, or was  
apprehended by Great Britain from an exccution of the French de­  
cree upon the commeree of the United States, on the theatre of  
the:r neutral rights. So far from it, that the erder stands fclf con- |  
demned as a measure of retaliation, by expressly (tating that fleets  
of France:and her allics, instead of being able to enforce the block­  
ade of the Britith Hles, were themselves confined 6 their own ports  
by the entire superiority of the Britith navy - eonverting thus, by  
the strangest of reasonings, the security of Great Britain against ins  
jury from the French decree, into a title to commit injury ona  
vcatral parey.—ln the November orders also, whilst it is admitted  
that the French decree could not be but imperfeétly exccuted for  
want of mecans, it is asserted that the intentioa of the Freanch decree,  
and not the injury accruing from its operation through the com­  
merce of the United States, is the feale by which the retaliating in--  
jury againfl them is to be measured. : ‘  
Sugh arc the pretests, and such the principles, on which one  
great branch of the lawful commerce of this country became a vic­  
tim to the firft British order, and on which the laftiorders are now  
sweeping from the ocean atl its most valuable remains, - \
Againit such an upprecedented system of warfare gn neutral rights  
&#x27;, and national independence, the common judgmat and common  
. feeling of mankind must forever protest. bh  
| I&#x27;touch, fir, with reluctance, the:queftion on which of the bellig­  
{ erent sides the invasion of ncutral rights had its origin, As the U.  
| States do not acquicfce in those invasions by either, there could be  
no plea for involving them in the controversy. Bit asthe Britith  
orders have made the decree of France, declaring, contrary to the  
law of nations, the British islands in a state of bmrethdc, the imme­  
diate foundation of their defiru@ive warfare on &lt; ¥~ commerce, it  
belongs to the subject to remind your goverur he illegai in­  
terruptions-and spoliations fuffered, previor cree by the  
necutral commerce of the U. States, vnde ;8 of British  
cruizers and courts, and for the most - e of express  
orders of the government itfelf. O erior note,  
I refer to the extensive daggreflions - ‘nited States,  
founded on the plea of blockade ifhed accord­  
| ing to recognized definitions- Ive violations  
of our ‘tommerce with port: _~ames, noc pretended to be in  
a state of blockade ; and to tauc srifith order of couucil ifliied near  
the commencement of the existing war. ‘T&#x27;his ordcr, besides its gen­  
eral interpolation again(t the eftablithed law of nations, is diftin­  
guithed by a special ingredient violating that Jaw as recognized by  
the course of decisions in the British courts. It fubje@s to capture  
and condemnation all ncutral veflels, refurning with tawful cargoes,  
+ on the sole consideration that they had, in their outward voyage,  
deposited contraband of war ata hostile port. If the commeree of  
the United States could therefore in any case be reatonably made  
the victim and the sport of mutual charges and reproaches between  
belligerent partics, with refpe to the priority of their aggreflions  
; on neuiral conminerce, Great Britain® muflt look beyond the epoch  
‘ she has chosen for illcgal a&amp;s of her *dverfzry, in support of the  
allegation on which she founds her retaliating cdicls _againft our  
’ commerce.  
‘ But the United States are given to understand, that the British  
{ government hds, as a proof of its indalgent and amicable difpofition’  
| towards them, mitigated the authorifed rigor it might have given to  
its measures, by certain exceptions peculiarly favorable to the com­  
mercial interests of the United States. » N 2  
I forbear, fir, to express all the emotions with which fych a lan,  
guage,on such an occasion, iscalculated to inipire a naticn which  
cannot for a moment be unconscious of its rights, nor mistake for  
an alleviation of wrongs, regulations to admit the validity, of which  
-would be to aflume badges of humiliation, never worn by an inde­  
pendent power. ! % o :  
The firft of these indulgencies, is a commercial intercourse with  
the dependencies of the enemics of Great Britain, and it is confid­  
ercd us enhanced by its being a deviation in favor of the Unitcd  
States, from the ancient and citablifhed principlc of maritime law,  
prohibiting altogether such an intercourte in time of war.  
Surely, fir, your government in afluming this principle in such  
| terms in relation to the Unitcd States, muyft have forgotten their re­  
peated and formal protefls againtt it, as these are to be found in the  
| difeuflions and communications of their minister at London, as well  
as in explanations occasionally made on that fubjud to the Britith  
representative here. But permit me to ask, more parficularly, how  
it could bave happened that the principleis charaterifcd as an an­  
cieat and efablithed one.. I putthe queflion the more freely, be­  
cause it has never been denied that the principle, as aflerted by your  
government, was for the firlt time introduced during the war of  
1756, &#x27;}t is in fact invariably cited and deferibed in all judicial and  
other official transactions “as the rile of 1756.” It can have no  
pretension tbcu‘rc to the title of an-ancient rule. ‘  
And inflead of being an eflablifbedruleor principle, it is well­  
known that Great Britain is the only nation that has aéred upon, er  
otherwise given a fanétion to it. Ny, it is not even 21 established  
‘principle in the practicc of Great Britain herfelf. &quot;Wlhen firft ap­  
plicd in the war of 1756, the lgality&#x27;6f a neutral trade with the  
cnemy’s colonies was.not contested by&#x27;it. In certain cases only, of  
the colonial trade, allegation was, that the presumptive g evidence  
arising from circumstances againit the bona fide neutrality of the  
ownerthip jultificd the condemnation ‘as of enemy’s property. If  
the rule ‘of condemnation was afterwards, duripg thst war, con-  
Vtted into the principle now asserted, it ¢ould not poflibly lLave  
been in operation in Its new shape, more than a very few years. —  
During the fuceceding war of 1778, it is admitted .by cvery Britith  
antberity that the principle was never brought into opcratjon. It  
may be regarded, in fact, as having been filcutly abandoncd ; and  
within the period of war since its commencement in 1793, the man­  
- merin which the principle has been alterpatcly contracled and ex-.  
| tended, explained fometinies in one way, sometimes in another,  
refled now on this foundavion, new on that, is no secret to those 3  
- who have attended to its history snd progress in the British orders  
of council, and the Britith ¢ouvres of a:iaimty;* e L  
With the exception, therefore, of a period, the last in.modern  
times from which authentic precedents of maritime law will be  
~drawn, and throughout which the United States, more intercfied in  
the question than any ether natiou, i#ve uniformly combatted the&#x27;  
innovation ; the principle has not inthe British tribunals been in  
_operation for a longet fexm (hen thice, four ve five years, whillt in  
5o others has it &quot;g ‘made its appeatance, but to reveive a decision

have been viewed as claims onthe gratitude  
of the Ugited States ? Isit an indulgenceto |  
them in carrying on thcir trade with the !  
whole continent of Earope, to Lic laid under }  
the neeeflity of going firft to a Britith port,  
to accept @ Britiih licence and to pay a tris o  
bute to the Britith excheqier, as if we had  
been reduced to the colonial firmation which |  
once imposed these monopolizing rcftraints ? |  
What again must-be said as to other sea- 1  
tures which we fee blended on the face of  
these regulations ? If the polisy of them be  
to subject an enemy to privations, why are  
channels opened for a Britith trade with  
them, which are shut to a ncutral trade ? if  
in other cases, the real objcét be to admit a  
neutral trade with the enemy, why is it re­  
quired that neutral veflels shall perform the  
ceremony of pafling through a British port,  
when&#x27;it can have no imaginable effedt, but  
the known aund-inevitable one of prolnbiting  
the admiflion of the trade into the port of  
destination ? ’ X  
&quot;L will not ask why a primary article of our  
produious and exports, cotten wool, is to  
be diftinguithed, in its transit, by a heavy im­  
post not imposed on other articles, because it  
is frankly avowed, in your explanation of  
the orders, to be intended as an encopurage­  
ment to Biitith manufadtures, and a check  
to the rival ones of France ? I suppress also  
tho’ without the fame rcafon far it, the.en­  
quiry, why lc{s rigorous restrictions are ap­  
plied to the trade of Barbary powers, than  
are cnforced against that of a nation, such  
as the United States, aud in relations such  
as have esifled between them and Great  
Britain.  
I cannot however pass without netice, the  
very unwarrantable innovation contained  
in the two last of the orders. In one of them  
a certificate of the local origin of a cargo,  
altho’ permitted in the port of departure  
and required in the port of destination, by  
regulations purely domestic in both, and  
strictly analogous in principle to the regu­  
lations in the commicrcial code of G Britain,  
is made a cause of capture on the high seas,  
and of condemanation i her maritime courts  
In the other order, the fail of a nierchant  
ship by a beligerent owner to a neutral, zl.  
though a transaction as legal when fair, as a  
dealing in any other article, is condemned  
by a general rule, without #n atom of proof  
or of presumption, that the transfer in  
the particular case is fraudulent, and the  
property therefore left in an enemy.  
In fine fir, the president fees in the edics  
communicated by you, facts aflumed, which  
did not cxift, principles asserted, which nev­  
¢f ¢an be admitted : and, under the name  
of retaliation, mealures transcending the li­  
mits reconcilcable with the fa®s and prinei­

wnfounded. He fees moreover in the mod­  
ifications of this fy(lem, regulations violat­  
ing cqually our nevtral “rights and our va­

therefore, that your government will {ce  
in the justice of the- bfervations now made,  
in addition to those I had the hunor verbal­  
ly to state to you, in the firft instance, that  
the United States ale well warranted in  
looking for a speedy revecation of a {yftem

This is ti»e language of common sense and  
the clearest equity. As the right to retali­  
ate results merely from the wrong suffer­  
ed, it cannot in the nature of things extend  
beyond the extent of the suffering. There  
may often bo&#x27;a difficulty in applying this rule  
with ex ictucHH, and a reasonable latitude  
may tie allowable on that consideration. But  
manifest and extravagant departure from  
the rale can find no apology.  
What then is the extent of the injury ex­  
per.e.icc l hv (i. Britain from the measures  
of her enemies so far as the operation of  
those measures throughout the U. S. can  
render them in any noise responsible ?  
A mere declaration by a belligerent, with­  
out the intention or the means to carry it  
into effect, against die rights and obligati,  
ons of a neutral nation, and thence against  
the interests of another belligerent, could  
afford&#x27; no pretext to the latter to retaliate  
at the expense of the neutral. &#x27;The decla­  
ration rp’tght give just offence to the neutral,  
but it would belong to hint alone to-decide  
oil the course prescribed by the respect he  
ow-&#x27;ib to htutself. No real damage having  
accrued to too belligerent, no indemnity  
could accrue.  
For the same reason, a declaration of a i  
  
belligerent, winch lie is known to be either  
not io u situation or not to intend, to carry  
but partially into execution against a neu­  
tral, to thd injury of another belligerent,  
could never give more than a right to a  
commensurate redresi against the neutral.  
All remaining unexecuted and evidently not  
to be executed, is merely ostensible, work­  
ing no injury to any, unless it he in the dis­  
respect-U) the neutral, to whom alone it be­  
longs to resent or disregard it.  
Bring t iac.ue befoie us to this plain and  
equitable test. .The French decree cf No­  
-revuljcr, 1806, add&amp;rtook to declare the Bri  
t’sh island* state of blockade to be en­  
forced, please, against the .neutral  
OntgpSMrce of «he U. S nt» the high seas, ac­  
. cording to the faculty po-sessed for the pur  
&gt; p &gt;bc. As far as it was actually enforced,  
or an effect resulted from an apprehension  
that it could and wouid be enforced, it w is  
ail injury to G. Britain, for which let it he  
tUppos„d the U. S. were answerable. On  
the other hand, as far ns it was not enfor­  
ced, and evidently either would not &lt;&gt;r could  
not he enforced, no injury was experienced  
by G. Britain and no remedy Could lie a  
gainst the IT. S. Now, sir, it never w*s  
pretended that at the date of the first Bri.  
tish order issu&#x27;-d in January, 1807, any in­  
jury had accrued to, or was apprehended  
bv Great Britain from an execution of the  
French decree against the commerce of the  
JU. S. on the theatre of their neutral rights.  
So far from it that the order stands sell con  
demned as a measure of retaliation, by ex­  
presa&#x27;y stating that the fleets of France nnd  
her allies, instead of being able to enforce  
the blockade of the British isles, wort. them­  
selves confined to their own ports by the  
entire superiority of the British navy; con­  
verting thus, by the strangest of reasonings,  
the sreurity of G. Britain against injury  
from the French decree, intoa title tocom­  
mit Injury on a neutral party. In the No.  
vember orders also, while it is admitted  
that the French decree could not but be im.  
perfectly executed for want of means, it is  
  
asserted that the intention of the French  
decree, aud not the injury accruing from iti  
operation through the commerce of the IT  
is the scale by which the retaliating in.  
jpiy i igainst them is to be measured.  
Such are tlie pretexts and such the prin­  
ciples on which one great brunch of the law  
iul commerce of this country became uvic&gt;  
tim to the first British order, and on which  
th ■ last orders are now sweeping from tin  
ocean all its most valuable remains.  
Against such nn unprecedented system o  
w.irlare on neutral rights and national in­  
dependence, the common judgment unc&#x27;  
common feelings of mankind must forcvei  
protest.  
I touch, sir, with reluctance the questim  
on winch of the belligerent sides tbe itivasi.  
on of neutral rights had its origin. Astht  
IT. S. do n^t acquiesce in these invasions bj  
either, there could be no plea for involving  
them in the controversy. Hut as the Brit.  
Is’i orders have made the decree of France  
declaring, contrary to the law of nations  
the British islands in a state of blockade  
the immediate foundation of their destruc,  
tive warfare on our commerce, It belongs t&lt;  
the subject to remind your government n  
the illegal interruptions and spoliations suf  
fered, previous to tnat decree, by the ncu  
tral commerce of the U. S. under the pro,  
revdings of British cruizera and courts, an&lt;  
for the most part in consequence of expre*  
orders of the government itself. Oiniltinf  
proof of Inferior note, I refer to the ex en.  
sire aggri tdons on the trade of the U. S  
founded on the plea of blockades, never le  
gully established according to i r.coguize&lt;  
Ali&#x27;.f,lotions : to the still more extensive trio  
latinos of one commerce with ports of he  
n H  
  
enemies, not pretended to be in a state of  
blockade ; und to the British order of coun­  
cil issued near the commencement of the  
existing war. This order, besides its ge­  
neral interpolation against the established  
law of nations, is distinguished by a special  
ingredient violating that law as recognized  
I by the course of decisions in the British  
courts. It subjects to capture and condem­  
nation all neutral vessels, returning with  
lawful cargoes, on the sole consideration,  
that they had in their outward voyage, de­  
p Vited contraband of war at a hostile port.  
If the commerce of the U. S could there­  
fore in any case be reasonably made the  
victim and the sport of mutual charges and  
[reproaches between belligerent parties,  
with respect to the propriety of their ag­  
gressions on neutral commerce, G. Brit­  
ain must look beyond the epoch she has cho­  
sen for illegal acts of her adversary, in sup­  
port of the allegation on which site founds  
her retaliating edicts against our commerce.  
But the United States are given to  
understand that the British govern­  
ment has, ns a proof of its indulgent  
•n J amicable disposition towards them,  
mitigated the author ised rigor it might  
have given to its measures, by certain  
exceptions peculiarly favorable to the  
commercial interests of the United  
States.  
I forbear, sir, to express all the emo­  
tions with which such a language, on  
such an occasion, is calculated to in­  
spire a nation which cannot for a mo­  
ment be unconscious of its rights, nor  
mistake lor an alleviation of wrongs,  
regulations, to admit the validity ol  
which would he to assume badges of  
humiliation never worn by an indepen­  
dent power.  
  
1 lie hrst ol these indulgences is a  
commercial intercourse with the de­  
pendencies of the enemies of Great Bri­  
tain and it is considered as enhanced  
bv its being a deviation in favor of the  
United Suites from the ancient and es­  
tablished principle of maritime hw pro­  
hibiting altogether such an intercourse  
in time of war.  
Surely, si-, vour gwcriimcnt in as­  
suming this principle in such terms in  
relation to the United Suites, must  
have forgotten their repealed and for­  
mal protests :tg linst it, as these are to  
be found in tl^c discussions and com.  
muni cat ions of their minister at Lon­  
don, as w II as in exphin.ttions occa­  
sionally made on that subject to the  
British representative here. But per­  
mit me to ask, more particularly, how  
it could h ive happened that the princi­  
ple is characterised us an ancient and  
established one. I put the question  
the more freely, because it has never  
been denied that the principle, as asser.  
ted by your government, was for the  
first time introduced during the war of  
1756. It is in laci invariably cited Sc  
described in all judicial and other offi­  
cial transactions 44 as the rule of 1756.”  
It can have no pretension therefore tc  
the title of an ancient rule.  
And instead of being an established  
rule or principle, it is well known that  
Great Britain is the only nation thal  
has acted upon, or otherwise given s  
sanction to it. Nay, it is not even ar  
established principle in the practice ol  
Great Britain herself. When first ap­  
plied in the war of 1756, the legality  
of a neutral trade with enemy’s colonlei  
was not contested by it. In certain ca  
•esofonly of the colonial trade, the alli­  
gation was, that the presumptive evi  
ilence arisimr from cimunkonro. *  
  
j gainst the bona ficle neutrality of thi  
ownership justified the condemnatioi  
as of enemy’s property. If the ruh  
of condemnation was afterwards, du  
ring that war, converted into the prin  
ciple now asserted, it could not po.ssi  
blyhave been in operation in its nev  
shape, more than a very few years.—  
During the succeeding war of 1/78  
it is admitted by every B’itiih author  
‘ &gt;ty that the principle was never brough  
into operation. It may be regarded  
i in fact, as having been silently aban  
doned j and within the period of wai  
since its commencement in 1793, thi  
, manner in which the principle has beet  
! alternately contracted and extended  
&gt; explained sometimes in one wav  
» sometimes in anothrr, rested now 01  
; this foundation, now on that, is no se  
| cret to those who have attended to it  
f history and progress in the British or  
■ ders of council and the British court  
‘ of admiralty.  
j When the exception, therefore, of  
, period, the last in modern times fron  
; which authentic precedents of mari  
’-•me law will be drawn, and through  
out which the United States, more in  
I terested in the question than any othe  
. nation, have uniformly combated th  
r muovation, the principle has not in th  
  
British tribunals been in operation for  
a longer term than three, four or five  
years, whilst in no others has it ever  
made its appearance but to receive a  
ilec ision protesting against it.  
Such is the antiquity atid such the  
authority ofa principle, the deviations  
from which are held out as so many i  
favors consoling the United States for  
the wide spread destruction of their  
legitimate commerce.  
What must be said as to the other |  
exceptions, which seem to have been  
viewed as claims on the gtatitude of!  
the United States? Is it an indul-/;  
geuce to them in carrying on their&lt;  
trade with the whole continent of l£u- i  
rope, to be laid under the necessity of  
going first to a British port, to accept j  
a British licence and to pay a tribute ■  
to the British exchequer, as if we h id i  
been reduced to the colonial situation  
which once imposed these mouopoliz- i  
ing restraints ?  
What again must be said as to other  
features which we see blended an the  
face of these regulations ? If the pol­  
icy of them be to subject an enemy to  
privations why are channels opened for  
a British trade with them which are  
shut to a neutral trade ? If in oihrr  
cases the real object be to admit a neu­  
tral trade with the enemy, why is it  
required that neutral vessels shall per­  
form the ceremony ot passing through  
a British port, when it can have no im­  
aginable effect but the known and inev­  
itable one of prohibiting the admission  
of the tra|? • into the port of destina­  
tion ?  
  
1 will not ask why a primary article  
ol our productions and exports, cotton  
wool, ts it to he distinguished, in its  
transit, by a heavy impost not imposed  
on other articles, because it is frankly  
avowed, in vour explanation of the or­  
ders, to lie intended as an encourage­  
ment to British manufactures, and a  
t,,cok to the rival ones of France ! I  
supprtsi also, though without the same  
reason lor it, the enejuirv, why less  
rigorous restrictions are applied to the  
trade of iho llarh iry powers than are  
enforced against that of a n uion, such  
as the U. S. anti in relations such as  
h ive exited between them anti Great  
Britain ?  
It cannot however tns» without notice  
the very unwarran&#x27;able innovation con.  
tained in the two hst of the orders- In  
one of them a crroficate, nf the local o.  
e.gm of a cargo, although permitted in  
the port of destination, by regulations  
purely domestic in both, and stri&amp;ly ana  
iogotjs in principle to the regulations ip  
-he commercial node of Great Britain, is  
made a cause ofenmure on the high seas,  
and of condemnation in her maritime  
courts. In the oilier, the sale of a mer.  
chant ship by a belligerent owner to a  
neutral, although u transition as legal  
1 when fair, as a dealing in any other article,  
is condemned hv a general rule, with u&#x27;  
an atom of proof or of presumption, tint  
he transfer in the. particular case is frauriu  
lent and the property therefore left in an  
• enemy.

of the Berlin decree, Mr. Madison says :  
  
“The French decree in question has two dis-  
tinct aspects, one clearly importing an intended op-  
eration within the territorial limits as a local law,  
the other apparently importing an intended opera-  
tion on the high seas.  
  
“ Under the first aspect, the decree, however  
otherwise objectionable, cannot be said tu have vio-  
lated the neutrality of the United States. It the  
governing powers on the continent of Europe,  
choose to exclude from their ports British property  
or British productions, or neutral vessels proceed-  
ing from British ports, itis an act of sovereignty  
which the United States have no right to contro.  
vert. ‘The same sovereignty is exercised by Great-  
Britain atall times, in peace as wel! asin war, to-  
wards her friendsas wellas herenemies Her sta-  
tute book presents a thousand illust.ations.  
  
‘* It is only, therefore, under the other aspect of  
the decree, that it can have violated neutral rights;  
and this would have resulted from its execu&#x27;ion on  
the high seas, whether onthe pretext of a nominal  
blockade, or with a view to enforce a domestic re-  
gulatiowagainst foreign vessels, not within the do-  
mestic precincts but under the authority and pro-  
tection of the law of nations.  
  
** Had then the French decree been executed on  
the high seas against the commerce of the United  
States wiih Grear Britain, and have the United  
States acquiesced in the unlawful and injurious  
proceeding?  
  
‘+ T state, sir, on undeniable authority, that the  
first instance in which that decree was put in force  
against tLe neutral rights of the United States was  
that of the Horizon, an American ship bound from  
Great-Britain to Lima, wrecked within the terri-  
torial jurisdiction of France, but condemned under  
@n exjrosition of the decree extending to the high  
meee operation sgainst neutrals. This judicious  
decision took place as late as the 16h day of Oct.  
1807, arid was not efficially known to the minister  
plenipotentidey of the United States at Paris, till  
  
some time in November. At the date therefore  
of the first orderiaf Great-Britain, no injury what-

Had then the French decree been executed

and injurious proceeding. : &quot;  
&#x27; X state, sir, on undeniable authority, thai the  
fist instance in1 which that deciee was put in  
force against the neutral right of the United  
States, was that of the Horizon, an American  
shjp liound from Great1 Britain to Lima,  
wrecked within the territorial jurisdiction of  
France, but condemned under an exposition  
of the decree extending to the high seas its o­  
pcratiou against neutrals. ; This judicial deci  
sibh took place as late as the 16th day of Oc­  
tober, 1307, and was not officially known to  
the J minister plenipotentiary of the United  
States, at Paris till some time in November.  
At&#x27; the date therefore of the first order of  
Great-Britain, no injury whatever had been  
done to ber, through an aggressaon on the  
coWierce of the United States. No presump­  
tion even hid been sufficiently anthoiised that  
the express -stipulation in the treaty of France  
&quot; with the United States would not exempt their  
commerce at least from the operation of any  
edict incompatible, with them. At the date  
even of thelatter orders, of Nov. 1 1, it appears  
that the only aggression which had then oc­  
curred, was &quot;pretty certainly unknown to the  
British gVernment, and could therefore have  
had no re in producing this alledge&#x27;J reta­  
liation,. &#x27; r . 1  
To tbfs fdct, t,hat .the sltip Horizon was

French court M prizes. &#x27; Froirl accou: ts,

with rcancei than they Tvere bound to atohe  
for Ihe&#x27;burriingtf the French ship of war on  
the shore of North-Carolina, by an immedi­  
ate resort to arms against Great-Britain.  
i-WthTrespfeCt to the principal assumed by  
the &#x27;British prdets, it is perfectly clear tliat it  
could not Justify them in the extent ,t given to  
their operation, if the facts, erroneously as  
sumed, Tould have been fully sustained.  
Hetahation is aJ specific or equivalent Ve­  
turn of injury &#x27; Jbr injury received j &amp; where  
it is to operate through the interests of a third  
.party having no Voluntaiy participation in the  
injury received, the return ought, as already  
observed, to be Inflicted with the most for­  
bearing hand. &#x27; &#x27; .  
y This is th.e. language of common se rise,  
ahi the clearest &#x27;equity. As the right to re­  
taliate results merely from the wrong suffer­  
ed, it cannot in thetiatureof things extend  
beyond the extent of the suffering. There  
may often be a difficulty in applying this rule  
with exactJ)sSt.. and a reasonable la&#x27;itude may  
be allowable on this consideration But a. ma­  
nifest &#x27;and &#x27;extravagant depaiture from the  
rule can find no apology. t . y.  
&quot;what then is the extent of the ,irijury ex­  
perienced by Great Britain from the measure  
of her enemies, so far as the operation of those  
measures, through the United States, can  
render them h any sense rasponaible !  
A mere declaration by a belligereiftt, with­  
but the lteiition or the means to carry  
itinto effect against the rights and obli­  
gations of a neutral nation, and thence a­  
gainst the interests of another belligerent!  
could afford no pretext to the latter to re­  
taljote at the eipt uce of the neutral. &#x27;The  
declaratiAn, might givejufct offeneetothe neu­  
tral, but would belong to him alone to decide  
on thecomse prescribed ; by, the tespect he  
owed to himself. No Veal daniage.Jiav.iDg lac­  
crued to the belligerent, bo indemnity could  
accrue. V-- ,-..&#x27;.  
For the same reason, a declaration of a bel­  
ligerent which he is known to be&quot; either not  
ija a situation, or not to intend, to carry  
butpartially into execution against a neutral,  
to the injury of another belligeremTcould ne  
ve give more than a right to a commensu­  
rate redress against the neutral. All re­  
maining unexecuted and evidently not to be  
executed, is merely ostensible, working no  
injury to any, unless itoe In the duiepcct  
to the neutral, to whom alone it belongs to  
resent or disregard it. &#x27; &#x27;

It is only therefore, under the

can 4 have violated neutral rights ;

sviihin the jurisdiction or France,  
i but condemned under an exposi­  
tion of theydecree extending to the  
high staaf its opeiation against  
neutratn This judicial decision  
took place as &quot;late as the lGth day  
of October, 1807, and w..snot of  
ficla.lv known to the &#x27;minister ple­  
nipotentiary of the United States  
, . at Paris, till some time in Novem  
bcr, At tlie date, therefore, of  
the firsr order of G. Britain, no  
injury yhateverfhad been done to  
v her, through an aggression onthe  
commerce, of the .United Sates.  
No presumptionjever had been  
sufBcicntly authorised that the ex­  
&#x27; press stipulation &quot;in the treaty of  
, Francewith theU.Statcswould not  
exempt their commerce at least  
from the operation of any edict in­  
compatible with them. At the  
date cvenjof the latter orders of  
  
November 1 1 th, it appears thatihe  
on&#x27;y aggrcsion which had then oc  
curred, was prettv certainly un­  
known to the .British government,  
and could therefore .have had no  
hire in producipg the alleged re­  
taliaJba. .. &quot;  
To this fact that the ship Hori-  
Zbn was the first that occured of  
an txccutioij of the French decree  
cm the high seasy I am able to add  
that is lute as the 30ih of Novem­  
ber, no. other case had been bro  
into the French ccurt of prizes.  
From account which have Jately  
Appeared it is more than probable  
that unlawful captures byj&#x27;the  
French auhters have since aken  
place, but it remains ,to be known  
whether thearto be referred to

vernment herein giving him pro  
per .instructjemi1 on. the subject ;  
that he, was equally prompt on re-  
ceiving, the decision 01 the court  
inthe case of the Honzon, in pre­  
senting to the F rench government  
a remonstrance in terms which can  
neycrbV- crasore for a defect of  
eqcrgv ; and that by the first oppor­  
tunitv after that .decision &quot;reached  
the President, the particular in  
structioris required by it were for­  
warded to that minister. Nor  
U it to be forgotten ti prtviU9  
j to the British ordef of Novem­  
(ber, it had been explicitly commu-  
jnicated to-the British government  
by the Amencau minister at Lon­  
don, thit expiations uncontradict-  
rd by an v overt act had been given  
to our minister at Paris, whichjus­  
tines&#x27; a reliance that the French  
decree would not be put in force  
against the U. S. and that the  
communication&#x27; was repealed to  
the British government immedi­  
ately on the publication of those  
orders.  
What more &quot;could have been re  
quired on the pan of the U. S. to  
obviate retaliating pretensions of  
any wort on the part of G Britain ?  
Retaliations arc measures of rigor  
in all cases. Where they are to  
operate through a third and invo­  
luntary party, they will never be  
hastily resorted jo by a greft  
on just power ; which will alwavs  
allow to the third party its right  
to discuss the&quot; merits of the case,  
and will never permit itself to en­  
force its measures, without affird­  
ing a reasonable time for the use  
of reasonable means for sulntitu- !  
ting another remedy. What wou d  
be the situation of leutral p jwers,  
if the fiist biow I. veiled through  
them by one belligerent against an­  
other, was to leave them no choice  
out between the retaliating ven­  
geance of the latter and an insant  
declaration of war against the for-  
Keason revolts against thi  
as the sole alternative. The U.  
S. could no more be bound to e-.  
wide the British orders by an im-1  
mediate war with France, than j  
they were bound to atone for the  
burning of the French sh&#x27;pof war  
on the shore of North-Carolina,  
by an immediate resort to arms  
Sgaiust G. Britain.  
With respect to the principle  
assumed by the British orders, i;  
is perfectly clear thn i: could not  
justify them in the cxtvnt given to  
n, if the facts, erro-  
ueouly assumed, could have been  
luliy sustained.  
Ketaliatton a specific or equi  
valent return of injury for injury J  
received; a-.id where it is to ope- j  
rate tnrough the interests of a .  
third piny having no voluntary j  
participation in, the injury receiv-  
od, the return ouht&#x27;, as alreadyob- j  
served, to be inflicted with the I  
most forbearing hand. i  
1 his is the language of common  
sense and the clearest equity. A3  
the right to retali ate,results merely  
from the wrong sufFered, it cannot  
in the nature of things extend be­  
yond the extent of the suffering.  
There may be often a difficulty in  
pplying this rule with exactness  
Sc a reasonable latit ude may be al­  
lowable on that consideration. But  
a manifest anil extravagant depar  
ture from the rule can hod no apo  
logy. .  
What then ii the extent of the  
injur)&#x27; expert-need by G. Britain  
from the. measures of her enemies,

measures thro&#x27; the U. States can

?Bring the cae before Us to!this  
plain and equitabJete&#x27;sL The  
French decree of Nov. V1S06, un  
dertook to declare the Britishisles  
in a state of blockade; to be en  
forred if you rease against the  
neutral commerce of the U. States  
on the high seas, accord;ng to the  
faculty possessed for the purpose.  
As far as it was actuallv enforced.  
or an effect resulted from an ap­  
prehension that it could and woiiTd  
?e? enforced, it yas an injury to  
Great-Britain, fr whh-ictit be  
supposed th U States were an  
svverablc?. On the otber hand,asfr  
as it was not enforced, and evident  
ly either would not or could not be  
enforced, no injury was txperitfn­  
ced bv.G. Britain, and no remedy  
could lie against the U. States.  
Now, Sir, it never was pretended  
thr.t at the date of the first British  
order issued in January, 1807,iany  
injury had accrued to, or was ap-  
pfehepded by Great-Brit ain from  
an execution of the French decree  
against the comnierce of&#x27;iheU&#x27;  
States, on the theatre of iheirneu  
tral rights. So far from it, tha&#x27;  
the order stands seif-condemned  
as a measure of retaliation, by ex­  
pressly stating that the ftVvts ol  
France and her allies, instead of  
being uble to enforce the blockade  
of the British isles were them­  
selves coufined to their own prrt  
hv tln entire superiority o( the  
British navy : converting IhuS by  
the strangest of reasonings, the  
security cd G. Britain against in  
jury from the French decree, into  
a title to commit miury on a neu  
tra. party. l vie iNovemoer or

ders also, whilst it is admittrd thd  
the French decree tool 1 not be  
but imperfactlytexe-uted for want  
ol means, it is asserted tnat trie in  
tention of the Frenr.h de .ree, and  
not the injury accuivcr from i s  
operation through the .commerce  
of the U. States, is&#x27; the sca!e by  
which the retaliating injury against  
them is to be measured.  
Such are the pretexts and such  
the principles oa which one great  
bran h of the lawful commerce, of  
this country became a victim to  
the first British orders, and on  
which the last orders are now  
sweenmt trom the ocean ail lis  
most valuable remains.  
Agamst such an unprecedented  
system ci warfare ou neutral ngnts  
and national independence, the  
common judgment and common  
feelings oi maukiud mu3t forever  
protest. ;  
s I touch, sir, witli reluctance the  
question on which of the bellige­  
rent sides the invasion ot neutral  
rights had its origin. As the U.  
S. do not acquiesce in these inva­  
sions by either, there could be no  
plea for involving them in the con  
troversy. But as the British or­  
ders have made the decree of  
France, declaring, contrary to the  
1  
law 01 nations, ine xiritiu iswus j  
of nations, tut British islands j  
in a state 01 jOio-wauc, uic mmic  
diate foundation ol their destruc  
tive warfare on. our commerce, it  
belongs to the, subject&quot; to&#x27; remind  
your government of the illegal in­  
terruptions and spoliations suffer­  
ed, previous to that. decree by the  
neutral commerce of the U. States  
under the proceedings of Britisji  
cruizers and coui ts, and for the  
most nart in conseciuence- of ex  
1 .  
pre3 orders of the government it  
self. Omitting proofs of interior  
oote, I refer to the extensive ag­  
gressions on the trade of the U.

nation on which she founds her re  
taliating edicts against our; com  
merce-; ; - &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;  
But the U. States are given to  
understand thatthe British govern­  
ment&#x27;has, as a proof of its indul­  
gent ijibd. amicable dispotiori to­  
wards them, mitigated the autho­  
rised rigor it tmight have given to  
ts measures, by &quot;&quot;certa in excep  
tions ptcuiiarly favorably to the  
commercial interests of the U.  
States.&#x27; !&#x27; &#x27;  
I forbear, sir, to express all the  
emotions with which such a lan­  
guage, on such an crccasibn, is  
calculated to inspire a nation which  
cannot for a moment be uncon­  
scious of its rights, nor mistake  
for an alleviation of wrongs regu­  
lations to admit the validity , of  
which would! be to assume bad­  
ges of humiliations never worn by  
an independent power.  
&#x27; The first of these indulgences  
is a commercial intercourse with  
the dependencies of the enemies  
of G. Britain, and it is consider-  
e&#x27;d as enhanced by its being a de  
yiation in favor of the U. Statet  
from the ancn;&#x27;and established  
principle of maritime law prohi  
biting altogether such an inter  
course in time of war.  
Surely, sir, your government in  
assuming this principle in such  
terms in relation to the U.S must  
hav forgotten their repeated and  
(ormal protests against it, as these  
are to be found in the discussions  
Vnd communications of their Mi  
nister at London, as well as in ex  
olanation occasionally made oh  
hat subject to the British repre  
sentative here. But permit me  
to ,Ttc, more particularly, how it  
could have happened that the prin  
cinle is chiracterised as an ancient  
and established one. I out the  
question the more freely, because  
it has never been denied that the  
princip&#x27;e, as asserted by your go­  
vernment, was for the first time  
introduced during the war of  
1750. It is in. .fact invariably ci  
ted and described in all judicial  
:ind other official transactions u as  
the rule of 1756.&#x27; It can havt  
no pretension therefore to the title  
of in incieiit rule v  
But instead ofbeing an establish­  
ed rule or principle, it is well  
known jthat G. Britain is the only  
nation that has acted upon, or o-  
therwise given a sanction to it.  
Nay, it is not even an established  
principle in the practice of G.  
Britain herself. When first applied  
in the war of 1756, the legality of  
a neutral-trade with enemy s colo­  
nies was not contested by it. In  
certain cases I only of the colonial  
trade, . the allegation was, that the  
presumptive evidence arisihgfrooi  
. . - i - t &#x27; .i .  
circumstances aganist uie uoua nue  
neutrality of the ownership, justi  
hed the condemnation as ot ene  
my&#x27;s property. If the rule of con;  
aemnaiioti was aitetwaras curing  
. 1 &#x27; :  
uie war, convercca into tne princi  
ple now asserted, it could not pos  
sibly have been 10 operation iniits  
new &#x27;shape more than a very few  
years. &#x27;During the succeeding War  
of 1778,itis admitted by every Bri­  
tish authoy thatthe principle was  
never brought imo operation, it  
may be regarded, iri fact, as having  
oeen suentiy aoanapnea ; ot wiinai  
the period of war since its com  
mencement in 1793; the manner in  
-tvhich the principle has been alter­  
nately contracted and extended,  
explained sometimes in one way,  
sometimes1 in another, rested now  
on this foundation, now on that, is  
no secreV to &#x27;those who have at­

Sir Having laidbcfore the FrcsidentyouY  
; .tetter of the J of February, explaining, the  
, , character cf certain British orders of council  
, issued in November last, I proceed tocommu­  
&#x27;nicate the observations and representation  
4- which will manifest to your government the  
- sentiments of the President on so deep avio--&#x27;  
lation of the commerce and rights of the Unit-  
ed States . . -.,-,, :  
. These orders interdict to neutr4nationi Or!  
rather to the United States now the only com­  
mercial nation in a state of neutrality, all com  
&quot;-xnerce -with the-enemies of G Britain, now;  
nearly the whole commercial world, with cer­  
tain exceptions only, and under Certain regu-  
lations, but too evidently, fashioned to the  
; commercial, the manufacturing and the fisical  
policy of Great-Britain j and on. that account,  
the more derogatory from the honor and inde­  
. pciidenceof neutral nations .  
The orders are the more calculated to ex-  
t.ite surprize in the U. States as they have dis-  
. regarded the remonstrances. conveyed in my  
1 ; letters of the Oth and 29th of March, 1807,  
egainst another order of council issued oa a  
1 ; jsimilar plea, in the month of January, l fcOJ.  
, ;.To those just remonstrances&#x27; tio answer was  
1 -: indeed ever given j whilst the order has . I een  
continued in iU pernicious operation against  
&#x27; &#x27; the lawful commerce of the U. States, and we  
: ;j30wf-nd added. to it, others, instituting still  
, xnore ruinous depredations, withouteven the  
- addition of any new pretext: and when more­  
&#x27;v over it is notorious, that the order of January  
j. - was of a nr.ture greatly to overbalance, in, its  
ejects any isjuries to Great-Britain that could  
I be apprehended from the illegal operation of  
&#x27;the French decree oh which the order was to  
t VRetaliate, had that decree in its illegal opera­  
tion teen actually applied to the U. States, and  
4 Lten acquiesced in by them, &quot; : : ;  
&#x27;; , The hist orders;, like that of Jamxary, pro.

’ DEPARTMENT OF a  
Sir, March 25, 1808.  
  
Having laid before the President your  
letter of the 23d of February, explaining  
the character of certain British orders of  
council issued in November last, I proceed  
to communicate the observations and re-  
presentations which will manifest to your  
government the sentiments of the Presi-  
dent on so deep a violation of the commerce  
and rights of the United States.  
  
These orders interdict to neutral nations  
or rather to the United States, now the on-  
ly commercial nation in a state of neutrali-  
ty, all commerce with the enemies of  
Great Britain, now nearly the whole com-  
mercial world, with certain exceptions on-  
ly, under certain regulations, but too evi-  
dently iashioned to the commercial, the  
manufacturing and the fiscal policy of  
Great Britain; and on that account, the  
more derogatory from the honor and inde-  
pendence of neutral nations. iis  
  
The orders are the more calculated to  
excite surprise in the United States as they  
have disregarded the remonstrances convey -  
  
edin my letters of the 20th and 29th of  
March, 1807, against another order in coun-  
cil issued on a similar plea, in the month  
of January, 1807. To those just remon-  
strances, po answer was indeed ever given,  
whilst the order has been continued in its  
pertinacious operation against the lawful  
commerce of the United States, and we  
now have added to it others instituting still  
more ruinous depredations, without even  
the addition of any new pretext; and when  
moreover it is notorious, that the order of  
January was of a nature greatly to overbal-  
ance in its effects any injuries to Great  
Britain that could be apprehended from the  
illegal operation of the French decrees on  
which the orders was to retaliate, had that  
decree in its illegal cperation been actual-  
ly applied to the United States and been  
acquiesced in by them.  
  
The last orders, like that of January,  
procced on the most unsubstantial founda-  
lion. They assume for fact an acquies-  
cence of the United States in an unlawful  
application to them of the French decrec ;  
and they assume for a principle that the  
right of retaliation accruing to one bellige-  
rent against a neutral, through whom an  
injury is done by another belligerent is  
not to have for its measure that of the in-  
jury received, but may be exercised in any  
extent, and under any modifications which  
May suit the pleasure or the policy of the  
complaining party.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
AS  
  
The fact, sir, is unequivocally disowned. |  
  
It is not true that the United States have  
acquiesced in an illegal operation of the  
French decrees ; nor is it even true that at  
the date of the British orders of Novem-  
ber llth, a single application of that decree  
to the commerce of the United States on  
the high seas can be presumed to have been  
known to the British government.

I state with equal confidence, that at no  
time have the United States acquiesced in  
violation of their neutral rights injurious to  
Great Britain or any other belligerent na-  
tion. So far were they, in particular, from  
acquiescing in the French decree of No-  
vember 1806, that the moment it was  
known to their minister at Paris, he called  
for explanations of its meaning in relation  
to the U.S. which were favourable, and  
uncontradicted by the actual operation of  
the decree ; that he steadily watched over  
the proceedings under it, with a readiness  
to interpose against any unlawful exten-  
sion of them to the commerce of the U.S.  
that no time was lost after the decree came  
to the knowledge of the government here,  
in giving him proper instructions on the  
subject ; that he was equally prompt, on  
receiving the decision of the court in the  
case of the Horizon, in presenting to the  
French government a remonstrance in  
terms which can never be censured fora  
defect of energy ; and that by the first op-  
portunity after that decision reached the  
President the particular instructions re-  
quired by it were forwarded to that minis-  
ter. Nor is it to be forgotten that pre-  
vious to the British orders of November, it  
had been explicitly communicated to the  
British government by the American min-  
ister at London, that explanations uncon-  
tradicted by any overt act had been given  
to our minister at Paris, which justifies a  
reliance that the French decree would not  
be put in force against the United States,  
and that the communication was repeated  
to the British government immediately on  
the publication of those orders.  
  
What more could have been required on  
the part of the United States to obviate re-  
taliating pretensions on the part of Great  
Britain ? Retaliations are measures of rigor  
in all cases. Where they are to ope-  
rate through a third and involuntary party,  
they will never be hostilely resorted to by  
a mignanimous ora just power; which  
will always allow to the third party its right  
to discuss the merits of the case and will  
never permit itself to enforce its measures,  
without affording a reasonable time for the  
use of reasonable means for substituting a-  
nother remedy. What would be the situa-  
tion of neutral powers, if the first blow ley-  
elled through them by one belligerent a-  
gainst another, was to eave them no choice  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
but between the retaliating vengeance! the  
latter and instant declaration of war against  
the former ? Reason revolts against this as  
the sole alternative. The U. States could  
no more be bound to evade the British or-  
ders by an immediate war with France,  
than they were bound to atone for the burn-  
ing of the French ship of war on the shore  
of North Carolina, by an immediate re-  
sort to arms against G. Britain.  
  
With respect to the principle assumed by the  
British o:ders, it is perfectly clear thar it could  
not justify them in the extent given to their opera-  
tion, if the facts, erroneously assumed, could  
have been fully sustained.  
  
Retaliation is 2 specific or equivalent return of  
injury for injury received ; and when it is to ope-  
rate through the interest of a third party having  
no voluntary participation in the injury received,  
the return ought, as already observed, to be in-  
flicted with the most forbearing hand.  
  
Thisis the language of common sense and the  
cleares’ equity. As the right to retaliate results  
merely-drom the wrong suffered, it cannot in the  
natureyof things extend beyond the extent of the  
suffering. There may oftem be a difficulty in ap  
plying this rule with exacyness and a reasonable  
lat:tude may be allowed on that consideration. But  
a manifest and extravagant departure from the  
rule can find no apology.  
  
What then is the extent of the injury experi-  
enced by Great Britain from the measures of her  
enemies so far as the operation of those measures  
through the United States can render them in any  
sense responsible.  
  
A mere declaration by a belligerent, without the  
intention or the means to carry it into effect, against  
the rights and obligations of a neutral nation, and  
thence against the interests of another beiligerent,  
could afford no pretext to the latter to retaligte at  
the expence of the neutral. The declaration  
might give just offence to the neutral, but it would  
belong to him alone to decide on the course pre-  
scribed by the respect he owed to himself. No  
real damage having accrued to the belligerent, no  
indemnity could accrue.  
  
For the same reason, a declaration of a bellige-  
rent which he is known to be either not in a sit-  
uation, or not to intend, to carry but partially in-  
to execution against a neutral, to the injury of a-  
nother belligerent, could never give more than a  
right to a commensurate redress against the neu-  
tral. Ail remaining unexecuted and evidently not  
to be executed, is merely ostensible, worxing no  
injury to any, unless it be in the disrespect to the  
neutral, to whom alone it belongs to resent or  
disregard it.  
  
Bring the case before us to this plain and equit-  
abletest. The French decree of November, 1806,  
undertook to declare the British isles in a state of  
blockade, to be enforced if vou please against the  
neutral commerce of the Unired Stares on the high  
seas, according to the faculty possesced for tite  
purpose. fs far as it was actually enforced, or an  
effect resulted from an apprehension that it could  
and would be enforced, it was an injury to Great  
Britain, for which let it be supposed the United  
States were answerable. On the other hand, as  
far as it was not enforced, and evidently either  
would not or could not be enforced, no injury was  
experienced by Great Britain, and no remedy could  
lie against the United States Now, sir, it never  
  
was pretended that at the date of the first British  
order, issued in January 1807, any injury had ace  
crued to, or was apprehended by Great Brivain  
from any execution of the French decree against  
the United States, on the theatre of their neutral

B( ihg the case1 before us tojthis plain aj d  
equitable test - The French decree &quot;of Nov.  
1806, undertook to .declare the British isles.  
  
v io a state of blockade, to be enforced if yoiu  
pltase against the neutral commerce of the!  
  
United states on the-high seas, according to  
the faculty possessed for the purpose. s  
  
far as it was actually enforced, or an effect  
  
resulted trom an apprehension that it could  
ar.d would be enforcd, it was an injury to  
Great Britain, for which let it be supposed  
the United States. were answerable. On the  
other hand, asfarasit was not enforced, and  
evidently either would not er could not be  
enfoiced, na injury was experienced by Great  
Britain, and no remedy could lie against the  
United States. Now, sir,&quot; it was pretended  
that at the date of the first order issued in  
January, 1807, any injury had accrued to, or  
was apprehended by Great Britain from an  
execution of the French decree against the  
commerce pf the United Stetes, on the thea  
tre of their neutral rights. So far- from it,  
that the order stands self-condemaed a3 a mea­  
sure VQf retaliation, by expressly stating that  
the fleets ofFraiice and her allies, instead of  
being abU to enforce the blockade ef the Bn.  
tish isles, were themselves confined to their  
own ports by the entire superiority cf the  
British navy: converting thus, by the strang­  
est of reasonings, &quot;the security of Great Bri­  
tain against injury from the French decree,  
into -a title,, to commit injury on a neutral  
party. In-the November orders also, whilst  
it is admitted that the French decree could  
not be but imperfectly executed for want of  
means, it is asseried thrt the intention of the  
French decree &#x27;, and rjt the injury accruing  
from its operation through the commerce of  
the UnijecTKTates, is the scale by which the  
retaliating injury against them is to bemeasured.-  
Such aire the pretexts and Such the princi  
  
ples on which one great branch ot the lawful  
  
commerce of this country became a victim to  
the first British orders, and on w hich the last  
enl&#x27;ers are now sweeping fronythc ocean all its  
taost valuable remains.  
Against such an unprecedented system of  
Warfare on neutral rights and independence,  
  
1 the common judgment and common feelings  
  
twmanKind. must torcfrer protest.  
1 touch, sir, with reluctance the question  
en which of the belligerent sides thtinfasion of  
neutral rights had its origin. As the United  
Starts do not acquiesce in &#x27;these invasions by  
tithe r, there could be no plea for involving  
tacm in the tontroversey. But as the Britisi  
orders have made the degree of France, dc  
daring, contraiy to the law of nations, th  
British islands in a state blockade, the imme­  
diate: foundation of their destructive warfare  
on our commerce, it belongs to the subject to  
remindyour government of the illtgal inter­  
rupti&#x27;Qns and spoliations suffered, previous to  
that decree by &#x27; the neutral co&#x27;mrrietce of the  
United States , under the proceedings of Bri  
tish ciuizers and courts, and - for the most  
f it in const quence. of express &#x27;orders of the  
government itself. Omitting proofs of inferior  
Bfej I refer to the &#x27;extensive aggressions 6n  
tlie trade of the United -States&#x27;, four.dv.-d on jhe  
4lca of blockades, never legally established  
according to recognized definitions ; to the  
still ffiore extensive violations of our cbm­  
.lacrre with ports of her enemies, not pre-,  
tentted to be in a state &#x27;bf blocke ; and to  
tiie Biitish order rof couneif issued: near the  
tommencetnent of the fcxiking Van This  
crder, besides its general interposition against  
tiie established law of nations, is distinguish­  
tel by a special ingredient,, violating that law  
asttxognised dy tht course of decisions in the  
British courts. , It subjects to capture and  
tende-.r.nation all neutral Vessels, jretumin g  
-Vrtli lawfuLcargoes, oti the- sole consiutra

IF trve commerceof the United States could  
tlicrjfofe in any ease be reasona&quot;u!y made the  
victim and the sport of. niutual charges and  
&#x27;e;r; ouches between belligerent partus, with  
Jeec&#x27;r to the priority of their atrraessions on

ntr adversary, m support ot the allega­  
which she founds her retaliating edicts

But the United States are o-iven to; under

sidered as enhanced by.its being a delation  
in favor pf the United States&#x27; from the ancient  
and established principle of maritime law pro­  
hibiting altogether &quot;such an intercourse in time  
of war. 1 &#x27;. I -&quot;&#x27;&quot;r- .  
. &quot;urely, ir, your govetnlnent in assuming  
ihis principle in such .terms in relation to the&quot;  
U States, must hav forgotten their repeated  
and formal protests against it. as these are  
to be found in the; discussions and cornmuni­  
cations of their rninisters at Loudon, as well  
as in explanations occasionally made on that  
subject to the British representatrve here  
But permit me to askrmore particularly, how  
it could have happenea that the principle i$;  
characterised as an ancient and established  
one. I put the qustionthe more freely, be­  
cause it .jiasJneveT been denied that the prin­  
ciple, as assei ted by.&#x27; youP government, was  
for the firsts time tntroduQed duriwg the war  
of 1756. It is in fact invariably rited and de­  
scribed in all judicial and other fRcial  
transactions &quot; as the rule of 1756.&quot; It can  
have no .pretension therefore to the title of  
an ancient rule.  
  
, But instead of being an established rule or  
principle, it is well known that Great Britain  
is the only nation that has acted upon, or o­  
therwise given a sanction to it. Nay,&#x27;it is  
not even an established principle in the prac­  
tice of Great Britain .herself. When first ap­  
plied in thewor of 1756, the legality of a  
neutral trade with the enemy&#x27;s colonies was  
not contested by it. In certain cases only  
6f the colonial trade, the allegation was, that  
the presumjtive evidence arising from cir­  
cumstances apjuinst the bona fide neutrality  
of the ownership, justified the condemnation  
as of eriemy&#x27;s property. If the rule of con­  
demnation was afterwards during the Nvaiv  
converted into the principle now&#x27; asstrled, it  
could not possibly&#x27; have been in operation in  
ils new shape more than a very few years.  
During the succeeding war of 1778, it is  
admitted by every British -authority that the  
principle was never brought into, operation.  
It may be regarded, in fact, as having been  
silently-abandoned ; &quot;and within the period  
of war since its commencement in 1793,  
the manner in which the principle has been  
alternately ccntracjtedChd extended, explain-,  
ed, sometimes hf one wuyj sometimes in ano-1  
thfer, rested vioij, this &#x27; Inundation, now on  
that, is no secret to those who have attended  
to its history and progress in the- British or-&#x27;  
ders of council and the British courts of admi­  
ralty. - ,v  
-With the exception, thereforeot a period,  
the last in modern times ffom w.hich authentic  
precedent of maritime law will be drawn,  
througheut which the United States; more in­  
terested in the&#x27; question that any other nation,  
have uniformly cfembatted the innovation, the  
principle has not in the British tribunals been  
in operation for a longer ttrm than three, four  
or five years, whilst in no. others ha! it evsr  
made its appearance but CoTeteivc a decision  
protesting .against it. &#x27; - .  
Such is the antiquity and such the aV.h­  
rity of a principle, the deviatieris from which  
are held -6ut as so many favors consoling  
the United States&quot; for -the wide spread d-.  
suuctioh of , theif legitimate corntnerce.  
Wirat must be said as to the other ex­  
ceptions which seem to have been viewed as  
claims on the gratkuSe pf the United Siates  
Itis, an indultnce t them in carrying , on  
their trade with the Whole continent of Europe,  
to be ljtid under tin; necessity of going first  
to a British port, to accept a British license­  
and to pay a tribute .to the. British Exchequer,  
as if we ha J &quot;been reduced tp the culonial si­  
tuation which once imposed these monpliz­  
ing&quot; restraints ? v ;  
What again must b; said as to Other fea­  
tures which we See&#x27;blended oti. the face of  
these regulations ? If the policy1, of them be  
to subject an enemy to privations, why re  
channels opened fofa British trede with them,  
uhichare shut ;oT neutratirade ? If in  
ther cases, the re.;ij object be to adroit a heu:  
- tral trade with the ene.my, why; is it required  
that neutral vesselsshaHperform&#x27;tite ceremony  
of. passing through a British port, when it can  
have no imaginable effect but the known and  
inevitable one f prohibitjlig the admission  
of the trade into the port of destination ? .  
I will not ask: why a primary article of our  
productions and exports, cotton i wool? isT6  
be distinguishett, irrits transit, by heay ,mv  
post hot imposed oii other articles, because it  
is fr&amp;nkfy avowed, in your explanatipn of the  
orders, to&#x27;be intended as an encouragement  
to British manufactures, and a check to the  
rival ones of France? I suppress also, though  
without the same reason for.1t, the enquiry,  
why less rigorous restrictrictions &#x27; arelappjied  
to the trade of the.Barbary powers &#x27; than are  
-enforced against that of a nation, sucli as the  
r United tatesVand in relatipnv suchas have  
existed between theni and Great Britain I  
  
l cannot now ever pass wuuuuu ounce, iu  
  
tions purely domestic in both, and strictly  
analogous i ip principle to the . regulations inu.  
the commercial ,code of Great-Britain is made  
a caust of capture on the high seas, and of  
Condemnation in her maritime courts. . Ip the  
othar order, the sale of a merchant ship by a  
belligerent owner to a.neutral, altho a trans  
  
action as legal when fair, as a dealing iir any  
  
ovner arucie, is conacmnea oy a general rule,  
without anv.ato.rn of proof or of presumtiori,  
  
that the transfer in the particular case is frau­  
dulent, and the property , therefore left in an  
enemy. v -4  
In fine, sir, the President Sees in the edicts  
communicated by rou, facts&#x27;&quot; assumedrwhlch  
  
did not exist,-principles asserted which never  
can be admitted ; andunder the name of re­  
taliation, measures transcendmg the limits

as if both&#x27; were as correct as they are unfound­  
ed. He sees moreover in tht modifications of  
this system, regulations violating equally bur  
neutjral rights Scom; national sovereignty. He  
persuades himself therefore that your govern,  
meat, will see in the justice of the observations  
now made in addition to those I had the honor  
verbally to state to you in the. first instance,  
that the United&quot; States are well warranted in  
looking for a speedy revocation of a system  
which is every day augmenting the mass of

tish isles in a state of blockade, to De enror­  
ced if you please against .the neutral com­  
merce of the United States on the high seas,  
according to the faculty, possessed for the,  
  
purpose. As tar as it was actuary eniorceo,

that it could and would be enforced, it waa  
an hyury to Great-Britain, for which let it

of their neutral rights. So far from it, that  
the order stands tf-condemned as a measure  
of retaliation, , by expressly stating that the  
  
fleets of France and her allies, instead of  
  
being able to enforce the blockade of the Bri  
  
&#x27; tiih Wes, i were themselves confined , to their  
wrrports by the entire suncrioritY of the

the principle, .&quot;as asserted by &#x27;youy gotern­  
ment, was for the first lime Introduced during  
the war of 1736. It is In fact Invariably cU  
  
ted and described in all judicial and other offi

can ha ve no pretension therefore to the title of  
  
an flornrwle,;3&#x27;&#x27;-t:.-;&amp;.;-  
  
Aod instead of being an tttabluhtd rule or

therwiae riven a sanction to it. -Nay, it Is  
  
not even an cstabl&#x27;uhed priac&#x27;rple la the prac­  
tice of Great-Bnuin herself. When first  
applied in the war of. 1756, the lepUity of a  
neutral trade with enemy&#x27;s colonics was not  
contested by it. &#x27; In certain cases only of the  
  
colonial trade, the allegation was, that the  
presumptive evidence arising from eircun  
  
stances against the bona fide neutrality &quot;of the  
ownership justiScd the condemnation as of e-  
  
nemy&#x27;a property. . If the rule of condemna  
  
tion, was .afterwards, during that war,&#x27; con  
  
verted into the principle now asserted, it  
could not possibly have been in operation in  
its new shape, more than a very few years.

Sir—Having laid before the prdWcut your letter of  
the 23d of February, explaining the character of cer­  
tain Britilh orders council iil&#x27;ued in November laft,  
I proceed to communicate the obfervations and repre­  
Jentations which will raanifeft to the government the*  
fentiments of the prefident on fo deep a violation of  
the commerce and rights ot the U. S. 1 hof$ orders  
interdict to neutral nations, or rather the United States,  
now the only commercial nation in a (fate ot neutral­  
ity, all commerce with the enemies of Great Britain,  
now nearly the whole commercial world, with certain  
exceptions only, and under certain regulations, but  
too evidently falhioned to the commercial, the manu­  
facturing, and the fifeal policy of Great Britain ; and  
on that account the more derogatory from the honor  
and independence of neutral nations.  
The orders are the more calcuiated to excite furprize  
:r the United States as they have difregarded the re­  
m on ft ranees conveyed in my letters ot the 20th and  
-29th of March, 1807, againft another order of coun­  
cil iffiied on a fimilar plea, in the month of January,  
1807. io thofe juft remonftrances, no anfwer indeed  
was ever given ; wbilft the order has been continued  
in its pernicious operation againft the lawful com­  
merce of the united States, and we now find added to  
it others, inftituting ftill more ruinous depredations,  
without even the addition of any new pretext ; and  
when moreover it is notorious that the order of Janu­  
ary was of a nature greatly to over ballance in its ef­  
fects anv injuries to Great Britain that could be appre­  
hended from the illegal operation of the French de­  
crees on which the order was to retaliate, had that de­  
cree in its illegal operation been atfually applied to  
the United States, and been acquiefctd in by them.  
The laft orders, like thofe of January, proceed on  
the mod unfubftantial foundation. They affume for  
fa&amp; an acquiefcence of the United States in an unlaw­  
ful application to them of the French decree : and  
they aiiume for a principle that the right of retaliation,  
accruing to one belligerent againft &lt;1 neutral, through  
whom an injury is done by another belligerent, is not  
to have for its meafure that of the injury received,  
but may be exercifed in any extern, and under any  
modifications, which might fuit the pleafure or the  
the policy of the complaining party.  
The fa&amp;, fir, is unequivocally difowned. It is not  
true that the United States have acquidced in an ille­  
gal operation of the French decrees ; nor is it even  
true that at the date of the Briufii orders, November  
11, a fingie application of that decree to the commerce  
of the United States on the high leas can be prefumed  
to have been known to the Britiih government.  
Tlv French decree in quefiion has two di&#x27;tinft af­  
pe£U,one clearly importing an intended operation with­  
in the territorial limits as a local law ; the other ap­  
apparently importing an intended operation on the  
v : _L r_ _  
  
Under the firft afpcft, the decree, however other­  
v&#x27;fe objevb enable, cannot be faid to have violated the  
ncurr-ity of the United States. if the governing  
powers cVthe continent ot Kurope choofe to exclude  
from their ports Bririfh property *r Britifh |»rodue­  
v x r o utral veflek proceeding from BritHh ports,  
G i? an act of fovereignty which the United States  
kav* r. : * * Vi t to controvert* The fame fovereignty is  
e: i . . Great Britain at all times, in peace as  
’ i aar, towards her friends as well as her ene­  
; . Her ilitute bookprefents a thoufand illuffrations.  
.1 1 o:i!v. therefore, under the other afped of the  
1 , -x v ihat it can have violated neutral rights ; and  
ihi-, would have refulted from its execution on the  
l:;h feas, whether or not the pretext of a nominal  
blockade, or with a view to enforce a domestic regula­  
tion againft foreign veiie4s, not within the domett ic  
preciuds, but under the authority and protection of  
the law of nations,  
Had then the French decree been executed on the  
high leas, againft the commerce ot the United States  
with Great Britain, and have the United States ac­  
quicfceJ in the unlawful and injurious proceeding ?  
I ft ate, fir, on undeniable authority, that the firft in  
inftance which that decree was put in force againlt the  
a; neutral rights of the lT. S, was that of the Horizon, an  
1 American fhip bound from Great Britain to Lima,  
wrecked within the territorial jurildidion ol France,  
hut condemned under an expofuion of the decree ex­  
tending to the high leas its opeiation againtt neutrals.  
! This judicial deciiion took place as late as the 16th day  
  
of O&amp;ober, 1807, and^as not officially known to  
the minider plcnipotentia^bf the U. S. at Paris, t&#x27;A  
fome time in November. At thk date therefore of the  
firlt order of Great Britain, no injury whatever had  
been done to her, through an aggrelfion on the com­  
merce of the United States. No preemption even  
had been futficiently authorized, that the exprefs ftip­  
uiations in the treaty of France with the United States  
would not exempt their conflnerce at lead from the  
operation of any edid incompatible with them. At  
the date even of the late or.lm of Nov. 11, it appears  
that the only aggreffion which had then occurred, was  
pretty certainly unknown to the Britifli government,  
and could therefore have had no fhare in producing  
&gt; this alledged retaliation.  
To this fa£t that the fhip Horizon was the fird that  
occurred of an execution of the French decree on the  
high feas, l am able to add, that as late a&gt; the 30th of  
November, no other cafe had been brought inro the  
French court of prizes. From accounts which have  
lately appeared, it is more than probable that unlawful  
captures by French cruifers have fince taken place,  
but it remains to be known whether they are to be re­  
ferred to the concurrence of the French government  
in the judgment pronounced in the cafe of the Hori­  
zon,* or not rather to a French decree of the 17th  
t)ec. lad, profefiing to be a retaliation on the Britifli  
orders of November it.  
I date with equal confidence, that at no time have  
the United States acquiefced in violations of their  
neutral rights injurious to Great Britain, or any other  
belligerent nation. So far were they in particular,  
from acquicfcing in the French Decree of November  
1806, that the moment it was known to their minider  
at Paris, he calie I for an explanation of its meaning in  
relation to the United States which were favorable,  
and uncontradi&amp;ed by the adual operation of the de­  
| cree : that he fteadily watched over the proceedings  
under it, with a readinefs to interpofe againd any un­  
lawful extenfion ot them to the commerce of the  
United States ; that no time was lad, after the decree  
came to the knowledge of the government here, in  
| giving him proper inftjpttiorw on^the fubje£t ; that he  
! was equally prompt on receiving the decifion of the  
i court in the cafe of the Horizon, in prefenting to the  
French government a reraondrance in terms which  
can never be cenfured for a defeft of energy; and  
that by the hrd opportunity after that decifion reach­  
{ ed the prefident, the particular indru&amp;ions required  
| by it, were forwarded to that ininifler,v Nor is it to  
be forgotten, that previous to the Britifh orders of  
November, it had been explicitly communicated to  
: the Britifli government by the American minider at ,  
f London, that explanations uncontradi&amp;ed by any  
! overt a€t had been given to our minider at Paris, 1

Got be put in force againft the United States, and that  
communication was repeated to the Britifh govern- ;  
ment immediately on the publicatioi^of thofe orders, i  
What more could have been required on the part  
of thf* U. States to obviate retaliating pretenfions of ,  
any fort on the part of Great-Britain ? Retaliations are !  
meafures of rigor in all cafes. Where they are to op­  
erate though a third and involuntary party, they will j  
never be haftily retorted !o by a magnanimous or a juft  
power ; which will always allow to the third party,  
its right to difcufs the merits of the cafe, and will nev­  
er permit itfelf to enforce its meafures, without afford­  
ing a reafonable time for the ufc of rcafonable means  
for fubftituting another remedy. What would be the  
fituation of neutral powers, if the firft blow levelled thro  
them by one belligerent againft another, was to leave  
them no choice, but between the retaliating vengeance  
of the latter, and an inftant declaration of war againft  
the former ? Reafon revolts againft this as the foie al­  
ternative. The United States could no more be bound  
to evade the Britifh orders by an immediate war with  
France, than they were bound to atone for the burning  
of the French fhip of war on the fhore of Northcarolina,  
by an immediate refort to arms againft Creat-Britain.  
With refpeft to the principle affumed by the Brififti  
orders, it is perfe&amp;ly clear that it could not juftify  
them in the extent given to their operation, if the fa&amp;s,  
crroneoufly affumed, could have been fully fuftained.  
Retaliation is a fpecific or equivalent return of inju­  
ry for injury received—and where it is to operate  
through the interefts of a third party having no volun­  
tary participation in the injury received, the return  
ought,as already obferved, to be inflicted with the moft  
forbearing hand.  
This is the language of common fenfe and the clear­  
ed. equity. As the right to retaliate refults merely  
from the wrong fuffered, it cannot in the nature of  
things extend beyond the extent of the fufFering.-~ ;  
| There may often be a difficulty in applying this rule  
with exactnels, and a reafonable latitude may be allow­  
able on that confideratiou. Bui a m an i felt and ex­  
I -&quot; &#x27; ■ / v/1, &#x27;X  
  
ftJJpRfl!5S!5!HSH^S5S?5HBC­  
.travagant departure form the rule can find no apology.  
&#x27; What then is the extent of the injury experienced  
by Great-Britain form the meafures of her enemies*  
fo far as the operation of thofe meafures through the  
i United States, can render them in any fente refponfibte.  
A mere declaration by a belligerent, without inten­  
tion or the means to carry it into effect, againft the  
rights and obligations of a neutral nation, and thence  
againft the inter cits of another belligerent,could afford  
no pretext to the latter to retaliate at the expence of  
the neutral. The declaration might give juft offence  
t &gt; the neutral, but it would belong to him alone to de­  
cide on the courfe preienbed by the refpeCt &quot;he owed  
to himfelf. No real damage having accrued to the  
belligerent, no indemnity could accrue.  
For the fame reafon a declaration of a belligerent,  
which he is known to be either not in a fituation, or  
not to intend, to carry but partially into execution a­  
gainft a neutral, to the injury of another belligerent,  
could never give more than a right togk eommenfurate  
redrefs againft the neutral. All m&amp;lming unexecut­  
ed and evidently not to be execut^Jfts merely oftenfi­  
ble, working no injury to any, utnefs ft be in the dif­  
refped to the neutral, to whom alone it belongs to re­  
fent or difregard i% *  
Bring the cafe befefre us to this plain and equitable  
teft. The French decree of November, 1806, under­  
took to declare the Britifh ifles in a ftate of blockade,  
to be enforced, if you pleaie, againft the neutral com­  
merce of the United States on the hi^h leas, according  
to the faculty poffeffed for the purpoie. As fa * as it  
was a&amp;uallv enforced, or an tffeft refulted from an  
apprehenfion that it could mid would be enforced, it  
was an injury to Great-Britain, for which let it be luppo­  
fed the United States were anfwerable. O11 the other  
hand, as far as it was nc/t enforced, and evidently either  
would not or could not be enforced, no injujy was ex­  
perienced by G. Britain and no remedy could lie againft  
the United States. Now, fir, it never was preter ded  
that at the date of the full Britifh order iffued in Jan­  
uary, 1807, any injury had accrued to, or was appre­  
hended by Great-Britain from an execution of the  
French decree againft the commerce of the United  
States, on the theatre of their neutral rights. So far  
from it that the order ftands felt condemned as a mea-’  
fure of retaliation, by exprefsly dating that the fleers  
of France and her allies, inftead of being able to on­  
force the blockade of the Britifh ifles, were themfelv 5  
confined to their own ports by the edtire fuperioriry &lt; r  
the Britifh navy : converting thus, by the it ranged of  
reafoning, the fecurity of G. Britain againft injury  
from the French decree, into a title to commit injury  
on a neutral party. In the November orders alfo,  
while it is admitted that the French decree could not  
but be imperfectly executed for want of means, it is  
afferted that file intention of the French decree, and  
not the injury accruing from its operation through the  
commerce of the United States,!* the fcale by which  
the retaliating injury againft them is to be meafured,  
Such are the pretexts and fuch the principles on  
which one great branch of the lawful commerce of this  
country became a victim to the fir ft Britifh order, and  
cn which the laft orders are now fweeping from the  
ocean all its moft valuable remains.  
Againft fuch an unprecedented fyftem of yrarfare on  
neutral rights and national independence, the common  
judgment and common feelings of mankind mult for­  
  
ever proteft.  
I touch, fir, with reluctance the queilion on which  
of the belligerent Tides the invafiozt of neutral rights  
had its origin. As the U. States do riot acquiefce in  
thefe invafions by either,there could be no plea for in­  
volving them in the controverfy. But as the Bririfh  
orders have made the decree of France, declaring, con­  
trary to the law of nations, the Britiffc iflands in a date  
of blockade, the immediate foundation of their de­  
ftru&amp;ive warfare on our commerce, it belongs to the  
fubjed to remind your government of the illegal inter­  
ruptions and fpoliations futferei, previous to that de­

It the commerce of she United States

of mutual charges and k proaches be­

ating edicts a^ a in ft our commerce.  
but the United States are given to  
undedfaml that the Biitifh govern­  
ment has, as a proof of its indulgent  
and amicable dilpoution towards  
them, mitigated the authorifed rigor  
it might have given to its meafures,  
by certain exceptions peculiarly fa­  
,\oranto to the commercial imerefts of  
the United States.  
I forbear, lir, to exprtfs all the  
emotions with which 1&#x27;uch a language,  
on fuch an occation, is calculated to  
infpire a nation which cannot for a  
moment be unconlcious of its rights,  
nor miftaks for an alleviation of  
wrongs, regulations, to admit the val­  
idity of which would be to ailume  
badges of humiliation never worn by  
xn independent power.  
The ffrft of thefe indulgences is a  
commercial intercourfe with the de­  
pendencies of the enemies of Great­  
er itain, and it is coplidered as en­  
hanced by its being a deviation in  
favor of the United States from the  
aiuunt and eftablifhed principle of  
nv.iratime law prohibiting altogether  
fueh an intercourfe in time or war.  
Surely, fir, your government in af­  
l&#x27;uming this principle in fuch terms  
in relation to the Umtift* States,  
muft have forgotten ttfcir repeated  
and formal protefts againft it, as thefe  
are to be found in their&#x27; difeuffions  
and communications of their minifter  
at London, as well as in explanations  
c cc a iion.il ly made on that fubjeft to  
the Britilh reprefentative here. But  
permit me to alk, more particularly,  
how it could have happened that the  
principle is characterised as an ancient  
and cltabiiflied one. I put tbe quef­  
tion the more freely, becaufe it has  
never been denied that the principle,  
as afllrted by your government, was  
for the fir ft time introduced during  
he war of 1756. It is in fa£t inva­  
riably cited and defer!bed in all judi­  
cial and other official trahfaaions  
u as the rule of 1756.” I: can have  
no pretenfiou therefore to the title of  
  
in ancieut rule.  
And inftead of being an eflablijled  
rule or ptinciple, it is welt known  
that Great-Britain is the only nation  
that has a&lt;5ted upon, or otherwise giv­  
en a fanchon to ir. Nay, it is not  
even an eftablifhrd principle in the  
practice of Great-Britain herfeif.—  
When firft applied in* the war of  
1756, the legality of neutral trade  
with enem ’s colonics was not contef­  
ted by it. In xertain cafes only of  
tiie colonial trade, the allegation was  
that the presumptive evidence arifing  
from circu. &#x27;.ranees againft the bona  
tide neutrality of tills ownerfhip iufti­  
tied the condemnation as of enemy’s  
property. If the rule of condemna­  
tion was afterwards, during that war,  
convened into the principle now af­  
terted, it could not poflibly have been  
in operation in its new ihape, more  
than a very few years. Duriug the  
fucceeding war of 1778, it is admit­  
ted by every Britilh authority, that  
the principle was never brought into  
operation. It may be regarded, in  
fafl as having been filently abandon­  
ed } and within the period of war  
iince its commencement in 1793, the  
manner in which the principle has  
been alternately contracted and ex­  
tended, explained fometimes in cne  
way, fometimes in another, retail  
now on this foundation, now on  
  
tnar, is no iccrct to thole who have  
attended to its hiftory and progreis  
in the Britiih Orders of Council and  
the Britilh courts of admiralty.  
When the exception, therefore, ol  
a period, the tail in modem time  
from which authentic precedents o  
maritime taw will be drawn, anc  
throughout which the United State:  
more incereded in the &lt;$u:ition that  
*»/ other nation, have uniformly  
combated the innovation, the pr:nci  
p!e has not in the Britilh trinunal:  
been in operation for a longer terrr  
than three, four or five years, wh&#x27;dilir  
do othus lias it ever made its appear­  
ance but to receive a dechion proteft­  
»ng agaird it.  
Shch s &#x27;be antiquity and fuck the  
authority of J pripctpi-*, the d-vta.  
  
tions from v/Iiich arc held out as fo  
many favors ronfoling the United  
States for the wide fpread deftruCtion  
{exceptions, which feem to have  
j been viewed as claims on the grati­  
tude of the T nired States ? Is it an  
indulgence to uem in carrying on  
their trade with the whole continent  
of Europe, to be laid under the ne­  
ceffity of going firft to a Britifli port  
to accept a Britifh licence and to pay  
a tribute to the Britifh exchequer, as  
if we had been reduted to the colo­  
nial fituation which once impofed  
thefe monopolizing reftraints ?  
What a^ain mult be laid as to oth­  
w  
er features which we fee blended on  
the face of thefe regulations ? If the  
policy of them be to fubjeft an enemy  
to privations, why are channels open­  
| ed for a Britifh trade with them,  
which are (hut to a neutral trade ? —  
If in other cafes, the real object be  
to admit a neutral trade with the  
enemy, why is it required that neu­  
tral veffete ihall perform the ceremo­  
ny of palling through a Britifh port  
when it can have no imaginable ef­  
fect, but the known and inevitable  
one of prohibiting the admiflionof the  
trade into the port of deitination ?  
I will not alk why a primary arti­  
cle of our productions and exports,  
cotton wool, is to be diftinguifhed,  
in its tranfit, by a heavy impoit not  
impofed on other articles, becaufe it  
is frankly avowed, in vour explana­  
tion of the orders, to be intended as  
an encouragement to Britiih manu­  
factures, and a check to the rival ones  
of France ? 1 fupprefs alfo tho*  
without the fame reaion for it, the  
enquiry, why lets rigorous reftri&amp;ions  
are applved to the trade of the Barbary  
powers, than arc enforced a&amp;ainlt  
that of a nation, Inch as the United  
States, and in relations luch as have  
exifted between them and Great­  
Britain.  
I cannot however pafs without no­  
tice, the very unwarrantable innova­  
tion contained in the two Lift of the  
orders. In one of them a certificate  
of the local origin of a cargo, altho’  
permitted in the port of deitination,  
by regulations purely domeftic in  
both, and ftriCtly analogous in prin­  
ciple to the regulations in the com­  
  
merci.il code ot O- liritain, is made a  
caufe of capture on the high leas, and  
of condemnation in her maritime  
courts. In the other, the falc of a  
merchant lliip by a belligerent owner  
to a neutral although a tranlaction as  
legal when fair, as a dealing in any  
other article, is condemned by a gen­  
. eral rule, w ithout an atom of proof  
or of prclumption, that the transfer  
in the particular cafe is fraudulent  
and the property therefore left in an  
enemy.  
In fine, fir, the Prefident fees in the  
edicts communicattd by yon fads af­  
umeu which did not exifi, principles  
afferted which never can be admit­  
ted ; and, under the name of rctalia­

Mr. Mavisow’s Letter to Mr. Ensxing.  
  
( Concluded. )  
Such are the pretexts and such the principles on  
which one great branch of the lawful commerce  
of this country became a victim to the first British  
order, and on which the last orders are now sweep-  
ing from the ocean ail its most valuable remains.  
Against such an unprecedented system of war-  
  
fare on neutral rights and national independence,  
  
the common judgment and common feelin~s of  
  
Mankind must forever protest.  
  
I torch, sir, with veluctance, the question on  
which the belligerent sides the invasion of neutral  
riguts had irs origin. As the United States do not  
acqtiesce in these invasions by either, there could  
be no plea for involving them in the controversy.  
Mut as the British orders have made the decree of  
France, declaring, contrary to the law of nations,  
the British islands in a state of blockade, the im-  
mediate foundation of their destructive warfare on  
our commerce, it belongs to the subject to remind  
your government of the illegal interruptions and  
Spoliations suffered previous to that decree, by the  
neutral commerce of the United States, under the  
Proceedings of Briiish crvisers and Courts, and for

ne ll  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
the most part in consequence of express orders of  
the government itself. Omirting proofs of inferi-  
or note, I refer to the extensive aggressions on the  
trade of the Unired States, founded on the plea of  
blockades, never legally established according to  
recoznized definitione—to the still more extensive  
violation of our commerce with ports of her ene-  
mies, not pretended to be in a state of blockade,  
and tothe British order of council issued near the  
commencement of the existing war. This order,  
besides its general interpclation against the estav-  
lished laws of nations, is distinguished by a spe-  
cigl ingred’ent violating law as recognized by the  
course of decisions in the British courts. It sub-  
jects to capture and condemnation ali neutral ves-  
sels returning with lawful cargoes, on the sole con-  
sideration that they had in their outward voyage  
deposited contraband of war ata hostile port. If  
the commerce of the U. States could therefore in  
any case be reasonably made the victim and the  
sport of mutual charges and reproaches between  
belligerent parties, with respect to the priority of  
their aggressions on neutral commerce, Great-Bri-  
tain must look beyond the epoch she has chosen  
for iliega! acts of her adversary, in suppert of the  
allegation on which she founds her retaliating e-  
dicts against our commerce,  
  
But the United States are given to understand  
that the British government has, as a proof of its  
indulgent and amicable disposition towards them,  
mitigated the authorized rigor it might have given  
to its measures, by certain exceptions peculiarly  
favorable to the commercial interests of the Uni-  
tect States.  
  
I forbear, sir, to express all the emotions with  
which such a language, on such an occasion, is cal-  
culated to inspire a nation which cannot for a mo-  
ment be unconscious of its rights, nor mistake for  
an alleviation of wrongs regulations to admit the  
validity of which would be to assume badges of  
humiliation never worn by an independent power.  
  
The first of these indulgencies is a commercial  
intercourse with the dependencies oi the enemies  
ef Great-Britain, and it is considered as enhanced  
by its being a deviation in favor of the United  
States from the ancient and established principle  
of maritime law, prohibiting such an intercourse  
in time of war.  
  
Surely, sir, your gavernment in assuming this  
principle in such terms in relation to the United  
States, must have forgotten their repeated and for-  
mal protests against it, as these are to be found in  
the discussions and communications ef their mi-  
nister at London, as wel! as in explanations occa-  
sionally made on that subject tothe British repre-  
sentative here. But permit me to ask more parti-  
cularly, how it could have happened that the prin-  
ciple 1s characterised as an ancient and established  
one. I put the question the more freely, because  
it has never been denied that the principle, as as-  
sumed by your government, was for the first time  
intreduced during the war of 1756. ‘It is in fact  
invariably cited and described in all judicial and o-  
ther official transactions ¢ as the ru&#x27;e of 1756.’ It  
can have no pretension therefore tothe title of an  
ancient rule.  
  
And instead of being an established rule or prin-  
ciple, it is well known that Great-Britain is the  
‘only nation that has acted upon, or otherwise gi-  
ven sanctiontoit. Nay itis not even an estab-  
lished principle in the practice of Great-Britain  
herself. When first applied in the war of 1756,  
the legality of a neutral trade with enemy’s colo-  
nies was not contested by it. Iu certain cases on-  
ly of the colonial trade, the allegation was, that  
the presumptive evidence arising from circumstan-  
ces against the bonafide neutrality of the owner-  
ship justified the condemnation as of enemy’s pro-  
perty. If the rule of condemnation was after-  
wards, during the war, converted into the princi-  
p-€s now asserted, it could not possibly have been  
in operation in its new shape more than a very  
few years. During the succeeding war of 1778, it  
is adinitred by every British authority that the prin-  
ciple was never brought into operation. It may  
be regarded, in fact, as having been silently aban-  
doned ; and within the period of war since its  
  
commencement in 1798, the manner in which the  
  
principte has been alternately contracted and ex-  
tended, explained sometimes in one way, some-  
times in another, rested now on this foundation,  
now on that, is no secret to those who have atten

edto its history and progress in the British orders  
of council and the British courts of admiralty.  
  
With the exception, therefore, of a period the  
last in modern times from which authentic prece-  
dents of maritime law wiil be drawn, and through.  
out which the United States more interested in  
the question than any other nation, have uritorm.  
ly combated the innovaticn, the principle has not  
in the British tribunals been in operation for a lon.  
ger term than three, four or five years, whilst ia  
no other has it ever made its anpearance but to re.  
ceive a decision protesting against it.  
  
Such is the antiquity and such the authority of a  
principle, the deviations from which are held out  
as So many favors consoling the United States for  
the wide spread destruction of their legitimate  
commerce.  
  
W hat must be said as to the other exceptions,  
which seem to have been viewed as claims on the  
gratitude of the United States? Is it an indul-  
gence to them in Carrying on their trade with the  
whole continent of Europe, to be laid unde the  
necessity of going first to a British port, to accept  
a British licence and to pay a tribute to the British  
Exchequer, as if we had been reduced to the colo-  
nial situation which once imposed these monopoli-  
zing restraints ?  
  
What again must be said as to other features  
which we sce blended on the face of these regula-  
tions ? Ifthe policy of them be to subject an ene-  
my to privaiions, why are channels open for a  
British trade with them which are shut to a neu-  
tral trade? If in other cases, the real object be to  
admit a neutral trade with the enemy, why is it  
required that neutral vessels shall perform the  
ceremony of passing through a British port, when  
it can have no imaginable eifect but the known and  
inevitable one of prohibiting the admission of the  
trade into the port of destination ?  
  
I will not ask why a primary article of our pro-  
ductions and exports, cotton wool, is to be distin-  
guished in its transit by a heavy impost not impos-  
ed on other articles, becatfSe it is frankly avowed,  
in your explanation of the orders, to be intended  
as an encouragement to British manufacture, and  
a check to the rival onesof France? I suppress al-  
so, thovgh without the same reason for :t, the en-  
quiry why less rigorous restrictions are epplied to  
the trade of the Barbary powers than are enforced  
against that of a nation, such as the United States  
and in relations such as have existed between them  
and G. Britain?  
  
I cannot however pass without notice, the very  
unwarrantable innovation contained in the two last  
of the orders. In one of them a certificate of the  
local origin of a cargo, although permitted in the  
port of departure and required in the port of desti-  
nation by regulations purely domestic in both and  
strictly analagous in principle to the regulations in  
the commercial code of Great Britain 1s madea  
cause of capture on the high seas, and of condem-  
nation in her maritime, courts. In the other or-  
der, the sale of a merchant ship by a beligerent  
owner to aneutral, although @ transaction as legal!  
when fair, as a dealing in any other article, 1s con~-  
demned by a general rule, without an atom Of  
proof or presumption, that the transfer in the par-  
ticular case is fraudulent and the property there-  
fore lett in an enemy.  
  
In fine, sir, the President sees in the edicts  
communicated by you, facts assumed which never  
can be admitted; and underthe name of retandtion  
measures transcending the limits reconcileable with  
the facts and the principle, as if both were as Cor  
rect as they were unfounded. He sees morcovet  
in the modifications of this system, reguiations v&#x27;-  
olating equally our neutral rights and our nations:  
sovereiguty. He persuades himself therefore that  
your government will sce inthe justice of the ob-

tined to England ; and he may either seques­  
ter oi confiscate such vessels of the United  
States as shall infract these laws after due  
promulgation and notice thereof ; but beyond  
this, the United States hope and believe that  
his majesty will not go.” And Mr. Madison,  
in his celebrated letter of March last to Mr.  
Erskine, defends the decree in the following  
manner:  
  
“ I he French decree has two distinct as­  
pects ; one clearly importing an intended o­  
peration within the territorial limits, as a local  
uuv ; the other apparently importing an inten­  
ded operation on the high sea?. Under the  
f.rst aspect, the decree however otherwise oi&gt;­  
jectionuble, cannot belaid to have &quot;&#x27;olaied the  
neutrality of the United Statin. If the gov­  
erning powers on the continent of Europe,  
choose to exclude from dreir ports, British  
property or British productions, or neutral  
vessels proceeding front British ports, it is an  
act of sovereignty, which the United States  
have no right to controvert.” “It is only,  
therefore, ur.d«.r the other aspect of the de­  
cree, that it can have violated neutral rights.
