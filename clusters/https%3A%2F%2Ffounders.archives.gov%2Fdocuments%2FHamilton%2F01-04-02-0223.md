[New York, March 19, 1788]  
  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
THE Administration of government, in its largest sense, comprehends all the operations of the body politic, whether legislative, executive or judiciary, but in its most usual and perhaps in its most precise signification, it is limited to executive details, and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department. The actual conduct of foreign negotiations, the preparatory plans of finance, the application and disbursement of the public monies, in conformity to the general appropriations of the legislature, the arrangement of the army and navy, the direction of the operations of war; these and other matters of a like nature constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the administration of government. The persons therefore, to whose immediate management these different matters are committed, ought to be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate; and, on this account, they ought to derive their offices from his appointment, at least from his nomination, and ought to be subject to his superintendence. This view of the subject will at once suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the executive magistrate in office, and the stability of the system of administration. To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor is very often considered by a successor, as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert; and, in addition to this propensity, where the alteration has been the result of public choice, the person substituted is warranted in supposing, that the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to his measures, and that the less he resembles him the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents. These considerations, and the influence of personal confidences and attachments, would be likely to induce every new president to promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations; and these causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous mutability in the administration of the government.  
With a positive duration of considerable extent, I connect the circumstance of re-eligibility. The first is necessary to give to the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part well, and to the community time and leisure to observe the tendency of his measures, and thence to form an experimental estimate of their merits. The last is necessary to enable the people, when they see reason to approve of his conduct, to continue him in the station, in order to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues, and to secure to the government, the advantage of permanency in a wise system of administration.  
Nothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more ill founded upon close inspection, than a scheme, which in relation to the present point has had some respectable advocates—I mean that of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time, and then excluding him from it, either for a limited period, or for ever after. This exclusion whether temporary or perpetual would have nearly the same effects; and these effects would be for the most part rather pernicious than salutary.  
One ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the inducements to good behaviour. There are few men who would not feel much less zeal in the discharge of a duty, when they were conscious that the advantages of the station, with which it was connected, must be relinquished at a determinate period, than when they were permitted to entertain a hope of obtaining by meriting a continuance of them. This position will not be disputed, so long as it is admitted that the desire of reward is one of the strongest incentives of human conduct, or that the best security for the fidelity of mankind is to make their interest coincide

arm instead of the positive merit of doing good.  
Another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to sordid views, to peculation, and in some instances, the usurpation. An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the offices, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed, while it lasted; and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory; though the same man probably, with a different prospect before him, might content himself with the regular perquisites of his station, and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of an abuse of his opportunities. His avarice might be a guard upon his avarice. Add to

y or his ambition.  
An ambitious man too, when he found himself seated on the summit of his country’s honors, when he looked forward to the time at which he must descend from the exalted eminence forever; and reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome reverse: Such a man, in such a situation, would be much more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power, at every personal hazard, than if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing his duty.  
Would it promote the peace of the community, or the stability of the government, to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the people like discontented ghosts, and sighing for a place which they were destined never more to possess?  
A third ill effect of the exclusion would be the depriving the community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief magistrate in the exercise of his office. That experience is the parent of wisdom is an adage, the truth of which is recognized by the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind. What more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations? Where more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate of a nation? Can it be wise to put this desirable and essential quality under the ban of the constitution; and to declare that the moment it is acquired, its possessor shall be compelled to abandon the station in which it was acquired, and to which it is adapted?

 themselves for doing it with a greater degree of utility.  
A fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men from stations, in which in certain emergencies of the state their presence might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or safety. There is no nation which has not at one period or another experienced an absolute necessity of the services of particular men, in particular situations, perhaps it would not be too strong to say, to the preservation of its political existence.

! Without supposing the personal essentiality of the man, it is evident that a change of the chief magistrate, at the breaking out of a war, or at any similar crisis, for another even of equal merit, would at all times be detrimental to the community; inasmuch as it would substitute inexperience to experience, and would tend to unhinge and set afloat the already settled train of the administration.  
A fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be, that it would operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration. By necessitating a change of men, in the first office in the nation, it would necessitate a mutability of measures. It is not generally to be expected, that men will vary; and measures remain uniform. The contrary is the usual course of things. And we need not be apprehensive there will be too much stability, while there is even the option of changing; nor need we desire to prohibit the people from continuing their confidence, where they think it may be safely placed, and where by constancy on their part, they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating councils and a variable policy.  
These are some of the disadvan

fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good will of people he might induce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint upon themselves, a provision which was calculated to debar them of the right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite. There may be conceived circumstances, in which this disgust of the people, seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favourite, might occasion greater danger to liberty, than could ever reasonably be dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office, by the voluntary suffrages of the community, exercising a constitutional privilege.  
There is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the people to continue in office men, who had entitled themselves, in their opinion, to approbation and confidence; the advantages of which are at best speculative and equivocal; and are over-balanced by disadvantages far more certain and decisive.

give the officer himself the inclination and the res?  
olution Id act his part well, and the community  
time and leisure to observe the tendency of his  
measures, and thence to form an experimental es?

THE ONE TERM PRINCIPLE.  
The idea of confining the President to  
one term was discussed at the adoption of  
the Constitution. The objections to it  
were clearly and forcibly stated in one of  
the numbers of the Federalist. It is not  
therefore a new subject, but one which en­  
gaged the earnest attention of the found­  
ers of our system of government, and was  
by them settled.  
  
The writer in the Federalist says of the  
one term principle, “Nothing appears  
more plausible at first sight, nor more ill  
founded upon close inspection.&quot; His ob­  
jections to it are numerous and weighty.  
They are as good now as then. His first  
objection is that the exclusion from a sec­  
ond term would be a diminution of the in­  
ducements to good behavior. The in

form his duties, and thus his motive to  
well-doing would be lessened.  
Secondly, the effect of exclusion would  
be temptation to sordid views, to pecula­  
tion, and in some instances to usurpation.  
An avaricious man would endeavor to  
make the most of his emoluments in the  
brief time allotted him ; an ambitious one  
would be tempted to prolong his power  
by usurpation, when he reflected that no  
merit on his part could prevent his de­  
scent from office at the close of his first  
  
term.

the experience of a President ? If limit­  
ation is best for one, why not for the  
other ?  
  
Fourthly, the objection which we urged  
in a former article is mentioned, the ban­  
ishing men from a station, in which, in  
certain emergencies of the Slate, their  
presence might be of the greatest moment  
to the public safety. This was well ex­  
emplified in the case of the re-election of I  
Abraham Lincoln. Had we been com­  
pelled at that critical juncture of national  
affairs to select a new candidate, and put  
an untried man in the Presidential chair,  
the difficulties of the national situation  
would have been vastly increased, and  
the end could not have been foreseen.  
This reason is of the gravest importance.  
We should be cautions how we fetter the  
popular choice. The intelligence of the  
people may be trusted to select their own  
officers ; if not government by the people  
Is a mistake.  
The fifth and last objection which the  
Federalist presents to the one term prin­  
ciple is, that it would operate as a con­  
stitutional interdiction of stability in the  
administration. A necessary change of  
men in the first office of the nation would  
necessitate mutability of measures. Men  
seldom are changed and measures remain  
uniform. Things are none too stable while  
there is even the possibility and option of  
changing. “Nor need we desire,” say

approve of his conduct, to continue him in the  
station, in order to prolong the utility of his  
talents and virtues, and to secure to the Gov.

wise system of administration.  
&quot;Nothing appears more plausible at first  
sight, nor more ill-founded upon close inspec

present point, has had some respectable advo  
cates. I mean that of continuing the Chief  
Magistrate in office a certain time and then ea­  
cluding him from it for a limited period or for­  
ever after. This exclusion, whether tempo­

his condnct, to continue him in the station, in order to prolong the n il.­  
ity of his talents and virtues, and to secure to the Government the ade­  
vantage of permanency in a wise syatem of administration. Nothing  
appears more plausible at first sight, nor more ill-founded upon clese in­  
spection, than a scheme which, in relation to the present point, has had  
some respectable advocates. I mean that of continning the Chief  
Macistrate in office a certain time and then ercluding him from it for a  
limited, eriod or forever after. This exclusion whether temporary of  
perpetual, would have nearly the same effect, and these effects kould be  
for the most part rather pernicious than salutarr.

Hamilton held that the exclusion of the  
chief magistrate, either for a limited period  
or forever, from again holding the office  
would have effects which would be for the  
  
most part rather . pernicious than salutary.  
  
One ill effect of this, exclusion he thought  
would be a diminution of the inducements to  
  
good behavior. There are few men, he  
  
wrote, who would not feel much lees zeal  
  
the discharge of a duty when they were con  
  
scious that the - advantages of the station  
  
ith which it was connected&#x27; &#x27;must be relin  
  
quished at a determinate period than when  
they were permitted to entertain a hope of  
  
obtaining, by meriting, a . continuance of  
  
them. - , , .

Another ill effect of the exclusion, said  
  
Hamilton, would be the temptation to sordid  
  
views, to peculation, and, in some instances,  
  
to usurpation. An avaricious man, who  
  
might happen to fill the office, looking for  
  
ward to a time when he must at all events  
yield up the advantages he enjoyed would  
  
feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by  
  
such a man, to make the best nse of -his op  
  
portunities while they lasted. An ambitious  
  
man too, finding himself seated on the sum  
  
mit of his country&#x27;s honors, looking forward  
  
to the time at which he must descend from  
  
the exalted eminence forever, and reflecting  
  
that no exertion of merit on his part could  
save him from the unwelcome reverse, would  
be much more violently tempted to embrace  
a favorable conjuncture for attempting  
  
the &#x27; prolongation of his power,  
  
at every personal hazard, than if he had the  
probability of answering the same end by  
doing his duty. Would it, also asked  
Hamilton, promote tjie peace of the commu  
  
nity, or the stability of the government, to  
have half a dozen men who had had credit  
enough to raise, themselves to the seat of the  
  
supreme magistracy wandering among the  
  
people, like discontented ghosts, and sighing  
  
for a place which they were destined never  
  
more to possess ?  
  
- Other ill effects noted by Hamilton which  
would result from the exclusion are : The  
depriving the community of the advantage  
  
of the experience gained by the chief magis­  
trate in the exercise of his office, the banish  
  
ing men from&#x27; stations in which, in certain  
emergencies of the State, their presence  
  
might be of the greatest moment to the pub­  
lic interest or safety ; that it would operate  
as a constitutional interdiction of stability in  
the administration, for by inducing the ne  
  
cessity of a change of men in the first office  
of the nation it would necessarily lead to a  
mutability of measures. And ha concluded  
his letter on the subject as follows : &quot;There  
is an excess of refinement in the idea of . dis­  
abling the people to continue in office men  
who had entitled themselves, in their opin­  
ion, to approbation and confidence ; the ad­  
vantages of which are at best speculative and  
  
qprvonalj- and are overbalanced bydieadvB  
  
tages far more certain and decisive.
