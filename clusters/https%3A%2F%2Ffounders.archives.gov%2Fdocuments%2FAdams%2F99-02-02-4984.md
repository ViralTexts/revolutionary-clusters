. In 1625 one Capt. Wollaston with about 30 Persons began a Plantation near Westons. They gave it the name of Mount Wollaston. It was known by that name some years after, but at length the name was lost in that of Braintree, of which Town it is a part. The particular Hill, which caused the name of Mount is in the farm of John Quincy Esq late one of the council for the Province. No mention is made of a Patent to Wollaston. One Morton of Furnivals Inn was of this Company. He was not left in command, but contrived to make himself chief, changed the name of Mount Wollaston to Merry mount, Sett all the Servants free, erected a May pole, and lived a Life of dissipation untill all the Stock intended for trade was consumed. He was charged with furnishing the Indians with Guns and Ammunition, and teaching them the use of them. At length he made himself so obnoxious to the Planters in all parts, that at their general desire the People of New Plimouth Seized him by an armed force and confined him untill they had an opportunity of Sending him to England.

rt 1. Chapter 10. Page 31.—I will begin with the Utmost Outmost Plantation in the Patent to the Southward, which is called Wichaguscussctt E.  an Indian name: this, as it is but a Small Village yet it is very pleasant and healthfull, very good ground, and is well–timbered, and hath good store of Hay ground: it hath a very Spacious Harbour for shipping before the Town; the Salt Water being navigable for boats and Pinnaces two Leagues. Here the inhabitants have good Store of Fish of all Sorts, and Swine, having Acorns and Clams at the time of year; here is also an Alewife River. Three miles to the North of this is Mount Wollaston, a very fertile Soil, and a place very convenient for farmers houses, there being great store of plain F  ground without Trees. Near this place is Massachusetts fields where the greatest Sagamore in the Country lived, before the Plague, who caused it to be cleared for himself. The greatest Inconvenience is, that there is not very many Springs, as in other places of the Country; yet water may be had for digging: a Second Inconvenience is, that Boats cannot come in at low Water, nor Ships ride near the Shore. Six miles further the north, lieth Dorchester, which is the greatest Town in New England (but I am informed that others equal it since I came away) well wooded and watered, very good Arable grounds and Hay grounds, fair Cornfields and pleasant Gardens, with Kitchen Gardens: in this plantation is a great many Cattle, as Kine, Goats &amp; Swine. This plantation hath a reasonable harbour for ships. Here is no Alewife River which is a great Inconvenience. The Inhabitants of this town were the first that Set upon the trade of fishing in the Bay, who received so much fruit of their Labour that they encouraged others to the same undertaking. A mile from this town lieth Roxbury, which is a fair and handsome Country Town, the Inhabitants of it being all very rich.

About this time there was a Town and Church planted at Mount Wollaston and named Braintree. It was occasioned by Some old Planters and certain Farmers belonging to the great Town of Boston; They had formerly one Mr Wheelwright to preach unto them (till this Government could no longer contain them) they many of them in the meantime belonging to the Church of Christ at Boston, but after his Departure they gathered into a Church themselves; having Some Enlargement of land, they began to be well peopled, calling to Office among them the Reverend and Godly Mr William Thom Tomson and Mr Henry Flint, the one to the office of a Pastor, the other of a Teacher; the People are purged by their Industry of the Sour leven of those Sinful Opinions that began to Spread, and if any remain among them it is very covert.

Book 2. Chap. 1. Page 59. In the month of June Anno Salutis 1622 it was my Chance to arrive in the parts of New England with 30 Servants and provision of all Sorts fit for a plantation: and while our houses were building, I did endeavour to take a Survey of the Country: The more I looked the more I liked it. And when I had Seriously considered of the beauty of the place, with all her fair Endowments I did not think that in all the known World it could be paralelled. For so many goodly groves of Trees, dainty fine round rising Hillucks H: delicate fair large plains, Sweet cristal fountains; and clear running Streams, that twine in fine meanders through the meads, making so sweet a murmuring Noise to hear, as would even lull the Senses with delight a Sleep, So pleasanly do they glide upon the pebble stones, jetting most jocundly where they do meet; and hand in hand run down to Neptunes Court, to pay the yearly Tribute, which they owe to him as Sovereign Lord of all the Springs. Contained within the Volume of the land, Fowles in abundance, Fish in multitude, and discovered beside millions of Turtle Doves on the green boughs, which Sat pecking of the full ripe pleasant grapes, that were Supported by the lusty trees whose fruitful load did cause the arms to bend, which here and there dispersed, you might see Lillies and of the Daphnean Tree, which made the land to me Seem Paradise, for in mine Eye twas Natures Masterpiece,: her chiefest Magazine of all, where lives her Store: if this land be not rich then is the whole World poor.  
Book 2. Chapt. 8. page 92. And for the Water, therein it excelleth Canaan by much; for the land is so apt for fountains, a Man cannot digg amiss. I. Besides there are Waters of most excellent Virtues worthy Admiration. At Ma–re Mount there was a Water (by me discovered) that is most excellent for the Cure of Melancholly probatum.  
Near Squantos Chapel (a place so by us called) is a Fountain that causeth a dead sleep for 48 Hours, to those that drink 24 ounces at a draught and so proportionably. The Savages that are Poroahs at Set times use it and reveal strange things to the Vulgar People by means of it.  
Book 3. chapt. 14. page 132. The Inhabitants of Pasonagessit, having translated the name of their habitation from that ancient Savage name to Ma-re Mount, and being resolved to have the new name confirmed for a Memorial to after Ages, did devise among  Mount Wollaston themselves to have it performed in a Solemn manner with Revells and merriment, after the old English Custom, prepared to sett up a Maypole, upon the festival day of Phillip and Jacob, and therefore brewed a Barrell of excellent beer, and provided a case of Bottles to be Spent, with other good cheer, for all comers of that day. And because they would have it in a compleat form, they had prepared a Song fitting to the time and present occasion. And upon May day they brought the Maypole to the place appointed, with Guns, Drums Pistolls and other fitting Instruments, for that purpose, and there erected it with the help of Savages, that came there of purpose to see the manner of our Revels. A goodly pine Tree of 80 feet long was reared up with a pair of Bucks horns nailed on, somewhat near unto the top of it; where it stood as a fair Sea mark for directions, how to find the Way to mine Host of Mare Mont.  
Page 134 The Setting up of this Maypole was a lamentable Spectacle to the precise Separatists that lived at New Plymouth. They termed it an Idol; yea they called it, the Calf of Horeb: and stood at defyance with the place naming it Mount Dagon; threatening to make it a woefull Mount and not a Merry Mount.

or at the Sight of both. The Beginning of Commerce in Brass Kettles for Beaver. Then Succeeds the Indian account of a plague among them in 1618, a little before the removal of that Church of Christ from Holland to Plymouth, in New England as the ancient Indians report, there befell a great mortality among them, the greatest that ever the memory of Father to Son among them took notice of, chiefly desolating those Places, where the English, afterward planted the Country of Pockaknoky, Agissawamg, it was almost wholly deserted, insomuch that the Neighbor Indians did abandon those places, for fear of death, fleeing more West and by South, observing the East and by northern parts were most Smitten with this contagion. The Abarginny Men consisting of Massachusetts, Wippanaps and Tarrantines were greatly weakened, and more especially the three Kingdoms or Sagamore Ships of the Massachusetts, who were before this mortality most populous, having under them Seven Dukedoms or petty Sagamores, and the Nianticks and Narrowganssitts, who before this came were but of little note, yet were they now not much encreased by such as fled thither for fear of death, the Pecods (who retained the name of a Warlike People, till afterwards conquered by the English) were also smitten at this time. Their disease being a Sore consumption, Sweeping away whole Families, but chiefly young Men and Children, the very Seeds of Increase, their Powwows, which are their Doctors, working partly by Charms, and partly by Medicine, were much amazed to See their Wigwams lie full of dead Corps, and that now neither Squantam nor Abbamocho could help, which are their good and bad God, and also their Powwows themselves were oft Smitten with deaths Stroke, howling and much lamentation was heard among the living, who being possessed with great fear, oftimes left their dead unburied, their manner being such, that they remove their habitations at death of any, this great mortality being an unwonted thing, fear them the more, because naturally the Country is very healthy. But by this means Christ (whose great and glorious Works the Earth throughout are altogether for the benefit of his Churches &amp; chosen) not only made room for his People to plant; but also tamed the hard and cruel hearts of those barbarous Indians, insomuch that half a handfull of his People landing not long after in Plymouth Plantation, found little Resistance, of whom the Author purposes not to Speak particularly, being prevented by the honoured Mr Winslow, who was an Eye Witness of the

1 The new Settlers were in perills also from their own Countrymen. Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Capt. Mason, two of the Council of Plymouth, who, with a view to the advancement of their Fortunes had expended large Sums to little purpose in attempts to Settle Colonies in New England beheld the Massachusetts with an envious eye. They intended for themselves all that part of the Colony which lies to the Eastward of Naumkeag. Gardiner and Moreton, to revenge the affronts they had received, joined with them, in a complaint against the C to the King in Council against the Colony. At this time they failed of success and an order was made in Council 19th January 1632 “declaring the fair appearances and grant hopes which there then were, that the Country would prove beneficial to the Kingdom as well as profitable to the particular Persons concerned, and that the adventurers might be assured that if things Should be carried on as was pretended, when the Patents were granted, and, according as by the patent was appointed, his Majesty would not only maintain the Liberties and Priviledges heretofore granted but supply any thing further which might tend to the good Government, prosperity and comfort of the People there.”  
Note. Morton wrote the following Letter to one Jeffries in New England. “My very good Gossip. If I should commend myself to you, you would reply with this Proverb propria laus Sordet in ore, but to leave impertinent Salutes and really proceed, you shall hereby understand, that although, when I was first Sent to New England to make complaint against Ananias and the Brethren, I effected the Business, but superficially (through the brevity of time) I have at this time taken deliberation and brought the matter to a better pass, and it is brought about that the King hath taken the matter into his own hands. The Massachusetts Patent by an order of council was brought in view, the Priviledges therein granted well Scanned, and at the council board in presence of Sir Richard Saltonstall and the rest it was declared, for manifold Abuses therein discovered, to be void. The King hath re-assumed the whole Business into his own hands, and given order for a general Governor for the whole territory to be sent over. The Commission is passed the privy Seal, I Saw it, and the same was sent to my Lord Keeper to have it pass the great Seal, and I now stay to return with the Governor, by whom all complainants shall have relief. So that now Jonas being set ashore, may safely cry repent ye, cruel schismatickss, repent, there are yet but forty days, If Jove vouchsafe to thunder, the Charter and the Kingdom of the seperatists will fall asunder. My Lord of Canterbury, with my Lord privy Seal having caused all Mr. Cradocks letters to be viewed, and his apology for the Brethren particularly heard, protested against him and Mr Humphries that they were a couple of imposturous Knaves, so that for all their great friends, they departed the Council Chamber in our view with a pair of cold Shoulders. I have staid long  yet have not lost my labour. The Brethren have found themselves frustrated and I shall See my desire upon mine Enemies. Of these things I thought good by so convenient a Messenger to give you notice lest you should think I died in obscurity, as the Brethren vainly intended I should. As for Ratcliffe he was comforted by their Lordships with the cropping of M. Withrops ears, which shews what opinion is held among them of King Winthrop, with all his inventions and his Amsterdam and fantastical ordinances, his Preachings marriages and other abusive Ceremonies, which exemplify his detestation of the Church of England and contempt of his Majestys Authority and wholesome Laws. I rest your loving Friend”  
Thomas MortonMay 1. 1634.  
Note this letter should have been placed by Mr Hutchinson in his History in or after the year 1634. After the Intrigues related in it were past.  
Hutchinsons Hist. page 32. Note Morton came to New England again in 1643 when this Letter, and a Book he had wrote full of invectives were produced against him. He was truly called the Accuser of the Brethren. The Court fined him an hundred Pounds. He was poor and unable to pay it. Nothing but his age saved him from the whipping Post. He went to  Acamonticus and there died a year or two after.

. In the year 1633 the People continued the Administration of Government in the same hands. Fresh supplies of Inhabitants had been brought from England from time to time in the course of the two former years, but there were many who were willing to See the success of the first Adventurers before they embarked themselves. The reports carried over were very encouraging so that this year there was a very great addition made; Ships arriving all Summer, in some months twelve or fourteen in a month; an exportation so great and of such Sort of Persons, that it produced the following order of the King in Council 21. February 1633.  
Whereas the Board is given to understand of the frequent transportation of great numbers of his Majestys Subjects out of this Kingdom to the plantation of New England among whom divers Persons known to be ill affected, discontented, not only with civil but ecclesiasticall Government here are observed to resort thither, whereby such confusion and distraction is already grown there, especially in point of Religion, as beside the ruin of the Said plantation cannot but highly tend to the Scandal both of Church and State here. And whereas it was informed in particular that there are at this present, divers Ships in the River of Thames, ready to set Sail thither freighted with Passengers and Provisions, it is thought fit and ordered that Stay should be forthwith made of the said ships until further order from this board. And the Several Masters and Freighters of the same should attend the board on Wednesday next in the afternoon with a List of the Passengers and Provisions in each ship. And that Mr. Cradock a Chief Adventurer in that Plantation now present before the board should be required to cause the Letters patent for the Said Plantation to be brought to this board.  
Hubbard  
Mr Hubbard says that this order was the effect of a new complaint prepared by Gardiner, Morton and others, of their hardships and Sufferings from the Severity of the Government, and that such of the Company as were in England, were called before the Committee of Council, and delivered an Answer in Writing, and that upon reading thereof it pleased God so to Work with the lords of the Council and afterwards with the Kings Majesty, that when the whole matter was reported to him by Sir Thomas Termayne, one of the Council who had been present at the three days of hearing and Spoke much in commendation of the Governor, both to the Lords and after to his Majesty, the King said he would have such Severely punished as shall abuse his Governor and the Plantation, and the Defendants were dismissed with a favourable order for their encouragement; being assured from Some of the Council that his Majesty did not intend to impose the Ceremonies of the Church of England upon them, for that it was considered it was for the sake of freedom from those Things that People went over thither.  
Hutch. 35. It is certain a Stop was not put to the Emigration. There came over amongst many others in the year 1633 Mr Haynes of the Civil order Mr Cotton, Mr Hooker and Mr Stone, three of the most famous Men of the religious order.

den, or with those who came over with the Patent, from London or the West of England. I can hardly believe that his being a Churchman or reading his Prayers from a Book of common Prayers could be any great offence. His Fun, his Songs and his Revells were provoking enough no doubt. But his Commerce with the Indians in Arms and ammunition, and his instructions to those Savages in the use of them, were Serious &amp; dangerous offences, which struck at the lives of the New Comers, and threatend the utter extirpation of all the Plantations.

He had not so high an opinion of a democratical Government as some other Gentlemen of equal Wisdom and Goodness. (Pray good Dr Belknap who were those other Gentlemen?) but plainly perceived a danger in “referring matters of Counsel and Judicature to the body of the People;” and when those who had removed to Connecticut were about forming their Government, he warned them of this danger in a friendly and faithfull Letter, wherein are these remarkable Words: “The best part of a Community is always the least, and of that best part the wiser are still less; wherefore the old Cannon was, chuse ye our Judges and thou shalt bring the matter before

Mr Knox called the in. of S—— by the same title; yet by no means reasons could he be drawn to yield to these Things, although they were allowed by diverse of the Ministers and the Chief of Plymouth.  
Page 54. Sept. 17. 1633. The Governor and Council met at Boston and called the Ministers and Elders of all the Churches to consider about Mr Cotton his sitting down. He was desired to diverse places, and those who came with him, desired he might sit down where they might keep store of Cattle; but it was agreed by full Consent, that the fittest place for him was Boston, and in that respect those of Boston might take farms in any part of the Bay, not belonging to other Towns, and that keeping a Lecturer he should have some maintenance out of the Treasury. But diverse of the Council upon Second thought, did after refuse this Contribution.  
Note.—Probably among the “divers places” was Mount Wollaston, for there the Salt Marshes and Plains and Hills cleared and cultivated by the Indians for the Seat of their great Sagamore Massachusetts, would enable them to keep store of Cattle.

orges. This was the beginning of the Colony of New Plymouth; and this Event happened Nov. 11. 1620 a few days after King James had signed the Patent for incorporating the Council. These Circumstances Served the interest of both, though then wholly unknown to each other. The Council being informed of the establishment of a Colony within their Limits, were fond of taking them into their protection, and the Colony were equally desirous of receiving that protection, as far as to obtain a grant of territory. An Agent being dispatched by the Colony to England, Sir F. Gorges interested himself in the affair, and a grant was accordingly made 1623 to John Pierce, in trust for the Colony. This was their first patent; they afterwards 1629 had another made to William Bradford and his associates.One End which the council had in view, was to prevent the access of unauthorized Adventurers to the coast of New England. The crews of their Ships, in their intercourse with the Natives being far from any established Government, were guilty of great licentiousness. Besides drunkenness and debauchery, some flagrant Enormities had been committed, which not only injured the reputation of Europeans, but encouraged the natives to Acts of Hostility. To remedy these evils, the Council thought proper to appoint an officer to exercise Government on the coast. The first person who was Sent in this character was Captn. Francis West; who finding the fishermen too licentious and robust to be controlled by him, soon gave up this ineffectual command. They next appointed Captn Robert Gorges, son of Sir Ferdinando. He was like his father, of an active and enterprizing Genius, and had newly returned from the Venetian War. He obtained of the Council a patent for a tract of land, on the northeastern side of Massachusetts Bay containing thirty miles in Length and ten in breadth, and by the influence of his father, and of his kinsman Lord Edward Gorges, he was dispatched with a commission to be Lieutenant General and Governor of New England. They appointed for his council the aforesaid West, with Christopher Levet, and the Governor of New Plymouth for the time being. Gorges came to Plymouth in 1623, published his Commission, and made some efforts to execute it. He brought over with him, as a Chaplain, William Merrill, and Episcopal Clergyman. This was the first essay for the establishment of a general Government in New England, and Merrill was to have a Superintendence in ecclesiastical, as Gorges had in civil affairs; but he made no use of his commission at Plymouth; and only mentioned it in his conversation about the time of his departure. This general Government was a darling object with the Council of Plymouth, but was much dreaded by the planters of New England, however, all the attempts which were made, to carry it into execution, failed of Success. Gorges, after about a years residence in the Country and holding one Court at Plymouth, upon a Mr Weston, who had begun a plantation at Wessagussett, Weymouth, where Gorges himself intended a Settlement, was recalled to England, the Supplies which he expected to have received having failed

In Winslows Journal Mr Hamden is said to be “a Gentleman of London, who then wintered with us, and desired much to see the Country.” I suppose this to be the same Person who distinguished himself by his opposition to the illegal and arbitrary demands of King Charles I. He had previously (1637) embarked for New England with Oliver Cromwell, Sir Arthur Hasling and others; but they were prevented from coming by the Kings proclamation against disorderly transporting his Majestys subjects to the plantations in America. Hamden was born in 1594  and was 29 years old at the time of his being at Plymouth in 1623. See Neal’s History of NE. V. 1 151. Hazards State Papers Vol. 1. 421. Northoucks Biographical Dictionary.

It has been before observed, that Gorges had Sent over Richard Vines with some others, on a discovery, to prepare a Way for a Colony. The place which Vines pitched upon, was at the mouth of the River Saco. Some years after, another Settlement was made on the river of Agamenticus, by Francis Norton, whom Gorges sent over with a number of other People, having procured for them at patent of 12,000 acres on the East Side of the river, and 12,000 more on the West side; his Son Ferdinando Gorges being named as one of the Grantees; this was the beginning of the Town of York. Norton was a Lieutenant Colonel, and had raised himself to that rank, from a common Soldier by his own merit. In this company were several Artificers, who were Supplied with Cattle and other Necessaries for the Business of getting Lumber.

council, was brought in ‘view, the privileges therein granted well fcanned, and at

“‘In the month of June, 1622, it was my chance to arrive in the part  
of New England, with thirty servants, and provisions of all sorts, fit for  
a plantation. And whiles our houses were building, t did endeavour to  
take a survey of the country : The more I looked, the more 1 liked.  
And when I had more seriously considered of the beauty of the place,  
with all its fair endowments, I did not think in all the known world it  
could be paralel’d. For so many goodiy grouves of trees, dainty fine  
round rising hillucks ; delicate fair large plains, sweete chrystal, and  
cleare running streams, that twine in fine meanders through the meads,  
making so sweet a murmuring noise to hear, as would even lull the sen-  
ces with delight asleep, so pleasantly doe they glide upon the pebble  
stones, jetting most jocundly where they do meete, and hand in hand  
runne downe to Neptune’s court, to pay the yearly tribute, which they  
owe to him, as soveraigne Lord of all the springs. Contained within  
the volume of the land, fowles in abundance, fish in multitude, millions  
of turtle doves on the green boughes, which sat pecking of the full ripe  
pleasant grapes, that were supported by the lusty trees, whose fruitful  
loade did cause the arms to bend, which here and there dispersed, (you  
might see) lillies, and of the Daphnean tree, which makes the land to  
mee seeme Paradise, for in mine eie *twas nature’s master piece, her  
cheerful magazine of all, where lives her store ; if this land be not rich,  
then is the whole world poore. What | had resolved on, IL really per-  
formed, and have endeavoured to use this abstract, as an instrument to be  
the means tocommunicate the knowledge I have obtained, by my many  
years residence in those parts, unto my countrymen, to the end that they  
may better perceive their errour, who cannot imagine that in the univer-

neighbor Indians did abandon those places for fear of death, fleeing more  
west and by south, observing that the east and by northern parts were  
most smit with the contagion. The Aborginny men, consisting of Mat-  
tachusetts, Whippanaps, and Tarratines, were greatly weakened, and  
more especially the three Kingdoms or Saggamore ships of the Matta-  
chusetts, who were before this mortality most populous, having under  
them seven Dukedoms, or petty Saggamores. The Nianticks and Nar-  
ragansetts, who before this time were but of little note, yet were they  
now much increased by such as fled thither for fear of death. The  
Pecods (who retained the name of a warlike people, till afterwards  
conquered by the English) were also smitten at this time. Their dis-  
ease being a sore consumption, sweeping away whole families, chiefly  
young men and children, the very seeds of increase. Their powwowes,  
which are their doctors, working partly by charm, partly by medicine,  
were much amazed to see their wigwams (houses) lie full of dead  
corpses, and now that neither Squantam nor Abomocho could help,  
which are their good and bad God. By this means, Christ not only  
made room for his people to plant, but also tamed the cruel hearts of  
these barbarous Indians, insomuch that half an handful of his people,  
landing not long after in Plymouth plantation, found little resistance.”

much disorder in that Plantacion upon the partes of America, called New

For prevencion whereof and for the orderly settling of Governmt accord-

Comittee of this Board to take examinacions of the matters informed,  
which Comittee having called divers of the principal Adventure’s in  
that Plantacion, and heard those that complained against them, most of the

dispatch of men, victualls and marchandizes for that place, All which  
would be at a stand, if the Adventurers should have discouragment, or

himself by his opposition to the illegal and arbitrary demands of King  
Charles I. He had previously (1637) embarked for New England  
with Oliver Cromwell, Sir Arthur Haslerig and others ; but they were

prison about a year, in expectation of further evidence out of England [sic /],  
he was again called before the court, and after some debate what to do with  
him, he was fined £100 and set at liberty. He was a charge to the country,

upon him, being old and crazy, but thought better to fine him and give  
him his liberty, as if it had been to procure his fine, but indeed to leave

discussion and curiosity. Who was this  
Master John Hamden? Was it the great  
John Hampden? The issue was first  
raised by Dr. Belknap, in 1798, almost  
two centuries after Winslow wrote. Re-  
ferring to the passage, in his article on  
Bradford, in his American Biography (Vol.  
II., p. 229), he said: “I suppose this to  
be the same person who distinguished  
himself by his opposition to the illegal and  
  
I,  
  
arbitrary demand of King Charles I. He  
had previously (1637) embarked for New  
England with Oliver Cromwell, Sir Arthur  
Haslerig, and others ; but they were pre-  
vented from coming by the King’s procla-  
mation against disorderly transporting his  
Majesty’s subjects to the plantations in  
America. Hamden was born in 1594, and  
was 29 years old at the time of his being  
in Plymouth, in 1623. See Neal’s Hist.  
N.E., Vol. I. 151 ; Hazard’s State Papers,

Subsequent to the Reformation, the first great missionary enterprise of Prot-  
estantism was the establishing of Christian colonies in New England. Next to  
securing a home for the full exercise of civil and religious freedom was the  
desire to extend the Redeemer’s kingdom. It was recognized in the royal  
charter of the Plymouth colonists, and laws were early enacted for the preach-  
ing of the gospel among the Indians around them. “Oh, that you had con-  
verted some before you had killed any!” wrote John Robinson from Leyden.  
In 1620, two years before the institution of the Propaganda at Rome, the  
Pilgrims began the work of foreign missions on the then heathen shores of  
New England. The charter of the Massachusetts Colony, established ten years  
later, declares that “ to win and incite the natives of the country to the knowl-  
edge and obedience of the only true God and Saviour of mankind and the  
Christian faith . . . is the principal end of the plantation.” The seal of the

the rechristening of the settle-

the festival day of Philip and  
Jacob they set up their pole ; they

thing was to be permitted, there  
was no saying where it might stop.  
A sympathiser with those men of

The religious test for freemanship was not the first de-  
fense against “the world” which these shrewd Puritan  
leaders erected. The full and absolute control which the  
charter granted them over their territory they considered  
gave them the right to exclude all whom they thought un-  
desirable settlers. “If we here be a corporation, established  
by free consent, if the place of our co-habitation be our own,  
then no man hath right to come in to us without our con-  
sent.” This theory speedily found expression in law. At  
the second court of assistants held at Charlestown, Sept. 7,  
1630, it was ordered that no person should plant in any place  
within the limits of the colony without leave from the Gov-  
ernor and the majority of the assistants.’
