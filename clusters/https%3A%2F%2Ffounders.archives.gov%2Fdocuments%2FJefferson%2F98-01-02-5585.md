The Envoys declined both propositions; and than, at their instance, the following article was introduced into the Convention—“Article 2d The Ministers Plenipotentiary of the two parties not being able to agree at present respecting the treaty of Alliance of the 6th of February 1778, the treaty of Amity and Commerce of the same date, and the Convention of the 14th of November 1788, nor upon the indemnities mutually due or claimed; the parties will negotiate further on these Subjects at a convenient time, and until they may have agreed upon these points the said treaties and Convention shall have no operation, and the relations of the two Countries shall be regulated as follows.”The French government ratified the Convention with Said article. The Senate of the United States, voluntarily and unconditionally, Struck out said article. The First Consul ratified the Convention as amended, by adding thereto the following Condition, “Provided, that by this retrenchment the two States renounce the respective pretensions which are the object of the Said article.” And President Jefferson ratified the Convention finally, in the following words, viz“Which ratifications were duly exchanged at Paris on the 21st day of July 1801, and having been sSo exchanged at Paris were again Submitted to the Senate of the United States, who, in the 19th day of December 1801, resolved, that they considered the said Convention as fully ratified, and returned the same to the President for the usual promulgation.”The ratification of the Convention in its original form, by France, was a full recognition of the existence of the claims, and a direct obligation on France to negotiate and pay them. The claiming Merchants were entitled to th
