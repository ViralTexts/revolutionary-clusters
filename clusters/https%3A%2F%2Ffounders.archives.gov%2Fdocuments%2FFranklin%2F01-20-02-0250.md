ation. By omitting it so long, you are wanting to the World, and to your own Honour.  
I thank you for the Remarks of your learned Friend at Carlisle. I had when a Youth, read and smiled at Pliny’s Account of a Practice among the Seamen of his Time, to still the Waves in a Storm by pouring Oil into the Sea: which he mentions, as well as the Use of Oil by the Divers. But the stilling a Tempest by throwing Vinegar into the Air had escaped me. I think with your Friend, that it has been of late too much the Mode to slight the Learning of the Ancients. The Learned too, are apt to slight too much the Knowledge of the Vulgar. The cooling by Evaporation was long an Instance of the latter. This Art of smoothing the Waves with Oil, is an Instance of both.  
Perhaps you may not dislike to have an Account of all I have heard, and learnt and done in this Way. Take it, if you please, as follows.  
In 1757 being at Sea in a Fleet of 96 Sail bound against Louisbourg, I observed the Wakes of two of the Ships to be remarkably smooth, while all the others were ruffled by the Wind, which blew fresh. Being puzzled with this differing Appearance I at last pointed it out to our Captain, and asked him the meaning of it? “The Cooks, says he, have I suppose, been just emptying their greasy Water thro’ the Scuppers, which has greased the Sides of those Ships a little;” and this Answer he gave me with an Air of some little Contempt, as to a Person ignorant of what every Body else knew. In my own Mind I at first slighted his Solution, tho’ I was not able to think of another. But recollecting what I had formerly read in Pliny, I resolved to make some Experiment of the Effect of Oil on Water when I should have Opportunity.  
Afterwards being again at Sea in 1762, I first observed the wonderful Quietness of Oil on agitated Water in the swinging Glass Lamp I made to hang up in the Cabin, as described in my printed Papers, page 438 of the fourth Edition. This I was continually looking at and considering, as an Appearance to me inexplicable. An old Sea Captain, then a Passenger with me, thought little of it, supposing it an Effect of the same kind with that of Oil put on Water to smooth it, which he said was a Practice of the Bermudians when they would strike Fish which they could not see if the surface of the Water was ruffled by the Wind. This Practice I had never before heard of, and was obliged to him for the Information, though I thought him mistaken as to the sameness of the Experiment, the Operations being different; as well as the Effects. In one Case, the Water is smooth till the Oil is put on, and then becomes agitated. In the other it is agitated before the Oil is applied, and then becomes smooth. The same Gentleman told me he had heard it was a Practice with the Fishermen of Lisbon when about to return into the River, (if they saw before them too great a Surff upon the Bar, which they apprehended might fill their Boats in passing) to empty a Bottle or two of oil into the Sea, which would suppress the Breakers and allow them to pass safely: a Confirmation of this I have not since had an Opportunity of obtaining. But discoursing of it with another Person, who had often been in the Mediterranean, I was informed that the Divers there, who when under Water in their Business, need Light, which the curling of the Surface interrupts, by the Refractions of so many little Waves, they let a small Quantity of Oil now and then out of their Mouths, which rising to the Surface smooths it, and permits the Light to come down to them. All these Informations I at times revolved in my Mind, and wondered to find no mention of them in our Books of Experimental Philosophy.  
At length being at Clapham, where there is, on the Common, a large Pond, which I observed to be one Day very rough with the Wind, I fetched out a Cruet of Oil, and dropt a little of it on the Water. I saw it spread itself with surprising Swiftness upon the Surface, but the Effect of smoothing the Waves was not produced; for I had applied it first on the Leeward Side of the Pond where the Waves were largest, and the Wind drove my Oil back upon the Shore. I then went to the Windward Side, where they began to form; and there the Oil tho’ not more than a Tea Spoonful produced an instant Calm, over a Space several yards square, which spread amazingly, and extended itself gradually till it reached the Lee Side, making all that Quarter of the Pond, perhaps half an Acre, as smooth as a Looking Glass.  
After this, I contrived to take with me, whenever I went into the Country, a little Oil in the upper hollow joint of my bamboo Cane, with which I might repeat the Experiment as Opportunity should offer; and I found it constantly to succeed.  
In these Experiments, one Circumstance struck me with particular Surprize. This was the sudden, wide and forcible Spreading of a Drop of Oil on the Face of the Water, which I do not know that any body has hitherto considered. If a Drop of Oil is put on a polished Marble Table, or on a Looking Glass that lies horizontally; the Drop remains in its Place, spreading very little. But when put on Water it spreads instantly many feet round, becoming so thin as to produce the prismatic Colours, for a considerable Space, and beyond them so much thinner as to be invisible except in its Effect of smoothing the Waves at a much greater Distance. It seems as if a mutual Repulsion between its Particles took Place as soon as it touched the Water, and a Repulsion so strong as to act on other Bodies swimming on the Surface, as Straws, Leaves, Chips, &amp;c. forcing them to recede every way from the Drop, as from a Center, leaving a large clear Space. The Quantity of this Force, and the Distance to which it will operate, I have not yet ascertained, but I think it a curious Enquiry, and I wish to understand whence it arises.  
In our Journey to the North when we had the Pleasure of seeing you at Ormathwaite, we visited Mr. Smeaton near Leeds. Being about to shew him the smoothing

f the Film.  
Our Friend Sir J. Pringle being soon after in Scotland, learnt there that those employed in the Herring Fishery, could at a Distance see where the Shoals of Herrings were, by the smoothness of the Water over them, which might be occasioned possibly, he thought, by some Oiliness proceeding from their Bodies.  
A Gentleman from Rhode-island told me, it had been remarked that the Harbour of Newport was ever smooth while any Whaling Vessels were in it; which probably arose from hence, that the Blubber which they sometimes bring loose in the Hold, or the Leakage of their Barrels, might afford some Oil to mix with that Water which from time to time they pump out to keep the Vessel free, and that same Oil might spread over the surface of the Water in the Harbour, and prevent the forming of any Waves.  
This Prevention I would thus endeavour to explain.  
There seems to be no natural Repulsion between Water and Air, such as to keep them from coming into Contact with each other. Hence we find a Quantity of Air in Water, and if we extract it by means of the Air-pump; the same Water again exposed to the Air, will soon imbibe an equal Quantity.  
Therefore Air in Motion, which is Wind, in passing over the smooth Surface of Water, may rub, as it were, upon that Surface, and raise it into Wrinkles, which if the Wind continues are the elements of future Waves.  
The smallest Wave once raised does not immediately subside and leave the neighbouring Water quiet; but in subsiding raises nearly as much of the Water next to it, the Friction of its Parts making little Difference. Thus a Stone dropt in a Pool raises first a single Wave round itself, and leaves it by sinking to the Bottom; but that first Wave subsiding raises a second, the second a third, and so on in Circles to a great Extent.  
A small Power continually operating will produce a great Action. A Finger applied to a weighty suspended Bell, can at first move it but little; if repeatedly applied, tho’ with no greater Strength, the Motion increases till the Bell swings to its utmost Height and with a Force that cannot be resisted by the whole Strength of the Arm and Body. Thus the small first-raised Waves, being continually acted upon by the Wind are, (tho’ the Wind does not increase in Strength) continually increased in Magnitude, rising higher and extending their Bases, so as to include a vast Mass of Water in each Wave, which in its Motion acts with great Violence.  
But if there be a mutual Repulsion between the Particles of Oil, and no Attraction between Oil and Water, Oil dropt on Water will not be held together by Adhesion to the Spot whereon it falls, it will not be imbibed by the Water, it will be at Liberty to expand itself, and it will spread on a Surface that besides being smooth to the most perfect degree of Polish, prevents, perhaps by repelling the Oil, all immediate Contact, keeping it at a minute Distance from itself; and the Expansion will continue, till the mutual Repulsion between the Particles of the Oil, is weakened and reduced to nothing by their Distance.  
Now I imagine that the Wind blowing over Water thus covered with a Film of Oil, cannot easily catch upon it so as to raise the first Wrinkles, but slides over it, and leaves it smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the Oil, indeed, which being between it and the water serves it to slide with, and prevents Friction as Oil does between those Parts of a Machine that would otherwise rub hard together. Hence the Oil dropt on the Windward Side of a Pond proceeds gradually to Leeward, as may be seen by the smoothness it carries with it, quite to the opposite Side. For the Wind being thus prevented from raising the first Wrinkles that I call the Elements of Waves, cannot produce Waves, which are to be made by continually acting upon and enlarging those Elements, and thus the whole Pond is calmed.  
Totally therefore we might supress the Waves in any required Place, if we could come at the Windward Place where they take their Rise. This in the Ocean can seldom if ever be done. But perhaps something may be done on particular Occasions, to moderate the Violence of the Waves, when we are in the midst of them, and prevent their Breaking where that would be inconvenient.  
For when the Wind blows fresh, there are continually rising on the Back of every great Wave, a number of small ones, which roughen its Surface, and give the Wind Hold, as it were, to push it with greater Force. This Hold is diminished by preventing the Generation of those small ones. And possibly too, when a Wave’s Surface is oiled, the Wind in passing over it, may rather in some degree press it down, and contribute to prevent its rising again, instead of promoting it.  
This as a mere Conjecture would have little weight, if the apparent Effects of pouring Oil into the Midst of Waves, were not considerable, and as yet not otherwise accounted for.  
When the Wind blows so fresh, as that the Waves are not sufficiently quick in obeying its Impulse, their Tops being thinner and lighter are pushed forward, broken and turned over in a white Foam. Common Waves lift a Vessel without entring it, but these when large sometimes break above and pour over it, doing great Damage.  
That this Effect might in any degree be prevented, or the height and violence of Waves in the Sea moderated, we had no certain Account, Pliny’s Authority for the Practice of Seamen in his time being slighted. But discoursing lately on this Subject with his Excellency Count Bentinck of Holland, his Son the Honble. Capt. Bentinck, and the learned Professor Allemand, (to all whom I showed the Experiment of smoothing in a Windy Day the large Piece of Water at the Head of the Green Park) a Letter was mentioned which had been received by the Count from Batavia, relating to the saving of a Dutch Ship in a Storm, by pouring Oil into the Sea. I much desired to see that Letter, and a Copy of it was promised me, which I afterwards received.

 Shore, which rendered it impracticable. My Idea was, that possibly by sailing to and fro at some Distance from such Lee Shore, continually pouring Oil into the Sea, the Waves might be so much depressed and lessened before they reached the Shore, as to abate the Height and Violence of the Surff and permit a Landing, which in such

ind the Point, (a Place more sheltered from the Sea) who came round and placed themselves opposite to the Longboat, where they might observe the Surff, and note if any Change occurred in it upon using the Oil: Another Party in the Barge plied to Windward of the Longboat, as far from her as she was from the Shore, making Trips of about half a Mile each, pouring Oil continually out of a large Stone Bottle, thro’ a Hole in the Cork somewhat bigger than a Goose Quill. The Experiment had not in the main Point the Success we wished; for no material Difference was observed in the Height or Force of the Surff upon the Shore: But those who were in the Longboat could observe a Tract of smoothed Water the whole Length of the Distance in which the Barge poured the Oil, and gradually spreading in Breadth towards the Longboat; I call it smoothed, not that it was laid level, but because tho’ the Swell continued, its Surface was not roughened by the Wrinkles or smaller Waves before-mentioned, and none, or very few Whitecaps (or Waves whose Tops turn over in Foam) appeared in that whole Space, tho’ to windward and leeward of it there were plenty; and a Wherry that came round the Point under Sail in her way to Portsmouth, seemed to turn into that Tract of choice, and to use it from End to End as a Piece of Turnpike Road.  
  
It may be of Use to relate the Circumstances even of an Experiment that does not succeed, since they may give Hints of Amendment in future Trials: It is therefore I have been thus particular. I shall only add what I apprehend may have been the Reason of our Disappointment.  
I conceive that the Operation of Oil on Water, is first to prevent the rai

two of the Ihips to be remarkably fmooth,  
while all the others were rutiled by the  
wind, which blew frefli. Being puzzled  
with the different appearance, I at laft  
pviinted it out to our captain, and aiked  
him the meaning of it; “ The cooks,  
fays he, have, I fuppofe, been juft empty¬  
ing their greafy water through the feup-  
pers, which has greafed the lides of thofe  
(hips a little;” and this anfwer he gave  
me with an air of Ibme little contempt,  
as to a perfon ignorant of what every bo¬  
dy clfe knew. In my own mind 1 at firft  
flighted his folution, though 1 was not  
‘able to think of another: But recollec-  
I ting what I had formerly read in Pliny,  
1 rcfolved to ifiake fomc experiment of  
the effedf of oil on water, when I (hould  
have an opportunity.  
  
“ Afterwards being again at fea in  
1761, 1 firft obferved the wonderful  
quictnefs of oil on agitated water, in the  
fwinging glafs lamp 1 made to hang up  
in the cabin, as defcribtd in my printed  
papers, p. 458. of the fourth edition.  
This 1 was continually looking at and  
confidering, as an appearance to me inex¬  
plicable. An old fea captain, then a paf-  
  
fenger with me, thought little of It, fup-  
pnfing it an ctfcdl of the fame kitid with  
that of oil put on water to Iniooth it;  
Which iie faid a prai^fice of the Ber¬  
mudians when they would ftrike fillip  
wdiich they c&#x27;t&#x27;uld not fee, if ihe furfac^  
of ihe water was n-flled by the wind.  
This praiftioe I had never before heard  
of, &lt;anct WA^ obliged to him for the infor*  
mation ; though I thouglit liim miftakeit  
as to the famenefs of the experiment,! hp  
onerations being different, as well as thp  
ertcifts. In one cafe, the water is fmooth  
till the oil is put on, and tiicn becomei  
agitated. In the other it i ♦ agitated be¬  
fore the oil is applied, and then bccomei  
fmooth.—The fame gentleman told’me^  
he had heard it was a pradicc with the  
filhermen of Lifb &gt;fi when about to returri  
into the river, (if they faw before theiri  
too great a furf upon the bar, which they  
apprehended might fill their boats in paf-  
fing) to empty a bottle or two of oil in¬  
to the fea, wliich would fupprefs the  
breakers, and&#x27;allow them to paf&gt; fafely t  
A confirmation of this I have not lincP  
had an opportunity of obtaining. But  
difcourfing r&gt;f it with another perfon&#x27;,  
who had often been in the Mediterrane¬  
an, I was infe^med that the divers there&#x27;,  
who, when under water in their bufinefs^  
need light, which the curling of the fur-  
face interrupts by the refradions* of (b  
mriuy little waves, let a ftnall quantity of  
oil now and then out of their moiiihsi  
which fifing to the furface fmootlis it,  
and permits the light to come down tcl  
them. All thefe informations F at timed  
revolved in my mind, and wondered tfi  
find no mention of them in our books of  
experimental philofophy. &#x27;  
  
At length being at Clapham, whert  
there is&#x27;, on the Common, a large poAd^  
which I obferved to be one day very  
rough with the wind, I fetched out.a  
criiet of oil, and dropl a little of it on the  
water. I faw it fpread itfclf with furprif-  
inu fwiftiiefs upon the fui face| but the  
effed of fmoothing the waves was ndt  
produced; fori had applied nt firft&#x27;on  
the leeward fide of the pond, where the  
Waves w&#x27;cre largeft, and the wind drove  
my oil back upon the Ibore. I then went  
to the windward fide, where they began  
to form&#x27;; and thetc the oil, th ugh not

fome little contempt, as to a perfor ig-  
norant of what every body elfe knew.  
In my own mind [ at firtt flighted his fo-

had formerly read in Pliny, 1 refolved

edition. This I was continually look-  
ing at and confidering as an appearance  
to me inexplicable. An old fea cap-  
tain, then a paflenger with me, thought  
little of it, fuppofing it an effedt of the  
fame kind with that of oil put on water  
to fmooth it, which he faid was a prac-  
tice of the Bermudians when they would  
ftrike fith, which they conid not fee, if  
the furface of the water was ruffled by

for the information ; though I thought

rent, as well as she effeéts. In one  
cafe, the water is fmooth till the oil is  
put on, and then becomes agitated; in  
the other it !s agitated before the oi} is  
applied, and then becomes fmooth.—  
The fame gentleman told me, he had  
heard it was a praétice with the fither-  
men of Lifbon, when abont to return  
into the river, (if they faw before them  
too great a fu:f upon the bar, which  
they apprehended might fill their boats  
in pafling) to empty a bottle or two of  
oil into the fea, which would fupprefs  
the breakers, and allow them to pafs  
fafely : a confirmation of this I have  
not fince had an opportunity of obtain-  
ing. But dilcourting of it with ano-  
ther perfon, who had often been in the  
Mediterranean, I was informed that the  
divers there, who, when under water  
in their bufinefs, need hight, which the  
curling of the turface inter:upts by the  
refraétions of fo many little waves, let  
a fmal] quantity of oil now and then  
out of thir mouths, which rifing to the  
furface finooths it, and permits tne light  
to come down to them.—All thefe in-  
formations I at times revolved in my  
mind, and wondered to find no men-  
tion of them in our books of experi-  
mental philofophy.  
  
* At length, being at Claphe.n,  
where there 1s, on the common, a Jarge  
pond, which I obferved to be one day  
very rough with the wind, I fetched  
out a cruct of oiJ, and diopt a little of  
it on the water. I faw it tpread itfelf  
with furprifing fwiftnefs upon the (ur-  
face; but the effe&amp;t of {moothing the  
waves was not produced ; for I had ap-  
plied it firft on the teeward fide of the  
pond, where the waves were largetl, and  
the wind drove my oil back upon the  
fhore. I then went to the windward  
fide, where they began to form; and  
there the oil, thongh not more than a  
tea-{poonful, produced an inflant calm  
over a fpace feveral yards fquaie,  
wiich fpread amazingly, and extended  
itfelf gradually till it reached the lee-  
fide, making al! that quarter of the  
pond, perhaps half an acre, as fmooth  
as a looking-glafs.  
  
«© After this, I contrived to take  
with me, whenever I went into the  
country, 2 little oil in the upper hol-

* In thele experiments, one circum-  
ftance firuck me with particular fur-  
prize. This was the fudden, wide,  
and forcible fpreading of a diop of oil,  
on the face of the water, which I do  
not know that any body has hitherto  
confidered. If adrop of @il is put on  
a polifhed marble table, or on a look-  
ing glafs that lies horizontally, the  
drop remains in its place, {preading  
very little; but, when put on water,  
it. fpreads inftantly many feet round,  
becoming (0 thin as to produce the prif-  
matic colours, for a confiderable fpace,  
and beyond them fo much thinner as  
to be invilible, except in its effect of  
fmoothing the waves at a avach greater  
diftance. It feems as if a mutual re-  
pulfion between its particles took place  
as foon as it touched the water, and a  
vepulfion fo flrong as to a&amp; on other bo-  
dies (wimming on the surface, as Rraws,  
leaves, chips, &amp;c. forcing them to re-  
. cede every way from the drop, as from  
a center, leaving a large clear fpace.  
The quantity of this force, and the dif-  
tance to which it will operate, I have  
not yet afcertained; but I think it a

ters, however, the fact is placed beyond  
difpute, as will appear from the following  
extract;  
  
“ In 1757, fays Dr. Franklin, being at  
fea in a fleet of ninety-fix fail bound a-  
gainft Louifbourg, I obferved the wakes  
of two of the fhips to be remarkably  
{mooth, while all the others were ruffled  
by the wind, which blew frefh. Being  
puzzled with the differing appearance, I  
at laft pointed it out to our Captain, and  
afked him the meaning of it?‘* The Cooks,  
fays he, have, I fuppofe, been juit emp-  
tying their greafy water through the fcup-  
pers, which has greafed the fides of thofe  
fhips a little;*’ and this anfwer he gave  
me with an air of fome little contempt, as  
to a perfon ignorant of what every body  
elie knew. In my own mind [ at firtt  
flighted his folution, though I was not  
able to think of another. But recollect-  
ing what [had formerly read in Pliny, I  
refolved to make fome experiment of the  
effe&amp; of oil on water, when I fhould have  
opportunity.  
  
‘* Afterwards being again at fea in  
1762, I firft obferved the wonderful quiet-  
nets of oil on agitated water, in a {winging  
glafs lamp I had made to hang up in the  
cabin. ‘This I was continually looking  
at and confidering, as an appearance in-  
explicable. An old fea captain, then a  
pailenger with me, thought little of it,  
fuppofing it an effeét of the fame kind  
with that of oil put on water to fmooth  
it, which he faid was a practice of the Ber-  
mud ans to ftrike fith, which they could  
not fee, if the furface of the water was  
ruffled by the wind. This practice [had  
never before heard of, and was obliged to  
  
the Rev. Mr. FarisuH.  
  
  
  
  
  
him for the information ; tho’ I thought  
him miftaken as to the famenefs of the  
experiment, the operations being differ-  
ent, as well as the effects. In one cafe,  
the water is fmooth till the oil is put on,  
and then becomes agitated. In the other,  
it is agitated before the oil is applied,  
and then becomes fmooth. The fame  
gentleman told me, he heard it was a prac-  
tice with the fifhermen of Lifbon, when  
about to return into the river, (if they  
faw before them too great a furf upon the  
  
bar, which they apprehended might fill  
  
their boats in paffing) to empty a bottle  
  
or two of oil into the fea, which would  
  
fupprefs the breakers, and allow them to  
palsiafely ; a confirmation of this I have  
not fince had an opportunity of obtain-  
ing. But difcourling of it with another  
perfon who had often been in in the Me-  
diterranean, I was informed that the  
divers there, who, when under water in  
their bufinefs, need light, which the curl-  
ing of the furface interrupts, by the re-  
fiactions of fo many little waves, let a  
fmail quantity of oil now and then out of  
their mouths, which rifing to the furface,  
{mooths it, and permits the light to come  
down tothem. All thefe informations  
I at times revolved in my mind, and won-  
dered to find no mention of them in our  
books of experimental philofophy.  
  
«* At length being at Clapham, where  
there is, on the Common, a large pond,  
which I obferved to be one day very  
rough with the wind, I fetched ovt a  
cruet of oil, and dropt a little of it on the  
water. I faw it fpread itfelf with furpri-  
fing {wiftnefs upon the furface; but the  
eifect of fmoothing the waves was not  
produced ; for I had applied it at firft on  
the leeward fide of the pond, where the  
waves were largeft, and the wind drove  
my oil back upon the fhore. I then went  
to

form; and there the oil, though not  
more than a tea fpoonful, produced a  
inftant calm over a fpace feveral yards  
fquare, which f{pread amazingly, and ex-  
tended itfelf gradually till it reached the  
Jee fide, making all that quarier of the  
pond, perhaps half an acre, as finooth as  
a looking-glafs.  
  
“¢ After this I contrived to take with  
me, whencver I went into the country, a

firft to attend particularly to it; and the various informations  
which he afterwards received relating to it, induced him to tr  
fome experiments on the fubject. Standing on the windward

dered very rough with the wind, be poured a tea-/poonful of oil  
on the water, He had the pleafure to fee this {mall quantity

but on water it inftantly expands into a circle extending feveral  
feet in diameter ; * becoming fo thin as to produce the prifma-  
tic colours, for a confiderable {pace, and beyond them fo much  
thinner as to be invifible, except in its effe&amp;t of fmoothing the

ute, as will appear from the fol-  
owing extract :

an efeét of the fame kind, with that

never before heard of, and was  
obliged to him for the information;  
though I thought him mittaken as

the operations being different, as

informations which he afterwards  
received rela-ting to it induced him to  
try some experiments on the subject.  
Standing on the windward side of a large  
pond, the surface of which was rendered  
very rough with the wind, he poured a  
tea-spoonful of oil on the water. This  
small quantity produced an instant calm  
over a space of se\eral yards square,  
which spread amazingly and extended  
itself gradually, till it reached the  
lee side, making all that quarter of the  
pond, per-haps half an acre, as smooth  
as a looking-glass. &#x27; On repeating this  
experiment, which constantly suc-ceeded,  
one circumstance struck him with  
particular surprise ; this was the  
sudden, wide, and forcible, spreading of  
a drop of oil on the face of the water,  
which, he adds,&quot; I do not know that any  
body has considered.&quot; When a drop of oil  
is put on aloo! ing-glass, or polished  
marble, it spreads very little; but on  
water it instantly expands into a circle  
extending several feet in diameter,  
becoming so thin as to produce the pris-  
matic colours, for a considerable space,  
&amp; beyond them so much thinner as to be  
invisible, except in its effects of  
smoothing the waves at a much greater  
distance. It seems, says Dr. Franklin,  
as if a mutual repulsion be. tween its  
particles took place as soon as it  
touched the water, and a repulsion so  
strong as to act on other bo-dies  
swimming on the surface, as straws,  
leaves, &amp;c. forcing them to recede every

that there seems to be no natural  
repulsion between water and air, such as  
to keep them from coming into contact  
with each other.-There-fore air, in  
motion, which is wind, in passing over  
the smooth surface of water, may rub, as  
it were, on that surface, and rise it  
into wriukles, which, if the wind  
continues, are the elements of future  
waves. The smallest does not immediately  
subside, but in subsi-ding raises nearly  
as much of the water next, to it. A  
small power, continually operating, will  
produce a great action : so that the  
first-raised waves being con-tinually  
acted upon by the wind, are, though the  
wind does not increase in strength,  
continually increased in magnitude,  
rising higher and extending their basis,  
so as to include a vast mass of water in  
each wave, which, in its motion, acts  
with great.violence. But if there be a  
mutual repulsion between the particles  
of oil, and no attraction bctw ecu oil  
and Avater, oildropt on Avaler will not  
be held together by adhesion to the spot  
on which it falls ; it will not be  
imbibed by the water; but be at liberty

face, that prevents, perhaps,  
by&#x27;repeliing the oil, all im-mediate  
contact ; the: expansion will continue  
till the mutual repulsion between the  
paticles of oil is weak-ened and reduced  
to nothing by their distance. Dr.  
Franklin imagines, that the wind,  
blowing over water, thus covered with  
afilm of oil, cannot easily catch upon  
it, so as to raise the first wrinkles,  
nut slides over it, and leaves it smooth  
as it finds it. It moves a little the  
oil, indeed, which, being between it and  
the water, serves it to slide Avith, and  
prevents friction : hence the oil, dropt  
on the windward side of the pond,  
proceeds gradually to leeward, as may be  
seen by the smooth-ness it carries with  
it quite to the opposite side : for the  
wind, being thus prevented from raising  
the first wrin-kles, which he calls the  
elements of Avaves, cannot produce  
Avaves, Avhich are to be made by  
continually acting upon and enlarging  
those elements, and thus the Avhole pond  
is calmed Upon the whole, there is great  
room to suppose (notwithstanding th

The incident which first drew Franklin’s attention  
to this subject he thus narrates :—‘ In 1757, being at  
sea in a fleet of ninety-six sail bound against Louis-  
bourg, I observed the wakes of two of the ships to be  
remarkably smooth, while all the others were ruffled  
by the wind, which blew fresh. Being puzzled with  
the differing appearance, I at last pointed it out to our  
captain, and asked him the meaning of it. ‘The cooks,’  
said he, ‘ have, I sup , been just emptying their  
greasy water through the scuppers, which has greased  
the sides of those ships a little!’ and this answer he  
gave me with an air of some little contempt, as toa  
person ignorant of what everybody else knew. In my  
own mind J at first slighted his solution, though I was  
not able to think of another.”

He showed that organised structure had nothing to do  
with the matter, for he produced similar movements  
by placing on the surface of water small oiled chips  
cut into the form of a comma (,); as the oil issued from  
the point of the comma, the chips began to rotate.  
  
The explanation which Franklin offered of the seda-  
tive effect of the oil upon waves is very ingenious. Air,  
when in motion, in the shape of wind, over the surface  
of smooth water, probably rubs, as it were, on that sur-  
face, and raises it into wrinkles, which, if the wind con-  
tinues, are the elements of future waves. The smallest  
wave, once raised, does not immediately subside and  
leave the neighbouring water quiet; but in subsiding  
raises nearly as much of the water next to it, in the  
same way as a stone dropped into water raises a series  
of concentric waves axound it. As a small power  
continually in operation will produce a great effect, so  
the small first-raised waves, being continually acted  
on by the wind, are, though the wind does not increase  
in strength, continually increased in magnitude, rising  
higher and extending their basis, so as to includea  
vast mass of water in each wave, which in its motion  
acts with great violence. This being the mode i

repulsive power which drives the particles of oil one  
from another, extending them into a film of the  
greatest possible tenuity. “ Now,” says he, “I ima-  
gine that the wind blowing over water thus covered  
with a fiim of oil cannot easily catch upon it, so as to  
raise the first wrinkles, but slides over it, and leaves it  
smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil, indeed,  
which, being between it and the water, serves it to  
slide with, and prevents friction, as oil does between  
those parts of a machine that would otherwise rub hard  
together. Hence the oil dropped on the windward  
side of a pond proceeds gradually to leeward, as may  
be seen by the smoothness it carries with it, quite to the  
opposite side ; for the wind being thus prevented from  
raising the first wrinkles, that I call the elements of  
waves, cannot produce waves, and thus the whole  
pond is calmed.”*

it finds it.

side of a pond proceeds gradually to leeward, as may  
be secon by the smoothness it carries with it, quite to  
the opposite side; for the wind being thus prevented  
from raising the first wrinkles, that I call the ele-

“ In 1757, being at sea in a fleet of ninety­  
six sail bound for Louisbourg, I observed the  
wakes of two of the ships to be remarkably  
smooth, while all the others were ruffled by  
the wind, which blew fresh. Being puzzled  
with the differing appearance, I at last point­  
ed it out to our captain, and asked him the  
meaning of it. ‘ The cooks,’ said he, &#x27;‘have,  
I suppose, been just emptying their greasy  
water through the scuppers, which has  
greased the sides of those ships a little;” and  
this answer he gave me with an air of some  
little contempt, as to a person ignorant of  
what everybody else knew. In my own  
mind I at first slighted his solution, though I  
was not able to think of another.

upon a polished marble table, or on a looking-

place, spreading very little ; but when put on  
water, it spreads instantly all round, becoming  
so thin as to produce the prismatic colours

blackness which optical philosophers know to

all the others were ruffled by a fresh-blowing  
wind. The captain on being appealed to for  
an assignable cause, expressed a supposition

had greased the sides of those two ships a

anchored about a quarter of a mile from  
the shore. A barge plied to windward of the  
long boat, as far from her as she was from  
the shore, making trips of about half a mile  
each ; oil being continually poured from her,  
out of a large stone bottle, through a hole  
in the cork about as large as a goose-quill. A  
party of observers placed themselves on the  
shore, in a position to note if any change  
were produced in the surf by the aciion of  
the oil. Franklin did not find the effect  
upon the surf to be so great as he expected ;  
but the persons in the long-boat could ob-  
serve a tract of smooth water the whole length  
of the distance on which the oil was poured,  
gradually spreading in breadth towards the  
long-boat. This water was smooth, but not  
actually level. The swell continued ; but the  
surface was not ruffled by wrinkles or  
smaller waves; and there were none of the  
waves called by sailors “ white caps” (waves  
whose tops turn over in foam), although  
there was abundance of this kind of wave  
both to windward and leeward the oily  
space. A wherry, that came round the  
point under sail, in her way to Portsmouth,  
seemed to turn into that oily track by choice,

upon a polished marble table, or on a looking-

water, it spreads instantly all round, becoming  
so thin as to produce the prismatic colours

region of these colours, to present that peculiar  
blackness which optical philosophers know to  
be attributable to a film whose thickness is  
to be estimated by millionths rather than by  
thousandths of an inch. It would appear as  
if a mutual repulsion took place between the  
particles of oil as soon as it touches water: a  
repulsion so strong as to act on other bodies  
swimming on the surface, as straws, leaves,  
chips, &amp;c., forcing them to recede every way  
from the drop as from a centre, leaving a  
large clear space.

somewhere near Portsmouth, whether he could  
lessen the surf on a lee shore, by means of oil.  
  
He selected a windy day, which gave the char- |

anchored about a quarter of a mile from theshore.  
A barge plied to windward of the long boat, as

trips of about half a mile each ; oil being contin-

ledge of one who had great aptitude for ferreting out  
the causes of thin mjamin Franklin. What he  
did and what he thought on the subject were after-  
wards placed upon record in the sixty-fourth volume  
of the Prt ical Transactions. How his attention  
became first di to the matter, he thus tells us:  
  
‘In 1757, being at sea, in a fleet of ninety-six sail, | face  
  
bound ibourg, I observed the wakes of  
two of the ships to be remarkably smooth, while all  
= others —_ — by the wind, which “4 —

meaning of it. “The cooks,” said he, “ have, I suppose,  
been just emptying their greasy water thro the  
sew which have greased the sides of those ships  
a little.” And this answer he gave me with an air of  
some little contempt, as to a person ignorant of what  
every else knew. In my own mind, I at first  
slighted his solution, though I was not able to think  
of another.’ In after-years, the circumstance came to  
his recollection, corroborated by many facts which had  
been communicated to him, and he resolved, thoroughly  
hilosopher as he was, to find out really  
does smooth the waves, and why it does so.  
The first thing he did was to make an iment  
in a pond on Clapham Common. He dropped « litle  
oil on + A ang *T saw it . with sur-  
isi iftness upon the si ut the effect of

Ww the waves were largest, and the wind drove m  
oil back upon the shore. I then went to the wind-  
ward-side, where they began to form ; and there the  
oil, though not more than a teaspoonful, produced an  
instant calm over a surface several yards square,  
which spread amazingly, and extended itself gradu-  
ally till it reached the lee-side, making all the quarter  
of the pond—perhaps half an acre—as smooth as a  
looking-glass.’ If —— figures ay cea, thi

into a film of exquisite tenuity. ‘I imagine,’ he says,  
‘that the wind blowing over water thus covered  
with a film of oil cannot easily catch upon it, so as to  
raise the first wrinkles, but shdes over it, and leaves  
it smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil,  
indeed, which, being between it and the water, serves  
it to slide with, and prevents friction, as oil does  
between those parts of a machine that would other-  
wise rub hard pp Hence the oil dro on  
the windward-side of a pond proceeds ually to  
leeward, as may be seen by the smoothness it carries  
with it, quite to the opposite side ; for the wind bein  
thus prevented from raising the first wrinkles, whic  
I call the elements of waves, cannot produce the  
waves themselves; and thus the whole pond is  
calmed.’ The experiment at Portsmouth shewed  
that oil has not the effect of destroying the waves  
themselves: it reduces them to calm and gently  
swelling undulations. When the wind blows fresh,  
there are continually rising on the back of every great  
wave a number of small waves, which roughen its  
surface, and give the wind a kind of hold or purchase

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN ON THE USE OF OIL  
AT SEA.  
  
Dr Benjamin Franklin was a believer in what  
has been frequently pointed out in this Journal,  
namely, the power of oil to still the agitation of  
water, and he records several experiments as the  
ground of his belief. In a letter to Dr Brownrigg  
in 1773, he mentions that in 1757 he observed the  
wakes of two ships to be remarkably smooth,  
while the wakes of all the others were ruffled by  
the wind, which blew fresh. The captain of  
Franklin’s ship explained this by supposing that  
the cooks of the two ships had been emptying  
their greasy water through the scuppers. He was  
informed by fellow-passengers that the Bermu-  
dians when they would strike fish, the Lisbon  
fishermen when the surf was high on the bar, and  
Mediterranean divers when the rufiling of th

was, that Sir John Pringle learned in Scotland  
that herring-fishers could see at a distance where  
shoals of herring were by the smoothness of the  
water over them ; the erent being that some  
oiliness proceeded from the bodies of the herrings.  
The other story was that the harbour of Newport,  
Rhode Island, was observed to be always smooth  
while any whaling-vessels were in it. Franklin  
goes on to say that he showed his experiment to  
Count Bentinck of Holland, his son Captain  
Bentinck, and Professor Allemand, on ‘a large  
piece of water at the head of the Green Park ;’ and

half a mile from the shore, on a windy day. The  
experiment was but partially successful, since no  
material difference was observed in the height or  
force of the surf upon the shore; but there was  
a long tract of smoothed, not level water ; ‘and a  
wherry, on her way to Portsmouth, seemed to turn  
into that tract of choice, and to use it from end  
to end, as a piece of turnpike road.’ Franklin  
accounted for the want of complete success in this  
instance, by conjecturing that the mechanical force  
of the waves already raised by the wind must go  
on until exhausted, as a pendulum continues to  
swing after the original impulse has been with-  
drawn. He held, however, that the oil diminished  
the action of the wind on the waves already raised,  
  
and that it prevented the wind from raising new  
waves, He seems to accept Pliny’s statement, that  
the seamen of his time stilled the waves by pour-  
ing oil into the sea; and he adds: ‘It has been of  
late too much the mode to slight the learning of  
the ancients. The learned, too, are apt to slight  
too much the knowledge of the vulgar. The cool-  
ing by evaporation was long an instance of the  
latter. This art of smoothing the waves by oil is  
an instance of both.’

what I had formerly read in Pliny, I  
resolved to make some experiment of the  
effect of oil on water when I should have  
opportunity. Being again at sea in 1702,  
an old sea captain told me he had heard  
it was a practice with the fishermen  
of Lisbon when about to return into the  
river (if they saw before tliem too great  
a surf upon the bar, which they appre­  
hended might fill their boats in passing)  
to empty a bottle or two of oil into the  
sea, which would suppress the breakers,  
and allow them to pass safely. All these  
informations I at times revolved in my  
mind, and wondered to find no mention  
of them in our books of experimental  
philosophy.&quot; These circumstances are  
related in the now scarce magazine re­  
ferred to, and have not yet, to the writ­  
er&#x27;s knowledge, been mentioned in con­  
nection with the recently revived use of  
Oil. i  
The much-desired chance presented  
itself to Dr. Franklin in no less a place  
than the classic region of Clapham.  
There was probably is yet- on the com­  
mon there a large pond, which one day  
being &quot;rough with wind,&quot; the worthy  
doctor marched off and fetched a cruet  
oil, a little of which he dropped on  
the water. The soothing unction spread  
itself with &quot;surprising swiftness&quot; upon  
i the surface. Though not more than a  
teaspoonful, it produced an instant calm  
orer a space several yards square, which  
spread amazingly, and extended itself  
gradually till it reached the lee side,  
making all that quarter of the pond, per­  
haps half an acre, as smooth as alook-inff-elass.  
After this the delightful doctor  
took with him whenever ho went into  
the country a little oil in the upper hol­  
low joint of his bamboo cane, with which  
he repeated the experiment as opportu­  
nity offered, and found it always to suc­  
ceed. In these trials, one circumstance,

as to act on other bodies swimming on  
the surface, as straws, leaves, ehips.etc,

take a little oil in their mouths before they dived ; when  
they had descended to a certain depth they allowed the  
  
escape of the oil, which, rising to the surface by virtue of |  
  
its lightness, spread in a thin film, which smoothed the  
water rippies and allowed light to descend to a considerable  
depth. The fishermen of Lisbon, when about to return into  
the river, it they saw before them too great a surf upon the  
bar, were accustomed to empty a bottle or two of oil into  
the sea, to still the breakers,”  
  
Franklin thus narrates: ‘‘ In 1757, being at sea in a fleet  
of ninety-six sail, bound against Louisbourg, I observed the  
wakes of twe of the ships to be remarkably smooth, while  
all the others were ruffied by the wind, which blew fresh.  
Being puzzled with the differing appearance, I at last  
pointed it out to our captain, and asked him the meaning of  
it. ‘The cooks,’ said he, ‘have, I suppose, been just  
emptying their greasy weter through the scuppers, which  
  
hus greased the sides of those ships a little !’ and this an- |  
  
swer he gave me with an air of some little contempt, as to a)  
person ignorant of what everybody knew. In my own  
mind I at first slighted this solution, though I was not able  
to think of another.”

tbrowing up a iittle vinegar into the air.  
  
Extract of a letter to Dr. Brownrigg, from  
Dr. Franklin, dated Landon, November 7th  
1773.  
  
Dear Sir—I thank you for the remarks of  
your learned friend at Carlisle. I had when  
@ youth, read and smiled ct Pliny’s  
account of a practice among seamen of  
his time, to still the wavos in a otorm  
by pouring oil into the sea, which he men-  
tions, as well as the uso made of oil by  
the diver; but the stilling a tempest by throw-  
ing vinegar intothe air had escaped me. I  
think, with your friend, that it has been of late  
too much the mode to slight the learning of the  
Ancients. The learned, too, are apt to slight  
too much the knowledge of the vulgar.  
  
The cooling by evaporation was long an in-  
tance of the latter. This art of smoothing the  
waves bylfoil is an instance of both,  
  
” + * * * . *  
  
In 1757, being at sea in a fleet of ninety-six  
sail bound against Louisbourg,I observed the  
wakes of two of the ships to be remark-  
ably smooth, while all the others were ruffied  
by the wind, which blewfresh. Being puzzled  
with the different appearance, I at last pointed  
it out to our captain, and asked him the jmecan-  
ing of it. “The cooks,” says he, “have, I sup-  
pose, been just emptying their greasy water  
through the scuppers, which has greased the  
sides of those ships a little.” At this answer  
he gave me with an air of some little contempt,  
astoa person ignorant of what everybody  
else knew. In my own mind, I at first slighted  
his solution, though I was not able to think of  
another; but recollecting what I had formerly  
read in Pliny, I resolved to make some experi-  
ment of the effect of oil on water, when I  
should hare onn-rtunity.

An old sea captain told me he had heard it  
was 1 practice with the fishermen of Lisbon,  
when about to return into the river (if they saw  
before them too great a surf upon the bar,  
which they apprehended might fill their boats  
in passing), to empty a bottle or two of oil into  
the sea, which would suppress the breakers and  
allow them to pass safely.  
  
A confirmation of thisI have not since had  
an opportunity of obtaining; but, discoursing  
of it with another person, who had often been  
in the Mediterranean, I was informed that the  
divers there, who, when under water in their  
business, need light, which the curling of the  
surface interrupts by refractions of so many  
little waves, let a smal! quantity of oil now and  
then out of their mouths, which, rising to the  
surface, smooths it,and permits the light to  
come down to them. All these informations I  
at times revolved in my mind, and wondered to  
find nomention of them in our books of ex-  
perimental philosophy.  
  
At length, being at Clapham, where there is,  
on the common, &amp; large pond, which I observed  
one day to be very rough with the wind,I  
fetched out a little cruet of oil and dropped a  
little of it on the water. Isaw it spread itself  
with surprising swiftness upon the surface, but  
the effect of smoothing the waves was not pro-  
duced, for I had applied it first on the leeward  
side of the pond, where the waves were largest,  
and the wind drove my oil back upon the shore.  
I then went to the windward side, where they  
began to form; and there the oil, though not  
more than a teaspoonful produced an instant  
calm over &amp; space several yards square, which  
spread amazingly, and extonded itecif gradually  
till it reached the lee side, making all that  
quarter of the pond, perhaps half and acre, as  
smooth as a looking-glass,  
  
After this I contrivod to take with mo, when-  
ever I went into the country, a littie oil in the  
upper hollow joint of my bamboo cane, with  
which I might repeat the experiment as oppor-  
tunity should offer, and I found it constantly  
to sueceed.  
  
In those experiments, one circumstance  
struck me with particular surprise. This was  
the sudden, wide and forciblo spreading of a  
drop of oil on the face of the watcr, whioh I  
do not know that anybody hag hitherto con-  
sidered.  
  
If a drop of oil is put on a highly polished  
marble table, or On a looking glass that lies  
horizontally, the drop remains in its place,  
spreading very little. But, when put on the  
water, it spreads instantly many feet roundc  
bocoming so thin asto produce the prismati-  
colors, for a considerable space, and boyond  
them so much thinner as to be invisible, oxcept  
in ita cffect of emoothing the waves at a much  
greater distance.  
  
It seems as if a mutual repulsion between its  
particles took place as soon as it touched the  
water, and a repulsion so strong as to act on  
other bodies swimming on the surface, as  
straw, leaves, etc., forcing them to rocede every  
way from the drop, as from a center, leaving a  
large, clear space.  
  
The quantity of this ferce,and the distance |  
  
to which it will operate, Ihave not yet ascer-  
tained; but I think ita curious inquiry, and |  
wish to understand whence it arises.

Our friend, Sir John Pringle, being soon  
after in Scotland, learned there, that those em-  
ployed in the herring fishery could at s dis-  
tance see where the shoals of herrings were,  
by the smoothness of the water over them,  
which might possibly be occasioned, he  
thought, by some oiliness proceeding from  
their bodies. A gentleman from Rhode Island  
told me it had been remarked that the harbor  
of Newport was ever smooth while any whal-  
ing vessels wore in it, which probably arose  
from henee, that the blubber which they  
sometimes bring looge in the hold, or the loak-  
age of their barrels, might afford somo oil, to  
mix with thet weter, which from time to time  
they pump ont, to keep their vessel free, and  
that some oil might spread over the surface of  
the water in the harbor, and prevent the form-  
ing of any waves.  
  
This prevention I would thus endeavor to  
explain:  
  
There seems to be no natural repulsion be-  
tween water and air, such as to keep them  
from coming into contact with each other.  
Hence we find a quantity of air in water, and if  
we extract it by means of the air pump, the  
same water, again exposed to the air, will soon  
imbibe an equal quantity.  
  
Therefore, air in motion, which is wind, in  
passing over the smooth surface of water, may  
rub, as it were, upon that surface and raise it  
in wrinkles, which, if the wind continues, are  
the elements of future waves.

Thus, the small, first-raised waves, being con-  
tinually acted upon by the wind, are, though  
the wind does not increase in strength, con-  
tinually increased in magnitude, rising higher  
and extending their bases,so as to include a  
vast mass of water in each wave, which, in its  
motion, acts with great violence.  
  
But if there be a mutual repulsion between  
the particles of oil, and no attraction between  
oil and water, oil dropped on water will not be  
held together by adhesion to the spot whereon  
it falls; it will not beimbibed by the water; it  
will be at liberty to expand itself; and it will  
spread on a surface that, besides being smooth  
to the most perfect degree of polish, prevents,  
perbaps by repelling the oil, all immediate con-  
  
  
  
tact, keeping it at a minute distance from  
itself; and the expansion will continue until the  
mutual repulsion between the particles of the  
oil is weakened and reduced to nothing by their  
distance.  
  
Now, I imagine that the wind, blowing over  
watar thus covered by a film of oil, cannot  
easily catch upon it,co as to raise the first  
wrinkles, but slides over it, and leaves it as  
smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil  
indeed, which, being between it and the water,  
serves it to slide with, and prevents friction, as  
oil does between those parts of a machine that  
would otherwise rub hard together,  
  
Hence, the oil dropped on the windward side  
of a pond proceeds gradually to leeward, as  
may be seen by the smoothness it carrie3 with  
it, quite to the opposite side. Fer the wind  
being thus prevented from raising! the first  
wrinkles—that I call the elements of a wave—  
cannot produce waves, which are to be made  
by continually acting upon and enlarging those  
elements, and thus the whole pond is calmed.  
  
Totally, therefore, we might suppress the  
waves in any required place, if we could come  
at the windward place where they take their  
rise. This, in the ocean, can seldom if ever be  
done. But perhaps something may be done on  
particular oceasions to moderate the violence  
of the waves when we are in the midst of  
them, and prevent their breaking, where that  
would be inconvenient.  
  
For, when the wind blows fresh, there are  
continually rising on the back of every great  
wave a number of small ones, which roughen  
ita surface and give the wind hold, as it were,  
to push it with greater force. This hold is di-  
minished by preventing the generation of  
those smail ones. And possibly, too, when a  
wave’s surface is oiled, the wind in passing  
over it may rather in some degree press it  
down, and contribute to prevent its rising  
again, instead of promoting it. This, as mere  
conjecture, would have little weight if the  
apparent effects of pouring oil into the midst  
of waves were not considerable, and as yet not  
otherwise accounted for.  
  
When the wind blows so fresh as that the  
waves are not sufficiently quick in obeying its  
impulse; their tops, being thinner and lighter,  
are pushed forward, broken, and turned over  
ina white foam. Common waves lift a vessel  
without entering it; but these, when large,  
sometimes break above and pour over it, doing  
great damage.  
  
But that this effect might in any degree be  
prevented, or the height and violence of waves  
in the sea moderated, we had no certain ac-  
count, Pliny’s authority for the practice of  
seamen in his time being slighted.  
  
Diseoursing lately on this subject with his  
excellency, Count Bentinck of Holland, his  
son, the Honorable Capt. Bentinck, and the  
learned professor, Allemand, a letter was men-  
tioned which had been received by the Count  
from Batavia, relative to the saving of a Dutch  
ship in a storm, by pouring oilinto the sea, I  
much desired to see that letter, and a copy of it  
was promised me, which I afterward received.

Franklin, being at sea in a fleet of ninety­  
six sail bound for Louisburg, observed the  
wakus of two of the ships to be remarkably

the wind, which blew&#x27; fresh. Being puzzled,

It is a curious fact that if a drop of oil  
is put on a highly polished marblo table  
or a largo plato glass that lie3 horizon­  
tally, the drop remains in place, spread­  
ing very little; but when put on water  
it spreads instantly many feet around,  
becoming so thin as to produce tho pris­  
matic colors for a considerables space,  
and beyond them bo much thinner as  
to bo invisible. It would appear that a  
natural repulsion takes place as soon as it  
touches the water, a repulsion so strong  
as to act upon other bodies swimming  
on tho surface, as straw, leaves, chips,  
etc., forcing them to recede every way  
from the drop, as from a center, loav­  
ing a large, clear area. There seems,  
however, to be no repulsion between  
water and air to keep them from com  
ing in contact with each other. Air in  
motion or wind in passing over tho  
smooth surface of water may rub it, as  
it were, upon the surface and  
rise it in wrinkles, which, if the  
wind continues, are the elements of fu­  
ture waves. If there bo a mutual re­  
pulsion between the particles of oil,  
and no attraction between oil and wa­  
ter, oil dropped on water will not bo  
hold together it will bo at liberty to  
expand itself. Tho wind blowing over  
tho water thus covered by a film of oil  
can not easily catch upon it so as to  
raises the first wrinkles, but slides over  
it and leaves it smooth; it moves the  
oil a little, which, being between it and  
the water, seems to slide with and pre­  
vent friction. When tho wind blows  
fresh there are continually rising on  
the back of every great wave a number

 that when seals  
were devouring a very oily fish under water (which they fre-  
quently do) the waves above became remarkably smooth ;  
and at Newport, in Rhode Island, the sea was generally  
found to be smooth while any whaling ships were in the  
harbor, from which it was inferred that the leakage from  
the oil-barrels had been pumped up with the bilge-water  
from the holds of the ships and emptied into the ocean.  
  
Now, some of these facts came to the knowledge of that  
great inductive philosopher, Benjamin Franklin; and how  
his attention became first directed to the matter he has  
himself told us: ‘“ In 1757, being at sea, in a fleet of ninety-  
six sail, bound against Louisbourg, I observed the wakes  
of two of the ships to be remarkably smooth, while all the  
others were ruffled by the wind, which blew fresh. Being  
puzzled with the differing appearance, I at last pointed it  
out to our captain and asked him the meaning of it. ‘The  
cooks,’ said he, ‘ have, I suppose, been just emptying their  
greasy water through the scuppers, which has greased the  
sides of those ships a little.” And this answer he gave me  
with an air of some little contempt. In my own mind I  
at first slighted his solution, though I was not able to think  
of another.”  
  
But in after years the circumstance recurred to Frank-  
lin, corroborated by many other facts, and he resolved to  
find out whether oil really does smooth the waves, and why  
it does so. The first thing he did was to make an experi

ment on a pond at Clapham Common (London). He  
dropped a little oil on the water. ‘‘I saw it spread itself,”  
he says, “ with surprising swiftness upon the surface, but  
the effect of smoothing the waves was not produced, for I  
had applied it first upon the leeward side of the pond,  
where the waves were largest, and the wind drove my oil  
back upon the shore. I then went to the windward side,  
where they began to form; and there the oil, though not  
more than a teaspoonful, produced an instant calm over a  
surface several yards square, which spread amazingly and  
extended itself gradually till it reached the lee side, making  
all the quarter of the pond—perhaps half an acre—as  
smooth as a looking-glass.”  
  
His next experiment consisted in the use of a bamboo  
walking-stick, into the upper joint of which he put a little  
oil whenever he was about to walk into the country. This  
enabled him to confirm the result of the former experiment  
over and over again. On one occasion, while on a visit  
to Smeaton, the engineer, Franklin was told by Jessop,  
who afterwards became eminent in the same walk of life,  
that some flies, drowned ina cup of oil, were seen to rotate  
and move about as if alive. Franklin having before ob-

markably smooth, while all the others were  
ruffled by the wind, which blew fresh. Being  
puzzled with the differing appearance, I at  
last pointed it out to our captain, and asked  
him the meaning of it. ‘The cooks,’ said he,  
‘have, I suppose, been just emptying their  
greasy water through the scuppers, which  
has greased the sides of those ships a little.’  
And this answer he gave me with an air of  
some little contempt, as to a person ignorant  
of what everybody else knew. In my own  
mind I at first slighted his solution, though  
I was not able to think of another.” How

At length being at Clapham, where there is, on  
the common, a large pond, which I observed one  
day to be very rough with the wind, I fetched out  
a cruet of oil, and dropped a little of it on the  
water. I saw it spread itself with surprising  
swiftness upon the surface; but the effect of  
smoothing the waves was not produced; for I had  
applied it first on the leeward side of the pond,  
where the waves were greatest; and the wind  
drove my oil back upon the shore. I then went to  
the windward side where they began to forin; and  
there the oil, though not more than a teaspoonful,  
produced an instant calm over a space several  
yards square, which spread amazingly, and ex-  
tended itself gradually till it reached the lee side,  
making all that quarter of the pond, perhaps half  
an acre, as smooth as a looking-glass. After this  
I contrived to take with me, whenever I went into  
the country, a little oil in the upper hollow joint  
of my bamboo cane, with which I might repeat the  
experiment as opportunity should offer, and I found  
it constantly to succeed.
