 in the senate.  
I. The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished from those of representatives, consist in a more advanced age, and a longer period of citizenship. A senator must be thirty years of age at least; as a representative, must be twenty-five. And the former must have been a citizen nine years; as seven years are required for the latter. The propriety of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the senatorial trust; which requiring greater extent of information and stability of character, requires at the same time that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages; and which participating immediately in transactions with foreign nations, ought to be exercised by none who are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits incident to foreign birth and education. The term of nine years appears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of adopted citizens, whose merit and talents may claim a share in the public confidence; and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of them, which might create a channel for foreign influence on the national councils.  
II. It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of senators by the state legislatures. Among the various modes which might have been devised for constituting this branch of the government, that which has been proposed by the convention is probably the most congenial with the public opinion. It is recommended by the double advantage of favouring a select appointment, and of giving to the state governments such an agency in the formation of the federal government, as must secure the authority of the former; and may form a convenient link between the two systems.  
III. The equality of representation in the senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small states, does not call for much discussion. If

rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the sacrifice.  
In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed to each state, is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual states, and an instrument for preserving that residuary sovereignty. So far the equality ought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small states; since they are not less solicitous to guard by every possible expedient against an improper consolidation of the states into one simple republic.  
Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the constitution of the senate, is the additional impediment it must prove against improper acts of legislation. No law or resolution can now be passed without the concurrence first of a majority of the people, and then of a majority of the states. It must be acknowledged that this

cies which a republic must suffer from the want of such an institution.  
First. It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in a less degree than to other governments, that those who administer it, may forget their obligations to their constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust. In this point of view, a senate, as a second branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles the security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one, would otherwise be sufficient. This is a precaution founded on such clear principles, and now so well understood in the United States, that it would be more than superfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark that as the improbability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies; it must be politic to distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will consist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the genuine principles of republican government.  
Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies, to yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by factious leaders, into intemperate and pernicious resolutions. Examples on this subject might be cited without number; and from proceedings within the United States, as well as from the history of other nations. But a position that will not be contradicted need not be proved. All that need be remarked is that a body which is to correct this infirmity ought itself be free from it, and consequently ought to be less numerous. It ought moreover to possess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its authority by a tenure of considerable duration.  
Thirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of legislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called for the most part from the pursuits of a private nature, continued in appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws, the affairs and the comprehensive interests of their country, should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of important errors in the exercise of their legislative trust. It may be affirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our governments; and that these have proceeded from the heads rather than the hearts of most of the authors of them. What indeed are all the repealing, explaining and amending laws, which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient wisdom; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding, against each preceding session; so many admonitions to the people of the value of those aids which may be expected from a well constituted senate?  
A good government implies two things; first, fidelity to the object of government, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best attained. Some governments are deficient in both these qualities: Most governments are deficient in the first. I scruple not to assert that in the American governments, too little attention has been paid to the last. The federal constitution avoids this error; and what merits particular notice, it provides for the last in a mode which increases the security for the first.  
Fourthly. The mutability in the public councils, arising from a rapid succession of new members, however qualified they may be, points out in the strongest manner, the necessity of some stable institution in the government. Every new election in the states, is found to change one half of the representatives. From this change of men must proceed a change of opinions; and from a change of opinions, a change of measures. But a continual change even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence, and every prospect of success. The remark is verified in private life, and becomes more just as well as more important, in national transactions.  
To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would fill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be perceived to be a source of innumerable others.  
In the first place it forfeits the respect and confidence of other nations, and all the advantages connected with national character. An individual who is observed to be inconstant to his plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all, is marked at once by all prudent people as a speedy victim to his own unsteadiness and folly. His more friendly neighbours may pity him; but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his; and not a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of his. One nation is to another what one individual is to another; with this melancholy distinction perhaps, that the former with fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer restraints also from taking undue advantage of the indiscretions of each other. Every nation consequently whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability, may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of its wiser neighbours. But the best instruction on this subject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example of her own situation. She finds that she is held in no respect by her friends; that she is the derision of her enemies; and that she is a prey to every nation which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and embarrassed affairs.  
The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more calamitous. It poisons the blessings of liberty itself. It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulged, or undergo such incessant changes that no man who knows what the law is to day can guess what it will be to morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how can that be a rule, which is little known and less fixed?  
Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable advantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising and the moneyed few, over the industrious and uninformed mass of the people. Every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue; or in any manner affecting the value of the different species of property, presents a new harvest to those who watch the change, and can trace its consequences; a harvest reared not by themselves but by the toils and cares of the great body of their fellow citizens. This is a state of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws are made for the few not for the many

nstable government. The want of confidence in the public councils damps every useful undertaking; the success and profit of which may depend on a continuance of existing arrangements. What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce, when he knows not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed? What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the encouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment, when he can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant government?

ble institution in the government. Every new election in the  
states, is found to change one-half of the representatives. From  
this change of men must proceed a change of opinions; and from  
a change of opinions a change of measures. But a continual  
change even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule  
of prudence, and every prospect of success. The remark is ve-  
rified in private life, and becomes more just, as well as more  
important, in national transactions.

For, it is manifest, that the Legislature is the fav­

have been so, for the Senator was created to represent  
the sovereignty of the Slate. This mode of appoint­

passage is so instructive that we quote it at length:  
&quot;It is a misfortune incident to republican government,  
though in a less degree than to other governments, that  
those who administer it may forget their obligations  
to their constituents, and prove unfaithful to their im  
portant trust. In this point of view a Senate, as a second  
branch of the Legislative Assembly, distinct from and di­  
viding the power with a first, must be in all cases a salutary  
check on the Government. It doubles the security to the  
people by requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in  
schemes of usurpation and perfidy, where the ambition or  
corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient. This is  
a precaution founded on such clear principles and now so  
well understood in the United States that it would be  
more than superfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely re­  
mark that, as the improbability of sinister combinations  
will be in proportion to the dissimilarity in the genius of  
the two bodies, it must be politic to distinguish them  
from each other by every circumstance which will consist  
with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the  
genuine principles of republican government.&quot;

‘ To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would fill  
a volume : I will only hint a few, each of which will be perceived to he  
the source of innumerable others. In the first place, it forfeits the  
respect and confidence of other nations, and all the advantages connected  
with national character. An individual who is observed to be incon¬  
sistent in his plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan  
at all, is marked at once by all prudent people as a speedy victim to  
his own unsteadiness and folly. His more friendly neighbours may  
pity him, but all will decline to connect their fortunes with him; and  
not a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of  
his. Every nation whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability  
may calculate on every loss that can be sustained from the more  
systematic policy of its wiser neighbours. But the best instruction  
on this subject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example  
of her own situation. She finds that she is held in no respect by her  
friends ; that she is the derision of her enemies; and that she is a  
prey to every nation which has an interest in speculating on her  
fluctuating councils and embarrassed affairs. . . . The want of con¬  
fidence in the public councils damps every useful undertaking, the  
success and profit of which may depend on a continuance of all existing

The necessity of a Senate was not less  
indicated by the propensity of all  
single and numerous assemblies to yield

passions, and to be seduced by factious  
leaders into intemperate and pernicious

is to correct this infirmity ought to be  
free from it, and consequently ought to  
be less numerous and to possess a-due  
degree of firmness and a proper tenure  
of office. 3. Another defect to be  
supplied by a Senate lay in the want of  
a due ac(maintanco with th.e objects and

Government implies two things— Firstly,  
fidelity to the objects of tho

check on the government,’’ (ibid).  
  
‘« The necessity of a senate is not  
  
less indicated by the propensity of  
  
all single and numerous assemblies  
to yield to the impulse of sudden  
and violent passions, and to be se-  
duced by factious leaders into in-  
temperate and pernicious resolu-  
tions,’’ (pp. 387-8).  
  
**. . . . a body which is to cor  
rect this infirmity ought itself to be  
free from it, and consequently ought  
to be less numerous,’’ (p. 388).  
  
‘«It ought, moreover, to possess  
great firmness, and consequently  
ought to hold its authority by a  
tenure of considerable duration,’’  
(p. 385).  
  
‘* Another defect to be supplied  
by a senate lies in a want of due  
acquaintance with the objects and  
principles of legislation. It is not  
possible that an assembly of men  
called for the most part from pur-  
suits of a private nature, continued  
in appointment for a short time and  
led by no permanent motive to de-  
vote the intervals of public occupa-  
tion to a study of the laws, the af  
fairs, and the comprehensive inter  
ests of their country, should, if  
wholly left to themselves, escape a  
variety of important errors in the  
exercise of their legislative trust,’’

that object can be best attained.
