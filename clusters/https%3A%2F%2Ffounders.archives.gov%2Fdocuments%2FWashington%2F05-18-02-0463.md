Sir  
Paris Sepr 20 1795  
  
I had written you a letter by Mr Letombe french Consul but at the request of Mr Monroe I withdrew it and the letter is still by me I was the more easily prevailed upon to do this as it was then my intention to have returned to America the latter end of this year (1795) but the illness I now suffer prevents me. In case I had come I should have applied to you for copies of such parts of your official letters (and of your private ones if you had chosen to give them) as contained any instruction or directions either to Mr Morris or to Mr Monroe or to any other person respecting me; for after you were ⟨infor⟩med of my imprisonment it was incumbent upon you to have ⟨mad⟩e enquiry into the Cause, as you might very well conclude that I had not the opportunity of informing you of it. I cannot understand your silence upon that head upon any other ground than as connivance at my imprisonment; and this is the manner it is understood here and will be understood in America unless you give me authority for contradicting it. I therefore write you this letter to propose to you to send me Copies of any letters you may have written that may remove that Suspicion. In the preface to the second part of the Age of Reason I have given a memorandum from the hand writing of Robespiére in which he proposed a decree of Accusation against me “for the interest of America as well as of France”—He could have had no Cause for putting America into the Case but by interpreting the Silence of the American Government into Connivance and Consent—I was imprisoned on the ground of being born in England, and your silence in not enquiring into  
  
the Cause of that imprisonment and reclaiming me against it was tacitly giving me up. I ought not to have suspected you of Treachery, but whether I recover from the illness I now suffer or not I must continue to think you treacherous till you give me Cause to think otherwise. I am sure you would have found yourself more at your ease if you had acted by me as you ought, for whether your desertion of me was intended to gratify the English Government, or to let me fall into destruction in France that you might exclaim the louder against the french revolution, or whether you hoped by my extinction to meet with less opposition in mounting up the American government, either of these will involve you in reproach you will not easily shake off.

_ PA&#x27;RIS, Sept. zsioth, 1795.  
er,  
I had written you a letter by Mr. Le­  
si tomhe. French consJF, but at the request  
of Mr. &#x27;Monroe, I withdrew it, and the1  
letterlis still by&#x27;me. 1 was the more eztsysisi*  
prevailed upon toct-do this, &#x27;as it was then  
my intention to have returned to America,  
&quot;he lzttter&#x27;en-l ofthesipresiscnt year, 79; ;&quot;  
sir&#x27;mt the iilnessl now suﬀer prevents me.­  
{ in ease I had come, l should have applied _  
_ :oyou for such parts of your oﬄcial letters &#x27;  
&#x27; {an-] of you private ones, if you had  
  
&#x27; \
  
  
  
  
si&#x27;chuzcten to give them) as cintaine-d any ,  
instructions or direction: either to Mr..i  
Monroe, or to Mr. Murris, or to any  
l Other person rel&#x27;ctvetting-me; for, after you  
I were informed of my imprisonmcnt in]  
l France, it was incumbent on you to have  
* made some enqsiriry into the cause.-, as you  
might well concluee, that I had not the  
l ott-purtunity of informing you usit. [can. lss  
not underitand your siiCDCC upon this sub. 3  
ss&#x27; ject upon any Other ground, than as ccnni. -  
&#x27;vance at my imprisonment; and this is  
the manner it is understood here, and will ss  
be understood in Americn, unless you can ;  
give me authority for contradic&#x27;ting it.  
I therefore write you this letter, to ero  
pose to you to send me Cupies of any letters  
you have written that may remove that  
suspicion. In the presac: to the second  
part of the Age of Reason, I have given  
it mztnorandum srem the hand writing of  
Rohespierre, in which he proposed a decree  
of accusation against me, &quot; or (be interest  
0 Arm-rits: as few/] as of France.&quot; He  
could have no cause for putting America  
into the case, but by interprcting the si  
lence of the Americun government into  
connivance and consent. I was imprisun­  
ed on the ground of being horn in Eng.  
land; and your filence in not enquiring  
into the cause of that imprisonmentand re­  
claiming me again-si it, was tacitly giving  
me up. I ought not to have suiþe-fied  
you of treachery ; but whether I recover  
from the illness I now suﬀer, or not, I shali  
c0ntinue to think you treacherous, till you  
give me cause to think orhervss&#x27;ise. I am  
sure you would have found yourleismore  
at your ease, had you actcssi as you ought &quot;;  
for whether your desertion ot me was in.  
tended to gratik&#x27;y the English government,  
or let me fall into destruction in France,  
that you might exelnim the louder against  
the French revolution, or whether you  
hoped by my excinction to meet wzth less  
tipp&#x27;ttitiun in mounting up the American  
government; either of these will involve  
you in reproach, you will not easily shake
