I.  
Air heated by any Means becomes rarefied &amp; specifically lighter than other Air in the same Situation not heated.  
Air being thus made lighter rises, and the neighbouring cooler, heavier Air takes its place.  
If in the middle of a Room you heat the Air by a Stove, or Pot of burning Coals near the Floor, the heated Air will rise to the Ceiling, spread there over the cooler Air till it comes to the cold Walls; there being condens’d &amp; made heavier, it descends to supply the Place of that cool Air which had moved towards the Stove or Fire in order to supply the Place of the heated Air which had ascended from the Space around the Stove or Fire.  
Thus there will be a continual Circulation of Air in the Room, which may be render’d visible by making a little Smoke; for that Smoke will rise &amp; circulate with the Air.  
A Similar Operation is perform’d by Nature on the Air of this Globe. Our Atmosphere is of a certain height, perhaps at a Medium  Miles. Above that height it is so rare as to be almost a Vacuum. The Air heated between the Tropics is continually rising, its Place is supply’d by northerly &amp; southerly Winds which come from the cooler Regions.  
  
  
The light heated Air floating above the cooler and denser must spread northward &amp; southward, and descend near the two Poles to supply the Place of the cooler Air which had moved towards the Equator.  
Thus a Circulation of Air is kept up in our Atmosphere as in the Room above mentioned.  
That heavier &amp; lighter Air may move in Currents of different &amp; even opposite Direction, appears sometimes by the Clouds that happen to be in those Currents, as plainly as by the Smoke in the Expr above mentioned. Also in opening a Door between two Chambers, one of which has been warmed, by holding a Candle near the top, near the Bottom, &amp; near the Middle, you will find a strong Current of warm Air passing out of the warmed Room above, and another of cool Air entering it below, while in the Middle there is little or no Motion.  
The great Quantity of Vapour rising between the Tropics forms Clouds which contain much Electricity.  
Some of them fall in Rain before they come to the polar Regions.  
If the Rain be received in an isolated Vessel, the Vessel will be electrified; for every Drop brings down some Electricity with it.  
The same is done by Snow, and Hail.  
The Electricity so descending in temperate Climates, is receiv’d &amp; imbib’d by the Earth.  
If the Clouds are not sufficiently discharg’d by this means, they sometimes discharge themselves by striking into the Earth, where the Earth is fit to receive their Electricity.  
The Earth in temperate &amp; warm Climates is generally fit to receive it, being a good Conductor.  
A certain Quantity of Heat will make some Bodies good Conductors, that will not otherwise conduct.  
Thus Wax render’d fluid, &amp; Glass softened by Heat, will both of them conduct.  
And Water tho’ naturally a good Conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into Ice by a common Degree of Cold, not at all where the Cold is extream.  
Snow falling upon frozen Ground, has been found to retain its Electricity, and to communicate it to an isolated Body when after falling it has been driven about by the Wind.  
The Humidity contain’d in all the equatorial Clouds that reach the Polar Regions, must there be condens’d &amp; fall in Snow.  
The great Cake of Ice that eternally covers those Regions may be too hard frozen to permit the Electricity descending with that Snow to enter the Earth.  
It will therefore be accumulated upon that Ice.  
The Atmosphere being heavier in the Polar Regions than in the equatorial, will there be lower; as well from that Cause as from the smaller Effect of the centrifugal Force; consequently the Distance to the Vacuum above the Atmosphere will be less at the Poles than else where; and much less than the Distance upon the Surface of the Globe extending from the Pole to the Latitudes in which the Earth is so thaw’d as to receive &amp; imbibe Electricity; the Frost continuing to Lat. 80, which is 10 Degrees or 600 Miles from the Pole, while the Height of the Atmosphere there can scarce be esteemed above  Miles.  
The Vacuum above is a good Conductor.  
May not then the great Quantity of Electricity brought into the Polar Regions by the Clouds which are condens’d there &amp; fall in Snow, which Electricity would enter the Earth but cannot penetrate the Ice; May it not, I say, as a bottle overcharg’d, break thro’ that low Atmosphere and run along in the Vacuum over the Air towards the Equator, diverging as the degrees of Longitude enlarge, strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges, till it finds a Passage to the Earth in more temperate Climates; or is mingled with their upper Air?  
If such an Operation of Nature were really performed, would it not give all the Appearances of an Aurora Borealis?  
And would not the Auroras become more frequent after the Approach of Winter: not only because more visible in longer Nights; but also because in Summer the long Presence of the Sun may soften the Surface of the great Ice Cake and render it a Conductor, by which the Accumulation of Electricity in the polar Regions will be prevented.  
  
27. The Atmosphere of the polar Regions being made more dense by the extreme Cold, &amp; all the Moisture contain’d in that Air being frozen, may not any great Light arising therein &amp; passing thro’ it, render its Density in some degree visible during the night-time to those who live in the rarer Air of more southern Latitudes; and would it not, in that Case, altho’ in itself a compleat and full Circle, extending perhaps 10 degrees from the Pole, appear to Spectators so placed, who could see only a Part of it, in the form of a Segment, its Chord resting on the Horizon, &amp; its Arch elevated more or less above it, as seen from Latitudes less or more distant, darkish in Colour, but yet sufficiently transparent to permit the Stars to be seen thro’ it?  
28. The Rays of electric Matter issuing out of a Body, diverge, unless there be some Conducting Body near to receive them. And if that Body be at a greater Distance, they will first diverge, &amp; then converge in order to enter it. May not this account for some of the Varieties of Figure seen at times in the Motions of the luminous Matter of the Auroras? Since it is possible that in passing over the Atmosphere from the North towards the Equator, the Rays of that Matter may find in many Places Portions of Cloudy Region or moist Atmosphere under them, fit to receive them, and towards which they may therefore converge; and when that receiving Body is more than saturated, they may again diverge from it towards other surrounding Masses of such humid Atmosphere; and thus form the Crowns as they are called, &amp; other Figures mentioned in the Histories of this Meteor?

ly a good conduétor, will net con-  
duét well, when frozen into ice by  
a common degree of cold; not at  
all, where the cold is extreme.  
  
18. Snow falling upon frozen  
ground has been found to retain its  
electricity ; and to communicate it  
to an ifolated body, when afier  
falling, it has been driven about by  
the wind.

as well from that caufe, as from  
the {maller effect of the centrifugal

#### 1839-10-12 &middot; [Boston](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston)

His reasoning is as follows: ‘ Air heated by any means  
becomes rarefied, and specifically lighter than other in the  
same situation, not heated ; and when lighter it rises, and  
the neighboring, cooler and heavier, takes its place. If in the  
middle of a room you heat the air by a stove or pot of burn-  
ing coals near the floor, the heated air will rise to the ceiling,  
spread over the cooler air, till it comes to the cold walls; there,  
being condensed and made heavier, it descends to supply the  
place of the heated air which had ascended towards the ceil-  
ing. Thus there will be a continual circulation of air in the  
room, which may be rendered visible by making a little  
smoke ; for that smoke will rise and circulate with the air.  
‘‘ A similar operation is performed by nature on the air of  
this globe. Above the height of our atmosphere the air is  
so rare as to be almost a vacuum. The air heated between  
the tropics is continually rising; its place is supplied by  
northerly and southerly winds, which come from the cooler  
regions. The light heated air, floating above the cooler and  
denser, must spread northward and southward, and descend  
near the two poles, to supply the place of the cool air which  
had moved towards the equator. Thus a circulation of air is  
kept up in our atmosphere, as in the room above mentioned ;  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
et in opening a door between the two chambers, one of  
which has been warmed, by holding a candle near the top,  
near the bottom, and near the middle, you will find a strong  
current of warm air passing out of the warmed room above,  
and another of cool air entering below, while in the middle  
there is little or no motion.  
  
“The great quantity of vapor, rising between the tropics,  
forms clouds which contain much electricity ; some of them  
fall in rain before they come to the polar regions. Every  
drop brings down some electricity with it; the same is done  
by snow or hail ; the electricity so descending, in temperate  
climates, is received and imbibed by the earth. If the clouds  
are not sufficiently discharged by this gradual operation,  
they sometimes discharge themselves suddenly by striking  
into the earth, where the earth is fit to receive their elec-  
tricity. The earth, in temperate and warm climates, is gen-  
erally fit to receive it, being a good conductor.  
  
“The humidity contained in all the equatorial clouds that  
reach the polar regions, must there be condensed and fall  
in snow. The great cake of ice that externally covers those  
regions, may be too hard frozen to permit the electricity,  
descending with that snow, to enter the earth. It may there-  
fore be accumulated upon that ice. The atmosphere, being  
heavier in the polar regions than in the equatorial, will there  
be lower, as well from that cause as from the smaller effect  
of the centrifugal force; consequently the distance of the  
vacuum above the atmosphere will be less at the poles than  
elsewhere ; and probably much less than the distance (upon  
the surface of the globe) extending from the pole to those lati-  
tudes in which the earth is so thawed as to receive and im-  
bibe electricity. May not, then, the great quantity of elec-  
tricity, brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which  
are condensed there, and fall in snow, which electricity  
would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice, may it  
not, as a bottle overcharged, break through that low atmos-  
phere, and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the  
equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge,  
strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as  
it more diverges, till it finds a passage to the earth in more  
temperate climates, or is mingled with the upper air? If  
such operation of nature were really performed, would it  
not give all the appearances of an aurora borealis? And would  
not these become more frequent after the approach of winter,  
not only because more visible in longer nights, but also be-  
cause in summer the long presence of the sun may soften  
the surface of the great ice cake, and render it a conductor,  
by which the accumulation of electricityin the polar regions,  
will be prevented ?  
  
“ The atmosphere of the polar regions being made more  
  
dense, by the extreme cold, and all the moisture in that air  
being frozen, may not any great light arising therein, and  
passing through it, render its density in some degree visible  
during the night time, to those who live in the rarer air of  
the more southern latitudes? and would it not, in that case,  
although in itself a complete and full circle, extending, per-  
haps, ten degrees from the pole, appear—to spectators so  
placed, who could see only a part of it, in the form of a  
segment, its chord resting on the horizon, and its arch  
elevated more or less above it, as seen from latitudes more  
or less distant —darkish in color, but yet sufficiently trans-  
parent to permit some stars to be seen through it.  
- “The rays of electric matter, issuing out of a body, diverge  
by mutually repelling each other; unless there be some con-  
ducting body near to receive them; and if that condacting  
body be at a greater distance, they will diverge and then  
converge, in order to enter it. May not this account for  
some of the varieties of figures seen at times in the motions  
of the luminous matter of the aurora; since it is possible  
that in passing over the atmosphere, from the north, in al

In 1779 (?) Franklin wrote this in a paper on the Aurora Borealis : “ May  
not, then, the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar region, by  
the clouds, which are condensed there, and fall in snow, — which electricity  
would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice, — may it not, I say, (as a  
bottle overcharged), break that low atmosphere, and run along in the vacuum  
over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge,  
strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges ;  
till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled  
with the upper air? If such an operation of nature were really performed,  
would it not give all the appearances of an aurora borealis.”§ Mr. Rowel

nebulous matter which the earth occasionally meets in  
its flight through space. It is certain, however, that it  
partakes not only of the motion of the earth about the  
sun, but also of the rotary motion about its axis.  
  
The conclusion of the whole matter is, that the auror
