o force: That to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party, its co-states forming as to itself, the other party: That the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not the constitution, the measure of its powers; but that as in all other cases of compact among parties having no common Judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.  
II. Resolved, that the Constitution of the United States having delegated to Congress a power to punish treason, counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States, piracies and felonies committed on the High Seas, and offences against the laws of nations, and no other crimes whatever, and it being true as a general principle, and one of the amendments to the Constitution having also declared, “that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people,” therefore also the same act of Congress passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and entitled “An act in addition to the act entitled an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States;” as also the act passed by them on the 27th day of June, 1798, entitled “An act to punish frauds committed on the Bank of the United States” (and all other their acts which assume to create, define, or punish crimes other than those enumerated in the constitution) are altogether void and of no force, and that the power to create, define, and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of right appertains solely and exclusively to the respective states, each within its own Territory.  
III. Resolved, that it is true as a general principle, and is also expressly declared by one of the amendments to the Constitution that “the  powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively or to the people;” and that no power over the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or freedom of the press being delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, all lawful powers respecting the same did of right remain, and were reserved to the states, or to the people: That thus was manifested their determination to retain to themselves the right of judging how far the licentiousness of speech and of the press may be abridged without lessening their useful freedom, and how far those abuses which cannot be separated from their use, should be tolerated rather than the use be destroyed; and thus also they guarded against all abridgement by the United States of the freedom of religious opinions and exercises, and retained to themselves the right of protecting the same, as this state by a Law passed on the general demand of its Citizens, had already protected them from all human restraint or interference: And that in addition to this general principle and express declaration, another and more special provision has been made by one of the amendments to the Constitution which expressly declares, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an Establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,” thereby guarding in the same sentence, and under the same words, the freedom of religion, of speech, and of the press, insomuch, that whatever violates either, throws down the sanctuary which covers the others, and that libels, falsehoods, and defamation, equally with heresy and false religion, are withheld from the cognizance of federal tribunals. That therefore the act of the Congress of the United States passed on the 14th day of July 1798, entitled “An act in addition to the act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,” which does abridge the freedom of the press, is not law, but is altogether void and of no effect.  
IV. Resolved, that alien friends are under the jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the state wherein they are; that no power over them has been delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to the individual states distinct from their power over citizens; and it being true as a general principle, and one of the amendments to the Constitution having also declared, that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people,” the act of the Congress of the United States passed on the 22d day of June, 1798, entitled “An act concerning aliens,” which assumes power over alien friends not delegated by the Constitution, is not law, but is altogether void and of no force.  
  
V. Resolved, that in addition to the general principle as well as the express declaration, that powers not delegated are reserved, another and more special provision inserted in the Constitution from abundant caution has declared, “that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808.” That this Commonwealth does admit the migration of alien friends described as the subject of the said act concerning aliens; that a provision against prohibiting their migration, is a provision against all acts equivalent thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove them when migrated is equivalent to a prohibition of their migration, and is therefore contrary to the said provision of the Constitution, and void.  
VI. Resolved, that the imprisonment of a person under the protection of the Laws of this Commonwealth on his failure to obey the simple order of the President to depart out of the United States, as is undertaken by the said act entitled “An act concerning Aliens,” is contrary to the Constitution, one amendment to which has provided, that “no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law,” and that another having provided “that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a public trial by an impartial jury, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favour, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence,” the same act undertaking to authorize the President to remove a person out of the United States who is under the protection of the Law, on his own suspicion, without accusation, without jury, without public trial, without confrontation of the witnesses against him, without having witnesses in his favour, without defence, without counsel, is contrary to these provisions also of the Constitution, is therefore not law but utterly void and of no force.  
That transferring the power of judging any person who is under the protection of the laws, from the Courts to the President of the United States, as is undertaken by the same act concerning Aliens, is against the article of the Constitution which provides, that “the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in Courts, the Judges of which shall hold their offices during good behaviour,” and that the said act is void for that reason also; and it is further to be noted, that this transfer of Judiciary power is to that magistrate of the General Government who already possesses all the Executive, and a qualified negative in all the Legislative powers.  
VII. Resolved, that the construction applied by the General Government (as is evinced by sundry of their proceedings) to those parts of the  Constitution of the United States which delegate to Congress a power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States, and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or any department thereof, goes to the destruction of all the limits prescribed to their power by the Constitution—That words meant by that instrument to be subsiduary only to the execution of the limited powers, ought not to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited powers, nor a part so to be taken, as to destroy the whole residue of the instrument: That the proceedings of the General Government under colour of these articles, will be a fit and necessary subject for revisal and correction at a time of greater tranquility, while those specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate redress.  
VIII. Resolved, that the preceding Resolutions be transmitted to the Senators and Representatives in Congress from this Commonwealth, who are hereby enjoined to present the same to their respective Houses, and to use their best endeavours to procure at the next session of Congress, a repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
IX. Resolved lastly, that the Governor of this Commonwealth be, and is hereby authorised and requested to communicate the preceding Resolutions to the Legislatures of the several States, to assure them that this Commonwealth considers Union for specified National purposes, and particularly for those specified in their late Federal Compact, to be friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosperity of all the states: that faithful to that compact, according to the plain intent and meaning in which it was understood and acceded to by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its preservation: that it does also believe, that to take from the states all the powers of self government, and transfer them to a general and consolidated Government, without regard to the special delegations and reservations solemnly agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace, happiness, or prosperity of these states: And that therefore, this Commonwealth is determined, as it doubts not its Costates are, tamely to submit to undelegated &amp; consequently unlimited powers in no man or body of men on earth: that if the acts before specified should stand, these conclusions would flow from them; that the General Government may place any act they think proper on the list of crimes &amp; punish it themselves, whether enumerated or not enumerated by the Constitution as cognizable by them: that they may transfer its cognizance to the President or any other person, who may himself be the accuser, counsel, judge, and jury, whose suspicions may be the evidence,  his order the sentence, his officer the executioner, and his breast the sole record of the transaction: that a very numerous and valuable description of the inhabitants of these states, being by this precedent reduced as outlaws to the absolute dominion of one man and the barrier of the Constitution thus swept away from us all, no rampart now remains against the passions and the power of a majority of Congress, to protect from a like exportation or other more grievous punishment the minority of the same body, the Legislatures, Judges, Governors, &amp; Counsellors of the states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights &amp; liberties of the states &amp; people, or who for other causes, good or bad, may be obnoxious to the views or marked by the suspicions of the President, or be thought dangerous to his or their elections or other interests public or personal: that the friendless alien has indeed been selected as the safest subject of a first experiment: but the citizen will soon follow, or rather has already followed; for, already has a Sedition Act marked him as its prey: that these and successive acts of the same character, unless arrested at the threshold, may tend to drive these states into revolution and blood, and will furnish new calumnies against Republican Governments, and new pretexts for those who wish it to be believed, that man cannot be governed but by a rod of iron: that it would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights: that confidence is every where the parent of despotism: free government is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited Constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power: that our Constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which and no further our confidence may go; and let the honest advocate of confidence read the Alien and Sedition Acts, and say if the Constitution has not been wise in fixing limits to the Government it created, and whether we should be wise in destroying those limits? Let him say what the Government is if it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice have conferred on the President, and the President of our choice has assented to and accepted over the friendly strangers, to whom the mild spirit of our Country and its laws had pledged hospitality and protection: that the men of our choice have more respected the bare suspicions of the President than the solid rights of innocence, the claims of justification, the sacred force of truth, and the forms &amp; substance of law and justice. In questions of power then let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution. That this Commonwealth does therefore call on its Co-states for an expression of their sentiments on the acts  concerning Aliens, and for the punishment of certain crimes herein before specified, plainly declaring whether these acts are or are not authorised by the Federal Compact? And it doubts not that their sense will be so announced as to prove their attachment unaltered to limited Government, whether general or particular, and that the rights and liberties of their Co-states will be exposed to no dangers by remaining embarked on a common bottom with their own: That they will concur with this Commonwealth in considering the said acts as so palpably against the Constitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration, that the Compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the General Government, but that it will proceed in the exercise over these states of all powers whatsoever: That they will view this as seizing the rights of the states and consolidating them in the hands of the General Government with a power assumed to bind the states (not merely in cases made federal) but in all cases whatsoever, by laws made, not with their consent, but by others against their consent: That this would be to surrender the form of Government we have chosen, and to live under one deriving its powers from its own will, and not from our authority; and that the Co-states recurring to their natural right in cases not made federal, will concur in declaring these acts void and of no force, and will each unite with this Commonwealth in requesting their repeal at the next session of Congress

8. Refolded, that t!ie preceding

their belt endeavours to procure at  
the next felhon of congrefs, a repeal  
of the aforefaid unconltitutional and  
obnoxious acts.  
  
9. Kefolved laftly, that the gover-  
nor of this commonwealth be, and is  
hereby aathorifed and requelted to  
communicate the preceding refutati-  
ons to the legiflat tires, of the leveial  
States, to allure them that this com-  
monwealth eonfiders union tor fpe-  
cified national pu poles, and particu-  
larly for thole fpectfied in their late  
federal comaai&#x27;t, to be friendly to the  
peace, happinefs and profperity of all  
the Itates : that faithful to that com-  
pact, according to the pi tin intent and  
meaning in v\ huh it was uiulerltood  
&amp; acceded to by the levei al parties, it  
is (tncerely anxious for its prefervati-  
on : tbat it does alfo believe, that to  
take from the (tares all the powers of  
■felt government, and transfer them  
to a general and confolidated govern  
jnent, without regard to the fpecial  
delegations and relervations folemn-  
ly agreed to in that compact, is not  
for the peace, happinefs, or profperuy  
of thefe Itates : &amp; that therefore, this  
commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-ltates are to fubcnit to  
undelegated and confequently unlimi-  
ted powers in no man or body of men  
on earth: that if the ads before fpe-  
ciried mould Hand, thefe conclufiohs  
would flow from them ; that the ge-  
neral government may place any act  
they think proper on the HIV of crimes  
and puni&#x27;.h it themfelves, whether e-  
iiumerated or not enumerated by the  
conltitution as cognizable by them :  
that they may transfer its cognizance  
to the prefident or any other perfon,  
who may himlelf be the acrofer, conn-  
fel. judge, and jury, whole fufpit&#x27;ftns  
may be the evidence, his order the  
fentence, his officer the executioner,  
&amp; hisbrealt the fole record of the tranf-  
aCtinn ; that a very numerous and va  
luable defcriprion of the inhabitants  
of thefe Itates, being by this precedent  
re tuced as outlaws to the abfolute do-  
minion of one man, and the barrier of  
the conltitution thus {Wept away for  
us all, no rampart now remain Bgfttnfl

or bad, may be obnoxious to the views

not that their fenfe will be fo a .noun-

to be the meafore of the powers of the

proceed in the exercife over thelc

they will view this as feiziog the

this government created by this

Il. Resonven, that the con-

to punijh treafon, counterfening  
the fecurities and current coin of  
the United States, piracies and fe-

a to punith frauds committed on

(and all wanes their aéts which af-  
fame to create, define, or puntfh  
crimes other os thofe enume-at-

the power to create, define, and  
sil fuch other crimes is re-  
ferved, and of right appertains  
folely and exclufively to the re-  
{peétive flates, each within its own  
territory.  
  
Iif. Resotven, that it ts true  
as a general principle, and is alfo  
exprefsly declared by one of the  
amendments to the conftitution,  
that ** the powers not delegated  
to the United States by the con-  
ftitution, nor prohibited by it to  
the ftates, are referved to the  
ftates refpectively, or to the peo-  
ple ;’* and that no power over the  
freedom of religion, freedom of  
{peech, or freedom of the prefs,  
being delegated to the United  
States by the conflitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the flates, all  
lawful powers refpecting the fame  
did of right remain, aod were re-  
ferved to the ftates, or to the peo-  
ple; that thus was manifelted  
their determination to retain to  
themfelves the right of judging  
how far the Sens ntroufnefs of  
fpeech and of the preis may be  
abridged without leffening their  
ufeful freedom, and how far thofe  
abufes which cannot be feparated  
from their uf » fhould be tolerated  
  
rather than the ule deftroved :  
and thus alfo they ugTred ay nft  
all abridgment = y’ the Uaeel  
States, of the freecom of religious  
principles and . fes. and re  
  
tained to theméelvey the right of

proteGting the fame, as this, flz-  
ted by a law pafled on the general  
demand of its citizens, had alrea-  
dy proteéted them from all human  
reftraint or interference: And that  
in addition to this general princi-  
ple and exprefs declaration, ano-  
ther and more fpecial provifion  
has been made by onc of the a-  
mendments to the conftitution,  
which exprefsly declares, that  
‘“* congrefs fhall make no laws rt  
{fpecting an eftablifhment of reli-  
gion, or prohibiting the free ex-  
ercife thereof, or abridging the  
freedom of fpeech, or of the  
prefs,” thereby guarding in the  
fame fentence, and under the fame  
words, the freedom of religion,  
of fpeech, and of the prefs, info-  
much, that whatever violates ei-  
ther, throws down the fanétuary  
which covers the others, and that  
libels. falfhood, and defamation,  
equally with herefy and falfe reli-  
gion, are withheld from the cog-  
nizance of federal tribunals. ‘That  
therefore the act of the congrefs  
of the United States pafled on  
the 14th of July, 1798, entitled,  
« An a&amp; in addition to the a&amp;  
entitled anu act for the punthhment  
of certain crimes wae the Unit-

the freedom of the prefs, is not  
law, bur is altogether void and of  
no force.  
  
IV. Resorven, that alien  
friends are under the jorifdidion  
and protection of the laws of the  
ftate wherein they are; that no  
power over them has been delegat-  
ed to the United S:ates, nor pro-

States by the conftitution nor pro-  
hibited by it to the flates, are re-  
ferved to the ftates refpectively or  
tothe people, ‘* the act of the con-  
egrets of the United States, paffed  
the 22d day of June, 1798, entitled  
  
“*An aé concerning aliens,”  
which aflumes power over alien  
friends not delegated by the contti-  
  
tution, is not law, but is al togeth-  
er void and of no force.  
  
V. Resotven, that in addi-  
tion to the general principle as  
well as the exprefs deciaration,  
that powers not delegated are re-  
ferved, another and more fpecial  
previlion inferred in the conftitu-  
tion, from abundant caution has  
declared, ‘* that the migration or  
importation of fuch perfonsas any  
of the ftates mow exifting fhall  
think proper to admit, fhall not  
be prohibited by the congrets pri-  
or to the year 1808.°” ‘ihat this  
commonwealth does admit the mi-  
gration of alien friends defcribed  
asthe fubject of the faid act con-  
cerning aliens; that a provifion  
ag: Lint prohibiting their migra-  
tion, is a provifion againft all acts  
equivalent thereto, or it would be  
nugatory ; that to remove them  
when migrated is equivalent toa  
prohibition of their migration,  
and is therefore contrary to the  
faid provifion of the contticution,  
and void.  
  
VI. Resorven, that the im-  
prifonment of a perfon under the  
protection ef the laws of this  
commonwealth on his failure to  
obey the fimple order of the pref.  
dent, to depart out of the United  
States, as is undertaken by the  
faid aét, entitled ** An a&amp; con-  
cerning aliens,” is contrary to the  
conftitution, one amendment in  
which has provided, that ‘* no  
perfon fhall be deprived of liberty  
without due procefs of law,’® and  
  
that another having provided,  
** that in all criminal profecutions,  
the accufed fhall enjoy the right  
toa public trial by an impartial ju-  
ry, to be informed asto the nature  
and caufe of the accufation, to be  
confronted with the witnefles a-  
gainft him, to have compulfory  
procefs for obtaining witnefles in  
his favour, and to have afliftance  
of counfel for his ,defence, ** the  
fame act undertaking to authorife  
the prelident to remove a perfon  
our of the United States who is  
under the protection of the law,  
on his own {fufpicion, without  
jary, without public trial, with-  
out confrontation of the witnefles  
againft him, without having wit-  
nefles in his favour, without de-  
fence, without counfel, is contra.  
ry to thefe provifions alfo of the  
conftitution, is therefore not law  
but utterly void and of no force.  
  
Tuat transferring the power  
of judging any perfon who is une  
der the protection of the laws,  
from the courts to the prefident of  
the United States as is undertaken  
by the fame act concerning aliens,  
is ayainft the article of the confti-  
tuticn which provides, that, ** the  
judicial power of the United  
States (hall be vefted in courts,  
he _ judges of which fhall hold  
heir office during good behavi-  
a and that the faid ad is void  
for that reafon alfo; and it is fur-  
ther to be noted that this transfer  
of judiciary power is to that ma-  
giftrate of the general government  
who already poffeffes all the exe-  
cutive, and a gurhfied negative in  
all the legiflat&#x27;ve powers,  
  
VII. Resorven. that the con-  
firv€ion applied by the general  
government (as is evident by fun-  
dry of their proceedings) to thofe  
parts of the conftitution of the  
United States, which delegate to

congrefs power to lay and colle&amp;  
taxes, duties, impofts, excifes ;  
to pay the debts, and provide for  
the common defence, and general  
welfare of the United States, and  
to make all laws which fhali be  
neceflary and proper for carrying  
into execution the powers velted  
by the conftitution in the govern.  
ment of the United States, or  
any department thereof, goes to  
the deftruction of all the limits  
prefcribed to their power by the  
conftitution—That words meant  
by that inftrument to be fubfiduary  
only to the execution of the lim-  
ited powers, ought not to be fo  
confirued as tlemfelves to give  
unlimited powers, lor a part fo to  
be taken, as to deftroy the whole  
refidue of the inftrument: That  
the proceedings of the general  
government under colour of thofe  
articles, will be a fit and neceflary  
fubje&amp;t for revifal and correction  
at a time of greater tranquility,  
while thofe fpecified in the pre-  
ceding refolutions call for immedi-  
atc redrefs,  
  
Vill. Regsorvep, that the  
preceding refolutions be tran{mit-  
ted to the fenators and reprefenta-  
tives in congrefs from this com-  
monwealth, who are enjoined to  
pre‘ent the fame to their refpective  
houfes, and to ufe their beft en-  
deavours to procure at the next  
feffion of congrefs, a repeal of  
the aforefaid unconititutional and  
obnoxious acts.  
  
IX. Resotvep laftly, that  
the governor of this common-  
wealth be, and is hereby authori-  
zed and requefted to communicate  
the preceding refolutious to the  
legiflatures ef the feveral ftates,  
to aflure them that this common-  
wealth confiders union for {pecial  
National purpofes, and particularly  
for thofe fpecified in their late  
  
federal compact, to be fricndly to  
the peace, happinefs, and prof:  
perity of allthe flatesmthat faiih-  
ful to that compact according to  
the plain intent and meaning in  
which it was underftood and acccd-  
ed to by the feveral parties, it is  
fincerely anxious fot its preferva-  
tion; that it dees alfo believe, that  
to take from the ftates all the pow-  
ers of felf government, and tran{-  
fer them toa general and confolida-  
ted povernment, without regard to  
the {pecial delegations and refer-  
vations folemnly agreed to in that  
compact, isnot for the peace, hap-  
pinefs, or profperity of  thele  
ftates: And that therefore this  
commonwealth is determined, as  
it doubts not its co-flates are, to  
{ubmit to undelegated and cor fe-  
quently unlimited powers in no  
man, er body of men on earth ;  
that if the a&amp;s before fpecified  
fhould ftand, thefe conclufions  
would fiow from them; that the  
general government may place  
any act they think proper on the  
lift of crimes and punifh it them-  
felves, whether enumerated or not  
enumerated, by the cenflitution as  
cognizable by them; that they  
may transfer its cognizance in the  
  
refident or any other perfon, who  
may himfelf be the accufer, coun-  
fel, judge, and jury, whofe {ufpi-  
cions may be the evidence, his or-  
der the fentence, his officer the  
executioner, and his brcaft the fole  
record of the tranfaction ; that a  
very numerous and valuable def-  
cription of the inhabitants of thefe  
ftates, being by this precedent re-  
duced as outlaws to the abfclute  
dominion of one man, aid the bar-  
riers of the confiitution thus {wept

ment ; bue the citizen will foon  
follow, or rather has already fol-  
lowed ; for, already has a fedition

thefe and fucceflive acts of the

thefe ftates into revolution and

who wifh it to be oelieved, that  
man cannot be governed but by a  
rod of iron; that it would be a  
dangerous delafion were a confi-  
dence in the men of our choice to  
filence our fears for the fafety of  
our rights; that confidence is e-  
very where the parent of defpo-  
tifin; free goverument is founded  
in jealoufy and not in confidence ;  
it is jealoufy and not confidence  
which preferibes limited conftitu-  
tions to bind down thofe whom  
we are obliged to truft with power ;  
that oar conftitution has accord-  
ingly fixed the limits to which  
and no farther our confidence may  
go; and let the honeft advocate  
of confidence read the alien and  
fedition acts, and fay if the con-  
ftitution has not been wife in fix.  
ing limits to the government it  
  
created, and whether we fhould be  
wile in deftroying thofe limits ?  
let him fay what the government  
is, if it be nota tyranny, which  
the men of our choice have con-  
ferred on the prefident, and the  
prefident of our choice has affent-  
ed to and accepted over the friend-  
ly ftrangers, to whom the mild  
{pirit of our country and its laws  
had pledged hofpitality and pro-  
tection ; that the men of our choice  
have more refpected the bare fuf-  
picions of the prefident than the  
folid rights of innocence, the  
claims of jaftification, the facred  
force of truth, and the forms and  
fubftance of law and juftice. In  
gueftions of power then let no  
more be faid of confidence in man,  
but bind him down from mifchief  
by the chains of the conftitution:  
That this commonwealth does  
therefore call on its co-ftates for  
an expreflion of their fentiments  
on the aéts concerning aliens, and  
for the punifhment of certain  
crimes herein before | fpecified,  
plainly declaring whether thefe  
acts are or are not authorifed by  
the federal compact? And it  
doubts not that their fenfe will be  
fo announced as to prove their ate

whether general or particular, and  
that the rights and liberties of  
their co-flates will be expofed to

necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested  
  
| by the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or any  
  
department thereof, goes to the destruction of all the limits pre-  
«bed to their power by the Constitution—That words meant by  
that instrument to be subsidiary only to the execution oi the limited  
owers, ought not to be so construcd us themselves Lo give unlimited  
powers, nor apart so to be taken, as to destroy the whole residue of  
‘he instrument; that the proceedings of the General Government  
under colour of these articles, will be a fit and necessary subject for  
‘evisal and correction at atime of greater tranquillity, while those  
specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate redress.  
  
8 Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be transmitte d to the  
  
| Senators and Representatives in Congress from this Commonwealth,  
  
vho are hereby enjoined to present the same to their respective  
Houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure at the next ses-  
Jon of Congress, a repeal of the aforesaid unconsututional and ob-  
noxious acts.  
  
9. Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this Commonwealth be,  
and he is hereby authorised and requested to communicate the pre-  
«ding resolutions to the Legislatures of the several States, to as-  
wre them that this Commonwealth considers Union for specified  
\stional purposes, and particularly for those specified in their late  
Federal Compact, to be fricndly to the peace, happiness, aid pros-  
verity of all the States: that, faithful to that compact, according to  
‘he plain intent and meaning in which it was understood and acceded  
‘oby the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its preservation;  
that it does also believe that to take from the States all the powers of  
ifgovernment, and transfer them to a general and consolidated  
Government, without regard to the special delegations and reserva-  
Hons solemnly agreed to in that compact, 1s not for the peace, hap-  
  
ness, or prosperity of these States: and that therefore, this Com-  
  
onwealth is determined, as it doubts not its Co-States are tamely to  
bmit to undelegated and consequently unlimited poor in no  
van or body of men on earth: that if the acts before specified  
ould stand, these conclusions would flow from them; that the  
General Government may place any act they think proper on the  
istof crimes, and punish it themselves, whether enumerated or not  
oumerated by the Constitution, as recognizable by them; that they  
av transfer its cognizance to the President or any other person,  
ho mav himself be the accuser, counsel, judge, and jury, whose  
upicions may be the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
  
‘he executioner, and his breast the sole record of the transaction:  
  
rhat a very numerous and valuable description of the inhabitants  
  
of these States, being by this precedent reduced as outlaws to the  
bsolute dominion of one man, and the barrier of the Constitution  
  
‘ius swept away from us all, no rampart now remains against the  
  
passions and the power of a majority of Congress, to protect from  
  
a like exportation or other more grievous ,punishment the minority  
  
of the same body, the Legislatures, Judges, Governors, and Coun-  
  
scllors of the States, nor their other peaceful inhabitants who may  
venture to reclaim the Constitutional rights and liberties of the  
stutes and people, or who for other causes, good or bad, may be  
ynoxious to the views, or marked by the suspicions of the Presi-  
nt, or be thought dangerous to his or their elections, or other  
‘aests public or personal: That the friendless alien has indeed  
ecn selected as the safest subject of a first experiment; but the  
riiizen will soon follow, or rather has alrcady followed; for, already  
usa Sedition Act marked him as its prey: that these and succes-  
  
‘¢ acts of the same character, unless arrested on the threshol.  
hav tend to drive these States into revolution and blood, and  
I! furnish new calumnies against Republican Governments, and  
  
eW pretexts for those who wish it to be believed, that man cannot  
  
* governed but by a rod of iron; that it would be a dangerous de-  
son, were a confidence in the men of our choice, to silence our  
  
ws for the safety of our rights: that confidence is every  
vere the parent of despotism: free Government is founded  
jealousy and not in confidence: it is jealousy and not  
mfidence which prescribes limited Constitutions to bind  
own those whom we are a, oe to trust with power; that  
  
© Constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which and ro  
her our confidence may go; and let the honest advocate of con-  
lence read the Alien and Sedition Acts, and say if the Constitution  
  
s not been wise in fixing limits to the Government it created, and  
uether we should be wise in destroying those limits’ Let him  
) What the Government is, if it be not a tyranny, which the men of  
tchoice have conferred on the President, and the President of  
  
v choice has assented to and accepted over the friendly strangers,  
whom the mild spirit of our country and its laws had pledged  
xpitality and protection: that the men of our choice have more  
‘pected the bare suspicions of the President, than the solid rights  
‘anocence, the claims of justification, the sacred force of truth,  
1 the forms and substance of law and justice. In questions of  
wer, then let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind  
m down from mischief, by the chains of the Constitution. That  
‘’ Commonwealth does therefore, call on its Co-States for an  
pression of their sentiments on the acts concerning Aliens, and  
‘the punishment of certain crimes herein before specified,  
uly declaring whether these acts are or are not authorized  
tie Federal Compact? And it doubts not that their sense  
‘be so announced, as to prove their attachment unaltered  
imited Government, whether general or particular, and that the  
Fs and liberties of their Co-States, will be exposed to no dan-  
*°y remaining embarked on a common bottom with their own:  
“they will concur with this Commonwealth in considering the  
  
«ts as so palpably against the Constitution, as to amount to an  
=. declaration, that the compact is not meant to be the  
“Sue of the powers of the General Government, but that it will  
“el in the exercise over these States of all powers whatsoever:

assumed to bind the States, (not merely in cases made Fe

by others against their consent : That this would be to surrender  
  
the form of Government we have chosen, and to live under one de-  
riving its powers from its own will, and not from our authority : and  
that the Co-States recurring to their nutural right in cases not made  
Federal, will concur in decluring these acts void anid of no force, and  
  
will each umte with this Commonwealth in requesting tueir repeal  
at the next session of Congress

remaining embarked on a common bot‘om with their own: That they

of the General Government, but that it will proceed in the exercise,  
over these States, of all powers whatsoever: That they will view this

of the Gencral Government, with a power assumed to bind the States,  
not merely in cases made Federal, but in all cases whatsoever, by laws  
made, not with their consent, but by others, against their consent: That  
this would be to surrender the form of government we have chosen,

ers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of;  
no force; that to this compact each State ac ,  
ceded as a State, and is an integral party; that  
this G wernment, created by this compact, was  
not made the exclusive or final judge of the  
extent of the powers delegated to itself; since  
• bat would have made its discretion, and not  
the Constitution the measure of its powers;  
but, that as in all other cases of compact among  
parties having no common judge, each party  
has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of  
infractions, as of the mode and measure of re­  
dress.  
  
II. Resolved, That the Constitution of the  
United States having delegated to Congress a j  
power to punish treason, counterfeiting the se­  
curities and current coin of the United States,  
piracies and felonies committed on the high  
seas, and offences against the laws of nations,  
and no other crimes whatever, and it being  
true, as a general principle, and one of the  
amendments to the Constitution having also  
declared “that the powers not delegated* to the  
United States by the Constitution, nor prohi­  
| bited by it to the States, are reserved to the  
States respectively, or the people;” therefore,  
also, the same act of Congress, passed on the  
15th day of July, 1798, and entitled “An act  
in addition to the act entitled an act for the  
punishment of certain crimes against the Uni­  
ted States,” as also, the act passed by them on  
the 27th day of June, 1798, entitled “An act  
to punish frauds committed on the Hank of the  
United States,” (and all other their acts which i  
assume to create, define,or punish crimes other!  
than those enumerated in the Constitution) are  
altogether void and of no force, and that the  
power to create, define, and punish such other  
crimes is reserved, and of right appertains  
Isoiely and exclusively to the respective States,  
each within its own territory.  
Ilf. Resolved. That it is true as a general  
principle, and is also expressly declared by one  
&gt;f the amendments to the Constitution, that  
“the powers not delegated to the United States  
by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, are reserved to the States respective!;,  
or the people; and, that no power over the  
freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or free­  
dom of the press being delegated to the United  
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it  
to the States, as lawful powers respecting the  
same did of right remain, and were reserved to  
the States or to the people; thut thus was ma­  
nifested their determination to retain to them­  
selves the right of judging how far the licenti­  
ousness of speech and of the press may be  
abridged without lessening their useful free  
  
ilom, and how far those abuses which cannot  
be separated from their use, shou’d be tolerated  
rather than the use be destroyed; and thus also  
they guarded against all abridgement by the  
United States, of the freedom of religious prin­  
ciples and exercises, and retained to themselves  
die right of protecting the same, as this, stated  
by a law passed on the general demand of its  
citizens, had already protected them from ail  
human restraint or interference: and, that, in  
addition to this general principle and express  
declaration, another and more special provision  
has been made by one of the amendments t&lt;»  
the Constitution, which expressly declares that  
•‘Congress shall pass no laws respecting an  
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the  
free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom  
of speech or of the press,” thereby guarding  
m the same sentence, and under the same  
words, the freedom of religion, of speech, and  
of the press, insomuch, that whatever violates  
either, throws down the sanctuary which covers  
rhe others, and that libels, falsehood, and de­  
famation, equally with heresy and falso reli­  
gion, are withheld from the c tg nzancc of JPe­  
  
dural tribunals. That there!!.. 1 the act of the!  
Congress of the Unitpd States, parsed on the  
11th of July, 1798, entitled “An act in addi&gt;  
don to the act entitled au act for the punish­  
ment of certain crimes against »he United  
States,” which does abridge the freedom of the  
press, is not law, but is altogether void and  
OF NO FORCE.  
IV. Resolved, That alien friends are under  
the jurisdiction and protects &gt;n of the laws of  
the State wherein they are: that no power over  
them has has been delegated to the United  
States, nor prohibited to the individual States,  
distinct from their power over citizens; and it  
being true, as a general principle, and one of  
the amendments o the Constitution having also  
declared, that “the powers not delegated to the  
United States by the Constitn&#x27;i m, nor prohi­  
bited to the States, are resor*. to the States  
respectively, or to the people,” llie act of Con­  
gress of the United States i • ;». ed the 22d day  
of June, 1798, entitled, • act concerning  
aliens,” which assumes power over alien friends  
not delegated by the Constitution, is not law,  
but is altogether void and of no force.  
V. Resolved, That in addition to the gen­  
eral principle as well as the express declara­  
tion, that powers not delegated are reserved,  
another and m ;re special provision inferred in  
the Constitution, from abundant caution has  
declared, “that the migration or importation of  
such persons as any of th* States now existing  
shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohi­  
bited by the Congress prior to the year ”1808.  
That this Commonwealth does admit the migra­  
tion of alien friends described as the subject of  
the said act concerning aliens; that a provision  
against prohibiting heir migration, is a provi­  
sion against all acts equivalent thereto, or ii  
would he nugatory; that to remove them when  
migrated is equivalent to a prohibition of their  
migration, and is, therefore, contrary to the  
proeision of the Constitution, and void.  
VI. Resolved, That the imprisonment of a  
person under the protection of the laws of this  
Commonwealth on his failure o obey the sim­  
ple order of the President, t • depart out of tins  
United Slates, as is undertaken by the. said .»ct,  
entitled, “An act concerning aliens,” is con­  
trary to the Constitution, one amendment in  
which has provided, that “no person shall be  
deprived of liberty without due process of law,”  
and, that another having provided, “that in all  
criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy  
the right to a public trial by an impartial jury,  
to be informed as to the nature and cause of the  
accusation, lobe confronted with the witnesses  
against him to have compulsory process for ob­  
taining witnesses in his favor, and to have as*  
sistanui of counsel for his defence,” the same  
act undertaking to authorize the President to  
remove a person out of the United States who  
  
is under the protection of the law, on ins own  
suspicions, without jury, without public trial,  
without confrontation of the witnesses against  
him, without having witnesses in his favor,  
without defence, without counsel, is contrary toj  
these provisions also of the Constitution, is!  
therefore not law, l-ut utterly void and of no  
force.  
That transferring the power of judging any  
person who is under the protection of the laws,  
from the courts to the President of the United  
States as is undertaken by the same act con­  
cerning aliens, is against the article of the Con­  
stitution which provides, that, “the judicial  
power of the United States shall be vested in  
the courts, the judges of which shall hold their  
office during good behavior,and that the said1  
act is void for that reason also; and it is further  
to be noted that this transfer of judiciary pow­  
er is to that magistrate of the general govern­  
ment who already possesses all the executive,  
and a qualified negative in all the legislative  
powers.  
VII. Resolved, That the construction ap­  
plied by the general government (as is evident  
by sundry of their proceedings) to those parts  
of the Constitution of the United States, which  
delegate to Congress, power to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imposts, excises; to pay the  
debts, and provide for the common defence and  
general welfare of the United States, and to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and  
proper for carrying into execution the powers  
vested by the Constitution in the government  
&gt;f the United States, or any department there­  
&gt;t, goes to the destruction of all the limits pre­  
scribed to them by the Constitution.—That  
words meant by that instrument to be subsi­  
liary only to the execution of the limited  
powers, not to be so construed as themselves to  
Igive unlimited powers, nor a part so to he taken.  
  
as to destroy the whole residue of the instru­  
ment: That the proceedings of the general  
government under the color of those articles,  
will be a fit and necessary subject for revisal  
and correction at a time of great tranquility,  
while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
VIII. Resolved, That the preceding reso­  
lutions be transmitted to the Senators and Re­  
presentatives in Congress from this common­  
wealth, who are enjoined to present the same  
to their respective houses, and to use their best  
endeavors to procure at the next session of Con­  
gress, a repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional  
and obnoxious acts.  
  
IX. Resolved lastly, That the governor of  
‘his commonwealth be, a*.d is hereby aulho*  
nzed and requested to communicate the pre­  
ceding resolutions to the legislatures of the  
several states, to assure them that this common­  
wealth considers union fur special national pur­  
poses, and particularly for those specified in  
their h.te federal compact, to be friendly to the  
peace, happiness, and prosperity of all the  
states—that faithful to that compact, according  
to the plain intent and meaning in which it was  
understood and acceded to by the several par­  
ties, it is sincerely anxious for its preservation,  
that it does also believe, that to take from the  
states all the nowers of self-government, and  
transfer them to a general and consolidated  
government, without regard to the special dele­  
  
gallons arm reservations solemnly agreed torn  
that compact, is not for the peace, happiness,  
or prosperity of these states: And that there­  
fore, this commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-states are, to submit to unde­  
le gated aqd consequently unlimited powers in  
no man. or body of men on earth: that if the  
aets before specified should stand, these con­  
elusions would flow from them; that the gen­  
eral government may place any act they think  
proper on the list of crimes and punish it them­  
selves whether enumerated or not enumerated,  
by the Constitution as cognizable by them;  
that they may transfer its cognizance to the  
President or any other person, who may him -  
self be the accuser, counsel, judge, and jury,  
whose suspicions may be the evidence, his or­  
der the sentence, his officer the executioner,  
and his breast the sole record of the transac­  
tion; that i very numerous and valuable de­  
scription of the inhabitants of these states, be­  
ing by this precedent reduced as out laws to  
the absolute dominion of one man and the bar­  
riers of the Constitution thus swept from us all;  
no rampart now remains against the passions  
and the power of a majority of Congress, to  
protect from a like exportation or grievous pun­  
ishment the minority of the sumo body, the  
legislatures, judges, governors, and counsellors  
of the states, nor their other peaceable inhabi­  
tants who may venture to reclaim the consti  
tmiimal libgis and lilicitles of ihc states, and  
people, or who, for other causes, good or had,  
r.iav be obnoxious to ti e view or marked by  
the suspicions of the President, or to be thought  
dangerous to his or their elections or other in­  
terests, public or personal; that the friendless  
alien lias been selected as the safest subject of  
a first experiment; but the citizen will soon  
follow, or rather has already followed; for, al­  
ready has a sedition act marked him as a prey :  
That these and successive acts of the same  
character, unless arrested on the threshold, may ,  
tend to drive these states into revolution and|  
blood, and will furnish new calumnies a gains  
republican governments, and new pretexts for;  
those who wish it to be believed, that man can­  
not be governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a dangerous delusion were a confi­  
dence in the men of our choice to silence our  
fears for the safety of our rights; that confi­  
dence is every where the parent of despotism;  
free government is founded in jealousy and not  
in confidence; it is jealousy and not confidence  
  
which prescribes limited constitutions to bind  
down those whom we .are obliged to trust with  
power; that our Constitution has accordingly  
fixed the limits to which and no farther our  
confidence may go; and let the honest advocate  
of confidence read the alien and sedition acts,  
and say if the Constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it created,  
and whether we should he wise in destroying  
those limits? Pet him suv what the government  
is, if it he nut a tyranny, which the men of our  
choice have conferred on the President, and  
the Presidentjof our choice has assented to and  
accepted over the friendly strangers, to whom  
the mild spirit of our country and its laws had  
pledged hospitality and protection; that the  
men of our choice have more respected the hare  
suspicions of the President than the solid rights  
of innocence, the claims of justification, the  
sacred force of truth, and the forms and sub­  
stance of law and justice. In question of pow­  
er then let no more be said of confidence in  
man, but bind him down from mischief by the  
chains of the Constitution. That this com­  
monwealth poes therefore call on its co  
states for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes herein before speci­  
fied, plainly declaring whether these acts are  
or are not authorized by the federal compact.  
And it doubts not that their sense will be so an­  
nounced as to prove their attachment to limit­  
ed government, whether general or particular,  
and that the rights and liberties of co-states will  
be exposed to no dangers by remaining em­  
barked on a common bottom with their own:  
But they will concur with this commonwealth  
in considering the said acts as so palpably a­  
gainst the Constitution as to amount to an un !  
disguished declaration, that the compact is noi&#x27;  
meant to be the measure of the powers of the  
general government, but that if will proceed in  
  
the exercise over the states of all powers what­  
soever. That they will view this as seizing  
the rights of the states and consolidating them  
in the hands of the General Government, with  
a power assumed to hind the statos (not merely  
in cases made federal) hut in all cases what­  
soever, by laws made, not with their consent,  
but by others against their consent; that this  
would be to render the form of government wo  
have chosen, and live under one deriving its  
powers from its own will, and not from our  
authority; and that the co-states recurring to  
[their natural rights in cases not mado federal,  
  
will concur in declaring these void and of no  
force, aand will each mute with this common­  
wealth in requesting their repeal at the next  
session of Congress

tains solely and exclusively to the respective States,

:t. Resolctd, That it is true as a general principle,

inents to the Constitution, that &quot;the powers not dele­  
gated to the U.S. by the Constitution, nor prohibited

and of the press may be abridged without lessening  
their useful freedom, and how far those abuses which  
cannot be separated from their use, should be tole­  
rated rather than the use be destroyed; and thus also,  
they guarded against all abridgment by the U. States  
of the freedom of religious opinion and exercises, and ?  
retained to themselves the right of protecting the same,  
as this S ate bv a law passed on tin* general demand of  
its citizens, had already pr&gt; .ected them from ail human  
restraint or interference: And that in addition to this I  
general principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision lias been made by one of tlie  
amendments to the Constitution, which expressly do- i  
clares. that ,kL,oiijjr,j|i- make no law respecting au  
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exer­  
cise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or ol

under the same words, the freedom of religion, ot;  
speech, and of the press, iusomnch, that whatever vio-;  
lateseither, throws down the sanctuary which covers  
the others, and that libels, falsehoods, and defamation,  
equally with heresy and false religion, are withheld j  
from the cognizance of Federal tribunals: &#x27;1 hat there-j  
fore the acl of the Congress of the U. S., paused on the  
1-1 til day of July, I7Ud, entitled &quot;an act, in addition to  
the act, for the punishment of certain crimes against (  
the U. S.,&quot; which does abridge the freedom of the ;  
press, is not law, but is altogether void and of no ef­  
fect.  
?J. Rcsoleed, That alien friends are under the juris­  
diction and protection of the laws of the Slate wherein  
they are; that no power over them has been delegated (  
to the U. S., nor prohibited to the individual Slates dis-;  
linct from their power over citizens; and it being true J  
j as a general principle, and one of the amendments to j  
j the Constitution having also declared, that &quot;the pow-,  
ers not delegated to the I . S. by the Constitution, nor I  
prohibited by it to the Slates, are reserved to the States  
respectively or to the People,&quot; the act of the Congress  
of the U. S., passed on the &quot;^id day of June, 17!&#x27;if, en- j  
titled &quot;an act concerning aliens,&quot; which assumes power ,  
over alien friends not delegated by the Constitution, is  
not law, but is altogether void and of no force.  
5. Rcsoleed, That in addition to the general principle j  
as well as the express declaration, that powers not dele- j  
gated are reserved, another and more special provision !  
inserted in the Constitution from abundant caution has j  
declared, &quot;that the migration or importation of such  
persons as any of the Stales now existing shall think 1  
proper to admit, shall not he prohibited by the Congress  
prior to the year IrObThat this Commonwealth does  
admit the migration of alien friends described as the  
subject of the said act concerning aliens: that a provi-1  
sion against prohibiting their migration, is a provision  
against all acts equivalent thereto, or it would be nu­  
gatory: that to remove them when migrated, is equiva­  
lent to a prohibition of their migration,and is therefore  
contrary to the said provision of the Constitution, and  
void.  
I?. Jicsolved, That the imprisonment of a person un­  
der the protection of the laws of this Commonwealth &#x27;  
on his failure to obey the simple order of the 1&#x27;resident,  
to depart out of the L&#x27;nited States, as is undertaken by  
the said act, entitled &quot;an act concerning aliens,&quot; is con­  
trary to the Constitution, one amendment to which has  
provided, that &quot;no person shall be deprived of liberty  
without due process of law,&quot; and that another having j  
provided, &quot;that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused  
shall enjoy the right to a public trial by an impartial  
jury, to be informed of the nature and cause of the  
accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against  
him, t&quot; have compulsory proce?s for obtaining witness­  
es in his favor, and to have lise assistance of counsel  
for his defence,&quot; the same act undertaking to authorise  
| the President to remove a person out of the United  
States who is under the protection of the law, on his |  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury, with- ,  
out public trial, without confrontation of the witnesses j  
against him, without having witnesses in L:s favour, i  
without defence, without counsel, is contrary to these !  
provisions also of the C institution, is therefore not  
law, but utterly void and of no force.  
That transferring the power of judging any person  
who is under the protection of the laws, from the1  
Courts to the President of the United States, as is un- j  
j dertaken by the same act, concerning aliens, is against ,  
I the article of the Constitution, which provides, that  
| &quot;the judicial power of the United States, shall be vest-j  
! ed in Courts, the Judges of which shall hold their of­  
fices during good behaviour, ? and that the said act is  
j void for that reason also ;. and it is further to be n&quot;tcd, ;  
that this transfer of Judiciary power is to that magis-j  
j irate of the General Government who already pos­  
sesses all the Executive, and a qualified negative in all 1  
the Legislative powers.  
  
7. litsiilrerl, That the construction applied by the  
General Government, (as is evinced by sundry of their  
proceedings,) to those parts of the Constitution of the  
United Slates which delegate to Congress a power to  
lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises ; to  
pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and  
general welfare of the U nited States, and to make all j  
laws which shall be necessary and proper lor carrying]  
into execution the powers vested by the Constitution 1  
in tlie Government of the United States, or any de- ;  
partment thereof, &lt;roes to the destruction of all the!  
i:ii)its prescribed to their power by the Constitution? !  
That words meant hyth.it instrument to be subsidiary |  
only to the execution of the limited powers, ought not  
to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited  
powers, nor a part ao to be taken, as to destroy the  
whole residue of the instrument: That I he proceed­  
ings of the General Government under colour of these  
articles, will lie a lit and necessary subject for revisal  
and correction at a time of greater tranquillity, while  
those specified in the preceding resolutions call for im­  
mediate redress.  
Resulted, Tint the preceding resolutions be trans­  
mitted to the Senators and Representatives in Congress  
from this Commonwealth, who are hereby enjoined Id  
present the same to their respective Mouses, and to u.-e  
their best endeavors to procure at the next session of  
Congress, a repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional and  
i obnoxious acts  
!&gt;. Ilesulcrtl, lastly, That the Governor of this Com­  
I tnonweallh be, and is hereby authorized a:&gt;d requested  
to communicate the preceding resolutions to the Le- j  
i gislaturcs of the several States; to assure them that this  
1 Commonwealth considers Union for specified National  
j purposes, and particularly for those specified in their  
late Federal Compact, to be friendly to the peace, hap­  
piness, and prosperity of all the States: that faithful  
to that Compact, according to the plain intent and  
meaning in which it was understood and acceded to  
by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation: that it does also believe, that to take from  
the States all the powers of self-government, and trans­  
! fer them to a general and consolidated government,  
j without regard to the special delegations and re­  
servations solemnly agreed to in that Compact, is  
not fur the peace, happiness &lt; r prosperity of these  
States: And that therefore, this Commonwealth is  
determined, as it doubts not its co-States are, tame­  
ly to submit to undelegated and consequently un­  
limited powers in no man or body of men on  
earth: that if the acts before specified should stand,  
these conclusions would How from them; that the Ge­  
neral Government may place any act they think pro­  
pe? on the list of crimes, and punish it themselves, whe­  
ther enumerated or not enumerated by the Constitution  
as cognizable by them; that they may transfer its cog­  
nizance to the President or any other person, who may  
himself be the accuser, counsel, judge and jury, whose  
suspicions may be the evidence, his order the bentence,  
i his officer the executioner, and his breast the sole re- j  
cord of the transaction; that a very numerous and va-1  
luable description of the inhabitants of these States, |  
being by this precedent reduced as outlaws to the j  
| absolute dominion of one man and the barrier of the  
i Constitution thus swept awny from us uil, no ram­  
part now remains against the passions and the pow­  
er of a majority ot&#x27; Congress, to protect from a like  
exportation or other more grievous punishment the  
minority of the same body, the Legislatures, Judges,  
Governors and Councillors of the States, nor their  
other peaceablc inhabitants who may venture to re­  
claim the Constitutional rights and liberties of the  
States and people, or who for other causes, good or bad,  
may be obnoxious to the view s, or marked by the suspi­  
cions of the President, or be thought dangerous to his  
or their elections, or other interests public or personal;  
that the friendless alien has indeed been selected as the  
safest subject of a first experiment; but the citizen will  
soon follow, or rather has already followed; for, already  
has a Sedition Act marked him as it, prey; that these  
and successive acts of the same character, unless  
arrested on the threshold, may tend to drive these  
States into revolution and blood, and will furnish  
new calumnies against Republican Governments, and  
  
I now pretexts for those who wish it to bo believed  
that man cannot be governed but by a rod of iron&#x27;  
| liiat it would bo a dangerous delusion, were .1 confi.  
[ donee in the men of our choice, lo silence our fears  
| for the safety of cur rights: ? h.-.t confidence is eve.  
ry where the parent of despotism: free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence: it is jeal­  
ousy and not confidence which prescribes limited Con­  
stitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to  
trust with power: that our Constitution has according.  
| ly fixed the limits to which and no further our conti­  
deuce may go, and let the honest advocate of eoi;f4.  
dence read the Alien and Sedition Acts, and say if t|le  
Constitution has not been wise in fixing limits to the  
Government it created, and whether we should be v..-r  
in destroying those limits? Let him say what the &lt;i ,  
vernment is it&#x27; it he not a tyranny, which the men ofoi,r

| dent of our choice has assented to and accepted ov r  
! the friendly strangers, to whom the mild spirit of &lt; ur

j the bare suspicions of the President, than the so;:&lt;i  
1 rights of innocence, the claims of justification, the sa­

J and justice. In questions of power, then, let no more  
be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from  
mischief, by the chains of the Constitution. That tlni  
Commonwealth does therefore call on its co-States r  
an expression of their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for the punishment of certain crimes herein,  
before specified, plainly declaring whether these acts  
are or are not authorised by the Federal Compact? And  
it doubts not that their sense will be so announced, as  
to prove their attachment unaltered to limited govern­  
ment, whether general or particular, and that the ri?r{,?.  
and liberties of their co-States, will be exposed to u&lt;,  
dangers bv remaining embarked on a common b &gt;t:,  
with their own: That they will concur with this Com.  
monwealth in considering the said acts were so pnlpa.  
bly against the Constitution, as to amount to an undis.  
gsiised declaration, that the Compact is not meant to bv  
the measure of the powers of the General Government,  
but that it will proceed in the exercise over these Statu  
of all powers whatsoever: That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the States and consolidating them  
in the hands of the General Government, with a pov\­  
er assumed to bind the States, (not merely in case#  
made Federal,) but in all cases whatsoever, by law*  
made, not w th their consent, but by other* against  
their consent : That this would be to surrender the  
form of government we have chosen, and to live under  
one deriving its powers from its own will, and not fr nt  
our authority; and that the co-States recurring to their  
natural right in eases not made Federal, will c ncur 111  
declaring these acts void and of 110 force, and will eatii  
unite with this Commonwealth in requesting their r.

ompact each State ac­  
ceded as a State, and is an integral party, its co­  
States forming as to itself, the other party: That  
the Government created by this compact was not  
made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of  
the powers delegated to itself; since that would  
have made its discretion, and not the Constitution,  
the measure of its powets; but that as in all other  
cases of compact among parties having no common  
judge, each party has an equal right to judge for  
itself, as well of infractions, as of the mode and  
measures of redress.  
2. Resolred, That the Constitution of the U. S.  
having delegated to Congress a power to punish  
treason, counterfeiting the securities and current  
coin of the U. S., piracies and felonies committed  
on the high seas, and offences against the laws of  
nations, and no other crimes whatever, and it be­  
ing true as a general principle, and one of the  
amendments to the Constitution having also de­  
clared, &quot;that the powers not delegated to the U.  
S by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, are reserved to the States respectively, or  
to the people;&quot; therefore also the same act of  
Congress, passed on the 14th day of July, 1798,  
and entitled &quot;an act, in addition to the act entitled  
an act, for the punishment of certain crimes against  
the U.S.;&quot; as also the act passed by them on the  
27th day of June, 1798, entitled &quot;an act, to pun­

(and all other acts which assume to create, define  
  
or punish crimes other than those enumerated in  
  
the Constitution,) are altogether void and of no  
  
force, and that the power to create, define, and  
  
punish such other crimes is reserved, and of right  
  
appertains solely and exclusively to the respectiv  
States, each within its own territory.  
9. Resolved, That it is true as a general princi  
  
ple, and is also expressly declared by one of the  
amendments to the Constitution, that &quot;the powers  
not delegated to the U.3, by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the  
States respectively, or to the People;&quot; and that  
  
no power over the freedom of religion, freedom of  
  
speech, or freedom of the press, being delegated to  
the U. S, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it  
  
to the States, all lawful powers respecting the same  
did of right remain, and were reserved to the  
  
States, er to the people: That thus was manifested  
their determination to retain to themselves the right  
of judging how far the licentiousness of speech  
and of the press may be abridged without lessen-  
  
ing their useful freedom, and how far those abuses  
which cannot be separated from their use, should  
  
he tolerated rather than the use be destroyed; and  
  
thus also, they guarded against all abridgment by  
  
the U. States of the freedom of religious opinion  
and exercises, and retained to themselves the right  
of protecting the same, as this State by a law pass­  
ed on the general demand of its citizens, had al-  
  
ready protected them from all human restraint or  
  
interference: And that in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and more  
special provision has been made by one of the  
  
amendments to the Constitution, which expressly  
declares, that &quot;Congress shall make no law re-  
  
pecting an establi-hment of religion, or prohibiting  
  
the free excreise thereof, or abridging the freedom  
of speech, or of the press,&quot; thereby guarding in  
the same sentence, and under the same words, the  
freedom of religion, of speech, and of the press,  
insomuch, that whatever violates either, throws  
down the sanctuary which covers the others, and  
that libels, falsehoods, and defamation, equally with  
heresy and false religion, are withheld from the  
cognizance of F&#x27;ederal tribunals: That therefore  
the act of the Congress of the U. S., passed on the  
14th day of July, 1798, entitled &quot;an act, in addi­  
tion to the act, for the punishment of certain crimes  
egainst the U.S.,&quot; which does abridge the freedom  
of the press, is not law, but is altogether void and  
of no effect.  
  
t. Resolved, That alien friends are under the  
jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the State  
  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
  
been delegated to the U. S., nor prohibited to the  
  
individual States distinct from their power over  
  
citizens; and it being true as a general principle  
  
and one of the amendments to the Constitution hav-  
  
ing also declared, that &quot;the powers not delegated  
  
to the U.S, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by  
  
it to the States, are reserved to the States respee.  
tively or to the People,&quot; the act of the Congrest  
  
of the U. S., passed on the 22d day of June, 1798,  
  
entitled &quot;an act concerning aliens,&quot; which assumes  
power over alien friends not delegated by the Con-  
  
stitution, is not law, but is altogether void and of  
  
no force.  
5, Resolved, That in addition to the general  
principle as well as the express declaration, that  
powers not delegated are reserved, another and  
more special provision inserted in the Constitution  
  
from abundant caution has declared, &quot;that the mt­  
gration or importation of such persons as any of  
  
the States now existing shall think proper to admit,  
thall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the  
year 1808,&quot; That this Commonwealth does admit  
the migration of alien friends described as the sub­  
ject of the said act concerning aliens; that a pro­  
vision against prohihiting their migration, is a pro-  
  
vision against all acts equivalent thereto, or it would  
  
be negitory; that to remove them when migrated  
is equivalent to a prohibition of their migration, and  
  
is therefore contrary to the said provision of the  
  
Constitution, and void.  
  
6. Resolre!, That the imprisonment of a person  
  
under the protection of the laws of this Common  
  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order of  
  
the President, to depart out of the United Stater  
  
as is undertaken by the said act, entitled &quot;an act  
  
concerning alions,&quot; is contrary to the Constitution  
  
one amendment to which has provided, that &quot;no  
  
person shall be deprived of liberty without due pro  
cess of law,&quot; and that another having provided  
  
&quot;that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall  
  
enjoy the right to a public trial by an impartial ju  
  
ry, to be informed of the nature and cause of the  
  
accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses  
  
egainst him, to have compulsory process for obtain  
ing witnesses in his favor, and to have the assis  
  
tanet of counsel for his defence,&quot; the same act un  
  
dertaking to anthorise the President to remove a  
person out of the United States who is under the  
  
protection of the law, on his own suspicion, with  
out accusation, without jury, without public trial  
without confrontatien of the witnesses against him  
  
without having witnesses in his favour, without de  
fence, without counsel, is contrary to these provis  
  
ions alto of the Constitution, is therefore not law  
but utterly veid and of no force.  
  
That transferring the power of judging any per-  
  
on who is under the protection of the laws, from  
  
the Courts to the President of the United State  
  
as is undertaken by the same act, concerning aliens,  
  
is against the article of the Constitution, which pro  
  
vides, that &quot;the judicial power of the United States,  
  
hall be vested in Courts, the Judges of which shall  
hold their offices during good behaviour,&quot; and that  
the said act is void for that reason also; and it is  
  
further to be noted, that this transfer of Judiciary  
  
power is to that magistrate of the General Govern  
  
ment who already possesses all the Excentive, and  
  
a qualthed negative in all legislative powers.  
7. Resolve!, That the construction applied by  
the General Government, (as is evinced by sundry  
  
of their proceedings,) to those parts of the Consti.  
  
tution of the United States which delegate to Con­  
gress a power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im­  
posts, and excises; to pay the debts, and provide  
for the common defence and general welfre  
of the United States, and to make all laws which  
hall be necessary and proper for carrying into ex­  
ecution the powers vested by the Constitution in  
the Government of the United States, or any de.  
  
tinent mereol soes to the destruction of all the  
limits prescribed to their power by the Constitution  
That words meant by that instrument to be sub­  
sidiary only to the execution of the limited powers  
ought not to be so construed as themselves to give  
unlimited powers, nor a part so to be taken, as to  
destroy the whole residue of the instrument. That  
  
the proceedings of the General Government under  
  
colour of these articles, will be a fit and necessary  
  
subject for revisal and correction at a time of great  
  
er tranquility, while those specified in the precedin  
  
resolutions call for immediate redress.  
  
S. Resolved, That the preceding resolutions I  
  
transmitted to the Senators and Representatives in  
  
Congress from this Commonwealth, who are here  
  
by enjoined to present the same to their respectiv  
  
Houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of Congress, a repeal of the  
  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
  
9. Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
  
Commonwealth be, and is hereby anthorized and  
requested to communicate the preceding resolutions  
to the Legislatures of the several States; to assure  
  
them that this Commonwealth considers Union for  
  
specified National purposes, and particularly for  
  
those specified in their late Federal Compact, to be  
  
friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosperity of  
  
all the States; that faithful to that Compact, ac  
  
cording to the plain intent and meaning in which it  
  
was understood and acceded to by the several par.  
  
ties, it is sincerely anxious for its preservation; that  
it does not believe, that to take from the States all  
the powers of self-Government, and transfer them  
  
to a general and consolidated government, without  
regard to the special delegations and reservations  
  
solemnly agreed to in that Compact, is not for the  
  
peace, happiness or prosperity of these States: And  
  
that therefore, this Commonwealth is determined  
  
is it doubt not its co-States are, tamely to submit  
  
to undelegated and consequently unlimited powers  
  
in no man or body of men on earth: that if the acts  
before specified should stand, these conclusions  
  
would flow from them; that the General Govern  
  
ment may place any act they think proper on the  
list of crimes, and punish it themselves, whether  
  
enumerated or not enumerated by the Constitution  
  
as cognizable by them; that they may transfer its  
  
cognizance to the President or any other person,  
who may himself be the accuser, counsel, judge  
  
and jury, whose suspicions may be the evidence  
  
his order the sentence, his officer the erecutioner,  
  
and his breast the sole record of the transaction;  
  
that a very numerous and valuable description of  
  
the inhabitants of these States, being by this pre  
  
edent reduced as outlaws to the absolute domin-  
  
ion of one man and the barrier of the Constitution  
thus swept away from us all, no rampart now re­  
mains against the passions and the power of a mas  
  
jority of Congress, to protect flom a like exportae  
  
tion or other more grievous punishment the minor­  
ity of the same body, the Legislature, Judges, Gov­  
ernors and Councillors of the States, nor their oth-  
er peaceable inhabitants who may venture to re­  
claim the Constitutional rights and liberties of the  
States and people, or who for other causes, good  
or bad, may be obnoxious to the views, or marked  
by the suspicions of the President, or be thought  
dangerous to his or their elections, or other inter­  
ests public or personal; that the friendless alien has  
indeed been selected as the safest subject of a first  
  
experiment; but the citizen will soon follow, or  
rather has already followed; for, already has a se-  
  
dition Act marked him as its prey; that these and  
  
uccessive acts of the same character, unless arrest  
  
ed on the threshold, may tend to drive these State  
  
into revolution and blood, and will furnish new  
  
calumnies against Republican Governments, and  
  
new pretexts for those who wish it to he believed  
that man cannot be governed hut by a rod of iron  
that it would be a dangerous delusion, were a con  
  
fidence in the men of our choice, to silence our  
  
fears for the safety of our rights; that confidence is  
  
every where the parent of despotismn: free govern­  
ment is founded in jealousy and not in confidence;  
  
it is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
  
limited Constitutions to bind down those whom wi  
  
are obliged to trust with power: that our Consti  
  
tution has accordingly fixed the limits to which and  
  
no further our confidence may go, and let the hon  
et leete af weitta ae e i aaee  
  
est dvoele of confdence read the Alien and Se  
  
dition Acts, and say if the Constitution has not  
  
been wise in sixing limits to the Government it  
created, and whether we should be wise in destroy­  
ing those limits? Let him say what the Govern-  
  
ment is if it be not a tyranny, which the men of  
  
our choice have conferred on the President, and  
the President of our choice has assented to and ac­  
cepted over the friendly strangers, to whom the  
mild spirit of our country and its laws had pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men of our  
  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
  
the President, than the solid rights of innocence  
  
the claims of justification, the sacred force of truth  
  
and the forms and substance of law and justice.  
  
In questions of power, then, let no more be heard  
  
of confidence in man, but hind him down from mi  
  
chief, by the chains of the Constitution. That this  
  
Commonwealth does therefore call on its co-State  
  
for an expression of their sentiments on the acts  
  
concerning aliens, and for the punishment of cer  
  
tain crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly declming  
  
whether these acts are or are not authorized by the  
  
Federal Compact? And it doubts not that their  
  
sense will be to announced, as to prove their at-  
  
tachment unaltered to limited government, whether  
  
general or particular, and that the rights and liber  
  
ties of their co-States, will be exposed to no dan-  
  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own: That they will concur with this  
Commonwealth in considering the said acts were  
  
so palpably against the Constitution, as to amount  
to an undisguised declaration, that the Compact i  
  
not meant to be the measure of the powers of the  
  
General Government, but that it will proceed in  
  
the exereise over these States of all powers what  
  
oever? That they will view this as seizing the  
  
rights of the States and consolidating them in the  
  
hands of the General Government, with a power  
  
assumed to hind the States, (not merely in cases  
made Federal,) but in all cases whatsoever, by  
  
laws made, not with their consent, but by others  
  
against their consent: That this would be to sur-  
  
render the form of Government we have chosen,  
  
and to live under one deriving its powers from its  
  
own will, and not from our authority; and that the  
co-States recurring to their natural right in cases  
  
not made Federal, will concur in declaring thes,  
  
acts void and of no force, and will  
  
his Commonwealth in requesting their repeal at  
the next session of Congress.

 Stale acceded as a State, and  
is an integral party, its co-States forming  
as to itself, the other party ! That the  
Government created by ibis compact was  
not made the exclusive or final judge of  
the extent of the powers delegated to it­  
self; since that &quot;vould have made its  
discretion, and not the Constitution, the  
measure of its powers ; hut that as in nil  
other cases of compact among parties  
having no common judge, each party lias  
an equal right to judge for itself, as Weil  
of infractions, as of the mode and mea­  
sure of rcdresb.  
2. Resohtd, That the Constitution of  
the United Stales having delegated to  
Congress a power to punish treason,  
counterfeiting the securities and current  
coin of th U. S., piracies and felonies  
commuted on the high seas, and offen  
ces iigaiiisl the laws ot nations, ami no  
other crimes whatever, and it being true  
as a &#x27;general principle, and one of the a  
iiiendmenls to the Constitution hating  
also declared, &quot; that the powers not de  
legated to the U. S. by the Constitution,  
nor prohibited by if to the Status, are re  
served. to-lhe Elates repclivelyj or to  
the people : therefore, also the same act  
of Congress, passed on the I4tj day of  
July, 1798, and entitled &quot;an act, in ad  
dition to the act entitled an act for the  
punishment of certain crimes against tho  
U.S.;&#x27;&#x27; as also tho act passed-by them  
on the 27th day of June, 1798, entitled  
&quot;an act to punish frauds committed on  
the Bank of the U. S.,&quot; (and all other  
acts which assume to create, define, or  
punish ciimes other than those enume­  
rated in the Constitution,) are altogether  
void and of no force, and that the power  
to create, define, and punish such other  
crimes is reserved, and cf right, apper­  
tains solely and exclusively to the re­  
spective Stales, each within its own ter­  
ritory.- U. fJeoZerf,-That it is true as a gen­  
eral principle, and is also expressly de­  
clared by one of the amendments to the  
Constitution, &quot;that the powers not dele­  
gated to the U. S. by the Constitution,  
nor prohibited by it to the States, are re­  
served to the States respectively, orto  
the people ;&quot; and that no power over the  
freedom of religion, freedom of speech,  
or freedom of the preps, being delegated  
to the U. S. by the Constitution; nor pro­  
hibited by it to ihe States, &#x27;all lawful  
powers respecting the same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the States,  
or to the people : That thus was manifes­  
ted their determination to retain to them­  
selves the right of judging how far the  
licentiousness of speech and of the press  
may be abridged without lessening theirf1  
useful freedom, and how far those abuses  
which cannot be&#x27; separated from their  
use, should be tolerated rather than the  
use be destroyed ; and thus also, they  
guarded against all abridgment by the  
U. S. of the freedom of religous opinion  
and exeicises, and retained to themselves  
Ihe right of protecting the same, os this  
State by a law passed on the general de­  
mand of its citizens, had already pro­  
tected them from all human restraint or  
interference: And that in addition to  
this general principle and express decla­  
ration, another and more special provi­  
sion has been made by one of the amend­  
ments to the Constitution&quot;, which ex­  
pressly declares, that &quot; Congress shall  
  
make no law respecting an establishment  
of religion, or prohibiting the free exer­  
cise thereof, or abridging the freedom of  
speech, or of the press,&quot; thereby guard­  
ing in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of  
speech, and of the press, insomuch, that  
whatever violates either, throws down  
the sanctuary which covirs the others,  
and that libels, falsehoods, and defama­  
tion, equally with heresy and false reli­  
gion, are withheld from the cognizance  
of Federal tribunals: That therefore the  
act of the Congress of the U. S. passed  
on the 14th day of July, 1798, entitled  
&quot;an act in addition to the act, for the  
punishment of certain crimes against the  
U. S.,&quot; which does abiidge the freedom  
of the press, is not law, but is altogether  
void ai d of no effect.  
4. Resolved, That alien friends are  
under the jurisdiction and protection of  
the laws of the State wherein they are ;  
that no power over them has been dele­  
gated to the U. S. nor prohibited to the  
individual States distinct from their pow­  
er over citizens ; and it being true as a  
general principle, and one of the amend­  
ments to the Constitution having also  
declared, that &quot; the powers not delega­  
ted to the U. S. by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited , by it to the Slates, are reser­  
ved to the States respectively, or to the  
people,&quot; ihe act of the Congress of the  
U. S. passed on the 22d day of June,  
  
A 4 v-cil i u mi Di.i win .i i iii tfg a i icii  
which assumes power over alien friends  
not delegated by the Constitution, is not  
law, but is altogether void and of no  
force. I  
5. Resolved, That in addition to ihe  
general principle as well as the express  
declaration, that powers not delegated  
are reseived, another and more special  
provision inserted in the Constitution  
from abundant cmition has declared, thai  
the migration or importation of such  
persons as any oi ine oiates now exis  
ting shall think proper to admit, shall  
not be prohibited by the Congress prior  
to the year 1808 :&quot; That this Common  
wealth does admit Ihe migration of alien  
friends described as the subject of the  
said act concerning aliens; that a provi  
sion against prohibiting their migration,  
is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would he nuiratnrv : that to  
remote them when migrated, is equiva  
lent to a prohibition of their migration,  
and is therefore contrary to the said pro  
vision of Ihe Constitution, and void.  
6.. Mesoletd, 1 bat tho imprisonment  
of a person under the protection of the  
laws of this Commonwealth on his fail  
tire to obey the simple order of the Pre  
sident, to depart out i f the United Stales,  
as is undertaken by the aid Act, etui  
tied &quot;an act concerning aliens,&quot; is con  
(rary to the Constitution, one amend  
meut to v l ic II tins provided, uiai no  
person shall be deprived of liberty with  
out due process ot law, and mat an­  
other having provided, 44 that in all cri­  
minal piosecutions, the accused shall en  
joy the right of a pubi c trial by an nn  
partial juiv, to be informed of the na  
ture and cause of the accusation, to be  
confronted with the witnesses against  
him, to have compulsory process for ob  
tain ids&#x27; witnesses in bis favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel for his de  
fence,&quot; Ihe same acl undertaking to an  
thorise the President to remove a person  
out of the U. Slates, who is under the  
protection of ihe law, on his own suspi­  
cion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confronta­  
tion of the witnesses against him, with­  
out having witnesses in his favor, with­  
out defence, without counsel, is contra­  
ry to these provisions also of the Con­  
stitution, is iherefo e not law, but utter­  
ly void and of no force.  
That transferring ihe powerf judging  
any person who is under the protection  
of the laws, from I h Courts to the Pre­  
sident of the United States, as is under­  
taken by the same act, concerning a­  
liens, is against the article of the Con­  
stitution, which provides, that &quot; the ju­  
dicial power of the United States shall  
be vested in Courts, ihe Judges of which  
shall hold their offices during good be­  
havior,&quot; and t ha Lllie said act is void for  
that reason also ; and it isfuitherto be  
noted, that this transfer of Judiciary  
power ia to that migistrate of the Gene  
ral Government who already possesses  
all the Executive, and a qualified nega  
live on all the Legislative powers.  
.7. Resolved, That the construction  
applied by the General Government, (as  
is evidenced by sundry of their proceed­  
ings,) lo those parts of the Constitution  
of the United States which delegate to  
Congress a power to lay and collect tax­  
es, duties, imposts, and excise; to pay  
the debts, and provide for the common  
defence and general welfare of the U.  
Stales, and lo make all laws which shall  
be necessary and proper for carrying in­  
to execution the powers vested by ihe  
Constitution in the Government of the  
United States, or any department thereof,  
goes to the destruction of all the limits  
prescribed to their power by the Consti­  
tution.&#x27; That words meant by that in­  
strument lo be subsidiary only to the ex­  
ecution of the limited powers, ought not  
to be so construed as themselves to give  
unlimited powers, nor a part so to be ta-  
  
ken, as to destroy the wnote residue oi  
the instiument : That the proceedings of  
the General Government ui.der color of  
these articles, Will be a fit and necessary  
subject for revisaUand correction at a  
  
lime of greater tranquility, while those  
specified in the preceding resolutions,!  
call for immediate redress.  
8. Resolved, That the preceding re-i  
solutions be transmitted to the Senators  
and Representatives in Congress frojn  
this Commonwealth, who are hereby en-  
oined to present the same to thcr re  
spective Houses, arid to use their best  
endeavors to procure at the next session  
of Congress, a repeal of the aforesaid  
unconstitutional and obnoxiouh acts. $  
9. Resolved, lastly, That the Govern-  
- J- . l.aa 1-  
or ot tnis common weaun be, ana is  
hereby authorized and request d to com  
municate the preceding resolutions to  
the Legislatures of the several Stales; to

purposes, and particularly for.i hose speci­

prosperity Of all the Slate? i t ha I faithful  
to that compact,, according to the plain  
intent and meaning in which it was un­  
derstood and acceded to by the several  
parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation : that it does also believe  
that to take from the Slates all the pow  
ers of self government, and transfer them  
to a general and consolidated govern­  
ment, without regard lo the special del­  
egations and reservations solemnly a­

for other causes, good or bad, may be ob  
noxious to the view,or marked hythr  
suspicions of the President, or be thought  
dangerous to his or their elections, or  
other interests politic or personal; that  
the friendless alien has indeed been se­  
lected as the safest subject of a first ex­  
periment; but the citizens will soon fol  
low, or rather has already followed; for,  
already bas a Sedition act marked him  
as its prey; that these and successive  
acts of the same character, unless arrest­  
ed on the threshold, may tend to drive  
these Stales into revolution and blood,  
and will furnish new calumnies&#x27; against  
Republican Governments, andnew-pretexts  
for those who wish it to be believed,  
(hat man cannot be ruled but with a rod  
of iron &#x27; that it would-be a dangerous de­  
lusion, were a Confidence in the men of  
our choice,- to silence our fears for the  
safety of our rights : that confidence is  
every where the parent of despotism:  
free government is founded in jealousy  
and not confidence; it is jealousy and  
not confidence which prescribes hunted  
Constitutions to bind down those whom  
wo are obliged to trust with power : tnai j  
our Constitution has accordingly fixed  
the limits to which and no further our  
confidence can go, and let the honest ad  
vocate of confidtfgee read the Alien and  
Sedition Acts and say if th Constitution  
has not been wise in fixing limits to the  
Government it created, and whether we  
should, be wise in destroying those lim­  
its? Let him say what the Government  
is, if ii be not a tyranny, which the men  
of our choice have confer d on the Presi­  
dent, and the President of our choice has  
assented to and accepted over the friend­  
ly strangers, to whom the mild spirit of  
our country and its laws had pledged  
hospitality and protection: that the men  
of our choice have more resccted the  
bare suspicions of the President, than the  
solid rights of innocence, the claims of  
justification, the sacred force of truth,  
. . . a  
and the forms and substance ot law ana  
justice. In questions of power, then, let  
no more be heard ot confidence, in man,  
but bind him down from mischief, Sy the  
chains of the Constitution. That this  
Commonwealth does therefore call on its  
co-States for an expression of their sen-  
itimenta on the act concerning aliens,  
  
. , ,  
  
and for tbe punishmentof certain crimps  
herein before specified, plainly declar­  
ing whether tbse acts are or are not  
authorised by tbe Federal Compact ?  
And it doubts not that their sense will  
be so announced, as to prove their at-1  
lachment unaltered to Hunted govern­  
ment, whether general or particular, and  
that the rights and liberties of their co-  
States, will be exposed lo no dangers by  
remaining embarked on a common bot  
tom with their own : 1 hat they will con  
cur with this Commonwealth in consid  
v a -ft&#x27; . I .  
ering tne said acts were so paipaoiy a-  
gainst the Constitution, as to amount to  
an undisguised declaration, that the com  
pact is not meant lo be the measure of  
the powers of the General Government,  
but that it will proceed in the exercise  
over these States of all powers whatsoev­  
er: That they will view- this as seizing  
the rights of the Slates and consolidating  
them in the hands of the General Gov­  
ernment, with a power assumed to bind  
the Slates, (not merely in cases made  
Federal,) hot in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made, not with theii consent, hut by  
others against their consent : That this  
would be to surrender the form of gov  
ernment we have chosen, and to live un  
der one deriving its powers from its own  
will, and not from our authority; and  
that the co-Mates recurring to their na­  
tural right in cases not made Federal,  
will concur in declaring these acts void  
and of no force, and will each unite with  
this Commonwealth in requesting their  
repeal at the next session of Congress

s compact each  
State acceded ;u&gt; a State, and is an integral party, its  
co Slates forming as to itself, the other party: That  
the Government created by this compact was not made  
the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the pow­  
ers delegated to itself; since that would have made its  
discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of  
its powers ; but that as in all olbcr cases of compact  
among |&gt;arties having no common judge, each party  
has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of in­  
fractions, us of the mode and measures of red rets.  
&#x27;.2. Resolved, That the Constitution of the U. States  
having delegated to Congress a power to punish trea­  
son, counterfeiting the securities and current coin of  
the U. S., piracies and felonies committed on the high  
seas, and offences against the laws of nations, and no  
other crimes whatevet, and it being true as a general  
principle, and one of the amendments to the Constitu­  
tion having also declaied, &quot;that the powers not dele­  
gated to the U. S. by the Constitution, nor prohibited  
by it to the States, are reserved to the States resjiect­  
ively, or to the people therefore also the same act of  
Congress passed on the I-1th day of July, 1798, and en­  
titled &quot;an act, in addition to the act entitled an act,  
for the punishment of certain dimes against the U. S.&quot;  
as also the act parsed by them on the 27th day of June,  
179H, entitled &quot;an act, to punish frauds committed on  
the Bank of the U. S.(and all other acts which as­  
sume to create, define, or punish crimes other than  
those enumerated in the Constitution,) are altogether  
void and of no force, and that the power to create, de­  
fine, and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of  
right ap|&gt;ertains solely and exclusively to the respect­  
ive Stales,Jeach within its own territory.  
3. Resolred, That it is true as a general principle,  
and is also expressly declared by one of the amend­  
ments of the Constitution, that &quot;the (lowers not delega­  
ted to the U. S. by the Constitution, nor prohibited by  
it to the States,are reserved to the State* respectively, or  
to the People and that no power over the freedom of  
religion, or freedom of speech, or freedom of the press,  
being delegated to the U. S. by, the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the Slates, all lawful powers re­  
secting the same did of right remain, and were reserv­  
ed to the States, or to the (icople : That thus was man­  
ifested their determination to retain to themselves the  
right of judging how far the licentiousness of speech  
and of the press may be abridged without lessening  
their useful freedom, und how far those abuses which  
cannot be separated from their use, should be tolerated  
rather than the use be destroyed ; and thus also, they  
guarded against all abridgement by the U. States of  
the freedom of religious opinion and exercise, and re­  
tained to themselves the right of protecting the same,  
us this Slate by a law passed on the general demand  
of its citizens, had already protected them from all  
human restraint or interference. Anil that in addition  
to this general principle and express declaration, a  
nother and more s|&gt;ecial provision has been made by  
one of the amendments to the Constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, tl at &quot;Congr**s shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting  
the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of  
sjieech, or of the press,&quot; thereby guaiding in the same  
sentence, and under the same words the freedom of  
religion, of sjieech, and of the press, insomuch that  
whatever violates either, throws down the sanctuary  
which covers the otheis, and that libels, falsehoods and  
defamation, equally with heresy and false religion,  
are withheld from the cognizance of tVdral tribunals :  
That therefore iheact of the Congress of the U. S.,  
passed on the 14th day of July, I79H, entitled &quot;an act  
in addition to the act for the punishment of certain  
crimes against the U. S.&quot; which does abridge the  
freedom of the press, is not law, but is altogether void  
and of no effect.  
4. Resolved, That alien friends are under the juris­  
diction and protection of the laws of the State wherein  
they are ; that no power over them has been delegated  
to the United Slates, nor prohibited to the individual  
States distinct froin their power over citizens; and it  
being true es a general piinciple, and one of the amend­  
ments to the Constitution having also declared that  
&quot;the (lowers not delegated to the United Slates by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re­  
served to the States respectively or to the People, the  
act of the Congress of the United States, passed on  
the 22d day of June, 1798, entitled &quot;an act concern­  
ing aliens, &#x27; which assume* power over alien fliends  
not delegated by thei Ccnstitu&#x27;ion, is not law but is  
altogether void and of no foiee.  
5. Resolved, That in addition to the general prin  
ciplea aa well as the express declaration, that powers  
not delegated are reseived, another and more special  
provision inserted in the Constitution from abundant  
caution has declared, &quot;that the migration or impor­  
tation of auch person* aa any of the States now e*­  
  
?sting ahull think proper to admit, (hall n?t !?? pwfci&quot;  
bited by ibe Cuu|| e&gt;&lt; |&gt;r or to the year laOHTliat

thereto, or it would In- nugatory ; that to remove tliuui  
when migrated, ia equivalent to a prohibition of their  
migration, arid in therefore contrary to the said provi­  
sion of the Constitution, and void.  
0. Hctvlctd, That the iiiipriaoumenl of a person  
under the protection of the law* of this Common  
wealth on liu failure to obey (lie simple urdtr of tho  
President, to depart out of the United Slstes, aa ia un­  
dertaken by the aaid act, entitled &quot; an act concerning  
aliens,&quot; ia contrary to the Constitution, one amend­  
ment to w Inch has provided, that &quot; no perkon thai I b?  
deprived of liberty without due process of law, &#x27; ami  
that another having provided-, that in all criminal  
prosecution*, the accused shall enjoy &#x27;he right to a  
public trial by an impartial jury, to be informed of the  
nature and cause of the accusuliun, to be confronted  
with the witnesses against him, to have a compulsory  
process tor obtaining witnessea in his favor, anil to havo  
the aaautance of counsel for his defence,&quot; the same  
act undertaking to uutliorixu the President to remove  
a person out ol the United States, who is under the  
protection of die law, on 1&gt;i? own suspicion, without  
accusation, without jury, without public tiial, without  
confrontation of the witnesses against hiui, without  
having witnesses in his favor, wiMn.ut defence, with­  
out counsel, is contrary *othese provisions also of the  
Constitution; is therefore not law, but utterly void  
and of no force. That transferring the power of judg­  
ing any person who is under the protect.oti of the laws,  
from the Courts to the President of the United State*,  
as is undertsken by the same act concerning aliens, is  
against the article of the Constiiu&#x27;ion, which provides,  
that &quot; the judicial power of the United States shall be  
vested in Courts, toe Judges of which shall hold their  
offices during good behavior,&quot; and that tho said act  
is voiil for that reason also; and it ia further to bo  
noted, that this transfer of Judiciaiy power is to that  
magistrate of the Qenerul Government who already  
possesses all the Executive, and a qualified negative  
111 all the Legislative powers.  
7. Uttolred, That the construction applied by the  
General Government,(aa ia evinced by sundry of their  
proceedings,) to those parts of the Constitution of tho  
Ignited SisUm which u?l?gato to CuiigrtMO u power In  
lay and collect taxes, duties, iuqiosts, and excise* ; to  
pay the debts, and provide for the common defence  
and general welfare of the United States, and to make  
all laws which shall lie necessary and proper for carry­  
ing into execution the (lowers vested by the Constitu­  
tion in the Government of the United States, or any  
department thereof, goes to the destruction of ull the  
limits prescribed to their power by the Con-titution.?  
That words meant by that instrument to be subsidiary  
only to the execution of the limited powers, ought not  
to lie so constructed as themselves to give unlimited  
powers, nor &amp; part so to be taken, as to destroy the  
whole residue of the instrument: That the proceed­  
ings of the General Government under color of these  
articles, will be a lit and necessaiy subject for revisal  
and correction at a tune of greater tranquility, while  
those specified in the preceding resolutions call for im­  
mediate redress.  
8. /tenutrcU, That the preceding r&lt; solutions be trans­  
mitted to the Senators and Ke presents tors in Con­  
gress from this Commonwealth, who are hereby en­  
joined to present the same to their respective Houses,  
and to use their best endeavors to procure at the next  
session of Congress a repeal of the aforesaid uncoil  
stitutional and obnoxious acts.

That confidence is every where the parent of despotism. Free gov-

that thus was manifested their determination

far the licentiousness of speech and of the

useful freedom, and how far those abuses  
which cannot be separated from their use  
should be tolerated, rather than the use he  
destroyed; and thus also they guarded against  
all abridgment, by the United States, of the  
freedom of religious opinions and exercises,  
and retained to themselves the right of pro­  
tection of the same; ns this State, by a law  
passed on the general demand of its citizens,  
had already protected them from all human  
restraints nr i t : ihremee, and that in addition  
to this general principle and express declara  
tion, another and morn special provision has  
been made by one of the amendments to the  
Constitution, which expressly declares that  
“Congress shall make no law respecting an  
• •g.blishmet t of religion, or prohibiting the  
free exercise thereof, or abridging the free­  
dom of speech or of the press ; ” thereby  
guarding, its th • came sentence, and under the  
&gt; am a words, the freedom of religion, ol  
speech, and of the press; insomuch that what­  
ever violates either, 11 trows down the sanctu­  
ary which covers the other, and that libels,  
falsehood, and defamation, equally with her­  
esy and false religion, are withheld from the  
cogttizar.ee of federal tribunals; that there­  
fore the Act of Congress of the United States,  
passed on the 14th day of July, 1793, enti­  
tled “An Act in addition to an Act entitled  
an Act for the punishment of certain ciimes  
against the U. Stales,” which does abridge  
the freedom of the press, is not law, but is al­  
together void and of no force.

being true, as a general principle, and one ol

ing no common juuge, 1 jiivi 1  
HAS AN EQUAL HllillT TO JUDGE  
FOR ITSELF, AS WELL OF INFRAC­  
TIONS AS OF THE MODE AND  
MEASURE OF REDRESS.  
II. Resolved, That the Constitution of  
the United State3 having delegated to Con­  
gress a power to punish treason, counter­  
feiting the securities and current coin of the  
United States, piracies and felonies com­  
mitted on the high seas, and offences a­  
gainst the laws of nations, and no other  
crimes whatever, and it being true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and one of the amend­  
ments to the Constitution having also de­  
clared that &quot;the powers not delegated to the  
United States by the Constitution, nor pro­  
hibited by it to the States, are reserved to  
the States respectively, or to the people,&quot;  
therefore, also, the same Act of Congress,  
passed on the 14th day of July, 1793, and  
entitled &quot;An Act in addition to the Act en­  
titled an Act for the punishment of certain  
crimes against the United States; as, also,  
the Act passed by them on the 27th day of  
June, 1798, entitled &quot;An Act to punish  
frauds committed on the Bank of the United  
States;&quot; (and all other their acts which  
assume to create, define, or punish crimes  
other than those enumerated in the  
Constitution) are altogether void and of no  
force, and that the power to create, define,  
and punish such other crimes, is reserved,  
and of right appertains solely and exclu­  
sively, to the respective States, each within  
its own territory.  
III. Resolved, That it is true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and is also expressly declar­  
ed by one of the amendments to the Con­  
stitution, that &quot;the powers not delegated to  
the United States by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved  
to the States respectivly, or to the people;&quot;  
and, that no power over the freedom of re­  
ligion, freedom of speech, or freedom of the  
press, being delegated to the United States  
by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to  
the States, all lawful powers respecting the  
same did of right remain and were reserved  
to the States or to the people; that thus was  
manifested their determination to retain to  
themselves the right of judging how far the  
licentiousness of speech and of the press  
may be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom, and how far those abuses  
which cannot be separated from their use,  
f-hould be tolerated, rather than the use be  
destroyed; thus also they guarded against  
oll u;,i. u v &#x27;itIua Rtf.o  
all abridgement, by the United States, of  
the freedom of relijrious principles and ex  
ercises, and retained to themselves the  
right of protecting the same, as this, stated  
by a law passed on the general demand of  
its citizens, had already protected them  
from all human restraint or interference:  
and, that, in addition this general principle  
and express declaration, another and more  
inc amenamenis 10 uie onsntuuun, wuu-n  
expressly declares that &quot;Congress shall

zance of Federal tribunals. That there

IV. Resolved, That alien friends are  
under the jurisdiction and protection of the  
laws of the State wherein they are: that  
no power over them has been delegated to  
the United States, nor prohibited to the in­  
dividual States distinct from their power  
ovr citizens; and it being true, as a gener­  
al principle, and one of the amendments to  
the Constitution having also declared that  
&quot;the powers not delegated to the United  
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited  
by it to the States, are reserved to the Sta­  
tes respectively, or to the people,&quot; the Act  
of the Congress of the United States, pass­  
ed the 22d day of June, 1798, entitled &quot;An  
Act concerning Aliens,&quot; which asssumes  
power over alien friends, not delegated by  
the Constitution, is koi law, but is alto-  
gcther void and of ko force.  
. xtcsoivea, i nai in aacuuon to tne  
general principle as well as the express  
declaration that powers not delegated are  
reserved.another and more special provision  
inserted in the Constitution, from abund­  
ant caution, has declared that &quot;the migra­  
tion or importation of such persons as any  
of the States now existing shall think pro­  
per to admit, shall not be prohibited by the  
Congress prior to the year 1808.&quot; That  
this Commonwealth does admit the migra­  
tion of alien friends described as the sub­  
ject of the said Act concerning Aliens; that  
a provision against prolubiting their migra­  
tion, is a provision against all Acts equiva­  
lent thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to  
remove them when migrated is equivalent  
to a prohibition of their migration, and is,  
therefore, contrary to the said provision of  
the Constitution, and void.  
VI. Resolved, That the imprisonment of  
a person under the protection of the laws of  
this Commonwealth, on his failure to obey  
the simple order of the President, to depart  
out of the United States, as is undertaken  
by the said Act entided &quot;An Act concern­  
ing Aliens,&quot; b contrary to the Constitution,  
one amendment in which has provid­  
ed that &quot;no person shall be deprived of lib­  
erty without due process of law,&quot; and, that  
another having provided &quot;that in all crimin­  
al prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the  
right to a public trial by an impartial jury,  
to be informed as to the nature and cause of  
the accusation, to be confronted with wit­  
nesses against him, io have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining witnesses in his favor,  
and to have assistance of counsel for his de­  
fence,&quot; the same Act undertaking to au­  
thorise the President to remove a person  
out of the United States who b under the  
  
protection of the law; on his. own suspicion,  
without jury, without public trial, without  
confrontation of the witnesses against him,  
without having witnesses in his favor, with­  
out defence, without counsel, is contrary to  
these provisions also of the Constitution, is  
therefore sot law but utterly void and of  
so force.  
That transferrin t the power of judging  
  
any person who is under the protection of  
tlie laws, from, the courts to the President  
of the .United States, as is undertaken by  
the same Act concerning Aliens, is against  
the article of the Constitution which pro­  
vides that &quot;the judicial power of the United  
States shall le vested, in the courts, the  
judges of which shall hold their office dur­  
ing good behavior,&quot; and that the s:dd Act  
is void for that reason also; and it is fur­  
ther to be noted that this transfer of judici­  
ary power is to that magistrate of the Gen­  
eral Government who already possesses all  
the executive, and a qualified negative in  
all the legislative powers.  
VII. Resolved, That the construction ap­  
plied by the General Government (as is  
evident by sundry of their proceedings) to  
those parts of the Constitution of the United  
States which delegate to Congress power  
to lay and eollect taxes, duties, imposts, ex­  
cises, to pay the debts, and provide for the  
common defence and general welfare of the  
United Stats, and to make all laws which  
shall be necessary and proper for carrying  
into execution the powers vested by the  
Constitution in the Government of the Uni­  
ted States, or any department thereof, goes  
to the desfruction ofll the limits prescrib­  
ed to their poweTn&amp;y 3 the Constitution:  
That words meant by that instrument to be  
subsidiary only to the execution of the  
limited powers, ought not to be so construed  
as themselves to give unlimited powers,  
nor a part so to be taken as to destroy  
the whole residue of the instrument:  
That the proceedings of the General Gov­  
ernment, under color of those articles, will  
be a fit and necessary subject for revisal  
and correction at a time of greater tranquil­  
ity, w hile those specified in the preceding  
resolutions call for immediate redress.  
VIII. Resolved, That the preceding re­  
solutions be transmitted to the Senators and  
Representatives in Congress from this Com­  
monwealth, who are enjoined to present the  
same to their respective Houses, and to use  
their best endeavors to procure, at the nert  
Fession of Congress, a repeal of the afore­  
said unconstitutional and obnoxious Acts.  
IX. Resolved, lastly, That the Governor  
of this Commonwealth be, and is hereby  
authorised and requested to communicate  
the preceding resolutions to the Legisla­  
tures of the several States, to assure them  
that this Commonwealth considers union for  
special national purposes, and particularly  
for those specified in their late federal com­  
pact, to be friendly to the peace, happiness,  
and prosperity of all the States; that, faith­  
ful to that compact,, according to the plain  
intent and meaning in which it was under­  
stood and acceded to by the several parties,  
it is sincerely anxious for its preservation;  
that it does also believe, that, to take from  
the States all the powers of self-government,  
and transfer them to a general and consolid­  
ated Government, without regard to the  
special government &amp;. reservations solemn­  
ly agreed to in that compact, is not for the  
peace, happiness, or prosperity of these  
States; An4 that, therefore, this Common­  
wealth is determined, ?s it doubts not its co­  
States are, to submit to undelegated &quot;and  
consequently unlimited powers, in no man  
or body of men on earlJt; that if the &#x27;Acts  
before specified should stand, these con­  
clusions would flow from them that the  
General Government &quot;may place any act  
they think proper on the fist of crimes, and  
punish it themselves, whether enumerated  
or not enumerated by the Constitution as  
cognizable by them; that they .may trans­  
fer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who mayt himself be the ac­  
cuser, counsel, judge, and jury, whose sus­  
picions may be the evidence, his order the  
sentence, his officer the executioner, and his  
breast the sole record of the transaction;

ies against Repulican Governments,- and  
new pretexts for those who wish it to be be­  
lieved that man cannot be governed but by  
a rod of iron;, that wculA- b dangerous  
delusion were a confidence in the men of  
our choice to silence our fears for the safety  
of our rights; that confidence is every  
where the parent of despotism; free Govern­  
ment is founded in jealousy, and not in con­  
fidence it is jealousy and not confidence  
which prescribes limited constitutions to  
bind down those whom we are obliged to  
trust with&quot; power; that our Constitution has  
accordingly fixed the limits to which, and  
no farther, our confidence may go; and let  
the honest advocate of confidence read the  
Alien and Sedition Acts, and say if the  
Constitution has not been wise in fixing  
limits to the Government it created, an4  
whether we should be wise in destroying  
those limits? Let him say what the Gov­  
ernment is, if it be not a tyranny, which the  
men of our choice have conferred on the  
President, and the President &quot;of our choice  
has assented to &amp; accepted over the friendly  
strangers to whom the mild spirit of our  
country and its laws had pledged hospitality  
and protection; that the men of our choice  
have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights of inno­  
cence, the claims of justification, the sacred  
force of truth, and the forms and substance  
of law and justice. In questions of power,  
then, let no more be said of confidence in  
man, but bind him down from mischief by  
the chains of the Constitution. That this  
Commonwealth does therefore call os  
its co-States for an expression of thir sen­  
timents on the Ajcts concerning Aliens, and  
  
for the punishment of certain crimes herein  
before specified, plainly declaring whether  
these Aets are or are not authorised by the  
federal compact. And it doubts not  
that their s-ense will be so announced as to prove  
their attachment to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the  
rights and liberties of their co-States will be  
exposed to no dangers by remaining em­  
barked on a common bottom with their own:  
But they will concur with this Common­  
wealth in consiiering tlie said Acts as so  
palpably against the Constitution as to a­  
niount to an undisguised declaration that  
the compact is not meant to be the measure  
of the powers of the General Government,  
but that it will proceed in the exercise over  
these States of all powers whatsoever.  
That they will view this as seizing the rights  
of the States, and consolidating them in  
  
the hands of the General Government, with  
a power assumed to bind the States (not  
merely in cases made federal) but in all  
cases whatsoever, by laws made not with  
their consent, but by others, against their  
consent; that this would be to surrender the  
form of government we have chosen, and  
live under one deriving its powers from its  
own will, and not from our authority; and  
that the co-States recurring to their natural  
rights not made federal, will con­  
cur in declaring these void and of so force,  
and will each unite with this Common­  
wealth in requesting their repeal at the  
next session of Congress

State acceded as a State, and is an integral  
party; that this Government, created by  
this compact, was not made the exclusive or  
final judge of the extent of the powers del­  
egated to itself; since that would have made  
its discretion, and not the Constitution, the  
measure of its powers; but that, as in all  
other cases of compact, among parties hav­  
ing no common judge, EACH PARTY  
HAS AN EQUAL RIGHT TO JUDGE  
FOR ITSELF, AS WELL OF INFRAC­  
TIONS AS OF THE MODE AND  
MEASURE OF REDRESS.  
II. Resolved, That the Constitution of  
the United States having delegated to Con­  
gress a power to punish treason, counter­  
feiting the securities and current coin of the  
United States, piracies and felonies com­  
mitted on the high seas, and offences a­  
gainst the laws of nations, and no other  
crimes whatever, and it being true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and one of the amend­  
ments to the Constitution having also de­  
clared that &quot;the powers not delegated to the  
United States by the Constitution, nor pro­  
hibited by it to the States, are reserved to  
the States respectively, or to the people,&quot;  
therefore, also, the same Act of Ccngress,  
passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and  
entitled &quot;An Act in addition to the Act en­  
titled an Act for the punishment of certain  
crimes against the United States; as, also,  
the Act passed by them on the 27th day of  
June, 1798, entitled &quot;An Act to punish  
frauds committed on the Bank of the United  
States;&quot; (and all other their acts which  
assume to create, define, or punish crimes  
other than those enumerated in the  
Constitution) are altogether void and of no  
force, and that the power to create, define,  
j and punish such other crimes, is reserved,  
and of right appertains solely and exclu­  
sively, to the respective States, each within  
its own territory.  
III. Resolved, That it is true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and is also expressly declar­  
ed by one of the amendments to the Con­  
stitution, that &quot;the powers not delegated to  
the United States by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved  
to the States respectivly, or to the people;&quot;  
and, that no power over the freedom of re­  
ligion, freedom of speech, or freedom of the  
press, being delegated to the United Sfates  
by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to  
the States, all lawful powers respecting the  
same did of riht remain and were reserved  
to the States or to the people; that thus was  
manifested their determination to retain to  
themselves the right of judging how far the  
licentiousness of speech and of the press  
may be abridired without lessening their  
useful freedom, and how far those abuses  
which cannot be separated from their use,  
should be tolerated, rather than the use be  
destroved; &amp; thus also they guarded against  
all abridgement, by the United States, of  
the freedom of religious principles and ex­  
ercises, and retained to themselves the  
right of protecting the same, as this, stated  
by a law passed on the general demand of  
its citizens, had already protected them  
from all human restraint or interference:  
and, that, in addition this general principle  
and express declaration, another and more  
special provision has been made by one of  
the amendments to the Constitution, which  
expressly declares that &quot;Congress shall  
make no laws respecting an establishment  
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise  
thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech,  
or of the press,&quot; thereby guarding, in the  
same sentence, and under the same words,  
the freedom of religion, of speech, and of  
the press, insomuch, that whatever violates  
either, throws down the sanctuary which  
covers the others; and that libels, falsehood,  
and defamation, equally with heresy and  
false religion, are withheld from the cogni­  
zance of Federal tribunals. That there­  
fore the Act of the Congress of the United  
States, passed on the 14th July, 1898, en­  
titled &quot;An Act in addition to the Act en­  
titled an Act, for the punishment of certain  
crimes against the U. States,&quot; which does  
abridge the freedom of the press, is not law,  
but is altogether void and of so force.  
IV. Resolved, That alien friends are  
under the jurisdiction and protection of the  
laws of the State wherein thev are: that  
no power over them has been delegated to  
the United States, nor prohibited to the in  
dividual fc tales distinct trom tneir power  
ovr citizens; and it being true, as a gener­  
al principle, and one of the amendments to  
the Constitution having also declared that  
&quot;the powers not delegated to the United  
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited  
by it to the States, are reserved to the Sta  
tes respectively, or to the people,&quot; the Act  
of the Congress of the United States, pass  
ed the 22d day of June, 1798, entitled &quot;An  
Act concerning Aliens,&quot; which asssumes  
power over alien friends, not delegated by  
the Constitution, is not law, but is alto  
gether void and of no force.  
V. Resolved, That in addition to the  
General principle as well as the express  
eclaration that powers not delegated are  
reserved.another and more special provision  
inserted in the Constitution, from abund  
ant caution, has declared that &quot;the migra­  
tion or importation of such persons as any  
of the States now existing shall think pro­  
per to admit, shall not be prohibited by the  
Congress prior to the year 1808.&quot; That  
this Commonwealth does admit the migra­  
tion of alien friends described as the sub­  
ject of the said Act concerning Aliens; that  
a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion, is. a provision against all Acts equiva­  
lent thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to  
remove them when migrated is equivalent  
to a prohibition of their migration, and is,  
therefore, contrary to the said provision of  
the Constitution, and void.  
VI. Resolved, That the imprisonment of  
a person under the protection of the laws of  
it!. r i.i , m , .  
this Commonwealth, on hi failnrft to nbpv  
the simple order of the President, to depart  
out of the United States, as is undertaken  
  
bj the said Act entitled &quot;An Act concern­  
ing Aliens,&quot; is contrary to the Constitution,  
one amendment in which &#x27; has provid-  
  
ed that &quot;no person shall be deprived of lib  
erty without due process of law,&quot; and, tha  
another having provided &quot;that in all crimin­  
al prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the  
right to a public trial by an impartial jury,  
to be informed as to the nature and cause of  
the accusation, to be confronted with wit­  
nesses against liim, 10 have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining witnesses in his favor,  
and to have assistance of counsel for his de­  
fence,&quot; the same Act undertaking to au­  
thorise the President to remove a person  
out of the United States who is under the  
protection of the law, on his own suspicion,  
without jury, without public trial, without  
confrontation of the witnesses against him,  
without having witnesses in his favor, with  
out defence, without counsel, is contrary to  
these provisions also of the Constitution, is  
therefore not law but utterly void and of  
no force.  
That transferring the power of judging  
any person who is under the protection of  
the laws, from the courts to the President  
of the United States, as is undertaken by  
the same Act concerning Aliens, is against  
the article of the Constitution which pro­  
vides that &quot;the judicial powejrof the United  
States shall be vested in the courts, the  
judges of which shall hold their office dur-  
mggooa Denavior ana mat me saia Act  
is void for that reason also; and it is fur­  
ther to be noted that this transfer of judici­  
ary power is to that magistrate of the Gen­  
eral Government who already possesses all  
the executive, and a qualified negative in  
all the legislative powers.  
VII. Resolved, That the construction ap­  
plied by the General Government (as is  
evident by sundry of their proceedings) to  
those parts of the Constitution of the United  
States which delegate to Congress power  
to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, ex­  
cises, to pay the debts, and provide for the  
common defence and general welfare of the  
United Stats, and to make all laws which  
shall be necessary and proper for carrying  
into execution the powers vested by the  
Constitution in the Government of the Uni­  
ted States, or any department thereof, goes  
to the destruction of all the limits prescrib­  
ed to their power by the Constitution:  
That words meant by that instrument to be  
subsidiary only to the execution of the  
limited powers, ought not to be so construed  
as themselves to give unlimited powers,  
nor a part so to be taken as to destroy  
the whole residue of the instrument:  
That the proceedings of the General Gov­  
ernment, under color of those articles, will  
be a fit and necessary subject for revisal  
and correction at a time of greater tranquil­  
ity, while those specified in the preceding  
resolutions call for immediate redress.  
VIII. Resolved, That the preceding re­  
solutions be transmitted to the Senators and  
Representatives in Congress from this Com­  
monwealth, w ho are enjoined to present the  
same to their respective Houses, and to use  
their best endeavors to procure, at the next  
session of Congress, a repeal of the afore­  
said unconstitutional and obnoxious Acts.  
IX. Resolved, lastly, That the Governor  
of this Commonwealth be, and is hereby  
authorised and requested to communicate  
the preceding resolutions to the Legisla­  
tures of the several States, to assure them  
that this Commonwealth considers union for  
special national purposes, and particularly  
for those specified in their late federal com  
pact, to be friendly to the peace, happiness,  
and prosperity of all the States; that, faith -  
tul to that compact, according to the plain  
intent and meaning in which it was under  
stood and acceded to by the several parties,  
it is sincerely anxious for its preservation;  
that it does also believe, that, to take from  
the States all the powers of self-government.  
and transfer them to a general and consolid­  
ated Government, &#x27; without regard to the  
special government &amp; reservations solemn  
ly agreed to in that compact, is not for the  
peace, happiness, or prosperity of these  
States; And that, therefore, this Common­  
wealth is determined, as it doubts not its co-  
States are, to submit to undelegated and  
consequently unlimited powers, in no man  
or body of men on earth; that if the Acts  
before specified should stand, these con  
elusions would flow from them that the  
General Government may place any act  
they think proper on the list of crimes, and  
punish it themselves, whether enumerated  
or not enumerated by the Constitution as  
cognizable by them; that they may trans  
fer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself be the ac  
cuser, counsel, judge, and jury, whose suss  
picions may be the evidence, his order the  
sentence, his omcer the executioner, and his  
breast the sole record of the transaction;  
that a very numerous and valuable descrip  
tion of the inhabitants of these States, be  
ing by this precedent reduced as outlaws  
to the absolute dominion ot one man, and  
the barriers of the Constitution thus swept  
from us all, no rampart now remains a-  
gainst the passions and the power of a  
majority of Congress, to protect from a like  
exportation or other grievous punishment  
the minority of the same body the Legisla­  
ture, Judges, Governors, and Counsellors  
of the States, nor their other peaceable in­  
habitants who may venture to reclaim the  
constitutional - rights and liberties of the  
States, and people, or who, for other causes,  
good orbadr3Tiay be obnoxious to the view  
or marked by -the suspicions of the Presi­  
dent, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their elections or other interests, public or  
personal; that vhe friendless alien has been  
selected as the safest subject of a first ex­  
periment; but the cidzen will soon follow,  
or rather has already followed; for already  
has a Sedition Act marked him as a prey:  
That these and successive acts of the same  
character, unless arrested on the threshold,  
may tend to drive these States into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish new calum-  
les against Repuhcan Governments, and  
new pretexts for those who wish it to be be­  
lieved that man cannot be governed but by  
a rod of iron; that would be a dangerous  
delusion were a confidence in the men of  
our choice to silence our fears for the safety  
ot our rights; that conhdence is every  
where the parent of despotism; free Uovern  
ment is founded in jealousy, and not in con  
fidence it is lealousy and not confidence  
which prescribes limited constitutions to  
bind down those whom we are obliged to  
trust with power; that our Constitution has  
accordingly fixed the limits to which, and  
no farther, our confidence may go; and let  
the honest advocate of confidence read the  
Alien and Sedition Acts, and say if the  
Constitution has not been wise in fixing  
limits to the Government it created, ana  
whether we should be wise in destroying  
those limits? &#x27; Let bun say what the uov-  
eminent is, if it be not a tyranny, which the  
men of our choice have conferred on the  
  
President, and the President of our choice  
has assented to fe accepted over the friendly  
strangers to whom the mild spirit of our  
country and its laws had pledged hospitality  
and protection; that the men of our choice  
have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights of inno­  
cence, the claims of justification, the sacred  
  
force of truth, and the forms and substance  
of law and justice. In questions of power,  
then, let no more be said of confidence in  
1.,. v: j t: j r : i:.f 1  
man, uiuu uuu uuu irom uuMriijei vy  
the chains of the Constitution. That this  
Commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-States for an expression of their sen­  
timents on the Acts concerning Aliens, and  
for the punishment of certain crimes herein  
before specified, plainly declaring whether  
these Acts are or are not authorised by the  
tederal compact. And it doubts not  
that their sense will be so announced as to prove  
their attachment to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the  
rights and liberties of their co-States will be  
exposed to no dangers by remaining em­  
barked on a common bottom with their own:  
But they will concur with this Common­  
wealth in considering the said Acts as so  
palpably against the Constitution as to a­  
mount to an undisguised declaration that  
the compact is not meant to be the measure  
of the powers of the General Government,  
but that it will proceed in the exercise over  
these States of all powers whatsoever.  
That they will view this as seizing the rights  
of the States, and consolidating them in  
the hands of the General Government, with  
a power assumed to bind the States (not  
merely in cases made federal) but in all  
cases whatsoever, by laws made not with  
their consent, but by others, against their  
consent; that this would be to surrender the  
form of government we have chosen, and  
live under one deriving its powers from its  
own will, and not from our authority; and  
that the co-States recurring to their natural  
rights not made federal, will con­  
cur in declaring these void and of no fokce,  
and will each unite with this Common­  
wealth in requesting their repeal at the  
next session of Congress

delegated powers, its acts are unauthorative, void, i  
and of no force ; that to this compact ea h State  
acceded as a State, and os an integral party ; that ‘  
the Government, created by this compact, was not:  
made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of&#x27;  
the powers delegated to itself j since that would!  
have made its discretion, and not the the Constitu-.

all other cases of compact, arneng parties having j  
no common judge, EACH PARTY- HAS AN  
EQUAL KIGHtl TO JUDGE FOR ITSELF, As  
WELL OF INFRACTION’S AS OF THE MODE  
AND MEASURE OF REDRESS.  
II. Resolved, That the Constitution of the  
United States have delegated to Congrexs apawer  
to punish treason, counterfeiting the securities and  
current com of the l uited States, pi races and  
fellouies committed on the high seas, and ol  
feuces against the laws of nations, and no other  
crimes whatever, it being true, as a gen* ral prin­  
ciple, aud one of tin nmeiidincmls to the U insti­  
tution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are te­  
served to the States respectively, or to the People,&quot;  
therefore, also, the same Act of Congress, passed  
on the 14th. day of July, 17US, and entitled “ An  
Act in addition to the Act entitled an Act lor the  
punishment of certain crimes against the United  
States,” as, also, the Act passed by them on the  
‘J7tli day of June, 179S, entitled&quot; An Act to&#x27;pun­  
ish frauds committed on Die Hank of tlie l uited  
states (and all other of their acts which assume  
to create, define, or punish crime other than those  
enumerated in the Constitution)art ultogetkcr rp»(  
nnil of hi force, and that the power to create,  
define, and-punish such other crimes, is reserved,  
and of right appertains solely ami exclusively, to  
the respective States, each within its own terri  
tory.  
ill. H-wlvcd, That it is tree, as a general prm  
ciple, and is also expressly declared by one of  
the amendments to the Constitution, that ** the  
powers nut delegated to the United States by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited by ilto the States, are  
reserved to the States respectively, or to the Peo­  
ple ;&quot; and that no power over the freedom of re­  
ligion, freedom of speech, or freedom of the press,  
being delegated to the United States, alt lawful  
po.. i re.pi ting the same did of right remain,  
and were reserved to the States or to the People ;  
that thus was manifested their determination tore  
taiti to themselves the ngtlt of judging how far the  
lieeiHioit-ie ss of speech and of the press t .ay be  
abridged with ml t&lt; -oming their us* fill fruxluifi,  
and how far those abuses should b. tolerated,  
rather limit the use be destroyed; and tuns, also,  
lie&#x27;) guarded against alt abridgment, by the United  
States, of the freedom of religions principled and  
exercises, and retained to themselves the right of  
protect n» ipP fame, as this, stated by a law passed  
on the general demand of its cit.zens, had already  
protected them from all human restraint or inter  
t Mice : and, that, in addition to this general and  
express t! i iaraiton, an liter aud more special pro  
Vision has be* u mad* by uiiu of luc aiimuJuaiuix to  
t *,e Cousti! ;*E . which expressly d* uie* that  
1‘ougress shall make op law respecting an estab  
. bshiii nt ot religion, or*, pruiubituig the lice ex* r­  
i r ise ihi-r*•**/, or abridging the- free him or xp-eech,  
i of the press,&quot; thereby guarding, m lie* .-ame sen­  
tence, and under the same words, the treedom of  
I religion, of speech, and of the press, insomuch,  
; that whatever violates either, throws down the  
sanctuary winch cover the others , and that libels.  
* falsehood, and defamation, equally with heresy  
i and false religion, are withheld irom the cogm  
’ in nee of Federal tribunals. That therefore the  
Act of the Congress of the United States, passed  
, on the 14th day of July, 17W, entitled “An Act  
: in addition to the Act entitled an Act for tin&#x27; pun­  
  
khmcat of ffiWII arainvt tlw (!mted  
States.&quot; which- • the Cm &#x27; &#x27;in -&gt;1 &quot;  
press, is not law, but is altogether vo.d and of no  
effect.  
IV&#x27;. K&#x27;vlrfl. That ali&gt; n friends are under the  
jurisdiction and protection of the laus of the  
Slates win-rein they are, that no power over them  
has he*n delegated to th» 1’mted States, nor pro­  
hibited to the individual States distinct fam their  
power over citizens ; and it being true as a general  
principle, ami mo- of the amendments to the Con­  
stitution having aiso declared that “the powers  
not delegated &quot;to the l’niter! States hy the Constitu­  
tion nor p Inbitedbv it to the States, are&#x27;reserved  
to the States re*pecliviey,or to the People,&quot; the Act  
ot Uie Congress of the Cm led Status, passed the  
”?d day of June, 179“, entitled “An Act con­  
cerning Aliens,” which assumes power over alien  
friends, not delegated by the Constitution, u not  
law. but is nltoefWhcr void and of ao firce.  
V. Rrsoter.l, That in addition to t e general  
principle, as well as the express declaration that  
powers not delegated are reserved, another and  
more spe uni piovision inserted in the Constitution,  
from abundant caution, has declared that “the  
migration or importation of such persons as any of  
the State* now existing shall think proper to ad­  
mit, shall not bo prohibited by the Con.resa prior  
to the year IiVih.” That this Commonwealth does  
admit the migration of alien Inends described as  
the subject of the said At t concerning Aliens,  
that a provision against prohibiting t heir migration,  
is a provision against a&#x27;l acts equivalent thereto,  
or it would be nugatory ; that to remove them,  
when migrated, is equivalent to a prohibition of  
&quot;Uieir migration, and is, therefore, -contrary to the  
saul provision of tin Constitution, and tuul.  
VI. Hcji&#x27;iirc/, That, the iinpri-onuien&#x27;. ot a per­  
son under the protection of the laws of this Com­  
monwealth, on lus failure to obey the simple order  
of the President to depart ou&#x27; of the t lilted Stales,  
as is undertaken by the sard Act, entitled “An  
Act coiieernnii&#x27; Aliens,” is e notary to the Consti­  
tution, one amendment m wine h has provided that  
“no persons shall be deprived of liberty without  
due process of law,” and that anoPher having pro­  
vided that, “hi all criminal prosecutions, the ac­  
cused shall enjoy the right to public trial, by an  
impartial jury, to be informed as to the nStaio ami  
cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the  
witue -es against him, to have compulsory process  
f ir&#x27; obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have  
assistance of counsel for his defence,” the same  
Act undertaking to authorize the President to re­  
move a person out of the Cm ted States who is  
under the protection of the law, on his own suspi­  
cion, without jury, without public trial, without  
confrontation of the witnesses against him, with­  
out counsel, is contrary to these provisions, a,so,  
of the Constitution—is, therefore not law, but ut­  
terly void and of no force.  
That transferring the [mjwit of judging any per­  
son who is under the protection of the laws, from  
the i &gt;urts -o the President ot the Cnited States,  
as is undertaken by the same Act concerning  
Aliens, is against the Article of the Constitution  
which provides that “ the Judicial powers of the  
t ruled State* shall be vested in the courts&#x27;, the  
judges of which shall hold their office during good  
behaviour,” and the said Act is Void for that rea­  
son also; and it is further to be noted, that tin*  
transfer of judiciary power is to that magistrate ol  
the General Governnent who already possesses «U  
the Kxecutive, ami a qualified negative iji all the  
  
VII. Nrsshetl, That the construction applied by  
the General government i,as is evinced ’ v sundry  
of their proceedings) to those parts of i. Consti­  
tution of the United States which delegate to Con­  
gress power to lav and collect lutes, to pay the  
debts and provide for the common defence and  
general welfare of the l niled Stales, and to waive  
ail laws which shall be necessary and proper for  
carrying into execution the pmo rs vesieJ by the  
Constitution in the Governm-m&#x27;. of the t:r»ited  
States, or any department thereof, goes to the  
destruction of all the (hints prescribed to ttwur  
power by the Constitution: That words meant by  
that instrument to be subsidiary only to tic* exe­  
cution of the limiter! powers, ought not to be so  
construed as themselves to give unlimited powers,  
nor a purl so to be taken as to destroy the whole  
rc-idtie of the instrument: That the p&#x27;oceoduigs  
orlhe Genera! Government, under color of those  
articles, will be a fit and necessary subject for  
revival and correction at a time of greater tranquility  
while those ape dried in the preceding i ■solutions  
cal! for immediate retires*.  
VIII. Kin&#x27;rr 7, That the preceding resolutions  
Ik&#x27; transmitted to the Senators and Representatives  
in Congress fiyin this Comm mwealth, who are  
i iijouied to present the same to th&#x27; ir respective  
Hon . and to u their best endeavors to procure,  
at the next session of Congress, a repeal of the  
at iressoj urt&quot; institutional and obuoxtous Act.  
IX. RtolerJ, lastly, That the Governor of this  
Commonwealth be, and is hereby, authorized and  
requested to communicate the preceding resolutions  
to th&quot; l.egis ittir -s &gt;f the several States, to assure  
th in that this Commonwealth considers union for  
special n it mna! par poses, and particularly for those  
specified in their late federal compact, to be fneu 1!y  
to the p ace, happiness, and prosperity, of ail the  
States; that, faithful to thatcouipucL according to  
the plain tub ut and in nun,’ m w&#x27;bieh it was  
understood and accede! to by the several parties,  
it is sincerely anxious lot ii ? preservation.- that it  
does als &gt; bcliev. . that, to lak-- from the -States all  
the p iwtrs of .seit government, and transfer them  
to a general and eousolidati l government, without  
regatd to the special delegations and reservations  
soltnnly agreed to in that compact, is not for the  
p -ace, happiness, or prosperity, of these .States;  
au l that, therefore, this Commonwealth is deter  
mine 1, as it doubts not its cu-Statcs are, not tamely  
tosubmit to undelegated and consequently unlimit­  
ed powers, in no man or body of men ou earth: that it  
t e,- Acts before specified should stand, these cou­  
elusi ms would flow from them—that the G neral  
Government may place any act they think propel  
on the list of crimes, and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
Constitution as cognizable by them; that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other.person, who may hiuiself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge, and jury, whose suspu ions may by  
the .evidence, Kis order sentence, his officer the  
executioner, and fas breast th-; so! record of the  
transaction; that a very numerous and valuable­  
description of the inhabitants of these States, being  
by tins precedent, uSluced as outlaws to the ab  
solute dom.ii.on of one man, and the barriers of tin  
Constitution thus swept from us all, no rampar;  
now remains against the passions and the powers  
of a majority of Congress, to protect from a like  
exportation or other grievous punishment the min­

Governors, and Counsellors of the States, nor their  
other peaceable inhabitants, who may venture l&lt;

? tieularly for those specified in the late federal (

that compact, according to the plain intent and  
* meaning in which it was understood and acceded  
to by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for  
*,! its preservation ; that it does also believe, that,  
^ to take from the Stages all the powers of, selfgovernment,  
and transfer them to a general and  
* consolidated government, without regard to the  
special dclegitions and reservations solemnly ,  
,t agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace, j

jr as it doubts not its co States are, tamely to sub- \
&quot; mil to undelegated, and consequently, unlimited  
power t, in no man or body of mennn earth; that, j  
if the nets before specified should stand, these  
I conclusions would flow from them?that the ,  
.jj general government may place any act that they j  
think proper on the !ist of crimes, and punish (  
it themselves, whither enumerated or not by the ,

parties having no common judge, each, farty  
HAS AN EyUAL HIlillT TO JUDOE FOR ITSELF, AS

2. Resolved. That the Constitution of tho  
United 8tates having delegated to Congress a  
power to punish treason, counterfeiting the securities  
and current coin of the United States,  
piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,  
and offences against the laws of nntions, and no  
other crimes whatever; and it being true, as a  
general principle, and one of the amendments to  
the Constitution having also declared that &quot;the  
powers not delegated to tho United Status by  
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, are reserved to the States respectively,  
or to the people therefore, also, the same act  
of Congress, passed on the 14th day of July,  
1798,and entitled &quot;on act in addition to the act  
for the punishment of certain crimes against the  
United Statesas, also, the net passed by them  
on the 27th day of June, 1798, entitled &quot;an act  
to punish frauds committed an the Dank of the  
United States;&quot; (and all other of their acts which  
assume to create, define, or punish crimes other  
than those enumerated in the Constitution) are  
altogether void and of no force; und that the  
power to create, define, and punish such other  
crimes, is reserved, and of right appertains solely  
and exclusively, to the respective States, each  
within its own territory.  
* 3. Resolved, That it is true, as a generul principle,  
and is expressly declared by one of the  
amendments to the Constitution, that &quot;the powers  
not delegated to the United States by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,  
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the  
i ?? ?s ?. ,i?  
  
people; anu, HIUl III) puwoi w*n mo ucruum  
of religion, freedom of speech, or freedom of the  
press, being delegatod to the United States by  
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
StateR, all lawful powers respecting the stune  
did of right remain, and wore reserved to the  
States or to the people; that thus was manifested  
their determination to retain to themselves  
the right of judging how far the licentiousness  
of speech and of the press may be  
abridged without lessening their useful freedom,  
and how far those abuses which cannot be separated  
from their UBe, should be tolerated rather  
than Uie use should be destroyed; and thus,  
also, they guarded against ull abridgment by the  
United States, of the freedom of religious principles  
and exercises, and retained to themselves  
the right of protecting the same, as this, stated  
by a law passed on the general demand of its  
citizens, had already protected them from all human  
restraint or interference: and, that in addition  
to this general principle and express declaration,  
another and more special provision has  
been made by one of the amendments to the  
Constitution, which expressly declares that  
&quot;Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment  
of religion, or prohibiting the free,  
exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of  
speech, or oMle press,&quot; thereby guarding, in the  
same sentence, and under the same words, the  
? ? - - -e u i .rik- .  
  
rreeuoin or reunion, ui sjira u mm &lt;&gt;i uic pn ,  
insomuch, that whatever violates either, throws  
down the snnetuarv which covers the others;  
and that libels, falsehood, and defamation,  
equally with heresy and fulse religion, are withheld  
from the cognizance of federal tribunals.  
That therefore, the act of the Congress of the  
United States, passed on the 14th of July, 1798,  
entitled &quot;an act in addition to the act entitled  
an act for the punishment of- certain crimes  
againat the United States,&quot; which does abridge  
the freedom of the press, is not law, but is altogether  
void and or ?o efeect.  
4. Resolved, That alien friends are under the  
jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the  
State wherein they are ; that no power over them  
ha* been delegated to the United Stales, nor  
prohibited to the individual States disinct from  
their power over citizens; and it being true, a  
a general principle, and one of the amendments  
to the Constitution having also declared that  
&quot;the powers not delegated to the United States  
by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, are reserved to thp States respectively,  
r?r to the people,&quot; the act of the Congress of the  
United States, passed the 22d day of June,  
1798, entitled &quot;an act concerning aliens,&quot; which  
isscmes power over alien friends, not delegated  
by the Constitution, is sot law, but is  
iltogether void and of no force.  
5. Resolved, That in addition to the general  
principle, an well as the eapress declaration that  
powers not delegated are reserved, another and  
more special provision inserted in the Constitution,  
from abundant caution, has declared that  
&quot;the migration or importation of such persons  
as any of the States now existing shall think  
proper to admit, aliall not he prohibited by the  
Congress prior to the year 1808.&quot; That this  
sorarnonwealth does admit the migration of  
alien friends described as the subject of the  
laid act concerning aliens; that a provision I  
tgninat prohibiting their migration, is a provi-1  
don agsinst nil Hcts equivalent thereto, or it |  
would be nugatory ; that to remove them, when  
migrated, is equivalent to a prohibition of their  
migration, and is, therefore, contrary to the said  
provision of the Constitution, and void.  
6. Retolvd, That the imprisonment of a perion  
under the protection of the law s of this commonwealth.  
on hin failure to obey the simple order  
of the President to depart out of the United  
Slates, as is undertaken l&gt;v the said set, entitled  
&quot; An act concerning Aliens,&quot; is contrsry to  
the Constitution, one amendment in which has  
provided that &quot; no person shall he deprived of  
liberty without due process of lsw,&quot; and that  
mother having provided that &quot; in all criminal  
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right  
to a public, trial, by an impartial jury, to be informed  
as to the nature and cause of the nrru  
  
Bfivion, 10 oe roniriuieu whii um wimh&#x27;mw-h  
against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining  
witnesses in his favor, and to have assistance  
of counsel for his defence,&quot; the same act  
undertaking to authorize the President to re  
move a person out of the United States who is  
under the protection of the law, on his rwn suspicion,  
without jury, withont public trial, without  
confrr ntation of the witnesses against him,  
without having witnesses in his favor, without  
defence, without counsel, is contrary to these  
provisions, also, of the Constitution?is therefor#  
iroT i,aw, hut utterly void and or so force.  
That transferring the power of judging any  
person who is under the protection of the laws,  
from the courts to the President of the United  
States, m is undertaken hy the same act concerning  
aliens, is ngnlnet the article of the Con  
atitution which providea that &quot;the Judicial power  
of the United States shall he vested in the  
courts, the judges of which shall hold their office  
during good behavior,&quot; and that the said act  
is void for that reason also ; and it is further to  
he noted, that this transfer of judiciary power  
is to that magistrate of the general government  
who already possesses all the executive,  
and a qualified .negative in all the legislative,  
powers.  
  
I 7. Resolved, That the construction spoiled by  
&#x27;the general government (as is evinced uy sun- |  
| dry of their proceedings) to those parts of the j  
Constitution of the United Stales which dele- I  
gate to Congress power to lay and collect taxes j  
duties, imposts, excises, to pay the debts and ^  
1 provide tor the common defence and genetal i y  
welfure of the United Slates, and to make ull | .j  
laws which shall be necessary and proper for j n  
carrying into execution tlie powers vested by j |  
the Constitution in the government of the United t  
States, or any department thereof, goes to the (  
destruction of all the limits prescribed to their j  
power by the Constitutiuu : That words mount M  
by that instrument to be subsidiary only to the v  
execution of the limited powers, ought not to  
i he so construed as themselves to give unlimited t  
| powers, nor a purt so to be taken as to destroy ^  
j the whole residue of the instrument: That the  
j proceedings of the general government, under (j  
&#x27; color of these articles, will be a tit and necesi  
sury subject for revinal and correction at a lime j  
I of creator traiiuuililv. while those specified in ,  
  
the preceding resolutions call for immediate re- &#x27;u  
l ess.  
8. Resolved, That the preceding resolutions  
he transmitted to the senators and representatives  
in Congress from this commonwealth, who  
s e enjoined to present the same to their re pecjve  
houses, and to use their host endeavors to  
procure, at the next session of Congress u repeal  
of the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious  
acts.  
9. Resolved, lastly, That the governor of this  
commonwealth be, und is hereby, authorized and  
quested to communicate the proceeding resolutions  
to the legislatures of the several States,  
t &gt; assure them that this commonwealth considers  
union for speciul national purposes, and particularly  
for those specified in the late feder; 1  
compact, to be friendly to the pe e, happiness,  
and prosperity of ull the States ; that, faithful to  
that compact, according to the plain intent and  
meaning in which it was understood and acceded

delusion were a confidence in the men of *  
our choice to silence our fears for the safety of v  
our rights; that confidence is everywhere the  
parent of despotism?free government is founded  
in jealousy, and not in confidence: itisjealousy,  
and not confidence, which prescribes lim- t)  
ited constitutions to bitid down those whom we c)  
are obliged to trust with power; that our Consti- j  
tution has, accordingly, fixed the limits to which, ^  
and no farther, our confidence may go; and let  
the honest advocate of confidence read the alien  
and sedition acts, and say if the Constitution has  
not been wise in fixing limits to the government  
it created, and whether we should be wise in destroying  
those limits 1 j  
Let him say what the government is, if it be n  
not a tyranny, which the men of our choice jr  
have conferred on the President, and the president  
of our choice has assented to and accepted, y  
over the friendly strangers to whom the mild n|  
spirit of our country and its laws had pledged j)(  
hospitality and protection ; that the men of our e,

of the President than the solid rights of inno- B]  
cence, the claims of justification, the sacred i  
  
force of truth, and the forms and substances of | .  
law and justice. In questions of power, then, ^  
let no more be said of confidence in man, but rt  
bind him down from mischief, by the chains of ff  
the Constitution. That this commonwealth

concerning aliens, and for the punishment of &#x27;  
certain crimes herein before specified?plainly j*  
declaring whether these acts are or are not au p  
thorizcd by the federal compact. And it doubts  
not that their sense will be so announced as to  
prove their attachment to limited goverment; j,  
whether general or particular, and that the ^  
rights and liberties of their eo.Stntes will be ex- j  
posed to no dangers by remaining embarked on w  
a common bottom with their own | but they  
will concur with this commonwealth in considering  
the said acts as so palpably against tl ^  
Constitution as to amount to nn undisguised  
declaration that the compact is not meant to be ^  
the measure of the powers of the genera&#x27;  
government, but that It will proceed in the e ^  
ercise, over these States, of all powers whats.  
ever. That they will view this as seixing the  
rights of the States, and consolidating them in ^  
the hnnds of the general government, with a |  
power assumed to bind the States, (not merely ,,  
in cases mnda federal, hut in all cases whatsoever,)

by others, against their consent, that this would ^  
be to surrender the. form of government we

s acts are un­  
authoritative, vold, and of no force; that  
to this compact each State acceded as a  
State, and as an integral party; that this  
Government, created by this compact, was  
not made the exclusive or final judge of the  
extent of the powers delegated to itself;  
since that would have made its discretior  
 and not the Constitution, the theasure of  
its powers; but that, as in all other cases  
of compact, among parties having no com­  
mon judge, each party has an egual right  
to judge for itselt, as well of tafructions as  
of the mode and measure of redress.  
I. Resolred, That the tonstitution of  
the United States having delegated to Con­  
gress a power to punish treason, counter­  
feiting the coin of the United States, pirs­  
cies and felonies com nitted on the high  
seas, and offences against the laws of us  
tions, and no other crimes whatever, and it  
being true, as a general principle, and one  
of the amendments to the tonstitution hav­  
ing also declared that &quot;the powers not del.  
egated to the United States by the Consti.  
tution, nor prohibited by it to the States,  
are reseived to the States te pectively, or  
to the People,&quot; therefore, also, the same  
Act of Congress, passed on the 14th day  
July, 1798, and entitled &quot;An Act in addi  
tion to the Act entitled an Act for the pun  
ishment of certain crimes against the United  
States;&quot; as, also, the Act passed by them  
on the 27th day of June, 1798, entitled  
&quot;An Act to punish frauds conmitted on  
the Hank of the United States;&quot; (and all  
other their acts which assume to create,  
define, or punish crimes other than those  
enumerated in the Constitution) are alto  
gether coid and of no force, and that the  
power to create, define, and punish such  
other crimes, is reserved, and of right ap  
pertains solely and exclusively, to the res  
pective States, ench within its own terrii­  
  
ill. Resolred, That it is true, as a gen-  
 eral principle, and is also expressly de­  
clared by one of the amendments to the  
Constitution, that &quot;the powers not delega­  
ted to the United States by the Constitn­  
tion, nor prohibited by it to the State, are  
reserved to the States respectively, or to  
the People;&quot; and, that no power over free  
dom of religion, freedom of speech, or  
freedom of the press, being delegated to  
the United States by the Coustitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the States, all lawful  
powers respecting the same did of right re  
main, and were reserved to the States or  
  
to the People, that thus was manlleated  
their determinaiion to retain to themselves  
the right of judging how far the  
ness of speech and of the press may be  
abridged withont lessening their useful  
freedom, and how far those abuses which  
cannot he separated from their use, should  
Le tolerated, rather than the use be des­  
troyed; and thus, also, they guarded against  
all abridgment, by the United States, of  
the lreedom of religious principles and ex  
ercises, and retained to themselves the  
right of protecting the same, as this, stated  
by a law passed on the general temand of  
its citizens, had already protected them  
from all human restraint or interference;  
and, tunt, in addition to this general prin­  
ciple and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made by  
one of the amendments to the Constitution,  
which expreasly declares that &quot;Congseas  
shall make no laws respecting an establish  
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free ex  
ercise thereol, or abridging the freedom of  
speech, or of the press,&quot; thereby guarding.  
in the same sentence, and under the anme  
words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, insomuch, that whatever  
violates either, throws down the sanctuary  
which covers the others; and that libels,  
falschood, and defamation, equally with  
heresy and false religion, are withheld from  
the cognizance of Pederal tribumils. That  
therefore the Act of the Congress of the  
United States, passed on the 14th of July,  
1298, eutitled &quot;An Act in addition to the  
Act eutitled an Aet for the punishment of  
certain crimes agninat the United State.&quot;  
which does abridge the freedom of the  
preas, is Nor Law, but is altogether vord  
 and of No arrect.  
IY. Resolred, That alien friends are  
under the jurisdiction and protection of the  
lawa of the State wherein they are; that  
no poawer over them has been delegated to  
the United States, nor prohihited to the in­  
dividual States distinct from their power  
over citizens; and it being true, as a gen  
eral principle, and one of the ameudient,  
to the Constitution having also declared  
 that &quot;the powers not delegated to the Uni­  
ted States by the Constitution, nor prohih­  
ited by it to the States, are reserved to the  
States respectively, or to the People, the  
Aet of the Cungress of the United States,  
e a  
passed the 22d day of June, 1798, entitled  
.An Aet conceruing Aliens,&quot; which as­  
es power over alien triende, not delegs­  
ted by the Constitution, is wor naw but is  
altogether voip and of wo rorce.  
V. Resolved, That in addition to the  
general priuciple, as well as the exprees  
declaratiou that powers not delegated are  
reserved, another and more special provis  
ton inserted in the Constitution, from aben­  
dant castiot, has declared that &quot;the ml  
gration or importatlen of auch pereous at  
any of the States now exlating shall think  
proper to admit, chall not be prolitiited hy  
the Congress prior to the year 1806. That  
this Commonwealth doee admit the migrs  
tion of alien frtends doseribed as the sub  
jeet of the sald Aet concerning Allens; that  
a provialon againet prohibiting thele taly  
thon, is a pcavision against all oss e  
et!  
  
to remove them, when migrated, is equivs  
lent to a prohibition of their migration, and  
is, therefore, contrary to the sald provisios  
of the Constitution and roid,  
Vi. Resolred, That the imprisonmen  
of a person tinder the protection of the  
laws of this Commonwealth, on his failure  
 to obey the simple order of the presiden  
to depart out of the United States, as it  
undertaken by the said Act, entitled &quot;An  
Act concerning Aliens,&quot; is contrary to the  
 Constitution, one amendment in which hat  
provided that &quot;no person shall be deprived  
of liberty without due process of law;&quot;  
and that another having provided that, &quot;in  
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall  
enjoy the right to a public trial, by an im­  
partial jury, to be informed as to the nature  
and eause of the accusation, to be con­  
fronted with the witnesses against him, to  
have compulsory process for obtaining wit­  
nesses in his favor, and to have assistance  
of counsel for his defence,&quot; the same Act  
undertaking to authorize the President to  
remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection of the law, on  
his own suspicion, without jury, without  
public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without having wit­  
nesses in his favor, without defence, with  
out counsel, is contrary to these provisions,  
also, of the Constitution--is, therefore,  
Nor law, but utterly vorn and of No  
yONCS..  
That transferring the power of judging any  
person who is under the protection of the  
laws, from the courts to the President of  
the United States, as is undertaken by the  
same Act concerning Aliens, is against the  
Article of the Constitution which provides  
that &quot;the Judicial power of the United  
States shall be vested in the courts, the  
judges of which shalf hold their office du  
ring good behaviour,&quot; and that the said  
Act is void for that reason also; and it is  
further to be noted, that this transfer of ju­  
diciary power is to that magistrate of the  
General Government who already po-seases  
all the Executive, and a qualified negative  
in all the Legislative powers.  
VI. Sesoleed, That the construction  
applied by the General Government tas is  
evinced by sundry of their roceedings) to  
these parts of the Constitution of the Uni­  
ted States which delegate to Congress power  
to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,  
excises, to pay the debts and provide for  
the common defence and general welfare  
of the United States, and to make all laws  
which shall be necessary and proper for  
carrying into execution the powers vested  
by the Constitution in the Government of  
the United States, or any department there­  
of, goes to the destruction of all the limits  
prescribed to their power by the Constitu  
tion: That words meant by that instrument  
to be subsidiary only to the execution of  
the limited powers, ought not to be so con-  
  
ers, nor a part so to be taken as to destroy  
the whole residue of the instrument: That  
the proceedings of the General Govern.  
ment, under color of those articles, will be  
a fit and necessary subject for revisal and  
correction at a time of greater tranquillity,  
while those specified in the preceding res  
olutions call for immediate redress.  
VIll. Resolced, That the preceding res­  
olutions be transmitted to the Senators and  
Representatives in Congress from this Com­  
monwealth, who are enjoined to present the  
same to their respective Houses, and to use  
their best endeavors to procure, at the next  
sesasion of Congress, a repeal of the afore­  
said unconstitutional and obtoxious Acts.  
  
A. Sesolred, tastty, I hat the overnor  
of this Commonwealth be, and is hereby,  
anthorized and requested to communicate  
the preceding resofutions to the legialatures  
of the several States, to assure them that  
this Commonwealth considers union for  
national purposes, and particularly  
for those specified in their late federal com  
pact, to be triendly to the peace, happiness,  
and prosperity, of all the States; that,  
faithtul to that compact, according to the  
plain intent and meaning in which it was  
understood and acceded to by the several  
parties, it is sincerely anxious for its pres  
ervation; that it does also believe, that, to  
take from the States all the powers of self  
government, and transfer them to a general  
and consolidated government, without re­  
gard to the special delegations and reserva­  
tions solemoly agreed to in that compact,  
is not for the peace, happiness, or prosper­  
ity, of these States; and that, therefore,  
this Commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-States are, tamely to sub  
mif to undeleguted, and consequently un-  
limited powers, tn no man or body of mes  
on cartá; that, it the teta before specified  
should stand, thene conelasions would flow  
from them--that the General Government  
may place any act they think proper on the  
list of crimes, and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by  
the Constitution as cognizaide by them;  
that they may transfer its cognizance to the  
President or any other person, who may  
himsel, be the aecuser, counsel, judge, and  
jury, whose suspicions may be the evidence,  
his order the sentence, his officer the execu  
tioner, and his breast the sole tecord of the  
transaction; that a very uumerous and val­  
unble deseription of the inhabitants of these  
States being by this precedent reduced as  
outlaws to the abeolute dominion of one  
man, and the barriers of the Constitation  
thus swept from us all, no rampart now re­  
mains againat the paccions and the powers  
of a majority of Congrosa, to protect from  
a like exportation or other grievous panish­  
ment the minjurity of the anme body, the  
Legialatures, Judges, Governors, and Coun  
sellors of the States, tior their other peace  
 able tuhabitants, who say venture to re  
claim the conatitutioual sights and libertiet  
of the States and Peogle, or who, for othet  
causes, good or had, may be obnoxious to

 foars for the safety of our righte; that cos  
ine i eer wher the arent of espo  
tim--free government is fouuded in jesl  
ousy, and not in confleence: It is jealousy  
and not confidence, which proscribes lim  
e contitton to tin o to o  
we are obliged to trust with power; tha  
our Constitation has, accordingly, fixed the  
 limits to which, and no farther, our confl  
dence may go; and let the honost advocate  
 of confidence read the Alien and Sedition  
Acts, and say if the Constitution has not  
been wise in fixing limits to the Goverment  
it created, and whether we should be wise  
 in destroying those limits? Let him say  
 what the Government is, if it be not a  
tyranny, which the men of our choice have  
conferred on the President, and the Pres­  
ident of our cholce has assented to and  
accepted, over the friendly strangers to  
whom the mild spirit of our country and its  
laws had pledged hospitality and protection;  
that the mhen of our choice have more res  
 pected the bare suspicions of the President  
than the solid rights of innocence, the  
claims of justifleation, the sacred force of  
truth, and the forms and substance of law  
and justice. In questions of power, then,  
 let no more be said of confidence in man,  
 but bind him down from mischief, by the  
chains of the Constitution. That this com­  
monwealth does therefore call on its co-  
States for an expression of their sentiments  
on the Acts concerning Aliens and for the  
 punishment of certain crimes herein before  
specified--plainly declaring whether these  
Acts are or are not authorized by the Fed  
eral Compact. And it doubts not that their  
sense will be so announced as to prove  
their attachment to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the  
rights and liberties of their co-States will  
be exposed to no dangers by remaining etst­  
barked on a commion bottom with their own;  
but they will concur with this Common­  
weslth in considering the said Acts as so  
palpably against the Constitution as to  
 amount to an undisguised declaration that  
the compact is not meant to be the messure  
of the powers of the General Government,  
but that it will proceed in the exercise, over  
these States, of all powers whatsoever.  
That they will view this as seizing the rights  
of the States, and consolidating them in the  
hands of the General Government, witn a  
 power assumed to bind the States, (not  
merely in cases made federal, hut in all cases  
whatsoever,) by laws made, not with their  
 consent; that this would be to surrender  
the form of Government we have chosen,  
and live under one deriving its powers from  
its own will, and not from our authority;  
and that the co-States, recurring to their  
natural rights in cases not mado federal,  
will concur in declaring these Acts void and  
of no force, and will each unite with this  
Commonwealth in requesting their repeal  
at the next session of Congreas

The second of those celebrated resolutions is in these  
words:  
&quot;Resolved, That the Constitution of the United States  
having delegated to Congress ? power to punish treason,  
counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the Unit­  
ed States, piracies and felonies Committed on the high  
seas, and qffences against the laws of nations, and no  
other crimes whattver, and it being true as a general prin­  
ciple, and one of the amendments to the Constitution  
having also deolared, &#x27; that the powers not delegated to  
the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by  
it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,  
or to the people therefore, also, the same act of Con­  
gress, passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and entitled  
&#x27; An act in addition to an act entitled an act for the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United States;&#x27; as  
?also the act passed by thim on the 27th day of June, 1798,  
entitled ?An act to punish frauds committed on the Bank  
of the United States,&#x27; (and all other their acts which assume  
to create, define, or punish crimes other than those enu­

force; and that the power to create, define, and punish  
such other crimes is reserved, and of right appertains,  
solely and exclusively to the respective States, each within  
its own territory.&quot;  
This resolution, (says the Advocate,) which is expressly  
and by name endorsed by the Democratic Convention, de­  
clares the fugitive slave law to be &quot; altogether void and of no  
force,&quot; because the crimes which it 44 creates, defines, and

one of the amendments to the  
onstituttion, that I the powers not dehgse

recdom of the press, being delegated to  
States hy  
prohibited by it to the States, all lawful  
powers respecting the same did of richt re  
main, and were reserved to the  
cople; that thus was manlested

abridged without lessening their useful  
and how far those abuses  
cannot he separated from their use should

troyed; and thus, also, they  
all abridgement, by the United States, of  
freedom of religious principles and ex  
ercises, and retained to themselves the  
right of  
y a law passed on the general demand of  
its cittrens had alrendy protected o  
from all human restraint or interference  
and, that, in addition to this general  
ciple and express declaration, another and  
pecial provision has been made by  
the amendments to the Cor  
declares that  
shall make bo laws respecting an establish  
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free  
ercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of  
speech, or of the press,&quot; thereby guarding  
the same sentence, and under the same  
words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, insomuch, that whatever  
violates either, throws down the sanctuary  
covers the others; and that lbels  
I, and defamation, equally  
heresy and false religion, are withheld from  
the cognizance of Federal tribunals. That  
therefore the Act of the Congress of the  
United States, passed on the 1 4th of July  
198, entitled &quot;An Ac! in addition to the  
tct entitled an Aet for the punishment of  
certain crimes against the I nited States,&quot;  
which does abridge the freedom of the  
is Nor taw, but is altogether  
and of xo EereCd.  
  
Y. Revolred, That alien friends are  
under the jurisdiction and protection of the  
laws of the State wherein they are: that  
no power over them has been delegated to  
the United States, nor prohibited to the in  
dividual States distinct from their power  
over citizens; and it being true, as a gen  
eral principle, and one of the amendments  
to the Constitution having also declared  
that &quot;the powers not delegated to the Un  
ted States by the Constitution, nor prohth  
ited by it to the States, are reserved to the  
States respectively, or to the People,&quot; the  
tct of the Congress of the United States,  
passed the 22d day of June, 1798, entitled  
&quot;An Act concerning Ahens,&quot; which as  
sumes power over alien friends, not delegs­  
ted by the Constitution, is xor nov but&#x27;s  
altogether vorn and of No rokel  
Y. Resotned, That in addition to the  
general principle, as well as the express  
declaration that powers not delegated are  
reserved, another and more special provis  
ion inserted in the Constitution from abun­  
dant caution, has declared that &quot;the mi  
gration or importation of such persons as  
any of the States now existing shall think  
proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by  
the Congreas prior to the year 1808.&quot; That  
this Commonwealth does admit the migrs  
tion of alien friends described as the sub  
ject of the said tet concerning Aliens; that  
a provision againat prohibiting their migra  
tion, is a provision against all acts equiva­  
lent thereto, or it would be nugatory; that  
  
to remove them, when emigrated, is equivs  
lent to a prohibition of their migration, and  
is, therefore, contrary to the said provision  
of the Constitution and cotd.  
V1. Resolved, That the imprisonment  
of a person under the protection of the  
laes of this Commonwealth, on his failure  
to obey the simple order of the President  
to depart out of the United States, as is  
 undertaken by the said Act, entitled &quot;An  
Act concerning Aliens,&quot; is contrary to the  
Constitution, one amendment in which has  
provided that &quot;no person shall be deprived  
of liberty without due process of law;&quot;  
and that another having provided that, &quot;in  
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall  
enjoy the right to a pablic trial by an im  
partial jury, to be informed as to the nature  
and cause of the accusation, to be con­  
fronted with the witnesses against him, to  
have compulsory process for obtaining wit  
nesses in his favor, and to have assistance  
of counsel for his defence,&quot; the same Act  
undertaking to authorize the President to  
remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection of the law, on  
his own suspicion, without jury, without  
public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without having wit  
nesses in his favor, without defence, with.  
out counsel, is contrary to these provisions,  
also, of the Constitution,-is, therefore,  
Nor law, but utterly voin and of no  
  
O.  
That transferring the power of judging  
any person who is under the protection of  
 the laws, from the courts to the President of  
the United States, as is undertaken by the  
same Act concerning Aliens, is against the  
Article of the Constitution which provides  
that &quot;the Judicial power of the United  
States shall be vested in the courts, the  
judges of which shall hold their office du­  
ring good behaviour,&quot; and that the sald  
Act is void for that reason also; and it is  
further to be noted, that this transfer of jus  
diciary power is to that magistrate of the  
General Government who already possesses  
all the Executive, and a qualified negative  
in all the Legislative powers.  
VIl. Resolred, That the construction  
applied by the General Government ths is  
evinced by sundry of their proceedings) to  
those parts of the Constitution of the Um­  
ted States which delegate to Congress power  
to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,  
excises, to pay the debts and provide for  
the conmon defence and general welfare  
of the United States, and to make all laws  
 which shall be necessary and proper for  
carrying into execution the powers vested  
 by the Constitution in the Government of  
the United States, or any department there  
of, goes to the destruction of all the limits  
prescribed to their power by the Constitn  
tion: That words meant by that instrument  
to be subsidiary ouly to the execution of  
 the limited powers, ought not to be so con­  
 strued as themselves to give unlimited pow  
ers nor a part so to be taken as to destroy  
the whole residue of the instrument; Ihat  
the proceedings of the General Govern  
ment, under color of those articles, will be  
a fit and necessary subject for revisal and  
correction at a time of greater tranquiility,  
while those specified in the preceding res-  
olutions call tor immediate redress.  
VIll Resolred, That the preceding res  
olutions be transmitted to the Senators and  
Representaves in Congress from this Com  
monwealth, who are enjoined to present the  
same to their respective Houses, and to ust  
their best endeavors to procure, at the  
next session of Congress, a repeal of the  
foresaid unconstitutional and obnoxious  
cts  
tA. Resoleed, lastly, That the Governor  
 of this Common wealth be, and is hereby,  
 anthorized and requested to communicate  
 the preceding resolutions to the legislatures  
of the several tates, to assure them that  
this Commonwealth considers union for  
special national purposes, and particularly  
for those specified in their late federal com  
pact, to be friendly to the peace, happiness,  
and prosperity, of all the States; that,  
faithful to that compact, according to the  
plain intent and meaning in which it was  
understood and acceded to by the several  
 parties, it is sincerely anxious for its pres  
ervation; that it does also believe, that, to  
take from the States all powers of self  
Government, and transfer them to a general  
and consolidated Government, without re  
gard to the spectal delegations and reserva  
tions solemnly agreed to in that compact,  
is not for the peace, happineas, or prosper  
ity of these States; and that, therefore,  
this Commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its coStates are, tamely to enb  
mit to undelegated, and consequently un  
limited powers, in no man or body of men  
on earth; that, if the Acts before specified  
should stand, these conclusions would flow  
fron them--that the General Government  
n a place any act they think proper on the  
list of crimes, and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by  
the Constitution as cognizable by them;  
that they may transfer its cognizance to the  
President or any other person, who may  
hims if be the accuser, counsel, judge, and  
jury, whose suspicions may be the evidence,  
his order the sentence, his officer the execu  
tiones, and his breast the sole record of the  
transaction; that a very numerous and val  
nable description of the inhabitants of these  
States being by this precedent reduced as  
outlaws to the absolute dominion of one  
  
man, and the barriers of the Constitution  
thus swept from un all, no rampart now re  
mains agsinst the passions and the powers  
of a majorite of Congress, to protect from  
a like exportation or othenglevons punish  
ment the majority of the same body, the  
Legislatures, Judges, Governors, and Coun  
sellors of the States, nor their other pea  
able inhabitants, who may venture to res  
claim the Constitutional rights and liberties  
of the States and People, or who, for other  
causes, good or bad, may be obnoxious to  
the view, or marked by the suspicions of  
the President, or to be thought dangerous  
to his or their elections, or other intert  
public or personal that the friendless Alien  
has been selectad as the safest subject of  
a first experiment; but the citizen will soon  
follow, or, ratl er, has already followed, for  
already has a Sedition Act marked him  
a prey, that these and successive acts of  
the same character, unless arrested on the  
threshold, may tend to drive these States  
into revolution and blood, and will furnish  
new calumnies against Republican Govern­  
ments, and new pretexts for those who wish  
it to he believed that man cannot be gov  
erned but by a rod of iron; that it would  
be a dangerous delusion were a connidence  
  
in the men of our choice to silence our  
fears for the safety of our rights; that con  
fidence is every where the parent of despo  
tism--free Government is founded in jeal  
ousy, and not in confidence; it is jealousy  
and not confidence, which prescribes limit  
ed constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to trust with power; that  
our Constitution has, accordingly, fixed the  
limits to which, and no farther, our confl­  
dence may go; and let the honest advocate  
of confidence read the Alien and Sedition  
Acts, and say if the Constitution has not  
been wise in fixing limits to the Government  
it created, and whether we should be wise  
in destroying those limits? Let him say  
what the Government is, if it be not a  
tyranay, which the men of our choice have  
conferred on the President, and the Presi  
dent of our choice has assented to and  
accepted, over the friendly strangers to  
whom the mild spirit of our country and its  
laws had pledged hospitality and protection;  
that the men of our choice have more res­  
pected the bare suspicions of the President  
than the sold rights of innocence, the  
claims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the forms and substance of law  
and justice. In questions of power, then,  
let no more be said of confidence in man,  
but bind him down from mischief, by the­  
chains of the Constitution. That this com  
monwealth does therefore call on its co  
States for an expression of their sentiments  
on the Acts concerning Aliens and for the  
punishment of certain crimes herein before  
specified--plainly declaring whether these  
Acts are or are not authorized by the Fed  
 era! Compact. And it doubts not that their  
  
sense will be so announced as to prove  
their attachment to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the  
rights and liberties of their co States will  
exposed to no dangers by remaining em­  
barked on a comitnon bottom with their own;  
but they will concur with this Common­  
wealth in considering the said Acts as so  
palpably against the Constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that  
the compact is not meant to be the measure  
of the powers of the General Government,  
but that it will proceed in the exercise, over  
these States, of all powers whatsoever.  
Ihat they will view this as seizing the rights  
of the States and consolidating them in the  
hands of the General Government, with a  
power assumed to bind the States, (not  
merely in cases made federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever,) by laws made, not with their  
consent; that this would be to surrener  
the form of Government we have chosen,  
and live under one deriving its powers from  
its own will, and not from our authority;  
and that the co States, recurring to their  
natural rights in cases not made federal,  
will concur in declaring these Aets void and  
of no force, and will each unite with this  
Comnonwealth requesting their repeal at  
the next session of Congrea

Bible. But the introduction of the Kentucky 1  
Resolutions into it changes the character of the Re-!  
solve, and stamps it as a deliberate attempt to en.  
courage resistance to the laws of the country.  
The second of the Kentucky Resolutions is iu the  
j following words :  
i &quot; Resolved, That the Constitution of the United States  
| having delegated to Congress a power to punish treason,  
counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the Unit­  
I ed States, piracies and felonies committed on the high  
seuo, ana om?&gt;.??. neainst the laws of nations, and no  
1 other crimes whatever; and it being true as a general  
I principle, and one of the amendments to the Constitution  
1 having also declared, &#x27; that the powers not delegated to  
the Unite&lt;i States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by  
j it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or  
&#x27; to the people therefore, also, the same act of Congress,  
i passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and entitled &#x27; an  
| act iu addition to the net entitled an ^ct for the punish­  
1 meut of certain crimes against the United States,&#x27; as al­  
I so the act passed by them on the 27th day of June, 1798,  
entitled &#x27; an act to punish frauds committed on the Bank  
i of the United States,&#x27; (and all other their acts which assume  
&#x27; to create, define, or punish crimes other than those enumerated  
in the Constitution,) abe altogether void, and of no force,  
i and that the power to create, define, and punish such other  
crimes is reserved, and of right appertains, solely and ex­  
I clusively, to the respective States, each within its own  
territory.&quot;  
The carrying out of the principle of this Resolu­  
tion would, as every intelligent reader will per­  
ceive, strike at the root of nearly all the penal en­  
actments made by Congress since the beginuing of  
the Government. The proposition of the Ken­

gated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void,  
and of no force; that to this compact each j  
Stete acceded as a State, and as an integral  
party; that this government, created by this  
compact, was not made the exclusive or final  
judge of the extent sif the powers delegated !  
to itself; since that would ha^e made its dis- !  
cretion, and not the constitution, the measure :

compact among parties having no common  
judge, EACH PARTY HAS AN EQUAL I  
EIGHT TO JUDGE FOR ITSELF, AS:  
WELL OF INFRACTIONS AS OF THE  
MODE AND MEASURE OF REDRESS.  
II. Resolved, That the constitution of the  
United States having delegated to Congress  
the power to punish treason, counterfeiting the  
securities and current coin of the United  
States, piracies and felonies committed on the  
high seas, and otfences against the laws of na- \
tions, and no other crimes whatever, and it be­  
ing true, as a general principle, and one of the &#x27;  
amendments to the constitution having also  
declared that “ the powers not delegated to the .  
United States by the constitution, nor prohibi­  
ted by it to the States, are reserved to the i  
States respectively, or to the people,” there­  
fore, also, the same act of Congress, passed on !  
the 14th day of July, 1798, and entitled, “An  
act in addition to the act entitled an act for the  
punishment of certain crimes against the United  
States;” as also, the act passed by them on the  
27th aay of June, 1798, entitle!!, “ An act to  
punish frauds committed on the Bank of the  
United States;” (and all other of their acts  
which assume to create, define or punish crimes  
other than those enumerated in the constitu­  
tion) are altogether void, and of no force, and  
that the power to create, define and punish j  
such other crimes, is reserved, and of right an­  
pertains solely and exclusively, to the respec­  
tive States, each within its own territory.  
III. Resolved, That it is true, as a general  
principle, and is also expressly declared by one  
of the amendments to the constitution, that the i  
“ powers not delegated to the United States by  
the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, are reserved to the States respectively,  
or the people;” and that no power over the  
freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or  
freedom of the press, being delegated to the j  
United States by the constitution, nor prohibi­  
ted by it to the States, all lawful powers re­  
specting the same, did of right remain and j  
were reserved 1o the States or to the people; 1  
and thus was manifested their determination  
to retain to themselves the right of judging how  
far the licentiousness of speech and of the press  
may be abridged without lessening their useful  
freedom, and how far those abuses which  
cannot be separated from their use, should be  
tolerated, rather than the use be destroyed;  
and thus, also, they guarded agaiust all  
abridgment, by the United States, of the free­  
dom of religious principles and exercises, and  
retained to themselves the right, of protecting i  
the same, as this, suited by a law passed on  
the general demand of its citizens, had already­  
protected them from all human restraint or in­  
terference; and that, in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more especial provision has been made by one  
of the amendments to the constitution, which  
expressly declares that “Congress shall make  
no laws respecting an establishment of religion  
or prohibiting the free excercise thereof, or  
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the  
press,” thereby guardiug, in the same sentence I  
and under the same words, the freedom of  
speech, of religion, and of the press, insomuch  
  
that whatever violates either, throws down the  
sanctuary which covers the others; and that  
libels, falsehood, and defamation, equally with  
heresy and false religion, are withheld from  
the cognizance of federal tribunals. That,  
therefore, the act of the Congress of the Uni­  
ted States, passed on the 14th of July, 1798,  
entitled “ An act in addition to the act entitled  
an act for the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United States,” which does abrige  
the freedom of the press, is not law, but is  
altogether void and of no force.  
IV. Resolved, That alien friends are under the  
protection and jurisdiction of the laws of the  
State wherein they are; that no power over  
them has been delegated to the United States,  
nor prohibited to the individual States distinct  
from their power over citizens; and it being true  
as a general principle, and one of the amend­  
ments to the constitution, having also declared  
that “the powers not delegated to the United  
Suites by the constitution, or prohibited by it  
to the States, are reserved to the States respec­  
tive! v, or to the people,” the act of the Con­  
gress&#x27;of the United States, passed the 22d day  
of June. 1798, entitled “An act concerning  
aliens,” which assumes power over alien friends  
not delegated by the constitution, is not law,  
but is altogether void and of NO force.  
V. Resdved, That in addition to the gene­  
ral princple as well as the express declaration  
that powers not delegated are reserved, another  
and more special provision inferred in the con­  
stitution, from abundant caution, has declared  
that “ the migration or importation of such  
persons as any of the States now existing shall  
think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited  
by the Congress prior to the year 1808.”—  
That this Commonwealth does admit the mi­  
gration of alien friends described as the subject  
of the said act concerning aliens; that a provi­  
sion against prohibiting their migration is a pro­  
vision against all acts equivalent thereto, or it  
would be nugatory; that to remove them when  
migrated is equivalent to a prohibition of their  
migration, and is, therefore, contrary to the  
said provision of the constitution, and vend.  
  
VI. Resolved, That the imprisonment of a  
person under the protection of the laws of this  
Commonwealth, on his failure to obey the sim­  
ple order of the President to depart out of the  
United States, as is undertaken by the said  
act entitled “An act concerning aliens,” is con­  
trary to the constitution, one amendment in  
which has provided that “ no person shall be  
deprived of liberty without due process of  
law,” and, that another having provided “ that  
in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall  
enjoy the right to a public trial by an impartial  
jury, to be informed as to the nature and cause  
of the accusation, to be confronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and  
to have assistance of counsel for his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Pre­  
sident to remove a person out of the United  
States who is under the protection of the law,  
on his own suspicion, without jury, without  
public trial, without confrontation of the wit­  
nesses against him, without having witnesses  
in his favor, without defence, without counsel,  
is contrary to those provisions also of the con­  
stitution, is therefore \ot i.aw, but utterly  
void and of no force.  
That transferring the power of judging any  
person who is under the protection of the laws,  
from the courts to the President of the United  
Slates, as is undertaken by the same act con­  
cerning aliens, is against the article of the con­  
stitution which provides that “the judicial  
power of the United States shall be vested in  
the courts, the judges of w&#x27;hich shall hold their  
offices during good behavior,” and that the  
said act is void for that reason also; and it is  
further to be noted that this transfer of judi­  
ciary power is to that magistrate of the gene­  
ral government w&#x27;ho already possesses all the  
executive, and a qualified negative in all the  
legislative powers.  
VII. Resolved, That the construction ap­  
plied by the general government (as is evident  
by sundry of their proceedings) to those parts  
of the constitution of the United States which  
delegate to Congress power to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imposts, excises, to pay the debts  
and provide for the common defence and gen­  
eral welfare of the United States, and to make  
all laws which shall be necessary and proper  
for carrying into execution the powers vested  
by the constitution in the government of the  
United States, or any department thereof, goes  
to the destruction of all the limits to their  
power prescribed by’ the constitution: That  
words meant by that instrument to be subsidia­  
ry only to the execution of the limited powers,  
ought not to be so construed as themseves to  
give unlimited powers, nor a part so to be ta­  
ken as to destroy the whole residue of the in­  
strument: That the proceedings of the gene­  
ral government, under color of those articles,  
will be a fit and necessary subject for revisal  
and correction at a time of greater tranquility,  
while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
VIII. Resolved, That the preceding resolutions  
be transmitted to the senators and representatives  
in Congress from this commomvealth, who are  
enjoined to present the same to their respec­  
tive Houses, and to use their best endeavors  
to procure, at the next session of Congress, a  
repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional and ob­  
noxious acts.  
  
IX. Resolved lastly, 1 hat the government of  
this commonwealth be,and is hereby authorized  
and requested to communicate the preceding  
resolutions to the legislatures of the several  
States, to assure them that this commonwealth  
considers union fur special national purposes,  
and particularly for those specified in their late  
federal compact, to be friendly to the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of all the States; that  
faithful to that compact, according to the plain  
intent and meaning in which it was under­  
stood and acceded to by the several parties,  
it is sincerely anxious for its preservation; that  
it does also believe that, to take from the States  
all the powers of self-government, and trans­  
fer them to a general and consolidated govern­  
ment, without regard to the special delegations  
and reservations solemnly agreed to in that  
compact, is not for the peace, happiness or pios­  
perity of these States; and that, therefore, this  
commonwealth is determined, as it doubts net  
its eu-States are, to submit to undelegated and  
consequently unlimited powers, iu no man or  
body of men on earth; that if the acts before  
specified should stand, these conclusions would  
tlow from them—that the general government  
may place any act they think proper on the  
list of crimes, and punish it themselves, whe­  
ther enumerated or not enumerated by the  
Constitution as cognizable by them; that they  
may transfer its cognizance to the President or  
any other person, who may himself be the ac­  
cuser, counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions  
may he the evidence, his order the sentence,  
his officer the executioner, and his breast the  
sole record of the transaction; that a very mi- !  
merous and valuable description of the inhabi­  
tants of these States, being by this precedent j  
reduced as outlaws to the absolute dominion ot  
one man, and the barriers of the constitution  
thus swept from us all, no rampart now re­  
mains against the passions anil the powers of  
a mojority of Congress, to protect us from a  
like exportation or other grevious punishment,  
the minority of the same body, the legislatures, i  
judges, governors and counsellors of the Status |  
nor their other peaceable inhabitants who may  
venture to reclaim the constitutional rights and  
liberties of the States, and people, or who, for  
cdher causes, good or bad, may be abnoxious to  
the view or marked by the suspicions of the !  
President, or to he thought dangerous to his or  
their elections or other interests, public or per­  
sonal; that the friendless alien has been select­  
ed as the safest subject of a first experiment;  
but the citizen will soon follow, or rather, has  
already followed; for already has a sedition act  
marked him as a prey; that these, and succes­  
sive acts of the same character, unless arrested  
on the threshold, may tend to drive these  
Slates into revolution and blood, and will fur­  
nish new calumnies against republican govern­  
ment, and new pretexts for those who wish it  
to be believed, that man cannot be governed but  
by a rod of iron; that it would be a dangerous de -  
lusion, were a confidence in the men of our  
choice to silence our fears for the safety of our  
parent of despotism; free government is founded  
in jealousy, and not in confidence—it is jealousy  
and not confidence which prescribes limited  
constitutions to bind down those whom we  
are obliged to trust with power; that our con­  
stitution has accordingly fixed the limits to  
which, and no farther, our confidence may go;  
and let the honest advocate of confidence read  
the alien and sedition acts, and say if the con­  
stitution has not been wise in fixing limits to  
the government it created, and whether we  
should be wise in destroying those limits?  
Let him say what the government is, if it be  
not a tyranny, which the men of our choice  
have conferred on the President, and the Pre­  
sident of our choice has assented to and ac­  
cepted over the friendly strangers to whom the  
mild spirit of our country and its laws had  
  
pledged Hospitality ana protection; tim tne  
men of our choice have more respected the  
bare suspicions of the President than the solid  
rights of iunocencc, the claims of justification,  
the sacred force of truth, and the forms and  
substance of law and justice. In questions of  
power, then, let no more be said of confidence  
in man, but biud him down from mischief by  
the chains of the constitution. That this  
COMMONWEALTH DOES THEREFORE CALL ON ITS  
co-States for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes herein before speci­  
fied, plainly declaring whether these acts are  
or are not authorized by the federal compact.  
O^/’And it doubts not that their sense will be so  
announced as to prove their attachment to limit­  
ed government, whether general or particular,  
and that the rights and liberties of their&#x27;co­  
States will be exposed to no dangers by remain­  
ing embarked on a common bottom with their  
own: But they will concur with this common­  
wealth in considering the said acts as so palpa­  
bly against the constitution, as to amount to an  
undisguised declaration that the compact is not  
meant to bo the measure of the powers of the  
general government, but that it will proceed in  
the exercise over these States of all powers  
whatsoever. That they will view this as seiz­  
ing the rights of the States, and consolidating  
them in the hands 6f the general government,  
with a power assumed to bind the States (not  
merely in cases made federal) but in all cases  
whatsoever, by the laws made, not with their  
consent, but bv others, againist their conseut;  
that this would be to surrender the form of  
government we have chosen, and live under  
one deriving its powers from its own will, and  
not from our authority; and that the co-States,  
recurring to their natural rights in cases not  
made federal, will concur in declaring these

this commonwealth in requesting their repeal

The pen that drasted the immortal Declara­  
tion of Independence, was again wielded by  
Thomas Jefferson in defence of the Declaration,  
the Constitution, the sovereignty of the States  
and the rights of the people.  
In 1798 the Legislature of Kentucky passed  
the resolutions drafted by Jefferson, while the  
next year the Legislature of Virginia passed  
similar sentiments from the pen of James Madi­  
son. Mr. President, I hold in my hand a copy  
of the Kentucky resolutions as Jefferson penned  
them, the second of which reads as follows:  
2. Resolved, That the Constitution of the  
United States, having delegated to Congress  
the power to punish treason--counterfeiting the  
securities and current coin of the United States  
piracies and felonies committed on the high  
seas, and offences against the laws of nations,  
and no other crimes whatever, and it being true

1 hat transferring the poweiljudging any per­  
son who is under the protect il&lt;d the laws, from  
the courts to the president of # United States as  
is undertaken by tlie same aAncerning aliens,  
is against the article of tlieeJitution which pro­  
vides, that, “the judicial |fcr of the United  
States shall he vested in thelrts, the judges of  
which shall hold their office &lt;4&gt;g good behavior,&#x27;*  
and the said act is void for tfreason also, and it  
is further to he noted that tllransfer of the ju­  
diciary power is to that militate of the general  
government who already posJes ail the executive,  
and a qualified negative in a lie legislative powers.  
7. Resolved, That the c&lt;f ruction applied by

of their proceedings) to tin jparts of the consti­

powers vested by the constifon in the government  
of tiie United States, or aJ department thereof,  
goes to the destruction of J the limits prescribed  
to their power by the &lt;i&gt;titution—that words  
meant by that instrument lie subsiduarv only to  
the execution of the limitfpowers, ought not to  
be so construed as themsJ&#x27;s to give unlimited  
powers, nor a part so to bftken, as to destroy the  
whole residue of the ins ment; That the pro­  
ceedings of tlie general g Turnout under color of  
those articles, will he a I tnd necessary subject  
for revisal and correction a time of greater tran­  
quility, while those spec id in tlie preceding re­  
solutions call for immedi &#x27; redress.  
8. Resolved, That tlie cceding resolutions he  
transmitted u&gt; tl.e tienab and Kcpresciitativcs in  
Congress from tlie com inwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the -am&lt; &gt; their respective houses,  
and to use tiieir best en avors to procure at the  
next session of Congres a repeal of tlie aforesaid  
unconstitutional and obu ;ious acts.  
9. Resolved lastly, T1 t the governor of this  
commonwealth lie, and i: mtliorised and requested  
to communicate the prodding resolutions to the  
legislatures of the seveil rtates, to assure tliem  
that this commonw ealth iiniiders union for special  
national purposes, and pfticilarly for those speci­  
fied in their late federal ®mpiet, to be friendly to  
tlie peace, happiness, aid (rosperity of all the  
States—that faithful to tkat (impact, according to  
the plain intent and mearinfdn which it was un­  
derstood and acceded to by til several parties, it is  
sincerely anxious for its preirvation; that it docs  
also believe, that to take frit the States all the  
powers of self-government, fid transfer them to a  
general and consolidated goirument, without re­  
gard to the special govemntnt, and reservation!  
solemnly agreed to in that f mpact, is not for the  
peace, happiness, or prospfity of these States  
And that therefore, this coamouwealth is deter  
mined, as it doubts not its eolstates are, to submil  
to uiffielegated and consequently unlimited powers  
in no man, or Isidy of men tn earth; that if tin  
acts lie tore specified should stand, these conclusioni  
flow from them; that the general government mat  
place anv act they think properm the list of crime&quot;

the States or the people; that thus wa mafete aa i i e ai oean ta  
their determination to retain to themselves the right or ti en it i ter ut to wa oer an o­  
of udgin o far the icentoe o ee an o ee iee o o i e e o o  
  
of the press may be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom; and fow lar those abuses whlcl  
ot be sonsrated feom their use should be tolera  
cannot be separated from their use should be tolera  
ted rather than the use be destroyed, and thus also  
they guarded against all abriegement by the United  
States, of the ireedom of religlous priniciples adild c  
ercises, and retained to themselves the right of pro  
tecting the same, as this, stated by a law passed on  
the general demand of its citizens, had already pro.  
tected them from all human restraints or interfer.  
ence; and, that, in addition to this general principle  
andexpress declaration, another and more special  
provision has been made by one of the amendments  
to the Constitution, which expressly declares, that  
&quot;Congress shall make no laws respecting an estab­  
I&#x27;shment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise  
thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of  
the press,&quot; thereby guarding in the same sentence  
and under the sam  
ete the eeedon o olon  
oros, the ireedom of Iciigims  
of speech, and of the press, inasmuch, that whatey  
er violates either, throws down the sanctuary which  
copars the others, and thatl libels, falsehood, and in  
famation, equally with heresy and false religion.  
are withheld from the cognizance of federal tribu  
nals. That therefore the act of the Congress of the  
United States, passed on the 14th of July 1798, en  
titled, &quot;An act in addition to the act entitled an act  
for the punishment of certain crimes against the Uni  
ted States,&quot; which does abridge the freedom of the  
press, is not law, but is altogether void and of no  
force.  
4. Resolved, That alien friends are under the jur  
isdiction and protection of the laws of the State  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to the United States, nor prohibited  
to the individual States distinct from their power  
over citizens, and it being true, as a general princi  
ple, and one of the amendments to the Constitution  
having also declared, that &quot;the powers not delega­  
ted to the United States by the Constitution, nor pro  
hibited to the States, are reserved to the States re-  
pectively, or to the people,&quot; the act of the the Con  
gress of the United States, passed the 22d day of June,  
170s, entitled, &quot;An act concerning aliens,&quot; which as  
sumes power over alien friends not delegated by the  
eee o oee ee oeet e  
constitution, is not law, but is altogether void and of  
no force.  
Resolved, That in addition to the general prinel  
ple as well as the express declaration, that powers  
not delegated are reserved, another and more special  
e eeee the aetitiion tor ohun.  
provision inferred in the censtituciol, toin bui  
dant caution has declared, &quot;that the migration or  
importation of such persons as any of the States  
now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not  
w existing shall think proper to admit, shall not  
be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year  
ibited by the Congress prior to the year  
1808.&quot; That this commonwealth does admit the mi  
gration of alien friends described as the subject of  
the said act concerning aliens; that a provision  
against prohibiting their migration, is a provision  
agamst ail acts equivalent thereto, or it wount be  
nugatory; that to remove tham when migrated is  
equivalent to a prohibition of the migration, and  
is therefore, contrary to the said provision of the  
constitution, and void.  
6. Resoleed. That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order of the  
the United States, as is  
amendment in which has provided, that no person  
shall be deprived of the liberty without due process  
of law,&quot; and that another having provided, &quot;that in  
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the  
right of a public trial by an impartial jury, to be  
informed as to the nature and cause of the accusa­  
tion, to be confronted with the witnesses against  
him, to have compulsory process for obtaining wit­  
nesses in his favor, and to have assistance of coun­  
sel for his defence,&quot; the same act undertaken to  
authorize the President to remove a person out of  
the United States who is under the protection of the  
law, on his own suspicion, without jury, without  
public trial; without confrontation of the witnesses  
against him, without having witnesses in his favor,  
without defence, without counsel, is contrary to  
these provisions, also of the Cconstitution ls therefore  
not a law, but utterly void, and of no force.  
That transferring the power of jurdging any per  
son who is under the protection of the laws, from  
the courts to the President of the United States as is  
undertaken by the same act concerning aliens, is  
against the article of the Constitution which pro  
vides, that, &quot;the judicial power of the United States  
shall be vested in the courts, the judges of which  
shall hold their office during good behavior,&quot; and  
the said act is void for that reason also, and it is fur­  
ther to be noted that this transfer of the judiciary  
power is to that magistrate of the general govern­  
ment who already possesses all the executive, and a  
qualified negative in all the legislative powers.  
7. Resolved. That the construction applied by the  
general Government (as is evident by sundry of their  
proceeding) to those parts of the constitution of the  
Un ted States, which delegate to Congress, power to  
lay and collect taxes, duties, imports, excises; to pay  
the debts, and provide for the common defence, and  
general welfare of the United States, and to make  
all laws which shall be necessrry and proper for  
carrying into execution the powers vested by the­  
constitution in the Government of the United States,  
or any department thereof, goes to the destruction  
of all the limits prescribed to their power by the  
that words meant by that instrument  
to be subsiduary only to the execution of the limited  
 powers, ought not to be so construed ar themseives  
 to give unlimited power, nor a part so to he taken,  
as to destroy the wholed resldde of the ti tin  
That the proceedings of the general gevernment  
under color of those articles, will be a fit and neces­  
sary subject for revisal and correction at a time of  
greater tranquility, while those specined atue e  
ceding resolutions call for immediate redress,  
s. Resolced. That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the Senators and he resentatives in  
Congress from the commonwealth, who are enjoined  
to present the same to their respective houses, and  
to use their best endeavors to procure at the next  
session of Congress, a repeal of the aforesaid un  
constitutional and obnoxions acts.  
9. Resolved lastly, That the Governor of this com­  
monwealth be, and is authorized and requested to  
communicate the preceding resolutions to the legis­  
latures of the several States, to assure them that  
this commonwealth considers union for special na­  
tionel purposes, and particularly for those specified  
hapniness, and prosperity of all the States-  
in their late federal compact, to be iricitily  
omnpact.  
 that fairhful to that compact, according to the plain  
intent and meaning in which it was understood and  
acceded to by the several parties, it is sincerely  
anxious for its preservation; that it does also believe  
that to take from the States all the powers of self-  
 ae  a   
Government, and transter them to a general and  
consolidated government, without regard to the  
special Government, and reservations solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, ahot to e  
piness, or prosperity of these States: And that there­  
fore this commionwealth is determined, as it doubts  
antits costates are to submit to undelegated  
not its  
msequently unlimited powers in no man,  
y of men on earth; that if the acts be  
and con  
on body o  
fore specified should stand, these  
conclusions flow  
from them; that the general government may  
place any act they think proper on the list of crimes  
and punish it themselves, whether enumerates or  
not enumerated, by the constitution cognizable by  
that they may transfer its cognigance to the  
President or any other person, who may himself be

and valuable description of the inhabitants of these  
States, being by this preeedent reduced as out-laws.  
to absolute dommion of one man, and the bartiers  
of the censtitution thus swept from us all; no ram

 afready followed; for, already has a sedition act

acts of the same charactor, unless arrested on the  
 threshold, may tend to drive these states ite revo

against repeblican governments, and  
for those whe wish it to be believed, that man can  
not ba governed but by a rod of iron; that would  
be a dangerous aclusion were a conlidence in the

the Copstitution has not been wise in fixing limits to  
the goberpment it created, and whether we should  
be wisse in destroying those limits? Let him say

in questions of power then let no more be said

crimes hereinbefore spectified, plamly declaring  
whether these acts are or are not authorized by the

federal compact. And it doubts not that their

4  
a  a tbo eights and tberties of their co-

considering the said acts as so palpably against the  
Constitution as to amount to an undisguised declara  
tion that the compact is not meant to be the measure  
of the powers of the General Government, but that  
it will proceed in the exercise over these States of

that to this compact each State acceded as a State  
and is an integral party; that this Government creat-  
ed by this compact, was non made the exelusive or  
final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to  
itself; since that would have made its discretions  
and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers;  
but, that as in all other cases of compact, among  
parties having no common judge, euch party has an  
equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of  
the mode and measures of redress.  
2. Resolved. That the Constitution of the United  
States having delegated to Congress a power to pun-  
ish treason, counterfeiting the securities and coin of  
the United States, piracies and felonies committed on  
the high seas, and offences against the laws of na-  
tious, and no other crimes whatever, and it being  
true, as a general principle, and one of the amend-  
ments to the Constitution having also declared, &quot;that  
the powers not delegated to the United States by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are  
reserved to the States respectively, or to the peo  
ple,&quot; therefore, also, the same act of Congress, pass  
ed on the 14th day of July, 1738, and entitled, &quot;An  
act in addition to the act entitled an act for the pun  
ishment of certain crimes against the United States;&quot;  
as also, the act passed by them on the 27th day of  
June, 1798, entitled, &quot;An act to punish frauds com­  
mitted on the banks of the United States,&quot; (and all  
other of their acts which assume to create, define,  
or punish crimes others than those enumerated in  
the Constitution) are altogether void and of no force,  
and that the power to create, define, and punish such  
other crimes is reserved, and of right appertains  
solely and exclusively to the respective States, each  
e e e   
within its own Territory.  
3. Resolved, That it is true, as a general principle  
and is also expressly declared by one of this amend  
ments to the constitution, that the powers not dele  
gated to the United States by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the  
States respectively or to the people;&quot; and that no  
power over the freedom of religion, freedom of  
speech, or freedom of the press being delegated to  
the United States by the Constitution, not prohibited  
by it to the States, all lawful powers respecting the  
same did of right remain, and were reserved to the  
States or neople; and thus was manifested their  
determination to retain to themselves the right of  
judging how far the licentiousness of speech and  
of the press may be abridged without lessening  
their useful freedom; and now far those abuses  
which cannot be separated from their use should be  
tolerated rather than the use be destroyed, and  
thus also they guarded against all abridgement by  
the United States, of the freedom of religious prin  
ciples and exercises, and retained to themselves the  
right of protecting the same, as this, stated by a law  
passed on the general demand of its citizens, had  
already protected them from all human restraints

ion and protection of the laws of the State  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to the United States, nor prohibited  
to the individual States distinct from their power  
over citizens, and it being true, as a general prin  
ciple, and one of the amendments to the Constitution  
having also declared, that the powers not deiegated  
to the United States by the Constitution, nor pro­  
hibited to the States, are reserved to the States re  
sumes power over aliens not delegated by the Con-  
o e ot le bat te alogothon wold and ofno  
stitution, is hot law, but is altosetier tod an w  
force.  
5. Resolced. That in addition to the general prin  
ciple as well as the express declaration, that powers  
not delegated are reserved, another and more spe­  
cial provision inferred in the Constitution, from  
abundant caution has declared, &quot;that the migration  
or importation of such persons as any of  the States  
now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not  
be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year  
1808. That this commonwealth does admit the il  
gration of alien friends described as the subject of  
the said act concerning aliens; that a provision  
against prohibiting their migration, is a provision  
against all acts equivalent thereto, or it would be  
nugatory; that to remove them when migrated is  
equivalent to a prohibition of the migration, and,  
is therefore, contrary to the said provision of the  
Constitution, and void.  
6. Hesolved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order of  
the Fresident, to depart out of the ohited tates,  
is undertaken by the said act, entitled. &quot;An act  
concerning aliens,&quot; is contrary to the Constitution  
one amendment in which has provided, that &quot;no per  
son shall be deprived of the liberty without due  
process of law&quot; and that another having provided,  
&quot;that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall  
enjoy the right of a public trial by an impartial  
jury, to be informed as the nature and cause of the  
accusation, to be contronted with the withesses  
against him, to have compulsory process for obtain  
ing witnesses in his favor, and to have assistance of  
el for his defense,&quot; the same act undertaken to  
authorize the President to remeve a person out of  
the United States who is under the protection of the  
law, on his own suspicion, without jury, without  
public trial; without confrontation of the witnesses  
against him, without having witnesses in his favor,  
without defence, without counsel, is contrary to  
these provisions, also of the Constitution is there  
fore not a law, but utterly void, and of no force.  
That trapsferring the power of judging any per  
son who is under the protection of the laws, from  
the courts to the President of the United States as  
undertaken by the same act concerning aliens,  
against the article of the Constitution which pro-  
aa thnt tathe tudtoiol nowon of tho Hnitod ote too  
shall be vested in the courts, the judges of which  
shall hold their office during good behavior,&quot; and  
the said act is void for that reason also, and it is  
further to be noted that this transfer of the judiciary  
power is to that magistrate of the general govern­  
ment who already possess all the executive, and a  
qualified negative in all the legislative powers.  
7. Resolced, That the construction applied by the  
general government (as is evident by sundry of their  
proceeding) to those parts of the constitution of the  
United States, which delegate to congress power to  
lay and collect taxes, duties, imports, execises; to pay  
the debts, and provide for the commmon defense, and  
general warfare of the United States, and to make  
all laws which shall be necessary and proper for  
carrying into execution the powers vested by the  
constitution in the Government of the United States,  
or any depastment thereof, goes to that destructien  
of all the limits prescribed to their power by the  
constitution- that words meant by the instrument  
to be subsidary only to the execution of the limited  
powers, ought not to be so construed as themselves  
to give unlimited power, nor a part so to be taken,  
as to destroy the whole residue of the instrument:  
That the proceeding of the general government un­  
der color of those articles, will be a fit and neces­  
sary subject for revisal and correction at a time of  
greater tranquility, while those specified in the pre­  
ceding resolutions call for immediate redress.  
S. Resolved, That the preceding resolutious be  
transmitted to the Senators and Representatives in  
Cengress from the commonwealth, who are enjoined  
to present the same to their respective houses, and  
to use their best endeavors to procure at the next  
session of Congress, a repeal of the aforesaid uncon­  
stitutional and obnoxious acts.  
9. Resolved lastlg, That the Governor of this com­  
monwealth be, and is authorized and requested to  
communicate the preceding resolutions to the legis­  
latures of the several States, to assure them that  
this commonwealth considers union for special na­  
tional purposes, and particularly for those specified  
in their late federal compact, to be friendly to the  
peace, happiness, and prosperity of all the States  
that faithful to that compact, accerding to the plain  
intent and meaning in which it was understood and  
acceded to by the several parties, it is sincerely  
anxious for its preservation; that it does also believe,  
that to take from the States all the powers of self­  
Government, and transfer them to a general and  
consolidated government, without regard to the  
special government, and reservations solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace, hap­  
piness, or prosperity of these States: And that there­  
fore, this commonwealth is determined, as it doubts  
not its co-states are, to submit to undelegated  
and consequently unlimited powers in no man,  
or body of men on earth; that if the acts be­  
fore specified should stand, these conclusions flow  
from them; that the general government may  
place any act they think proper on the list of crimes  
and punish it themselves, whether enumerated or  
not enumerated, by the Constitution cognizable by  
them, that they may transfer its cognizance to the  
President or any other person, who may himself be  
the accuser, counsel, judge, and jury, whose sus­  
picions may be the evidence, his order the sentence,  
his officer the executioner, and his breast the sole  
record of the transaction; that a very numerous  
and valuable description of the inhabitants of these  
States, being by this precedent reduced as out-laws  
to absolute dominion of one man, and the barriers  
of the Constitution thus swept from us all; no ram­  
part now remains against the passions and the pow­  
er of a majority of Congress to portect from a like  
exportation or rather grievous punishment the mi­  
nority of the same body, the legislatures, judges,  
governors and connsellors of the States, nor their  
other peaceable inhabitants who may venture to  
reclaim the Constitutional rights and liberties of the  
States, and people, or who for other causes, good or  
badf may be obnoxious to the view or marked by  
the suspicions of the President, or to be thought  
dangerous to his or their elections or other interests,  
public or personal; that the friendless alien has  
been selected as the safest subject of a first experi  
ment, but the citizen will soon follow, or rather has  
already followed; for, already has a sedition act  
marked him as a prey: That these and successive  
f the same character, unless arrested on the  
threshhold, may tend to drive these States into rev-  
olution and blood, and will furhish new caluniles  
against republican Governments, and new pretexts  
for those who wish it to be believed, that man can­  
not be gorerned but by a rod of iron; that would  
be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the  
men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety  
of our rights; that confidence is every where the  
parent of despotism; free government is founded in  
and not in confidence; it is the jealousy and  
not confidence which prescribes limited constitution  
to Lind down those whom we are obliged to trust  
with power, that our constitution has accordingly  
fixed the limits to which and no further our conn  
dence may go; and let the honest advocates of conf

dence read the alien and sedition acts, and say if;  
  
the Constitution has not been wise in fixing limits to  
the Governments it created, and whether we should  
be wise in destroying those limits? Let him say  
what the Government is, if it be not a tyranny;  
which the men of our choice have conferred on the  
President, and the President of our choice has as-  
sented to and accepted over the friendly strangers,  
to whom the mid spirit of our country and its laws  
have pledged hospitality and protection; that the  
men of our choice have more respected the bare  
suspiciens of the President than the solid rights of  
innocence, the claims fof justification, the sacred  
force of truth, and the forms and substance of law  
and justice.  
In questions of power then let no more be said of  
confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief  
by the chains of the Constitution. That this com  
monwealth does therefore call on its co-States for  
an expression of their sentiments on the acts con­  
cerning aliens, and for the punisement of certain  
crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly declaring  
whereby these acts are or are not authorized by the  
federal compact. And it doubts not that their sense  
will be so announced as to prove their attachment  
to limited government, whether general or particu­  
lar, and that the rights and liberties of their co­  
states will be exposed to no dangers by remaining  
embarked on a common bottom with their own.  
But they will concur with this commonwealth in  
considering the said acts as so palpably against the  
Constitution as to amount to an undisguised decla­  
ration, that the compact is not meant to be the mea­  
sure of the power of the General Government, but  
that it will proceed in the exercise over these States  
of all powers whatsoever. That they will view  
this as seizing the rights of the States and consoli­  
dating them in the hands of the General Govern­  
ment, with a power assumed to bind the States (not  
merely in cases made federal) but in all cases what  
soever, by laws made, not with their consent, but  
by others against their consent; and this would be  
to surrender the form of government we have cho­  
sen, and live under one deriving its powers from its  
will, and not from our authority; and that the co-  
states recurring to their natural rights not made  
federal, will concur in declaring these void and of  
no force, and will each unite with this common-  
wealth in requesting their repeal at the next session  
of Congress

additibn to the general prin

jail laws which shall be necessaw- and proper for carry  
  
ing into execution the powers vested hy the constitu­

department thereof, goes to that destruction of all the  
limits prescribed to their power by the constitution  
that words meant by the instrument to be subsidiary  
!only to the execution of the limited powers, ought not  
to be so constructed as themselves to give unlimited  
power, nor a part so to be taken, as to destroy the Whole  
residue of the instrument: &quot; That the proceeding of  
the general government under color of those; articles,&quot;

specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate

from the commonwealth, who are enjoined to present  
the eame to their respective houses, and to use their  
best endeavors to procure at the next session of Cdn-j  
gress, a repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional and ob­  
noxiou acts. &#x27;.. :.!&#x27;&#x27;  
! 9. Rescived lastly, That the Governor of this com­  
monwealth be,; and is &#x27; authorized and requested to  
communicate the preceding resolutions to the&#x27; legisla-  
tures.of the several States, to assure them : that this  
commonwealth considers union for special national  
mrposes, and particularly for those specified in their  
ate federal compact, to be friendly to the peace, hap­  
piness, and prosperity of all the States that faithful  
to the compact, according to the plain intent and  
meaning in which it was understood and acceded to  
by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to take  
from the States all the powers of self-government,  
and transfer them to a general and consolidated gov­  
ernment, without regard to the special government,  
and reservations solemnly agreed to in that compact,  
is hot for the peace, happiness, of prosperity of these  
States. And that therefore, this commonwealth is .  
determined, as it doubts not its co-states are, to sub­  
mit to undelegated and consequently unlimited powers  
, in no man, or aody of men on earth; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, these conclusions flow  
.from them; that the general goVernment may place  
any act they think proper on the list of crimes and  
punish, it themselves, whether enumerated of not enu­  
merated, by the constitution cognizable by them, that  
they may transfer its cognizance tb the President or  
any cither person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge rand jury, whose suspicions may be the  
evidence, his order the sentence, his officer the execu­  
tioner, and his breast the sole record of the transac­  
tion ; that a very numerous and valuable description  
of the inhabitants of theseStates, being by this pre­  
cedent reduced as out-laws to absolute dominion of  
. one&quot; man, and the- barriers of the constitution thus  
swept Jrom us aU ; no rampart now remains against  
the passions and the power of a majority of Congress  
to protect from a like exportation or rather grievous  
punishment the minority &#x27;of the same body, the legis­  
latures, judges,- governors, and counsellors of the  
States,- nor their other peaceable inhabitants who may  
venture to reclaim the constitutional rights and liber­  
ties of the States, and people, or who for other causes,  
good or bad, may be obnoxious to the view 6r marked  
by the suspicions bf the President? or to be thought  
dangerous to his or their Elections or other ; interest,  
public or .personal ; that the friendless alian has been  
selected as the safest subject of a first experiment, but  
the citizgn will soon follow, or rather has already fol-.  
lowed; tor, already has a sedition act marked him as  
a prey: That ! these and successive acts of ; the same  
character,-unless arrested on the tbreshhold may j tend  
to drive these States into revolution and blood, and  
will furnish new calumnies against republican gov­  
ernments, and new pretexts for those who &#x27;wish it to  
be believed, that man cannot be governed but by a  
  
rod ol iron ; that would be a dangerous delusion were  
a confidence in the men of our . choice to silence our  
fears for the safety of bur rights; .that confidence is  
: everywhere, the parent of despotism, free government  
is founded in jealousy and uot in confidence ; it is the  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited,  
constitution to bind down those . whom we are  
obliged&#x27;to trust with power, thatour constitution lias  
accordingly fixed the limits to which and no further  
our confidence may go; and let the honest advocates  
of confidence&#x27; read the alien and sedition acts, and say  
if the constitution has not been wise in fixing limits  
to the governments it created, and whether we should  
be wise in destroying those limits ? Let him say what  
&#x27;the government is, if it be not a tyranny; which the  
men pi our choice have conferred on the President,  
and the President of ourjehoice has assented to and  
accepted&#x27; over the&#x27; friendly strangers, to whom the  
..mild spirit of bur country -and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protec tion ; that the men of our choice  
have more, respected the bare suspicions ot the rresi  
,dent than the solid rights of innocence, the claims of  
justification, the sacred fikce of truth, and the forms  
and substance of law and justice.  
In questions of power then let no more be said of  
confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief  
by the&#x27;.chains of the Constitution. That this common­  
wealth dci-s therefore call on its co-States for an ex­  
pression of their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for the punishment of certain crimes here­  
inbefore specified, plainly declaring whereby these acts  
are or are not authorized by the federal compact. And  
it doubts not that their sense will be so&#x27; announced as  
to prove their attachment to limited government,  
whether&#x27; gejneral of particular, and that the rights and  
liberties of jtheir co-States will be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their-own. But they &#x27;will concur with this com­  
monwealth in considering, tlie said acts as so palpably  
against the Constitution as to amount to an undis­  
guised declaration, that the com pact is not meant to  
be the measure of the power-bf the General Govern-  
ment, but that it will proceed iri the exercise over -  
these States of all powers whatsoever, that they will  
view this as seizing the rights of the States and consol­  
idating them&#x27; in the hands, of the General Government,  
with a power assumed to bind the States (not .merely  
in case&#x27;s made federal) but in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made, not with their consent, but &#x27; by others  
against their consent; and this ; would be to surrender  
the form of government we have chosen, and live un­  
der one deriving its powers from its will, and not from  
our. authority; and that the co-States recurring to their  
natural rights not made federal; will c&#x27;oncur in declar­  
&#x27; ing these void and. of &#x27;no force, and will each unite with  
this commonwealth in requesting their repeal at the  
next session of Congress

this compact each State acceded as a State and is an  
  
integral party ; that this government, created by this  
compact, was not made the exclusive or nnal judge  
of the extent of the-powers delegated to itself; since  
that would have made its discretions and not the  
Constitution, the measure of its powers ; but, that as  
in allj other cases of compact, among partiea having  
no common judge, each party ha an equal right to  
jttdg for. itself as well as of&#x27; infractions as of the  
riiodciand measuri1 of repress. . &#x27;  
2. Resolved, That the Constitution of the United  
Statejs having delegated to Congress, power to pun­  
ish treason, counterfeiting the securities and coin of  
the United States, piracies and felonies committed on  
the high seas, and offenses against the Jaws of na­  
tions and no other crimes whatever, arid it being  
true, as a general principle,&#x27; and one of the amend­

the powers not delegated to the United States by the  
.Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are  
-reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, &quot;  
therefore, also, the same act of Congress,, passed oh  
the i4th day of July, 1798, and entitled, &quot; An act in  
addiiion t6 the act-entitled an act for the punishment  
of certain crimes against the United States ; &quot; as also,  
the pet passed by them on the 27th day of June,  
179, entitled, &quot;An act to &#x27;punish frauds committed&quot;  
on the banks of the United States, &quot; (and all other of  
their acts&#x27; which assume to .create,, define, or punish  
crimes others than- those enumerated in the constitu­  
tion are altogether void and of no force, and that the  
powjr&#x27;tq create, -define, and punish such other&#x27; crimes  
is reserved, and of right appertains solely and ex­  
clusi vely to the respective States, each within its own  
Terrati ry. . &#x27; - . &quot;  
3. Resolved, That it is true, as a general principle,  
. and is also expressly declared by one of the amend­

prohibited by&#x27;it to &#x27; the States, are reserved to the  
&#x27;States&#x27; respectively&#x27; or to &#x27;the &quot; people ;&quot; and that no  
power over the freedom of religion, freedom of speech,  
or &#x27;freedom of the press being delegated to the United  
Statps by the Constitution, hot prohibited by it to the  
Stat?s,- a.ll lawfiil&#x27; powers respecting the same did of  
right remain,&quot; and were reserved to the States or peo­  
ple ; and thus -was &#x27; manifested . their determination -to  
re tan to themselves the right of judging how. far. the  
licentiousness of speech ami of - the prfess .may be  
abridged without lessening their useful . fredom J. :and  
how far those abuses which cannot be separated from ,  
their use should be tolerated, rather tlianthe&#x27; use be  
1 destroyed, and thus , also &#x27;they guarded&#x27; against all  
abridgement by;the United States&#x27;, &#x27;-of the .freedom of  
relipous .principles and exercises, and&#x27; retained to  
themselves&#x27; the right of protecting the same; as this,  
stated by a law passed tn the general &#x27;demand vf its  
.&#x27;citi;:en.Sj had already protected them from all human  
, restraints&#x27; or interference f;- and. that, in addition to  
this. general principle and express declaration, another  
afn more&#x27;: special provision has been made by one of  
the. amendments to the Constitution, which expressly  
declares, that &#x27; Longress . shalL make no laws, re-.  
spefting an estiiblishment of religion, .or prohibiting  
the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of

asirLUchjlthat whatever violates either, throws down  
the saiK&#x27;tukry which covers others, and that libels,  
falsehoods, and defamation, equally with heresy and  
false -religion, are withheld from the cognizance ipf

&quot; An; act concermn&#x27;g .aliens, which assumes power  
over aliens jiot delegated, by the Constitution, is -not

. Resolved, ; That in addition to the general prin-.  
ciple as well as the exjtress declaratmn, that powers  
hoi 1 delegated are reserved, another and more special  
provision inferred in the. Constitution, froi abundant  
caution has declared, &quot;that the migration or impof-

ing snau thiuK proper to admit, shall not be pro  
hibited by the&#x27; Congress, prior to the&#x27; year 1808.  
That this commonwealth does admit the migration of  
ailfcrt friends -described as the subject of the said act  
Concerning aliens that a provision against prolubiting  
their migration, is a provision against all acts equiva  
lent thereto, or at would be nugatory; that to re;  
mipye them -when migrated is equivalent to a prohi  
bition of the migration, and is, therefore, contrary to  
the said provision :of the? Constitution, and void  
utder. the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his failure to obey, the simple order of the  
Pj-esident, to depart out of the United States, as is  
uftdertaican by the said act, entitled, &quot;An act con  
cerning aliens,&quot;-is contrary .to the Constitution, one

be confronted! with the witnesses against him, to have  
compulsory process for obtaining . witnesses in : his  
iavor, and, to have assistance .or counsel for his de  
fense the same act undertaken to authorize the  
President to remove a person out .of the United States

suspicion, without jury, without public trial, without  
Cvnfrontationof the witnesses against him, without  
having witnesses in his favor, without defense&#x27;,;&#x27; with  
pat coujiseh is contrary to those provisions, also of the  
constitution, is therefore not a law, .but utterly-void,  
ahd ot no iorce.  
That transferring the power of judging any person  
Who is under the protection ot the laws, from the  
courts to the Presidents of the United States as is un  
dertaken bv the same act concerning aliens, is asjainst  
Lthe article of - the constitution which providf s that  
&quot;(the judicial .power ot the United States shall be vest

office during good behavior,&quot; and the said ,act is void  
fr that reason also; and it is further to be noted that  
tpis transfer of the judiciary power is to that magis­  
trate of the general government who already possess

proceeding) to those parts of the constitution of the  
United States, which delegate to Congress power! to

pay the debts, and provide for the common defense,

all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carry

mit to undelegated and consequently unlimited powers  
in no man, or aody of men on earth&#x27;; that if the acts

of confidence read the alien and sedition acts, ami say  
if the constitution has not been wise in . fixiug limit  
to the governments it created, and whether, we should  
be- wise in destroying those limits ? Let him sa1what  
the: government is, if it be not a tyranny : Avhicfi the&#x27;

and the President of our choice; has assented t and  
accepted over the friendly strangers, to whorli the  
mild spirit of our country audits laws have. pledged  
hospitality and protection ;fhat the men of our choice  
have more respected the bare suspicions of the Presi  
dent than the solid rights of innocence, the claims of  
justification, the sacred force of truth, and, the: forms  
and substance of law and mstice.  
. Iri.miestions of power then let no more be said of  
confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief  
by the chains of the Constitution. That this common­  
wealth does therefore call on its co-States for an ex­  
pression of their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens,&#x27; and for the punishment of certain crimes Iiere­  
inbefore specified, plainly declaring whereby these act&#x27;s  
are or are not authorized by the federal compact.&#x27; And .  
it doubts not that their sense will, be so announced as  
to- prove their attachment to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights and1  
liberties of their co-States will be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining &#x27;embarked on a common bottom&#x27;  
with their own. But they will concur with thiscom  
man wealth in considering the said acts as so palpably  
against the Constitution as toamount to an undis­  
guised declaration, that the compact is not meant, to  
&#x27;be the measure of the. power of the General , Govern  
ment, but that it will proceed m the exercise over  
these States of all powers whatsoever. That they: will  
view this as seizing the rights of the States and ronsoi-,  
idatingthern in the hands of the General Government,  
with a pOwer assumed to bind the States (not merely&#x27;  
in cases made federal) but. in all caseswhatsoever, by  
laws made, not with their consent,7 but by others  
against their consent; and this would be to surrender  
the form of government we have chosen, and live un­  
der one deriving its powers from Its will, and not from  
our authority; and that the co-States recurring to their  
natural rights not made federal, will concur in declar­  
ing these void and of ho forceand will each unite with  
this commonwealth in requesting their repeal at the  
next session of Congress. ,&#x27;., &#x27; &quot; ;

laws made. not. with their&#x27; consent, but by others

the form of government we have oSen, and live un­

commonwealth considers union for special national  
purposes, and particularly for those specified in their  
lat federal compact, to be friendly to the peace hap­  
piness, and prosperity of all the States that faithful  
to the compact, according to the plain intent and  
meaning in which it was understood and acceded to  
by the several parties&#x27;, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation ; that it does also believe, that to take  
from the States all the powers of self-government,  
and transfer them to a general and consolidated gov­  
ernment, without regard to the special government,  
ahd reservations solemnly agreed to in that compact,  
is not for the peace, happiness, or. prosperity ( of these  
States. And that therefore, this &#x27;&#x27;commonwealth is  
determined, as&#x27; it doubts not its. co-states are; to sub-;  
riiit to undelegated and consequently unlimited powers  
in no map, or aodj- of men&#x27;on earth ; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, these conclusions flow  
from them; that the -general government may place  
any act they think proper on the list of crimes and  
punish it themselves, whether enumerated or not enu­  
merated, by the constitution cognizablelby them, that  
they may transfer its cognizance to the &#x27; President or  
any other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel,&#x27; judge and jury, whose suspicions imay be the  
evidence, his order the sentence, his officer the execu­  
tioner, and his breast the sole record of the transac­  
tion ; that a very numerous and valuable description  
of the inhabitants of theseStates, being by this pre-?  
cedent reduced as out-laws to absolute .dominion of  
one man, and, the barriers of the constitution thus  
swept from us all; no, rampart now remains against

to protect from a like exportation or rather grievous  
Jpunishment the minority of tlie same body, the legis

venture to reclaim the constitutional rights and liber­

good or bad, may be obnoxious to the view or marked  
by-the suspicions of the President, or &#x27;to I be-thought  
dangerous to his or their elections or other interest,  
public or personal ; that the friendless alum has been  
selected as the safest subject of a first experiment, but  
the. citizen will soon follow, or rather has ahead&#x27; fol  
lowed; for, already has&#x27;a setlition act marked him. as  
a prey: .1 hat these and successive acts pi the same  
character, unless arrested on the threshhold may tend  
to drive these States into revolution and blood, and  
will furnish new calumnies .against republican gov  
ernments, and new pretexts for those, who wish it! to  
be believed,, that man cannot be gowr.ned but by a  
rod of iron ; that would, be a dangerous delusion were  
a confidence in the men of. our choice to silence our  
fears for the safety of our rights; that. Confidence is  
everywhere the parent of despotism, free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence;&#x27; it is the &#x27;  
jealous)- and not confidence which prescribeslimited-constitution.-  
to bind down those whom we are  
obliged to trust with power, that ourconstitution has  
accordingly fixed the limits-to Avhich and no further  
our confidence .may go; and let the honc&#x27;st advocates  
&quot;of confidence read tlie alien and sedition acts, and say  
if the. constitution has not been wise in fixing limits&#x27;  
to the governments it created, and whether we should  
be wise in destroying those limits? . Let bim say what  
the government is, if it be &quot;not a tyranny which the  
men of our choice, have conferred on the President,  
and the President qf&quot; our choice has assented, to and  
accepted over tlie friendly&#x27; strangers,&#x27; to whom the  
mild spirit of our country and its laws ha&#x27;ve pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men of our &#x27;choice  
have more respected the bare suspicions !of the Presi­  
dent than the solid rights of innocence, tbe claims of  
justification, the sacred force vi truth, ahd the forms  
and substance of law and justice. j  
; In questions of prwer then let no more be said of  
confidence in man, but bind him doAvn ironv mischief  
by the chains of the Constitution. That this common­  
wealth does therefore call on its cOrStates for an ex­  
pression of their sentiments on the acts &#x27;concerning  
aliens, and for thepunishmehtof certain crimes here­  
inbefore specified, plainly declaring whereby these acts  
arc or .are not authorized by the federal cbm pact. And  
it doubts not that their sense. will be so announced as  
to-prove : their attachment to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights and  
liberties of their co-States will be exposed-to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a &#x27;common bottom  
with theiif own. But-they will concur with this com­  
monwealth in considering the said acts as so jmlpably  
against the Constitution as to amoant to, an undis-  
guised dqcla&#x27;ration, that the compact is not meant to  
be the measure of the power of the General Govern­  
ment, but that it will proceed in the exercise oyer,  
these States of allpowers whatsoever. That they will  
view this&quot; as seizing the rights of the States and consol­  
idating tiiem in. the hands of the General Government,  
with a power assumed, to bind the States (not merely  
in cases inade federal) but in all cases yhatsoever, by  
laws made, not with&#x27;! their consent,&#x27; but by others  
against heir consent; and this would bje to surrender

statedby a law passed on the general demand of its

ing into execution the powers yested by the constitu­  
tion in the government of the United States, or any  
department thereof, goes to that destruction of all the  
limits prescribed to their power by ; the constitution  
that words meant by the instrument to be subsidiary,  
only ito the execution of the &#x27;limited powers, ought not  
to be so constructed as themselves to give unlimited  
power, nor a part so to be taken, as j destroy the whole  
residue of . the instrument: That! the proceeding of  
the general government tinder color of those articles,  
will be a fit an-i necessary subject for revisal and cor­  
rection at a time of greater tranquility, while those  
specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate

mitted to the Senators and Representatives in Congresa  
from the commonwealth, who are enjoined to present  
tlie pa me to their respective houses, and to use their  
best endeavors to procure at the bext session of Con­  
gress, a repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional and ob­  
noxious acts. v : ; i . .  
9. Resdted lastly, That the Governor of this com­  
monwealth be, and is authorized &#x27;and requested to  
communicate the preceding resolutions to the legisla­  
tures of the several States, to assure them that this  
Commonwealth considers union for special national  
fmrposes, and particularly for thole specified in their  
ate iederal compact, to be friendly to the peace, hap­  
piness, and prosperity of all the States that faithful  
to the compact, according-, to the plain intent . and  
meaning in which it was understood and acceded to  
by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also bfeliever that to take  
from the States , all the powers of self-government;  
and transfer, them to a general and consolidated gov­  
ernment, without regard to the special government,  
and reservations solemnly agreed ;o in that compact,  
is not for the peace,- happiness, or prosperity of these  
States. And that therefore, this j commonwealth is  
determined, as it doubts not its co-states are, to sub­  
mit undelegated and consequently unlimited powers  
in no mart, or aody jf men on earth; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, these conclusions flow  
from them; that the general government may place  
any act they think proper on this list of crimes and  
punish it themselves, whether enumerated or not enu­  
merated, by the constitution cognizable by them, that  
they may transfer its cognizance jto the President or  
any other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be the  
evidence, his order the sentence, his officer the execu­  
tioner, and his breast the sole record of the transac­  
tion ; that a very numerous and Valuable description  
of the inhabitants of theseStates, jbeing by this pre­  
cedent reduced as out-laws to absolute dominion of

ties of the States, and people, or who for other causes,  
gxd or bail, may be obnoxious tol the view or marked  
by the. suspicions of the President, or to bethought  
dangerous ;to his or their elections or other interest,

selected as the safest subject of a first experiment, but  
tlie citizen will soon follow, or rather has already fol­  
lowed; for, already has a sedition Jact marked him as  
a prey : That these and successive acts of the same  
character, unless arrested on the thjreshhold may tend  
to drive these&#x27; &quot;States into revolution and blood, and  
will furnish new&quot;( calumnies agaiijst republican gov­

every where&#x27; tie parent of despotisii, free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in Confidence; it is the  
jeprlousy and not&quot; confidence which prescribes limited  
constitution to bind dovviv those whom we are  
obliged to trust with pow&#x27;r, that :ir constitution has  
accordingly fixed tlie limits to .which and no further  
our coiifideiue may go; and let the holiest advocates  
of confidence read tbc alien and sedition acts, and say  
if the constit .ition has notj een wise in fixing limits  
to the governments it created, anr. whether we should  
be wise in destroying those limits? &#x27; ! Let him sav what  
the g(ivernnient is, if it be not a tyranny; which the  
men &quot;of .ur choice have conferred on tlie President,  
aud the President of our choice Has assented to and  
accepted over the friendly strangers, to . whom the  
, mild spirit of our country ! and its! laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection ; that the men ot our choice  
have raore respected the-bare suspicions of the Presi­  
dent than the solid rights of innocence, the claims of  
justification, the sacred force of truth, and . the forms  
and sulistance of law and justice.  
In questions of power then let 116 more be said of  
confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief  
by the chains of tlie Constitution. That this common­  
wealth does therefore call on its co-States for an ex­  
pression of their sentintenta on the j acts concerning  
aliens, and for the punishment of jcertain crimes here­  
inbefore specified, plainly declaring whereby these acts  
jiire or are not authorized, by the federal compact. And  
it doubts not that their sense will) be so anndunced as  
to prove their attachment to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights and  
liberties of their co-States will be  
gers by remaining embarked on  
(exposed to no dan-  
a common bottom  
with their own. But they will concur with this com  
monwealth in considering the said acts as so palpably  
against the Constitution; as to amount to an nndis­  
guised declaration, that the compact lis not meant to  
be the measure of the power of the General Govern­  
ment, but that it will proceed n the exercise over  
these States oridl powers whatsoever.&#x27; That they will  
view this as seizing the rights of the States and consol-  
luaringinem mine uanas 01 tueuenerai uoyernment,  
with a power assumed to bind the States (not merely  
hi cases made federal) but in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made,- not with their consent, fbut by others  
against their consent; and this would be to surrender  
the form of government we havefchosennd live un­  
uer one deriving its powers from jite will, and not from  
our authority ; and that the coStates recurring to their  
natural rights not made federal, yill concur in tleclar-  
iug these void and of no force, and will&#x27; each unite with  
this commonwealth in requestih  
their repeal at the  
next session of Congress

&quot; An act oxma&#x27;rping aliens,&quot; which assumes power  
over alien! hot delegated by the Constitution, is not  
law but 4 altogether vpid and of no force. ,  
5. Resolced, That m addition to the general prin  
ciple as well as the express declaration, that powers  
not delegated are reserved, anotner ana more special,  
provision inferred in the Constitution, from abundant  
Caution h;is declared, &quot;that the -.migration or impor­  
tation of siuch persons as any of the States now exists  
ing; shall thuik proper , to admit, shall not be pro­  
hibited by ie G-mgress prior to the year 1808.&quot;  
That this rommou wealth does admit the migration oi  
ailen friends described jas the, subject of the said act  
concerning a iens ; that 9. provision against prohibiting  
their migration, IS a.&#x27; provision agaiiibb an uuis cquiva.  
lent thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to re­  
move them when migrated is equivalent to a prohi­  
bition of the migration, and is, therefore, contrary to  
the said provision of the Constitution, and void  
. 6. Resdved, That, the imprisbnment of a person  
Under ;t,he &#x27;protection of the laws bf tlris common­  
wealth or his failure to obey the. simple order of the  
,Presidenlt to depart out of the - United States, as is  
undertaken by the said act, entitled, &quot; An act con­  
cerning aliens,&quot; is contrary to the Constitution, one  
amendment in which has provided, that &quot;no person  
shall; be deprived of their liberty without due process  
of law&quot; and that another having provided &#x27;&quot;that in  
all crimiialj prosecutions, the accused, shall enjoy the  
right of a public trial by an impartial jury, to be in­  
formed asto1 the nature and causejof the accusation, to  
be confronted with thej witnesses against him, to have  
compulsgryj process for obtaining witnesses in his  
favor, arid to have assistance 01 couasei ior-msue-,  
fense,&quot; j fiiej same act undertaken to authorize the  
President to remove a person out ot the united btates  
who is under &#x27;the. protection of the law, on his own  
suspicibii, without jury, without public trial; without  
confrdntation of the witnesses against -him, without  
having, witnesses in his favor, without defense, with­  
out courjsel, is contrary to those provisions, also of the  
constitution, is therefore not a law, but utterly void,  
and of rio force. j&#x27; , . .&#x27;  
That transferring the power of judging any person  
who is kinder the protection ; of the . laws, from the  
quirts to the Presidents of the United States as is un-  
dertakeij bv the same act c mcerning aliens, is against  
the article of the constitution which provides that  
&quot; the judicial power of the United States thall be vest  
ed iu the courts, the judges of which shall hold their  
office, during good behavior,&quot; and the-said act is void  
for that;reason also, and it is further to be noted that .  
this traasfer of the judiciary power is to that magis­  
trate of I the general government who- already possess  
all thie xebutive, and qualified negative in all the le-,  
gislative power. t &quot;- -  
&quot; 7. Resdved, That tlse onstructipn applied by the  
general government (as as evident by sundry of their  
proceeding) to those pafts of the constitution of the  
United States, which delegate to. Congress power to  
lay audi collect taxes, duties, imports, excises; to  
pay th debts, and provide for the common defense,  
and general warfare of the United States, and to make  
all law which shall be necessary and proper, for carry  
  
ing into execution the powers vested by the; constitu­  
&#x27; tibn in the government of the United States, or any  
department thereof, goes to that destruction of all the  
limits prescribed to their power by. the constitution  
that words meant by the. instrument to be subsidiary  
only to the execution of tlie limited powers, ought not.  
to be so constructed as themselves to give unlimited  
power, nor a part so to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue of the instrument : - Tliat the proceeding of  
the general government Under color of those articles,,  
will be a fit and necessary subject for revisal and cor­  
rection at a time of greater; tranquility, .iwhile those  
specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate  
redress.- &quot; -; : , - 5-r;&quot; ;-;.j,.;, ; J :..

mitted to the Senators and Representatives in Congress  
fromi the commonwealth, who are enjoined to present  
the fame to their respective houses, andj to use their  
best endeavors to&#x27; . procure&#x27; at the next session of Con­  
gress, a repeal of the aforesaid uncoiuititutlonal and ob­  
noxious acts. , - - &#x27; ; - -.., - ..,.) , .  
9. Resdved lastly, .That the Governor of this cojn­  
monwealth be, t, and is authorized and jrequested to  
communicate the preceding resolutions to the legisla­  
tures of the. several States, to assure them that this  
commonwealth considers union for special national  
)Urposes, and particularly for those specified in their  
ate federal compact, to be friendly to the1 peace, hap­  
piness, and prosperity of all the Statesthat faithful  
to the compact, according to the plain j intent .and  
meaning in, which it was understood ancl acceded to  
by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its.  
preservation ; that it does also believe; that to take  
from the States all the . powers of self-government,  
and transfer them to a general and consolidated gov­  
ernment, without regard to the special government,  
and reservations solemnly agreed.to in that compact,  
is. not for the peace, happiness,- or prosperity of .these  
States. And that therefore, this commonwealth is  
&#x27; determined, as it doubts not its co-states) are, to sub­  
faiit to undelegated and consequently unhtnited powers  
in no man, or aody of men on earth ; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, these conlclusions flow  
from them;&#x27; that the general government may place  
any act they think proper on the list 0$ crimes and  
punish it themselves,&#x27; whether enumerated or not enu­  
merated, by the constitution cognizable by them, that  
they may transfer its cognizance to the President or,  
any other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury,&#x27; whose suspicions may be the  
evidence, his order the, sentence, his officer the execu­

ent, or to be thought  
dangerous to his or their elections or other interest,  
public or personal ; that the friendless alian has been  
selected as the safest subject of a first experiment, but  
the citizen will soon follow, or rather has already fol­  
lowed; for, -already has a sedition act marked him .as  
a prey: That these and successive acts, of the same  
character, nnless arrested on the threshnold may tend  
to drive these States into revolution and blood, and  
will furnish new calumnies against republican gov­  
ernments, and new pretexts for those who wish it to  
be believed, that man cannot be. governed but by a  
rod of iron.; that would be a dangerous delusion, were  
a confidence&#x27; in the men of our choice to&#x27; silence our  
fears for the safety of - our rights ; that i confidence is  
everywhere the parent of despotism, free government  
is founded in &#x27;jealousy and not In .confidence ; it is the  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited  
constitution to bind &#x27;down those wiiom we are  
obliged to&#x27; trust with power, that our constitution has  
accordingly fixed the limits to which and no further  
  
our confidence, mav go; and let the honest advocates  
of confidence read the alien and sedition acts, and say  
if the constitution has not been wise in fixing limits  
to the governments it created, and whether we should  
be -wise in destroying those limits? -Let him say what  
the government is, if it be not a tyranny; which the  
men of our choice have conferred on :he President,  
and the President of our choice has as sented to and  
accepted over the friendly strangers, to whom the  
mild spirit of our. country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the me 1 of our choice  
have more respected the bare suspicion!) of the Presi­  
dent thau the solid rights of innocence, the claims of  
justification, the sacred force of truth, ind the- forms  
and substance of law and justice..  
In questions of power then let no more be said of  
confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief  
by the chains of the Constitution. That this common­  
wealth does therefore call on its co-Sta ;es for an ex­  
pression of their sentiments on the ac ts concerning  
aliens, and for the punishment of certai i crimes here-  
inbefore specified, plainly declaring wheeby these acts  
are or are not authorized by the federal compact. And  
it doubts not that their sense will bfe so announced as  
to prove their attachment to liinited government,,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights and  
liberties of their co-States will be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common &#x27;bottom  
with&#x27; their own. &quot; But they will concur with this com­  
monwealth in considering the said acts as so palpably  
against the Constitution &#x27; as to amoui it to an undis­  
guised declaration, that the compact is not meant to  
be the measure of t)le power of the General Govern­  
ment, but that it will proceed in the exercise over  
.these States of all powers whatsoever. That they will  
, view this as sefzing the rights of the States and consol­  
idating them iu the hands of the General Government,  
with a power assumed to bind the Staies (not merely  
m cases made federal) but in all Cases whatsoever, by  
laws made, not with their consent, but by others  
against their consent; and this would e to surrender  
the form of government we have chosen, and live un­  
der one deriving its powers from its will, and not from  
our authority; and that the co-States recurring to their  
natural rights not made federal, will concur in declajc-  
. ing these Void and of no force, and wulj each unite with

ish treason, counterfeiting the securities and coin of  
thej. hired States, piracies and felonies committed on  
the high seas, and oflenses against the laws of na­

how fir those&#x27; abuses which cannot be separated from

licentiousness of speech and of the press may be  
abridged without lessening their useful frcdom; and  
hqw.;far those abuses which cannot be separated from  
their ise should be tolerated rather than the use be

themlves the right of protecting the same, ras this,  
statei by a law passed on the general demand of its  
citizens,, had already protected them from all human  
restrajints or interference ; and, that, , in addition to  
this &quot;general principle and express declaration, another­  
and more special provision has been made by one of  
the apdidments to the Constitution, which expressly  
declares, that &quot; Congress shall make no laws, re­  
specting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting  
the rree exeiUse xhoroof, or abridging the freedom of  
speecSi, or of the press,&quot; thereby guarding in tfeo

freedom of religion, of speech, and of the press, in­  
asmuch, that whatever violates either, throws down  
the sauctuarv&quot; whidi covers others, and that libels,  
false )ods, and defamation, equally with heresy and  
false religion,&#x27; are. withheld -from&#x27; the cognizance of  
federal tribunals;:; . That there the act of the  
Congress of the United States, passed on the 14th of  
July, 1798, entitled, f An act in addition! to the act  
cntitjled an act fur the punishment of certain f crimes

onelof the amendments to the Constitution having  
alsof declared that &quot;.the power hot delegated -to the  
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to  
tlie States, are reserved to the States respectively, or  
toi the people, the Act of the (Jongress ot Hie U mted  
States, passed the 22d day of June, 198, entitled

That this commonwealth does admit the migration of  
aiteti friends described as the subject of&quot; the said act  
coinpetnihg aliens; that a provision against prohibitiiig  
tlMeir migration, is a provision against all acts equiva­  
lent tjherctci, or it would be nugatory) that to re­  
move them when migrated is equivalent to a prohi­

the said provision of the Constitution, and rota.

under the protection of the laws of this common  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order ot the  
Fresi dent,- to depart but of the United States, as is  
umdertakn by the said act, entitled, - j&quot; An act con  
cerning aliens, as contrary to the Constitution,&quot; one  
aimendment in wliich has provided, that &quot; no person  
sSrall be deprived of their liberty without due process  
df &#x27;law&#x27;&#x27; and that another having provided &quot;that in  
all criminal prosecutions, tne accused suau enjoy me  
rjight of a piiblic trial by an impartial jury, to be in­  
lj irmed as to the nature and causejof the accusation, to  
be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have  
tjompulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his  
favoT, and to have assistance of counsel for his de-&#x27;  
iense,&quot; the same act undertaken to j authorize the  
President to remove a person out of the United States  
tvho is under th6 protection of the law; on his own  
Suspicion, without jury, without public trial, without  
coTifrontation of&#x27; the witnesses against him, without  
laving witnesses in his tavor, without detense. with  
. ,  
Vih  
vle  
vou  
ut counsel, is contrary to those provisions, also of  
onstitution, is therefore not a law, but utterly  
Kind of no force. -  
j That transferring the power of judging any peraai  
who is under the protection of the laws, from the  
courts to the Presidents of the United States as is un  
dertaken by the same act concerning aliens, is against  
the article of the constitution which providrs that  
&quot; the judicial power of the United States shall be vest­  
ed in the courts, the judges of which ishall hold their  
office during good behavior,&quot; and the said act is void  
for that reason also,&quot; and it is further to be noted that&#x27;  
this transfer of ; the judiciary power is to that magis­  
trate of the general&#x27; government who already possess  
all the executive, and qualified negative in all the le­  
gislative power. - . j &#x27;  
j 7- flesolced, That the construction applied by the  
general government (as is evident by sundry of their  
proceeding) to those parts of the constitution of the  
United States, which delegate to Congress power to  
lay. and collect taxes, duties, imports, excises; &#x27;to  
pay the debts, and provide for the common defense,  
and general warfare of the United States, and to make  
all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carry  
  
ing into execution the powers, vested by thexconstitu­  
tion in the government of the United States, or any  
department thereof, goes to that destruction of all the  
limits prescribed to their power by the constitution r  
that words meant by the instrtrment to be subsidiary  
only to the execution of the limited powers, ought notx  
to be so constructed as themselves to give unlimited  
i power, nor a part so to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue of the instrument rThatj th proceeding of  
&quot; the general government under color of those articles,.  
wiH be a fit and necessary subject jfor revisal and cor­  
rection at a time of greater tranquility,&#x27; while those  
specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate  
redress. .&#x27; -i  
8. Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be trans­  
mitted to the Senators and Representatives in Congress  
from the commonwealth, who are enjoined to present,  
the came to their; respective houses, and to use their  
best endeavors to procure at the iext session of Con­  
gress, a repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional and ob­  
noxious acts. &#x27; &#x27; 1;  
9. Resolved lastly, That the C?c vernor of this com­  
monwealth be, and is authorizec and requested to  
communicate the preceding resolutions to the legisla­  
tures of the several States, to assure them that this  
commonwealth considers union for special national  
  
&quot; purposes, and particularly for those specified in, their  
late federal compact, to be rnendly to the peace, hap­  
piness, and prosperity of all the States that faithful  
to the compact, according to the plain &#x27; intent and  
meaning in which it was undersjtood and acceded to  
by, the several parties, it is sincerely lanxious for its  
preservation ; that it does also believe, that to take  
from the States all the . powersspf self-government,  
and transfer them to a general, and consolidated gov­  
ernment, without regard to the Special goyernment,  
and reservations solemnly agreedj to in that&quot; compact,  
is not for the peace, happiness, ojr prosperity of these  
States. And that therefore, this commonwealth is  
determined, as it doubts not its o-states are, to sub­  
mit to undelegated and consequently rmlinnted powers  
in no man, or aody of men on earth; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, . these conclusions flow  
from them ; that the general government may place  
any act they think proper on the list of crimes and  
punish it themselves, whether enumerated or not enu­  
merated, by the constitution cogpizable by them, that  
they may transfer its cognizance to the President or  
any other person, who may hiimself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, .whose t uspicions may be, the  
evidence, his order the sentence, his officer the execu­  
tioner, and his breast the sole record of the transac­  
tion ; that a very numerous ancj valuable description  
of the inhabitants of ;theseStates, being by this pre­  
cedent . reduced as out-laws to absolute dominion of  
one man, and the barriers of ;he constitution thus  
swept from us all ; no rampart now - remains against  
the passions and the power Of t . majority, of Congress  
to protect from a like exportation or rather grievous  
punishment the minority of the same (body, the legis­  
latures, judges, governors, and counsellors of the  
Statesj nor theirother peaceabl inhabitants who may  
venture to reclaim the constitutional rights and liber­  
ties of the States, and people, or who for other causes,  
good or bad, may be obnoxipn to thej view or marked  
by the, suspicions of the President, or to be thought  
dangerous to his or , their elections or other interest,  
public or personal ; that the friendless alian has been  
.selected as the safest subject ofj a first experiment, but  
the citizen will soon follow, orjrather has already fol­  
lowed; for, already has a sedition act marked him as  
a prey: That these and successive acts of the same  
character, unless arrested on the threshhold may tend  
to drive these States into revolution and blood, and  
will furnish new calumnies against republican gov­  
ernments, and new pretexts fojr those who wish it to  
be believed, that man cannot j be governed but by a  
rod of iron ; that would be a dangerous delusion were  
-. a confidence in the men of oir choice to silence our  
fears for the safety of our rights ; that confidence is  
, everywhere the parent of despotism, free government  
ie founded in jocKn.isy and not in COIllWo,-, It i  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited  
constitution to bind down those whom we , are  
obliged to trust with power, that our constitution has  
&#x27; accordingly fixed the limits to1, which and ho further  
our Confidence may go; and et&#x27;the honest advocates  
of confidence read the alien and seditiongicts, and say  
if the constitution has not been, wise in fixing limits  
to. the governments it created and whether we should  
be wise in destroying those linlits? Let him say what  
the government is, if it be not a tyranny ; which the  
men of our choice have conferred on the President,  
and the President of our choice has assented to and  
accepted over the &quot;friendly strangers, to whom the  
mild spirit of our country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men of our choice  
have more respected the bare suspicions of the Presi­  
dent thau the solid rights of innocence, the claims of  
histificatiou, the sacred force of truth, and the forms  
and substance of law and justice, r  
In questions ;of power then let no more be said of  
confidence in man, but bind liim down from mischief  
by the chains of the Constitution. That this common-  
wealth does therefore call on its co-States for an ex  
.pression of their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for the pmiishmentqf certain crimes here­  
inbefore specified, plainly declaring whereby these acts  
are or are not authorized by the federal compact. And  
it doubts not that their sense will be so announced as  
to; prove their attachment; to limited government,  
whether .general or particular, and that the rights and  
liberties bf their co-States will be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own. But they will concur with this com­  
monwealth in considering tije said acts as so palpably  
acramst the uonstitution as to amount to an unuis  
guised declaration, that the  
compact is not meant to  
be the measure&#x27; of the1 power of the General Govern  
ment, but that it will proceed in the exercise over  
these States of all powers whatsoever, lhat they will  
view this as seizing the rights of the States and consol  
idating them in the hands of the General, Government,  
with a power assumed to bind the States (not merely  
in cases made federal) but in all pases whatsoever, by  
laws made, not. with their consent, but by others  
against their consent; and this would be.to surrender  
the form of government we have chosen, and live un­  
der one deriving its powersifroni its will, and not from  
our authority; and that the ico-States recurring to their  
natural rights not made federalwill concur in declar­  
ingthese void and of no fofpe, and will eachunitewith  
this commonwealth in requesting their repeal at the-  
next session of Congress, j&#x27;

aliens, and for the punishment of certain crimes here­

are or are not authorized by the federal compact. Aud  
it doubts not that their sense will bfe so announced as  
to tiro e therr attachment to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and tjhat the&#x27; rights and  
liberties ; of their co-States will be  
gers by remaining embarked on  
exposed to no dan-  
ai common bottom  
with their own. But they will concur with this com  
monwealth in: considering the said acts as So palpably  
against the Constitution as to Amount to an undis­  
giused declaration, that the compact is not meant to  
le the :neasure of the power of &#x27;the j General Govern­  
ment, but that it will proceed in&#x27;the &#x27; exercise over  
these States of all powers whatsoever. That they will  
view tl is as seizing1 the rights of ihie States and consol­  
idating1 them in the hands of the Geperal Governrnent,  
With a power; assumed to bind the jStates (not merely  
in cases made! federal) but in all ases whatsoever, by  
laws made, not with their consefit, but by others  
against their Consent; and this would be to surrender  
the form of government we have&#x27; chosen, and live un  
der one deriving its powers from jit$ will, and not from  
our. authority); and that the co-states recur rmg to their  
natural richts not made federal, will concur in declar  
ing these voii and of no force, and will each unite with  
this commonwealth in requesting iheir repeal at the  
next session of Congress

of the t xtent of the powers delegated to itself ; since  
that -w 3uld have made its discretions and not the

t,he United States, piracies and felonies icommit ted on  
the high seas,&#x27; and-, offenses against the laws of na­

true, as a generah principle, and one ?of the amend­

Constitution,&#x27; nor. prohibited by it to the States, &#x27;are  
reserve to the States resiiectiyely, or to &#x27;the. people, &quot;  
therefore also, the same act of Congress, passed on  
the 14t$i day of July, J798, and entitled, &quot; An act in

how far those a

be tolerated rather. than the use be  
destroyed, - arid  
thus . also they guarded against all

to the governments it created, and whether w e. should&quot;  
be wise in destrdying those limits ? Let&#x27;him- say what  
the government is&#x27;, if it be not a tyranny ; which the  
men of our choice have conferred on the President,  
aiid the President of our choice has I assented , to and  
accepted over the friendly strangers, Jto whom, the  
mild spirit ot our country and its laws have pledged  
h spitali&#x27;ty and protection ; that the mep of our choice  
have more respected the bare suspicions of the Presi­  
dent than the solid rights of innocence,; the claims of  
ustification, the Isacred force of truth, and the forms  
and substance, of law and justice: j j  
In ouestions of power then let no jmore be said ot  
confidence in man, but bind him dowfn ifrom mischief  
by the chains of! the Constitution. That this common  
wealth does therefore call on its co-States lor an ex­  
pression of their&#x27; sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for the punishment of certain crimes here­  
inbefore specified, plainly declaring whereby these acts  
a rev of are not authorized by the federal corn pact. And  
it doubts not that their sense will be so announced as  
to prove their j attachment to limited government,  
w hetlier generator particular, and that the rights and  
liberties of their co-States will be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked- on a j common bottom  
with their own. But they , will concur-with&#x27; this com  
monwealth in considering the said acjts1 as so palpably  
against the Constitution as to amount to an undis  
guised declaration, that the compact is not meant to  
be the measure of the power of the prejneral Govern­  
ment, but that it will proceed in the! exercise over  
these States of all powers whatsoever. That they will  
view this as seizing the rights ot the States and consol  
idating them in the hands of the General Government,  
with a power assumed to bind the States (not .merely  
in cases made federal) but in all easels, whatsoever, by  
laws made; not with their consent, hut by others  
against their consent; and this would pe to surrender  
the form of government we have chosen, and live un­  
der one deriving its powers from its will, and not from  
our authority ; arid that the co-States! recurring to their  
natural rights njt made federal, will fconcur in declar­  
ing these void arid of no force, and will each unite with  
this commonwealth in requesting their, repeal at the  
next session of Congress. ;

ed States, having delegated to Congress a power  
to punish treason, counterfeiting the securities  
and current coin of the United States, piracies  
and felonies committed on the high seas, and  
offences against the laws of nations, and no other  
crimes whatever; and it being true as a general  
principle, and one of the amendments to the Con­  
stitution having also declared ‘‘that the powers  
not delegated to the United States by the Con­  
stitution. nor prohibited by it to the Slates, are  
reserved to the States respectively, or to the peo­  
ple;” therefore also, the same act of Congres ,  
passed on the 14th day of July, 1798. and entitl­  
ed‘&#x27;An Act in addition to the Act entitled‘An  
Act for the punishment of certain crimes against  
the United Slates;’ ” as also the act passed by  
them on the 27th day of Juno, 1798, entitled  
•‘An Act to punish frauds committed on the Bank  
of the United States,” (and all other their acts  
which assume to create, define or punish crimes  
other than those enumerated in the Constitution)  
ire altogether void, and of no force; and that  
the power to create, define and punish such other  
crimes is reserved, and of right appertains, solely  
ai d exclusively, to the respective States, each  
within its own territory.  
3. Resolved, That it is true as a general prin­  
ciple, and is also expressly declared by one of  
the amendments to the Constitution, that “the  
powers not delegated to the United States by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,  
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the  
people;” and that, no power over the freedom of  
religion, freedom of speech, or freedom of the  
press, being delegated to the United Slates by  
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, all lawful powers respecting the same,did  
of right remain, and were reserved to the Stales  
or to the people; and thus was manifested their  
determination to retain to themselves the right  
of judging how far the licentiousness of speech  
an of the press may be abridged, without les­  
soning their useful freedom, and how far those  
abuses which cannot be separated from their use.  
should be tolerated rather than the use be de­  
stroyed; and thus also they guarded against all  
abridgment, by the United States, of the freedom  
of religious principle s and exercises, and retained  
to themselves the right of protecting the same,  
as this, stated by a law passed on the general de­  
mand of its citizens, had already protected them  
from all human restraint or interference; and that  
in addition to this general principle and express  
declaration, another and more special provision  
has been made by one of the amendments to the  
Constitution, which expressly declares that ‘&#x27;Con­  
gress shall make no laws respecting an establish­  
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise  
thereof, or abridging the freedom of spceca or  
of th 3 press;” thereby guarding, in the same  
sentence and under the same words, the freedom  
of religion, of speech and of the press, insomuch  
that whatever violates either, throws down the  
sanctuary which covers the others,—and that  
libels, falsehood and defamation, equally with  
heresy ami false religion, are withheld from the  
cognizance o federal tr bunals. That, therefore,  
the act of Congress ol the United States, passed  
on the 14lli of July. 1798. entitled &#x27;“An Act in  
addition to the Act entitled &#x27;An Act for the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United  
States.”&#x27; which does abridge the freedom of the  
press, is not law, but is altogether void and of no  
force  
  
4. Resolved, That ulicn friends are under the  
juristlicti&gt; n and protection ol the laws of the  
State wherein they are; that no power over them  
has lieen delegated to the United States, nor pro­  
hibited to the individual States, distinct from  
power over citizens; and it being true, as a gene­  
ral principle, and one ol the amendments to the  
Constitution having also declared, that “the pow­  
ers not delegated to the United Slates by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited to the States, are, re­  
served to the States respectively, or to the peo­  
ple,” the act ol Congress of the United Slates,  
passed the 22d day of June, 17118. entitled &quot;An  
Act concerning Aliens.” which assumes power  
over alien friends not delegated by the Constitu­  
tion. is not law, but is altogether void and of no  
force.  
H. Resolved. That in addition to the general  
principle, as well as the express declaration, that  
powers not delegated are reserved, another and  
more special provision inserted in the Constitu­  
tion from abundant caution, has declared “that  
(he migration or importation of such persons as  
any of tin&#x27; Stales now existing shall think proper  
to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress  
prior to the year 1808.” That this Common­  
wealth does admit the migration of alien friends  
described as the subject ol the said act concerning  
aliens; that a provision against prohibiting their  
migration is a provision against all acts equiva­  
lent thereto, or it would be nugatory: that to re­  
move them, when migrated, is equivalent to a  
prohibition of their migration, and is. therefore,  
contrary to the said provision of the Constitution,  
and void.  
(i. Resolved, That the imprisonment of a per  
ron under the protection of th&quot; laws of this Com­  
monwealth, on his failure to obey the simple  
order of the President to depart out ol the Unit­  
ed States, as is undertaken by the said act entitl­  
ed “An Act concerning Aliens,” isconfrary to  
the Constitution, one amendment in which is pro­  
vided that &#x27; no person shall be deprived of liber­  
ty without due process of law;” and that another  
having provided “that in all criminal prosecu­  
tio s. the accused shall enjoy the right of a pub­  
lic trial by an impartial jury, to be informed as to  
the nature and cause ol the accusation, to be con­  
fronted with the witnesses against him, to have  
compulsory process (or obtaining witnesses in his  
favor, and&#x27;to have assistance of counsel for his  
defense,” the same act undertaking to authorize  
the President to remove a person out of the Unit­  
ed States who is under the protection of the law.  
on his own suspicion, without jury, without puli  
lie trial, without confrontation of the witnesses  
against him. without having witnesses in his  
favor, without defense, without counsel.—contra*  
ry to these provisions, also, ol the Constitution   
is therefore not law, but u.terly void and of no  
force. . , .  
The transferring the power of judging any per­  
son who is under the protection of the laws. Irom  
the Courts, to the President ot the United States,  
as is undertaken by the same act concerning  
aliens, is against the article of the Constitution  
which provides that “the judicial power of the  
United States shall be vested in the Courta. the  
judges of which sh&#x27;ll bold thf&#x27;T officer during

good behavior,” and that (he said act Is void for  
that reason also; and it is further to be noted,  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive and a qualified  
negative in all the legislative powers.  
7. Resolved, That the construction applied by  
the general government (as is evident by sundry  
of their proceedings) to those parts of the Con­  
stitution of the Linked States which delegate to  
Congress power to lay and collect taxes, duties,  
imposts, excises, to pay the debts, ami provide  
for the common defense and general welfare of  
of the United States, and to make all laws w hich  
shall be necessary and proper lor carrying into  
execution the powers vested by the Constitution  
in the government of the United States, or any  
department thereof, goes to the destruction of all  
the limits prescribed to their power by the Con­  
stitution: that words meant by that instrument to  
be subsidiary only to the execution of the limited  
powers, ought not to be so construed as them­  
selves lo give unlimited,&#x27;tor a part so to be taken  
as to destroy the whole residue of the instrument;  
that the proceedings of (he general government,  
under color of those articles, will be a fit and  
necessary subject for revisal and correction at a  
time of greater tranquility, while those specified  
in the preceding resolutions call for immediate  
redress.  
8. Resolved That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the Senators and Representatives  
in C ngress from this Commonwealth, who are  
enjoined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of Congress, a repeal of the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
  
9. Hesolvtd. Lastly. That the Governor of this  
Commonwealth he, stud is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding rest lotions to  
the Legislatures of the several States, to assure  
them that this Commonwealth considers union  
for special national purposes, and particularly  
for l -ose specified in their late federal compact,  
to be friendly to the peace, happiness and pros­  
perity of all the States; that, faithful to that  
compact, according to the plain intent and mean­  
ing in which it was understood and acceded to  
by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for  
its preservation; that it does not believe that,  
to take from the States all the powers of self­  
government. anal transfer them to a general and  
consolidated government, without regard to the  
special government, and reservations solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace,  
happiness or prpsperityof these States; and that  
therefore, this Commonwealth is determined, as  
| it doubts not its co-State,s are, to submit to un­  
delegated and consequently unlimited powers in  
no man or body of men on earth; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, those conclusions  
would How from them; that the general govern­  
ment may place any act they think proper on the  
list of crimes, and punish it themselves, whether  
enumerated or not enumerated by the Constitu­  
tion as cognizable by them; that they may trans­  
fer its cogniz nice to the (’resident or any other  
person, who may himself he the accuser, counsel,  
judge and jury, whose suspicions may be evidence,  
his order the sentence, his officer the executioner,  
and bis breast the sole record of the transaction;  
that a very numerous and valuable description  
of the inhabitants of these States, being by this  
precedent, reduced as onth wh to absolute domi­  
nion of one man, and the harriers of the Consti­  
tution thus swept from us all, no rampart now  
remains against the passions and the power of a  
majority of Congress, to protect from a like ex­  
portation, or other grievous punishment, the mi­  
nority of the same body, the legislatures judges,  
governors, an 1 counselors ot the States, nor their  
own peaceable inhabitants, who may venture to  
reclaim the Constitutional rights and lb ci ties ol  
the States and people, or who, for other causes,  
good or bad, may be obnoxious to the view or  
marked by the suspicions of the President, or be  
thought dangerous to Ins or their elections or  
other interests, publicor personal; that the friend­  
less alien has been selected as the safest subject  
of a first experiment; but the citizen will soon  
follow, or ratter has already followed; for already  
has a sedition act marked him as a spy;—that  
these and successive acts of the same character,  
unless arrested on the threshold, may tend to  
drive these States into revolution and blood,  
an I will furnish new calumnies against icpubli­  
can governments, and new pretexts for those who  
wish it to he believed that man cannot be govern­  
ed but by a rod of iron;—that it would be a  
dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men  
of onr choice to silence our fears for the safety  
of onr rights; that confidence is everywhere the  
parent of despotism; free government is founded  
in jealousy, and not in confidence; it is jealousy,  
and not confidence, which prescribes limited con­  
stitutions, to bind down those whom we are oblig­  
ed to trust with power; that our Condlitution lias  
accordingly fixed tiie limits to which, and no fur­  
ther, onr confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate o confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say if the Constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it created, and  
whether we should he wise in destroying those  
limits; let him say what the government is, if it  
he not a tyranny, which the men of our choice  
have conferred on the President, and the Presi­  
dent of our choice has assented to and accepted,  
over the friendly strangers to whom the mild  
spirit of onr country and its laws had pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men of onr  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
(lie President than the solid rights of innocence,  
the claims of justification, the sacred force ol  
truth, and the tonus uud substance of law and  
justice.  
In questions of power, then, let no more be said  
of confidence in man, but bind him down from  
mischief by the chains of the Constitution.  
That this Commonwealth does, therefore, call  
on its co-State- for an expression of their senti­  
ments on the acts concerning aliens, end (ortho  
punishment of certain crimes, herein-before spe­  
cified, plainly declarb g whether these acts are  
or are not authorized by the federal compact.  
And it doubts not that their sense will he so an­  
nounced as to prove their attachment to limited  
government, whether general or particular; and  
that the rights and liberties of their co-States  
will be exposed to no dangers by rein lining em­  
barked on a common bottom with their ow ; but  
they will concur with this Commonwealth in con­  
sidering the said acts as so palpably against the  
Constitution as to amount b. an undisguised de­  
claration that the compact is not meant to be the  
measure of the powers of the general govern­  
ment. but that it will proceed in the exercise over  
these Slates of all powers whatsoever.  
That they will view this as seizing the rights  
of the States, mil consolidating them in the hands  
of the general government, with a power assumed  
to bind the States, not merely in cases made fede­  
ral, but in all cases whatsoever, by laws made,  
not with their consent, but by others against their  
consent; that this would be to surrender thq form  
of government we have chosen, and live under  
one deriving its powers from its own will, and  
riot from our authority; and that the co-State«,  
recurring to their na ural rights not made fede­  
ral. will concur in declaring these void and of no  
fof-ce. and will each unite with this Common­  
wealth in requesting their repeal at the next ses­  
sion of Congress

declared, &#x27;-that the powers not delegated to  
the United States by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved  
to the States respectively, or to the people,&quot;  
therefore, also, the same ant of Congress,  
passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and  
entitled, &quot;An act in additiou to the act enti­

and that the power to create, define and  
punish such other crimes is reserved, and of

3. Resolved, That it is true, as a general  
principle, and is also expressly declared by  
One ot the amendments to the Constitution,  
that &#x27;-the powers not delegated to the United  
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by  
it to the States, are reserved to the States re­  
spectively or to the people and. that no

gated to the United States by the Constitu­  
tion, nor prohibited by it to the States, all

termination to retain to themselves the right  
of judging how lar tlie licentiousness of speech  
and of the press maybe abridged without  
lessening their useful freedom and how far  
those abuses which cannot be separated from  
their use should be tolerated rather than use

against all abridgment by the United States,  
of the freedom of religious principles and ex­  
ercises, and retained to themselves the right  
  
the general demand ot its citi-  
  
zene, had already protected them from all  
human restraints or interference and, that,  
in addition to this genesal principle and ex­  
press declaration, another and more special  
provision has been made by one of the amend­  
ments to th&#x27;« Constitution, which expressly  
declares, that &quot;Congress shall make no laws,  
respecting the establishment of religion, or  
prohibiting the free exercise thereat, or ab­  
riging the freedom of speech or of the prebs,&quot;  
thereby guarding in the same sentence, and  
under the same words, the freedom of reli­  
gion, of Bpeech, and of the press, inasmuch,  
that whatever voilates either, throws down  
the sanctuary which covers others, and that  
libels, falsehoods, and infamation, equality  
with heresy and false religion, are withhold  
from the cognizance ot federal tribunals.  
That therefore the act of the Congress of the  
  
United States, passed on the 14th of July,  
1798, entitled, &quot;An act in addition to the act  
entitled an act for the punishment of oertain

department thereof, goes to the destruction  
ot all the limits prescribed to their power by  
the Constitution—that words meant by the  
instrument to be subsidiary only to the execu­  
tion of the limited powers, ought not to be so  
constructed as themselves te give unlimited  
power, nor a part so to be taken, as to de­  
stroy the whole residue of the instrument  
That the proceedings of the Genera^ Govern­  
ment under color of those articles, will be fit  
and necessary subject for revisal and correc­  
tion at a time of greater tranquility, while  
those specified in the preceding resolutions  
call for immediate redress.  
8. Resolved, That tho preceding resolu­  
tions be transmitted to uio Senators and  
Representatives in Congress from the com­  
monwealth. who are enjoined to present the  
same to their respective houses, nnd to use  
their best endeavors to procure at the next  
session of Congress, a repeal of the aforesaid  
unconstitutional obnoxious acts.  
9. Resolved lastly, that the Governor of  
this commonwealth be. and is authorized and  
requested to communieate the preceding res­  
olutions to the legisltures ofthe several States,  
to assure them that this commonwealth con­  
siders union for special national purposes and  
particularly for those specified in their late  
federal compact, to be friendly to the peace,  
happiness, and prosperity of all the States—  
that faithful to the compact, according to  
the plain intent and meaning in which it was  
understood and acceded to by the several  
parties, it is sincerely anxious for its preser­  
vation that it does also believe, that to take  
from the States all the powers of self-govern­  
ment, aid transfer them to a general and  
consolidated government, without regard to  
special government and reservations sol­  
emnly agreed to in that compact^ is not for  
the peace, happiness and prosperity of those  
  
States. And that therefore, this common­  
wealth is determined, as it doubts not its co­  
States are, to submit to undelegated and  
consequently unlimited powers in no mau,  
or body ef men on earth that if the acts be­  
fore specified should 6tand, these conclusions  
flow trotn them, that the general govern­  
ment may place any act they think proper on  
the list ra,crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by  
the Constitution, cognizable by thea, that  
they may transfer the cognizance to the  
President or any other person, whonaaay  
himself lie the acouser, counsel, judge or ju­

it created, and whether we should be wise in  
destroying those linrts? Let him say what

In questions of power then let no more be  
said of confidence in nan. but bind him down

2. Resolved, That the Constitution of  
the United States having delegate! to  
Congress a power to punish treason, coun­  
terfeiting the securities and coin of the  
United States, piracies and felonies com­  
mitted on the high seas, and offences  
against the laws of nations, and no other  
crimes whatever, and it being true, a  
general principle, and one of the amend­  
ments to the Constitution having also&#x27; de­  
clared, “ that the powers not delegated to  
the United States by the Constitution, ror  
prohibited by it to the States, are reser.od  
to the States respectively, or to the peo­  
ple,” therefore, also, the same act of Con­  
gress, passed on the 14th day of July,  
1798, and entitled, “ an act in addition to  
the act entitled an act for the punishment  
for certain crimes against the United  
States as also, the act passed. W -*LNfn  
vne Jtiu ui Juno, i/&#x27;Jo, entitled, “an  
, act to punish frauds committed on the  
banks of the United States,” (and -all  
other of their acts which assume to create,  
define, or punish crimes others than those  
enumerated in the Constitution) are al­  
together void and of no force, and that  
the power to create, define and punish such  
other crimes is reserved, and of right ap­  
pertains solely and exclusively to the res­  
pective States, each within its own territory.  
8. Resolved, That it is true, as a gener­  
al principle, and is also expressly declared  
by one of the amendments to the Consti­  
tution, that “ the powers not delegated to  
the United states by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the States, arc reserved  
to-the States respectively or to the people:”  
and that no power over the freedom of  
religion, freedom of speech, or freedom of  
the press being delegated to the United  
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited  
by it to the States, all lawful powers re­  
specting the same did of right remain, and  
were reserved to the States or people ; and  
thus was manifested their determination  
Jo retain to themselves the right of judg­  
ing how far the licentiousness of speech  
and of the press may bo abridged without  
lessening their useful freedom; and how  
far those abuses which cannot be separa­  
ted from their use should be tolerated  
rather than be destroyed, and thus al­  
so they guarded against all abridgement  
by the United States, of the freedom of  
religions principles and exercises, and re­  
tained to themselves the right of protect­  
ing the same, as this, stated by a law pas­  
sed on the general demand of its citizens,  
had already protected them from all hu­  
man restraints or interference; and, that,  
in addition to this general principle and  
express declaration, another and more  
special provision has been made by one of  
  
the amendments to the Const tution, which  
expressly declares, that “ Congress shall  
make no laws, respecting an establishment  
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise  
thereof, or abridging the freeeom of  
speech or of the press,” thereby guarding  
in the same sentence, and under the same  
words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, inasmuch, that whatever  
violates either, throws down the sanctuary  
which covers others, and that libels, false­  
hoods and infamation, equally with heresy  
and false religion, are withheld from the  
federal tribunals. That  
therefore tno act of the Congress of the  
United States, passed on the 14th of July,  
1798, entitled “ An act in addition to the  
act entitled an act for the punishment of  
certain crimes against the United States,”  
which docs abridge the freedom of the  
press, is not law, but is altogether void and  
of no force.  
4. Resolved, That alien friends are un­  
der the jurisdiction and protection of the  
laws of the State wherein they are; that  
no power over them has been delegated to  
the United States, nor prohibited to the  
individual States distinct from their powers  
over citizens. And ct hciaC trrty mr. ir-gcnr  
erai principle, and one of the amendments  
to the Constitution having also declared  
that “ the powers not delegated to the  
United States by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited to the States, are reserved to  
the States respectively, or to the people,”  
the act of the Congress of the United  
States, passed the 22d day of June. 1798,  
assumes power over aliens not delegated  
by the Constitution, is not law, but is al­  
together void and of no force.  
5. Resolved, That in addition to the  
general principle as well as the express  
declaration, that powers not delegated are  
reserved, another and more special pro­  
vision inferred in the Constitution, from  
abundant caution, has declared, “ that the  
migration or importation of such persons  
as any ot the States now existing shall  
think proper to admit, shall not be pro­  
hibited by the Congress prior to the year  
1808 that this Commonwealth does ad­  
mit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject of the said act concerning  
aliens; that a provision against prohibiting  
their migration, is a provision against ail  
acts equivalent thereto, or it would be  
nugatory; that to remove them when mi­  
grated is equivalent to a prohibition of the  
migration, and is, therefore contray to the  
said provision of the Constitution, and void.  
6. Resolved, That the imprisonment of  
a person under the protection of the laws  
of this commonwealth on his failure to  
obey the simple order of the President; to  
depart out of the United States, as is under­  
taken by the said act, entitled “ An act  
concerning aliens,” is contrary to the Con­  
stitution, one amendment in which has  
provided, that no persons shall be deprived  
of their liberty without due process of  
law,” and that another having provided  
“ that in all criminal prosecutions the ao- :  
cosed shall enjoy the right of a public trial ;  
  
by an impartial jury, to be informed as to  
the nature and cause of the accusation, to  
be confronted with the witnesses against  
him, to have compulsory process for obtain­  
ing witnesses in his favor, and to have as­  
sistance of counsel for his defense,” the  
same act undertaking to authorize, the  
President to remove a person out of the  
United States who is under the protection  
of the law, on his own suspicion, without  
jury, without public trial, without confron­  
tation of the witnesses in his favor, with­  
out defense, without counsel, is contrary to  
these provisions, also of the Constitution,  
and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no force. That transferring  
the power of judgment of any person who is  
under the protection of the laws, from the  
courts to the President of the United  
States as is undertaken by the same act  
concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the Constitution which provides that “the  
judicial power of the United States shall  
be vested in the Courts, the judges of  
which shall hold their office during good  
behavior,” and the said act is void for that  
reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that this transfer of the judiciary power is  
to-JJiat Tfmgiblrftto-cdHtlis .GeneralGdvern­  
ment who already possesses all the execu­  
tive, and qualified negative in all the legis­  
lative powers.  
l. Resolved, That the construction ap­  
plied by the General Government (as is  
evident by sundry of their proceedings) to  
those parts of the Constitution of the Uni­  
ted States, which delegate to Congress  
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im­  
posts, excises; to pay the debts and pro­  
vide for the common defense and general  
welfare of the United States, and to make  
all laws which shall be necessary and prop­  
er for carrying into execution the powers  
vested by the Constitution in the Govern­  
ment of the United States, or any depart­  
ment thereof, goes to the destruction of  
all the limits prescribed to their power by  
the Constitution—that words meant by  
the instrument to be subsidiary only to  
the execution of the limited powers, ought  
not to be so constructed as themselves to  
give unlimited power, nor a part so to be  
taken, as to destroy the whole residue of  
the instrument:—That the proceedings of  
the General Government under color of  
those articles, will be fit and necessary  
subjects for revisal and correction at a time  
of greater tranquility, while those speci­  
fied in the preceding resolutions call for  
immediate redress  
8. Resolved, That the preceding reso­  
lutions be transmitted to the Senators and  
Representatives in Congress from this Com­  
monwealth, who are enjoined to present  
the same to their respective Houses, and  
to use their best endeavors to procure at  
the next session of Congress, a repeal of  
the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnox­  
ious acts.  
9. Resolved, lastly, that the Governor  
of this commonwealth be, and is author­  
ized and requested to communicate the  
preceding resolutions to the legislatures of

government, and transfer them to a gen­

out regard to the special government, and  
reservations solemnly agreed to in that

therefore, this commonwealth, is determi­

from them, that the general Government  
may place any act they think proper on

whether enumerated or not enumerated by

they may transfer its cognizance to the

less alien has been selected as the safest  
subject of his first experience, but the citi­  
zen will soon follow, or rather has already  
followed; for already has a sedition act  
marked him as a prey. That these and  
successive acts of the same character, un­  
less arrested on the threshold may tend to  
drive these States into revolution and

against republican governments and new  
pretexts for those who wish to be believed  
that man cannot be governed but by a rod  
of iron ; that would be a dangerous delu­  
sion were a confidence in the men of our  
choice to silence our fears for the safety of  
our rights ; that confidence is ererywhere  
the parent of despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confi­  
dence ; it is the jealousy and not confi­  
dence which prescribes limited constitu­  
tion to bind down those whom we are  
obliged to trust with power, that our con­  
stitution has fixed the limits to which and  
no further our confidence may go; and let  
the honest advocates of confidence read the  
alien and sedition acts, and say if the co.i­  
stitution has not been wise in fixing limits  
to the government it created, and whether  
we should be wise in destroying those lim­  
its? Let him say what the government  
is, if it be not a tyranny, which the men  
of our choice have conferred on the Presi­  
dent, and the President of our choice has  
assented to and accepted over the friendly  
strangers, to whom the mild spirit of our  
country and its laws have pledged hospi­  
tality and protection; that the men of our  
choice have more respected the suspicions  
of the President than the solid rights of  
innocence, the claims of justification, the  
sacred force Cf truth, and the forms and  
substance of law and justice.

In questions of power then let no more

down from m ischief by the chains or the  
Constitution. That this commonwealth  
does therefore call on its co-States for an  
expression of their sentiments on acts con­  
cerning aliens, and for the punishment of  
certain crimes hereinbefore specified, plain­  
ly declaring whereby these acts are or are  
not authorized by the federal compact.—  
And it doubts not that their sense will be  
so announced as to prove their attachment  
to limited government, whether general or  
particular, and that the rights and liber­  
ties of their co-States will be exposed to no  
dangers by remaining embarked on a com­  
mon bottom with their own. But they  
will concur with this commonwealth in  
considering the said acts as so palpable  
against the Constitution as to amount to  
an undisguised declaration, that the com­  
pact is not meant to be the measure of the  
power of the General Government but  
that it will proceed in the exercise over  
these States of all powers whatsoever.—  
That they will view this as seizing the  
rights of the States and consolidating them  
in the hands of the General Government,  
with a power assumed to bind the States  
(not raerelj’ in cases made federal) but in  
all cases whatsoever, by laws made, not  
with their consent, but by others against  
their consent; and this would be to sur­  
render the form of government we have  
chosen, and living under one deriving its  
power from its will, and not from our au­  
thority; and that the co-States recurring  
to their natural rights not made federal,  
will concur in declaring these void and &quot;of  
no force, and will each unite with this com­  
monwealth in requesting their repeal at

the Constitution, the measure of its powers;  
but that, as in all other cases of compact,  
among bowers having no common judge,  
each party has an equal right to judge for itself a  
well of infractions as of the mode and measure  
of redress.  
2. Resolved, That the Constitution of the  
United States having delegated to Congress  
a power to punish treason, counterfeiting  
the securities and current coin of the United  
States, piracies and felonies committed on  
the high seas, and offenses against the law  
of nations, and, no other crime whatsoever,  
and it being true, as a general principle,  
and one of the amendments to the Constitu  
tion having also declared &quot;that the powers  
not delegated to the United States by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, are reserved to the States respective-  
ly, or to the people,&quot; therefore, the act of  
Congress, passed on the 1th day of July,  
1798, and entitled, &quot;An act in addition to  
the act entitled An act for the punishment  
of certain crimes against the United States;&quot;  
as also, the act passed by them on the 27th  
of June, 1798, entitled, &quot;An act to punish  
frauds committed on the bank of the United  
States&quot; (and all of their other acts which  
assume to create, define, or punish crimes  
other than those so enumerated in the Con­  
stitution), are altogether void and of no  
force, and that the power to create, define,  
and punish such other crimes is reserved  
and of right appertains solely and exclu  
sively to the respective States, each within  
its own territory o  
3. Resolved, That it is true, as a general  
principle, and is also expressly declared by  
OH U bHaissoliUimeiis  Nibta  
that the &quot;powers not delegated to the United  
one of the amendments to the Constitution  
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited  
by it to the States, are reserved to the States  
respectively, or to the people, and that no  
power over the freedom of religion, freetdom  
of speech or freedom of the press being delepated  
to the United Stutes by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the States, all lawful  
powers respecting the same did of right re-­  
main, and werehreserved to the States or the  
people; that thus was manifested their de­  
termination to retain to themselves the  
righs of judging how far the licentiousness  
of speech and of the press may be abridged  
without lessening their useful freedom; and  
how far those abuses which cannot be sepa­  
rated from their use should be tolerated  
rather than the use be destroyed, and thus  
also they guarded against all abridgment,  
by the United States, of the freedom of re­  
ligious opinions and exercises, and retained  
to themselves the right of protecting the  
same, as  this State, by a law passed on  
the general demand of its citizens, hads al  
ready protected them from allhuman re  
straint or interference; and that, in addie  
tion to this general principle and express  
declaration, another and more special pro  
vision has been made by one of the amendr.  
ments to the Constitution, which expressly,  
declares that &quot;Congress shall make no lawre­  
specting an establishment of religion, or prohibit­  
ing the free exercise thereofy or abridgingt the  
freedom of speech or of the press,&quot; thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under  
the same words, the freedom of religion, of  
speech, and of the press, insomnch, that  
whatever violated either, throws down the  
sanctuary which covers the others, and that  
libels, falsehoods, and defamation, equally  
with heresy and false religion, are withheld or  
the cognizance of Federal tribunals.  
therefore the act of the Congress of  
the United States, passed on the 14th July,  
1798, entitled, &quot;An act in addition to the act  
An act for thepunishment ofe  
certain crimes against the United States,ject

4. Resolved, That alien friends areiunder  
the jurisdiction and protection of the laws  
of the State wherein they are; that no power  
over them has been delegated to the United  
States, nor prohibited to the individual  
States distinct from their power over citi  
zens, and it being true as a general princl  
ple, and one of the amendments to the Con  
stitution having also declared that the

of the States now existing shall think prop­  
er to admit, shall not be prohibited by the  
Congress prior to the year 1808,&quot; that this  
commonwealth does admit the migration of  
allen friends described as the subject of the  
said act concerning aliens; that a provision  
Vision against all acts equivalent thereto;  
I it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the  
prohibition of their migration, and is there­  
ore, contrary to the said provision of the  
Constitution, and void.  
6. Resolved, That the imprisonment of a  
person under the protection of the laws of  
this commonwealth on his failure to ohay  
the simple order of the President, to depart  
out of the United States, as is undertaken  
by the said act, entitled. &quot;An act conearn-  
ing aliens,&quot; is contrary to the Constitution.  
one amendment to which has provided that  
&quot;no person shall bedeprived of Iiberty witha.  
out due process of law,&quot; and that another  
naving provided, &quot;that in all criminal pros­  
ecutions the accused shall enjoy the righ

formed of the nature and cause of the ac­  
cusation, to be confronted with the witnes  
against him, to have compulsory process

the United States who is under the protees

out accusation, without jury, without pub­  
lic trial, without confrontation of the wit­  
nesses against him, without hearing wit­  
nesses in his favor, without defence, without  
counsel, is contrary to these provisions also  
Of the Constitution, and is therefore not a  
law, but utterly void, and of no force. That  
transferring the power of judging any per  
son who is under the protection of the laws,  
from the courts to the President of the  
United States as is undertaken by the same  
concerning aliens, is against the article  
the Constitution which provides that the  
judicial power of the United States shall be  
vested in courts, the judges of which shall  
hold their offices during good behavior.&quot;  
 eet o  o oe

Government (as is evidenced by sundry of  
bhel Drocecdingsto those parts of th  
Constitution of the United States, which  
delegate to Congress a power to lay and  
collect taxes, duties, imports, excises; to  
pay the debts and provide for the common  
defense and general welfare of the United  
States, and to make all laws which shall be  
necessary and proper for carrying into ex  
ccution the powers vested by the Constitu­  
tion in the Government of the United  
States, or in any department or officer there­  
of goes to the destruction of all limits pre­  
scribed to their power by the Constitution  
that words meant by the instrument to  
subsidiary only to the execution of lim­  
ited powers, ought not to be so construeted  
themselves to give unlimited powers, nor  
part to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue of the instrument. That the pro  
ceeding of the General Government under  
color of those articles will be a fit and ne­  
cessary subject for revisal and correction at  
time of greater tranquility, while those  
specified in the preceding resolutions call  
immediate redress.  
S. Resolved, That the preceding resolutions  
transmitted to the Senators and Rep­  
resentatives in Congress from the common­  
wealth, who are enjoined to present the  
same to their respective houses, and to use  
their best endeavors to procure at the next  
session of Congress a repeal of the afore­  
said unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
0. Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of  
commonwealth be, and is authorized  
requested to communicate the preced­  
ing resolutions to the Legislatures of the  
several States, to assure them that this coms  
ea Aa     
monwealth considers union for specined ha­  
tional purposes, and particularly for those  
specified in their late Federal compact, to  
friendly to the peace, happiness, and  
prosperity of all the States- that faithful to  
compact, according to the plain intent  
meaning in which it was understood  
ceced,to hyithe soveral parties, it is  
sincerely anxious for its preservation; that  
acceded to by the several parties, it is  
does also believe, that to take from the  
States all the powers of self-Government,  
transfer them to a general and consoli-  
dated Government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, sol­  
emnly agreed to in that compact, is not for  
peace, happiness, or prosperity of these  
States. And that, therefore, this common  
wealth is determined, as it doubts not its co­  
States are, to submit to undelegated and  
consequently unlimited powers in no man,  
body of men, on earth; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, these conciu-  
sions would flow from them, that the Gen-  
Government may place any actthey  
think proper on the list of crimes and pun  
it themselves, whether enumerated or  
enumerated by the Constitution cogniz­  
able by them, that they may transfer its  
cognizance to the President or any other per-  
who may himself tbe the accuser, counsel,  
judge, and jurp, sohose suspicions may be the  
evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
 executioner, and his breast the sole  
record of the transaction, that a very  
numerous and valuable description of the  
inhabitants of these States, being by this  
precedent reduced asoutlaws to the absolute  
dominion of one man, and the barriers of  
Constitution thus swept from us all, no  
rampart now remains against the passions  
the power of a majority of Congress to  
protect from a like exportation or other  
grlevous punishment theminorityof the  
same body, the legislatures, judges, Gover­  
nors and counselors of the States, nor their  
other peaceable inhabitants who may ven  
to reclaim the Constitutional rights and  
liberties of the States and people, or who  
sooneiolow, or rather nas&#x27;afready fol  
lowed; for, already nas a sedition act mark  
him as its prey. That these and success­  
ive acts of the same character, unless ar­  
rested at the threshold may tend to drive  
these States into revolution and blood, and  
furnish new calumnles against repub  
liean government, and new pretexts for  
those who wish it to be believed that man  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron;  
bhatat would ber a dangerous delusion

limits to the Government it created,  
whether we should be wise in destroying  
those limits? Let him say what the Gov-  
ernment is, if it be not a tyranny, which  
the men of our choice have conferred on  
the President, and the President of our  
choice has assented to and accepted over  
the friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of our country and its laws have  
pledged hospitality and protection; that the  
men of our choice have respected the bare  
suspicions of the President than the solid  
rights of innocence, the claims of justifica­  
tion, the sacred force of truth, and the forms  
and substance of law and justice. Inquestion  
of powcers, then, let no more be heard of coust-  
dence in man, but bind him down from mischief  
by the chains of the Constitution. That this  
commonwealth does therefore call on its co­  
States for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for the  
punishment of certain crimes, hereinbe­  
fore specifled, plainly declaring whether  
these acts are or are not authorized by  
the Federal compact. And it doubts not  
that their sense will baleg annouuch  
reresa soniesinten; w alawuiriatlcet  
as to prove their attachment unaltered to  
lmirod govornwont thtt ctis  
siret Sovormiment, whetler general or  
particular, and that the rights and liberties  
of their co-States will be exposed to no  
dangers by remaining embarked on a com­  
mon bottom with their own. But they will  
sidaring the cald aots an eo wolell  
concur with this commonwealth in con  
o te e o e o apabe agan  
the Constitution as to amount to an undiss  
guised declaration that that compact is not  
meant to be the measure of the power of  
the General Government but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these States of  
all powers  whatsoever. That they will  
view this as seizing the rights of the States  
and consolidating them in the hands of the  
General Government, with the power as-  
sumed to bind the States (not merely in  
cases made federal) but in all cases whatso  
ever, by laws made, not with their consent,  
but by others against their consent; that  
this would be to surrender the form of Goy­  
ernment we have chosen, and living under  
one deriving its power from its own will,  
and not from our authority; and that the  
co-States recurring to their natural rights  
in cases not made federal will concur in  
declaring these void and of no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in  
requesting their repeal at the next session  
of Congress

of Congress,-passed of the 14th day of•Jely   
1798, and entitled, &quot;An act in addition to   
the act entitled &quot;Airaot for punishment of   
certain crimes against the lanited,States t&quot;-  
as also, the net passed by them on the 27th   
of dime, 1798, entitled, &quot;An act to punish   
frauds committed on the bank of the United   
States,&quot; (and all of their oilier acts which   
assume to ovate, define, or punish crimes   
other Man those Ito enumerated in the Cons­

force, and-that the power to create, define   
and punish ouch other orimes is reserved,   
and of right appertaimremiy and exclusive­  
ly to the respective States, each within its   
own territory.   
8. Resolved, That it is true as a general   
principle, and is also expressly declared by   
one of the amendments to the Constitution.   
that the &quot;powers,not delegated to tho Uni­  
ted States by theConetitution, nor prohibi­  
ted by it to the States., are reserved to the   
States respectively or to the people,&quot; and   
that no power over the freedom of religion,   
freedom of speech, or freedom of the press   
being delegated to the United States -by the   
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the   
States, all lawful powers respecting the   
same did of right remain, and were ?averred   
to the States of the people; that thus was&#x27;   
manifested their determination to retain to   
themselves the rightofjudging how far the   
lioentiousness of speech and of the press may   
-be abridged without lessening their useful   
fieedom, and how tar those abuses which   
cannot be separated from their use should   
be tolerated rather than the&#x27; se be destroy­  
ed, and thus also they guarded against &#x27;all   
abridgement, by the United Statesi of the   
freedom of religious opinions and exercises,   
and retained to themselves the right of pro­  
tecting the same as this State by a law pass­  
ed on the General demand of its citirens,had   
already protected them from all human re-.   
straint or interference, and that In addition   
to this general principle and express declar­  
ation, another and more special provision   
bee been made hyena of the amendments to   
the Constitution, which expressly declares   
that &quot;Congress shall make 110 law respec­  
ting an establishment of religion,   
lelan   
or prohibiting, „the f &#x27;t exercise   
thereof, or abridging 1,10 fr of speech

seine sentence, entriinder t e same words,   
the freedOm of religion, of speech, and of   
the press, insomuch that, whateverLyiolated   
either, throws Clown the sanctuary which   
covers the others, and that libels&#x27; falsehood   
and defamation, equally with heresy and   
false religion, are withheld from the cogni­  
sance of federal tribunals. That therefore   
the act of Congress of the Uhited&#x27; States,   
passed on the 14th Of July, -1708, &#x27;entitled   
&quot;Au act in addition to an set entitled Anact   
for the punishment of certain crimes against   
the &#x27;United States,&quot; which does abridge the   
freedoM of the press, isnot law, but is alto­  
gether void and of no force.   
4. Resolved That allion friemis are un­

States all the powers of self-government,

consequently unlimited powers in no man,

being delegated to the United .Slates by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it lo Hie .States, all  
lawful powers respecting ihe same dd ol right  
remain, and were reserved to the States or the  
people; lh.it thus was manifested their determi­  
nation to retain to themselves the right ol judg­  
ing how lar the licentiousness ol speech and of  
the press may be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom; and how lar those abuses which  
cannot be separated from their use should bo.  
tolerated rather than the use bo destroyed and  
thus also they guarded against nil abridgment,  
by the United .Moles, ol the freedom ol religions  
opinions and exercises, and retainod loHiemselves  
the right ol piotccti .g the same, as this .VI,He.  
by a law passed on the general demand ol its  
citizens, had already protected them Irom all  
human restraint or interference; and that, in ad­  
dition lo this general principle and express do  
duration, another and more special provision lias  
been made by one of the amendments to the  
constitution, which expressly declares, that Con­  
gress shall make no law re.-pecting an establish­  
ment ol it ligi prohibiting Hie free exercise  
thereof, or abridging the Ireedom of speech or ol  
the press,” thereby guarding in llio same sentence,  
and under the same words, Ihe Ireedom of reli­  
gion, ol speech, and of the press, insomuch, that  
whatever violated either, throws down the sanc­  
tuary which covers the others, and that libels,  
falsehoods and defamation, equally with heresy ;  
and false religion, arc withheld Irom the cogni­  
zance ol Federal tribunals. That Hicrelore the  
act of the Congress of the United Mates, passed  
on the Ulh of July, 179 b, entitled “an act in  
addition to the act entitled an act lor Hie punish­  
ment of certain crimesugainst the United States.”  
which does abridge the freedom of the press is  
not law, but is altogether void and of no lorce.  
4. Resolved, That alien ft tends are under the  
jurisdiction and protection of the laws ol the  
slates wherein they are; that no power over them  
lias been delegated lo the United Slates, nor  
prohibited to individual slates distinct from their  
power over citizens, and It being true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and one of the amendments lo the  
constitniion having also declared that “the pow­  
ers not delegated to the United .States are reserv­  
ed lo the stales respectively, or In the people,”  
Hie act of the Congress of Ihe United .States,  
passed the 22d day of Jaly, 179 b. assumes power  
over aliens not delegated to the constitution, is  
not law, but is altogether void and of no force.  
b. Resolved. That in addition to Hie general  
principle as well as Hie express declaration, that  
powers not delegated are reserved, another and  
more special provision inserted iu th. constitu­  
tion, Irom abundant caution has declared that  
&quot;the migration or importation of such persons as  
any of Hie .Slates now existing shall think proper  
to admit shall not bo prohibited by the Congress  
prior to the year ISOS;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as Hie subject of Hie said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent lo Hie prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is, therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
(i. Resolved. That thoimpiisonnienl ol a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on liis failure to obey the simple order of  
the [’resident, to depart out of the United .Slates,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled “an act  
concerning aliens ” iscontrary to Hie constitution,  
one amendment to which h i“ provided that &quot;no  
person shall bo deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” and that another having pro­  
vided, ‘that in all criminal prosecutions the ac­  
cused shall enjoy the right to public trial by an  
impartial jury, to be informed ol Hie nature and  
cause of the accusation, lo be confronted with  
Hie witnesses against him. lo have compulsory

without public trial, without confrontation ol the

estroy the  
Gen-ral Govei nmeiil (as is evinced by sundry of  
their proceedings) to those parts of the constitu­  
tion ol the United States, which delegate to  
Congress a power to lay and collect taxes, duties,  
imposts, excises; to pay the debts ami provide for  
the common dclence and general welfare of the  
United Slates, and to make all laws which shall  
In; necessary and proper for carrying into exeeu­  
i lion tlie powers vested by the constitution in the  
; Government of the United States, or in any de­  
[ pari muni or officer thereof, goes to the destruc­  
tion of all limits present oil to their power by the  
constitution —lli.it words meant by the instrument  
to be subsidiary only to the execution of limited  
powers, ought not to be so construed as them­  
selves to give unlimited powers, nor a part of  
them to be taken, as lo destroy the whole residue  
ol the instrument. That the proceeding ol the  
General Government under color of those articles  
will be a lit and necessary subject for revisit! and  
correction at a time of great tranquility, while  
those specified in the preceding resolutions call  
for immediate redress.  
S. Jttsulved, That the preceding resolutions lie  
transmitted lo the Senators and Representatives  
in Congress from the commonwealth, who are  
enjoined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and lo use their best endeavors to pro­  
cure at the next session ol Congress a repeal of  
the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
1) Resolved, last///. That the Governor of this  
commonwealth he, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions lo  
the legislatures of the several .States, to assure  
them that this commonwealth c&lt; insiders union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late Federal compact, lo be  
friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosperity  
ol all the .Stales ili.it laillilul lo that compact,  
according to the plain intent and meaning in  
which it was understood and acceded lo Gy the  
several parties, it is sincerely anxious for ils pre­  
servation; that il does also believe, that to take  
from the .Slat &#x27;s all the powers of self-govern­  
ment, and transfer them lo a general and consol­  
idated government, without regard to the special  
delegations and reservations, solemnly agreed to  
in that compact, is not tor the peace, happiness  
and prosperity of these .States. And Unit, there­  
fore, this commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-states are, to submit to undelo­  
gated and consequently unlimited powers in no  
man, or body ol men, on earth; that if the acts  
Ik foi e specified should stand, these conclusions  
would grow from them, that the General Gov­  
ernment may place any act they think proper on  
the list of crimes am! punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or nut enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself lie the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicious may  
ho the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, tlint a very numerous mid valua­  
ble description of t he inhabitants of these .States,  
being by this precedent reduced as oullws to the  
absolute dominion of one mm, and the barriers  
ol tlie constitution thus swept Irora us all, no  
rampart now remains against 1 lie passions and  
Ihi! power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous pun­  
ishment the minority of the same body, the legis­  
latures!, judges, governors and counselors of the  
.States, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim t ie constitutional rights  
and liberties ol the .Slates and people, or who  
for oilier causes, good or bad, may lie obnoxious  
lo the views, or marked by lire suspicious of the  
President, or lo be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; Unit the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but. the  
citizen will soon lollow. or r.tlher has already  
followed; for, already lias a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. Thai these mid successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested at the  
threshold may tend lo drive these Status into  
revolution and blood, and will furnish new calum­  
nies against republican government and new  
pretexts for those who wish it to lie believed that  
man cannot ho governed but by a rod of iron;  
(hat it would be a dangerous delusion were a  
confidence in the men ol our choice to silence  
our fears lor the safety of our lights; that con­  
fidence is everywhere the paren&#x27; of despotism;  
free government is founded in jealousy and not  
in confidence; it is jealousy and not confidence  
which prescribes limited consti 1 ntions to bind  
down those whom we are obliged to trust with  
power, I hit our constitution lias fixed Hie limits  
to which, and no further our confidence may go;  
land let the honest udvo.ate ol confidence read  
j the alien and sedition acls, and say if the oousli­  
lion lias not been wise in fixing limits to the gov-  
I eminent it created, and whether we should lie  
| wise in destroying those limits? Lot him say  
i what the government is, if it lie not a tyranny,  
which the men of our choice have conferred on  
the President, and the President of our choice has  
assented to and accepted over Ihe Iriondly stran­  
gers, to whom the mild spirit of oar country and  
ils laws have pledged hospitality and protection;  
that the men ol our choice have more respected  
the bare suspicions of I lie President thin the soldi  
rights ol innocence, the claims o I&#x27;justification,  
the snored force of truth, mid the forms and sub­  
stance of law and justice. In questions o( power,  
then, let no more be heard of confidence in man,  
but bind him down Irom mischiel by the chains  
ol the constitution. Thai lids commonwealth  
does thcrelorc call on its co states lor nil expres­  
sion of their sentiments on Iho nets concerning  
aliens, and for punishment of certain crimes,  
hereinbefore specified, plainly declaring whether  
tie so are or are notmilhorizudbythcFedur.il  
compact. And il doubts not that their sense will  
be so announced as to prove their attachment  
unaltered to limited government, whether gen­  
eral or p uticular,’ and Unit the rights and liber­  
ties ol their co-stntes will lie exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on u common bottom  
with their own. Uut they will concur with this  
commonwealth in considering the said ncls as so  
palpable against the constitution as to amount lo  
an undisguised declaration that that compact is  
not meant to be the measure ol the power of the  
General Government, but that it will proceed in  
lhe exercise over these states ol all powers what­  
soever. That they will view Ibis as seizing the  
rights of the stales and consolidating them in the  
hands ol the General Government, with the power  
assumed to bind the slates, not merely in cases  
made Federal, but iu all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made not with their consent, but by others  
against their consent; that this would be to sur­  
render the form of government we have chosen,  
and living under one deriving its power irom its  
own will, and not from onr authority; and that  
  
the co-sl.ites recurring to their natural rights in  
cases not made Federal will concur in declaring  
these void and of no force, aud will each unite  
with this commonwealth in requesting their re­  
peal at the next session of Congress

and let the honest advocate of confidence read  
the alien and sedition acts, and say if the cousti­  
lion has not been wise in fixing limits to the gov­  
ernment it created, and whether we should lie  
wise in destroying those limit.-? Let him say  
what the government is, it it be not a tyranny,  
which the men of our choice have conferred on  
the President, and the President of our choice has  
assented to and accepted over the friendly strin­  
gers, to whom the mild spirit of our country and  
its laws have pledged hospitality and protection;  
that the men of our choice have more respected  
the bare suspicions of the President than the solid  
rights ol innocence, the claims of justification,  
the sacred force ol truth, and the forms and sub­  
stance of law and justice. In questions ol power,  
thou, let iio more lie heard of confidence in man,  
tint bind him down Irom mischief by the chains  
ol the constitution. That this commonwealth  
does therefore call on its co-states lor an expres  
sion of their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for punishment of certain crimes,  
hereinbefore specified, pi duly declaring whether  
these arc or are not authorized by the Federal  
compact. And il doubts not that their sense will  
be so announced as to prove their attachment  
unaltered to limited government, whether gen­  
eral or paiticular, and that the rights and liber­  
ties of their co-states will lie exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own. lint they will concur with this  
commonwealth in considering the said acts as so  
palpable against the constitution as to amount to  
an undisguised decl iration that that compact is  
not meant to be the measure ol the power of the  
General Government, lint that it will proceed in  
l lie exercise over these slates of all powers what­  
soever. That they will view this as seizing the  
rights of the stales and consolidating them in the  
hands ol the General Government, with the power  
assumed to bind the states, not merely in cases  
made Federal, but in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made not with their consent, but by others  
against their consent; that this would be to sur­  
render the form of government wo have chosen,  
and living under one deriving its power from its  
own will, and not Irom our authority; and that  
the co-states recurring to their natural rights in  
cases not made Federal will concur in declaring  
these void and of no force, and will each unite  
with this commonwealth in requesting their re­  
peal at the next session of Congress

on the l ull d iy of duly. 1798,&quot; and entitled &quot;an  
act in addition to the act entitled an act or the  
punishment ol cerlain crimes against the United

the right ol protecting the same, as this Stale,  
by a law passed on l e general demand ol its

jurisdiction and protection of the laws ot the  
states wherein they are; lint no power over them  
bis been delegated to the United -Stales, nor  
prohibited to individual states distinct from their  
power over citizens, and it I cing true, as a gen­

constitution having also declared that &quot;Hie pow­

over aliens not delegated lo the constitution, is  
not law. but is altogether void and of no force.  
3. Resolved. That in addition to the general  
principle as well as the express ilo.-l ivalion. that

General Government (as is evinced by sundry of  
their proceedings) to those parts of the constitu­  
tion of the United Stiles, which delegate to  
Congress a power to lay and collect taxes, duties,  
imposts, excises; to pay the debts and provide lor

United States.* and to make all laws which shall  
be necessary and proper tor carrying into execu­  
tion the powers vested by the constitution in the  
Government of the United States or in any do­  
part men l or officer thereof, goes to the destruc­  
tion of all limits presented to their power by the  
constitution -that words meant by the instrument  
to be subsidiary only to the execution ut limited  
powers, ought not to be so construed as them­  
selves to give unlimited powers, nor a part of  
them to be taken, as to destroy the whole residue

Genes «ovcrnment under color of those articles  
will b iit and necessary subject lor revisal and

those specified in the preceding resolutions call  
for immediate redress.  
8. Jkcso/i&#x27;rd, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the .Senators and Representatives  
in Congress from the commonwealth, who are  
enjoined to present the same to their respective  
bouses, and lo*use their best endeavors to pro­  
cure at the next session ol Congress a repeal of  
the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
I) lieso/veil, /ast/y. That the Governor ol this  
commonwealth he, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ol the sevi ral Mutes, to assure  
them that this commonwealth emsiders union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to be  
friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosperity  
ot all the .States that faithful to that compact,  
according to the plain intent and meaning in  
which it was understood an 1 acceded to by&quot; the  
several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its pre­  
servation; tint it docs also believe. Hut to take  
I rout the .Slat -s all the powers of sell govern­  
ment. and tran&gt;ler them to a general and consol­  
idated govemm-mt, without regard to the special  
deb&#x27;g.itions ami reservations, solemnly agreed to  
in lii it compact, is not lor the peace, happiness  
and prosperity of these Males. And that, there­  
fore. this commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-states are, to submit to nudelo­  
gated and consequently unlimited powers in no  
man, or body ol men, on earth; that if the acts  
hcl ore specified should stand, these conclusions  
would grow from them, that the General Gov­  
ernment may place any act they think proper on  
the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer il&lt; cognizance to tin; President or any  
other person, who miy himself be the accuser,  
counsel, jinlg* ami jury, whose suspicious may  
be the evidence, his order the senler.ee, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the tian-aclion. that a very nnmero is and valua­  
ble description of the in&#x27;nbi t ints of these .Stales,  
being by this precedent reduced as outlws to the  
absolute dominion of one mm, and the barriers  
ol the constitution thus swept horn ns all. no  
rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous pun­  
ishment the minority ol tlie same body, the legis­  
latures, judges, governors and counselors of the  
.Slates, nor their other peaceable inli dutaiils who  
may venture to reclaim t re constitutional rights  
and liberties ot the Stales and people, or who  
lor other causes, good or bad, in iy be obnoxious  
to the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to b.* (bought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the Irieudh&#x27;ss alien his been selected as  
tin* safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon tollow, or rather lias already  
followed; for. ainudy bis i sedition act marked  
him as its prey. Thai these and successive acts  
ol the same character, unless arrested at Hie  
threshold may tend to drive these .States into  
revolution mil blood, and will furnish new calum­  
nies against republican government and now  
pretexts lor those who wis.i it to be believed that  
man cannot he governed but by a rod of iron;  
that it would be a dangeious delusion were a  
confidence in Iho men ol our choice to silence  
our fears for the salety of our rights; that con­  
fidence is every whore the pareiP of despotism;  
lice government is founded in jealousy and not  
in conlid-uico; it is jealousy and not confidence  
which prescribfs limited constitutions to haul  
down those whom wo are obliged to trust with  
powci, that our constitution has fixed the limits  
to which, and no further our confidence may go;  
and K t the honest advocate ot confidence read  
the alien and sedition ads, and say if the const!-  
lion h is not, been wise in fixing limits to the gov­  
ernment it created, and whether wo should be  
wise in destroying those limits? Lot him say  
what the government is. if it be not a tyranny,  
which the nica of our choice have conferred on  
the ProsiTmi. and the Preside it ol our choice has  
as-anted to ami accepted over the friendly stran­

then, f t no more be heard of confidence in man,  
but bind him down from mis hid by the chains  
o&lt; the constitution. That this commonwealth  
does therefore call on its co-states lor an expres  
sion of their s-miim nits on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for punishment of certain crimes,  
her&quot;inbefore specified, plainly declaring whether

esolved. That tho constitution of the Unit­  
ed States having delegated to Congress a power  
to punish treason, for counterfeiting the securities  
and current coin of the United States, piracies  
and felonies committed on the high seas, and of­  
fences against (he law of nations, and no oilier

stitution having also declared “that tho powers  
not delegated to tho United States by the con­

reserved to the States respectively, or to tho  
people,’’ therefore, the Act of Congress, passed  
on the 1-1 th day of July. 1708,&quot; and entitled “an  
act in addition to the act entitled an act lor the  
punishment ol certain crimes against (he United  
States;&quot; as also the act passed by them on the

sumes to create, define, or punish crimes other  
tiein those enumerated in the constitution,) arc  
altogether void and ol&#x27; no force, and that the  
power lo create, define, and punish such other  
crimes is reserved, and ol right appertains solely  
and &quot; lusively to the States, each withiu its own  
territory.  
ti. Resolved. That it is (rue. as a general prin­  
ciple, and is also expressly declared by one of  
the amendments lo the constitution, that the  
■ powers not delegated lo tho United States by  
the constitution, nor prohibited by it to tho States,  
are reserved to the States respectively, or lo the  
people;” and that no power over the freedom of  
religion, freedom of speech or freedom of the press  
being delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, all  
lawful powers respecting tho same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the States or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determi­  
nation to retain to themselves tho right ol judg­  
ing how far (lie licentiousness oi speech and ol  
ill&quot; press may be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom; and how tar those abuses which  
cannot lie separated from their use should lie  
tolerated rather than the use lie destroyed and  
thus also they guarded against all abridgment,  
by the United .Moles, ol the freedom of religions  
opinions and exercises, and retained to themselves  
the right ol protecting tiic same, as this .State,  
by a law passed on the general demand of its  
citizens, had already protected tln-m from all  
human restraint or interference; and that, in ad­  
dition to this general principle and express de  
duration, another and more special provision Inis  
been made by one of the amendments lo the  
constitution, which expressly declares, that Con­  
gress shall make no law respecting an establish­  
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exeruisc  
thereof, or abridging the (reedom of speech or of  
the press.” thereby guarding in tho same sentence,  
and under the same words, the freedom of reli­  
gion, ol speech, and of the press, insomuch, that  
whatever violated either, throws down the sane  
(nary which covers the others, and that libels,  
falsehoods and defamation, equally with heresy  
md false religion, are withheld from the cogni­  
zance of federal tribunals. That therefore the  
act of the Congress of the United Mates, passed  
on the 14th of July, 1708. entitled “an act in  
addition to the act entitled an act lor tho punish­  
ment of certain crimes against the United States,”  
which does abridge the freedom of the press is  
not law, but is altogether void end of no force.  
4. Resolved. That alien friends are under the  
jurisdiction and protection of tho laws of the  
states wherein they are: tli it no power over them  
has been delegated lo the United States, nor  
prohibited to individual states distinct from their  
power over citizens, and it being true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and one of the amendments to the  
constitution having also declared that &quot;the pow­  
ers not delegated to tho United States are reserv­  
ed to the stales respectively, or to the people,”  
the act of the Congress of (he United Mates,  
passed the 22d day of July, 171)8, assumes power  
over aliens not delegated to tho constitution, is  
not law. but is altogether void and of no force.  
5. Resolved. That in addition to the general  
principle as well as tho express declaration, that  
powers not delegated are reserved, another and  
more special provision inserted in the conslitu­  
tion, from abundant caution has declared that  
-the migration or importation of such persons as  
any of the Mates now existing shall think proper  
to admit shall not ho prohibited by the Congress  
prior to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject of the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would lie nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to tho prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of tho constitution,  
and void.  
ti. Resolved. That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on ins failure lo obey the simple order of  
(he I’resi.leut. to depart out of the United Matos,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled &quot;an act

person shall be deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” and that another having pro­  
vided, Him! in all criminal prosecutions the ac­  
cused shall enjoy the right to public trial by an  
impartial jury, to be informed of the nature and  
cause of the accusation, fo be confronted with  
the witnesses against him, to have compulsory  
process for obtaining witnesses iu his favor, and

dent lo remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection of the law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of tho  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
in Ids lavor. without defence, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of the constitu­  
iou, and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly void,  
and ol no ibree. The transferring the power of  
judging any person who is under the protection  
ol the laws, from the courts to the President of  
the United States as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
tho constitution which provides that “the judicial  
power of tho Unled States shall be vested iu  
courts, the judges of which shall hold their olllces  
during good behavior.” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the General Government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers.

Congress a power to lay and collect taxes, duties,  
imposts, excises; to pay the debts and provide for  
the common defence and general wellare of the  
United States, and to make all laws which shall  
be necessary and proper for carrying into execu­

Government of the United States, or in any de­

tion of all limits presort&#x27; ed to their power by the  
constitution—that words me ml by the instrument  
to lie subsidiary only to the execution of limited  
powers, ought not to he so construed as them­  
selves to give unlimited powers, nor a put of  
them in be taken, as to destroy the whole residue  
of tie- instrument. That the &quot;proceeding of the  
Gets ! Government under color of those articles  
will da a lit and necessary subject lor rev K-1 and  
cornu&#x27;.ion at a lime of great tranquility, while  
those specified in the preceding resolutions call  
for immediate redress.  
8. Mesu/md. That the preceding resolutions he  
transmitted to the Senators and Representatives  
in Congress from &#x27;.lie commonwealth, who are  
enjoined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to pro­  
cure at the next session ol Congress a repeal of  
the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
h Resolved, lasf/i/. That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, ami is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures of the several .States, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specilicd in their late Federal compact, to be  
friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosperity  
ol all the -States—that faithful to that compact,  
according to the plain intent and meaning in  
which it was understood and acceded lo by the  
several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its pre­  
servation; that it does also believe, that to take  
from the Slat&#x27;s all the powers of self-govern­  
ment, and transfer thorn to a general and consol­  
idated government, without regard to the special  
delegations and reservations, solemnly agreed to  
in that compact, is not lor the peace, happiness  
and prosperity of these States. And that, there­  
fore, this commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-stales are, to submit to imdele­  
gated and consequently unlimited powers in no  
man, or body ol men, on earth; that if the acts  
before specilicd should stand, these conclusions  
would grow from them, that the General Gov­  
ernment may place any act they think proper on  
the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself be tbe accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may  
be the evidence, his order the sentence, hisoflicer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valua­  
ble description of the inhabitants of Ihese .States,  
being by this precedent reduced as outhvs to the  
absolute dominion of one man, and liio barriers  
of the constitution thus swept from us all. no  
rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous pun­  
ishment the minority of the same body, the legis­  
latures, judges, governors and counselors of the  
.States, nor their other peaceable inli ibitanis who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties of the .States and people, or who  
for other causes, good or bad, may be obnoxious  
lo the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has boon selected as  
the safest subject of a lirst experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has ■already  
followed; for. already has a sedition act milk&#x27;d  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested at the  
threshold may lend to drive these .States into  
revolution and blood, and will furnish new calum­  
nies against republican government and now  
pretexts for those who wish it lo be believed that  
man cannot he governed but by a rod of iron:  
that it would be a dangerous delusion were a  
confidence in the men ol our choice lo silence  
our fears lor the safety of our rights; that con­  
fidence is everywhere the parcip of despotism:  
tree government is founded in jealousy and not  
in confidence: it is jealousy and not confidence  
which prescribes*limited constitutions to bind  
down those whom w are obliged to trust with  
power, that our constitution has fixed ihe limits  
to which, and no further onr confidence may go;  
and lot the honest advocate of confidence read  
the alien and sedition acts, and say if the eousli­  
lion has not been wise in fixing limits to the gov­  
ernment it created, and whether wo should be  
wise in destroying those limits? Let him say  
what the government is, if it he not a tyranny,  
which the men of our choice have conferred on  
tbe President, and the President of our choice has  
■assented to and accepted over the Irion ily strin­  
gers. to whom the mild spirit of our country and  
its laws have pledged hospitality and protection;  
that the men oi our choice have more respected  
the bare suspicions of the President than the solid  
rights of innocence, the claims of justification,  
the sacred force of truth, and Iho forms and sub­  
stance of law and justice. In questions of power,  
then, let no more oo heard of confidence in man.  
but hind him down liom mischief by the chains  
of the constitution. That this commonwealth  
does therefore call on its co-states for an expres­  
sion of their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for punishment of certain crime-,  
hereinbefore specified, plainly declaring whether  
those are or are not authorized by Ihe Fedcial  
compact. And it doubts not that their sense will  
be so announced as to prove their attachment  
unaltered to limited government, whether gen­  
eral or paiticular, and that the rights and liber­  
ties of their co-states will &#x27;be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own. Cut they will concur with litis  
commonwealth in considering the said acts as so  
palpable against the constitution as to amount to  
an undisguised declaration that that compact is  
not meant to bo the measure ol the power of the  
General Government, but that it will proceed in  
the exorcise over these states of all powers what­  
soever. That they will view this as seizing the  
rights of the states and consolidating them in the  
hands of the General Government, with the power  
assumed to hind the suites, not merely in cases  
made Federal, but in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made not with their consent, but by others  
against their consent; that lids would bo lo sur­  
render the form of government we have chosen,  
and living under one deriving its power from its  
own will, and not from onr authority; and that  
the co-states recurring lo their natural rights In  
cases not made Federal will concur in declaring  
these void and of no force, and will each unite  
with this commonwealth in requesting their re­  
peal at the next session of Congress

nstitution of the Unit­  
mi States having delegated to Congress a power  
to punish treason, foreounterf iting the securities  
and current coin ol the United States, piracies  
and felonies committed on tie1 high seas, and of­  
fences against (ho law of nations, and no other  
crime wh itsoever, and it being true, as a gem ml  
principle, and one of the amendments to the con­  
stitution having also declared -that the powers  
not delegated to the United .vtales by the con­  
stitution. nor prohibited by it to the .States, are  
reserved to the .States respectively, or to the  
people,&quot; therefore, the Act of Congress, passed  
on tle&gt; Uth day of July. 1798,” and entitled “an  
act in addition to the act entitled an act (or the  
punishment ol certain crimes against the United  
•States;&quot; as also the act passed by them on the  
27th of June. 1798. entitled &quot;an act to punish  
frauds committed on the bank of the United  
.States&quot; (and all of their other acts which as­  
sumes to create, define, or punish crimes other  
than those enumerated in the constitution,) are  
altogether void and of no force, and that the  
power to create, define, and punish such other  
crimes is reserved, and ol right appertains solely  
and exclusively to the .States, each within its own  
territory.  
3. Resolved. That it is lino, as a general prin­  
ciple, and is also expressly declared by one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, that th •  
‘ powers not delegated to the United .States by  
the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the .States,  
are reserved to the States resp- tivi ly. or to the  
people;” and that no power over the freedom of  
religion, freedom of speech or freedom of the press  
being delegated to the United .Slates by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the .States, all  
lawful powers respecting the same did of right  
remain, and w* r ■ res-rve-l to the .states or the  
people; that thus Was manifested their determi­  
nation to retain to themselves the right ol judg­  
ing how far the licentiousness ol speech and of  
the press may be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom; and how far those abuses which  
cannot be separated from their use should be  
tolerated rather than the use be destroyed and  
thus also they guarded against all abridgment,  
by die United .Motes, of the fre-dom ol religions  
opinions and exercises, and retained tothems-Ives  
(he right of protecting th(¥ same, as this .Stale,  
by a law passed on the general demand of its  
citizens, had already protected them from all  
human restraint or interference; and that, in ad­  
dition to this&quot; general principle and express de  
duration, another and more special provision has  
been made by one of the amendments to the  
constitution, which expressly declares, that Con­  
gross shall make no law respecting an establish­  
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise  
thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or ol  
the press,” thereby guarding in the same sentence,  
and under the same words, the freedom of reli­  
gion, of speech, and of the press, insomuch, that  
whatever violated either, throws down the sane  
tuary which covers the others, and that libels,  
falsehoods and defamation, equally with here-y  
md false religion, are withheld from the cogni­  
zance of Federal tribunals. That therefore the  
act of the Congress of th- United States, passed  
on the lit!) of July, 1798. entitled &quot;an act in  
addition to the act entitl -d in net for the punish­  
ment of certain crimes against the United States,”  
which does abridge the freedom of the press is  
not law, but is altogether void and of no force.  
1 Resolved. That alien friends are under the  
jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the  
states wherein they are; that no power over them  
has been delegated to the United State.-, nor  
prohibited to individual stales distinct from their  
power over citizens, and it being true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and one of the amendments to the  
constitution having also declared that “the pow­  
ers not deleg i 1 - i : o the Uni tod Slates nrc reserv­  
ed to the Slates respectively, or to the people,”  
the act of th.&#x27; Congress of the United .States,  
passed the 22d day of July, 1798, assumes power  
over aliens not delegated to the constitution, is  
not law, lint is altogether void and of no force.  
5. Resolved. That in addition to the general  
principle as well as the express declaration, (hat  
powers not delegated are reserved, anothei and  
more special provision inserted iu th constitu­  
tion, from abundant caution has declared that  
&quot;the migration or importation ol such persons as  
any of the .States now existing shall think proper  
to admit shall not be prohibited by the Congress  
prior to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject of the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to lli ■ prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
(!. Resolved. That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws ol this common­  
wealth mi his failure to obey the simple order of  
the&quot;[’resident, to depart out of the United Mates,  
as is undertaken by the said art entitled &quot;an act  
concerning aliens.&quot; iscontrary to the constitution,  
one amendment to which has provided that &quot;no  
person shall be deprived of liberty without due  
process of law.” mid tint another having pro­  
vided, ‘that iu all criminal prosecutions the ac­  
cused shall enjoy the right to public trial by an  
impartial jury, to be informed ol the nature and  
cause of the accusation, to bo confronted with  
the witnesses against him. to have compulsory  
process lor obtaining witnesses in his favor, and  
to have the assistance ol counsel for his defence.&#x27;’  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out ol the United Stales  
who is under the protection of the law. on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of I lie  
witnesses against him. without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defence, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of the consliln­  
ion, and is, therefore, not a law. but utterly void,  
and ol no force. The transferring the power ol  
judging any person who is under the protection  
ol the laws, from the courts to the President of  
the United States as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
I he constitution which provides that &quot;the judicial  
power of the Unted States shall lie vested in  
courts, the judges of which shall hold their offices  
during good behavior.” and the said act is void  
lor that reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the General Government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers,

9 liesu/veiJ, last///. That the Governor of this

ed to communicate the preceding resolutions lo  
the legislatures of the several .States, to assure  
them that this commonwealth cfnsiders union for  
specilied national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to be  
friendly to I lie peace, happiness, and prosperity  
ot all the Males—that faitlilul to that compact,  
according to the plain intent and meaning in  
■ which it was understood and acceded lo by the  
several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its pre­  
servation; that it does also believe, that to take  
from tile .Slat’s all the powers of self-govern­  
ment. and transfer them to a general and consol­  
idated government, without regard to the special  
delegations and reservations, solemnly agreed to  
in that compact, is not for the peace, happiness  
and prosperity of those .States. And that, there­  
lore, this commonwealth is detoi&#x27;miaed, as it  
doubts not its co stales are, to submit to mu)(.’le­  
gated and consequently unlimited powers in no  
in in, or body ol men, on earth; that if the acts  
In fore specilied should stand, these conclusions  
would grow from them, that the General Gov­  
ernment may place any act they think proper on  
the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
j other person, who may himself he the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may  
; he the evidence, his order (he sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sol” record ot  
Iho transaction, that a very numerous and valua­  
ble description of the inhabitants ol those .Stales,  
j being by this precedent reduced as onllws to the  
absolute dominion of one man, and the barriers  
of the constitution lints swept from ns all. no  
rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress lo protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous pun­  
ishment the minority ol the same body, the legis­  
-I.mires, judges, governors ami counselors of the

may venture to reclaim tie constitutional rights  
and liberties of the .Stales and people, or who  
for other causes, good or bad. may bo obnoxious  
to the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, lint the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
followed; for. already lias a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. Tha,t these and successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested at the  
threshold may lend to drive these States into  
revolution and blood, and will furnish new calum­  
nies against republican government and now  
pretexts for those who wish it to be believed that  
man cannot be governed tint by a rod of iron;  
that it would -be a dangerous delusion were a  
confidence in the men of our choice to silence  
our fears for the safely of one rights; that con­  
fidence is everywhere the paren’ ol despotism;  
tree government is founded in jealousy and not  
in confidence; it is jealousy and not confidence  
which prescribes limited constitutions to bind  
down those whom we are obliged lo trust with  
power, that our constitution has fixed the limits  
to which, and no further our confidence may go;  
and let the honest advocate of confidence read  
the alien and sedition acts, and say if the const!-  
lion has not been wise in fixing limits to the gov­  
ernment it. created, and whether we should lie  
I wise in destroying those limits? Let him say  
! what the government is. if it lie not a tyranny,  
&#x27; which t lie men of our choice have conferred on  
I Hie President, and the President of our choice has  
a.s-ented lo and accepted over the friendly strati­  
j g is, to whom the mild spirit of our country and  
] its laws have pledged hospitality and protection;  
that the men ol our choice have more respected  
the hare suspicions of the President than the solid  
| rights ol innocence, the claimsof&#x27;justification,  
ih” sacred force of truth, and the forms and sub­  
stance of law and justice. In questions o( power,  
j then, let no more he heard of confidence in man,  
I out bind him down from mischief by the chains  
of the constitution. That this commonwealth  
does therefore call on its co-states for an expres­  
sion ol their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for punishment ol certain crimes,  
! hereinbefore specilied. pi duly declaring whether  
these are or are not authorized by the Federal  
compact. And it doubts not that their sense will  
lie so announced as to prove their attachment  
unaltered to limited government, whether gen­  
eral or pat ticular, and that the rights and I j tier­  
ties of their co-slates will be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own. lint they will concur with Ibis  
commonwealth in considering the said acts ns so  
i palpable against the constitution as to amount to  
I an undisguised declaration that that compact is  
&#x27; not meant to lie the measure ol the power of the  
General Government, but that it will proceed in  
the exercise over these slates of all powers w hat­  
soever. That they trill view this as seizing the  
rights of the stales and consolidating them in the  
hands ol the General Government,with the power  
assumed to hind the suites, not merely in oases  
made Federal, lint in all eases whatsoever, by  
laws made not with their consent, hut by others  
gig.«ilist their consent; that this would be to sur­  
render the form of government we have chosen,  
and living under one deriving its power from its  
own will, and not Irom our authority; and that  
the co-stales recurring lo their natural rights in  
cases not made Federal will concur in declaring  
these void and of no force, and will each unite  
with this commonwealth in requesting their re- |  
peal at the next session of Congress

nstitution of the Unit­  
ed States having delegated to Congress a power  
to punish treason, forcounterfeiting the securities  
and current coin ot the United States, piracies  
and felonies committed on the high seas, and of­  
fences against lho law of nations, and no other  
crime whatsoever, and it being true, as a general  
principle, and one ol&#x27; the amendments to the con­  
stitution having also declared “that the powers  
not delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are  
reserved to the States respectively, or to the  
people,” therefore, the Act of Congress, passed  
on 111&quot; If Ih &#x27;1 ly of July. 1795,” and entitled “an  
act in addition to the act entitled an act for the  
punishment ol certain crimes against the United  
Males;” as also the act passed by them on the  
271 h of June. 17!)8. entitled “an act I* punish  
I rands committed on the bank of the United

sumes to create, define, or punish crimes other  
than those enumerated in the constitution,) are  
altogether void and of no force, and ‘hat the  
power to create, define, and punish such other  
crimes is reserved, and of right appertains solely  
ind exclusively to the .States, each within its own I  
territory.  
  
3. Resolved, That it is true, as a general prin­

the amendments to the constitution, that the  
‘•powers not delegated to the United States by  
the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the .Vtales,  
ire reserved to the States respectively, or to the  
people;” ami that no power over the freedom of  
religion, freedom of speech or freedom of the press  
being delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, all  
lawful powers respecting the same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the States or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determi­  
nation to retain to themselves the right ol judg­  
ing how far the licentiousness ol speech and of  
th-&#x27; press may bo abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom; and how tar those abuses which  
cannot be separated from their use should be  
tolerated rather than the use bo destroyed and  
thus also they guarded against all abridgment,  
by ibo United States, of the freedom of religious  
opinions and exercises, ami retained tothemselvcs  
the right of protecting the same, as this .State,  
by a law passed on the general demand of its  
citizens, had already protected them from all  
human restraint or interference; and that, in ad­  
dition to this general principle and express de  
duration, another and more special provision has  
been mule by one of the amendments to the  
constitution, which expressly declares, that Con­  
gress shall make no law respecting an establish­  
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise  
thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of  
the press,” thereby guarding in the same sentence,  
and under the same words, the freedom of reli­  
gioir? of speech, and of the press, insomuch, that  
whatever violated either, throws down the sane  
tn try which covers the others, and that libels,  
falsehoods and defamation, equally with heresy  
and false religion, are withheld from the cogni­  
zance of Federal tribunals. That therefore the  
act of the Congress of Ibe United States, passed  
on the 14th of duly, 1798, entitled ‘‘an act in  
addition to the act entitled an act for the punish­  
ment of certain crimesagainst the United Slates,”  
which does abridge the freedom of the press is  
not law, but is altogether void and of no force.  
4. Resolved, That alien friends are under the  
jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the  
states wherein they arc; that no power over them  
has been delegated to the United States, nor  
prohibited to individual states distinct from their  
power over citizens, and it being true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and one of the amendments to the  
constitution having also declared that ‘-the pow­  
ers not delegated to the United .Statesarc reserv­  
ed to the states respectively, or to the people,”  
the act of the Congress of flic United .States,  
p issed the 22d day of July, 1798. assumes power  
over aliens not delegated to the constitution, is  
not law, but is altogether void and of no force.  
fi. Resolved. That in addition to the general  
principle as well as the express declaration, that  
powers not delegated are reserved, another and  
more special provision inserted in th.. constitu­  
tion, from abundant caution has declared that  
•‘the migration or importation of such persons as  
any of the .Slates now existing shall think proper  
to admit shall not be prohibited by the Congress  
prior to the year 1*08;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as tie’ subject of the sail) act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
biliou of their migration, and is, therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.

i impartial jury, to lie informed of the nature and  
cause of the accusation, to be confronted with  
the witnesses against him. to have compulsory  
] process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and  
to have the assistance ol counsel for his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Presi­

who is under the protection of the law. on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
i without public trial, without confrontation ot the  
witnesses against him. without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defence, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of the constitu­  
tion. and is. therefore, not a law. but utterly void,  
and of no force. The transferring the power of  
judging any person who is under the protection  
ol the laws, from the courts to the President of  
the United States as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that “the judicial  
power of the Unted States shall be vested in  
courts, the judges of which shall hold (heir offices  
during good beh ivior.” ami the said act is void  
for that reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that, this transfer of judiciary power is to that

those specified in their late Federal compact, to be  
friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosperity  
ot all the Stales—that faithful to that compact,  
according to the plain intent and meaning in  
which it was understood and acceded to by the  
several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its pre­  
servation; that it does also believe, that to take  
from the States all the powers of self-govern­  
ment, and transfer thorn to a general and consol­  
idated government, without regard to the special  
delegations and reservations, solemnly agreed to  
in that compact, is not for the peace, happiness  
and prosperity of these States. And that, there­  
fore, tliis commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-slates are, to submit to undelo­  
gated and consequently unlimited powers in no  
man, or body ol men, on earth; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, these conclusions  
would grow from them, that the General Gov­  
ernment may place any act they think proper on  
the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may  
be tlie evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valua­  
ble description of the inhabitants of those States,  
being by this precedent reduced as outhvs to the  
absolute dominion of one man, and the barriers  
ot the constitution thus swept from us all, no  
rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous pun­  
ishment the minority of the same body, the legis­  
latures, judges, governors and counselors of the  
States, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties of the States and people, or who  
for other causes, good or had, may be obnoxious  
to the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to bis or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
followed; for. already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested at Ihe  
threshold may tend to drive these States into  
revolution and blood, and will furnish new calum­  
nies against republican government and new  
pretexts for those who wish it to bo believed that  
man cannot he governed but by a rod of iron;  
that it would be a dangerous delusion were a  
confidence in the men of our choice to silence  
our fears for the safety of our rights; that con­  
fidence is everywhere the parent of despotism;  
free government is founded in jealousy and not  
in confidence; it is jealousy ami not confidence  
which prescribes limited constitutions to bind  
down those whom we are obliged to trust with  
power, that our constitution has fixed the limits  
to which, and no further our confidence may go;  
and let the honest advocate of confidence read  
the alien and sedition acts, and say if the const!-  
lion has not been wise in fixing limits to the gov­  
ernment it created, and whether we should bo  
wise in destroying those limits? Let him say  
what the government is, if it bo not a tyranny,  
which the men of our choice have conferred on  
the President, and the President of our choice has  
assented to and accepted over the Iriendly stran­  
gers, to whom the mild spirit of our country and  
its laws have pledged hospitality and protection;  
that the men ol onr choice have more respected  
the bare suspicions ol the President than the solid  
rights of innocence, the claims of justification,  
the sacred force of truth, and the forms and sub­  
stance of law and justice, in questions of power,  
then, let no more lie heard of confidence in man,  
but bind him down from mischief by the chains  
of the constitution. That this commonwealth  
docs therefore call on its co-states tor an expres­  
sion of their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for punishment of certain crimes,  
hereinbefore specified, plainly declaring whether  
these are or are not authorized by the Federal  
compact. And it doubts not that their sense will  
he so announced as to prove their attachment  
unaltered to limited government, whether gen­  
eral or paiticular, and that the rights and liber­  
ties of their co-states will be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own. But they will concur with this  
commonwealth in considering the said acts as so  
palpable against tbo constitution as to amount to  
an undisguised declaration that that compact is  
not meant to be the measure ol the power of the  
General Government, but that it will proceed in  
the exorcise over these states of all powers what­  
soever. That they will view this as seizing the  
rights of the stales and consolidating them in the  
hands of the General Government, with the power  
assumed to bind the slates, not merely in cases  
made Federal, but in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made not with their consent, but by others  
against their consent; that this would be to sur­  
render the form of government we have chosen,  
and living under one deriving its power from its  
own will, and not from our authority; and that  
the co-states recurring to their natural rights in  
cases not made Federal will concur in declaring  
these void and of no force, and will each unite  
with this commonwealth in requesting their re­  
peal at the next session of Congress

rent coin of the United States, pira­  
cies and felonies committed on the  
high seas, and offences against tho  
law of nations, and no other crimes  
whatsoever, and it being true, as a  
general principle, and one of the  
amendments to the Constitution hav­  
ing also declared &quot; that tho powers  
not dolegated to tho United States by  
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it  
to the States, are reserved to tho States  
respectively or to the pooplo,&quot; theTe  
fore, tho act of Congress, passed on  
the 14th day of July, 1798, and enti­  
tled, &quot;An Act in addition to tho act

the power to create, dofine, and pun­  
ish such other crimes is reserved, and  
of right appertains only and exclu­  
sively to the respective States, each  
within its own territorv.  
3. IletoUed, That it is true, as a gen­  
eral principlo, and is also expressly do­  
clared by one of the amendments to  
the Constitution, that tho &quot; powers  
not delegated to the United States by  
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it  
to tho States, are reserved to the States  
respoctivoly or to the people ;&quot; and  
that no power over the freedom of re­  
ligion, freodom of speoch, or freedom  
of the press boing delcgatod to tho  
United Statos by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to the Statos, aU law­  
ful powers respecting the same did of  
right remain, and wore reserved to  
the States or the people; that thus  
was manifested their determination to  
retain to themselves the right of judg­  
ing how far the licentiousness of speech  
an1, of tho press may be abridged  
  
without lessening their useful freedom;  
and how far those abuses which can­  
not be separated from their uso should  
be toloratod rathor than the uho be  
destroyed, and thus also they guardod  
against all abridgement, by the Uni­  
ted States, of the freedom of religious  
opinions and exercises, and retained  
to themselves tho right of protecting  
the same, as this Stato by a law pass­  
od on the general demand of its citi­  
zens, had already protected them from  
all human restraint or intorfurence,  
and that in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, an­  
other and moro special provision lias  
been made by one of the amendments  
to the Constitution, which expressly  
declares that &quot; Congress shall make  
no law respecting an establishment of  
religious or prohibiting the free exer­  
cise thereof, or abridging the freodom  
of religion, of speeoh, and of the  
press, insomuch that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down the sanctuary  
which covers the others, and that li­  
bels, falsehood, and defamation, equal­  
ly with heresy and false religion, are  
withheld from the cognizance of fede­  
ral Cribunals. That therefore the act  
of Congress of the United States,  
passed on tho 14th of July, 1798, en­  
titled, &quot;An act in addition to an act  
entitled An act for the punishment of  
certain crimes against the Unitod  
States,&quot; which doos abridge the free­  
dom of tho press, is not law, but is  
altogether void and of no force.  
4. Iiesoked, That alien friends are  
under the jurisdication and protection  
of the laws of the State wherein they  
are; that no power over them has been  
delegated to the United States, nor  
prohibited to tho individual State dis­  
tinct from their power over citizens,  
and it being true, as a general princi­  
plo, and one of the amendments to  
the Constitution having also declared  
that &quot; the powers not delegated to the  
Unitod States by the Constitution, nor  
prohibited by it to tho States, are re­  
served to the States respectively, or to  
the people,&quot; the act of tho Congress  
of the &#x27;United States, passed the 22d  
of July, 1798, assumes power over  
aliens not delegated by the Constitu­  
tion, is not law, but is altogether void  
and of no force  
5. Beeohtd, That in addition to tho  
general principlo as well an tho ox­  
press declaration, that powers not del­  
egated aro reserved, another and more  
ejiociul provision inserted in tho Con­  
stitution, irom abundant caution, has  
declared, &quot; that the migration or im  
  
portation of such persons as any of  
fi. on i.-n  
er to admit, shall not be prohibited  
by Congress prior to tho year 1808&quot;  
that this commonwealth docs admit  
tho migration Of alien ft tends des­  
cribed as tho subject of the said act  
concerning aliens; that a provision  
against all acts equivalent thereto, or  
it, would bo nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to  
the prohibition of their migration, and  
is, thereforo, contrary to the said pro­  
vision of the Constitution, and is void.  
C. Hetolcrd. That the imprisonment  
of a person under the protection of  
the laws of this commonwealth on his  
failure to obey tho simple order of the  
President to depart out of tho United  
Statos, as is undertaken by tho said  
act, entitlod, &quot;An act concerning  
aliens,&quot; is contrary to tho Constitu­  
tion, one amondmcnt to which has  
provided that &quot; no person shall be de­  
prived of liborty without due process  
of law,&quot; and that another having pro­  
vided &quot; that in all criminal prosecu­  
tions the accusod shall enjoy the right  
to public trial by an impartial Jury, to  
bo informed of tho naturo and cause  
of tho accusation, to be confronted  
with witnesses against him, to have  
compulsory process of obtaining wit­  
nesses in his favor, and to have the  
assistance of counsel in his defence,&quot;  
the same act undertaking to authorize  
the President to removo a person out  
of the United States who is under tho  
protection of tho law, on his own sus­  
picion, without acusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without conf ron­  
tation of tho witnesses against him,  
without hearing witnesses in his fa­  
vor, without defence, without counsel.  
is contrary to these provisions also of  
tho Constitution, and is thereforo, not  
a law.&#x27; but utterly void, and of no  
forco. That transferring the power of  
judging any person who is under the  
protection of the laws, from tho Courts  
to the President of the Unitod States  
as is undertaken by the same act con  
corning aliens, is against tho article of  
tho Constitution winch provides that  
&quot;tho judicial power of tho Unitod  
States shall be vested in the Uourts,  
the judges of which shall hold their  
office during good behavior,&quot; and the  
said act is void for that reason, also,  
and it is further to bo noted that this  
transfer of judiciary powor is to that  
magistrato of tho Genoral Govern  
ment who already possesses all tho ex  
ecutive, and ncgativo on aU tho legis  
lative power

by sundry&#x27; of their proceedings to

United States, which delegate to Con  
gress a power to lay and collect taxes,  
duties, imposts, excises; to pay the  
debts and provide for tho common do  
fenco and general welfare of the Uni  
ted States, and to make all laws which  
shall bo necessary and proper for car

strumont to be subsidary only to the  
execution of limited powors, nor a,  
pjart to bo so taken, as, to destroy the  
  
whole residue of tli3 instrument,  
That tho proceeding of tho General  
Government under color of those ar­  
ticles will be a fit aud necessary sub  
  
ject for revisal and correction at a  
time of greater tranquility, while those  
specified in the preceding resolutions  
call for immodiate redress.  
8. Besolved, That the preceding res  
olutions be transmitted to tho Sena­  
tors and Representatives in Congress  
from tho commonwealth who are en-  
joinod to prcsont tho same to their re  
spective houses, and to use their best  
endeavors to procure at the next ses­  
sion of Congress, a repeal of he afore  
said unconstitutional, obnoxious acts.  
9. Itttoked lattfo, That the Govern  
or of this commonwealth be, and is  
authorized and requested to communi­  
cate the precoding resolutions to the  
Legislatures of the several States to  
assure them, that this commonwealth  
considers union for specified national  
purposes, &#x27; and particularly for thoso  
speciued in their late federal compact,  
to be friendly to tho peaco, happiness,  
and prosperity of all the States that  
are faithful to that compact, accord­  
ing to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and ac­  
ceded to by the several parties, it is  
sincerely anxious for its preservation;  
that it does also believe, that to take  
from the States all the tiowers of self-  
government, and transfer them to a  
general ana conBoiiaatea government,  
without regard to tho special delega­  
tions and reservations, solemnly agreed  
to in that compact, is not for the peace,  
happinoss or prosperity of these Statos.  
And that therefore, this common  
wealth is determined, as it doubts not  
its co-States aro, to submit to undele­  
gated and consequently unlimited pow  
ers in no man, or body of men on  
earth; that if the acts beforo specified  
should 6tand, these conclusions would  
flow. from them, that tho general gov  
ornment may place any act they think  
proper on tho list of crimes and pun  
isn H inemsoives, wnemer cnumera  
ted by tho Constitution orcognizabloby  
them, that they may transler its cog  
nizance to tho Presidont or any other  
person, who may himself be tho ac  
cuser, counsel, judge and jury, whoso  
suspicions may bo tho evidence, his  
order tho sentence, his olhcer the exo  
cutioner, and his breast the solo record  
of tho transaction, that a very numer  
ous and valuable description of tho  
inhabitants of these States, being by  
this precedent reduced as outlaws to  
tho absoluto dominion of ono man,  
and tho barriers of the Constitution  
thus swept from us all, no rampart  
now remains against tho passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress  
to protect from aliko . exportation or  
other grevious punishment tho minor  
ity of the same body, tho legislators,  
judges, governors and counsellors of  
the States, nor their other peaeoable  
inhabitants who may venture to re  
claim tho constitutional rights and  
liberties of the ctato and people, or  
who for other causes, good or bad,  
may bo obnoxious to tho views, or  
marked by the suspicions of the 1 res  
idont, or to bo thought dangerous to  
his or their elections or other interest,  
public or personal ; that the friendless  
alion has boeu selected as the safest  
subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has  
already followed ; for, already has a  
sedition act marked him as its nrov.  
That these and successive acts of tho  
same character, Unless arrested at the  
threshold may tend to drive thoso  
States into revolution and blood, and  
will furnish new calumnies against  
republican government, and new pro­  
texts for those who wish to be believed  
that men cannot be governed but by a  
rod of iron; that it would bo a dan  
gerous delusion were a confidence in  
the men of our choice to silence our  
fears for the safety of our rights; that  
confidence is every whero the parent of  
despotism ; froe government is founded  
in jealousy and not in couhdenoe ; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which  
prescribes limited constitutions to bind  
down thoso whom we are obliged to  
trust with power, that our Constitu­  
tion has fixed the limits to which, and  
no further, our confidonco ,may go;  
and let the honest advocates of confi­  
donco road tho alien and sodition acts,  
and say if the Constitution has not  
been wiso in fixing limits to the Gov  
ernmcnt it created, and whether wo  
should be wise in destroying those  
limits? Let him sny what the Gov­  
ernment is, if it bo not a tyranny,  
which the men of our choico have con­  
ferred on tho President, and tho Pres­  
ident of our choice has assented to  
and acccptod. over tho friendly stran­  
gers, to whom tho mild spirit of our  
country and its laws have pledged hos­  
pitality and protection; that tho men  
of our choice have more respected the  
bare suspicions of the President than  
the solid rights of innocenco, tho claims  
of justification, tho sacred forco of  
truth, and the forms and substance of  
law and justice. In quostions of pow­  
er, then, let no more bo heard of con­  
fidonco in man but bind him down  
from mischief by tho chains of tho  
Constitution. . That this common­  
wealth doos therefore cull on its co­  
States for an expression of its sonti­  
incnts on the acts concerning aliens,  
and for tho punishment of certain  
crimes, herein beoro specified, .plainly  
declaring whether theso acts are or  
aro not authorized by tho federal com­  
pact. And it doubts not that their  
senso will bo so announced as to prove  
thoir attachment unaltered to limited  
government, whether general or par­  
ticular, and that the rights and liber­  
ties of their co-States will be exposed  
to no dangors by remaining embarked  
on common bottom with their own.  
Jlut they will concur with this com­  
monwealth in considering tho said acts  
as so palpablo against tho Constitu­  
tion as to amount to an undisguisod  
declaration that that compact is not  
meant to be the measure ot the pow  
er of the General Government, but  
that it will proceed in the exercise  
over these States of all powers what-.  
soever.. Th&amp;t they w.ill riew this as  
seizing the rights of tho States. M  
  
consolidating them in tho hands of the  
  
General Government with tho power  
assumed to bind tho States (not mere­  
ly iu cases made federal) but iu all  
cases whatsoever, by laws made; not  
with their consent but by others  
against their consent; that this would  
bo to surrender tho form of govern­  
ment wo have chosen, and living un­  
der one deriving its power from its  
own will, and not from our authority;  
and that the co-States recurring to  
their natural rights in cases not made  
federal, will concur in declaring these  
void aud of no force, and will each  
unito with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the noxt ses­  
sion of Congress. .

idated government, without regard to the special  
delegations and reservations, solemnly agreed to

fore, this commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-states are, to submit to undolo­  
gated and consequently unlimited powers in no  
man, or body ol men, on earth; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, these conclusions  
would grow from them, that the General Gov­  
ernment may place any act they think proper on  
the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any

counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may  
be the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer

al; that the friendless alien has been selected as

followed; for, already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested at the  
threshold may tend to drive these .States into  
revolution and blood, and will furnish new calum­  
nies against republican government and new  
pretexts for those who wish it to be believed that  
man cannot lie governed but by a rod of iron;  
that it would be a dangerous delusion wore a  
confidence in the men of our choice to silence  
our tears for the safety of our rights; that con­  
fidence is everywhere the parent ol despotism;  
tree government is (bunded in jealousy and not  
in confidence; it is jealousy and not confidence  
which prescribes limited constitutions to bind  
down those whom we are obliged to trust with  
power, that our constitution has fixed the limits  
to which, and no further our confidence may go;  
and let the honest advocate of confidence read  
ttio alien and sedition acts, and say if the consti­  
tion lias not been wise in fixing limits to Mi&quot; gov­  
ernment it created, and whether we should lie  
wise in destroying those limits? Let him say  
what the government is, if it be not a tyranny,  
which the men of our choice have conferred on  
the President, and the President of our choice has  
assented to and accepted over the Iriendly stran­  
gers. to whom the mild spirit of oar country and  
its laws have pledged hospitality and protection;  
(hat the men ol our choice have more respected  
the bare suspicions of the President than Mie solid  
rights ol innocence, the claims of justification,  
the sacred force of truth, and flic forms and sub­  
stance of taw and justice. In questions ol power,  
then. l&quot;t no more lie heard of confidence in man,  
but bind him down from mischiel by the chains  
of the constitution. Thai this commonwealth  
does therefore cMI on its co-states lor an expres­  
sion ol their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for punishment of certain crimes,  
hereinbefore specified, plainly declaring whether  
these are or are not authorized by the Federal  
compact. And it doubts not that their sense will  
be so announced as to prove their attachment  
unaltered to limited government, whether gen­  
eral or paiticular, and that the rights and liber­  
ties of their co-states will be exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own. But they will concur with this  
commonwealth in considering the said acts as so  
palpable against the constitution as to amount to  
an undisguised declaration that that compact is  
not meant to be the measure of Mie power of the  
General Government, but that it will proceed in  
the exercise over these slates of nil powers what­  
soever. That they will view this as seizing the  
rights of the stales and consolidating them in the  
hands ol the Genera 1 Government, with the power  
assumed to hind the slates, not merely in cases  
made Federal, but in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made not with their consent, but by others  
against their consent; that Ihis would bo to sur­  
render the form of government we have chosen,  
and living under one deriving its power from its  
own will, and not from bur authority; and that  
the co-slates recurring to Iheir natural rights in  
cases not made Federal will concur in declaring  
these void and of no force, and will each unite  
with this commonwealth in requesting their re­  
peal at the next session of Congress

esolved, That tho constitution of the Unit­  
ed States having delegated to Congress a power  
to punish treason, for counter! iting the securities  
and current coin ot the United States, piracies  
and felonies committed on I!i•» high seas, and of­  
fences against tho law of nations, and no other  
crime wh itsoever. and it being true, as a general  
principle, and one of the amendments to the con­  
stitution having also declared &quot;that the powers  
not dele gated to the United States by the con­  
stitution. nor prohibited by it to the States, arc  
reserved to the States respectively, or to the  
people,&quot; therefore. Ihe Act of Congress, p issed  
on the 11th d iy of July. 1798,’&#x27;and entitled “an  
not in addition to th- act entitled an act for the  
punishment ol certain crimes against the United  
Slates;” as also the act passed by them on the  
27th of June. 1798, entitled &quot;an act to punish  
frauds committed on the. bank of the United  
States’’(and all of their other acts which as­  
sumes to create, deline, or punish crimes other  
than those enumerated in the constitution,) arc  
altogether void and of no force, and that the  
power to create, doliiio. and punish such other  
crimes is reserved, and ol right appertains solely  
and exclusively to tho Stat.es, each within its own  
territory.  
.1. Resolved. That it is true, as a general prin­  
ciple, and is also expressly declared by one-ol  
the amendments to the constitution, that the  
“powers not delegat ed to the United Status by  
the const!tni inn. nor prohibited by it to tho States,  
are reserved to the States re.-poctively. or to the  
people;” and that no power over the freedom of  
religion, freedom ol speech or freedom of tho press  
being delegated to the United States by tho con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the Stales, all  
lawful paw rs respecting the same did of right  
remain, and wore reserved to the States ortho  
people; th it thus was manifested their determi­  
nation to retain to themselves the right ol judg­  
ing how far the licentiousness of speech and of  
the press in iy 1)&quot; abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom; and how tar those abuses which  
cannot b&quot; separated from their use should be  
tolerated rather than the use he destroyed and  
thus also they guarded against all abridgment,  
by th 1 United Stoles, of the freedom ol religions  
opinions and exorcises, and retained to themselves  
the right of protecting the same, as this State,  
by a law passed on the general demand of its  
citizens, had already protected them from all  
h i nan restraint or interference; and that, in ad­  
dition to this general principle and express de  
duration, another and more special provision lias  
been made by one of the amendments to tho  
constitution, which expressly declares, that fun­  
gross shall make no law respecting an establish­  
ment of religion, nr prohibiting the free exorcise  
thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of  
the press,” thereby guarding in the same sentence,  
and under the same words, tho freedom of reli­  
gion, of speech, and of the press, insomuch, that  
whatever violated either, throws down the sanc­  
tuary which covers the others, and that libels,  
falsehoods and defamation, equally with heresy  
and false religion, are withheld from tho cogni­  
zance of Federal tribunals. That therefore tho  
act of the Congress of the United States, passed  
on the Uth of July, 1798, entitled “an act in  
addition to the act entitled an act for the punish­  
ment of certain crimes against th • United State-,”  
which does abridge tlie freedom ol the press is  
not law, but is altogether void and of no force.  
1 Resolved, Tliat alien friends are under the  
jurisdiction and protection of the laws of tlie  
states wherein they are; th at no power over them  
his been delegated to th&quot; United States, nor  
prohibited to individual states distinct from their  
p over over citizens, and it being true, as a gen­  
eral principle, and one of the amendments to the  
constitution having also declared that &quot;tlie pow­  
ers not delegated to tlie United Mates are reserv­  
ed to the states respectively, or to tho people,&quot;  
the act of the Congress of tho United Mates,  
passed the 22d day of July, 1798. assumes power  
over aliens not delegated to the constitution, is  
not law. but is altogether v oid and of no force.  
5. R,solved. That in addition to tlie general  
principle as well as the express dec&#x27;aration, that  
powers not del,.-gated are reserved, another and  
more special provision inserted in th . constitu­  
tion, from abundant caution ha- declared that  
“the migration or importation of such persons as  
any of tins .States now existing shall think proper  
to admit shall not bo prohibited by Hie Congress  
prior to the year 1808;&quot; that (his commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ  
&quot;d is tlie subject of the said ad concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto.or it would lie nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is, therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of tho constitution,  
and void.  
(i. Resolved. That the imprisonment of a person  
under (lie protection of tlie laws of this common­  
wealth on liis failure to obey the simple order of  
the President, to depart out of the United .States,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled “an act  
concerning aliens,” is conlrnry to Ihe constitution,  
one amendment to which his provided that &quot;no  
person shill h: deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” and that another having pro­  
vided. ‘that in all criminal prosecutions the ae­  
ons&quot;! shall enjoy the right to public trial by an  
impartial jury, to he informed of tho nature and  
cause of the accusation, to lie confronted with  
the witnesses against him, to have compulsory  
process for obtaining witnesses in Ids favor, and  
iO have tho assistance ol counsel for his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection of tho Jaw, on Ids  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of tlie  
witnesses against him. without hearing witnesses  
in Ids favor, without defence, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of l tie constitu­  
tion, and is, therefore, not a law. but utterly void,  
and of no force. The transferring the power of  
judging any person who is under the protection  
of the jaws, from the courts to the President of  
the United States as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article ol  
the constitution which provides that-the judicial  
power of the Untod States shall be vested in  
courts, tlie judges of which shall hold their offices  
during good behavior.” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, and it is further to bo

General Government (as is evinced by sundry of  
their proceedings) to those parts of the constitu­  
tion of the United States, which delegate to  
Congress a power to lay and collect taxes, duties,  
imposts, excises; to pay the debts and provide for  
the common defence and general welfare of the  
I United Slates, and to make all laws which shall  
be necessary and proper for carrying into execu­  
tion the powers vested by the constitution in the  
Government of the United States, or in any de­  
partment or officer thereof, goes to the destruc­  
tion ol all limits prescribed to their power by the  
conslitmion that words meant by the instrument  
to be subsidiary only to the execution ol limited  
power-, might not to be so construed as them­  
jcivcs to give unlimited powers, nor a part of  
them lo lie taken, us to destroy the whole residue  
ot the instrnment. That the proceeding of the  
General Got eminent under color of those articles  
will be a til and necessary subject for revisal and  
correction at a time of great tranquility, while  
these specified in the preceding resolutions call  
for immediate redress.  
8. Jx. auluiil, That the preceding resolutions bo  
transmitted to the Senators and Representatives  
in Congress from the commonwealth, who are  
enjoined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to pro­  
cure at the next session ol Congress a repeal of  
the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
9 Resolved, lastly. That the Governor of this  
commonwealth ho. and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ot the several .States, lo assure  
them that this commonwealth ei nsiders union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late Federal compact, to be  
friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosperity  
ol all the States—that faithful to that compact,  
according to the plain intent and meaning in  
which it was understood and acceded to by the  
several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its pre­  
servation; that it docs also believe, that to take  
from the Slat &#x27;s all the powers of self-govorn­  
; meat, and transfer them to a general and consol­  
idated government, without regard to the special  
delegations and reservations, solemnly agreed to  
in that compact, is not tor the. peace, happiness  
and prosperity of these .Stales. And that, there­  
fore, this commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-states are. to submit to undele­  
gated and consequently unlimited powers in no  
man, or body ol men, on earth; that if the acts  
before specified should stand, those conclusions  
would grow from them, that the General Gov­  
ernment may place any act they think proper on  
the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself lie the accuser,  
! counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may  
be the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of

n has been selected as  
the safest subject of a lirst experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
followed; fur, already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested at the  
threshold may tend to drive these States into  
revolution and blood, and will furnish new calum­  
nies against republican government and new  
pretexts for those who wish it to ho believed that  
man cauuot he governed but by a rod of iron;  
that it would be a dangerous delusion were a  
confidence in the men of onr choice to silence  
our fears for the safety of our rights; that con­  
fidence is everywhere the parent ol despotism;  
free government is founded in jealousy and not  
in confidence; it is jealousy and not confidence  
which prescribes limited constitutions to hind  
down those whom we are obliged to (nisi with  
power, that our constitution has fixed the limits  
lo which, and no further our confidence may go;  
and let the honest advocate of confidence read  
the alien and sedition acts, and say if the const!-  
tion has not been wise in fixing limits to the gov­  
ernment it created, and whether wo should bo  
wise in destroying those limits! Let him say  
what the government is, if it he not a tyranny,  
which the men of our choice have conferred on  
the President&#x27;, and the President of onr choice lias  
assented to ami accepted over the friendly stran­  
gers. to whom the mild spirit of our country and  
its laws have pledged hospitality and protection;  
that the men ol our choice have more respected  
the bare suspicions of the President than the solid  
rights ol innocence, the claims of justification,  
the sacred force of truth, and the forms and sub­  
stance of law and justice. In questions of power,  
then, let no more be hoard of confidence in man,  
but bind him down from mischief by the chains  
of the constitution. That this comnionw“altli  
does therefore call on its co-states fur an expres­  
sion ol their sentiments on-the acts concerning  
aliens, and for punishment of certain crimes,  
hereinbefore spocitied, plainly declaring whether  
these are or are not authorized by the Federal  
compact. And it doubts not that their sense will  
bo so announced as to prove their attachment  
unaltered to limited government, whether gen­  
eral or p.iiticniar, and that (he rights and liber­  
ties of their co-states will bo exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own. But they will concur with this  
commonwealth in considering the said acts as so  
palpable against the constitution as to amount to  
an undisguised declaration that that compact is  
not meant lo he the measure ol the power of the  
General Government, but that it will proceed in  
the exercise over those states ol all powers what­  
soever. That they will view this as seizing the  
rights of the states and consolidating them.in the  
hands of the General Government, with the power  
assumed to bind the states, not merely in cases  
made Federal, hut in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made not with their consent, hut by others  
against their consent; that this would lie to sur­  
render Hie form of government we have chosen,  
and living under one deriving its power from its  
own will, and not from onr authority; mid that  
the co-stales recurring lo their natural rights in  
cases not made Federal will concur in declaring  
these void and of no force, and will each unite  
with this commonwealth in requesting their re­  
peal at the next session of Congress

estroy the  
General Government (as ispvinccd by sundry of  
their proceedings) to those parts of the constitu­  
tion of the United States, which delegate to  
(’ongress a power to lay and collect taxes, duties,  
imposts, excises; to pay the debts and provide for  
the common defence and general welfare of the  
United States, ami to make all laws which shall  
be necessary and proper for carrying into execu­  
tion the powers vested by the constitution in the  
Government of the United States, or in any de­  
partment or otllcer thereof, goes to the destruc­  
tion of all limits proscribed to their power by thu  
I constitution—that words meant by the instrument  
to lie subsidiary only to the execution ol limited  
powers, ought not to bo go construed ns them­  
selves to give unlimited powers, nor a part of  
them to bo taken, as to destroy thu whole residue  
of the instrument. That the proceeding of the  
General Government under color of those articles  
will bo a til and necessary subject for revisal and  
correction at a time of great tranquility, while  
those specified in the preceding resolutions call  
for immediate redress.  
8. Resolved, Thai the preceding resolutions be  
I transmitted to the Senators and Representatives  
j in Congress from the commonwealth, who are  
! enjoined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to pro­  
cure at the next session ol Congress a repeal of  
the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious act s.  
i) Resolved, last/!/. That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding r solutions to  
the legislatures of the several .States, to issnre  
them tli.it this commonwealth ci nsiders union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late Federal compact, to be  
friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosperity  
o( all the .Stales —that faithful to that compact,  
according to the plain intent and meaning in  
which it was understood an i acceded to by lho  
several parties, it is sincerely anxious.for its pro-&#x27;  
serration; that it does also believe, that to take  
! from thu States all the powers of sell govern­  
ment, and transfer them to a general and consol­  
idated government, without regard to the special  
delegations and reservations, solemnly agreed to  
1 in that compact, is not for the p&quot;ace. happiness  
I and prosperity of these .Stab s. And that, there­  
| fore, this commonwealth is determined, as it  
doubts not its co-stales arc, to submit to undelo­  
■raled and consequently unlimited powers in no  
man, or body ol men, on earth; that if the acts  
h-fore specified should stand, these conclusions  
would grow from them, that the General Gov­  
ernment may place any act they think proper on  
the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
Constitution cognizable by l!mm. that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may him-elf be tin- accuser,  
counsel, judge nnd jury, whose suspicions may  
bo the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the tr msaction, that a very numerous and valua­  
ble description of the inhabilantsof these States,  
being by this precedent reduced as outlws to the  
absolute dominion of one mm, ami the barriers  
of the constitution thus swept from ns all, no  
rampart now remains ag.dn.-t the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or o her ;ri vou  
i. hm.-nt the minority of the sunn* body, the legis­  
latures, judges, governors and counselors of the  
.stales, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may vi tun to n-1 i i e const!tution d right -  
and liberties of the .Slid sat I people, or who  
for other causes, good or bad, may be obnoxious  
to the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, publi ■ or person­  
al; that the friendT■ -s alien ha- been selected as  
the safest subject of a lirst experiment, but the  
citizen will soon tallow, or rather has already  
followed; for, already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested at the  
’threshold may tend to drive these States into  
revolution and blood, and will furnish new calum­  
nies against republican government and new  
pretexts for those who wish it to be believed that  
man cannot he governed but by a rod of iron;  
that it. would lie a dangerous delusion wore a  
confidence in 11m men of our choice to silence  
our fears for the safety of our rights; that con­  
fidence is everywhere the paren&#x27; of despotism;  
tree government is founded in jealousy and not  
in coulidence; it is jealousy and not confidence  
which prescribes limited constitutions to bind  
down those whom we are obliged to triml with  
power, that our constitution has lixed the limits  
to which, and no further our confidence may go;  
and let fit - honest advocate of coulidence re.ul  
the alien and sedition acts, and say if the consti­  
lion has not been wise in fixing limits to the gov­  
ernment it created, and whether wo should be  
wise in destroying those limit-.&#x27; Get him say  
what the government is, if it bo not a tyranny,  
which the men of our choice have conferred on  
the President, and the Piv. ident of our choice has  
assented to and accepted over the friendly stran­  
gers, to whom tin- mild .spirit of our country and  
its laws have pledged hospital!ty and protection;  
that the men of our choice have more respected  
the bare suspicions of the President than thu solid  
rights ol innocence, the claims of justification,  
the sacred force of truth, and the forms and sub­  
stance of law and justice. In questions ol pow.gr.  
then, let no more be heard of coniidence in ra in,  
but bind him down from mischief by the chains  
of the constitution. That this commonwealth  
does therefore call on its co-states for an expres­  
sion of their sentiments on the acts concerning  
aliens, and for punishment of certain crimes,  
hereinbefore specified, plainly declaring whether  
these are or are not authorized by the Federal  
compact. And it doubts not tlmt their sense will  
be so announced ns to prove their attachment  
unaltered to limited government, whether gen­  
eral or paiticular, and that the rights and liber­  
ties of their co-states will bo exposed to no dan­  
gers by remaining embarked on a common bottom  
with their own. But they will concur with this  
commonwealth in considering the said acts as so  
palpable against the constitution as to amount to  
an undisguised declaration that that compact is  
not meant to lie thu measure of the power of the  
General Government, but that it will proceed in  
the exercise over these states ol all powers what­  
soever. That they will view this as seizing thu  
rights of the states and consolidating them in the  
hands of the General Government, with the power  
assumed to hind the states, not merely in cases  
made Federal, but in all cases whatsoever, by  
laws made not with their consent, but by others  
against (heir consent; that this would ho to sur­  
render the form of government wo have chosen,  
and living under one deriving its power from its  
own will, and not from our authority; and that  
the co-states recurring to their natural rights in  
cases not made Federal will concur in declaring  
those void and of no force, and will each unite  
with this commonwealth in requesting their re­  
peal at the next session of Congress

e Act of Congress, passed on  
the 14th day ol July. 17t)S. and entitled &quot;an act  
in addition to an act entitle 1 an act lor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United Sta­  
les;&#x27;&#x27; as also the act passed by them on the 27tli  
ol June, 1798. ‘‘entitled an net to punish frauds  
committed on the bank of the United States&quot; (and  
nil their other acts which assumes to create, de­  
fine or ptrnis&#x27;h-crimes other than those enumera  
led in Ihe constitution,) are altogether void and  
of no force, and that the power I o create, define J  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and ol  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
states, cadi within its own territory.  
Resolved. That it is true, as a gen ral princi­  
ple, and is also expressly declared by one of the  
amendments to the constitution, tb it the -power.*  
not delegated to the I nited States by the consti­  
tution. nor prohibited by it to the states, are re­  
served to the states respectively. or to the peo­  
ple-;” and that no power over the freedom of re­  
ligion. freedom of speech, or freedom ol the press  
being delegated to the United States by tb&quot; con­  
striction, nor prohibited by it to the stales, all  
lawful powers respecting the same did of right  
rentals- and were reserved to the slates or the  
people; that liras was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves the right of judging  
how far the licentiousness of speech and ot the  
press may lie abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom: tnd how far those abuse* which can  
not be separated from their use should be tolera  
ted rather than the use be destroyed and thus al*o  
they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
States, of the freedom of religious opinions and  
exercises, and retained to themselves the right of  
protecting 111- same, as tins state, by a law passed  
on the general demand ol its citizens, had already  
protected them Irom all human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made by one ol  
the amendments to the consiitiiiion, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting tne free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the freedom of speech or of the press.&#x27;&#x27; thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of Ihe press, insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted cither, throws down the sanctuary which cov­  
ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and d&gt; f­  
amation. equally with heresy and false religion.  
;;re witbeld from th&quot; cognizance of Federal tribu­  
nals. That therefore ihe net ot the congress  
‘Of the t rated States, passed on the 1 4tii of July,  
1798, entitled &quot;an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled an act for the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United Suites.&quot; which does abridge  
Ihe freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
gether void and ot no force.  
Resolved, That alien friends arc under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws ol the states  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to the United States, nor prohibi­  
ted to individual states distinct from their power  
over citizens, and it being true as a general prin­  
ciple, and one of the amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared that &quot;the powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
the stales respectively, or to the people,” ihe act  
of the congress of the United Stales, passed the  
22nd day ol July, 1798, assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the Constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved, That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as well as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution,  
Irom abundant caution has declared that -the  
migration or importation of such persons ns any  
&#x27;clt tiro states now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year ISOS;” that this commonwealth  
does admit Ihe migration of alien friends describ­  
ed ns the subject ot Ihe said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all nets equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory: that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is, therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
Resolved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his lailure to obey the simple order ol  
the President, to depart out of the United States,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled “an act  
‘concerning aliens&quot; is contrary lo the constitu­  
tion. ime amendment to which has provided that  
ho person shall Ire deprived of liberty without due  
proems ol law,” raid that nlrolher having provi­  
ded.&#x27;ohat in all criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right to public trial by an im­  
partial jury, to be informed of the nature and  
cause of the accusation, to be conlronled with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess lor obtaining witnesses in his favor, raid to  
have the assistance of counsel for Ids defence.&#x27;’  
the same act undertaking to authorize ihe Presi­  
dent to remove a per-on out of the United States  
who is under Ihe protection oi the 1 iw, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
In his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of tire constitu­  
tion, and is. therefore, not a law, but utterly  
Void, and of no lorce. The transferring the power  
of judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion ol the laws, Irom the courts to the President  
of the United Slates as is undertaken by lira same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that “the judicial  
power of the United Stales shall lie vested in  
‘courts, the judges ol which shall hold their offices  
during good behavior,” raid the said act is void  
lor that reason also, and it is further lo be noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on nil legislative powers.

articles will bo a fit and necessary subject for re­

Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this

cd to communicate the preceding resolutions to

them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national puVpbsoS, and particularly for  
(hot&#x27;e specified in their late federal compact, to  
be friendly lo the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of all tbe States—that faithlul to that com­  
! pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of self gov­  
ernment. and transfer them lo a general and cou­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not (or the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, this commonwc ilth is’determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, to submit to un­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited power*

acts before specified should stand, those conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place any act they think proper

whether enumerated or not enumerated by the

being by these precedent- reduced as outlaws to  
the absolute dominion of ode ifr.u. and the har­  
riers of the constitution thus swept from ns all,  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority ot the same body, the legisla­  
tures, ..udges. governors and counselors of the  
states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights

other causes, good or bud, may be obnoxious to  
the views, or marked ley the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to Ills or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather lias already  
followed; for, already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That those and successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pfttexts  
for those who wish it to be believed that man  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron: that it  
would bo a dangerous delusion were a confidence  
in the men of our choice to silence our fears for  
the safety of our rights: that confidence is every­  
where the parent of despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged lo trust with power, that our con­  
stitution lias liked the limits to Which, and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate of confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say if the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it ere .toil.and  
whether we should be wise in destroying those |  
limits? Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not „ , . r.,nuy. which the men of our choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident of our choice has assented lo and accepted  
over the friendly strangers, lo whom the mild  
spirit of our country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men of our  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights ol innocence,  
the claims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the form and substance of law and jus­  
tice, In qm-stious ol power, then, let no more lie  
heard of confidence in man. hut hind him down  
from mischief by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth docs therefore cull on  
its co-states for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, And for punishment  
ol certain crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly  
declaring w hether those are or are not authorized  
by the Federal compact. And it doubts not that  
their smnse will bo so announced as lo prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular,and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-states will lie exposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked bn a common  
bottom with their own. Rut they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meant to be the measure of the  
power of the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever, by laws made not with their consent,  
hut hy others against their consent; that this  
would be to surrender the form ol government  
we have chosen, and living under one deriving  
its power from its own will, and uot Irom onr au­  
thority; and that the co-states recurring to their  
natural rights in cases not made Federal will con­  
cur in declaring these void and of no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con­  
grels

wherein they are; that no power over them has i  
been delegated to the United Stales, nor prohibi- I

of the congress of the United States, passed the  
22nd day ul July. 1798. assumes power over aliens

meant by the instrument to be subsidiary only to  
th? execution of limited powers, ought not to be  
  
so construed ns to give unlimited power*, nor a  
part of them to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue of the instrument. That the proceeding  
of the general government undercolor of those  
articles will be a lit and necessary subject for re­  
visal aud correction at a time of great tranquili­  
ty, while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.

i at the next session of congress a repeal of the  
I aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly. That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures* the several states, to assure  
| them that this commonwealth consider* union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to  
be friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of all the States—that faithlul to that com­  
p.ict, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states ail the powers of self gov­  
ernment. and transfer them to a gene al and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations aud reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not lor the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these slates. Anil  
that, therefore, this commomve Ith is determined, I  
as it doubts not it co-states are. to submit to un- j  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers j  
in no man. or body ot men. on earth; that if the I  
acts before specified should stand, Hies; conclu- j  
sions would grow from them, that the general j  
government may place any act ttiey think proper  
on the list ol crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself b ; the licenser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions in iv be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, liis officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu- |  
able description of the inhabitants of these states, i  
being by these precedents reduced as outlaws to I  
the absolute dominion of one m .n, and the bir­  
riets ot the constitution thus swept from us till. I  
no r.unpirt now remains against the passion* and i  
the power ol a majority of Congress to protect j  
from a lik- exportation or other grievous punish- ;  
ml the minority of the same bo ly, the legisl i­  
tures,judges, governors and counselors ot the,  
states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who !  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights ■  
anil liberties ol the states and people, or who tor  
other causes, good or bad, in iv be obnoxious to  
the views, or m irked by the suspicions ol the  
President, or to lie thought dangerous to his or ;  
then- election or other interest, public or person- !  
al: th it the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the!  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
billowed; for, already has a sedition act m irked ;  
him as ils prey, Th it these successive acts  
of the s.im ■ character, uul -ss arrested tit the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish now calumnies  
against republican government. and new pretexts  
for those who wish it to be believed that man  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron: th it it  
would be a d itigeious delusion were a confidence |  
in the men of our choice to silence our fears for |  
the safely of our rights; that confidence is every- |  
where the parent of despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in-confidence; it is i  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom i  
we are obliged to trust with power, that our con- i  
stitution has fixed the limits to which, and no fur- I  
th-r our confidence mly go; and let the honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition j  
acts, and say it the constitution has not been wise j  
in fixing limits to the government it ere ited, an I  
whether we should be wise in destroying those  
limits? Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres- !  
ideut ol onr choice li is assented to and accepted j  
over the friendly strangers, to whom the mild I  
spirit of onr country and ils laws have pledged j  
hospitality and protection; that the men ol our  
choice have more respected the hare suspicions of :  
ih&quot; President than the solid rights ot innocence,  
the claims ol justification, the sacred force of I  
truth, and the form and substance of law and jus- j  
tice. In qn stions ol power, then, let no more bo I  
heard of confidence in mm, but bind him down I  
Iroin mischief by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-states lor an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
of certain crimes hereinbefore specified, pliinly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized \
by the Federal compact. And it doubts not that  
their sense will be so announced as to prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
wb -ther general or particul ir, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-states will lie exposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. lint they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meant to lie tlie measure of the  
power of the general government, but Ih it it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of nil  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with llv&gt; power assumed to bind the slates, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all c ises  
wh itso-&#x27;vcr, by laws mad* not with their consent,  
but by others against their consetfl; that this  
would bo to surrender the form ot government  
we have chosen, and living under one deriving  
its power from its own will, and not from onr au­  
thority; and that the co slates recurring to their  
natural rights in cases not mule Federal wilt con­  
cur in declaring these void and ol no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con­  
grets

the execution of limited powers, ought uot to be  
  
so construed as to give unlimited powers, nor a ;  
pari ol them to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue ol the instrument. That the proceeding &#x27;  
ol the general,government undercolor ol those  
articles will bo a tit and necessary subject for re­  
vised and correction at a time of great tranquil!- j

I aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ol the several slates, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for !  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
I those specified in their late federal compact, to  
! lx- iHeadly to the peace, happiness, and prosper- j  
! jty of all the Slates —that faith ul to that coin-*;  
pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe that to |  
take from the states all the powers of sell gov- j  
eminent, and transfer them to ,i gene -aland con­  
solidated government, without regard to the i  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not lor the peace,1

that, therefore, thiscomnioinve Ith is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are. to submit to un­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no m in. or body of m -it. on earth, that if the  
acts belore specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place any act they think proper  
on the list ol crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any

e Act of Congress, passed on  
the 14th day of July, 17if 8, and entitled “an act  
in addition to an act entitle 1 an act tor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United Sta­  
tes:” as also the -act passed by them on the 27th  
of June, 1798, “entitled an act to punish frauds  
committed on the bank of the United States&quot; (and  
all their other acts which assumes to create, de­  
fine or punish crimes oi her than those enumcra  
icd in the constitution.) are altogether void and  
of no force, and that the power lo create, define  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
stales, each within its own territory.  
Resolved, That it is tine, as a general princi­  
ple, and is also expressly declared by one of the  
amendments to the constitution, that the -powers  
not delegated to the United States by the consti­  
tution. nor prohibited by it to the states, are re­  
served to the states respectively, or to the peo­  
ple;” and that no power over the freedom of re­  
ligion. freedom ol speech, or freedom ot lh“press  
being delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the slates, all  
lawful powers respecting the same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the states or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves the right of judging  
how far the licentiousness of speech ami of the  
press ra ly be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom:and how farthose abuses which can  
not bo separated from their use should lie (uteri  
ted rather than the use lie destroyed and thus also  
they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
States, of the freedom of religious opinions and  
exercises, and retained to themselves the right ol  
protecting the same, as this state, by a law passed  
on the general demand of its citizens, had already  
protected them from ail human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made bv one of  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the freedom of speech or of the press.” thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down the sanctuary wtiich cov­  
ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and def­  
amation, equally with heresy and false religion,  
are witheld from the cognizance of Federal tribu­  
nals. That therefore the act ot the congress  
ol the United States, passed on the 14th of July.  
1798, entitled &quot;an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled an act for the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United States,” which does abridge  
the freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
gether void and ol no force.  
° Resolved. That alien friends are under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws ot the slates  
wherein they are; licit no power over them has  
been delegated to the United States, nor prohibi­  
ted to individual states distinct from their power  
over citizens, and it being true as a general prin­  
ciple, and one ot the amendments to the constitu- i  
tioa having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
the states respectively, or to the people,” the act  
of the congress of the United States, passed the  
«2nd day ot July. 1798, assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as well as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution,  
from abundant caution has declared that “the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
of the states now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not bo prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth !  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject ot the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision agiinst prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent lo the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is, therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
Resolved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under tbe protection of the laws of this common-.,  
wealth on his lailnre to obey the simple order of  
the President, to depart out of the United States,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled “an act  
concerning aliens” is contrary to the constitu­  
tion, one amendment to which has provided that  
no person shall lie deprived of liberty withoutdue  
process of law,” and that another having provi­  
ded, &quot;(hat in all criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right to public trial by an im­  
partial jury, to bo informed of the nature and  
causa of the accusation, to bo confronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel for his defence,”  
the same act undertaking lo authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United Slates  
who is under the protection of the law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is

destroy the general gov­  
ernment (as evinced by sundry of their proceed­  
ings) to those parts of the constitution of the U.  
Stales, which delegate to congress the power to  
levy and collect taxes, duties, impost, excises; lo  
pay the debts and provide for the common defence  
and general welfare of the United Slates, and to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and prop­  
er for carrying into execution the powers vested  
by the constitution in the government of the U.  
States, or in any department or officer thereof,  
goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to  
their power by the constitution—that words  
meant by the instrument to bo subsidiary only to  
the execution of limited powers, ought not to be  
  
so construed as to give unlimited powers, nor a  
part of them to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue of the instrument. That the proceeding  
of the general government undercolor ol those  
articles will be a lit and necessary subject for ro­  
visal and correction at a time of great tranquili­  
ty, while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the senators and representatives  
in Congress from the commonwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal ot the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ol the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to  
be friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of all the States—that failhlul to that com­  
pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of self gov­  
ernment. and transfer them to a general and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not (or the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, thiscommonwe dth is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, to submit to un­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
I in no man. or body of men. on earth; that if the  
| acts before specified should stand, these concln-  
I sionswould grow from them, that the general  
j government may place any act they think proper  
on the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
; whether enumerated nr not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions m iv be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, his otiicer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants of these states,  
being by these precedents reduced as outlaws to  
the absolute dominion of one ra .n, and the bar­  
riers ol the constitution thus swept from us all.  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of the same body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. governors and counselors of the  
states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties of the states and people, or who lor  
other causes, good or bad. maybe obnoxious to  
the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al: that tiie friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
tallowed; for. already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, unb&#x27;ss arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish now calumnies  
against republican government, and now pretexts  
for those who wish it to bo believed that min  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence  
in the meu of our choice to silence onr fears for  
the safely of our rights: that confidence is every­  
where the parent of despotism: free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down (hose whom  
we are obliged to trust with power, that onr con­  
stitution has fixed the limits to which,and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate ol confidence re id the alien and sedition  
acts, and say if the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it ere ited. an I I  
whether wc should be wise in destroying those i  
limits? Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice I  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident of onr choice has assented to and accepted  
over the friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of onr country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men ol onr  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights of innocence,  
the claims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the form and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In qii&#x27; stioas ol power, then, lot no more tic  
heard of confidence in man. but bind him down  
from mischief by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth docs therefore call on  
its co-states for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
of certain crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the Federal compact. And it doubts not that  
their sense will be so announced as to prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
wh ther general or particular, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-states will be exposed to  
nod nigofs by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. Rut they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said nets  
as so palpable against ilio constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meant to lie the measure of the  
power of the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rigliis of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever, by laws made not with their consent,  
but by others against their consent; that this  
would be to surrender the lonn of government  
wo have chosen, and living under one deriving  
its power from its own will, and not from our au­  
thority; and that the co-states recurring to their  
natural rights ia cases not made Federal will con­  
cur in declaring these void and ot no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next session of Cou­  
grets

jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind dow t those whom  
we are oblig.&#x27;ii io trust with power, that our con­

in fixing limits lo the government it ere ted. an I  
whether we should be wise in de-troying those  
limits? Let him say whatthe government is. if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice  
h ive conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident oi our choice has assented to and accepted  
over ihe friendly strangers, lo whom the mild  
spirit ol onr country and its laws have pl &#x27;.iged

That this commonwealth does therefore call on

no dangers by rein lining embarked on a common

this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declantion that Hie

power ot the geivr.il government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That I Ivy will view this as

with Hie power assumed to bind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all c ises  
whatsoever, by laws made not with their consent,

would be to surrender the form ol government  
we have chosen, tnd living under one deriving  
its power from i&#x27;s own will, anil not from our au­

natural rights t t c .aes not in nle Federal will con

Resolved. That it is true, as a general princi­

protecting th- same, as this stale, by a law passed  
on th - gen-ral demand ol its citiz-ns, bad already  
protected them from all human restraint or inter­

principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision lias been m ide bv otic- ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly d&#x27;-cl ires, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging

guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, ol speech,  
and of Hie press, insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down ill- sanctuary which rov­  
ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and d- f­  
amadou, equally with heresy and false religion,  
are with- ld from the cognizance ol federal tribu­

ol the United Stales, passed on the I 41!i ol July.  
1798, entitled &quot;an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled ni net (or the punishment of certain crimes

the freedom of the press is not law, Inti is alto­  
gether void and ot no force.  
Resolved. Th it alien tri-nds are under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws ol the states  
wherein they are; ihat no pow-r over them 1: is  
been delegated to th- United States, nor piohibi­  
ted to individual states distinct bum their power

ciple, and one ol the amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared thil -the powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
the slates respectively, or to the people.” the act  
of the congress of the United States, pas-ad the  
22nd day ot July. 1798, assumes pow er over ali ,-ns  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, hut  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved, That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as w 11 as file express tied n-.ition, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserve I, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution.  
Irotn abundant caution lies declared that -the  
migration or importation ul such persons as any  
ol the stales now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year 1808;&quot; that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as tlie subject ol the said act concerning alien.-;  
that a provision agdnst prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would lie nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is eqniv lent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration. uni is. therefore, con­  
trary to the add provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
R solved. That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the lows of this common­

the President, to dep irt out ol tlie United Stales,

cause ot the accusation, to lie coillrouted with the  
witnesses against him. to have compulsory pro­  
cess lor old.lining witnesses in his favor, and to

who is under the protection ol the law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him. without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defens-, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also ol the constitu­  
tion, and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no force. The transferring the power  
ol judging any person who is under the protec­

tion having also declared that &quot;the powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
the slates respectively, or to the people,” the act  
of the congress of the United States, passed the  
2ind day ot July. 1798, assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of noloree.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as wall as the express declaration, th.it pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution,  
from abundant caution has declared that ••the  
migration or importation ol such persons as any  
ol the states now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not bo prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject ot the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would lie nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivilent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
K solved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on iiis failure to obey the simple order ol  
the President, to depart out ot the United States,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled &quot;an act  
I concerning aliens&quot; is contrary to the constitu­  
tion. one amendment to which lias provided that  
uu person shall lie deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” and Hut another having provi­  
ded. &quot;that iu all criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right to public trial by an im­  
partial jury, to lie informed of the nature and  
cause ol the accusation, to be confronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance ol counsel for his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection ol the law. on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
in hi» favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of the constitu­  
tion, and is. therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no lorce. The transferring the power  
ol judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of the laws, from the courts to the President  
of the United Slates as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that &quot;the judicial  
power of the United Stales shall be vested in  
courts, the judges ot which shall hold their offices  
during good behavior,” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
, on all legislative powers.

ernment (as evinced by sundry of their proceed­  
&#x27; ings) to those parts of the constitution of the U.  
States, which delegate to congress the power to  
levy and collect taxes, duties, impost, excises; to  
I pay the debts and provide for the common defence  
1 and general welfare of the United Stales, and to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and prop­  
er tor carrying into execution the powers vested  
by the constitution in the government of the U.  
States, or in any department or officer thereof,  
goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to  
their power by the constitution—that words  
meant by the instrument to be subsidiary only to  
; the execution ot limited powers, ought not to be  
  
so construed as to give unlimited powers, nor a  
part of them to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue ol the instrument. That the proceeding  
of the general government undercolor ol those  
articles will be a tit and necessary subject for re­  
visal and correction at a time of great tranquili­  
ty. while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted lo the senators and representatives  
in Congress from the commonwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and lo use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal of the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed lo communicate the preceding resolutions lo  
the legislatures ol the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to  
be friendly lo the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity ol all the Slates—that faithlul lo that com­  
pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of self gov­  
ernment, and transfer them to a gene-al and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not lor the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, Ihiscotninonwe Ith is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, lo submit to utt­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body of men, on earth; that if the  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place any act they think proper  
on the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by tin?  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants of these states,  
being by these precedents reduced as outlaws lo  
the absolute dominion of one m ,n, and the bar­  
riers of the constitution thus swept from us all.  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of the same body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. governors and counselors of the  
states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights I  
and liberties of the states and people, or who lor  
other causes, good or bad. may be obnoxious to  
the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al: that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
billowed; for, already has a sedition act m irked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, uni--ss arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government. and new pretexts  
fur those who wish it to be believed that man  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence  
in the men of our choice to silence our fears for  
the safety of our rights; that confidence is every­  
where the parent of despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to trust with power, that our con­  
stitution has fixed the limits to which.and no fur- ,  
ther our confidence may go; and let the honest |  
advocate o( confidence read the alien and sedition ;  
acts, and say if the constitution has not been wise j  
in fixing limits lo the government it ere ited. an I  
whether we should be wise in destroying those |  
limits? Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice !  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident ol our choice has assented to and accepted  
over tlie friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of onr country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men ol our  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights ol innocence,  
the claims of justification, the sacred force ol  
truth, and the lorm and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In qu stions ol power, then, let no more be  
heard of confidence in man. but bind him down  
Iron) mischief by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-states lor an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
ol certain crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the federal compact. And it doubts not that  
their sense will be so announced as to prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-states will be exposed lo  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. IJul they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meant to be the measure of the  
power ol the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the stales, not  
merely in cases made federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever. by laws made not with their consent,  
but by others against their consent; that this  
would be to surrender the form ol government  
wo have chosen, md living under one deriving  
its power from its own will, and uot from oar au­  
thority; and that the co-slates recurring to their  
natural rights i a cases not made federal will con­  
cur in declaring these void and of no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con­  
grets

e Act of Congress, passed on  
the 14th day of July. 1798, and entitled “an act  
in addition to an act entitled an act lor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United Sta­  
tes;&quot; as also the act passed by them on the 27tlr  
ol June, 1198, “entitled an net to punish frauds  
committed on the bank ot the United States&quot; (and  
all their other acts which assumes to create, de­  
fine or punish crimes other than those enumera­  
ted in the constitution.) are altogether void and  
of no force, and that the power to create, define  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
slates, each within its own territory.  
Resolved. That it is true, as a general princi­  
ple, and is also expressly declared by one of the  
amendments to the constitution, that the “powers  
not delegated to the United States by the consti­  
tution, nor prohibited hy it to the states, are re­  
served to the suites respectively, or to the peo­  
ple;&quot; and that no power over the freedom of re­  
ligion. freedom of speech, or freedom ol the press  
being delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited hy it lo the states, all  
lawful powers respecting the same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the slates or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves the right of judging  
how far the licentiousness ot speech and of the  
press mvy be abridged without lessening their  
1 uselitl freedomtand how far those abuses which can  
j not be separated from their use should be lolera­  
i ted rather than the use be destroyed and thus also  
■ they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
! States, of Ihe freedom of religious opinions and  
| exercises, and retained to themselves the right ol  
| protecting the same, as this slate, by a law passed  
on the general demand of its citizens, had already  
! protected them from all human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition lo this general  
! principle and express declaration, another and  
! more special provision has been made by one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the freedom of speech or of the press.” thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
■and of the press, insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down the sanctuary which cov­  
i ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and def­  
amation, equally with heresy and false religion,  
are witheld from the cognizance of Federal tribu­  
i nals. That therefore the act ol the congress  
j ol the United States, passed on the 14th of July,  
1798, entitled “an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled an act (or the punishment ot certain crimes  
j against the United Slates,” which does abridge  
| the freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
! gether void and of no force.  
I ” Resolved, That alien friends are under the ju­  
j risdiction and protection of the laws ol the states  
1 wherein they are; that no power over them has  
i been delegated to the United .Stales, nor prohibi­  
i ted lo individual slates distinct from their power  
over citizens, and it being true as a general prin­  
j ciple, and one of the amendments to the constitu-  
I tion having also declared that “the powers not&#x27;  
delegated to the United States are reserved lo  
the states respectively, or to the people.” the acl  
I of the congress of the United States, passed the  
“2nd day ot July. 1798, assumes power over aliens  
1 not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
| is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as well as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
-pedal provision inserted in the constitution  
trom abundant caution &#x27;has declared that -the  
migration or importation ot such persons as any  
ol the states now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
i or to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien Iriends describ­  
ed as lhe subject ot the said act concerning aliens;  
j that a provision against prohibiting their inigra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would he nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution.  
I and void.  
i Resolved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under tli“ protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his (allure to obey the simple order ol  
I the President, to depart out ot the United States,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled &quot;an acl  
concerning aliens” is contrary to the constitu­  
tion. one amendment to which has provided that  
no person shall lie deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,”&#x27;and that another having provi­  
ded. -that in all criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right to public trial by an im­  
partial jury, to be informed of the nature and  
cause ot the accusation, to lie confronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess lor obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel lor his defence.”  
tlie same act undertaking lo authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out ol the United States  
who is under the protection of the law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of the constitu­  
tion, and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no force. The transferring the power  
ot judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of the laws, from Ihe courts to the President  
of the United States as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that “thejudicial  
power of the United Stales shall lie vested in

for that reason also, and it is further to be noted

al: that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the

where the parent of despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to trust with power, that our con­  
stitution has lixed the limits to which, and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go: and let the honest  
advocate ot confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say if the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it created, an I  
whether we should be wise in destroying those  
limits&#x27;.&#x27; Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice  
have conferred upon Ihe President, and the Pres­  
ident of our choice has assented to and accepted  
over the friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of onr country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men ol our

That this commonwealth does therefore cal 1 on

ol certain crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by tin,- Federal compact. And it doubts not that  
their sense will be so announced as to prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights

In addition to an act entitled an act lor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United Sta­  
tes:&quot; as also the act passed by them on the 27th  
ol June, 1798. &quot;entitled an act to punish frauds  
committed on the bank ol the United States&quot; (and  
all their other acts which assumes to create, de­  
fine or punish crimes other than those enumera­

of no force, and that the power to create, define  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
states, each within its own territory.  
Resolved, That it is tine, as a general princi­  
ple, and is also expressly declared by one of the  
i amendments to the constitution, that the -powers  
not delegated to the United States by the consti­  
tution. nor prohibited by it to the slates, are re­

how far the licentiousness of speech and of the  
press mly be abridged without lessening tfleir

not be separated from th dr u should be tolera­  
ted rather titan th&quot; use lie destroyed and thus also

protecting th&quot; same, as this slat&quot;, by a law passed  
on lit&quot; general demand of its citizens, had already  
protected them Irom all human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made by one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress sh ill make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the fr -edom of speech or of the press.’’ thereby

same word*, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down the sanctuary which cov­  
ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and def­  
amation. equally with heresy and false religion,  
are witheld Irom the cognizance of Federal tribu­  
nals. That therefore the act ol the congress  
ot the United States, passed on the I 4th of July.  
1798, entitled “an act in addition to the net enti­  
tled an act lor the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United .Stales.” which does abridge  
the freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
gether void and o( no force.  
Resolved, That alien friends arc under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws ot the states  
wherein they are; l hat no power over them has  
been delegated to the United Stales, nor prohibi­  
ted to individual states distinct Irom their power  
, over citizens, and it being true as a general prin­  
ciple, and one of the amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared that &quot;tli - powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
the stales respectively, or to the people.” the act  
of the congress of lit&#x27;- United States, passed the  
•’2nd day ol July. 1798. assumes power over aliens  
not ih-1-’gated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no lorce.  
Resolv- il. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple asw -11 as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution.  
Irom a mndant caution has declared that -the  
migration or importation ol such persons as any  
ot th -states now existing glial) think proper to  
admit shall not le- prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to lie; year Iso.s;” that thi&lt; commonwealth  
does admit III&quot; migration of alien 1 fiends describ­  
ed as the subject ol the said act concerning ali&quot;tis;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is eqnivilent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, eon­  
tr.iiY to the said provision ol the constitution,  
and void.  
Resolved. That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order of  
the [’resident, to depart out ol the United States,  
as is undertaken by the said&#x27;act entitled &quot;an act  
concerning aliens” is contrary to the constitu­  
tion. one amendment to which has provided that  
no person shall lie deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” and that another having provi­  
ded. “I hat in all criminal prosecutions the accus­

who is under the protection of the 1 nv, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
in liis favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of the constitu­

void, and of no lorce. The transferring the power  
ol judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of the laws. Irom the courts to the President  
ol the United States as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that “the judicial  
power of the United Stales sh all be vested in  
courts, the judges ol which shall hold their offices  
during good behavior,” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that litis transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers.

destroy the general gov­  
ernment (as evinced by sundry of their proceed­  
ings) to those parts ot the constitution of the IT.  
States, which delegate to congress the power to  
levy and collect faxes, duties, impost, excises; to  
pay lit&quot; debts and provide for the common defence  
and general welfare of the United States, and to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and prop­  
er lor carrying into execution Ihe powers vested  
by the constitution in the government of Hie U.  
Stales, or in any department nr officer thereof,  
goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to  
their power by the constitution —that words  
meant by the instrument to be subsidiary only to  
the execution ol limited powers, ought not to be  
  
bo construed as to give unlimited powers, nor a  
part of them to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue of the instrument. That the proceeding  
ot the general government undercolor of those  
articles will be a lit and necessary subject for re­  
visal and correction at a time of great tranquili­  
ty, while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call lor immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the senators and representatives i  
in Congress Irom the commonwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal of the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures of the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to  
he triendly to the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of all the States —that laithlul to that com­  
pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parlies, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of self gov­  
ernment. and transfer them to a general and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not (or the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, this commonwealth is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, lo submit to un­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body of men, on earth; that if the  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place any act they think proper  
on the list ul crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whoso suspicions may be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants of those states,  
being by these precedents reduced as outlaws to  
the absolute dominion of one man, and the bar­  
riers of the constitution thus swept from us all,  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
tram a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of the same body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. governors and counselors of the  
slates, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties of the states and people, or who for  
other causes, good or bad. may be obnoxious to  
(lie views, or marked by the suspicions ol the  
President, or to he thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has beJn selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather lias already  
billowed; for, already has a sedition act ra irked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, unl &#x27;ss arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion and liiood, and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government. and new pretexts  
for those who wish it to be believed that man  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would bo a dangerous delusion were a confidence  
in the men of our choice to silence our fears for  
the safely of our rights; that confidence is every­  
where the parent ol despotism; free government  
is lounded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to trust with power, that our con­  
stitution has fixed the limits lo which,and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say if the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it created, an I  
whether wo should be wise iu destroying tlio.se  
limit*&#x27;.&#x27; Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men ol our choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident of our choice lias assented to and accepted  
over the friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of our country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men ol our  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
tlie President than the solid rights of innocence,  
the claims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the form and substance of law ami jus­  
tice. lit questions ol power, then, let no more he  
heard of confidence in man. but bind him down  
irom mischief by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-states for an expression of their sentiments  
on I he acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
of certain crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly  
declaring whether those are or are not authorized  
by the Federal compact. And it doubts not that,  
their sense will be so announced as lo prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-states will lie exposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. Rut they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meant to ho the measure of the  
power of the general government, hut that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of tli ■ states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever, by laws made not with their consent,  
hut by others against their consent; that this  
would he to surrender the form ol government  
we have chosen, and living under one deriving  
its power from its own will, and not from our au­  
thority; and that, the co-states recurring to their  
natural rights i.i cases not made Federal will con­  
cur in declaring these void and ot no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con­  
grets

ernment. (as evinced by sundry of their proceed­  
ings) to those purls of the constitution of the U.  
Stales, which delegate to congress the power to  
levy and collect taxes, duties, impost, excises; lo  
pay th“ debts and provide for ihe common defence  
and general welfare of the United States, and to  
make all laws which shall he neecca &gt;ry and prop­  
er for carrying into execution the powers vested  
by (he constitution in the government, of Ihe U.  
States, or in any department or officer thereof,  
goes to (he destruction of nil limits prescribed to  
their power by the constitution—that words  
meant by the instrument to be subsidiary only to  
the execution of limited powers, ougjit not to be &#x27;  
  
so construed as to give unlimited powers, nor a  
part of them lo be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue ol the instrument. That the proceeding  
of tbe general government undercolor ol those  
articles will be a tit and necessary subject for re­  
visal and correction til a time ol great tranquili­  
ty. while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted lo the senators and representatives  
in Congress Irom tbe commonwealth, who are en­  
joined To present the same to their respective  
houses.and louse their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal ol the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ol the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to  
be friendly to the peace, happiness; and prosper­  
ity of all die Slates —that tailblul toth.it com­  
pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious tor its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all tbe powers of S&#x27;dl gov­  
ernment. and transfer them to a gene ;tl and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to In that compact, is not lor the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, thiscommonwe Ith is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, lo submit to mi­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body of men, on earth: that if the  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place any act they think proper  
on the list ol crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may hitnsell be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be  
the evidence, hi# order Ihe sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and ills breast the sole record ol  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description ol the inhabitants ol these slates,  
being by these precedent- reduced as outl tws to  
the absolute dominion of one m -it, and the bar­  
riers ol the constitution thus swept from ns all.  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority ol Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of the same body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. governors and counselors of the  
states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties of the slates and people, or who for  
other causes, good or bad, mly be obnoxious lo  
the views, or marked by the suspicions ol the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
billowed; for. already has a sedition act m irked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the Sara&quot; character, unl-ss arrested at Ihe thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretext#  
for those who wish it to he believed tli.it man  
cannot lie governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a d mgeious delusion were a confidence  
in Ihe men of our choice to silence our fears for  
tlie safely of our rights; that confidence is every­  
where the parent oi despotism; (roe government  
is lounded in jealousy and not in confidence; it i#  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to hind down tho#e whom  
we are obliged to trust, with power, that our con­  
stitution has fixed the limits to which,and no fur­  
ther our cQiifidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say it the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it ore Red. an I  
whether we should be wise in destroying those  
limits? Get him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men ol onr choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident ol our choice lias assented to and accepted  
over the friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of onr country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men ol onr  
choice have more respected the I).ire suspicions ol  
the President than the solid rights ol innocence,  
Iheclaims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the |oi m and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In qu stions ol power, then, let no more be  
heard of confidence in man. hut hind him down  
Iroin mischief by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-states for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
of certain crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the Federal compact. And it doubts not that,  
their sense will be so announced as to prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-stales will be exposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. Rut they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration lhat Ihe  
compact is not meant to be (lie measure of the  
power of the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of Ihe stales and consolidating  
them in the hands of Ihe general government,  
with the power assumed to hind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all cases  
whalso&quot;Vor. by laws made not with their consent,  
lint by others against their consent; that this  
would be to surrender the form ot government  
w ■ have chosen, tnd living under one deriving  
i(# power from i‘r own will, and not from our au­  
thority; and that the co states recurring to their  
natural rights i i cases not made Federal will con  
enr-in declaring these void and of no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con­  
grels

Irom abundant caution has declared that &quot;the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
&#x27; ol the states now existing shall think proper to  
elniit shall not be prohibited by I In-congress pri­  
or to the year 18U8;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien triemls describ­

ol no force, and that the power to create, define  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
slates, each within its own territory.

protecting the same, as this state, by a law passed  
on the general demand of its citizens, had already  
protected them from all human restraint or inter  
ference; and that, in addition to (his geti-ral  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made hy one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the tree exercise thereof, or abridging

Resolved. Th it alien Iriend.s are under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws ot the sla&#x27;es  
wherein they -are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to the United Stales, nor piohibi­

ciple, and one ol the amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the United Stales are reserved to  
the states respectively, or to the people.” the act  
of the congress of the United States, passed the  
“2nd day ol July. 1798. assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and ol no force.

special provision inserted in the constitution

them when migrated is equiv lent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the Constitution,

tbe [’resident, to depart out ol the United .Stat&#x27;-s,

without public trial, without confrontation of the

contrary to these provisions also o) the constitu­

the constitution whi it provides th t &quot;thejudicial

for that reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­

go construed as to give unlimited powers, nor n  
part ot them to be taken, as to destroy tbe whole

of the general government under color ot those

Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ol the several states, to assure  
them lhat this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to  
be friendly to tbe peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of till Die Slates—that taithiul lolb.it com­  
pact. according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
lbi‘ several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of sell gov­  
ernment. and transfer them to a gene til and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not lor the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, thiscommonwe Ith is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, to submit to nil­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body ot men, on earth; that if the  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place any acl they think proper  
on the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated -by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast Die sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants of these states,  
being by these precedent- reduced as outlaws to  
the absolute dominion of one m n, and the bar­  
riers ol the constitution thus swept from us all,  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority ol Congress to protect  
from a lik&quot; exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of the same body, tbe legisla­  
tures, judges. governors and counselors of the  
states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim Die constitutional rights  
and liberties ol the states and people, or who for  
other causes, good or bad. may bn obnoxious to  
the views, or marked by the suspicions ol the  
President, or to tie thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public nr person­

the safest sn-j-ct of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has Already  
billowed; for, already has a sedition act in irked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the s tin- ch trader, nitb-ss arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these stall&#x27;s into revolu­  
tion and oiond. and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretexts  
for those who wish it to be believed tint m m  
cannot lie governed lint by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a d iitgerons delusion were a confidence  
in the men ol our citoice to silence our tears for  
the safety of our rights; that confidence is every­  
where the parent of despotism; free government  
is lonnded in jealousy and not in confidence; It is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to trust with power, that onr con­  
stitution It ts fixed the limits to which.and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate of confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say if the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it ere led, an I  
whether we should be wise in destroying those  
limits? Let him say what the government is. if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men ol our choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres  
iiient ol onr choice has assented to and accepted  
ovei the friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit ol onr country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men o( onr  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid fields ol innocence,  
Died.tints ol Justification, the sacred force ol  
truth, and the inrtn and sub-tance of law and jus­  
tice. In qit stions ol power then, let no more lie  
heard ol confidence in matt, but bind him down  
from mischiel by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-states lor an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, anil for punishment  
of certain crimes hereinbefore specified, pi only  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the Federal compact. And itdoubls not that  
their sense will be so announced as tn prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co stales will be exposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
hot loin with their own. liul they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount In an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not mean) to be tlie measure of the  
power ol the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, bill in all cases  
whatsoever, by laws made not with their consent,  
but by others against their consent; that this  
would be to surrender the form ol government  
we have chosen, md living under one deriving  
its power from i’s own will, and not from onr au­  
thority; and that the co states recurring to their  
natural rights i i cases not mode Federal willcon  
car in declaring these void and of no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con­

pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its

take from the states all the powers of self gov­

solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not lor the peace,  
happiness aml prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, this commonwealth is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, to submit to un­  
dclegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body ol men, on earth; that if the  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place&#x27;any act they think proper  
on the list ol crimes and pqnisb it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them.&#x27;th.il they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself he the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, his olheer  
the executioner, and his breast &#x27;.he sale&#x27;record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants of tbeie states,  
being by these precedent- reduced as outlaws to  
the absolute dominion of one m ,n, and the bar­  
riers ol the constitution thus swept from us all,  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of the same body,&#x27; the legisla­  
tures, judges. governors and counselors of the  
slates, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional&#x27; rights  
and liberties of the states and people, or who for  
other causes’, good or bad, mty be obnoxious to

the safest subject of a first experiment, but the

billowed; for, already bus a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these’and successive acts  
of the same character, nnl&quot;ss arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these slates into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretexts  
for those who wish it to lie believed lb.it man  
cannot lie governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence  
in the men of our choice to silence onr fears for  
the safety of our rights; thatconlidence is every­  
where the parent of despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
Untiled constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to (rust with power, that our con­  
stitution has fixed the limits to which,and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go; and lot the honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say if the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it ore ited. and  
whether wd should be wise in destroying thoSe  
limits! Let him say what the government is, If  
it be not a lyl-atiny. which the men of our choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident of our choice has assented to and accepted  
over the h&#x27;ienilly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of nitr country andilslaws have pledged  
hospitality ami protection; that the men ol our  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights of innocence,  
the claims of justification, the sacred force ol  
truth, and the form and sdb«tarice of law and jus­  
tice. In qn stions ol power, then, let no more be  
heard of confidence in man. bat bind him down  
from mischief by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call oa  
its co-states lor an expression of their sentiments  
on I he acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
ol certain crimes hereinbelord’ specified, plainly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the federal compact. And itdoubt-s not that,  
their sense will be so announced as to prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-states will he exposed to  
no danghrs by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom w)lh their own. Rut they will concur With  
this commonwealth in considering the said acta  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meant to be the measure of the  
power ol the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise oyer these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the slates; not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all oases  
whatsoever.by laws made not with their consent,  
but by others against their consent; that this  
would be to surrender the form ol government  
we have chosen, mil living under one deriving  
ils power from i*s own will, and not from o’ur au­  
thority; and that the co-stales recurring to their  
natural rights i.i cases not made Federal wlllcon  
enr in declaring these yoid and of no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con­

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

e Act of Congress, passed on  
the 14th day of July, 17118. and entitled “an act  
in addition to an act entitled an act tor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United Sta­  
tes;” as also t|ie act passed by them on tbe 27th  
ol June. 1798. “entitled an act to punish frauds  
committed ou the bank ol the United States” (and  
all their other acts which assumes to create, de­  
tine or punish crimes other than those enumera­  
ted in the constitution.) are altogether void and  
of no force, and that the power to create, define  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
states, each within its own territory.  
Resolved. That it i;; true, ns a general princi­  
ple. and is also expressly declared by one of the  
amendments to the constitution, that the “powers  
not delegated to the United States by the consti­  
tution. nor prohibited by it to the states, are re­  
served to the states respectively, or to the peo­  
ple;’and that no power oyer the freedom of re­  
ligion. freedom of speech, or freedom of the press  
being delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nqr prohibited by it to the states, all  
lawful powers respecting the game did of right  
remain, and were/reserved to the states or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves the right of judging  
how far the licentiousness of speech and of the  
press may be abridged without lessoning their  
useful freedomjand how fay those abuses which can  
not be separated from their use should be tolera­  
ted rather than the use lie destroyed and thus also  
they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
•States, ol&#x27; tlye freedom of religious opinions and  
exercises, and retained to themselves the right of  
protecting the same, as this state, by a law passed  
on the general demand of its citizens, had already  
protected them trout all human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition to this general  
principle pud express declaration, another and  
more special provision bus been made by one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law­  
respecting an establishmeut of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the freedonj of speech or of the press.” thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down the sanctuary which cov­  
ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and def­  
amation. equally with heresy and false religion,  
are witbelu from tbe cognizance of Federal tribu­  
nals. That therefore the act of the congress  
of the United States, passed on the 14th of July.  
1788, entitled “an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled an act for the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United States,” which does abridge  
the freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
gether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That alien friends are under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws of the states  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to the United States, nor prohibi­  
ted to individual states distinct from their power  
over citizens, and it being true as a general prin­  
ciple, and one of the amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the United Slates are reserved to  
the states respectively, or to the people,” the act  
of the congress of the United States, passed the  
22nd day ol July. 1798, assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as w-11 as the expressdeclaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution.  
Irom abundant caution has declared that “the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
ol the states now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to tlje year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject ot the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the coustitution,  
and void.  
  
Resolved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order of  
the President, to depart out of the United States,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled &quot;an act  
concerning aliens’’ is contrary to the constitu­  
tion, one amendment to which lias provided that  
no p&quot;rson shall he deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” and that another having provi­  
ded, &quot;Ihat in all criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy tho right to public trial by all im­  
partial jury, to be informed of tho nature and  
cause of the accusation, to bo confronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess lor obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel tor his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection of the law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to those provisions also of the constitu­  
tion, and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no force. The transferring tho power  
of judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of the laws, (rom tho courts to the President  
of the United States as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that ‘-thejudicial  
power pf the United Stales shall be vested in  
courts, tho judges ol which shall hold their offices  
during good behavior,” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers.  
Resolved, That the .construction applied by the

ernment (as evinced by sundry of their proceed­  
ings) to those parts of the constitution of the U.  
States, which delegate to congress the power to  
levy and collect faxes, duties, impost, excises; to  
pay t he debts and .provide for the common defence  
and general welfare of the United States, and to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and prop­  
er for carrying into execution the powers vested  
by tho constitution in the government of (he U.  
States, or in any department or officer thereof,  
goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to  
their power by the constitution —that words  
meant by tho instrument to be subsidiary only to  
the execution ol limited powers, ought not lobe  
  
bo construed as to give unlimited powers, nor a  
part of them to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue ot the instrument. That the proceeding  
ol the general government undercolor of those  
articles will be a tit and necessary subject for re­  
visa! and correction at a time pf great tranquili­  
ty. while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the senators and representatives  
in Congress from the commonwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal of the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ol the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified In their late federal compact, to  
be friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of all the States—that faithful to that com­  
pact. according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of self gov­  
ernment. and transfer them to a general and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, this common we Ith is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, to submit to un­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body of men, on earth; that if the  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may placeany act they think proper  
on the list of crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by ti;e  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizanpe to the President or any  
other person, wtio may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, hlg officer  
the executioner, and his breast the yole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants ot these slates,  
being by these precedents reduced as outlaws to  
the absolute dominion of one man, and the bar­  
riers of the constitution thus swept from us all,  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of thesame body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. governors and counselors of the  
states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
ami liberties of the states and people, or who for  
other causes, good or bad, rqay bo obnoxious to  
the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al: that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
followed; for, already hasa sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
of the same character, unless arrested tit the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion and blood,and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretexts  
for those who wish it to lie believed that man  
cannot be governed bpt by a rod of iron; that it  
won Id be a dangerous delusion were a confidence  
in the men of our choice to silence opr tears for  
the safety of our rights; that confidence is every­  
where the parent ol despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to trust with power, that our con­  
stitution has fixed (lie limits to which, and ho fur­  
ther our confidence piay go; and let the honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say it the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it ere Red, and  
whether we should be wise in destroying those  
limits&#x27;; Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident ol our choice has assented to and accepted  
over the friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit ol our country and ils laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men o( qnr  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions pf  
the President than the solid Halits of innocence,  
theclaims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the form and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In questions ol power, then, let no more be  
heard ol confidence in man. but bind liim down  
from mischief by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-states lor an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
ol certain crimes hereinbefore specified, plainly  
deploring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the Federal compact. And it doubts not that  
their sense will lie so announced as to prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-states will lie exposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. Rut they will concur with  
this commonwealth la considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is nut meant to be the measure of the  
power ol the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states pf all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever.by laws made not with their consent,  
but by others against (heir consent; that this  
would be to surrender the form ot government  
we have chosen, and living under one deriving  
ils power from its own will, and not from our au­  
thority; and that the co-states recurring tp their

cur in declaring these void and of no force, and

without public trial, without confrontation ofthe  
witnesses against hint, without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also ofthe constitu­

void, and ol no force. The transferring the power  
of judging any person who is under the protec­

the constitution which provides that “the judicial  
power of the United Stales shall be vested in

for that reason also, and it is further lo be noted

ernment (as evinced by sundry of their proceed­  
ings) to those parts of the constitution of the U.  
States, which delegate to congress the power to  
levy and collect taxes, duties, impost, excises; lo  
pay the debts and provide for Ihecommon defence  
and general welfare of the United States, and to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and prop­  
er for carrying into execution the powers vested  
by the constitution in (he government of (lie U.  
Slates, or in any department or officer thereof,  
goes to the destruction of all limitsprescribed to  
their power by the constitution —that words  
meant by (he instrument to be subsidiary only to  
the cxesution of limited powers, ought not to bo  
  
so construed ns to give unlimited powers, nor a  
part of them to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue ol the instrument. That the proceeding  
ol the general government undercolor ol those  
articles will be a lit and necessary subject for re­  
visal and correction at a time ol great tranquili­  
ty, while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the senators and representatives  
in Congress from the commonwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal of the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That tin; Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ol the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specilied national purposes, and particularly for  
those specilied in their late federal compact, to  
be friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of all (he States—that faithlul to that com­  
pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious lor Us  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of self gov­  
ernment, and transfer them to a general and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not (or the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these slates. Anil  
that, therefore, thiscommnnwe.dth is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, to submit to un­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body ol men, on earth: that if the  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu-  
would grow from them, that the general  
government may placeany act they think proper  
on the list ol crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself he the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whoso suspicions may be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants of these states,  
being by these precedent&#x27; reduced as outlaws to  
tln&gt; absolute dominion of one man, and the bar­  
riers of the constitution thus swept from ms all,  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority of Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of thesame body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. governors and counselors of the  
stales, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties of the states and people, or who lor  
other causes, good or bad. may be obnoxious to  
the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to bis or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
followed;for, already has.a sedition act marked  
him ns its prey. That these and successive acts  
ol the same character, unless arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion und*blood,and will furnish now calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretexts  
for those who wish it to be believed that man  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a dangerous delusion were a conlideuce  
in the men of our choice to silence our fears for  
the safely of our rights; that conlideuce isevery­  
where the parent of despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and nut confidence which proscribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
wo are obliged to trust with power, that our eon­  
stitutipn has fixed the limits to which,and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say it the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it ere i ted .and  
whether we should be wise in destroying those  
limits? Let him say what the government is. if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men ol our choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident of our choice has assented to and accepted  
over the friendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of our country uud its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men o( our  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights of innocence,  
(heclaims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the form and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In questions ol power, then, let no more bo  
heard of confidence in man. but bind him down  
from misehiel by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-states for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
of certain crimes beveinbelore specified, plainly  
declaring w hether these are or are not authorized  
by the I*ederal compact. And itdoubta not that  
their sense will be so announced as to prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights  
and liberties of their co-states will lie exposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. lint they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meanl to be the measure of the  
power ol the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever, by laws made not. with their consent,  
but by others against their consent; that this  
would be to surrender the form of government  
we have chosen, and living under one deriving  
its power from its own will, and not from our au­  
thority; and Uial the co-states recurring to their  
natural rights ia cases not made Federal willoon­  
enr in declaring these void and of no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at the next .session of Con­  
grets

he Act of Congress, passed on  
the 14th day of .Inly. 1708, and entitled “an act  
in addition to an act entitled an act lor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United .Sla­  
tes;” as also the act passed by them on the 27th  
ol June, 1798. “entitled an act to punish frauds  
1 committed on the bank of the United States” (and  
all their other acts which assumes to create, de­  
( Tne or punish crimes other than those ennmera  
ied in the constitution.) are altogether void and  
of no force, and that the power lo create, detine  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and ol  
| right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
I slates, each within its own territory.  
Resolved, That it is true, as a general princi-  
I pie. anil is also expressly declared by one of the  
amendments to the constitution, that the “powers  
not delegated to the United States by the consti­  
j tution. nor prohibited by it lo the states, are re-  
I served to the states respectively, or to the peo­  
! pie;” and that no power over the freedom of re-  
I Uglon, freedom of speech, or freedom ol thepress  
being delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, all  
lawful powers respecting the same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the states or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves the right of judging  
bow far the licentiousness of speech and of the  
press in ty be abridged without lessening their  
uselul freedom;and bow farthose abuses which can  
not bo separated from their use should be tolera  
ted rather than the use be destroyed and thus also  
they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
Slates, of the freedom of religions opinions and  
exercises, and retained to themselves the right of  
i protecting the same, as this slate, by a law passed  
I on the general demand ol its citizens, had already  
protected them Irom all human restraint or inter­  
ference ; and that, in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made by one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law­  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the freedom of speech or of Ihe press.” thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, insomuch, that w hatever viola­  
ted either, throws down the sanctuary which cov­  
ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and def­  
amation, equally with heresy and false religion,  
are witheld from the cognizance of Federal tribu­  
nals. That therefore the act of the congress  
ol the United States, passed oa the 14th of July.  
171)8, entitled “an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled in act lor the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United States,” which does abridge  
the freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
gether void and ol no force.  
Resolved. That alien friends are under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws ot the states  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to ihe United States, nor prohibi­  
ted to individual stales distinct Irom their power  
over citizens, and it lining true as a general prin­  
ciple,and one ofthe amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared that &quot;the powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
th“ states respectively, or to the people,” the act  
of the congress of Ihe United States, passed the  
22nd day ot July. 1798, assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as well as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution,  
Irom abundant caution has declared that -the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
ol the stales now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year 1808;&quot;’ that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject ot the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
Resolved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his lailure to obey Ihe simple order of  
the President, to depart out ot the United States,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled “an act  
concerning aliens” is contrary to the constitu­  
tion, one amendment to which has provided that  
no person shall be deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” and tb it another having provi­  
ded, “that in all criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right, to public trial by an im­  
partial jury, to be informed of the nature and  
cause ol the accusation, to be confronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess lor obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel lor his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection ol Ihe law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation ofthe  
witnesses against him. without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also ol the constitu­  
tion, and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no force. The transferring the power  
of judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of the laws, (rom the courts to the President  
of the United Slates as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that “thejudicial  
power of the United Stales shall bo vested in  
courts., the judges of which shall hold their offices  
during good behavior,” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, and if is further lo be noted  
thal this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers.

meant by Ihe instrument lo he subsidiary only to  
the execution of limited powers, might not to he  
  
so construed as to give unlimited powers, nor a  
part ol them to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue ol the instrument. That the proceeding  
ol the general government undercolor ol those  
articles will be a 111 and necessary subject for re­  
visal and correction al a time ol great tranquili­  
ty. while those speciiied in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the senators and representatives  
in Congress trom the commonwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the same to their respective  
houses.and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal ot the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth he, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures ol the several stales, to assure  
ihem that ihis commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, ami particularly for  
(hose specified in their late federal compact, to  
be liiendly to the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity ol all the Slates-th.it lailh ul to that com­  
pact. according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
lake Mom the stales all the powers of sell gov­  
ernment. mid tiousler them to a gene al and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations ami reseivalions, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not lor the pence,  
happimss and prosperity of these states. And  
that. therefore, thiscommouwe llh is determined,  
as it doubts not it eo-slalesarovlo submit to nn­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body ol men. on earth; that if »lie  
nets before speeitbd should stand, these conclu­  
sions we uld grow tiom them, that the general  
government may placeany act they think proper  
on the list ol crimes and punish it themselves,  
whet her enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himsell be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be  
the evidence, bis order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants ol these stales,  
being by these precedent- reduced as outlaws lo  
the absolute dominion of one ran, and the bar­  
rieis ol the constitution thus swept from us all.  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power ol a majority ol Congress to protect  
limn a like expot lalion or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of thesame body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. giveinnis and counselors of the  
si.in s. nor Ihi ir other peaceable inhabitants who  
mav venturi* to reclaim the constitutional rigliis  
ami libelties ol the stales and people, or who lor  
other causes, good or bad. may lie obnoxious to  
the views, or malked by the suspicions ol the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to ins or  
their eh cl ion or other interest, public nr person­

(he safest su* j&#x27;-t-l of a first experiment, lint the  
citizen will soon follow, nr lather has already  
Inllownl; for, already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these mid successive nets  
nl l he same character, uiibss arrest eil at I he thres­  
hold may lend to drive these stales into revolu­  
tion and&#x27;ldcod, and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretexts  
tor those who wish it to be believed that, man  
cannot be governed but by a rod ol iron; iliat it  
w ould lie a d.uigei mis delusion‘w ere a confidence  
in the men ol onr choice lo silence our tears for  
the safety ol onr rights; that confidence is every­  
where tin* parent ol despotism; tree government  
is (minded in jealousy and mil in confidence; it is  
jealousy and hot confidence which prescribes  
limiled constitutions lo bind down those whom  
we an* obliged to 11 iisi with power, that onr con­  
st it nt ion has fixed I lie limit&#x27; to which, and no fnr­  
iher onr confidence may go: and let ihe honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say it I lie constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits lo the government it ere tied, an I  
whether we should be wise in destroying those  
limits? Let him soy what Ihe government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men ol onr choice  
have con I erred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident ol our choice has assented to and accepted  
over Ihe friendly strangers. In whom the mild  
spirit of onr country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality aiid.pt election; that the men ol onr  
choice have more respected the barn suspicions ol  
tfie President than tile solid rights ol innocence,  
I in- claims ol justification. Ihe sacred force ol  
truth, and the tin m and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In questions nl power then, let no more be  
heard of confidence ill man. but bind him down  
lioin niischiel by the chains of ihe constitution  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
ils co-slates lor an expression of their sentiments  
on l he acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
ol certain crimes hercinbelore specified, plainly  
declaring w hether these are or are not authorized  
by ihe federal compact. And itdonbts not that  
their sense will be so announced as lo prove their  
attachment unaltered lo limiled goverauient,  
whether general nr particular, and that the rights  
and libcrih s of their co stales will be exposed to  
iTo dangers by n maining etlibai hi d on a common  
Imtic m with Their own. lint they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount loan undisguised declaration that the  
compact is nut meant lo lie the measure of the  
power ot Ihe general government, lint that it will  
piocei d in the exercise over these slates of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view Ihis as­

them in the hands of the general government,  
w ith I lie power assumed to bind Ihe slates, not  
mere) v in cases made Federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever.by laws made not with their consent,  
hut by others against their consent; that this  
would be lo surrender tin* form ol government  
we have chosen, md living under one deriving  
ils power from i‘f own will, and not from onrau-  
Ihorily; and that Ihe co stales reemring lo their  
natural rights i.i cases not made Federal will con  
car in declaring these void and ot no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in ro  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con

wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to the United Stales, nor prohibi­

special provision inserted in the constitution.  
Iron) abundant caution has declared that &quot;the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
I ol the stales now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject ol the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibititig their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would he nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is, therefore, con­

part otthem to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue ol the instrument. That the proceeding  
ol the general government under color of those  
articles will be a fit and necessary subject for re­  
vise! and correction at a time ol great tranquili­  
ty. while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call lor immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the senators and representatives  
in Congress trom the commonwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the same to their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session ol&#x27; congress a repeal of the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures of the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
(hose specified in their late federal compact, to  
be Iriendly to the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of all the Slates-Uial falthlul to that com­  
pact. according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood ami acceded to by  
tile several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of self gov­  
ernment. and transfer them to a general and con­  
solidated government, without regard to the  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not lor the peace,  
happiness and prosperity of these stales. And  
that, therefore. Ihiscommonwe. Ith is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-states are, to submit to un­  
delegaled and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body of men, on earth; that if the  
nets before specified should aland, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place any act they think proper  
on the list ol crimes and punish it themselves,  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by (hem. that Ihey may  
transfer ils cognizance lo the President or any  
other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
conm-el. judge and jury, whose suspicions may be  
the evidence, his order Ihe sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
Ihe transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants of these slates,  
being by these precedent- reduced as outlaws lo  
the absolute dominion of one m .n, and the bar­  
rieisol the constitution thus swept from ns all.  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the power of a majority ol Congress to protect  
trom a like expoi latioq or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of tliesame body, tlie legisla­  
tures, judges. givetnors and counselors of the  
stales, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture lo reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties ol the stales and people, or who for  
ol her causes, good or bad. may be obnoxious lo  
the views, or marked by the suspicions ol the  
President, or to lie thought dangerous to liis or  
their election or other interest, public nr person­  
al: that the friendless alien has been selected as  
the safest subject of a first experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
billowed; for, already basa sedition act marked  
him as its prey. Thai these and successive acts  
ol the same character, inib&#x27;ss arrested tit the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these slab&#x27;s into revolu­  
tion and blood,and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretexts  
(or those who wish it to lie believed that man  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would lie a dangerous delusion were a confidence  
in the men ol onr choice to silence our tears for  
the safely ol onr rights; that confidence is every­  
where the parent ol despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to trust with power, that our con­  
stitution has fixed the limits to which,and no fur­  
ther onr confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say it the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits (n the government it ere.,led. an I  
whether wo should be wise in destroying those  
limits? Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of onr choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident ol our choice has assented to and accepted  
over the Iriendly strangers, to whom the mild  
spirit of onr country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men of our  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights of innocence,  
the claims of justification, the sacred force ol  
truth, and the form and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In qii&#x27;Stions ol power, then, let no more lie  
heard ol confidence in man. but bind him down  
trom mischiel by tlie chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
ils co-states for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, ami for punishment  
ol certain crimes liereinbeloro specified, plainly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the Pedum I compact. And it doubts not that  
lln ir sense will be so announced as lo prove their  
attachment unaltered lo limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the rights  
and libertiesof their co-stales will la; exposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. lint they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount lo an undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meant to tie the measure of the  
power of the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the stales and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to bind the states, not  
merely in cases made Federal, lint in all cases  
whatsoever.by laws made not with their consent,  
but by others against their consent; that this  
would be lo surrender the form ol government  
we have chosen, md living under one deriving  
ils power from i‘f own will, and not from onr au­  
thority; and that the co-states recurring lo their  
natural rights i.i cases not made Federal will con  
enr in declaring these void and of no force, and  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re  
questing their repeal at the next session of Con  
grets

e Act of Congress, passed on  
the 14lh day ol July, 1798, and entitled “an act  
in addition to an act entitled an act lor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United Sla­  
tes;” as also (he act passed by them on Ihe 27th  
ol June, 1798, “entitled an act to punish frauds  
I committed on the bank ol the United Slates&quot; (and  
all their other acts which assumes to create, de­  
due or punish crimes ol her Ih.&gt;n those rnumcra  
ted in the constitution.) are altogether void and  
of no force, and that the power to create, define  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
stales, each within its own territory.  
Resolved, That it is line, as a general princi­  
| pie, and is also expressly declared by one of Ihe  
I amendments to the constitution, that the “powers  
not delegated to the United Stales by the consti­  
tution. nor prohibited by it to the stales, are re­  
served to Ihe slates respectively. or to Ihe peo­  
ple;” and that no power over the freedom ol re­  
ligion. freedom of speech, or freedom ol the press  
being delegated lo the United Slates by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the stales, all  
lawful powers respecting Ihe same did of right  
! remain, and were reserved lo the states or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves Ihe right of judging  
how far the licentiousness of speech and of the  
press miy be abridged without lessening their  
nseliil freedom;and how far those abuses w hich can  
not be separated from their use should he tolera  
ted rather than Ihe use be destroyed and thus also  
they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
States, of Ihe Iteedom of religions opinions and  
exercises, ard retained lo themselves the right of  
protecting the same, as this stale, by a law passed  
on ihe general demand ol its citizens, had already  
protected them Irom all human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made by one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the freedom of speech or of the press.” thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of Ihe press. Insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down Ihe sanctuary which rov­  
ers the others, and that libels, lalsehoods and def­  
amation, equally with heresy and false religion,  
are witheht from the cognizance of Federal tribu­  
nals. That therefore Ihe net ol the congress  
of the United States, passed on the 141li of July,  
1798, entitled -‘an act in addition lo the act enti­  
tled ,n act lor the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United Stales,” which does abridge  
the freedom of Ihe press is not law, bnl is alto­  
gether voiil and ol no force.  
Resolved, That alien friends are under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws ol Ihe slates  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated lo the United Stales, nor prohibi­  
ted lo individual stales distinct Irom Iheir power  
over citizens, and it being true as a general prin­  
ciple,and one ol the amendments lo the constiln­  
tion having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to Ihe United States are reserved lo  
the stales respectively, or lo the people.” the act  
of the congress of the United States, passed Ihe  
22nd day ol July. 1798, assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple asW&#x27;-ll as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution,  
Irom abundant caution has declared that “the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
ol the states now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to Ihe year 1808;” that (his commonwealth  
does admit Ihe migration of alien friends describ­  
ed ns the subject ol the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision agiinst prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent lo the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is, therefore, con­  
trary lo the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
Resolved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order ol  
the President, to depart out ol the United Slates,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled “an net  
concerning aliens” is contrary to the constitu  
tion. one amendment to which has provided that­  
no person shall be deprived ol liberty without due  
process of law,” anil that another having provi­  
ded, “that in all criminal prosecutions Hie accus­  
ed sh ill enjoy the right to public trinl by an im­  
partial jury, to be informed of the nature and  
cause of the accusation, to be conlronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel lor his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize ihe Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection of Ihe law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation ol the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary lo these provisions also ol the constitu­  
tion, and is, thcreloro, not » law, lint utterly  
void, and of no force. The transferring the power  
ot judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of Ihe laws, Irom Ihe courts lo the President  
ol the United States as is undertaken by Ihe same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that “thejudicial  
power of the United Stales shall he vested in  
courts, the judges ol which shall bold their offices  
daring good behavior,” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, ami it is further lo be noted  
that this transfer of Judiciary power is lo that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers.  
Resolved. That the construction applied by th

ted to individual stales distinct Iroin their power  
over citizens, and it being true as » general prin­  
ciple,and one ol the amendments to (he constitu­  
tion having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
the stales respectively, or to the people,” the act  
of the congress of the United Stales, passed the  
22nd day ol July. 1798, assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple asw&#x27;dl as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution,  
from abundant caution lias declared that “the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
ol the stales now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not he prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien li lends describ­  
ed as tlie subject ol Ihe said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision agiinst prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would he nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. I here!ore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
Rrsolved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order ol  
tin; President, to depart out ol the United States,  
as is undertaken try the said act entitled &quot;an act  
concerning aliens” is contrary lo the constitu­  
tion, one amendment to which has provided that  
no person shall lie deprived of liberty without clue  
process of law,” and that another having provi­  
ded. “that in ail criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right to public trial by an im­  
partial jury, to he informed of the nature and  
cause of the accusation, to he conlronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess lor obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel lor his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection ol the law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without commutation ol the  
witnesses against him, w ithout hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also ol (he constitu­  
tion, and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and ol’ no lorce. The transferring the power  
ol judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of the laws, from the courts to the President  
of the United States as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that “thejudicial  
power of the United Stales shall he vested ip  
courts, the judges ol which shall bold their offices  
during good behavior,” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, and it is further lo he noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is lo that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers.

pressly declares, l hat congress shall make no law

Resolved. That it is true, as a general princi­

served lo the states respectively. or to the peo­  
ple*,” therefore, the Act of Congress, passed on  
the 14lh day of July, 171)8, and entitled &quot;an act  
in addition to an act entitled an act lor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United Sla­

ol June, 1798, “entitled an act to punish frauds  
I committed on the bank ol the United States” (and  
all their other acts which assumes lo create, de­  
fine or punish crimes other than those enumera

ol no force, and that the power lo create, define  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and ol  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
slates, each within its owu territory.  
Resolved, That it is true, as a general princi-

being delegated to the United Stales by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the stales, all  
lawful powers respecting the same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the states or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves the right of judging  
how far the licentiousness of speech and of the  
press mly be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom;atid how farthosc abuses which can  
not be separated from their use should be tolera  
ted rather than the use be destroyed and thus also  
they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
Slates, ol the freedom of religious opinions and  
exercises, ai d retained to themselves the right ol  
protecting the same, as this state, by a law passed  
on the general demand of its citizens, had already  
protected them from all human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made by one ol  
the amendments lo the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging

1798, entitled “an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled an act for the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United States,” which does abridge  
the freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
gether void and ol no force.  
Resolved, That alien friends are under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the law s ol the stales  
wherein they are; I bat no power over them has  
been delegated lo the United Stales, nor prohibi­  
ted to individual stales distinct from their powet

ciple, and one ol the amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
the states respectively, or In the people,” the act  
of the congress of the United Slates, passed the  
22nd day ol July, 1798, assumes pow er over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple asw -11 as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision insetted in the constitution,  
from abundant caution has declared that -the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
ol the states now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not lie prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year I8D8;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien Iricnds describ­  
ed as the snlj&#x27;-et of the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision agiinst prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would lie nugatory; that to remove  
them w hen migrated is equivalent lo the prohi­  
bition of lle-ir migration, ind is, therefore, con­  
trary to the siid provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
R solved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection id&#x27; the laws of this common­  
wealth on his lailtire to obey the simple order ol  
the President, to depart out ol the United States,  
as is undert ikon by the said act entitled “an act  
concerning aliens” is contrary lo the constitu­  
tion, o.te amendment lo which has provided that  
no person shall be deprived ol liberty without due  
process ol law,” and th.it another having provi­  
ded, “that in all criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right to public trial by an im­  
partial jury, to be informed of Ihe nature and  
cause of the accusation, to be con I routed with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel for his defence.”  
the same act undertaking to authorize (he Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United States  
who is under Ihe protection of ihe law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation ol the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to those provisions also ol the constitu­  
tion, and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no force. The transferring the power  
ol judging any person who is under the protec  
lion of Ihe laws, from the courts lo the President  
ol the United States as is undertaken hy the same  
act concerning aliens, is against tbit article ol  
the constitution which provides that “thejudicial  
power of the United States shall he vested in

States, which delegate to congress the power to  
levy and collect taxes, duties, impost, excises; to  
pay Che debts and provide for Ihe common defence  
and general welfare of the United States, and to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and prop­  
er for carrying into execution Ihe powers vested  
by the constitution in the government of (he U.  
States, or in any department or officer (hereof,  
goes to Ihe destruction of all limitsprescribed to  
their power by the constitution —that words  
meant by Ihe instrument to bo subsidiary only to  
the execution of limited powers, ought not to be  
  
So construed ns to give unlimited powers, nor a  
part Ol thetn to be taken, as to destroy the whole  
residue ol the instrument. That the proceeding  
ol the general government under color ol those  
articles will be a fit and necessary subject for re­  
visal and correction at a time of great tranquil!-  
ty, while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted lo the senators and representatives  
in Congress trom the commonwealth, who are en­  
joined lo present the same to their respective  
houses, and lo use their best cudcavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal of the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts.  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed lo communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures of the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, und particularly for  
those specified in their lute federal compact to  
bo friendly to the peace, happiness, and prosper­  
ity of all the Slates—that taitblul lo that com­  
pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and uctedid to by  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe, that to  
take from the states all the powers of self gov­  
ernment. und transfer them lo a general and con­  
solidated government, without regard lo th 6  
special delegations and reseivations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not lor the peace  
happiness and prosperity of these states. And  
that, therefore, thiscommonwei llh is determined,  
as it doubts not it co-stales are, lo submit to un­  
dclegaled and consequently to unlimited power?  
in no man. or body ol men, on earth; that ff ifia  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow ftom them, that the general  
government may place any act they think proper  
on the list ol crimes and punish it themselves,  
w hether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that (hey may  
transfer its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himsell he the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whoso suspicions may be  
the evidence, bis order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous und valu­  
able description of Ihe inhabitants of these states,  
being by these precedents reduced us outlaws lo  
the absolute dominion of one mi.n, and the bar­  
riers ot the constitution (bus swept from us all,  
no rampart now remains against the passions and  
the pow er of a majority ol Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish­  
ment the minority of the same body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. givemors and counselors of the  
slates, nor their other peaceable inhabitants w ho  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties ol the slates and people, or who for  
other causes, good or had. may be obnoxious to  
Ihe views, or marked by the suspicions ol the  
President, or to be thought dangerous to his or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has been selected ns  
the safest subject of a Itsl experiment, but the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
followed; for, already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
ol the same character, unl-ss arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these slates into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretexts  
for those who wish it to lie believed that man  
cannot he governed hut by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a d.mgeious delusion wore a confidence  
in the men of our choice lo silence our fears (or  
the safely of our rights; that confidence isevery­  
where llie parent ol despotism; Irce government  
is (ounded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we are obliged to trust with power, that our con  
stilutiou lias fixed the limits to which,and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate ot confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say it the constitution has not been w ise  
in fixing limits to the government it created, und  
whether we should be wise in destroying those  
limits? Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice  
have conferred upon the President, and the Pres­  
ident ol our choice has assented to and accepted  
over the friendly strangers, lo whom the mild  
spirit of our country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men ot our  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights ol innocence,  
Ihe claims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the term and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In qu&#x27; stious ol power, then, let no more he  
heard ol confidence in man, but hind him down  
from miscliiel by the chains of the constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore call on  
its co-st.lies for an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
of certain crimes hereinhelore specified, plainly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the Federal compact. And it doubts not that  
their sense will be so announc&#x27;d as lo prove their  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and that the right*  
and liberties ol their co stales will l.e exposed lo  
no dangers bv re maining embarked &lt; n a common  
bottom with their own. Pul they will concur with  
tliis commonwealth in considering the said acts  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount loan undisguised declaration that the  
ci mpuct is not meant to tie the measure ol the  
power of the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states ot ill)  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing Ihe rights ol the stales and consolidating  
them in llie hands of the general government,  
with Ihe power assumed lo bind the slates, not  
merely in cases made Federal, ini in ail case*  
whatsoever,by laws made not with (heirconsent,  
Imt by others against (heir consent; that this  
would be to surrender (lie form of government  
we have chosen, and living under one deriving  
its power from i*s own will, and uot (rent our au­  
thority; and that the co stales recalling to their  
natural rights in cases not made Ftdernl willcon­  
cur in declaring those void and of no force, aid  
will each unite with this commonwealth in re­  
questing (heir repeal at the next stssicn of Con­

sh treason, lor counterfeiting the securities  
and current coin ol the United States, piracies  
and fcloniescommilted on the high seas, and of­  
fenses against the law ol nations, and no other  
crime whatsoever, and it being true, as a general  
principle, and one of the amendments 1,0 the con­  
stitution having also declared &quot;that the powers  
not delegated to the United States by the consti­  
tution. nor prohibited by it to the states, are re­  
served to the stales respectively, or to the i e,o­  
ple,” therefore, the Act of Congress, passed op  
the Mill day of July, 1798, and entitled “an act  
in addition to an act entitled an act lor the pun­  
ishment of certain crimes against the United Sta­  
tes;” as also the act passed by them on the 27th  
ol June, 171)8, “entitled an act to punish frauds  
committed on the bank ol the United States&quot; (and  
all their other acts which assumes to create, de­  
que or punish crimes other than those enumera  
icd in the constitution,) are altogether void and  
of no force, and that the power to create, define  
and punish such other crimes is reserved, and of  
right appertains solely and exclusively to the  
slates, each within ils own territory.  
Resolved, That it is true, as a general princi­  
ple, and is also expressly declared by one of the  
amendments to the constitution, that the “powers  
not delegated to the United States by the consti­  
tution, nor prohibited by it to the states, arc re­  
served to the states respectively, or to the peo­  
ple;” and that uo power over the freedom of re­  
ligion, freedom of speech, or freedom ol the press  
being delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, all  
lawful powers respecting llie same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the states or the  
people; that lints was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves the right of judging  
how far the licentiousness of speech and of the  
press may be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom :and how far those abuses which can  
not be separated from their use should be tolcra  
tod rather than the use be destroyed and llms also  
they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
States, ol the freedom of religious opinions and  
exercises, urd retained to themselves the right ol  
protecting the same, as this state, by a law passed  
on the general demand of ils citizens, laid already  
protected them from all human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition lo this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made by one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the freedom of speech or of the press.” thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down the sanctuary w hich cov­  
ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and def­  
amation. equally witii heresy and false religion,  
are witheld from the cognizance of Federal tribu­  
nals. That therefore the act ol the congress  
of the United States, passed on the I4lh of July,  
1798, entitled “an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled an act for the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United Slates,” which does abridge  
the freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
gether void and «( no force.  
Resolved, That alien friends are.under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws of the slates  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to the United Stales, nor prohibi­  
ted to individual states distinct from their power  
over citizens, and it being true as a general prin­  
ciple,and one of the amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the,United States are reserved lo  
the stales respectively, or lo the people,” ihe act  
of the congress of the United Slates, passed the  
22nd day ot Jqly. 1798. assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is nut law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved. That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as well as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution,  
from abundant caution has declared that “the  
migration or importation of such persons ns any  
ol the states now existing shall think proper lo  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject of the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is, therefore, con­  
trary to the said provision of the constitution,  
and void.  
Resolved. That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on )iis failure to obey the simple order of  
tbe Uresident, to depart out ot the United Stales,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled “an act  
concerning aliens” is contrary lo the constitu­  
tion, one amendment to which has provided that  
no parson shall be deprived of liberty without duo  
process of law,” and that another having provi­  
ded. “ihat in nil criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right to public trial try an im­  
partial jury, to bo informed of the nature and  
cause of the accusation, to be controlled .with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining w itnesses in his favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel tor his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize the Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United States  
who is under the protection of the law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of tbe  
witnesses against him, w ithout hearing witnesses  
in his favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to those provisions also of the constitu­  
tion, and is, therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no force. The transferring the power  
of judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of tlie laws, (roni the courts to the President  
of the United Slates us is undertake!] by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
tlie constitution which provides that “the judicial  
power of the United Stales shall be vested in  
courts, the judges ol which shall hold their ollices  
during good behavior,” and the said act is void  
for that reason also, and it is further to be noted  
that tiiis transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all I lie executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers.

served to the states respectively, or to the peo­  
ple;” and that no power over the freedom of re­  
ligion. freedom of (speech, or freedom ol the press  
being delegated to the United States by the con­  
stitution, nor prohibited by it to the slates, all  
lawful powers respecting the same did of right  
remain, and were reserved to the states or the  
people; that thus was manifested their determina­  
tion to retain to themselves the right of judging  
how far the licentiousness of speech and of the  
press may be abridged without lessening their  
useful freedom; ind how farthosc abuses which can  
not be separated from their use should be lolera  
ted rather than tin use be destroyed and thus also  
they guarded against all abridgment, by the U.  
States, ol the freedom of religious opinions and  
exercises, ard retained to themselves the right ol  
i protecting the same, as this state, by a litw passed  
on the general demand of its citizens, had already  
protected them (rom all human restraint or inter­  
ference; and that, in addition to this general  
principle and express declaration, another and  
more special provision has been made by one ol  
the amendments to the constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, that congress shall make no law  
respecting an establishment of religion, or pro­  
hibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging  
the freedom of speech or of the press.” thereby  
guarding in the same sentence, and under the  
same words, the freedom of religion, of speech,  
and of the press, insomuch, that whatever viola­  
ted either, throws down the sanctuary which cov­  
ers the others, and that libels, falsehoods and def­  
amation. equally with heresy and false religion,  
are witbeld from the cognizance of Federal tribu­  
nals. That therefore the act ol the congress  
ol the United States, passed on the I4lh of July.  
1798, entitled “an act in addition to the act enti­  
tled an act for the punishment of certain crimes  
against the United Slates,” which docs abridge  
the freedom of the press is not law, but is alto­  
gether void and of no force.  
Resolved, That alien friends are under the ju­  
risdiction and protection of the laws ol the states  
wherein they are; that no power over them has  
been delegated to the United States, nor prohibi­  
ted to individual states distinct Irotn their power  
over citizens, and it being true as a general prin­  
ciple, ami one of the amendments to the constitu­  
tion having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the United States are reserved to  
the stales respectively, or to the people,” Ibe act  
of the congress of the United States, passed the  
22nd day ot July. 1798, assumes power over aliens  
not delegated to the constitution, is not law, but  
is altogether void and of no force.  
Resolved, That in addition to the general prin­  
ciple as well as the express declaration, that pow­  
ers not delegated are reserved, another and more  
special provision inserted in the constitution,  
Iroin abundant caution has declared that “the  
migration or importation of such persons as any  
ill the states now existing shall think proper to  
admit shall not be prohibited by the congress pri­  
or to the year 1808;” that this commonwealth  
does admit the migration of alien friends describ­  
ed as the subject ot the said act concerning aliens;  
that a provision against prohibiting their migra­  
tion is a provision against all acts equivalent  
thereto, or it would be nugatory; that to remove  
them when migrated is equivalent to the prohi­  
bition of their migration, and is. therefore, con­  
trary to tbe said provision of tbe constitution,  
and void.  
R- solved, That the imprisonment of a person  
under the protection of the laws of this common­  
wealth on his failure to obey the simple order ol  
the President, to depart out ol the United States,  
as is undertaken by the said act entitled “an act  
concerning aliens” Is contrary to the constitu­  
tion, one amendment to which has provided that  
no person shall lie deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” and that another having provi­  
ded, “that in all criminal prosecutions the accus­  
ed shall enjoy the right to public trial by an im­  
partial jury, to be informed of the nature and  
cause ot the accusation, to be confronted with the  
witnesses against him, to have compulsory pro­  
cess for obtaining witnesses in bis favor, and to  
have the assistance of counsel lor his defence,”  
the same act undertaking to authorize (be Presi­  
dent to remove a person out of the United Stales  
who is under the protection of the law, on his  
own suspicion, without accusation, without jury,  
without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without bearing witnesses  
in liis favor, without defense, without counsel, is  
contrary to these provisions also of the constitu­  
tion, and is. therefore, not a law, but utterly  
void, and of no force. The transferring the power  
ot judging any person who is under the protec­  
tion of the laws, (rom the courts to the President  
of the United Slates as is undertaken by the same  
act concerning aliens, is against the article of  
the constitution which provides that “the judicial  
power of the United States shall be vested in  
courts, the judges ol which shall bold their offices  
during good behavior,” and the said act is void  
lor that reason also, and it is further to he noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that  
magistrate of the general government who al­  
ready possesses all the executive, and negative  
on all legislative powers.

misconstrued,) so ns to destroy the general gov­  
ernment (as evinced by sundry of their proceed­  
ings) to those parts oftho constitution of the U.  
States, which delegate to congress tbe power to  
levy and collectotaxes, duties, impost, excises; to  
pay the debts and provide for the common defence  
and general welfare of Ibe United States, and to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and prop­  
er for carrying into execution Ibe powers vested  
by the constitution in the government of the U.  
States, or in nny department or officer thereof,  
goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to  
their power by the constitution—that words  
meant by the instrument to be subsidiary only to  
the execution of limited powers, ought not to be  
  
bo construed ns to give unlimited powers norn  
part of them to be taken, as to destroy the’wbolo  
residue ol tbe instrumcut. Tbnt the proceeding  
ol the general government undercolor of thow  
articles will be o lit and necessary subject for re­  
visal and correction at a time of greet tranquili­  
ty, while those specified in the preceding resolu­  
tions call for immediate redress.  
Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be  
transmitted to the senators and representatives  
in Congress from tbe commonwealth, who are en­  
joined to present the same tc their respective  
houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure  
at the next session of congress a repeal of the  
aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts  
Resolved, lastly, That the Governor of this  
commonwealth be, and is authorized and request­  
ed to communicate the preceding resolutions to  
the legislatures of the several states, to assure  
them that this commonwealth considers union for  
specified national purposes, and particularly for  
those specified in their late federal compact to  
be friendly to the peace, happiness, and pros’ner­  
ity of all the States—that lailhlul to that com  
pact, according to the plain intent and meaning  
in which it was understood and acceded to bv  
the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its  
preservation; that it does also believe that to  
take from the states all the powers of sell gov­  
ernment. and transfer them to a general and con  
solidnled government, without regard to tbe  
special delegations and reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that compact, is not (or the peace  
happiness and prosperity ol these states. And  
that, therefore, thiscommonwci llh is determined  
as it doubts not it co-slates are, to submit to un­  
delegated and consequently to unlimited powers  
in no man. or body ol men, on earth; that if the  
acts before specified should stand, these conclu­  
sions would grow from them, that the general  
government may place any act (hey think proper  
on the list ot crimes and punish it themselves .  
whether enumerated or not enumerated by the  
constitution cognizable by them, that they mav  
trimeter its cognizance to the President or any  
other person, who may himself be the accuser,  
counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be  
the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer  
the executioner, and his breast the sole record of  
the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­  
able description of the inhabitants of these states,  
being by these precedents reduced as outlaws to  
the absolute dominion of one man, and the bar­  
riers of the constitution thus swept from us all,  
no rampart now remains against the passions ami  
the power of a majority ol Congress to protect  
from a like exportation or other grievous punish  
ment the minority of the same body, the legisla­  
tures, judges. givcmors and counselors of the  
states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who  
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights  
and liberties of the states nnd people, or who for  
other causes, good or bad, may be obnoxious to  
the views, or marked by the suspicions of the  
President, or to lie thought dangerous to bis or  
their election or other interest, public or person­  
al; that the friendless alien has been selected os  
the safest subject of a first experiment, hut the  
citizen will soon follow, or rather has already  
followed; for, already has a sedition act marked  
him as its prey. That these and successive acts  
ol the same character, unless arrested at the thres­  
hold may tend to drive these states into revolu­  
tion and blood, and will furnish new calumnies  
against republican government, and new pretexts  
tor those who wish it to be believed that man  
cannot be governed but by a rod of iron; that it  
would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence  
in the men ol our choice to silence our fears for  
the safely of our rights; that confidence Isevery­  
where the parent ol despotism; free government  
is founded in jealousy ami not in confidence; it is  
jealousy and not confidence which prescribes  
limited constitutions to bind down those whom  
we arc obliged to trust with power, that our con  
stilution has fixed the limits to which,and no fur­  
ther our confidence may go; and let the honest  
advocate ol confidence read the alien and sedition  
acts, and say it the constitution has not been wise  
in fixing limits to the government it created, and  
whether we should be wise in destroying (hose  
limits? Let him say what the government is, if  
it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice  
have conferred upon the President, nnd the Pres­  
ident of our choice has assented to nnd accepted  
over the friendly strangers, to whom tbe mild  
spirit ol our country and its laws have pledged  
hospitality and protection; that the men ol our  
choice have more respected the bare suspicions of  
the President than the solid rights of innocence,  
the claims of justification, the sacred force of  
truth, and the lorm and substance of law and jus­  
tice. In questions ol power, then, let no more be  
heard of confidence in man. but bind him down  
from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.  
That this commonwealth does therefore rail on  
its co-states lor an expression of their sentiments  
on the acts concerning aliens, and for punishment  
ol certain crimes hereinbelore specified, plainly  
declaring whether these are or are not authorized  
by the Federal compact. And it doubts not that  
their sense will be so announced as to prove (heir  
attachment unaltered to limited government,  
whether general or particular, and (bat the rights  
and liberties of their co-stales will beexposed to  
no dangers by remaining embarked on a common  
bottom with their own. But they will concur with  
this commonwealth in considering tbe said ads  
as so palpable against the constitution as to  
amount to au undisguised declaration that the  
compact is not meant to be the measure of the  
power of the general government, but that it will  
proceed in the exercise over these states of all  
powers whatsoever. That they will view this as  
seizing the rights of the states and consolidating  
them in the hands of the general government,  
with the power assumed to hind the slates, not  
merely in cases made Federal, but in all cases  
whatsoever, by taws made not with their consent,  
but by others ngninst their consent; that this  
would be to surrender the form ot government  
wo have chosen, and living under one deriving  
its power from its own will, and not Irons our au­  
thority; and that the co-states recurring to their  
natural rights in cases not made Federal will con­  
cur in declaring these’void nnd of no force, and  
will each unite [with this commonwealth in re­  
questing their repeal at tbe.next session of Con

having delegated to Congress a power to punish treas -n,  
counterfeiting the securities and current coin of tlie Uni­

•ng also declared ‘ • that the powers not delegated to tit*  
United etatr* hy the constitution, nor prohit.ite 1 by it to  
the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or t..

I4th day of .Inly, 179 b, and entitled &quot;an act in addition to  
the act entitled an act for the punishment of certain  
crimes against the United St it« s a* also the act passed

(and all of theiU other acts which assnietoineate.de.

that the js.wer to create, define, and punish sncli othei  
crime* is reserved, and of right app. rt tins solely and ex­  
ilttsively to the Stales, each within its own territory.  
3. Resolves, That it is true, as a general principle,  
and is ilso expressly declared hy one of the amendments  
to the constitution, that the power* not delegated to the  
United Slates hy the coustituti m. nor pr ihihited hy it to

DELEGATED TO THE UNITED STATES RV THE COXSTITITION, Ilor  
prohibited hy it to the State*, all lawful power* respect­

the States or the fe ipu ; that thus was manifested their  
i determination to retain to themselves the right of judg­  
ing how far the licentiousness of speech and of the press  
may be abridged without lessening their useful freedom :  
and how far those abuses which cannot he separated from  
their n*e should lie tolerated rather than the use be de­  
stroyed and thus also they guarded against all abridge­

right of protecting the same, its this State, hy a law  
passed on the general demand of its citizens, had already  
protected them from all human restraint or interference ;  
and that, in addition to this general principle and express  
declaration, another and more special provision h is been  
made hy one of tit.* amendments to the constitution,  
which expressly declares, that “Congress shall make no  
law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit­  
ing the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of  
speech or of the press,” thereby guarding in the same  
sentence, and rml.T the same Words, tue freedom of re­  
ligion, of speech and of the press, insomuch, that what­  
ever violated either, throws down the sanctuary which  
cover* the others, and that libels, falsehood and defama­

from the Cognizance of Federal tribunals That there­

the act entitled an act for the punishment of certain  
Crimes against the United Stales,” which does abridge  
the freedom of the press is not law, but is altogether  
void ami of no force.  
4. Resolved, That alien friends are under the jurisdic­  
tion and protection of the laws of the State wherein they  
are; that no power over them lias been delegated to the  
United States, nor prohibited to individual States distinct  
from their power over citizens, and it being true, as a  
general prin iple, and one of tlie amendments to the  
constitution having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the United Slates are reserved to the Slates  
respectively, or to the people,” the act of the Congress ol  
the United States, passed the 22d day of July, 17’JS, as­  
sumes power over aliens not delegated to the constitution,  
is not law. but is altogether void and of no force.  
5. Resolved, That in addition to the general principle  
as well os the express ileclaratlon. that powers not dele­  
gated are reserved, another and more special provision  
inserted in the constitution, from abundant caution. Ices  
declared that “the migration or importation of such per­  
sons as any of the States now cxistiinj shall think proper  
to admit sha&#x27;l not be nroluhited by the Congress prior to  
tlie year ISOS ;” that this commonwealth does admit the  
migration of alien friends described as the subject of the  
said act concerning aliens ; that a ((revision against pro­  
hibiting their migration is a provision against all acts  
equivalent to the prohibition of their migration, and is,  
therefore, contrary to the said provision of the constitu­  
tion, and void. *  
6. Resolved, That the imprisonment of a person under  
the protection ol the laws of this commonwealth on his  
failure to obey the simple order of the president, to de­  
part out ot the United States, as is undertaken by the said  
art entitled “an act concerning aliens.” is contrary to  
I lie constitution, one amendment to which has provided  
that “ no person shall be deprive*! of liberty without due  
process of law.” and that another having provided, “that  
in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the  
right to public trial by an impartial jury, to he informed  
of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted  
with the witnesses against him. t « have compnlsorV pro.  
cess for obtaining w itnesses in Ins favor, and to have the  
assistance of counsel for his defence,” the same act un­  
dertaking to authorise the president to remove a person  
out of the United States w ho is under the protection of the  
law, on his own suspicion, without accusation, without  
jury, without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him. without hearing witnesses in his  
favor, with mt defence. without counsel, is contrary to  
these provisions, also of the constitution, and is. therefore,  
mU a law, but utterly v .id, and ot no force. The trans­  
ferring the power of judging any person who is under the  
protection of the laws, from the courts ot the president o.  
the United Mates, as is undertaken by tlie same act con­  
cerning aliens, is against the article* of tli*» constitution  
which provides that the judicial powei of the United  
States shall be vested in courts, the judges of which shall  
hold their offices during good behavior.” and tne slid act  
is void for that reason also, and &#x27;I is further to he noted  
that this transfer of judiciary power is to that magistrate  
of the general government who already possesses all the  
executive, and negative on all legislative powers.

are; that no power over them has been delegated to the  
United States, nor prohibited to individual States distinct  
from their power over citizens, and it being true, as a  
general prin iple, and one of the smeudments to the  
constitution having also declared that “the powers not  
delegated to the United Slates are resewed to the States  
reco-twely, or to the people,” the act of the Congress oi  
the United States, passed the J«d day of July, 1798, as-

niigiirtlon of alien friend* described as the subject of the  
said act concerning alien* : that a provision against pro­  
hibiting their migration is a provision against all acts  
equivalent to tho prohibition of their migration, and is,  
therefore, contrary to the said provision of the constitu­

0. Resolved, That tho imprisonment of a person under  
the protection ot the laws of this Commonwealth on his  
failure to obey the simple order of the president, to de­  
part out of the United States, as is undertaken hy the said  
act entitled “an act coiueening aliens.&quot; is contrary to  
tin* constitution, one amendment to which has provided  
that * ’ no person shall bo deprived of liberty without due  
process of law,” ami that .another having provided, “that  
in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the  
right to public trial hy an impartial jury, to he informed  
of the nature and cause of the accusation, to he confronted  
with the witnesses against him. to have compulsory pro­

assistance of counsel for his defence,&quot; tho same act un­

out of the United States who is under the protection of tile  
law, on his own su-picion, without accusation, without  
jury, without public trial, without confrontation of the  
witnesses against him, without hearing witnesses in hi*  
favor, with ait defence, without counsel, is contrary to  
1 these provisions, also of the constitution.and is. therefore,

ceeding-*&#x27;to those par&#x27;s of the constitution of the United  
M ites, which delegated to Congress a power to lay and  
collect taxes, duties, imposts, excises; to pay the’debts

of the United Stales, and to make all laws which shall be  
necessary and proper for carrying into execution the  
poc er* vested hy the constitution in the government ot  
the United States, or ir. any department or officer thereof,  
goes to tlie destruction of all limits prescribed to their  
power by the constitution—that words meant by the in­  
stillment to be subsidiary only to the execution of limited  
powers, ought not to be so construed as themselves to  
give unlimited powers, nor a part of them to be taken, as  
to destroy the whole residue of the instrument. That

those articles wilt be a til and necessary subject for revi&amp;al  
ami correction ot a time of greater tranquility, while

States, to assure them that this commonwealth considers  
union for specified national purposes, and panicuinrlv for  
those specified in their late federal compact, to be friendly  
to tile peace, happiness, and prosperity of all the Mates—  
that taithful to that comp ict. according to the plain intent  
and meaning in which it was understood and acceded to  
by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for its pre­  
servation : that it doc* also l-elieve, that to take from the  
Mates all the powers of self-government, and transfer them  
to a general ami consolidated government, without re­  
gard to the special delegate ns amt reservations, solemnly  
agreed to in that c &gt;mpact, is not for the pease, happiness  
and prosperity of these Slate*. And that, therefore, this  
commonwealth is determined, as it doubts not its co-Mates  
are. to submit to undelegated and conseqnenliy unlimited  
powers in no man, or body of men. on earth ; that if the  
acts bef -re specified should stand, these conclusions would  
flow from them, that the general government may place  
any act they think proper on the list of crimes ami punish  
it iheraselves. whether enumerated or not enumerated by  
tho constitution cognizable by them, that they may trans­  
fer its cognisance to the president or any other person,  
who may himself be the accuser, counsel, judge and jury,  
whose suspicions may be the evidence, his order the sen­  
tence. his officer the executioner, and his breast the sole  
record .if the transaction, that a very numerous and valu­

the rights and liberties of their co-M nes w ill be xp &lt;ed

wealth in considering the said acts as so pal| able against

that that compact is not meant to be the measure of the  
power of tie general government, hut that if will proceed  
in the exercise over these States of all powers whit- ever.  
That they w ill view this as seizing the l ights of the States

ernment, with the power assumed to bind the States, n t  
merely in case made federal, but in all cases whatsoever,  
by laws made not with their consent, but by others against  
their consent ; that this would be to surrender the form

thority ; ard that the co-States recurring to their natural  
rights in cases not made federal will concur in declan g  
these void and of no force, an I will each unite with this  
commonwealth in requesting their repeal at the next
