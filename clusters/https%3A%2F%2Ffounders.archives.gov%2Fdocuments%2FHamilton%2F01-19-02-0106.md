Minister of France in a letter of the 9 of July of that year made a lively representation upon the subject to our Governt; insisting in a subsequent letter of the 25 of that month in which he recurs to the same point that the principles of neutrality establish that friendly vessels make friendly goods, and, in effect, that the violation of this rule by GBritain was a violation of our neutral rights which we were bound to resent.  
The reply of our Government is seen in a letter from our Secretary of State to that Minister of the 24 of July. It is in these terms. “I believe (says Mr. Jefferson) it cannot be doubted, but that by the general law of Nations, the goods of a friend found in the vessel of an enemy are free and the goods of an enemy found in the vessel of a friend are lawful prize. Upon this principle, I presume, the British armed vessels have taken the property of French Citizens found in our vessels in the cases abovementioned, and, I confess, I should be at a loss on what principle to reclaim them. It is true that sundry nations desirous of avoiding the inconveniences of having their vessels stopped at sea, ransacked, carried into port and detained, under pretence of having enemy goods on board have in many instances introduced, by their special treaties, another principle between them, that enemy bottoms shall make enemy goods and friendly bottoms friendly goods; a principle much less embarrassing to Congress and equal to all parties in point of gain and loss; but this is altogether the effect of particular Treaty, controuling in special cases the general principles of the law of Nations and therefore taking effect between such nations only as have so agreed to controul it.”  
Nothing can be a more explicit or unequivocal abandonment of the rule that free ships make free goods and vice versa than is contained in this communication. But this is not all. In the letter from Mr. Jefferson to our Minister in France of the 26 of Augt. 1793 instructing him to urge the recall of Mr. Genet, the subject is resumed—the position asserted in answer to Mr Genet insisted upon anew and enforced by additional considerations. Among other suggestions, we find these. “We suppose it to have been long an established principle of the law of Nations, that the goods of a friend are free in an enemy’s vessel and an enemy’s goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend. The inconvenience of this principle has induced several nations latterly to stipulate against it by Treaty and to substitute another in its stead, that free bottoms shall make free goods and enemy bottoms enemy goods. We have introduced it into our Treaties with France Holland and Prussia and French goods found by the two latter nations in American bottoms are not made prize of. It is our wish to establish it with other nations. But this requires their consent also, is a work of time, and in the mean while they have a right to act on the general principle without giving to us or to France cause of complaint. Nor do I see that France can lose by it on the whole. For though she loses her goods, when found in our vessels, by the nations with whom we have no treaties, yet she gains our goods, when found in the vessels of the same and all other nations; and we believe the latter mass to be greater than the former.”  
Thus then stood the

xamine the part of it, which has been tortured into a contrary inference.  
After affirming the right to search (B 3 C 7 § 114) he proceeds thus, “But to avoid inconveniences violence and every other irregularity, the manner of the search is settled in the Treaties of Navigation and Commerce. According to the present Custom credit is to be given to certificates and bills of lading produced by the Master of the Ship.” Hence it is alleged the right to search is turned into the right of inspecting the Ships papers which being intitled to credit are to preclude further scrutiny.  
But what immediately follows destroys this conclusion; the words “unless any fraud appear in them or there be very good reason for suspecting

 the true and evident sense of Vatel and it agrees with the doctrine which advocated in these papers, and I will add with the Treaty under examination.  
The 17 article admits that the vessels of each party for just cause of suspicion of having on board enemy’s property or of carrying to the enemy contraband articles may be captured or detained and carried to the nearest or most convenient port of the belligerent party to the end that enemy’s property and contraband articles on board may become lawful prize. But so far from countenancing any proceeding without just cause of suspicion or from exonerating the Officer of the belligerent party from a responsibility for such proceeding it leaves the law of nations, in this particular in full force and contemplating that such Officer shall be liable for damages when he proceeds without just cause of suspicion, provides that all proper measures shall be taken to prevent delay in deciding the cases of Ships or cargoes brought in for adjudication, or in the payment or recovery of any indemnification adjudged or agreed to be paid to the Masters or Owners of such Ships. Besides which, the 19th article stipulates “in order that more abundant care may be taken for the security of the respective subjects and citizens of the contracting parties and to prevent their suffering injuries by the men of War and privateers of either party that the Commanders of Ships of War and Privateers shall forbear doing any damage to those of the other party or committing any outrage against them, and that if they act to the contrary they shall be punished and shall also be bound in their persons and estates to make satisfaction and reparation for all damages and the interest thereof of whatever nature the said damages may be.” And further, after establishing that the Commanders of privateers shall before they are commissioned give security to satisfy all damages and injuries, it adds that in all cases of aggressions their commissions shall be revoked and annulled.  
These provisions not only conform to, &amp; corroborate the injunctions of the laws of Nations, but they refute the assertion that the Treaty is

## [From _The North American Review (1821-1940)_](https://archive.org/details/sim_north-american-review_1823-07_17_40/page/n165/mode/1up?view=theater)

ty of French citizens had been captured by the British on  
ae merchant vessels of the United States, in violation of  
the principle that friendly vessels make friendly goods, and  
demanding that the government should assert its neutrality  
and require the property to be restored. The government  
refused to interfere, as appears by Mr Jefferson’s answer of  
the 24th of July, the whole object of which is to justify this  
refusal. ‘ I believe,’ says he, ‘it cannot be doubted but that,  
by the general law of nations, the goods of a friend found in  
the vessel of an enemy are free, and the goods of an enemy  
found in the vessel of a friend are lawful prize. Upon this  
principle, I presume, the British armed vessels have taken the  
property of French citizens found in our vessels, and I confess  
I should be at a loss on what principle to reclaim it. It is  
true, that sundry nations desirous of avoiding the inconven-  
iences of having their vessels stopped at sea, ransacked, car-  
ried into port, and detained, under pretence of having enemies’  
goods on board, have in many instances introduced, by their  
special treaties, another principle between them, that enemy  
bottoms shall make enemy goods, and friendly bottoms friend-  
ly goods ; a principle much less embarrassing to commerce,  
  
and equal to all parties in point of gain and loss ; but this is  
  
altogether the effect of particular treaty, controlling in special  
  
cases the general principle of the law of nations, and therefore  
  
taking effect between such nations only as have agreed. so to  
  
control it.’*  
  
The letter of the same secretary to the American minister  
at Paris, on the 16th August following, is written with the  
greatest care, being intended as an official vindication of the  
conduct of the government towards M. Genet, and has been  
considered a model in diplomacy. It contains a formal argu-  
ment in favor of the same position.  
  
‘5. Another source of complaint with M. Genet has been,  
that the English take French goods out of American vessels,  
which, he says, is against the law of nations, and ought to be  
prevented by us. On the contrary we suppose it to have  
been long an established principle
