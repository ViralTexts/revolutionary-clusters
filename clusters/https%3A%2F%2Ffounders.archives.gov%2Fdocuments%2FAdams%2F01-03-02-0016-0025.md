This Measure of Imbecility, the second Petition to the King embarrassed every Exertion of Congress: it occasioned Motions and debates without End for appointing Committees to draw up a declaration of the Causes, Motives, and Objects of taking Arms, with a view to obtain decisive declarations against Independence &amp;c. In the Mean time the New England Army investing Boston, the New England Legislatures, Congresses and Conventions, and the whole Body of the People, were left, without Munitions of War, without Arms, Cloathing, Pay or even Countenance and Encouragement. Every Post brought me Letters, from my Friends Dr. Winthrop, Dr. Cooper, General James Warren: and sometimes from General Ward and his Aids and General Heath and many others, urging in pathetic terms, the impossibility of keeping their Men together, without the Assistance of Congress. I was daily urging all these Things but We were embarassed with more than one Difficulty. Not only the Party in favour of the Petition to the King, and the Party who were jealous of Independence, but a third Party, which was a Southern Party against a Northern and a Jealousy against a New England Army under the Command of a New England General. Whether this Jealousy was sincere, or whether it was mere pride and a haughty Ambition, of furnishing a Southern General to command the northern Army. But the Intention was very visible to me, that Col. Washington was their Object, and so many of our staunchest Men were in the Plan that We could carry nothing without conceeding to it. Another Embarrassment which was never publickly known, and which was carefully concealed by those who knew it. The Massachusetts Delegates and other New England Delegates were divided. Mr. Hancock and Mr. Cushing hung back. Mr. Paine did not come forward, and even Mr. Samuel Adams was irresolute. Mr. Hancock himself had an Ambition to be appointed Commander in Chief. Whether he thought, An Election, a Compliment due to him and intended to have the honor of declining it or whether he would have accepted I know not. To the Compliment he had some Pretensions, for at that time his Exertions, Sacrifices and general Merit in the Cause of his Country, had been incomparably greater than those of Colonel Washington. But the Delicacy of his health, and his entire Want of Experience in actual Service, though an excellent Militia Officer, were decisive Objections to him in my Mind. In canvassing this Subject out of Doors, I found too that even among the Delegates of Virginia there were difficulties. The Apostolical Reasonings among themselves which should be greatest, were not less energetic Among the Saints of the Ancient dominion, than they were among Us of New England. In several Conversations I found more than one very cool about the Appointment of Washington, and particularly Mr. Pendleton was very clear and full against. Full of Anxieties concerning these Confusions, and apprehending daily that We should hear very distressing News from Boston, I walked with Mr. Samuel Adams in the State house Yard, for a little Exercise and fresh Air, before the hour of Congress, and there represented to him the various dangers that surrounded Us. He agreed to them all, but said what shall We do? I answered him, that he knew I had taken great pains to get our Colleagues to agree upon some plan that We might be unanimous: but he knew that they would pledge themselves to nothing: but I was determined to take a Step, which should compell them and all the other Members of Congress, to declare themselves for or against something. I am determined this Morning to make a direct Motion that Congress should adopt the Army before Boston and appoint Colonel Washington Commander of it. Mr. Adams seemed to think very seriously of it, but said Nothing.—Accordingly When congress had assembled I rose in my place and in as short a Speech as the Subject would admit, represented the State of the Colonies, the Uncertainty in the Minds of the People, their great Expectations and Anxiety, the distresses of the Army, the danger of its dissolution, the difficulty of collecting another, and the probability that the British Army would take Advantage of our delays, march out of Boston and spread desolation as far as they could go. I concluded with a Motion in form that Congress would Adopt the Army at Cambridge and appoint a General, that though this was not the proper time to nominate a General, yet as I had reason to believe this was a point of the greatest difficulty, I had no hesitation to declare that I had but one Gentleman in my Mind for that important command, and that was a Gentleman from Virginia who was among Us and very well known to all of Us, a Gentleman whose Skill and Experience as an Officer, whose independent fortune, great Talents and excellent universal Character, would command the Approbation of all America, and unite the cordial Exertions of all the Colonies better than any other Person in the Union. Mr. Washington, who happened to sit near the Door, as soon as he heard me allude to him, from his Usual Modesty darted into the Library Room. Mr. Hancock, who was our President, which gave me an Opportunity to observe his Countenance, while I was speaking on the State of the Colonies, the Army at Cambridge and the Ennemy, heard me with visible pleasure, but when I came to describe Washington for the Commander, I never remarked a more sudden and sinking Change of Countenance. Mortification and resentment were expressed as forcibly as his Face could exhibit them. Mr. Samuel Adams Seconded the Motion, and that did not soften the Presidents Phisiognomy at all. The Subject came under debate and several Gentlemen declared themselves against the Appointment of Mr. Washington, not on Account of any personal Objection against him: but because the Army was all from New England, had a General of their own, appeared to be satisfied with him and had proved themselves able to imprison the British Army in Boston, which was all they expected or desired at that time. Mr. Pendleton of Virginia and Mr. Sherman of Connecticutt were very explicit in declaring this Opinion, Mr. Cushing and several others more faintly expressed their Opposition and their fears of discontent in the Army and in New England. Mr. Paine expressed a great Opinion of General Ward and a strong friendship for him, having been his Classmate at Colledge, or at least his contemporary: but gave no Opinion upon the question. The Subject was postponed to a future day. In the mean time, pains were taken out of doors to obtain a Unanimity, and the Voices were generally so clearly in favour of Washington that the dissentient Members were persuaded to withdraw their Opposition, and Mr. Washington was nominated, I believe by Mr. Thomas Johnson of Maryland, unanimously elected, and the Army adopted. The next Question was who should be the Second Officer. General Lee was nominated, and most strenuously Urged by many, particularly Mr. Mifflin who said that General Lee would serve chearfully under Washington, but considering his Rank, Character and Experience could not be expected to serve under any other. That Lee must be aut secundus, aut nullus.— To this I as strenuously objected. That it would be a great deal to expect of General Ward that he should serve under any Man, but that under a stranger he ought not to serve. That though I had as high an Opinion of General Lees Learning, general Information and especially of his Science and experience in War, I could not advize General Ward to humiliate himself and his Country so far as to serve under him.—General Ward was elected the second and Lee the third. Gates and Mifflin, I believe had some Appointments, and General Washington took with him Mr. Reed of Philadelphia, a Lawyer of some Eminence for his private Secretary. And the Gentlemen all sett off for the Camp. They had not proceeded twenty miles from Philadelphia before they met a Courier with the News of the Battle of Bunkers Hill, the Death of General Warren, the Slaughter among the British Officers and Men as well as among ours and the burning of Charlestown. Mr. Hancock however never loved me so well after this Event as he had done before, and he made me feel at times the Effects of his resentment and of his Jealousy in many Ways and at diverse times, as long as he lived, though at othe

Autobiography of Johu Adams.  
We have been permitted, says the New York  
Post, through the indulgence of the publishers  
of this important work, to lay before our read­  
ers several extracts from it, of engrossing inter­  
est, but none will be read with more pleasure  
than the following. It is taken from the Diary,  
and written in Air. Adams’s thirty-ninth year:  
APPOINTMENT OK COL. WASHINGTON AS COMMAND*  
MANDER-IN-C1IIEK OK THE COLONIAL ARMY.  
T his measure of imbecility, the second pe­  
tition to the king, embarrassed every exertion

I without end for appointing committees to draw

! or even countenance and encouragement.—  
! Every post brought me letters from my friends,

i others, urgintr in pathetic terms the impo.-sibih­

tnese things, but we were embarrassed with  
more than one difficulty, not only with the par*  
I ty m favor of the petition to the king, and the  
i party who were jealous of independence, but  
I a third party, which was a southern partv a*  
j gainst a northern, and a jealousy against a New  
, England army under the command of a New  
i England general. Whether this jealousy was

j me that Colonel Washington was their object,  
j and &gt;o many of our staunchest men were in  
j the plan, that we could carry nothing without  
; conceding to it.  
  
Another embarrassment which was nevei  
publicly krfown, and which was carefully con­  
cealed by those who knew it—the Massachu­  
setts and* other New Kngland delegates were  
divided. Mr. Hancock and Mr. Cush ng hong  
; back: Mr. Fame did not come forward; and  
I even Samuel Adams was irresolute. Mr. Han­  
! cock himself had an ambition to be appointed  
I commander-in-chief.* Whether he thought an  
j election a compliment due to him, and intended  
1 to have the honor of declining it, or whether  
&#x27; he would have accepter!. I know not. To the  
compliment he had some preteiis ons, for at  
| that time bis exertions, sacrifices, and general  
merits in the cause of his country had been in­  
comparably greater than those of Col. Wash­  
ington. But the delicac\ of h:s health, and  
; h;s entire want of of experiei.ee in actual ser­  
i vice, though an excellent militia officer, were  
| decisive objections to him in my mind. In can­  
[ vassing this subject, out of doors, 1 found, too,  
that even among the delegates of Virginia,  
there were difficulties. The apostolical rea­  
sonings among themselves, which should be  
greatest, were not less energetic among ihe  
the saints of the ancient dominions than they  
were among us of New Kngland.  
In several conversations, I found more than  
one very cool about the appointment of Wash­  
ington, and particularly Air. Pendleton was  
very clear and full aga n&lt;t it. Full of anxie­  
ties concerning these confusions, and appre­  
hending daily that we should hear ver\ dis­  
tressing news from Boston, I walked with Mr.  
Samuel Adams in the State house vard for a  
little exercise and fresh air before the hour of  
Congress, and ihere represented to him the va­  
rious dangers that surrounded us. He agreed  
to them aP, but said “What shall we do V&#x27; 1  
answered him that he knew f had taken great  
pains to get our colleagues to agree upon some  
plan, that we might be unanimous: but he  
knew that they would pledge themselves to

which should compel th&lt;m and all the other  
members oi Congress to declare themselves for  
or against something. “1 am determined this  
morning to make a direct motion that Congress  
should adopt the army before Boston, and ap­  
point Colonel Washington commander of it.”  
Air. Adams seemed to think very seriously of  
it, but said nothing.  
Accordingly, when Congress had assembled.  
I rose in my place, and, in as short a speech as  
the subject would admit, represented the state  
of the colonies, the uncertainty in the minds of  
the people, their great expectation and anxiety,  
the distresses of the army, the danger of its  
dissolution, the difficulty of collecting another,  
and the probability rhat the British army would  
take advantage ot our delays, inarch out of Bos­  
ton, and spread desolation as far as they could  
go. I concluded with a motion, in torm, that  
Congress would adopt the aitny at Cambridge,  
and appoint a general; that though this was not  
the proper time to nominate a general, yet as I  
had reason to believe this was a point of the  
greatest difficulty, 1 had no hesitation to de­  
clare that 1 had but one gentleman in my mind  
for that important command, and that was a  
gentleman from Virginia, who was among us,  
and very well known to all of us, a gentleman  
whose skill and experience as an officer, w hose  
independent fortune, great talents, and excel­  
lent universal character, would command the  
approbation of all America, and unite the cor­  
dial exertions of all ’he colonies better than an\
other person in the Union.  
  
Mr. Washington, who happened to sit neai  
the door, as soon a&lt; he heard me allude to him.  
from his usual modesty, darted into the library­  
room. Mr. Hancock, w ho was our president,  
which gave me an opportunity to observe his  
countenance while 1 was speaking on the state  
of the colonies, itie army at Cambridge and the  
enemy, heard me with visible pleasure, but,  
when I came to describe Washington for the  
commander, l never remarked a more sudden  
and striking change of countenance. Mortifi­  
cation and resentment were expressed as forci­  
bly as his face could exhibit them. Mr. Sam­  
uel Adams seconded the motion, and that did  
not soften the president&#x27;s physiognomy at all.f  
The subject came under debate, and several of  
the gentlemen declared themselves against the  
appointment of Mr. Washington, not on ac­  
countof any personal objection against him. but  
because the army was all from New England,  
had a General of their own, appeared to be sat­  
isfied with him, and had proved themselves able  
to imprison the British army in Boston, which  
was all they expected or desired at that time.—  
Mr. Pendleton, of Virginia. Mr. Sherman, of  
Connecticut, were very explicit in declaring !  
their opinions. Mr Cushing and several others I  
more faintly e.\pre&gt;sed their opposition and  
their fears of discontent in the army and in j  
New England. Mr. Paine expressed a great  
opinion of General Ward and a strong friend- 1  
ship for him, having been his classmate at col­  
lege. or at least his contemporary, but gave no !  
opinion upon the question. The subject was  
postponed to a future day In the mean time  
pains were taken out of doors to obtain a una­  
nimity. ami the voices were generally so clear­  
ly in favor of Washington that the dissentient  
members were persuaded to withdraw their op­  
position, and Mr. Washington was nominated.!  
I believe, by Mr. Thomas Johnson, of Mary- !  
land, unanimously elected, and the army a-!  
do pted.  
The question was who should be the second 1  
officer. General Lee was nominated and moM  
strenously urged bv many, particularly Mr. Mif­  
flin, who said that General Lee would «erve ;  
cheerfully under Washington, but considering  
his rank, character, and experience, could not j  
be expected to serve under am other: that Lee i  
must be, out secundus out nullus. To this 1 as  
strenuously objected, that it would be a great  
deal to expect of General Ward that he should  
serve under any man, but that under a stranger  
he ought not to serve. That though I had a high  
opinion of General Lee&#x27;s learning, general in­  
formation, and especially of his science and ex­  
perience in war, I could not advise General  
Ward to humiliate himself and his country so,  
far as to serve under him. General Ward wa

left without munitions of war, wltn_  
pay, or even countenance arid encoiifSj  
post brought me letters from my friends,  
throp, Docjor Cooper, General James Warren,!  
sometimes from General Ward and his aids, and C  
Heath and many others, urging in pathetic terms  
impossibility of keeping their men together without the  
as?i tance of Congress. 1 was daily urging all those  
things, hut we were embarrassed with more than one  
difficulty, not only with the party in favor of the peti­  
tion to the king, and the party who were jealous of in­  
dependence, but a third party, which was a southefj  
party against a northern, and a jealousy against a No &#x27;  
1  
England army under the command of a New En,  
land general. Whether this jealousy was sincere, or  
whether it was mere pride and a haughty ambition of  
furnishing a southern general to command the northern  
army, 1 cannot say. But the intention was very visible  
to me that Colonel Washington was their object, and  
so many of our staunchest men were in the plan, that  
we could carry nothing without conceding to it.  
Another embarrassment which was never publicly  
known, and which was carefully concealed by thosp  
who knew it—the Massachusetts and other New Eng­  
land delegates were divided. Mr. Hancock and Mr.  
Cushing hung back; Mr. Paine did not come forward,  
and even Samuel Adams was irresolute. Mr. Hancock  
himself had ambition to be appointed commander-iu­

delegates of Vittmia there were difficulties. The apos­  
tolical reasonings among themselves, which should be  
greatest, wore less energetic among the saints of the  
ancient dominioifalhan they were among us of New

with a motion, in form, that Congress would adopt the  
army at Cambridge, and appoint a general; that though  
this was not the proper time to nominate a general,  
yet as I had reason to believe this was a point of the  
. greatest difficulty, I had no hesitation to declare that  
■ I had hut one gentleman in tny mind for that irnpor­

&lt; as soon as he heard me allude to him, from his usual

came under debate, and several of the gentlemen de­  
’ dared. themselves against the appointment of Mr.

1 against him, but because the tinny was all from New  
England, had a general of their own, appeared to he  
1 satisfied with him, and had proved themselves able to  
, imprison the British army in Boston, which was all they  
i expected or desired at that time. Mr. Pendleton, of Vir­  
; gmia, Mr. and Sherman, ofConnecticut, were very ex­  
plicit in declaring their opinion. Mr. Cushing and se­  
i vend others more faintly expressed their opposition and  
their tears ot discontent in the army and in New England.  
. Mr. Paine expressed a greut op ninn of General Ward  
and a strong friendship for him, having been his class­  
i mate at college, or at least his cotemporary, but gave  
| no opinion upon the question. The subject was pnst­

j taken nut ot doors to obtain a unanimity, and the voices  
were generally so clearly in favor ot Washington that  
| the dissentient members were persuaded to withdraw  
I their opposition, and Mr. Washington was nominated,  
I and 1 believe by Mr. Thomas Johnson of Maryland,  
; Lunin mously elected, and the army adopted.  
.! Tlie question was who should be the second officer.  
! General Lee was nominated and most strenuously

I but considering his ranK, “character, and experience,

Autobiography of John Adams,  
We have been permitted, says the New  
York Post, through the indulgence of the  
publishers of this important work, to lay  
before our readers several extracts trom  
it, of engrossing interest, but none will  
he read with more pleasure than the fol­  
lowing. It is taken from the Diary, and  
written in Mr. Adams&#x27;s thirty -ninth year:  
APPOINTMENT OF COL. WASHINGTON AS COM­  
MANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE COLONIAL ARMY.  
This measure of imbecility, the second  
petition to the king, embarrassed every  
exertion of Congress it occasioned mo­  
tions and debates without end for appoint­  
ing committees to draw up a declaration  
of the causes, motives, and objects of  
taking arms, with a view to obtain deci­  
sive declarations against independence,  
&amp;c. In the mean time, the New England  
army investing Huston, the New England  
legislatures, congresses, and conventions,  
and the whole body of the people, were  
left without munitions of war, without  
aims, clothing, pay, or even countenance  
aiui encouragement. Every post brought  
me letters from my friends Doctor Wm­  
throp, Doctor Cooper, (JencraHas. War­  
icn, and sometimes from General Ward  
and his aids, and General Heath, and ma­  
ny others, urging in pathetic terms the im­  
possibility of keeping their men together  
without the assistance of Congress. I  
was daily urging all these things, but we  
were embarrassed with more than one dil­  
licultv, not only with the party in favor  
&lt;?f the&#x27; petition to the king, and the p irty  
who were jealous of independence, but a  
third party, which was a southern party  
acraint a northern, and a jealousy against  
a New England army under the command  
of a New England general. Whether  
this jealousy was sincere, or whether it  
was pride and a haughty ambition of furn­  
ishing a southern general to command the  
northern, army, 1 cannot say. Hut the  
intention was very visible to me that Col­  
onel Washington was their object, and so  
many of our staunchest men were in the  
plan, that we could carry nothing without  
conceding to it.  
Another embarrassment which was nev­  
er publicly known, and which was care­  
fully concealed by tliose who knew it ? the  
Massachusetts and other New England&#x27;  
delegates were divided. Mr. Hancock&#x27;  
and Mr. Cushing hung back; Mr. Hainej  
did not come forward ; and even Samuel !  
Adams was irresolute. .Air. Hancock him- :  
sell had an ambition to be appointed com­  
mander-in-chief.* Whether he thought  
an c lection a compliment due to him, and !  
intended lo have the honor of declining it. |  
or whether lie would have exccpnd, I  
know not. To ihe compliment lie 1 :ul  
some pretend ml r at thai time l.is &lt; \­  
ertions, sacrifices, aud general mm:!* in  
the cause of his cunimy had been incom­  
parably greater than those of Col. Wash­  
ington. Hut the de.icaev of his htallit,  
. and his entire want el experience in ac­  
tual service, though an excellent u.ilitia  
.oiJicer, were decisive objections t?? him  
?u my mind. In canvassing this sul p c:,  
out o-t doors, I found, too, that even a­  
nnii&#x27;jr i he delegates of Virginia, there were  
iMtiiuliies. Tke apostolical reasoning-*  
  
among themselves, which should l&gt;c great- 1  
est, were not less energetic among the  
r5 n  
saints ??1* the ancient dominions than they  
were among tis of Sew England.  
In several conversations, I found more  
than one very cool about the appointment  
of Washington, particularly Mr. Pendle­  
ton was very clear and full against it.  
Full of anxieties concerning these confu­  
sions, and apprehending dtaly that we ;  
should hear very distressing news front !  
Boston, I walked with Mr. Samuel Adams j  
in the State house yard for a little exere?se  
and fresh air before the hour of Congress,  
and there represented to him the various  
dangers that surrounded us. lie agreed  
to them, all, but said &#x27;What shall we do?&#x27;  
I answered him that he knew I had taken  
great pains to get our colleagues to agree  
upon some plan, that wc might be unani­  
mous ; but lie knew that they would  
pledge themselves to nothing ; but I was  
determined to take a step whioh should  
compel them and all the other members  
of Congress to declare themselves for or  
against something. t4I am determined  
this morning to make a direct motion that  
Congress should adopt the army before  
Boston, and appoint Colonel Washington  
commander of it.&quot; Mr. Adams seemed  
to think very seriously of it, but said no­  
thing.  
Accordingly, when Congress had as­  
sembled, I rose in my place, and, in as  
short a speech as the subject would ad­  
mit, represented the state of the colonies,  
the uncertainty in the minds of the people,  
their great expectation and anxiety, the  
distresses of the army, the danger of its  
dissolution, the difficulty of collecting an­  
other, and the probability that the British  
army would take advantage of our delays,  
march out of Boston, and spread desola­  
tion as far as they could go. I concluded  
with a motion, in form, that Congress  
would adopt the army at Cambridge, and  
appoint a general ; that thought this was  
not the proper time to nominate a general,  
yet as 1 had reason to believe this was a  
point of the greatest difficulty, I had no  
hesitation to declare that I had but one  
gentleman in my mind for that important  
command, and that was a gentleman from  
Virginia, who was among us, and very  
well known to all of us, a gentleman  
whose skill and experience as an officer,  
whose independent fortune, great talents,  
and excellent universal character, would  
command the approbation of all America,  
and unite the cordial exertions of all the  
colonies better than any other person in  
the Union.  
Mr. Washington, who happened to sit  
near the door, as soon as he heard me al­  
lude to him, from his usual modes&#x27;y, dar­  
ted into the library-room. Mr. Hancock,  
who was our president, which gave me  
an opportunity to observe his countenance  
while I was speaking on the state of the  
colonies, the army at Cambridge and the  
enemy, heard me with visible pleasure,  
hut, when I came to describe Washington  
for the commander, I never remarked a  
more sudden and striking change of coun­  
tenance. Mortification and resentment  
were expressed as forcibly as his face  
could exhibit them. Mr. Samuel Adams  
seconded the motion, and that did not soft­  
en the president&#x27;s physiognomy at all.t  
The subject came under debate, and sev­  
eral of the gentlemen declared themselves  
against him, hut because the army was  
all from New England, &gt;had a (General of  
their own, appeared to be satisfied with  
him, and had proved themselves able to  
imprison the British annv in Boston,  
which was all they expected or desired at  
that time. Mr. Pendleton, of Virginia,  
Mr. Sherman, of Connecticut, w^re vend  
explicit in dcclaiing their opinions. Mr.  
Cushing and several others more faintly  
expressed their opposition and their fears  
of discontent in the army and in New  
England. Mr. Paine expressed a great  
opinion of General Ward and a strong  
friendship for him, having been his class­  
mate at college, or at least his cotempora­  
ry. but gave no opinion upon the ques­  
tion. The subject was postponed to a  
future day. In the mean time pains were  
taken out of doors to obtain a unanimity,  
and the voices were generally so clearly  
in favor of Wjsliiugton that the dissentient  
members wcrtf . persuaded to withdraw  
their opposition, and M r. Washington was  
nominated, I believe, bv Mf, Thomas  
Johnson, of Maryland, unanimously elec­  
ted, and the army adopted.  
The question was who should be the  
second officer. General Lee was nomi­  
nated and most strenously urged by many,  
particularly Mr. MiiHin, who said that  
General Lee would serve cheerfully under  
Washington, but considering his rank,  
character, and experience, could not be  
expected to serve under any other ; that  
Lee must be, out sccuh h(8 axit nxiUus.  
To this I as strenuously objected, that it  
would be a great deal to expect of (iener­  
al Ward tl iat he should serve under any  
man, but that under a stranger he ought  
not to serve. That though 1 hail a high  
opinion of General Lee&#x27;s learning, gener­  
al information, and especially of his science  
and experience in war, I could not advise  
Gcneial Ward to humiliate himself and  
his emintrv so far as to serve under him.  
General Ward was elected the second,  
and Lee the third. J Gales and Mifflin, 1  
relieve, had t-ouic appointments, and Gen­  
,* till Washington lookwith him Mi. Heed, of  
Philadelphia, a lawyer of some eminence,

&quot;This measure of imbecility, the second  
petition to the King,embarrassed every ex­  
ertion of Congress; it occasioned motions  
and debates without end, for appointing  
committees to drawt up a declaration of the  
causes, motives, and objects of taking  
arms, with a vicw to obtain decisive decla­  
rations against independence, &amp;c. In the  
mean time the New England army invest­  
ing Boston, the New England Legislatures,  
Congresses, and Conventions, and the  
whole body of the People, were left with­  
out munitions of war, without arms, cloth­  
ing, pay, or even countenance and encour­  
agement. Every post brought me letters  
from my friends, Dr. Winthrop, Dr. Coo­  
per, General James Warren, and some­  
times from General Ward and his aids,  
and General Heath and many others, urg­  
ing in pathetic terms the impossibility of  
keeping their men together without the  
assistance of Congress. I was daily urg­  
ing all these things; but we were embar­  
rassed with more than one disficulty, not  
only with the party in lavor of the pe  
tition to the Eing, and the party who were  
jealous of independence, but a third party,  
which was a Sonthern party against a  
Northern, and a jealousy against a New  
England army under the command of a  
New England general. Whether this  
  
jealousy was sincere, or whether it was  
  
mere pride and a haughty ambition of fur­  
nishing a Southern general to command  
the Northern army, I can not say. But  
the intention was very visible to me, that  
Col. Washington was their object, and so

ingion. But the delicacy of his health,  
and his entire want of experibnce in actual  
service, though an excellent militia officer,  
were decisive objections to him in my  
mind. In canvassing this subject, out of  
  
doors, I found, too, that even among the  
delegates of Virginia there were difficulties.  
The apostolical reasonings among them­  
selves, which should be greatest, were no  
less energetic among the saints of the  
ancient dominion, than they were among  
us of New England. In several conversa­  
tions, I found more than one very cool  
  
about the appointment of Washington, and  
particularly Mr. Pendleton was very clear  
  
and full against. Full of anxieties con­  
cerning these confusions, and apprehend-  
  
ing daily that we should hear very dis  
  
tressing news from Boston, I walked with  
Mr. Samuel Adams in the State House  
vard for a little exercise and fresh air, be­  
fore the hour of Congress, and there rep  
resented to him the various dangers that  
surrounded us. He agreed to them all,  
  
but said, &quot;What shall we do?&quot; I ans­  
wered him, that he knew I had taken  
great pains to get our colleagues to agree  
upon some plan, that we might be unani  
nous; but he knew that they would pledge  
themselves to nothing; but I was deter­  
mined to take a step which should compel  
them and all the other members of Con­  
gress to declare themselves for or against  
something. I am determined this morning  
to make a direct motion that Congress  
  
hould adopt the army before Boston, and  
  
appoint Colonel Washington commander of  
  
it.&quot; Mr. Adams seemed to think very  
seriously of it, but said nothing.  
&quot;Accordingly, when Congress had as­  
sembled, I rose in my place, and, in as  
  
short a speech as the sulject would admit  
representing the State of the Colonies, the  
uncertainty in the minds of the people,  
their great expectition and anxiety, the  
distresses of the army, the danger of its  
disso lution, the difficulty in collecting an  
other, and the probability that the British  
army would take advantage of our delays,  
march out of Boston, and spread desolation  
as far as they could go. I concluded with  
a motion, in form, that Congress would  
adopt the army at Cambridge, and ap­  
point a General; that though this was not  
the proper time to nominate a General,  
yet as I had reason to believe that this  
  
was a point of the greatest difficulty, I had  
  
no hesitation to declare that I had but one  
gentleman in my mind for that important  
command, and that was a gentleman from  
  
Virginia, who was among us, and very­  
well known to all of us, a gentleman whose  
kill and experience as an officer, whose  
independent fortune, great talents, and e  
  
cellent universal character, would com  
mand the approbation of all Amcrica, and  
unite the cordial exertions of all the Colo­  
nies better than any other person in the  
Union.  
&quot;Mr. Washington, who happened to sit  
near the door, as soon as he heard me al­  
lude to him, from his usual modesty, dar­  
ted into the library room. Mr. Hancock,  
who was our President, which gave me an  
opportunity to observe his counlenance  
while I was speaking on the state of the  
Colonies, the army at Cambridge, and the  
enemy--heard me with visible pleasure;  
but when I came to describe Washington  
for the commander, I never remharked a  
more sudden and striking change of coun­  
tenance. Mortification and resentment  
were expressed as forcibly as his face could  
exhibit them. Mr. Samuel Adams second  
ed the motion, and that did not soften the  
President&#x27;s physiogomy at all.? The sub­  
ject came under debate, and several of the  
gentlemen declared themselves against the  
appointment of Mr. Washington, not on  
account of any personal objection against  
him, but because the army was all from  
New England, had a General of their own,  
appeared to be satisfied with him, and had  
proved themselves able to imprison the  
British army in Boston, which was all  
they expected or desired at that time. Mr.  
  
Pendleton of Virginia, Mr. Sherman of  
  
Connecticut, was very explicit in declaring  
their opinion; Mr. Cushing and several  
others more faintly expressed their opposi­  
tion and their fears of discontents in the  
  
Johinson of Maryland, unanimously elect  
  
ed, and the army adopted.  
&quot;The next question was, who should  
be the second officer. General lce was

[From the V&gt; filings of Julia Adams ]  
This measure of imbecility, the second  
petition to the King, embarrassed every  
exertion of Congress; it occasioned mo­  
tions and deb tes without end, for ap­  
pointing a committee to draw up a deo­  
laiHlion of the causes, motives, and object  
of taking arms, with a view to obtain de­  
cisive declarations against independence.  
&lt;kc. In the meantime the New England  
air.iV investing Boston, the New England  
legislatures, congresses and conventions,  
and the whole body of th‘- people, wcie  
left without munitions of war, without  
aims, clothing, pay, or even countenance  
and encouragement. Every post le ought  
me letters from my friends Dr. Wins  
tlirop, D&gt;-. Cooper, Gen. James Warren,  
and sometimes from Gen. Ward and his  
aids, and Gen. Heath, and many otlieis,  
uiging in pathetic terms, the impossibili­  
tv of keeping their men together without  
i lie assistance of Congress. I was daily  
urging all the.e things, but wo were em­  
barrassed with more than one difficulty,  
not only with the party iu favor of the  
petition to the King, and the party who  
were jealous of independence, hut a third  
party, which was a southern against a  
northern, and a jealousy against a New  
England army under the command of a  
New England general. Whether this  
jealousy was sincere, or whether it was  
ineie pride and a haughty ambition of  
furnishing a southern general to command  
the northern army, 1 cannot say. Bui  
the intention was very visible to me that  
Colonel Washington was their object,  
and so many of our staunchest men were  
in the plan that we could carry nothing  
without conceding it.  
Another embarassment which was nev­  
er publicly known, and which was care­  
fully concealed by those who knew r,  
the Massachusetts and btliei New Eng  
land delegates were divided. Mr. Han­  
cock and Mr. Cushing hung back ; Mr.  
Paine did not come ‘orwaid, and even  
Samuel Adams was irresolute. M .  
Hancock himself had ac ambition to he  
appointed commander-in-cliief. Whetliei  
I&#x27;.u ilinnirM tin xlxi-linnii i-iimiiliment due i  
  
o ■  
i him, and intended to Imve llie honor ol  
declining it, or whether lie would have  
! accepted, I know not. To the compli­  
ment he had some pretensions, for, ai  
that lime, his exertions, sacntices, and  
genera! merits in the cause of his country  
had been incomparably greater than those  
of Colonel Washington. But the delica­  
cy of his health, and his entiie want ol  
expei ience in actual set vice, though an  
excellent militia officer, were decisive  
objections to him in iny mind, in can  
vassing this subject out of doors, i found  
loo, that even among the delegates ol  
Virginia there were difficulties. Tin  
upustolic reasonings among themselves,  
which should be the greatest, were no­  
less energetic among the saints of the an­  
cient dominion, than they were among  
us of Nsw England, in several corner  
sations i found more than one very cool  
about the appointment of Washington,  
and particulai ly Mr. Pendleton was very  
clear and full against it. Full of anxiet}  
concerning these confusions, and appre­  
hending daily that we should hear very  
distressing news from Boston, 1 walked  
with Mr. Barnaul Adams in the Butte  
House yard for a little exercise and fresh  
air, before the h •ur of Congress, and there  
represented to him the various dangers  
that surrounded us. He agreed to uicm  
all, but said, What shall we do?&quot; i  
answered him that he knew i bad taken  
great paiue to get colleagues to agree up­  
  
nn some plan, that we might be unani­  
mous; but he knew that they would  
pledge themselves to nothing; but I was  
detei mined to lake a step which should  
compel them and all the other members  
of Congress, to declare themselvts for or  
against something. “ I ant determined  
i his morning to make a direct motion that  
Congress should adool the army before  
Boston, and app ant Golonel Washington  
commander of it.” Mr. Adams seemed  
to think very seriously of L but said noth­  
ing.  
!&#x27;i&#x27; Accordingly, when Congress had as­  
sembled. I rose in my place, and, in as  
*ltorl a speech as t.te subject would ad­  
mit, represented the slate of the colonies,  
the uncertainty in the minds of the peo­  
ple, their great expectation and anxiety,  
the distresses of the army, the danger of  
its dissolution, the difficulty of collecting  
another, and the piobabilitv that the  
British army would lake advantage of j  
our delays, inarch out of Boston, and  
spiead desolation as far as they could go.  
i concluded with a motion, in form, that  
&quot;Congress would adopt the army at Cam­  
bridge, and appoint a general. and tho’  
this was not the proper lime to nominate  
a general, yet as I had reason to believe  
tins was a point of the greatest difficulty,  
l l.ad no hesitation to declare that l had  
but one gentleman in mv mind, and that  
was a gentleman from Virginia, who was  
among us and very well known to all of  
us—a gentleman whose skill and expeii­  
ence as an officer, whose independent for­  
tune, great talents, and excellent univer­

billion of all America, and unite the cor­  
dial exertions of all the colonies belter  
than any oilier person in the Uni &gt;n.  
Mr. Washington, who happened to sit  
near the door, as soon as he heard me  
allude to him, from his usual modesty,  
darted into the libuiry room. Mr. Han­  
cock, who was our President, which gave  
me an opportunity to observe his counte­  
nance while 1 was speaking on the state  
of the colonies, the army at Cambridge,  
and ttie enemy, beard me with visible  
pleasure, but when I came to describe  
Washington for the commander, I nevei  
rein Hiked a more sudden and striking  
change of countenance. Mortification  
and lesentmeiu were expressed as forci  
hly as his lace could exhibit them. Mi.  
Samuel Adams seconded the motion, and  
that uid not sullen the President’s phys  
ionogomv at all. The subject came un­  
der debate, and severel gentlemen de­  
clared themselves against Lhe appoint­  
ment of Mr. •Washington, not on accouni  
of any personal objection against him  
bill because the army was all front New  
England, had a general of their own, ap  
peaied to be satisfied with him, and laid  
proven themselves able to imprison the  
Uiitish army in Boston, which was all  
they expected or desired at that li.ne.—  
Mr. Pendleton of Virginia, and Mr. Sliet­  
man of Connecticut, were very explicit  
in declaring their opinion; Mr. Cushing  
and several others, faintly expressed their  
opposition and their fears of discontent  
in the army and in New England. Mr.  
Paine expiessed a great opinion of Gen.  
Ward, Hnd a strong friendship for him,  
having been his classmate at collvge, or.  
at least, his cotemporary ; but gave no  
opinion upon the question.

Every post brought rr*e letter? from my friends, Dr. in  
throp, Dr. Cooper, Gen. James Warren, and sometimes from  
Gen. Ward and his aids, and Gen. Heath and many others,  
urging, in pathetic terms, the impossibility of k?e;iing &lt;h&#x27;ir  
men together without the aisistance of Congress. I was  
daily urging all these things, but we were embarrassed wuh  
more than one difficulty, not only with the party in favor o  
the petition to the King, and the party who were jealous of  
independence, but a third party, which waa a Southern party  
against a Nonhern, and a jealousy against a New England  
army under the command of a New England Genera.  
Whether thia jealousy waa sincere, or whether it was mere  
pride and a haughty ambition of furnishing a Southern Gene­  
ral to command the Northern army, I canntt say ; but the  
intention waa very visible to me that Colonel Washington  
was thair object, and so many of our atanchest men were in  
(ha plan that we coald carry nothing without conceding to it­  
Another embarrassment, which waa never publicly known,  
aid which waa carefully concealed by those who knew it, the  
Massachusetts and other New England delegatea were divid­  
ed. Mr. Hancock and Mr. Cu?hing hung back, Mr. Paine  
did not come forward, and even Mr. Samuel Adam. was irra­  
solute. Mr. Hsncock himself had an ambition to be appoint­  
ed Commander-in-Chief. Whether he thought an electfcn a  
compliment due to him, and intended to have the honor of  
declining it, or whether he would have accepted it, I know  
not. To the compliment he had some pretensions; for, at  
that time, hia exertions, sacrifices, and general merits in the  
cause of his country, had been incomparably greater than  
those of Colonel Washington. But the delicacy of his heal.h,  
and his entile want of experience in actual service, though  
an excellent militia officer, were decisive objections to him in  
my mind. In canvassing thia subject, out of doors, I found  
too that even among the delegates of Virginia there were  
difficulties. The apostolical reasonings among themselves  
which should be greatest were not less energetic among the  
aainu of the Ancient Dominion than they were among us of  
New England. In several conversations I found more than  
one very cool about the appointment of Washington, and  
particularly Mr. Pendleton waa very clear and full against it  
Full of anxieties concerning these confusions, and appre­  
hending daily that we should hear very diatressing news from  
Boston, I walked with Mr. Samuel Adams in the State House  
yard for a little exercise and fresh air before the hour ofCoo­  
gress, and there represented to him the various dangers that  
surrounded us. He agreed to them all, but aaid : &quot; What  
ahall we do ?&quot; I answered him that he knew that I had  
taken great pains to get our colleagues to agree upon some  
plan, that we might be unanimous ; but he knew that they  
would pledge themselves to nothing 5 but 1 was determined  
to take a step which should compel them and all the othei  
members of Congress to declare themselves for or against  
something. &quot; I am determined this morning to make a direct  
motion that Corgreas ahould adopt the army before Boston,  
and appoint Colonel Washington commander of it.&quot; Mr.  
Adams seemed to think very seriously of it, but aaid nothing.  
Accordingly, when Congreas had assembled, I rose in my  
place, and in as sliort a speech as the subject would admit,  
represented the state of the Colonies, the uncertainty in the  
minds of the people, their great expectation and anxiety, the  
diatresaes of the army, the danger of iu diasolution, the diffi­  
culty of collecting another 5 and the probability that the  
British army would take advantage of our delaya, march out  
of Boston, and spread des dation aa far aa they could go. I  
a included with a motion, in form, that Congress would adopt  
the army at Cambridge, and appoint a General 5 that though  
this was not the proper time to nominate a General, yet, as I  
had reason to believe this was a point of the greatest difficulty,  
I had no hesitation to declare that I had but one gentleman  
in my mini for that important command, and that was a gen­  
tleman from Virginia, who was among us, and very well  
known to all of us ; a gentleman whose experience as an offi­  
cer, whose independent fortune, great talents, and excellent  
universal character would command the approbation of all  
Americi, and unite the cordial exertions of all the Colonies  
better than any other person in the Union. Mr. Washing­  
ton, who sat near the door, as loon as he heard me allude to  
him, from his usual modesty, darted into the library room.  
Mr. Hancock, who was our President, which gave me an  
opportunity to observe his countenance while I was speaking  
on the state of the Colonies, the army at Cambridge, and the  
enemy, heard me with visible pleasure ; but when I came to  
describe Washington for the commander, I never marked a  
more sudden and striking change of countenance. Mortifi-,  
cation and resentment were expressed as forcibly aa hia face  
could exhibit them. Mr. Samuel Adams seconded the mo­  
tion, and that did not aoften the President&#x27;s physiognomy at  
all. The subject came under debate, and several gentlemen  
declared themselvee against the appointment of Mr. Wash­  
ington, not on account of any personal objection againat him,  
but because the army were all from New England, had a  
General of their own, appeared to be aatiafied with him, and

Boston, which waa all they expected or desired at that time.  
Mr. Peadleton, of Virginia, Mr. Sherman, of Connecticut,

THE GAZETTE. !  
SATURDAY MORNING, MAY 3, 1851. j  
jlOVV WASHINGTON WAS MADE COM-j  
MANDER IN-CHIEF.  
From Works of John Adams.  
Every post brought me letters from my,  
friends, Dr. Winthrop, Dr. Cooper, Gen. James I  
Warren, and sometimes from Gen. WarJ and  
his aids, and Gen Heath and many others, ur  
Sin*, in pathetic terms, the impossibility 01  
eeping their men together without lhe.,aT1&gt; ‘  
*nce of Congress. I was daily urging all these  
things, but we were embarrassed »it j  
than one difhculty, not only with t ie l&gt;a &gt; |  
favor of the petition to the King, and the pa &gt;  
■who were jealous of independence, but a third  
party, whiih was a. Southern party against a  
Northern, and a jealousy against a New fcng-,  
land army under the command of a New tug­  
and General. Whether this jealousy was sin­  
cere, or whether it was mere pride and a haugh­  
tv ambition of furnishing a Southern General  
to command the Northern army (1 cannot say;)  
but the intention was very visible to me that  
Pnlonel Washington was their object, and so  
  
many of our staunchest men were in the plan,  
that we could carry nothing without cor wading  
to it. Another erobanassment. which was nev­  
er publicly known, and which was carefully  
concealed by those who knew it, the Massa­  
chusetts and other New England delegates were  
divided. Air. Hancock and Air. Cushing hung  
back; Mr. Paine did not come forward, and even  
Mr. SamM. Adams was irresolute. Mr. Han­  
cock himself had an ambition to be appointed  
Commander-in-Chief. Whether he thought an  
election a compliment due to him, and intended  
to have the honor of declining it, or w hether  
he would have accepted it, I know not. To  
the compliment he had some pretensions, for, at  
that time, his exertions, sacrifices, and general  
merits in the cause of his country, had been in­  
comparably greater than those of Colonel  
Washington. But the del cacy of his health,  
and his entire want of experience m actual ser­  
vice, though an excellent militia officer, were  
decisive objections to him in my inind. In  
canvassing this subject, out of doors, I found  
too that even among the delegates of \irginia  
there were difficulties. The apostolical reason­  
ings among themselves, which should be great­  
est, were not less energetic among the saints of  
the ancient dominion than they were among us  
of New England. In several conversations I  
found more than one very cool about the ap­  
pointment of Washington, and particular!)  
Air Pendleton was very clear and full against it.  
Full of anxieties concerning these confusions,  
and apprehending daily that we should hear  
very distressing news from Boston, 1 walked  
with Mr. Samuel Adams in the State House  
yard, for a little exercise and fresh air before  
the hour of Congress, and there represented to  
him the various dangers that surrounded us.—  
He agreed to them all, but said—uWhat shall  
we do1” I answered him that he knew that I  
had taken great pains to gel our colleagues to  
agree upon some plan, that we might be unani­  
mous; but he knew that they would pledge  
themselves to nothing; hut 1 was determined to  
take a step which should compel them and all  
the other members of Congress to declare them­  
selves for or against something. “I am deter-1  
mined this morning to make a direct motion!  
that Congress should adopt the army before;  
Boston, and appoint Colonel Washington com­  
mander of it.” Mr. Adams seemed to think  
very seriously of it, but said nothing. j  
Accordingly, when Congress had assembled, ■  
1 rose in my place, and in as short a speech as j  
the subject would admit, represented the state j  
of the Colonies, the uncertainty in the minds  
of the people, their great expectation and anxi­  
ety, the distresses of ihe army, the danger of  
its dissolution, the difficulty of collecting anoth­  
er; and the probability that the British army  
would take advantage of our delays, march out  
of Boston, and spread desolation as far as they &gt;  
could go. 1 concluded with a motion, in form,  
that Congress would adopt the army at Cam­  
bridge, and appoint a General: that though this  
was not the proper time to nominate a General..  
yet, as l had reason to believe this was a point  
of the greatest difficulty, I bad but one gen­  
tleman in my mind for that important com-:  
mand, and that was a gentleman from A ir­  
ginia, who was among us, and very well  
known to all of us, a gentleman whose experi­  
ence as an officer, whose independent fortune,  
  
great talents, and excellent universal character,  
would command the approbation of all Ameri­  
ca, and unite the cordial exertions of*all the!  
Colonies better than any other person in the;  
Union. Mr. Washington, who sat near the  
door, a* soon as he heard me allude to him,  
from his usual modesty darted into the library  
room. Mr. Hancock, who was our President,!  
which gave me an opportunity to observe his  
countenance while I was speaking on the state j  
of the Colonies, the army at Cambridge, and  
the enemy—heard me with visible pleasure; but  
when I came to describe Washington tor the!  
commander, I never marked a more sudden  
and striking change of countenance. Morti- j  
ficatkm and resentment were expressed as  
forcibly as his face could exhibit them. Mr.  
Samuel Adams seconded the motion, and that  
did not soften the President’s physiogoroy!  
at all. The subject came under debate,  
and several gentlemen declared themselves  
against the appointment of Mr. Washington, not  
on account of any personal objection against  
him, but because the army were all from New  
England, had a general of their own, appeared  
to be satisfied with him, and had proved them- j  
selves able to imprison the British army in Bos- j  
ton, which was all they expected or desired at j  
that time.  
Mr. Pendleton, of Virginia, Mr. Sherman of  
Connecticut, were very explicit in declaring  
this opinion. Mr Cushing and several olh-j  
ers more faintly expressed their opposition, and ;  
their fears of discontent in the army and in  
New England Mr. Paine expressed a great,  
opinion of General Ward and a strong friend- j  
ship for him, having been his classmate at col- j  
lege, or at least his contemporary; hut gave no j  
opinion on the question. The subject was  
postponed to a future day. In the meantime,  
pains were taken out of doors to obtain a  
unanimity, and the voices were generally so  
clearly in favor of Washington, that the dissen­  
tinent members were persuaded to withdraw  
their opposition, and Mr. Washington was nom­  
inated, I believe, by Mr. Thou. Johnson of  
Mary land unanimously elected, and the Army  
adopted. &#x27; 1

ern party against a Northern, and a jealousy a­  
gainst a New England army under the command  
of a New England Genera. Whether this jeal­  
ousy was sincere or whether it was more pride  
and a haughty ambition of furnishing a Southern  
General to command the Northern army, l ean

not say, but ihe intention was very Tia.r .

Whether he thousht an election a compliment

decisive objections to him in my mind. In can­  
vassing this subiect. out of doors, I ound too that

Quarantine. The lowa left New Orleans

How Washington was saade Comman  
  
der-in-Chief.  
From Works of John Jidam.  
ry post brought me leMers from my  
friends. Dr. Winthrop, Dr. Cooper, Oen  
James Warren, and sometimes from Gen.  
Ward and his aids, and Gen. Heath and  
many others, urging, in pathetic terms, the  
impossibility of beeping their men together  
without the assistance of Congress. I was  
daily urging all thise things, but we were  
embaarrassed with more than one difficulty  
not only with the party in favor of the pe  
tition to the King, and the party who were  
jealous of independence, but a third party,  
bicb was a Southern party against a Nor  
thern, and a jealousy against a New En­  
gland armf under the Command of a New  
England General. Whether this jealousy  
was sincere, or whether it was mere pride  
and a haughty ambition of furnishing a  
Southern General to command tbe North­  
ern army (I cannot say;) but the intention  
was very visible to me that Colonel Wash  
ington was their object, and so many of our  
staunchest men were in the plan, that we  
could carry nothing without conceding to  
it Another embarrassment, which was  
never publicly known, and which was care­  
fully concealed by those who knew it, th-  
Massachusetts and other New England del  
egates were divided. . Mr. Hancock and  
Mr. Cushinghnng back; Mr. Paine did not  
come forward, and even Mr. Bam7! Adams  
was irresolute. Mr. Hancock himself had  
an ambition to be appointed Commander-in  
Chief. Whether be thought an election  
compliment due to him, and intended to  
have the honor of declining it, or whether  
he would have accepted it, I know not. To  
the compliment he had some pretensions,&#x27;  
for, at that time, his exertions, sacrifices,  
and general merits in the cause of bis coun  
try, had been incomparably greater than  
those of Colonel Washington. But tbe del  
icacy of his health, aud his entire want of  
experience in actual servioe,thougu an ex  
celient militia officer, were decisive objec­  
tions to him in my mind. In canvassing&#x27;  
this subject, out of doors, I found too that  
even among the delegates of Virginia there  
were difficulties. X be apostolic, reasonings  
among themselves, which should be great  
est, were not less energetic among the  
saints of the ancient dominion than they  
were among ns of New England. In sev  
eral conversations I found more than our  
very cool about the appointment of Wash­  
ington, and particularly Mr. Peudleton was  
very clear and full against it.  
Full of anxieties concerning these eon  
fusions, and apprehending daily .that we  
should hear very distressing news from  
Boston, I walked with Mr. Samuel Adams  
in the State House yard, for a little exer  
cise and fresh air before the hour of Con  
gress, and there represented to him the va  
rious dangers that surrounded us. He a­  
greed to them all, but said &quot;What shall  
we dor&quot;&#x27; I answered him that lie knew  
that I had taken great paina to get our col  
league to agree upon some plan, that we  
might be unanimous; but he knew that they  
would pledge themselves to nothing; but l  
was determined to take a step wbicb should  
compel them and all the other members of  
Congress to declare themselves for or a-  
gainst something. &quot;I am determined .this  
morning to make a direct motion that tton  
gress should adopt the army before Boston,  
and appoint Uoionel Washington comman  
der of it.&quot; Mr. Adams seemed to think  
very seriously of it, but said nothing.  
Accordingly, when Congress bad assem  
bled, I rose in my place, and in as short a  
speech as the subject would admit, repre­  
sented the state of the Colonies, the uncer­  
tainty in the minds of the people.their great  
expectation and anxiety, tbe distresses ol.  
the army, ine danger oi us aissoiuuon, me  
difficulty of collecting another; and the  
probability that the British army would  
take advantage of our delays, march out of  
Boston, and spread desolation as tar as they  
could go. I concluded with a motion, in  
form, that Congress would adopt the army  
at Cambridge, and appoint a Ueneral; that  
though this was not the proper time to nom  
inate a Ueuerai, yer, as l naa reason to oe  
lieve this was a point of the greatest diffi  
cultv. I had but one gentleman in my mind  
for that important command, and that was  
a gentleman from Virginia, who was among  
us, and very well known to all of us, a gen-j  
tlemanwhose experience as an officer, whose  
experience as an officer, -whose indepen  
dont fortune, great talents, and excellent  
universal character, would command the  
approbation of all America, and unite tbe  
cordial exertions of all the Colonies better  
than any other person in the Union. Mr.  
Washington, who sat near the door, as soon  
as he heard me allude to him, from bis usu  
al modesty darted into the library room.

impossibiilty of keeping their men together,

jealous of independance, but a third party,  
which was a Southern party against a  
Northern, and a jealousy against a New  
England army under the command of a  
New England General. Whether this jeal­  
ousy was sincere, or whether it was pride

(I cannot say;) but the intention was very

Another embarrassment, which was never  
publicly known, and which was carefully  
  
concealed by those who knew it, the Massa  
chusetts and other New England delegates  
were divided, Mr. Hancock and Mr. Cush­

the compliment he had some pretension, for,  
at that time, his exertions, sacrifices, and

had been imcomparably greater than those

his health, and his entire want of experience  
in actual servee, though an excellent militia  
offlcer, were decisive objections to him in  
my mind. In canvassing this subject, out of

HOW WASHINGTON WAS MADE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.  
Every post brought me letters from my friends  
Dr. Winthrop, Dr. Cooper, Gen. James Warren,  
and sometimes from Gen. Ward and his  
aids, and Gen. Heath and many others, urging,  
in pathetic terms, the impossibility of keeping  
theirmen together without the assistance of Congress.  
I was daily urging all these things, but  
we were embarrassed with more than one difficulty,  
not only with the parly iu favor of the  
petition to the King, and the party which was a  
Southern party, who were jealous of independence,  
but a third party against a Northern, and  
  
a jealousy against a New England army under  
the command of a New England General.?  
Whether this jealousy was sincere, or whether  
it was mere pride and a haughty ambition of  
furnishing a Southern General to command the  
Northern army, I cannot say; hut the ;ntention  
was very visible to me that Colonel Washington  
was their object, and so many of our  
staunchest men were in the plan, that we could  
carry nothing without conceding to it Another  
embarrassment, which was never publicly  
known, and which was carefully concealed  
by those who knew it, the Massachusetts and  
other New England delegates were divided.?  
Mr. Hancock and Mr. Cashing hung back, MrPaine  
did not come forward, and even Mr.  
Samuel Adams was irresolute. Mr. Hancock  
himself had an ambition to be appointed Commander-in-Chief.  
Whether he thought an  
election a compliment due to him, and intended  
to have the houor of declining it. or whether he  
would havo accepted it, I know not. To the  
compliment he had some pretensions; for, at  
that time, his exertions, sacrifices, and general  
merits in the cause of his country had been incomparably  
greater than those of Colonel  
Washington. But the delicacy of his health,  
and his entire want of experience in actual ser­  
  
vice, tnoiign an excellent muma omcer, were  
decisive objections to him in my mind. In  
canvassing this subject, out of doors, i found  
too that even among the delegates of Virginia  
there were difficulties. The apostolic reasonings  
among themselves which should be greatest  
were not less energetic among the saints of  
die Ancient Dominion than they were among  
us of New England. In several conversations  
1 found more than one very cool about the appointment  
of Washington, and particularly Mr.  
Pendleton was very clear and full against it.  
Full of anxieties concerning these confusions,  
and apprehending daily that we should hear  
very distressing news from Boston, I walked  
with Mr. Samuel Adams in the State House  
yard for a little exercise and fresh air before the  
hour of Congress, and there represented to him  
the various dangers that surrounded us. He  
agreed to them all, but said; &#x27;&quot;Whti shall wo  
do ?&quot; I answered him that he knew that I had  
taken great pains to get our colleagues to agree j  
upon some plan, that we might be unanimous;  
but he knew that the}&#x27; would pledge themselves  
to nothing; but I was determioed to take a  
stop which should compel them and all the otli­  
  
er members 01 uougress 10 oecinre inemseives  
for or against something. &quot;I am determined  
this morning to make a direct motion that Congress  
should adopt the army before Boston,  
and appoint Colonel Washington commander  
of it.&quot; Mr. Adams seemed to think very seriously  
of it, hut said nothing.  
Accordingly, when Congress had assembled,  
1 rose in my place, and in a3 short a speech as  
the subject would admit, represented the state  
of the colonies, the uncertainty in the minds  
of the people, their great expectation and anxiety,  
the distresses of the army, the danger of  
its dissolution, the difficulty of collecting another  
; and the probability that the British arniv  
would take advantage of ourdelavs. march  
  
w O- - ^ &#x27;  
out of Boston, and spread desolation as far as  
they could go. I concluded with a motion, in  
forin, that Congress would adopt the army at  
Cambridge, and appoint a General; that though  
this was not the proper time to nominate a general,  
yet, as 1 had reason to believe this was a  
point of the greatest difficulty, 1 had no hesitation  
to declare that I had but one gentleman in  
my mind for that important command, and that  
was a gentleman from Virginia, who was  
among us, and very well known to all of us; a  
gentleman whoso experience as an officer, whose  
independent fortune, great talents, and excellent  
universal character would command the  
approbation of all America, and unite the cordial  
exertions of all the colonies bettor than any  
other person in the Union. Mr. Washington,  
who sat near the door, as soon as he heard mo  
allude to him, from bis usual modesty, darted  
iuto the library room. Mr. Hancock, who was  
our President, which gave me an opportunity  
to observe his countenance while I was speaking  
on the state of the colonics, the army at  
Cambridge, and the enemy, heard me with visi.  
. * J ;t  
  
bio pleasure; but when i came iu uescriuu  
Washington for the commander, I never marked  
a more sudden and striking change of countenance.  
Mortification and resentment wero  
expressed as forcibly as his face could exhibit  
them. Mr. Samuel Adams seconded the motion,  
and that did not soften the President&#x27;s physiognomy  
at all. The subjoct came under debate,  
and several gentlemen declared themselves  
against the appointment of Mr. Washington,  
not on account of any personal objoction  
against him, but because the army were all  
from New England, had ageneralof their own,  
appeared to be satisfied with him, and had  
proved themselves able to imprison the British  
army in Boston, which was all they expocted  
or desired at that time.  
Mr. Pendleton, of Virginia, and Mr. Sherman,  
of Connecticut, wero very explicit in de_1-_:  
tU:? nn;nUn Mr (^IchinDnnd Cairn rift 1  
  
Ciailllg una u|iiuiuu. B -..v. uw.wfM  
others more faintly expressed their opposition,  
and their fears of discontent in the army and in  
New England. Mr. Paine expressed a great  
opinion of Gen. Ward and a strong friendship  
for him, having been his classmato at college,  
  
or at least his cotemporary; but gave no opinion  
on the question. The subject was postponed  
to a future day. In the meantime pains  
were taken out of doors to obtain a unanimity,  
and the voices were generally so clearly in favor  
of Washington, that the dissenting members  
were rarsuaded to withdraw their opposition,  
and Mr. Washington was nominated, I believe  
by Mr. Thomas Johnson, of Maryland,  
unanimously elected, and the array adopted.

HOW WASHINGTON AS:5IADE C0H-  
, - :: IANDER-IN-GHIEF. &#x27; , .  
&#x27; &#x27; &quot; FROM &quot;WORKS OF. JOHWADAMS  
. ; . i &#x27;  
Every post brought me letters from my friends,  
Dr Winthrop, Dr. Cooper, Gen. &#x27; James.War­  
ren, and sometimes from Gen. Ward and - his  
aids, and Gen. Heath and many others, urging,  
in pathetic terms,&#x27; the impossibility of keeping  
  
  
their men together without the assistance of  
Congress. I . was.daily urging all these things,  
but we were embarrassed with more than one  
difficulty, not only with the party In favor of the  
petition to the Jtunsr. and - the nartv wno were  
jealous of Independence, but a third party, which  
was a Southern party against a Northern, and i  
jealousy against a New fngland army under the  
command of a New England GeneraL ;Wheth  
er this. jedus!i&#x27;8ineer1(r&#x27;: whetherjt was  
gicte pndaandahaughty ambfo  
a Southern General Us command the Northern  
army,&quot;I cannot say; but the intention was veiy  
yisable to me that Colonel Vashlngton was.heu;  
object, and so many of otk stanches! ; rnen were  
in the plain that we could carry nothing without  
conceding to it. Another embarrassment, which  
was never publicly . known, and which was care­  
fully concealed by those who knew it, theMas­  
sachusetts and other New England delegates  
were divided. . Mr. Hancock&quot;: and Mr. Cushing  
hung , back, Mr. Paine did not come forward,  
and even Mr. Samuel Adams . was irresolute.  
Mr. Hancock himself had an ambition to be jap­  
pointed Commander-in-Chief. Whether, he  
thought; an election a compliment due to him,  
and intended to have the honor of declining it,  
or whether he would have accepted it, I know  
not. To the svmpliment ho had some preten­  
tions : for, at that time, his exertions, sacrifices,  
and general merits in the cause of his country,  
had been incomparably greater &quot; than those of  
Colonel Washington. . But the. delicacy of . his  
health, and his entire, want of experience, in  
actual service, though an excellent militia officer,  
were decisive objections to him in my mind.  
In canvassing this subject, out of doors, I found  
too that even among the delegates of Virginia  
there wcre difficulties. . The apostolical reason­  
ings among themselves which should be greatest  
were not less energetic among the saints of the  
Ancient Dominion than they were among us of  
New England. In several conversations I  
found more than one very cool about tho ap  
pointment of vY ashing ton, ; and particularly  
Mr. Pendleton was very  
it. , . &#x27;  
clear and full against  
Full of anxieties concerning these confusions,  
and apprehending . daily , that we should hear  
very distressing news from Boston, I walked  
with Mr. Samuel Adams . in the State House,  
yard for &amp; little exercise and fresh air before the  
hour of Congress, and there represented to him  
the various dangers that surrounded us. He a­  
greed to . them all, but . said 2 &#x27;What shall we  
do I answered hiin that he Iqiew.that I had  
taken great pains, to get our colleagues to agree  
upon some plan, that we might be unanimous. ;  
but he knew that they would pledge themselves  
to nothing ; but I was determined to take a step  
which should compel them and all . the ; other  
members of Congress to declare themselves for  
or against something. &quot;I am determined this  
morning to make a direct motion that Congress  
should adopt the army before Boston, and ap­  
point Colonel Washington commander of it&#x27;  
Mr. Adams seemed to think very seriously of  
it, but said nothing. ,  
. Accordingly, when Congress had assembled, I  
rose in my place, and in as short a speech as the  
subject would admit, represented the state of the  
Colonies, the uncertainty in the minds of the  
people, their great expectation and anxiety, the  
distresses of the army, the danger of its dissolu­  
tion, the difficulty qf collecting iinother ; and the  
probability that the British army would take ad­  
vantage of our delays, march out of Boston, and  
spread desolation as far as they could go. 1 1 con­  
cluded with a motion, in form, that Congress  
would adopt the army at Cambridge, and ap­  
point a General j; that though this was not the  
proper time to nominate a General, yet, as I  
had reason to believe this was a point , of the  
greatest difficulty, I had no hesitation to declare  
that I had but one gentleman in my mind .for  
that important command, and that was a gentle­  
man from Virginia, who was among us, and very  
well known to all of us ; a gentleman whose ex­  
perience as ad officer; whose independent fortune j  
great talents, and excellent universal character  
would command the approbation of all America,  
and unite the cordial exertions of all the Colonies  
better than any other person in the Union. Mr.  
Washington, who sat near the door, as soon as  
he heard me allnde to him, from his usuarmode  
esty, darted into the library : room. MrV Han­  
cock, who was our President, gave me an oppor­  
tunity to observe his countenance while I was  
Speaking on the state of the Colonies, the army  
at Cambridge, and the enemy, heard me with  
visible pleasure t but when I came to describ-  
Washington for the commander, I never marked  
&amp; more euuueu , ami stfuuug cuauge vi wuuie­  
nance. . Mortification and resentment were ex­  
pressed as forcibly as hla face could exhibit them..  
Sir. Samuel Adams seconded the motion, and  
that did not soften the President&#x27;s physiognomy  
at alL .The subject came under debate, and se­  
veral gentlemen declared themselves against the  
appointment of Mr. Washington j not on account  
of any personal objection against him, but be­  
cause the army were all from New England; had  
a General of their own, appeared to be satisfied  
with him, and had proved themselves able to im­  
prison the British army in Boston, which was all  
they expected or desired at that time.  
- Mr. Pendleton, of Virginia, Mr. Sherman, of  
Connecticut, were very explicit in declaring this  
pinion. Mr.: Cashing and several other more  
faintly expressed their eppositionrand their fears  
or aisconient m ine army ana m new ngiana.  
3Ir. Paine expressed a great opinion of General  
ara ana a strong inenosnip ior aim, jiavmg  
been his classmate&quot; at college, or at least his con­  
temporaryj ; but gave no opinion on the question.  
The subject was postponed to a future day V In  
Jthe meantime pains were taken out of . doors to  
obtain a unanimity, &#x27;and the voices were gener­  
ally so clearly in favor of, Washington, that the  
dissenting members were persuaded to; withdraw  
their opposition, and:Mr; Washington was nom­  
inated, I believe, by Mr ;Thomas Johnson of  
Maryland, unanimously, elected, and the army  
  
aooptea.

Jas. Warren, and sometimes from General

not only the party in favor of the petition

which was a Southern party against a Nor- &#x27;  
  
thern party, and a jealousy against a New  
England army under the Command of a  
New England General. Whether this jea-  
lousy was sincere, or whether it was pride  
and haughty ambition offurnishing a South-  
ern General to command a Northern army,  
Icannot say; but the intention was very  
visible to me that Colonel Washington was  
their object, and so many of our staunchest  
men were in the plan, that we could do no-  
thing without conceding to it.  
  
Another embarressment which was never  
publicly known, and which was carefully  
concealed by those who knew it, the Mas-  
sachusetts and other New England dele-  
gates weredivided. Mr. Hancock and Mr.

very clear and full against it.  
  
Full of anxieties concerning these con-

they could go. I concluded, with a motion,  
in form, that Congress would adopt the

that though this was not a proper place to

» I was daily urging all these things, but we !  
were embarrassed with more than one difficulty, J  
not only with the party in favor of the petition t  
to the King, and the party who were jealous of

independence, buta third parly, which was a  
Southern par*y against a Northern, and a jeal­  
ousy against a New England army under the)  
command of a New England General. Wheth­  
er this jealousy was sincere, or whether it was  
mere pride and a haughty ambition of furnish­  
ing a Southern General to command the North­  
eruarmy, (I cannot sav); hut the intention was  
which was carefully concealed by those who  
knew i&#x27;, the Massachusetts and other New  
England delegates were divided. Mr. Hancock  
and Mr. Cushing hung back , Mr. Paine did  
not come forward, and even Mr. Samuel Adams  
was irresolute. Mr. Hancock himself had an  
ambition lobe appointed Commander-in-chief,  
Whether he thought an election a compliment  
due to him, and intended lo have the honor of  
declining it, or whetber lie would have accep­  
ted, I know not. To the compliment he had  
«orne pretensions, for, allhat time, his ex er­  
lions, sacrifices, and general merits in the  
cause of his country bad been incomparably  
greater than those of Col. Washington. Rut  
the delicacy of his health, and his entire want!  
ol experience in actual service, though an ex-!  
celleut military officer, were decisive objections  
to him in my mind. In canvassing this subject  
out of doors 1 found too. that even among J the  
delegates of Virginia there were difficulties.­  
The apostolical reasonings among themselves,  
which should be greatest, were not less ener-1  
gelic among the saints of the ancient dominion  
than they were amon^ us of New England. In  
several conversations I found more than one  
very cool about Hie appointment of Washing­  
and particularly Mr. Pendleton was very clear  
and full again J it. Full of anxieties concern­  
ing these cou&#x27;usions, and apprehending daily  
that we should hear vem distressing news from  
Boston, I walked with Mr. Samuel Adams in  
the State House yard, for a little exercise and  
fresh air, before the hour of Congress, and  
there represented lo him thc various dangers  
that surrouuded us. He agree to them all, but  
said, &#x27; Whit shall we do ! I answered him, that  
he knew I had taken great pains lo get our  
colleagues to agree upon some plan, that we  
might&quot; be unanimous; but he knew that they  
would pledge themselves lo nothing ; but I was  
determined to lake a step that would compel  
then, and all Hie other members of Congress to  
declare themselves for or against someth.ng.-|

reel motion that Congress should adopt the
