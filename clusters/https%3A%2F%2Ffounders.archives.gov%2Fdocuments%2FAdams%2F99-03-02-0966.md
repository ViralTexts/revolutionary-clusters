s present time in the public funds, say some in one kind, and some in an other; your the task devolved upon you is a difficult one; and must make you very anxious and solicitous; as to real estate, we have not any here which will yeald 2 pr cent—and I know you will endeavour to do for the best;  
In reading the Letters of the late Lord Littleton who you know was a very dissolute and proffligate Character, tho possesst of great tallents, I was Struck with the justness of the following observations, which are so perfectly correct that I cannot refrain transcribing them, in a pennatentiary Letter to a Friend. He says “When I seriously reflect on the miseries of dependance, by what ever name it may be distinguished, I cannot but admire the prudence, and envy the disposition, of those men who preserve themselves above it. I am convinced, that no man can be happy, or honorable, who does not proportionate his expences to the means he possesses: if your creditor is a shoemaker— and you cannot discharge his Bill, whatever your rank may be, he becomes your Master, Superiour; and the moment you put it out of your power to pay a Servant his wages, he becomes your Master. The circumspect use of money, arising, not from any avaricious principle, but from the wise practise of applying means to ends, will keep a man in that state of independence which is the Rock of Life. On that foundation he can stand firm, return the haughty look, smile at the supercilious frown, give truth its due force, and scorn the embroidered lie. Without a liberal prudence, virtue is continually harrassed by Necessity, pleasure has but an interrupted enjoyment, and Life becomes a Chequered Scene of agitation and distress,  
These Sentiments are so conformable to my own feelings, that there is not a superfluity I would not readily relinquish, a convenience I would not curtail; to preserve that independance. Upon t

the phrase is significant that describes the  
man who pays everybody, as abore tIe world, he

The circumspect use of money, arising, not
