 and obligations by which the nation may have bound itself.  
No stipulation however with France obliges us to permit that Nation to equip and man their privateers within the United  
  
States. The manning of privateers or inducing our Citizens to enter on board of them may be considered of the nature of foreign powers inlisting men within the United States which would according to the laws of Nations be an high violation against our sovereignty even to such a degree as to justify a declaration of War unless satisfactory reparation be made—Vattel is explicit upon this subject he says—in Book 3. Chapter 2d Section 15. “As the right of levying soldiers belongs solely to the nation, so no person is to enlist soldiers in a foreign country, without the permission of the sovereign, and even with this permission none but volunteers are to be enlisted; for the service of the Country is out of the question here and no sovereign has a right to give or sell his subjects to another. They who undertake to enlist soldiers in a foreign Country without the sovereign’s permission; and in general, whoever alienates the subjects of another violates one of the most sacred rights both of the prince and the State. It is the crime distinguished by the name of Plagiat or man-stealing, and accordingly is punished with the utmost severity in every policied State. Foreign recruiters are hanged immediately, and very justly, as it is not to be presumed that their sovereign ordered them to commit the crime; and if they did receive such an order they ought not to obey it: their sovereign having no right to command what is contrary to the law of Nature. It is not I say apprehended that these Recruiters act by order of their sovereign and usually they who have practised seduction only, are, if taken severely punished. If they have used violence and made their escape, they are claimed and the men they carried off demanded. But if it appears that they acted by order such a proceeding in a foreign sovereign is justly considered as an injury and as a sufficient cause for declaring war against him, unless he condescends to make suitable reparation.”
