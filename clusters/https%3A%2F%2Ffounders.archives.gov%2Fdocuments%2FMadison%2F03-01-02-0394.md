Charleston S. C. Septr 5th. 1809.  
With great pleasure I obey the orders of my fellow citizens of Charleston in forwarding to you the inclosed copy of the resolutions this day adopted by them. These resolutions were prepared by a large committee indiscriminately appointed and afterwards unanimously adopted by a very numerous assemblage of citizens of different political principles. The disavowal of the late negotiation by the British Ministry though it calls for no gratitude is likely to result in good. It has materially forwarded an extensive association for the promotion of domestic manufactures on a national scale. It has induced a beleif that the failure of past negotiations was not chargeable on the administration of our government—and it has essentially contributed to the union of our citizens. The names of parties which heretofore have prevailed are in a fair way of being exchanged for the honorable appellation of Americans. With the most exalted sentiments of respect and esteem I am your most obedient servant

h Carolina 5th Septr. 1809.  
At a Meeting of the Citizens this day, held in St. Michael’s Church, agreeable to adjournment  
Dr David Ramsay in the chair  
John. S. Cogdell Secretary.  
The Committee appointed at the Meeting of the 29th Ulto. Reported sundry Resolutions, which being read by the Chairman, were unanimously agreed to and are as follow.  
Whereas it appears by the proclamation of the President of the United States, of the 9th. Ulto, that the arrangement lately concluded by him and the Minister of his Britannic Majesty has been disavowed by the Government of the latter tho’ the United States had performed with the utmost promptitude and good faith the Stipulations incumbent on them; in consequence of which the sincere and honourable endeavours of our Government to meet that nation on a footing of Amity and pacification have failed, And all the Evils resulting from their Orders in Council are again visited upon our peaceful and Rightful Commerce under circumstances peculiarly injurious and insulting, while the other numerous Violations of our Neutral Rights and national honour, of which we have so long and so justly complained, remain altogether unredressed.  
And Whereas the arrangement, so happily concluded, contained in the Opinion of this Meeting, no more than this Government was in honour bound to demand, and no more than the Government of Great Britain was in justice obliged to grant and has been rejected by the latter, under pretences as affrontive as they are unjust, It becomes our duty as a free people (among whom public Sentiment Constitutes National Strength) at so important a Crisis to animate and confirm the Resolves of our Rulers and Representatives by an expression of our Confidence and to proclaim to the World, that, breathing this Confidence and united to a Man, in the Love of our inestimable Government and our excellent Constitution, it is our determination to support by every Sacrifice and at every hazard the honour of our Country and the just Rights of a great and Independent people.  
Therefore  
Resolved, That we, the Citizens of Charleston and its Vicinity, of every political denomination in this meeting Assembled, feel the highest indignation and resentment at the manner in which the United States have been treated in the late Negotiation; nor will these feelings be allayed by the belief, that the Conduct of the British Ministry in the transaction, was not characterized by the guilt of perfidy, for the pretences on which they have acted would not therefore cease to be as unjust as they are incompatible with the pride and honour of an Independent Nation.  
Resolved That we have the highest confidence in the Virtue, Ability and prudence of the president of the United States—that we highly approve of the prompt and dignified manner in which he has renewed the Operation of the Nonintercourse Laws and solemnly pledge to him, to Congress and to our Country, our Lives, our fortunes and our sacred honour to support the Government in all the measures, which the Crisis shall demand, tho’ they should subject us to the privations, and involve us in the Calamities of a just and necessary War.  
Resolved that the present alarming situation of our public Affairs demands a Union of all our Citizens—That we will on this point and at this time silence the controversies of party, forget the interests and prejudices of local situation and with a generous emulation strive with each other, who shall best serve the great Cause of our beloved Country.  
Resolved That a copy of the foregoing Resolutions be signed by the Chairman of this Meeting, and transmitted by him to the President of the United States.

At a meeting of the citizens of Charlefion, beldin  
St. Michael’s Church, the sth Sept.agreesble to  
adjournment—Dwv. RAMSAY in the Chair,  
Joan 8. Cocnrry, Secretary, : .  
I&#x27;he Committee appointed at the  
Meeting.of the 2g&#x27;h ult. reported sun­  
dry Resolutions : which being read  
by the Chiirman, were ununimoufly  
agreed to, and are as follow : _  
. WHEREAS - it aprears by “the  
Proclamation of the President of the  
United States of ihe gth ult. that the  
arrangement lately concluded by bim  
and the Miniter of his Britannic Ma­  
jesty, has been disavowed by the gov.  
ernment of the latter] though the U­  
_mited Stares had performed with the  
bttt proaupritude and good faith  
the stipulations incummbent on them ;  
- in comsequence of which, the sincere  
and honorable endeavors of our Gav­  
_ernment to meet that nation on a foot­  
ing of amity and pacification have  
failed, and all the evils resulting from  
their Orders in council are again vis­  
ited upon our peaceful and rightful  
commerce, under circumstances pe­  
caliarly injurious and insulting, while  
the other nomerous violations of our  
neutral rights and national honor, of  
which we have so long and so justly  
complained, remain altogether un.  
redressed : And, whereas, the arrange­  
ment, so hapily concluded, contained  
in the opivion of this meeting, ho  
more than this Government was in  
honor bound to:.demand, and no more  
than the Government of Great Britain  
was in justice obliged to grant, and  
has been reje&amp;ted by the latter, under  
presences as affrontive as they are un­  
ju. Tt becomes our duty, as a Free  
Pcople, {among whem public senti­  
ment constitutes national firength)  
at so importanta crisis, to animage  
and confirm the resolves&#x27;of our rulers  
and representatives, by an exprefflion  
of our confidence, and to proclaim  
to the world, that, breathing this con­  
fidence, and united to a man, in the  
_love of our inestimable Government,  
and our excellent Constitution, itis  
cur determination to support, by ev­  
ery sacrifice and at every hazard, Ihe  
honor of our country, and the just  
rights of a great and independent  
People—~Therefore, &#x27;  
Resolved, That we, the Citizens Of  
ChaMelton and its vicinity, of every  
political denominalion, in this meet­  
ing -aflembled, feel the highest indig­  
natwn and resentment at the manner  
in which the United States have been  
treated in the late Negociation ;5 nor  
will those feelings be allaged by the  
belief, that the conduét of the British  
Ministry in the transadion was not  
charafterized by the guilt of per­  
fily, for the pretences on which they  
have a&amp;ed, would not therefore  
cease to be as unjust, as they are in­  
compatible with the pride and honor  
ot an independent nation. &#x27;  
Resolved, Thar we have the high­  
elt confidence in the virtue,ability and  
prudence of the President of the U­  
- nited States-—that we highly approve  
- of the prompt and digunified manner  
~in which he has renewed the opera­  
tion of the Non Intercourse Laws,  
~ and solemnly pledge to him, ro Con­  
~ grefe, and to our Country, our lives,
