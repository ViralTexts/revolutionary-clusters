I have written to you by triplicates with every remittance I sent to the V.S. &amp; H. and always recapitulated in each letter the objects of the preceding ones. I inclosed in two of them some seeds of the squash as you desired. Send me in return some seeds of the winter vetch, I mean that kind which is sown in autumn and stands thro the cold of winter, furnishing a crop of green fodder in March. Put a few seeds in every letter you may write to me. In England only the spring vetch can be had. Pray fail not in this. I have it greatly at heart.  
The aspect of our politics has wonderfully changed since you left us. In place of that noble love of liberty and republican government which carried us triumphantly thro’ the war, an Anglican, monarchical and aristocratical party has sprung up, whose avowed object is to draw over us the substance as they have already done the forms of the British government. The main body of our citizens however remain true to their republican principles, the whole landed interest is with them, and so is a great mass of talents. Against us are the Executive, the Judiciary, two out of three branches of the legislature, all of the officers of the government, all who want to be officers, all timid men who prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty, British merchants and Americans trading on British capitals, speculators and holders in the banks and public funds a contrivance invented for the purposes of corruption and for assimilating us in all things, to the rotten as well as the sound parts of the British model. It would give you a fever were I to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies, men who were Samsons in the field and Solomons in the council, but who have had their heads shorn by the harlot England. In short we are likely to preserve the liberty we have obtained only by unremitting labors and perils. But we shall preserve them, and our mass of weight and wealth on the good side is so great as to leave no danger that force will ever be attempted against us. We have only to awake and snap the Lilliputian cords with which they have been entangling us during the first sleep which succeeded our labors.—I will forward the testimonial of the death of Mrs. Mazzei which I can do the more incontrove

part of the biographer is, m our opinion, a signal failure. A  
word as to the facts may be necessary for the young, whose  
memories reach not back to the transaction. An Italian, named  
Mazzei, came to this country and lived near Mr. Jefferson; an  
intimacy was formed between them, and continued until the  
return of the foreigner to Tuscany, some time prior to the year  
1796. Onthe 24th of April, in that year, Mr. Jefferson wrote  
to him a letter, in which he used the following language :—*  
  
“ The aspect of our politics has wonderfully changed since you  
left us. In place of that noble love of liberty and republican govern-

Thomas Jefferson, the founder of  
Democracy, wrote the following to a

during his speech at Indianapolis. It  
sounds as if written of the politics of  
today:  
&quot;The aspect of our polities has  
changed wonderfully since you left  
us.&quot; He was writing to a friend who  
had gone abroad. &quot;In place of the  
noble love of liberty and republican  
Government which carried us trium­  
phantly through the war, an Anglican  
party has sprung up, whose avowed  
purpose is to draw as over to the sub­  
stance, as they have already done to  
the forms, of the British Government.  
While the main body of our people re­

potism to the boisterous sea

&quot;The aspect of our politics,&quot; Jeffer­  
son writes, &quot;has wonderfully changed  
since you loft us. In placo of the noble
