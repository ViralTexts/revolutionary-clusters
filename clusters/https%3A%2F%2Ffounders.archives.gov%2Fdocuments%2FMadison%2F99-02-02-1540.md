Your late letter reminds me of our Conversation on the constitutionality of the power in Congs. to impose a  
tariff for the encouragemt. of manufactures; and of my promise to sketch the grounds of the confident opinion I had  
expressed that it was among the powers vested in that Body. I had not forgotten my promise, &amp; had even begun the  
task of fulfilling it; But frequent interruptions from other causes, being followed by a bilious indisposition, I have  
not been able sooner to comply with your request. The subjoined view of the subject, might have been advantageously  
expanded; but I leave that improvement to your own reflections &amp; researches.  
The Constitution vests in Congress, expressly, &quot;the power to lay &amp; collect taxes duties imposts &amp;  
excises&quot;; and &quot;the power to regulate trade&quot;  
That the former power, if not particularly expressed, would have been included in the latter, as one of the  
objects of a general power to regulate trade, is not impugned, as has been alledged, by its being so  
expressed. Examples of this sort, can not sometimes be easily avoided, and are to be seen elsewhere, in the Constitution.  
Thus the power &quot;to define &amp; punish offences agst. the Law of Nations,&quot; includes the power, afterwards particularly  
expressed &quot;to make rules concerning captures &amp;c from offending neutrals.&quot; So also, a power &quot;to coin money&quot; would  
doubtless include that of &quot;regulating its value,&quot; had not the latter power been expressly inserted. The term taxes, if  
standing alone would certainly have included, duties, imposts &amp; excises. In another clause it is said &quot;no tax or  
duty shall be laid on imports &amp;c.&quot; Here the two terms are used as synonymous. And in another clause, where it is  
said &quot;no State shall lay any imposts or duties &amp;c.&quot; the terms imposts &amp; duties are synonymous. Pleonasms,  
tautologies &amp; the promiscuous use of terms &amp; phrases, differing in their shades of meaning, (always to be  
expounded with reference to the context and under the controul, of the general character &amp; manifest scope of the  
Instrument in which they are found) are to be ascribed sometimes to the purpose of greater caution; sometimes to the  
imperfections of language; and sometimes to the imperfection of man, himself. In this view of the subject, it was quite  
natural, however certainly the general power to regulate trade might include a power to impose duties on it, not to omit  
it in a clause enumerating the several modes of revenue authorised by the Constitution. In few cases could the ’ex majori  
cautela’ occur with more claim to respect.  
Nor can it be inferred, as has been ingeniously attempted, that a power to regulate trade does not involve a  
power to tax it, from the distinction made in the original controversy with G. Britain, between a power to regulate trade  
with the Colonies, &amp; a power to tax them. A power to regulate trade between different parts of the Empire, was  
confessedly necessary; and was admitted to lie as far as that was the case in the British  
Parliament the taxing part being at the same time denied to the Parliament, &amp; asserted to be necessarily inherent in  
the Colonial Legislatures, as sufficient &amp; the only safe depositories of the taxing power. So difficult was it  
nevertheless to maintain the distinction in practice, that the ingredient of revenue was occasionally overlooked or  
disregarded in the British regulations; as in the duty on sugar &amp; molasses imported into the Colonies. And it was  
fortunate that the attempt at an internal and direct tax in the case of the Stampt Act, produced a radical examination of  
the subject, before a regulation of trade with a view to revenue had grown into an established authority. One thing at  
least is certain, that the main &amp; admitted object of the Parliamentary regulations of trade  
with the Colonies, was the encouragement of Manufactures in G. B  
But the present question is unconnected, with the former relations between G. B. and her Colonies, which were  
of a peculiar, a complicated, and, in several respects, of an undefined character. It is a simple question under the  
Constitution of the U. S. whether &quot;the power to regulate trade with foreign nations&quot; as a distinct &amp; substantive  
item in the enumerated powers embraces the object of encouraging by duties, restrictions and prohibitions the  
manufactures &amp; products of the Country? And the affirmative must be inferred from the following considerations:  
1. The meaning of the phrase &quot;to regulate trade&quot; must be sought in the general use of it, in other words in  
the objects to which the power was generally understood to be applicable, when the phrase was inserted in the Constn.  
2. The power has been understood and used by all commercial &amp; manufacturing nations as embracing the  
object of encouraging manufactures. It is believed that not a single exception can be named.  
3. This has been particularly the case with G. B. whose commercial vocabulary is the parent of ours. A  
primary object of her commercial regulations is well known to have been the protection and encouragement of her  
manufactures.  
4. Such was understood to be a proper use of the power by the States most prepared for manufacturing  
industry, whilst retaining the power over their foreign trade. It was the aim of Virginia herself, as will presently  
appear, tho’ at the time among the least prepared for such a use of her power to regulate trade.  
5. Such a use of the power by Congs, accords with the intention and expectation of the States in  
transferring the power over trade, from themselves to the Govt. of the U. S. This was emphatically the case in the  
Eastern, the more manufacturing members of the Confederacy. Hear from p. 84.86.136. of the origl. edition. the language held in the Convention of Massts.  
By Mr. Dawes, an advocate for the Constitution, it was observed, &quot;Our manufactures are another great subject  
which has recd no encouragement by national duties on foreign manufactures, and they never can by any authority in the old  
Confedn.&quot; Again &quot;If we wish to encourage our own manufactures, to preserve our own commerce, to  
raise the value of our own lands, we must give Congs. the powers in question.&quot;  
By Mr. Widgery, an opponent, &quot;All we hear is, that the mercht. &amp; farmer will flourish, &amp; that  
the mechanic &amp; tradesman are to make their fortunes directly, if the Constitution goes down.&quot;  
The Convention of Massts. was the only one in N. Engd. whose debates have been preserved. But it can not be  
doubted that the sentiment there expressed was common to the other States in that quarter, more especially to Connecticut  
and Rh Isld., the most thickly peopled of all the States, and having of course their thoughts most turned to the subject  
of manufactures. A like inference may be confidently applied to N. Jersey, whose debates in Convention have not been  
preserved. In the populous and manufacturing State of Pa., a partial account only of the debates having been published,  
nothing certain is known of what passed in her Convention on this point. But ample evidence may be found elsewhere, that  
regulations of trade for the encouragement of manufactures, were considered as within the power to be granted to the new  
Congress, as well as within the scope of the national policy. Of the States South of Pena., the only two in whose  
Conventions the debates have been preserved are Virga. and N. Carola. and from these no adverse inferences can be drawn,  
whilst sufficient proofs were otherwise given that the power in question, was understood by Virga. to be within the  
purview of a Constitutional Reform: And with respect to N. C destined as she was by her less commercial position to become  
a manufacturing State, and liable moreover to be taxed by the commercial regulations of her neighbors, whatever might be  
the object of the tax, she could not but have concurred in the anticipation of a transfer from the States to the U. S. of  
the Commercial power as well in its relation to manufactures, as in its other relations. Nor is there the slightest  
indication that either of the two States farthest South, where the debates in Convention if preserved have not been made  
public, viewed the encouragement of manufactures as not within the general power over trade to be transferred to the Govt.  
of the U. S.  
6 If Congress have not the power it is annihilated for the nation; a policy without example in any other  
nation, and not within the reason of the solitary one in our own. The example alluded to is the prohibition of a tax on  
exports which resulted from the apparent impossibility of raising in that mode a revenue from the States proportioned to  
the ability to pay it: the ability of some being derived in a great measure, not from their exports, but from their  
fisheries, from their freights and from commerce at large, in some of its branches altogether external to the U. S.: the  
profits from all which being invisible &amp; intangible would escape a tax on exports. A tax on imports, on the other  
hand, being a tax on consumption which is in proportion to the ability of the consumers whencesoever derived was free from  
that inequality.  
7. If revenue be the sole object of a legitimate impost, and the encouragt. of domestic articles be not within  
the power of regulating trade it wd. follow that no monopolizing or unequal regulations of foreign Nations could be  
counteracted: that neither the staple articles of subsistence nor the essential implements for the public safety could  
under any circumstances be ensured or fostered at home by regulations of commerce, the usual &amp; most convenient mode of  
providing for both, and that the American navigation, tho the source of naval defence, of a cheapening competition in  
carrying our valuable &amp; bulky articles to market, and of an independent carriage of them during foreign wars, when a  
foreign navigation might be withdrawn, must be at once abandoned or speedily destroyed: it being evident that a tonnage  
duty merely in foreign ports agst. our vessels, and an exemption from such a duty in our ports in favor of foreign  
vessels, must have the inevitable effect of banishing ours from the Ocean.  
To assume a power to protect our navigation, &amp; the cultivation &amp; fabrication of all articles  
requisite for the public safety, as incident to the war power would be a more latitudinary construction of the text of the  
Constitution, than to consider it as embraced by the specified power to regulate trade; a power which has been exercised  
by all nations for those purposes; and which effects those purposes with less of interference with the authority and  
conveniency of the States, than might result from internal &amp; direct modes of encouraging the articles, any of  
which modes would be authorized as far as deemed &quot;necessary &amp; proper,&quot; by considering the power as an incidental power.  
8 That the encouragement of Manufactures, was an object of the power to regulate trade, is proved by the use  
made of the power for that object, in the first Session of the first Congress under the Constitution; when among the  
members present were so many who had been members of the federal Convention which framed the Constitution, and of the  
State Conventions which ratified it; each of these classes consisting also of members who had opposed &amp; who had  
espoused, the Constitution in its actual form. It does not appear from the printed proceedings of Congress on that  
occasion that the power was denied by any of them. And it may be remarked that members from Virga. in particular, as well  
of the antifederal as the federal party, the names then distinguishing those who had opposed and those who had approved  
the Constitution, did not hesitate to propose duties, &amp; to suggest even prohibitions in favor of several Articles  
of her production; By one a duty was proposed on Mineral Coal, in favor of the Virginia Coal Pits; by another a duty on  
Hemp was proposed to encourage the growth of that article; and by a third a prohibition even of foreign Beef, was  
suggested as a measure of sound policy. [See Lloyd’s Debates.]  
A further evidence in support of the Constl. power to protect &amp; foster manufactures by regulations of  
trade, an evidence that ought of itself to settle the question, is the uniform &amp; practical sanction given to the power,  
by every Ex: Legisl: &amp; Judy. Branch of the Genl. Govt. for nearly 40 years; with a concurrence or acquiescence of  
every State Govt. in all its Branches, throughout the same period; and it may be added thro’ all the vicissitudes of party,  
which marked the period. No novel construction, however ingeniously devised, or however respectable and patriotic its  
patrons, can withstand the weight of such authorities, or the unbroken current of so prolonged &amp; universal a  
practice. And well it is that this can not be done, without the intervention of the same authority which made the  
Constitution. If it could be so done, there would be an end of that stability in Govt. and in Laws, which is essential to  
good Govt. &amp; good Laws; a stability the want of which is the imputation which has at all times been levelled agst.  
Republicanism with most effect by its most dextrous adversaries. The imputation ought never therefore to be countenanced,  
by innovating constructions, without any plea of a precipitancy or a paucity of the constructive precedents they oppose;  
without any appeal to material facts newly brought to light; and without any claim to a better knowledge of the original  
evils &amp; inconveniencies, for which remedies were needed, the very best of keys to the true object &amp; meaning of all laws  
&amp; constitutions.  
And may it not be fairly left to the unbiassed judgment of all men of experience, &amp; of intelligence,  
to decide which is most to be relied on for a sound and safe test of the meaning of a Constitution, a uniform  
interpretation by all the successive authorities under it, commencing with its birth, and continued for a long period,  
thro’ the varied state of political contests; or the opinion of every new Legislature heated as it may be by the strife of  
parties, or warped as often happens by the eager pursuit of some favorite object, or carried away possibly by the powerful  
eloquence, or captivating address of a few popular Statesmen, themselves influenced, perhaps, by the same misleading  
causes. If the latter test is to prevail, every new Legislative opinion might make a new Constitution; as the foot of  
every new Chancellor would make a new standard of measure.  
It is seen with no little surprize, that an attempt has been made, in a highly respectable quarter, and at  
length reduced to a resolution formally proposed in Congress, to substitute for the power of Congs. to regulate trade so  
as to encourage manufactures, a power in the several States to do so, with the consent of that Body; and this expedient is  
derived from a clause in the 10. Sect of Art: 1. of the Const: which says no State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay  
any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws;  
and the net produce of all duties and imposts, laid by any State on imports and exports, shall be for the use of the  
Treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of Congress.&quot;  
To say nothing of the clear indications in the Journal of the Convention of 1787. that the clause was intended  
merely to provide for expences incurred by particular States in their Inspection laws, and in such improvements as they  
might chuse to make in their Harbours &amp; rivers with the sanction of Congs. objects to which the reserved power has  
been applied in several instances, at the request of Virginia &amp; of Georgia, how could it ever be imagined that any  
State would wish to tax its own trade for the encouragement of manufactures, if possessed of the authority, or could, in  
fact do so, if wishing it?  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its own consumption; and the nett proceeds going, according to the clause,  
not into its own treasury, but into the treasury of the U. S. the State would tax itself separately for the equal gain of  
all the other States; and as far as the manufactures so encouraged might succeed in ultimately increasing the Stock in  
Market, and lowering the price by competition, this advantage also, procured at the sole expence of the State, would be  
common to all the others.  
But the very suggestion of such an expedient to any State would have an air of mockery, when its experienced impracticability is taken into view. No one who recollects or recurs to the period  
when the power over Commerce was in the individual States, &amp; separate attempts were made to tax or otherwise  
regulate it, need be told that the attempts were not only abortive, but by demonstrating the necessity of general  
&amp; uniform regulations gave the original impulse to the Constitutional reform which provided for such regulations.  
To refer a State therefore to the exercise of a power as reserved to her by the Constitution, the  
impossibility of exercising which was an inducement to adopt the Constitution, is of all remedial devices the last that  
ought to be brought forward. And what renders it the more extraordinary is that, as the tax on commerce as far as it could  
be separately collected, instead of belonging to the treasury of the State as previous to the Constn. would be a tribute  
to the U. S: the State would be in a worse condition, after the adoption of the Constitution, than before, in relation to  
an important interest, the improvement of which was a particular object in adopting the Constitution.  
Were Congress to make the proposed declaration of  
consent to state tariffs in favor of State manufactures, and the permitted attempts did not defeat themselves, what would  
be the situation of States deriving their foreign supplies through the ports of other States? It is evident that they  
might be compelled to pay, in their consumption of particular articles imported, a tax for the common treasury, not common  
to all the States, without having any manufacture or product of their own, to partake of the contemplated benefit.  
Of the impracticability of separate regulations of trade, &amp; the resulting necessity of general  
regulations, no State was more sensible than Virga. She was accordingly among the most earnest for granting to Congress a  
power adequate to the object. On more occasions than one in the proceedings of her Legislative Councils, it was recited,  
&quot;that the relative situation of the States, had been found on trial, to require uniformity in their comercial regulations as the only effectual  
policy for obtaining in the ports of foreign nations a stipulation of privileges reciprocal to those enjoyed by the  
subjects of such nations in the ports of the U. S.; for preventing animosities which can not fail to arise among the  
several States from the interference of partial &amp; separate regulations; and for deriving  
from comerce such aids to the public revenue as it ought, to contribute &amp;c.&quot; [see ]  
During the delays &amp; discouragts. experienced in the attempts to invest Congs. with the necessary  
powers, the State of Virga made various trials of what could be done by her individual laws. She ventured on duties  
&amp; imposts as a source of Revenue; Resolutions were passed at one time to encourage &amp; protect her own  
navigation &amp; Ship-building; and in consequence of complaints &amp; petitions from Norfolk, Alexa. &amp; other  
places agst. the monopolizing navigation laws of G. B. particularly in the trade between the U.  
S. &amp; the British W. Indies, she deliberated with a purpose controuled only by the inefficacy of  
separate measures, on the experiment of forcing a reciprocity by prohibitory regulations of her own. [See Journal of H. of  
Delegates in 1785]  
The effect of her separate attempts to raise revenue by duties on imports, soon appeared in Representations  
from her Merchts. that the commerce of the State was banished by them into other channels, especially of Maryd. where  
imports were less burdened than in Virga. [See Do. for 1786.]  
Such a tendency of separate regulations was indeed too manifest to escape anticipation. Among the projects  
prompted by the want of a federal authy. over Comerce, was that of a concert, first proposed on the part of Maryd,  
for a uniformity of regulations between the 2 States, and commissioners were appointed for that purpose. It was soon  
perceived however that the concurrence of Pena. was as necesy to Maryd. as of Maryd. to Virga. and the concurrence of  
Pennsylvania was accordingly invited. But Pa. could no more concur witht. N. Y. than Md. witht. Pa, nor N. Y. witht. the  
concurrence of Boston &amp;c  
These projects were superseded for the moment by that of the Convention at Annapolis in 1786, and forever by  
the Convn. at Pha. in 1787. and the Constn. which was the fruit of it.  
There is a passage in Mr. Neckars work on the finances of France which affords a signal illustration of the  
difficulty of collecting, in contiguous communities, indirect taxes when not the same in all, by the violent means  
resorted to against smuggling from one to another of them. Previous to the late revolutionary war in that Country, the  
taxes were of very different rates in the different Provinces; particularly the tax on Salt which was high in the interior  
provinces &amp; low in the maritime; and the tax on Tobacco, which was very high in general whilst in some of the  
provinces the use of the article was altogether free. The consequence was that the standing Army of Patrols agst.  
smuggling, had swoln to the number of twenty three thousand; the annual arrests of men women &amp; children engaged in  
smuggling, to five thousand five hundred &amp; fifty; and the number annually arrested on account of Salt &amp; Tobacco  
alone, to seventeen or eighteen hundred, more than three hundred of whom were consigned to the terrible punishment of the  
Gallies.  
May it not be regarded as among the providential blessings to these States, that their geographical  
relations multiplied as they will be by artificial channels of intercourse, give such additional force to the many  
obligations to cherish that Union which alone secures their peace, their safety, and their prosperity. Apart from the more  
obvious &amp; awful consequences of their entire separation into Independent Sovereignties, it is worthy of special  
consideration, that divided from each other as they must be by narrow waters &amp; territorial lines merely, the  
facility of surreptitious introductions of contraband articles would defeat every attempt at revenue in the easy and  
indirect modes of impost and excise; so that whilst their expenditures would be necessarily &amp; vastly increased by  
their new situation, they would, in providing for them, be limited to direct taxes on land or other property, to arbitrary  
assessments on invisible funds, &amp; to the odious tax on persons.  
You will observe that I have confined myself, in what has been said to the constitutionality &amp;  
expediency of the power in Congress to encourage domestic products by regulations of commerce. In the exercise of the  
power, they are responsible to their Constituents, whose right &amp; duty it is, in that as in all other cases, to  
bring their measures to the test of justice &amp; of the general Good.

Montfpelekh, September 18, 1828.  
Deah Sih: Your late letter remind* me of  
i our conversatinn on the constitutionality of the  
| power in Congress to impose 3 tariff for the  
| encouragement of manufactures; and of mv pi o*  
mise to sketch the grounds of the confident o­  
pinion l had expressed, that it was among the  
powers vested in that body. I had not forgot­  
ten my promise, and had even begun the task  
of fulfilling it; but frequent interruptions, from  
• other causes, b-fing fallowed by a bilious indis­  
! position, I have not been able sooner to com­  
ply with your request. I he subjoined view of  
j the subject might have been advantageously  
j expand d; but 1 leave tha» improvement to your  
own reflections and researches.  
I&#x27;he Constitution vests in Congress, exptess­  
I ly “the power to lay and coder t taxes, duties,  
&#x27; imposts, and excises;” and “the power to regu­  
late trade.”  
That the former power, if not particularly  
I expr» ssed, would have been included in the lat­  
! ter as one of the objects of a geneial power to  
&#x27; regulate tiade; is not necessarily impugned by  
i its being so expressed. Examples ot this sort  
! cannot sometimes be tasily a&#x27;oidtd, anti are to  
! be seen elsewhere in the Constitution. 1 bus  
I the power ;‘to define and punish ufft-nces against  
! the law of nations,” includes the power, after­  
wards pat ticularly expressed, “to make rules  
i conreruing captures, See. from off tiding neu -  
trals.” “So also a pouer “to &lt; oin mon*y”  
would doubdesi include that ol “reguljting i s  
value,” had not the latter power been express­  
ly inseited. The term t„xes, if standing alone,  
would certainly base included duties, imposts,  
and ex&lt; ises. In another clause it is said; “no  
tax or duties shall be laid on exports, &amp;c.”—  
Here the two terms are used as synonymous.—  
And in another clause, where it is said no State  
shall lay any imposts, or du&#x27;tes, See the terms  
imposts and duties are synonymous Picon­  
-.•it-.,&lt; t-.i.t.it/-&gt;cvi&lt;&gt;« nnrl lh(&gt; nintllisrUollS i:SC of  
  
terms and phrase*, differing in their shades of  
mooli&#x27; g. (always in hr &lt;x ounded with refer*  
ence to the context and under thecontr.il of ttie  
general character and manifest scope «»f ti c in­  
strument in which they are found)are *u be as­  
cribed, sometimes to the purpose of greater  
caution; somriinn s to : he imperfections of lan­  
guage. Scsonn times &gt;o the imperfection of man  
hnuself. In this \i&lt; w of ttie subje-t, it wes  
quite natural, however certainly the general  
power to regulate iracte might include a power  
to impose duties on it, not loomit it in a clause  
enumerating the several modes of revenue, au  
thorised by the Consii&#x27;ution. In few ca*es  
could the “ex m.ijori cautcla” occur wi h ttioie  
claim to respect.  
N- r can t» be inferred; that a power to regu­  
b e trade does not tnvolve a powei to tax it.  
♦ rum the distinction made in the original con­  
troversy with Great Britain, between a power  
to regulate trade with the Colonies, and a pnw­  
- er to u-.x ihem A power to regulate trade bc­  
I tween different parts of the Empire, was eon­  
j f. ssediy necessary; and was admitted 10 lie, as  
i far as »hit was tBe case, in he Bnttsli Parlia­  
: nit ill; the taxing part being a’ the same lime  
! denitvl io ibe Parliament, and asseried to be ne­  
cessarily inherent in the Colot.id Legislatures  
as suflir ien&lt;, and the oidy safe depositories of  
the taxing power. So difficult was it, ncveithe­  
less, toman tain the distinction in practice,that  
the ingredie •» of re&gt;enu*- wa&gt; occasionally ov­  
erlooked 01 disregarded in the British rcgula­  
| lions, as in the duty on sugar a&#x27;ul molasses im­  
; potted into the Colonies. Audit was fortu­  
j na&#x27;r that the attempt at an iirerna! and direct  
j tax, in the case of the Stamp Act, proc.ucid a  
.adicul cxjinina&#x27;ion of the subject before a re­  
j gulation of trade wi&#x27;h a view io revenue had  
. grown into an established au&#x27;hniiiy. One thing  
I jt least is certain, that the main and aduited  
i ohj-ct of the Parliamentary regulations of trade |  
1 wi&#x27;h the Colonies, was the rnconragi meut of j  
&#x27; i&lt;f mu las lures in Grra&#x27; Britain.  
But tin- piesrn: question is unconnected with &#x27;  
ilie former relations between G&#x27;eat B i&#x27;ain and 1  
her colonies, which were of a peculiar, a com j  
plira&#x27;ed, and in several re*pec:*, ot an undefi.i- ,  
ed ch.ttacter. 1. is a simple qu. stion ai der t. e !  
C ns&#x27;itmion of the United Mr* s. &quot;he her “the!  
power to rrgula&#x27;e trade ni&#x27;h f »reign nations” j  
as a distinct and substantatiur iuon in he enu- j  
meratrd powers enibrar.es the object of encour- j  
airinir bv duties, restrictions and nr-&gt;htbi&lt;ions. i  
  
the manufactures and products ol tlie country? j  
And the affirmative must be infc-.ied fiom the  
following «onsiderutions  
1. I&#x27;he nv uning the jfhrase“to regulate  
trade,” muM be soug: t in the gen-tal um* &lt; I t;  
in other wor !s, in th obj.-cts &lt;o which th** povv-1  
er was generally understood to be applicable j  
w li n the phrase was insertetl in tin Constitu* j  
ion.  
2 The power hns been understood ami used  
by .ill commercial and nianuf.ir&#x27;uring nations,  
as em &gt;racing hr object of encouraging munu­  
factures. 1! is belies id &#x27;Hat not a single ixct-p  
tion can he named.  
3. This has beer, particularly the case with ;  
Great Britain, whose commercial vocabulary j  
is the paren- of .ms. A primary object of her!  
commercial regulations iswtll known to have j  
been rlie protection and encouragement of her f  
rn inufictures.  
4. Such was understood to be a proper use  
of tne powet hv the S atr» most prepared for  
manufacturing industry, whilst retaining the  
power over their foreign trade.  
5. Such a use of ihi power, b£ Congress,  
accords wt’h the intention ai d rxpec&#x27;ati m ol j  
the States, in transferring the power over tiade I  
from themselves to tie Government of the Un- i  
ited St at. s. This was etnpha&#x27;icahy the case 1  
in the Eastern, th*- more manufacturing Mi m  
b**rs of the Confederacy IGar the language  
hep! in the Convention of Massachusetts  
By Mr. Dawes, an ad&#x27;.ocate for the Constitu- j !  
tion, it was obse.ved, “Our manufactures ai»-i.  
“ anoth* r gr*-at subject which has teceived no i i  
“ encout agi mi nt by national duties on foreign h  
&#x27;* manufactures, and thev never i an by any au- &#x27; i  
“ thori&#x27;v in me old Confederatt .n.” Again. If ,  
w« wish to incourage our oicn manufactures. to ,  
* Jirestrv. our own commerce, to tais* the &#x27; j  
‘ lue of our own lands, we must give Congress &lt;  
‘ the powers in question.” I  
Bv Mr. Widgriy, an opponent; “All we hear v  
* is, that the merchant and farmer wil; fl &gt;urish s  
‘ and that the mechanic and tradesman are to f  
  
“ make tlxir fotiunes directly, ike Constitu­  
44 lion goes down.”  
The Convention in Mas&#x27;achusrts was the  
only one in New fin gland whose debates have  
been preserved. But it cannot be doubted that  
[ the sentiment there expressed was common tj&gt;  
i the other Stales in that quarter, more especial­  
ly to Connecticut and Rhode Island, the most  
, ickly peopled ol all the States, and having,  
of course, their thoughts most turned to-the  
subject of manufactures. A like inference  
may be confidently applied to New Jersey,  
whose debates in Convention have not been  
preserved. In t&#x27;.s populous and manufacturing  
S 3&#x27;c of Pennsylvania, a partial account only of  
the debates having been published, nothing  
crriiin is known of what passed in hrr Con­  
vention on this point. But ample evidence  
may be found elsewhere, that regulations ol  
trade, lor the encouragement of manufactures,  
were considered as within the power to lx  
graired to the new Congiess, as well as within  
the scope of the national policy. Of the Suits  
South of Pennsylvania, the only two in whose  
Conventions the debates hate been preserved  
are Virginia and North Carolina, and worn  
these no advtrse inferences can v e drawn Nor  
is there the slightest indication that ci her of  
the two States farthest South, whose debates in  
Conven&#x27;ion, if preserved, have not been made  
public, viewed the enpoutagement of manufac­  
tures, as not within the general power ov,-r  
trade to be trat sfei red to the Government of the  
United Mates  
6. If t&#x27;onuress have not the power, tt is an­  
nihilated for the nation; a policy without ex  
ample in anv other nation, and not within the  
reason of the solitary one in our own. 1 he  
example alluded to, is the prohibition of a tax  
on cxports, which resulted from the apparent  
impossibility ol raising in that mode, a revenue  
from the States, proportioned to the ability to  
pay it —the ability or some being derived, in a  
&#x27; ... r.. tlmir nortS. but flOOl  
  
their fi-hcrirs, from their freights, and from  
commerce at large, in some of i s branches al­  
together external to the United&quot;States; the pi o­  
fiis front all which, being invisible and intan­  
gible. would i scape a tax, on exports. A tax  
on imports on the other hand, bring a tax  
• n consumption, which is in proportion to  
the ability of th- consumers, whencesoever de­  
rived, was lr&lt;‘e from that inequality.  
7. If revenue hr the so&#x27;t* object of a legiti­  
mate impost, and the encouragement ol domes­  
tic articles he not within the powt r of regulat­  
ing trade, it would follow that no monopolizing  
or unequal regulations ol foreign nations rouid  
be &lt; ounteracted; that neither the staple articles  
of subsistence, nor the essential implements for  
i the public safety,could,under any cttcunvs&#x27;anc­  
es, be insured &lt; r fostered at home, by regula­  
tions of commerce, the usual and m«&#x27;S&#x27; conve­  
nient mode of providing for both, and that the  
! American navigation, though the source of  
J naval defence, or a cheapening competi ion in  
j carrying our valuable and bu&#x27;ky arti&lt;1e- to  
! market, and ofan independent carriage of them  
• during foreign wars, when a foreign navigation  
j might be withdrawn, must he at once abandon­  
led, or speedily destroyed: it being evident that  
. a tonnagf duty in f re.gn ports against «&gt;ur  
vessels, ami an exemption from -urh a duty in  
our porij, in favor of &gt;or« ign vess-ls, must have  
the inevitable effect ol banishing ours from the  
ocean.  
I To assunvp a power&#x27;o protpet our naviga­  
tion, and the cultivation and fabrication of all  
articles requisite for the public safety, as inci­  
dent to the war power would be a more la»i­  
tudmary construction of the text of the Consti  
tulion, than to consider it as embraced by the  
specifi cl power to regula&#x27;e trade; a power  
which has been exercised by all nation- for  
those purposes, and which . ffects those purpos­  
es with less of inlet ft re nee vvi&#x27;h tite author ity  
and convenient-y of he Stan s. than might re­  
sult from internal and direct modes of encou­  
raging the a tides, any of which nurd&#x27;s would  
he authorized, as far as deemed ‘‘necessary and  
proper,” by considering the power as an inci­  
dental power.  
8. That the encouragement of manufactures  
vv js an object of the power to regulate trade, is  
pioved by tin use made oT the power lor that ob­  
ject. in the first session of the First Congress  
under the Constitution; when among the mem­  
bers present were so many who had been mem­  
bers of the Federal Convention Wiich fr,im»d  
the Constitution, and ol the State Conventions j  
  
which raiifiid it; each ol these classes consist-i  
ing also of members who had opposed and who [  
had espoused, ti e Constitution in its actual  
f rm It does not appear frt m the printed  
proce dings of Congiess on that o&lt; casion, tha&lt;  
the power was denied hy any of them. And  
ti may he remarked, that Members from Vir­  
ginia, in partirular, as well of the anti-federal I  
as the federal party, tlie names then distin­  
guishing those who had opposed and those who  
hud approved theConstitution.did not hesitate to  
propose dudes and to suggest even prohibitions  
in fa&#x27;orof several at tides of her production.  
Bv one a duiy was proposed on mineral coal,  
in favor of the Virginia coal pits; by another, a  
duty on hemp was proposed, to encourage the  
growth of that ar:*cle; and by a tbiid, a ptohi  
in ion even offqrcign href was suggested, as a  
measure of sound policy. [See Lloyd’s De­  
bates ]  
A further evidence in support of the consti­  
lu’ions I power .to protect and foster manufac­  
ivrct by (emulations of tiade, an evidence that 1  
ought of itself, to settle the question, is the u- I  
niiorm and practical sanction given to the pnw  
m-, by the General Government, for nearly for­  
iy years, with a concurrence or acquiescence  
_&gt;f every Stair G. vernment, throughout -the  
iime petit.d; and, it may be added, thiough I  
ill ti.r vici-siludcs of party which marked the 1  
oeriod. No novel construction, however inge- :  
liouslv devis&#x27;d, .r however respectable and 1  
)air.ntic its patrons, can withstand the weight I  
•f such authorities, or the unbroken current of  
.o prolonged and untvetsal a practice. And )  
veil it is that this cannot be done, without the ’  
ntervenuon of the same au’hority which made t  
he Constitution. If it could be so done, there I  
could he an end to that stability in Govern- *  
ni-nt; and in Laws, which is essential to good I  
:uvernm&lt;-m and good laws, a stability, the want a  
if which is the imputation whi« h has at alii i  
imes been leveln-d against Republicanism,11  
kills must effect, by its most dexterous adver- , c  
dries. The imputation ought never, there- c  
ore, to be countenanced, by innovating con-j /  
  
at ructions, without any plea of a precipitancy  
or paucity of the conductive precedent hey  
oppose; without ,nv appeal to material facts  
newlv brought to light; and witnout any claim  
,o a better knowledge of the original evils and  
inconveniences, for which remedies were need­  
ed, the very best keys to the true object and  
meaning -f all laws and constitutions  
And may it not be fairly left to the unbias­  
sed judgement of all men of experience and or  
intelligence, to decide, whit his most to be  
relied on for a sound and safe test of the mean­  
ing of a Constitution, a uniform interpretation  
by all the successive authorities under n,  
comment ing with its birth, ami continued foi  
a long period, through the varied state or po­  
litical contests; or the opinion of every new  
Legislature, hca ed as it may be by the strife  
of parties—or warped, as often huppens, by the  
eager pursuit of some favoiite object—or car­  
ried away, possibly, by the powerful eloquence  
or captivating address of a few popular states­  
j men,&#x27;themselves, perhaps, influenced by the  
j same misleading cause--? If the latter test is  
j to prevail, every new cgisla ive opinun might  
j make a new Constitution, as the foot of every  
| new Chancellor-would make a new standard ol  
! measute.  
■ It is seen, with no little surprise, that an at­  
tempt has been made, in a highly respectable  
quarter, and at length reduced to a resolution,  
formally proposed in Congress, to substitute,  
for the power of Congiess to regulate trade so  
as to enrourage manufactures, a power in the  
several States to do so, with the consent of that  
body; and this expedient is derived from a  
clause in the tenth section of article first of the  
Constitution, which says: ** No Stale shall,  
without the consent of Congress, lay any im­  
posts or duties on import# or exports, except  
what may be absoint* lv necessary for executing  
its inspection laws, and the net produce ol all  
du ies, and impos s, laid by any State on im­  
noris or exports shall bo for the use of the  
  
! Trrasut y of the Unied States; and all such  
| laws shall he subj-ct to the revision and con­  
&#x27; trol of the Congress.”  
To say nothing of the clear indica&#x27;ions in the  
! Journal of the Convention of 1787 that the  
cIjus&#x27; was intend* d men Iv to pruvide for ex­  
penses incurred by particular Stales, in thrir  
Inspection l.wa, and in such improvement as  
they might choose to make in their harbors and  
river&quot;, wi&#x27;li the sanction of Congress—objects  
to which the reset v« d power has been applied,  
in several instances, at the request of Virginia  
and Geotitia —how rould it ever he imagined  
that any St te would wish to tax its own trade  
for tlie encouragement of ma&quot;ofactures, if ;&gt;i s­  
sessed of the authority, ot could in fact, do so, if  
wishing it?  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its own  
| consumption; and the net proceeds going, nr­  
rording to &#x27;he clause, not into its own Ireasu­  
ry, but in&#x27;o &#x27;he Treasury of the United States,  
the State would ax itself sep&gt;rat»ly for the  
equal gain ol all the other Stat. *; and js far as  
the manufactures so encouraged, might sue  
c- ed ill ultimately tnrrea-ing the stock in mar­  
ket, and lowering the price bv competition, this  
advantage, also, procured at the sole expense  
of the Slate, would be common to all the oth­  
ers.  
Hut the very suggestion of such .n expedient  
to any State, would ha»e an air of mockery,  
! when its experienced impracticability is tak- n  
into view. No one, who recollects or recuis  
to the period when the power over commerce  
was in the individual States, and separate at  
tempts were made to tax, or otherwise regulate  
i», need be told &#x27;hat the attempts were not only  
abortive, but, by demonstrating the necessity of  
general and unifmtn regulations, gave the ori­  
ginal impulse to the constitutional reform which  
provided fur such regulations.  
To refer a State, therefore, to the exercise of  
a power, as reserved to her by the Constitution,  
the impossibility of exercising which was an  
inducement to adopt the Constitution, is, of all  
remedial devices, the last that ought to hr  
brought forvvaid. And what renders it the  
more extraordinary, is, that, as the tax on com­  
merce, as far as it cou!:J be Separately collec­  
t&#x27;d, instead of belonging to the Treasury of the  
state, as previous to the Constitution, would  
be a tiibutc to the United States, the State  
  
wouki iic in u wui w lumuu&#x27;Mi, «nrr uir atioij*  
tioti of tlit* Constitution, than before, in teftr­  
ence to an important in&#x27;crrsi,th&lt; improvement  
of which was a particular object in adopting  
the Constitution  
Were Congress to makr the pioposrd der|a­  
ra&#x27;ion of consent to sta e tariffs in favor of State  
manufartnres, and the permitted aiwtnpu did  
nut defeat themselves, what would be&#x27;the situ­  
ation of States deriving their f.»reign supplies  
through the ports of other Slates? It is evi­  
dent that they might be comptlled to pay, in  
their consumption of particular articles import­  
ed, a tax for the common treasury, not common  
to all the Statrs, without having any manufac­  
ture or product of their own, to partake of the  
contemplated benefit.  
Of the impracticability of separate regula­  
tions of trade, and the resulting necessity of  
general tegula ions, no State was more sensible  
than Virginia. She was accordingly, among  
he most earnest for granting to Congress a i  
power adequate to Hit* object. On more occa- j  
dons than one in the proceedings of her Legis  
lative councils it was recited &quot;that the relative I  
utuation of the States hod been found on trial, j  
to r. quire unifonnity in their commercial regu­  
lations as tiu only i ffectual policy for obtaining  
n the ports of foreign nations a stipulation of  
privileges recipiocal to those enjoyed by the  
mhjecis of such nations in the ports of tht U.  
states for preventing animosities which cannot  
ail to arise among the several states from the in  
t rf-fence of partial and sepvra&#x27;e regulations­  
ind for deriving fium commerce such aids to  
he public revenue as it ought to contribute ”  
icc.  
During the delays and discouragements ex­  
&gt;pi fenced in the attempts to invest Congress  
ri&lt;h the necessary powers, the State of Vngi­  
lia made various trials of what could be done  
,v her individual laws. She ventured on du­  
ies and imposis ai a source of revenue: Keso­  
jtions were pissed at one time to encourage  
nd protect her own navigation and ship build­  
„g; anc* in consequence of complaints and pe­  
Itions from Norfolk, Alexandria,and other p|a- 1  
e., against the monopolizing navigation law,

&#x27; delphia in 1757, and &#x27;.he Cons iiution which !  
1 was the. fruit of it.  
! There is a passage in Mr. Xerk.-t’, w ukou I  
the finances of Frame which affords a siijtd ,U 1  
lustra ion of the difficulty of collerting, in 1 ,n­  
tiguous communities, indirect taxes, vvlminoi  
the same in all, by the vioient means r-sored  
to ag&amp;inst smuggling from one to anotlie. f  
«hem Previous to the late Revolutionary w\,r  
in that country, the taxes wrre of very differ*  
ent rales in the different Provinces; particular­  
ly the tax on salt, which was i^ti in the inte­  
rior provinces and low in &#x27;be mari.inu*, m.f the  
tax on tob-cco, which was very high in grne*  
ral, whilst in some of the provinces the use of  
  
ill* diutic w i i nr consf­  
quencr was, that the standing army of patrols  
against smuggling had swoln to the num rr-f  
twenty-three thousand; the annual arrc&#x27;t of  
men, women, and child*en, engaged in smug,  
gling, to five-.thousand five hundied and fitly;  
and the number annually arrested on account of  
salt and tobacco alone, to seventeen or eighteen  
hundred, more than three hundied of whom  
were consigned to the tenible punishment of  
ilie gullies.  
Ma it not be regarded as among the prosi- I  
denti.il blessings of these States, that their g o­  
graphical rrl.lions, multipliid as thry vmII Ijo I  
by artificial channels of intercom se, give such  
additional force to the many obligations toi he  
rish that union vvhichalone secures theirptarc,  
their safety, atit! their prospt rity! Apar from  
the more obvious and awful consequ. n •» uf  
tlieir entire separation into indepenr&#x27;en sov*-r­  
eignties, it is worthy of speual considmii i,  
that, divided ftoin each other an thev mu&gt;&gt; lie  
by narrow waters and letrnoriul lines tmr iy,  
the facility of surreptitious introductions o: c n­  
traband articles, would defeat every at.emp at  
1 revenue in the easy Sc indirect modes of impist  
I Sc excise;so that while their expenditure would  
be necessarily and vastly incieased by th&gt;t&lt; new  
| situation, tin y would, in providing fur them, hr.  
limited to direct taxes on land or other pro­  
perty, to arbittary assessments on invisible  
funds, and to the odious tax on persons.  
Yon will observe that I have confined myself,

Iliit ol “regulating ‘ alue.*’ had not the latter t  
ower been expressly inserted. The term tax­  
if standing alone, would certainly have in- :  
luded duties, imposts, and excise*. In another «  
■Huso it is said, “no tax or duties shall be laid on i  
ixports, 6ic. 1 Here the two terms are used as *  
lyiionymous. And in another clause, where it is &lt;  
,:,td„“no Slate shall lay any imposts, or duties, ] i  
Stc.’ the terms imposts and duties arc synony-1 j  
inous. Pleonasms, tautologies, and the promiscu-11  
&gt;us use ot terms and phrases, diflcring in their |  
shades of meaning, (always to be expounded with i  
rcfoience to the context and under the control of:  
the general character and manifest scope of the ! i  
instrument in which they are found) are lobe as­  
cribed, somctiinrs to the purpose of greater caution;  
sometimes to the imperfections of language, and  
sometimes to the imperfection of man himself. In  
this view of the subject, it was quite natural,  
however certainly tho general power to regulate  
trade might include a powi r to impose duties on it,  
not to omit it in a clause enumerating the several  
modes of revenue, authorised by the Constitution.  
In few eases could the “e\-n&gt;ajori cautela” occur  
with more claim to respect.  
Nor can it be inferred, that a power to regulate  
trade does not involve a power to tax it, from the  
distinction made in the original controversy with  
Great Britain, between a power to regulate trade  
with the Colonies, and a power to tax them. A  
power to regulate trado between dillerent parts  
or the Empire, was confessedly necessary; and  
was admitted to lie, as far as that was the case, in  
the British Parliament; the taxing part being at  
the same time denied to the Paiiiament, and as­  
serted to be necessarily inherent in the Colonial  
J.egidatures, as sufficient, and the only safo de­  
positsies of the taxing power. So difficult was it,  
nevertheless, to maintain the distinction in prac­  
tice, that the ingredient of revenue was occasion­  
ally overlooked or disregarded in the British regu­  
lations, as in the duty on sugar and molasses im­  
ported into the t-olonics. And it was fortunate,  
that the attempt at an internal and direct lax, in  
the case ot the Stamp Act, produced a radical  
examination of the subject before a regulation  
ol trade with a view to revenue, had grown into  
an established authority. One thing at least, ix  
certain, that the main and admitted object of the  
Parliamentary regulations of trade with the Colo­  
nies, was the encouragement of manufactures in  
Great Britain.  
  
uui me present question is unconnected with  
the former relations between Great Britain and  
her colonics, which were of a peculiar, a compli­  
cated, and, in several respects, oT an undefined  
character. It is a simple question under the Con­  
stitution of the United States, whether&quot; the pow­  
er to regulate trade with foreign nations” as a  
distinct and substantive item In the enumerated  
pow-eft embraces the object of encouraging by  
duties,^restrictions and prohibitions, the manufac­  
tures and products of the country? And the af­  
firmative muM be inferred from the following con­  
siderations:  
1. 1 lie meaning of the phrase &quot;to regulate trade”  
must be sought in the general use of it; in other  
words, in the objects to which the power was ge­  
nerally understood to be applicable, when the  
phrase was inserted in the Constitution.  
2. The power has been understood and used  
ny all commercial and manufacturing nations, as  
embracing the object of encouraging manufac­  
tures. It is believed that not a single exception  
can be named.  
^ 3. T hi- has been particularly the case with  
Great Britain, whose commercial vocabulary is  
the parent ot ours. A primary object of hcrcom­  
meicial regulations is w ell known to Iravo been  
the promotion and encouragement of her manu­  
factures.  
-1. buch was understood to be a proper use of  
the power by the State- most prepared for manu­  
facturing industry, whilst retaining the power over  
their foreign trade.  
5. Such a use of the power, by Congress, ac­  
cords with the intention and expectation of the  
States, in transferring thejpower over trade from  
themselves to the Government of the U. States.  
This was emphatically the case in the Eastern,  
the mere manufacturing Members of the Confed­  
eracy. Hear the language held in the Convention  
of Massachusetts.  
By Mr. Dawes, an advocate for the Constitution,  
tt was observed, &quot;Our manufactures are another  
&quot; great subject which has receive.d no encourage­  
t&#x27;mnt by national duties on lorcign manufac­  
&quot; lures, and they never can by any authority in  
&quot; the old Confederation.” Again, “ If we wish  
“ to encourage our own manufactures, to preserve  
&quot; our own commerce, to raise the value of our  
“ own lands, we must give Congress the powers  
“ n-. question.  
By Mr. Widgery, an opponent: “All we hear  
&quot; is, that the merchant ami farmer will nourish,  
“ and that the mechanic and tradesman are to make  
“ ‘heir fortunes directly if the Constitution goes  
&quot; down.” b *  
The Convention of Massachusetts was the only  
one in New England whose dehates have been  
preserved. But it cannot be doubted that the sen­  
timent there expressed was common to the other  
btates in that quarter, more especially to Connec­  
ticut and Ithodc Island, the most thickly peopled  
of all the States, anti having of course, their  
thoughts most turned to the subject of manufac­  
tures. A like inference may be confidently ap­  
plied to New Jersey, whose debates in Conven­  
tion have not been preserved. In the populous  
and manufacturing State of Pennsylvania, a par­  
tial account only ol the debates having been pub­  
lished, noihing certain is known of what passod in  
her Convention on this point. But ample evidence  
may be found else where,that regulations of trade,  
for the encouragement of manufactures, were con­  
sidered as within the power to ho granted to the  
new Congress, as well as within the scope of the  
national policy. Of (he States South of Pennsyl­  
vania, the only two in whose Conventions the de­  
bates have been preserved are Virginia and North  
i aronna, anu from these no adverse inferences can  
be drawn. Nor is there the slightest indication  
that nthorof the tivo States farthest South, whoso  
debates in Convention, if preserved, have not i  
been made public, viewed the encouragement of  
manufactures, as not within the general power i  
iver trade to be transferred to the Government of ,  
the United States.  
6. if Congress have not the power, it is anni­  
tiilated for the nation; a policy without example  
n any other nation, and not within the reason of  
he solitary one in our own. The example allud­  
?(] to, is the prohibition of a tax on exports, which i  
recited from the apparent impossibility of raisin*&#x27;, i  
n that mode, a revenue from the Stales, proper- i  
mned to the ability to pay it—the ability of soino  
icing derived, in a great measure, not Irom their I  
exports, but from their fisheries, from their i  
freights, and from commerce at large, in «ome of l  
ts branches altogether external to the United :  
Mates; the profits from all which, being invisible !  
in*l int.ingiblo, would escape a tax, on exports_A I  
ax on imports on the other hand, being a tax on I  
ronsuinption, which is in proportion to iho ability I  
&gt;t the consumers, whencesoever derived, was free I  
rom that incnualitv.  
  
7. If re venue be the sole object of a legitimate  
mpost, and the encouragement of domestic&#x27;articles  
&gt;e not witlpn the power of regulating trade, it  
voiil.l follow that no monopolizing or unequal rr­  
MW Could

&gt;• c£nw^er*°6 R‘® power as an incidental power.  
S. 1 hat tho encouragement of manufactures was  
n object of the power to regulate trade, ia prov­  
d by the use made of the power for that object,  
n the first session of tho First Congress under the  
constitution;, wl&#x27;en among the members present  
vere^so many who had been members of the Fed­  
“lal Convention which trained the Constitution,  
uni ol the State Conventions which ratified it;  
;ach of these classes consisting also of members  
vho had opposed and who had espoused, the Con­  
litution in its actual form. It does not appear from  
ho printed proceedings of Congress on that occa­  
&#x27;ion, that the power was denied by any of them.  
\nd it may be remarked, that members from Vir­  
;iuia, in pai (icular, as well of the anti-fcdcral as  
die lodural party, the names then distinguishing  
ihose who had opposed and tho«e who had approv­  
ed the Constitution, did not hesitate to propose du­  
ties and to suggest even prohibitions in favor of  
several articles of her production. By one a duty  
was proposed on mineral coal, in favor of tho Vir­  
ginia coal pits; by another, a duty on heiup was  
proposed, to encourage the growth of that article;  
uid by a 3d, a prohibition even of foreign beef was  
suggested, as a measure of sound policy. rSec  
Lloyd&#x27;s Debates.]  
A further evidence in support of the constitu­  
tional power to protect and foster manufactures by  
regulations ot trade, an evidence that ou^lit, of  
itseli, to settle the question, is the unilorm and  
practical sanction given to the power, by the Gen­  
eral Government, for nearly -1U years; with a con­  
currence or acquiescence of every Slate Govern­  
ment, throughout the same period; and.it may be  
added, thro all the vicissitudes of party which  
marked the period. No novel construction, how­  
ever ingeniously devised, or however respectable  
and patriotic its patrons, can withstand the weight  
ol such authorities, or the unbroken current of so  
prolonged and universal a practice. And well it  
is that this cannot be done, witho t the interven­  
tion of the same authority which made the Con­  
stitution. It it could he so done, there would be  
an end to that stability in Govei mnent,and in Laws,  
which is essential to good government and good  
laws, a stability, the want of which is the imputa­  
tion which has at all times been levelled against  
Republicanism, with most effect, by its most dex­  
trous adversaries. The imputation ought never,  
therefore, to be countenanced, by innovating con­  
structions, without any plea of a precipitancy, or  
a paucity of the constructive precedents they op­  
pose; without any appeal to material facts newly  
brought to light; and without any claim to a bet­  
ter knowledge of the original evils and inconveni*  
cnees, for which remedies were needed, the verv  
best keys to the true object and meaning of  
all laws and constitutions.  
. may R not be fairly left to the unbiassed  
judgment of all men of experience and of intelli­  
gence, to decide, which is most to be relied on for  
a sound and safe test of the meaning ol a Consti­  
tution, a uniform interpretation by all the succes­  
sive authorities tinder it, commencing with its  
birth, and continued lor a long period, through the  
varied state of political contests; or the opinion of  
every new Legislature, heated as it may be by the  
stiiteof parlies—or warped, as often happens, by  
the eager pursuit of some favorite object—or car­  
ried away, possibly, by the powerful eloquence or  
captivating address of a few popular statesmen,  
themselves, perhaps, influenced by the same mis­  
leading causes? it the latter test is to prevail, ev­  
ery new legislative opinion might make a new  
Constitution, as the loot of every new Chancellor  
would make a new standard of mnoir.  
  
It w seen, with no little surprise, that an attempt  
has been made,in a highly respectable quarter,and  
at length reduced to a resolution, formally propos­  
ed m Congress, to subsitute, for the power of  
Congress to regulalc trade so as to encourage man  
utaeturcs, a power in the several States to do «o  
with the consent of that body; ami this expedient ,  
*s derived from a clause in the tenth section of ar­  
ticle first ol the Constitution, which says: “ No  
State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay  
any imposts or duties on imjiorts or exports, except  
what may he absolutely necessary for executing  
its inspection laws; and the net produce of all du  
ties, and imposts, laid by any State on imports and  
exports, shall be for the use of the Treasury of the  
Linted States; and all such laws shall be subject  
to the revision and control of the Congress.”  
To say nothing of the clear indications in the  
Journal of the Convention ol 1787 that the clause  
was intended merely to provide lor expenses in­  
curred by particular States, in their Inspection  
taws, and in such improvements as they might  
choose to make in their harbors and rivers, with  
the sanction of Congress—objects to which the re­  
served power has been applied, in several instan­  
ces, at the request of Virginia and Georgia—how  
could it ever he imagined that any State would  
wish to tax its own trade for the encouragement  
ot manufactures, if possessed of the authority or  
could, in fact, do so, if wishing it?  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its own con­  
sumption; and the net proceeds going, according  
to the clause, not into its own Treasury, but into  
the treasury ol the United States,the State would  
tax itsolf separately for the equal gain of all the  
other States; and as far as the manufactures, -o  
encouraged, might succeed in ultimately increas­  
ing the stock m market,and lowering the price by  
competition, thts advantage, also, procured at  
the sole expense of the State, would be common  
to all the others  
But the very suggestion of such an expedient  
to any State, would have an air of mockery, when  
its experienced impracticability is taken into view.  
-N o one, w ho recollects or recurs to the period  
when the power over commerce was in the indi­  
vidual States, and separate attempts were made  
to tax, or otherwise regulate it, need he told that  
the attempts were not only abortive, but, by de­  
monstrating the necessity of general and uniform  
regulations, gave the original impulse to the con­  
ilitiiUonaI reform which provided lor such regu­  
lations. ”  
&#x27;i o refer a Sta e, therefore, to Iho exercj«eofa  
KMver, as reserved to her by the Constitution,  
lie impossibility of exercising which was an in­  
lucoment to adopt the Constitution, is, of all re­  
nerlial devices, the last that ought to be brought  
or ward. And what renders it this more extraor­  
liiiary, *a» that, as the ta.r on commerce, as far  
is it could be separately collected, instead of be­  
onging to the Treasury of the State, as prev ious to  
he Constitution, would he a tribute to the United  
stales, the State would be in a worse condition,  
ifter the adoption of the Constitution, than betore,  
n reference to an important interest, the im­  
iroveinent of which was a particular object in a­  
lopfing the Constitution.  
  
iTure v.ungrcs3 lo make thn proposed declara­  
tion of consent to state tariff* in favor of State man­  
nfartnres, and (lie permitted attempts did not do­  
teat themselves what would be the situaiion of  
states deriving their toreign supplies through the  
ports of other States? It is evident that they might  
ho compelled to pay, in their consumption of par­  
tleulur articles imported, a lax for the common  
treasury, not common to all the States, without  
having any manufacture or product oi their own  
to partake ol the contemplated benefit  
OI the impracticability of separate regulations  
or trade, and the resulting neciydty of general  
regulations, no State was mere * niiLIc t*i ir, Vir­  
ginia. She was accordingly atnoi«&#x27;/ th­  
• Cougrese a j on • r adequate  
to (ho objt rt. On more occasions than one in the  
proceedings of her Legislative councils it was  
recited ‘that (ho relative situation ot the Stat**  
had hern found, on trial, to require uniformity in  
their commercial regulations as the only « tf.ctual  
policy for obtaining in tho ports of foreign nations &#x27;  
tipulatlon of privileges rcriprocal to those en­  
joyed by^ the subjects of such nations in the ports  
ot the United States; for preventing animosities  
which cannot tail to arise among the several  
States from the interference of pariial and separate  
regulations; and for deriving from commerce such i  
aids to the public revenue as it ought to conlri  
J ute, &amp;c.”  
During the delays and discouragements expori- I  
enccd in the attempts to invest Congress with the  
nceessary powers, (he State of Virginia made va- *  
lions trials of what could be done by herindivjdu- i  
al laws. She ventured on duties and imposts as a I  
source of revenue : Resolution* were pa**e&lt;i at i

The effect of her separate attempts to raise re­  
venue by duties on imports, soon appeared in re­  
presentations from her merchants, that the com­  
merce of the Mate was banished by them into o •  
(her channels, especially ol Maryland, where im­  
ports were less burdened than iu Virginia. fSee  
Do. for 17SU.J ** 1  
Such a tendency of separate regulations was  
indeed loo manifest to escape anticipation. Among  
•he projects prompted by the want of a Federal  
authority over commerce, was that of a concert  
lust proposed on the part of Maryland for a unifor­  
mity of regulations between the two States, nn 1  
Comnii-sioncrs were appointed lor that purpose._  
It was soon perceived, however, that the concur­  
rence ol Pennsylvania was as necessary to Mary­  
land a« of Maryland to Virginia, and the concur­  
rence of Pennsylvania was accordingly iuvi&#x27;ed._  
jdut Pennsylvania could no morn concur without  
New York than Maryland without Pennsylvania  
nor New \ork without the concurrence of Bos­  
ton, fee.  
These projects were superceded for the nio­  
ment by that of the Convention .at Annapolis in  
17*6, and forever hy the Convention at PuiUlcl­  
phia in 1787, and the Constitution which was the  
truitofit.  
  
1 hero is a passage in Mr. Neckcr&#x27;s work on ti.o  
finance* of France which affords a signal illustra­  
tion of the difficulty of collecting, m contiguous  
communities, indirect taxes, when not the same iu  
all, by the violent means resorted to against smug­  
gling ft ora one to another of them. Previous m  
the late Itevolutiouary war in that country, th -  
taxes were of very different rates in the different  
P&lt;evinces; particularly the tax on -alt, which was  
!!n &#x27; &#x27;&quot;,tenor »,r?v‘nces a‘&gt;d low in the mari­  
time, and the tax on tobacco, which was very hizli

of the article was altogether free. The conse­

May it not be regarded as among the providen­

cal relations, multiplied as they will be by artificial  
channels of intercourse, give such additional force  
to the many obligations to cherish that union  
which alone secures their peace, their safety, and  
their prosperity ! Apart from the more obvious  
and awful consequences or their entire separation  
into independent sovereignties, it is worthy ol epc­  
rial consideration, that, divided from each other as  
they mus be by narrow waters and territorial line,  
merely, the facility of surreptitious introductions  
of contraband artulle*. would defeat every attemnt  
at revenue in the easy and indirect modes of i,„.

Montpellier, September 18, 1828.  
  
_ Dear sir: Your lute letter reminds me of our conversa-  
tion on the constitutionality ofthe power in congress to  
= a tariff for the encouragement of manufactures;  
and of my romise to sketch the grounds of the confident  
opinion I had ee that it was among the powers  
vested in that body. I had not forgotten my promise,  
and had even begun the task of fulfilling it; but frequent  
interruptions, from other causes, being followed by a  
  
  
  
_ bilious indisposition, I have not been able sooner to com-  
  
ply with your request. The subjoined view of the subject  
  
| might have been advantageously expanded; but I leave  
  
that improvement to your own reflections and researches.  
The constitution vests in congress, expressly, *‘the  
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and ex-  
cises;” and “the power to regulate trade.”  
That the former power, if not particularly expressed,  
would have been included in the latter as one of the ob-  
  
_ jects of a general power to regulate trade, is not neces-  
  
sarily impugned by its being so expressed. Examples of  
this sort cannot sometimes be easily avoided, and are to  
be seen elsewhere in the constitution. Thos the power  
“to define and punish offences against the law of nations,”  
includes the power, afterwards particularly expressed,  
‘ to make rules concerning captures, &amp;c.” from offending  
neutrals, So also a power “‘to coin money” would doubt-  
less include that of ‘‘regulating its value,” had not the  
latter power been expressly inserted. ‘I&#x27;he term taxes, if  
Standing alone, would certainly have included duties, im-  
posts and excises. [n another clause it is said,‘‘no tax or  
duties shall be laid on exports, &amp;c.’? Here the two  
terms are used as synonymous. And in another clause,  
where itis said ‘*no state shall Jay any imposts, or duties,  
— the terms imposts. and duties are synonymous.—  
  
leonasms, tautologies, and the promiscuous use of terms  
  
Pere ‘ and phrases, differing in their shades of meaning, (always  
  
ll  
.  
:  
  
  
  
  
  
to be expounded with reference to the context and under  
  
the control of the general character and manifest scope of  
the instrument in which they are found), are to be asetibed,  
sometimes to the purpose of greater caution; sometimes  
to the imperfections of lan , and sometimes to the  
imperfections of man himself. In this view of the sub-  
ject, it was quite natural, however, certainly the qeocss  
power to regulate trade might include a power to impose  
duties on it, not to omit it in a clause enumerating the  
seyeral modes of revenue, authourised by the constitu-  
tion. In few cases could the “ex majori cautela” occur  
with more claim to respect,  
  
Nor ean it be inferred, that a power to regulate trade  
does not involve a power to tax it, from the distingtion  
made in the original controversy with Great Britain, be-  
tween a power to regulate trade with the colonies, and a  
power to tax them. A power to regulate trade betwevn  
different parts ofthe empire, was confessedly necessary;  
and was admitted to lie, as far as that- was the case, in  
the British parliament; the taxing part being at the same  
time denied to the parliament, and asserted to be necessa-  
rily inherent in the colonial ad as sufficient, and  
the only safe depositories of the taxing power. So dif-  
ficult was it, nevertheless, to maintain the distinction in  
practice, that the ingredient of revenue was occasionally  
overlooked or disregarded in the British regulations, as  
in the duty on sugar and molasses imported into the col-  
onies. Andit was fortunate that the attempt at an in-  
  
ternal and direct tax, in the case of the stamp act, produce  
  
ed a radical examination of the subject before a regu-  
lation of trade with a view to revenue had grown into an  
established authority. One thing at least is certain, that  
the main and admitted object of the parliamentary regu-  
lations of trade with the colonies, was the encourage-  
ment of manufactures in Great Britain.  
  
But the present question is unconnected with the far-  
mer relations between Great Britain and her colonies,  
which were ofa peculiar, a complicate, and, in several  
respects, of an undefined character. It isa simple ques-  
tion under the constitution of the United States, whether  
‘the power to regulate trade with foreign nations’’ as a  
distinct and substantive item in the enumerated powers,  
embraces the object of encouraging by duties, restric-  
tions and prohibitions, the manufactures and products af  
the country? And the affirmative must be inferred from  
the following considerations:  
  
1, The meaning of the phrase ‘to regulate trade”  
must be sought «m the general use of it; in other words  
in the objects to which the power was generally un-  
derstood to be applicable, when the plirase was inserted in  
the constitution.  
  
2. The power has been ‘understood and used by all  
paainanieaial and manufacturing nations, as embracing  
the object of encouraging manufactures. It is believ-  
ed that nota single exception can be named,  
  
3. This had been particularly the case with Great Brit-  
ain, whose commercial vocabulary is the parent of ours.  
A primary object of her commercial regulations is well  
known to have been the protection and enepuragement of  
her manufactures,  
  
4. Such was understood to be a proper use of the power  
by the states most prepared tor manufacturing industry,  
whilst retaining the power over their foreign trade. :  
  
5. Such a use of tue power, by congress, accords with  
the intention and expectation of the states, in transfer-  
ring the power over trade trom themselves to. the go-  
vernment of the United States. ‘This was emphatically  
the case in the eastern, the more manufacturing members  
ofthe confederacy. Hear the language held in the cone  
vention of Massachusetts.  
  
By Mr. Dawes, an advocate forthe constitution, it was  
observed, ‘four manufactures are another great subject  
which has received no encouragement by national dutics  
on foreign manulactures, and they never can by any au-  
thority im the old contederation.” Again, “It we wish  
to encourage our own manufactures, to preserve our  
own commerce, to raise the value of our own lands, we  
must give congress the powers in question.”  
  
By Mr. weeny: opponent: ‘‘All we hear is, that  
the merchant and farmer will flourish, and that the me-  
  
chanic aud tradesmen are to make their fortunes direct-  
ly, if the constitution goes down.”

The convention of Massachusetts wasthe only one in  
England whose debates have been preserved. But  
jt cannot be doubted that the sentiment there expressed  
was common to the other states in that quarter, more  
ly to Connecticut and Rhode Island, the most  
thickly peopled of all the states, and having, of course,  
their thoughts most turned to the subject of mannufac-  
tures. A like inference may be confidently applied to  
New Jersey, whose debates in convention have not been  
served. Inthe populous and manufacturing state of  
ennsylvahia, a partial account only of the debates having  
been published, nothing certainis known of what pass-  
ed in her convention on this point. But ample evidence  
may be found elsewhere, that regulations of trade, for  
the encouragement of manutactures, were considered as  
within the power to be granted to the new congress, as  
well as within the scope of the national policy. Of the  
states south of Deonayleonis, the only two in whose con-  
ventions the debates have been preserved, are Virginia  
and North Carolina, and from these no adverse inferen-  
ces canbe drawn. Nor is there the slightest indication  
that either of the two states farthest south, whose de-  
tes in convention, if preserved, have not been made  
public, viewed the encouragement of manufactures, as  
not within the general power over trade to be transferred  
tothe government of the United States.  
  
- &amp;. congress have not the power, it is annihilated  
for the nation; a policy without example in any other na-  
tion, and not within the reason of the solitary one in our  
own, The example alladed to, is the prohibition of a  
tax.on exports, which resulted from the apparent impos-  
sibility of raising, in that mode, a revenue from the states,  
pespeetnner to the ability to pay it—the ability of some  
  
eing derived, in a great measure, not from their exports,  
but from their fisheries, from théir freights, and from  
commerce at large, in some of its branches altogether  
external to the United States; the profits from all which,  
being invisible and intangible, would escape a tax, on ex-  
ports. A tax on imports on the other hand, being a tax  
  
6a consumption, which is in proportion to the ability of  
  
the consumers, whencesoever derived, was free from  
that inequality.  
  
7. If revenue be the sole object of a legitimate im-  
post, and the encouragement of domestic articles be not  
within the power of regulating trade, it would follow that  
nO monopolizing or unequal regulations of foreign na-  
tians could be counteracted; that neither the staple arti-  
cles of subsistence; nor the essential implements for the  
public safety, could, under any circumstances, be insur-  
ed.or fostered at home, by regulations of commerce,  
  
the usual and most convenient mode of providing for  
  
both, and that the American navigation, though the  
spunce of naval defence, of a cheapening competition in  
carrying our valuable and bulky articles to market, and  
of an independent carriage of them during foreign wars,  
when a foreign navigation might be withdrawn, must be  
at once abandoned, or speedily destroyed: it being evi-  
dent that a tonnage duty in foreign ports agaitist our ves-  
sels, and an exemption from such a duty in our ports, in  
favor of foreign vessels, must have the inevitable effect  
of banishing ours from the ocean.  
  
To assume a power to protect our navigation, and the  
enltivation and fabrication of all articles requisite for the  
public safety, as incident to the war power, would be a  
more latitudinary construction of the text of the consti-  
tution, than to consider it as embraced by the specified  
power to regulate trade; a power which has been exer-  
cised by all nations for those purposes, and which effects  
those purposes with less of interference with the autho-  
rity and conveniency of the states, than might result  
from internal and direct modes of encouraging the arti-  
cles, any of which modes would be authorized, as far  
as deemed ‘‘necessary and proper,’? by considering the  
power as an incidental power.  
  
8. That the encouragement of manufactures was an  
object of the power to regulate trade, is proved by the  
use made of  
of the first congress under the constitution; when among  
the members present were so many who had been mem-  
bers of the federal convention which framed the consti-  
tution, and of the state conventions which ratified it; each  
of these classes consisting also of members who had op-  
posed amd wirohad cspoused the consfitution. in its ag

even of foreign beef was suggested, as a measure of

A further evidence in support of the constitutional  
power to protect and foster manufactures by regulations  
of trade, an evidence that ought of itself, to settle the  
  
uestion, is the uniform and practical sanction given to  
  
e power, by the general government, for nearly forty  
years; with a concurrence ‘or acquiescence of eve  
state pore, throughout the same period; and, it  
may be added, threugh all the vicissitudes of party  
which marked the period. No novel construction, how.  
ever ingeniously devised, or however respectable and  
patriotic its patrons, can withstand the weight of such  
authorities, or the unbroken current of eo prolonged  
and universal a practice. And well itis that this can.  
not be done, without the intervention of the same av.  
thority which made the constitution. If it could be so  
done, there would be an end to that stability in govern.  
ment, and in laws, whichis essential to good govern.  
ment and good laws, a stability, the want of which  
is the imputation which has at all times been levelled  
against republicanism, with most effect, by its most dex-  
trous adversaries. The imputation ought never, there-  
fore, to be countenanced, by innovating constructions,  
without any plea of a precipitancy, or a paucity of the  
constructive precedents they oppose; without any ap-  
peal to material facts newly brought to light; and with-  
out any claim toa better knowledge of the original evils  
and inconveniences, for which remedies were needed,  
the very best keys to the true object and meaning of al!  
laws and constitutions.  
  
And may it not be fairly left to the unbiassed juig-  
ment of all men of experience and of intelligence, to  
decide, which is most to be relied on for a sound and  
safe test of the meaning of a constitution, a uniform in-  
terpretation by all the successive authorities under it,  
commencing with its birth, and continued for a long  
period, through the varied state of political contests; or  
the opinion of every new legislature, heated as it may be  
by the strife of parties—or warped, as often happens, by  
the eager pursuit of some favorite objector carried  
away, possibly, by the powerful cloquenee or captivating  
address of a few popular statesmen, themselves, per-  
haps, influenced by the same misleading causes? Ifthe  
latter test is to prevail, every new legislative opinion  
might make a new constitution, as the foot of every new  
chancellor would make a new standard of measure.  
  
It is seen, with no little surprise, that an attempt has  
been made, in a highly respectable quarter, and at length  
reduced toa resolution, formally proposed in congres:,  
to substitute, for the power of congres to regulate trade  
so as to encourage manufactures, a power in the sever!  
states to dlo&#x27;so, with the consent of that body; and this ex-  
pedient is derived from a-clause in the tenth section o!  
article first of the constitution, which says: ‘‘No state  
shall, without the consent of congress, lay any imposts  
or duties on imports or exports, except what may be ab-  
solutely necessary for executing its inspection laws; and  
the net produce of all duties, and imposts, laid by any  
state on imports and exports, shall be for the use of the  
treasury of the United Statesj and all such laws shall be  
subjeet to the revision and control of of the congress.”  
  
To say nothing of the clear indications in the journal of  
the conventiou of 1787, that the clause was intended  
merely to provide for expenses ineurred by particular  
states, in their inspection laws, and in such improve  
ments as they might choose to make in their harbors and  
rivers, with the sanction of congress—objects. to which  
the reserved power has been — in several instances;  
at the request of Virginia and Georgia—how could it be  
ever imagined that any state would wish to tax its ow&quot;

encouragement of manufctures, if possessed  
pgs we , or could, in fact, do so, if wishing it?  
  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its own consump- &#x27;  
tion; and the net proceeds going, according to the clause,  
not into its own treasury, but into the treasury of the  
United States, the state would tax itself separately for  
the equal gain of all the other states; and as far as the  
manufactares so encouraged, might succeed in ultimate-  
ly increasing the stock in market, and lowering the price  
by competition, this advantage, also, procured at the sole  
expense of the state, would be common to all the others.  
  
But the very suggestion of such an expedient to any  
state, would have an air of mockery, when its experienc-  
ed impracticability is taken into view. No one, who re-  
collects or recurs to the period when the power over  
commerce was in the individual states, and separate at-  
tempis were made to tax, or otherwise regulate it, need  
be told that the attempts were not only abortive, but, by  
demonstrating the necessity of general and uniform regu-  
lations gave the original impulse to the constitational  
reform which provided for sach regulations.  
  
To refer a state, therefore, to the exercise of a power,  
as reserved to her by the constitution, the impossibility of  
exercising which was an inducement to adopt the consti-  
tution, is, of, all remedial devices, the last that ought to  
be brought forward. And what renders it the more ex-  
traordinary, is, that, as the tax on commerce, as far as it  
could be separately collected, instead of belonging to the  
treasury Of the stute, as previous to the constitution,  
would be a tribute to the United States, the state would  
be ina worse condition, after the adoption of the consti-  
tution, than before, in reference to an important interest,  
the improvement of which was a particular object in  
adopting the constitution.  
  
Were congress to make the proposed declaration of  
consent to state tariffs in favor of state manufactures, and  
the permitted attempts did not defeat themselves, what  
would be the situation of states deriving their foreign  
supplies through the ports of other ststes? It is evident  
that they might be compelled to pay, in their consump-  
tion uf particular articles imported, a tax for the com-  
man treasury, not common to all the states, without hav-  
ing any manulactare or product of their own, to partake  
of the contemplated benefit.  
  
Of the impracticability of separate regulations of trade,  
and the resulting necessity of neanral regulations, no  
state was more sensible than Virginia. She was accord-  
ingly among the most earnest for granting to congress a  
power adequate to the object. On more cecasions than  
one, in the proceedings of her legislative councils, it was  
recited ‘‘that the relative situation of the states had been  
found, on trial, to require uniformity in their commer-  
cial regulations as the only effectual policy for obtaining  
in the ports of foreign nations a stipulation of privileges  
reciprocal to those enjoyed by the subjects of such na-  
tions in the ports of the United States; for preventing  
animosities which cannot fail to arise among the several  
states from the interference of partial and separate regu-  
lations; and tor deriving from commerce such aids to the  
public revenue as it ought to contribute, &amp;c.”  
  
During the delays and discouragements experienced in  
the attempts to invest congress with the necessary pow-  
ers, the state of Virginia made various trials of what  
could be done by her individual laws. She ventures on  
duties and impostsasa source of revenue: resolutions  
were passed at one time to encourage and protect her own  
navigation and ship building; and in consequence of com-  
plaiuts and petitions from Norfolk, Alexandria and other  
places, against the monopolizing navigation laws of Great  
  
Britain, Large vy | in the trade between the United  
  
States and the British West Indies, she deliberated,  
with a purpose controlled only by the inefficiency of se-  
parate measures, on the experiment of forcing a recipro-  
ee by prohibitory regulations of her own.  
  
nal of house of delegates in 1785. }  
  
The effect of her separate attempts to raise revenue by  
duties on imports, soon appeared in representations  
fvomher merchants, that the commerce of the state was  
banished by them into other channels, especially of Ma-  
ryland, where imports were less burdened than in Vir-  
  
ginia. [See do. for 1786. ]  
  
‘See jour-  
  
moted by the want of a federal authority over commercé  
was that ofa concert first pr on the part of Ma-  
ryland for a uniformity of regulations betwetn the two  
states, and commissioners were appointed for that pur-  
pose. It was soon perceived, however, that the concur-  
rence of Pennsylvania was as necessary to Maryland as  
of Maryland to Virginia, and the concurrence of Venn-  
sylvania was accordingly invited. But ] Ivania  
could no more concur without New York than Mary-  
land without Pennsylvania, nor New York without the  
concurrence of Boston, &amp;c. ‘oo  
These projects were superseded for the moment by  
that of the convention at Annapolis in 1786, and forever  
by the convention at Philadelphia in 1787, aud the con-  
stitution whieh was the fruit of it.  
  
There is a passage in Mr. Necker’s work on the finan-  
ces of France which. affords a signal illustration of the  
difficulty of collecting, in contiguous communities, indirect  
taa.», When not the same in all, by the violent means re-  
sorted to against smuggling from one to another of them.  
Previous to the late revolutionary war in that country,  
the taxes were of very different rates in the different  
vinees; particalarlythe tax on salt, which was high in the  
interior provinces aud low in the maritime; and the 4  
  
on tobacco, which was very high in general, whilst in  
some of the provinces the use of the article was altogeth-  
erfree. ‘Theconsequence was, that the @.nding army  
of patrols against smuggling had swoln to the number of  
twenty-three thousand; the annual arrest of men, women,  
and children, engaged in smuggling, to five thousand five  
hundred and fifty; and the number annually arrested on  
account of salt and tobacco alone, to seventeen or eigh-  
teen hundred, more than three hundred of whom  
were consigned to the terrible punishment of the gallies.  
May it not be regarded as among the. providential  
blessings to these states, that their geographical relations,  
multiphied-as they will be by artificial channels of inter-  
course, give such additional force to the many obligatians  
to cherish that union which alone secures their peace,  
their safety, and their prosperity! Apart from the more  
obvious and awful consequences of their entire separation  
into independent sovereignties, it is worthy of special  
consideration, that, divided from each other as they must  
be by narrow waters and territorial lines merely, the fa-  
cility of surreptitious introductions of contraband articles  
would defeat every attempt at revenue in the easy and  
indirect modes of impost and excise; so that whilst their  
expenditures would be necessarily and vastly increased  
by their new situation, they would, in providing tor them,  
be limited to direct taxes on land or other property, to  
arbitrary assessments on invisible funds, and to the odious  
tax on persons,  
  
You will observe, that 1 have confined myself, in what  
has been said, to the constitutionality and expediency of  
the power in congress to encourage domestic products by  
regulations of commerce. In the exercise of the pow-  
er, they are responsible to their constituents, whose  
right and duty it is, in that as in all other cases, to bri  
their measures to the test of justice and of the aoaorel

. MosTEPELirs, September IE, 182C.  
Dkah Sir: Your late letter reminds me of our  
conversation on the constitutionality of the power in  
Congress to impose a tariff for the encouragement of  
manufactures; end of my promise to sketch the  
grounds of the confident opinion 1 had expressed, t hat  
it wns among the powers vested in that bodv. I had  
not tor,-utten my promise and had even begun the  
task ot fuIbHing it; but frequent interruptions, from  
other causes; being followed by a bilious indisposition,  
1 have n *t horn able sooner to comply with your re­  
quest. The subjoined view of the subject mi-rht  
have been advanfagconsly exjianded; but 1 leave that  
improvement to your ow n reflection and researches.  
j ne Constitution vests m Congress, expressly “the  
power to lay and colluct taxes, duties, imposts, and  
TJTSthctfmner poiyeVS’paVticu^Vfy exprea­  
«d, would have been included in the latter as one of  
the objects of a general power to regulate trade, is  
not necessarily impugned by its being so expressed.  
Examples of this sort cannot sometimes be easily  
avoided, and are to be seen elsewhere in the Consti­  
tution. Thus the power “to define and punish of­  
fences against the law of nations.” includes the p^w­  
rr atlerwarda particularly expressed, “to make  
rules concerning captures, Ac. from offending nou­  
So ,?l Power “to coin money” would  
doubtk-ss mcludet.uit op-regulating jta vela,-&#x27;” had not  
Hie latter power been expressly inserted. The term  
l axes,if standing atone, would certainly have included  
duties, imposts, and &#x27;&#x27;xcit.-v. [n another clause it i«  
said, “no, tax or duties shell he laid on exports, &amp;.c.&quot;  
, Here the two terms are used as synonymous. And  
m another clause, wh. re it said “no&#x27;.Statc shall lay ini­  
posta, or duties, dm.” the terms impost*and duties arc  
synonymous. PIrnm:mi%tomuJogirs,andthr promi^  
r&lt;!OOT oftP1[in8 a,,*l phrases, differing in their shades  
ol meaning, (always to be expounded with reference to  
t lie context and under the control of the erncrai eh ar­  
netcr and manifest scope of the instrument in which  
they arc found) are to bn ascribed, sometimes to the  
purpose of greater cant ion; sometimes to tho imper­  
1 notions of language, and sometimes to the imporlbc­  
tion of man himself. In this view of tho subject, it  
was quite natural, however certainly the general po w­  
nr to regulate trade might include a power to impose  
dutiys on it, not to omit it in a clause enumerntimr tho  
several mod*® of revenue, authorised by the Consti­  
tution. In low cases could ti.o “ex major! cautcja”  
occur with more cl iim to rchpoct.  
  
an or can it be inferred, that n power to rrtrn Into  
.radc does not involve a power fo tax it, from the  
distinction made in the origuual controversy with  
threat Britain, between a power to regulate trade  
w it li t be Colonies, an/1 a power to tnx them. A pow­  
er to regulate trade bet ween different parts oft lie Km­  
puu, was c.inf* v*,,. |ly ntret$aryf and was admitted to  
•. ^ &lt;r rtr tint was the case, in the British Parlia­  
M tilt* r .xiwr port being at the same time d-nied  
’ the lariwnu’u!, and asserted to be necessarily in­  
herent in the Coioninl legislatures, as sufficient, nnd  
t 1C only sate depositories of the taxing power. kSo  
mfuenj, wn* jt acvcrtholrr i, to maintain the distinc­  
tion in practice, that the dici.t of revenue was  
occasionally overJook&#x27;-d or di .regarded in the British  
regulationns in ibo duty on sngar and molasses irn­  
j turfed into Urn Colopii s. And it whs fortunate tint  
ho attempt at an nitemal and direct tnx, in the case  
ortho champ Act, produced a radical oxemirmtion of  
subject Ik for.j a regulation of trade with a view  
to revenue hud grown into an established authority.  
&lt;J»»o thing at Ifcuat m certain, that the main and adroit­  
t&#x27; l obpwt.of the Parliamentary regulation* of trade  
y. &#x27;lb the Colonies, w ys the encouragement of mnnfue­

and mauutnctiiriug nations, ns embracing  
  
• the object ol&#x27;uncouragtng luaimfacluilia. It u bohov­  
&#x27; cd that not a single exception can bo named,  
j 3. This has been particularly tho cate with Great  
Diitain, who** comm ireal vocabulary Is tlio parent of  
| ours. A | unary’ object of her commercial regula­  
; tions is well known to have been the protection and  
&#x27; encouragement of her manufactures.  
I 4. Such was understood to be a proper us© of the  
power by the St a to* mast prepared for man it fact tiring  
industry, whilst returning thepower over their foreign  
j trade.  
5. Such n use of the power, by ConsTess, accords  
1 with the intention and expectation of t ho States, in  
transferring tlie power over trade from themselves to  
1 Uic Government of Uio D. States. This wres emphat­  
ically t he case in the Hastern, tho more manufactu­  
ring Members of the Confederacy. Hear the lan­  
guage held in the Convention of Massachusetts.  
By Mr. Dawes, an advocate for the Constitution,  
it was observed, “Our manufactures are another  
“&#x27;groat subject which has received no cncoura gomont  
j “by national duties or. foreign manufactures, und they  
I “never ran by any authority in the old Confederation.”  
Again, “It we wish to encourage our am tnanufac­  
“&lt;ur»r, to preserve our own commerce, to {also the  
“value of our own lands, wo must give Congress the  
(“powers in question.”  
By Mr. Widgcry, an opponent: 44AH wo hear is,  
|“that the merchant and funner will flourish, and that  
&#x27; “the mechanic and tnub^man are to make their for­  
j “tunes directly, if the Constitution goes down.”  
i The Convcntiou of Massachusetts war. the only ere  
in New’ England whose debates have been presvsed.  
| But it cannot be doubted that the sontirocut there ex­  
I pressed was common to the other States in that quar­  
ter, more especially t i Connecticut and BJiode Island,  
the most thickly peopled of nil the States, and having,  
of course, their thoughts most turned to the subject  
of manufactures. A like inference may bo continent  
ly applied toJNew Jrrsry, whose debatesin Convention  
have not been preserved. In the populous mid man­  
ufacturing State of Pennsylvania, a partial account  
only of the debates having been published, nothing  
certain is known of what parsed in her Convention on !  
  
’ til is point. 15(11 ample evidence niay be found else*  
where, that regulations of* trade, ter the encourage­  
ment of manufactures, were considered uk within the  
power to be granted to tho new Congress, hs well »:* |  
within the scope oftlie national policy. Oftho States!  
South of Pennsylvania, the only two in uhopo Con* ■  
ventionsthe debates hare been preserved are Virgin­  
ia and North Carolina. «nd from those no adverse in-1  
fercucos can be drawn. Nor is there the slightest  
indication tlmt either of the two States farthest South. |  
whoso debates in Convention, if preserved, have not!  
been made public, viewed the encouragement of mm - i  
ufactures, 88 not within the general power over trade  
to be transferred to the Government oftho Unilcu  
State*?.  
6. *f Congress have nr t the power, it is annihilated j  
for the nation; a policy without example in any other  
nation, and not within tho reason of the solitary one  
in our own. The example alluded to, is the probibi- j  
, tion of a tr.x on exports, which resulted from the ap-1  
parent impossibility of raising. i.i that mode, a reve-i  
nue from the Ntxrea. proportioned to t!ie ability to pay !  
—tho ability of some being derived, iti a great mens-1  
ure, r.ot fion their exports, but from their fisheries,  
from their freights, and from commerce at large, in  
some of its brnnchosnltogctlicrcxtcrnal to tho United  
States; the pro5ts from all which, being invisible and  
; intangible, would escape a tax, cn exports. A tax on  
i imports on the other hand, being a tax ou consumption,  
j which is in proportion to the ability of the consumer*,  
j wheresoever derived, was free from that incqualityr  
t 7. If revenue be tho sole object of a legitimate im­  
port.n udUiecncourageinent of’ domestic articles be not  
within the pow^r of regulating trade, it would follow  
that no monopolizing or unequal regulations offoreign  
nations could be counteracted; that neither the staple  
articles of subsistence, nor the essential implements  
for the public-safety, could, under any circumstances,  
be insured or fostered nt home, by regulations of com­  
merce, the usual and most convenient mode of provi­  
ding for both; and that the American navigation,  
though the source of naval defence, of a cheapening  
competition in carrying our valuable and bulky art£  
c!cs to market, and of an independent carriage of  
them during foreign wars, when a foreign navigation  
might bo withdrawn, must b^ at once abandoned, or  
speedily destroyed: it being evident that a tonnage  
duty in foreign ports against our vessels, and an cx­  
~?“•** **»*» frnm «u-K &quot; A-»r i~­  
eign vessels, must havo tho inevitable • of ban­  
ishing ours from the ocean.  
To assume a power to protect our navigation, and  
the cultivation and fabrication of all articles requisite  
for the public safety, as incident to tho war power,  
vvould be a more latirudinary construction of the text  
of the Constitution, than to consider it a* embraced  
by the specified power to regulate trade; a power  
which hat been exercised by al. nations for those mir­  
pose*. and which effects those purposes with l»*s of  
interference with tlic autfiorif r and couvenii noy of  
the States, than might result from internal and direct  
mod-s of.ncouraging the article*, any of which mode*  
would oeauthorised, us far a* d&lt; er.vd “necessary and  
prnjvr,” by considering tho power a* an incidental  
power.  
  
8. That the,encouragement of manufacture* was  
an object of the power to regulate trade, is proved by  
*-he use made of the power tor that object, in the fir/t  
.s-nBir.n ot the First Congreei under the Constitution;  
when among the members present were so many who  
had been members of the I cdetal Convent ion which  
framed tiic Constitution, and of the Hl»&lt;c Conv.-n­  
ttons which ratified^; each of thorn classes consisting  
of members who had oP1M,sed nnd who had rsiousod,  
the Constitution m its actual form. It dims not ap.  
pear from the printed proceedings of Congress on  
C.nt occasion, that the power was denied by any of  
them. And i! may bo remarked, that Members from  
Virginia, in Articular, ns well of the u iti-f.-Ieral ns  
the federal party, the naums then distinguishing those  
who had opj^sed and those who In 1 approved the Con­  
stitution, cid not hesitate to propose duties and to  
euogefct even prohibitions in favor ufsov* ral nr&#x27;^Vs  
of her promotion. Fy one a duty v.» „ pronored&#x27;on  
mineral coni m favor ef the Virginia coal pits; by  
•another, n enty on hemp was proposed, to encour­  
age the growth of that article; nnd by a third, n pro­  
hibition even of foreign beef was suggested, an a m0a­  
snre of found policy. [He* Lloyds Achates. |  
A further evidence in support rf tho constitutional  
power to protect and foster immufieiurrs by rcguln­  
tionsof trade, anbvidotico that ought, of itself, to*et­  
tle tho question, is t he uriform nuU practical sanction  
given to the power, by the General Gover .rnent, for  
nearly forty years: with a eon . renco or acii.tie*­  
[eence of every Ktato Government, throughout tho  
name period; nnd, it may bo added, ll mimh all t he  
vin^itudesof party wliich marked the period. No  
novel court ruction, however ingeniously devised, or  
however ^respectable and patriotic its patrons, can  
withstand the weight of such authorities, or the un­  
broken current of so prolonged nnd universal a prsc­  
»ce. And well it is that this cannot be done, without  
he intervention of the same authority which made I  
t he Constitution. If it could he so don-, there would  
I he an end to that stability in Government, end in  
. V;&quot;’ &gt;* essential to good government and eood  
inwa, a rtabilit y the want of which is the imputation  
which has at afl times been levelled again* kepubli­

rt‘gu late trade so as to euconrage manufactures, u iww­  
cr in the several Elates to do so. with tho consent of  
that body; o:id this expedient is derived from a clause  
mine textn section of article first of the lonsutuuon,  
which says: “No State shall, without the consent of

Tosav nothing of the clear indication* in tho Jour- j

JM1T me very suggestion of n:*r ii nn expedient to anv  
* late. would have an air of me leery, when its&amp;rwcrt­  
fiird impracticability is ti!;m into view. No one J  
&#x27; J &gt; recollect * or recur* to ti e period when Hip p,,\vpr  
0 cr commerce was i:i the imttyuhial States&#x27;, and!  
i*par:t*» attempts were Made to- *ax, or otherwise  
rognlute it, need he told that the attempts were not1  
only abortive, but, by demonstrate the necessity of:  
general &lt;tnd unkoim regulations, pave&#x27; the original |  
impulse to the constitutional reform * wiicn provided !  
for such regulations.  
To refer a State, therefore, to the exercise of a  
power, as reserved to her hv- the CpffetBbtion, the  
impossibility of exercising which wa s i.n inducement  
toudopt tho Constitution, is, ofall rcau dial devices, I  
the last that ought to ho brought forward. And what j  
rcndcr.%.it the more extraordinary, is, that, ns the tax !  
on commerce, as tar as it could bo separately collected,!  
instead of belonging to the Treasury of the State, as ’  
previous to the Constitution, would he a tribute to the!  
(&#x27;tilled States, the ,si.ntc would be in a worsocondi-!  
tion, after the adoption of the Constitution, than :  
before, in reference to an important interest, the im­  
provement of which was a particular object in adopt­  
ing the Constitution.  
Were Congress to make tho proposed declaration  
of consent to Htate tariiFs in favor of state manufac­  
tures, and the permitted attempts did not defeat them­  
selves, what would be the situation of States deriving  
their foreign simplies through the ports of other  
States1 U is e\ iuvnt that they might be compelled to  
pay, in their consumption of particular articles im­  
ported, a tax for the common treasury, not common  
to ail thi* Slates, without having cny manufacture or  
product of their own, to partake of the contemplated  
benefit  
Of the impracticability of separate regulations of  
trade, and the resulting necessity of general re&lt;mla­  
j tions, no State was more sensible than Virginia.  
She was accordingly among the most earnest for  
granting to Congress a power adequate to the object.  
On more occasions than one in the proceedings of  
her Legislative councils it was recited “that the  
| relnth a situation of the Lltatcs had been Lund, on  
£naL to require uniformity in their eomrucrcial roffti

separate regulations; and for deriving fromcommerce  
such aids !o the public revenue as it oimht to contri­  
bute, &amp;t.&quot;  
During the delay and discouragements experienced  
■nthe attempts to invest Congress with the nuce&amp;ta­  
ry poucri-., the State of Virginia made various trials  
of what could be done by her individual Jaw*. She  
| ventured on duties ar.d imposts as a source of revenue:  
Resolutions were passed at i&lt;no time to encourage and  
protect her own navigation and ship building; and in  
, onsequencc of complaint* and petitions from Norfolk,  
Alexandria, and other places, against the monopoliz­  
ng navigation laws of Great Britain, particularly in  
I ‘.he tr..de bthreen the United States and the British

the coiiaiilulionality of me power of  
veisal.on oil  
Congress to impose a tanlf lor the encouragement oi  
manufactures ; and of my promise to sketch the  
grounds ol the confident opinion I had expressed,  
mat it was among llie powers vested in that body.  
1 had not forgotten my promise, and had even begun  
the task of lullilling it, hut frequent interruptions,  
from other causes, being followed by a Olilious indis­  
position, I have not been able sooner to comply with  
your request. The subioiued view ot the subject  
might have been advantageously expanded ; hut 1  
leave that improvement to your own reflections  
and researches.  
The Constitution vests in Congress, expressly,  
&quot; the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,  
and excises and &quot; the power to regulate trade.&quot;  
That the former power, if not particularly ex­  
pressed, would have been included in the latter as  
ofthe objects of a general power to regulate  
trade, is not necessarily impunged by its being so ex­  
pressed. Examples of this sort cannot sometimes  
be easily avoided, and are to be seen elsewhere in  
the Constitution. Thus the power &quot; to define and  
punish offences »gainst the laws of nations,&quot; includes  
the power, afterwards particularly expressed, &quot;to  
make rates concerning captures, Sic. from offending  
neutrals.&quot; So also a power &quot; to coin money&quot; would  
doubtless include that of &quot; regulating its value,&quot;  
had net the latter power been particularly iuserted.

The term taxes, if standing a/one, would certainly  
have included dut.es, imposts and excises. In an­

on exports, See.&quot; Here the two terms are used as  
synonymous And in another clause, where it is said

are found) are to be ascribed, sometimes to the pur­  
pose ol greater caution ; sometimes to the impel tec­  
tions of language, and sometimes to the imperlection  
ot mao himself. In this view of the subject, it was  
quite natural, however certainly the general power  
to regulate trade might include a power to impose  
duties on it, not to omit it in a clause enumerating  
the several modes of revenue, authorized by the

Nor can it be inferred, that a power to regulate  
trade does not involve a power to tax it, from the ;  
distinction made in the original controversy with j  
Great Britain, between a power to regulate trade j  
with the Colonies, and a power to tax them. A pow­  
to regulate trade between différent parts of the  
Empire, was confessedly necessary ; and was ad­  
milted lo lie, as far as that was the case, in the Bi i­  
tish Parliament; the taxing part being at the same  
time denied to tbe Parliament, and asserted to be  
necessarily inherent in the Colonial Legislature, as  
sufficient, and the only safe depositories ot the tax­  
mg power. So difficult was it, nevertheless, lo  
maintain the distinction in practice, that the ingre-j  
dient of revenue was occasionally overlooked or  
disregarded in the British regulations, as iu the du­  
tv on sugar and molasses imported to the Colonics,  
And it was fortunate that the attempt at an internal  
and direct tax ; in the case of the Stamp Art, pro­  
H need a radical examination of the subject before a;

&#x27; own manufactures, to preserve our own commerce,  
&#x27; to raise the value of our own lands we must give  
&#x27; Congress the powers in question &quot;  
By Mr. YVidgery, an opponent. &quot;All we hear is,  
&#x27; that the merchant and farmer will flourish, and  
•that the mechanic and tradesman are to make their  
1 fortunes directly, if the Constitution goes down.  
The Convention of Massachusetts was the only  
one in New England whose debates have been pre­  
But it cannot be doubted that the  
there expressed was common to the other states  
in that quarter, more especially to Connecticut and  
Rhode Island, the most thickly peopled of alt the  
states, anil having, of course, their thoughts most  
turned to the subject of manufactures. A like in­  
ference may be confidently applied to New Jersey,  
whose debates in convention have nut been preserv­  
ed. In the populous and manufacturing state of  
Pennsylvania, a partial account only of the debates  
having been published, nothing certain is knowu of  
what passed in her convention un this point. But  
ample evidence may be found elsewhere, that regu­  
lations of trade, for the encouragement of manufac­  
tures. were considered as within the power to be  
«■ranted to the new Congress, as well as within the  
scope of the national policy. Of tlie states south  
of Pennsylvania, the only two in whose conventions  
the debates have been preserved are Virginia and  
n  
seutl­  
served.  
ment  
  
North Carolina, and from these no adverse mferen­  
ces can he drawn. Nur .» there the slightest ind -  
cat.on that either of tae two states farthest Miuib,  
whc.,6 debates in convent.«.,, if preserved, have not  
been made public, viewed the encouragement of  
manufactures, as not within the general power over  
trade to be transfered to the government of the Urn­  
, * a  
« ß M ,, aye not the power, it is annihtla­  
ted for the nation; a policy without example in any  
other nation, and not within the reason of the soli­  
t ary one in our own. The example alluded to, is  
th / prohibition of a tax on exports, which resulted  
^ the nt i mpo „ s ,b,lity of raising, in that  
mu( j a revenue from the states, proportioned tu  
t|)(j abll|t (0 pa „ j t _ t |, c ability of some being de­

er external to the United States ; the profits from

cape a ()n uxp „ K t 8 . a. tax on imports on the  
other hand, being a tax on consumption, which is in  
proportion to the ability of the consumers, whence­  
s( ,ever derived, was free from that inequality,  
«, If revenue be the sole object of a legitimate  
impost, and the encouragement of domestic articles  
be not within the power of regulating trade, it would  
follow that no monopolizing or unequal regulations  
of foreign nations could be counteracted ; that nei*  
; ther the staple articles of subsistence, nor the essen­  
! tial implements for the public safety, could, under  
j any circumstances, be insured or fostered at home,  
j by regulations of commerce, tile usual and must  
convenient mode of providing for both ; and that  
j the American navigation, though the source of naval  
defence, of a cheapening competition in carrying  
j our valuable and bulky articles to market, and of  
an independent carriage of them during foreign wars,  
when a foreign navigation might be withdrawn.  
must be at once abandoned, or speedily destroyed :  
it being evident that a tonnage duty in foreign ports  
against our vessels, and an exemption from such a  
I duty in our pnrts, in favor of foreign vessels, must  
I have the inevitable effect of banishing ours trom the  
ocean. ,

io assume a power to protect our navigation, and  
the cultivation and fabrication ot all articles requisite  
for the. public safety, as incident to the war power,  
would be a more Utitudinarjr construction of the  
text „ f the constitution, than to consider it as embra­  
ced by the &#x27;pecihed power to regulate trade; apuw­

an object ol the power to regulate trade, is proved  
( the use made of the power for that object, in the

(l|tim w(u . a ani(mg the members of the Federal  
(j 0|Jvcllt j,,n which framed the Constitution, and of  
the state Conventions which ratified it ; each of these  
c | as(ll!S consisting of members who had opposed and  
W | U) | la( j esp (, use( l. the Constitution in itsactual form.  
p does not appear from the printed proceedings of  
()11 that occasion, that the power was deni­  
e j by a ny of them. And it may be remarked, that  
L \icn^b,TS from Virginia, in particular, as well of the  
an ti.f,*deral as the federal party, the names then dis­  
tingmsliing those who had opposed and ihose who  
| )a( f approved the Constitution, did not hesitate to  
p| . upuse duties, and to suggest even prohibitions ill  
| avm . 0 f several articles ot her production. By one  
a ,j ul y was proposed on mineral coal, in favor of the  
Virginia coal pits; by another, a duty on hemp was  
proposed, to encourage the growth of that article,  
and bv a third, a prohibition even of foreign beef  
was suggested, as a measure ol souud policy. {(See  
Lloyd&#x27;s Debate .]  
Â further evidence in support of the constitution­  
al power to protect ami foster mauulactures by reg­  
ulations of trade, an evidence that ought, of itself, to  
settle the question, is the uniform and practical sanc­  
t j ou given to the power, by the General Government,  
f or nearly forty years ; with a concurrence or ac­  
; quiescence of every State Government, throughout  
same period ; ami, it may be added, through all  
d)e vicissitudes of party which marked the period.  
No novel construction, however ingeniously devised,  
or however respectable ami patriotic its patrons, can  
withstand the weight of such authorities, or the un­  
broken currentol&#x27;so prolonged and universal a prac­  
Atid well it is that this cannot be done, with­  
out the intervention of the same authority which  
made the Constitution If it could be so done there  
would be an end to that stability in Government,  
and in Laws, which is essential to good government  
and good laws, a stability, tbe want of which is the  
imputation which has at all times been levelled  
H.rainst Republicanism, with most effect, by its most  
dexterous adversaries. The imputation ought nev­  
er, therefore, to be countenanced, by innovating con­  
structions, without any plea of precipitancy, or a  
paucity uf the constructive precedents they oppose,  
without any appeal to material facts newly brought  
to light ; ami without any claim to a better knowl­  
edge of the original evils and inconveniences, for  
which remedies were needed, the very best keys to  
the true object and meaning of all laws and constitu­  
tions.  
And may it not fairly be left to the unbiassed judg­  
ment of all men of experience and of intelligence,  
to decide, which is most to be relied on for a sound  
and safe test of the meaning of a constitution, a uni­  
lurm interpretation by all the successive authorities  
under it, commencing with its birth, and continued  
Lira long period, through the varied state of politi­  
uce.

revision and control of the Congress.&quot;

To say nothing of the clear indications in the  
•Journal of the Convention of 1787 that tbe clause  
was intended merely to provide for expenses  
ed by particular states, in their inspection laws, and  
in such improvements as they might choose to make  
in their harbours and rivers, with the sanction ol  
Coo-&#x27;ress— objects to which tbe reserved power  
has been applied, in several instances, at tbe re­  
quest of V irgmia and Georgia—how could it ever  
be imagined that any state would wish to tax its  
own trade lor the encouragement of manufactures,  
if possessed of the authority, or could, in fact, do  
so, if wishing it ?  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its own con­  
sumption ; and the net proceeds going according to  
ihc clause, not into its own treasury, but into that ol  
the C. S. the state would tax itself separately for the  
of all the other states ; and as far as  
encouraged, might succeed in

lion of such an expedient to  
But the very sug  
any state, would have an air of mockery, when its ex­  
perienced impracticability is taken mlo view,  
one who recollects or recurs to the period when  
in the individual  
No  
the power over commerce was  
states, and separate attempts were made to tax.  
otherwise regulate it, need be told that the attempts  
were not only abortive, hut, by demonstrating the  
necessity of general and uniform regulations, gave  
the original impulse to the constitutional reform  
which provided for such regulations.  
or  
  
which provided for such regulations.  
To refer a state, therefore, to the excercise of  
a power as reserved to her by the Constitution, the  
impossibility of exercising which was an inducement  
to adopt tne Constitution, is, ol all remedial devices  
the last that ought to be brought forward. And  
what renders it the more extraordinary, is, that, as  
the tax on commerce, as tar as it could be separate­  
ly collected, instead ot belonging to the treasury ot  
the State, as previous to tbe Constitution, would be  
a tribute to tbe United States, tiie State would bo  
in a worse condition, alter the adoption of the Con­  
stitution, than before, in reference to an important  
interest, the improvement of which was a particu­  
lar object in adopting the Constitution.  
Were Congress to make the proposed declara­  
tion of consent to state tariffs in favor of Stale man­  
ufactures, what would be the situation of Stales de­  
riving tlmir foreign supplies through the ports ot  
other States ? It is evident that they might he com­  
pelled to pay, in their consumption of particular ar­  
ticle*, imported, a tax for the common treasury, not  
common to all the States, without having any man­  
ufacture or product of their ow n, to partake ol tile  
contemplated benefit.  
Of the impracticability of separate regulations of  
trade and the resulting necessity, of gen­  
eral regulations, no State was more sensible than  
Virginia. She was accordingly the most earnest  
for granting to Congress a power adequate to the  
object. On more occasions than one in the proceed­  
ings of her Legislative councils it was recited

found, on trial, to require uniformity in their com­  
mercial relations as the only effectual policy for ob­  
taining in the ports of foreign nations of privileges  
reciprocal to those enjoyed by the subjects of such  
nations in die ports of the United Stales ; for pre­  
venting animosities which cannot fail to arise among  
the several States from the interference of partial  
and separate regulations: and from deriving from  
commerce such aids to the public revenue as it  
ought to contribute, ike.  
During thedelays and discouragements experienc­  
ed in the attempts to invest Congress with the ne­  
cessary powers, the State of Virginia made various  
trials of what could be done by her individual laws.  
She ventured on duties and imposts as a source of  
revenue : Resolutions were passed at one tune to  
encourage and protect her own navigation and ship  
building ; and in consequence of complaints and  
petitions from Norfolk, Alexandria, and other  
places, against the monopolizing navigation laws of  
Great Britain, particularly in the trade between the  
United States und the ISritish liest Indies, she de­  
liberated, with a purpose controlled only by thein­  
ellicacy of separate measures, on the experiment of  
forcing a reciprocity by prohibitory regulations of  
her own. [See Journal of the House of Delegates  
in 1785.]  
The effect of her separate attempts to raise reve­  
nue by duties on imports, soon appeared in repre­  
sentations from her merchants, that the commerce  
of the State was banished by them into other chan­  
nels, especially nl Maryland, where imports were  
less burdened diati in Virginia. [See Do. fur 1736.]  
Such a tendency ot separate regulations was in­  
deed too manifest to escape anticipation. Among the  
projects prompted by a want of a Federal authority  
.. over commerce, was that of a concert first proposed  
on the part of Maryland for a uniformity of regula­  
tions between the two States, and Commissioners  
were appointed forthat purpose. It was soon per­  
ceived, however, that the concurrence of Penusyl­  
  
was as

preserved, have not been made public, viewed  
the encouragement of manufactures as not with­  
in the general power over trade to bo transferred  
to the Go\ eminent of the United States.  
B. If Congress have not the power, it is anni­  
hilated for the nation; a policy without example  
in any other nation, and not within the reason of  
tiie solitary oue in our town. The example al­  
luded to, is the proliibt’iou of a tax on exports,  
which resulted from the apparent impossibility of  
rj-iii^. in that mode, a r« venue from the States,  
proportioned to the ability to pay it—the ability  
of some being derived, in a great measure, not  
from their exports, but from their fisheries, from  
their Heights, and from commerce at large, in  
soruo of its blanche8 altogether external to the1  
United States; the profits from all which, being  
invisible and intangible, would escape a tax, on  
exports. A tax on imports on the other hand, be­  
ing a tax on con&gt;&gt;impuon, which is in proportion  
to the ability of the consumers, whenccsover de­  
rived, was free trow that inequality.  
7. If revenue he the sole object of a legitimate  
impost, and the encouragement of domestic arti­  
cles be not lu the power of regulating trade, it  
would follow that no monopolizing or unequal  
regulations of foreign Mimas could he counteract­  
o: that neither the staple articles of subsistence,  
nor the essential implements for the public safety,  
could, under any circumstances, bo insured or  
f &gt; tered at home, by regulations of commerce,  
tin usual and most convenient mode of providing  
for both, and that the American navigation, though  
tin. Miurce of naval defence, of a cheapening com­  
petition in carrying our valuable and bulky articles  
to market, and of on iudependant carriage of them  
during foreign wars, when a foreign navigation  
might bv withdrawn, must ho at once abandoned,  
or speedily destroyed: it being evident that u  
tonnage duty hi foreign ports against our vessels,  
and an exemption from such a duty m our ports,  
in favor of foreign vessels, must have the inevita­  
ble eflect of banishing ours from the ocean.  
To assume a power to protect our navigation,  
.li. 1 the cultivation and fabrication of all articles  
requisite for the public safety, as incident to the  
war power, would he a more latitudinarv construc­  
ti i of the text of the Constitution, than to cou­  
&gt;uler it as embraced by the specified power to  
ri-_;ulatc trade; a power which has been exercised  
bv d! nations for those purposes, and which effects  
tlwse purposes with less of interference with the  
auihoritv * and eonvenieney of the States, than  
might result from internal and direct modes of en­  
couraging the articles, any of which modes would  
be authorized, as fur as deemed &quot;necessary and  
proper, by considering the power as an incidental  
power.  
8. That the encouragement of manufactures  
was an object of the power to regulate trade, is  
proved by the use made of the power for that ob  
ject, in the first session of the First Congress under  
the Constitution; when among the members pres­  
ent were so many who had been members of the  
Federal Convention which framed the Constitu­  
tution, and of the State Conventions which ratifi­  
ed it; each of these olassess consisting also of mem­  
bers who hail opposed and who had espoused, the  
Constitution m its actual form. It does not ap­  
p*ir from the printed proceedings of Congress on  
th »t occasion, that the power was denied by any  
of them. And it may be remarked, that Members  
from Virginia, in particular, as well of the anti-fed­  
eral as the federal party, the names then distin­  
guishing those who had opposed and those who  
had approved the Constitution, did not hesitate to  
proposo duties and to suggest even prohibitions  
m favor of several articles of her production. By  
ono a duty was proposed on mineral coal, in favor  
of the Virginia coal pits; by another, a duty, on  
hemp was proposed, to encourage the growth of  
that article; and by a third, a prohibition even of  
foreign be el&quot; was suggested, as a measure of sound  
[Kilicy. [See Lloyd’s Debates.}  
A further evidence in support of the constitu­  
tional power to protect and foster manufactures  
i bv regulations of trade, an evidence that ought of  
i itself, to settle the question, is the uuiform and  
practised sanction given to the power, by the  
General Government, for nearly forty years; with  
i concurrence or acquiescence of every State  
| Government, throughout the same period; and it  
may be added, through all the vicissitudes of party  
[ which marked tlie period. No novel construc­  
tions, however ingeniously devised, or however  
I respectable and patriotic its patrons, can withstand  
j the weight of such authorities, ortho unbroken  
I current of so prolonged and uni vers id a practice.  
\nd well it is that this cannot be done, without  
j the intervention of the same authority which  
&#x27; made the Constitution. K it could ho so done,  
there would lie an end to the stability in Govern­  
ment, and in Laws, which is essential to good  
government and good laws, a stability, the want  
»f which is the imputation which has a» all times  
be* n levelled against Republicanism, w ith most  
•ff. ct, bv its most dexterous adversaries. The  
imputation ought never, therefore to be counten­  
anced. bv innovating construction, without any  
plea of a precipitancy, or a paucity of the con­  
structive precedents they oppose; without any  
appeal to material facts newly brought to light’;  
ind without any claim to a better knowledge ot  
the original evils and inconveniences, for which  
, remedies were needed, th# very best keys to the  
} true object and meaning ot all laws ami constitu­  
tion!.  
And roav it uot be fairly to the unbiassed judg­  
ment of all men of experience and of intelligence.  
  
to decide, which is most to be relied on for  
sound and safe test of the meaning of a Constitu­  
tion, a uniform interpretation by all the succes­  
-ive authorities under it, commencing with its  
birth, and continued for a long period, through the  
varid state oi political contests; t,r the opiutou of  
every new Legislature, heated as it may be by the  
strife of parties—«r warped, as often happens,  
by theai&#x27;iger pursuit of sonic favorite object—or  
carried away, possibly, by the powerful eloquence  
or captivating address of a few popular state-men  
themselves, perhaps influenced by the same mis­  
leading causes? It the latter test is to prevail,  
every new legislative opinion might make a new  
Const itution, as the foot of every new Chancellor  
would make a new standard of measure.  
It is seen, with no little surprise, that an at­  
tempt has been made, in a highly respectable quar­  
ter, and at length reduced to a resolution, former­  
ly proposed iu Congress, to substitute, for the pow­  
er of Congress to regulate trade so as 10 encour­  
age manufactures, a power in the several States  
to do so, with the consent oftliat hotly; and this  
expedient is derived from a clause iii the tenth  
section of the article first of the Constitution,  
which say-. “No State shall, without the con­  
sent of Congre-s| lav any imports or duties on  
imports, except what may he absolutely necessary  
for executing its inspection laws; and the net  
produce of all duties, and imposts, laid by any  
State ou imports and exports, shall be for the use  
of theTroa-ury of the United States; and all such  
laws shall be subject to the revision and control  
of the Congress.”  
To say nothing of the clear indications in the  
Journal of the Convention of I7&gt;7 ili.it the clause  
was intended merely to provide for expenses in­  
curred by particular States, in their Inspection  
laws, and 111 such improvements as they might  
choose to make in their harbors and rivers, with  
the sanction of Congress-objects to \\ hieli the  
reserved power has been applied, in several in­  
stances, at the request of Virginia and licorgia—  
how could it ever he imagined that any .State  
would wish to tax if&lt;- own trade for the encour­  
agement of manufactures, if possessed of the au­  
tlioritv. or could in fact, do so. ifwi,-hin&lt;r i; ?  
  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its own  
consumption; and the next proceeds &#x27;rum?, accor­  
ding to the clause, not into its own Trea.-urv. but  
into the Treasury of tho United States, the Slate  
would tax itself separately, lbr the equal gain of all  
the other States; and as far as the manufactures,  
so encouraged, might succeed in ultimately increa­  
sing the stock in market, and loweriug the price  
by competition, this advantage, also, procured at  
the sole expense of the State, would he common  
to all others.  
Hut the very suggestion of such an expedient to  
any State, would have an air of mockery, when  
its experienced impracticability is taken into view.  
No one, who recollects or recurs to the period  
when the power over commerce was in the indi­  
vidual States, and separate attempts were made to  
tax, or otherwise regulate it, need he told that the  
attempts were not only abortive, but, by demon-)  
strating the necessity of general and uniform rug- j  
illations, gave the original impulse to tho conati- ,  
tional reform which provided for such regula-j  
turns.  
To refer a State, therefore, to the exercise of a  
power, us reserved to her by the Constitution, the  
impossibility of exercising which was an induce­  
ment to adopt the Constitution, is, of all remedial  
devices, the last that ought to be brought forward.  
And what renders it the more extraordiuary. is,  
that, as the tax on commerce, as far as it could he  
separately collected, instead of belonging t« the  
Treasury ofthe State, as previous to tho Consti­  
tution, would be a tribute to the United States,  
the State would be in a worse condition, after  
the adoption of the Constitution, than before, in  
reference to an important interest, the improve­  
ment of winch was a particular object iu adopting  
the Constitution.  
Were Congress to make the proposed declara­  
tion of consent to state tariffs in favor of State man­  
ufactures, and the permitted attempts did not de­  
feat themselves, what would he the situation of  
States deriving their foreign supplies through the  
ports of other States? It is evident that they  
might be compelled to pay, in their consumption  
of particular articles imported, a tax for the com­  
mon treasu v, not common to all the States, with­  
out having any manufacture or product of their  
own. to partake of the contemplated benefit.  
Of the impracticability of separate regulations  
of trade, and the resulting necessity of general reg­  
ulation®, no State was more sensible than Virginia.  
She was accordingly among the most earnest for  
.ranting to Congress a power adequate to the ob­  
ject. On more occasions than one in the pro­  
ceedings of her Legislative councils it was recited  
“that the relative situation ofthe States had been  
found, on trial to require uniformity iu their com­  
mercial regulations as the only effectual policy for  
obtaining in the ports of foreign nations a stipula­  
tion of privileges reciprocal to those enjoyed by  
the subjects of such nations in the ports of the  
United States; for preventing animosities which  
cannot fail to arise among the several States from  
the interference of partial and separate regulations;  
and for deriving from commerce such aids to the  
public revenue as it ought to contribute, Ac.”  
During the delays and discouragements experi­  
enced in the attempts to invest Congress with the  
necessary powers, the State of Virginia made va­  
rious trials of what could be done by her indiv idual  
laws. She ventured on duties and imposts us a  
source of revenue; Resolutions were passed at  
one time to encourage and protect her ow n navi­  
gation and ship building; and in consequence of  
complaints and petitions from Norfolk, Alexandria,  
and other places, against the monopolizing navi­  
gation laws of Great Britain, particularly in the  
trade between the I&#x27;niUd States and the British  
IVest Indies, she deliberated, with a purpose con­  
| trolled only by the incfficacy ofSeparate measures,  
j on the experiment of forcing a reciprocity by pro­  
| hibitory regulations of her own. [See Journal oi  
&gt; House of Delegates in 17f.”).]  
The effect of her separate attempts to raise re­  
venus bv duties on imposts, soon appeared w re|»­  
resentationa ftom her merchants, that the com- j  
mcrce of the Ftatc was banished by them mto ,  
other channels, especially of .Mary land, where im- j  
torts were le^s hurdeui d than V irginia. [See j  
&gt;o. for 17Mj. j  
Such a tendency of separate regulations was in- j  
deed too manifest to escape anticipation. Among  
the projects prompted by tho want of a Federal  
authority over commerce, was that of a concert  
first proposed on the part of Mary land for an uni­  
formity of regulations between the two States, and  
Commissioners wt re appointed for that purpose.  
It was soon perceived, however, that the concur-j  
fence of Pennsylvania was accordingly invited.  
But Pennsy lvania could no more concur without  
New York than Maryland without PaGOsylvania,  
nor New York w ithjut the concurrence of Boston,  
Ac.  
These projects were superseded for die moment  
by that ofthe Convention at Annapolis in 17H!. A:  
forev cr by tho Convention at Philadelphia in 17o7,  
and tlie Constitution which was the fruit of it.  
There is a passage in Mr. Necker’s work on the  
finances of Franco which affords a -ingle illustra­  
tion ofthe difficulty of collecting, ia contiguous  
comm mities, indirect taxes, when not the same ui  
all. bv the violent means resorted to agaiust smug­  
gling from one to another of them. Previous to  
the fate Revolutionary war iu that country, the  
taxes were of very’ d&amp;eieni rates in the different  
Provinces; particularly the taxon salt, whichwas  
liigh in the interior province* and low&#x27; in the mar­  
itine, a;id the tax on tobacco which was very high  
  
id general, whilst in some of the provinces the us*  
of the article was altogether free. The conse­  
quence was, that the standing ruuiy of patrols a­  
gainst smuggling had swoln to the number ofi  
twenty-three thousand; the annual arrest of men,  
women, aiid children, engaged in smuggling, to  
five thousand five hundred and fitly; and the  
number annually arrested on account of sah and  
tobacco alone, to seventeen or eighteen hundred,  
more than three hundred of whom were consign­  
ed to the terrible puuislunent of the (dallies.  
May it not be regarded as among the providen­  
tial blessings to these States, that their geographi­  
cal relations, multiplied as they will be by ariiti-!  
rial charmed of intercourse, give such additional  
force to the many obligations to cherish that un­  
ion which alone secures their peace, their safety,  
and their prosperity! Apart from the more oh- I  
vious and awful consequences of their entire sep­  
aration into independent sovreignties; it is worthy  
of special consideration, that, divided from each o­  
ther as they must be by narrow waters and terri­  
ton u hues mefelv ficuity of surreptitious imro­  
ducions ol Contraband articles, would defeat eve-1  
ry Ulempt at revenue in the easy and indirect |  
mo&lt;es of impost and ex* isc; so that whilst their  
expenditures would he necessarily and vastly in- j  
croi-eJ by their new situation, thev would in pro-:  
\idmr for them, be limited to direct taxes on land  
or ttlior property, to arbitrary assessments on  
im.-ibl*. funds, and to the odious tax on persons.  
You will observe that I have confined myself,  
in vhat has been said, to I he constitutionality and  
. xpediertey of the power in Congress to encour­  
age domestic products by regulations ofcommerce.  
In the exorcise of the pow. r, tliey are responsible  
to their constituents; whose rights and duty it is, j  
in that as in all other cases, to bring their meas­  
ure- to the test of justice and of the general

Nor can it be inferred, that a power to  
regulate trade does not involve a power to  
tax it. from the distinction misde in the o  
viginal cont oversy with Great Britain, be  
tween a power to reculate trade with the  
Colonies, and a power to tax them. A  
power to reulate trade between different  
ports of the Empire was rnn“&#x27;rnndl, neces  
sary, and was sdmitted to le, as far a»  
that was the case, ia the Uritish Parlia­  
  
ment; the taxing part being at the same  
t 6 denied to the Parliament, and assert.  
0 be necessarly mherent in the Colo  
Legislatures, as sufficient, and the on  
wale depositar.cs of the taxing power.  
ditficolt was it, nevertheless, to maimn  
  
the distiiction i practice, that the in­  
dient of revenue was occasionally over  
sked or disregarded in the British regu-  
Jntions, a 8 in the duty on sugar and mnﬁr  
ses imported into the Colonies. And it  
was fortunate in the attempt at an internal  
and direct tax, in the case of the Stamp  
Act, produced u radical examination of the  
subjeet before a regulation of trade with a  
view revenue had grown into an estos  
blished authority One thing at least is  
certain, that the wain and admitted object  
of the Parliamentary regulations ol trade  
with the Colonies, was the encouragement  
of manujactures in Grent-Britain ‘  
But the present g e&lt;tion w unconnected  
with the foruer relations between Great  
Britain and her colonies, which were of a  
peculiar, &amp; comnplicated, and, in several le­  
spects, of an undefined character ltisa  
simple question under the Constitution ot  
the United States, whether “the power to  
regulate trade with foreign nations’ as a  
distinet and substantive item in the enu­  
urcrated powers embraces the object of  
encouraging by duties, restrictions and  
prohibitions, the manufactures and pro  
ducts of the country? And the stfirmative  
must be inferred from the following consi­  
derations:  
  
). The meaning of the phrase “to reg  
ulate trade,” must be songht in the gene  
ral use ol it; in other words, in the objects  
to which the power was generally under  
stood (0 be applicable whenthe phrase was  
inserted in the Constitution.  
  
2, &quot;The power has been understood and  
used by a!&#x27; commercia and manufacturing  
natong, asembracing the object ot encoor  
aging woanufactures. It 15 believed that  
not a single exception can be named,  
J. Tlos has been particularly the case  
with Great Rritain, whose commercial vo  
eabulary 18 the parent of ours. A prima  
ry object of her commercial regulations is  
well known to have been the protection  
and encouragement of her manufuctures.  
4.&quot; Such was understood to be a proper  
uge of the power by the States most pre  
pared for manufacturing industry, whilst  
retaining the power over thewr foreign  
trade.  
  
5. Such a vse of the power, by Con.  
gress, accords with the intention and ex­  
pectation of the States, in transferring the  
power over trade from themselves to the  
Government of the Umted States. This  
was emphatically the case in the Eastern,  
the more manutacturing Members of the  
Confederacy. Hear the langu ge held in  
the Convennion of Massachuser a,  
  
By Mr. Dawes, an advocate fo¢ the Con.  
stitution, it was observed, *Our manufac  
tures are another great subject which ha  
received no encouragement by national  
duties on fore.gn manufactures, and they  
never can Ly any authonty in the old Con­  
federation” Again, &quot;H), we wish to en­  
courage our own manufactires, to prescrve  
our own ecommerce, to raise the value of  
our own lands, we must give Congress the  
powers in question.”  
By Mr. Wadgery, an opponent: “All we  
heur is, that the merchant and farmer will  
flourigh, and that the mechame and trades  
man are to make their fortunes directly,  
the Constitution goes down.”  
The Convention of Massachusetts wa:  
the only one in New-England whose de  
bates have been preserved. Bot it canno  
be doubted that the sentunent there ex  
pressed was common to the other States in  
thut quarter, more especially to Connecti  
cat and Rhode Island, the most thick!:  
peopled of all the States, atid having, «  
course, theit thonghts most turned to the  
subject of manufactures. A lke infer  
ence may be confidently applied to New  
Jersey, whose debates in Convention hav  
not been preserved. In the populons and  
manufacturing State of Pennsylvania, »  
partial account only of the debates havin;  
been published, nothing certain 18 know  
of what passed in her Convention on this  
[pmm. But ample evidence may be found  
elsewhere, that regulations of trade, for  
the encouragement of manufactures, wer:  
consiiered as within the power to be  
grante! to the new Congress, as well u­  
within the scope of the national policy.  
Of the Swates South of Pennsylvania, the  
only two in whose Conventions the de  
bates have been preserved are Virginio  
and North Carolina, and from these noa.  
verse inferences can be drawn. No

there the shightest indication that eith:  
of the two Ntates farthest South, wh  
debates in Convention, if preserved, hn  
not been made public, viewed the encou  
agement of manufactures as not within 1,  
general power over trade to be tranaferr  
to the Government of the United State:  
  
6. If Congress have not the power  
1% annihilated for the nation; a pohey w 1  
  
ont example in any other nation, and  
(b he peagon oo golitary oné in onr  
own. The example alluded to is the pro  
hibition of a tax on exports, which resalt |  
ed from the apparent impossibiln:; of rais l  
ing, in that mode, a revenue from the  
States proportioned to the ability to pay »  
~the ability of some being derived, in »  
&#x27;:::&#x27;l measure, not from their exports, but  
their fisheries, from their freights,  
and from commerce at large, in some of its  
Branches altogether external to the United  
States; the profits from al)l which, being  
invigible and infangible, wonld escape »  
’ux, on exports. A tax on imports, on the  
other hand, being a tax on consumption,  
which is in frroportion to the ability of the  
consumers,whencesoover derived, was free  
from that inequality. &#x27;  
|7 M revenue be the sole object of a  
legiimate inpost, and the encouragement  
ol domestie urticies e not within the pow.  
er of regulnting trade, it wonld follow that  
no monopelizing or unequal regulations of  
t foreign nations could be counteracted; that  
neither the staple articles of subsistence,  
nur the essential implements for the public  
safety, conld, under any circuomstances, be  
insured or fostored at home, by regulations  
of commerce, the vsual and most conveni­

when &amp; foreign narigafion might be with.  
wn. wmust be at once abandoned, or  
speedily dedrqed; it being evident that »  
mum’o duty in foreign ports against our  
vessels, and an exemption from such a Ju-  
Ly in vur ports, in favor of foreign vessels,  
jmust bave the inevitable effect of banish  
ing ours from the ocean.  
I&#x27;v assume a power tc protect our navi  
gation, and the cultivation and fabrication  
ol all articies requisite for the public safe  
ty, as incident to the war power, would be  
s more latijudinary construction of the text  
ol the Coustitution, than to consider it as  
cmbraced by the epecified powet to regu.  
lute trude; a power which has been exer­  
cised by all nations for those purposes,and  
which effects those purposes with less of  
interference with the authority and con­  
veniency of the States, than might result  
from mternal and direct modes of encour- |  
aging the articles, any of which modes  
would be authorized, as [ar as deemed ‘ne.  
cessary and proper,’ by considering the |  
power as an incidental power.  
8. ‘That the encouragement of manu  
factures was an object of the powerto reg  
ulate trade, 1s proved by the use made of  
the power for that object, in the first ses.  
sion of the first Congress under the Con.  
stitution; when among the members pws-&#x27;  
ent were so many who had been members |  
of the Federal Convention which framed  
the Constitution, and of the State Conven­  
tons which ratified it: each of these clas.  
ses consisting also of members who had op’  
posed and who had esponsed the Constitu­  
tion in its actual form. It does not appear  
from the printed procecdings of Congress |  
on that occasion, that the power was de |  
vied by any of thews. And it may be re-|  
marked, that members from Virginia, in/  
particular, as well as of the anti-federal as |  
the federal party, the names then distin &#x27;  
guighing those who had opposed und those |  
who had apptoved the Constitution, did not |  
hesitate to propose duties and 1o suggest  
even prohibitions in favor of several arti  
cles of her production. By one a duty was  
proposed on mineral coal, in fuvor of the  
Virgima codl pits; by another, a duty on  
hemp was proposed, to encourage the !  
growth of that article; and by a third, a  
prohibition eren of foreign beef was sog |  
gesled. as a meagure of sound policy. [See  
loyd&#x27;s Debates, | ‘  
A further evilence in support of the&#x27;  
constitutional power to protect and foster  
manufacturés by regulations of trade, an  
evidence that ought of itself to settie the  
question, in the uniform and practical sanc­  
tion given to the power, by the Geners)  
Government, for nearly forty years; with  
a concurrence of acquiescence of every |  
Government, throughout the same period; |  
and, it may be added. through all the vi |  
cissitudes of party which marked the pe 1

geniobsly devised, or hewever respectable  
and patriotieits patrons, can withstand the |  
weight of such authorities, or the unbroken  
carrent of so prolonged and universal a  
practice. And well it is that this cannot

it all times heen levelled against Republi  
qanism, with most effect by its most dex

never, therefore, to be countenanced, by

wnd meaning of all laws and constitutions.  
And it may not be fairly left to the un­  
nassed judgment of all men of experience  
and of intelligence, to decide, which is  
most to be relied on for a sound and safe  
test of the meaning of a Constitution, a uni  
form interpretation by all the successive  
authorities under it, commencing with its  
hirth. and continued for a long period,  
through the varied state of palitical con.

the eager pursuit of some favorite object—

nlate trade 80 as to encouraoe many |  
actures, &amp; power in the several States to  
‘o 80, with the consent of that body; and  
his expedient is derived from a clause in  
ne tenth section of artiele first of the Con­  
stitution, which says: “ No State shall,  
vithout the consent of Congress, lay any  
mposts or duties on imports or exports,  
except what may be absolutely necessary  
for executing its inspection laws; and the  
net produce of all duties and imposts, laid  
by any State on imporis and exports, shall |  
be for the use of the Treasury of the Uni­  
ted States; and all such laws shall be sub.  
ject to the revision and control of the  
Congress.” |  
To say nothin&#x27;g of the clear indications  
in the Journal of the Conventions of 1787,  
that the clause was intended merely to  
provide for expenses incurred by particu­  
lar States, in their inspection laws, and in  
such improvements as +key might choose  
to make in their harbors and rivers, with  
the sanction of Congress—objects to which  
the reserved power has been applied, in

nin and Georgia— how could it even be im  
sgined tiat un‘( State would wish to tax  
‘its own trade for the encouragement of

they might be compelied to pay, in their|  
consumption of particular articies .mported,  
a tax for the common treasury, nol com- ‘  
mon to all the St tes, withovt having eny  
manufacture or product of their own, to  
partake of the contemplated benefit, &#x27;  
Of&#x27;the :mpracticabihty of reparate régu- ‘  
lations of trade, und the resulting necessi­  
-Ity of general regulations, no State was  
‘more sensible than Virgima. She was,  
‘accordingly, among the most earnest for  
granting to Congress a power adequate to  
‘the object. On more occasions than one,  
‘in the proceedings of her legislative coun­  
cils, it was recited ‘ahat the relative situa 4  
‘tion of the States had been found, on trial,  
‘to require uniformity in their commercial  
‘regulnlmns as the only effectual policy for‘  
obtatning, in the ports of foreign nations, a  
stipulation of privileges reciprocal to thoso‘  
‘enjoyed by the subjects of such nations in  
&#x27;the ports of the {Jmted States; for pre-1  
| yenting animosities which cannot fail to a­  
risc among the several States from the in­  
&quot;teiference of partial and separate regula­  
l tiong; and for deriving from commerce such  
aids to the pnblic revenue as it ought to  
f contribute, &amp;c.”  
During the delays and discouragzements  
exxwru-vf&quot;% in the attempts to invest Con  
gress with the necessary powers, the State  
of Virginia made various trials of what  
could be done by her individual laws. She  
ventnred on duties and imposts as a gource  
of revenue: Resolutions were passed atone  
tume to encourage and protect herown nav­  
igation aud ship building; and in conse-l  
quwnce of complaints and petitions from  
‘Nurfolk, Alexandria, and other places, a- |  
gainst the monopolizing navigation laws of  
!Great Britain, particularly in the trade be  
| tween the United Stales and the British  
‘ Mest Indies,she dehberated, with a purpose  
controlled only by the efficacy of sepa.  
f rate measures, cn the experiment of foreing  
ia reciprocity by prohibtory regulations of  
| her own, gb‘ee Journal of House: of Dele.  
‘gotes in 1785.]  
&#x27; The effect of her separate attempts to  
| rafse revenue by duties on imports, soon  
| appeared in representations from her mer  
| chants, that the commerce of the State was  
banished by them mto other channels, es  
pecially ot Maryland. where imports were  
&#x27; less burdened thamin Virginia. [See Doc­  
| ament tor 1786, )  
| Sucha tendency of separate regulations  
&#x27; was indced too manifest (o escape anticipa­  
|tion. Among the projects prompted by the  
‘wantof a Federalanthor.ly over commerce,  
&#x27; was that of a concert first propnsed on the  
| part of Maryland for a uniformity of regula.  
tions between the two States, and Commis­  
sioners were appointed for that purpw  
wias soon pereeived, however, that the con­  
currence of Pennsylvania was :; rcessary  
to Marvland as of Maryland to Virginia,and  
the «~ogcurn&#x27;nce of l&#x27;a)‘nnsyh&#x27;lnh “W“  
cordingly invited. But Pennsylvanisconld  
no more concur without New York thas  
Maryland without Pennsylvania, nor New  
Yorkwithont the concurrenceof Bo c.  
These projects were saperseded 108 the  
tmoment by that of the Convention |

Mine in all. by the violent mean* resoiled  
to against smuggling from one to another of;  
them. Previous to i he late Revolutionary war;  
in that country, the tales were of very ditf* r- I  
ent rates in the different Provinces ; particular- 1  
ly the tai on salt, which was high in the  
interior provinces and low iu the maritime and &#x27;  
the tai on tobacco, which was very high in gen- \
eral whilst in some of the provinces the use of  
the article was altogether free. The const*-1  
queiice &quot;as, that the standing army of patrol*

twenty three thousand ; the annual arrest ol

Alay it not be regarded hs among the provi­

additional force to the many obliga&#x27;ions to cbe­

what passed in her Convention On this point&#x27;  
  
mn ampie evidence may oe touna esewiiere,  
that regulations of trade, for the encouragement  
of manufactures, were considered ?s within the  
  
power to be granted to the. new Congress, as  
well as Within theVcope of the national oolicv.  
  
Of the States south of Pennsylvania, tlie only two  
  
tn .wuoae tjonyentions the debates have been  
preserved are Virginia and North-Carolina, and  
  
from these no adverse inferences can be drawn.  
  
Nor is there the slightest indication that either of  
  
the two States farthest South, whose debates in  
Convention, if preserved, have not been made  
  
public, viewed thencouragement oliminufHc­  
tures, as not within the general power over trade  
to !e transferred to the Government of the  
  
United States.  
  
6. If Congress have not the power, it is anni-  
  
uiiaicu mr tne. nanon ; a poncy without example  
  
w any oiner nation, and not within the rtason  
  
of the solitary ne incur own. , The example  
alluded to, is the prohibition of a tax on experts,  
  
which resulted trora the, apparent impossibility  
of raising, in that . mode,&#x27; a revenue from the  
  
States, proportioned to the&#x27;ability to pay it the  
ability of some being derived, in a great mea­  
sure, not from their exports, but from their fish-  
  
cries, from ibeir freights, and from commerce at  
large; in some of its branches altogether exter­  
nal to the United States ; the profits! from all  
  
Which, oemg invisible and intangible,, would es­  
cape a tax, on exports. A tux on imports on the  
  
other bad,Jjeinpa tax on consumption, which  
  
wmproporuon to the ability qt the consumers,  
  
wnencesoever derived, was free from that  
equality v , .  
  
7. If revenue be thesole objecof a legitimate  
impost, and the encouragement or domestic ar-  
  
ticksbe not within the power of regulating trade,  
Uwould follow that no monopoliaMner or unedual  
  
regulations -of foreign nations could be counter  
  
acted t that neither the staple articles of sib­  
sistenca, nor the essential implements for the  
public safety, could, under anv circumstances.  
  
be insured or fostered at home, by regulations of  
  
commerce, tne utual and most convenient mode  
of providing for both and that the American  
  
navigation, though the source of naval defence,  
of a cheapening competition in carrying our val­  
uable and bulky articles to market, and of an in­  
dependent carriage of them during foreign wars,  
when a foreign navigation might be withdrawn,  
must be at once abandoned, or speedily des­  
troyed : it being evident that a tonnage duty in  
foreign ports against our vessels, and ah exemn  
  
tion from such a duty m favor of foreign vessels.

musV have the inevitable effect of banishing ours  
  
To assume a power to protect our navigation,  
and the cultivation and fabrication of all articles  
requisite for the public safety,, as incident to the  
war power, would be a morejjatitudinary con  
struction cf the text of the Constitution-than to  
consider it as embraced by the specifiod power  
to regulate trade i a power which has been exer­  
cised by all nations for those purposes, and which  
effects those purposes with less of interference  
with the authority and conveniency of the States,  
than might result from internal and direct mode  
would be authorized,as far as deemed unneces­  
sary and proper,&quot; by considering the power ias  
an incidental power. &#x27; - l&#x27;  
Y 8. That the encouragement of manufactures  
was an object of the power to regulate trade, is  
proved by the use made of the. power for that  
object, in the first session of the First Congress  
under the Constitution ; when among the mem­  
bers . present Were; so many who had been mem­  
bers of the Federal Convention which framed  
the Constitution, and of the State Conventions  
which ratified it i each of these classes consisting  
also of members who had opposed and who had  
espoused,1-the Constitution in its actual form.-  
It does not appearfrom the printed proceedings  
of Congress-on that occasion, that the power was  
denied byahy of them. And it ay be remark

nia and Georgia how could it ever be ima  
  
gined that any State would wish to tax its  
  
own trade for the encv-urageinent oi man  
  
ufactures if possessed of the authority, or  
  
could, in lact, do so, it wishing it f  
  
A t iX on imports would be a tax on its  
own consump ion ; and the uet proceeds  
going, according to the clause, nut into its  
  
own treasury, but into the treasury of th-.  
  
United States, the State would tat itself  
  
separately for the equal gaio of all the o-  
  
thcr states ; and as tar as the mauufac  
  
tures, so encouraged, might succeed in ul  
  
timately increasing the stock, in market,  
  
and towering the price by competition,  
  
ihis advantage, also, procured at the sole  
  
expense of the State, would be common to  
all the others.  
But the very suggestion of such an ex­  
pedient to any St;te, would have ah air of  
mockery, when its experienced impractica­  
bility is taken into view. one, who  
recollects or recurs to the period when the  
power over commerce was in ihe individu­  
al States, and separate attempts were made  
to tax, or otherwise regulate it, ned . be  
told that the attempts were not only abor­  
live, but,1-by demonstrating ltthe necessity  
of general and uniform regulations gave  
the originar impulse to the constitutional  
reform which provided fur suchregulations.  
  
To refer a State, therefore, to the exer  
  
cise f a pqver, as reserved to her by the  
Constitution, the impossibility of exercising  
which was an inducement &quot; to adopt the  
Constitution, is, of all remedial devices,  
the lat that ought to be brought forward.  
And what renders it tite more extraordina­  
ry, is, that, as the tix on commerce, as far  
as it could be separately collected, insceld  
ofIS? longing to the Treasury of the State,  
a previous to the Constitution, would be a  
tribute to the United Stites, the State would  
  
vbe in a worse condition, alter the adoption  
  
or tne Constitution, than before in refer

Montpelieu, Sept. 18, 1828.&#x27;  
Dear Sir : Your late letter reminds me of our  
conversation on the constitutionality of the power  
in Congress to impose a tariff for tho encourage­  
ment of manufactures ; and of my promise to  
sketch the grounds of the confident opinion I  
had expressed, that it was among the powers  
vested in that body. I had not forgotten my  
promise, and had even begun the task of fulfill­  
ing it; but frequent interruptions, from other  
causes, being followed by a bilious indisposition,  
I have not been able sooner to comply with your  
request. The subjoined view of the subject  
niidit have been advantageously expanded ; but  
I leave that improvement to your own reflections  
and researches.  
The Constitution vests in Congress, expressly,  
the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im­  
posts, and excises;&quot; and &quot;the power to regu­  
late trade.&quot;  
That the former power, if not particularly ex­  
pressed, would have been included in the latter  
as one of the objects of a general power to regu­  
iHte trade, is not necessarily impugned by its  
being so expressed. Examples of this sort can­  
not sometimes be easily avoided, and are to be  
seen elsewhere in the Constitution. Thus the  
power &quot;to define and punish offences against the  
law of nations,&quot; includes the power, afterwards  
particularly expressed, &quot;to make rules concern­  
ing captures, &amp;c. from offending neutrals.&quot; So  
also a power &#x27; to coin money&quot; would doubtless  
include that of &quot; regulating its value,&quot; had not  
the lattef power been expressly inserted. The  
term taxes, if standing alone, would certainly  
have included duties, imposts, and excises. In  
another clause it is said, &quot;no tax or duties shall  
be laid on exports, &amp;c.&quot; Here the two terms are  
used as synonymous. And in a another clause,  
where it is said &quot; no State shall lay any imposts,  
or duties, &amp;c.&quot; the terms imposts and duties are  
synonymous. Pleonasms, tautologies, and the  
promiscuous use of terms and phrases, differing  
in their shades of meaning, (always to be ex­  
pounded with reference to the context and under  
the control of the general character and manifest  
scope of the instrument in whicli they are found)  
are to be ascribed, sometimes to the purpose of  
greater caution ; sometimes to the imperfections  
Ml lullguatt;, aiiu airuiuuiuca lu 4110 impi ibviivu  
of man himself. In this view of the subject, it  
was quite natural, however certainly the general  
power to reg&#x27;date trade might include a power to  
impose duties on it, not to omit it in a clause  
enumerating the several modes of revenue, au­  
thorised by the Constitution. In few cases could  
the &quot;ex majori cautela&quot; occur with more claim  
to respect.  
Nor can it be inferred, that a power to regu­  
late trade does not involve a power to tax it,  
from the distinction made in the original contro  
versy with Great Britain, between a power to  
regulate trade with the Colonies, and a power to  
tax them. A power to regulate trado between  
different parts of the Empire, was confessedly  
v-eccssary ; and was admitted to lie, as far as  
that was the case, in the British rarliament ; the  
taxing part being at the same time denied to the  
Parliament, and asserted to do necessarily inne  
rent in the Colonial Legislatures, as sufficient  
&quot;and the only safe depositories of &#x27;the taxing  
power. So difficult was it, nevertheless, to  
maintain the distinction in practice, that the in  
gredient of revenue was occasionally overlooked  
or disregarded in the British regulations, as in  
the duty on sugar and molasses imported into the  
Colonies. And it was fortunate that the attempt  
at an internal and direct tax, in the case of  
the Stamp Act, produced a radical examination  
of the subject before a regulation of trade  
with a view to revenue had grown into an estao  
lished authority. One thing at least is certain,  
that the main and admitted object of the Parlia­  
mentary regulations of trado with the Colonies,  
was the encouragement of manvfactures in Great  
Britain.  
But the present question is unconnected with  
the former relations between Great Britain and  
her colonies, which were of a peculiar, a com  
plicated, and, in several respects, of an undefined  
character. It is a simple question under the  
Constitution of the United States, whether &quot; the  
power to regulate trade with foreign nations&quot; as  
a distinct and substantive item in the enumerated  
  
powers embraces the object pf, encouraging by  
duties,&#x27; restrictions and prohibitions, tho manu­  
factures and products of the country t And the  
affirmative must&quot; be&#x27;1 inferred from the following  
considerations: , , . . ; ; ,, - , -v  
l.-The meaning of the&#x27; phrase &quot;to regulate  
trade,&quot; roust be sought in the general use of itj  
in&#x27; other words,&#x27; in tho objects to which &quot;the  
power was generally understood ta be applicable,  
when the phrase was inserted in the Constitu­  
tion. ; - . :  
&#x27;2. The power has been understood and used  
by all commercial and manufacturing nations, as  
embracing the object of encouraging manufac­  
tures. It is believed that not a single exception  
can be named. &quot;y .v.&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;:. , &#x27;  
iL This has been particularly the case with  
Great Britain,&#x27; whose commercial vocabulary is  
the parent of ours. A primary object of her  
commercial regulations is well known to have  
been the protection and encouragement of her  
manufactures. - . n &quot; . ; &quot;  
4. Such was understood to be a proper use of  
the power by the States most prepared for manu­  
facturing industry,&#x27;. wbiUt retaining the power  
over their foreign trade. &quot; &#x27; &quot;&#x27; &#x27;  
5. Such a use of the power, by Congress, ac­  
cords with tho intention and expectation of the  
States, in transferring the power over trade from  
themselves to the Government of the United  
  
Mates. This was emphatically the case in the  
Eastern, the more manufacturing Members of  
the Confederacy. Hear the language held in  
the Convention of Massachusetts.  
By Mr. Dawes, an advocate for the Constitu  
tion, it was observed, &quot;Our manufactures are  
&quot; another great subject which has received no  
&quot;encouragement by, national duties on foreign  
&quot; manufactures, and they never can by any au­  
&quot; thority in the old Confederation.&quot; Again,  
&quot;If we wish to encourage our own manufactures,  
&quot; to preserve our own commerce, to raise the  
&quot; value of our own lands, we must give Congress  
the powers in question.  
By Mr. VVidgery, an opponent : &quot; All we hear  
is, that the merchant and farmer will flourish,  
&quot; and that the mechanic and tradesman are to  
&quot; make their fortunes directty, if the Constitu­  
&quot; tion goes down.&quot;  
The Convention of Massachusetts was the  
only one in New England whose debates have  
been preserved. But it cannot b6 doubted that  
the sentiment there expressed was common to  
the other States in that quarter, more especially  
to Connecticut and Rhode Island, the most  
thickly peopled of all the States, and having, of  
course, their thoughts most turned to the subject  
of manufactures. A like inference may be con­  
fidently applied to New Jersoy, whose debates  
in Convention have not been preserved. In the  
populous and manufacturing State of Pennsyl­  
vania, a partial account only of tlto debates ha­  
ving been published, nothing certain is known  
of what passed in her Convention on this point.  
But ample evidence may be found elsewhere,  
that regulations of trade, for the encouragement  
of manufactures, were considered as within the  
power to be granted to the new Congress, as  
well as within the scope of the national policy.  
Of the States South of Pennsylvania, the only  
two in whose Conventions tho debates have been  
preserved, are Virginia and North Carolina, and  
from these no adverse inferences can be drawn.  
Nor is there the slightest indication that either  
of the two States farthest South, whose debates  
in Convention, if preserved, have not been made  
public, viewed the encouragement of manufac­  
tures, as not within the general powerover trade  
to be iransferred to the Government of the Uni­  
ted States.  
6. If Congress have not the power, it is anni­  
hilated for tho nation; a policy without example  
in any other nation, and not within the reason  
of the solitary one in our own. The example  
alluded to, is the prohibition of a tax on exports,  
which resulted from the apparent impossibility  
of raising, in that mode, a revenue from the  
States, proportioned to the ability to pay it the  
ability of some being derived, in a great mea­  
sure, not from their exports, but from their fishe­  
ries, from their freights, and from commerce at  
large, in some of its branches altogether external  
to theUnited States ; tho profits from all which,  
being invisible and intangible, would escape a  
tax, on exports. A tax on imports on the other  
hand, being a tax on consumption, which is in  
proportion to the ability df Hie consumers,  
whencesoever derived, was free from that ine­  
quality.7. If revenue be the sole object of a legiti­  
mate impost, and the encouragement of domes­  
tic articles be not within the power of regulating  
trade, it would follow that no monopolizing or  
unequal regulations of foreign nations could bo  
counteracted ; that neither the staple articles of  
subsistence, nor the essential implements for the  
public safety, could, under any circumstances,  
be insured or fostered at home, by regulations  
of commerce, the usual and most convenient  
mode of providing for both ; and that the Ame­  
rican navigation, though the source of naval de­  
fence, of a cheapening competition in carrying  
our valuable and bulky articles to market, and  
of an independent carriage of them during fo­  
reign wars, when a foreign navigation might be  
withdrawn, must be at once abandoned, or spee­  
dily destroyed: it being evident that a tonnage  
duty in foreign ports against our vessels, and an  
exemption from such a duty in our ports, in favor  
of foreign vessels, must have the inevitable ef­  
fect of banishing ours from the ocean.  
To assume a power to protect our navigation,  
and the cultivation and fabrication of all articles  
requisite for the public safety, as incident to the  
war power, would be a more latitudinary con­  
struction of the text of the Constitution, than to  
consider it as embraced by the specified power  
to regulate trade ; a power which has been exer­  
cised by all nations for those purposes, and which  
effects those purposes with less of interference  
with the authority and conyeniency of the States,  
than might lesult from internal and direct modes  
of encouraging the articles, any of which modes  
would be authorized, as far as deemed &quot; neccs-  
  
$ary and proper,&quot; by considering the power , as  
an incidental power. . !.  
, &#x27; 8. That i the encouragement of manufactures  
was an object of the power to regulate trade, is  
proved by the use made of the power for that  
object, in the 6rst session of, the First Congress  
under the Constitution ; when among the mem­  
bers present were so many who had been mem­  
bers of the Fedoral Convention which framed  
the Constitution, and of the State Conventions  
which ratified it ; each of these classes consisting  
also of membecs who had opposed and who had  
espoused, the Constitution in its actual form.  
It does not appear from the printed proceedings  
of Congress on that &#x27;occasion, that the power  
was denied by any of them. And it may be re­  
marked, that Members from Virgiuia, in particu­  
lar, as well of the anti-federal as the federal  
party, die names then distinguishing those who  
bad ppposod and those who had approved the  
Constitution, did not hesitate to propose duties  
and to suggest even prohibitions in favour of  
several articles of her production. By one a  
duty was proposed on mineral coal, in favour of  
the Virginia coal pits; by another, a duty on  
hemp was proposed, to encourage the growth of  
that article; and by a third, a prohibition even  
of foreign beef whs suggested, as a measure  
of sound policy. See Lloyd&#x27;s Debates.  
A further evidence in support of the constitu­  
tional power to protect and foster manufactures  
by regulations of trade, an evidence that ought,  
of itself, to settle tho question, is the uniform  
and practical sanction given to the power, by tho  
General Government, for nearly forty years;  
with a concurrence or acquiescence of every  
State Government, throughout the samo period;  
and, it may be added, through all the vicissitudes  
of party which marked the period. No novel  
construction, however ingeniously devised, or  
however respectable and patriotic its patrons,  
can withstand the weight of such authorities, or  
the unbroken current of so prolonging and uni­  
versal a practice. And well it is that this can­  
not bo done, without the intervention of the  
same authority which made the Constitution. If  
it could be so done, there would be an end to  
that stability in Government, and in Laws, which  
is essential to good government and good laws, a  
stability, the want of which is the imputation  
which has at all. times been levelled against Re­  
publicanism, witli most effect, by its most dex­  
trous adversaries. The imputation ought never,  
therefore, to be .countenanced, by innovating  
constructions, without any ph-a of aprccipitan-C3-,  
or a paucity of the constructive precedents  
they oppose ; without any appeal to material  
facts rewly brought to light ; and without any  
claim to a better knowledge of the original evils  
and inconveniences, for which remedies were  
needed, tho very best keys to the true object  
and meaning of all laws and constitutions.  
And may it not be fairly left to the nnbiassed  
judgment of all men of experience and of intelli­  
gence, to decide, whicli is most to be relied on  
for a sound and safe test of the meaning of a  
Constitution, a uniform interpretation by all the  
successive authorities under it, commencing with  
its birth, and continued for a long period, through  
the varied state of political contests ; or the  
opinion of every new Legislature, heated as it  
may be by the strife of parties or warped, as  
often happens, by tho eager pursuit of some fa­  
vourite object or carried away, possibly, by the  
powerful eloquence or captivating address of a  
few popular statesmen, themselves, perhaps, in­  
fluenced by the same misleading causes? If the  
latter test is to prevail, every new legislative  
opinion might make a new Constitution, as the  
fool of every new Chancellor would make a  
new standard of measure.  
It is seen, with no little surprise, that an at­  
tempt has been made, jn a highly respectable  
quarter, and at length reduced to a resolution,  
formally proposed in Congress, to substitute, for  
the power of Congress to regulate trade so as to  
encourage manufactures, a power in the several  
States to do so, with the consent of that body ;  
and this expedient is derived from a clause in  
the tenth section of article first of the Constitu­  
tion, which says : &quot; No State shall, without the  
consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties  
on imports or exports, except what may be ab­  
solutely necessary for executing its inspection  
laws; and the nctt produce of all duties, and  
imposts, laid by any State on imports and ex­  
ports, shall be for the use of the Treasury of the  
United States ; and all such laws shall be subject  
to the revision and controul of the Congress.&quot;  
To say nothing of the clear indications in the  
Journal of the Convention of 1787, that the  
  
clause was intended merely to provide for ex­  
penses incurred by particular States, in their In­  
spection laws, and in such improvements as they  
might choose to make in their harbours and ri­  
vers, with the sanction of Congress objects to  
which the reserved power has been applied, in  
several instances, at the request of Virginia and  
Georgia how could it ever be imagined that  
any State would wish to tax its own trade for the  
encouragement of manufactures, if possessed of  
the authority, or could, in fart, do so, &#x27;if wish­  
ing it!  
A tax on imports would bo a tax on its own  
consumption ; and the nett proceeds going, ac­  
cording to the clause, not into its own Treasury,  
but into the Treasury of the United States, the  
State would tax itself separately for the equal  
gain of all the other States ; and as far as the  
manufactures, so encouraged, might succeed in  
ultimately increasing the stock in market, and  
lowering tho price by competition, this advantage,  
also, procured at the sole expense of the State,  
would be common to all the others.  
But the very suggestion of such an expedient  
to any State, would have an air of mockery, when  
its experienced impracticability L taken into view.  
No one, who recollects or recurs to the period  
when the power over commerce was in the indi­  
vidual States, and separate attemps were made to  
tax, , or othenviso regulate it, need be told that  
the attempts were not only abortive, but, by de­  
monstrating the necessity of general and uni­  
form regulations, gave the original impulse to the  
  
constitutional reform, which providedfor such re­  
gulations.. &#x27; &quot;-.I- : .;:.-v; &#x27; ,

, To refer a State, therefore, to the exercise of  
a power, as reserved toJier by tho Constitution,  
the impossibility of exercising which was an in  
ducement to adopt the Constitution, is, of all re­  
medial devices, the last that ought to be brought  
forward. And what renders it the more extraor­  
dinary, is, that, as the tax on commerce, as far as  
it could be separately collected, instead of be­  
longing to tho Treasury of the State, as previous  
to the Constitution, would be a tribute to the Uni­  
ted States, the State would be in a worse condi­  
tion, after the adoption of the Constitution, than  
before, in referenco to an important interest, the  
improvement of which was a particular object in  
adopting the Constitution. -  
Wero Congress to make the proposed declara­  
tion of consent to state tariffs in favour of State  
manufactures, and the permitted attempts did not  
defeat themselves, what would be tho situation  
of States deriving their foreign supplies through  
the ports of other States t It is evident that  
they might be compelled to pay, in their con­  
sumption of particular articles imported, a tax  
for the common treasury, not common to all the  
States, without having any manufacture or pro­  
duct of their own, to partake of the contemplated  
benefit. , . .  
Of the impracticability of separate regulations  
of trade, and the resulting necessity of general  
regulations, no State was more sensible than  
Virginia. , She was accordingly among the most  
earnest for granting to Congress a power adequate  
to the object. On more occasions than one in  
the proceedings of her Legislative councils it was  
recited &quot; that the relative situation of the States  
had been found, on trial, to require uniformity m  
their commercial regulations as the only effectual  
policy for obtaining in the -ports of foreign na­  
tions a stipulation of privileges reciprocal to those  
enjoyed by the subjects of such nations in the  
ports of the United Slates ; for preventing ani­  
mosities which cannot fail to ariso among the  
several States from the interference of partial and  
separate regulations ; and for deriving from com­  
merce such aids to the public revenue as it ought  
to contribute, &amp;c.&quot;  
During the delays and discouragements expe­  
rienced in the attempts to invest Congress&#x27; with  
the necessary powers, the State of Virginia made  
various trials of what could be done by her indi­  
vidual laws. She ventured on duties and im­  
posts as a source of revenue : Resolutions were  
passed at one time to encourage and protect her  
own navigation and ship building ; and in conse­  
quence of complaints and petitions from Norlolk,  
Alexandria, and other places, against the mono­  
polizing navigation laws of Great Britain, parti­  
cularly in the trado between the United States  
and the British West Indies, she deliberated,  
with a purpose controlled only by the inefneacy  
  
of separate measures, on the experiment, of  
forcing a reciprocity by prohibitory regulations of  
her own. See Journal of House of Delegates  
in 1785.  
The effect of her separate attempts to raise re­  
venue by duties on imports, soon appeared in re­  
presentations from her merchants, that the com­  
merce of the State was banished by them into  
other channels, especially of Maryland, where  
imports were less burdened than in Virginia.  
See Do. for 178G.  
Such a tendency of separate regulations was in­  
deed too manifest to escape anticipation. Among  
the projects prompted by the want of a Federal  
authority over commerce, was that of a concert  
first proposed on the part of Maryland for a uni­  
formity of regulations between the two States, and  
Commissioners were appointed for that purpose.  
It was soon perceived, however, that the concur­  
rence of Pennsylvania was as necessary to Mary­  
land as of Maryland to Virginia, aud the concur­  
rence of Pennsylvania was accordingly invited.  
But Pennsylvania could no more concur without  
New York than Maryland without Pennsylvania,  
nor New York without the concurrence of Bos­  
ton, &amp;c.  
These projects were supeiseded for the mo­  
ment by that of the Convention at Annapolis in  
1786, and forever by the Convention at Phila­  
delphia in 1787, and the Constitution which was  
the fruit of it.  
There is a passage in Mr. Neckcr&#x27;s work on  
the finances of France whicli affords a signal illus­  
tration of the difficulty of collecting, in contigu­  
ous communities, indirect taxes, when not the  
same in all, by the violent means resorted to  
against smuggling from one to another of them.  
Previous to the late Revolutionary war in that  
country, the taxes were of very different rates in  
the different Provinces; particularly the tax on  
salt, which was high in the interior provinces and  
low in the maritime, and the tax on tobacco,  
which was very high in general, whilst in some of  
the provinces the use of the article was altogether  
free. The consequence was, that the standing  
army of patrols against smuggling had swoln to  
the number of twenty-three thousand ; the annu­  
al arrest of men, women, and children, engaged  
in smuggling, to five thousand five hundred and  
fifty; and the number annually arrested on ac­  
count of salt and tobacco alone to seventeen or  
eighteen hundred, more than three hundred of  
whom were consigned to the terrible punishment  
of the Gallics.  
May it not be regarded as among the providen­  
tial blessings to these States, that their geogra­  
phical relations, multiplied as they will be by ar­  
tificial channels of intercourse, give such addi­  
tional force to tho many obligations to cherish  
that union whicli alone secures their peace, their  
safety, and their prosperity ! Apart from the  
moro obvious and awful consequences of their  
entire separation into independent sovereignties,  
it is worthy of special consideration, that, divided  
from each other as they must be by narrow wa­  
ters and territorial lines merely, the facility of  
surreptitious introductions of contraband articles,  
would defeat every attempt at revenue in the  
easy and indirect modes of impost and excise;  
so that whilst their expenditures would be neces­  
sarily and vastly increased by their new situa­  
tion, they would, in providing for them, bo limit  
  
ed to direct taxes on land or other DrODertv. ta  
  
arbitrary assessments on invisible funds, and to  
the odious tax on persons. fV ;&#x27;! &quot;;&#x27;vi .&#x27;

*also of members who had opposed and who had  
“espoused, the Constittution in_its actual form.  
‘lt _daes not appear from the printed proceedings  
“of Congress on that occasion, that the power  
was denied by any of them ~ And it may be re­  
‘marked, that members from Virginia, in particu­  
lar. as well of the anti federal as the federal  
-t-ﬂy&#x27; the names then dminiuiohing those who  
ad orpoud and those who had approved the  
“Conetitution, did not fiesitate 1o propose duties  
and to suggest even prohihitions in favor of  
severalarticles of her production. By one a duty  
was proposed on mineral coal, in {lvor of the  
Virginia coal pits; by another, a duty on hemp  
was proposed, to encourage the growth of that  
articlejand by a third, a prolibition even of  
foro:ft,b»f was suggested, as a measure of  
sound policy.  
A further evidence in support of the consti­  
tutiona! power to protect and foster manufac­  
tures by regulations of trade, an evidence that  
ought, of itself, to settle the question, is the  
uniforin and practical sanction given to the pow­  
er, by the General Government, for nearly forty  
years§ with a concurrence or acquiescence of  
every State Gevernment, throughout the same  
period ; and, it may be added, through all the  
vicissitudes of party which marked the period.  
No novel construction, however ingeniously de­  
vised, or however respectable and patriotic its  
‘spalrons, can withstand the weight of such av­  
* thoritiés,or the unbroken current of so prolonged  
and universal a practice. And well it is that  
this canot be done, without the intervention of  
the same authority which made the Constitu­  
tion. &quot; If it could Le so done, there would be an  
-end to that stability in Government, ard in  
Lawd, which is essential to good government  
and good laws, astability, the want of which is  
the imputation which has at all times been lev­  
elled agamst Republicanism, with most effect,  
by its most dextrous adversaries. The imputa­  
tion ought never, therefore, to be countenanced,  
by inhovating constructions, without any plea  
-of &amp; precipitancy, ‘or paucity of the constructive  
precedents they oppose ; without any appeal to  
material facts newly brought to lhight ; and  
without any claim to a better knowledge of the  
-original evils and inconveniences, for which  
remedies were needed, t%.e very best keys to the  
true object and mezung of all laws and consti­  
utions.  
And may it not be fairly left to the unbiassed  
judgement of all men ol experience and of intel­  
ligenee, to decide, which is most to be relied on  
for a-sound and safe test of the meaning of a  
Conatitution, a uniform interpretation by all the  
successive authorities under it, commencing with  
ite birth, and continued for a long period,  
through the varied state of political contest ; or  
the opinion of every new legislature, heated as  
it may be by the strife ot parties—or warped,  
as often happens, by the eager pursuit of some  
favorite object —or carried away, possibly, by  
the powerful eloquence or captivating address  
of a few popular statesmen, themselves, per­  
haps; influenced by the same misleading causes ?  
If the latter test is to prevail, every new legis­  
lative opinion might make a new Constitution,  
-as the foot of every new Chancellor would make  
- anew standard of measure.  
It is seen, with no little surprise, that an at­  
tempt has been made, in a highly respectable  
quacter, and at legth reduced to a resolution,  
formally proposed in Congress, to substitute, for  
the power of Congress to regulate trade, so as  
to encourage manufactures, a power in the sev­  
eral States to do so, with the consent of that  
body ; and this expedient is derived from a  
clause in the tenth section of article first of the  
Constitution, which says : “No State shall,  
without the consent of Congress, lay aoy m­  
posts or duties on Imports or exports, except  
what may be absolutely necessary for exsculing  
its inspection laws ; and the net produce of all  
duties, and imposts, laid by any State on im­  
ports and exports, shall be for the use olthe  
Treasury of the United States ; and all such  
laws shall be subject to the revision of control  
of the Congress.”’  
To say nothing of the clear indication in the  
Jonrnal of the Convention of 1787, that the  
olause was intended merely to provide for ex­  
penees incurred by particlar States, in their In­  
spection laws, and in such improvements as  
‘they might choose to make in their harbours  
lm! rivers, with the sanction of Congress—ob­  
_jects to which the reserved power has been ap­  
lied, in several instances, at the request of  
%irg&#x27;mh and, Georgia—how could it ever be im­  
agined that any State would wish to tax its own  
trade for the encouragement of mauufactures,  
possessed of the autheriy, or could, in fact,  
do o, if wishing it?  
A tax on imports would be a taxon its own  
consumption ; and the net proceeds going, ac­  
-cording 10 the clause, not inte ite own Treasu­  
sy, but into the Treasury ol (he United States,  
&#x27;t{o State would tax itself seperately for the  
sequal gain of all the other States ;and as far as  
rthe menufactures, so encouragad, might suc­  
.ceed in ultimately increasing the stock in mar-  
Xet, and lowering the price by compotition, this  
wadvantmge, also, procured at the sole expense  
«of the State, would be common 10 all the oth­  
“ors.  
But the very suggestion of such an expedient  
“o any State, would havo an air of mockery,  
when its experienced impracticability is takon  
“into view. No one, who recollects or recurs to  
‘the period when the power over commerce was  
in the. individual States, and separate attempte  
‘were made to tax, orotherwise regulate it, need  
bo told that the attempts were not only abor­  
tive, but, by demonstrating the necessity of  
general and uniform regulations, gave the orig­  
nal impalse to the constitutional reform which  
provided for such regilations.  
To refer a State, there‘ore, to the exercise of  
a power, as veserved to her by the Constitution,  
the impossibilty of exercising which was an n.  
«ducement to &amp;r the Coostituion, is, of all re­  
amedial devices, the last that ought to be brought  
forwapd.. .And what renders it the more ex:ra­  
‘erdinary, is, that, as the tax on coinmerce, as  
#ar g it could be nrm, tely ¢ollected, instead  
«f bolanging 4o the Treasury of the State, ae  
  
previous to the Constitution, would be a ‘tribute  
to the United States, the State would be ina  
worse condition, after the adoption of the Con.  
stitution, than before, in reference to hn impor­  
tart intereet, the improvenent of which was a  
particular object in adopting the Constitution,  
Were Congress to make the pto‘ifosed decla­  
ration of consent to state tarifls in tavor of Stute \
manufactures, and the permitted attempts did  
not defeat themselves, what would be the situa­  
tion of Siates deriving their for2ign snpplics  
tluouﬁh the ports of other Stares ? Itis evi­  
dent that they might ‘be compelled to pay, in  
iheir consumnption of particiilar arvicles impor­  
ted, a tax for the common treasury, not com- 1  
mon to all the States, without having any man­  
ufacture or product of their own, to partake ofJ  
the contemplated benefit.  
Of the impraeticabiliny of separate regulations  
of trade, and the resulting necessity ol ¢encral  
regulations, no State was more gensible than  
Virginia. She was accordingly among ihe most  
earnest for granting to Congress a power ade­  
quate fothe ohjeet. On more oceasions than  
one in the proceedings of her Legislative coun­  
cils it was recited ** that the relative situalion  
of the States had been found, on trial, to re­  
quire uniformity in their commercial regulations  
as the only effectual policy for obtaining in the  
rm&#x27;u of forcign nations a stipulation of privi­  
eges reciprocal to those enjoyed by the sub-  
Jjects of such nations in the ports of the Uuited  
States ; for preventing animosities which cannot  
fail to arise among the several States from the  
interference of partial and separate regulations ;  
and for deriving from commerce such aids to the  
public revenue as it ought to contribute, &amp;c.”’  
During the delays and discouragements ex­  
perienced in the attempts to invest Congress  
with the nccessary powers, the State of Virgin­  
ia mnade various trials of what could be done by  
her individual laws. She ventured on duties  
and imposts as a source of revenue: Resolutions  
were passed at onetime to encourage and pro­  
tect her own navigation and ship building ;  
and in consequence of complaints and potitions  
from Norfolk, Alexandria, and other places,  
against the monopolizing navigation laws of  
Great Britain, particularly in the trade befween  
the United States and the British West In­  
dies, she deliberated, with a purpose controlied  
only by the inefficacy of separate measures, on  
the experiment of forcing a reciprority by pro­  
hibitory regulations of her own. [See Journal  
of House of Delegates in 1785.]  
The effect of her seperate atiemptis to raise  
revenue by duties on imports, soon appeared in  
representations from her merchants, that the  
commerce of the State was banished by them  
into othar channels, especially of Maryland,  
where imports were less burdened than in Vir.,  
ginia. [See do. for 1786.]  
Such a tendency of seperate regulations was  
indeed too manifest to escape anticipation.  
Among the projects prompted by the want of a  
Federal authority over commerce, was that ofa  
concert first proposed on the part of Maryland  
for a uniformity of regulations between the  
two States, and Commissioners were appointed  
for that purpose. It was soon perceived, how­  
ever, that the concurrence of Pennsvlvania was  
as necessary to Maryland as of Mnrylvd to  
Virginia, and the concurrence of Pennsylvania  
was accordingly invited. But Pennsylvania,  
could no more concur without New York than  
Maryland without Pennsylvania,nor New York  
without the concurrence of Boston, &amp;c.  
  
These projects were superseded for the mo­  
ment by that of the Convention at Annapolis in  
1786 and forever by the Convention at Phila.  
delphia in 1787, and the Coustitution which was  
the fruit of it.  
  
There is a passage in Mr. Necker’s work on  
the finances of France which affords a signol il­  
lustration of the difficulty of ccllecting, in con­  
tiguous com:nunities, indiract taxes, when not

co alone, to seventeen or eighteen hundred,  
more than three hundred of whom were con.  
signed to the terrible punishment of the Gal­

Mo~NTePELEER, Sept. 18, 1828.  
  
Dear Sir: Your lete letter reminds me of  
our conversation on the constitutionality of the  
power in Congress to impose a tariff for the en­  
couragement of manufactures; and of my pro­  
mise to sketch the grounds of the confident  
opinion | had expreszed, that it was among the  
powers vested mn that body. I had not forgotten  
my promise, and had even begun the task of  
fulfilling it; but frequent interruptions, from oth.  
er causes, being followed by a bilious indispo­  
sition, I have not been able sooner to comply  
with your request. The subjoined &quot;view of the  
subject might have been advantageously ex­  
panded; but [ leave that improvement (o your  
own reflections and researches.  
  
The Constitation vests in Congress, expressly,  
““ the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im­  
posts, and excises;’’ and ¢‘ the. power to regu­  
late trade.*”?  
  
That the forraer power, if not particularly ex­  
preased, would have been included in the lnttori  
as one of the objects of a general power toregu. |  
late trade, is not necassarily impugned by its  
being so expressed. Examples of this sort can­  
not sometimes be easily avoided, and are to be  
seen olsewhere in the Constitution. Thus the !  
power *¢ to define and pumsh offences againsl;  
the law-of nations,”” includes the power.-lftor-&#x27;  
wards particalarly expressed, ¢ to make rules |  
concerning captures, &amp;e. from offending neu-!  
tra&#x27;s.”” 8o also a power “to coin money’’ |  
would doubtless includ» that of ¢ reculating its &#x27;«  
value,’”’ had not the latter power been express- |  
ly inserted. The term taxes, if standing almu,!  
would certainly have included duties, impmu.i  
and excises, In another clanse it is said, ** no |  
tax or duoties shall be laid on exports, §c.”” |  
Here the two terms are nsed as lynnnvmons.!  
And in another clause, where it is said ** no&#x27;  
State shall lav anv impoets, or duties, &amp;e¢.”’ the }  
torms imposts and duties are synonymous. Ple- |  
onasms, tautologies, and the promiscuous use of |  
terms and phrases, differing in théir shades of‘  
meaning, (always to be expounded with reﬁ-r-l  
ence 1o the context and under the control of the |  
general character and wanifest scope of the in- ‘  
etrament in which they are found) are to be as­  
cribed, sometimes to IKQ purpose of greater cnu-’  
tion: sometimes to the imperfections of langhago- |  
and sometimes to the imparfection of man him, |  
sel”. In this view of the subjeet, it was quiloi  
natural, however certainly the general power to |  
rogulate trade might include a power to impon]  
duties on it, not to omit it in a clavse enunera­  
ting the reveral modes of revenue, authorised by  
the Constitution. In few cases could the * ex  
majori cautela’ ocenr with more claim to re­  
spoc!.  
Nor can it be inferred, that a power to regu.  
late trade does not involve a power to tax it,  
from the distinetion made in the original contro.  
versy with Great Britain, between a power to  
regulate trade with the Colonies, and a power  
to tax them. A power to regulate trade be.  
tween different parts of the Empire, was con.  
fessedly necessary; and was admitted to lie, as  
far as that was the case, in the British Parlia­  
ment; the taxing part being at the =ame time  
denied to the Par?immu. and asserted (o be  
necessarlly inherent in the Colonial Legislatures,  
as sufficient, and the onl&amp; rafo depositories of  
the laxing power. So difficult was it, roverthe­  
  
less, 1o maintain thé distinction in practics, thaf  
:lho ingredient of revenue was occasionaily evers  
| loolmf or dwregarded in the Britsh  
‘as in the duty on sugar and molasses  
into,the Colonies. And it was fortunate thas  
the stiempt at auinternal and direct tax, in the  
&#x27; case o/ the Stamp Act, produced a radical ex.  
amination of the subject b¥fore &amp; regulation of  
trade with &amp; view 1o revenue had gruwn into an  
ostablished authority. One thing at loast is cer:  
tain, that the main and admitied object of the  
Parlismeniary regulations of trade with the  
Colonies, was the encouragement of manufaes  
tures in Great Britain, .  
But the present question is unconnected -.i:}  
the former relations between Great Britain  
her colonies, which were ofa peculiar, a com.  
ipl»cmed.nnd. in several respects, of an unde­  
fined character. [t isa simple - question under  
‘the Constitution of the United States, whether  
“ the power to regulate trade with foreign na+  
‘tions’* as a distinct and substantive item in the  
‘enumerated powers embraces the object of ens  
&#x27;couraging by duties, rustrictions and prohibits  
’iom. the manuofactures and products of th‘  
country? And the affirmative must be inferre  
fromthe following considerations:  
1. The meaning of the g:ruo “to nrhl&quot;  
trade,’’ must be sought in the general use of it ; i  
other words, in the objects to which the power  
&#x27;was generally understood to be applicable,  
when the phrase was inserted in the &amp;mﬂiu-&quot;  
tion, :  
2. The power has been understood and used  
iby all commercial and manufacturing nations, as  
embracing the object of encouraging manufac­  
tures. Itis believed that not a single exception  
can be named.  
3. This has been particularly the case with  
Great Britain, whose commercial vocabulary is  
the paren: of ours. A primary object “I&#x27;L&#x27;  
’commercill regulations is well knewn to have  
‘been the protectior. and encouragement of her  
&#x27;manufactures, .  
4. Such was understood to be &amp; proper use of  
‘the power by the Siates most prepared for  
‘manufacturing industry, whilst retaining the  
power over their foreign trade.  
s._Such a use of the power, by Congress, ac­  
‘cords with the intention and expectation of the  
‘States, n transferring the power over trade  
L from themselves to the Government of the  
U. States. This was emphatically the case in  
the Eastern, the more manufacturing members’  
of the Confederacy. Hear the language held in  
the Convention of Massachusetts.  
&#x27; By Mr. Bawes, an advocate for the Consti­  
tution, it w. &lt;abserved, ‘* Our mapufactures are  
another great subject which has received ne  
encouragement by national duties on foreign  
manufactures, and they never can by any au­  
thority in the old Confederation.’” Agam, ** If  
we wish to entourage our own manufactures,  
to preserve our own commerce, 10 raise the  
value of our own lands, we must give Congrese  
the powers in question.””  
By Mr. Widgery, an opponent: ** All we hear  
is, that the merchant and farmer will flourish,and  
that the mechanic and tradesman are to make  
:iheir fortunes directly, if the Constitution goes  
own,”  
The Convention of Massachusetts was the  
only one in New England whose debates have  
been preserved. But it cannot be doubted that  
the sentiment there expressed was common to  
the other States in that quarter, more upociol­  
ly to Connecticut and Rhode Island, the most  
thickly peopled of all the States, and having, of  
‘course, their thoughts most turned to the sub-  
Ject of manufactures. A hke inference may be  
confidently applied to New Jorsey, whose de­  
&#x27;bala in Convention have not been preserved.  
In the populous and- manufacturing State of  
Penusylvania, a partial account only of the de­  
‘bates having been published, nothing certain is  
“known of what passed in her Convention on this  
point. But ample evidence may te found else«  
l where, that regulations of trade, for the encour«  
‘agement of manufactures, were considered- as  
within the power to be granted to the new Cone  
rgron. as well gs within the scope of the nation­  
al_policy. O the States Soith of Penneylvania,  
‘the only two in whose Conventions the debates  
have been preserved are Virginia and North  
&#x27;Carolina, and from these no adverse inferences  
‘ean be drawn. Nor is there the slightest  
indication that either of the twu States far­  
thest South, whoss debates in Convention, if  
‘preserved, have not been made public, viewed  
the encouragement of manutactures, as not  
within the general power over trade to be trans­  
ferred to the Government of the United States,  
5. IfCongress have not the power, it is an.  
nihilated for the nation; a policy without exame  
ple in any other nation, and not within tbe  
reason of &#x27; l:e solitary one in our own. The ex­  
ample alluded to, is the rrohibilion of a tax on  
exports, which resulted from the apparent im­  
possibiiity of raising, in that mode, a revenne  
from the States, proportioned to the ability 8  
pay it—the ability of some being derived,in a  
great measure, not from their exports, but from  
their fisheiries, from their freights, and from  
commerce at large, insome of its branches al.  
together external to the United States; the  
profits from all which, being invisiblée and in­  
tangible, would escape a tax; on exports on the  
other hand, being a tax on consumption, which  
is in proportion to the ability of the consumers,  
whencesoever derived, was free from that in­  
equality.  
7. I revenue be the sole object of a legitis  
mate impost, and the encouragement of domes­  
tic articles be not within the power of re?lno  
ing t:ade, it would follow that no monopolising  
or unequal regulations of foreign nations could  
be counteracted; that neither the staple articles  
of subsistence, nor the essential implements for  
the public safety, could, under gny circums«  
stances, be insured or fostered at home, by regu­  
lations of commerce, the usval and most cone  
venient mode of providing for both; and that the  
American navigation, though the source of naval  
defence, of a cheapening competition in carry.  
ing our valuable and bulky articles to market,  
and of an independent carriage of them during  
foreign wars, when u foreign navigation might  
be withdrawn, must be at ‘once abandoned, or  
speedily destroyed; it being evident that a ton­  
nage duty in foreign ports against our vessels,.  
and an exemption from such a duty in our ports,.  
in favor of foreign vessels, must have the in~  
evitable effect of banishing ours from the ocean..  
To assume a power (o protect our nnfulim,  
and the cultivation and fl:bricatiol of all arti~  
cles requisite for the public safety as incident to  
the war power, would be a more latitudinary  
construction of the text of the*Constitution, thaw  
to consider 1t as ecmbraced by the specified pow­  
er to regulate trade;a power which bas been  
exerciged by all nations for thosapurposes, and  
which elfectsthose purposes with less of inter.  
ference with the authority and connmon?&#x27; y of  
the Siates, than might result fiom internal and  
direct modes of encouragiag the articles, any of  
which modes would be authorized; as far as  
deemed ** necessary and proper,*’ by considering  
the power as an incidental power, &#x27; .  
8. That the encouragement of mahufactures  
was an objoct of the power to regulate trade,  
proved by the use made of the power for that  
object, in the first eession of the First Congress  
under the Constitution; when umoa’ the mem.  
bere present were 80 many who had béen mom­

MosTPEi.ren, Sept. 18,1828. j  
Dear Sir : Your late letter reminds me of  
our conversation on the constitutionality of j  
! the power iii -Congress to impose a tariff for i  
, the encouragement of manufactures ; and ■  
of my promise to sketch the grounds of the ,  
confident opinion I had expressed, that it j  
was among the powers vested in that body. J  
&#x27; I had not forgotten my promise,and had even !  
; begun Ibe task of fulfilling it; butfrequeni ‘  
i interruptions, from causes, being followed j  
{ by a bilious indisposition, I have not been ■  
I able sooner to comply with your request.;  
The subjoined view of the subject might I  
have been Advantageously expanded ; but 1  
leave thajjlnnprovement to your own reflec­  
tions ana researches.  
The Constitution vests in Congress, ex­  
pressly, “ the power to lay and collect taxes,  
duties, imposts, and excises;” and “the  
power to regulate trade.”  
That the former, if not particularly ex- |  
pressed, would have been included in the j  
latter as one of the objects of a general  
power to regulate trade, is not necessarily  
impugned by its being so expressed. Ex­  
amples of this sort cannot sometimes be  
easily avoided, and are to be seen else­  
where in the Constitution. Thus the pow­  
er “ to define ami punish offences against  
the law of nations,” includes the pow­  
er, afterwards particularly expressed, “ to  
make rules concerning captures, &amp;c.  
from offending neutrals.” So also a power  
“ to coin’money” would doubtless include  
that of “ regulating its value,” had not,the  
latter power been expressly inserted. The  
term, taxes, if standing alone, would cer­  
tainly have included duties, imposts, and  
excises. In another clause it is said, “no  
tax or duties shall be laid on exports, &amp;c.*’  
Here the two terms are used synonymous.  
And in another clause, where it is said “ no  
I State shall Iny any imposts, or duties. &amp;c.”  
  
the terms impost and duties are synony­  
mous. Pleonasms, tautoligies, and the  
promiscuous use of terms and phrases, dif­  
fering in their shades of meaning, (always  
I to be expounded with reference to the con-  
I text and under the control of the general  
character and manifest scope of the instru­  
ment in which they are found,) aie to be as­  
cribed, sometimes to the purpose of greater  
caution ; sometimes to the imperfections of  
language, and sometimes to the imperfec­  
i tion of man himself. In this view of the  
subject, it was quite natural, however cer­  
tainly the general power to regulate trade  
might include a power to impose a duty on  
it, not to ornit it in a clause enumerating the  
&#x27; several modes of revenue, authorized by the j  
| Constitution. In few cases could the “ex !  
! majori cautela&quot; occur with more claim to&quot;  
respect.  
Nor can it be inferred, that a power to  
■ regulate trade does not involve a power to  
tax it, from the distinction made in the ‘  
original controversy with Great Britain be­  
. tween a power to regulate trade with the  
Colonies, and a power to tax them. A  
power to regulate trade between different•  
■ parts of the Empire, was confessedly neces- ’  
I sary; and was admitted to lie, as far as that ’  
( was the case, in the British Parliament; the ;  
; taxing part being at the same time denied  
i to the Parliament, and asserted to be neces­  
: sarily inherent in the Colonial Legislatures,  
; as sufficient, and the only safe depositories  
;of the taxing power. So difficult was it,  
i nevertheless, to maintain the distinction in  
j practice, that the ingredient of revenue was  
; occasionally overlooked or disregarded in  
| the British regulations, as in the onsu-  
I gar and molasses imported in the Colonies.  
&#x27; And it was fortunate that the attempt at an  
’ internal and direct tax, in the case of the  
Stamp Act, produced a radical examination  
I of the subject before a regulation of trade  
■ with a view to revenue had grown into an  
i established authority. One thing at least  
I is certain, that the main and admitted ob- ;  
; ject ofthe Parliamentary regulations of trade  
with the Colonies was the encouragement  
of manufactures in Great Britain.  
  
But the present question is unconnected ,  
with the former relations between Great:  
Britain and her colonies, which were of a  
peculiar, a complicated, and, in sever&quot;! re-!  
spects, of an undefined character. It is a !  
simple question under the Constitution of|  
the United States, whether “ the power to |  
regulate trade with foreign nations,” as a ■  
distinct and substantive item in the enumer- :  
ated powers, embraces the object of encou-1  
raging by duties, restriction and prohibi- i  
tions, the manufactures and products ofthe I  
* country ? And the affirmative must be in- |  
ferred from the following considerations :  
1. The meaning of the phrase to “ regu­  
; late trade,” must be sought in the general  
i use of it; in other words, in the objects to  
j which the power was seuer»ll&gt; understood  
to be applicable, when the phrase was in-  
। serted in the Constitution.  
2. The power has been understood and  
’ used by all commercial and manufacturing  
| nations, as embracing the object of encour­  
aging manufactures. It is believed that  
not a single exception can be named.  
3. This has been-particularly the case  
with Great Britain, whose commercial vo­  
cabulary is the parent of ours. A primary  
object of her commercial regulations is well  
known to have been the protection and  
encouragement of her manufactures.  
4. Such was understood to be a proper  
use ofthe power by the States most prepar­  
ed for manufacturing industry, whilst re­  
taining the power over their foreign trade.  
5. Such cause of the power, by Congress,  
accords with the intention and expectation j  
of the States, in transferring the power ’  
over, trade from themselves to the Govern-1  
merit of the United States. This was em- j  
phatieally the case in the Eastern, the more j  
manufacturing Members ofthe Confederacy.  
Hear the language held in the Convention :  
of Massachusetts.  
By Mr. Dawes, an advocate for the Con- ;  
stitution, it was observed, “Our manufac- !  
tures are another great subject which has  
received no encouragement by national du­  
ties on foreign manufactures, and they  
never can by any authority in the old Con­  
federation.” Again, “If we wish to en­  
courage our own manufactures, to preserve i  
I our own commerce, to raise the value oi our j  
(own lands, we must give Congress tire  
I power in question.”  
  
By Mr. Widgery, an opponent: “All we ;  
hear is, that the merchant and farmer will ■  
flourish, and that the mechanic and trades- |  
man are to make their fortunes directly, it j  
1 the Constitution goes down.”  
The Convention of Massachusetts was  
the only one in New England whose de-,  
bates have been preserved. But it cannot  
be doubted that the sentiment there express­  
ed was common to the other States in that  
quaiter, more especially to Connecticut and  
Rhode Island, the most thickly peopled of  
ull the States, and having, of course, their  
thoughts most tur.ncd to the subject of manu­  
factures. A like inference may be confi­  
dently applied to New Jersey, whose de­  
bates in Convention have not been preserv­  
ed. In the populous and manufacturing!  
state of Pennsylvania, a partial account only ;  
of the debates having been published,  
nothing certain is known oj what passed in ।  
her Convention on this point. But ample  
evidence may be found elsewhere, that  
regulations of trade, for the encouragement  
of manufactures, were considered as within  
the power to be granted to the new Con- ,  
gress, as well as within the scope ot the na- ।  
tional policy. Of the States south ot Penn-,  
sylvania, the only two in whose Conventions  
the debates have been preserved arc Vir- [  
gima and Noith Carolina, and from these  
no adverse inferences can be drawn. Nor  
is there the slightest indication that either  
of the two States furthest South, whose de­  
bates in Convention, if pi eserved, have not •  
been made public, viewed the encourage­  
ment of manufactures, us not within the  
genera! power over trade to be transferred  
to the government of the United Stales.  
6. If Congress have not the power, it is an­  
nihilated for the nation ; a policy without ex­  
ample in any other nation, and not within the  
reason of the solitary one in our own. The  
example alluded to, is the prohibition of a  
tax on exports, which resulted from the ap-  
  
[WHOLE NO. 2910.  
  
parent impossibility of raising, ih that mode,  
a revenue from the States, proportioned to  
the ability to pay it—the ability of some be­  
ing derived, in a great measure, not from  
; their exports, buljrom their fisheries, from  
; their freights, and from commerce at large,  
in some of its branches altogether external  
to the United States: the profits from ail  
I which, being invisible and intangible, would  
escape a tax on exports. A tax on imports  
on the other hand, being a tax on consump­  
! tion, which is in proportion to the ability l/  
the consumers, whencesoever derived, was  
free from that inequality.  
7. If revenue be the sole object of a k­  
gitimate/impost, and.the encouragement of  
; domestic articles be not within the power m’  
(regulating trade, it would follow that, mu-  
I nopolizing or unequal regulations of foreign  
। nations could be counteracted ; that neither  
the staple articles of subsistence, nor the  
J essential implements for the public safety,  
’ could, under any circumstances, be insured  
or fostered at home, by regulations of com­  
merce, tho usual and most convcuiauU  
mode of providing for both; and that the  
American navigation, though the source at&#x27;  
naval defence, of a cheapening competition  
in carrying our valuable and bulky articles  
to market, and of an independent carriage  
of them during foreign wars, when a foreign  
navigation might be withdrawn, must be at  
once abandoned, or speedily destroyed : it  
being evident that a tonnage duty in foreign  
ports against our vessels and an exemption  
from such a duty in our ports in favor of  
foreign vessels, must have the inevitable  
effect of banishing ours from the ocean.  
To assume a power to protect our navi­  
gation, and the cultivation and fabrication  
of all articles requisite for the public safety,  
as incident to the war power, would be a  
more latitudinary construction of the text  
of the Constitution, than to consider it as  
embraced by the specified power to regu­  
late trade ; a power which has been exer­  
cised by all nations for those purposes, and  
which effects those purposes with less ofiu­  
terference with the ■authority and conven­  
iency of the States, than might result from  
internal and direct n:sues of encouraging,  
the articles, any of which modes would be  
authorized, as far as deemed “necessary  
and proper,” by considering the power us  
an incidental power.  
8. That the encouragement of manufac­  
tures was an object of the power to regulate  
trade, is proved by the use made of the  
power for that object in the first session of  
■ the first Congress under the Constitution ;  
when among the members present were so  
i many who had been members of the Feder­  
al Convention which framed the Constitu­  
tion, and of the State Conventions wliiu-u  
ratified it; each of these classes consisting  
also of members who had opposed, and who  
had espvuaed, the Constitution in its actual  
form- It does not from the printed  
proceedings of Congress on that occasion,  
that the power was denied by any of them.  
And it may be remarked, that members  
from Virginia, in particular, as well of the  
unti-federal as the federal parly, the names  
then distinguishing those who had opposed­  
i and those who had approved the Constitu­  
■ tion, did not hesitate to propose duties and  
to suggest even prohibitions in favor of sev­  
&#x27; era! articles of her production. By one a  
duty was proposed on mineral coal, in favor  
of the Virginia coal pits ; by another, a duty  
j on hemp was proposed, to encourage the  
growth of that article ; and by a third, «.  
1 prohibition even of foreign beef was sug­  
gested as a measure of sound policy. [See  
Lloyd’s Debates.]  
A further evidence in support of the Con­  
| stitutional power to protect and foster  
nianufactures by regulations of trade, an  
evidence that ought, of itself, to settle the  
i question*, is the uniform and practical sanc­  
tion given to the power, by the General  
; Government, for hei«ly forty years ; with a  
! concurrence of aequiesee.Ag of every State  
&#x27; Government, throughout the same period ;  
and, it may be added, through all 8.19 vicia­  
i situdes of party which marked the period.  
No novel construction, however ingeniously­  
devised, or however respectable and patri­  
otic its patrons, can withstand the weight  
of such authorities, or the unbroken current  
of so prolonged and universal a practice.  
i And well it is that this cannot be done,  
without the same intervention of the same  
■ authority which made the Constitution. If  
! it could be so done, there would be an end  
  
to that-stability in Government, and in laws,  
which is essential to good government and  
. good laws, a stability, the want of which is  
the impututiun which. has ut all timsa been  
I levelled against Republicanism, with most  
’ effect, by its most dexterous adversaries,  
i The imputation ought never, therefore, to  
&#x27; be countenanced, by innovating construc­  
tions, without any plea of a precipitancy, or  
&#x27; a paucity of the constructive precedents  
. they oppose ; without any appeal to materiiil  
I facts newly brought to light; and without  
&#x27; any claim to a better knowledge of tho  
original evils and inconveniences, tor which  
&#x27; remedies were needed, the very best keys  
to the true object and meaning of nil laws  
and constitutions.  
And may it not be fairly left to the unbi­  
■ assed judgment of all men of experience  
j and of intelligence, to decide, which is  
‘ most to be relied on for a sound nnd safe  
1 test of the meaning of a Constitution, a uni­  
form interpietation by all the successive  
i authorities under it, commencing with its  
. birth, and continued for a long period,  
; through the varied state of political con-  
I tests ; or the opinion of every-new Legisln­  
। ture, heated ns it may be by the strife of  
’ parties—or warped, as often happens, by  
the eager pursuit of some favorite object—  
or carried away, possibly, by ths powerful  
eloquence or captivating address of u few  
&#x27; popular statesmen, themselves, perhaps, in­  
fluenced by the same misleading causes ?  
If the latter test is to prevail, every new  
। legislative opinion might make a new Cou­  
j stiiution, as the foot of every new.Chancel­  
lor would make a sew standard of measure.  
It is seen, with no little surprise, that an  
attempt has been made, in a highly respcc­  
&#x27; table quarter, and at length reduced to a  
: resolution, formally proposed is Congress,  
। to substitute, for the power of Congress to

bo, with the consent of that hotly : and this  
expedient is derived from a clause in the  
tenth section of article first of .he Constitu­  
tion, which says: “No State shall, without  
the consent of Congress, l.iy any impost or  
(duties on imports, or exports, except what  
may l&gt;e absolutely necessary for executing  
its inspection laws ; and the net produce of  
all duties, and imposts, laid by any State on  
i-i ports and exports, shall be for the use of  
the Treasury of the United Sta’es; and all  
such laws shall lie subject to the revision  
an I control of the Congress.”  
To s.iy nothing of the clear indications in  
the Journal of the Convention of 1787 that  
the clause was intended merely to provide  
for expenses incurred hy particular Stites,  
in their Inspection laws, and in such im­  
provements as they miglft choose to make  
in their harbors and rivers, with the sanc­  
tion of Congress—objects to which the re­  
served power has been applied, in several  
instances, at the request of Virginia nnd  
Georgia—how could it ever be imagined  
that any State would wish to tax- its own  
trade for the encouragement of manufac­  
tures, if possessed of the authority, or could,  
in fact, do so, if wishing it?  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its own  
consumption; and the net proceeds go­  
ing, accotding to the &lt; lau«e, not into its  
own Treasury, but into the Treasury of the  
United States, the State wool I tax itself  
separately for the equal gain of till the other  
States; and as far as the manufactures, so  
encouraged, might succeed in tdiimatclv  
increasing the stock in market, mid lower­  
ing the price by competition, this advantage.  
—also, procured at the sole expense of the  
State, would be common to all the other*.  
B it the very suggestion of such an expe-  
  
dient io any State, wo-LI have an air of  
mockery, when its expen enrel imprm to a­  
bility is taken into view No one, who rec­  
ollects or recurs to the period when the |  
power over commerce was in the individual  
States, and separate attempts were made to  
tax. or otherwise regulate it. need be told  
that the attempts were not only abortive,  
b it, by demonstrating tho necessity of gen­  
eral and uniform regulations, gave the mig­  
ina) impulse to the constitutional reform  
Whi- h pro&#x27;i :cd ’O&#x27; such r gelations.  
To iefcr a State, therefore, to the exercise  
of a power, as reserved to her bv the Con­  
stitution, the impossibility of exercising  
which was an inducement to a &#x27;oat the  
Constitution, is, of all remedial devices, the &#x27;  
last tnat ought to Ite Ino&#x27;iglit forward  
And what ren ’ers it the more cxtraor.lina  
ry. is. that, as the tax no commerce, as far  
is it in tld be separately collected, instead  
of belonging to the Treasury of the State,  
tie previous to the Constitution, would be a  
tribute to the United States, the Slate would  
I e in n worse condition, after the adoption  
of the Consitmion, than before, in reference  
to an important interest, the improvement of  
which was a particular object in adopting  
the Consti&#x27;ution.  
Were Congress to make the proposed  
declaration of consent to state taiiffs in  
favor of Sta&#x27;e manufactures, and the per­  
mitted attempts did not defeat themselves,  
what would be the situation of States deriv­  
ing their foreign supplies through the ports  
of other States ? It is evident that they  
might be Compelled to pay. in their con­  
sumption of particular articles imported, a  
tax for the common treasury not common  
to all the States, without having ti;ty maiiii-  
Jh Ct lire &lt;ir prorl»l,-t thoir uun, In psrtuko  
of the contemplated benefit.  
Of the impracticability of separate regu­  
lations of trade, and the resulting necessity  
of general regulations. no State was mure  
sensible than Virginia. She was accord­  
ingly among the most earnest for granting  
to Congress a power adequate to the o*&gt;-  
ject. On more o-ca«ions than one in the  
proceedings of her legislative councils, ii  
was recited “that tire relative situation of  
the States had been found, on trial. to re­  
quire uniformity in their commercial regula­

animosities « hich cannot fail to arise among  
the several States from th&quot; interference of  
partial an I separate regulations; and for  
deriving fmm commerce such aids to tbe  
public revenue as it ought »  
During the debiv« and dis&gt;*outngements  
experiencedin the atletn.Vm to invert Pon­  
gre«s with the no&#x27;essarv powers, the State  
of Virginia made various tri ds of whit  
eouldJjo-(If,np bv her in dividual 1-iws. She  
red on duties and imposts as a source  
of revenue : Resolutions were passed at one  
time to encourage and nroted her o vn nav­  
igation and ship building : and in conse­  
-o&quot;ence of complaints and petitions from  
Norfolk. Alexandria, nnd other places, a­  
gainst the monopolizing navigation laws of  
Great Britain, particularly in the trade  
between the Vnited Staten and the British  
H&#x27;est Indies, she deliberated, with n pm-png •  
controlled only by the ineffiency of separate  
measures, on the- experiment of forcing n  
reciprocity bv prohibitory regulations of her  
own. [See Journal of House of Delegates  
in 1785 ]  
  
The effect of her sopnrato attempts tn  
raise revenue by duties on imports, soon  
appeared in representations from her mer­  
chants, that the commerce of the State was

Montpelier, Sept. 18, 182S■  
Dear Sir: Youi ute letter rewinds  
me of our conversation on the constitu­  
tionality of tbe power of Congress to  
impose a tariff for tbe encouragement  
ot manufactures; and of my promise to  
sketch tbe grounds of tbe couhdeut o­  
pinion i bad expressed, that it was a  
among tbe powers vested iu that body.  
I had uot forgotten my promise, and had  
even begun the task of fulfilling it; but  
frequent interruptions,from other caus­  
es, uemg followed by a billious indispo­  
sition, 1 have not been able sooner to  
comply with your request. The sub­  
joined view of the subject might have  
been advantageously expanded; but 1  
leave that improvement to your own  
reflections and researcbes.  
The Constitution vests in Congress,  
expressly “the power to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imposts and excises,” and  
“the power to regulate trade.”  
That the former power, if not parti­  
cularly expressed, would have been in*  
eluded in the latter as one of the ob­  
jects of a general power to regulate  
trade is not necessarily impugned by its  
being so expressed. Examples ot this  
sort cannot sometimes be easily avoided,  
and are to be seen elsewhere in the  
Constitution. Thus the power “to de­  
fine and punish offences against the law  
of nations;” includes tbe power, after­  
wards particularly expressed, “to make  
rules concerning captures, Sic. from of­  
fending neutrals.” So also a power to  
“coin money” would doubtless include  
that of “regulating its value,” had uot  
the latter power been expressly insert­  
ed. The term taxes, if standing alone,  
would certainly have included duties,  
impost, and excises, (n another clause  
it is said “no tax or duties shall be laid  
on exports, &amp;c.” Here tbe two terms  
are used as synonymous. Pleonasms,  
tautologies, and the promiscuous use of  
Urrns and phrases, differing in their  
shades of meaning, (always (o be ex­  
pounded with reference to tbe context  
and under the control of the general  
character and manifest scope of the in­  
strument in which they are found) arc  
to be ascribed, sometimes to the pur­  
pose of greater caution; sometimes to  
the imperfections of language, and  
I sometimes to the imperfections of man  
himself- Iu this view of tbe subject, it  
» was quite natural, however certainly the  
j general power to regulate trade might  
j include a power to impi.se duties on it,  
not to omit in a clause enumerating the  
several modes of revenue, authorised  
by the Censtitution. In few cases could  
the “ex rnajori cautela” occur with  
more claim to respect.  
Nor can it be inferred, that a power  
to regulate trade does not involve a  
power to tax it, from the distinction  
made in the original controversy with  
treat Britain, between a power to regu  
late trade with the Colonies, and a pow­  
er to tax them. A power to regulate  
trade between different parts of the Ern­  
P(re, was confessedly necessary; and  
was admitted to lie, as far as that was  
e case, in the British Parliament; the  
axing part being at the same time de­  
. le lo Parliament, and asserted to  
D« necessarily inherent in tbe Colonial  
  
Legislatures, as sufficient, and the onlv  
safe depositories oi the taxing power.  
So difficult was it nevertheless, to main­  
tain the distinction in practice, that the  
ingredient of revenue was occasionally  
overlooked or disregarded iu the British  
regulatioos, as in the duty on sugar and  
molasses imported into the Colonies.—  
And it was fortunate that the attempt at  
an internal and direct tax, in the case of  
the Stamp Ach produced a radical ex­  
amination of the subject before a regu­  
lation of trade with a view of revenue  
had grown into an established authority.  
One thing at least is certain, that the  
main and admitted object of the Parlia  
men tary regulations of trade with the  
Colonies, was the encouragement of  
Hianu/arturet in Great Bntain.  
But the present question is unconnec­  
ted with the former relations between  
Great Britain and her colonies, which  
were of a peculiar, a complicated, and,  
in several respects, ot an undefined  
character. It is a simple question under  
the Constitution of the United States,  
whether “the power to regulate trade  
with foreign nations” as a distinct and  
substantive item in the enumerated pow­  
ers embraces the object of encouraging  
by dutiesi restrictions and prohibitions,  
the manufactures and products of the  
country? And the affirmative must be  
inferred from the following considera­  
tions.  
1. The meaning of the phrase “to  
regulate trade,” must be sought in the  
general use of it-, in other words, in the  
objects to which the power was general­  
ly understood to be applicable, when  
the phrase was inserted in the Constitu  
tiou.  
  
2- I ho power has Been understood  
and used by all commercial and manu  
facturing nations, as embracing tbe ob  
ject of encouraging manufactures. It is  
believed that not a single exceptmo can  
be named  
$ This has been particularly the case  
with Great Bntuiu, whose commercial  
vocabulary is the parent of ours. A  
preliminary object of her commercial  
regulations “is well kootvn to have been  
the protection and encouragement of  
j her manufactures.  
j 4. Such was understood to be a pro­  
per use of the power by the States most  
! prepared for manufacturing industry,  
whilst retaining the power, by Congress  
accords with the intention and expecta­  
tion of the States, in transferring the  
pow er over tiade from themselves to the  
Government of •the United States­  
! &#x27;l&#x27;his w*s emphatically the case in the  
i Lastern, the more manufacturing mem  
bers of the Confederacy. Hear the  
i language held in the Convention of Mas  
sachusetts.  
j By Mr. Dawes, an advocate for the  
i Constitution, it was observed, “Our ma  
nufactures are another great subject  
j which has received no encouragement  
j nationel duties on foreign manufac  
lures, and they never can by any au  
“therity in the old Confederation” A­  
gain, “If we wish to encourage our own  
! Manufactures, to preserve our own com  
I 1 mercei to raise the value of our own  
‘‘lands, we must give Congress th* pow­  
“eis in question.*&#x27;  
By Mr* Widgery, an opponent: “All  
‘‘we hear is, that the merchant and far­  
“mer will flourish, and that tbe mechan­  
ic and tradesman are to make their  
“fortunes directly, if, tbe Constitution  
“goes down”  
The Convention of Massachusetts was  
the only one in New Bngland whose de­  
bates have been preserved. But it can­  
not be doubted that the sentiment there  
j expressed was common to tbe other  
States in that quarter, more especially to  
Connecticut and Rhode Island, the most  
thickly peopled of all the States, and  
having of course, their thoughts most  
turned to the subject of manufactures  
A like inference may be confidently  
applied to New Jersey, whose debates  
in Convention have not been preserved.  
In the populous and manufacturing  
State of Pennsylvania, a partial account  
only of the debates having been pub­  
lished, nothing certain is known of what  
passed in her Convention on this point.  
But ample evidence may be found else  
where, that regulations of trade, for the  
encouragement of manufactures, were  
considered as within tbe power to be  
granted to tbe new Coogress, as well  
as within the scope of the national poli­  
cy. Of the States South of PenniyI.  
vania, the only two in whose Convea  
tions fhe debates have been preserved  
are Virginia and North Carolina, and  
from these no adverse inferences can be  
drawn- Nor is there the slightest indi  
cation that either of tbe two States far­  
thest South, whose debates in Conven­  
tion, if preserved, have not been made  
public, viewed the encouragement of  
manufactures, as not witLin the general  
power over trade to be transferred to  
the Government of the United States.  
6 If Congress have not the power, it  
is annihilated for tbe nation; a policy  
without example in any other nation  
  
and not within the reason of the solita  
ry one in our own* The example al­  
luded to, is the prohibition of a tax on  
exports, which resulted from the appa­  
rent impossibility of raising, ia that  
mode, a reranue from tha Slates pro  
portioned U the ability to pay it—the  
ability of saaia being derived, in a great  
measure not from their export*.but from  
tbeir fisheries, from their freights, and  
from commerce at large- in soma of its  
branches altogether external to tha U- j  
nited States; the profits from all which !  
being invisible and intangible, would ,  
escape a tax, on exports A tax on ini*  
ports on the other hand, being a tax on  
consumption, which is in proportion to  
the ability of the saunicmis, whe nceso­  
saerer derived, ww free from that ine- ;  
quality­  
7 If revenue be the sole object of a  
legitimate impost, and the encourage­  
ment of domestic articles be not w ithout  
the power of regulatiug trade, it would  
follow that no monopolizing &lt;r unequal  
regulations of foreign nations could be  
counteracted; that neither the staple ar*  
tides of subsistence, nor the essential  
implements of the public safety, could,  
under any circumstances, be inured or  
fostered at home, by regulatioas of com­  
merce, the usual and most convenient  
mode of providing for both; &amp; the Ame­  
rican navigation, though the source of  
naval defence, of a cheapening corope*  
tion in carry ing our valuable and bulky  
articles to market, and of an independ  
ent carriage of them during foreign  
wars, when a foreign navigation might  
be withdrawn, must be at once aban­  
doned, or speedily destroyed: it being  
evident that a tonnage duty in foreign  
ports against our vessels, and an ex  
eruption from such a duty in our ports,  
iu favor of foreign vessels, must have  
the inevitable efiect of banishing ours  
from the ocean  
  
I it assume a power to protect our na. !  
vigatl&#x27;in and the cultivation and fabrica. j  
• ion of all article* requisite for the pub |  
lie safety, as incident to th« war powei  
would be a inoie latitudinary cnoMmc  
tion of the text of the Constitution than  
loroiisider it as embraced h\ the sjieci  
fied power tu regulate trade; a power  
which »»a- been e&amp;ervised by all nations  
foi those purposes, and which effect*  
purposes with the authority and c&lt;• &lt;&lt;\
nifticy of th«* Slates, thaa might result  
from internal and direct modes of en­  
couraging the articles, any of which  
mod* s would he authorized* as far as  
deemed “ripeessary and proper, ’ bv  
considering the power as au incidental  
power.  
8 That the encouragement of manu  
factures was an object of the power to  
regulate trade, is proved by the use  
made of the power for that object, in  
the lirst session of the First Congress  
under the Constitution; when among  
the members presnt were so many who  
had been members of the Federal Con­  
vention which framed the Constitution,  
and of the State Conventions which vati­  
tied it; each of these classes consisting  
also t/f members who had opposed and  
who had espoused, the Constitution in its  
actual form- It does not appear from  
the printed proceedings of Congress on  
that occasion, that the power was dem­  
ied hy any of them. And it may be re­  
marked, that Members from Virginia,  
in particular, as well of the anti federal  
as the federal party, the names then  
distinguishing those who had opposed  
and those who had approved the Con­  
stitution, did not hesitate to propose  
duties and to suggest even prohibitions  
in favor of several article* of her pro­  
duction- By one a duty was proposed  
I on mineral coal, in favor of the Virginia  
coal pits; by another, a duty on hemp  
was proposed, to encourage the growth  
,of that article; and by a third, a prohi­  
bition even of foreign beef was suggest­  
ed, as a measure of sound policy. [See  
Lloyd’s Debates.]  
A further evidence io support nf the  
constitutional pow er to protect and fos­  
ter manufactures by regulations of  
trade, an evidence that ought, of itself,  
to settle the question, is the uniform  
and practical sanction given to the pow­  
er by the General Government* for  
nearly forty years; with a concurrence  
or acquiescence of every State Govern­  
ment, throughout the same period; and,  
it may be added, through all the vicissi­  
tudes of party which marked the period.  
No novel construction, however ingeni­  
ously devised, or however respecable  
and patriotic its patrons, ean withstand  
the weight of such authorities, or the un­  
broken current of so prolonged univer­  
sal a practice- And well it is that this  
cannot be done, without the intervention  
of the same authority which made the  
Constitution. If it could be qp done,  
there would be an end to that stability  
in Government and in Laws* which is  
es sential to good government and good  
laws, a stability, the want of which is  
the imputation which has at all times  
been levelled against Republicanism*  
with most effect by its most dextrous  
  
adversaries. The imputation ought  
never, therefore, to be eountenan&#x27;ed.  
by innovating constructions, without a  
ny plea of a precipitancy, or a paucity  
ot the constructive precedents they op  
pose; without any appeal to material  
fact* newly brought to light; and with­  
out any claim to a better knowledge of  
tbe original evils and inconveniences  
tor which remedies were needed, the  
very best keys to the true object and 1  
meaning of all laws and constitutions.  
And may it not be fairly M» to the un- 1  
biassed judgment ot all men of experi­  
ence aod of intelligence, to deride  
which is mn .t to be relied on for a  
sound and safe test of the meaning of a  
Constitution, a uniform interpretation  
by all successive authorities under it,  
commencing with its birth, and continu­  
ed lor a long period, through the varied  
state of political contests:or the opinion  
u! every new Legislature, heated as it  
may be. by the strife of parties—or war­  
ped, as often happens, by the eager  
pursuit of some favorite object—-or car  
ried away, possibly, by the powerful  
eloquence or captivating address of a  
few popular statesmen, themselves, per­  
haps, influenced by misleading causes?  
If the latter test is to prevail, every new  
legislative opinion might make a new  
Constitution, as the foot of every new  
Chancellor would make a new standard  
of measure.  
It is seen, with no little surprise, that  
an attempt has been made, in a highly  
respectable quarter, and at length redu  
ced to a resolution, formally proposed  
in Congress, tosuhstitue for the power  
of Congress to regulate trade so as to  
encourage manufactures, a power in the  
several Hater to do so, with the consent  
of that body; and this expedient is de­  
rived from a clause in tbe tenth section  
of article first of the Constitution, which  
sass: “No State shall, without the con­  
sent of Congress, lay any imposts of du­  
ties on imports or exports, except what  
may be absolutely necessary for exe­  
cuting its inspection laws; and the net  
pr oduce of all duties, and imposts, laid  
h&gt; «ny stato on imports and exports,  
shall tie for the use of the Treasury of  
tbi: I oited States; and ail such laws  
shall he subject to the revision and  
control ot Congress,”  
1 o snv nctfiing of the clear indications  
in the Journal of the Convention of  
1787, that the clause was intended  
merely *■&gt; provide for expi iices incurred  
hr patticular States in their Inspection  
laws, and in such improvements as they  
rr.av choose to ma ke iu their harbors j  
and rivers, with the sanction of Con­  
gresB—objects to which tbe reserved  
p &gt;wer has been applied, iu several in­  
stances, at the request of Virginia and  
(teorgia, how could it ever he imagined  
that any State would wish to tax its own  
trade for the encouragement of manu­  
factures, if possessed of authority, or  
could, in fact, do so, if wishing it? &#x27;  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its  
own consumption; and the net proceeds  
going, according to the clause, not into  
its own Treasury of tbe United Hates,  
the State would tax itself separately for  
the equal gain of all tbe other States;  
and as far as tbe manufactures, so en­  
couraged, might succeed in ultimately  
increasing the stock in market, and  
lowering the price by competition, the  
advantage, also, procured at the sole  
expense of tha State would be common  
to ail the others.  
  
But the very suggestion of such an  
expedient to any State, wo ..id have an j  
air of mockery, when its experienced  
impracticability it taken into view- No  
one who recollects or recurs to the peri­  
od when the power over commerce was  
in the individual State*, and separate at­  
tempts were made to tax or otherwise  
regulate it, need be told that tbe at­  
tempts were not only abortive, but by  
demonstrating the necessity of genera)  
and uniform regulations, gare the origi­  
nal impulse to the constitutional reform  
which provided for such regulations.  
To refers State, therefore, to tbe el&#x27;  
ercise of a power, as reserved to her by  
the Constitution, the impossibility of ex*  
1 ereining which was an inducement to a­  
dopt the Constitution, is of all remedial  
devices, tbe last that ought to be bro’t  
forward. Aud what renders it tbe more  
extraordinary, is, that, as the tax on  
commerce, as far as it could ba sepa­  
rately collected, instead of belonging  
| to the Treasury of tbe State, at previous  
J to the Constitution, would be a tribute  
I the United States, tbe State would  
be in a worse condition after tbe adop­  
! tion of tbe Constitution, than before, in  
I reference te an important ioterest, tbe  
improvement of which was a particu*  
lar object in adopting tbe Constitution.  
Were Congress to make tbe proposed  
declaration of consent to state tariffs in  
favor of State manufacture*, and the  
permitted attempt* did not defeat them­  
selves, whst would be tbe situation of  
State deriving tbeir foreign supplies  
through tbe ports ©f other States? It is  
evident that they might be compelled te  
  
pay, in their consumption of particular  
articles imported, a tax for the cummoa  
treasury, not common to all the States,  
without haring any manufacture or pro­  
duct of their own, to partake of the con*  
! tempiatrd benefit  
Ol the impracticability of separate re­  
gulations of trade, and the resultmg ne­  
cessity of general regulations, no stata  
was more sensible than Virginia- She  
w as accordingly among the moat earnest  
(or granting to Congress a power ade­  
quate to the object. On more occasions  
than oua in the proceeding of her Legis­  
lative couucils it was recited “that tha  
relative situation of the States bad beea  
toui.d, on ttial, to require uniformity ia  
their commercial regulations as the only  
e rfcetnal policy for obtaining in the porta  
of foreign nations a stipulation of privi­  
leges ref ipiocal to those enjoyed by tha  
subjects ol surb nations in the ports of  
the U. States; for preventing animosi­  
ties which cannot fail to arise among tha  
several States from the interference of  
partial and separate regulations; and  
for deriving from commerce such aide  
to the public revenue as it ought to con­  
tribute, &amp;.c.&#x27;}  
During the delays and discourage*  
meets experienced in the attempts to in­  
vest Congress with the necessary pow­  
ers, the State of Virginia mude various  
trials of what could be done by her indi­  
vidual laws- She ventured on dutiea  
and imposts as a source of revenue: Re*  
solutions were pasted at one time to en­  
courage and protect her own navigation  
and ship building; and In consequence  
of complaints and petitions from Nor­  
folk, Alexandria, and other pieces, a*  
gainst the monopolising navigation lawn  
of Great Britain, paiticularly in tha  
trade btlwrtnth* United Staten and the  
Britiik IVeet Indie f, sha deliberated,  
with a purpose controlled only by tba  
inefficacy of separata measures, on the  
experiment of forcing a reciprocity by  
prohibitory regulations of faeruwn, (See  
Journal of House of Delegates in 1785.]  
The effects of her separate attempts  
to raise revenue by duties on imports,  
soon appeared in representations from  
her merchants, that the commerce of tha  
State was banished by them into other  
channels, especially of Maryland, where  
imports were less burdened than in Vir­  
ginia. [See Do. for 1706 ]  
Such a tendency for separata regula­  
tions was indeed too manifest to escape  
anticipation.-Among tha projeoU  
prompted by the want of a Federal au­  
thority over commerce, was that of a  
concert first proposed on the pert at  
Maryland for a uniformity of regulations  
between the two States, and eoinmis­  
sioners ware appointed for that purpose.  
It was soon perceived, however, that  
the concurrence of Pennsylvania was as  
necessaiw to Maryland as of Maryland  
to Virginia, and the concurrence of  
Pennsylvania was occordingfy invited—  
But Pennsylvania could no more concur  
without New York than Maryland with*  
out Pennsylvania, nor New Yoik with*  
ont the concurrence ol Boston, &amp;c.  
These projects were superseded for  
the moment by that of the Convention  
at Annapolis in 1766, and forever by tha  
Convention at Philadelphia in 1787, and  
the Constitution which was the fruit of it.  
There is a passage in Mr. Neckar’i  
work on the finances of France which  
aflnrds a signal illustration of the diffi­  
culty of collecting, in contiguous com­  
rr.uuitis«, indirect taxes, when not tba  
same in all, by the violent meant resor*  
t*d to * gainst smuggling from ooe to a­  
nother of them- Previous to the lata  
Revolutionary war in that country, tha  
taxes were ol very different rates in the  
different Provinces, particularly the *ax  
on salt, which was high ia the interior  
provinces and low in the maritime, and  
the tax on tobacco, which was very high  
in genera!, whilst in some of tha pro­  
vinces the use of the article was altogetb­  
sr tree. The consequence was, that  
the standiog army of the patrols against  
smuggling had swoln to the number of  
twenty-three thousand, the annual ar­  
rest of men, women, and children, en­  
gaged in smuggling to five thousand  
five hundred and fifty; and the number  
annually arrested on account of salt and  
tobacco alone, to seventeen or aigbleeD  
hundred, more than three hundred of  
whom were consigned to the terrible  
punishment of the Gallies­  
  
way it not Da regarded a* among the  
providential blessing* to tbasa States,

oela of intercourse, give such additional  
force to the many obligations to cherish  
that union vbicb alone, secures tbeir  
peace, tbeir safety, and tbeir prosperity  
Apart from the more obvious and awful  
consequences of tbaiv entire separation  
into independent sovereignties, it is

Mo~TrELIER, Sept. 18, 1828,  
Dear Bir : Your lato letter reminds me of our  
conversation on the constitutionality of the power  
in Congress toimpose a tariff for the encourage­  
ment of manufuctures; and of my promise to  
sketch the grounds of the confident opinion I had  
expressed, that it was among the powers vested in  
that body. I had not forgotten my promise, and  
had even begun the task of fulfilling it ; but fre­  
quent inte,ruptions, from other causes, being fol­  
lowed by a bilious indisposition, I have not been  
able sooner to comply with your request. -The  
subjoined view of the subject might have becn ad­  
vantageously expanded; but Ileave that improve­  
ment to yo%r own reflections and researches  
The Constitution vest in Congress, expressly,  
“‘the power to lay and collect taxes, dutios, it  
posts, and excises ;” and “the power to regualate  
trade.”’  
  
That the former power, if not particularly ex­  
pressed, would have been included in the latter as  
one of the objects of a general power to regulate  
trade, is not necessarily impugned by its being so  
expressed. Examples of this sort cannet soine­  
times be easily avoided,and are to be secn cise­  
where in the gonstitution, Thus the power ‘“to  
define and punish offences against the law of na­  
tions,” includes the power, aiterwards particalarly  
expressed,’‘to make rules concerning captures,&amp;ec.  
froin oifending neutrals.” So alse a power ““to coin  
money’’ would doubtless include that of“regulat­  
ing its value,” had not the latter power been . ex­  
pressly inserted. The term, taxes, if standing  
alone, would certainly have included duties, im­  
posts, and excises. In another clause it is said,*no  
tax or duties shall be laid on exports, &amp;c.”” Here  
the two terms are used as synonymous. Andin a­  
nother clause, where it is said “no State shall lay  
any imposts, or duties, &amp;c.” the terms impost and  
dutics are synonymous. Pleonasms, tauioligies,  
and the promiscuous wse of terms and phrases. dif­  
feringin their shade of meaning, (always to be  
expounded with reference to the coniext and un­  
der the control of the general character and mani­  
fest scope of the instrument in which they are  
found) are to be ascribed, sometimes to the pur­  
pose of greater caution; sometimes to the imper­  
fections of language, and sometimes to the imper­  
fection of man himself. In this view of the sule  
ject, it was quite natural, however certainly the  
general power toregulate trade might include a  
power to impose a duty on it, not to omit it in a  
clause enumerating the several modes of revenue,  
authorised by the Constitution. In few cases could  
the ““cz majori cautela” occur with more claim to  
res&amp;»ect.  
or can it be inforred, that a power to regulate  
trade does not involve a power to tax it, from the  
distinction made in the original controversy with  
Great -Britain between a power to regulate trade  
with the Colonies, and a power to tax them. A  
power to regulatetrade betwcen different parts of  
the Enpire, was confessedly necessary ; and Wwas  
admitted to lie, as far as that was the case,«in the  
British Parliament ; the taxing part being at the  
same time denied to the Parliament,and asserted  
to be necessarily inherent in the Colenial Legisla­  
tures, as sufficiciit, and the only safe depositorics  
of the taxing pawer. . So difficult was it, never­  
theless, to maintain the distinction in practice,  
that the ingredient of revenue was occasionally  
overlooked or disregarded in the British regula­  
tions, as in the duly on sugar and molasses import­  
ed iuto the Colonies. And it was fortunate that  
the attempt at ar internal and direct tax,in the  
eage of the Stamp Act, produced a radical examl­  
nation of the subject Lefore a regulation of trade  
with a view torevenue had grown into an estab­  
dished authority. One thing at l€astis certain,  
that the main and admitted object of the Parlia­  
mentary regulations of trade with the Colonies,  
was the encouragement of manufuctures in Great-  
Britain, : i  
But the present question is uncennected with  
the former relations between Great-Britain and  
her colonies, which were of a peculiar, a complis  
cated,and, in several respects, of an undefined  
c¢haracter. Itis asimple question underthe Con­  
stitution of the United States, whether ‘“the pow­  
er to regulate trade with foreigm nations” as a  
distinet and substantive item in the enumerated  
powers embraces the object of encouraging by du­  
ties, restrictions, and prohibitions, the manufae­  
tures and products of the country ? And the af­  
firmative must- be inferied frem the following  
considerations :  
  
1. The meamning of the phrase “to regulate |  
trade,” must be sought in the general use ot&#x27;it; in |  
other words, in the objects to- which the power  
was generally understood to be applicable, when |  
the phrase was inserted in the Coustitution. i  
2. The power has been understood and used by  
all commercial and manufacturing nations, as em­  
bracing the object of encouraging manufactures.  
It is believed that not a single exception can be  
aamed.  
3. This has been particularly the case ‘with  
Great-Britain, whose commetcial vecabulary is  
the parent of ours. A primary object of her  
commercial regulations is ‘well known to have  
been the protection and encouragement of her  
manufactures. 3 :  
4. Such was understood to be a proper use of  
the power by the States most prepared for manu­  
fseturing industry, whilst retaining the power  
over their foreign trade. ;  
5. Such a use of the power, by Congress, ac­  
cords with the intention and expectation of ‘the  
States, in transferring the power over trade from  
themselves to the Government of the U. States.  
This was emphatically the casein the Eastern, &#x27;  
the more manufacturing Members of the Confud­  
eracy. Hear the language held inthe Convention  
of N{ussdchusetts. : |  
By Mr, Dawes, an advocate for the Constitution |  
it was cbserved, “Our manufactures are another  
great subject which has received no encourage­  
ment by national duties on foreign manufactures,  
and they never can by any authority in the old  
Lonfederation.” Again, “If we wish to encour­  
age our own manufactures, to préserve our own  
commerce, to raise the value of our own lands,  
we must give Congress the powers in question.”  
By Mr. Widgery, an opponent : “All we hear  
is, t{at the merchantand farmer will flourish, and  
that the mechanic and tradesman are to make  
their fortunes directly, if the Constitution goes  
down.”’ :  
The Convention of Massacliusetts was the only  
one in New-England whese debates have been  
preserved. - But it cannotbe doubted that the sen­  
timent there expressed was common 1o the other  
States in that quarter,more especinll{ to Connecti­  
cut and Rhode-sland, the maost thickly peopled of  
allthe States, and having, of course, their thoughits  
most turned to the subject of manufactures. A  
Jike inference may be confidently applied to Now­  
ersey, whose debates in&#x27; Convention have not  
%een preserved. In the populous and manufactur­  
ino State of Pennsylvania, a partial account only  
of the debates having been published, nothing  
certain is known of what passed in her Cernven­  
tion on this point.” But ample evidénce may be  
foundelsewhere, that rgtgulatlons of trade, for the  
encouragement of manufactures, were considered  
as within the power to be granted to the mew  
Congress, as well as within the scope of It_he  
mations! poliey. Of the States South of Pennsylva

; nia, the only two in whose Cenventions the de­  
bates have been preserved are Virginia and North-  
Curolina, and from these noadverse inferences  
can bedrawan. Nor is there the slightest indica­  
tion that either of the two States farthest South,  
- whose debates in Cenvention, if preserved, have  
&#x27; not been made public, viewed the enceuragement  
- of manufactures, as not wiihin the gener:l power  
- over trade Lo be transferred to the government  
~of the United States.  
- 6. 1f Congress have not the pawer, it is anni­  
hilated for the nation ; a pelicy without example  
in any other nation, and net within the reason of  
the solitary one in our own. The example al­  
luded to, is the probibition of a tax on exports,  
which resulted from the apparent impossibility of  
raising, in that mode, a revenue froin the Staies,  
proportioned to the ability to pay it—the ability  
of some being derived, in&#x27;a great measure, not  
from their exports, but. froin their fisheries, from  
their freights, and from commerce at large, in  
some of its branches ajtogether extiernalto the  
United States : the profits from all which, being  
invisthle and intangible, would eseape a tax, on  
exporis. A tax on imports on the other hand,  
bemg a tax on consumption, which is in propor­  
tion to the ability of the consumers, whencesoev­  
er derived. was frea frsm that iuggualer.  
7. Ifrevenue be the sole object of a legitimate  
impost. and the encouragement of domestic arti­  
cles be not within the power of regulating trade,  
it would follow that no monopolisiag or unequal  
regulations of foreign nations could’ be counter­  
acted ; that neither the staple articles of subsist­  
ence, nor the essential implements for the public  
safety, could, under any circumstances, be insur­  
ed or fostered at home, by vegulations of com­  
merce, the usual and most convenient mode of  
providing for both; and that the American  
navigation, though the source of naval defence,  
of a cheapening competition in carrying our val­  
uable and buliky articles to market, and of an  
independent carriage of them during foreign wars,  
whan a foreign navigation might be withdrawn  
must beatonce abandoned, or speedily dostroyed:  
it being evident that a tonnage duty in foreign  
ports against our vessels, and an exemption from  
sueh a duty in our ports, in favour of foreign  
vessels, must have the inevitable effect of banish­  
ing ours from the ocean.  
To assume a power to protect our navigation,  
and the cultivation and fabrication of all articles  
requisite for ‘he public saiety, as incident to the  
war power, would be a miore latitudinary constrac­  
tion of the text of the Coustitution, than to consia­  
er it as embraced by the specified power to regu­  
late trade - a power which has been sxercised by  
all nations for those purposes, and which effects  
those parposes with less of interfereice with the  
authority and conveniency of the States, than  
might resalt from internal and direct modes of en­  
couraging the articles,any of which medes would  
be authorized, as iar as deemed “necessary and  
proper,” by considering the power as an inciden­  
tal power. :  
  
8. That the encouragement of manufactures was  
an object of the power to regnlate trade, is proved  
by the us¢ inade of the power for that übjeciin the  
first session of the First Congress under the Con­  
stitution ; when among the meinbers present were  
80 many who had been members of the Federal  
Convention which framed the Constitaticn, and  
of the State Cenventions which ratified ; each  
of these classes consisting also of members who  
had opposed and who had espoused, the Consti­  
tution in Its actual form it doos not appear from  
the printed proceedings of Congress on that occa­  
sivn, that the power was denied by any of them.  
And it inay be remarked that Members from Vir­  
g, in particular, as well of the anti-federal as  
the federai party, the names then distinguishing  
those who had opposed and those who had zp­  
proved the Constitution did not hesitate to pro­  
pose duties and to suggest even prohibitions in  
tavor of several artic‘Tes of her production. By  
one a duty was propesed on mineral coal, in favor  
of tho Virginia coal pits; by another, a duty on  
hemp was proposed, to encourage the growth of  
that article ; and by a third, a prohibition even  
of foreignbeef was sugcested as a mcasure of  
sound policy [See Lloyd’s Debates.]  
A further evidence in support ot the constitu­  
tional power to protect and foster manutactures by  
regulations of trade, an evidence that ought. of it­  
itself, to settle the question, is the unitorm and  
practical sanction given to the power, by the  
General Government, for nearly forty years;  
with a concurrence or acquiescence of every  
State Government, throughout the same period ;  
and, it may be added through all the vicissitades  
of party which marked the period. No novel  
construction, however ingenicusly devised, or  
however respectable and patrioticits patrons, can  
withstand the weight of such authorities, or the  
unbroken current of so prolonged and universala  
practice. And well itis that this cannot be done,  
without the intervention of the sarae authority  
which made the Constitution. 1f it could be so  
done, there would be an end to that stability in  
Government,and in Laws, which is essential to  
good government and good laws, a stability, the  
want es which is the imputation which has at all  
times been leveled against Republicanism, with  
most effect by its most dextrous adversaries.—  
The imputation ought never, therefore, to be  
countenanced, by innovating construotions, wit’  
out any piea of a precipitancg, or a paucity o  
the constructive precedents’ they oppose ; with­  
out any appeal to naterial facts newly brought to  
light; and without any claim to a better, knowl­  
edge of the original evils and inconveniences, for  
which remedies were needed, the very .best  
keys to&#x27;the true object and” meaning of all laws  
and constitutions. - :  
  
And may it not be fairly left to the unbiassed  
judgment of all men of experience and of intelli­  
gence, to decide, which is most to be relied on  
for a sound and safe test of the meaning of a  
Coustitution, a uniform interpretation by all the  
successive authorities under it, commencing with  
its birth, and continued for a long period, through  
the varied state of political contests ; or the opin­  
ion of every new Legislature, heated as it may  
be by the strife of parties—or warped, as often  
happens,by the eager pursuit of some favorite  
object—or carried away, possibly, by the. power­  
ful eloquence or captfivating address of a few  
popular statesmen, themselves, perhaps,influenc­  
ed by the same misleading causes? If the latter  
test 1s to prevail, every new legislative opinion  
might make a new Constitution, as the foot of  
every new Chancellor would make a new stand­  
ard of measure.  
1t is seen with no little surprise, that an at­  
tempt has been made, in a Lighly respcctable  
quarter, and at length reduced to a resolution,  
formally proposed in Congress, to substitate, for  
“the pawer of Congress to regulate trade so as to  
-encourage manufactures, a power in the several  
States to do so, with the consent of that body;  
- and this expedient is derived from a clanse in t{e  
tenth section of article first of the Constitution,  
which says: “No State shall,without the consent  
- of Congréss,lay any imposts or duties on imports,  
| or exports, except what may be absolutely neces­  
-1 sary for exccuting its inspection laws ; and the  
&#x27; net produce of all duties, and imposts, laid by  
. any State on imports and exports,shall be for the  
i use of the Treasury, of the United States; and  
! all sach laws shall be subject to to the revision  
; and control of the Congress.”  
To say nothing of the clear indicttions in the  
  
PORTSMIOUTE, TUESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1829,  
  
Journalof the Conveation of 1737, that the clanse  
was intended merely to provide for oxpenses in­  
currad by particalar States, in their inspection  
Jaws, and in such improvements as they might  
chonse to make in their harbors and rivers, with  
the sanction of Congress—ebjects 1o which the  
reserved power has been applied; in several in­  
stances, at thexequest of Virginiaand Georgia—  
how could itev% imagined the ¢ any State would  
wish to tax itssgwn’trade for the encouragzement  
of manufactures, if possessed of tho authority,  
or could in fact, do so, if wisking it 2  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its own  
consumption ; and the net proceeds geing, ae­  
cording to the clause, not into its own Treasary,  
but into the Treasury of the United States, the  
State would tax itself separately for tha equal  
gain of all the other States ; and as far as the  
manufactures so encouraged, mizht sneceed in  
ultimately increasing the stock in masket, and  
lowering the price by competition,this ndvantage,  
also, procured at the sole expense oi the State,  
would be common to all the others.  
  
But the very suggestion of yuch an expedient  
to any State would have an air of mockery, when  
its experieaced impracticability istaken into view.  
No one who recollects or recurs so the period  
whon the power Over comprerce wWis (i Whie IHadls  
vidual States, and separate actomypts were mada  
to tax, or otherwise regulate it, need be told that  
the attempts were not anly abortive, but by de­  
monstrating the necessity of general and uniform  
regulations, gave the original impulse to the  
censtitutional reform which provided for such  
regulations.  
To refer a State, therefore, to the exercise  
of a power, as reserved to lier by the constitu­  
tion, the ‘npossibility of exercising which was  
an inducement to adopt the constitution, is of  
all remedial devices, the lust that.ought to be  
brought forward. And what renders it the more  
extraordinary, is, that, as the tax on cominerce,  
as {ar as it could be separately collected, instead  
of belonging to the Treasury of the State, as pre­  
vious to the canstitution, would be a tribute to  
the United States, the State would be in a  
worse condition after the adoption of the con­  
stitution, than bLefore, in reference to an im­  
portant interest, the improvement of which  
was a particular eljeet in adopting the consti­  
tution,  
Were Congress to make the proposed declara­  
tion of consent to State tariffs in tavor of State  
manufactures, and the permitted attempts did  
not defeat themselves, what would be the situa­  
tion of States deriving their foreign supplies  
through the ports of other States? It is evident  
that they might be compelled to pay, in their  
consumption of particular articles imported, a tax  
for the common treasury, not common to all the  
States, without having any manufaeture or pro­  
duct of their own, to partake of the contemplated  
benofit.  
  
Ot the impracticability of separate regulations  
of trade, and the resunlting necessity of general  
regulations, no State was more sensible than Vir­  
ginia. She was accordingly among the most  
earncst for granting to Congress a power ade­  
quate to the object. On more occasions than  
one in the proceedings of her legislative councils,  
it was recited ‘“‘that the relative situation of the  
States had Leen found, on trial, to require wuni­  
formity in their commereial regulations as ihe  
onlty effectual policy for obtaining in the ports of  
foreign nations a stipulation of privileges recipro­  
cal to_these eiifoyed lv’y the subjects of such na­  
tions in the ports of the United States; for pre­  
venting animesities which cannot fail to arise a­  
mong theweveral States from the interference of  
partial and separate regulations; and for deriv­  
ing from comnuerce such aids tc the public rev­  
enue as it cught to contribute, &amp;ec.  
During the delays and discouragements ex­  
perienced in the attempts to invest Congress  
with the necessary powers, the State of Virgin­  
ia made various trials of what could be done by  
her individual laws. She ventured on duties  
and imposts as a source of revenuc; Resolutions  
were passed at one time to euncourage and pro­  
tect her own navigation and ship building; and  
in consequence of complaints and petitions from  
Norfolk, Alexandria, and other places, against  
the monepolizing navigation laws of Great-Bri­  
tain, particularly in the trade between the United  
States and the British West-Indies, she deliberat­  
ed, with a purpose controlled only by the inefli­  
cacy of scparate measures, cn the experiment of  
forcing a reciprocity by prohibitory regulations  
of her own. [See goumal of House of Dolegates  
in 1785.]  
The efiect of her separate attemnpts to raise  
revenue by duties on umports, soon, appeared in  
representations from her merchants, that the  
commerce of the State wasbanished by thein in­  
to other channels, especially of Maryl:nd, where  
imports were less burdened than in Virginia.—  
[See do. for 1786.] :  
Such a tendency of separate regulations was  
indeed toe manifest to escape anticipation. A­  
mong the prejects prompted by the want of a fed­  
eral authority over commerce, was that of a con­  
cert first preposed on the part of Maryland for a  
uniformity of regulations between the two States  
and commissioners were appointed for that pur­  
pose. It was soon perceived, however, that the  
concurrence of Pennsylvania was as necessary  
to Maryland as of Maryland to Virginia, and the  
concusrence of Pennsylvania was accordingly  
invited. But Pennsylvania could no more ¢oncur  
without New-York than Maryland without Penn­  
sylvania, nor New-York witg’out the concurrence  
of Boston, &amp;ec. : :  
  
These projects were superseded for the mo­  
ment by that of the Convention at Annapolis in  
1786, and forever by the Convention at Philadel­  
phia in 1787, and the constitution which was the  
fruit of&#x27;it.  
There is a passage in Mr. Neckar&#x27;s work on  
the finances of France, which affords a signal il­  
lustration of the di fliculty of collecting, in con­  
tiguous communities, imﬂrect taxes, when not  
the same in all, by the violent means resorted to  
against smuggling from one to another of them.  
Previous to the late revolutionary war in that  
country, the taxes were of very different rates in  
the diﬂgerent provinces; particularly the tax on  
salt, which was high in the interior provinces  
and low in the maritime, and the tax on tobacco,  
which was very high in generzl, whilst in seme  
of the provinces the use of the article was alto­  
gether free. The consequence was, that the  
standing army of patrols against smugﬁling had  
swoln to the number of twenty-three thousand ;  
the anpual arrest of men, women and &quot;children  
engaged in smuggling, to five thousand five hun­  
dred and fifty ; and the numbher annually arrest­  
ed on account of salt and tobacco alcne, to sey-  
  
enteen or - eighteen hundred, more than three  
hundred of which were consigned to the terrible  
punishment of the Gallies:  
May it not be regarded as among the providen­  
tial blessings to&#x27;these States, that their geograph­  
ical relations multiplied as they will be by artifi­  
cial channels of intercourse, give such addition­  
al force to the many obligations to cherish that  
union which alone secures their peace,their safe­  
ty, and their prosperity ! Apart from the more  
obyibus and awful consequences of their entire  
separation into independent sovereignties, it is  
worthy of special consideration, that divided  
from each other as they must be by narrow wa­  
ters and territorigl lines mere ly, the facility of  
  
surreptitious introductions of contraband articles,  
would defeat every attempt at revenne in the  
easy and indiract mades of tnpost and excise, so  
that whilst their expenditures would be necessa­  
rily and vastly inereased by their new situation,  
they would, in providing for them, be limited to  
direct {axes on land or other property to arbitra-  
Iy assessments on invisible funds, and to the odi-  
Ous tax on perscns.  
You will observe that I have confined myself  
in what has been said, to the constitutionality  
and expediency of the power in Cengress to en­  
courage &quot; domestic - products by regulations of  
commerce. In the exercise of the power, they  
are responsible to their constituents; whose right  
and duty it is, in that as in all other cases, to  
bring their mensures to the test of justice and of  
the general good. With great esteem and cor

Montpelier, Sept. 18, 18S8.  
Dear Sir—Your late letter remind* me of  
our conversation on the constitutionality o  
the power in Congress to impose a Tariff for  
the encouragement of manufacturers; and of  
my promise to sketch the grounds of the con­  
fident opinion I had expressed that it was  
among the powers vested in that body. I had  
not forgotten my promise, and had even be­  
gun the task of fulfilling it, hu* frequent in­  
terruptions, from other causes, being follow­  
ed by a billions indisposition, I have not been  
able sooner to comply with your request.—  
The subjoined view of the subject might have  
been advantageously expanded ; but I leave  
the improvement to your own reflections and  
researches.  
The Constitution vests in Congress, ex  
pressly, “the power to lay and collect taxes,  
duties, imposts, and excises;” and “the pow­  
er to regulate trade.”  
That the former power, if not particularly  
expressed, would have been included in the  
latter as one of the objects of a general pow­  
er to regulate trade, is not necessarily im­  
pugned by its being so expressed. Examples f  
of this sort cannot sometimes he easily avoi­  
ded, and are to be seen elsewhere in the Con­  
stitution. Thus the power “to define and  
punish offences against the laws of nations.”  
includes the power, afterwards particularly  
expressed, “to make rules concerning cap­  
tures, &amp;,c. from offending neutrals.” So also  
a “power to coin money,” would doubtless  
include that of “regulating its value.’’had not !  
the latter been expressly inserted. The term j  
taxes, if standing alone, would certainly have I  
included duties, imposts, and excises. In an­  
other clause it is said “no tax or duties shall |  
be laid on exports, k.c.” Here the two terms  
are used as synonymous. And in another  
clause, where it is said “no state shall lay  
any imposts,or duties,”&amp;c. the terms imposts  
and duties are synonymous. Pleonasms,tau­  
tologies, and the promiscuous use of words  
and phrases, differing in their shades of mea­  
ning, (always to be expounded with reference  
to the context, and under the control of the  
general character and manifest scope of the  
instrument in which they are found,)are to he  
ascribed, sometimes to the purposes of grea­  
ter caution ; sometimes to the imperfections  
of language ; and sometimes to the imperfec­  
tions of man himself. In this view of the sub­  
ject, it was quite natural, however certainly  
the general power to regulate trade might in­  
clude a power ttf impose duties on it, not to  
omit it in a clause enumerating the several  
modes of revenue, authorised by the consti­  
tution. In few cases could the “ ex mojori  
cautcla” occur with more claim to respect.  
Nor can it be inferred that a power to reg­  
ulate trade does not involve a power to tax it,  
from the distinction made in the original con­  
troversy with Great Britain, between a pow­  
er to regulate trade with the Colonies, and a  
power to tax them. A power to regulate  
trade between different parts of the Empire,  
was confessedly necessary—and was admitted  
to lie, as far as that was the case in the Brit­  
ish parliament; the taxing part being at the  
same time denied to the Parliement, and as­  
serted to he necessarily inherent in the Colo- ;  
nial Legislatures, as sufficient, and the only ;  
safe depositories of the taxing power. So dif­  
ficult was it, nevertheless to maintain the dis­  
tinction in practice that the ingredient of rev­  
enue was .overlooked or disregarded in the  
British regulations, as in the duty on sugar &amp;  
molasses imported into the colonies. And it  
was fortunate that the attempt at an internal  
and direct tax, in the case of the Stamp Act,  
produced a radical examination of the sub­  
ject, before a regulation of trade with a view  
to revenue had grown into an established au­  
thority. One thing at least is certain, that  
the main and admitted object of the Parlia­  
mentary regulations of trade with the en­  
couragement of manufactures in Great Brit- i  
  
cull* I  
But the present question is unconnected  
with the former relations between Great Brit­  
ain and her colonies, which were of a pecul­  
iar, a complicated, and in several respects, of  
an undefined character. It is a simple ques­  
tion under the constitution of the U. States,  
whether “the power to regulate trade with  
foreign nations” as a distinct and substantive  
item in the enumej^Mi powers, embraces the  
object of encoura^PIVy duties, restrictions  
and prohibitions, the manufactures and pro­  
ducts of the country ? And the affirmative  
must be inferred from the following consider­  
ations ;  
1. The meaning of the phrase ‘to regu­  
late trade,” must be sought iu the general use  
of it; iu other words, in the objects to which  
the power was generally understood to be ap­  
plicable. when the phrase was inserted in the |  
rwwnfiin uiiimi

_ C- Tbit has boot parttcuhtriy the ease w ith  
Gl. Britain, *»but* &lt;wawrit) vocabulary is  
the parent of ours. A primary object of her  
commercial regulations is well known to have  
been th? protection and encouragement of her  
manufactures.  
4. Such was understood to he a proper use  
of the power by the States most prepared for  
manufacturing industry, while retaining the  
power over their foreign trade.  
5. 8uch a use of the power by Congress,  
accords with the intention and expectation of  
* ^ ®tates‘ m transferring the power over  
*1. fr^OIj themselves to the Government of  
the United States. This was emphatically  
the case in the Eastern, the more manulartu­  
nng members of the Confederacy. Hear the  
language held iu the convention of Massachu­  
setts.  
By Mr Dawes an advocate f,.r the consti­  
tution it was observed, “Our manufactures  
are another great subject which has received  
no encouragement by national duties on for­  
eign mauufactures.and they never can by any  
authorit/in the old confederation. Again.  
‘If we wish to encourage our own manuiact­  
ures, to preserve our own commerce, to raise  
the value of our lands, we must give congress  
the powers in question.’  
By Mr. Widgery, an opponent: 1 All we  
¥ hear is,that the merchaut and farmer will flou­  
rish, and that the mechanick and tradesman  
are to make their fortunes directly, if the  
Constitution goes down.’  
The convention of Massachusetts was the  
Duly one in New England whose debates have  
  
bean preserved. Ilut it cannot be doubted  
that the sentiment there expressed w*i com­  
mon to the other •lutes in that quarter, more  
! especially in Connecticut and Rhode Island,  
the most thickly settled of all the states, and  
having of course, their thoughts most turned  
to the subject of manufactures. A like infer­  
ence may be confidently applied to New Jer­  
j sey, vv hose debates in convention have not  
| been preserved. I.i the populous and manu­  
i factoring state of IVnnsylvania. a partial ae­  
‘ count only of the debates having been pub­  
lished. nothing cer&#x27;ain is known of what pas­  
sed in her convention on this point. But am  
pie evidence may he found elsewhere.that reg­  
ulations of trade for the encouragement of  
manufactures, were considered as within the  
power to he granted to the new congress, as  
well as within the scope of national policy.—  
Of tlu* states south of Pennsylvania, the only  
two in whose conventions the debates have  
been preserved arc Virginia and North Caro­  
lina. and from these no adverse inferences can  
he drawn. Nor is there the slightest indica­  
tion that either of tilt; two states farthest  
south, whose debates in convention, if preser­  
ved. have not been made public, viewed the  
encouragement of manufactures, as not with­  
in the general power over trade to he trans­  
ferred to the Government of the United  
St a tes.  
G. If Congress have not the power.it is an­  
nihilated for the nation; a policy without ev  
a mple in any other nation,and not within rea­  
son of the solitary one in our own. The ex­  
ample alluded to, is the prohibition of a tax  
on exports, which resulted from the impossi­  
bility of raising in that mode, a revenue from  
the states,proportioned to the ability of some  
| to pay it—the ability of some being derived  
in a great measure, not from their exports,  
hut from their fisheries, from their freights,ik.  
from commerce at large, in some of its bran­  
ches altogether external to the United States;  
the profits from all which being invisible and  
intangible, would escape a tax on exports—  
A tax on imports on the other hand, being a  
tax on consumption, which is in proportion  
to the ability of the consumers, whencesoev­  
; er derived, was free from that inequality,  
j 7. If revenue be the sole object of thatie­  
j gitimate impost, and the encouragement of  
J domestic articles be not within the power of  
i regulating trade, it would billow that no mo­  
nopolizing or unequal regulations of foreign  
nations, could he counteracted ; that neither  
the staple articles of subsistence, nor the es­  
sential implements for the public safety,could  
under any circumstances, be insured or fos­  
j tered at home, by regulations of commerce,  
the usual and most convenient mode of provi­  
ding fur both ; and that the American navi­  
i gatiori, though the source of naval defence,  
of a cheapening competition in carrying our  
valuable and heavy articles to market, and of  
an independent carriage of them during for­  
&#x27; eign wars, when a foreign navigation might be  
withdrawn, must he abandoned at once, or  
speedily destroyed ; it being evident that a  
tonnage duty in foreign ports against our ves­  
sels, and an exemption Irom such a duty in  
our ports, in favour of foreign vessels, must  
have the inevitable effect of banishing ours  
from the ocean.  
  
l o assume a power 10 protect our naviga­  
tion and the cultivation and fabrication of all |  
1 articles requisite for the publick safety, as in­  
I cidentto the war power,would be a more lat­  
t itudinary construction of the text of the con­  
stitution, than to consider it as embraced by  
the specified power to regulate trade; apow -  
J er which has been exercised by all nations for  
those purposes, and which effects those pur­  
poses with less .of interference witli the au­  
thority and convenienty of the States, than  
might result from Internal and direct modes  
of encouraging the articles, any of which  
modes would be authorized, as far as deemed  
! necessary, by considering the power as an  
i incidental power.  
8. That the encouragement of manufac  
tnres was an object of the power to regulate  
trade, is proved by the use made of the pow  
er for that object, in the first session of the  
first congress under the constitution ; when  
among the members present were so many  
who had been members of the Federal Con­  
vention which framed the constitution.and of  
the State conventions which ratified it; each  
of these classes consisting also of members  
who had opposed and who had espoused the  
constitution in its actual form. It does not  
appear from the printed proceedings of con­  
gress on that occasion, that the power was  
denied by any of them. And it may be re­  
marked, that members Iron Virginia in par­  
ticular, as well of the Anti-Federal as the  
Federal party, the names then distinguishing  
those who had opposed and those who had  
approved the constitution, did not hesitate to  
propose duties and to suggest even prohibi­  
tions in favor of several articles of her pro­  
duction.  
By one a duty on mineral coal was propos­  
ed in favor of the Virginian coal pits : by an-!  
other, a duty was proposed or&gt; hemp, to en­  
courage the growth of that article ; and by a  
third a prohibition even of foreign beef was  
suggested as a measure of sound policy. See  
Lloyd’s Debates.  
-  
A further evidence in so jiport of the consti­  
tutional power to protect and foster manu­  
I factures by regulations of trade, an evidence  
that ought, of itself, to settle the question, is  
the uniform and practical sanction given to  
the power by tin; General Government, for  
nearly forty years; with a concurrence or  
acquiescence of every state government,thro’  
the same period ; and. it may he added thro’  
all the vicissitudes of party which marked the  
period. No novel construction, however in­  
geniously devised, or however respectable and  
patriotic its patrons,can withstand the weight  
of such authorities, or the unbroken current  
of so prolonged and universal a practice. And  
well it is that this cannot be done, without  
the intervention of the same authority which  
made the constitution. If it could be so done  
there would be an end to that stability in  
Government and Laws, which, istheimputa­  
tion which has at all times been levelled a­  
gainst Republicanism, with most effect, by its  
dexterous adversaries. The imputation ought  
lever, therefore, to be countenanced, by in­  
novating constructions, without any plea of a  
precipitancy, or a paucity of the constructive  
precedents they oppose; without any appeal  
to material facts newly brought to light; and  
without any claim to a better knowledge of  
the original evils and inconveniences,for which  
remedies were needed the very best keys to  
the true object and meaning of ail laws and  
constitutions.  
  
And any it not be fairly left to the unbuv­  
•ed judgment of all men of experience end of  
intelligence, to decide, which ia the moat to  
be relied on for a sound and safe test of the  
meaning of a constitution, an uniform inter­  
pretation by all the successive authorities un­  
der it, commencing with its birth, and con­  
i tinning for a long period through the varied  
state of political contests; or »he opinion of  
every new Legislature, heated as it may be  
liy the strife of parties—or warped, as often  
happens, by the eager pursuit of some favorite  
object—or carried away,possibly,by the pow­  
erful eloquence, or capitivating address of a  
; few popular statesmen, themselves, perhaps,  
influenced by the same misleading causes? If  
the latter test is to prevail, every new legisla­  
tive opinion might make a new constitution,  
as the foot of every chancellor would make a  
new standard of measure.  
It is seen with no little surprise, that an at­  
1 tempt has been made, in a highly respectable  
quarter, and at length reduced to a resolution  
formally proposed in Congress, to substitute,  
for the power of Congress to regulate trade,  
so as to encourage manufactures, a power in  
the several States to do so, with the consent  
of congress, lay any impost or duties on im­  
ports or exports, except what may be abso­  
lutely necessary for putting in force its in­  
spection laws ; and the nett produce of all du­  
ties and imposts,laid by any State on imports  
j and exports, shall be for the use of the treas­  
ury of the United States ; and all such laws  
1 shall be subject to the revision and controul of  
congress.  
To say nothing of the clear indications in  
the Journal of the Convention of 1787, that  
the clause was intended to provide for expen­  
ses incurred by particular states, in their in­  
spection liws, and in such improvements as  
they might choose to make in their harbours  
and i ivers with the sanction of congress—ob­  
jects to which the reserved&#x27; power has been  
applied, in several instances, at the request of  
Virginia and Georgia—how could it ever be  
imagined that any State would wish to tax  
its own trade for the encouragement of manu­  
factures, if possessed of the authority,or could  
in fact, do so, if wishing it ?  
A tax on imports would lie a tax on its own  
consumption, and the nett proceeds going,ac­  
cording to the clause, not into its own treasu­  
ry, but into the treasury of the United States  
the state would tax itself separately for the e­  
qtial gain of all the other States: and as far  
as the manufactures, so encouraged, might  
succeed in ultimately increasing the stock in  
market, and lowering the price by competi­  
tion, this advantage, also, secured at the sole  
expense of the State, would be common to all\
the others.  
But the very suggestions of such an exped­  
ient to any state, would have an idea of mock­  
ery, when its experienced implecticabjlity is;  
taken into view. No one who recollects or re­  
curs to the period when the pow er over com­  
merce was in the individual States, and sep­  
arate attempts were made to tax, or other­  
wise regulate it, need not be told that the  
attempts were only abortive, but by de­  
monstrating the necessity of general and uni-”  
form regulations, gave the original imptdse to  
the constitutional reform which provided for  
such regulations.  
m P A A A t P A iL •  
  
To reter a state, tnereiore, »o me exercise  
of a power as reserved to her by the constitu­  
tion, the impossibility of exercising which was  
an inducement to adopt the constitution, is of  
all remedial devices, the last that ought to be  
brought forward. And what renders it the  
more extraordinary, is, that, as the tax on  
commerce, as far as it could be separately col­  
lected, instead of belonging to the treasury of  
the state,as previous to the constitution,would  
be a tribute to the United States, the State  
would be in a worse condition, after the ad­  
option of the constitution than before, in ref­  
erence to an important interest, the improve­  
ment of which was a particularobject in adop­  
ting the constitution.  
Were congress to make the proposed dee  
laration of consent to stale tariff&#x27;s in favour of  
state manufactures, &amp;. the permitted attempts  
did not defeat themselves, what would be the  
situation of states deriving their foreign sup­  
plies through ports of other states? It is ev­  
ident that they might he compelled to pay in  
their consumption of particular articles im  
ported, a duty for the common treasury, not  
common to all the states, without having any  
manufactures of their own, to partake of the  
contemplated benefits.  
Of the impracticability of separate reg­  
ulations of trade, and the resulting necessi­  
ty of general regulations, no State was  
more sensible than Virginia. Site was ac­  
cordingly among the most earnest fur  
granting to Congress a power ad&lt; quate to  
the object. On more occasions than one  
in the proceedings of her legislative coun­  
cils, it was recited “ that the relative situ­  
ations of the States had been found on tri­  
al, to require uniformity in their commer­  
cial regulations, as the only effectual policy  
for obtaining in the ports of foreign nations  
a stipulation of privileges reciprocal to  
those enjoyed by the subjects of such na­  
tions in the ports of the United States; for  
preventing animosities which cannot fail to  
arise among the several States from the  
interference of partial and separate regu­  
lations ; and for deriving from commerce  
such aids to the public revenue as it ought  
to contribute, &amp;c.”  
During the delays and discouragements  
experienced in the attempts to invest Con­  
gress with the necessary powers, the State  
of Virginia made various trials of what  
could be done by her individual laws. She  
ventured on duties and imposts as a source  
of revenue : Resolutions were passed at  
one time to encourage and protect her own  
navigation and ship building; and in con­  
sequence of complaints and petitions from  
Norfolk, Alexandria, and other places, a- .  
gainst the monopolizing navigation laws of  
Great Britain, particularly in the trade be­  
tween the United States and the British  
West Indies, she deliberated, with a pur­  
pose controlled only by the inefficiency of  
the separate measures, on the experiment  
of forcing a reciprocity by prohibitory re­  
fulations of her own. [See Journal of the  
louse of Delegates in 1785.]  
The effect of her separate attempts to  
raise revenue by duties on imports, soon  
appeared in representations from her nier­  
  
chants that the commerce of the State was I  
banished by them into other channels, cs-j  
pecially to Maryland, where imports were  
less burthcned than in Virginia. [See do.  
for 1789.]  
Such a tendency to separate regulations  
was indeed too manifest to escape antici­  
pation. Among the projects prompted by  
the want of a Federal authority over com­  
merce, was that of a concert first proposed !  
on the part of Maryland for a uniformity  
of regulations between the two States, and  
Commissioners were appointed for that  
purpose. It was soon perceived, however,,  
that the concurrence of Pennsylvania was  
as necessary to Maryland as of Maryland 1  
to Virginia, and the concurrence of Penn­  
sylvania was accordingly invited. But ]  
Pennsylvania could no more concur with- j  
out New-York than Maryland without,  
Pennsylvania, nor New-York without the  
concurrence of Boston, &amp;c.  
  
These projects were superceded for the j  
moment by that of the Convention at An­  
napolis, 1786, and forever by the Conven-1  
tion at Philadelphia in 1787, and the con-J  
stitution which was the fruit of it.  
There is a passage in Mr. Neckar’s|  
work on the finances of France which af­  
fords a signal illustration of the difficulty!  
of collecting in contiguous communities,  
indirect taxes, when not the same in all,  
by violent means resorted to against smug­  
gling from one to another of them. Pre­  
vious to the late Revolutionary war in that  
country, the taxes tfere of very different  
rates in the different provinces; particu­  
larly the tax on salt, which was high in the  
interior provinces and low in the maritime,  
and the tax on tobacco, which was very  
high in general, whilst in some of the pro­  
vinces the article was altogether free. The  
consequence was, that the standing armv  
of patrol against smuggling, had swollen  
the number to twenty-three thousand ; the  
annual arrest of men, women and children,  
engaged in smuggling, to five thousand five  
hundred and fifty ; and the number annu­  
ally arrested on account of salt and tobac­  
co alone, to seventeen or eighteen hun­  
dred, more than three hundred of whom  
were consigned to the terrible punishment  
of the Galleys.  
May it not be regarded among the pro­  
vidential isiessings of these States, that-,  
tthcingeogniphical relations, multiplied as  
they will be by artificial channels of inter­  
course, give such additional force to the  
many obligations to cherish that-union  
which alone secures their peace, their safe­  
ty, and their prosperity 1 Apart from the  
more obvious and awful consequences of  
their entire separation into independent  
sovereignties, it is worthy of special consi­  
deration, that, divided from each other as  
they must be by narrow waters and terri­  
torial lines merely, the facility of surrepti- j  
tious introductions of contraband articles,  
would defeat every at&#x27;empt at revenue in  
the easy and direct modes of impost and  
excise; so that while their expenditures  
would be necessarily and vastly increased  
by their new situation, they would, in pro­  
viding for them, be limited to direct taxes  
on land or other property: to arbitrary  
assessment on invisible funds, n.nd to an  
odious tax on persons.  
You will observe that I have confined  
myself, in what has been said, to the con­  
stitutionality, and expediency of the powei  
in Congress to encourage domestic pro­  
ducts by regulations of commerce. In the  
exercise of the power, they are responsible  
to their constituents; whose right and du­  
ty it is, in that as in all other cases, to  
bring their measures to the test of justice  
and of tlie general good

EXTRACT.  
** The Constitution vests in Congress, expressly,  
j “ the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, ira­  
| ports, and excises;” and n tho power to regulate  
hade.”  
” That the former power, If not particularly ex­  
pressed, would have been included in the latter as  
one of the objects of a general power to regulate  
trade, is not necessarily impugned by its being so  
expressed. Examples of this sort cannot some­  
times he easily avoided, and are to be seen else­  
where in the Constitution. Thus the power *• to  
define and punish offences against the law of na­  
tions,” includes the power, afterwards particularly  
expressed, “ to make rules concerning captures,  
file, from offending neutrals.” So also a power “ to  
coin money” would doubtless include that of  
“ regulating its value,” had not the latter power  
been expressly inserted. The term taxes, if  
standing alone, would certainly have included du­  
ties, imposts, and excises. In another clau-c it is  
said, “ no tax or duties shall be laid on exjiorts  
&amp;c.” Here the two terms are used as synony­  
~5Ug. Aufl in another clause, whore it is said  
“ no State shall lay imposts, or duties, &amp;.c.” the  
terms imposts and duties arc synonymous. Plco­  
na-ra«, &#x27;autologies, and the promiscuous use of  
terms and phrases, differing in their shades of  
meaning, (always to be expounded with reference  
to the context and under the rontrol of the general  
character and manifest scope of the instrument in  
which they are found,) are to be ascribed, some­  
times to the purpose of greater caution; some­  
times to the imperfections of language, aud some­  
times to the imperfection of man himself. In this  
view of the subject, it was quite natural, howev­  
er certainly the general power to regulate trade  
might include a power to impose duties on it, not to  
omit it in a clause enumerating the several modes  
of revenue, authorised by the Constitution. In  
few cases could the •* ex majori cautela” occur  
with more claim to respect.”  
Here it will be seen, that Mr. M., so far from  
differing from Mr. Adama in his contrivance for  
battering down all the restraining provisions of  
the Constitution, has greatly improved upon the  
original discovery. Mr. A. thought it necessary  
to free himself from the written restraints imposed  
upon him in the Constitution, to amalgamate the  
whole of the specifically granted powers, into one  
grand momentum of power, and that to be backe

tn offending neutrals.”  
  
So also a power “to coin money” would  
doubtles include that of “ regulating its  
value,” had not the latter power been ex­  
pressly inserted. The term taxes, if stand­  
ing alone, would certainly have included  
duties, imposts, and excises. In another  
clause it is said, “no tax or duties shall  
be laid on exports, &amp;c.” Here the two  
terms are used as synonymous. And in  
another clause, where it is said “ no State  
shall lay any imposts, or duties &amp;c.” the  
terms imposts and duties are synonymous.  
Pleonasms, tautologies, and the promis­  
cous use of terms and phrases, differing  
in their shades of meaning, (always to be  
expounded with reference to the context  
and under the control of the general char­  
acter and manifest scope of the instru­  
ment in which they are found) are to be  
ascribed, sometimes to the purpose of  
greater caution, sometimes to the im­  
perfeotiooe of language, and sometimes  
to the imperfection of man himself. In  
this view of the subject,it was quite natural  
however certainly the sneral power to  
regulate trade might include a power to  
impose duties on it, not to omit it in a  
clause enumerating the several modes of  
revenue, authorized by the Constitution.  
In few cases could the “ex majori caute­  
la” occur with more claim to respect.  
Nor can it be inferred, that a power to  
regulate trade does not involve a power  
to tax it, from the distinction made in the  
original controversy with Great Britain,  
between a power to regulate trade with  
the Colonies, and a power to tax them.  
A power to regulate trade between diffe­  
rent parts of the Empire, was confessedly  
necessary—and was admitted to lie, as far  
as that was the case, in the British Par­  
liament ; the taxing part being at the same  
time denied to the Parliament, and as­  
serted to be necessarily inherent in the  
Colonial Legislatures, as sufficient, and  
the only safe depositories of the taxing  
power. So difficult was it, nevertheless,  
to maintain the distinction in practice,  
that the ingredient of revenue was occa­  
sionally overlooked or* disregarded in the  
British regulations, as in the duty on su­  
gar and molasses imported into the Col­  
onies. And it was fortunate that the at­  
tempt at an internal and direct tax, in the  
case of the Stamp Act, produced a radi­  
cal examination of the subject before a  
regulation of trade with a view to revenue  
had grown into an established authority.  
One thing at least is certain, that the  
main and admitted object of the Parlia­  
mentary regulations of trade with the  
Colonies, was the encouragement of man­  
ufactures in Great Britain.  
But the present question is unconnect­  
with the former relations between Great  
Britain and her colonies, which were of  
a peculiar, a complicated, and in several  
respects, of an undefined character. It  
is a simple question under the constitution  
of the United States, whether “ the power  
to regulate trade with foreign nations” as  
a distinct and substantive item in the enu­  
merated powers embraces the object of  
encouraging by duties, restrictions, and  
prohibitions,the manufactures and products  
of the country ? And the affirmative must  
be inferred from the following considera­  
tions *.—  
1. The meaning of the phrase ‘ to reg­  
ulate trade,’ must be sought in the gene­  
ral use of it; in other words, in the objects  
to which the power was generally under­  
stod to be applicable, when the phrase was  
inserted in the Constitution.  
2. The power has been understood and  
used by all commercial and manufacturing  
nations, as embracing the object of en­  
couraging manufactures. It is believ­  
ed that not a single exception can be  
named.  
3. This has been particularly the case  
with Great Britain, whose commercial  
vocabulary is the parent of ours. A pri­  
mary object of her commercial regulations  
is well known to have been the protec­  
tion and encouragement of her manufac­  
tures.  
4. Such was understood to be a proper  
use of the power by the States most pre­  
pared for manufacturing industry, while  
retaining the power over their foreign  
trade.  
5. Such a use of the power by Congress,  
accords with the intention and expecta­  
tion of the States, in transferring the  
power over trade from themselves to the  
Government of the United States. This  
was emphatically the case in the Eastern,  
the more manufacturing Members of the  
Confederacy. Hear the language held  
in the Convention of Massachusetts:—  
By Mr. Dawes, an advocate for the  
Constitution, it was observed, “ Our  
manufactures are another great subject  
which has received no encouragement by  
national duties on foreign manufactures,  
and they never can by any authority in  
the old Confederation. Again, ”If we  
wish to encourage our own manufactures,  
to preserve our own commerce, to raise  
the value of our own lands, we must give  
Congress the powers in question.”  
By Mr. Widgery, an opponent All  
we hear is, that the merchant and farmer  
will flourish, and that th? mechanick and  
tradesman are to make their fortunes di­  
rectly, if the Constitution goes down.”  
The convention of Massachusetts was  
the only one in New-England whose de­  
bates have been preserved. But it can­  
not be doubted that the sentiment there  
expressed was common to the other States  
in that quarter, more especially to Con­  
necticut and Rhode-Island, the most  
thickly peopled of all the States, and hav

ing, of course, their thoughts most turned  
to the subject of manufactures. A like  
inference may be confidently applied to  
New-Jersey, whose debates in Conven­  
tion have not been preserved.  
In the populous and manufacturing  
State of Pennsylvania, a partial account  
only of the debates having been published,  
nothing certain is known of what passed  
in her Convention on this point. But  
ample evidence may be found elsewhere,  
that regulations of trade, for the encour­  
agement of manufactures, were consider­  
ed as within the power to be granted to  
the new Congress, as well as within the&#x27;  
scope of the national policy. Of the  
States south of Pennsylvania, the only  
two in whose Conventions the debates  
have been preserved are Virginia and  
North-Carolina, and from these no ad­  
verse inferences can be drawn. Nor is  
there the slightest indication that eith4  
of the two States farthest south, whose  
debates in Convention if preserved have  
not been made publick, viewed the en­  
couragement of manufactures, as not with­  
in the general power over trade to be  
transferred to the Government of the Unit­  
ed States.  
6. If Congress have not the power, it is  
annihilated for the nation ; a policy with­  
out example in any other nation, and not  
within the reason of the solitary one in our  
own. The example alluded to, is the  
prohibition of a tax on exports, which re­  
sulted from the apparent impossibility of  
raising, in that mode, a revenue from the  
States proportioned to the ability to pay  
it—the ability of some being derived, in  
a great measure, not from their’’exports,  
but from their fisheries, from their freights,  
and from commerce at large, in some of  
its branches altogether exteri&amp;l to the  
United States; the profits from all which,  
being invisible and intangible, would es­  
cape a tax on exports. A tax on imports,  
on the other hand, being a tax on con­  
sumption, which is in proportion to the  
ability of the consumers, whensoever de­  
rived, was free from that inequality.  
7. If revenue be the sole object of a  
legitimate impost, and the encouragement  
of domestick articles be not within the  
power of regulating trade, it would follow  
that no monopolizing or unequal regula­  
tions of foreign nations eould be counter­  
acted ; that neither the staple articles of  
subsistence, nor the essential implement­  
for the publick safety, could, under any  
circumstances, be insured or fostered at  
home by regulations of commerce, the  
usual and most convenient mode of pro­  
viding for both; and that the American  
navigation, though the source of naval de­  
fence, of a cheapening competition in  
carrying out valuable and bulky articles to  
market, and of an independent carriage  
of them during foreign wars, when a for«  
eign navigation might be withdrawn, must  
be at once abandoned, or speedily des­  
troyed ; it being evident that a tonnage  
duty in foreign ports against our vessels,  
and an exemption from such a duty in  
our ports, in favour of foreign vesssels,  
must have the inevitable effect of banish­  
ing ours from the ocean.  
To assume a power to protect our navi­  
gation, and the cultivation and fabrication  
of all articles requisite for the publick  
safety, as incident to the war power, would  
be a more latitudinary construction of the  
text of the Constitution, than to consider  
it as embraced by the specified power to  
regulate trade ; a power which has been  
exercised by all nations for those purposes,  
and which effects those purposes with less  
of interference with the authority and  
conveniency of the States, than might re­  
sult from internal and direct modes of  
encouraging the articles, any of which  
modes would be authorized, as far as  
deemed “ necessary and proper,” by con­  
sidering the power as an incidental pow­  
er.  
8. That the encouragement of manu­  
factures was an object of the power to  
regulate trade, is proved by the use made  
of the power for that object, in the first  
session of the First Congress under the  
Constitution ; when among the members  
present were so many who had been  
members of the Federal Convention which  
framed the Constitution, and of the State  
Conventions which ratified it; eich ot  
these classes consisting also of members  
who had opposed and who had espoused  
the Constitution in its actual form. It  
does not appear from the printed pro­  
ceedings of Congress on that occasion,  
that the power was denied by any of them.  
And it may be remarked, that Members  
from Virginia, in particular, as well of the  
anti-federal as the federal party, the names  
then distinguishing those who had opposed  
and those who had approved the Consti­  
tution, did not hesitate to propose duties  
and to suggest even prohibitions in favour  
of several articles of her production.  
By one a duty was proposed on mine­  
ral coal, in favour of the Virginia coal  
pits; by another, a duty on hemp was pro­  
posed, to encourage the growth of that  
article : and by a third, a prohibition even  
of foreign beef was suggested, as a mea­  
sure of sound policy. [See Lloyd’s De­  
bates.]  
A further evidence in support of the  
constitutional power to protect and foster  
manufactures by regulations of trade, an  
evidence that ought, of itself, to settle the  
question, is the uniform and practical  
sanction given to the power, by the Gene­  
ral Government, for nearly forty years;  
with a concurrence or acquiscence of ev-  
  
etr State Government, throughout the  
stoe period, and, it may be added,  
LU?&quot;*1 a** party which  
malted theperiod. No novel construction,  
however ingeniously devised, or however  
res ectable and patriotick its patrons, can  
wit stand the weight of such authorities,  
or ’ te unbroken current of so prolonged  
ant universal a practice. And well it is  
tha this cannot be done, without the in­  
tcrfention of the same authority which  
male the Constitution. If it could be so  
dfeife, there would be an end to that sta­  
biHy of Government, and in Laws, which  
is Essential to good goverment and good  
lavs, a stability the want of which is the  
imjmta(ion which has at all times been  
letelledagainst Republicanism, with most  
effect, by its most dexterous adversaries.  
Tke imputation ought never, therefore, to  
be countenanced, by innovating construc­  
ts &gt;1 without any plea of a precipitancy,  
or,a paucity of the constructive precedents  
they oppose; without any appeal to mate­  
rial facts newly brought to light; and  
without any claim to a better knowledge  
of the original evils and inconveniences,  
for which remedies were needed, the very  
best keys to the true object and meaning  
of all laws and constitutions.  
And may it not be fairly left to the un­  
biassed judgment of all men of experience  
and of intelligence, to decide, which is  
most to be relied on for a sound and safe  
test of the meaning of a Constitution, a  
uniform interpretation by all the succes­  
sive authorities under if, commencina  
with its birth, and continued for a lon°  
period through the varied state of politi­  
cal contests; or the opinion of every  
new Legislature, heated as it may be by  
the strife of parties—or warped, as often  
happens, by the eager pursuit of some  
favourite object—or carried away, possi­  
bly, by the powerful eloquence or captiva­  
ting address ofa few popular statesmen,  
themselves, perhaps, influenced by the  
same misleading causes? If the latter  
test-is to prefail, every new legislative  
opinion might make a new Constitution  
as the foot of every new Chancellor would  
make a new standard of measure.  
It is seenJwith no little surprise, that  
an attempt has been made, in a highly  
respectable Quarter, and at length reduc­  
ed to a resolution, formerly proposed in  
Congress, to substitute, for the power of  
Congress to regulate trade so as to encour­  
age manufactures, a power in the several  
States to do so, with the consent of that  
body , and this expedient is derived from  
a clause in the tenth section of article  
first of the Constitution, which saysNo  
■fftate&#x27;uiiatt; without the consent of Con­  
gress, lay any impost* or duties on im­  
ports or exports, except what may be ab­  
solutely necessary for executing its inspec­  
tion laws; and the net produce of all  
duties, and imposts, laid by any State on  
imports and exports, shall be for the use  
of the Treasury of the United States; and  
all such laws shall be subject to the revis­  
ion and control of the Congress.”  
To say nothing of the clear indications  
in the Journal of the Convention of 1787,  
that the clause was intended merely to  
provide for expenses incurred by particu­  
lar States, in their Inspection laws, and in  
such improvements as they might choose  
to make in their harbours and rivers, with  
the sanction of Congress—objects to  
which the reserved power has been appli­  
ed, in several instances, at the request of  
Virginia and Georgia—how could it ever  
be imagined that any State would wish to  
tax its own trade for the encouragement  
of manufactures, if possessed of the au­  
thority, or could, in fact, do so, if wishing  
it?  
  
A tax on imports would be a tax on its  
own consumption ; and the net proceeds  
going, according to the clause, not into  
its own Treasury, but into the Treasury  
of the United States, the State would tax  
itself separately for the equal gain of all  
the other States; and as far as the manu­  
factures, so encouraged, might succeed in  
ultimately increasing the stock in market  
and lowering the price by competition,  
this advantage, also, procured at the sole  
expense of the State, would be common  
to all the others.  
But the very suggestions of such an ex­  
pedient to any State, would have an air  
of mockery, when its experienced im­  
practicability is taken into view. No one  
who recollects or recurs to the period  
when the power over commerce was in  
the individual States, and seperate at­  
tempts were made to tax, or otherwise  
regulate it, need be told that the attempts  
were not only abortive, but, by demon­  
strating the necessity of general and uni­  
form regulations, gave the original im­  
pulse to the constitutional reform which  
provided for such regulations.  
To refer a State, therefore, to the ex­  
ercise of a power, as reserved to her by  
the Constitution, the impossibility of ex­  
ercising which was an inducement to  
adopt the Constitution, is, of ail remedial  
devices, the last that ought to be brought  
forward. And what renders it the more  
extraordinary is, that, as the tax on com­  
merce, as far as it could be separately  
collected, instead of belonging to the  
Treasury of the State, as previous to the  
Constitution, would be a tribute to the  
United States, the State would be in a  
worse condition, after the adoption of the  
Constitution, than before, in reference to  
an important interest, the improvement  
of which was a particular object in adopt­  
ing the Constitution.  
Were Congress to make the proposed  
  
declaration of consent to State tariffs in  
favour of State manufactures, and the  
permitted attempts did not defeat them­  
selves, what would be the situation of  
States deriving their foreign supplies  
through the ports of other States ? It is  
evident that they might be compelled to  
pay, in their consumption of particular  
articles imported, a tax for the common  
treasury, not common to all the States,  
without having any manufacture or prod­  
uct of their own, to partake of the con­  
templated benefit.  
Of the impracticability of separate reg­  
ulations of trade, and the resulting neces­  
sity of general regulations, no State was  
more sensible than Virginia. She was  
accordingly among the most earnest for  
granting to Congress a power adequate  
to the object. On more occasions than  
one in the proceedings of her Legislative  
councils it was recited “ that‘the relative  
situation of the States had

e  
publick revenue as it ought to contribute,  
&amp;c.”  
During the delays and discouragements  
experienced in the attempts to invest  
Congress with the necessary powers, the  
State of Virginia made various trials of  
what could be done by her individual  
laws. She ventured on duties and im­  
posts as a source of revenue : resolutions  
were passed at one time to encourage  
and protect her own navigation and ship  
buildings ; and in consequence of com­  
plaints and petitions from Norfolk, Alex­  
andria, and other places, against the  
monopolizing navigation laws of Great  
Britain, particularly in the trade between  
the United States and the British West  
Indies, she deliberated, with a purpose  
controlled only by the inefficiency of sep­  
arate measures, on the experiment of  
forcing a reciprocity by prohibitory regu­  
lations of her own. [See Journal of the  
House of Delegates in 1785.]  
The effect of her separate attempts to  
raise revenue by duties on imports, soon  
appeared in representations from her  
merchants, that the commerce of the State  
was banished by them into other channels,  
especially of Maryland, where imparts  
were less burdened than in Virginia.  
[See Ditto for 1786.]  
Such a tendency of separate regulations  
was indeed too manifest to escape antici­  
pation. Among the projects prompted  
by the want of a Federal authority over  
commerce, was that of a concert first  
proposed on the part of Maryland for a  
uniformity of regulations between the two  
States, and Commissioners were appoint­  
ed for that purpose. It was soon per­  
ceived, however, that the concurrence of  
Pennsylvania was as necessary to Mary­  
land as of Maryland to Virginia, and the  
concurrence of Pennsylvania was accord-  
ingly invited. But Pennsylvania could |  
no more concur without New-York than  
Maryland without Pennsylvania, nor  
New- York without the concurrence of  
Boston, &amp;c.  
These projects were superseded for  
the moment by that of the Convention at  
Annapolis in 1786, and forever by the  
Convention at Philadelphia in 1787, and  
the Constitution which was the fruit of  
it.  
  
There is a passage in Mr. Necker’s  
work on the finances of France which  
affords a signal illustration of the difficul­  
ty of collecting, in contiguous communi­  
ties, indirect taxes, when not the same in  
all, by violent means resorted to against  
smuggling from one to another of them.  
Previous to the late Revolutionary war in  
that country, the taxes were of very differ­  
ent rates in the different Provinces : par­  
ticularly the tax on salt, which was high  
in the interiour provinces and low in the  
maratime ; and the tax on tobacco, which  
was very high in general, whilst in some  
of the provinces the use of the article  
was altogether free. The consequence  
was, that the standing army of patrols  
against smuggling had swoln to the num­  
ber of twenty-three thousand ; the annual  
arrest of men, women, and children, en­  
gaged in smuggling, to five-thonsand five­  
hundred and fifty ; and the number annu­  
ally arrested on account of salt and tobac­  
co alone, to seventeen or eighteen hun­  
dred, more than three hundred of whom  
were consigned to the terrible punishment  
of the Gallies.  
  
May it not be regarded as among the  
providential blessings to these States, that  
their geographical relations, multiplied  
as they will be by artificial channels of  
intercourse, give such additional force to  
the many obligations to cherish that uni­  
on which alone secures their peace, their  
safety, and tl’eir prosperity ? A part  
from the more obvious and awful conse­  
quences of their entire separation into  
independent sovereignties, it is worthy of  
special consideration, that, divided from  
each other as they must be by parrow  
waters and territorial lines merely, the  
facility of surreptitious introductions of  
contraband articles, would defeat every  
attempt at revenue in the easy and indi­  
rect modes of impost and excise ; so that  
whilst their expenditures would be ne-  
  
cessarily and vastly increased by their’new  
situation, they would, in providing for  
them, be limited to direct taxes on land  
or otherjproperty ;,to arbitrary assessments  
on invisible funds, and to the odious tax  
on persons.  
You will observe that I have confined  
myself, in what has been said, to the con­  
stitutionality and expediency of the power  
in Congress to encourage domestic prod­  
ucts by regulations of commerce. In the  
exercise of the power, they are responsi­  
ble to their constituents; whose right  
and duty it is,in that as in all other cases,  
to bring their measures to the test of jus­  
tice and of the general good

. LETTER I.  
&#x27; atoBTritua, sarT. 18, 1328.  
..Sear 5tr . - Your Jte . letter remind  
the of out conversation on the&#x27; constitu  
tionality of the power or Congress to im  
pose a tariff lor the encouragement ol  
manufactures t and of rnr nromise to  
sketch the p-rounds of the confident onin  
ion &#x27; 1 had expressed,&#x27; iKia&#x27;iV w at among  
the powers vested ttt that body. ,. 1 pad  
not iwrec-tten my promiaeand- bad, eMn  
begun the task of fulfilling it: but frequent  
inte rfirptidhsV&#x27;from  
followed by a bilious indisposition, 1  
have not been able soon to comply with  
vour request. The subioined view&#x27; of  
the subject might have been advantage­  
ously expanded ; but I leave that im­  
proveme n t to your o wn reflections and  
nseai chos.  
- The Constitution vests in Congress,  
expressly, &quot;the power to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, iniposti, and excises;&quot;  
and &quot; the power to reHUlute trade.&quot; I  
That the former power, if not partic  
ularly expressed, woiiltl he lx-n inclu­  
ded in the latter as ne if the objects of  
a general power to iejrul:tte tr?clf, is j;o.t  
neceaskriry.&#x27;Tmpun&#x27;rd&#x27; By its beiti so ti­  
prcssed. ExampUs oi- tliis sect cannoi  
sometimes he easily avoided, and are to  
be seen elae where in the Constitution.  
Thus the power &quot;to Refine and punish  
offence, against the law of nations,&quot; tu­  
cludes the power, ufterwards particular­  
ly expresset!, to make rules concerning  
canturesi Scv frotrr ofTending&#x27;neutrals.  
So alsa a powerto coin money&quot; would  
doubtless include that of regulating ilsval­  
ue&quot;had not the latter power been express­  
ly inserted. The term taxes, if standing  
alone, would certainly have excluded du­  
ties, imposts, and excises. , Ii another  
clause it is said, &quot;no tax or duties shall  
be laid on exports, fcc.&quot; Here the two  
terms are used as synonymous. And in  
another clause, where it is said &quot;no  
State shall lay any imposts, or duties,  
Sec.&quot; the terms imposts and duties are  
synonymous. Pleorasms, tautologies,  
and the&#x27; promiscuous use of terms and  
phrases, differing in their shades of mea­  
ning,&#x27; (always to be expounded with re­  
ference to the context and under the con­  
trol of the general character &quot;and mani­  
fest scope of the instrument in which  
they are found) are to be ascribed, some  
times to the purpose of greater caution ;  
sometimes to the imperfections of lang  
uage, Sc sometimes to the imperfection of  
i1l)ijj&#x27;1i1miellnl:iriews &#x27;oniwlwirjret  
it was quite natural, hovever certai  
not to otnit  
the several modes of revenue, authorised  
by the Constitution. In few cases could  
the ex majori cautela&quot; occur with more  
claim to respect.&#x27; , .  
Nor can it be inferred, that a power  
to regulate trade does not involve a pow­  
er to tax it: from the distinction made in  
the original controversy with Oreat Uri-  
with Colonies, and a power to tax them.  
A powerto regulate trade between differ-  
efirTpinnh  
necessary i and waiaumittea to lie, as tar  
as that was the case, in the British Parlia  
ment ; the taxing part being at the same  
time denied to the Parliament, and asser  
ted to be necessarily inherent in the Co  
lonial Legislatures, as sufficient and the  
only safe depositories of the taxing pow­  
er. ,A So difficult was it, nevertheless, to  
maintain the distinctiorr&#x27;in prcaiice. thai

allv overlooked or disregarded in the  
British regulations, as in the duty oo su­

case of the Stamp Act, produced a radi

cat examination &#x27;of the aubject before a  
regulation of trade with riew to reven-  
  
uo bad grown Into an established autnor  
ity. V One thing at least is certain, that  
the main and admitted object of the Par  
liamentary reaiona of trade&#x27;withhe  
Colonies, was the encouragement of man-  
vfacturulB Great Britain.  
. But the present question ii. unconnec  
ted with tb. former relations between  
Great Britain and7 her colonies, which  
were of&#x27; a eeculiar, a &#x27;complicated, and,  
in se veral respects,-of ao undefined char  
acter. It is a atmplequestlou under tne  
Constitution of the Uoiied States, whe  
ther the power to regulate twitli  
foreign &#x27;nations&quot; at a diiinct.nw5b-  
taatiye item in the enumerated powers,  
embraces the object or encouraging by  
duties, restrictions and prohibitions, tne  
manufactures and products of the coun  
try ? And the affirmative must be infer  
red from the following considerations i  
1. The meaning of the phrase &quot; to  
regulate trade,&quot;-mtitt be sought ia the  
general use ol it in other words, in tne  
objects to which the power was gener  
ally understood to be applicable, when  
the phrase was inserted in the constitu  
tion. &#x27;: - -- , . &#x27; ....  
. 3. The power hat been vndecstood and  
used br all commercial and manufactur  
ing nations, as embracing the object of  
encouraging manuiaciurcs. it is ucucvcu  
&quot; . v. I  
that not a single exception can be named.  
3. This has been particularly the case  
with Great Britain, whose commercial  
vocabulary is the parent of ours. A&#x27; pri  
mary object of &quot;KcHcdMitnertral regula  
tions is well known to have been the pro-  
.tectipn.aftd encovragement of ber manu  
faclures. . &#x27;  
4neh traruflderttoo dtccbea proper  
use of the power by tbe States most pre­  
pared for manufacturing industry, whilst  
reuiuimg iuc jiuwer  
trade.  
5. Such a use of the power, by Con  
gress,-accord a with the intention and ex­  
pectation of the States, in transferring  
the pOVef over trade from themselves 10  
the Government of the United States.  
This was emphatically the case in the  
&quot;&#x27;2,;il M.m  
anufacturinff Mem-  
I!asiern. the more m  
bers of the Confederacy. Hear the Ian  
guage held in the Convention of Massa­  
chusetts.Ey Mr. -&#x27;Dawes, an adyqctjte qrjhe.  
ConHtt t utlon, i it w ats tlseryed, Our  
&quot; rtiflfiu fact urea are another preat ub-  
ject which has received no encourage­  
&#x27; menl by r ational duties oo foreign man­  
&quot; ufaciures, and Ihcy never can by any  
authority in the old Confederation.&quot;  
&quot; Again, If we wish to encourage our men  
&quot; manvfacturtt, to preserve pur own com-  
tnerce, to raise-tlie-yalue-ef- ourowo  
&#x27; lands, we must- Rive Coiigress tbe pow-  
ers in question.  
By Mr. VV id eery, an opponent : &#x27; AH  
&quot; we hear is, that the merchant and far­  
&quot; mer will flourish, and that the methan-  
ic and tradesman are to make their for­  
&quot; tunes directly, if the Constitution goes  
down.&quot; - -  
The Convention of Massachusetts was  
the only one in New England whose de  
bates have been preserved. But it can­  
not be doub&#x27;ed that the sentiments there  
expressed were common to the Other  
States in .that quarter, more especially  
to Connecticut and Khode Island, the  
most thickly peopled of all the States,  
and having, of course,&quot; their thoughts  
most turned to the subject or manulac  
turcs. A like inference may be confi  
dently applied to New Jersey, whose de  
bates in Convention have not been pre  
served. In the populous and manufac  
turing:.S.W  
account only of the debates having been  
published, nothing certain is-known of  
the encouragement of manufactures, were  
considered as within the power to be  
granted to the -new Congress, as well as  
within the scope of the national policy  
Of the States South of Pennsylvania, the  
only two in whose Conventions the de  
bates have been preserved, are Virginia  
and North .Carolina,, and Irom these no  
advarttninforencts can be dtawn.,Jor is  
there the slightest indication that either  
of the two States farthest South, whose  
cpuragement of manufactures, as not  
within the general powetLSver trade to  
he transferred to the Uovernment of tbe  
United States.  
6. If Congress have not the power, it  
is annihilated for the nation&#x27;) a policy  
without pxnmnle in nv other nation, and  
not, within the reason of the solitary one

bulky articles to market, and of an, in­  
dependent carriage of them during fo-  
reign ware, when a foreign &#x27; navigation  
might be withdrawn, must be at one  
abandoned, or speedily destroyed : it be­  
ing evident that a toonage duty in fo­  
reign ports against&#x27;our vessels and an ex­  
emption from such a doty in our ports,  
in favor of foreign vessels, must bare the  
inevitable effect of banishing ours from

.To assume a pover to protect our na  
vigation, and the cultivation and fabrica­  
tion of all articles requisite for the pub­  
lie safety, as incident to the war power,5  
tion ol tne text ol the Constitution, than  
to consider it as embraced by the specifi­  
ed power to regulate trade a power  
which has been, exercised by all nations  
for those purposes, ant! which effects  
those purposes with less of interference  
with, the authority and convenience of  
the States, than might result from inter­  
nal and direct modes of encouraging the  
articles, any of , which modes would be  
authorised, far as deemed &quot; necessary  
. h. Mh.iJ,iBa; ,K. n &#x27;  
and proper,&quot;, by considering the power  
as an incidental power.  
C. That the encouragement of manu  
factures was an object of the power to re-  
gnhrfraiJfjpjrwrjO  
of the power for, that object, iu the first  
session of the llrst Congress under -tho  
Constitution when among the members  
present were so raany who had been  
members of the Federal Convention  
which framed theConstitution, and of tho-State  
Conventions which ratified it ) each,  
of these classes consisting also of inm- -  
bers wbo had opposed and who had es­  
poused, &#x27;the Consti&#x27;ution in its actual  
form.- It does not appear from the print  
ed proceedings of Congress on that oc­  
casion, that the power was denied by any  
of them. And it may be remarked, that  
Members from Virginia, in particular.  
as well of the anti-federal as the federal  
party, .the names then distinguishing  
those who had opposed and those who  
had approved the Constitution, did not  
hesitate to propose duties and &#x27;to suggest  
even,&#x27; prohibitions in lavour of several  
articles of her production. By one a du­  
ty was proposed on mineral coal, in fa  
vour of the Virginia coal pita by ano  
ther, a auty on nemp was proposed, to  
encourage the &#x27;growth of that article!  
and by a third, a prohibition even of for  
eign beef was suggested, as a measure of  
sound policy. I see Lloyd&#x27;s JJebates.  
A further evidence in support of the  
constitutional power to protect snd.fostcf  
manufactures by regulations of trade, an

Congress to regulate traae so as to en  
courage manufactures, a power in thescv

from a clause in the tenth section of ar-

- During the, delays and discourage­  
ments experienced in the attempts to . in­  
vest Congress w ith the necessary powers,  
the State of Virginia made various trials  
of what couW begone by her individual  
laws. She ventured on duties and im­  
posts as a source of revenue ; &#x27;Resolu­  
tions were passed at one time to encour­  
age and protect her own navigation and  
ship building; and in consequence of  
complaints and petitions from Norfolk,  
Alexafijd.  
monopolizing navigation laws of Great  
&#x27;BHtin,i&quot;particttiaHyitfMj itrad ieiutm  
the United States and tU BrUith Jits! In­  
die, she deliberated, with a purpose con­  
trolfed only by the ineflicacy of separate  
meaAU on the experiment of forcing a  
reSlfpTtfCuy by prohibitory regulations of  
her own. See Journal of House of Del­  
egates in 1786.  
foe effect of. her separate attempts to  
raise revenue by duties, on imports, soon  
appeared in representations from her  
merchants, that the. commerce of the  
State was banished by them into other  
channels, especially of Maryland, where  
imports were less burdened than in Vir­  
ginia. Sec iDo. for 1786.  
Such a tendency of separate regula­  
tions was indeed too manifest to, escape  
anticipation. Among the projects promp­  
ted by the want of a Federal authority o­  
vcr commerce, was that of a concert  
first proposed on the part of Maryland  
for a uniformity of regulations between  
the tw6 States, and Commissioners were  
.appointed for that purpose. It was soon  
&#x27;Ite.fcseWr.tW.-bowcvei-,. that the cpnejur­  
rr n.-.e nf Pennsylvania was as necessary to  
Mary land as of Maryland to Virginia...nd  
he concurrence of Pennsylvania was ac­  
cordingly ipvitedButPenn-iylyania could  
no more concur without New&#x27; York tTi&#x27;aii  
Maryland without . P jny J vani a. tt or N..  
Yorjt without the concurrence of Boston,  
These projects were superseded for the  
moment by that of the Convention at An­  
napolis in 1786. and forever by the Con­  
vention at Philadelphia in 1T87, and the  
Constitution which was the fruit of it.  
There is a passage in Mr. ..Necker&#x27;s  
work on the finances of FranceTvhich af­  
fords a signal illustration of the difficul  
ty of collecting, in contiguous commu­  
nities, indirect taxes, when not the same  
in all, by the violent means, resorted toa-gatnst-amuggting  
- from one- to- another.  
brthemr&quot;&quot;Pi&#x27;evioUS16 &quot;fhe&#x27;late &quot;Revnltr-  
lionary war in that country, the taxes  
were of very different rates in-the-difTer-ent  
Provinces,, particularly .. the tax on  
salt, which was high in ihe interior pro­  
vinces and low in the luaritimr, and the  
tax on tobacco, which was very high ir  
general, whilst in some of the provinces  
the ttse50heraeiic.fc  
The consequence was, that the standing  
army of patrols against smuggling had  
swpln to the number of.twemy three thou­  
sand the annual arrest of men, women,  
and children, engaged in smuggling, to  
five thousand five hundred and fifty ; and  
the number annually arrested on account  
of salt and tobacco alone, to seventeen or  
eighteen hundred, more than three hun­  
dred of whbrii were consigned to the ter­  
rible punishment of the -Gallies.  
May it not be regarded as among the  
providential blessings to these States,  
that their geographical relations, multi­  
plied as they willbe by artificial chan­  
nels of intercourse, give such additional  
force to the many obligations to cherish  
that union which alone secures their  
peace, their safety, and their prosperity!  
Apart from the more obvious and awful  
consequences of their entire separation

In support of the right of Congress to pass the  
Tariff acts.  
Short history of the origin and progress of the  
Tariff acts, passed by Congress, and of the claims  
setup to the power of protecting manufactures.  
The following are the unqualified assertions  
made by Mr. M.—  
“ A further evidence in support of the constitu  
tional power to protect and foster manufactures by  
regulations of trade, an evidence that ought of it­  
self to settle the question, is the uniform and  
practical sanction given to the power, by the Gen­  
eral Government, for nearly lorly years; with a  
concurrence or acquiescence of every State Go­  
vernment, throughout the same period; and.it may  
he added, through all the vic.ssitudes of party  
which inaiked the period. No novel construction,  
however ingeniously devised, or however re-pec­  
tablo and patriotic its patrons, ran withstand the  
weight of such authorities, or the unbroken cur­  
rent of so piolongod and universal a practice.&quot;

tions to the view of this subject presented by this distinguished  
statesman. But first let us quote his words.  
  
** But the present question is unconnected with the former relations  
between Great Britain and her colonies, which were of a peculiar, a com-  
plicated, and, im several respects, of an undefined character. It is a  
simple question under the Constitution of the United States, whether  
**the power to regulate trade with foreign nations” as a distinet and sub-  
stantive item in the enumerated powers embraces the object of encourag-  
ing by duties, restrictions and prohibitions, the manufactures and pro-  
ducts of the country? And the affirmative must be inferred from the  
following considerations :  
  
“1. The meaning of the phrase ‘to regulate trade,’ must be sought  
in the general use of it; in other words, in the objects to which the power  
was generally understood to be applicable, when the phrase was msert-  
ed inthe Constitution.  
  
“2. The power has been understood and used by all commercial and  
manufacturing nations, as embracing the object of encouraging manu-  
factures. It is believed that not a single exception can be named.  
  
“3. This has been particularly the case with Great Britain, whose  
commercial vocabulary is the parent of ours. A primary object of her  
commercial regulations is well known to have been the protection aad  
encouragement of her manufactures.

*5, Such a use of the power, by Congress, accords with the intention

the war power, would be a more latitudinary construction of the text of  
the Constitution, than to cousider it as embraced by the specitied power  
to regulate trade ; a power which has been exercised by all nations for  
those purposes, and which effects those purposes with less of interference  
with the authority and conveniency of the States, than might result from  
internal and direct modes of encouraging the articles, any of which  
modes would be authorized, as far as deemed ‘ necessary and proper,’  
by considering the power as an incidental power.  
  
*s. That the encouragement of manufactures was an object of the  
power to regulate trade, is proved by the use made of the power for  
that object, in the first session of the First Congress under the Consti-  
tution; when among the members present were so many who had been  
members of the Federal Convention which framed the Constitution, and  
of the State Conventions which ratified it: each of these classes consist-  
ing also of members who had opposed and who had espoused, the Con-  
stitution in its actual form. It does not appear from the printed pro-  
ceedings of Congress 6n that oceasion, that the power was denied by  
any of them. And it may be remarked, that members from Virginia,  
in particular, as well as of the anti-federal as the federal party, the  
names then distinguishing those who had opposed and those who had  
approved the Constitution, did not hesitate to propose duties and to  
suggest even prohibitions in favour of several articles of her productions.  
By one a duty was proposed on mineral coal, in favor of the Virginia  
coal pits; by another, a duty on hemp was proposed, to encourage the  
growth of that article; and by a third, a prohibition even of foreign  
beef was suggested, as a measure of sound policy. [See Lloyd’s De-  
bates. |  
  
“A further evidence in support of the constitutional power to pro-  
tect and foster manufactures by regulations of trade, an evidence that  
ought of itself, to settle the question, is the uniform and practical sane-  
tion given to the power, by the General Government, for nearly forty  
years; with a concurrence or acquiescence of every State Government,  
throughout the same period; and, it may be added, through all the vi-  
cissitudes of party which marked the period. No novel coustruction,  
however ingemously devised, or however respectacle and patriotic its  
patrons, can withstand the weight of such authorities, or the unbroken  
current of so prolonged and universal a practice. And well it is that  
this cannot be done, without the intervention of the same authority which  
made the Constitution. Lf it could be so done there would be an end  
to that stability in Government, and in Laws, which is essential to good  
government and good laws, a stability, the want of which is the impu-  
tation which has at all times been levelled against republicanism, with  
most effect, by its most dexterous adversaries. The imputation ought  
never, therefore, to be countenanced, by innovating constructions, with-  
out any plea of a precipitancy, or a paucity of the constructive prece-  
dents they oppose; without any appeal to material facts newly brought  
to light, and without any claim to a better knowledge of the original  
evils and inconveniences, for which remedies were needed, the very best  
keys to the true object and meaning of all laws and constitutions.”

“Tt is seen with no little surprise, that an attempt has been made  
in a highly respectable quarter, and at length reduced to a resolution  
formally proposed in Congress, to substitute, for the power of Congress  
to regulate trade so as to encourage manufactures, a power in the seve-  
ral States to do so, with the consent of that body; and this expedient  
is derived from a clause in the tenth section of article first of the Con-  
stitution, which says: ‘ No state shall, without the consent of Congress,

lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be  
absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws; and the net pro-  
duce of all duties, and imposts, laid by any State on imports and ex~-  
ports, shall be for the use of the Treasury of the United States ; and all  
such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress.”  
  
“To say nothing of the clear indications in the Journal of the Con-  
vention of 1787, that the clause was intended merely to provide for ex-  
peuses incurred by particular States, in their inspection laws and im  
such improvements as they might choose to make in their harbors and  
rivers, with the sanction of Congress—objects to which the reserved  
power has been applied, in several instances, at the request of Virginia  
and Georgia—how could it ever be imagined that any State would wish  
to tax its own trade for the encouragement of manufactures, if possess-  
ed of the authority, or could, in faet, do so, if wishing it?  
  
* A tax on imports would be a tax on its own consumption; and the  
net proceeds going, according to the clause, not into its own &#x27;Treasu-  
ry, but into the Treasury of the United States, the State would tax it-  
self separately for the equal gaim of all the other States; and as far as  
the manufactures, so encouraged, might succeed in ultimately mereas-  
ing the stock in market, and lowering the price by competition, this ad-  
vantage, also, procured at the sole expense of the State, would be com-  
mon to all the others.  
  
“But the very suggestion of such an expedient to any State, would  
have an air of mockery, when its experienced impracticability is taken in-  
to view. No one, who recollects er recurs to the period when the pow-  
er over commerce was tn the individual States, and separate attempts  
were made to tax, or otherwise regulate it, need be told that the attempts  
were not only abortive, but, by demonstrating the necessity of general  
and uniform regulations, gave the original impulse to the constitutional  
reform which provided for such regulations.  
  
“To refer a State, therefore, to the exercise of a power, as reserved  
to her by the Constitution, the impossibility of exercising which was an  
inducement to adopt the Constitution, ts, of all remedial devices, the  
last that ought to he brought forward. And what renders it the more  
extraordinary, is, that, as the tax on commerce, as far as it could be  
separately collected, instead of belonging to the Treasury of the State,  
as previous to the Constitution, would be a tribute to the United States,  
the State would be in a worse condition, after the adoption of the Con-  
stitution, than before, in reference to an important interest, the improve-  
ment of which was a particular object in adopting the Constitution.”  
  
When it is maintained that Congress has not the power con-  
tended for, the question naturally presents itself, is it still in the  
States. ‘This question, however, obviously could not arise until

action of the States, was the result demonstrated  
by every such atteipt. It was the impossibility of  
regulating commerce by State legislation that, more  
than all other causes combined, led to the adoption  
of the Federal Constitution. The General Goy­  
ernment may be said, emphatically, to have had its  
birth in the necessity of a power to regulate and  
render uniform our foreign commerce.  
  
Mr MAnison, in his letter to Jos. C. Carell,  
Ee, speaking of the origin and necessity of this  
power uses the following language:  
&quot;Of the impracticability of separate regulations of trade,  
 the resulting nocessity of general regulations, no State  
was inore sensible than Virginia. She was accordingly  
among the most earnest for granting to Congres a power  
adequate to the object. on more occasions than tnerfn  
th ProSaorings of nar leeisistise e  
the proceclings of her legislative councils, it was recited,  
that the relative situation of the States had been fo  
friul, to reonire uniformity in their commercial reguls­  
tions, as the only effectual policy for obtaining, in the ports  
of foreign nations, a stipulation of privileges, reciprocal to  
1e enloyed by the subiects of such nations in the ports  
eannot fall to aries soor o pevemting animosilies, which

&quot;During the delays and discouragements experienced in  
the various attempis to invest Congreas with the nereedin  
powers, the State of Virgimia made varlous trials of wily

duties and imposts as a souree of revenue rex1nd on  
were passed at one time to encourage and protect her own  
navigation and ship building; and, in consequence of com  
plaints and petitions from Norfolk, Alerandris, and other  
places, against the monopolizing navization laws of tIreat  
Brirain, particularly in the trade between the United States  
and the British west inhies, she deliberated, with sates

&quot;A further evidence in support of the con­  
stitutional power to protect and foster man­  
ufacturers by regulations of trade, an evi  
dence that ought, of itself, to settle the  
question, is the uniform and practical sanc  
tion given to the power, by the general  
government, for nearly forty years; with a  
concurrence or acquiescence of every state  
Government, throughour the same period;  
and, it may be added, through all the vici-  
tudes of party which marked the period.  
No novel construction, however ingenious  
ly devised, or however respectable and pa  
triotic its patrons, can withstand the weight  
of such authorities, or the unbroken current  
of so prolonged and universal a practice.  
And well it is that this cannot be done,  
without the intervention of the same an  
thority which made the Constitution. If it  
could be so done, there would be an end to  
that stability in Government and in laws  
which is essential to good government and  
good laws, a stability, the want of which is  
the imputation which has at all times been  
levelled against republicanism, with most  
effect, by its most dexterious adversaries.  
The imputation ought never therefore, to  
be countenanced by inovating construc  
tions without any plea of a precipitancy or  
a paucity of the constructive precedents  
they oppose, without any appeal to material  
facts newly brought to light; and without  
any claim to a better knowledge of the o­  
riginal evils and inconveniences, for which  
remedies were needed, the very best keys  
to the true object and meaning of all laws  
and constitutions.  
&quot;And may it not be fairly left to the un­  
biased judgment of all men of experience  
and of intelligence, to decide, which is  
most to be relied on for a sound and safe  
test of the meaning of a constitution, a uni  
form interpretation by all the successive  
authorities under it, commencing with its  
 birth, and continued for a long period, thro&#x27;  
the varied state of political contests; or the  
opinion of every new legislature, heated as  
it may be by the strife of parties--or warp.  
ed as oten haens b the eer ursit  
of some favorite object--or carried away,  
possibly, by the powerful eloquence or cap  
tivatin address ofa fow ponntar statesmen  
themselves, perhaps influenced by the same  
aisleading causes? If the lattor toet is to  
 prevall every now logiolattveoninion migh  
make a new constitution as the foot of

Mr. Madison, the father of the constitution, in a letter to Mr. Cabell, of  
Virginia, written in 1828, gives a “confident opinion” on the full power  
of congress to protect manufactures. He tells us that the phrase, “to re-

manufactures ; because that had been the use of the phrase among all  
nations, and particularly with “Great Britain, whose commercial vocabu.

to Joseph C. Cabell, Esq. He says “ of the im­  
practicability of separate regulations of trade, and  
the resulting necessity of general regulations, no  
Etatc was mure sensible than Virginia. She was  
accord is g|y among the most earnest for granting  
to Congress a power adequate to the object, tin  
more occasions than one, in the proceedings of  
her Legislative councils, it was recited ‘that the  
relative situation of the Elates had been found on  
triul to require uniformity in their commercial re­  
gulations, as the only effectual policy for obtain­  
ing, in the ports ol Foreign nations, a stipulation  
ol privileges, reciprocal to those enjoyed by the

cannot tail to arise among the several Slates from  
the interference of partial and separate regula­

to the public revenue as it ought to contribute.’ ”  
“During the delays and discouragements expe­  
rienced in the various attempts to invest Congress  
with the necessary powers, the State of Virginia ;  
made various trials of what could be done by her  
iudividud laws. She ventured on duties and nn­  
pusts as a source ol revenue: resolutions were  
passed at one lime to encourage and protect her  
own navigation and ship building; in conse­  
quence of complaints and petitions from Norfolk,  
Alexandria, and other places, against the mono­  
polizing navigation laws of Great Britain, parti­  
cularly in the liade between the United States!  
and the British YYesi Indies, she deliberated, with  
a purpose, controlled only by the inefficiency of.

M. sketches out the grounds of the confident opinion he  
had before expressed, that the power in Congress to im-  
pose a Tariff for the encouragement of manufactures, was  
among the powers vested in that body. &quot;If Congress have  
not the power, the says,) it is annihilated for the nation-  
a policy without example in any other nation, and not  
within the reason of the solitary one in our own. The  
example alluded to is the prohibition of a tux on exports,  
which resulted from the apparent impossibility of raising  
in that mode, a revenue from the States, proportioned to the  
ability to pay it;--the ability of some being derived in a  
great measure, not from their exports, but from their fishe­  
ries, from their freights, and from commerce at large, in  
some of its branches altogether external to the United  
States; the profits from all which, being invisible and intan­  
gible, would escape a tax on exports. A tax on imports,  
on the other hand, being a tax on consumption, which is  
in proportion to the ability of the consumers, whencesoever  
derived, was free from that inequality.&quot;  
Mr. Madison refers to a fact drawn trom the debates in  
the first session under the new Constitution, among which  
were many members of the Convention which had framed  
that instrument, and of the State Conventions which rati-  
fied it--and these also consisting of members who had  
opposed and who had espoused the Constitution in its actu.  
al form--namely, that the power was not denied ty  
any of them? And he brings to notice the further fact,  
that members from Firginig in purticulur, as well of the  
Anti Federal as of the Federal party, did not hesitate to  
propose duties, and to saggest even prohibitions in favor of  
several articles of her own production. By one, a duty was  
proposed on mineral coal, in favor of the Virginia pits; by  
another, on hemp; and by a third, a prohibition even of  
foreign beef, was suggested as a matter of sound polecy.

given to this power for forty years, by the General Govern.

the strife of parties; or warped, as often happens, by the  
eager pursuit of some favorite object. If the latter test is  
to prevail (says he) every new legislative opinion might  
make a new Constitution; as the foot of every new Chan­

No one can doubt but that llis power to regulate

to tax it. And the ijuesuon then resolves itself into  
this: whether the power to tax trade, which is involved

exercised by levying duties, ai:d imposing  
prohibitions and restrictions, with the object of encouraging

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
&quot; It is a simple question tinder the constitu­  
tion of the United States, whether &#x27;the power  
to regulnte trade with foreign nations,&#x27; as a dis  
liuci and substantive  
item in  
the enumerated  
: powers, embraces the object of encouraging, by  
duties, restrictions, and prohibitions, the manu­  
factures and products of the country ? And the  
affirmation must be inferred from the following  
considerations :  
1. The meaning of the nhrase &#x27;to rcpulate  
trade&#x27; must be sought in the general use of it;  
in other words, in the objects to which the pow-  
er was generally understood to be applicable  
when the phrase was inserted in the constitu­  
tion.&quot;2 The power has been understood and used  
by all commercial and manufacturing nations  
as embracing the object of encouraging manu­  
factures. It is believed thai not a single ex­  
cepiion can be named.  
&quot; 3. This had been particularly the case with  
Great Britain, whose commercial vocabulary  
is the parent ol ours. A primary object of her&#x27;  
commercial regulation is well known to have  
J cen the protection and encouragement of her  
t f .  
.-..w.. v.-.  
i j c t j . i . u .1  
I &quot;4. Snrh iinrtnrstnnrl in ho ilip nrnnr  
I11T1 11 11 I :i I&#x27;l II I f&#x27;k.  
- &quot; - f&#x27;&quot;l  
use of the power by the States most prepared  
for manufacturing industry whilst retaining the  
power over, their foreign trade.  
&quot;5 Such a use of power by Congress ac -  
cotds with the intention and expectation of the  
5 n cs in transferrin q power over trade from  
themselves to the government of the United  
Stales. This was emphatically the case in  
tne easiern, me more raanuiacturing, members  
  
or the confederacy. Here he cites the opin-J!orig  
ions of several distinguished men who aided in  
the formation of the constitution  
&quot;6. If Congress has not the power, it is anni -  
hiiatedfor the nation, a policy without example  
  
in any otner nation, ana not witnin tne reason  
of the solitary one in our own.  
The example  
alluded to is the prohibition of a tax on exports  
which resulted from the apparent impossibility  
of raising, in that mode, a revenue from the  
States proportioned to the ability to pay it the  
ability of some being derived, in a great meas-  
ure, not from their exports, but from their fish-  
eries, from their freights, and from their com-  
merce at large, in some of its branches alto-  
gether external to the United States; the profits  
from all of which, being invisible and intangible,  
would escape a tax on exports. A tax on im  
ports, on the other hand, being a tax on con  
sumption, which is in proportion to the ability  
of the consumers, whencesoever derived, was  
free from that inequality.  
&quot;7. If revenue be the sole object of a legit­  
imate impost, and the encouragement of domes­  
tic articles be not within the power to regulate  
trade, it would follow that no monopolizing or  
unequal regulations of foreign nations could be  
counteracted; that neither the staples of subsis­  
tence, nor the essential implements for the pub­  
lic safety, could, under any circumstances, be  
inured or fostered at homo by regulations of  
commerce, the usual and most convenient mode  
of providing for both; and that the American  
navigation, though the source of naval defence,  
of a cheapening competition in carrying our  
valuable, and bulky articles to market, and of an  
independent carriage of them durijig foreign  
wars, when a foreign navjgaiion might, be with  
drawn, must be at once abandoned or speedily  
destroyed; it being evident ahat a tonnage doty,  
in.foreign ports against our vessels,-andan-ex-emption  
of such a, duty in .our ports jjn, fa vor of  
  
foreign vessels, must have the inevitable effect

&quot; 8. That the encouragement of manufactures  
was an object to regulate trade, is proved by  
the use made of that power for thai object in  
the first session of the first Congress under the  
constitution, when among the members present  
were so many who had been members of the  
federal convention which framed the constitu­  
tion, and of the State conventions which rati­  
fied it; each of these classes consisting of mem­  
bers who had espoused the constitution in its  
actual form. It does not appear from the prin-  
j ted proceedings of Congress on that occasion  
I that. the power was denied by any of them.  
J And it may be remarked, that the members from  
I Virginia in particular, as well of the anti-feder-  
: al as the federal party, the names then distin  
guishing those who had opposed and those who  
approved the constitution, did not hesitate to  
propose duties, and to suggest even prohibitions  
in favor of several articles of her production.  
By one, a duty was proposed on mineral coal  
in favor of Virginia coal pits; by anoiher, a du­  
ty on hemp was proposed to encourage the  
growth of that article; and by a third, a prohibi­  
tion of even foreign beef was suggested as a  
measure of sound policy. See Lloyd&#x27;s De­

** That the encouragement of manufactures was an object  
of the power to regulate trade is proved by the use made ot  
the power for that object in the first session of the firat Con  
gress under the Constitution, when among the members  
present were so many who had been members of the Fed  
eral Convention which framed the Constitution, and of the  
State conventions which ratified it; each of these classes  
consisting also of members who had opposeé and who had  
espoused the Constitution in its actual form. It does not  
appear, from the printed proccedings of Congress on that  
occasion, that the power was denied by any of them; and it  
may be remarked that members from Virginiain particular,  
as weil of the Anti-Federal as the Federal party—the names  
then distinguishing those who had opposed aud those who  
had approved the Constitution—did not hesitate to propose  
duties, and to suggest even prohibitions in favor of several  
articles of her production. By one a duty was proposed on  
mineral coal, in favor of the Virginia coal pits; by another, a  
duty on hemp was proposed, to encourage the growth of that  
article ; and by a third, a prohibition even of foreign beef  
Was suggested as a measure of sound policy.”’  
  
**A turther evidence in support of the constitutional  
power to protect and foster manufactures by regulations of  
trade—an evidence that ought of itself to settle the question  
—is the uniform and practical sanction given to the power  
by the Federal Government, for nearly torty years, with a  
concurrence or acquiescence of every State government,  
throughout the same period; and it may be added, through  
all the vicissitudes of party which marked the period. No  
novel construction, however ingeniously devised, or how  
ever respectable and patriotic its patrons, can withstand the  
weight of such authorities or the unbroken current of so pro-  
longed and universal a practice.”’

That the encouragement of manufactures was  
an object of the power to regulate trade is  
proved by the use made of the power for  
that object in the first session of the first  
congress under the Constitution, when, among the  
were so many who had been  
members of the federal convention which framed  
the Constitution and of the state conventions  
which ratified it; each of these classes consisting  
also of members who had opposed and who had  
espoused the Constitution in its actual form. It  
does not appear from the printed proceedings of  
Congress on that occasion that the power was de  
nied by any of them. And it may be remarked  
that members from Virginia, in particular, as well  
of the anti-federal as the federal party, the names  
then distingnishing those who had opposed and  
  
those who had approved the Constitution, did not  
hesitate to propose duties and to suggest even pro­  
hibitions in favor of several articles of her pro­  
duction. By one a duty was proposed on mineral  
coal in favor of the Virginia coal pits; by another  
a duty on hemp was proposed to encourage the  
growth of that article; and by a third a prohibl­  
tion even of foreign beef was suggested as a meas  
ure of sound policy  
A further evidence in support of the constitu­  
tional power to protect and foster manufactures  
by regulations of trade, an evidence that ougt of  
itself to settle the question, is the uniform and  
practical sanction given to the power by the gen  
eral government for nearly forty years, with a  
concurrence or acquiesence of every state govern­  
ment throughout the same period; and, it may be  
added, through all the vicissitudes of party which  
marked the period. No novel construction, how  
ever ingeniously devised, or however respectable  
  
and patriotic its patrons, can withstand the weight  
of such authorities, or the unbroken current of so  
prolonged and universal a practice

t, from its first step to the final  
adoption of the Constitution. As Mr. Webster  
strongly said:&quot;If ever man had the means of un  
derstanding a written instrament, Mr. Malll  
the mieans of understanding the Constitution. I  
it be posstble to know what was designed by it

letter suffice to show how clearly he set forth,  
sixty vears ago, the distinction bet ween the  
power to tax and the power to &quot;regulate tra  
The Constitution vests in Congress, expre  
a the power to lay and coliect t  
imposts and excises,&quot; and  the power to regulate  
trade.  
Nor can it be inferred that a power to regulate  
trade does not involve a bower to tax it, Trom the  
istinction made in the original controversy with  
Great Britain between a power to regulate trade  
With the Colonies and a bower to tax them. A  
power to regulate frade between difterent parts of  
the Impire was confessedly necessary; and was  
asimitted to lie, as far as that was the case, in the  
Eritish parhament, the taxing part being at the  
sime time denied to the Parliament.  
It is a simple question, under the Constitution  
of the United States, whether &quot;the power to regu,­  
late trade with foreign nat ons,&quot; as a distinct and  
tubtantive item in the enumerated powers, em  
braces the object of encouraging y duties, restr  
tions and prohibitions the manufactures and pro­  
ducts of the country. And the affirmative must be  
interred frow the foliowing considerations:  
I. The meaning of the phrase &quot;to regulate  
trade&quot; must be sought in the general use of it; in  
other gords, in the objects to which the power was  
Senerally understond to be applicable when the  
phrase was inserted in the Constitution.  
2. The power has been understood and used by  
all commercial and manufacturing nations as em­  
bracing the object of encouraging manufactures.  
If is believed that not a single exception can be  
named.  
3. This has been particularly the case with Great  
Britain. whose commercial vocabulary is the  
parent of ours. A primary object of her commer­  
clal regulations is well known to have been the  
protection and encouragement of her mannfacture.  
Mr. Madison then urges that this &quot;was under-  
stood to be a proper use of the power&quot;; that its use  
aaccords with the intention and expectation of the  
States in transferring the power over trade from  
themselves to&quot; the United States; that if Congress  
have not the power, &quot;it is annihilated for the  
nation; a policy without example in any other  
nation&quot;; that in this event no &quot;monopolizing an

&quot;That the encouragement of manufac­

&quot;A further evidence in support of the  
constitutional power to protect and foster  
manufactures by regulations of trade, an  
evidence that ought of itself to settle the
