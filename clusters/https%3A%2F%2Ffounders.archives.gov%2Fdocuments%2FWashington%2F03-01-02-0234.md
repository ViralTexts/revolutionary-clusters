Camp at Cambridge Augt 20th 1775.  
  
Your Letter by Captn Prince came to my hands last Night—I was glad to learn by it that all are well. the acct given of the behaviour of the Scotchmen at Port Tobacco &amp; Piscataway surprizd &amp; vexed me—Why did they Imbark in the cause? what do they say for themselves? What does other say of them? are they admitted into Company? or kicked out of it? what does their Countrymen urge in justification of them? they are fertile in invention, and will offer excuses where excuses can be made.  
  
I cannot say but I am curious to learn the reasons why men, who had subscribed, &amp; bound themselves to each other, &amp; their Country, to stand forth in defence of it, should lay down their arms the first moment they were called upon.  
Although I never hear of the Mill under the direction of Simpson, without a degree of warmth &amp; vexation at his extreame stupidity, yet, if you can spare money from other Purposes, I could wish to have it sent to him, that it may, if possible, be set agoing before the Works get ruined &amp; spoilt, &amp; my whole money perhaps totally lost. If I am really to loose Barraud’s debt to me, it will be a pretty severe stroke upon the back of Adams, &amp; the expence I am led into by that confounded fellow Simpson, and necessarily so in Seating my Lands under the Management of Cleveland.  
Spinning should go forward with all possible dispatch, as we shall have nothing else to depend upon if these disputes continue another year—I can hardly think that Lord Dunmore can act so low, &amp; unmanly a part, as to think of siezing Mrs Washington by way of revenge upon me; howevr as I suppose she is, before this time gone over to Mr Calverts, &amp; will soon after retug, go down to New Kent, she will be out of his reach for 2 or 3 Months to come, in which time matters may, &amp; probably will, take such a turn as to render her removal either absolutely necessary, or quite useless—I am nevertheless exceedingly thankful to the Gentlemen of Alexandria for their friendly attention to this point &amp; desire you will if there is any sort of reason to suspect a thing of this kind provide a Kitchen for her in Alexandria, or some other place of safety elsewhere for her and my Papers.  
The People of this Government have obtained a Character which they by no means deserved—their Officers generally speaking are the most indifferent kind of People I ever saw. I have already broke one Colo. and five Captain’s for Cowardice, &amp; for drawing more Pay &amp; Provision’s than they had Men in their Companies. there is two more Colos. now under arrest, &amp; to be tried for the same Offences—in short they are by no means such Troops, in any respect, as you are led to believe of them from the Accts which are published, but I need not make myself Enemies among them, by this declaration, although it is consistent with truth. I daresay the Men would fight very well  
  
(if properly Officered) although they are an exceeding dirty &amp; nasty people. had they been properly conducted at Bunkers Hill (on the 17th of June) or those that were there properly supported, the Regulars would have met with a shameful defeat; &amp; a much more considerable loss than they did, which is now known to be exactly 1057 Killed &amp; Wounded—it was for their behaviour on that occasion that the above Officers were broke, for I never spared one that was accused of Cowardice but brot ’em to immediate Tryal.  
Our Lines of Defence are now compleated, as near so at least as can be—we now wish them to come out, as soon as they please, but they (that is the Enemy) discover no Inclination to quit their own Works of Defence; &amp; as it is almost impossible for us to get to them, we do nothing but watch each other’s motion’s all day at the distance of about a Mile; every now and then picking of a stragler when we can catch them without their Intrenchments; in return, they often Attempt to Cannonade our Lines to no other purpose than the waste of a considerable quantity of Powder to themselves which we should be very glad to get.  
What does Doctr Craik say to the behaviour of his Countrymen, &amp; Townspeople? remember me kindly to him, &amp; tell him that I should be very glad to see him here if there was any thing worth his acceptance; but the Massachusets People suffer nothing to go by them that they can lay hands upon.  
I wish the money could be had from Hill, &amp; the Bills of Exchange (except Colo. Fairfax’s, which ought to be sent to him immediately) turnd into Cash; you might then, I should think, be able to furnish Simpson with about £300; but you are to recollect that I have got Cleveland &amp; the hired People with him to pay also. I would not have you buy a single bushel of Wheat till you can see with some kind of certainty what Market the Flour is to go to—&amp; if you cannot find sufficient Imployment in repairing the Mill works, &amp; other things of this kind for Mr Roberts and Thomas Alferd, they must be closely Imployed in making Cask, or working at the Carpenters or other business otherwise they must be discharged, for it is not reasonable, as all Mill business will probably be at an end for a while, that I am to pay them £100 a year to be Idle. I should think Roberts himself must see, &amp; be sensible of the reasonableness of this request,  
  
as I believe few Millers will find Imploymt if our Ports are shut up, &amp; the Wheat kept in the Straw, or otherwise for greater Security.  
I will write to Mr Milnor to forward you a good Country Boulting Cloth for Simpson which endeavour to have contrived to him by the first safe conveyance. I wish you would quicken Lanphire &amp; Sears about the Dining Room Chimney Piece (to be executed as mentioned in one of my last Letters) as I could wish to have that end of the House compleatly finished before I return. I wish you had done the end of the New Kitchen next the Garden as also the old Kitchen with rusticated Boards; however, as it is not, I would have the Corners done so in the manner of our New Church. (those two especially which Fronts the Quarter.[)] What have you done with the Well? is that walled up? have you any accts of the Painter? how does he behave at Fredericksburg?  
I much approve of your Sowing Wheat in clean ground, although you should be late in doing it, &amp; if for no other purpose than a tryal—It is a growing I find, as well as a new practice, that of overseers keeping Horses, &amp; for what purpose, unless it be to make fat Horses at my expence, I know not, as it is no saving of my own Horses—I do not like the custom, &amp; wish you would break it—but do as you will, as I cannot pretend to interfere at this distance.

brot ’em to immediate tryal.  
  
Our lines of defence are now completed as near, or at least, as can  
be. We now wish them to come out, as soon as they please, but they  
(that is the enemy) discover no inclination to quit their own works of

of a considerable quantity of powder to themselves, which we would

What does Doctor Craik say to the behaviour of his countrymen,  
and townspeople? Remember me kindly to him, and tell him that I  
should be very glad to see him here, if there was anything worth his  
acceptance, but the Massachusetts people suffer nothing to go by  
them that they can lay hands upon. °  
  
I wish the money could be had from Hill, and the bills of exchange,  
(except Col. Fairfax’s, which ought to be sent to him immediately),  
turned into cash ; you might then, I should think, be able to furnish  
Simpson with about £300, but you are to recollect that I have got  
Cleveland, and the hired people with him, to pay also. I would not  
have you buy a single bushel of wheat till you can see with some kind  
of certainty what market the flour is to go to, and if you can not find  
sufficient employment in repairing the mill works, and other things  
of this kind, for Mr. Roberts and Thomas Alford, they must be  
closely employed in making casks, or working at the carpenter or  
other business, or, otherwise, they must be discharged, for it is not  
reasonable, as all mill business will, probably, be at an end for a  
while, that I am to pay them £100 a year to be idle. I should think  
Roberts himself must see, and be sensible of the reasonableness of  
this request, as I believe few millers will find employment if our ports  
are shut up, and the wheat kept in the straw, or otherwise for greater  
security.  
  
I will write to Mr. Milnor to forward you a good country boulting  
cloth for Simpson, which endeavor to have conveyed to him by the  
first safe conveyance. I wish you would quicken Lanphire and Sears  
about the dining room chimneypiece, (to be executed as mentioned in  
one of my last letters), as I could wish to have that end of the house  
completely finished before I return. I wish you had done the end of  
the new kitchen, next to the garden, as also the old kitchen, with  
rusticated boards ; however, as it is not, I would have the corners  
done so, in the manner of our new church, those two especially which  
fronts the quarter. What have you done with the well? Is that  
walled up? Have you any accounts of the painter? How does he  
behave at Fredericksburg?  
  
I much approve of your sowing wheat in clear ground, although  
you should be late in doing it, and if for no other purpose than a

I do not like the custom, and wish you would break it— but do as you

CAMe AR CAMnuIDOE Augt 29th 1775.  
Dear Lund, Your letter by Captn Crince  
came to my hands last night--I was glid to  
learn by it that all are well,-the acct given  
of the behavior of the Scotchmen at Port  
Tobacco &amp; Piscataway surprized and vexed  
me-why did they Imbark in the cause?  
what do they say for themselves?-what does  
others say of them?--are they admitted into  
company?--or kicked out of i?--what does  
their countrymen urge in justification of  
them?-they are fertile in invention, and  
will offer exctises where excuse can be  
made. I can not say but I am curious to  
learn the reasous why men, who has sub-­  
scribed &amp; bound themselves to each other. &amp;  
their country, to stand forth in defence of it,  
should lay down their arms the first moment  
they were called upon.  
Although I never hear of the mill, under  
 the direction of Simpson, without a de-­  
gree of warmth &amp; vexation at his extreme  
stupidity, yet, if you can spare money from  
other Purposes, I could wish to have it sent  
to him, that it may, if possible, be set a going  
before the works get ruined &amp; spoilt, and  
my whole money perhaps totally lost.If I  
am ready to lose Barran&#x27;s debt to me, it wil  
be a preity severe stroke upon the back of  
Adams, a the expence I am led into by that  
confounded fellow Simpson, and necessarily  
so in putting my Lands under the manage.­  
ment of Cleveland  
Spinning should go forward with all pos.­  
sible dispatch, as we shall bave nothing  
ebse to depend upon if these disputes cone­  
tthue another year--I can hardly think that  
Lord Dunmore can act so low, A une­  
manly a part, as to think of seizing Mrs.  
Washington by way of revenge upon me;  
ho wever as I suppose she is, betore this  
time gone over to Mr. Calverts, &amp; will soon  
after return&#x27;g, go down to New Kent, she  
will be out of his reach for 2 or 3 months to  
come, in which time matters may, &amp; proba-­  
bly will, take such a turn as to render her  
removal either absolutely necessary er quite  
useless--I am nevertheless exceedingly  
thankful to the Gentlemen of Alexandria for  
their friendly attention to this point a de-  
sire you will if there is any sort of reason  
to suspect a thing of this kind provide a  
  
kitchen for her in Alexandria, or some other  
place of safety elsewhere for her and my  
Papers-  
The people of this Government have ob­  
tained a character which they by no means  
deserved their officers generally speaking  
are the most indifferent kind of people I  
ever saw.-I have already broke one col, and  
five captains for cowardice, a for drawing  
more Fay E Provisions than they had men  
in their companies,--there is two more cols  
now under arrest, and to be tried for the  
same offences, In short they are by no  
means such Troops, in any respect, as you  
are led to believe of them from the accts  
which are published, but I need not  
make myself Enemies among them, by this  
declaration, although it is consistent with  
truth.I dare say the men would fight very  
well tif properly officeredy although they are  
an exceedingly dirty a nasty people-had  
they been properly conducted at Bunkers  
Hfill (on the 17th of June) or those that wore  
there properly supported, the Regulars  
would bave niet with a shameful defeat, a  
much more considerable loss than they did,  
which is now kaown to be exactly 1057.  
Killed &amp; Wounded.--it was for their beha-­  
vior on that cccasion that the above officers  
were broke, for I never spared one that was  
accused of cowardice but brot &#x27;em to imme-­  
diate tryal.  
Our Lines of Defence are now completed,  
as near so at least as can be--we now wish  
them to come out; as soon as they please,  
but they (that is the enemy) discover no In­  
clination to quit their own Works of De­  
fense, &amp; as it is almost impossible for us to  
get to them, we do nothing but watch each  
e did nototers moton al dy at the ditance of  
at pressure, about a mile; every now and then picking  
up a straggler where we can catch them  
without their Intrenchments; in return they  
often attempt to Cannonade our Lines to no  
other purpose than the waste of a consider­  
able quantity of Powder to themselves which  
we should be very glad to ge&#x27;.  
What does Doctr Cralk say to the beha­  
vior of his Countrymen, and Townspeo-­  
ple?-remember me kindly to him a  
tell him that I should be very glad to see  
him here if there was anything worth his  
acceptance; but the Massachusetts people  
suffer nothing to go by them that they can  
lay hands upon  
I wish the money could be had from Iill  
a the Bills of Exchange fexcep: Col. Fair­  
fax&#x27;s which ought to be sent to him imme,­  
diately) turned into cash; you might then, I  
should think, be able to furnish Simpson with  
about $300, but you are to recollect that I  
have got Cleveland a the hired People with  
him to pay also. I would not have  
you buy a single bushel of wheat till you can  
see with some kind of certainty what Market  
the Flour is to go to- &amp; if you cannot find  
sufficient Imployment in repairing the mill  
works, &amp; other things of this kind for Mr.  
Roberts and Thomas Alford, they must be  
closely Imployed in Making Cask or work­  
ing at the Carpenters or other business othe­  
erwise they must be discharged, for it is not  
reasonable, as all mill business will probably  
be at an end for awhile, that I am to pay  
them $100 a year to be Idis, I should think  
itoberts himself must see, &amp; be sensible of  
athe reasonatl ness of this reest as I be­  
a wilieve few Millers will find employment if our  
Ports are shut up, &amp; the whelt kept in the  
Straw, or otherwise for greater security,  
I will write to Mr. Milnor to forward you  
a good Country Bouiting Cloth for simpson  
which endeavor to have contrived to him by  
the brst sale conveyance. I wish you would  
quicken Lapshire &amp; Sears about the Dining  
Room Chimney piece (to be execuled as  
mentioned in one of my last letters) as I  
could wish to bave that end of the House  
look a man incompletely finished before f return.I wish  
you had done the end of the new Kitchen

(’ami- at Cambridge Augt 20th 1775.   
Dear Lump, Your letter by Captn  
Prince came tn my hands last, night— I  
was glad to learn by it that all are well.   
the acct given of the behavior of the  
Scotchmen at Port Tobacco A I’iscatawa  
surprized vexed me —why did they Jin­  
bark in the cause?—what do they say for  
themselves?—what does others say of  
them?—are they admitted into company?   
—or are they kicked out of it?—what  
does their countrymen urge in justifica­  
tion of them?—they arc fertile in inven­  
tion, and will offer excuses where excuse  
can be made.—l can not say but 1 am  
curious to learn the reasons why men,  
who has subscribed and is und themselves  
to each other &amp; their country, to stand  
forth in defence of it, should lay down  
their arms the first moment they were  
called upon.   
Although I never hear of the mill, un­  
der the direction of Simson, without n  
degree of warmth and vexation at his ex­  
treme stupidity, yet, if you could spare  
money from other Purposes, I could wish  
to have it sent to him, that it may, if pos  
siblc, be set a going la-fore the works get  
ruined &amp; spoilt, and my whole money  
perhaps totally lost.— If lam ready to  
lose Bai rail&#x27;s debt to me, it will be a pret­  
ty severe stroke upon the Lack of Adams  
&amp; the expense I am led into by that con­  
founded fellow Simson, and necessarily so  
in putting my Lands under the manage­  
ment of Cleveland.—   
  
Spinning should go forward with all  
possible dispatch, as we shall have noth­  
ingelse to depend upon if these disputes  
continue another year—l can hardly  
think that Ixird Dunmore could act so  
low, nnd unmanly a part, as to think of  
seizing Mrs. Washington by way of  
revenge upon me; however as I suppose  
she is. lad&#x27;ore tins time gone over to Mr.  
(&#x27;al vert&#x27;s and will soon after returning, go  
down to New Kent, she will lx- out of his  
reach for two vr three months to conic,  
in which time matters may, and prob­  
ably will, take such a turn as to render  
her removal either absolutely neccasarv  
or quite useless—l am nevertheless ex­  
ceedingly thankful to the gentlemen of  
Alexandria for their friendly attention to  
this point and desire, you will if there is  
any sort of reason to suspect any thii gos  
this kind provide a kitchen for her in  
Alexandria, or some other place of safety  
elsewhere for her nnd Papers   
The people of this Government have  
obtained a character which they by no  
means deserved—their officers general!)  
speaking arc the most indiflerent kind of  
people I ever saw.— I have already broke  
one col. and five captains for cowardice,  
&amp; for drawing more Pay ,t Provisions  
than they had men in their companies,  
there is two more cols now under arrest,  
nnd to Ire tried for the same offences-- in  
short they are by no means such Troop-,  
in any respect, as you are led to belli ve  
of them from the accts which are pub­  
lished. but I need not make myself ene­  
mies among them by this declaration, al­  
though it is consistent with truth.—l dare  
say the men would fight very well (if  
propel ly officered) although they are an  
exceedingly nasty A dirty people—had   
  
they been properly conducted at Bunk­  
er s Hill (on the 17th of June) or those  
that were there properly supported, the  
Regulars would have met with a shame­  
ful defeat A much more considerable loss  
than they did, which is now known to be  
exactly 1057. Killed A Wounded.—it  
was for their behavior on that occasion  
that the above officers were broke, for 1  
never spared one that was accused of  
cowardice but brot’em to immediate

but watch each other&#x27;s motions all day  
the distance of about a mile; every now

CAMP AT CAMERIDGE!  
August 20th, 1775. I  
Dear Lund, Your letter by Capt.  
Crince came to my hands last night  
I was glad to learn by it that all are  
well--the acct given of the behaivor of  
the Scotchmen at Port Tobacco  Pis-  
cataway surprised and vexed me--why  
did they Imbark in the cause?--what  
do they say for themselves?--what  
does others say of them?--are they ad­  
mitted into company?--or kicked out  
of it?--what does their countrymen  
urge in justification of them?-they  
are fertile in invention, and will offer  
excuses where excuse can be made.  
I chnnot sy but I am curious  
to learn the reasons whly men, who  
has subscribed &amp; themselves to each  
other e their country, to stand forth  
in defence of it, should lay down their  
arms the first moment they were call  
ed upon.  
Although I fiever hear of the mill,  
under the direction of Simpson, with  
out a degree of warmth e vexation at  
his extreme stupidity, yet, if you can  
spare money from Purposes I could  
wish to have it sent to him, that it  
may, if possible, be set a going before  
the works get ruined &amp; spoilt, and my  
whole money perliaps totally lost. If  
I am ready to lose Barran&#x27;s debt to me,  
it will be a pretty severe stroke upon  
the back of Adams,  and the expense  
I am led into by that confounded fel­  
low Simpson, and necessarily so in  
putting my Lands under the manage­  
ment of Cleveland­  
Spinuing should go forward with all  
possible dispatch, as we shall have  
nothing else to depend upon if these  
disputes continue another year, I can  
hardly think that Lord Dunmore can  
act so low, and unmanly a part, as to  
think of seizing Mrs. Washington by  
way of revenge upon me; however as  
I suppose she is, before this time gone  
ovef to Mf. Calverts, &amp; will soon after  
return&#x27;g, go down to New Kent; she  
will be out of his reach for 2 or a  
months to come, in which time mat­  
ters may, &amp; probably will, take such  
a turn as to render her remowal either  
absolutely necessary or quite useless  
I am nevertheless exceedingly thank­  
ful to the Gentleman of Alexandria  
fof theif friendly attention to this  
point a desire you will if ther is any  
sort of reason to suspect a thing of this  
  
BR1870L, ViRGINlA  
  
  
kind to provide a kitchen for her in  
Alexandria, or some other place of  
salety elsewhere for her and my Pa  
pers  
The people of this Government have  
obtained a charter which they by no  
means deserved--their officers gene­  
rally speaking are the most indifferent  
kind of people I ever saw. I have al­  
ready broke one col, and and five cap­  
tains for cowardice,  for drawing  
more pay a provisions than they had  
men in their companies,- there is two  
more cols, now under arrest, and to be  
tried for the same offence. -In short  
they are by no means such Troops, in  
any respect, as you are led to believe of  
them from the accts which are pub­  
lished, but I need not make myself  
Enemies among them, by this declara­  
tion, although it is consistent with  
truth.-I dare say the men would fight  
very well (if properly officered) al­  
though they are an exceedingly dirty  
a nasty people--had they been prop­  
erly conducted at Bunkers Hill ton  
the 17th of June) or those that were  
there properly supported, the Regu­  
lars would have met with à shameful  
defeat, &amp; much more considerable loss  
than they did, which is now known to  
be exactly 1,057. Killed &amp; Wounded.  
it was for their behavior on that oc­  
casion that the above officers were  
broke, for I never spared one that was  
accused of cowardice but brot &#x27;em to  
immediate tryal.  
Our Lines of Defence are now com­  
pleted, as near so at least as can be  
we now wish them to come out; as  
soon as they please, but they (that is  
the enemy) discover no Inclination to  
quit their own Works of Defense, ­  
as it is almost impossible for us to get  
to them, we do nothing but watch  
each other&#x27;s motions all day at a dis­  
tance of about a mile; every now and  
then picking up a straggler where we  
can catch them without their Intrench­  
ments; in return they often attempt  
to Cannonade our Lines to no other  
purpose than the waste of a considera­  
ble quantity of Powder to themselves  
which we should be very glad to get.  
What does Doctor Cralk say to the  
behavior of his Countrymen and  
Townspeople?--remember me kindly  
to him d tell him that I should be very  
glad to see him here if there was any­  
thing worth his acceptance; but the  
Massachusetts people suffer nothing to  
go by them that they can lay hands  
upon  
I wish the money could be had from  
Hill a the Bills of Echange (except  
Cola Fairfax&#x27;s which ought to be sent  
to him immediately) turned into cash;  
you might then, I should think, be  
able to furnish Simpson with about  
$300, but you are to recollect that I  
have got Cleveland a the hired People  
with him to pay also. I would not  
have you buy a single bushel of wheat  
till you can see with some kind of cer­  
trinty what Market the Flour is to go  
to--and if you Cannot find sufficient  
employment in repairing the mill  
works, &amp; other things of this kind for  
Mr Robert and Thomas Alford, they  
must be closely Imployed in Making  
Cask or working at the Carpenters or  
other business otherwise they must be  
discharged, for it is not reasonable, as  
all mill business will probably be at an  
end for awhile, that I am able to pay  
them $100 a year to be Idle.-I shouild  
think Roberts himself must see, f be  
sensible of the reasonableness of this  
request, as I believe few millers will  
find employment if our Ports are shut  
up, &amp; the wheat kept in the straw; Or  
otherwise for greater security  
I will write to Mr. Minor to forward  
you a good Country Boulting Cloth for  
Simpson, which endeavor to have con  
trived to him by him by the first safe  
conveyance- I wish you would quick  
en Lapshire I Sears about the Bining  
RGom Chimney plece, to be executed  
as tuentiblied in one of my last letters,  
as I could wish to have that end of the  
House completely finished before I re-  
turn. I with cos had doue the end of  
the new Kitchen fiext the Garden as  
also the old Kitchen with with rusti-

What liave yod done with the well?  
Is that walled up?--have you any ace&#x27;t  
of the Painter? how does he behave

I much approve of your sowing  
Wheat in clear ground, although you  
should be late in doing it,  if for  
no other purpose than a tryal- It is a

make fat Horses at my expense, I know  
not, as it is ito saving to my own Hor­

Camp at Cambridge Aug 20 1775.  
Dear Lund  
  
Your letter by Captain Prince came to my hands last night. I was glad to  
learn by it that all are well. The acc’t given of the Scotchmen at Fort Tobacco  
and Piscataway surprised and vexed me. Why did they Imbark in the cause?  
What do they say for themselves? What do others say of them? Are they ad-  
mitted into company? Or kicked out of it? What do their countrymen urge in  
justification of them? They are fertile in inventing and will offer excuses where  
excuses can be made. I cannot say but I am curious to learn the reasons why men  
who have subscribed or bound themselves to each other and their country, to stand  
forth in defence of it, should lay down their arms the first moment they were called  
upon.  
  
Although I never hear of the mill under the direction of Simpson without a  
degree of warmth and vexation at his extreme stupidity, yet if you can spare money  
from other purposes, I could wish to have it sent to him, that it may, if possible, be  
set a going before the works get ruined and spoilt, and my whole money perhaps  
totally lost. If I am really to lose Barnam’s debt to me it will be a pretty severe  
stroke upon the back of Adams, and the Expense I am led into by that confounded  
fellow Simpson, and necessarily so in starting my lands under the management of  
Cleveland.  
  
Spinning should go forward with all possible despatch, as we shall have nothing  
else to depend upon if these disputes continue another year. [I can hardly think  
that Lord Dunmore can act so base and unmanly a part as to think of seizing Mrs  
Washington by way of revenge upon me ; however, as I suppose she is before this  
time gone over to Mr Calvert’s, and will soon after returning go to New Kent, she  
will be out of his reach for 2 or 3 months to come, in which time matters may and  
probably will take such a turn as to render her removal either absolutely necessary,  
or quite useless. I am nevertheless exceedingly thankful to the gentlemen of  
Alexandria for their friendly attention to this point, and desire you will, if there is  
any sort of reason to suspect a thing of this kind, provide a kitchen for her in  
Alexandria, or some other place of safety elsewhere for her and my papers.

The people of this government have obtained a character which they by no  
means déserved. ‘Their officers generally speaking are the most indifferent kind of  
people I ever saw. I have already broke one colonel and five captains for coward-  
ice, and for drawing more pay and provisions than they had men in their com-  
panies. There are two more colonels now under arrest, and to be tried for the  
same offences—in short they are by no means such troops, in any respect, as you  
are led to believe of them from the accounts which are published, but I need not  
make myself enemies among them, by this declaration, although it is consistent  
with truth. I dare say the men would fight very well (if properly officered) al-  
though they are an exceedingly dirty and nasty people. Had they been properly

considerable loss than they did, which is now known to be exactly 1057, killed and  
wounded—it was for their behaviour on that occasion that the above officers were  
broke, for I never spared one that was accused of cowardice, but brought them to  
immediate tryal.  
  
Our lines of defence are now compleate, as near so at least ascan be. We now  
wish them to come out, as soon as they please, but they (that is the enemy) dis-  
cover no inclination to quit their own works of defence, and as it is almost impossi-  
ble for us to get to them, we do‘nothing but watch each others motions all day at  
the distance of about a mile, every now and then picking off a stragler when we  
can catch them without their intrenchments ; in return they often attempt to  
cannonade our lines, to no other purpose than the waste of a considerable quantity  
of Powder to themselves, which we should be very glad to get.  
  
What does Dr Craik say to the behaviour of his countrymen and towns people ?  
Remember me kindly to him and tell him that I should be very glad to see him  
here if there was anything worth his acceptance, but the Massachusetts people  
suffer nothing to go by them that they can lay hands upon.  
  
I wish the money could be had from Hill and the bills of exchange (except Col  
Fairfax’s, which ought to be sent to him immediately) turned into cash ; you might  
then, I should think, be able to furnish Simpson with about £300 ; but youare to re-  
collect that I have got Cleveland and the hired people with him to pay also. I would  
not have you buy a single bushel of wheat till you can see with some kind of cer-  
tainty what market the flour is to go to, and if you cannot find sufficient Imploym’t  
in repairing the mill works and other things of this kind for Mr Roberts and Thomas  
Holferd, they must be closely imployed in making casks or working at the carpenters  
or other business, or otherwise they must be discharged, for it is not reasonable, as  
all mill business will probably be at an end for awhile, that I am to pay them £100  
a year to be idle. I should think Roberts himself must see, or be sensible of the  
reasonableness of this request, as I believe few millwrights find Imploym’t, if  
our ports are shut up, and the wheat kept in the straw, or otherwise for greater  
security.

Washington “broke one colonel and five captains for  
cowardice,’ and he came to the conclusion that the  
British could have been, and ought to have been,  
finally repulsed on that bloody day.

supported, the regulars would have met with shame-  
ful defeat, and a much more considerable loss than  
they did.”
