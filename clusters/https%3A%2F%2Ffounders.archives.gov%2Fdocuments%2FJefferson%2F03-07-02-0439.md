Dear Sir  Monticello Aug. 25. 14.  
Your favor of July 31. was duly recieved, and was read with peculiar pleasure. the sentiments breathed thro’ the whole do honor to both the head and heart of the writer. mine on the subject of the slavery of negroes have long since been in possession of the public, and time has only served to give them stronger root. the love of justice &amp; the love of country plead equally the cause of these people, and it is a mortal reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so long in vain, and should have produced not a single effort, nay I fear not much serious willingness to relieve them &amp; ourselves from our present condition of moral and political reprobation. from those of the former generation who were in the fulness of age when I came into public life, which was while our controversy with England was on paper only, I soon saw that nothing was to be hoped. nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded condition, both bodily &amp; mental, of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting that that  
			 degradation was very much the work of themselves &amp; their fathers, few minds had yet doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects of property as their horses or cattle. the quiet &amp;  
			 monotonous life course of colonial life had been disturbed by no alarm, &amp; little reflection on the value of liberty. and when alarm was taken at an enterprise on their own, it was not easy to carry them  
			 the whole length of the principles which they invoked for themselves. in the first or second session  
			 of the legislature after I became a member, I drew to this subject the attention of Colo Bland, one of the oldest, ablest, and most respected members, and he undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the protection of the laws to these people. I seconded his motion, and, as a younger member, was more spared in the debate: but he was denounced as an enemy to his country, &amp; was treated with the grossest indecorum.  
			 from an early  
			 stage of our revolution other and more distant duties were assigned to me, so that from that time till my return from Europe in 1789. and I may say till I returned to reside at home in 1809. I had little opportunity of knowing the progress of public sentiment here on this subject. I had always hoped that the  
			 younger generation, recieving their early impressions after the flame of liberty had been kindled in every breast, and had become as it were the vital spirit of every American, that the generous  
			 temperament of youth, analogous to the motion of their blood, and above the suggestions of avarice, would have sympathised with oppression wherever found, and proved their love of liberty beyond  
			 their own share of it. but my intercourse with them, since my return, has not been sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards this point the progress I had hoped.  
			 your solitary but  
			 welcome  
			 voice is the first which has brought this sound to my ear; and I have considered the general silence which prevails on this subject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to every hope. yet the hour  
			 of  
			 emancipation is advancing in the march of time. it will come; and whether brought on by the generous energy of our own minds, or by the bloody process of St Domingo, excited and conducted by the power of our present enemy, if once stationed permanently within our own country, &amp; offering asylum &amp; arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned over.  
As to the method by which this difficult work is to be effected, if permitted to be done by ourselves, I have seen no proposition so expedient on the whole, as that of emancipation of those born after a given day, and of their education and expatriation at a proper age. this would give time for a gradual extinction of that species of labor and substitution of another, and lessen the severity of the shock which an operation so fundamental cannot fail to produce. the idea of emancipating the whole at once, the old as well as the young, and retaining them here, is of those only who have not the guide of either knolege or experience of the subject. for, men, probably of any colour, but of this color we know, brought up from their infancy without necessity for thought or forecast, are by their habits rendered as incapable as children of taking care of themselves, and are extinguished promptly wherever industry is necessary for raising the young. in the mean time they are pests in society by their idleness, and the depredations to which this leads them. their amalgamation with the other colour produces a degradation to which no lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the human character can innocently consent.  
I am sensible of the partialities with which you have looked towards me as the person who should undertake this salutary but arduous work. but this, my dear Sir, is like bidding old Priam to buckle the armour of Hector ‘trementibus aevo humeris et inutile ferrum cingi.’ no. I have overlived the generation with which mutual labors and perils begat mutual confidence and influence. this enterprise is for the young; for those who can follow it up, and bear it through to it’s consummation. it shall have all my prayers, and these are the only weapons of an old man.but in the mean time are you right in abandoning this property, and your country with it? I think not. my opinion has ever been that, until more can be done for them, we should endeavor, with those whom fortune has thrown on our hands, to feed &amp; clothe them well, protect them from ill usage, require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by freemen, and be led by no repugnancies to abdicate them, and our duties to them. the laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their good: and to commute them for other property is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot controul. I hope then, my dear Sir, you will reconcile yourself to your country and it’s unfortunate condition; that you will not lessen it’s stock of sound disposition by withdrawing your portion from the mass. that, on the contrary you will come forward in the public councils, become the Missionary of this doctrine truly Christian, insinuate &amp; inculcate it softly but steadily thro’ the medium of writing &amp; conversation, associate others in your labors, and when the phalanx is formed, bring on &amp; press the proposition perseveringly until it’s accomplishment. it is an encoraging observation that no good measure was ever proposed which, if duly pursued, failed to prevail in the end. we have proof of this in the history of the endeavors in the British parliament to suppress that very trade which brought this evil on us. and we are you will be supported by the religious precept of ‘be not weary wearied in well doing.’ that your success may be as speedy and compleat, as it will be of honorable &amp; immortal consolation to yourself I shall as fervently &amp; sincerely pray as I assure you of my great friendship and respect.

Monticello, August 25, 1814,  
  
Dear Sin—Your favor of July 3ist,  
was duly received, and was read with pe-  
culiar pleasure. The sentiments breath-  
ed through the whole do honor to both  
the head and heart of the writer. Mine  
on the subject of the slavery of negroes  
have long since been in possession of the  
public, and time has only served to give  
them stronger root. The love of justice  
and the love of country plead equally  
the cause of these people, and it is a  
  
mortal reproach to us that they should|/y  
  
have pleaded it so long, in vain, and  
should have produced not a single effort,  
nay, | fear not much serious willingness  
to relieve them and ourselves from our  
present condition of moral and political  
reprobation. From those of the- former  
generation who were in the fulness of  
age when | came into public life, which  
was while our controversy with England  
was on paper only, I soon saw that no-  
thing was to be hoped. Nursed and edu-  
cated in the daily habit of seeing the  
degraded condition, both bodily and men-  
tal, of those unfortunate beings, but re-  
flecting that that degradation was very  
much the work of themselves and their  
fathers, few minds had yet doubted but  
that they were as legitimate subjects of  
property as their horses or cattle. The  
quiet and monotonous course of colo-  
nial life had been disturbed by no alarm,  
and little reflection on the value of hi-  
berty. And when alarm was taken at  
an enterprize of their own, it was not  
easy to carry them the whole length of  
the principles which they invoked for  
themselves. In the first or second ses-  
sion of the Legilature after 1 became a  
member, | drew to this subject the at-  
  
  
  
tention of Colonel Bland, one of the old-  
  
est, ablest, and most respected members,  
and he undertook to move for certain  
moderate extensions of the protection of  
the laws to these people. I seconded  
his motion, and, as a younger member,  
was no more spared in the debate: but  
he was denounced as an enemy to his  
country, and was treated with the great-  
est indecorum. From an early stage of  
our revolution other and more distant  
duties were assigned to me, so that from  
that time till my return from Europe in  
1789, and I may say till I returned to re-  
side at-home in 1809, I had little oppor-  
tunity of knowing the progress of public  
sentiment here on this subject. I had  
always hoped that the younger genera-

after the flame of liberty had been kin-

brought on by the generous energy of  
our own minds, or by the bloody process  
of St. Domingo, excited and conducted  
by the power of our present enemy, if  
once stationed permanently within our  
country, offering asylum and arms to the  
oppressed, is a leaf of our history aot yet

would give time for a gradual extinction  
of that species of labor and substitution  
of another, and lessen the severity of the  
shock which an operation so fundamen-  
tal cannot fail to produce. The idea of  
emancipating the whole at once, the old  
as well as the young, and retaining them  
here, is of those only who have not the  
guide of either knowledge or experience  
of the subject. For, men, probably of  
any colour, but of this colour we know,  
brought up from their infancy without  
necessity for thought or forecast, are by  
their habits rendered as incapable as  
children of taking care of themselves,  
and are extinguished promptly where-  
ever industry is necessary for raising the  
young. In the mean time they are pests  
in society by their idleness, and the de-  
predations to which this leads them,.—  
Their amalgamation with the other co  
lor produces a degradation to which ne  
lover of his country, no lover of excel-  
lence in the human character can inno-  
cently consent.  
  
1am sensible of the partialities with  
which you have looked towards me as  
the person who should undetake this sa-  
lutary but arduous work. But this, my  
  
dear sir, is like bidding old Priam tojj!y

tibus aevo humeris et inutile ferrum

This enterprise is for the young; for those  
who can follow it up, and hear it through  
to its consummation. It shall have all my  
prayers, apd these are the only weapons  
ofanold man. But in the mean time are  
§ you right in abandoning this property, and  
your country with it? I think not. My

will reconcile yourg@If to your country  
and its unfortunate condition; that you  
will not lessen its stock of sound dispo-  
sition by withdrawing your portion from  
the mass. That on the contrary you  
will come forward in the public coun-  
cils, become the missionary of this doc-  
trine truly christian, insinuate and in-  
culcate it softly but steadily through the  
medium of writing and conversation, as-  
sociate others in your labors, and when  
the phalanx is formed, bring on and press  
the proposition perseveringly until its  
accomplishment. It is an encouraging  
observation that no good measure was  
ever proposed which, if duly pursued,  
failed to prevail in the end.. We have  
proof of this in the history of the endea-  
vors in the British Parliament to sup-  
press that very trade which brought this  
evil on us. And you will be supported  
by the religious precept, ‘‘be not weary  
in well doing.”” ‘That your success may  
be as speedy aud complete, as it will be

Dear Sir—Your favor of July 31st,

bation. From those of the former genera-  
tion who we&#x27;re in the fullness of age when |  
came into public life, which was while our  
controversy with England was on paper on-  
lv, 1 soon saw that nothing was to be hop-  
ed. Narsed and educated in the daily ha-  
bit of seeing the degraded condition, both  
bodily and mental, of those unfortunate be-  
ings, but not reflecting that that degradation  
was very much the work of themselves and  
their fathers, few minds have yet doubted  
but that they were as legitimate subjects of  
property as their horses or cattle. The  
quiet and monotonous course of colonial  
life had been disturbed by no alarm, and  
litle reflection on the value of liberty. And  
  
their own, it was not easy to carry them to  
the whole length of the principles which  
they invoked fur themselves. In the first  
or second session of the legislature after I  
became a member, I drew to this subject  
the attention of Colonel Bland, one of the  
oldest, ablest, and most respected members,  
and he undertook to move for certain mode-  
rate extensions of the protection of the laws  
to these people.  
and, asa younger member, was more spar-  
ed in the debate : but he was denounced as  
an enemy to his countey, and was treated  
with the greatest indecorum. From an  
early stage of our revotation other and more  
distant duties were assigned to me, so that  
from that time till ary retarn from Europe  
in 1789, and I may say till | returned to re-  
side at homein 1809, I had little opportu-  
nity of knowing the progress of public senti  
  
ment here on this subject. 1 had always  
hoped that the younger generation, receiv-  
ing their early impressions after the flame  
of liberty had been kindled in every breast,  
and had become as it were the vital spirit  
ofevery American, the generous tempera-  
ment of youth, analagous to the motion of  
their blood, and above the suggestions of  
avarice, would have sympathised with op-  
pression wherever found, and proved their  
love of liberty beyond their own share of  
it. But my intercourse with them, siuce  
my return, bas not been sufficient to ascer-  
tain that they have made towards this poiut  
the progress I had hoped. Your solitary  
but welcome voice is the first which has  
brought this sound to my ear ; and | have  
considered the general silence which pre-  
vails on this subject as indicating an apathy  
unfavourable to every hope. Yet the hour  
of emancipation is advancing in the march  
of time.  
  
As to the method by which this difficult  
work is to be effected, if permitted to be  
done by ourselves, | have seen no proposi-  
tion so expedient.on the whole, as that of  
emancipation of those born after a given  
day, and of their education and expatriation  
ata proper age. This would give time for  
a gradual extinction of that species of la-  
bour and substitution of another, and lessen  
the severity of the shock which an opera-  
tion so fundamental cannot fail to produce.  
The idea of emancipating the whole at  
once, the old as well as the young, and re-  
taining them here, is of those only who have  
not the guide of either knowledge or expe-  
rience of the subject. For, men, probably  
of any colour, but of this colouw: we know,  
brought up from their infancy; without ne-  
cessity for thought or forecast, are by their  
habits rendered as incapatle as children of  
taking care of themselves, and are extin-  
guished promptly wherever industry is ne-  
cessary for raising the young. In the mean  
time they are pests in society by their idle-  
ness, andthe depredations to. which this  
leads them.—Their amalgamation with the  
other colour produces a degradatinn to  
which no lover of his country, no lover of  
excellence in the human character can in-  
nocently consent.  
  
| am sensible of the partialities. with  
which you have looked towards me as the  
person who should undertake this salutary  
but arduous work. But this my dear sir,  
is like bidding old Priam to buckle the ar-  
mour of Hector “‘ tremendibas aevo hume-  
ris et inutile ferrum eregi.” No, I have

and bear it through to its consummation. It  
  
shall have all my prayers, and these are  
the only weapons of an old man. But in  
the mean time ave you right in abandoning  
this property, and your country with it?  
1 think not. My opinien has ever been  
that, until more can be done for them, we  
shonly endeavour with those whom foriane  
has throwo on our hands, to feed and  
  
| clothe them well, protect them from ill  
  
usage, require such reasonable labour on-  
ly as is performed voluntarily by freemen,  
aud ve led by no repugnances to abdicate  
them, and our duties to them. The laws  
do not permit us to turn them loose, if that  
were for their good, and to commate them  
for other property is to commit them to  
those whose usage of them we cannot con-  
trol. I hope then, my dear sir, you will  
reconcile yourself to your country and its  
unfortunate condition ; that you will not  
lessen its stock of sound disposition by with-  
drawing your portion from the mass. That  
on the contrary you will come forward to  
the public councils, become the missionary  
of the doctrine truly Christian, insinu-  
ate and inculcate it softly but steadily  
through the mrdium of writing and conver-  
sation, associate others in your labours, and  
when the phalanx is formed, bring on and  
press the proposition perseveringly until its  
accomplishment. It is an encouraging ob-  
servation, that no good measure was ever  
proposed which, if duly pursued, failed to  
prevail in the end. We have proof ofthis in  
the history of the endeavours in the British  
Parliament to suppress that very trade  
which brought this evil on us. And you  
will be supported by the religious precept,  
‘* be not weary in well doing.” That your  
success may be as speedy and complete,  
as it will be honourable and immortal con-  
solation to yourself, I shall as fervently  
and sincerely pray as 1 assure you of my  
great friendship and respect.

honour to both the head and heart of the writer,  
Mive on the subject of the slavery of negroes have  
loug since been in possession of the public, and  
time has only served to give them stronger root.  
The love of justice and the love of country plead  
equally the cause of these people, and it is a moral  
reproach to ns that they should have pleaded it so  
long 1 vain, and should have produced not a sin-  
ole effort, nay, 1 fear not much serious willingness  
to relieve them and ourselves from our present  
eond:tion of moral and political reprobation.—  
Myom tose of the former generation who were iw  
he futiness of age when I came into public life,  
which was while our controversy with England  
was on paper only, | soon saw that nothing was to  
be hoped. Nursed and educated in the daily hab-  
iit of seeing the degraded condition, both bodily  
anitmentel, of those unfortunate beings, but not  
ref ctivg that that degradation was very much tie  
wo:k of themselves and their fathers, few minds  
have vet donbted bet that they were as legitimate  
  
j  
-  
t  
  
subjects of property as their horses or cattle. The  
quiet apd monotonous course of colonial life had  
been distuibed by no alarm, and little reflection on  
the vo ue of liberty. Aud when alarm was taken  
atan enterprize of thei own, It was not easy to  
  
arry them to the whole length of the principles  
which ibey invoked tor themselves. In the first  
or secoud session ot the legislature after I hecame  
a member, | drew to this subject the attention of  
Colonel Biaud, one of the oldest, ablest, aud mos:  
respected members, and he undertook to move fur  
certain moderate extensions of the protection of  
the laws to these people. I seconded his motion,  
and, as a younger member, was more spared in the  
debate: but he was denounced as an enemy to his  
country, and Was treated with the greatest indeco-  
rum. From an early stage of our revolution other  
and more distant duties were assigned to me, so  
that from that time till my return from Evrope in  
1789, and I may say till IT returned to reside at  
home in 1809, L had little opportunity of knowing  
the progress of public sentiment here on this sub-  
ject. IT had always hoped that the younger gene-  
ration, receiving their early impressions efter the  
flame of liberty had been kindled in every breast,  
and had become as it wee th: vital spirit of every  
  
American, the generous temperament of youth,  
analagous to the motion of their bloc’, and above  
the suggestions of avarice, would have sympathi-  
zed with oppression wherever found, and proved  
their love of liberty beyond their own share of it.  
But my intercourse with them, since my return, has  
not been sufficient to ascertain that they have made  
towards this point the progress [ had hoped.—  
Your solitary but welcome voice is the first which  
has brought this sound to my ear: and I have con-  
sidered the general silence whici: prevails on this  
subject as indicating an apathy unfavourable to ev-  
ery hope. Yet the hour of emancipation is advan-  
cing in the march of time.  
  
As tothe method by which this difficult work is  
to be effected, if permitted to be done by ourselves,  
I have seen no proposition so expedient on the  
Whole, as that of emancipation of those born after  
a given day, and of their education and expatria-  
tion ata proper age. This would give time for a  
gradual extinction of that species of labor and sub-  
stitution of another, and lesson the severity of the  
Shock which an operation so fundamental cannot  
failto produce. The idea of emancipating the

‘ Uo  
  
whole at once, the old as weil as the young, and  
retaining them here, 1s of those only who have not  
ihe guide of either knowledge or experience of the  
subject. For, men, probably of any colour, but of  
this colour we know, brought up from their infan-  
cy without necessity for thought or forecast, are by  
their habits rendered as incapable as children of  
taking care of themselves, and are extinguished  
promptly wherever industry is necessary for raising  
the young. In the ean time they are pestis in so-  
ciety by their idleness, aud the depredations to  
which this leads them. Their amaigamation with  
the other colour produces a degradation to which  
no lover of his country, no lover of excelieuce im  
the human character can innocently consent.  
  
I am sensible ofthe partialities with which you  
have looked towards me as the person who should  
undertake this salutary but arduous work. But  
iuis my dear sir, Is like bidding old Priam to buck-  
le the armour of Hector “ wemenudibas aevo hume-

culiar pleasure. The sentiments breath-  
ed through the whole, do honor to both  
the head and heart of the writer. Mine  
on the subject of the slavery of negroes  
have long since been in possession of the  
public, and time has ofly served to give  
them stronger root. The love of justice  
and the love of country plead equally  
the cause of this people, and it is a mor-  
tal reproach to us that they should have  
pleaded it so long, in vain, and should  
have produced nota single effort, nay,  
I fear not much serious willingness to  
relieve them and ourselves from our  
present condition of moral and political  
reprobation. From those of the former  
generation who were in the fulness of  
age when {| came into public life, which  
was While our controversy with England  
was On paper only, | soon saw that no-  
thing was to be hoped. Nursed and edu-  
cated in the daily habit of seeing the  
degraded condition, both bodily and men-  
tal, of those unfortunate beings, but re+  
flecting that that degradation was very  
much the work of themselves and their  
fathers, few minds had yet doubted but  
that they were as legitimate subjects of  
property as their horses or cattle. The  
quiet and monotonous course of coloni-  
al life had been disturbed by no alarm,  
and little reflection on the value of lib-  
erty. And when alarm was taken at an  
enterprize of their own, it was not easy  
to carry them the whole length of the  
principles which they invoked for them-  
selves. In the first or second session of  
the Legislature, after I became a mem-  
ber, I drew to this subject the attention  
of Colonel Bland, one of the oldest,  
ablest, and most respected members, and  
he undertook to move for certain mod-  
erate extensions of the protection of the  
laws to these people. I seconded his  
motion, and, as a younger member, was  
no more spared in the debate: but he  
was denounced as an enemy to his coun-  
try, and was treated with the greatest in-  
decorum. From an early stage of our  
revolution, other and more distant duties  
were assigned to me, so that from that  
time till my return from Europe in 1789,  
and, I may say, till I returned to reside  
at home, in 1809, I had little oppertuni-  
ty of knowing the progress of public sen-  
timent here on this subject. J had always  
hoped that the younger generation, re-  
ceiving their early impressions after the  
the flame of liberty had been kindled in  
every breast, and had become, as it were,  
the vital spirit of every American, that  
the generous temperament of youth, anal-  
agous to the motion of their blood, and  
above the suggestions of avarice, would  
have sympathised with oppression wher-  
ever found, and proved their love of lib-  
erty beyond their own share of it. But  
my intercourse with them, since my fe-  
turn, has not been sufficient to ascertain  
that that they had made towards this  
point the progress I had hoped. Your  
  
  
  
was duly received, and was read with pe-  
  
  
  
solitary, but welcome voice, is the first  
  
iwhich has brought this sound-to my ear;  
land I have considered the general silence  
  
which prevails on this subject, as indi-  
cating an apathy unfavorable to every  
hope. Yet, the hour of Emancipation is  
advancing in the march of time. It will  
come’; and whether brought on by the  
generous energy of our own minds, or by  
the bloody process of St. Domingo, ex-  
cited and conductéd by the power of our  
present enemy, if once stationed perma-  
nently within our country, offering asy-  
lum and arms to the oppressed, is a leaf  
of our history, not yet turned over.  
  
As to the method by which this diffi-  
cult work is to be effected, if permitted  
to be done by ourselves, | have seen no  
proposition so expedient, on the whole,  
as that of emancipation of those born af-  
ter a given day, and of their education,  
and expatriation at a proper age. ‘This  
would give time for a gradual extinction  
of that species of labor and substitution

any colour, but of this colour we know,

necessity for thought or forecast, are by  
their habits rendered as incapable as  
children of taking care of themselves,

religious precept, “be not weary in well  
doing.” That your success may be as

The following communication presents  
  
  
  
some of the damning features of slavery  
  
in society by their idleness, and the de-| in a light, which even the blind cannot  
  
predations to which this leads them.—  
Their amalgamation with the other co-  
lour produces a degradation to which no

This enterprise is for the young, for those  
who can follow it up, and bear it through  
to its consummation. It shall have all my  
prayers, and these are the only weapons  
of an old man. But in the mean time, are  
you right in abandoning this property, and  
your country with it? | think not. My  
opinion has ever been that, until more can  
be done for them, we should endeavour  
with those whom fortune hasthrown on  
our hands, to feed and clothe them well,  
protect them from ill usage, require such  
reasonable labour only as is performed

MonrtIicE Lo, Aug. 25, —14.  
  
Dear Sirn—Your favor of July 31, was  
duly received, and was read with pecu-  
liar pleasure. The sentiments breathed  
  
  
  
  
  
through the whole do honor to both the  
  
public, and time has only served to give  
them stronger root. The love of justice  
and the love of country plead equally the  
cause of these people, and it isa moral  
reproach to us that they should have  
pleaded it so long in vain, and should  
have produced not a single effort, nay I  
fear not much serious willingness, to re-  
lieve them and ourselves from our present  
condition of moral and political reproba-  
tion. From those of a former generation,  
who werein the fulness of age when I  
came into public life, which was while  
our controversy with England was on  
paper only, I soon saw that nothing was  
to be hoped. Nursed and educated in the  
daily habit of seeing the degraded condi-  
tion, both bodily and mental, of those un-  
fortunate beings, not reflecting that that  
degradation was very much the work of  
themselves and their fathers, few minds  
had yet doubted but that they were as le-  
gitimate subjects of property as their  
horses or cattle. The quiet and mono-  
tonous course of colonial life had been dis-  
turbed by no alarm, and little reflection on  
the value of liberty ; and when alarm was  
taken at an enterprize on their own, it  
was not easy to carry them the whole

pression wherever found, and proved their  
love of liberty beyond their own share of

my return, has not been sufficient to ascer-  
tain that they had made towards this point

the hour of emancipation is advancing in

whether brought on by the generous en-  
ergy of our own minds, or by the bloody  
process of St. Domingo, excited and con-

our country and offering asylum and arms  
to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history  
not yet turned over.  
  
As to the method by which this diffi-  
cult work is to be effected, if permitted to  
be done by ourselves, I have seen no pro-  
position so expedient on the whole, as  
that of emancipation of those born after a  
certain day, and of thew education and  
expatriation ata properage. This would  
  
give time for a gradual extinction of that  
species of labor and substitution of ano-  
ther, and lessen the severity of the shock

by their idleness and the depredations to  
which this leads them. Their amalga-  
matton with the other color produces a  
degradation to which no lover of his coun-  
try—no lover of excellence in the human  
character—can innocently consent.  
  
Iam sensible of the partialities with  
which you have looked towards me, as  
the person who should undertake this  
salutary but arduous work. But this, my  
dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to

MoRTicKu.it, AuGiryr 25, *14.  
III.am Sm : Yoor favour of July 31, was duly receiv­  
•d, and tvas rend with peculiar pleasure. The scn&#x27;i*  
menls breathed through the wlmle do honour to both the  
head and heart of the writer. Mine on the subject of thf  
slavery of negroes have long since been in possession o|  
the public, an t time bus only served to give them strong­  
er mot. The love of justice and the love ofcountry plead  
equally the cause of these people, and it is a mortal re­  
pioach to tis that they should have pleaded it so long in  
vain, and should have produced not a single effor’, nay  
I fear not much serious wi Imgnest to relieve them and  
otnielves from our present condition of moral and politi­  
cal reprobation From those ol the former generation who  
were in the fulness of age when I came into public life,  
which was while our controversy with Kngland was on pa­  
per only, I soon saw that nothing was to he Imped. Nur­  
sed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degra­  
del condition, both bodily and mciita’,, of those unfortu­  
nate beingst not reflecting that that degradation was very  
much the work of themselves and their fathers, few minds  
had yet doubted that they were as legitimate subjects of  
property as their horses or cattle. The quint and mono,  
• •nous course of colonial life had been disturbed by no a~  
larm, and little reflection on the value of liberty. And  
when alarm was taken at an enterprise an their own, it  
was not easy to carry them the whole length of the prin­  
ciples which they invoked for themselves. In the fust or  
second session of the legislature after I became a member,  
I drew to this subject the attention of Col Bland, one of  
the oldest, ablest, and most respected members, and ho  
undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the  
protection of the laws to these people 1 seconded his  
motion, and, as a younger member, was more spared in  
the debate : but lie was denounced as an enemy to his  
country, and was treated with the grossest indecorum.—  
Front an early singe ol our revolution other and more du­  
tanl duties were assigned to me, so that Irom iliat time till  
my return from h.urope in 1 Tflti, and I may say till I re-■  
turned to icside at home in 1U09, 1 had little opportunity  
of knowing the progress of public sentiment here on this  
subject. I had always Imped thatihe younger generation  
receiving their early impressions after the flame of liberty  
had been kindled in &quot;very breast, and had become as it  
were the vital spirit of every American, that the gener­  
ous temperament of youth, analogous to the motion of  
their blood, and above the suggestions of avarice, would  
have sympathized with oppression wherever found, and  
proved their love of liberty beyond their own share of it.  
But my intercourse with them smee my return has not  
been sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards  
this point the progress I had hoped. Your solitary hut  
welcome voice is the first which has (nought this sound to  
my ear ; and I have considered the general silence  
which prevails on this subject as indicating an apathy  
unfavorable to every hope. Yet the hour of email.  
  
n pat ion is arivancing, in the march, of time. It will  
come: and whether brought on by the generous en­  
ergy of our own minds, or hy the bloody pro ess of  
St. Domingo, excited and conducted by the power of  
our present enemy, if once stationed permanently within  
cur country, and oflering asylum and arms to the oppres­  
sed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned over.  
As to the method hy which this difficult work is to he  
effected, if permitted to he done hy ourselves, I have seen  
no proposition so expedient on the whole, as that of c­  
mancipatinn of those horn after a given day, and of their  
education and expatriation at a proper age. This would  
3&#x27;ve time for a gradual extinct on of that species of labour  
and substitution of another, and lessen the severity of the  
shock which an operation so fundamental cannot fill to  
produce. The idea of emancipating the whole at once,  
the old as well as the young, and retaining them heie, is  
of those only who have not the guide of either knowledge  
or experience of the subject. For, men, probably of any  
colour, but of this colour wc know, htnught up from their  
infancy without necessity for thought or forecast, are hy  
their habits rendered as incapable as children of taking  
care of themselves, At. are extinguished promptly wherever  
industry is necessary for raising the young. In the mean*  
t&#x27;me they are pests in society hv their idleness, and the  
depredations to which this leads them. Their amalga­  
mation with the other colour produces a degradation to  
which no Inver of his country, no lover of excellence in  
the human character can innocently consent  
I am sensible of the partialities with which you have  
looked towards me as the person who should undertake  
this salutary hilt arduous work, lint this, my dear Sir,  
is like bidding old Priam to buckle the armour of l ienor  
“trementihus revo humeris et inutile ferrnm eingi ” No,  
I have overlived the generation with which mutual labors  
and perils begat mutual confidence and influence. This  
enterptise is for the young—for those who can follow it  
up. and bear it through to its consummation, /t shall  
have all my prayers, and these are the only weapons of  
an old man. But in the mean time are you right in  
abandoning this property, and your country with h? 1  
think not. My opinion has ever been, that, until-more  
can be done fm them, we should endeavor, with those  
whom fortune has thrown on our hands, to feed and  
clothe them well, protect them from ill usage, re­  
quire such reasonable labour only as is per?ornicd  
voluntarily by freemen, arid be led by no repug­  
nances to abdicate them, and our duties to them.—  
The laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that  
were for their good—and to commute them for other pro.  
pony, is to commit them to tho^c who«e tisn^e of them  
wo cannot confront. I hope then, my clear Sir, yon will  
reconcile, yourself to your country and its unfortunate  
condition—that you will not lessen its stock of sound dis­  
position by withdrawing your portion from the mass.—  
That, on the contrary you will come forward in the public  
councils, beccMee the missionary of this d.jctrine truly  
Christian—insinuate and inculcate it softly but steadily,  
through the medium of writing and conversation—asso­  
ciate others in your labours, and when the phalanx is  
formed, bring on and press the proposition perseveringly  
until its accomplishment. It is an encouraging ohsrrva:  
non, that no good measure was ever proposed, which, if  
duly pursued, failed to prevail in the end. We have  
proof of this in the history of the endeavors in the Bri:  
tish parliament to suppress that very trade which brought  
this evil on ur. And you will he supported bv th&quot; religious  
precept, “be not weary in well doing.” Thai your sucre-s  
may be as speedy and complete, as it will he of honorable  
and immortal consolation to yourself, I shall as fervently  
and sincerely pray as I assure ofmv great friendship and  
respect. TH. JEFFERSON

and itis a moral reproach to us that they  
should have pleaded it so long in vain,  
and should have produced not a single  
effort, nay I fear not much serious wil-  
lingness, to relieve them and ourselves  
from our present condition of moral and  
political reprobation. From those of a  
former generation, who were in the ful-  
ness of age when I came into public life,  
which was while our controversy witb  
England was on paper only, I soon saw  
that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed  
and educated in the daily habit of sze-  
ing the degraded condition, both bodily  
and mental, of those unfortunate beings,  
not reflecting that that degradation was  
very much the work of themselves and  
their fathers, few minds had yet doubted  
but that they were as legitimate subjects  
of property as their horses or cattie.—  
The quiet and monotonous course of co-  
Jonial life, had been disturbed by no  
alarm, and little reflection on the value of  
liberty; and when alarm was taken at an  
enterprise on their own, it was not easy  
to carry them the whole length of the |  
principles which they invoked for them-|  
selves. In the first or second session of |  
  
|  
  
}  
  
  
  
the Legislature, after I became a mem-  
ber, I drew to this subject the attention  
of Col. Bland, one of the oldest, ablest,  
and most respected members, and he un-  
dertook to move for certain moderate ex-  
tensions of the protection of the laws to  
these people. [I seconded his motion, |  
and, as a younger member, was more spar- |  
ed in the debate; but he was denounced |  
us an enemy to his country, and was treat- |  
ed with the grossest indecorum. From!  
an early stage of the revolution, other4  
and more. distant duties were assigned |  
me, so that from that time till my return:  
from Europe in 1789, and I may say, till 1  
retnrned to weside at home in 1809, L had |  
little opportunity of knowing the pro-|  
gress of public sentiment here, on this  
subject.  
younger generation, receiving their early  
impressions after the flame of liberty had |  
been kindled in every breast, and bad  
become, as it were, the vital spirit of  
every American, that the generous tem. |  
perament of youth, analagous to the’  
motion of their blood, and above the sug- |  
gestions of avarice, Would have sympa-  
thised with oppression wherever found,  
and proved their love of liberty beyond  
their own share of it. But my inter-  
  
  
  
&#x27;  
  
course with them, since my return, has  
  
  
  
not been sufficient to ascertain that they  
  
  
  
had made towards thispoint the progress  
I had hoped. Your solitary but welcome  
voice is the first which has brought this  
sound to my ear; and I have considered  
the general silence which prevails on  
this subject as indicating an apathy un-  
favorable to every hope. Yet the hour  
of emancipation is advancing in the  
march of time. It will come; and whe-  
ther brought on by the generous energy  
of our own minds, or by the bloody pro-  
cess of St. Domingo, excited and con-  
ducted by the power of our present ene-  
my, if ouce stationed permanently with-  
in our country, and offering asyluin and  
arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our  
history not yet turned over.  
  
As to the method by which this diffi-  
cult work 1s to be effected, if permitted  
to be done by ourselves, I have seen no  
proposition so expedient on the whole,  
as that of emancipation of those born  
after a certain day, and of their educa-  
tion and expatriation at a proper age.—  
This would give time for the gradual  
extinction of that species of labor and  
substitution of another, and lessen the  
severity of the shock which an operation  
so fundamental never fails to produce.  
The idea of emancipating the whole at  
once, the old as well as the young, and  
retaining them here, is of those only who  
have not the guide of either knowledge  
orexperience of the subject. For men,  
probably of any color, but of this color  
we know, brought up from their infancy  
without necessity, forethought or fore-  
cast, are by their habits rendered as in-  
capable as children of taking care of  
themselves, and are extinguished prompt-  
ly whenever industry 1s necessary for  
raising the young. In the mean time,  
they are pests in society by their idle-  
ness, and the depredations to which this  
‘leads them. Their amalgamation with  
  
  
  
| the other color produces a degradation to

\which you have looked towards me, as  
the person who should undertake this

/my dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to

those who can *ollow it up and bear it  
through to its consummation. I[t shall  
have all my prayers, and these are the only  
weapons of an old man. But in the  
meantime, are you right in abandoning  
this property, and your country with it!  
I think not. My opinion has ever been  
that, until more can be done for them,  
we should endeavour, with those whom  
fortune has thrown on our hands, to feed  
and clothe them well, protect them from  
ill usage, require such reasonable labor  
only as is performed voluntarily by free-  
men, and be led by no repugnancies to  
abdicate them, and our duties to them.  
The laws do not permit us to turn them  
loose, if that were for their good; and to  
commute them for other property, is to  
commit them to those whose usage of  
them we cannot control. I hope ‘then,  
  
my dear sir, you will reconcile yourself  
  
to your country and its unfortunate con-  
dition; that you will not lessen its stock  
of sound disposition by withdrawing  
your portion from the mass; that, on the  
contrary, you will come forward ‘n the  
public councils, insinuate and inculcate  
it, softly but steadily, through the me-  
dium of writing and conversation, asso-  
ciate others in your labors, and when the  
  
phalanx is formed, bring on and press |  
  
the proposition perseveringly, until its  
accomplishment. Ir 1s AN ENCOURAGING  
OBSERVAION THAT NO GOOD MEASURE  
WAS EVER PROPOSED, WHICH, IF DULY  
PURSUED, FAILFD TO PREVAIL IN THE  
END. We have proof of this in the his-  
tory of the endeavors of the British par-  
liament to suppress that very trade, which  
brought -this evil on us; and you will be  
supported by the religious precept ‘be  
not wearied in well doing.’ That your  
success may be as spe edy and complete, |  
as it will be of honorable and immortal |  
  
consolation to yourself, I shall as fervent- |  
  
ly and sincerely pray, as I assure you of |  
my great friendshi ip and respect.

on the subject of the slavery of negroes,  
have long since been in possession of the  
public, and time has only served to give  
them stronger root. The love of justice  
and the love of country plead equally the  
cause of these people, and itis a moral  
reproach to us that they should have

have produced not a single effort, nay I  
fear not much serious willingness, to re-

tion: .From those of a former generation,  
who were in the fulness of age when I  
came into public life) which was while  
our controversy with England was on  
paper only, I soon saw that nothing was  
to be hoped. Nuyrsed and educated in the  
daily habit of seeing the degraded condi-  
tion, both bodily and mental, of those un-  
fortunate beings, not reflecting that that  
degradation was very much the work, of  
themselves and their fathers, few minds  
had yet doubted but that they were as le-  
gitimate subjects of property as their  
horses or cattle. The quiet and mono-  
tonous course of colonial Jife had been dis-  
turbed by no alarm, and little reflection on  
the value of liberty ; and when alarm was  
taken at an enterprize on their own, it  
was not easy to carry theni the whole  
length of the principles which they invok-  
ed for themselves. In the first or se-  
cond session of the Legislature, after I be-

lution, other and more distant duties were  
assigned me,so that from that time till  
my return from Europe in 1789, and I  
may say, till I returned ta reside at home  
in 1809, I had little opportunity of know-  
ing the progress of public sentiment here,  
on this subject. I had always hoped that  
the younger generation, receiving their  
early impressions after the flame of liberty  
had been kindled in every breast, and had  
become, as it. were, the vital spiritof eve-  
ry American, that the generous tempera-  
merit of youth, analogous to the motion of  
their blood, and above the suggestions of  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
RR sen  
  
ayaric ari e, would have sympathised with op-|  
  
pression wherever found, and proved their  
love of liberty beyond their own share of  
it. But my intercourse with them, since  
my return, has not been sufficient to ascer-  
tain that they had made towards this point

‘ “Mon-ricELLo, August 25, 1814,  
  
Dear sir: Your favor of July 31, was duly received, and  
was read with peculiar pleasure. The sentiments breathed  
throughout the whole, do honor to both the head and heart  
of the writer. Mine, on the subject of the slavery of ne-  
groes, have, long since, been in the possession of the public;  
and time has only served to give them stronger root. The  
love of justice, and the love of country plead, equally, the  
cause of these people; and it isa moral reproach to us, that  
they should have pleaded it so long in vain, and should have  
produced not a single effort—nay, I fear, not much serious  
willingness to relieve them and ourselves from our present  
condition of moral and political reprobation.”  
[See, sir, how the “love of justice,” and the “love of  
country” pleaded through the pen of this ‘apostle of liberty,”  
for the rights of his colored brethren; and how keenly he felt  
the “moral reproach” of their having failed to produce any  
effort, or even willingness, to afford relief. Have we any  
less reason to feel the reproach now, than he had, near a  
quarter of a century ago? Ifow long would slavery and  
the slave trade live in this district, if Jefferson’s weie the  
master spirit in these legislative halls? But he procceds:}  
“From those of the former generation, who were in the  
fullness of age when I came into public life, which was  
on paper only, I soon saw that nothing was to be hoped.—  
Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degra-  
ded condition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortunate  
beings, but not reflecting that that degradation was very  
much the work of themselves and their fathers, few minds  
have yet doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects of  
property as their horses or catle,”

“The quiet and monotonous course of colonial life had  
been disturbed by no alarm, and little reflection on the value  
of liberty: and when an alarm was taken at an enterprise of  
their own, it was not easy to carry them to the whole length  
of the principles which they invoke for themselves. In the  
first or second session of the legislature afterI became a  
member, | drew to this subject the attention of Colonel Bland,  
one of the oldest, ablest, and most reputable members; and  
he undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the  
protection of the laws to these people. . I seconded his mo-  
tion, and as a younger member, was more spared in the de-  
bate; but he was denounced as an enemy to his country, and  
was treated with the greatest indecorum,”

Monticf.m.0, Aug. 25, 1814.  
Dear Sir Your favor of July 31 was duly re  
ceived. and was rend with peculiar pleasure. The  
sentiments breathed through the whole, do honor  
to both the head and the heart of the writer.  
Mine on the subject of the slavery of negroes have  
Ion&quot; since been in possession ol tne public, and  
time has only served to give them stronger root  
The love of justice and the love of country plead  
equally the cause of these people, and it is a mor­  
tal reproach to us that they should have pleaded  
it so long in vain, and should have produced not  
a single effort, hay, I fear not much serious wil­  
lingness to relieve them and ourselves from our  
present condition of moral and political reproba  
tion. From those of a former generation who  
were in the fulness or age when 1 came into pub  
lic life, which was while our controversy with Lng&#x27;  
land was on paper only, I soon saw that nothing  
was to be hoped. Nursed and educated in the  
daily habit of seeing the degraded condition, both  
bodily and mental, of those unfortunate beings,  
not reflecting that that degradation was very much  
the work of themselves and their fathers, few  
minds had yet doubted but that they were as le  
gitimate subjects of property as their horses or  
cattle. The quiet and monotonous course of colo­  
nial life had been disturbed by no alarm and little  
reflection on the value of liberty ; and when alarm  
was taken at an cnterprize of their own, it was  
not easy to carry them the whole length of the  
principles which they invoked for themselves. In  
the first or second session of the legislature after  
I became a member, I drew to this subject the at  
tention of Col. Eland, one of the oldest, ablest  
and most respected members, and he undertook  
to move for certain moderate extensions of the  
protection of the laws to these people. I second­  
ed his motion, and, as a younger member, was  
more spared in the debate; but he was denounc  
ed as an enemy to his country, and was treated  
with the greatest indecorum, rrom an early  
stage of our revolution, other and more distant  
duties were assigned to ine ; so that from that  
time till my return from Europe in 17S9, and, I  
may say, till I returned to reside at home in 1S09,  
I had little opportunity of knowing the progress  
of public sentiment here on this subject. I had  
always hoped that the younger generation, receiv­  
ing their early impressions after the flame of lib  
erty had been kindled in every breast, and had  
become, as it were, the vital spirit of every Amer  
ican, that the generous temperament of youth, an-  
alagous to the motion of their blood and above the  
suggestions of avarice, would have sympathized  
with oppression, wherever found, and proved their  
love of liberty beyond their own share of it. But  
my intercourse with them since my return, has  
not been sufficient to ascertain that they had  
made towards this point the progress I had hop  
ed. Your solitary but welcome voice is the first  
which nas brought this sound to my ear, and 1  
have considered the general silence which prevails  
on this subject, as indicating an apathy unfavora  
ble to every hope. Vet the hour of emancipation  
is advancing in the march of time. It will come,  
and whether brought on by the generous energv  
of our own minds, or by the bloody process of  
bt. Domingo, excited and conducted by the pow­  
er of our present enemy, if once stationed perma­  
nently within our country, and offering asylum  
and arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our histo­  
ry not yet turned over. As to the method by  
which this difficult work is to be effected, if per­  
mitted to be done by ourselves, I have seen no  
proposition so expedient on the whole, as that of  
emancipation of those born alter a given day, and  
of their education and expatriation at a proper  
age. This would give time for a gradual extinc  
tion of that species of labor and substitution of  
another, and lessen the severity of the shock  
which an operation so fundamental cannot fail to  
produce. The idea of emancipating the whole  
at once, the old as well as the young, and retain­  
ing them here, is of those only who have not the  
guide of either knowledge or experience on the  
subject. For, men, probably of any color, but of  
this color, we know, brought up from their infan­  
cy without necessity for thought or forecast, are  
by their habits rendered as incapable as children  
of taking care of themselves, and are extinguish­  
ed promptly wherever industry is necessary for  
raising the young. In the mean time, they are  
pests in society by their idleness and the depreda­  
tions to which this leads them. Their amalga­  
mation with the other color, produces a degrada­  
tion to which no lover of his country, no lover of  
excellence in the human character, can easily con­  
sent. I am sensible of the partialities with which  
you have looked towards me as the person who  
should undertake this salutary but arduous work.  
But this, my dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to  
buckle on the armor of Hector, &#x27; trementibus arvo  
humoris et inutile ferrutneigne.&#x27; No, I have over­  
lived the generation with which mutual labors and  
perils begat mutual confidence&#x27; and influence.  
This enterprise is for the young, for those who  
can follow it up and bear it through to its con­  
summation. &#x27;It shall have nil my prayers, and  
these arc the only weapons of an old man. But  
in the mean time, are you right in abandoning  
this property, and your country with it? 1 think  
. not. My opinion has ever been, that until more  
can bo done for them, we should endeavor with  
those whom fortune has thrown on our hands, to  
feed and clothe them well, protect them from ill  
usage, require such reasonable labor as is perform­  
ed voluntarily by freemen, and be led by no re­  
pugnances to abdicate them, and our duties to  
them. The laws do not permit us to turn them  
loose, if that were for their good, and to commute  
them for other property is to commit them to those  
whose usage of them we cannot control. I hope  
then, my dear sir, you will reconcile yourself to  
your country and its unfortunate condition that i  
  
T II B1  
  
you &quot;will not lessen its stock of sound disposition,  
by withdrawing your portion from the mass that  
on the contrary, you will come forward in the  
public councils, become a missionary of this doc­  
trine, truly Christian, insinuate and inculcate it  
softly but stendily through the medium of writing  
and conversation, associate others in your labors,  
and when you have the phalanx formed, bring on  
and press the proposition perseveringly, until its

Dear. Sir,Your favor of July 31st  
was duly received, and was read with pe-  
  
cuuar pleasure. , i he sentiments breath  
  
ed through the whole do honor to both  
the head and heart of the writerv Mine,  
on the subject of the slavery of negroes,  
have long since been in possession of the  
public, and time has only served to give

ed it so long in vain, and should have  
pioduced not a single effort, hay, I fear,  
not much serious willingness to relieve  
them and ourselves from our present con­  
dition of moral and political reprobation.  
From those of the former generation,  
who were in the fullness of age when I  
  
came into public life, which was while  
our controversy with England was on pa

et ini  
  
Mon TIcELLo,  
  
August 25, 1814.  
  
Dear Sirn:—Your favor of July  
31, was duly received, and was read  
with peculiar pleasure. ‘The senti-  
ments breathed through the whole  
do honor both to the head and heart  
of the writer. Mine on the subject  
of the slavery of negroes have long  
since been in possession of the pub-  
lic, and time has only served to give |  
them stronger root. The love of  
justice and the love of country plead  
equally the cause of these people,  
and it is a mortal reproach to us that  
they should have pleaded it so long  
in vain, and should have produced  
not a single effort, nay I fear not  
much serious willingness, to relieve  
them and ourselves from our present  
condition of moral and political rep-  
robation. From those in the former  
generation, who were in the fullness  
of age when I came into public life,  
which was while our controversy  
with England was on paper only, |  
soon saw that nothing was to be  
hoped. Nursed and educated in the  
daily habit of seeing the degraded  
condition, both bodily and mental,  
of those unfortunate beings, not re-  
flecting that that degradation was  
very much the work of themselves  
and their fathers, few minds had yet  
doubted but that they were as legiti-  
mate subjects of property as their  
horses or cattle. ‘The quiet and mo-  
notonous course of colonial life had  
been disturbed by no alarm, and  
little reflection on the value of liberty.  
And when alarm was taken at an en-  
terprise on their own, it was not e: sy  
to carry them the whole length of  
the principles which they invoked  
for themselves. In the first or second  
session of the legislature after I be-  
came a member, I drew to this sub-  
ject the attention of Col. Bland, one  
of the oldest, ablest, and most re- ||  
spected members, and he undertook |  
  
ll  
  
&#x27;to move for certain moderate exten-  
  
| cee of the protection of the laws  
| to these people. | seconded his mo-  
  
tion, and, as a younger member, was  
more spared in the debate; but he  
was denounced as an enemy to his  
country, and was treated with the  
greatest indecorum. From an early  
stage of our Revolution, other and  
more distant duties were assigned to  
me, so that from that time till my re-  
turn from Europe in 1789, and I  
may say, till I returned to reside at  
  
home in 1809, I had little opportu-  
  
nity of knowing the progress of pub-  
  
‘lie sentiment here on this subject. J  
  
had always hoped that the younger  
generation, receiving their early im-  
pressions after the flame of liberty  
had been kindled in every breast,  
and had become, as it were, the vital  
spirit of every American, that the  
generous temperament of y outh, an-  
alogous to the motion of their blood,  
  
and above the suggestions of avarice,  
  
would have sympathized with op-  
pression wherever found, and proved  
their love of liberty beyond their  
own share of it. But my intercourse  
with them, since my return, has not  
been sufficient to ascertain that they  
had made towards this point the pro-  
gress I had hoped. Your solitary  
but welcome voice is the first which  
has brought this sound to my ear;  
and I have considered the general  
silence which prevails on this sub-  
  
ject as indicating 4n apathy unfavor-  
  
able to every hope. Yet the hour  
of emancipation is advancing in the  
march of time. It will come; and  
whether brought on by the generous  
energy of our own minds, or by the  
bloody process of St. Domingo, ex-  
  
cited and conducted by the power of  
  
our present enemy, if once stationed  
permanently within our country, and  
offering asylum and arms to the op-  
pressed, is a leaf of our history not  
yet turned over.

difficult work is to be eflected, if per-  
mitted to be done by ourselves, I  
have seen no proposition so expedi-  
ent on the whole, as that of emanci-  
pation of those born after a given  
day, and of their education and ex-  
patriation at a proper age. This  
would give time for a gradual extine-  
tion of that species of labor and sub-  
stitution of another, and lessen the  
severity of the shock which an ope-  
ration so fundamental cannot fail to  
produce. ‘The idea of emancipating  
the whole at once,the old as weil as  
the young) and retaining them here,  
is of thofe only who have not the  
guide of either knowledge or expe-  
rience of the subject. For men, pro-  
bably of any color, but of this color  
we know, brought up from their in-  
fancy without necessity for thought  
or forecast, are by their tabits ren-  
  
dered as ineapable as children, of  
  
taking care of themselves, and are  
extinguished promptly wherever in-  
dustry is necessary for raising the  
young. In the meantime, they are  
pests in society by their idleness,  
and the depredations to which this  
leads them. Their amalgamation with  
the other color produces a degrada-  
tion to which no lover of his country,  
no lover of excellence in the human  
character, can innocently consent.  
  
I am sensible of the partialities  
with which you have looked towards  
me as the person who should under-  
take this salutary but arduous work.  
But this, mv dear sir, is like bidding  
old Priam to buckle the armour of  
Hector—* trementibus 2vo humeris  
et inutile ferrumeingi.”’ No, I have  
overlived the generation with which  
mutual labors and perils begat mutual  
confidence and influence.  
terprise is for the young: for those  
who can follow it up, and bear it  
through to its consummation. It  
  
shall have all my prayers, and these ||  
are the only weapons of an old man. |

in abandoning this property, and your  
country with it? [think not. My  
opinion has everbeen that, until more  
can be done for them, we should en-  
deavor, with those whom fortune has  
thrown on our hands, to feed and  
clothe them well, protect them from  
ill usage, require such reasonable  
labor only as is performed voluntari-  
ly by freemen, and be led by no re-  
pugnances to abdicate them, and our  
duties to them. ‘The laws do not  
permit us to turn them loose, if that  
were for their good ° and to commute  
them for other property, is to com-  
  
mit them to those whose usage of  
  
them we cannot control. I hope,  
then, my dear sir, you will reconcile  
vourself to vour country and its un-  
fortunate condition; that yeu will  
not lessen its stock of sound disposi-  
tion by withdrawing your portion  
from the mass. ‘That on the con-  
trary, you will come forward in the  
public councils, become the mission-  
ary of this doctrine truly Christian,  
insinuate and inculcate it softly but  
steadily through the medium of writ-  
ing and conversation, associate others  
in your labors, and when the pha-  
lanx is formed, bring on and press  
the proposition perseveringly until  
its accomplishment. It is an encou-  
raging observation, that no good  
measure was ever proposed which,  
if duly pursued, failed to prevail in  
the end. We have proof of this in  
the history of the endeavors in the  
British Parliament to suppress that  
very trade which brought this evil  
onus. And you will be supported  
by the religious precept, * Be not  
wearied in well-doing.’”” ‘That your  
success may be as speedy and com-  
plete, as it will be of honorable and  
  
‘immortal consolation to yourself, I  
  
shall as fervently and sincerely pray,  
as | assure you of my great friend-  
ship and respect.

Monticem.o, Aug. 25, 1814.  
Dear Sir—Your favor ol July Hist was  
| duly received and was read with peculiar  
1 pleasure. The sentiments breathed through  
the whole, do honor both to the head and  
heart ot the writer. Mine, on the subject  
ol slavery of negroes, have long since been  
in possession ol the public, and time has  
only served to give them stronger proof.—  
The love of justice and the love of country  
plead equally in the cause of these people,  
j and it is a mortal reproach to us that thev  
I should have pleaded so long in v ain, and  
| should have produced not a single effort,  
: nay, 1 fear not much serious willingness, to  
1 relieve them and ourselves, from our pres­  
| cut condition of moral and political repro­  
i ballon.  
From those in a former generation, who  
were in the fullness of age when l came in­  
to public life, which was while our contro­  
versy with England was on paper only, I  
soon saw that nothing was to be hoped.—  
Nursed and educated in the daily habit of  
seeing the degraded condition, both bodily  
and mental, of those unfortunate beings,not  
reflecting that the degradation was very  
much the work of themselves and their fa  
tilers few minds had yet doubted hut that  
they were as legitimate subjects of proper­  
ty as their horses or cattle. The quietnnd  
monotonous course of colonial life Mad been  
disturbed by no alarm, and little rd! ction  
on the value of liberty. And when an a­  
larm was taken at an enterprise of their  
own. it was not easy to carry them the  
whole length of the principles which they  
invoked for themselves.  
  
In the lirstor second session of the Leg­  
islature, after I became a member, 1 drew  
to litis subject the attention of Col. Bland,  
one of the oldest, ablest and most respected  
! members, and he undertook to move for  
certain moderate extensions of the. protee­  
! tion of tin; laws to these people. I -eeon­  
ded his motion, and, as it young member,  
was more spared in the debate ; but lit* Was  
denounced as an enemy to his country, and  
was treated with the greatest indecorum.  
From an early stage of our revolution,other  
and more distant duties were assigned to  
me, so that from that time till my return  
Europe in ITH t, and 1 may say till I re­  
turned to reside at home in 1800, 1 had lit- ;  
tie opportunity of knowing the progress of  
public sentiment on this subject.  
I had always hoped that the younger ge­  
neration, receiving their earlier impressions  
after the llamo of liberty find been kindled  
in every breast, and had become, as it were,  
the vital spirit of every American, that the  
generous temperament of youth, analogous  
to the motion of their blood, and above the |  
suggestions of avarice, would have syntpa*  
thized with oppression wherever found, and  
proved their love of liberty beyond their  
own share of it. But my intercourse xvith  
them, since tny return, has not been suffi­  
cient to ascertain that they had made to­  
xvards this point the progress which 1 had  
hoped.  
Your solitary hut welcome voice is the  
first which has brought this sound to my :  
ear; and I have considered the general si­  
lence which prevails on this subj et, as in-   
dieating an apathy unfavorable to every  
hope. Yet the hour of emancipation is  
adtanciug iu the march of time. It will  
come ; and whether brought on hy the ge­  
nerous energy of our own minds, or hy the  
bloody process ol St. Domingo,excited and  
conducted hy the power of our present ene­  
my, if once stationed permanently within  
our country*, and offering asylum and arms&#x27;  
to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not

Monticei.i.o. August 2&#x27;*.  
Dear Sir: Your favor or July 3i$t was du!\
received, anti was read with peculiar plea&gt;uie.  
The sentiments breathed through the whole do  
honor to both the head and heart of the writer.  
Mine on the subject of the slavery of negroes I  
have long since been in possession of the public,  
and time has only served to give them stionger  
root  
The love of justice and the love of country  
plead equally the cause of these people, and it  
is a mortal reproach to us that they should have  
pleaded it so long in vain, and should have pro­  
duced not a single effort—nay,! fear, not much  
serious willingness—to relieve them and oursel­  
ves from our present condition of moral and  
political reprobat on. From those of the for­  
mer generation who were in the fulness of age  
when 1 came into public l ie, which was while  
our controversy with England was on pa|**r  
only, l soon saw that nothing wa^ to he hoped.  
Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing  
the degraded condition, both bodily and mental,  
of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting that  
that degradation was very much the work of  
themselves and their fathers, few minds had yet  
doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects  
of property as their horses or cattle. The quiet  
and monotonous course of colonial life had been  
disturbed by no alarm and little reflection on the  
value of liberty: anti, when alarm was taken  
at an enterprise of their own, it was not easy to  
carry them the whole length of the principles  
which they invoked for&#x27; themselves. In the  
first or second session of the Legislature alter !  
became a member, l drew to this subject the at­  
tention of Colont Bland, one of the ohle&gt;t, a­  
blest, and most rejected members, and lie un­  
dertook to move for certain moderate exten­  
sions ot the protection of the laws to these peo­  
ple. I seconded his motion, and. as a younger  
member, was more spared in the debate ; Nut  
he was denounced a&gt; an enemy to h s country,  
and was treated with the greatest indecorum.*  
From an early stage of our Revolution other  
and more distant duties weie assigned me. so  
that from that time til] my return from Europe  
in and. I may say, tHI I returned to reside  
at home in 1800, I had httleopportunity of know­  
ing the progress of public sentiment here on  
this subject. I had always hoped that the young­  
er generation, receiving their early impressions  
after the flame of liberty had been kindled in  
every breast, and had become as it were the vi­  
tal spirit of every American, that the generous  
temperament of youth, analogous to the motion  
of their bloixi. and above the suggestions of  
avarice, would have sympathized with oppies­  
sion wherever found, and proved their love of  
liberty bevon ! their own shire of it. But my  
intercourse with them s nee im return has not  
been sufficient to ascertain that they had made  
towards this point the progress 1 ha { hoped.—  
Your solitary but welcome vo ce is the first  
which has brought this sound to my ear. and I  
have considered the general silence which pre­  
vails on this subject as indicating an apathy un­  
favorable to our hopes. Yet the hour of eman­  
cipation is advancing in the march of time, it  
  
will come : and, whether brought on ny the  
generous energy of our own minds or by the  
bloody process of Domingo, excittvl an 1  
conducted by the power 01 our present enemy,  
if once stationed permanently within our coun­  
try, offering .asylum ami arms to the oppressed,  
is a leaf of our history not yet turned over.  
As to the method by which this difficult work  
is to be effected, if permuted to be dune by our*  
selves, I have seen no proposition so expedient,  
on the whole, as that of emancipation of those  
born after a given day. and of their education  
and expatriation at a prop rage This would  
give time for agradua! extinction of that species  
of labor, and substitution of another, and les­  
sen the severity of the shock which an opera­  
tion so fundamental cannot fail to produce.—  
The idea of emancipating the whole at once,  
the old as well as the young, and retaining them  
here, is of thoseorJv who have not the guide  
of either knowledge or experience on the sub­  
ject. For men. probably of ant color, but of this  
color we know*, brought up from their infancy  
without necessity for thought or forecast, are.  
by their habits, rendered as incapable as chil­  
dren of taking care of themselves, and are ex­  
tinguished promptly wherever industry is ne­  
cessary for raising the young. In the mean  
time they are pests in society by their idleness,  
and the depredations to which this leads them.  
Their amalgamation with the other color pro­  
duces a degradation to wh-ch no lover of his  
country, no lover of excellerce in the human  
character, can innocently consent.  
lam sensible of the partialities with which  
you have looked towards me as the person who  
should undertake this salutary and arduous

such reasonable labor only as is performed vol­

The laws do not |»erinit us to turn them loose, if  
that were forthetr good, and to commute them for

usage of them we cannot control. 1 hope, then  
  
my dear sir, you will reconcile yoursell to your

Dear Sir i Your favor of July 31st, was  
duly received and was read with peculiar  
pleasure. Ihe sentiments breathed through  
the whole do honor to both the head and  
heart ol Ihe writer. Mine on the subject  
the slavery ot negroes have long since been  
possession ol Ihe public, and lime uasonly  
The love of justice and ihe love of country  
plead equally Ihe cause of these people, and  
it i a moral reproach to us that they should  
have pleaded it so long in vain, and should  
have produced nol a single effort, nay, I fear  
not much serious willingness to relieve them  
and ourselves from our present condition  
moral and political reprobation. From those  
of the former generation who were in theness  
of age when 1 came into public  
which was while our controversy withEngland  
was on paper only, I soon saw thating  
was to be hoped. Nursed and educated  
in the daily habit of seeing the degraded con­  
dition, both bodily and mental, of those  
beings, not reflecting that that  
was very much the work of them  
selves and their lathers, tew minds had  
doubled but that they were as legitimate sub­  
jects of property as their horses or calile.  
The quiel and monotonous course of colonial  
life has been disturbcu by no alarm and  
reflection on Ihe value oi liberty. And when  
I alarm wna InL.Tk nlnn eripr.ai-h n  
Il  
il  
as  
it  
he  
If  
in  
as  
is  
be  
our  
be­  
longing are  
ev­  
ery lo  
and  
alarm was taken atan encroachment on  
own, it was not r.-7 iu carry litem the whole  
length of the principles which they invoked  
for themselves. In the first or second session  
of the Legislature after I became a member,  
1 drew to this subject Ihe attention of  
Bland, one of the oldest, ablest and most  
members, and he undertook to move  
for certain moderate extensions of Ihe protec­  
tion of the laws to these people. 1 seconded  
his motion, and, as a younger member,  
more spared in the debate ; but he was  
as an enemy lo his country, and  
treated with lite greatest indecorum.  
From an early stage of our revolution  
and more distant duties were assigned me,  
lliat from that time till my return from  
in 1789, and I may say till I returned  
reside at home in 1809, I had little opportu  
nity of knowing the progress of public senti­  
ment here on this subject. I had always  
that ihe younger generation, receiving  
their early impressions alter the ft tine of  
erty had been kindled in every breast;  
had become as it were the vital spirit of  
American, that Ihe generous temperament  
of youth, analogous lo the motion of  
blood, and above the suggestions of avarice,  
would have sympathised with oppression  
wherever found, and proved their love of  
beyond their own share of it. Dut  
intercourse with them, since my return,  
nol been sufficient to ascertain that they  
made towards this point Ihe progress I  
hoped. Your solitary but welcome voice  
the first which has brought this sound lo  
ear: and 1 have considered the general  
which prevails on this subject as  
cating an apathy unfavorable lo our hopes.  
Yet the hour of emancipation is advancing  
the march of lime. It will come; and wheth­  
er brought on by Ihe generous energy of  
own minds, or by the bloody process of  
Domingo, excited and conducted by the  
of our present enemy, if once stationed  
permanently w ithin our country, ottering  
lutn and arms to lha oppressed, is  
our history not yet turned over.  
As to the method by which this  
a leal  
work is to be effected, if permitted to be  
ourselves. 1 have seen no proposition  
expedient on the whole, as thai of emancipa-  
tion of those born after a giver, day, and  
iheir education snd expatriation al a  
gc. This n ctild give lime for a gradual  
  
of  
in  
tirictinnpf that species of labor nnd substitu­  
tion ofatmihpr, snd lessen the severity nf the  
shock which an operation so fundamental  
cinnot fail to produce. The iJea of emancipa­  
ting the thole at once, the olJ as well as the  
young, and retaining them here, is of those  
only wh have, not the guide of either knowl­  
edge or (Xperience on the subject. For men,  
probably oi any color, hut of this eolor we  
know, nrought up fro.n their infancy without  
necessity for thought or foreoast, are hy their  
habits rtadered as incapable aa children of  
Liking care o( themselves, and are extinguish­  
rd promptly wherever industry is necessary  
for raising the young. In the meantime they  
are pests in society by their idleness, nnd the  
depreciations to which tins lends them.  
Their amalgamation with the other color pro­  
duces a degradation to which no lover of his  
country no lover of excellence in the human  
character can innocently consent.  
1 am sensible of the partiality with which  
you hav looked towards me as Ihe peison  
who should undertake tins salutary and ardu  
ous work but this, mv dear sir. is like hid  
ding old Priam to buckle on the armor of old  
lleotoi, &quot; trememtibus acvo humeris et inu­  
tile ferruroeingi.&quot; No, I have overlived the  
generation with which mutual labors and per  
il begat mutual confidence and influence.  
I hi enterprise is for the young; for those  
who ca follow it up, and bear il through to  
its consummation. It shall have all my pray­  
ers, and these are the only weapons of an old  
man. Jiut in Ihe meantime, are you right in  
abandoning ibis property, and your country

we shoald endeavor with those whom fortune

you will reconcile yourself lo your country  
and it; unfortunate condition: that on the  
contrary you will come forward in the public  
councils, become the missionary of this doc­

Den tut; Yottr favour:if July 31st was daffy re

to both the head and hart df the writer. Mine   
on thesubject of slaittiy of nercies have long since   
been in possession of thapublie anti time has only   
served to give them stronger mot.   
The love of justice and the love of comity plead

in vain, end should have produc .0 not a single effort   
—nay I tearnot much serious!ilingness—to relieve   
titers and ourselves from our present conditori of   
Moral and political reprobat . From those o   
srlm   
the former generation who were in the fullness of   
agewben learns into public life, which was while   
our controversy with England was on paper only,   
I soon saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed   
and educated in the habit of seeing the degraded

hip, not reflecting that the degradation was very   
much the works of themselves and their fathers few   
minds had yet doubted but that they were es legi­  
&#x27; ornate subjects of property as their horses or cattle.   
The quiet and monotonous course of colonial life   
I had been disturbed by no alarm and little-reflec­  
i Lion on the value of liberty ; and when alarm was   
taken at an enterprise on their own it was not easy   
to carry them the whole length of the principles   
Which they inioked for themselves. In the firstor   
second session of the legislature after I became

From an early stage of our revolution other anti   
more distant duties were assigned M!), PO that from   
that time, until my return from Europe, in   
1189, and 1 may say, till I returned to re­  
side at home in 1809, I had little opportunity of   
knowing the progress of public sentiment here on   
this subject. I bad always hoped that the young•   
er generation, receiving their early impressions af­  
ter the flames of liberty had been kindled in every   
breast, and had bib:Una, as it were the vital *pint   
of tivety American that the generous temperament   
of youth analogous to the motion of their blood,   
and above, the suggestions of avarice, would bare   
sympathized with oppression wherever found and   
proved their love of liberty beyond their own share   
of it. But my intercourse with them since my   
return has not been sufficient to ascertain that they   
had made-towards this point the progress I had his   
ped. Your solitary but welcome voice is the first   
which has brought this sound to my ear and I have   
considered general silence which prevails on this   
subject asindicating on apathy unfavorable to our   
hopes. Yet the hour of emancipation is advanc­  
ing in the march of time. It will come and   
whether brought on by the genitives energy of our   
own minds or by the bloody process of St. Domin­  
go, excited and conducted by the power of our   
present enemy, if one stationed permanently with­  
in cur country, offering asylum and arms to the op­  
pressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned over.   
As to the method by which this difficult work is   
to be done by ourselves, I have seen no proposition   
so expedient on that whole as that of emancipation   
of those born after e ghee day, mid of their edu­  
cation and expatriation at a proper age. This would   
give time for a gradual extinction of-that species of   
labor, and substitution of another, and lessen the   
saieity 01 the shock which an operation so funda­  
mental connote fall to produce. The idea of eman­  
cipating the whole at melte; the old as well as the   
young,and retaining them here, is of those only who   
have not the amide of either knowledge or exper­  
ience on the subject. For men probably, of any   
color, but of tens Soler, we know, brott,ght up Rom­  
their infancy without necessity;for thought or fore­  
cast, are by their habits rendered as incapable as   
children of taking care of themselves, and are ex­  
tinguished promptly wherever industry is necessa­  
ry for raising the young. In the meantime :they   
are pests in society by their idleness and Oft de­  
predations to which this leads them. Their amal­  
gamation with the other colors produces a degrad­  
ation to which no lover of his country, no lover of   
excellence in the briniep cltaracter, can innocently   
consent.   
I am sensible of the partialities td which you have   
looked towards me as the person who should un­  
dertake the salutary and anlous-work ; but this my   
dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to buckle on the   
armor f Hector &quot;trementibus &#x27;zoo humeri* et inutile   
ferrum tinge.&quot; No. I have overlived the generation   
with which mutual labors and perils begat mutual   
confidence and influence. This enterprise­  
-is for   
the young; forthose who can follow it up to its   
consummation. It shall have my prayers, and   
these ste the only weapons of an old man. But,   
in the mean time, are you right in abandoning this   
property, and your country with it? I think not.—  
My opinion has eV&#x27;er been that, until more can be   
done for them, we should endeavor with those   
whom fortitne has thrOwn on our_ hands to feed   
and clothe them well, protect them front all usage,   
require such resonable labor only as is performed   
voluntarily by freemen, and be led by nti repug­  
nance to abdicate them and our duties to them.—  
The laws do not permit us to turn them and our du­  
ties to them loose, if that were for their good and to   
commute them for other property is to committhem   
to those whose usage of them we cannot conttol.—  
I hope then my dear sir you will reconcile your­  
self to your country and its unfortunate condition ;   
that you will not lessen its stock of sound. disposi­  
tion by -withkmwtrig your portion from the mass;   
that on the contrary, you will borne forward in the   
public councils, become the missionary bf this doc­  
trine, truly christian, insinuate and inculcate it sof­  
ty but steadily through the medium of writing and   
conversation ;associate ethers in your labors and   
when the phalanx is formed,bririg on and   
press the proposition perseveringly until its ac­  
complishment. It is an encouraging observation   
that no good measure tvms ever proposed which if   
daily pursued failed to prevail in the end. We   
have proof of this in the history of eadeavoni in   
the British parliament to suppress that very trade   
which brong-ht this evil on us. And you will be   
supported bythe religous precept, &quot; Be not weary   
in well doWg.&quot; That your success may be as   
speedy and complete as it :will be honorable and   
immortal consolation to yourself,l shall as fervently   
and sincerely pray as I assure you of my great   
fr.ealship and reepect.

• MONTICELLO, August 25,1814.   
DEAR Sot:—Your favor of July 31st   
was &#x27;duly received and was read with.   
peculiar pleasure: The sentiments   
breathed through the whole do honor, to   
both&quot;the iiead anith-eart`of the writer,-..-  
Mine on the subject of the slavtiy of ne­  
groes have tong since been In possession   
of the public; arid time &#x27;has only served   
to-give them stronger:robt. •   
T&amp;, love of &#x27;justice . and the love of   
.country plead equally the cause of these   
people, and it is a mortal reproach to us   
that theyyshoilld have pleaded it so long   
in vain, and shonld have produced not a.   
_single_effora. 4&#x27; I fear, not `much se­  
rious willingness—to relie&#x27;ve them and   
ourselves from our-present cortdition_of   
moral and political reprobation. From   
those of the former generation Tv ho were   
in the fulness of age when I came into   
public life, which was while our contro­  
versy with England was on paper only,   
I. saw that nothing was to be hoped:—  
Nursed and educated in the daily-habit   
of seeing the degraded condition, both   
bodily and mentally of those unfortunate   
beings, not reflecting that that degrada­  
tion was very much the work of them­  
seftres and their fathers, feW minds had   
yet doubted but that they were as legiti­  
mate subjects of property as their horses   
--or cattle.   
• The quiet and monotonous course of   
colonial life had beeh—ditturlied-b3r no   
alarm and little reflection on the value of   
liberty ; and, when alarm was taken at   
an enterprise of their own, it was not   
easy to carry them the whole -length of   
the principles which they invoked for   
themselves. In the first or second ses­  
sion of the Legislature..after I was a   
membar, I.drew to this subject tile atten­  
tion of Colonel Bland, one of the oldest,   
ablest, and most respected_members, and   
be undertook to move for certain mode­  
rate extensions.of the,protection of the   
laws te,,these people. I seconded his   
motion, and, as• a younger member was   
spared more in the debate btit he vjai   
deno}inced as an enemy to his country,   
and was treated with the greatest inde.   
carom:   
  
From an early stage of our&quot; Revolu•   
tion other and more distant duties wore   
assigned me, so that from that time till   
my return from Europe in 1789, and I   
- may say, till I returned to reside at home.   
in 1809,, I . had &#x27;little opportunity of   
knowing the progress of public senti­  
ment here on this subject. I had always   
hoped that the younger generation, re­  
ceiving their early impressions after the   
flame of liberty had been kindled in   
• every breast, and had become its it were   
the vital spirit of every American, that   
the generous temperament of youth, a­  
- nalogous to the motion of their blood,   
and above the suggestions of avarice,   
&#x27;would have sympithized•with oppression   
wherever found, and provedtheir love of   
&#x27; liberty beyond their own share-of it. &#x27;   
Bute my intercourse with them since.   
my return has not been sufficient to as   
certain.that_they had.nrideLtew_ards this   
potni, ihe progress I lia&amp;.hoped. Your   
solitary but welcome voice is the first   
• which has brought this sound to my ear_   
and! have considered the silt;nceilWhich

apathy unfavorable to our hopes. Yet

Munticello, August, 25, 1514.  
Dear Sir: Your favor. of July 31st, was duly  
received, and was read with peculiar pleasure- The  
sediments breathed through the whole do honor to  
the band and heart of the writer. &quot; Mine on the sub­  
ject of the slavery of negroes, have long since been  
in possession of the public, and time has only serv­  
ed to gfve them stronger root  
. Tlje love of justice Hnd the love of country plead  
equally the cause of these people, and it is a mortal  
reproach to us that they should have produced not  
a singla effort nay, 1 fear, not much serious wil­  
lingness to relieve them and ourselves from our  
present condition of moral and political rerobation.  
From those of the former generation, w ho were in  
the fullness of age when I came into public lite,  
which was while our controversy with England was  
on paper only, I soon- saw that nothing was to be  
hoped.- Ifursed and educated in the daily habit of  
seeing the degraded condition, both bodily and men­  
tal, of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting that  
that degradation was very much theworkofthem-  
selves and their fathersj, few minds had yet doubt­  
ed but that they were as legitimate subjects of  
property as their horses or cattle. The qniet and  
monotonous course of ooilonial life had been disturb­  
ed by no alarm Hnd little reflection on the value of  
liberty; and, when alarm was taken at an enter­  
prise of their own, it was not easy to carry them the  
whole length of the principles which they invoked  
for themselves. In the first or second session of  
the Legislature after I became a member, I drew  
to this subject the attention of Colonel Bland, one  
of the oldest, ablesand most respected members,  
and he undertook to move for certain moderate ex­  
tensions of the protection of the laws to these peo­  
ple. &quot;, I seconded his motion, and as a younger  
member, was more spared in the debate; but&#x27; be  
was denounced as an enemy to his country, and  
was treated with the greatest indecorum.  
From an early stage of our Revolution other and  
more distant duties were assigned me, so that from  
that time till my return from Europe in 1789, and,  
I may saj till I returned to reside at home in 1 SOD,  
I had little opportunity of knowing the progress of  
public sentiment here on this subject I had al­  
ways hoped that the younger generation, icceiving  
their early impressions after the flame of liberty had  
been kindled in every breast, and become as it  
Were the vital spirit of every American, that the  
generous temperament of youth analogous to the  
motion of their blood, and above the suggestions of  
avarice, would have sympathized with oppression  
wherever found, and proved their love of liberty  
beyond their own share of it But my intercourse  
with, them since my return has not been sufficient  
to ascertain that they had made towards this point  
the progress I had hoped. Your solitary but wel­  
come voice is the first which has brought this sound  
to my ear, and 1 have considered the general si­  
lence which prevails upon this subject as indicating  
an apathy unfavorable to our hopes. Yet the hour  
of emancipation is advancing in the march of time.  
It will come; and, whether brought on by the  
bloody process of St Doming, excited and conduct­  
ed by the power of our present enemies, if once  
stationed permanently within our country, offering  
asylum and arms to the oppressed, is a loaf of our  
history not yet turned oyer.  
. As to the method by which this difficult work is  
to be effected, if permitted to be done by ourselves,  
I have seen no proposition so expedient; on&#x27;the  
whole, as that of emancipation of thosa born after a  
given day, and of their education and expatriation  
at a proper age. This would give time for a grad­  
ual extinction of that species of labor, and substi­  
tution of another, and lessen the&quot; severity of a shock  
which&#x27; an operation so .fundamental cannot fail to  
produce. The idea of emancipating the whole at  
once, the old as well as the young, and retaining  
them here, is of those only who have n t the guide  
of either knowledge or experience on the subject  
For men, probably of any color, but of this co&#x27;jr we  
know, brought up from their infancy without ne­  
cessity for thought or forecast are by their habits,  
rendered as incapable as children of taking care of  
themselves, and are extinguished promptly wher­  
. ovpr industry is necessary for raising th:? young.-  
In the mean time they are pests in society by their  
idleness, and the depredations to which this leads  
them. &#x27; Their amalgamation with the other color  
produces a degradation to which no lover of his  
country, no lover of euellence in the human char­  
acter, can innocently consent  
I am sensible of the partialities with which you  
liavd looked towards me as the person who should  
undertake this salutary and arduous work  
but this,  
my aear r, w iim oiuutng -vi rnam to duckic On j

gat mutual confidence and influence. This enter  
prise is for the young; for those who can follow it  
up, and bear it through to its consummation. It  
shall have all my prayers, and these are the only­  
weapons of an old man. But, in the mean time,  
are you right in thus abandoning this property, and  
your country with it ? I think not. My opinion  
has ever been tut until more can be done for them,  
we should endeavor with those whom fortune has  
thrown upon our hands, to feed and clothe them  
well, protect them from ill usage, require such  
reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by  
freemen, and be led by no repugnances to abdicate  
them and our duties to them. The laws do not  
permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their  
good, and to commute them for other property is to  
commit them to those whose usa;e of them we can-  
not control. I  
hope, then, my dear sir, you wnl

MoerriCELto, August 25th, 1814.  
DEAR SIK :—Your favor of July 31st  
was duly received and was read with pecu­  
liar pleasure. The sentiments breathed j  
through the whole do honor to both the  
head and heart of the writer. Mine on the j  
subject of the slaver)* of negroes have long  
since been in possession of the public, and  
Line has only served to give them stronger i  
. e o ;  
root.  
The love of justice and the love ofcoun- j  
try plead equally the cause of these people, ;  
and it is a moral reproach to us that they  
should have pleaded it so long in vain, and j  
should have produced not a single effort—  
nay I fear, not much serious willingness ;  
-—to relieve them and ourselves from our &#x27;  
present condition of moral and political ,  
repiobation. From those of tiio former  
generation who were in the fulness of age  
when 1 came into public life, which was ,  
while our controversy with England was  
on paper only, 1 saw nothing was to be  
hoped. Nursed and educated in tha daily  
habit of seeing the degraded condition, both  
bodily and mentally, of those unfortunate  
beings, not reflecting that that degradation !  
was very much the work of themselves  
and their fathers, few minds had yet doubt  
ed but that they weie as legitimate sub  
jects of property as their horses or cattle, j  
The quiet and monotonous courso of  
colonial life had been disturbed by no  
alarm and little reflection on the value of  
liberty ; and, when alarm was taken at an  
enterprise of their own, it wae not easy to  
carry out the whole length of the princi­  
ples which they invoked for themselves.—  
In the first or second session of the Legis­  
&quot;tatnre after I was a member, I drew to ;  
this subject the attention of Colonel Bland,  
one of the oldest, ablest, and most respected  
members, and he undertook to move for ,  
certain moderate extensions of the protec- |  
lion of the laws to these people. I second- j  
ed his motion, and, as a younger member  
was spared more in the debate ;but he was  
denounced as an enemy to his country, and  
was treated with the greatest indecorum, i  
From an early stage of our Revolution  
other and more distant duties were assign­  
ed me, so that from that time till my re­  
turn from Europe in 1789, nnd I mav ssy, &#x27;  
till I returned to reside at home in 1309, I  
hid little opportunity of knowing the pro­  
gress of public sentiment here on this sub­  
ject. 1 had always hoped that the young­  
er generation, receiving their early impres- j  
sions after the flame of liberty had been !  
kiadled in every breast, and had become  
ea it were the vital spirit of every Ameri- i  
can, that the generous temperament of  
youth, analogous to the motion of their  
blood, and above the suggestions of ava- !  
rice, would have sympathised with oppres­  
* eion wherever found, and proved their love  
of liberty beyond their own share of it.  
But rny intercourse with them since mv  
return has not been sufficient to ascertain  
that they had made towards this point the  
progress 1 had hoped. Your solitary but  
welcome voice is the first® which has  
brought this sound to ray ear, and 1 have ,  
considered the silence which prevails on ,  
this subject as indicating an apathy unfa- j  
vorable to our hopes. Yet the hour of  
emancipation is advancing in the march of  
time. It will come ; and, whether brought  
on by the generous energy of our own  
minds or by the bloody process of St. Do­  
mingo, excited and conducted by the power  
of our present enemy, if once stationed &gt;  
permanently within our country, offering  
.isvlum and arms to the oppressed, is a  
leaf of our history not yet turned over.  
As to the method by which this difficult  
work is to be effected, if permitted to lie  
done by ourselves, 1 have seen no proposi­  
tion so expedient on the whole, as that of  
emancipation ot those born after a given  
day, and of tlieir education and expatriation &#x27;•  
at a proper age. This would give time  
lor a gradual extinction of that species of  
labor, and substitution of another, and les- i  
sen the severity of the shock, which an  
operation so fundamental cannot fail to  
produce. The idea of emancipating the  
whole at once, the old as well 33 the young,  
and retaining them here, is of those only  
who have not the guide of either know­  
ledge or experience on this subject.  
For men, probably of any color, but of  
this color we kaow, brought up from their  
lutancy without necessity for thought or  
forecast, are by iheir habits, rendered us  
incapable as ch,,dren of taking care of  
themselves, and are extinguished prompt­  
ly wherever industry is necessary for rais­  
ing the young. In the meantime they arc  
[icsts in society by their idleness, and the  
depredations to which this leads them   
1 hen amalgamation with the other color  
produces a degradation to which 110 lover  
of his country, no lover ,f excellence in the  
human character, can innocently consent.  
1 am sensible of the partialities with  
which you looked toward me as the person  
who should undertake this salutary and ar­  
duous work ; hut this, mv dear sir, is like  
bidding old Priam to buckle on the armor  
of Hector, &#x27;tremi-nlibus ato humeri t et in-  
No. i have over- |  
  
lived the generation with which mutual  
labors and perils begat mutual confidence  
and influence. This enterprise is for the  
young.; for those who can follow it up, and  
i bear 11 through to its consummation. It  
j shall have nil my prayers, and these are the  
only weapons of an old man. But, in the  
meantime are you right in abandoning this  
property and your country with it ? 1  
think not. My opinion has ever been that,  
until more can be done for them, we should  
endeavor with those whom fortune has  
thrown on our hands to feed and clothe  
lueni well, proT&#x27;ct them from ill usage, re­  
quire such reasonable labor only as is per­  
! formed voluntarily by freemen, and be led  
J by no repugnances to abdicate them and  
: our duties to them. The law does not  
permit us to turn them loose, if that were  
for their good, and to commum them for  
! other property is to commit them to those  
1 whose usage to them we cannot control.  
I hope, then, my dear sir, you will re­  
j concile yourself to your country and its  
unfortunate condition ; that you will not  
lessen its stock of disposition by withdraw*  
ing your portion from the mass. That on  
the contiary, you will conte forward in the  
&#x27; public councils, become the missionary of  
this doctrine truly christian, insinuate and  
! inculcate it softly but steadily through the  
medium of writing and conversation ; ns­  
-1 sociato others in your labors, and when  
the phalanx i 9 formed, bring on and press  
! the proposition perseveringly until its ao­  
! complishraent. It is an encouraging ob­  
servation that no good measure was ever  
; proposed which, if daily pursued, failed to  
prevail ir. the end.  
We have proof of this in the history of  
the endeavots in the Ornish Parliament to  
suppress that very trade which brought  
1 this evil upon us. And you will be sup­  
ported by the religious precept—&#x27;Be not  
weary in well doing.&#x27; That your success  
. tnav be as speedy and complete as it will  
be honorable and immortal consolation to  
yourself. I shall as fervently and sincerely  
pray as I assure you of my great friendship  
and respect.

For Ambrose Jones-who drowns his wits,  
And broke his babe&#x27;s arm in one ofhis fits,  
The ugly old imp of sin.  
I dream&#x27;d that the Devil walked boldly in  
And swung his long tail on a chair,  
And asked if you were not a Deacon, he did,  
And (without looking) you said that you were  
The Devil, he laughed, he switched his long tail,  
And he grinned as he nodded to see:  
Says he with a wink, [and the sparks flew like  
hail,]  
That &#x27;ere is the Deacon for me!  
  
IM. JErFEnso..-The following profound  
.views of this distinguished statesman, are well  
Iworthy of attention. Speaking ofschemes of  
emancipation he says.  
As to the method by which this difficult work  
is to be eliected, ifpermitted to be done by our­  
selves, I have seen no proposition so expedient,  
on the whole, as that of emancipation ofthose  
born after a given day, and of their education  
and expatriation at a proper age. This would  
,give time for a gradual extinction of that species  
of labor, and substitution of another, and lessen  
the severity of the shock which an operation so  
fundamental cannot fail to produce. The idea of  
emancipating the whole at once, the old as well  
as the young, and retainging them here, is  
of those only who have not the guide ofeither  
knowledge or experience on the subject. For  
men, probably of any color, but of this color,  
we know, brought up from their infhacy  
without necessity for or thought forecast, are, by  
their habits, rendered as iscapable as children  
of taking care ofthemselves and are extinguish.  
ed promptly wherever industry is necessary for  
raising the young. In the mean time they are  
pests in society by their idleeie, and the dep.1  
amalgamation with the othlr color produces a  
degradation to which no lover efhis country, no  
lover of excellence in humar character, can  
innocently consent. *  
My opinion has ever been that, until more can  
be done for them, we should endeavor with those  
whom fortune has thrown on our hands, tofeed  
and clothe them well, protect them from ill.sags,  
require such reasonable labor only as is perform­  
ed voluntarily by freemen, and be led by no re.  
pugnances to abdicate them and our duties to  
them. &#x27;The laws do not permit us to turn them  
loose, if that were for their Good, and to eom.  
mute them for other property is to commit them  
to those whose usage of thed we conmot cen.

Fonricetto, August 25th, 1814.

The sentiments breathed through the whole do

wil! come; and, whether — on by the gen-  
erous energy of our own minds or by the bioody  
process of St. Domingo, excited and conducted by  
the power of our present enemy, if once stationed  
  
, permanently within our country, offering asylum  
  
and arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history  
not yet turned over.  
  
As te the method by which this difficult work is  
to be effected, if permitted to be done by our-  
selves, I have seen no proposition so expedient, on  
the whole, as that of emancipation of those born  
after a given day, and of their education and ex-  
patriation at a proper age. This would give time  
for a gradual extinction of that species of labor,  
and substitution of another, and lessen the severi-  
ty of the shock which an operation so fandamental  
cannot fail to produce. The idea of emancipati  
the whole at once, the old as well as the young,  
and retaining them here, is of those only who have  
not the guide of either knowledge or experience  
on the subject. For men, probably of any color,  
but of this color we know, brought up from their  
infancy without necessity for thought or for  
are, by their habits, rendered as incapable as chil-  
dren of taking care of themselves, and are extin-  
guished promptly wherever industry is necessary  
for raising the young. In the mean time, they are  
perrsing society by their idleness, and the depre-  
  
to which this leads them. Their amal-  
gamation with the other color produces a degra-

Mo.micello, August 25,&quot;1S14.  
DiCaj: Sin: Your faor of July 31st was duly re­  
ceived, and wus read with particular pleasure. The  
sentiment breathed through tlio whole do honor to  
both the head and heart of the writer. Mine on the  
subject of the slavery of negroes have long since  
been in possession f the public, and time has only  
served to give them stronger root.  
The love of justice and the lave of country plead  
equally the cause of these people, and it is a mortal  
reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so  
l&quot;iig in vain, and should have produced not a single  
effort nay, I fear, not much serious willingness to  
relieve them and ourselves from our present condi­  
tion of moral and political reprobation. From those  
of the former generation who were in the fullness of  
age when I came into public lif which was while  
our controver.-y with England was on paper only, I  
soon saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed and  
educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded  
condition, both bodily aud mental, of these unfortu­  
nate beings, not uflecting that that degradation&quot; was  
very much the work of themselves and their fathers,  
few minds had yet doubted but that they were as le­  
gitimate subjects of properly as their horses or cat­  
tle. The quiet and monotenous course of colonial  
life had been disturbed by no alarm and little reflec­  
tion on the value of liberty ; and, when alarm was  
taken at an enterprise on their own, it was nut easy  
to carry them the whole length of the principles  
which thev invoked for themselves. In the first or  
second session ot the Legislature after I became a  
member, I drew to this ßubiect the ottcntion of Col.  
Eland, one of the oldest, ablest, and most respected  
members, and he undertook to move for certain mo­  
derate extensions of the protection of &#x27;the laws to  
these people. I seconded hia motion, and, as a  
younger member, was more spared in the debate ;  
but he was denounced as an enemy to his country,  
and wa3 treated with the greatest indecorum.  
From an early stage -of our Revolution, other and  
more distant duties were assigned me, fo that horn  
that time till my return from Europe in 1769, and, I  
may say, till I returned to reside at home in lSU&#x27;J, .  
had little opportunity of knowing the progress o  
public sentiment here on this subject. I had always  
hoped that the younger ceneration, receiving their  
early impressions after the flames of liberty had been  
kindled in every breast, and had become as it were  
the vital spirit of every American, and the generous  
temperament of youth, analogous to the motion &quot;of  
their blood, and above the suggestions ot uvance,  
would have sympathized with oppression wherever  
found, and proved their love of liberty beyond their  
own 6hare of it. But my intercourse with them since  
my return has not been sufficient to ascertain that  
thoy had made towards this point the progress I had  
hoped. Your solitary but welcome voice is the first  
which has brought this sound to my ear, af.d I have  
considered the general silence v.&#x27;hicii prevails on this  
subject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to our  
hopes. Yet the hour of Emancipation is advancing  
in the march of Time It will come; and; whether  
brought on by the generous energy of our own minis  
or by the bloody process of St. Domingo, excited ni.d  
conducted by the power of our present enemy; if once  
EtaMoned permanently within our country, oering an  
asylum and arms to the oppressed, is a leaf ot our  
history not yet turned over.  
As to the method by which this difficult work i to  
be effected, if permitted to bo done by ourselves, 1  
have seen no proposition so expedient, on the&#x27; whole,  
as that of emancipation of those born -utter a given  
day, and of their education and expatriation at i  
proper age. This would give time for a gradual ex  
tinction of that species of labor, and substitution of  
another, and lessen the seventy or tue shock which  
an operation so fundamental cannot fail to produce  
The idea of emancipating the whole at once, the old  
as well as the young, and retaining them here, is of  
thote only who have not the guide of either know  
ledge or experience on the subject. For men, pro­  
bably of any color, but of this color &quot;we know,  
brought up from their infancy without necessity for  
thought or forecast, arc, by their habits, rendered as  
incapable as children of taking care f themselves,  
and are extinguished promptly wherever industry is  
necessary for raising the young. In the mean time,  
they are pets in society by their idleness, and the ce  
predations to which this leads them. Their amalga  
mation with the other color produces a degradation  
to which no lover of his country, no lover of excel  
lence in the human character, can innocently con  
6ent.  
I am sensiblo of the partialities with which you  
have hioked towards me, as the person wh3 should  
untertake this salutary and arduous work; but this  
my dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to buckle on  
the armor of Hector, ttrtmentibus cbvo Jiumeris et  
inutile ferrum cinni.&quot; No. I have over-lived the  
generation with which mutual labors and perils be  
gat mutual confidence and influence. This enter  
prise is fr the young for those who can follow it  
up. and bear it through to iu consummation. It  
shall have all my prayers, and these are the only  
weapons of an old man. But, in the mean time, are  
you right in abandoning this property, and your  
country with it ! I think not. My opinion has ever  
been, that, until more can be done for them, we  
should endeavor, with whom fortune has thrown on  
our hands, to foed and clothe them well, protect them  
from ill-usage, require such reasonable labor only as  
is performed voluntarily by freemen, and be led by no  
repugnances to abdicate them and our duties to them  
The Taws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that  
were for their good, and to commute them for other  
property is to commit them to those whose usage of  
them we cannot control. I hope, then, my dear sir  
you will reconcile yourself to your country and its  
unfortunate condition ; that you will not lessen its  
stock of sound disposition by withdrawing your por  
lion from the mass. That, on the contrary, you wil  
come forward in the public councils, become the mis  
sionary of this doctrine truly Christian, insinuate and  
inculcate it sottly but steadily through the medium o  
wntiner and conversation; associate others in your.  
labors, and, when the phalanx is farmed, bring on  
and press the proposition persevcringly until its ac  
complishtnent. It is an encouraging observation, that  
no pood measure was ever proposed which, if daily  
pursued, failed to prevail in the end. We have proof  
of litis iu the history of the endeavors in the british  
Parliament to Fuppress that very trade which brough  
this evil on us. And you will be supported by the  
religious precept, &quot;Be not weary in well-doir.g.&quot;  
That your success may be as speedy and complete as  
it will be honorable and immortal consolation to your­  
self, 1 shall as fervently and sincerely pray as I as­

Monricello, August 25, 1814.  
DeAR SiR: Your favor of July Af was duly re  
ceived, and was rend with peculiar pleasure. The  
sentiments breathed through the whole do honor to  
both the bead and heart of the writer. Mine on the  
subject of the Slavery of negroes have long since  
been in possession of the public, and time has only  
served to give them stronger root.  
The love of justice and the love of country plead  
equally the cause of these people, and it is a mortal  
reproach to us that they should hare pleaded it so  
long in vain, and should have produced not a single  
effort--nay, I fear, not much serious willingness--to  
relieve them and ourselves from our present condition  
of moral and political reprobation. From those of  
the former generation who were in the fullness of age  
when I came into public life, which was while our  
controvers; with Ergland was on paper only, I soon  
saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed and edu­  
cated in the dally habit of seeing the degraded cone­  
dition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortunate  
beings, not reflecting that that degration was very  
much the work of themselves and their fathers, few  
mirds had yet doubted but that they were as legiti  
ibjects of property as their horses or cattle,  
The quict and menetonous course of colonial life had  
been disturbed by no alarm and little reflection on the  
value of liberty; and when alarm was taken at an  
enterprise on their own, it was not easy to carry them  
the whole length of the principles which they invoked  
for themselves. In the first or second session of the­  
Legislature after I became a member, I drew to this  
subject the attention of Col. Bland, one of the oldest,  
ablest and mest respected members, and he undertook  
to move for certain moderate extensions of the pro­  
tection of the laws to these people. I seconded his  
motion, and, as a younger member, was more spared  
in the debate; but he was denounced as an enemy to  
his country, and was treated with the greatest inde­  
corum  
From an early stage of our Revolution, other and  
more distant duties were assigned me, so that from  
that time till my return from Europe in 1789, and, I  
may say, till I returned to reside at home in 1809, I  
I had little opportunity of knowing the progress of  
public sentiment here on this subject. I had always  
soped that the youngtr generation, receiving their  
carly impressions after the flame of liberty had been  
kindled in every breast, and had become as it were  
the vital spirit of every American, that the generous­  
temperament of youth, analogous to the motion of  
their blood, and above the suggestions of avarice.  
would have sympathized with oppression wherever  
feind, and prove their love of liberty beyond their  
own share of it. But my intercourse with them since  
my return has not been sufficient to ascertain that  
they had made toward this point the progress I had  
hoped. Your solitary but welcome voice is the first  
which has brought this sound to my ear, and I have  
considered the general silence which prevatls on this  
gubject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to our  
hopes. Yet the hour of emancipation is advancing in  
the march of time. It will come; and, whether  
brought on by the generous energy of our own minds  
or by the bloody process of St. Domingo excited and  
ted by the power of our present enemy, if  
once stationed permanently within our country, offer­  
ing asy lum and arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our  
own histery, and not yet turned over.  
As to the method by which this difficult work is to  
be effected, if permitted to be done by ourselves, I  
have seen no proposition so expedient, on the whole,  
as that of emancipation of those born after a given  
day, and of their education and expatriation at a  
proper age. This would give time for a gradual ex.­  
tinction of that speefts of labor, and substitution of  
another, and lessen the severity of the shock which  
an operation so fundamental cannot fail to produce.  
The idea of emancipating the whole at once, the old  
as well as the young, and retaining them here, is of  
those only who have not the guide of either knowl  
edge or experience on the subject. For men prob  
ably of any color, but of this color we know, brought  
up from their infancy without necessity for thought  
or forecast, are, by their habits, rendered as incapa­  
ble as children of taking care of themselves, and are  
extinguished promptly wherever industry is necessary  
for raising the young. In the meantime they are  
pests in society by their idleness and the depredations  
to which this leads them. Their amalgamation with  
the other color produces a degradation to which no  
lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the  
human character, can innocently consent.  
I am sensible of the partialities with which you have  
looked toward me as the person who should under-­  
take this salutary and arduous work; but this, my  
dear sir is like bidding old Priam to buckle on the  
armor of Hector, &quot;Trementibus wro humeris et inutile  
ferrum cingt.&quot; No. I have overlived the generation  
with which mutual labors and perils begat mutual  
confidence and influence. This enterprise is for the  
young; for those who can follow it up, and bear it  
through to its consummation. It shall have all my  
prayers, and these are the only weapons of an old  
mnan. But, in the mean time, are you right in aban­  
doning this property, and your country with it? I  
think not. My opinion has ever been that, until more  
can be done for them, we should endeavor with those  
whom fortune has thrown in our hands to feed and  
clothe them well, protect them from ill usage, require  
such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily  
by freemen, and be led by no repugnances to abdi.­  
cate them and our duties to them. The laws do not  
permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their  
good, and to commute them for other property is to  
commit them to those whose usage of thein we can-­  
not control. I hope, then, my dear sir, you will recon-­  
cile yourself to your country and its unfortunate con  
dition; that you will not lessen its stock of sound dis-­  
position by withdrawing your portion from the mass.  
That on the contrary you will come forward in the  
public councils, become the missionary of this doctrine  
iruly christian, insinuate and inculcate it softly but  
steadily through the medium of writing and conver.  
sation; associate others in your labors, and, when the  
phalata is formed, bring on and press the proposition  
perseveringly until its accomplishment. It is an en  
couraging obeervation that no good measure was ever  
proposee which, if daily pursued, failed to prevall in  
the end. We have proof of this in the history of the  
endeavors in the British Parliament to suppress that  
very trade which brought this evil on us. And you  
will be supported by the religious precept, &quot;Be not  
&quot;weary in well doing. That your success may be  
as speedy and complete as it will be honorable and  
immortal consolation to yourself, I shall as fervently  
and sincerely pray as I aseure you of my great friend.­  
stip and respect.Thonas dETrersON

Or.  
MoxTicELlo, Aug. 25,-14.  
Dear Sir:--Your favor of July 31, was  
duly received, and was read with peculiar  
pleasure. The sentiments breathed through  
the whole do honor to both the head and  
heart of the writer. Mine, on the subject  
of the slavery of negroes having long since  
been in possession of the public, and time  
has only served to give them stronger root.  
The love of justice and the love of country  
plead equally the cause of these people, and  
it is a mortal reproach to us that they should  
have pleaded it so long in vain, and should  
have produced not a single effort, nay I  
fear not much serious willingness to relieve  
them and ourselves from our present condi­  
tion of moral and political reprobation.  
From those of a former generation, who were  
in the fullness of age when I came into pub­  
lic life, which was while our controversy  
with England was on paper only, I soon saw  
that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed and  
educated in the daily habit of seeing the de  
graded condition, both bodily and mental.  
of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting  
that that degredation was very much the  
work of themselves and their fathers, few  
minds had yet doubted but that they were  
as legitimate subjects of property as their  
  
horses or cattle. The quiet and monotonous  
course of colonial life had been disturbed by  
no alarm, and little reflection on the value  
of liberty; and when alarm was taken at an  
enterprise on their own, it was not easy to  
carry them the whole length of the princi­  
ples which they invoked for themselves. In  
the first or second session of the Legislature,  
after I became a member, I drew to this  
subject the attention of Col. Bland, one of  
the oldest, ablest, and most respected mem­  
bers, and he undertook to move for certain  
moderate extensions of the laws to these  
people. I seconded his motion, and, as a  
younger member, was more spared in the  
debate; but he was denounced as an enemy  
to his country, and was treated with the  
grossest indecorum. From an early stage  
of our revolution, other and more distant  
duties were assigned me, so that from that  
time till my return from Europe in 1789, and  
I may say, till I returned to reside at home  
in 1809, I had little opportunity of knowing  
the progress of public sentiment here, on  
this subject. I had always hoped that the  
younger generation, receiving their early im­  
pressions after the flame of liberty had been  
kindled in every breast, and had become, as  
it were the vital spirit of every American,  
that the generous temperament of youth  
analogous to the motion of their blood, and  
above the suggestions of avarice, would have  
sympathized with oppression wherever  
found, and proved their love of liberty be-  
yond their own share of it. But my inter­  
course with them, since my return, has not  
been sufficient to ascertain that they had  
  
made towards this point the progress I had  
hoped. Your solitary but welcome veice is  
the first which has brought the sound to my  
ear; and I have considered the general sis  
lence which prevails on this subject as indi­  
cating an apathy unfavorable to every hope,  
Yer the nour of eMancIatIon is advancin  
In The EarCH or tHe. Ir will cone; and,  
whether brought on by the generous energy  
of our minds, or by the bloody process of St.  
Domingo, excited and conducted by the pow­  
er of our present enemy, if once stationed  
permanently within our country and offering  
asylum and arms to the oppressor, is a leaf  
of our history not yet turned over.  
As to the method by which this difficult  
work is to be effected, if permitted to be  
done by ourselves, I have seen no proposi­  
tion so expedient on the whole, as that of  
emancipation of those born after a certain  
day, and of their education and expatriation  
at a proper age. This would give time for a  
gradual extinction of that species of labor  
and substitution of another, and lessen the  
severity of the shock which an operation so  
fundamental cannotfail to produce. The idea  
of emancipating the whole at once, the old as  
well as the young, and retaining them here,  
is of those only who have not the guide of  
either knowledge or experience of the sub­  
ject. For men, probably of any color, but  
of this color we know, brought up from in­  
lancy without necessity, forethought or fore­  
cast are by their habits rendered as incapa­  
ble as children of taking care of themselves,  
and are extinguished promptly whenever in­  
dustry is necessary for raising the young.  
  
In the meantime they are pests in society  
by their idleness and the depredations to  
which this leads them. Then amalgamation  
with the other color produces a dogradation  
to which no lover of his country--no lover  
of excellence in the human character can in­  
nocently consent.  
I am sensible of the partialities with which  
you have looked towards me, as the person  
who should undertake this salutary but ar­  
duous work. But this, my dear sir, is like  
bidding old Priam to buckle the armor of  
Hector &quot;trementibus acvo humeris et inutile  
ferrum cingi.&quot; No. I have overlived the  
generation with which mutual labors and  
perils begot mutual confidence and influence.  
This enterprise is for the young; for those  
who can follow it up and bear it through,

ers, and these are the only weapons of an

of sound disposition by withdrawing your

“¢ Dear Sir :—Your favour of pe 31 was  
duly received, and was read with peculiar plea-  
sure. The sentiments, breathed through the  
whole, do honour to both the head and heart of  
the writer. Mine on the subject of the Slavery

a mortal reproach to us that they should have  
pleaded it so long in vain, and should have pro-  
duced not a single effort—nay, I fear, not much  
serious willingness—to relieve them and our-  
selves from our present condition of moral and  
political reprobation. From those of the former  
  
generation who were in the falness of age when  
T came into public life—which was while our  
controversy with England was on paper only—I

soon saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed  
and educated in the daily habit of seeing the de-  
graded condition, both bodily and mental, of  
those unfortunate beings, not reflecting that that  
  
adation was very much the work of them-  
selves and their fathers, few minds had yet  
doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects  
of property as their horses or cattle. The quiet  
and monotonous course of coloniallife had been  
disturbed by no alarm and little reflection on the  
value of liberty ; and when alarm was taken at  
an enterprise on their own, it was not easy to  
carry them the whole length of the principles  
which they invoked for themselves. In the first  
or second session of the Legislature after | be=  
came a member, I drew to this subject the atten-  
tion of Colonel Bland, one of the oldest, ablest,  
and most respected members, and he undertook  
to move for certain moderate extensions of the  
protection of the laws to these people. I se-  
conded his motion, and, as a younger member,  
was more spared in the debate; but he was de-  
nounced as an enemy to his country, and was  
treated with the greatest indecorum.  
  
** From.an early stage of our Revolution, other  
and more distant duties were assigned me, so  
that from that time till my return from Europe  
in 1789, and, I may say, till I returned to re-  
side at home in 1809, I had little opportunity of  
knowing the preagyes of public sentiment here  
on. this subject. had always hoped that the  
generation, receiving their early im-  
pressions after the flame of liberty had been kin-  
dled in every breast, and had become, as it were,  
the vital spirit of every American, that the ge-  
nerous temperament of youth, analogous to the  
motion of their blood, and above the suggestions  
of avarice, would have sympathized with oppres-  
sion wherever found, and proved their love of li-  
berty beyond their own share of it. But my in-  
tercourse with them since my return has not  
been oe to ——s that S Eihasibeaed  
toward this point the progress ad hoped.  
Your solitary but welcome voice is the first  
which has brought this sound to my ear, and I  
have waite the general silence whieh pre-  
vails on this subject as indicating an apathy un-  
favourable to our hopes. Yet the hour of eman-  
cipation is advancing in the march of time. It  
will come ; and, whether brought on by the ge-  
nerous energy ofour own minds, or by the bloody  
process of St. Domingo, excited and conducted by  
the power of our present enemy, if once stationed  
permanently within our country, offering asylum  
and arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our own  
history, and not yet turned over.’

Momticello, Aug, 23, 1311.  
I)e\p. sip.: V ur favor of July 31st was  
duly received and read with peculiar pleas­  
ure. T..e sentiments breathed through the  
whole do honor both to the head and heart of  
the writer. Mine, on the subject of slavery  
ot negroes, have long since been in pose-sion  
of the public, and lime has only served to  
give them stronger proof. The love of jus­  
tice and the love of country plead equally in  
the c iuse of these people, and it is a mortal  
reproach to us that they should have pleaded  
so long in vain, and should have produced  
not a single effort, nay, I fear not much seti­  
ous willingness, to r dieve them and ourselves  
from our present condition of moral and po­  
litical reprobation. A  
thorn these in a fonFer generation, who  
were in the fullness of age tv „ 1 oomo into  
public life, which was while our controversy  
with England was on paper inly, I soon saw  
that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed and  
educated in the da.ly habit of seeing the de­  
graded condition, both bodi y and mental,  
of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting  
that the degredation was very much tiie work  
of themselves and their fathers, few minds  
had yet doubled but that trey were legitimate  
subjects of property as their horses or cattle.  
The quiet and monotonous course of colonial  
life had been disturbed by no alarm, and lit­  
tle reflection on the value of liberty. And  
when the alarm was taken at an enterprise  
ot their own, it was not tm.y to carry them  
the whole length of the principles w hich they  
invoked for themselves.  
  
In ilie first or second session of the [leg­  
islature, after i became a member. 1 drew to  
tins subject the atteati n of (-&#x27;&lt;&gt;l. Miami, one  
ot tne oldest, ablest and most re-pected mem­  
bers, and he undertook to move for certain  
moderate extensions of toe proiection of the  
laws to these people. I seconed his motion  
and, as a young member, was more spared  
in the debate ; but he was and nouuced as an  
enemy to his country, and was treated with  
the greatest indecorum. From an early stage  
of our revolution, other and more distant  
duties were assigned to me, so that from  
that l,mo till my return tr-iji Kurope in 17&#x27;U,  
ami I may say till 1 returned to re-ido at  
home in 18 &gt;;), 1 had little opportunity of  
knowing the progress of public -i aliment  
here on this subject  
I bad alwaj  
ration, recent tig their early impressions after  
the flame ol liberty hail been kindled in every  
breast, and bad become, as it were, the vital  
spirit ot every American, that- i I.e generous  
temperament of youth, analagims lo the moliou  
ot their blood, and above the suggestions of av­  
arice, would liave svmpathu u with the oppres­  
sed. j wherever found, and piorcd tbeir l&lt;we ol  
llierly beyond their own share of it. Hut n.v  
intercourse with them, since my return has  
not been sufficient to ascertain that thev have  
made towards this point the progress ! had  
hoped  
\ our solitary but welcome voice is the first  
which lias brought this sound to mv ear; anti  
1 have considered the general silence which  
prevails mi ibis subject, as indicating an apa­  
thy unfavorable lo every hope. el liie hour  
ot emancipation is advancing in the march of  
time. It vui come; and whether brought on  
by the generous energy ot our own minds, or  
by iht  
and conducted by the power of our present  
enemy, it once stationed iu our count re, and  
offering a-sy lum and ar;;is to iht* t. pn ,et!, is a  
leaf ol our history not yet : ■... 1 over.  
As to the method by which- this difficult  
work is to be educ ed, it peiiaffted to be done  
by ourselves. 1 have seen no j reposition so ex­  
pedient, **a tbe w.t .. as tiiai ci emaaci .latio-i

ing them here, is ol those, only who have not

MONTICELLO, August 25, 1814.   
DEAR Sin : Your favor of July slat was duly re­  
ceived; and was read with peculiar pleasure. The   
sentiments breathed through the whole do honor to   
both the head and heart of the writer. Mine on the   
subject of the slavery of negroes have long since been   
in the possession of the public, and time, has only   
served to give them stronger root. The love of jus­  
tice and the love of country plead equally the cause of   
these people, and it is a mortal reproach to us that they   
should have pleaded it so long in vain, and should have   
produced not a single eject, nay, I fear,- not much seri­  
ous willingness to relieve them and ourselves from our   
present condition of moral and political reprobation.   
From those of the former generation who were in the   
fullness of age when I came into public life, (which   
was while our controversy with England was on pa­  
per only,)I saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed   
and educated in the daily habit of seeinthe,degraded   
condition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortu­  
nate beings, but reflecting that that degradation was   
very much the Work of themselves and their fathers,   
few minds had yet doubted but that they were as le­  
gitimate subjects of property as their horses or cat­  
tle. The quiet and monotonous course of colonial   
life had been disturbed by no alarm, and little reflec­  
tion on the value of liberty. And when alarm was   
taken at an enterprise of their own, it was not easy to   
carry them the whole length of the principles which they ,   
had invoked for themselves. In the first or second sea­  
sion&#x27;of the Legislature, after I became a member, I   
drew to this subject the attention of Colonel Bland,   
one of the oldest, ablest, and most respected mem­  
bers, and he undertook to move for certain moderate   
extensions of the laws of the people. I seconded his   
motion, and as a younger member was no more spared   
In the debate ; but he was denounced as an enemy to his   
country and was treated with the greateit indecorum. From   
an early stage of our revolution other and:more die­  
tent duties were assigned to me, so that from that   
time till my return from Europe in 1789, and I may   
say till I returned to reside at home, in 1809 I had   
little opportunity of knowing the progress of public   
sentiment here on this subject. I had always hoped   
that the younger generation, receiving their; early   
imprensions after the flame of liberty had been kin­  
dled in every breast, and had become as it were the   
vital spirit of every American, that the, generous   
temperament of youth, analogous to the motion of   
their blood, and above the suggestions of avarice,   
would have sympathized with Oppyession wherever   
found, and would have proved `their lore of liberty   
beyond their own share of it. But my intercourse   
with them since my return has not been sufficient   
to ,ascertain .that they made towards this:point the   
progress I had hoped. Your solitary but wet.   
come. voice is the first which has brought this   
Sound -to rtiY eau, and I have considered the general   
eilence which prevails on this subject, as indicating   
an anathvurdavorable to hope. Yet the hour   
of emancipation is advaridifig in the march of time.   
.It will come; and whether brought on the generous   
energy of our minds, or by the bloody process of Str   
Zoit ingo; excited and conducted by the power of our   
present enemy, if once stationed permanently within   
our country, offering asylum and arms to the op­  
pressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned over. As   
to the method by which this difficult work is to be   
effected, if permitted to be done liy_ourselvee, I have   
seen no proposition so expedient, on theiwholef AS that of   
emancipation •of those born after a given- dam, and of   
their education and expatriation at a proper age. This   
would give time for &#x27;the gradual. extinction of that   
species of labor and substitution_ of another, and   
lessen &quot;the severity of the shock which an operation   
so fundamental would produce.: The- idea of eman­  
cipating the whole at once, the old as well as the   
- young, and retaining them here, is of those only who   
have not the guide either of knowledge or experience   
of the Subject. For men, probably of any color, but   
of this color we know, brought up from their infancy   
without necessity for thought or forecast, are by their   
habits rendered a s incapable as children of taking care   
of themselves, and, are extinguished promptly wher­  
ever industry is necessary for raising the young. In   
the meantime they are pests in society by their idle­  
ness and depredations to which this leads them.   
Their amalgamation with the other color produces a   
degradation. to which .no lover_ of country,   
no lover of excellence in human character can   
innocently consent. lam sensible Of the partiali­  
ties with which you have looked towards me as   
the person who should undertake this salutary but   
arduous work. But this, my dear sir, is, like bid.   
ding, old Priam to buckle the armor, of Hector,   
&quot; trementibus aevo humeris et inutile Jarman eregere.&quot;   
No I have outlived the generation with which   
mutual labors and perils begat mutual influence and   
confidence. Thls.enterprise is for the young ; for   
those who can follow it up, and bear it through its   
consummation. It shall have all my prayers, and   
these are the only weapons of an old man. ut in   
the meantime are you right in abandoning this pro­  
perty and your country with it 1 I think not. My   
opinion has ever been&#x27; that, until more can be done   
for them, we should endeavor with those whom for­  
tune has thrown on our hands, to feed and clothe   
them well, protect them from ill-usage, require such   
reasonable labor as is performed voluntarily by free­  
men; and be led by no repugnances to abdicate them   
and our duties to them. The laws do not permit us   
to&#x27; turn them loose, if that were kir their . good, and   
to commute them for other property is to commit   
them to those whose usage we cannot &#x27;control.   
I hope, then, you will, my&#x27; dear air, reconcile.your­  
self   
_to your country and its unfortunate condition ;   
that you will not lessen its stock of sound disposi­  
,tion by withdrawing your portion from the mass ;   
that, on the contrary, you, come forward in the   
public &#x27;councils; become the missionary of this doc­  
trine, truly Christian; insinuate and inculcate it   
softly, but steadily, through the medium of writing   
and conversation; associate others in your labors,   
and:wheri the phalanx is formed, bring:on and press­  
the proposition perseveringly until its accomplish­  
ment.&#x27; It is an encouraging observation that no   
good measure was ever proposed which, if duly   
pursued, failed to_prevail in the end. - We have proof   
of this in the history of the endeavors in the British   
Parliament to suppress the very trade which brought   
the evil upon us. And you will be supported by   
the religious precept, &quot;Be not weary in well doing.&quot;   
That your success may be as speedy and complete   
as it will be honorable and immortal-consolation to   
yourself, I shall as fervently and sincerely pray, as I   
aesuresolia.,any great friendship and respect.

Monticello, August 15, 1814.  
Dear Sib:  
Your favor of July 3lst was duly re­  
ceived, and was read with peculiar pleasure.  
The sentiments bieathed throughout the  
whole do honor to both the h3d aud heart  
of the writer. Miae oa the subject of the  
slavery of negroes have long since been in  
the possession of the public, and time has  
only served to give them stronger root.  
Tbe love of justice and the love of country  
plead equally the cause of these people,  
and it is a moral reproach to us that they  
should have pleaded so long? in vain, and  
should have produced not a single effect,  
nay, I fear, not much serious willingness to  
relieve them and ourselves from our present  
condition of moral and political reproba­  
tion.From those of the former generation who  
were in the fullness of age when I came  
into public life, which was while our contro­  
versy with England was on paper only, I  
saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed

degraded condition, both bodily aad mental,  
of those unfortunate beings, but reflecting  
that that degradation was very much the  
work of themselves and their fathers, few  
minds hsd yet doubted but that they were  
as legitimate subjects of property as their  
horses or cattle. The quiet and monotonous  
course of colonial li e had been disturbed by  
no alarm, and little reflection on tbe value  
of liberty. And when alarm was taken at  
an enterprise of their own, it was not easy  
to carrv them the whole length of the prin­  
ciples which they had invoked for them­  
selves. In tbe first or second session of the  
Legislature, alter I became a member. I  
drew to this subject the a tention of Colonel

of St. Domingo, excited and conducted by  
the power of our present enemy, if once sta-

fer asylum and arms to tbe oppressed, t a  
leaf of our history not yet turned over. As  
to tbe method by which the difficult work  
is to be effected, if permitted to be done  
by ourselves, have set no proposition  
so expedient, on the whole, as that of eman­  
cipation of those bom after m given day. and  
of their education and exportation at a  
prope age. this would give time for the  
gradual extinction of that, species of labor,  
substitution of another, and lessen the se­  
verity of the shock which an operation so  
fundamental would produce. The idea of  
emancipating the whole at once, the old as  
well as tbe young, and retaining them here,  
is of those only who have not the guide ei  
ther of knowledge or experience of the sub­  
ject. For men, probably of any color, but  
of this color we know, brought up from in­  
fancy without necessity for thought or fore­  
cast, are by their habits rendered as incapa­  
ble as children of taking care of themselves.  
In the meantime they are pests in society  
by their idleness and depradations to which  
this leads them. Their amalgamation with  
the other color produces e degradation to  
rhich no lover of hi-, country, no lover of  
excellence in human character, can inno­  
cently consent. I am sensible of the par­  
tialities with which you have looked toward  
me as the person who should undertake this

meri et inutile ferrum eregere.&quot; No, I have j  
outlived the generation with whioh mutual  
labors and perils beget mutual influence  
ana continence, inis enterprise is lor tue  
young; ior i nose wno can ioiiow it up, ana  
bear it through to its consu nmation. It shall  
have all my prayers, and these are the only  
weapons of an old man. But in the mean­  
time are you right in abandoning this prop­  
erty and your oountrv with it? 1 chink not.  
My opinion has ever been that, until mora  
can be done for them, we should endeavor &#x27;  
with thoe whom fortune has thrown on our ,  
bands, to feed aad clothe theot wall. P&quot;tfM  
them from ill usage, require such reasonable ,  
labor as is performed voluntarily by freemen  
and be led by no repugnances to abdicate  
tbam or our duties to them. The laws do  
not permit us to turn them loose, if it were  
for their good, and to commute them for  
other property is to commit ihem to whose  
usae we cannot control.  
I hope, then, you will, my dear sir, rec  
oncile yourself to your country and its uu-  
  
fortunate condition; that y.u will not lessen . whf,reby the sympathizers with treason

“ Your favor of July 21st was duly received, and was read with peculiar pleasure.  
The sentiments breathed through the whole do honor both to the head and heart of the  
writer. The love of justice and the love of country plead equally the cause  
of these people, and it is a mortal reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so  
long in vain, and should have produced not a single effort—nay, I fear not much seri-  
ous willingness,—to relieve them and ourselves from our present condition of moral  
and political reprobation, Your solitary but welcome voice is the first which  
has brought this sound to my ear, and I have considered the general silence which  
prevails on this subject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to every hope. ie

From those of a former generation, who were in the fullness of  
age when I came into public life, I soon learned that nothing  
was to be hoped. Nursed and educated in the daily habit of  
seeing the degraded condition, both bodily and mental, of those  
unfortunate beings, not reflecting that that degradation was  
very much the work of themselves and their fathers, few had  
yet doubted that they were as legitimate subjects of property as  
their horses or cattle. The quiet and monotonous course of colo-  
nial life had been disturbed by no alarm and little reflection on  
the value of liberty, and when alarm was taken at an enterprise of  
their own it was not easy to carry them the whole length of the  
principles which they invoked for themselves. In the first or  
dibecid session of the Legislature, after I became a member, I  
drew to this subject the attention of Col. Bland, one of the  
oldest, ablest, and most respectable members, and he undertook  
to move for certain moderate extensions of the protection of the  
laws for these people. I seconded his motion, and, as a younger  
member, was more spared in the debate ; but he was denounced  
as an enemy to his country and was treated with the greatest  
indecorum.*  
  
The discussion went on, hot and fierce, in all the colonies,  
and ended in the long Revolutionary War, which brought inde-  
pendence and liberty of action. In the meantime, many Ne-
