r,  
Department of State April 12th 1805  
The papers herewith inclosed explain particularly the case of the Brig Aurora.  
The sum of the case is, that whilst Spain was at War with Great Britain, this vessel, owned by a citizen of the United States, brought a cargo of Spanish produce purchased at the Havana, from that place to Charleston, where the cargo was landed, except an insignificant portion of it, and the duties paid or secured according to law, in like manner as they are required to be paid or secured, on a like cargo from whatever port, meant for home consumption; that the cargo remained on land about three weeks when it was reshipped for Barcelona in Old Spain, and the duties drawn back, with a deduction of three and a half ⅌Cent as is permitted to imported articles in all cases, at any time within one year under certain regulations which were pursued in this case; that the vessel was taken on her voyage by a British cruizer and sent for trial to Newfoundland where the cargo was condemned by the Court of Vice Admiralty; and that the cause was carried thence by appeal to Great Britain where it was apprehended that the sentence below would not be reversed.  
  
The ground of this sentence was, and that of its confirmation if such be the result, must be, that the trade in which the vessel was engaged was unlawful, and this unlawfulness must rest, first on the general principle assumed by Great Britain, that a trade from a Colony to its parent Country, being a trade not permitted to other nations in time of peace, cannot be made lawful to them in time of war; Secondly, on the allegation that the continuity of the voyage from the Havana to Barcelona was not broken by landing the cargo in the United States paying the duties thereon and thus fulfilling the legal pre-requisites to a home consumption, and therefore that the cargo was subject to condemnation, even under the British regulation of Jany 1798 which so far relaxes the general principle as to allow a direct trade between a belligerent Colony and a neutral Country carrying on such a trade.  
With respect to the general principle which disallows to neutral nations in time of War, a trade not allowed to them in time of peace, it may be observed;  
First, that the principle is of modern date, that it is maintained, as is believed by no other nation but Great Britain; and that it was assumed by her under the auspices of a maritime ascendency, which rendered such a principle subservient to her particular interest. The History of her regulations on this subject shews that they have been constantly modified under the influence of that consideration. The course of these modifications will be seen in an appendix to the 4th vol of Robinsons Admiralty Reports.  
Secondly, that the principle is manifestly contrary to the general interest of commercial Nations, as well as to the law of Nations settled by the most approved authorities, which recognizes no restraints on the trade of nations not at war, with nations at War, other than that it shall be impartial between the latter, that it shall not extend to certain military articles, nor to the transportation of persons in military service, nor to places actually blockaded or besieged.  
Thirdly, that the principle is the more contrary to reason and to right, inasmuch as the admission of neutrals into a Colonial Trade shut against them in times of peace, may, and often does result from considerations which open to neutrals direct channels of trade with the parent state shut to them, in times of peace, the legality of which latter relaxation is not known to have been contested; and inasmuch as a commerce may be, and frequently is opened in time of war, between a Colony and other Countries, from considerations which are not incident to the war, and which would produce the same effect in a time of peace; such, for example as a failure or diminution of the ordinary sources of necessary supplies, or new turns in the course of profitable interchanges.  
Fourthly, That it is not only contrary to the principles and practice of other Nations; but to the practice of Great Britain herself. It is well known to be her invariable practice in time of war, by relaxations in her navigation laws, to admit neutrals to trade in channels forbidden to them in times of peace; and particularly to open her Colonial trade both to Neutral vessels and supplies, to which it is shut in times of peace; and that one at least of her objects, in these relaxations is to give to her trade an immunity from capture, to which in her own hands it would be subjected by the war.  
Fifthly, the practice, which has prevailed in the British dominions, sanctioned by orders of Council and an Act of Parliament (39 G.3 C.98) authorizing for British subjects a direct trade with the enemy, still further diminishes the force of her pretensions for depriving us of the Colonial trade. Thus we see in Robinson’s Admiralty reports passim, that during the last War a licenced Commercial intercourse prevailed between Great Britain and her enemies, France, Spain &amp; Holland, because it comprehended articles necessary for her manufactures and agriculture, notwithstanding the effect it had in opening a vent to the surplus productions of the others. In this manner she assumes to suspend the war itself as to particular objects of trade beneficial to herself, whilst she denies the right of the other belligerents to suspend their accustomed commercial restrictions in favour of Neutrals. But the injustice and inconsistency of her attempt to press a strict rule on neutrals is more forcibly displayed by the nature of the trade which is openly carried on between the Colonies of Great Britain and Spain in the West Indies. The mode of it is detailed in the inclosed copy of a letter from a Mr Billings, wherein it will be seen that american vessels and cargoes, after being condemned in British Courts under pretence of illicit commerce, are sent on British account to the enemies of Great Britain, if not to the very port of the destination interrupted when they were american property. What respect can be claimed from others to a doctrine not only of so recent an origin and enforced with so little uniformity, but which is so conspicuously disregarded in practice by the Nation itself, which stands alone in contending for it?  
Sixthly—It is particularly worthy of attention that the Board of Commissioners jointly constituted by the British and American Governments under the 7th article of the Treaty of 1794, by reversing condemnations of the British Courts founded on the British instructions of Novemr. 1793, condemned the principle, that a trade forbidden to neutrals in time of peace, could not be opened to them in time of war; on which precise principle these instructions were founded. And as the reversal could be justified by no other authority than the law of Nations, by which they were to be guided, the law of Nations according to that joint Tribunal, condemns the principle here combatted. Whether the British Commissioners concurred in these reversals, does not appear: but whether they did, or did not, the decision was equally binding, and affords a precedent which could not be disrespected by a like succeeding tribunal, and ought not to be without great weight with both Nations in like questions recurring between them.  
On these grounds the United States may justly regard the British captures and condemnations of neutral trade with Colonies of the enemies of Great Britain as violations of right; and if reason, consistency or that sound policy which cannot be at variance with either, be allowed the weight which they ought to have, the British Government will feel sufficient motives to repair the wrongs done in such cases by its cruizers and Courts.  
But, apart from this general view of the subject, a refusal to indemnify the sufferers, in the particular case of the Aurora, is destitute of every pretext, because, in the second place, the continuity of her voyage was clearly and palpably broken, and the trade converted into a new character.  
It has been already noted that the British regulation of 1798 admits a direct trade in time of War, between a belligerent Colony and a neutral Country carrying on the trade; and admits consequently the legality of the importation by the Aurora from the Havana to Charleston. Nor has it ever been pretended that a neutral Nation has not a right to reexport to any belligerent Country whatever foreign productions, not contraband of war, which may have been duly incorporated and naturalized, as a part of the Commercial stock of the Country re-exporting it.  
The question then to be decided under the British regulation itself, is whether in landing the cargo, paying the duties, and thus as effectually qualifying the articles for the legal consumption of the Country, as if they had been its native productions, they were not at the same time equally qualified with native productions for exportation to a foreign Market. That such ought to be the decision results irresistably from the following considerations:  
1st. From the respect which is due to the internal regulations of every Country, where they cannot be charged with a temporizing partiality towards particular belligerent parties, or with fraudulent views towards all of them. The regulations of the United States on this subject, must be free from every possible imputation, being not only fair in their appearance, but just in their principles, and having continued the same during the periods of war, as they were in those of peace. It may be added that they probably correspond, in every essential feature relating to re-exportations, with the laws of other Commercial Countries, and particularly with those of Great Britain. The annexed outline of them, by the Secretary of the Treasury, will at once explain their character, and shew that, in the case of the Aurora, every legal requisite was duly complied with.  
2d. From the impossibility of substituting any other admissible criterion, than that of landing the articles, and otherwise qualifying them for the use of the Country. If this regular and customary proceeding, be not a barrier against further enquiries, where it may be asked are the enquiries to stop? By what evidence are particular articles to be indentified on the high seas, or before a foreign Tribunal? If identified, how is it to be ascertained, whether they were imported with a view to the market at home, or to a foreign Market, or as ought always to be presumed to the one or the other as it should happen to invite; or if to a foreign Market, whether to one forbidden or permitted by the British regulations; for it is to be recollected, that among the modifications which her policy has given to the general principle asserted by her, a direct trade is permitted to a neutral carrier, from a belligerent Colony to her ports as well as to those of his own Country. If, again, the landing of the goods, and the payment of the duties be not sufficient to break the continuity of the voyage, what it may be asked, is the degree of internal change or alienation, which will have that effect? May not a claim be set up to trace the articles from hand to hand, from ship to ship in the same port, and even from one port to another port, as long as they remain in the Country? In a word in departing from the simple criterion provided by the Country itself, for its own legitimate and permanent objects, it is obvious, that besides the defalcations which might be committed on our carrying trade, pretexts will be given to cruizers for endless vexations on our commerce at large, and that a latitude and delays will accrue in the distant proceedings of Admiralty Courts, still more ruinous and intolerable:  
3d From the decision in the British high Court of Admiralty itself, given in the case of the Polly, Lasky, Master, by a Judge deservedly celebrated for a profound judgment, which cannot be suspected of leaning toward doctrines unjust or injurious to the rights of his own Country. On that occasion he expressly declares “It is not my business to say what is universally the test of a bona fide importation: it is argued, that it would not be sufficient that the duties should be paid and that the cargo should be landed. If these criteria are not to be resorted to, I should be at a loss to know what should be the test; and I am strongly disposed to hold, that it would be sufficient, that the goods should be landed and the duties paid.” 2 Rob. Reports P: 368-9.  
The President has thought it proper that you should be furnished with such a view of the subject, as is here sketched; that you may make the use of it best suited to the occasion. If the trial of the Aurora should not be over it is questionable whether the Government will interfere with its Courts. Should the trial be over and the sentence of the Vice Admiralty Court at St John’s have been confirmed, you are to lose no time in presenting to the British Government a representation corresponding with the scope of these observations; and in urging that redress in the case, which is equally due to private justice, to the reasonable expectation of the United States, and to that confidence and harmony which ought to be cherished between the two Nations.  
The effect of the doctrine involved in the sentence of the Court in Newfoundland, on our carrying trade, will at once be seen by you. The average amount of our re-exportations for three years ending 30th Sept 1803 has been 32,003,921 dollars. Besides the mercantile and Navigation profits, the average revenue from drawbacks on goods re-exported for three years ending 31st Decr. 1803 is 184,271 dollars; to which is to be added an uncertain but considerable sum consisting of duties paid on articles reexported after having lost thro’ neglect or lapse of time, the privilege of drawback. A very considerable portion of this branch of trade with all its advantages, will be cut off, if the formalities heretofore respected, are not to protect our re-exportations. Indeed it is difficult to see the extent to which the apprehended innovation may be carried in theory; or to estimate the mischief which it may produce in practice. If Great Britain disregarding the precepts of Justice, suffers herself to calculate the interest she has in spoliating or abridging our commerce, by the value of it to the United States, she ought, certainly not to forget that the United States must in that case, calculate by the same standard, the measures which the stake will afford, for counteracting her unjust and unfriendly policy. I have the honor to be &amp;c.

** idle i-s herewith inclosed  
plain particularly thfe case of the lyrig  
Aurora.  
&#x27;•The silm of the ease is, that win! -t  
Spain&#x27;was at war with Great Britain,  
this Vessel, owned by a citizen oi  
United States, brought a cargo of !  
produce, purchased at the Havan­  
na, from that place to Charleston, wl.cia;  
! the cargo was landed, except an insigni­  
ficant portion of it, and the duties paid,  
or secured, according to iaw, In like  
manner as they&#x27;are required tobe paid*  
ir i eiured, on a like cargo, from what­  
ever port, meant foi heme consumption ,  
that the cargo remained on land about  
three weeks, when it was reshipped fir

drawn &#x27;jack, with a deduction of three. *  
and a half per cent, as is permitted to  
imported articles in ail cases, at any  
within one \ ear, under certain re­  
gulations, which were pursued in this  
; that the vessel was taken on her  
voyage by a British crui*er, and sent  
for trial to Newfoundland, where the;  
cargo was condemned by the court of  
vice admiralty ; and that the cause was  
Cai ried ti.* nee, by appeal, to Great Bri­  
tain, where it was apprehended thutths.  
-ace below wcuid not be reversed.  
• &#x27;I&#x27;d&#x27;- ground of this sentence was, and  
that of Its confirmation, if such be the  
&quot; rcsuli, must be, that the trade in which  
the vessel was engaged was unlawful,  
and this unlawfulness must re*&gt;t, first, on  
the general pnr.cdple assumed by Great  
Britain, that a trade from a colony to  
its parent cpdntry, being a trade net  
permitted to other nations in time i T  
c, cannot be made lawful to tnem in  
time of war ; secondly, on ihe allegation  
that the continuity oi the voyage from  
the Havana* to Barcelona was not bro­  
ken by landing the cargo m the United  
States, paying the duties thereon, and  
thus fulfilling *&#x27; ..--rc,|ii. i i-s t.&gt;  
a home consumption; and, therefore,  
that the cargo was subject to condemna­  
tion even under the British regulation  
of January, 1798, which so far r&gt; I  
the general principle as to allow a di­  
rect trade between a belligerent colony,  
ami a neutral country carrying on such  
a tr ■&quot;• ,  
With respectto the general principle  
which disallows to neutral nations in  
time of war, a trade not allowed to them  
hi time of peace, it may be observ­  
ed.  
First, That the principle is of modern  
date ; that it is maintained, as is believ­  
ed, by no other nation but Great Bri­  
tain; and that it W3s assumed by her  
under the auspices of ft maritime ascen­  
dancy, which rendered such * a princi­  
ple subservient to her particular inter­  
est. The history of her regulations on  
this subject, shews that tliey have bt en  
constantly modified under the influence  
of that consideration. The course of  
these modifications will be seen in sn ap­  
pendix to the fourth volume cf Robin­  
son&#x27;s Admiralty Reports.  
Secondly, That the principle ia mani­  
i festlv contrary to the general inter  
commercial nations, as well as to the  
law of nations settled by the mo*t up­  
proved authorities, which recognises n-&gt;  
&#x27; restraints on the trade of nations not at  
war, with nations at war, other thru*  
that it shall be impartial between thD  
latter, that it shall not extend to cer­  
tain military articles, nor to the traus­  
i portation of persons in military service,  
nor to places actually blockaded or be­  
sieged.  
Thirdly, That the principle is the  
more contrary to reason and to right, in  
asmuchasthe admission of neutral  
to a colonial trade shut i ou ir&gt;  
times of peace, may, and i  
It from considerations which open  
to neutrals direct channels of trade  
with the parent state, blurt to them m

Sixthly, It is particularly worthy of  
that the board of commt -  
ers jointly constituted by the. P.  
„„,; Ami rican governments under Hie  
nth article of the treaty of 1794, by  
rslng condemnations oi the Bri­  
ton , mdeil on the British in­

c I the principle, that a. trade forbidden  
toi\oi.tralsin time of peace,could lmlde  
opened to them in time of war; on  
which precise principle these instruc­  
tions wove founded. And as the rever­  
sal could be justified by no other autho­  
rity thin the law of nations, by which  
-.ve.-egmded, the law of nations,  
-dmtrto that joint tribunal, con­  
demns the principle here combatted.  
Whether the Brit&#x27;tHh commissioner:­  
concurred in these, reversals dees not  
appear4 but;whether they did or did  
uot, the ded d ;mv . . equally binding ;  
and affords a precedent which could  
not be disrespected by a like succeeding  
tribunal, and ought, not to be without  
great weight with both nations, in like  
questions recurring between them.  
On the .c gr&lt; I --*. niaj&#x27; just­  
ly regard the. British captures and con­  
deim neutral trade With colo­  
nies of the enemies of Great Britain as  
&#x27;ions of right j and if reason, eon­  
;ncy, or that sound policy which  
caanot be at variance with either, be  
which they ought to  
c, the British government will feel  
sufficient motives to repair the wrongs  
done in such cases by its cruisers and  
courts.  
But, apart from this general view of  
the subject, a refusal to indemnif) the  
bUfferers, in due particular case of the  
Aurora, is destitute of every pretext ;  
because, in the sei ond place, the conti­  
nuity of her voyage wasclearly and pal­  
pably, broken, and the trada converted  
into a new charact.. r.  
It has been already noted that the  
British regulation ot 1798, admits adi •  
rect trade in time of war between a  
belligerent colony and a neutral country  
•orryiog on the trade ; and admits  
consequently the legality of the impor­  
tation by the Aurora from the llavanna  
to Charleston. Nor has it ever been  
pretended that a neutral nation has not  
a right to re-export to an;, belligerent  
country whatever foreign _ productions,  
not contraband of war, which may have  
be&lt; nduly incorporated and naturalized,  
as part of gthe commercial stock of the  
country re-exporting It,  
The question then to be decided tin­  
der the British regulation itself, is,  
whether in landing the cargo, pa  
the duties, and thus as effectually quali­  
fying the articles for the legal consump­  
tion of the courtwyj as if they had ft-, n  
its native productions, thej werenotat  
the same time equally qualified with na­  
tive productions for exportation to a fo­  
reigi&#x27;i market. That such ought lb be  
the decision results irresistibly from the  
fi Slowing considerations.  
l. From the respect which is due to  
the internal regulations of every coun­  
try, where they cannot be charged with  
;&gt; temporizing partiality towards parti­  
cular belligerent parties or with frau­  
dulent views towards all of them. The

tation j being not only fair in their ap­

3. From the decision in the Britfehhigh  
court of admiralty itself, given in the  
-■ Polly, Lasky, master, by a  
deservedly celebrated for a pro-  
Igment, which cannot be suspect­  
ed ofli iinj towards doctrines.unjust or  
injurious to the rights of his own country.  
&#x27;. )n that occasion hi declares;  
&quot; It is not my business to say what is  
universally the test of a bona fide im­  
ition : it isai good that it w oujd be  
ient that die duties should be paid,  
and tl, i -.in-1 argo should d. If  
these ci iteria are not to be resorted to,  
I should be at a loss to know wh. it should  
be the tost ; and I am strongly dieposed  
to hold, thatit would be sufficient, that  
the goods should be landed and the du­  
ties paid.&quot; &#x27;2 Rob. Rep. p. 3£B—?.  
The president has thought it proper  
that.you should lie furnished with such*  
view of the subject as is here sketched ;  
you may make the use of it best  
Buitedtothe Oct i It the iii.il of  
t |ie Aurora should not be over it is ques­  
tionable whether the goi eminent will in­  
terfere with its courts. Should tne ll&#x27;i!ll  
er and! tfee sentence of the vice-ad­  
miralty court at St.Johns have been  
confirmed, you arc to lose no time in  
presenting to the British government a  
representation corresponding with the  
scope of these observatioijs; and in urg­  
ing that redress in the case, winch is &#x27;  
dy doe to private jus-ice, to the

Department of State, April 12, 1805.  
1 he pipers herewith inclofed explain particular­  
ly the cafe of tlie brig Aurora.  
The Aim of the cafeis, that whilft Spain was at  
war v. t i G. Eriiu.n, this veiTel, owned hy a citizen  
..f the United States, brought a cargo ofSpanilh pro­  
hue, purchufed at the Havanna, fromth.it place to  
Cnarledon, where the cargo was landed, except an  
mfign.firant portion of it, and the duties paid or fe­  
cn.ed, according to law, in like manner as they are  
required to he paid, or fecund, on a like cargo  
from whatever port, meant for home confumption!  
•ha: the cargo remained on land about three weeks  
when it was re-flnpped for Barcelona, in old Spam!  
and the duties drawn hack, with a deduction of three  
and a hr.!; per cent, as is pernv&#x27;tted to imported arti­  
cl. sin ad cafes, at any time vrithin one year, under  
&lt;erra;,i reflations, which were purftied in this cafe;  
tn.*t the veiTel was taken on her voyage by a Britilh  
cruifer, and fent for trial to Newfoundian 1, where  
tlie cargo was condemned by the court of vice admi­  
ralty ; and rb.it thecaufe was carried thence, b&quot; ap­  
peal, to Gre:u Britain, where it was apprehended  
tear the fentence below would not bereveried.  
The ground of this fentence svas, and that of its  
confirmation, if !uch be the rcfult, muft be, that the  
trade in which the veflll was engaged, was m.LiuAd  
and this unlae. fu&#x27;nels mull rod, firft, on tlie general  
principle afi-.imed hy Great Britain, that a trade from  
a colony to its parent country, being trajc not l;  
nutted to other nations in time of peace, cannot h­  
liiaui lawful to them in time of war ; Tecondly, o.i  
the all. gat ion that the continuity of the voyage from  
the I f ivann i to Barcelona was not brr ken hy l indim  
the cargo in the United States, paving the dutur. thtrt -  
on, and thus fulfilling the legal pre-rrquilites to i  
ho ne ronfumptioil : and, therefore, that the cargo  
w;i* tf) condemnation evf*n unvler the B itifi  
r gulution of January, I79R, winch ft. f,r relaxe­  
the general principle as to allow a dirrift trade be­  
tween a belligerent colony, and a neutral country  
carrying on fuch a trade.  
With refpeift to the g-aeral principle which difal­  
lowsto neutral nations In time of war, a trade not al­  
lowed to them in time of peace, it may he nbferved.  
Firft, That the principle is of modern date ; that  
it is maintained, rs is believed, by no other nstion  
but Great Britain; and that it was aflinned by her  
uuder the tmfpices of a maritime afeendanrv, whidi  
rendered fuch a principle fubfervient to her parti, u  
lar inter, ft. The hiftory of her regulations on risis!  
fubjedt, fhews that they have been conftantly mo li­  
lted under the iaflurnce of that coufideratien. J he  
courfe ofthefe modifications will he A en in an appen- !  
ihx to the fourth volume of Robinfon’s Admiralty Re

tv-cnn.My, l fiat the principle is manifeftlv contra­  
ry to the p-noral imereti of commercial nations, as  
well :t« to the law of nation* fsttlcd by the moll  
prove-! authorities, which recognize* no reftraints on

i iiirdiy, I oat the principle is the more contrary  
to reafon and to rii;ht, inafmueh as the adinitfion of  
neutrals into a colonial trade tout apainfl them in  
times..f peace, may at d often dm-s, rtfuit from con­

But apart from this general view of the fuhWl a  
refufal to mdenin.fv the fitHirer.,, in the par .cniar  
rale of the Aurora, is deflirute of every pt/ext • b*  
ciuie. in the fecond place, the continuity nf her’voy&quot;  
age was clearly and palpably broken, and the »Je  
converted into a new character.  
It has been already noted that the Britifh rtmilati.  
on i.f 1.9fl, admits a dir-dl trad-in rime of w,-r 1.  
tween a belligerent colony and a neutral country car­  
rying on the trade ; raid admits conlequenrly th- le­  
gality of the importation by the An ora from th’. Ha  
vanna to Charlellon. Nor has it ever Been pretend,  
ed that a neutral nation lias not a right to re-expert to  
in&gt; belligerent country whatever foreign produchom.  
not contraband of war, which may have he r. duly  
incorporated and iwui .lized, as part of the commer­  
cial nock oHne country re exp. -rcii g it.  
The oueflion then to be decided under the Britifh  
regulation iff-If, is, whether in landing the tar-’„

Dc/iartmcm of State, sf/trll 13, lgos. !  
I “ i he e prrs herewith enclosed ex­  
plain parucu.uily the case or the briar  
Aurora. h j  
! 1 «r ths case is, that whilst  
Spain was at war with Great Britain,&#x27;  
this vessel, owned by a citizen or (he U. !  
States, bro&#x27;t a cargo of Spanish produce, !  
purchased at the Havanna, from that place  
to Charleston, where the Cirgo was land­  
ed except an insignificant portion of it,  
in lixe manner as they are required to j  
be paid, or secured, on a like cargo, from  
whateser port, meant for home consump­  
tion, that the cargo remained on land a-i  
hou* three weeks, when it was reshipped  
for Ba&#x27; oelona, in old Spain, and the duties  
c.rawn back- with a deduction of three k  
a ban per cent as is permitted to irapor- ■  
ted articles in nil cases, at any time with­  
in one year, under certain t gulatinns, ,  
which wera pursued m this tasej that i  
  
’•&#x27;•v vessel lekm nn h»r voyage 1»y a J  
cruiser, and sent f~r trial to New- |  
r«»imd!am!, wliore (tie carfp cnndetnn 1  
srl hy the&#x27; court of vicc-ndrnirt»ltjr; and |  
th«l the cause was carried thence, hy ap- ;  
peal, to Great Britain, where tt was ap­  
prehended that the sentence below would  
not bs reversed.  
The ground of this sentence was, and i  
that of its confirmation, if such be the re­  
sult, must he, that the trade in which the  
vessel was eng-igcd was unlawful, and  
this unlawfulness must rest, first, on the  
general principle assumed by Gieat Bii­  
tain, that a trade from a colony to its pa­  
rent country, being a trade not permitted  
to other nations in time of ptace, cannot  
be made lawful to thean in time of war ;  
secondly, on the allegation that the con­  
i tiuuity of the voyage from the Havanna  
to Barcelona was not broken by landing  
the cargo in the U. States, paying the  
duties tJw:renn, and thus fulfilling the le­  
gal pie requisites to a home consunp i­  
on : and, therefore, that ihe c&gt;i go win sub­  
jsG* to condemnation even under the Bri­  
tish regulation of January, I7&#x27;?s, which  
so far reluxe* the general principle as to  
allow a direct trade between a belligerent  
colony, and a neutral country earryingou  
such a trade.  
With respe£\ to the general principle  
which disallows to neutral Italians in time  
of war, a trade not allowed to thura in  
time of pwace, it may be obs^rvrd.  
First. 1 hat the principle is of modern  
date; that it is maintained, ns is believ­  
ed, by no other r,*&#x27;inn but Great Britain ;  
and that it was as-utntd by her under tlie  
auspices of a nun dime a»ce.id \ncy, which  
rendered such a principle subservient to  
her particular interest. The history of  
ber regulations on this subjtft, shows  
that they have been constantly modified  
&#x27;.ndcr the influence of that consideration  
The count of these modifications will be  
seen in an appendix to the fourth volume  
of itnhinsori&#x27;s Admiralty Reports.  
Secondly, That the principle is roani­  
  
iesuy contrary to uie gcnaral interest of  
commercial nations, as well as to the law  
of nations settled by the most approved  
authorities, which recognises no restraints  
on the trade of nations not at war, with  
nations at war, other than that it shall be  
impartial between the latter, that it shall  
not extend to certain military ai ticks, nor  
to the transportation of persons in milita­  
ry service, nor to places actually blocka­  
ded or besieged.  
Thirdly, That the principle is the more  
contrary to reason and to right, inasmuch  
as the admission of neutrals into a colo­  
nial Hade shut against them in times of  
peace, may, and of&lt;ei*d&lt;&gt;es, result from  
considerations which open to neutrals di­  
red] channels of Hade with lie pa. «ni slate  
shut to them in times ofpuace,the legality  
of which latter relaxation is not known to  
have been contested ; und iuusmocli as a  
commerce may be, and frequently is o­  
pened in time of war, between a colony  
and other countries, from considerations  
which ate not incident td the war, ano  
j which would produce the same efiedf in  
; a time ot peace ; sueh, for example, as a  
! failui&#x27;: or diminution of the ordinary sour­  
i ecs of necessary supplies or new turns in  
j the course of profitable interchanges.  
Fourthly, That it is not only contrary to the  
principles and pra&amp;ice of other nation*, hut to  
the prartice of G-.aat Britain herself. It is well  
known to be her invariable prartice in time of  
war, by relaxations in her navigation law*, to  
admit neutrals to trade in channels forbidden to  
them in times of peace i and particularly to o­  
pen bet colonial trade both to neutral vessels &amp;  
supplies, to which it i« *hut in times of peace j  
and that one at lea^t of her ohjerts, in there  
relaxations, is to g.ve to her trade an immunity  
from capture, to which in her own hands it  
would b« subjertrd hy the war.  
Filthly 7 he prartice which has prevailed in  
the B.irish dominions, sanctioned by orders of  
council and an art of parliament, [39 G 3 c. 98]  
authorising lor British subjerts a uirrrt trade with  
the enemy, still further ditniniehes the force of  
Iter pre&#x27;epaions for depriving us of the colonial  
trade. Thus we seem Robinson’s admiralty re­  
port* P« bn, that during the last war, a licen­  
3e&#x27;d commercial intercourse prevailed between  
Grear Britain and her enemies, France. • Strain

--tux miru anicios  
necc sary for her maiiufafiur- s and agriculture ;  
notwithtsauding the eflira it had in opening a  
vem to the surplus productions of the others—  
In this manner sw assumes to suspend the war  
itself as to particular objefts of trade beneficial  
te herself I whilst she denies the right of the  
other Welligetente to suspend their accustomed  
commercial restriflions in favor of neutrals_  
But the injustice and inconsistency of her at­  
tempt to press a stria rule on neutrals, is more  
forcibly displayed by the nature of the trade  
which it ofienly carried on between the eolonics  
of Great Britain and Spain in the West Indies.  
The mode of it is detailed in the enclosed copy  
•f ». wherein it  
will be s«en that the American vessels and car  
goes, after being condemned in British court*  
under pre ente of illicit commerce, are sent on  
British account, to the eremies ef Great Britain,  
&#x27; if not to the very port of the destination interupt­  
ed when they were American property What  
j respatf can be claimed from others te a doArine

i with so little uniformity, but which is so conspi.  
; cuonsly disregarded in praftice by the nation  
; &lt;«*elf, which stands alone in contending for it I  
| Sixthly. It Is particularly worthy of attention  
, that the board of commissioners jointly const i*  
&#x27;■ted by the British and American governments  
| tinder the 7th article of the treat* of 1794, by  
j reversing condemnation* of the British ronrts  
| founded on the British instruAions of Novem  
I her, 179S, condemned the priaciple, that a trade  
I forbidden t* neutrals in time of peace, could not  
be opened to them in time of wart on which  
precise principles these InstruAion* were found­  
ed And a*, the reversal could U justified by no  
o- ier authority than the law of nation*, by which  
tha; were guided,&#x27;he law of nation*, according  
to that joint tribunal, condemn* me principle here  
combatted. Whether the British corrmistioners  
concurred in these reversals doe* not ropear 5  
bus whether they did or did nor, the uecision  
was equally binding 1 and affords a precedent  
which ceuld not he disretpeAed by a like sue*  
eerding tribunal, and ought not to be without  
great weight with both nation*, in like questions  
rccurtirg between them*  
  
On thr«f r&quot;&#x27;Co ,» the Vr*f^d *t**rs iw-v !T?s».

lowed the weight which they Ought to havo the  
British government will feel sufficient motives  
to repair the wrongs done in such caj.es by its  
cruisers and courts.  
But, apar» from this general view of the sub*  
]cct. a refusal to indemnify the &quot;auTe.eri, tn the  
pa«tscular case of the Aurora, is destitute «.f ev .  
cry pre ext ; b**cail«.e in the second p&#x27;ace, the  
con’inuity of her voyage was clearly urd palpa­  
bly broken, and the trade converted into a new  
charaAer  
It has been already noted that the Drrish re*  
gulation cf 1798.admits a direA traj:: in lime of  
i war between a belligerent colony and a nouinl  
I country carrying on the trade ; and admits con­  
I sequcnrly the legality of the importation by the  
Aur* ra from thi? Havannito Char.-won. Nor  
has it ever been pretend’d that a netPral nation  
has not a right to re expert to any belligerent  
country whatever foreign produAions, not con­  
traband of war. which may have been duly in­  
corporated and naturalized, as part of the com­  
mercial stock of the country reexporting it.  
The question then to be decided under the  
t British regulation itself, is, whether in landing  
j the cargo, paying the d t:es, and thus as cfteAu.  
allv qualifying the articles for the legpl con­  
j sumption of the country, as if they had been its  
native produ lions thsy w re no at the Same time  
equally qualified with native prodnAions for ex­  
portation to a foreign market. That such ought  
j to be the decision results irresistibly from the  
t following conrideratiems :

lations of the United States on this subjcA, trust  
he free from every po*s;ble impntat&#x27;on * being  
not only fair in their appea*aqce, but jut in their  
principles, and having continued the same dating  
the periods of war, as they were in thore of  
peace- It may be added tint they probably cor­  
respond, in every essential feature relating to­  
re exportations, with the laws of other commer­  
cial countries, and particularly with those of  
Great Bri»ain. The annexed outline of them,  
by the Secretary of the Treasury, will at once  
explain their charaAer, and shew, that in the  
case of the Aurora, every legal requisite was  
duly complied with.

has given to the general principle asserted by her*  
a dired trade is permitted to a neutral carrier

as to those of his own country If, again, th©

&#x27;-W&#x27;it&#x27;n respect to &#x27;the general principle  
which diaallows to nentral nations in time  
of war, a trade not allGWed to them in time  
of peace, it ay-be observed.  
First, Th lsi the principle is of modern  
date; that,/it is maintained, as is believed,  
by another arion but Great Britaio; and  
that it wassissrssumed by her under-sithe aus.  
pices osssctass msitratime ascendancy, which  
rendered such &amp; principle subservient to her  
particular interest. The history of her re­  
gulatinus on the subject, she-ws that they  
have been constantly modisicdnnder the  
inﬂuence of that consideration-si The course  
ol these modisications will be seen in an  
appendix to the fourth volume Of-RObih­  
sou&#x27;s Admiralty Reports.  
Secondly, that the principle is manifest­  
ly contrary to the-general interest ol&#x27;com­  
mercial nat-iqns, asct wellas to the law til  
nations settled by the mast approved au­  
thori&#x27;ties, which recngnists no restraints  
on the trode of notions not at war, with  
nationcat war, other than that it shall be  
impartial between the latter, that it shall  
not extend to certain military articles, nor  
to the transportation of persons in military  
service, nor taplaces acmallyssblockaded or  
  
besieged. _  
slsshir—dly. That the principle is the more  
contrary to reason and to right, inasmuch  
as the admission of neutrals into a colonial  
trade shut against them in times ol peace,  
may, and often-does, result from consider­  
ations which open to neutrals direct chan­  
lnels of trade with the parent state, shut  
to them in times of peace, the&#x27;legality of  
which latter relaxation is not known to have  
&quot;been contested; and inasmuch as commerce  
may be, and frequently is opened in a time  
of war between a colony and other coun­  
ries, from considerations which are not in.  
cident to the war, and which would pro­  
duce the same eﬀect in a time of peace,­  
such sssifssir example, as a failure or-diminu­  
tion of the ordinary sourcsics of necessary  
supplies, or new turns in the course- of  
profitable interchanges. - ss  
Four—:hly, That it is notonly- contrarysito  
the princssiples and pracxice of othernations,  
but to the practice of Great Britain her­  
self. lt is. well known to be- her invaria­  
ble practice in time of war, by relaxations  
in her navigznion laws, to admit neutrals to  
trade in channels &#x27;fotbidden to them in.  
times of peace; and particularly to open  
her colonial trade bothsito neutrcil vessels  
and soppltes, to which it is shut in times of  
peace ; and that one at least of her Objects,l  
in these relaxations, is to give to her trade  
an immnnity from capture, to which in her  
own hands it would be subjected-by the  
war­  
  
Fifssthly, &#x27;l&#x27;he practice&#x27;wmcn nas prevun­  
ed in the British domininns, sanctsiioned by  
orders of council and an act oi- parliament,  
59 G. 3. c. 98.&quot;] authorising for British  
subjects a direct trade with the enemy,  
still further diminishes the force of her pre;  
tensions for deprivmg us of the Winnial  
trade. Thus we see in Rebinson&#x27;s admi­  
z-alty reports passim. that during the last  
war, &#x27;a iicensed commerciai intercourse  
prevailed between Great Britain and her e­  
nemies, France, Spain and Holiand,&#x27;be­  
cause itcompreh-ctnded articies necessary.  
for her mauufsiictssures and agricuiture ; &#x27;not­  
withstanding the eﬀect ]! had in opening ?:  
vent to the surpluss productions of the o­  
thers. si-In this manner she asSumes te) sus—  
pend the war itself as tosspartictcular objects  
of trade benesisicial to herself; whilst she  
denies the right of the other&#x27;bclligerents  
tosi suspend thetr accustomed Commerciul  
restrictions in savnr of neutrais. But the  
injnstice and inconsistency of her attempt  
to press a strict-ruie onneutrais, is more  
forcibiy disþiayed by the nature of the trade  
which .is openly carried on between the co.  
lonies of Great Britain and Spain in&#x27;the  
West lndies. The mode of it is detaﬂed  
in the enclosed cepy of a leter (from &#x27;_

in time of war, Wr relaxations in  
  
her navigation laws, to admit neu­  
trals to trljdein channels forbidden  
to them in tiroeiof:peace ; and par­  
ticularly to open her colonial trade to  
npittral Vf;i?cls rrd Simmies, tO  
which it is shnt in times of peace :  
&#x27; and that one at least of her object,  
in these relaxations is to trive to her  
trav-e an immunity from capture, to  
which in her own hands it would be  
subjected by the war.  
Fifthlv, &#x27;ftie practice which )ias  
prevailed In the British dominions &#x27;  
sanctioned by orders of council anaj  
an act of prliamtmt, 59 G. o c. 98 j  
authorising for British subjects a di-J  
rcct trade with the enemy,&quot; stillfurther-  
diminid.es the force of her  
pretensions for depriving us of the  
cojonial trade. Thus we sec in Ho­  
bitlson&#x27;s admiralty reports, passim,  
that, during the last war, a licensed  
commercial intercourse prevailed he­  
two en Great-Bntain ard her enemies  
France, Spain and Ilo&#x27;land, because  
f rrmnrtli&#x27;-nflff! nrirl; iipTSSAVV  
for h-.r ntsnufacturcs and agricul  
x,,...! .. .v... .  
ture; notwithstanding the effect it  
iiad in opening r. vent to flie surpsus  
iroductirns of the ethers. In this j  
manner s!e assu;ieii to suspend the  
war herself as t- particuHr .objects  
of trade benehcial to herself; vinlst  
she denies the rights of the oilier  
bel.igerenU to suspend their accus  
tomed commercial restrictions m ia..  
vor of neutrals But the injuries and  
npt to press  
a strict rule on rcufrjHs more for­  
cibly displayed by&#x27; tlie nature of the  
trade which is openly carried on be  
tween the colonies of Great-Britain j  
and Spain i-Uhe West-Indies. The  
mode of it is detailed in the enclosed  
cop &quot; ot a l ttcr trom.  
wherein it will be seen that Ameri  
can vessel and cargoes, after being  
condemned in British courts under  
pretence of illicit commerce, are  
sent on British account, to the ene­  
mies, of Great-Britr.in, if not to the  
very port of the destination intemip­  
ed when they were American pro  
perty. What respect can &#x27;oe claimed  
from others tp a doctrine not only of  
so recent an origin, and enforced  
with so little uniformity, but which  
is so conspicuously disregarded in  
practice by the nation itself, which;  
stands alone in contending for it ?  
Sixthly, It is particularly worthy  
of attention thai the board cf com­  
missioners jointly constituted hy the  
British and American governments  
under the seventh article of the trea­  
ty of 1791, by reversing condemna­  
tions of the British courts founded  
on the British ins&#x27; ructions ofNo-vcm-ber.  
179 ?, condemned the prin­  
ciple, that a trade forbidden to neu  
;tr&amp;Js in time of peace, could not be  
opened to litem in time of war ; on  
which precise principle these instruc­  
tions were fcmndgd. And as the re­  
versal couM be JusMned hy no other  
au&#x27;Iiority than the latv f;f nations, by  
i w dchthey wei e gnr.r le.hthelawofna-  
;i;ns, according to t.hui jr.int tribunal,  
oidemnstheprincp&#x27;e iierecornhated.  
Whether the : British commissioners  
I, concurred in these re - ersds d es not  
.ppear ; but whether they did or did  
lot, the decision wascquallv rinding;  
1 and affords a precedent whkh could  
not be disrespected by a likesucceeding-  
tribunal, and oucdit not to  
e rtithout great weight with both  
nations, in like- rftiestions recurring  
between them.  
:,.&#x27;:On these grounds the United  
States. may justly regard the British  
captures and condemnations of neu­  
tral trade with colonies of the cne  
mies, of Great-Brkain as violations  
of right; and if reason, consistency,  
or that sound polxy wmch cannot  
. . ... -  
. wrongs done in such casea by its  
crvuzers and courts-  
But, apart from this- general view  
of the subject, a refusal to indemni­  
fy the sufferers, in the particular  
r.aic of the Aurora, is destitute ol  
vry pretext; because, in the second  
K Place, the continuity  
vas cltarly and palpably broken and  
the trade convertetiinto a new cha-  
racier.  
It has bce already noted that the  
Klritish regubiidn of 1793, admits a  
direct trade i:i time of war between a  
  
  
ii r l V VvrcnpVim received&#x27; bv the Printer and hy every Postmaster in ihe ta.-  
uiserted the first time fur Half a- Dollar and for a Quarter in every Micxecding l4per

th. Ha va nti .V to GharJeton Nor  
hasit ever been; pretetided that a  
nctttrul nation has not a right to re­  
export to any&#x27; belligerent country  
whateir foreign productions, not  
contraband of war, Whtch may have  
been duly -incorporated and natura­  
lized, as part df the commercial  
stock of the country re-exporting it.  
The question then to be decided  
under the British rJlntion itself,  
is, whether in rdTifg-Vthc caro  
navintr the duties, aiid thus-Vs  
tualy quahfyingithe articles tor .1 he

if they nad been its native produc­  
tions, they were not .it the same  
time equally qualified for exporta­  
tion to a foreign market That su h  
ought to be the decision, results w  
resistible from the following consi­  
derations:1. Fom the respect which is due  
to the internal regulation of eVery  
country,- where they cannot be  
ch.:n.red with a temporising partiali  
ty towards particular belligerent par­  
ties or with fraudulent vieWs towards  
all of them. The regulations of the  
United States on this subject, must  
be free from every possible imputa­  
tion : being not orrly ff.ir ia their p&amp;  
pcarance, but just in their principles,  
and havjng continued the same dur-  
i;e,i,K!, of T, s  
m t.iosc of peace. It may be added  
tnat tney prorjffmy corresponu, in e  
very essen&#x27;.ial ff attire relating lo re  
exportations, with the laws ot otuer  
commcraWl countries, and particu­  
larly with &#x27;those rf Great-Britain.  
The annexed out I&#x27;m of them, bv the  
Sccrctaiyof theTreasury, will at  
once explain their character, rind  
shew that, in the case of the Auror.  
raj, ev-n y legal &#x27;recpiisitc ttas duly  
complied wi ll.  
2. From th?j impossibility of sub­  
stunting any other admissible crite­  
rion, than that of landing the. arti-  
.ls, and otherwise qualifying them  
-tor the iis. of the country, tf this  
egular and customary proceeding,  
be not a barrier against further enqui-

enquiries to stop ? By what evidence

By the law of nations, as settled by the most ap­

on the trade of neutral nations, with those at war,  
than that it he impartial between the latter ; that it  
shall not extend to articles which are deemed contra­

DiFJMTilMNTof SfATC, Abrtl 12, 1805.  
  
44 The papers herewith Inclosed explain  
  
particularly the cite of the brig Aurora.  
  
&quot; The sum of the case is, that whilst  
  
Spam was at war with Great-Britain, this  
  
vessel, owned by a citizenef the United States,  
brought a cargo of Spanish produce, pur-  
  
chased atthc Hava&amp;ns, from that place to  
Charleston, where the csrguwat landed, ex­  
cept an insignificant portion of it, and the  
duties paiJ, or secured, according to law,  
in like manner as they are required to be  
paid, or secured, on a like cargo, from what  
CTcr porVnc,nt for borne cousuropiljn that  
(he cargo remained on land about three  
  
weeks, when it was reshipped for Barctlonifi  
  
, in old Spain, and the duties drawn buck, with  
a deduction of three and a half per cent, as is  
permitted to Imported articles in all esses, at  
any time within one year, under certain re­  
futations, which were pursued in this case;  
that the fesici was taken on her Toysrje by a  
British cruiser, and sent for trial to New­  
foundland, alert tie cargo condsnmed  
by the aourt ef rice-admiralty i andihatthe  
taasc was tarried thence, by appeal, to  
Great-Britain, where it wss apprehended that  
the sentence below would not be reversed.  
The ground of this sentence was, and that  
ef its confirmation, if such be the result,  
roast be, Jhatthe trsde in which, the tern!  
was engaged was unlawful, and this unlaw­  
fulness mutt rest, first, on the general prin­  
clple assumed by Great liriia in, that a trade  
from a colony to ill patent country, being a  
trsdt not permitted to other nations In tin  
f peace, cannot be made lawful to them in  
&quot;time of war; secondly, on the allegation  
that the continuity of the voyage from the  
llsvanna to Barcelona ws not broken by  
landing the cargo in the United States, pay.  
log the duties thcrtvn,end thus fulfilling the  
kgl pre-requisitiet to a hm consumption  
and, therefore, that the cargo wss lulled  
  
to condemnation even under the British re  
  
gulation of January If93, which so far re  
  
laics the rrncraJ brimiple ss to allow a d&#x27;-  
  
rect trade between a UUiijtrtnt colony, and  
  
t Bcutral cauutry carrying eu such a trade.  
  
&quot;With rcsnect to the general principle  
  
which disallows to neutral nations in time  
  
of war, a trade not allowed to them in time  
of peace, it may be observed. .  
  
t irst, ,1 hat he rtnGrpiejv; j  
  
date ; that it is maintained, as ijr uelievea,  
bv no other nation but Great-Britain ; and  
  
, that it was assumecLby her underdhe aus  
  
pices of a maratime ascendancy, which ren-  
. 1 . .&#x27;. fr .-.Unit  
  
clcrctl such a principle uusei vicuv. i  
  
navicular interest, ihe history of her regu  
  
lations on this subject, shews that they &#x27;have  
-i ..ii.. , T.UCl itnrtMi the Influence  
  
UICll UlllllMli iiiuiiiuixi u&quot;i  
of that consideration. The course of these  
  
modifications will be seen in an appendix to  
  
the fourth volume of Robinson&#x27;s Admiralty  
  
Reports. . &#x27;  
Secondly, That the principle is manifestly  
contrary to the generalintercsl of commer­  
cial nations, as well as to the law of nations  
  
settled by the most approved authorities  
  
which recognises ntrrestrainis on me uauc  
of nations riot at war, with nations at war, o-  
  
ther than that it shall be impartial between  
the latter, that it shall not extend to certain  
military articles, nor to the transportation  
of persons in military service, nor to places  
actually blockaded or besieged.  
. Thirdly, That the principle is the more  
contrary to reason and to right, inasmuch  
as the admission of neutrals into a colonial  
trade shut against them in times of peace,  
may, and often does, result from considcra-&#x27;  
lions which .open to neutrals direct channels  
of trade with the parent state, Bhut to them in  
timrs of peace, the legality of which latter  
relaxation is not known .to have been contes­  
ted; and inasmuch as a commerce&#x27; may be,  
and frequently is opened in lime of war, be­  
tween a colony arid other countries, from  
considerations which are not incident to the  
war, and which would produce the same ef­  
fect in a time of peace ; such, for example,  
os a failure or dittiunitinn of the ordinary  
sources of necessary supplies, or new turns  
in the course of profitable interchanges.  
Fourthly, That it is not only contrary to  
the principles and practice of other nations,  
but to the practice of Great-Britain herself.  
It is well known to be her invariable practice  
in time of war, by relaxations in her naviga­  
tion laws, to admit hctitrals to trade in chan­  
nels forbidden to them in times of peace ;  
and particularly to open her colonial trade  
both to neutral vessels and supplies, to which  
it is shut in times of peace; and that one at  
least of her objects, in these relaxations, is  
  
to give tohertradee immunity from capture,  
to which in her owti hands it would be subject­  
ed by the war. &#x27; ,  
Fifthly. The practice which has prevailed  
  
in the. British dominions, sanctioned by or­  
ders of council and an act of parliament,  
39 G. 3. c. 98. authorising for Britith sub­  
jects a direct trade with the enemy, still fur­  
ther diminishes the force of her pretentions  
for depriving usofthe colonial trade. Thus  
w e see in Robinson&#x27;s admiralty reports pas­  
sim, that during the l.nt war, a licensed com­  
mercial intercourse prevailed between Great­  
Britain and her enemies, France,&#x27; Spain and  
Holland, because it comprehended .articles  
necessary for her manufactures and agricul­  
ture ; notwithstanding the effect it had in o­  
penmg a rent to the Surplus productions of  
the others. In this manner she assumes to  
susjiend the war ittc&#x27;lf as to particular t bjects  
ol trade benrficia! to herself; whilst she denies  
the right of the other belligerents to supcnd  
thr&#x27;ir acrustomed commercial restrictions in  
favor of neutrals. Put the injustice and in­  
consistency of licr attempt to press a strict  
rule on neutrals, is more foiciUy displayed  
by the nature of the trade which isopenly car­  
ried on between t he colonics of Grrat-Uritniii  
end Spain in the Wtst-lndits. The iw!e  
  
of it is detailed In the enclosed copy of alcl-  
  
ler iioro , wntrcin u  
  
wrVibe seen that American tefl and car­  
oes,sftcr being condemred in Brilhh courts  
under pretence of illicit commerce, are sent  
on British account&#x27;, to the emmies of Great­  
Britain, if not to the very pott of the destina­  
tion interrupted when they, were American  
property. hat respect can be claimed  
  
from others to a doctrine not only of so re­  
cent an origin, ai.J enforced with so little  
uniformity! but which is so conpicuouly  
disregarded in practice by the nation itself,  
which Hands alone in contending for it ?  
Sixthly. It Is particularly worthy of alien-  
  
tion that the board f cmrr&#x27;usontrs jointly  
constituted by the British and Americsn go­  
vemmrnts under the sevtnth article of the  
treaty cf 1754, by reversing condemnations  
of the British rouris (oundid on the British  
instructions of Noveroher, IT93, condemned  
the principle, that a Trade forbidden to neu­  
trals in time of frsre, could not be opened to  
them in time of war; on which prtcie prin­  
ciple these Instructions were fmindcd. Ami  
as the re vrrsal could be fmiHed by no other  
authority than the Isw wf nations, by which  
they were guided, the law tfrntlrnv accor  
dio to that joint tribunal, crndcratis the  
principle here comhatied. Whether the  
BritWh commissioners cottcurrtcUn tl.ce re  
  
versals docs hot apprsrt but whether lhey  
did or did not, the drf iion was rnually bin­  
ding andaffwrdia prrirdent which could  
nyt be diirtspccud 1 a like succccdirg tri  
  
bunal, and ought not to be without, great  
  
weight with both nations, in like questions re  
  
curring between thrm.  
On these grounds the U. S. may justly  
regard the British captures and condemna­  
tions of neutral trade with colonies of the e-  
  
.nemies pf Great-Britain as violtttions of right j  
  
and if, reason, consistency, or that sound  
i- , - . i : ... .s.u--.i&#x27;:  
  
ptHtcy wnicn cannot u ai varicincc wiui ci­  
ther, be allowed the weight which they ought  
to have, tho British government will feel suf­  
ficient motives to, repairthe wrongs done in  
  
such cases by its cruisers and courts. -,  
y. But; apart from ..this general yibw of the  
subject refusal to, indemnify the sufferers,  
in the particular case of the Aurora, desti­  
tute of every pretext because,&#x27; in&quot; the se­  
cond place, the . continuity of heroyage  
wis cU&#x27;Kfty , and palpably broken, alid .the  
Wde converted tifloa iiew chrcter. -  
It has been already noted that the British  
regulation of 1798, admits a direct trade in  
time of war between a belligerent colony and  
k neutral country carrying on the trade ; and  
admits consequently the legality of the im­  
portation by the Aurora from the Hayanna  
to Charleston. Nor has it ever been preten­  
ded that a neutral nation has not a right.to  
re-export, to any belligerent country whate­  
ver foreign productions, not contraband cf  
war, which may have been duly incorporated  
and naturalized, as part of the commercial  
atock of the country re-exporting it.  
v The question then to be decided under  
the British regulation itself, is whether, in  
landingthe cargo, paying the duties, and  
thus as effectually qualifying the articles for  
the. legal consumption of the countiy, as if  
they had been ii native productionsjht-y  
were not at the same time &#x27; equally qualified  
with native productions for exportation to a  
foreign market. That such ought to be the  
decision results irresistibly from the follow­  
ing considerations.  
I. From the respect which is due to the  
internal regulation of every country, where  
they cannot be charged with a temporizing  
partiality towards particular belligerent par  
  
ties or with fraudulent views towards all&#x27;of  
  
; them. The regulalionsof the U.S. On this sub  
  
ject, must be free from every possible impute  
tion; beingnot only fair in their appearance  
but just intheir principles, and having coming  
  
ed thesanre during the periods of war, as  
  
they were in those of peace. It may be ad­  
ded that they probably correspond, in every  
  
essential feature relating to re-exportations,  
  
wtk the laws of other commercial cruutrics,  
  
and particularly with those rf Grel-Britaic  
  
The annexed outline of them, by the Semta-  
  
ry otthe t reasury, will at once explain their  
  
character, and shew that, in the case of the  
  
Aurora, every legal requisite was duly com  
  
plied with. . ...  
  
2.- From the impossibility of substituting  
  
any other admissible criterion, than that of  
  
landing the articles, and otherwise qualify  
  
ing them for the use ot the country. If this  
regular and customary proceeding, he not a  
barrier against further enquiries, where, il  
may be asked, are the tnrrjirits to stop? By  
what evidence are particular articles to be  
identified on the high seas, or before a fo­  
reign tribunal? If identified, how is it to  
be ascertained whether ihey were imported  
with a view to the market at home, or to a fo­  
reign market, or as ought always la be pre­  
sumed, to ihe one or the other as it should  
happen to invite f Or if to a foreign market,  
whether to one forbidden or permitted by  
the British regulations f For it is to be re­  
collected that among the modifications which  
her policy has given to the general principle  
asserted by her, a direct trade is permitted  
to a neutral carrier from a belligerent clor.y,  
to hef ports, as well as&#x27; to those of -his ov n  
Mintry.Jf, sgain, the .landing of the goods,  
and the pay mrnHifduties be not sufficient to  
break the continuity of the voyage, what, it  
may be asked, is thfc decree of internal  
change or alienation which will have that ef­  
fect? May iwt a claim be set tip to trace  
the articles frem hand lo hand, from ship to  
ship, in the same port, and even from one  
port to another port, as long as they remain  
in the country? In a word, in departing  
from the simple criterion provided by the  
country itself, for Us own 1r jriiimatc and per-  
  
I maneni objects, it Is obvious that besides  
  
I the tlclakations which micht be committed  
  
on our carrying trade, pretests will be piven.  
  
id cruisers lor endless vexations on our  
commerce at large, and that a latitude and  
delayi will accrue in the distant twoceedins  
  
of admiralty courts, suit more ruinous and  
  
intolerable. .

?cnn Munyoe, Efg. dated, Department of  
tate, April 13, 1804,  
*“ The papers hercwith inclofed explain par.  
ticalarly the cafe of the brig Aurora.  
** The fum of the cafe 15, that whilft Spain  
was at war with Grear Britaia, this veflel,  
owned by a citizeo of the United States, brooght  
a cargo of Spanith produce, purchafed at the  
Havanna, from that place to Lphtlcﬁon, where  
the cargo was landed, except an inﬁgciicam  
portion of it, and the daties paid, or fecured,  
aecording to law, in like manner as they are re­  
quired to be paid, or fecured, on a like cargo,  
from whatever port, meant for home confump­  
tion, that the cargo remained oo board about  
three wecks, when it was refhipped for Barce­  
lona, inold Spain, and the duties drawn back,  
with a deduétion of three acd a half per ceor,  
as is permicted to imported articles in all cafes,  
at any time within one year, under certain re.  
gulations, which were purfued in - this cafe ;  
that the veflel was taken on her voyage by a Bri­  
tith croifer, and fent for trial to Newfoundland,  
where the cargo was condemned by the court  
of vice admiralty ; and that the caufe was car­  
ried theace, by appeal, to Grear-Britain,  
where it was apprehended that the fentence be­  
low would not be reverfed,  
  
The ground of this fenterice was, and that  
of its confirmation, if fuch be the refult, muft  
be, that tke trade in which the veflel was en­  
ga:cd was unlawfcl, and this wolawfolnefls matt  
rek, firft, on the general principle affamed by  
&#x27; Great- Britain, thac a trade trom a colony to its  
parent country, being a trade not permitted to  
~other natious in time of peace, cannot be made  
lawful to them in time of war ; fecondly, onthe  
allcgation that the contiouity of the voyage  
from the Havanoa 10 Barcelona was not bioken  
by landing the cargo iathe United States, pay.  
(ing the deties theteon, and thas fulfilling the Je.  
gal pre requifites to a home confumption ; and,  
therefore, that the cargo was fubje@ to con­  
demnation cven under the Britifh regolation of  
January, 1798, which {o far relaxes the general  
principle as to allow a dire¢d trade between a  
belligerent colony, and a neutral country carry­  
ing on fuch a trade, :  
With refpeét 1o the general principle which  
difsllows to neutral pations in time of war, a  
trade not allowed to them in time of ‘peace, it  
may be obferved. ‘  
Furft, That the principle is of modern date ;  
that it is maintained, as is believed, by no  
other nation but Great. Britain ; and that it  
was aflumed by her under the aufpices of a mar.  
itime affendancy, which rendered fuch a prioci.  
ple fubfervient to her particular intercit. The  
hitory of her regulations on this fubje@, fhews  
that they have been conflantly modified under  
the influence of that confideration. The coarfe  
of thefe modificatioos will be feen in an appen­  
‘dix to the fourth voleme of Robinfon’s Admir­  
alty Report,  
Secondly, That the principle is manifeftly  
contzary to the general intercft of commercial  
mations, as well as 1o the law of nations fettled  
by the moR approved authorities, which recog­  
_nifes no reftraints on the trade of natigos not at  
‘war, with nations at war, other than that it  
fhall be impartial between the latter, that it fhall  
not extend fto certain military articles, nor to  
the tranfportation of perfons in military fervice,  
nor to places a&amp;ually blockaded or beﬁ’e;ed.  
Thirdly, That the principle is the more  
contrary to reafon and to right, in ae much as  
the admifion of neutrals into a colownial trade  
fhut agaioft (hem in times of peace, may, and  
often dces, rvefult from confiderations which  
open 0 ncutrals dire@ chancels of trade wish  
the parent Rate, (hut to them in times of peace,  
the r:pliuy of which latter relaxation is not  
‘known to have been contefted ; and inafmuch as  
&#x27;a commered may be, and frequeatly is opened  
in time of war, between a colony and other  
countries, from confiderations which are not in­  
‘cidentto the wor, and which would produce  
the fame cffet in a time of peace; foch, for ex­  
ample, as 3 failure or diminution of the ordina­  
ty fources of necr flary fupplics, or new taros  
in the courfe of profitable interchanges.  
Fourthly, That it is not caly contrary to  
the prieciples and praflice of other nations, but  
to tge pra&amp;lice of Great-Britain hesfelf, It is  
well known to be her invaluable pradlicein time  
of war, by relaxation in her navigation laws, to  
admit neutrals to trade io chanuels forbidden to  
them in times of peace; and particolasly to  
open her colonial trade both to neutral veflels  
and fupplies, to which. it is fhat io times of  
peace ; and that ore at lealt of ber objcfls, in  
thefe relaxations, is to give to her trade an im.  
munity from capture, to which in her own hands  
it would be fubjefted by the war, &#x27;  
Fifthly, The praltice which has prevailed  
in the Brith domiuvions, fan@ioned by orders  
of council and an a&amp; of palgamut. [39 G. 3.  
¢. §B.] authorifing for Britih fubjecte a dirett  
teade with the enemy, Rill further diminifhes the  
force of her preicotions for depriving v of the  
colonial trade, Thes we fee in Robinfon’s ad­  
miralty reposts Pafim, that dbring the laft war,  
a licenfed commercial intercourfe prevailed be­  
tween Great-Britain and ber enemies, France,  
Spain and Holland, becanfe it comprehended  
articles neceffary for her manufa®ures and h3:&amp;-  
culture ; nomithhnding the effeét g‘w Ln‘  
opening a vent to the furplus prode ’  
the o:b&#x27;en. In‘ 3;. manner &quot;lz::n“ to (u:-.

Zaite .S S

neatrale, But the injuftice and ioconfifßency of  
hee attempt to prefs a fei@ rvle on neutrals, s  
mmm,aup&#x27;.,a by the natwre of the  
tzade which is openly cartied en between the  
  
colonies of Great-Britaia and Spain in the Weft-  
Indies. ‘l&#x27;he mode of it is desailed in the en.  
clofed copy of a letter from &quot; whesein it  
will be feen that American veffcls and casgoes,  
‘afier mo? condemned in Buitifb coarts under  
‘preteoce of illicit commerce, are feat on Britith  
‘account, to the enemies of Great. Britain, if not  
t 0 the very port of the deftinaiion jutertupied  
tvhen they were American property, What re­  
{pe@ can be claimed from others to a do@rine  
}00! only of fo recent an_ origin, and enforced  
wich fo lirtle unitormity, bac which is fo coafpis  
cooully difregarded in pratice by the naiion it­  
felf, which ﬂggndn alone in contending for it ?  
  
Sixthly, It is particulatly worthy of atien.  
tion that the board of commiflioners jointly con­  
ftitoted by the Britith and American govern­  
ments under the feventh article of the ticmy of  
1794 b‘y leferving condemnations of the Briisb  
courts founded on the Britith inftru€iions of  
Navember, 1793, condemned the prineiple,  
that a trade ftorbidden to neutrals in time of  
peace, couid not be opened to them in time of  
war ; on which PICC“(: principle thefe inftruc­  
tions were founded. And as the reverfal could  
be juftified by oo other anthority thao the law  
of nations, by which they were guided, the  
law of nations, according to that joiat tribanal,  
condemns the principle here combatted. Wheth.  
er the Britilh commiffioners concurred in thefe  
reverfals does not appear ; but whether they did  
or did not, the decifion was cqoally binding ;  
and affords 2 precedent which could not be dif­  
refpedted by a like fucceeding tribunal, and  
ought not ro be without great weight with both  
n;nom. in like queftions recasiing betweeo  
them.  
  
On thefe grounds the U. &amp;, may juftly re­  
gard the Britith capiures and condemsarions of  
ncotral trade with colonies of the enemics of  
Great Britain as violations of right ; ard if  
reafon confiftency, or that found policy which  
cannot be at variance with either, be allowed  
the weight which they ought 10 have, the Briifh  
government will feel fufficieot motives to repais  
the wionge done in fuch cafes by its cruifersand  
counrts. ,  
  
But, apart from this general view of the  
fubje€l, 2 refofal to indemmity the fuffecers, in  
the particular cafe of the Aarora, is deftitare  
of every pretext 3 becaufe, in the {econd place,  
the contineity «f her voyage was clearly and  
palpably broken, aod the trade converted into  
a new charalter,  
  
It has been already noted that the Britifh re­  
gulation of 1798, admitsa dire@ trade in time  
of war between a beliigereot coloty and a neu­  
tral coontiy carrying on the tade ; and admics  
confequently the legality of the imporcation by  
the Aurora from tke Havaona to Charlefton.  
Nor has it ever been pretended that a peutral  
nation has not aright 10 re-export to any belli­  
gerent country whatever foreign prodellions,  
nut contraband of war which may have been du­  
ly incorporaied and naturalized, as part of the  
commercial ftock of the country Ye exporting it,  
The queftion then to be decided under rhe  
Britith regalation ivfelf, is, whether in landing  
the cargo, paying the duties, and thus as effeétu.  
ally qualifying the arcicles for the legal confump­  
tion of the country, as if they bhad been its na­  
tive procdactions, they were not at the fame time  
cqually qualified with native produélions for ex­  
portation (0 a foreign market, That fuch  
ought to be the decifion refults irrefiftably from  
the following confiderations.  
4. From the refpeét which is due to the in­  
ternal regulations ofP:my country, where they  
cannot be charged with a temporiziog partiality  
towards particular belligerent parties or with  
fraudulent views towards all of them, ‘The re­  
guiations of the U. S, on thia fubje@®, muft ne  
free from every poffible imputation ; being not  
only fair in theic appearance, but juft in their  
Ptinciplen. and having cootinved the {ame dur­  
ing the periods of war, a» thry weee in thofe of  
peace. It may be added that they probably cor­  
refpond, in every effential feature relating to re­  
exportaiions, with the laws of other commercial  
coubtries, and particularly with thofe of Great  
Brirain, Whe annexed outlire of them, by the  
Secretary of the Treafury, will at once explain  
their charaéler, and fhew that, in the cafe of the  
A.n;\ou. every legal requifite was duly complied  
with,  
  
2. From the impoffibility of fubfti­  
tuting any other admiffible criterion,  
than that of landing the articles, and  
otherwife qualifying them for the ufe  
of the country. “8 this regular and  
cuftomary proceeding, be not a bar­  
rier againit further enquiries, where,  
It may be afked, are the enquiriesto  
ftop? By what evidence are (:‘articu­  
lar articles to be identified on the high  
feas, or before a foreign tribunal ? If  
identified, how is it to be afcertained  
whether they were imported with a  
view to the market at home, or to a  
foreign market, or as ought always  
to be prefumed, to the one or the o­  
ther as it fhould happen to invite ? Or  
it toa foreign market, whether to  
one forbidden or permitted by the  
Britith regulations ?eFor itis to be  
recollefted that among the modifica­  
tions which her polic} has given to be  
general principle afferted by her, a  
dire&amp;t trade is permitted to a neutral  
carrier from a belligerent colony, to  
her ports, as well as to thofe of his  
own country. If, again, the lan;li;g  
of the&#x27;} , and the t of the  
dmiumtt ﬂx!ﬁcientp‘tzm;:eak the  
continuity of the voyage, what, it may  
be alked, is the degree of internal  
  
change or alienation which will have  
that effeét ? May not a claim be fet up  
to rtrace the articles from hand to  
hand, from fhip to fhip, in the fame  
port, and even from one port to ano­  
ther porr, as long as they remain in  
the count? ? Ina word, in departing  
from the iimple criterion provided by  
the country itfelf, for its own legiti- *  
mate and permanent objets, it is ob­  
vious that befides the defalcations  
which might be committed on our _  
carrying trade, pretexts will be given  
to cruifers for endlefs vexations on  
our commerce at large, and that a la.  
titude and delays will accrue in the  
diftant proceedings of admiralty  
courts, ftill more ruinous and intoler­  
able. °  
  
3. From the decifion in the B:iith  
high court of admiralty itlelf, given in  
the cafe of the Polly, Lafky, maiter,  
by a judge delervedly celebrated for  
a profound judgment, which cannot  
be fulpected of learning towards doc­  
trines unjuft or injurious to the rights  
of his own country. On that occa­  
fion he exprefsly declares; ¢ It is not  
my bufinefs to fay what is univerfally  
the teft of a bona fied importation  
it is argued whar it would be fufficient  
that the duties fhould be paid, and  
that the cargo fhould be landed. If  
thefe criteria are not to be reforted  
to, | fhould be at a lofs to know what  
thould be the reft ; and I am ftrongly  
difpofed to hold, that it would be fut­  
ficient, that the goods fhould be land­  
ed and the duties paid.” 2 Rob. Rep.  
p. 368=9. :  
The prefident has thought it proper  
that you fhould be furnifhed with  
fuch a view of the fubjeét as is here  
fketched ; that you may make the ufe  
of it beft fuited to the occafion. Ifthe  
  
trial of the Aurora fhould not be over  
it is queftionable whether the govern.  
ment will interfere with its courts.  
Should the trial be over and the fen­  
tence of the vice-admiralty court at  
St. Johns have been confirmed, you  
are to lofe no time in prefenting to  
the Britith government a reprefenta­  
tion correfponding with the fcope of  
thefe obfervations ; and in urging that  
redrefs in the cale, which is equally  
due to private jullice, to the reafona­  
ble exp¢étations of the Uuited Stares,  
and to that cenfidence and harmony,  
which ought to be cherifhed between  
the two nations.

Department of State, April 12, 1806.  
  
‘¢ THE papers herewith inclofed, explain particularly the cafe of the brig  
Aurora.  
  
‘&lt;The fum of the cafe is, that whilft Spain was at war with Great Britain,  
this veffel, owned by a citizen of the United States, brought a cargo of Span-  
ifh produce, parchafed at the Havana, from that place to Charlefton, where  
the cargo was landed, except an infignificant portion of it, and the duties paid,  
or fecured, according to law, in like manner as they are required to be paid,  
or fecured, on a like cargo, from whatever port, meant for home coniump-  
tion; that the cargo remained on land about three weeks, when it was re-  
fhipped forBarcelona, in old Spain, and the duties drawn back, with a deduc-  
tion of three and a half per cent, as is permitted to imported articles in alf  
cafes, at any time within ene yecr, under certain regulations, which were  
purfued in this cafe ; that the veffel was taken on her voyage by a Britith  
cruifer, and fent for trial to Newfoundland, where the cargo was condemned  
by the court of vice admiralty ; and that the caufe was carried thence, by ap-  
peal, to Great Britain, where it was apprehended that the fentence below  
would not be reverfed.  
  
The ground of this fentence was, and that of its confirmation, if fuch be  
the refult, muft be, that the trade in which the veffel was engaged was un-  
lawful, and this unlawfulnefs muft reft, firft, on the general principle affumed  
by Great Britain, that a trade from a colony to its parent country, being a  
trade not permitted to other nations in time of peace,cannot be made lawful  
to them in tithe of war ; fecondly, onthe allegation that the continuity of  
the voyage from the Havana to Barcelona was not broken by landing the car-  
go in the United States, paying the duties thereon, and thus fulfilling the le-  
gal pre-requifites to a home confumption ; and, therefore, that the cargo  
was fubject to condemnation, even under the Britifth regulation of January,  
1798, which fo far relaxes the general principle as to allow a direct trade be-  
tween a belligerent colony, and a neutral country carrying on fuch a trade.  
  
_ With refpe@ to the general principle which difallows to neutral nations, in  
se of war, a trade not allowed to them in time of peace, it may be obfer-  
ved,  
  
Firft, That the principle is of modern date ; that it is maintained, as-is  
beligved, by no other nation but GreatBritain ; and that it was affumed byher  
under the aufpices of a maritime afcendency, which rendered fuch a principle  
fubfervient to her particular intereft. The hiftory of her regulations on this  
fubject fhews, that they have been conftantly modified under the influence of  
that confideration. The courfe of thefe modifications will be {een in an ap-  
pendix to the fourth volume of Robinfon’s Admiralty Reports.  
  
Secondly, That the prineiple is manifeftly contrary to the general intereft of  
Commercial nations, as well as to the law of nations fettled by the moft ap-  
Proved authorities, which recognizes no reftraints on the trade of nations not  
at war, with nations at war, other than that it fhall be impartial between the

Jatter, that it thall not extend to certain military articles, nor to the tranfpof  
pat: of perfons in military fervice, nor to places actually blockaded or bes  
eped.  
  
Thirdly, That the principle is the more contfary to reafon and to right,  
inafmuch as the admiffion of neutrals into a colonial trade, fhut againft them  
in time of peace, may, and often does, refult from confiderations which open  
to neutrals direct channels of trade with the parent ftate, fhut to them in  
times of peace, the legality of which latte* relaxation is not known to have  
been contefted ; and inafmuch as a commerce may be, and frequently is;  
opened in time of war, between a colony and other countries, from confider-  
ations which are not incident to the war, and which would produce the fame  
effect in a time of peace ; fuch, for example, as a failure, or diminution of  
the ordinary fources of neceffary fupplies, or new turtis in the courfe of pro-  
fitable interchanges.  
  
Fourthly, ‘That it is not only contrary to the principles and practice of  
other nations, but to the pr-ctice of Great-Britain berfelf. It is well known  
to be her invariable practice in time of war, by relaxations in her navigation  
laws, to admit neutrals to trade in channels forbidden to them in times of  
peace ; and particularly to open her colonial trade both to neutral veffels and  
fupplies, to which it is fhut in times of peace 3 and that one at leaft of her  
objects in thefe relaxations, ts to give to her trade an immunity from capture,  
to which in her own hands it would be fubjected by the war.  
  
Fifthly, The practice which has prevailed im the Britifh dominions, fanc-  
  
‘tioned by orders of council and an act of parliament, [S39 G. S. c. 98.] author-  
  
izing for Britifth fubjects a direct trade with the enemy, ftill further diminifhes  
the force of her pretenfions for depriving us of the colonial trade. Thus we  
fee in Robinfon’s Admiralty Reports pafiim, that during the laft war a licenf-  
ed commercial intercourfe prevailed between Great-Britain and her enemies,  
France, Spain and Holland, becaufe it comprehended articles neceffary for her  
manufactures and agriculture ; notwithftanding the effect it had in opening a  
vent to the turplus productions of the others. In this manner fhe affumes to  
fufpend the war itfelf, as to particular objets of trade beneficial to herfelf ;  
whilft fhe denies the right of the other belligerents to fufpend their accuftom-  
ed commercial reftrictions, in favour of neutrals. But the injaftice and incon-  
fiftency of her attempt to prefs a ftri€t rule on neutrals, is more forcibly dif:  
played by the nature of the trade which is openly carried on between the co-  
Jonies of Great-Britain and Spain in the Weift-Indies. The mode of it is de-  
tailed in the inclofed copy of a letter from » wherein it will be  
feen that the American veffels and cargoes, after being condemned in Britifh  
courts, under pretence of illicit commerce, are fent, on Britifh account, to the  
enemies of Great-Britain, if not to the very port of the deftination interrupted  
when they were American property. What refpect can be claimed from  
others te a doctrine not only of forecent an origin, and enforced with fo little  
uniformity,but which is foconfpicuoufly difregarded in practice by the nation  
itfelf, which ftands alone in contending for it ?  
  
Sixthly, It is particularly worthy of attention, that the board of commif-  
fioners jointly conftituted by the Britifh and American governments, undef  
the 7th article of the treaty of 1794, by reverfing cofhdemnations of the Britifh  
courts founded on the Britifh inftructions of November, 1798, condemned  
the principle, that a trade forbidden to neutrals in time of peace, could not be  
opened to them in time of war; on which precife prineiple thefe inftructions  
were founded. And as the reverfal could be juftified by no other authority  
than the law of nations, by which they were guided, the law of nations, accor-  
ding to that joint tribunal,condemns the principle here combatted. Whether  
the Britifh commiffioners concurred in thefe reverfals, does not appear : but  
whether they did or did not, the decifion was equally binding ; and affords a  
precedent which could not be difrefpected by’a like fucceeding tribunal, and  
ought not to be without great weight with beth nations, in like queftions re-  
curring between them.

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS, i?  
  
On thefe grounds, the United States miay juftly regard the Britith captutes  
  
fnd condemnations of neutral trade with colonies of the enemies of Great  
  
Britain, as violations of right ; and if reafon, confiftency, or that found policy  
which cannot be at variance with either, be allowed the weight which they  
eught to have; the Britifh government will feel fufficient motives to repair the  
wrongs done in fuch cafes by its cruizers and courts.  
  
But, apart from this general view of the fubject, a refufal to iridemnify the  
fufferers, in the particular cafe of the Aurora, is deftitute of every pretext 3  
becaule, in the fecond places the continuity of her voyage was clearly and pals  
pably broken, and the trade converted into anew characters _  
  
It has been already noted that the Britifh regulation of 1798, admits a di  
rect tradé in time of war, between a belligerent colony anda neutral country  
carrying on the trade 3 and admits confequently the legality of the importa-  
tion by the Aurora, from the Havanato Charlefton. Nor has it ever been  
pretended that a neutral nation has nota right to re-export to any belligerent  
country whatever foreign productions, not contraband of war, which may  
have been duly incorporated and naturalized,as a part of the commercial ftock  
of the country re-exporting it.  
  
The queftion then to be decided under the Britifh regulation itfelf, is,  
whether in landing the cargo, paying the duties, and thus 4s effectually qual-  
ifying the articles for the legal confumption of the country, as if they had  
been its native productions, they were not at the fame time equally qualified  
with native produétions,for exportation to a foreign market. That tach ought  
to be the decifion, refults irrefiftibly from the following confiderations :  
  
1. From the refpect which is due to the internal regulations of every countrys  
where they cannot be charged with a temporizing partiality towards parti-  
cular belligerent parties, or with fraudulent views towards all of them. The  
regulations of the United States, on this fubject,muft be free from every poffis  
ble itnputation ; being not only fair in their appearance,but juft in their prin-  
ciples,and having continued the fame during the periods of war, as they were  
in thofe of peace. It may be added, that they probably correfpondy in every  
  
‘fential feature relating to re-exportations, with the laws of other commer-  
cial countries, and particularly with thofe of Great-Biitain. The atinexed  
outline of them, by the fecretary of the treafury, will at once explain their cha-  
racter, and fhow that, in the cafe of the Aurora, every legal requifite was duly  
complied with. |  
  
2. From the impofhibility of fubftituting any other admifhible criterion,  
than that of landing the articles, and otherwife qualifying them for the ufe of  
the country. If this regular and cuftomary proceeding, be not a barrier  
againft further inquiries, where, it may be afked, are the inquiries to ftop ?  
By what evidence are particular articles to be identified on the high feas, or  
before a foreign tribunal ? If identified, how is it to be afcertained whether  
they were imported with a view to the market at home, or to a foreign mar-  
ket, ory as ought always to be prefumed, to the one or the other, as it fhould  
happen to invite ? or ifto a foreign market, whether to one forbidden or pers  
mitted by the Britifh regulations ? for it is to be recolleéted that afhong the  
modifications which her policy has given to the general principle aflerted by  
her, a dire trade is permitted toa neutral carrief from a belligerent colony,  
to her ports, as well as to thofe of his own country. If, again, the landing of  
the goods and the payment of the duties be not fufficient to break the contin-  
ulty of the voyage, what, it may be afked, is the degree of internal change  
or alienatien which will have that effet? May nota claim be fet up to  
trace the articles from hand to hand, from fhip to fhip, in the fame port, and  
even from one port to another port, as long as they remain in the country ?  
In a word, ini departing from the fimple criterion provided by the country it-  
felf, for its own legitimate and permanent objects, it is obvious, that befides  
the defalcations which might be committed on our carrying trade, pretexts  
will be given to cruifers for endlefs vexatious on our commerce at large, and

that a latitude and delays will accrae in the diftant proceedings of admiralty  
courts, ftill more ruinous aud intolerable.  
$. From the decifton in the Britifh high court of admiralty itfelf, given in  
‘the cafe ofthe Polly, Lafky, mafter, by a judge defervedly celebrated for a  
profound judgment, which cannot be fufpeCted of leaning towards doétrines  
uojuft or injurious to the rights of his own country. On that occafion he ex-  
prefsly declares ; “ It isnot my bufinefs to fay what is univerfatly the teft of

ties fhould be paid, and that the cargo fhould be landed. If thefe criteria are  
not to be reforted to, I fhould be at a lofs to know what fhould be the teft;  
and Iam ftrongly difpofed to hold, that it would be fufficient that the goods  
fhould be landed and the duties paid.”” 2 Rob. Reports, p. 368-9.  
The prefident has thought it proper that you fhould be furnifhed with fuch

been confirmed, you are to lofe no time in prefenting to the Britith govern  
ment a reprefentation correfponding with the fcope of thefe obfervations ; and  
in urging that redrefs in the cafe, which is equally due to private juftice, to

dated Depfiartment of State, April 12, 1805.  
  
The papers herewith inclosed explain particularly the case of the brig  
Aurora.  
  
The sum of the case is, that, whilst Spain was at war with Great  
Britain, this vessel, owned by a citizen of the United States, brought a  
cargo of Spanish produce, purchased at the Havannah, from that place to  
Charleston, where the cargo was landed, except an insignificant portion

and the duties drawn back, with a deduction of three and a half per cent.,  
as is permitted to imported articles in all cases at any time within one  
year, under certain regulations, which were pursued in this case ; that  
the vessel was taken on her voyage by a British cruiser, and sent for trial  
to Newfoundland, where the cargo was condemned by the court of vice-  
  
admiralty ; and that the cause was carried thence, by appeal, to Great  
  
Britain, where it was apprehended that the sentence below would not be

VIOLATION OF NEUTRAL RIGHTS, &amp;c. 7  
  
The ground of this sentence was, and that of its confirmation, if such  
be the result, must be, that the trade in which the vessel was engaged was  
unlawful, and this unlawfulness must rest, first, on the general principle  
assumed by Great Britain, that a trade from a colony to its parent country,  
being a trade not permitted to other nations in time of peace, cannot be  
made lawful to them in time of war; secondly, on the allegation that the  
continuity of the voyage from the Havannah to Barcelona was not broken  
by landing the cargo in the United States, paying the duties thereon, and  
thus fulfilling the legal pre-requisites to a home consumption ; and, there-  
fore, that the cargo was subject to condemnation even under the British  
regulation of January, 1798, which so far relaxes the general principle as  
to allow a direct trade between a belligerent colony and a neutral country  
carrying on such a trade.  
  
With respect to the general principle, which disallows to neutral na-  
tions, in time of war, a trade not allowed to them in time of peace, it may  
be observed,  
  
First, That the principle is of modern date; that it is maintained, as  
is believed, by no other nation but Great Britain ; and that it was assumed  
by her under the auspicies of a maritime ascendancy, which rendered such  
a principle subservient to her particular interest. The history of her re-  
gulations on this subject shows that they have been constantly modified  
under the influence of that consideration. The course of these modifica-  
tions will be seen in an appendix to the fourth volume of Robinson’s Ad-  
miralty Reports.  
  
Secondly, That the principle is manifestly contrary to the general in-  
terest of commercial nations, as well as to the law of nations settled by  
the most approved authorities, which recognises no restraints on the trade  
of nations not at war, with nations at war, other than that it shall be im-  
partial between the latter, that it shall not extend to certain military arti-  
cles, nor to the transportation of persons in military service, nor to places  
actually blockaded or besieged.  
  
Thirdly, That the principle is the more contrary to reason and to right,  
inasmuch as the admission of neutrals into a colonial trade shut against  
them in times of peace, may, and often does, result from considerations  
which open to neutrals direct channels of trade with the parent state, shut  
to them in times of peace, the legality of which latter relaxation is not  
known to have been contested ; and inasmuch as a commerce may be, and  
frequently is open in time of war, between a colony and other countries,  
from considerations which are not incident to the war, and which would  
produce the same effect in a time of peace ; such, for example, as a fail-  
ure or diminution of the ordinary sources of necessary supplies, or new  
turns in the course of profitable interchanges.  
  
Fourthly, That it is not only contrary to the principles and practice of  
other nations, but to the practice of Great Britain herself. It is wel!  
known to be her invariable practice in time of war, by relaxations in her  
navigation laws, to admit neutrals to trade in channels forbidden to them  
in times of peace ; and particularly to open her colonial trade both to neu-  
tral vessels and supplies, to which it is shut in times of peace ; and that  
one at least of her objects, in these relaxations, is to give to her trade an  
immunity from capture, to which in her own hands it would be subjected  
by the war.  
  
Fifthly, The practice which has prevailed in the British dominions,  
sanctioned by orders of council and an act of parliament [39 G. 3. c. 98.],  
authorising for British subjects a direct trade with the enemy, still further  
diminishes the force of her pretensions for depriving us of the colonial  
trade. Thus we see in Robinson’s Admiralty Reports passim, that during  
the last war, a licensed commercial intercourse prevailed between Great

Britain and her enemies, France, Spain, and Holland, because it compre-  
hended articles necessary for her manufactures and agriculture ; notwith-  
standing the effect it had in opening a vent to the surplus productions of  
the others. In this manner she assumes to suspend the war itself as to par-  
ticular objects ‘of trade beneficial to herself; whilst she denies the right  
of the other belligerents to suspend their accustomed commercial restric-  
tions in favor of neutrals. But the injustice and inconsistency of her at-  
tempt to press a strict rule on neutrals is more forcibly displayed by the  
nature of the trade which is openly carried on between the colonies of  
Great Britain and Spain in the West Indies. The mode of it is detailed  
in the enclosed copy of a letter from » wherein it will be seen that  
American vessels and cargoes, after being condemned in British courts  
under pretence of illicit commerce, are sent on British account, to the  
enemies of Great Britain, if not to the very port of the destination in-  
terrupted when they were American property. What respect can be  
claimed from others to a doctrine not only of so recent an origin, and en-  
forced with so little uniformity, but which is so conspicuously disregarded  
in practice by the nation itself, which stands alone in contending for it ?  
  
Sixthly, It is particularly worthy of attention, that the b@ard of com-  
missioners, jointly constituted by the British and American governments  
under the seventh article of the treaty of 1794, by reversing condemna-  
tions of the British courts founded on the British instructions of Novem-  
ber, 1793, condemned the principle, that a trade forbidden to neutrals in  
time of peace could not be opened to them in time of war; on which  
precise principles these instructions were founded. And as the reversal  
could be justified by no other authority than the law of nations, by which  
they were guided, the law of nations, according to that joint tribunal,  
condemns the principle here combated. Whether the British commission-  
ers concurred in these reversals does not appear: but whether they did  
or did not, the decision was equally binding ; and affords a precedent  
which could not be disrespected by a like succeeding tribunal, and ought  
not to be without great weight with both nations, in like questions recur-  
ring between them.  
  
n these grounds, the United States may justly regard the British cap-  
tures and condemnations of neutral trade with colonies of the enemies of  
Great Britain as violations of right; and if reason, consistency, or that  
sound policy which cannot be at variance with either, be allowed the  
weight which they ought to have, the British government will feel suffi-  
cient motives to repair the wrongs done in such cases by its cruisers and  
courts.  
  
But, apart from this general view of the subject, a refusal to indemnify  
the sufferers, in the particular case of the Aurofa, is destitute of every  
pretext ; because, in the second place, the continuity of her voyage was  
clearly and palpably broken, and the trade converted into a new charac-  
ter. .  
  
It has been already noted, that the British regulation of 1798 admits a  
direct trade in time of war between a belligerent colony and a neutral  
country Carrying on the trade ; and admits consequently the legality of the  
importation by the Aurora from the Havannah to Charleston, Nor has it  
ever been pretended that a neutral nation has not a right to re-export to  
any belligerent country whatever foreign productions, not contraband of  
war, which may have been duly incorporated and naturalized, as part of  
the commercial stock of the country re-exporting it,  
  
The question then to be decided under the British regulation itself is,  
whether in landing the cargo, paying the duties, and thus as effectually  
qualifying the articles for the legal consumption of the country, as if they  
had been its native productions, they were not at the same-time equally  
  
  
  
  
  
VIOLATION OF NEUTRAL RIGHTS, &amp;c. 9  
  
ualified with native productions for exportation to a foreign market.  
Phat such ought to be the decision results irresistibly from the following  
considerations.  
  
1. From the respect which is due to the internal regulations of every  
country, where they cannot be charged with a temporizing partiality to-  
wards particular belligerent parties, or with fraudulent views towards all  
of them. The regulations of the United States on this subject must be  
free from every possible imputation ; being not only fair in their appear-  
ance, but just in their principles, and having continued the same during  
the periods of war, as they were in those of peace. It may be added that  
eae Probably correspond, in every essential feature relating to re-expor-  
tations, with the laws of other commercial countries, and particularly with  
those of Great Britain. The annexed outline of them, by the secretary of  
the treasury, will at once explain their character, and show that, in the  
case of the Aurora, every legal requisite was duly complied with.  
  
2. From the impossibility of substituting any other admissible criterion,  
than that of landing the articles, and otherwise qualifying them for the  
use of the country. If this regular and customary proceeding be not a  
barrier against further enquiries, where, it may be asked, are the enqui-  
ries to stop? By what evidence are particular articles to be identified on  
the high seas, or before a foreign tribunal? If identified, how is it to be  
ascertained whether they were imported with a view to the market at  
home, or to a foreign market, or, as ought always to be presumed, to the  
one or the other as it should happen to invite? Or if toa foreign market,  
whether to one forbidden or permitted by the British regulations? For it  
is to be recollected that among the modifications which her policy has  
given to the general principle asserted by her, a direct trade is permitted  
to a neutral carrier from a belligerent colony, to her ports, as well as to  
those of his own country. If, again, the landing of the goods, and the  
payment of the duties be not sufficient to break the continuity of the  
voyage, what, it may be asked, is the degree of internal change or aliena-  
  
tion which will have that effect? May not a claim be set up to trace the.  
  
articles from hand to hand, from ship to ship, in the same port, and even  
from one port to another port, as long as they remain in the country? In  
a word, in departing from the simple criterion provided by the country it-  
self, for its own legitimate and permanent objects, it is obvious that besides  
the defalcations which might be committed on our carrying trade, pre-  
texts will be given to cruisers for endless vexations on our commerce at  
large, and that a latitude and delays will accrue in the distant proceed-  
ings of admiralty courts, still more ruinous and intolerable.  
  
3. From the decision in the British high court of admiralty itself, given  
in the case of the Polly, Lasky master, by a judge deservedly celebrated  
for a profound judgment, which cannot be suspected of leaning towards  
doctrines unjust or injurious to the rights of his own country. On that  
occasion he expressly declares: “ It is not my business to say what is  
universally the test of a bona fide importation ; it is argued that it would  
be sufficient that the duties should be paid, and that the cargo should be  
landed. If these criteria are not to be resorted to, I should be at a loss  
to know what should be the test ; and I am strongly disposed to hold, that  
it would be sufficient, that the goods should be landed and the duties paid.”  
2 Rob. Rep. p. 368—9.  
  
The president has thought it proper that you should be furnished with  
such a view of the subject as is here sketched; that you make the use  
of it best suited tothe occasion. Ifthe trial of the Aurora should not be  
over, it is questionable whether the government wi interfere with its  
courts. Should the trial be over, and the sentence of the vice-admiralty  
court at St. Johns have been confirmed, you are to lose no time in present

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  
April 12, 1B05.  
0 I K.  
&#x27;Flie papers herewith enclosed, explain  
particularly the case of the brig Aurora.  
The sum of the case is, that whilst Spain  
was at war with Great-Britain, this vessel,  
owned by a citizen of the United States, bro’t  
a cargo oi Spanish produce, purchased at  
the Hat anna, troni that place to Charleston,  
where the cargo was landed, except an in­  
signiticant portion of it, and the duties paid  
01 secured according to law, in like manner  
as they are required to be paid or secured,  
ou a like cargo from whatever port, meant  
for home consumption ; that the cargo re­  
mained on laud about three weeks, when it  
was re-shipped for Barcelona in old Spain,  
and the duties drawn back, with a deducti­  
on of three and a half per cent, as is permit­  
ted to imported articles in all cases, at any  
time within one year, under certain regula­  
tions whicn were pursued in this case; that  
tile vessel was taken on her voyage by a Bri  
tisli cruiser, and sent for trial to Ne wfound­  
land, where the cargo was condemned bv  
the court of vice-admiralty ; and that the  
j cause was carried thence by appeal to  
j ^ * eai-LSi itaiii, where it was apprehended  
! that tiit sentence below would not be rever­  
| sed  
j 1 he ground of this sentence was, and that  
| oi its confirmation, if such be the result  
j must be, that the trade in which the vessel  
I was engaged was unlawful; and this uniuw­  
. fulness must rest, tirst, on the general prin­  
ciple assumed by Great-britain, that a trade  
n om a colony to its parent country, being a  
trade net permitted to other nations in time  
oi peace, cannot be made lawful to them in  
j of war ; secondly, on the allegation that  
; the continuity oi the voyage from the Ha­  
vanna to Barcelona was not oroken b\ land­  
ing the cargo in the United btates, paying the  
duties thereon, and thus lultilnng the leral  
pre-requisites to? home consumption; and,  
thcieloi c, th.it the cargo was subject to con­  
demnation, even under the British regulati­  
on oi January, ir9tf, which so far relaxes  
the general principle as to a.low a direct  
trade between a belligerent colony and a  
neutral country carrying on such a trade.  
&gt;\ i-h iosp&lt;*ct to the general priivciple  
Minch disallows to neutral nations in time of  
war, a trade not allowed to them in time of  
  
.u..et it nmy ue ooscrved,

thi,t it is maintained, as is believed, by noo­  
ti.cr nation but Great-Britain, and that it  
v assumed by her under the auspices of a  
mu -.time ascendancy, which rendered such a  
principle subservient to her particular inte­

subject shews .hat they have been constant&#x27;­  
ly modified unJer the influence of that con­  
sideration. 1 lie course of thesd modificati­  
I ons will be seen in an appendix to the 4th  
volume of Robinson’s Admiralty reports.  
Secondly, that the principle is manifestly  
contrary to the general interest of com mer­  
j cm 1 nations, as well as to the law of nations  
| settled by the most approved authorities,  
j which recognizes no restraints on the trade  
oi nations not at war, with nations at war, o­  
. tlier than it shall be impartial between the  
(latter; that it shall not extend to certain  
military articles, nor to the transportation of  
. Persons on military service, nor to places ac  
tua.ly blockaded or besieged.  
1 hirdly, that the principle is the mores  
omrary to reason and to right, inasmuch al  
(the admission of neutrals in o a colonia  
trade shut against them in times of peace’  
I *1,e legality ol&#x27;which latter relaxation is not  
known to have been contested, and inasmuch  
| as a commerce maybe, and frequently is o­  
j pened in time of war, between a colony and  
i other Countries, from considerations which  
! ar&lt;-‘ nf,t incident to the war, and which  
would produce the same effect in a time of  
i peace; such, for example, as a failure or  
I diminution of the ordinary sources ot neccs­  
, saty supplies, or new turns m the Course of  
I profitable interchanges.  
Pourthly, that it is not only contrary to  
the priucip es and practice of ether nations  
but to the practice of Great-Britain herself.  
It is well known to be her invariable practice  
in time of war, by relaxations in her navi­  
gation laws, to admit neutrals to trade jn  
channels forbidden to them in times of peace  
—and particularly toopenher Colonial trade  
both to neutral vessels and supplies, to which  
it is shut in times of peace, and that one at  
least of her objects in these relaxations, is  
to give to her trade an immunity from Cap­  
ture, to which in her own hands it Would be  
subjected by the war.  
1 fth y. Pie prac,;~e which has prevailed in  
the British dominions, sanctioned by orders of  
&lt; ounci! and an act of parliament, (39 G. 3, &lt;;.  
98) authorising for British subjects a direct  
►ride with the enemy, still further UnTiinishes  
  
the force of her pretensions for depriving us  
of the colonial trade: thus we see in Robin­  
son** Admiralty Reports passim, that during  
the last war a.licensed commercial inter­  
course prevailed between G. Britain and her  
enemies, France, Spain and Holland, -be­  
cause it comprehended articles necessary for  
her manufactures £c agricultui-e, notwithstan­  
ding the effect it had in opening a vent to the  
surplus productions Cf the ethers. In this  
manner she assumes to su&#x27;rpcnd their accus­  
tomed commercial restrictions in favor of  
neutrals. But the injustice and inconsisten­  
cy of her attempt to press a strict rule on  
neutrals is more forcibly displayed by the  
nature of the trade which is openly carried  
on between the colonies of Great Britain and  
Spain in the West-Indies. The mode of it j  
is detailed in the inclosed copy of a letter,  
wherein it will he seen that American vessels •  
and cargoes, after being condemned in Bri- I  
tish courts undcr(pretcnce of illicit commerce,  
are sent on British account to the enemies  
oi Great Britain, if not to the verv port of des­  
tination interrupted when thev were Ameri­  
can property. What respect can be claim- I  
ed from others to a doctrine not only of so  
recent an origin and enforced with so little  
uniformity, but which is so conspicuously dis­  
regarded in practice by the nation itself  
which stands alone in contending for it?  
Sixthly, It is particularly worthy of atten­  
tion, that the board of commissioners jointly  
constituted by the British and American go­  
vernments, under the 7th article of the trea­  
ty- of 1794, by reversing condemnations of the  
British courts founded (on the British in­  
structions of November, 1793, condemned  
the principle that a trade forbidden to neu­  
trals in time of peace, could not be opened to  
them in time of war, on which precise prin­  
cip.e these instructions were founded. And  
as the reversal could be justified by no other  
authority than the law oi nations, by which  
they were to be guided, the law of nations,  
according to that joint tribunal, condemns  
the principle here combated. Whether the  
British commissioners concurred in these  
reversals, does not appear; but whether !  
they did or did not, the decision was equally I  
binding, and affords a precedent which could  
not be disrespected by- a like succeeding tri­  
bunal, and ought not to be without great  
weight with both nations in like questions  
recurring between them.  
tk._ _ V * l «r . .  
  
wiuov me uimeu oiatc3 may  
justly regard the British captures and con­  
demnations of neutral trade with colonies  
of the enemies of Great-Britain, as violations  
of right; and if reason, consistency, or that  
sound policy which cannot be at variance  
with either, be allowed the weight which  
they aught to have, the British government  
will feel sufficient motives to repair the  
wrongs done in such cases by its cruizers  
and courts.  
But, apart from this general view of the  
subject, a refusal to indemnify the sufferers  
in the particular case of the Aurora, is des­  
titute ot every pretext ; because in the se­  
cond place the continuity of her voyage was  
clearly and palpably broken, and the trade  
converted into a new character.  
It lias been already noted that the British  
regulation of U98, admits a direct trade in  
time of war, between a belligerent colony  
and a neutral country, carrying on the trade ;  
(and admits, consequents, the legalitv of the  
j importation by the Anrora, from the Havan­  
I na to Charleston. Nor has it ever been pre­  
tended that a neutral nation has not a right  
to lai-cxport to any belligerent country what­  
ever, foreign productions, not contraband of  
war, which may have been duly incorpora­  
, ted and naturalized, as a part of the com­  
i mcrcial stoc^k of the country re-tlxportincr it.  
The question then to be decided under the  
British regulation itself, is, whether in lan­  
ding the cargo, paying the duties, and thus  
as effectually qualifying the articles for the  
legal consumption of the country, as if they  
had been its native productions, they were  
not at the same time equally qualified with  
\ ,iat*ve productions for re-exportation to a  
foreign market. That such ought to he the  
decision, results irresistibly from the follow­  
ing considerations.  
First, from the respect which is due to  
the internal regulations of every country  
where they cannot be charged with a tem­  
porizing partiality towards particular belli­  
gerent parties, or with fraudulent views to­  
wards all of them. The regulations of the  
United otateS on this subject, must be free  
from every possible imputation ; beinir not  
only fair on their appearance, but just in  
their principles, and having continued  
the same during the&quot; periods of war  
;i Q tn#«U U/nrn In ~ I*__ t . . *  
  
, , ,-,.ii may oe  
added, that they probably correspond, in c­  
very essentsal feature relating to re-expor­  
tations, with the laws of other commercial  
; countries, and particularly with those of  
j ureat-Britain. The annexed •utlinejof them  
:y ti e secretary of the treasury, will at  
i once explain their character, and shew that&#x27;  
«n the case of the Aurora, cVefy legm reqtii­  
| site was duly complied with.  
2d. From the impossibility of substituting  
| any other admissible criterion than that of  
i landing the articles, and otherwise qualify­  
i ing them for the use of the country. If this  
regular and customary proceeding be not a  
barrier against further inquiries, where it  
may be asked, are the inquiries to stop &gt;—  
] By what evidence arc particular articles’ to  
be identified on the high seas, or before a fo­  
reign tribunal &gt; If identified, how is it to be  
ascertained, whether they were imported  
.with a view to the market at home, or to a  
; foreign market; or, as ought always to be  
presumed, to the one or the other as it should  
happen to invite ; or if to a foreign market  
whether to one forbidden or permitted by the  
British regulations; for it is to be rc­  
: collected, that among the modifications  
winch her polity has given to the general  
principle asserted by her, a direct trade is  
permitted to a neutral carrier, from a bel­  
ligerent colony to her ports, as well as to  
those of his own country. If, again, the land­  
ing of the goods and the payment of the du­  
i ties, be not sufficient to break the continuity  
&#x27;of the voyage, what.it may he asked, is the  
degree of internal change nr alienation which  
will have that effect ? May not a claim be  
set up to trace the articles from hand to  
hand, and from ship to ship, in the same port,  
and even from* one port to another port, as  
long as they remain in the country t In a  
word, in departing from the simple criteri­  
on provided by the country itself, for its own  
legitimate and permanant objects, it is ob­  
vious that besides the defalcations which  
might be committed on our carrying trade  
pretext will be givrn to cruize s for endless  
vexations on our commerce at large, and  
that a latitude and delays will accrue in  
the distant proceedings of admiralty courts,  
stdl more ruinous and intolerable.

1 lie President ii-i thought it proper that  
you should he furnished with such a view  
of the subject, as is here sketched&#x27;; that  
you may make the use of it best suited to  
the occasion. If the trial of the. Aurora  
should not be over, it is questionalne whe her  
the goverment will interfere with its courts. I  
Should tile trial be over and the sentence of  
the vice-admiralty courts at St. Johns, have  
been confirmed, you are to lose no time :  
in presenting to the British government  
a representation corresponding with the  
scope of these observations and in urging  
that redress in the case, which is c paal­  
l.v due to private justice, to the reasonable  
expectations of the United States, and to  
that confidence and harmony which ought  
to he cherished between the two nations.  
The effect of the doctrine involved in the  
sentence ol the court in Newfoundland, on  
our carrying trade, will at once be seen by  
you. I he average amount of our re-expor­  
tations for three vears, ending 30th Septem­  
ber, 1803, has been 32,003.y21 dollars. Be­  
sides the mercantile and naigntion profits,  
the average revenue from drawbacks, on  
goods re-exported for three years, ending  
31st December, 1803, is 184,271 dollars, to  
which is to be added, an uncertain but con­  
siderable sum, consisting of duties paid on ar­  
ticles re-exported, after having lost through  
neglect or lapse of time, the privilege of  
crawback. A very considerable portion of  
this branch of trade, with all its advanta­  
ges, will be cutoff, if the formalities herelo­  
lore respected, are not to protect our re-ex­  
portations. Indeed it is difficult to see the ex­  
tent to which the apprehended innovation  
may fie carried in theory, or to estimate the  
mischief which it may produce in practice.  
If Great-Britain, disregarding the precepts  
of justice, suffers herself to calculate the in­  
terest she has in spoliating or abridging our  
commerce by the value of it to the &#x27; ’nited  
States, she ought certainly not to forget that  
the United States must in that case, calculate  
by the same standard, the measures which  
the stake will afford, for counteracting her  
unjust and unfriendly policy.  
I have the honor to be, Sec.
