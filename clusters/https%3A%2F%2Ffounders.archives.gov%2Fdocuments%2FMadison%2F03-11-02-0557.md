Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.  
  
In reviewing the present state of our country, our attention cannot be withheld from the effect produced by peculiar seasons; which have very generally impaired the annual gifts of the Earth, and threaten scarcity in particular districts. Such, however, is the variety of soils, of climates and of products, within our extensive limits, that the aggregate resources for subsistance, are more than sufficient for the aggregate wants. And as far as an economy of consumption, more than usual, may be necessary, our thankfulness is due to Providence for what is far more than a compensation, in the remarkable health which has distinguished the present year.  
Amidst the advantages which have succeeded the peace of Europe and that of the United States with Great Britain, in a general invigoration of industry among us, and in the extension of our commerce, the value of which is more and more disclosing itself to commercial nations; it is to be regretted, that a depression is experienced by particular branches of our  
  
manufactures, and by a portion of our navigation. As the first proceeds, in an essential degree, from an excess of imported merchandize, which carries a check in its own tendency, the cause, in its present extent, cannot be of very long duration. The evil will not, however, be viewed by Congress, without a recollection, that manufacturing establishments, if suffered to sink too low or languish too long, may not revive, after the causes shall have ceased; and that, in the vicissitudes of human affairs, situations may recur, in which a dependance on foreign sources, for indespensable supplies, may be among the most serious embarrassments.  
The depressed state of our navigation is to be ascribed, in a material degree, to its exclusion from the colonial ports of the Nation, most extensively connected with us in commerce, and from the indirect operation of that exclusion.  
Previous to the late convention at London between the United States and Great Britain, the relative state of the navigation laws of the two Countries, growing out of the Treaty of one thousand seven hundred and ninety four, had given to the British navigation a material advantage over the American, in the intercourse between the American ports and British ports in Europe. The Convention of London equalized the laws of the two Countries, relating to those ports; leaving the intercourse between our ports, and the ports of the British colonies, subject, as before, to the respective regulations of the parties. The British Government, enforcing, now, regulations which prohibit a trade between its Colonies and the United States, in American vessels, whilst they permit a trade in British vessels, the American navigation loses accordingly; and the loss is augmented by the advantage which is given to the British competition over the American, in the navigation between our ports and British ports in Europe, by the circuitous voyages enjoyed by the one, and not enjoyed by the other.  
The reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity, applied to one branch of the commercial intercourse, has been pressed on our part, as equally applicable to both branches, but it is ascertained that the British Cabinet declines all negociation on the Subject; with a disavowal, however, of any disposition to view in an unfriendly light; whatever countervailing regulations the United States may oppose, to the regulations of which they complain. The wisdom of the Legislature will decide on the course, which, under these Circumstances, is prescribed by a joint regard to the amicable relations between the two Nations, and to the just interests of the United States.  
I have the satisfaction to state, generally, that we remain in amity with foreign powers.  
An occurrence has, indeed, taken place in the Gulf of Mexico, which, if Sanctioned by the Spanish Government, may make an exception as to that power. According to the report of our naval commander on that Station,  
  
one of our public armed vessels was attacked by an overpowering force, under a spanish commander; and the American flag with the Officers and crew, insulted in a manner calling for prompt reparation. This has been demanded. In the mean time, a Frigate and Smaller vessel of war have been ordered into that Gulf, for the protection of our commerce. It would be improper to omit, that the representative of his Catholic Majesty in the United States, lost no time in giving the strongest assurances, that no hostile order could have emanated from his Government; and that it will be as ready to do as to expect, whatever the nature of the case, and the friendly relations of the two Countries, shall be found to require.  
The posture of our affairs with Algiers, at the present moment, is not known. The Dey, drawing pretexts from circumstances for which the United States were not answerable, addressed a letter to this Government, declaring the Treaty last concluded with him, to have been annulled by our violation of it; and presenting as the alternative, War, or a renewal of the former Treaty, which stipulated, among other things, an annual Tribute. The answer, with an explicit declaration that the United States preferred War to Tribute, required his recognition, and observance of the Treaty last made, which abolishes Tribute, and the Slavery of our Captured Citizens. The result of the answer has not been received. Should he renew his warfare on our Commerce, we rely on the protection it will find, in our naval force actually in the mediterranean.  
With the other Barbary States, our affairs have undergone no change.  
The Indian Tribes within our limits, appear also disposed to remain at peace. From Several of them, purchases of lands have been made, particularly favorable to the wishes and security of our Frontier Settlements; as well as to the general interests of the nation. In some instances, the Titles, tho’ not supported by due proof, and clashing, those of one Tribe with the claims of another, have been extinguished by double purchases; the benevolent policy of the United States prefering the augmented expence, to the hazard of doing injustice; or to the enforcement of justice, against a feeble and untutored people, by means involving or threatening an effusion of blood. I am happy to add, that the tranquillity which has been restored among the Tribes themselves, as well as between them and our own population, will favor the resumption of the work of civilization, which had made an encouraging progress among some Tribes; and that the facility is en creasing, for extending that divided and individual ownership, which exists now in moveable property only, to the Soil itself, and of thus establishing in the culture and improvement of it; the true foundation for a transit from the habits of the Savage, to the arts and comforts of social life.  
As a subject of the highest importance to the National welfare, I must, again, earnestly recommend to the consideration of Congress, a reorganization of the Militia, on a plan which will form it into classes, according to  
  
the periods of life more and less adapted to military services. An efficient Militia is authorised and contemplated by the Constitution, and required by the Spirit and Safety of free government. The present organization of our Militia is universally regarded, as less efficient than it ought to be made, and no organization can be better calculated to give to it, its due force, than a classification which will assign the foremost place, in the defence of the Country, to that portion of its citizens, whose activity and animation best enable them to rally to its Standard. Besides the consideration, that a time of peace is the time when the change can be made with most convenience and equity; it will now be aided by the experience of a recent war, in which the militia bore so interesting a part.  
Congress will call to mind, that no adequate provision has yet been made, for the uniformity of Weights and measures, also contemplated by the Constitution. The great utility of a Standard, fixed in its nature, and founded on the easy rule of decimal proportions, is sufficiently obvious. It led the Government, at an early stage, to preparatory steps for introducing it; and a completion of the work will be a just title to the public gratitude.  
The importance which I have attached to the establishment of a university within this District, on a scale, and for objects, worthy of the American nation, induces me to renew my recommendation of it to the favorable consideration of Congress; And I particularly invite, again, their attention to the expediency of exercising their existing powers, and where necessary, of resorting to the prescribed mode of enlarging them, in order to effectuate a comprehensive system of roads and Canals; such as will have the effect of drawing more closely together every part of our Country, by promoting intercourse and improvements; and by increasing the Share of every part, in the common Stock of National prosperity.  
Occurrencies having taken place which shew that the Statutory provisions for the dispensation of criminal justice, are deficient in relation both to places, and to persons, under the exclusive connuzance of the national authority; an amendment of the law embracing such cases, will merit the earliest attention of the legislature. It will be a Seasonable occasion, also, for enquiring how far, legislative interposition may be further requisite, in providing penalties for offences designated in the constitution or in the statutes, and to which either no penalties are annexed, or none with sufficient certainty. And I submit to the wisdom of Congress, whether a more enlarged revisal of the criminal code be not expedient, for the purpose of mitigating, in certain cases, penalties which were adopted into it; antecedent to experiments and examples which justify and recommend a more lenient policy.  
The United States having been the first to abolish, within the extent of their authority, the transportation of the natives of Africa into slavery, by prohibiting the introduction of slaves, and by punishing their Citizens  
  
participating in the traffic, cannot but be gratified at the progress made by concurrent efforts of other nations, towards a general suppression of so great an evil. They must feel, at the same time, the greater Solicitude, to give the fullest efficacy to their own regulations. With that view, the interposition of Congress appears to be required by the violations and evasions which, it is suggested, are chargeable on unworthy citizens, who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flags, and with foreign ports; and by collusive importations of slaves into the United States thro adjoining ports and territories. I present the subject to Congress, with a full assurance of their disposition to apply all the remedy which can be afforded by an amendment of the law. The regulations which were intended to guard against abuses of a kindred character, in the trade between the Several States, ought also to be rendered more effectual for their humane object.  
To these recommendations, I add for the consideration of Congress, the expediency of a remodification of the judiciary establishment; and of an additional Department in the executive branch of the Government.  
The first is called for by the accruing business, which necessarily swells the duties of the Federal Courts; and by the great and widening space, within which justice is to be dispensed by them. The time Seems to have arrived, which claims for members of the Supreme court, a releif from itenerary fatigues, incompatible as well with the age which a portion of them will always have attained, as with the researches and preparations which are due to their Stations, and to the juridical reputation of their country. And considerations equally cogent, require a more convenient organization of the Subordinate Tribunals, which may be accomplished without an objectionable increase of the number or expence of the Judges.  
The extent and variety of Executive business, also accumulating with the progress of our country and its growing population, call for an additional Department, to be charged with duties now overburdening other Departments, and with such as have not been annexed to any Department.  
The course of experience recommends, as another improvement in the Executive establishment, that the provision for the station of Attorney General, whose residence at the Seat of Government, official connections with it, and management of the public business before the judiciary, preclude an extensive participation in professional emoluments, be made more adequate to his services and his relinquishments; and that with a view to his reasonable accomodation, and to a proper depositary of his official opinions and proceedings, there be included in the provision, the usual appurtenances to a public office.  
In directing the legislative attention to the state of the finances, it is a subject of great gratification to find, that even within the short period which has elapsed since the return of peace, the revenue has far exceeded all the current demands upon the Treasury; and that under any probable  
  
diminution of its future annual products, which the vicissitudes of commerce may occasion, it will afford an ample fund, for the effectual and early extinguishment of the public debt. It has been estimated that during the year One thousand eight hundred and sixteen, the actual receipts of revenue at the Treasury, including the balance at the commencement of the year, and excluding the proceeds of loans and Treasury notes, will amount to about the sum of Forty seven millions of Dollars; that during the same year, the actual payments at the Treasury including the payment of the arrearages of the War Department, as well as the payment of a considerable excess, beyond the annual appropriations, will amount to about the sum of Thirty eight millions of Dollars; and that consequently, at the close of the year, there will be a surplus in the Treasury of about the sum of nine millions of Dollars.  
The operations of the Treasury continue to be obstructed by difficulties, arising from the condition of the National currency; but they have nevertheless been effectual, to a beneficial extent, in the reduction of the public debt, and the establishment of the public credit. The floating debt of treasury notes, and temporary loans, will soon be entirely discharged. The aggregate of the funded debt, composed of debts incurred during the wars one thousand seven hundred and Seventy Six, and one thousand eight hundred and twelve, has been estimated, with reference to the first of January next, at a Sum not exceeding One hundred and ten millions of Dollars. The ordinary annual expences of the Government, for the maintainance of all its institutions, civil, military, and naval, have been estimated at a Sum less than twenty millions of Dollars. And the permanent revenue, to be derived from all the existing sources, has been estimated at a sum of about twenty five millions of Dollars.  
Upon this general view of the subject, it is obvious, that there is only wanting to the fiscal prosperity of the Government, the restoration of an uniform medium of Exchange. The resources and the faith of the nation, displayed in the system which Congress has established, ensure respect and confidence, both at home and abroad. The local accumulations of the revenue have already enabled the Treasury, to meet the public engagements in the local currency of most of the States; and it is expected, that the same cause will produce the same effect, throughout the union. But, for the interests of the community at large, as well as for the purposes of the Treasury, it is essential that the nation should possess a currency of equal value, credit, and use, wherever it may circulate. The Constitution has entrusted Congress, exclusively, with the power of creating and regulating a currency of that description: and the measures which were taken during the last Session, in execution of the power, give every promise of Success. The Bank of the United States has been organised under auspices the most favorable, and cannot fail to be an important auxiliary to those measures.  
  
For a more enlarged view of the public finances, with a view of the measures pursued by the Treasury Department, previous to the resignation of the late Secretary, I transmit an extract from the last report of that officer. Congress will perceive in it, ample proofs of the solid foundation on which the financial prosperity of the nation rests; and will do justice to the distinguished ability and successful exertions, with which the duties of the Department were executed, during a period remarkable for its difficulties and its peculiar perplexities.  
The period of my retiring from the public service being at little distance, I shall find no occasion more proper than the present, for expressing to my fellow Citizens, my deep sense of the continued confidence, and kind support which I have received from them. My grateful recollection of these distinguished marks of their favorable regard, can never cease; and with the consciousness, that if I have not served my Country with greater ability, I have served it with Sincere devotion, will accompany me as a source of unfailing gratification.  
Happily, I shall carry with me from the public Theatre, other sources, which those who love their Country most, will best appreciate. I shall behold it blessed with tranquility and prosperity at home; and with peace and respect abroad. I can indulge the proud reflection, that the American people have reached in safety and success their fortieth year, as an independent nation; that for nearly an entire generation, they have had experience of their present constitution, the offspring of their undisturbed deliberations and of their free choice; that they have found it to bear the trials of adverse as well as prosperous circumstances; to contain in its combination of the federate and elective principles, a reconcilement of public strength with individual liberty, of national power for the defence of national rights, with a security against wars of injustice, of ambition or of vain glory, in the fundamental provision which subjects all questions of war to the will of the nation itself, which is to pay its costs, and feel its calamities. Nor is it less a peculiar felicity of this constitution, So dear to us all, that it is found to be capable, without losing its vital energies, of expanding itself over a spacious territory, with the increase and expansion of the community for whose benefit it was established.  
And may I not be allowed to add to this gratifying Spectacle, that I shall read in the character of the American people, in their devotion to true liberty, and to the constitution which is its palladium, sure presages, that the destined career of my country will exhibit a Government, pursuing the public good as its sole object, and regulating its means by the great principles consecrated in its charter, &amp; by those moral principles, to which they are so well allied: A Government, which watches over the purity of elections, the freedom of speech and of the press, the trial by Jury, and  
  
the equal interdict against enchroachments and compacts, between religion and the State; which maintains inviolably the maxims of public faith, the Security of persons and property, and encourages, in every authorised mode, that general diffusion of knowledge which guarantees to public liberty its permanency, and to those who possess the blessing, the true enjoyment of it: A Government, which avoids intrusions on the internal repose of other Nations, and repels them from its own; which does justice to all nations with a readiness, equal to the firmness with which it requires justice from them; and which, whilst it refines its domestic code from every ingredient not congenial with the precepts of an enlightened age, and the sentiments of a virtuous people, seeks, by appeals to reason, and by its liberal examples, to infuse into the law which governs the civilised world, a Spirit which may diminish the frequency or circumscribe the calamities of war, and meliorate the social and beneficent relations of peace: A Government, in a word, whose conduct within and without, may bespeak the most noble of all ambitions, that of promoting peace on Earth, and good will to man.  
These contemplations, sweetening the remnant of my days, will animate my prayers for the happiness of my beloved Country, and a perpetuity of the Institutions, under which it is enjoyed.

taiM range can he made with most  
convenience and equity, it Will now  
be aided by the experh are of a recent  
wiuy in which the militia bore so in­  
teresting a part.  
Congress will call to mind, that no!  
adequate provision Iras yet hem made,  
for tiie. uniformity of weights ami  
measures, also contemplated by the  
constitution. The great utility of a  
standard, iixed in its nature, and  
founded on the easy rule of decimal  
proportions, is sufficiently obvious.  
It led the government, at an early  
stage, to preparatory steps for intro­  
ducing it; and a completion of the  
work will he a just title to the public  
gratitude.  
The importance which I have at­  
tached to the establishment of a uiii­  
\ersity within tills district, on a scale  
and for objects worthy of the Ameri­  
can nation, induces me to renew my  
recommendation ol itto the favorable  
consideration of congress: And i pai  
licularly invite, again, their attention  
0) the expediency of exercising then I  
listing powers, and, where necessa-i  
  
ry, of resorting to the prescribed mod*  
of enlarging them, in order to effec­  
tuate a comprehensive system of roads  
and canals, such as will have the ef­  
fect of drawing more closely togc­  
therevery part of our country, by  
promoting intercourse and improve­  
ments, and by increasing the share ol  
every part in the common stoc k of na­  
tional prosperity.  
Occurrences having taken place  
which shew that the statutory provi­  
sions for the dispensation of criminal  
justice, are deficient in relation both  
to places and to persons, under the  
exclusive, cognizance of the national  
authority, an amendment of the law,  
embracing such cases, will merit the  
earliest attention of the Legislature.  
It will he a seasonable occasion, al­  
so, for inquiring how far Legislative  
interposition may” he further requisite  
in providing penalties for offences de­  
sihnated m the constitution or in the  
statutes, and to which either no pen­  
alties are annexed, or, none with suf­  
ficient certainty. And. I submit to  
the wisdom of Congress, whether a  
more enlarged re visa! of the criminal  
code be not expedient for the purpose  
ol mitigating, in certain cast&#x27;s, penal­  
lies which were adopted into it, an­  
tecedent to experiments and examples  
which justify and recommend a more  
lenient policy.  
The United States having been&gt;t!ie  
0:-f?t to abolish, within the extent of their  
authority, the transportation of the na­  
tives ot Africa into slavery, by prohibit­  
ion; the introduction of slaves, and by  
punishing their citizens participating in  
die traffic, cannot but be gratified at the  
orogress made by concurrent effort* of  
•»ther nations, towards a general sup­  
  
prrsviMi »*! m, great u:i evu. must  
fee!, a the same time, the greater soli­  
citude to give the fullest efficacy to their  
own regulations. With that view, the  
interposition ol Congress appears to be  
required by the violation and evasions  
which, it is suggested, are chargablc on  
unworthy citizens, who mingle in the  
slave trade under foreign flags, and with  
foreign ports ; and by collusive importa  
tions ol slaves into the United States,  
through adjoining ports and territories —  
I present the subject to Congress with a  
full assurance of their disposition to ap­  
ply ihe remedy which can be afforded  
ny an amendment of the taw. The re*  
;&#x27;d,r?oys which were intended to guard  
against abuses of a kindred character, in  
the trad&quot; between the several scales,  
ought al-o to be reede ed more effectual  
for their humane object,  
j To these recommendations l add, for  
tiic consideration of Congress, the expe­  
tiemey of a re-modification of die Judi­  
ciary establishment, and of an additi »nai  
department in iLe executive brunch ui  
the government.  
The first is called for by tlia accruing  
business which necessarily swells the du  
lies td the federal comts: and hv the*  
great and widening space, between which  
jr ticc is to be dispensed by them. The  
time seems to have arrived which claims  
lor members ol the Supreme Coin t a  
relief from itinerary fatigues, inemnpaii  
Mo, as well with the age which a portion  
‘ffthem will always have attained, a;

pi u--. Eion, the usual appurtenances to a  
j. uhlic office.  
In directing the legislative attention to  
ir.e - tale of the finances, it isu subject ot  
gi»at g» at ideation to find, that, even!  
ukhin the short period which ha* elapsed!  
since the return of peace, the revenue!  
nas iar exceeded ail the current demands j  
upon tnc treasury, and that, under any&#x27;  
probable diminution of it? future a-.nuaij  
pro(Jui** which the vicissitudes of com­  
merce may occasion, it will atfoid an am­  
ple fund for the effectual and early ex­  
tinguishment ol the public debt, it has  
been estimated, that du.ing the yearlSlti  
the actual receipts of revenue ai the trea­  
u:y, including the balance at the com  
aieuceiuent ol the veai, and excluding  
me proceeds of loans and treasury note*,  
ill amount to about the sum of lurfv  
veu millions of dollars ; that during the  
m e yeai, the actual payments at the!  
* - eu.-mry including the payment of the*  
arrearages of the War Depaitment, a^j  
  
1 well as the payment of a considerable  
. ‘xcess, beyond ^he annual appropriation*  
i . ill amount to about the ail in of thirty  
eight millions of dollars, and that con  
equently, at the close of the year the* ■  
will be a surplus in the treasury of abou  
the sum of nine tnillons of dollars.  
The operations of the treasury con  
tinue to be obstructed bv difiicullieb,  
arising tram the condition bf the natiooa  
currency 5 but they haie, nevertheless  
been effectual, to a benificia! extent, in  
‘he reduction of the public debt, and the  
establishment of the public credit. Tlu*  
floating debtol treasury notes aid tem­  
porary loans, will soon be entirely dis  
charged. The aggregate of the funded  
debt, composed of debts incurred dui-i. _  
the wars ot 1776 and of 1812. has been  
estimated, with reference to the first of  
January next, at a sum not exceeding ore  
hundred and ten millions of dollars. Tht  
ordinary annual expences of the govern  
ment, for the maintenance of all its insti  
tutions, civil, military, and naval, hu\.  
been estimated at a sum lest, than twenty  
millions ot dollars. And the permanen  
revenue to be derived from all the exist  
ing sources, lias been estimated at a sun  
of about twenty five millions of Julia: s.  
Upon this general view of the sobj»&lt;  
it is obvious, that there is only wanting,  
to the fiscal prosperity of tin- govenmit-v  
ihe restoration of an uniform medium

Ptlloxu citizens of the Senate,  
and t]f the House oj liefu esentatlva,  
In reviewing the present state o­  
our country, our attention cannot In­  
withheld from the tIf -r1 produced  
by political seasons which have very I  
generally impaired the annual gilts ol  
the caitb, and tineaten scarci’y in par  
ricular districts. Such, however, is th  
variety of soils, ol climates, and of pro  
ducts, within our extensive limits, t&#x27; i  
the aggregate resources for subsist­  
ence, arc more than sufficient for the  
*£gr- ga c wants. And as lar r.s on e­  
economy ol&#x27; consumption, more ilian  
usual, in y he necessary, our thatikitr -  
ness is due to Providence, for what is  
tar more than a compensation, in the  
remarkable health which has distin  
guidied the present year.  
Amidst the advantages vhtch-have  
su receded the peace ol Europe, ; mi  
ol the United Str.tes with Great P.ii­  
tain, in ;» general i- vigor«tic-n of indus­  
try umo:i;» us, and in tlu* extension i­  
  
more ami more disclosing itself toe &gt;h&gt;­  
meiciai nations, it is to he icgrett*.  
that a - depression i* *Kpcrtrnved f.y  
particular bi inches ot our manuf n  
lures, and by a portion o&gt; ou’ navigi  
tion. As the first p- ocecds, in an rssr t:  
tial degree, from an excess . f import  
cd mcichandizn which carries a cheer  
in its own tendency, the cause, in i:  
present extent, cannot be of v» ty loot  
duration. The evil wi I not, hovven  
be viewed by Congress. without a ••  
collection, that manufacturing es’ablish  
incntH, if sufl&#x27; reti to sink too to*.,  
languish too long may • .t rev-v , a(»: :  
ihe causes shall have, ceased ; and tha&#x27;  
in the vicissitudes of uuinan afT-tiis, sit  
nations may rctur, in which a depend  
ance on foreign sources, for indispen  
sable supplies, may lie among the most  
serious eoibarrasatneo&#x27;s.  
rite depressed state of our miga  
li m is to he ascribed, inia matciial de  
gree, to its exclusion from the colru i  
parts cf the nation most extensively  
connect vl with us in commerce, and  
from ttie indirect Operation of that ev  
elusion.  
Previous to the late convention a  
London, between the United States  
End Great Britain, ihe relative state ol  
the naviga i- n laws of the two cou i­  
tries, growing out of the treaty &lt;1 1794  
had given the British navigation a ma­  
terial advantage over the American, in  
the intercourse between the American  
ports and British ports in Europe. Tin  
convention of Lor,dan equalized tlie  
laws tf the two countries, relating to  
loose ports; leaving the in&#x27;.etcoursc  
between our ports and &#x27;.he pos&#x27;.s of the  
British colonies, subject, as before, to  
the respective regulation** of the par­  
ties. 1 lie British government enfor­  
cing. now- regulations which prohibit  
atiarlc between its colonies am! the  
United Sides, in American vessels,  
Will it they perm t a trade in British  
vessels, the American navigation loses  
accordingly; and the loss is nugtuen’eU  
by the advantage which .s given to the I  
British competition over the American,  
in the navigation between our ports and  
British ports tn Europe, by the circuit­  
ous voyages, enjoyed bv the one. and  
  
not enjoyed by the other  
The resonablcnc3s of the rule of re­  
ciprocity, pplied to one branch of the  
commercial interoouse.ltas been press  
ed on our part, as equally applicable to  
both bran&#x27; lies : but it is ascertained,  
that the II iti*»!i Cabinet declines all  
negocirimi on the subject ; with a tbs  
avowal, however, of any disposition to  
view, in an util*.iendlv light, wlnt^ver  
countervailing regulations the Untied  
States tiny oppose to tl»o ’’epuln.ions of  
which City cj npljin, The wisdom of  
the Lej51sl.it u&quot;C will decile oti the  
course, wnich, under these circtiw&quot;tnn*  
CCS, is piescribcd by a i nnt regard to  
the amicable relations between the two  
netions and to the just interests of me  
United States.  
I have the satisfaction to staid, gc- i  
terally, that we remain in amity with  
foreign powers &lt;  
An occnrrcnce l.ss, indeed, taken 1  
place in tiie Guiph of Mexico, winch  
i *1 sanctioned oy the Spanish govern­  
ment, may make an exception as to that 1  
power. According the report of our ‘  
naval coni under, on that station, one  
of our public armed vpssels was attack  
ed by an over-powermg farce, under a 1  
Spanish commander, and the American  
flig; with the &lt;&gt;fltccr»and crew,insulted, *  
in a manner calling for prompt repir*. i  
tiou rifis his been demanded. In 1  
the mean time a frigate and smalic. «  
vessel of war havft been urd red ii,« I  
that Guiph, for the protection of  
commerce. I» would be improper  
omit, that the icpvcsenlat ve .•» ins L  
thoiic Majesty, u the United Siaiet  
lost no time in giving the a’.ronget&gt;t as­  
  
iuranccs, that no hostile order could  
iave emanated from l»i* government,  
tml that it will be as ready to do, as to  
xpect, whatever the nature of the case,  
.nd the friendly relarons ol the two  
onntries, will be found to require.  
1 he posture of our affairs with Al  
riers, at the present moment, is not  
mown. The Dvy, drawing pretext*  
irom *. ircumstances, for which the Uni  
:ed States were not answerable, ad  
Ircsscd a letter to this government, de­  
claring the treaty last concluded with  
him, to have been annulled by our vio  
lation of it ; and presenting, ns the al­  
ternative. wsr, or a renewal of the for  
mcr treaty, which stipulated, among  
other t&#x27; ings, an annual tribute. The  
iiiswcr. with an explicit declaration  
1 iiat the United S&#x27;etes pVelerted war tn

observance of ll.e ivt.a&#x27;v last m tic.

Should he renew his warfete on our  
coinnicrcc, \vc rely on the protection it  
will find in our naval force actually m

As a subject ol the highest import­  
ance to the national wplfare, 1 mug a  
gain earnestly recommend to the consi­  
deration of congress, a re-oi g.iniz ition  
oi the Militia, on a plan which will  
•ornt it into classes, according io the  
,i »iods of lile more or less adapted to  
■Tiiliraty services An efficient militia  
is u-honsed and com. mpLied*by the  
. ons-titutioo, and required by the spirit  
and salety ol tree government, l he  
present organization of our militia is  
universally regarded as k-as efficient  
nan it ought to be made ; and no orga­  
ization can be better calculated to give  
to it ns clue force, than a classification  
which will assign the foremost place in  
the defence of the country to that por­  
tion of its citizens, whose activity and  
animation best enable them to rally to  
its standard. Besides the considers  
lion that a &lt;ime of fpeace is the time  
when the change can be madb with the  
most convenience and equity, it will  
now be aided by the experience of arc  
cent war, in w hich the militia bore so  
interesting a part.  
Congress will call to mind, that no a  
deqciate provision has yet been made lor  
the Ullifu-&#x27;Otiiy of weights jml measure1.  
jiso contemplated by the constitution  
I hc great utility of a standard, fixed in  
its natu: e, and founded on the easy rule  
of decimal proportions, is sufficiently  
obvious It led the government at an  
early stale, to preparatory stens for m  
  
troducing it ; and a completion of the  
woik witi be a jujt titla to uie public  
grati&#x27;uilc  
The importance ••&#x27;hich I have attach  
r&lt;d to the establishment ul a U-nversity  
within this District, on a scjIc and lor  
objects worthy ot he American union,  
induce? me ta renew nay ncomtnenJa­  
Uon of it to the favorable consideration  
&gt;f Congress s And I particularly invite  
their attention to the exp. diency  
• exercising thetr existing powers,and  
where necessary, of resorting to tin;  
|)resciibed mode of enlarging them, in  
jrd-T to cfT.-ciu.ile a comprehensive  
jystcni of roads and canals, such as will  
invc the effect of d- awing more closely  
;ogetli«tr cv sry part o! our ccuntry, b­  
yiuirioiing inicicourse and improve  
runts, and by increasing the sin re oi  
;very part in 1 lie common stock of na  
ional prosperity.  
Occuricnces having taken place which  
fitf-.v that the »ia&#x27;U o y provisions loi  
lie dispensation ol criminal justice are  
icficieut 111 relation both to places and  
o persons under the exclusive cogm­  
tjuce of the national authority ; an a­  
nendnunt of me law embracing such  
mscSf will merit the earliest attcniiot  
&gt;1 the legislature. It will be a season  
•Is occasion, also, for inquiring how fa  
egisiativc imcipcsitim may be fuuhei  
cqjisite in providing penalties for o  
cnees Uesigm ed in the constitution v  
• ,)c staiuics, and to which either no  
i-n d.ies arc annexed, or none wit  
• (Violent certainty. And I submit tc  
lie wisdom of congress,whether a more  
iitiargcd revival oi the ctiminal code be  
  
hot expedient* for the purp-te of niiti•

the interposition of Congresi appears  
to be required, by the violations und c­  
vasions which, it is suggested, arc  
chargeable on unworthy ci:»z^ns who  
mingle in the s’ave trade under foreign  
fl*gs, and with foreign ports; and by  
collusive importations of slaves into the  
United States through adjoining ports  
and territoiics. I present the subject  
o Congress, with » full assurance of  
1 heir disposition to apply all the reme  
■ ly which can be afforded by an amend­  
•»ient of the law. The regulations which  
were intended to guard against abuses  
o! a kindred &#x27; harac.ter, in the trade be  
tween tlie several states, ought also to  
be rendered more effectual for their  
humane object.  
To these recommendations, T add,  
for the consideration of Congress, the  
expediency of a re-mo&#x27;lifieT.mn of the  
judiciary establishment, a.n| o! an addi­  
tional department in tlie F.xecu ivu  
branch of the government.  
1 he fn st is t ailed for by the a^cuiog  
business, which necessarily swells the  
duties of the Federal Courts, .m&lt;l by  
  
which justice is to be displayed b.­  
.hem the time seems to have arriv  
od, which claims tor r embers ol th&#x27;­  
supreme court a relief fi091 itinerary  
ungues, incompatible as will withriu  
a,.-e wli ch a portion of thtm will al­  
ways have attained, as vith the re  
searches and preparatio s which art  
due to their stations, and the juridical  
reputation of their count&#x27;j. And con  
■“derations equally cogent require a  
nume convenient organization of th  
ubo!tiinaic tribunals, which may be  
accomplished without an objectionable  
increase t f the numbsr or expence of  
the judges.  
The extent anti varirty of executive­  
business also accumulating with the  
progress of nur country, and i s gtow  
mg population, call fur an additional  
department to be charged with duties  
now overburdening other dcpm tments.  
ani with such as have not been annex­  
ed lo any department.  
1 he course of experience recom­  
mends us another improvement in the  
executive establishment, that the pro­  
vision lor the sta.ion of Attorney gene­  
ral, whose residence at |ne seat ol go­  
vernment, official connexions with it,  
and management of the public busi&#x27;  
ness before the judiciary}, preclude an  
extensive participation ii) professional  
emoluments, be made* npre adequate  
to his services and his rcknquishineiits  
—and that, with a view to his reasona­  
ble accommodation and tds p oper de  
pvsitory of his official opinions and  
proceedings, there be included in the  
provision the usual appurtenances to a  
public office.  
In directing the legisla ive attention  
;0 the state of the finances, it is a su&#x27; »  
j &quot;Ct of great gratification jo find, even  
within theshou period wn/ehiias elap  
sed since the return of price the reve­  
nue has 4ar exceeded ait tie current  
demands upon the treasury, and tha,,  
tinder any probable diminution of i.s  
luture annual product, whten the yicis  
siludes of commctce may occasion, n  
will afford an ample fund lor the tffec­  
  
.uai ana cany extinguishment ol i!ie  
public debt. It has betn estimated,  
mat during the year 1816, the aciUui  
.ccrif.ua ol revenue at tho treasury in*  
eluding the balance at the commence*  
mei.t of the year, and excluding the  
proceeds of loans and treasury cotes,  
will amount to about the sum ol tori)  
*even millions of dollars; that during  
he same year the actual payments at  
the treasary including the puymt; t ol.  
the arrearages of the war department*  
us well as the payment of a considera­  
ble excess beyond the annual appropri­  
tion. will amount to about the sum oi  
thirty eight millions nf dollars.  
The operations of the treasury con  
tinuc to be obstructed by di.1i . ulues, a­  
• ising from the condition of the nation  
al currency ; but they have neverttu  
less, been tftcctual, to s hen&gt;TiciaUx­  
■ent, in the reduction of the public  
da .t, and the establishment of the pu »  
‘ic credit. The floating debt of trea  
oiry notes and tem;»»rar)&#x27; leans, will  
soon be entirely discharged. 1&#x27;he age  
gregarc „F the funded doit, compose  
•t debts incurred during the war# ol  
1775 and of 1812, has been estimated  
with reference to tile first ol January  
ex&#x27;, at a sum not exceeding one bun  
lred ar.d ten millions of dollars The  
t ilinsrv annua! cxpsnccs of the govern  
nent, to: the maintenance of all i&#x27;» in  
ilU’iom, civil, mlttaiy. Aftd naval,  
•ave been estimated at a surti ler.s than  
&quot;cn*v millions ol dollars. And the  
»&#x27; rmament revenue, to be derived Iron  
d the existing sources, has been esti­  
mated at a sum of about t\venty*6vc  
muttons of dollars.  
  
Upon this general view of the sub­  
ect, it is obvious, that there is cnly  
ranting to the fiscal prosperity o! ibe  
;ove&#x27;rnment, the restoration of an uni  
nrm medium of exchange. The re  
ources and the faith of the nation, dis.  
dayed in the system which congres hn6  
stablishcd, ensure respect and c.onfi­  
Icnce botli at home and abroad. The  
ocal accumulations of the revenue have  
ilreariy enabled the treasury to meet  
he public engagements in the local  
:urrency of most of the states ; and it  
s expected that the same cati6e will  
iruduce the same effect, throughout  
he union. Hat for the interests of the  
immunity at laigc, ;»3 well as for the  
purposes of the treasury, it is essential  
.bat the nation should possess a cur­  
&quot;ency of equal value, credit, and use  
wherever it may ciiculate. The con  
itiiuiion ha* entrusted congress, ex  
ilusively, with t|,o power of creating  
*nd regulating a currency of that des  
sription ; and the measures which  
were taken during the last session, in  
execution of the power, give every  
promise of success. The bank of the  
United States has been organised un­  
der auspices the most favorable, and  
cannot fail to be an important auxiliary  
’o those measures.  
I‘,&gt;r » more enlarged view of the pub­  
lic fin a ices, with a view of the meas­

Fcllow-C&#x27;itizens o f the Senate,  
awl of the ll&gt;&lt;us, of Jfepresentatires.  
IN reviewing the present state of our  
country, our attention cannot be withheld  
from theeffect produced by peculiar sea­  
sons, which have very generally impaired  
the annual gifts of the earth, and threaten  
scarcity in particular districts. Such,  
however, is the variety of soils, of cli­  
mates, and of the products, within our  
extensive limits, that the aggregate re­  
sources for subsistence, are more than  
sufficient for the aggregate wants. And  
as far as an economy of consumption,  
more than usual, may be necessary, our  
  
man mu mess is nne to i roviaeiice, lor &#x27;  
what is far more than a compensation,  
in the remarkable health which lias dis­  
tinguished the present year.  
Amidst the advantages which have suc­  
cepded the peace of Europe, and that of  
the United States with Great Britain, in  
a general invigoration of industry among  
us, ami in the extension of ourcommerce,  
the value of which is more and more dis­  
closing itself to commercial nations, it is  
to be regretted that a depression is expe­  
rienced by particular branches of ou.- ma­  
nufactures, and by a portion ofour navi­  
gation. As the first proceeds, in an es­  
sential degree,from an excess of imported  
merchandize, which carricsa check, in its  
own tendency, the cause, in its present  
extent, cannot he of very long duration..  
The evil will not, however, be viewed by  
Congress, without a recollection, that  
manufacturing establishments, if suffered  
to sink too low, or languish too long, may  
not revive, after the causes shall have  
ceased; and that, in the vicissitudes of  
human affairs, situations may recur, in  
which a dependence on foreign sources,  
for indispensable supplies may be among  
the most serious embarrassments.  
Tin:depressed state of our navigation  
is to be ascribed, in a material degree, to  
its exclusion from the colonial parts ofthe  
nation most extensively connected with  
us in commerce, and from the indirect  
operation ofthnt exclusion.  
Previous to the late convention at Lon­  
don, between the United States &amp; Great  
Britain, the relative state ofthe navigation  
laws of the two countries, growing out of  
the treaty of 1794, had given to the Brit­  
ish navigation a material advantage over  
the American, in the intercourse between  
the American ports and the British ports  
in Europe. The convention of London  
equalized the laws of the tuo countries,  
relating to those ports; leaving the inter­  
course between our ports and the ports of  
the British colonies, subject, as before,  
to the respective regulations of the par­  
ties. The British government, enforcing  
now, regulations which prohibit a trade  
between its colonies &amp; the United States  
in American vessels, whilst they permit a  
trade in British vessels, the American  
navigation loses accordingly ; and the  
loss is augmented by the advantage which  
is given to the British competition over  
the American in flic navigation be.  
tween onr ports and British ports in  
Europe, by the circuitous voyages, enjoy­  
ed by the one, and not enjoyed by the  
  
other.  
The reasonableness of the rule of reci­  
procity, applied to one branch of the com­  
mercial intercourse, has been pressed on  
our part, as equally applicable to both  
branches: but it is ascertained, that the  
British Cabinet declines all negotiation  
on the subject; with a disavowal, howe­  
ver, of any disposition to view, in an un­  
friendly light, whatever countervailing re -  
gulations the United States may oppose  
to the regulations of which they complain.  
The wisdom ofthe Legislature will decide  
on the course, which, under lliesc cir­  
cumstances, is prescribed by a joint re­  
gard to the amicable relations between the  
two nations, and to the fist&#x27; interests of  
the United -States.  
I have the satisfaction to state, gener­  
ally, that we. remain in amity with foreign  
powers.  
An occurrence has, indeed, taken place  
in the Gulf of Mexico, which il sanction­  
ed by the Spanish government, may make  
an exception as to that power. Accord­  
ing to the report of our naval commander,  
on that station, one of our public armed  
vessels Mas attacked by an overpowering  
force, under a Spanish commander, and  
the American flag, with the officers and  
crew, insulted, in a manner calling for  
prompt reparation. This has been de­  
manded. In the mean time, a frigate and  
smaller vessel of war have hern ordered  
into that Gulf, for the protection of our  
commerce. It would he improper to o­  
mit, that the representative of his Catho­  
lic Majesty, in the United States, lost no  
time in giving the strongest assurances,  
that no hostile order could have emanated  
from.his government, and that it will be  
as ready to do, as to expect, whatever  
the nature of the case, and the friendly  
relations of the two countries, shall be  
found to require.  
File posture of our affairs with Algiers,  
at the present moment, is not known.-r­  
The Dev, drawing pretexts from oircum­  
stances, for which the United States we/a  
not answerable, addressed a letter to this  
  
by our violation oj it; ami pvcsontliij, sis  
the alternative, war, or a renewal of ”the  
former treaty, which stipulated among  
other tilings, an a mi mil tribute. The an­  
swer, with mi explicit declaration that the  
United &#x27;States preferred war to tribute,  
required Itisrecognition and observance of  
tin. treatvlast made, which abolishes tri­  
bute, ami the slavery of our captured ci­  
tizens. l’he result of the answer lias not  
been received. Should lie renew his war­  
fare on our commerce, we reh on the  
protection it w ill Hud in our naval torce  
actually in the Mediterranean.  
V/it&#x27;i the other Barbary states, our af­  
fairs iuive unde; gone no change.  
1 he Indian tribes within our limits ap­  
pear also disposed to remain at peace.—  
From several of them purchases of lauds  
have been made, particularly favorable  
to the wishes and security ofour frontier  
settlements ; as well as to the general in­  
terests of the nation. In some instan­  
ces. the titles, though not supported In  
due proof, and clashing those of one  
tribe with the claims of another, have  
been extinguished by double purchases;  
the benevolent policy oft lie United States  
preferring the augmented expense to the  
hazard of doing injustice; or to the en­  
forcement ofjnstice, against a feeble and  
untutored people, b* means involvingor  
threatening an effusion of blood. I am  
happy to add. that the tranquility which  
has been restored among the tribes them­  
selves, as well as between them and our  
owirpopulatinn. will favor the resumption  
of the work ofeivilization, which had made  
an encouraging progress among some  
tribes; and that the facility is increasing,  
for extending that divided and individual  
ownership, whit h exists now in moveable  
property only to the soil itself; ami of  
thus establishing in the culture and im­  
provement of it, the true foundation fora  
transit from the habits of the* savage, to  
the arts and comforts of social life.  
As a subject of the highest importance  
to the national weltare, I must, again, ear­  
nestly recommend to the consideration of  
Congress, a re-organization of the .Militia,  
on a plan w hich will form it into classes,  
according to the periods of life more anil  
less adapted to military services. An ef­  
ficient militia is authorised and contem­  
plated by the constitution, and required  
by the spirit and safety of free govern­  
rum I TIip nrpsiMil *»r &lt;mr  
  
militia is universally regarded as less ef­  
ficient than it might to lie made ; and no  
organization can lie better calculated to  
give to it its floe force, than a classificati­  
on, which will assign the foremost place  
in the defence of the country, to that por­  
tion of its citizens, whose activity and an­  
imation best enable them to rally to its  
standard. Besides tin* consideration that  
a time of pea re is the time v. hen the change  
can he made with the most convenience  
ami equity, it w ill now be aided by t lie ex­  
perience ofa recent war, in which the mi­  
litia bore so interesting a part.  
Congress will call to mind, that no ad­  
equate provision has been made for the  
uniformity of weights and measures, also  
contemplated by the constitution. The  
great utility of a standard, fixed in its  
nature, and founded on the easy rule of  
decimal proportions, is sullki ntly obvi­  
ous. It ied the government,-at an early  
stage, to preparatory steps for introducing  
it; arid a completion of the work will be  
a just title to the public gratitude.  
The importance w hich 1 have attached  
to the establishment of an University  
within this District, on a scale and for  
objects worthy of the American nation,in­  
duces me to renew iny recommendation  
of it, to the favorable consideration of  
Congress: And I particularly invite again  
their attention to the expediency of ex­  
ercising their existing powers, and where  
necessary, of resorting to the prescribed  
mode of enlarging them, in order to effec­  
tuate a comprehensive system of roads  
and canals, such as will have the effect of  
drawing more closely together every part  
of onr country, by promoting intercourse  
and improvements, and by increasing the  
share of every part in the i ouimon stock  
of national prosperity.  
Occurrences having taken place which  
shew that the statutory provisions for the  
dispensation of criminal justice, are defi­  
cient in relation both to places and to per­  
sons, under the exclusive cognizanee of  
the national authority; an amendment of  
the law, embracing such cases, will merit  
the earliest attention of the legislature.—  
If will be a seasonable occasion, also, for  
inquiring how far legislative interposition  
may be further requisite in providing pe­  
nalties for offences designated in thecon­  
stitution or in the statutes, and to which  
either no penalties arc annexed, or none  
with sufficient certainty. And I submit  
to t lie wisdom of Congress, whether a  
more enlarged revisa I of the criminal code  
tin iml ov rw. I inn t five tlio numoeA /»!■*  
  
gating, in certain cases, penalties which  
were adopted into it antecedent to expe­  
riments and examples which justify and  
recommend a more lenient policy.  
The United States having been llie  
first to abolish within the extent of their  
authority, the transportation ofthe na­  
tives of Africa into slavery, by prohibit­  
ing tlie introduction of slaves, and by  
punishing their citizens participating in  
the traffic, cannot but be gratified at the  
progress made by concurrent efforts of  
other nations, towards a general suppres­  
sion of so great an evil. They must feel,  
at the same time, llie greater solicitude,  
to giv e the fullest efficacy to 1 heir own  
regulations. With that view, the. inter­  
position of Congress appears to be re­  
quired, by the violations and evasions  
which, it is suggested, are chargeable on  
unworthy citizens who mingle in the  
slave trade under foreign flags, and with  
foreign ports; and by collusive impor­  
tations of slaves into the United Stales,  
through adjoining ports mid territories. I  
| present the subject to Congress, with a  
I full assurance of their disposition to ap  
jdv all the remedy which can lie afforded  
!*y an amendment ofthe law. &#x27;J heregu­  
I lutions which were intended to guard a  
j gainst abuses of a kindred character, in  
the trade between the several stales  
■ ought also to be rendered more ctfectua  
for their humane object.  
To these recommendations, I add, foi  
flic consideration of Congress, the expc  
dicncy of a re-modification ofthe judicia  
ry establishment, and of an additional de  
partment in the Executive branch of tin  
I government.  
The first is called for by the accruin;  
j business, which necessarily swells th  
| duties of the Federal Courts, and bv th  
great and widening space, within v. hicl  
justice is fo be dispensed by them. Th  
;itnc seems to have arrived, which claim  
for members of the Supreme Court a rr  
lief from itinerary fatigues, incotnoat  
ble, as well wiih the age which a portio  
O^lto^ntnnjiAyiVMhsivpaJhxMipJa^wil  
  
| are due •.ottv.r sfatnm«, and fo the juri­  
; dical reputations* of their country. And  
consideration equally cogent, require-a  
more convenient [Jnrguiii/Htioii of a4ie  
subordinate tribunals, which may lie

linquishments; and that, with a view to  
his reasonable accommodation, and to a  
proper depository of his official opinions  
and proceedings, there he included in the  
provision, the usual appurtenances to a  
public office.  
In directing tlie legislative attention to the  
state of the finances, it is a subnet of great  
gratification to find, that, even w ithin the short  
period which has elapsed since the return of  
peace, the revenue lias far exceeded nil the  
current demands upon the treasury, and iti.it,  
under any probable diminiitionof its future uu­  
nu il product, which the vicissitudes of coin,  
uierccmay occasion, it will afford an ample  
fund tor the effuctu tl and carl v extiuguish­  
in*‘nt of the public d&gt; bt. It lias been estima­  
ted, that during the year I81(&gt;, tire actual re­  
ceipts of revenue at the tieasiuy, including  
the balance at the commencement*of the ve.tr,  
and excluding the proceeds of loans and trea­  
sury notes, w ill amount to about t bo sum of for­  
ty-sevmi millions of dollars ; that during the  
some year, the actual payments at the Treasu­  
ry including the payment of the arrearages of  
the M ar Department, as well as the payment  
ot a considerable excess beyond the annual  
appropriation, will amount to about the sum  
ot thirty-eight millions of dollars ; and that,  
consequently, at the close of the vear, there  
willbe a surplus in the treasury ofabout the  
sum of nine millions of dollars.  
&#x27;1 he operations of tiie treasury continue to  
be obstructed by difficulties, arising from the  
condition of the national currency; but, they  
have, never! lieless, been effort mil loo Imruin­  
  
ci.il extent, in the re luction of the public debt  
and tlie establishment of the public credit.—  
The floating debt of treasury notes, and tem­  
porary loan-, will soou be entirely discharged.  
The aggregate of the funded debt, composed  
of debts incurred during the wars of 177C» and  
1812, has been estimated, with reference to  
the first of January next, at a sum not exceed­  
ing one hundred and ten millions of dollars.—  
The ordinary annual expcncesof the govern­  
ment, for the, maintenance of ail its instituti­  
ons, civil, military and naval, have been »-xti­  
■uated at a sum lessthun twenty millions of dol­  
lars. And the permanent revenue, to he deri­  
ved from all tlie existing sources, lias been es­  
timated at a sum of about twenty-five millions  
of dollars.  
Upon this general view oftlie subject, it is  
obvious, that there is only wanting, to thefi-eal  
prosperity of the government, the restoration  
of an uniform medium of exchange. The resour •  
ces .V faith of the nation, displayed in the  
system which Congresshas established, en­  
sure respect and confidence both at home,  
and abroad. The local accumulations of the  
revenue have idready unabled the treasury to  
meet the public engagements in the local cur­  
rency of most of the states ; and it is expect­  
ed that the same cause will produce the same  
elt&#x27;ect, throughout tIn* union. Hut, for the in­  
terests of the community at large, as well as  
for the purposes of the treasury, it is essential  
thattlie nation should possess a cut renev of e­  
qual value, credit and use, wherever it mav  
circulate. The constitution has entrusted Con­  
gress. exclusively, with the power of creating  
and &gt; • gulutinga currency of that description :  
and the measures which wore taken, during  
the last session, in execution of the power, give  
every promise of suceo-s. The Hank of the  
United States has been organised under auspi­  
ces, tiie most favorable, and cannot fail to be  
an important auxiliary to those measures.  
Fora more enlarged view of the public finan­  
ces, with a view of the measures pursued by  
the Treasury Department, previous to the re­  
signation of the late Secretary, 1 trail- init an ex­  
tract, from the last report of that officer. Con­  
gress will perceive in&#x27;it, ample proofs of the  
solid foundation on which the financial pros­  
perity of the nation rests: an i will do justice  
to the distinguished ability and successful ex­  
ertions with which the duties of the depart­  
ment were executed, during a period remark­  
able for its diliicnitics and its peculiar perplex­  
ities.  
The period of my retiring from t lie public  
service, heirig at a little distance, I shall find  
no occasion riiorc proper than the present, for  
expressing to mv fellow-citizens, my deep  
sense of the continued confidence and kind  
support which I have received from them.—  
My grateful recollection of these distinguished  
marks of their favorable regard, can never  
cease; and,with the consciousness, tiiat if I  
have not served my country with greater ahili­  
ity, I have served it with a sincere devotion,  
will accompany me as a source of unfailing  
gratification.  
Happily, I «hdi carry with me from the pub­  
lic theatre, othei sources, which those who love  
their country most, will best appreciate, i  
shall behold it blessed with tranquility and  
  
pect abroad. I can indulge the proud reflec­  
tion, that the American people have reached in  
safety and auci ess, their fortieth year ns an in­  
dependent nation ; tint for nearly an entire  
generation, they have had experience of their  
present constitution, the offspring of their un­  
disturbed deliberations, and of their free  
choice that they have, found it to bear the  
trials ot adverse, as well as prosperous circum­  
stances, to contain, in its combination ot&#x27; the  
federate and elective principles, a reconcile­  
ment of public strength with individual liberty,  
of national power for the defence of national  
rights, with a security against wars of injus­  
tice, of ambition,or of vain glory, in the funda­  
mental provision which subjects all questions  
of war, to t lie will of the nation itself, which is  
to pay its costs anil feel its calamities. Nor is  
it less a peculiar felicity of this constitution so  
dear tons all, that it is found to be capable,  
without losing its vital energies, of expanding  
itself over a Spacious territory, with the in­  
crease (V expansion of the community for whose  
benefit it M as established.  
And may I not be allowed to add to this gra­  
tifying spectacle, that 1 shall read, iuthe char­  
acter of the Anieri&#x27; unpeople, in their devotion  
to true liberty,and to the constitution which is  
its palladium*, sure presages, that the destined  
career of my country will exhibit a government  
pursuing the public good »• its sole object; and  
regulating its means by the great principles  
consecrated in its charter, and by those moral  
principles to which they arc so well allied : A  
government which watches over the purity of  
elections, the freedom of speech and of the  
press, the trial by jury, and the equal interdict  
against encroachments and compacts between  
religion and the state, v. hicli maintains inviola­  
bly the maxims of public faith, the security of  
, persons and property, mid encourages in every  
authorised mode that general diffusion of know­  
ledge, which guar.nitres to public liberty its  
permanency, and to those who possess the  
- blessing the true, enjoyment of it : A govern­  
. mrnt, which avoids intrusltrty; on the internal  
repose of other nuCufis, nod repels them from  
its own ; which docs justice to all notions with  
r a readiness equal to the Annuc-s with which i1  
j requires justice from th&lt;in : and which, whiM

Fellow Citizens of the Senate und  
House of Representatives,  
  
In reviewing the present state of our country,  
our attention cannot be withheld from the e:Fect  
produced by peculiar seasons, which have very  
generally impaired the annual gifts of the earih,  
and threatened scarcity in particular districts. —  
Such, however, is the varicty of soils, of climates,  
and of products, within our extensive limits, that  
the aggregute resources for subsistence are more  
than sufficient for the aygeregate wants. And as  
jar as an economy of consumption, more than  
usual, may be necessary, our thankfulness is due  
to Providence, for what is far more than «a com-  
pensation, in the remarkable health which has  
distinguished the present year.  
  
Amidst the advantages which have succeeded  
the peace of Europe, and that of the U. States  
with Great Britain, in a general invigoration of  
industry among us, and in the extension of our  
commerce, the value of which is more and more  
disclosing itself to commercial nations, it is to be  
regretted that a depression is experienced by par-  
ticulzr branches of our manufactures, and by a  
sortion of our navigation. As the first proceeds,  
in an essential degree, from an excess of import-  
ed merchandize, Which carries a check in its own  
tendency, the cause, in its present extent, cannot  
be of very long duration. The evil will not,  
however be viewed by congress, without a recollec-  
tion, that manufacturing establishments, if suf-  
fered to sink too low, or languish too long, may  
not revive, after the causes shall have ceased ;—  
and that, in the vicissitudes of human affsirs, si-  
tuations may recur, in which a dependence on fo-  
reign sources, for indispensable supplies, may be  
among the most serious embarrassments.  
  
The depressed state of our navigation, is to be  
scribed, ina material degree, to its exclusion  
from the colonial ports of the nation most exten-  
sively connected with us in commerce, and from  
the indirect operation of that exclusign.  
  
Previous to the late convention at London, be-  
‘ween the U. States and Great Britain, the rela-  
‘ive state of the navigation laws of the two coun-  
tries, growing out of the treaty of 1794, had given  
to the British navigation a material advantag¢  
over the American, in the intercourse between  
the American ports and British ports in Europe.

The convention of London equalized the laws of  
the two countries, relating to those ports ; leaving  
the intercourse between our ports and the ports  
of the Britisi: colonies, supject, as before, to the  
respeciive regulations of the parties. ‘The Bri-  
tish government, enforcing, now, regulations  
which prohibit a trade between its colonies and  
the U. States, in American vessels, whilst they  
permit a trade in British vessels, the American  
navigation loses accordingly ; and the loss is aug-  
mented by the advantage which is given to the  
British competition over the American, in the  
navigation between our ports and British ports in  
Enrope, by the circuitous voyages, enjuyed by the  
one, and not enjoyed by the other.  
  
The reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity,  
applied to one branch of the commercial inter-  
course, has been pressed on our part, as equally  
applicable to both branches: but it is ascertained.  
that te Biilisii Cabinet declines all negocistion  
onthe subiect; with a ciisavowal, nowever, ofany  
disposition te view, in ad unfriendly tight, what-  
ever countervailing regulations the U. States may  
oppose io the regulations of which they com-  
plasr. The wisdom of tie legisiature will decide  
Oi tie Course, which, under these circumstances,  
is prescribed by a joint regard to the amicable re  
Jauions between the two nations and to the just  
interests of the U. States.  
  
I have the satisfaction to state, generally, that  
we remain inamiiy with foreign powers.  
  
Anceccurrence hes, indeed, taken place in the  
Gulf of Mesico, which, if sanctioned by the Spa-  
nisi government, may make an exception as to  
that power. According to the report of our na-  
val commaider on that station, one of our public  
arned vessels was attacked by an overpower-  
ing force, under a Spanish commander, and the  
American flag, with the officers and crew, insult-  
ec, in a manner calling tor prompt reparation—  
This has been demanded. In the mean time, «  
friv ate and smaller vessel of war have been order-  
ed into that Gulf, for the protection of our com-  
merece. Jt would be improper to omit, that the  
ry) oentative of his Catholic Majesty, in the  
U. St:tes, lost no time in giving the strongest as-  
surances, that no hostile order could have emanat-  
ed from his government, and that it will be as  
realy to do, as to expect, whatever the nature of  
the case, and the friendly relations of the two coun-  
tries, shall be found to require.  
  
The posture of our affuirs with Algiers, at the  
prescnt moment, isnotknown. The Dev, drawing  
pre-exts from circumstances for which the United  
States were not answerable, xaddressed a letter to  
this government, declaring the treaty last con-  
cluled with him, to have been annulled by our  
Violation of it; and presenting, as the alternative,  
War, or » renewol of the foriner treaty, which sti-  
pulated, among other things, an annual tribute.—  
Theanswer, with an explicit declaration that the  
United States preferred war to tribute, required  
his recognition and observance of the treaty las:  
made, which abolishes tribute, and the slavery of  
our captured citizens. The result of the answer  
has not been received. Should he renew his war-  
fare on our commerce, we rely on the protection  
itwill find in our naval force actually in the Me-  
dite: ranean,  
  
With the other Barbary states our affairs have  
Wuergone no change.

so disposed to remain at peace. From several of  
them purcnases of lands have been made, p.rticus  
larly favorable to the wishes and security oi our  
frontier settlements, as well as to the general in-  
terests of the nation. In some instances, the ti-  
ties, though not supported by due proof, and  
clashing those of one tribe with the claims ofano-  
ther, have been extinguished by double purcha-  
ses; the benevolent policy of the U. States pre-  
ferring the augmented expense, to the hazard of  
duing injustice, or to the enforcement of justice  
against a feeble and untutored people, by means  
involving or threatening an effusion of blood. 1  
am happy to add, that the tranquility which has  
veen restored among tie tribes themselves, as  
well as between them and our own population,  
will favor the resumption of tie work of civiliza-  
iion, Which had mate an encouraging progress  
among some tribes; and that the facility is in-  
creasiy, for extending that divided and individu-  
al ownership, which exists now in moveable pro-  
perty only, to the soil itself. and of thus esta-  
vlishing, in the culture and improvement of it,  
the true foundation for a transit from the habits of  
the savage, to the arts and comforts of social life.  
  
As a subject of the highest importance to the  
national weifure, T must, agai , earnestly recom  
mend to the consideration of Congress, a reorga-  
nization of the Militia, on a plan which will form  
it into classes, according to the periods of life  
more and iess adapted to military serviees. An  
cilicient militia is authorized and contemplated  
by the constitution, and required by the spirit and  
safety of free government. ‘The present organi-  
zation of cur militia is universally regarced as  
less efficient than it ought to be made; and no  
organization can be better calculated to give to  
it its due force, than a classification which will  
assign the foremost place in the defence of the  
country, to that portion of its citizens, whose ac-  
tivity and animation best enable them to raily to  
its standard. Besides the consideration that a  
time of peace is tie time when the change can be  
made with most couvenience and equity, it will  
now be aided by the experience of a recent war,  
in which the militia bore so interesting a part.  
  
Congress wili call to mind, that no adequate  
provision has yet been made, for the uniformity  
of weights and measures, also contemplated by  
the constitution. The great utility of a standard,  
fixed in its nature, and founded on the easv rule  
of decimal propor.ions, is sufficiently obv.ous. It  
led the government, at an carly stage, to prepa-  
ratory steps for introducing it; and a completion  
of the work will be a just title to the public gra-  
titude.  
  
‘The importance which I have attached to the  
estublisi:ment of a University within this District,  
on a scale, and for objects worthy of the Ameri-  
can nation, induces me to renew my recommenda-  
tion of it to the favorable consideration of Con-  
gress: And I particularly invite, again, their at-  
tention to the expediency of exercising their ex-  
isting powers, and, where necessary, of resorting  
to the prescribed mode of enlarging them, in or-  
der to effectuate a comprehensive system of rouds  
and conals, such as will have the effect of draw-  
ing more closely together every part of our coun-  
try, by promoting intercourse and improvements,  
and by incressing the share of every part in the  
common stock of national prosperity.

The operations of the treasury continue to be  
obstructed by difficulties, arising from the con-  
dition of the nationsl currency; but they have,  
nevertheless, been effectual, to a beneficial ex-

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
Fellow-citizens of the senate,  
and of the house of representatives,  
  
In reviewing the present state of our country,  
eur attention cannot be withheld from the effect  
produced from peculiar seasons, which have very  
generally inpaired the annual gifts of the earth, and  
threaten scarcity in particular districts. Such how-  
ever, is the variety of soils, of climates, and of pro-  
ducts within our extensive limits, that the aggre-  
gate resources for subsistence are more than suffi-  
sient for the aggregate wants. And as far as an  
economy of consumption, more than usual, may be  
necessary, our thankfulness is due to Providence,  
for what is far more than a compensation, in the re-  
markable heaith which has distingwished the present  
year.  
  
Amidst the advantages which have succeeded  
the peace of Europe, and that of the United States  
with Great Britain, in a general invigoration of in-  
dustry among us, anc in the extension of our com-  
merce, the value of which is more and more disclos-  
ing itself to commercial nations, it is to be regret-  
ted that a depression is experienced by particular  
branches of our manufactures, and by a portion of  
our navigation. As the first proceeds, in an essen-  
tial degree, from an excess of imported merchan-  
elize, which carries a check in its own tendency, the  
eause, in its present extent, cannot be of very long  
duration. The evil will not however, be viewed by  
congress, without a recollection, that manufactur-  
ing establishments, if suffered to sink too low, or  
languish too long, may not revive, after the causes  
shall have ceased; and that in the vicissitudes of  
human affairs, situations may recur, in which a de-  
  
The depressed state of our navigation, is to be  
ascribed, in a material degree, to its exclusion from  
the colonial ports of the nation most extensively  
connected with us in commerce, and from the indi-  
rect operation of that exclusion.  
  
:Previous to the convention at London, between  
the United States and Great Britain, the relative  
state of the navigation laws of the two countries,  
growing ott of the treaty of 1794, had given to the  
British navigation a material advantage over the  
American, in the intercourse between the American  
ports and British ports in Europe. The convention  
of London equalized the laws of the two countries,  
relating to those ports; leaving the intercourse be.  
tween our ports and the ports of the British colo-  
nies, subject, as before, to the respective regula-  
tions of the parties. The British government, en-  
forcing, now, regulations which prohibit a trade  
between its colonies and the United States, in Ames  
rican vessels, whilst they permit a trade in British  
vessels, the American navigation suffers aceording-  
ly; and the loss is augmented by the advantage  
which is given to the British competition over the  
American, in the navigation between our ports and  
British ports in Europe, by the circuitous voyages,  
enjoyed by the one, and not enjoyed by the other.  
  
The reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity,  
applied to one branch of the commercial intercourse,  
has been pressed on our part, as equally applicable  
to both branches: but it is ascertained, that the  
British cabinet declines all negociation on the sub  
ject; with a disavowal, however, of any disposition  
to view, in an unfriendly light, whatever counter:  
vailing regulations the United States may oppose to  
the regulations of which they complain. The wis-  
dom of the legislature will decide on the course,  
which, under these circumstances, is prescribed by  
a joint regard to the amicable relations between the  
two nations, and to the just interests of the United  
States.  
  
I have the satisfaction to state, generally, that we  
remain in amity with foreign powers.  
  
Anoccurrence has, indeed, taken place in the Gulf  
of Mexico, which, if sanctioned by the Spanish gos  
vernment, may make an exception as to that power.  
According to the report of our naval commander  
on that station, one of our public armed vesseis was  
attacked by an overpowering force, under a Spanish

the statutory provisions for the dispensation of cri-

position may be further requisite in providing penal-

and its growing population, call for an additional  
department, to be charged with duties now overbar-  
dening other departments, and with such as have  
not been annexed to any department.  
  
The course of experience recommends, as ano-  
ther improvement in.the executive establishment,  
that the provision for the station of attorney gene-  
ral, whose residence at the seat of government,  
oficial connections with it, and management of  
the public business before the judiciary, preclude  
an extensive participation in professional emolu-  
ments, be made more adequate to his services and  
his relinquishments; and that, with a view to his  
reasonable accommodation, and {to a proper de-  
pository of his official opinions and proceedings,  
there be included in the provision, the usual ap-  
purtenances to a public office.  
  
In directing the legislative attention to the state  
of the finances, it is a subject of great gratification  
to find, that, even within the short period which  
has elapsed since the return of peace, the revenue  
has far exceeded all the cursent demands upon the  
treasury, and that, under any probable diminution  
of its future annual product, which the vicissitudes  
of commerce may occasion, it will afford an ample  
fund for the effectual and early extinguishment of  
  
  
  
the public debt. It has been estimated, that during  
the year 1816, the actual receipts of revenue at the;  
treasury, including the balance at the commence-,  
ment of the year, and excluding the proceeds of;  
loans and treasury notes, will amount to about the  
sum of forty-seven millions of dollars; that during  
the same year, the actual payments at the treasury  
including the payment of the arrearages of the war  
department, as well as the payment of a considera-  
ble excess, beyond the annual appropriations, will  
amount to about the sum of thirty-eight millions of  
doliars; and that, consequently, at the close of the  
year, there will be a surplus in the treasury of about  
the sum of nine millions of dollars.  
  
‘The operations of the treasury continue to be  
ebdstructed by difficulties, arising from the condi-  
tion of the national currency; but they have neverthe-  
less, been effectual, to a beneficial extent, in the re-  
duction of the public debt, and the establishment  
of the public credit. The floating debt of treasury  
notes and temporary loans, will goan be entirely  
discharged. ‘The aggregate of the funded debt,  
composed of debts incurred during the wars of 1776  
and of 1812, has been estimated, with reference to  
the first of January next, at asum not exceeding  
ene hundred and ten millions of dollars. ‘The  
ordinary annual expences of the government, for  
the maintenance of all its institutions, civil, military,  
and naval, have been estimated at a sum less than  
twenty millions of dollars. And the permanent  
revenue, to be derived from all the existing sources,  
has been estimated at a sum of about twenty five)  
millions of dollars.  
  
Upon this general view ef the subject, it is’  
obvious, that there is only wanting, to the fiscal|  
prosperity of the government, the restoration of|  
an uniform medium of exchange. Vhe resources  
and the faith of the nation, displayed in the system  
which congress has established, ensure respect and  
confidence at shome and abroad. ‘The local ac-|  
eumulations of the revenue have already enabled |  
the treasury to mect the public engagements in,  
the local currency of most of the states : and it is|  
axpected that the same cause will produce the}  
same effect, throughout the union. But, for the|  
interests of the community at Ireye, as well as for  
the purposes of the treasury, it is essential that!  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
the nation should possess a currency of equal va-  
lue, credit and use, wherever it may circulate. The  
constitution has entrusted congress, exclusively,  
with the power of creating and regulating a curren-  
cy of that description; and the measures which  
were taken during the last session, in execution of  
the power, give every promise of success. ‘The  
bank of the United States has been organized un-  
der auspices the most favorable, and cannot fail to  
be an important auxiliary to those measures.  
  
B,. or a more enlarged view of the public finances,  
with a view of the measures pursued by the treasu-  
ry department, previous to the resignation of the  
late secretary, I transmit an extract from the last  
report of that officer. Congress will perceive in it  
ample proots of the solid foundation on which the  
financial prosperity of the nation rests; and will do  
justice to the distinguished ability and successful  
exertions with which the duties of the department  
were executed, during a period remarkable for its  
difficulties and its peculiar perplexities.  
  
Lhe period of my retiring from the public servicé  
being at little distance, L shall find no occasion  
more proper than the present, for expressing to  
my fellow-citizens my deep sense of the continued  
confidence and kind support which I have received  
from them. My grateful recollection of these distin-  
guished marks of their favorable regard can never  
cease; and with the consciousness, that if I have not  
served my country with greater ability, Lhave served  
it with a sincere devotion, will accompany mie as a  
source of unfailing gratification.  
  
Happily, I shalt carry with me from the public  
theatre other sources, which those who love their  
country most, will best appreciate. I shail pehoid  
it blessed with tranquility and prosperity at home;  
and with peace and respect abroad. I can induige  
the proud reflection, that the American people have  
reached, in safety and success, their fortieth year  
as an independent nation; that, for an entire gene-  
ration, they have had experience of their present  
constitution, the offspring of their undisturbed de-  
liberations and of their free choice; that they have  
found it to bear the trials of adverse as well as  
prosperous circumstances; to contain, in its eombi-  
nation of the federate and elective principles, a  
reconcilement of public strength with individual  
liberty, of national power for the defence of na-  
tional rights, with a security against wars of injus-  
tice, of ambition, or of vain glory, in the finda-  
mental provision, which subjects all questions of  
war to the willof the nation itseif{ which is to pay  
its costs and feel its calamities. Nor is it less a  
peculiar felicity of this constitution, so dear to us  
all, that it is found to be capable, without losing its  
vital energies, of expanding itself over a spacious  
territory, with thé increase and expansion of the  
community for whose benefit it was established.  
  
And may T not be allowed to add to this grati-  
fying spectacle, that T shall read the character of  
the American people, in their devotion to true tis  
berty, and to the constitution, which is its palla-  
dium, sure presages, that the destined career of  
my country will exhibit a government pursuing the  
public good as its sole object, and regulating: its  
meas by the great principles consecrated in its  
charter, and by those moral principles to which they  
are so weil allied: A government which watcics  
over the purity of elections, the freedoin of speech  
and of the press, the trial by jury, and the equal

Feilow citizens of the Senate,  
antdof the House of Representatives,  
  
In reviewing the present state of our coun-  
try, our attention cannot be withheld from  
the effect produced by peculiar seasons,  
which have very generally impaired the an-  
nual cifts of the earth, and threatened scarei-  
ty in partret jar districts. Such, however, is  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
the variety of soils, of climates, and of pro-  
ducts, within our extensive limits, that the  
aggregate resources for subsistence, are more  
than sufficient for the aggregate wants. And  
as far as an economy of cousunmylion, more  
than usual, may be necessary, our thankiul-  
  
ness is due to Providence, for what is far  
more than a compensation, in the remarkable  
health which has distinguished the present  
  
year.  
Amidst the advantages which have suc-  
  
ceeded the peace of Europe, and that of the  
United States with Great Britain, in a gen-  
eral invigoration of industry among us, and  
in the extension of our commerce, the value  
of which is more and more disclosing itself to  
commercial nations, it is to be regretted that a  
depression | is experienced by particular  
branches 0° our manufactures, and by a por-  
tion of our navigation. &lt;As the first proceeds  
in an essential degree, from an excess of im-  
ported merchandize,  
in its own tendency, the case, in its present  
extent, cannot be of very long duration.—  
The evil will not, however, be viewed by  
congress, Without a recollection, that man-  
ufacturing establishments, if suffered fo sink  
too low, or languish too long, may not revive,  
after the causes Shall have ceased ; and that,  
in the vicissitudes of human affairs, situa-  
tions may recur, in which a dependance on  
foreign sources,  
inay be among  
rassments.  
  
The depressed state of our navigation is  
io be ascribed, in a material degree, to its ex-  
clusion from the colonial porls of the nation  
most extensively connected with us in com-  
merce, and from the indirect operation of  
that exclusion.  
  
Previous to the late convention at Lon-  
don, between ‘the United States and Great  
Britain, the relative state ofthe navigation  
laws of the two countries, giowing out of the  
treaty of 1794, had civen to the British nav-  
igation a inaterial advantage over the Amer-  
ican, inthe intercourse between the Ameri-  
can ports and British ports in Europe. ‘he  
convention of London equalized the laws of}

before, to the respective regulations of the par- |  
  
ties. The British government, enforcing,  
now, regulations which prohioits a trade be-  
‘ween its colonies and the United States, in  
  
American vessels, whilst they permit a trade  
in British vessels, the American navigation  
loses accordingly ; and the logs is augmented

The reasonableness of the rule of recipro-  
city, applied to ene branch of the commer-  
cial intercourse, has been’ pressed on our  
part, as equally applicable to both branches ; 5  
but it is ascertained, that the British cabinet  
declines all negociation on the subject: with  
a disavowal, however, of any dispogition to  
view, in an unfriendly light, whatever coun-  
tervailing regulations the United States  
may oppose to the regulations of which they  
complain. ‘The wisdom of the Legjglature  
will decide on the course, which, unde? these  
circumstances, is prescribed by a joint regard  
to the amicable relations between the two  
nations, and to tbe just interests of the U.  
States.  
  
I have the satisfaction to state, generally,  
that we remain in amity with foreign powers.  
  
An occurrence has, indeed, taken place in  
the Guif Mexico, which, if sanctiqeed by the  
Spanish government, may make an excep-  
tion as fo that power. According to the re-  
port of our naval commander on that station,  
one of our public armed vessels was attacked  
by an overpowering force, under a Spanish  
commander, and the American flag with the  
officers and crew, insulted in a manner call-  
ing for prompt reparation. This has been  
demanded. Inthe mean time, a frigate and  
a smaller vessel of war have been ordered in-  
to that Gulf, fer the protectien of our com-  
merce. It wouid be improper to omit, that  
the representafiv e of his Catholic Majesty,  
in the United States, lost no time in giving  
the strongest assurances, that no heltile order  
could have emanated from his covermment,  
and that it will be as ready to do, as to ex-  
vect, whatever the nature of the case, and  
the friendly relations of the two countries,  
shall be found to require.  
  
‘he posture of our affairs with Algiers, at  
the present moment, is not known. I&#x27;he  
Dey, drawing pretexis from cireumstances  
for which the United States were not answer-  
able, addressed a letter to this government.  
declaring the treaty last coneluded with him,  
to have been annulled by our violation of if ;  
and presenting, as the alfernative, war, or a  
renewal of the former treaty, which stipulat-  
ted, among other things, an annual tribute.—  
‘The answer, with an explicit declaration that  
the United Siates preferred war to tribute,  
required bis recognition and observance of  
the treaty last made, which abolishes tribute  
and the slavery of our captured citizens.—  
The result of the answer has not been re-  
ceived. Should he renew his warfare on our  
commerce, we rely on the protection it will  
find in our naval force actually in the Med-

of justi¢e, acainst a feeble and untutored  
people, by means involving or threatning an

the tranquility which has been restored among  
the tribes themselves, as wellas between them  
and our own population, will favor the resump-  
tion of the work of civilization, which had  
made an encouraging progress among some  
fribes ; and that the facility is increasing,  
fer extending that divided and Individua!  
ownership, which exisis now in moveable  
property only, to the soil itself; and of thus  
establishing in the culture and improvement  
of it, the true foundation for a transit from  
the habits of the savage, to the arts and com-  
forts of soeial life.  
  
Asa subject of the highest importance to  
ie national welfare, I must, again earnestly  
recommend to the consideration of Congress,  
a re-orginization of the militia, on a plan  
which will form it into classes, according to  
the periods of life more and less adapted to  
military services. An efficient uiilifia  
anthorised and contemplated hy the constitu-  
tton, and required by the spirit and safety of  
free government. ‘The present orcanizatioa  
doer militia is universally regaried as less |  
efficient than if ought to be made; and no}  
  
‘anization can be better caleulated to give |  
to it its due force, than a elassifiention which |  
will assign the foremost place in the defence |  
of the country, to that portion of its citizens |  
whose activity and animatton best enable  
thein to rally to its standard. Besides, the  
cousideration that a time of peace ts the time  
when the change can be mule with the most  
convenience and equity, it will now be aided  
by the experience of a recent war,in which  
the militia bore so :oleresting a parf.  
  
Congress wil] call to mind, that no ade-  
quate provision hrs yet been made for the  
uniformity of weigh!s and measures, also  
Cuntemplated by the eonstitution. The  
rreati ntility ofa standard, fized in ifs nature,  
and founded on thie exsy rule of decimal pro  
portions, is sufficiently obvious. It led the

consideration of Congress; and I particulariy  
invite agai their attention iothe expediency  
of exercising their exisling powers and where  
necessary, of resorting to the prescribed mode  
of enlarging them, in order to effectuate a  
comprehensive system of reads and canals,  
such as will have the effeet of drawing more  
closely together every part of our country, by  
promoting intercourse and improvements, and  
hy increasing the share of every part in the  
common stock of national prosperity.  
  
Occurrences have taken place which shew  
that the statutory provisions tor the dispen.  
sations of criminal justice, are deficient in  
relation both to places aud to persons under  
the exclusive cognizance of the national au-  
thority : an amendment of the law, embrac.  
ing such cases, will merit the earliest atten-  
tion of the legislature. It will be a seasona-  
ble occasion ‘also, for enquiring how far legis-  
lative interpusition may be further requisite  
in providing penalties fer offences designat-  
ed in the constitution or in the statutes, and -  
to which either no penalties are annexed, o:  
none ‘vith sufficient certainty.  
  
And I submit lo the wisdom of eongresz,  
whether a more enlarged revisal of the crimi-  
nal code be not expedient, for ihe purpose of  
mitigating, in certain cases, penalties which  
were adopted into it antecedent fo experi  
ments and examples which justify and recom-  
mend amore lenient policy.  
  
‘The United states having been the first to  
  
abolish within the extent of their authority,  
  
the transportation of the natives of Africa  
info slavery, by prohibiting the introduction  
of slaves, and by punishing their citizens  
participating in the traflic, cannot but be  
gratified at the progress made by concurren!  
efforts of other uations, fowardsa general sup-  
pression of so great an evil—They must feel, at  
the same time, the greatest «lictlude, to give  
the fullest efficacy to thetr own reguiations.  
With that view, the interposition of congress  
appears to be required by the violations and  
evasions, which, it is suggested, are chargea  
bie on unworthy citizens who mingle in the  
slave trade under foreign flags aud with for-  
eign ports; and by collusive importations oj  
slaves tnio the United States through adjein  
ing portsand terrifories. T present the sub  
ject to. congress, with a full assurance of thei  
dispositien to apply all the remedy whict  
ean be afforded by an amendment of the law.

snard against abuses of a kindred charaeter,  
in the trade between the several states, oucht  
  
t also to he rendered more effectual! for théh:  
  
humane object. &gt;  
  
To these recommendation I add, for the  
consideration of congress, the expediency ofa

I can indulge the proud reflection, that the  
American peop&#x27;e have reached tn safety and suc-  
cess their fortieth year as an independent nation ;  
(hat for nearly an entire generation they have  
bad experience of their present coustitution, the

of their free choice, that they have found it to  
hear the trials of adverse, as well as prosperous  
circumstances, te contain, in its combination of  
the federate and elective principles, a reconcile-

of ambition, or of vain glory, in the fundamen-

costs, and feel its calamities. Nor is it fess a  
peculiar felicity of this constitution so dear to  
us aH, that it is found to be’ capable, without

deration of Congress, the expediency of arc-miNli-fication  
of the Judiciary establishment, and of an ad­  
ditional department in tlie Executive branch&#x27; of the  
government. . - -  
The first is called for by the accruing business  
which necessarily swells the duties of the Federal  
Courts; and by the great and widening space, vith-.  
in which justice is. to.be dispensed hy them. The  
time seems to have-arrived, which claims for tnem­

tlie researches and preparations which arc due to  
their stations, and to the juridical reputation of their

quire a more convenient organization of tlie subor­  
ainate tribunals, which may be accomplished w ith­  
out an objectionable, increase of tlie number or ex­  
pence of yjhe&#x27;.Judges. ;  
The extent and variety of Executive -business, al­  
so accumulating with the progress of our country  
and its growing population, call for an additional  
department, to lie charged with duties now overbur­  
dening other department, and with such as have nut

In directing the legislative attention to tlie state  
of the finances, it is a sunject of great gratification  
to find, that, even within the short period which has  
elapsed since -the return of peace, the revenue has  
far exceeded all the current demaiids upon the trea­  
sury, and that, under any probable diminution of ifs  
future annual product, which the vicissitudes of com  
  
merce &quot;may occasion, it will : afford an ample fund &quot;  
for the eftectual and early extinguishment of the  
public debt. Itlias been estimated, that during the  
year 1816, &#x27; the effectual receipts of revenue at the,  
-treasury,&#x27;, including the balance at thc.commcncc­  
ment of the year, and excluding the proceeds of loans 4  
and treasury notes,, will amount to alipjit the sum of  
forty seven millions&#x27; of dollars ;&quot; that dm ing the .

siderable excess, beyond the annual appropriations,  
  
fw ill amount to about the sum of thirty eight mil  
  
lions of dollars ; and that, consequently, at the&#x27; close  
  
of the year, there will be a surplus in the treasury -  
  
of aljo&#x27;ut the sum of nine millions of dollars.

has been estimated with reference to the first of  
January next, at. a sum not exceeding one hundred  
and ten millions of dollars. The ordinary annual  
expences of the government, for the maintenance of  
all its institutions, civil, military, and naval, have  
been estimated at a sun less than twenty millions of  
dollars. And the permanent xv venae, to be derived  
from all the existing sourceshas been estimated at  
a sura of about twenty five millions of &#x27;dollars, f y

Tellow-Citizens of the Senate,  
Jnd of the Heuse of fiepresentatives,  
In reviewing the present stale of our country,  
our attention cannot be withheld from the ef­  
f-ct produced by peculiar seasens, which have  
very generally impaired the annual gifis of the  
earth, and threatened scarcity in particular dis­  
tricts. Such, however, &#x27;is the variety of soils,  
« f climates, and of products, within our exten­  
sive limits, that the aggregate resources for  
subsisience, are more than sufficient for the ag­  
gregate wants. And, 2s far as an economy gf‘  
consumption, more than usual, may be necessa­  
£y, our thankfuiness is due to Providence, for  
what is far more than 2 compensation, in the  
remarkable heatth which-has distinguished the  
present. vear. : :  
Amidst the advantages which have succeed­  
ed the peace of Europe, and that of the United  
Btates with Great Britain, in a general invigora­  
tion of industry among us, and in the extension  
of ours commerce, the value of which is more  
and more disclosing itself to commercial na­  
tions, it is to be regretted that a depressionis  
experienced by particular branches of our man­  
ufactures, and by a portion of our navigation.  
- As the first proceeds in an essential degree,  
from an excess of imported merchandize, which  
carries a check in its own tendency, the cause,  
in its present extent, cannot be of very long du­  
ration. The evil will not, however, be viewed  
by Congress, without a recollection, that manu­  
fucturing establishments, if suffered to sink too  
low, or languish too-long, may not revive, after  
the causes sHall have ceased ; and that, in the  
vicissitudes of human affairs, situations may re­  
eur, in which a dependence on foreign sources,  
for indispensable supplies, may be among the  
anost serious emburrassents. |  
The depressed state of our navigation is to  
be ascribad, in &amp; material degree, to its exclu­  
sion from the coionial ports ofthe nation most  
extensively conpected with us in commerce,and  
from the indirect operation of that exclusion.  
Previous to the late conventjon at London,  
beiween the United States and Great Britain,  
the relative state of the navigation laws of the  
twe countries, growing out of the treaty of  
1704, had given to the British navigation a ma- {  
terial advantage over the American, in the in­  
tercourse between the American ports and Brit­  
ish ports in Europe. The convention of London  
equaiized the lhws of the o countries, rela­  
ting to thosc ports ; leaving the intercourse be­  
-Iween our ports and the ports of the British co- i  
_lonies subject, as before, ta the respective regu­  
lations of ihe paries. The British government, 1  
enforcing, now, regalations which prohibit a  
trade - between its ‘colonies and the United |  
Stales, in American vessels, whilst they permit |  
a trade in British vessels, the American naviga- |  
tion loses sccordingly ; and the loss is augment.  
ed by the advantage which is given to the Brit­  
ish competition over the American in the navi­  
gation betweea our ports and British ports in  
Europe, by the circuitcus voyages, enjoyed by  
the one, and not enjoyed by the other. ‘  
&#x27;The reasonableness of the rule of reciproeity,  
applied to one branch of the commercial inter­  
course, has been pressed on&#x27;our patt, as equal­  
1y applicable 1o both Lrauchies; but it is ascer­  
tained, that the British Cabinet declines all ne- |  
raciaiion on the subjects with a disavowal,  
. ﬁgwever. of any disposition -{0 view,&quot; in an un­  
friendly light, whatever countervailing regula­  
ions the United States may oppose to the regu-  
Jarsens of which ‘they complain. The wisdom  
‘of the Legislaturé will decide’ on the couvse,  
‘which, under these circumstances, is preseribed  
by a joint regard to the amicable relations be­  
%ﬂe,uhet:(r}o nations, and to the just iniérests  
of the Unjted States. E

thic friendly relutions of the two couniries, shull  
be found to require.  
The posture of our affuirs with Algiers, at

drawing pretexts from circumstances for which  
the United States were not answerable, addrés­  
sed a letter to this government, €ecluring ithe’

annuiled by our violation of it ; and presenting, |  
ag the alternative, war, or arenewal of the for­  
mer treaty, which stipulatcd, =mong other  
things, an annual tribuie. The angycr, with an  
plicit declaration that the Unite * Stales pre­  
fgrred war to tribute, ‘required his recognition  
and observance of the treaty last made, which  
abolishes tribute and the slavery of our captus­  
&amp;d citizens. The result of the answer has not  
becen received. Should he renew his warfare on,  
“our commerce, we rely on the protection it will  
find in our naval force actually inthe Mediter­

With the other Barhary states, our affuivs.  
have undergone no change. : P  
The Indian tribes within our limits appear al­  
so dispesed to remain at peace. From several  
of them purchases of lands have been made  
particularly favorable to the wishes and securi­  
ty of our frontier settlements ; as well as to the  
general interests of the nation.. Im.some instan­  
ces; the titles, thongh not supported by due  
proofs, and clashing those of one tribe with the  
claims of another; have been extinguished by  
double purchases ; the benevolent policy of the  
United States. preferring the augmented ex­  
pense to the hazard of .doing injustice; orto  
the enforcement of justice, against a feeble and.  
untutored people, by means involving oz threat­  
ening aa cffusion of blood. lam happy to add,  
that the tranquility which has been restored a­  
mong the tribes themselves, as well as berween  
them and our own population, will favor the re­  
sumption of the work of civilization, which had  
made an encouraging progress among some  
tribes ; and that the facility is increasing, for  
extending that divided and individual ownership,  
which exists now in&#x27;moveable preperty only, to  
the soil itself ; and of thus establishing in the  
‘culture and improvement of it, the true founda­  
‘tion for a transit from the habits of thesavage,  
to the arts and comforts of social life.  
  
.~ As.a subject of the highest importance to the  
‘national welfare, I must, again, earnestly re­  
commend to the consideration of Cnngrcss_, a  
re-organization of the militia, on-a plan which  
will form it into classes, accofding to the peri­  
ods of life more and less adapted to military ser­  
vices. An eflicient militia is authorized and  
contemplated by the constitution, and required  
by the spirit and safety of frec government.  
The present organization of our militia is uni­  
versally regacded. as less eflicient than it ought  
to be made ; and no ot ganization ecan be better  
calculated to give toit its due force,than a clas.  
sification which will assign the foremost place  
in the defence of the country, to that portion of  
its citizens, whoze aoctivily and animaiion best  
enable them to&#x27;rally to its standard.—Besides  
the considcration that a time of peace is the  
time when the change can be made with mest  
convenience and equity, it will now be aided by  
the experience of a recent war, in which the mi­  
litia bore so interesting a part.  
Congress, will call to&#x27; mind, that no adequate  
provision has yet been made for the uniformity  
of weights and measares, also contemplated by  
the constitution. The great utility of a stan­  
dard, fixed in its nature, and {fougded on the ea­  
syrule of decimal proportions, is sufficiently ob­  
vious. Itled the government at an early stage,  
to preparatory steps for introducing it; and a  
completion of the work will bea just title to  
the public gratitude.  
- The importance wiich I have attached to the  
establishment of a University within this Dis­  
‘trict, on a scale and for objects worthy of the  
American nation, induces me to renew my rec­  
ommendation of it, to the favorable considera­  
tion of Congress ; and T particularly invite again  
their attention to the expediency of exercising  
their existing powcrs, and where necessary, of  
resorting to the prescribed modé of eslarging  
them, in order to eflectuate a comprehensive  
system of moads and canals, such as will have  
the effect of drawing mere closely together eve-  
Ty part of our country,by promating intercourse.  
and improvements, and by increasing the share.  
of every part inthe common stock of national  
prosperity. - ~ : \
Occurrences have taken place which shew  
that the stationary provisions for the dispensa­  
tion of criminal justice, are deficient in pelation  
both to places and to persons under the exclu-,  
e cognizance of the national authority ; an  
amendment of the law, embracing such cases,  
will prerit the earliest attention of the legisla­  
ture. It will be a seasonable eccasion, also, for  
inquiring how far legislative ‘interposition may  
‘be further requisite in providing penalties for  
offences designated in the constitytion er in the  
statutes, and to which either no penaliies are  
annexed, or none with sufficient certainty. -  
And I submit to the wisdem of Congress,  
whetheér a more enlarged revisal of the criminal  
code be™ot expedicat, for the purpose of miti­  
gating, in certain cases, penalties swhich were  
adopted into it antecedent to experiments and  
examptes which justify gnd recommend a more |  
lenient policy: 1  
The Ut States having heen the first to abolish  
within the extent of their authority, the trans­  
portaiion of the matives of Africa into slavery,  
by prohibiting the introduction of slaves, and by  
punishing their citizens participating in the traf- {  
sic, cannot but be gratified at the progress made  
by concurrent efforts of other pations,towards a {  
general suppression of so great an evil—They 1  
must feel, at the same time, the greatest soligi- |  
tude,ta’give the fullest efficacy to their own reg­  
ulations, With that view,the interposition of con- i  
gress appears to:bé required by the violations  
and evasions which, it is suggested, are charge- |  
able on unworthy citizens who mingle in “the |  
slave trade under foreign flags and with fareign  
ports ; and by collusive importatiqns of ‘slaves  
&#x27;f:td;thp‘ U. States through adjoiming poits and ‘  
territories. I present the subject ta Congress,  
with a full assurance of their disposition to ap­  
ply all the remedy which can be afforded by an  
ameéndment of the law. The regulations which 1  
intended to guard agwinst abuses of a kindred 5  
character, in the trade between the several  
states, ought also to be rendered move effectual 1  
for their humane object. : Qo  
- To those recomrmacndaiions I add, for the con­  
sideration of Congress, the expedigney of a re­  
‘modification of the judiciary establishment, and :  
«of an additional departent in the exccutive  
branclyof the governtaent. &amp; o  
. Thefirst s called for by the secrying. busi-.  
ness, which necessariiy swells the ¢ Wﬁ,&amp; the  
federal courts, snd by the great and widening  
by them. &#x27; The time seems to have arfived,  
  
which ~Yaims for memberc ofthe SBNG!‘?:&amp;“GMWW  
a relict trom itinzrary faiigues, incompatible, as  
well with (hie age which a portion of them wiii  
always hinve attijued, as with the researches and  
preparations which are due to their station,and  
to the inridieal penutation of their country. Aund  
considerations equally coggnt&#x27;require a moie  
convenient orgamzation of the subordinate tri-  
Panals, which wmay by accomplished without an.  
oL*ctiua ahle increase of uie number or expence  
of the judges, | , S  
The extent and varieiy of executive business,  
also woenmdating with the progress of our  
counivy, and iis growing popnlation, call for un  
additional department, to be charged with du­  
ties now overburdening other depurtments, and  
with such as have not been annexed ta any Ce­  
partment,  
The coarse of experience recommends as a-  
Jother improvemeni in the Execudive establish­  
ment, thatthe provision for the station of Attor­  
ney Generzl, whose residence at the seat of gov­  
erntient, ofizial ecnnections with it, and man­  
agement of Ihe public business before the Judi­  
ciary, preclude an extensive participation in  
profession.a emoluments,be made more adequaie  
to Lis services and his relinquishmenis; and  
that, with a view te his reasonable accommoda­  
tion, and to u proper depository of lhis offickal  
opmicens Ind proccedings, there be included in  
the provisicn the usual appurtenances to a pub­  
lic office.-  
In directing the legislative attention to the  
state of the finanees,it is a subiect of great grat­  
ification to find, thai, even within the short peri­  
od whicli has elapsed since the retunn es peace,  
the revenue haa far exceeded all the current  
demands upon thé trcasury, and that under any:  
probable diminution of its fature annual produet,  
which the vicissitudes of cemmerce may occa­  
sion, it will afford an ample fund for the eflec­  
tual and early extinguishment of the public debt.  
Tt has been estimated, that daving the year  
1816, the actual receipis of revenne at the trea­  
sury, including tiie balance at the commence­  
ment of the year, and excluding the proceeds of  
loans and treasury notes, will amount to about  
the snm of forty-seven millions of doliars; that  
during the same year, the actual payments at  
the treasary incladirg the pavment of the ar­  
‘rearages of the war depavtment, as well us the  
payment of a considerable excess beyond the  
amadal! appropriations, will amount to. aßoul  
the sum of thirty-eight millions of doliars; aud  
-that, conzequently, at the close of the year, there  
will be a surplas in the treasury of about the  
sum of nine witllions of doilars,  
  
. The operations of the trea&lt;ury continue to he  
obstructed by difficuities, arising from the con­  
dition of the national currency; but they huave  
nevertheless heen effectual, to a beneficial extent,  
in the reduetion of the public debty, and the es­  
tablishwent 0} the public eredit. The fioating  
debt of treasury mnotes and temporarvy loans,  
will soon be entirely discharged. &quot;The agovepate  
of the funded debt, compnsed of debhis incurred  
during the wars of 1776 and of 1512, has been  
estimated, with reference to the first of January  
next, at a sum not exceeding one hundred and  
ten mitlions of dollais. The ordinary aacual  
expenses nf the government, for the maintenance  
of all its instituttons, civil, milit2y and paval,  
have heen esiimated at a sum less than twen&#x27;y  
millions of dollars, -And the permanent reve­  
nte, to he devived from all the eXisting sonrees,  
has been estimated at a snm of aboul twentys  
five mithons of dollars.  
Upon this gencral view of the suhject, it is  
ohvioug, that there iz only wauting, to the fivcal  
prosperity of the government, the restoration  
of an uniform medium of exchaunge. The re­  
sources and the faith of the nation, displayed  
in the system which Congress has established,  
ensure respect and coafidence at home and a­  
broad. Thelocal accgmulations of therevenue  
have already erabled the. treasury to meet the  
public engagements in the local currency of  
most of the States; and it is cxpected that the  
same cause will produce the came effect, thro’  
out the Upion. PBut, for the interests of the  
community at large, as well as for-the purposes  
of the treasnry, it is essentia! that the nation  
should possess a currency of equal value, credit  
and use, wherever it may circulate. The cop.  
stitution Kas entrusted Congress, éxclusively,  
with the power, of creating and regulating a  
currency of that description; and the measures  
which were taken durisg the last session, iu ex­  
ecution of the power, give every promise of suc­  
cess. The Bank of the U, States has been or­  
ganized wnder auspices the mnst favorable; and  
canpot fail to be an important auxiliary (6  
tßose measures. ‘  
  
For a more enlarged view of the public fi­  
nances, with a view of the measares pursued by |  
. the treasury department, previous to the resig­  
nation of the late Secretary, I transmit amwex­  
tract from the Tast report of that officer. Con­  
gress will perecive in it ample proofs of the solid ‘  
foundation on which the finarcial prosperity of  
the nation rests; and will do justice to the dis  
tingnished ability and suceessful alertions with  
which the daties of the department were execut­  
ed, during a period remarkable for its diffical­  
tie- and its peculiar perplexities.  
- ‘The period of my retiving from the puhlic  
service being at a little distance, T shall find no |  
occasion more proper than the present, for ex- |  
pressing to my fellow-citizens my deep sense of  
the continued confidence. and kind saupport  
which T have received from them. My grateful  
recollection of these distinguished marks of their |  
favorable regard can never cease; and, with the  
conaciousness, that if I have not served my  
country with greater ability, I have served 1t  
with a sincere devotion, will accompany me ase

Happily, I&#x27;shall carry with me from the pub­

Fellow citizens of the Senate,  
and House of Representatives.  
In reviewing the presett state. of oar  
country, our attention cannot be witheld  
from the effect produced by iar sea-  
sons, which have generall red the  
annual gifts of the earth, and threaten  
scarcity in particular districts. Such, how-  
ever, is the variety of soils, of climates.  
andef products, within our extensivetim -  
its. that the aggregate resources for subsis-  
tence are more than sufficient for-the ag-  
  
  
  
gregate wants. Aud as faras an econo-  
my of consumption, more than usual, may  
be necessary, our thankfulness is duc to  
Providence, for what is far more than 4  
compensation, in’ the remarkable heaith  
which has distinguished the present year.  
  
Amilst the advantages which have suc-  
ceeded the peace of Lurope, and that of  
the United States with Great-Britain, in a  
general invigoration of industry among us”  
and in the extension of our commerce, the  
valne of whichis more and more disclosing  
itself to commercial nations, it is ta be re  
gretted thaf a depression is experienced by  
particular branches of our manufactures  
  
  
  
and by a portion of our navigation. As  
| the first proceeds, in an essential degree.  
from an excess of imported merchard:ze.  
_ which carries a check in its own tendency,  
the cause, in its present extent, cannot be  
of very long duration. ‘The evil wali not,  
&#x27; however, be viewed by Congress, without «  
| recollection, that intnulacturing establish  
| nents, if sulfered to’ sink too low, or lane  
guish tov long, may not revive, after the  
_ causes shall have ceased ; and that, in th  
  
vicissitudes of human affairs, situation  
| may recur,io which a depeudence on ft  
eigu sources for indispensable supplies, |  
| may be amoung the most serivas embatrass- |  
ments.

Follow-citizens of the Scnate,  
and of the louse of Representatives,  
  
In reviewing the present state of our  
country, our attention cannot be withheld  
trom the eHect produced by pecuiar seas  
sons, which bave very gencraily mipairad  
the annual gifts of the earth, and threwen  
scarcity in particular districts. Such,  
however, is the variety of suils of climates,  
and of products, within our extensive  
limits, tgat the aggregate resources lor  
subsistence are more than suflicient for  
the aggregate wants. And as far as an  
economy of consumption, more than us­  
ual, may be necessary, our thanktulness  
is due to Providence, for what is far more  
than a compensation, in the remarkable  
health which has distinguished the pres.-  
ent year  
  
Amidst the advantages which have  
succeeded the peace of ilumpc, and that  
of the United States with Great-Britain,  
in a general invigoration of industry a.  
mong us, and in the extension of our  
commerce, the value of which is more  
and more disclosing itself to commercial  
nations, it is to be regretted that a depres.  
sion is cxperienced by particular branches  
of our manufactures, and by a portion of  
our navigation. As the first proceeds,  
in an essential degree, from an excess of  
imported merchandize, which carries a  
check in its own tendency, the cause, in  
its present extent, cannot be of very long  
duration. The evil will not, however,  
be viewed by Congress, without a recal­  
lection, that manufactaring establish.  
ments, if suffcred to sink too low, or lan.  
guish too long, may not revive, after the  
causes shall have ceased ; and that, inthe  
vicissitudes of hymun affairs, situations  
may recur, in which a dependence on  
forcign sources, for indispensable sup­  
plies, may be among the most serious  
embarrassments.  
  
- The depressed state of our navigation,  
i$ to be ascribed in a material degree, to  
ity ciclusion frem the colonial ports of  
  
the nation wost exlensiveiy cobnected  
with us m cemmerce, and from the indi­  
rect operation of that exclusion.  
Previous to the lute convention at Lon.-  
don, between tue United States and Great  
Britain, the relative state of the naviga.  
tion laws of the two countries, growing  
out of .the treaty of 1794, had given to  
the British navigation a material advan­  
tage over the American, in the intercourse  
between the American ports and British  
orts in Furope The convention of  
lLondon equalized the laws of the two  
countries, relating to those ports ; leaving  
the intercourse bLetween cur ports and  
the ports of the British colonies, subject,  
as before, to the respective regulations of  
the parties. ‘T&#x27;be British government,  
enforcing, now, regulations which pro­  
hibit a trade between its colonies and the  
United States, in American vessels whilst  
they perimit a trade in British vesscls, the  
American navigation loses accordingly ;  
and the loss is augmented by the advan­  
tage which is given to the British compe­  
tition over the American, in the navigu­  
tion between our ports and British ports  
in Lurope, by the circuitous voyages,  
¢njoyed by the one, and not enjoyed by  
the other. :  
  
‘l&#x27;he reasonableness of the rule of reci­  
procity, applied to one branch of the com­  
mercial intercourse, has been pressed on  
our part, as cquaﬂly applicable to both  
branches : but it is ascertained, that the  
British Cabinet declines all negociation  
on the subject ; with a disavowal, howev.  
er, of any disposition to view, in an un.  
friendly light, whatever countervailing  
regrulations the United States may oppuose  
to the regulations of which they complain,  
The wisdom of the Legislature will de­  
cide on the course, which, uonder these  
circumstances, is prescribed by a joint  
regard to the amicable relations: between  
the two nations, and to the just interests  
of the United States. -  
  
I have the satisfaction to statc, gener­  
ally, that we remain in amity with foreigo  
powers,  
An occurrence has, indeed, taken place  
in the Gult&#x27;of Mexico, which, if sanction­  
ed by the Spanish government, may  
make an exception as to that power. Ac­  
cording to the report of our naval com­  
mandcr on that station, one of our public  
armed vessels was atiacked by an over­  
poweriag force, under a Sganish com­  
mander, and the American flug, with the  
officers and crew, insulted, in &amp; manner  
calling for prompt reparation. T&#x27;his bas  
been demanded. In the mean time, o  
frigate and smaller vesscl of war have  
been ordered into that Gult, for the pro.  
tection of our conrmerce. It would be  
improper to omit, that the representative  
ot bis Catholic Majesty, in the United  
States, lost no time m giving the strong­  
est assurances, that no hostile order cou?d  
have emanated irom his government, and  
that it will be as ready to do, as to expect,  
whatever the naturc of the two countries,  
shatl be found to require, _  
I&#x27;he posture oi our affairs with Algiers,  
at the present moment, is not known.  
‘T&#x27;he Dey, drawing pretexts from circum.-  
stances for which the United States were  
not answerable, addressed a letter to this  
government, declaring the treaty last con­  
cluded with him, to have been anmuiled  
by our violation of it ; and presenting, as  
the alternative, war, or a renewal of the  
former treaty, which stipulated, among  
other things, an annual tribute. T&#x27;he  
answer, with an explicit declaration that  
the United States preferred war tatribute,  
required is recognition and observance  
of the treaty last made, which abolishes  
tribute, and the slavery of our captured  
citizens. The result of the answer has  
not been received. Should bhe renew his  
warfare on our commerce, we rely on the  
protection it will find in our naval force  
actually in the Mediterranean.  
With the other Barbary states onr af­  
fairs have uudergone no change.  
The Lindian tribes within our limits ap.  
ar also disposed to remain at peace.  
E-om several of them purchases omuls  
have been made, particularly favorable to  
the wishes and sccurity of our frontier  
settlements, as well as to the general in­  
terests of the nation. In some instance,  
the titles, though not supported by due  
proof, and clashing those of one tribe with  
the claims of another, have been extin.  
guished by double purchases ; the bene.  
voient policy of thc%nited States prefer­  
ring the augmented expence, to the ha.  
zard of doing injustice, or to the enforce.  
ment of justice against a feeble and un.  
wiored poople, by means invalving or  
theeatning an effusien of Lisod, Lam  
  
happy 0 4dd, that e tranquiity whick  
has been restored among the tiibes them­  
selves, as well as between them and our  
own population, will favor the resump­  
tion of the work of civilization, which  
had made an encouraging progress among  
some tribes ; and that the facility is in­  
creasing, - extending that divided and  
individual ownership, which exists now  
in movcable property only, to the soil  
itsclf; avd of thus establishing, in the  
culture and improvement of it, the true  
foundation for a transit of the savage, to  
the arts and comiorts of social life.  
  
As a subject of the highest importance  
to the nattonal welfare.” I must, again,  
carnestly recommend to the considera­  
tion of Congress, a reorganization ol the  
Militia, on a plan v. hich will form.it into  
classes; according to the periods of life  
more and less adapted to military servi­  
ces. An efficient militia is authorized  
and contemplated by the constitution,  
and required by the spint and safety of  
frce government. The present organi­  
zation of our militia is universally regard­  
ed as less cfficient than it ought to be  
made ; aund no organization can be bet­  
ter calculated to give to its due force,  
than a classification which will assign the  
loremost place in the defence of the  
country, to that portion of its citizens,  
whose activity and animation best enable  
them to rally to its standard. Besides  
the consideration that a time of peace is  
the time when the change can be made  
with most convenience and equity, is  
will row be aided by the experience of  
a recent war, in which the militia bore  
  
SO terestining a part.,. ;  
Congress will call to mikd, that 1o ad­  
cquate provisien has yet been made, for  
the unitormity of weights and measures,  
also contemplated by the constitution.  
The great utility of a standard, fixed in  
its nature, and foundcd on the easy rule  
of discimal proportions, is sufficiently ob­  
vicus. Itled the government, at an ear­  
ly stage, to prepuratory steps for intro­  
ducing 1t; aidd a completion of the work  
will be a just titleto the public gratitude,  
I&#x27;he importance which I have attach.  
¢d-to the establishment of a Umversity  
within this District, on a seale, and for  
objects worthy of the American nation,  
induces me to renew my recommenda­  
tion of it ta the favorable consideration of  
Congress: And 1 particolarly invite, a­  
gun, their attention to the cxpcdicr}gg  
of exercising their existing powers, and,  
where necessary, of resorting to the pre­  
scribed mede of enlarging them, in order  
to effectuate a comprehensive system of  
roads and canals, such as will have the  
efiect of drawing more closely together  
every part of onr country, by promoting  
tercourse and improvements, and by  
increasing the share of every part in the  
common stock of nationa} prosperity.  
Occurrence having taken place which  
shew that the statutory provisions for the  
dispensation of criminal justice, are de­  
ficient in relation both to places and to  
persons, under the exclusive cognizance  
of the national authority, an amendment  
of the law, embracing such cases, will  
merit the carliest attention of the Legis­  
lature. It will be a seasonable occasion,  
also, for inquiring how far Legislative  
interposition may be further requisit in  
providing penalties for oﬂ‘cnccstgcsigﬂa­  
ted in the constitution or in the statutes,  
and to which cither no fgerm_ltics are an­  
nexed, or none with sufficient certainty .  
And I submit to the wisdom of congress  
whether a more enlarged revisal of the  
criminal code be not expedient, for the  
purpose of mitigating, in certain cases,  
plnalties which were adopted into it, an­  
tecedent to experiments and examples  
which justify-and recommeiid a more le­  
nient policy.  
‘The United States having been the  
first to abolish, within the extent of their  
authority, the transportation of the natives  
of Alrica into slavety, by prohibiting  
the introduction of sluves, and by pun­  
ishing their citizens participating in the  
traffic, cannot but be gratifizd at the pro­  
gress made by concurrent efforts of othier  
nations, towards a general suppression of  
so great anevil. They must feel, at the  
same time, the greater solicitude to give  
the fullest efficacy to their own regula­  
tions. With that view, the interpo-ition  
of Congress appears to be required by  
the violations and cvasions which it is  
suggested, are chargeable on unworthy  
citizens, who mingle in the slave trade  
under foreign flags, and with forcign  
ports ; by collusive importations of slaves  
inta the United States, through adjoin­  
ing ports and territorics. I present the

00 ect o coagress, with a full dssurencs  
¢ * thelr disposiiion (o apply all the remedy  
~uich can be afforded by an amendment of  
‘uo law. The regulations which were in­  
tended to guard agaiost abuses of a kindred  
characier, in the trade between the several  
states, ought also to be rendered more effcc­  
tual for their humane object.  
To these recommendastions I add, for the  
consideration of Congress, the expedicacy of  
a re-modification of the Judiciary establish­  
wment and of an additional departmeat in the  
Executive branch of the government,  
The first is calied for by the accruing busi­  
ness which necessarily swells the duties of  
the Federal Courts ; and by the great and  
widening space, within which justice is 1o be  
dispeased by them. 7The time seetns to bave  
arrived, which claims for me mbers of the Su­  
preme Court a relief from itinerary fatigues,  
incompatible, as well with the sge which a  
portion of them will always have attaioed, as  
with the rescarches and preparations which  
ure due to their s&#x27;ations, sud to the juridical  
reputation of their country. And considera­  
tions equally cogent requirg a more conven­  
ient organization of the subordinate tribuaals,  
which may be accomplished without an objec­  
tionable increase of the number or expence  
of the Judges.  
The extent and variety of Executive busi­  
ness, also accumalatiog with the progress of  
our country and its growiog population, call  
for aa ‘addilional department, to be charged  
with duties now overburdening other depart­  
ments, and with such as have not been anacx­  
~ed to any depart -  
.. The course of o &#x27;@Jionce recommends, as  
another improvement in the Executive estab­  
lishment; that the provision for the station of  
Attorney Genéral, whose residence aiL the  
&#x27; sout of&#x27;government, official connections with  
it, and managemeny of the public busincss  
&quot;befare the Judiciary, preclude wh exiensive

made worg adeguate to his services and bhis  
* relinquishments ; and that, with a view 10 his  
reasonable accommodation, and t 0 a pioper  
depository of his official opinions and procecd­  
ings, there be included ia the provision, the  
usual appurtenances to a pablic office.  
In directing the legislative attention to the  
atate of the finances, it is a subject of great  
gratification 10 find, that, cven within the short  
period which has elapsed since the retarn of  
peace, the revenue has far excecded all she  
current demands upon the treasury, and that,  
under any probable diminution of its future  
annual produet, which the vicissitudes of com­  
merce may occasion, it will afford an ample  
fuod for the eflcctual and early extinguish­  
ment of the public debt. It has been estimat­  
-&amp;d, that daring the yoar 1816, the actual re­  
ceipts of revenue at the treasury, including  
the balance at the commeancement of the year,  
end excluding the proceeds of loans and tiea­  
sury notes, will amount to about the sum of  
foriy seven millions of dollars ; that during  
the same year, the aclual‘g‘aymems at the  
‘Kreavdry including the payaient of the srrears  
eges of the War Department; a 3 well as the  
. payment of a considerable excess, beyond the  
annual appropriations, will amount to abou  
the sum of thirly eight millions of doliars ;  
and that, censequently, at the close of the year,  
there will be a surplus in the treasury of a­  
bout the sum of nine millicns of dollars.  
... Lhe operations of ihe treasury continue to  
be obsicucted by difficulties, arising from the  
condition of the nativnal currency ; but they  
have, aeveriheless, been effcctual; to a bene.  
ficial extent, in the reduction of the public  
deot, and the establishment of the public cred­  
it. “The floating debt of treasury notes and  
temporary loans, will soon be entirely dischar­  
ged Theaggregate of the funded debt, com­  
posed of debts incurred during the wars of  
1776 and of 1819, has been estimited, with  
“ reference to the first of January next, at a  
sum Rot exceeding one hundred snd ten mil­  
lions of dollars. The etdinary annual expen­  
ces of the government, for the maintenance  
of all its institutions, civil, military, and naval,  
have been estimated at a sum less than twen­  
ty miilions of dollars. And the permanent  
revenue, 16 be derived from all the existing  
sources, has been estimated at a sum of about  
twenty five millions of dollars.  
Upon this general view of the subject, it i­  
obvious, that there is only wanting, to the fis-,  
cal prosperity of the government, the resior­  
ation of an uniform medium of exchange.  
The resources and the faith of the nation, dis­  
played jn the system which Congress has es­  
tablished, cnsure respect and confidence at  
home and abroad, T he local accumaulatjons  
of the revenue have already enebled the treas­  
ury to meet the pudlic engagements in the  
Jocal currency of meost of the states : and it is  
expecied that the same cause will prodace  
the same effecty throughout the Union. Bu  
for the interests of the community at larg:e,  
as weli as for the pucposes of the treasury, it  
is sssential that the nation should possess 4  
cur rency of equal value, credit &amp; use, wherey,  
er it may circulate. The constitution has en  
trusied Congress, exclusively, with the power  
of creating and regulating a currency of the  
description ; and the weasures whieh were  
taken during the last session, in execution of  
the pawer, give every promise of success  
Toc Bink of the United Siates has been or­  
ganized under auspices the most favorable  
and canpot fail to bz an important auxiliary  
to those measures.  
For a more enlarged view of the public fi  
nances, with a view ol the measures pursue  
by the Tressary Departmcat, previous to  
the resignation of the late Secretary, [ Irane  
it an extract from the last report of th,  
offi.er. Coagress wil perceive ia it ample  
proofs of tie solid foundation on whiz® the  
finaacia! prosperiyy of the nstion rests ; and  
will do jasice to the distinguished ohiliry und  
sgccessful exertions with which the duties ol  
  
w 0 depariment wers execuled, coring s per­  
tod remer kable for iis Yifficulties end its pe­  
culiar perplexitics.  
‘T&#x27;he period of wy retiring from the pub­  
lic service being at litile distance, 1 shall find  
0o occasiod more proper than the present,  
for expressing to my fellow-citizens iy deep  
sense of the continued confidence and kind  
support which I have rceived from them.  
My grateful recollection of these distivguish­  
ed marks of their favorable regard can nev­  
et ceas® ; and with the conciousness, ibat if  
I have not served my couniry with greater  
abilily I have served it with a sincere de­  
votion, will accompany me as a source of un­  
failing gratification, |  
tappily, | shall carry with me from the  
public theatre, other sources, Wwhich those  
who love there coantry most, wili best appre­  
ciate. [ shall behold it blessed with tran­  
quility and prosperty at home ; and with  
peace dnd respect abroad. 1 can indulge  
the proud reflection that the American  
people have reached in safeiy and snccges  
their fertieth year as an independant nation ;  
that for neariy an eontire geaecrastion, they  
heve had experience of their present con.  
stitution, the offspring of their undistu bed  
deliberations and of their free choice; that  
they have found it (0 bear the trials of ade’  
verse as well as prospe-cusy circumstinces,  
to contaln io its, combination of the fede  
rate and cleciive principlies, a reconcilement  
of publick strengih with lodividus! hberuy,  
of national power for e defence of natioual  
rights, with a security ag inst wars of injus.  
tice, of ambition, o 1 of vain glory, in (he  
fundamental provision which suabjects all  
questions of war to the will of the nauon it­  
seif, which is 1o pay its costs and feel 1y  
calamities. Noris it less a peculiar felicy  
of this censtitution, so dear 1o us all, that it 1y  
found to be capable, wiinout losing ity yoal  
energies, of xpanding itself over a spacious  
territory, with the incresse and expansion of  
the commuunity for whose bendfii it wis es­  
tablished.  
  
And may I not be sllowed to add to Ihis  
gratifying spectacle, that 1 snall read 1o the  
character of the American people, in neir  
devotion to true liberty, and 1o the cons Qe  
tion which is its palladium, suiec presizes  
that the destined career of my country will  
exhibit a goveroment pursuing the pubug  
good as its sole objecis, and regolaung is  
mouns by the g ca piipeiple @onsecruicd  
in its charter, and by thosc moral principles  
to which they are so well filled: A govern­  
ment which waiches over the purity of elee­  
tions, the frecdom of speech and of the press,  
the trial by jory, and the equsl interdict as  
gainst the encroachments snd compacts he­  
tween religion and state, which maiawins in.  
violshly the maxims »f public faith, the se­  
curity of persons and guoperty, and encours  
Iges, it every au husised wode, that general  
diffusion of kno v’]ge whizh guarantees to  
public liberty its pcrmanency, and thos  
who possess the blessing, the lrue enjoymnz  
of it: A government which avoids antru.  
sions on :he intetpal repase of othor nations,  
and repels them from its own ; which does,  
justice to all nations with a reediness equal  
td the firmpess with which it requires jus.  
tice from tbem ; and which, whilst it cch’nes  
its domestic code from cvery ingredient not  
congenial with the precepts of en enlightened  
age, and the seutiments of a virtuous people,  
secks, by appcals to reasor, and by its liberal  
cxamplepy to infuse, into the law which gov.  
erns the civilitzed world, a spirit which may  
‘diminish the frequency, or circumscribe the  
calamities of war, and meliorate the ‘social  
and beneficient relations of peace : A govern­  
ment, in a word, whose conduct, within and  
without, may bespeak the mest noble of all  
ambitions, that of promoting peaee on carth,  
and geod will to man.  
These contemplations, swectening the  
remnant of my days, will animate my prayers  
for the happiness of my beloved country. and  
a perpetuity of the institutions under which  
it is enjoyed.

the nature of the case, and the friend­

be found to require.  
i The posture of our affairs with Air

from circumstances, for winch the U­

; tne atteroauve, war, or a renewal oi

moos othcb- things, an annual tribute.  
The answer, with an explicit declara-,  
tion that the United S&#x27;ates prelerred  
Unr to tribtite, required Ids recogni­  
tion and observance of the treaty last J  
mule which abolishes tribute, and the i  
slavery of on captured citizens. The &#x27;

of retorting to the prescribed inode of

the coin in on stock ot national prcspe­  
rity. , .  
Occurrences having taken place which  
hcw that the-statutory provisions for  
the dispensation of, criminal justice,  
are deficient in relation both to places  
and to persons under the exclusive  
cognizance of the! national authority ;  
an amendment of the law, embracing  
such cases, will merit the earliest at-  
tention of the Legislature.  
It will be  
a seasonable occasion also, for inquir-  
tng now iar legislative interposition  
may be further requisite in providing  
penalties for offences designated in the  
Constitution or in j the statutes, and to  
which either no penal ties are annexed  
or none with sufficient certainty. And  
i submit to the wisdom bf Congress,  
whether a more enlarged revisal of the  
criminal code be not expedient, for  
the purpose of mitigating, in certain  
cases, penalties which were adopted  
into it Antecedent to experiments arid  
examples which justify and recommend  
a more lenient policy.  
,The United States haying been the  
first to abolish within the extent of  
j their authority; the transportation- of i  
a w m w w a - W T  
prohibiting , the introduction of ilavesyl  
and by punishing their citiz.ens parti-!  
cipating in the traffic, cannot but be ;  
gratified at the progress made by con  
current efforts&#x27; of other nations, to  
j ward a general suppression of so great  
an evil. Tliey must feel, at; the same  
;time, thc greater solicitude, .to give  
I the fullest eflkacy to tjieir own regu­  
&#x27; lations. . With that view, the interpo  
sition of Congress appears to be reui­  
red, by the violations and. evasions,  
which, ,i(.is suggested, are Chargeable  
on unworthy citizens who mingle in  
the slave trade under foreign fls, and  
with foreign ports and by collusive  
importations of slaves into the United  
States through adjoining pot fs and ter­  
ritories. 1 present the subject to Con­  
gress, with a full assurance4 of their  
disposition to apply all the remedy  
which can be afforded by an amend-ment  
of the law. The regulations which  
were intended to guard asfaihst abuses  
of a kindred character, in the trade  
between the several states, ought also  
to be rendered more effectual for their  
hpmahe object. v

that during the year 1816, the actual  
receipts &#x27;of revenue at the treasury, in­  
cluding the balance at the commence­  
ment of the year, and excluding te  
proceedS oi loand and treasury . notes,  
will amount to about the sum of forty f  
seven &#x27;millions of dollars ; that during j

arrearages of the VVar Department, as j  
well as the payment of a considerable  
excess, ueyona me an.nuaji- appropna-

thirty eight millions of dollars ; and  
that, consequently, at the close of the  
year, there will be a surplus in the  
treasury of about the sum of nine mil­  
lions of dollars. ;

tinue to be Jt)bstrutted by difficulties,  
arising from the condition of the na­

Fellow-citizcns of the Striate,  
and of ihe House of Representatives,  
  
In viewing the present state of our country,  
our attention cannot be withheld from the ef  
  
fect produced by peculiar seasons, which have  
very generally impaired the annual gifts of the  
earth, and threaten soareity in particular dis­  
tricts. Such, however, is tbe variety of soils,  
of climates, and of products, within our exten­  
sive limits, that the aggregate resources for  
subsistence, are more than sufficient for the ag­  
gregate wants. And, as far as an economy of  
eonsumption, more than usual, may be neces­  
sary, our thankfulness is due to Providence,  
for what is far more than a compensation, in  
tbe remarkable health which has distinguished  
the present year.  
Amidst the advantages which have succeed­  
ed the peaee of Europe, and that of the Uni  
  
ted States wtth Ore at lintain, in a general in- j  
vigoration or industry among us, and in the ex­  
tension of our commerce, the value of which is  
more &amp;. more disclosing itself to commercial na­  
tions, it is to be regretted that a depression is ex­  
perienced by particular branches of our manu­  
factures, &amp; by a portion of our navigation. As  
the first proceeds, in an essential degree, from  
an exeess of imported merchandize, which car­  
ries a cheek in its own tendency? the cause, in  
its present extent, cannot be of very long dura­  
tion. The evil will not, however, be viewed  
brCoagress, without a recollection, that man­  
ufacturing establishments, if suffered to siuk  
too low, or languish loo long, may not revive,  
after the causes shall have ceased ; and that,  
in the vicissitudes of human affairs, situations  
may recur, in which a dependance on foreign  
sources, for indispensable supplies, may be a­  
xnonr tbe most serious embarrassments.  
Tun depressed stale of our navigation is to  
be ascribed, iu a material degree, to its exclu­  
sion from the colonial parts of the batiou most  
extensively connected with us in commerce,  
  
and from the indirect operation of that delu  
  
sion.  
  
Previous to the late convention at London,  
  
between tbe United States and Great Britain,  
  
Iks relaiirt iUU sf lit ixvlrviUa Ut sf tie  
twt ts)trte, growl ag ut of ths treaty ef 17  
had given to tke British aavigtiies) a Cite­  
rial advantage aver tke American, ia the latest  
ena bet we a tke American parts aad British  
parts ia Eerope. Tbe eaavraiis a f London  
equalizes the laws ef tke two eaaolries, rela­  
ting ta tkatt ports ; leaving tke iaterwarse be­  
tween ear parts and tbe parts af tke British co­  
lonies, subject, as before, to tbe respective re­  
gulations af tke parties. Tba British govern­  
ment, enforcing, now, regolatiaot which pro­  
hibit a trade between its eolsaiet and tbe Uni­  
ted States, in American vessels, wbilst they  
permit a trade ia British vessels, the American  
navigation loses accordingly ; and the loss it  
augmented by the advantage which is given to  
the British competition over tha Atneriean, in  
the navigation between oar ports and British  
ports in Europe, by the circuitous voyages, en  
  
joyed by tbe one, and not enjoyed by the oilier.  
  
1 ho reasonableness ol the rule of reciproci­  
ty, applied to one branehof the&#x27;eoinmereial in­  
tercourse, has been pressed on our part, as e­  
qually applicable to both branches : but it is as­  
certained, that Ihe Britiab Cabinet declines all  
negociation on the subjeet ; with a disavowal,  
however, of any disposition to view, in an un  
  
friendly light, whatever eouotervailiug regu­  
lations tbe U. States may oppose to the regu­  
lations of which they complain. Tbe wirdom  
of the Legislature will decide on the eourse,  
which, under these cireuinstancet, it prescrib­  
ed by a joint regard to the amicable telations  
between the two nations, and to the juit inter  
ests of the United States.  
I have the satisfaction to state, generally,  
that we remain in amity with foreign powers.  
An occurrence has, indeed, taken place in tbe  
  
Gulf of Mexico, which, if sanctioned by the  
Spanish government, may make an exception as  
  
to that power. According to the report of our  
  
naval commander, on that station, one of our  
  
public armed vessets was attaked by an overpow  
  
eriug foree, under a Spanish Commander, and  
  
the American flng, with the officers and erew.  
  
asulted, in a manner calling for prompt repa  
  
ration, lhis has been demanded. In the  
mean time, a frigate and smaller teasel of war  
have been ordered into that Gulf, for the pro  
  
tection of our commerce. It would be improp­  
er to omit, that the representative of his Cath­  
olic Majesty, in the United States, lost no time  
in giving the strongest assurances, that no hos  
  
tile order could have emanated from Lis gov­  
ernment, and that it will be as ready to do, as  
to expect, whatever the nature of the case, and  
the friendly relations of the two conntries, shall  
be found to require.  
  
Ibe posture of our affairs with Algiers, at  
the present moment, is not known. The  
Dey, drawing pretexts from circumstances, for  
which the United States were not answerable,  
addressed a letter to this government, declaring  
the treaty last concluded with him.&quot; to have  
  
been annulled by our violation of it ; and pre­  
senting, as the alternative, war, or a renewal  
of the former treaty, which stipulated, among  
other things, an annual tribute. The answer,  
with an explicit declaration that the United  
States preferred war to tribute, required his re­  
cognition and observance of the treaty last made,  
which abolishes tribute, and the slavery of our  
eaptured citizens. The result of the answer  
has not been received. Should he renew his  
warfare on our commerce, we rely on the pro­  
tection it will fiud in our uaval force actually in  
the Mediterranean.  
With the other Barbary states, our affairs  
have undergone no ehange. .  
The Indian tribes within oar limits appear  
also disposed to remain at peace. From sever­  
al of them purchases of lands have been made,  
particularly favourable to the wishes end secu­  
rity of our f roll tier settlements ; as well as to  
the general interests of the nation. In some  
instances, the titles, though not supported by  
due proof, and clashing those of one tribe with  
the claims of another, hare been extinguished  
  
by double purchases ; the benevolent policy of  
  
the U nited ntates preferring the augmented ex­  
pense to the hazard of doing injustice; or to  
the enforcement of justice, againsU. feeble aod  
untutored people, by means involving or threat­  
ening an effusion of blood. I am happy to add,  
that the tranquility which has been restored  
  
among the tribes themselves, as well as between  
  
them and our own population, will favor the re  
  
sumption ofthe work of civilization, which had  
a  
  
mane an encouraging progress among some  
  
tribes ; and that the facility is increasing, for  
extending that divided and individual owner  
  
ship, which exists now in moveable property  
  
only, to the soil lUeil : and of thus establish  
  
ing in the culture and improvement of it, the  
  
true foundation for a transit from the habits of  
  
the savage, to the arts and comforts of social  
  
life.  
  
As a subjeet of the highest importance to the  
  
national welfare, 1 must, again, earnestly re  
  
commend to the consideration of Congress, a  
  
re-organizatton of the Militia, on a plan which  
  
will form it into classes, according to the pen  
  
ods of life more and less adapted to military  
  
services. An efficient militia is authorised and  
  
contemplated by the constitution, and required  
  
by. the spirit and salety of tree government.  
  
Ihe present organization of ourmilitia is nm  
  
versally regarded as leas efficient than it ought  
  
to be made ; and no organization ean be better  
  
calculated to give to it its due force, than  
  
classification which will assign tbe foremost  
  
place in the defence of the country, to that por  
  
tion of its citizens, whose activity and anima  
tion best enable them to rally to its standard  
  
Besides the consideration that a time of peace  
is the time.when the change can be made with  
  
most convenience and equity, it will now be at  
  
ded by the experience of a recent war, in which  
  
the militia bore so interesting a part.  
  
Congress will call to mind, that no adequate  
provision has yet been made for the uniformity  
of weights and measures, also contemplated by  
  
tae constitution. Ihe great utility of a stand  
  
ard, fixed In its nature, and founded on the easy

are annexed, or none with sufficient certainty.  
  
Ann I submit to tbe wisdom or Congress, whe­  
ther a more enlarged revisal of Ihe criminal  
code be not expedient, for the purpose of miti­  
gating, in certain eases, penalties whieh were  
adopted into it antecedent, to experiments and  
examples which justify and recommend a more  
lenient policy.  
The United States having been the first to a­  
bolish within the extent of their authority, the&#x27;  
transportation of the native of Africa into slav­  
ery, by prohibiting the introduction of slaves,  
and by punishing their citizens participating in  
the traffic, eannot but be gratified at the pro­  
grr s made by concurrent efforts of other nations  
towards a general suppression of so great au e­  
vil. Thejr must feel, at tbe same time, the  
greater soheitude, to give the fullest efficacy to  
their own regulations. With that view, the  
interposition of Congress- appears to be requir­  
ed, by the violations and evasions which, it is  
suggested, are chargeable on unworthy citizens  
who mlngie in the slave trade under foreign  
flags, and with foreign ports ; and by collusive  
importations of slaves into the United States  
through adjoining ports and territories. I pre­  
sent the subject to Congress, with a full assur­  
ance of their disposition to apply all the reme­  
dy whieh can be afforded by an amendment of  
the law. The regulations whieh were intend­  
ed to guard against abuses of a kindred charac­  
ter, in the trade between the several states,  
ought also to be rendered more effectual for  
  
their humane object.  
  
1 o these recommendations, I add, for the con  
  
sideration of Congress, the expediency of a re­  
mod ificat ion of the judiciary establishment, and  
  
of an additional department in the Executive  
  
branch of the government.  
  
ihe first is called for by the accruing busi  
  
ness, which necessarily swells the duties of the  
  
federal Courts, and by the great and widening  
space, within which justice is M be dispensed  
  
by them. The time seems to have arrived,  
  
which claims for members of the Supreme Court  
a relief from itinerary fatigues, incompatible,  
  
as well with the age whieh a portion of them  
  
will always have attained, as with tbe resear  
  
ches and preparations which are due to their  
stations, and to the juridical reputation of their  
country. And considerations equally cogent  
  
require a more convenient organization of the  
  
subordinate tribunals, which may be accom­  
plished without an objectionable increase vf  
the number.or expense of the Judges.  
  
1 he extent and variety of Executive business,  
  
also accumulating with the progress of our  
  
country, and its growing population, call for  
an additional department, to be charged with  
  
duties now overburdening other departments,  
and with such as have not been annexed to any  
department.  
  
I he course of experience recommends as an  
  
other improvement in the Executive establish  
  
ment, that the provision for the station of Ater  
ney General, whose residence at the seat of go  
  
vernment, official connections with it, and  
  
management of the public business before the  
  
Judiciary, precludes an extensive participation  
  
in professional emoluments, be made more ade  
  
quate to his services and his relinquishments ;  
  
and that, with a view to hit reasonable accom­  
modation, and to a proper depository of his offi  
  
cial opinions and proceedings, there be inclu  
  
ded in the provision the usual appurtenances to  
  
a public otnee.  
In directing the legislative attention to the  
state of the finances, it is a subject of great grat­  
ification to find, that, even within the short pe­  
riod which has elapsed since the return of  
peace, the revenue has far exceeded all tbe cur­  
rent demands upon the treasury, and that, un­  
der any probable diminution of its future annu­  
al product, which the vicissitudes of commerce  
may occasion, it will afford an ample fund for  
the effectual and early extinguishment of thn  
publie debt. It has been estimated, that during  
the year 1810, the actual receipts of revenue  
at the treasury, including the balance at the  
commencement of the year, and excluding the  
proceeds of loans and treasury notes, will a­  
inount to about the sum of forty seven millions  
of dollars ; that during the same year, the actu­  
al payments at the treasury including the pay­  
ment of the arrearages of the War Department,  
as well as the payment of a considerable excess,  
beyond the annual appropriation, will amount  
to about the sum of thirty eight millions of dol  
  
lars ) and that, consequently, at the close of  
  
the year, there will be a surplus in tbe treasury  
of about the sum of nine millions of uoiIaFJ.  
The operations of the treasury coutinued to  
be obstructed by difficulties, arising from the  
condition of the national currency ; but they  
have, nevertheless, beeq effectual, to a benefici­

has entrusted Congress, exclusively, with it..  
  
power ofcrealtng and regulating a currency of  
that description : and the measures which were  
taken during tbe last sessinu, iu execution af  
the power, give every promise of succes. The  
Bank of the United States has been 0rgsnFte4  
uuder auspiees the most favorable, and ean  
not tail to be an important auxiliary to thus  
measures.  
For a more enlarged view of the publie a-&#x27;  
nances, with a view of the measures punned  
by the Treasury Department, previous lo tha  
resignation of the late Secretery, 1 transmit ta&#x27;  
extract from the last report of that oSieer. Con.  
grest nill perceive in it, ample proofs of lbs  
solid foundation on which the financial prosper&quot;.  
ity oT the nation rests ; and will do justice ts  
the distinguished ability and successful exer.  
tions with which the duties of the department&#x27;  
were executed during a period reaiarkabU  
for its difficulties ami its peculiar perplexi­  
ties.The period of my retiring from the publie  
service, being at little distance, Jl shall find n  
occasion more proper than the present, for ex&#x27;,  
pressing to my fellow-citizens my deep sense sf  
the continued confidence and kind support,  
which I have received from them. Mv rrat.  
  
ful recollection of these distinguished marks of )  
  
their farorable regard ean never cease ) aad,  
with the consciousness, that if 1 have not serv-,  
  
ed my country with great ability, J have served .  
it with a sincere devotion, will accompany me  
as a source of unfailing-gratification.  
  
Happily, I shall carry with me from the pub  
He theatre, other sources, whiehrtboro who love !  
their country most will best appreciate, tsluul .  
behold it blessed with tranquility and proift&#x27; .  
ity at home, and with peaee and respect aetm &#x27;  
I ean indulge the proud reflection, that the  
merican people have reached in safety and lit,  
cess their fortieth year as an independeti J  
tion ; that for nearly an entire generation; they &#x27;  
have had experience of their present&#x27; ebof  
stitutibn, the offspring of their undisturbed de  
  
liberations, and of their free choice ; that they  
have found it to bear tbe trials of advarm a  
well as prosperous circumstances, to contain,  
in its combination of the federate and elective ,  
principles, a reconcilement of public strength;;  
with individual liberty, of national power for f  
tbe defence of national rights, with a security  
against wars of injustice, of ambition, or of ,  
vain glory, in the fundamental provision wbiebv  
subjects all questions of war to tbe will oftth  
nation ftself, which is to pay its costs and feel  
  
its calamities. Nor is it less a peculiar feiiu  
ty of this constitution, so dear tons all, tbat.it  
is found to be capable, without losing its vital  
energies, of expanding itself over a spaeioOl  
  
territory, with the increase and expansion of ,  
  
the community for whose benefit it was estes  
lished. . ,  
And may I not be allowed to add to this grii  
tifyine spectacle, that I shall read, in the cha-t  
  
racter of the American people, in their devotion :  
  
to true liberty, and to the conslitutiou&#x27;.wbich il  
  
its palladium, sure presages, that the destmea  
  
career of my country will exhibit a government;  
  
pursuing tbe public good as its sols objeci j  
and regulating its means by tbe great principle!  
consecrated in its charter, and by those moral  
prineiples to whieh they are so well allied ; A  
government which watehes over the purity sf  
  
elections, the freedom of speeeh.and of the preiV  
the trial by jury, and the equal interdict againft  
  
encroachments and compacts between &#x27; religion I  
  
and the state, which maintains inviolably  
  
maxims of public faith, Ithe security of persons  
  
and property, and encourages, in every authoif ,  
  
ised mode, that general littusion .of knowieago  
whieh guarantees to public liberty, its perma  
nencv. and to those who possess the blessing&#x27;s  
  
the true enjoyment of it : A government which  
  
avoids intrusion on the internal repose of ether ;

and ifihe house of Repnstn&#x27;alires.  
In rev if wing the present Mute of our country,  
our attention cannot be withheld front the eil».ct  
produced by peculiar .itasoii*, which havetery gvii  
e.ally impaired the annual gifts of the earth. Mui  
threatened scarcity id particular tlMrlcu. Such,  
however, is the variety of soils, of cEinal^s ilimI

’&gt;e necessary, our thankfulness is due to I’rovi  
tience, for what it far more than a coiapenn.1. &quot;i  
  
in the reauukable health which lias distinguished  
the present year. i ,  
A midst the advantages which have sflfs^cded Ul°

(irent Britain, iu a general invigc.ration V industry

the value of w hich is more and more die clo&#x27;ing il­

a depression is experienced by particular^  
of our mnnufnctii&#x27;iFt, «n&lt;l by a port ion of  
nation. As the ,‘irst proceeds,in an e«seiilii*|h&gt;&#x27;&#x27; &quot;M .e,  
f um an excess of imported merch■indiee,*^,.&gt; ^  
carries a check in its own tendency, t hr- ciu«f^M  
its prer-nt extent, cannot be of vri v long durations  
The evil will n it. however, be viewed by &lt; ungxss,  
without a recollection, that niamifaciuring estab­  
lishments, if su lie red to sitik too low, or Isngiudi  
too long, may not revive, alter the causes »ua||  
have ceased ; and that, in the vicissitudes of human  
affairs, situations may recur, iu which hdependence  
on fon-icm morces, for indispensable supplies, may  
be among the most serious embarrassment*  
&#x27;] he depressed state of o*r navigation, is to be  
ascribed, in a material degree, to its exclusion front  
the colonial ports ol tile nation most extensively  
connected with n« in commerce, and from the indi­  
rect operation of that exclusion. , . ...  
Previous t&gt;» ihc mte coovr«4ion at f,uii.i..u, ha—  
ttveen the l oiled xatcs&amp;Uiea itrifain the refa*  
tive slate of the na&gt; igalion Inwsof the two countriet  
growing out of the Ueaiy of had given to the  
&#x27;British navigation a material advantage over the  
! American, in the intercourse between the Anieri­  
; can ports and British poits in kurope. The cone  
! ventioii of London equidixcd the laws of the two  
[ countries, relating to those ports; leaving the in*  
| terconrse between our ports and the ports of the  
! British colonies, subject, as before, to the re»pcc­  
i tive regulations of the parlies, the British, gov­  
1 eminent, enforcing, now, regulations s hicb nr hib­  
it a trade between its cnlonie* and the Toiled  
i States, in American vessels, whilst they permit a  
! trade in Briti-h vessels, the Aineiican navigation  
loses accordingly ; and the loss is augmented by  
the advantage which is given to the British com­  
petition over the American, iu the navigation be­  
tween our pints and British ports in kurope, by  
the circuitous voyages, enjoyed by the one, atul  
not enjoyed by tile oilier. ,  
The reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity,  
applied to one branch of the commercial inter­  
course. has been pressed on our part, as eqiialh ap­  
plicable to both branches: but it is a#cei&#x27;airted,  
timi the British Cabinet declines all negnciuii.ja  
on the subject; w ith a disavowal, however, of any  
disposition to view, in an Unfriendly light, what­  
ever countervail- ? legulntions the Vnitcd States  
mav oppose to the regulations of which they com­  
plain. Ti e wisdom of the Legislature will decide  
on the course, whieli, under these circumstances, it  
prescribed by a joint regard to the amicable rela?  
lions between the two nations aud to the just inter­  
ests of the Tailed States.  
  
1 have the satisfaction to state, generally, that  
ive remain in amity with foreign powers.  
An occurrence has, indeed, taken place in the  
Gulf of Mexico, which, if sanctioned hy the Spaa­  
i-h government, may make an exception a« to that  
power* According to the report of our naval cotu­  
matider on tlm&#x27; station, one of our public armed  
vessel* was attacked by an overpowering force un­  
der a Spanish commander, and the American flag,  
with the officers and crew, iniulieil, in a manner  
calling for prompt repara&#x27;ion. &#x27;I his has been de­  
manded. in the mean time, a frigate and smaller  
vessel of war have been ordered into that Gulf, for  
the protection of our commerce. It would be im­  
proper to omit lhat the representative of his catho­  
1 lie uiajesty.in the United Mate*,lost no time in giv*  
| ing the strongest assurances, that no hostile order  
could have emanated from bis government, and  
that it will b** as ready to do, as to expect, what­  
ever the nature, of the case, and the friendly rela­  
tions of the two countries, shall be founrltore­  
i quire.  
The posture of our affair* with Algiers, attho  
present ru uncut, is not known. The Dey, drawing  
pretexts from circumstances for which the United  
State* were not answerable, addressed a letter to  
llij government, declaring the treaty last conclu­  
ded with him, to lmve been annulled by our viola­  
tion of it; and presenting, as the alternative, war,  
or a renewal of the former treaty, w hich stipulated,  
among other things, an annual tribute. The an­  
swer, with an explicit declaration that the United  
Stales preferred war to tribute, required his recog­  
nition and observance of the treaty last made,  
which abolishes tribute, and the slavery of our cap­  
tured citizens* The result of the answer has not  
been received. , Should be renew hi* warfare on  
i our commerce, we rely on the protection it will  
I find in our naval force actually in the Mediterrane­  
  
With the other Barbary states our affairs have  
[ undergone no change.  
The Indian tribes within our limits appear also  
disposed to remain at peace. From several of them  
purchases of lands have been made, particularly  
| favorable to the wishes and security of our frontier  
settlements, as well as to the general interests of  
the nation. In some instances, the. titles, though  
not supported by due proof, and clashing those of  
one tribe with the claims of another, have been ex*  
tinguished by double purchases; the benevolent  
policy of the United &#x27;states preferring the augtnen­  
tril expense, to the hazard of doing injustice, or to  
the enforcement of justice aguinsta feeble and un­  
tutored people, by menus involving or threatening  
| an effusion of blood. 1 am happy to add, that the  
1 tranquility which has lieert respired among the  
tribes themselves, a« well as between them and our  
o wn population, w ill favor the resumption of the  
work of civilisation, which had made an encoura­  
ging progress among some tribes; and that the fa­  
cility is increasing, for extending that divided and  
individual ownership, which exists now in movea*  
hie property only, to the soil itself; aipl of thin  
establishing in tiie culture an,! improvement of it,  
(he true foundation for a transit from the habits of  
the savage to the arts and comforts of social life.  
As a subject of the highest importance to this  
national welfare, I must, again, earnestly recom­  
mend to the consideration of Congress, a reorgani­  
zation of the Militia, on a plan which w ill form it  
into ciasses, according to the periods of life more  
and less adapted to military services. An efficient  
militia is authorized nnd contemplated by the con­  
•timtioit, and required by the spirit and safety of  
free government. The present organization of our  
militia is universally regarded as less efficient than  
it ought to he made ,* anJ no organization can be  
(letter cal til a ted to give to it its due force, than u  
classification which will assign the foremost place  
in the defence of i lie country, to that portion of its  
citizens, whose activity and animation best enabl*  
them to rally to its standard. Besides the consid­

sonable occasion, also, lor inquiring how fur Leg­  
islative inteqiosition may be further requisite in  
providing penalties fur otfcncei designated in the  
constitution or in the statutes, and to which either  
no penalties are annexed, or none with sutlicieut  
certainly. And 1 submit to the wisdom of Cou­  
srsai, whether a more enlarged revival of the crim­  
inal bode be not expedient, for tbe purpose of initi­  
Sating, in certain cases, penalties which were a­  
_ opted into it, antecedent to experiments und ex­  
atnplei which justify and recommend a more lenient  
policy,  
l’be United States haring been the fit st to aboi­  
i h, within the extent of their authority, the  
transportatio.i of the natives of Africa into slavery,  
by prohibiting the introduction of slaves, and by  
punishing their citizens pujtioipqt jjag ia-th« trallic,  
cannot but be&#x27;gratified at the progress made by  
concurrent efforts of other nations, towards a gen­  
eral suppression of so great an evil, &#x27;fhey mu*1  
feel, at the same time, the greater solicitude to give  
the fullest efficacy to their own regulations. »itb  
that view, the interposition of Congress appears to  
be required by the violations and evasions which,it  
Is suggested, are chargeable on unworthy citterns,  
who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flags,  
•Ad with foreign ports; and by conclusive impor­  
tations of slaves into the United States, through  
adjoining ports and territories. I present the sub­  
ject to Congress with a full assurance of their dis­  
position to apply all the remedy which can be  
afforded by au amendment of the law. 1 he regu­  
lation* which were intended to guard against abuses  
of a kindred character, in the irade between tin­  
saveral states, ought also to bo rendered more effec­  
tual for theii humane object.  
To these recommendations. I add, for the consid­  
eration of Congress, the expediency of a re-iaodih­  
catio i of tbe Judiciary establishment, and of an ad­  
ditional department in the Executive branch of thi  
government.  
The firat is called for by the accruing business  
Which necessarily swells the duties of the Federal  
Courts ; and by the great and widening space,  
within which justice is to be dispensed by them.  
The tune seems to have arrived, which claims for  
members of the- upreme Court a relief from itine­  
rary fatigdes, incompatible, as well with tbe age  
which a portion of them will always have attained,  
as with tha researches and preparations which are  
dite to their stations, and to the juridical reputation  
of)iheir country. And considerations equally co­  
gent require a more convenient organisation of the  
subordinate tribunals, which may be accomplished  
without an objectionable increase of the number or  
•Xjpence of the Judges.  
The extent and variety of Executive business,  
also accumulating with the progress of our conntry  
afld its growing population, ca&#x27;I for an additional  
department, to be charged with duties sow over­  
burdening other departments, and with such as have  
not been annexed to any department.  
The coarse of experience recommends, as anoth­  
er improvement in the Executive establishment.that  
the provision for the station of Attorney ticneral,  
whose residence at the seat of government, ofticinl  
connection* with it and management of the public  
bosincssVifore the Judiciary, preclude an extensive  
participation in professional emoluments, be made  
more adequate to his services and his relinquish­  
ments; and that, whh a view to bis reasonable ac­  
commodation, and to a proper depository of his offi  
chtl opinion* and proceedings, there be included in  
the provision, the usual appurtenances to a public  
office. - - •  
  
in directing tne legislative attention to the state  
of the finances, it is a subject of great gratification  
to find, that, even within the chon period which  
has elapsed, since the return of peace, the revenue  
has far exceeded all the current demands upon thr  
treasury, and that, under any probable diminution  
of its future animal product, w bicb thr vicissitudes  
of com.iteree may occasion, it Mill afford an ample  
fund for the eftciual and early extinguishment of  
the public debt. It has been estimated, that during  
the year 1816, the actual receipts of revenue at the  
treasury, including the balance at the commence­  
ment of the year, and excluding the proceeds of  
loans and treasury notes, will amount to about the  
sum of forty seyen .jnillions of dollars ; that during  
the same year, the actual payment of arrearages of  
the War Department, as well as the payment of  
a considerable excess, beyond the annual appropri­  
ations, will amount to about the sum of thirty eight  
millions of dollar*; aetf that, consequently, at the  
Close of the year, there will be a surplUf in the trea­  
sury of about tin* sum of nine millions of dollars.  
The operations of the treasury continue to he ob­  
structed by difficulties, arising from the condition  
of the national currency ; hut they have, neverthe­  
less, been effectual, to a beneficial extent, in the  
reduction of the public debt, and the establishment  
of the public credit. The floating debt of treasury  
notes and temporary loans, will soon be entirely  
discharged. &#x27;1 be aptrregate of the funded drill,  
composed of debts inerted duiingjthe wars of 1776,  
and of 181$. lias been estimated, with reference to  
the first of January next, at a sum not exceeding  
one hundred and ten millions of dollars. The ordi­  
nary annual expences of the government, for tin  
maintenance of all its institutions, civil, military,  
and naval, have been estimated at a sum less than  
twenty millions of dollars. And the permanent re­  
venue, to be derived from all the existing sources,  
has been estimated at u sum of about twenty five  
millions of dollars.  
Upon this general view of the subject, it is obvi­  
ous, that there is only wanting, to the final pros­  
perity of the government, the restoration of an uni­  
form medium of exchange. The resource* and tin  
faith of the nation, displayed in the system which  
Congress has established, ensure respect and confi­  
dence at home an abroad. The loca accumula­  
tions of the revei i.. have already ei aided the trea­  
sury to meet the public engagement* in th» h &lt;  
currency of most r&gt;t ’lie states: and it is expect*&#x27;,  
that the saute cans, will produce the same edec  
throughout the Union. But, for the interests oi  
the coiumuaity at large, as well as for the purposes  
  
of the treasury, it is essential that the nation should  
possess a currency of equal value, credit and use  
wherever it may circulate. The constitution has  
entrusted Congress, exclusively, vvitli the power of  
treatinami regulating a currency of that descrip­  
tion ; and the measures which were taken during  
the last session,in execution of the power, give eve­  
ry promise of success J lie Aank of the I&#x27;m ted  
Stakes lew been organized under auspices the most  
favourable, and cannot lail to be an important aux­  
iliary to those measures.

with a view of the measures pursued by the 1 rea­  
sury Department, pic&gt;ious to the resignation of  
llielate Seeiclary, i transmit an extract from the

have reached in safety and success their fortieth

entire gvucialiou, they have had experience &lt; t  
their present constitution, the offspring of their uti  
disturbed deliberations and of tlicir free choice ;  
that they have found it to bear the trials ol adverse  
as well as prosperous circumstances, to contain, in  
its combination of the letierute and elective princi­  
ples, a reconcilement of public strength with indi­  
vidual liberty, of national power for ilie defence of  
national rigtus, with a security against wars ot in

An occurrence has, indeed, taken place  
in the Galph of Mexico, which if sanction-  
ed by the Spanish government, may make  
an exception as to that power. According  
to the report of our vaval commander, on  
that station, one of our public armed ves-  
sels was attacked by an overpowering force  
under a Spanish commander, ana the A-  
merican flag, with the officers and crew  
iusulted, in a manner calling for prompt  
reparation. ‘his hasbeen demanded. In  
  
the mean time, a frigate and smatier vessel  
of warhave been ordered into that Culph,  
for the protection of our commerce. It  
would be improper to ont. that the rep-  
  
reseufatlives of his Cathole Majesty, in the  
United &gt;taies, lost no time in giving the  
stronse-t assurances, tbat 10 hestile order  
could Lave emanated from his government,  
&amp; that it will be as ready to do as to expect,  
whatever the nature of the case, and the  
friendiy relations of the two countries,  
shall be found to require.  
  
The posture of our affairs with Algiers,  
af the present moment, is notknowa. ‘The  
Dey drawitg pretexis from circumstances  
for which the Cinted States were not ane  
¢werabic. addressed a letter to this govern-

with hin, to have been annulled by our

fiesiv, which stipulated, among other  
things, an annual tribute. The answer,  
with au eaplicit declaration that tbe Uait-

his recognition &amp; observance ot the treaiy

llements; as well as fo the general inter-  
ests of the nation. In some instances,  
the titles. though not supported by dus  
proof, and clashing those of one tribe with  
the claims of another, have been extins  
guished by double purchases ; the benevoe  
lent nolice of the United States prefer-  
  
| ring the augmented expense to the hazard  
  
of doing injustice, or to the emorcement  
of justice, against a feeble and un-  
tutored people, by means involving or  
threatening an effusion of blood. IT am  
happy to add, that the tranquility which  
has been restored among the tribes them-  
selves, as well es between them and our  
own population, will favor the resumption  
of the werk of civilization, which shad  
made an encouraging progress among  
some tribes; and that the facility is increas-  
  
&#x27;ing, for extending that divided and indi-  
  
videal ownership, whica exists now in  
moveable property only, to the seil itself;  
and cf thus establishing ia the culture and  
improvement of it, (he true foundation for  
a transit from the habits of the savage, to  
the arts and comforis ef secial life.

Congress, a re-organization of the Militia,  
onaplan which will form it into classes,  
  
| according to the periods of life mor&gt; and  
Jess adepted to military services.

the spirit and safety of tree government.  
Congress willcall to mind, that no ade-  
  
quate provision has yet beea made for the  
  
ternative, war, ora renewal o1 the former | uniformity of weights and measures, also  
  
contemplated by the constitution. The  
great ytility of a standard, fixed in its ne  
  
‘ture, and foundation on the easy rule of  
  
decimal propcrtions, is sufficiently eby  
vious.  
  
‘he importance which I have attached  
to the establishment of a University with-  
in this District, on a scale and for objects  
worthy of the American nation, induces  
ine to renew my recommendation of it to  
ihe favorable considerarion of Congiess.

Fello w Citizen* of the Senate,  
  
uml of the House of hepre tentative*,  
  
In reviewing the present state of our coun-  
try, our attention cannot be withheld from the  
effect produced by peculiar seasons, which  
have very generally impaired the annual £ifts  
of the earth, and threaten scarcity in particular  
districts. Such however, is the variety of soils,  
of climates, and of pioducts, within our exten-  
sive limits, that tlieairffrefraie resources lor sub-  
sistence, are more than sufficient for the ac’gre-  
pate wants. And, as far as an economy of con-  
sumption, more than usual, may he necessary,  
our thankfulness is due to Providence, for what  
is far more than a compensalit n, in the  
m.irkahle hcakh which has distinguished the  
present year.  
  
Amidst the advantages which have succeed-  
ed the peace of Kurope, and that of the Uni-  
ted Sta’es with Great Britain, m a general in-  
vigoration of industry among us, and in the  
extension of our commerce, the value of which  
is more and more disclosing itself to commer-  
cial nations, it is to be regretted that a depres-  
sion is experienced by particular branches of  
our manufactures, and by a portion of our navi-  
gation. As the first proceeds, in an essential  
degree, from an excess of imported merchan

tlie national welfare, I must, again, earnestly re-  
commend to the consideration of Congress, a  
re organization of the militia, on a plan which  
will form it into classes, according to the pe-  
ri ds of life more and less adapted to military  
services. An efficient militia is authorised  
and contemplated by the constitution, and re*  
rjuired by the spirit and safety of a tree govern-  
ment. The present organization of our mili-  
tia is universally regarded as less efficient  
than it ought to be made; and no organiza-  
tion can be better calculated to give to it its due  
force, than a classification which will assign  
&lt;he foremost place in the defence of the coun-  
try, to that portion of its citizens, whose ac-  
tivity and animation best enable them to rally  
to its standard. Besides the consideration  
that a time of peace is the time when the  
change can be made v* i tli the most conveni-  
ence and equity, it will now be aided by the  
experience of a recent war, in which the mi-  
litia bore so interesting a part.  
  
Congress wiji call to mind, that no adequate  
provision lias yet been made lor the uniformi-  
ty of weights :.nd measures, also contemplated  
in the constitution. The great utility of u  
standard, fixed in its nature, and founded on  
the easy rule of decimal proportions, is suffi-  
ciently obvious It led tl.e governmint, at an  
early stage, to preparatory steps for intro-  
ducing it ; and a completion of the woik will  
be a just title to the publ c gratitude.  
  
The ir port at, ce which I have attached to  
the establishment of a University Within this  
District, on a scale and for objtcts worthy of  
the American nation, induces ine to renew my

reference lo the first ol January next, at a sum  
noi exceeding one hundred and ten millions of  
dollars. The ordinary annual expenses of the  
government, for the maintenance of ail its in-  
stitutions, civil, military and naval, have been  
estimated at a sum less than twenty millions  
of dollars. And the permanent revenue, to  
be derived from all the existing sources, has  
been estimated at a sum ol about twenty-five  
millions of dollars.  
  
Upon tins general view of tlie f ubject, it is  
obvious, that there is only wanting, :o tl.e fis-  
cal prosperity of the government, the restora-  
tion of an uniform medium of exchange 1 lie  
resources and the faith of the nation, display-  
ed in tl.e system which congress has estab-  
lished, insure lespect and confidence both at  
home and abroad. Tlie local accumulations  
of the revenue haie already enabled the trea-  
sury to inee&#x27; the public engagements in the  
local currency of most of the slates ; and i;  
is expected that the same cause will produce  
the same effect, throughout the union But  
for the interest of t lie community at large, as  
well as for the purposes of ihe treasury, it is  
essential that the nation should possess a cur-  
rency of equal value, credit and use, wherever  
it may circulate. The constitution has en-  
trusted congress, c-xcluaively, with the power  
of creating and regulating a currency ot that  
description ; and the measures which were ta-  
ken during the last session, in ixccution of  
the power, give every promise of success.  
The Bank of the United States has been or-  
ganized under auspices the most fsvoiable,  
and cannot fail to be an important auxiliary to  
those measuies.  
  
For a mote enlarged view of the public fi-  
nances, with a view of the measures pursued  
by the T reasury Department, previous to the  
resignation ol the lute secretary, 1 trjcsmit  
an extract from the last report of that officer.  
Congress will peiceive m it, ample p real’s of  
the solid Inundation on which the financial  
prosperity of the nation veils ; and will do  
justice to tlie distinguished and successful ex*  
ei tions with « Inch the duties of the depart-  
ment were executed during a period remarka-  
ble lor US difficulties and its peculiar perplex-  
ities.  
  
The period cf my retiring from the public  
service, being at little distance, I shall had no  
occasion more pr per than the present, for  
expressing to my fellow-citizens my deep  
tense of the continued confidence and kind  
j ipport which I have received from iln iu.  
My grateful recollection of ihe-e distinguish-  
ed maiksof their favorable regard can never  
cease ; and, with the consciousness, that it I  
have nut served my coun.ry with greater abil-  
ity, I have servtd it with sincere devotion,  
will accompany me as a source of unfailing  
gratification.  
  
Happily, I shall carry with me from the pub-  
lic Vheai re, other sources, which those wins  
love tl.eir country more will be-st appreciate.

that the American people have reached in saf:-

p.n.icni nation ; that fi.r nearly an entire gene-  
ration, they have had experience of their present  
constitution, the- offspring of their undisturbed,  
deliberations and of them irre choice; that they  
huve found it to bear the trials of adverse us

in its combination of the lederate and elective

! any measure emanating from the king double purchases ; the benevolent policy of the  
was contrary to the constitution of the 1 United Stales preferring the augmented ex-  
  
tion it. In consequence of this refusal,  
the viceroy (Espelatc) arrested the whole  
of them in their beds, and put them into  
prison.  
  
By accounts from Rondo, July 20, it  
ap|&gt;cars that there are great commotions  
in the Spanish armies. Oiflcers and sol-  
diers are constantly murmuring that the  
king thinks of nothing but of fattening  
the monks and canons, like hogs, while  
the military we suffered to perish.  
  
that the tranquility which lias been restored  
among the tribes themselves, as well as betwenn  
them aud our own population, v.-ill favour the  
resumption of the work of civilization, which  
had made an encouraging progress among some  
tribes; and that the facility is increasing, fin-  
extending that divided and individual owner-  
ship, which exists now, in moveable property  
only, to Ihe soil itself; and of thus establishing  
in the culture and improvement of it, the true  
foundation for a transit from the habits of the  
savage, to the arts and comforts of social life-  
As i subject of the highest importance to  
  
object.  
  
I&#x27;u &#x27;hose recommendations, I add, for lie  
considerat ion of Congress, t lie expedi ency of a  
re-modification of the judiciary establishment,  
and of an additional department in the Execu-  
tive brunch of the government .  
  
The first is cuJJpd lor by Hie accruing busi-  
ness, which &quot;cc Ls.irily swells the duties of the  
Federal Courts, and by the groat aud widening  
space, within which justice is to he dispensed  
by them. The time seems to have arrived,  
which claims for members of the Supreme  
Court a relief from itinerary fatigues, incom-  
putable, as well with the age which a portion  
of them will always have attained as with the  
researches and preparation which arc due- to  
their stations, aud to the juridical reputation of  
their country . And considerations equally co-  
gent, require a more convenient organization of  
the subordinate tribunals, which may be accom-  
plished without an objectionable increase of the  
number or expense of tlie Judges.  
  
The extent and variety of Executive busi-  
ness, also accumulating with the progress of  
our country, audits growing population, call  
for an additional department, to be charged  
with duties now overburdening other depart-  
ments, and with sucii as have not been annexed  
to any department.  
  
The courts of experience recommends as an-  
other improvement ill the Executive eslal&gt;i em-  
inent, that the provision for the station of At-  
torney General, whose residence at the seat of  
government, official connections with it, and  
management of the public business before the  
Judiciary, preclude an extensive participation  
in professional emoluments, be made more*ad-  
equate to his services and his relinquishments ;  
and lhal, with a view to his reasonable accom-  
modation, ai-d to a proper depository of his of-  
ficial opinions and proceedings, there be includ-  
ed in the provision the Usual appurtenances to  
a public office.  
  
In directing the legislative attention to the  
slate of the finances, it is a subject of great gra-  
tification to find, that, even within the short pe-  
riod which has elapsed since the return of peace  
the revenue lias fair exceeded all the current  
demands upon the treasury, and that, under a-  
iiv probable diminution of its future annual pro-  
duct, which tlie vicissitudes of commerce may-  
occasion, it will afford an ample fund for the  
effi etna! and early extinguishment of the pub-  
lic dept. H has been estimated, that during  
theyear 1316, the actual receipts of the reve-  
nue at the treasury, including the balance at  
.the commencement of the year, and excluding  
the proceeds of loans . -iid treasury notes, will  
amount to about the sum of forty-seven millions  
of dollars; that during the same year, the ac-  
tual payments at the treasury including the  
payment of the arrearage ^ of the War depart-  
ment, as well as the payment of a considerable  
excess, beyond the annual appropriation, will  
amount to about the sum of thirty-eight mil-  
lions of dollars; and that, consequently, at the  
close of the year, there will be a surplus in the  
treasury of about the sum of nine millions of  
dollars.  
  
The operations of the treasury continue to  
be obstructed by difficulties, arising f&gt;om the  
condition of the national currency ; but they

Fellow citizens of the Senate, :  
  
and of the House of Representatives,  
  
In reviewiag the present state of our country,  
our attention cannot be withheld from the effect  
  
rodaced by pecaliar seasons, which have very  
  
generally impaired the the annual gifts ofthe earth,  
and threaten scarcity in particular districts.—  
Such, however, is the variety of soils, of climates,  
and of products, within our extensive limits, that  
the aggregate resources for subsisteace, are more  
than sufficient for the aggregate wants. And as  
far as an economy of consumption, more than a-  
sual may be necessary, our thankfulness is due to  
Providence, for what Is far more than acompen.  
gation, in the remarkable health which has distin-  
  
isned the present year.  
- Amidst the advantages which have succeeded  
the peace of Europe, and that ofthe United  
States with Great Britain, in a general invigo.  
ration of industry among us, and 10 the extension  
of uur commerce, the value of which is more and  
more disclosing itselfto commercial nations, it is  
to be regreited that a depression is experienced  
by particualar branches of our manufactures, and  
by a portion of our navigation, Ashe first pro-  
ceeds, in an essential degree, from an excess of  
imported merchandize, which carries a check in  
its own tendency, the cause in its present extent,  
eannot be of very long duration, The evil will  
not, however, be viewed by Congress, without a  
recoliection, that manufacturing establishments,  
ifsuff-red to sink too low, or languish too leng,  
may uot revive, after the causes shall have ceas-  
ed ; and that, in the vicissitudes of haman affuirs,  
situations may recur,in which a dependence on  
foreign sources fur indispensable supplies, may  
beamong the most serious embarrassments,  
  
The depressed state of our navigation is to be  
ascribed, in a material degree, to its exclusion  
from the colonial ports of the nation most exten-  
  
‘sively ¢ onected with us incom neree, and from  
  
the indirect operation of that exclusion.  
  
Previous ts the late convention at London, be-  
tween the United Siates and Great Britain, the  
relative state of the navigation laws ef the two  
cuunries, growing out of the treaty of 1794 had  
g&#x27;ven to the British navization a material advan-  
tage over the American, in the intercourse be-  
tween the American aod British ports in Eu-  
rope. Tae coavention of London equalized the  
laws ofthe two countries, relating to those ports ;  
leaving the intercourse between our ports and  
the poris of the Briiisis colonies, subject as befure  
tothe respective regulations ot the parties. . The  
British goverament, enforcing now, cezelations  
Which prohibit a trade between its colonies and  
the Uaited States, in American vessels, whilst  
they permit a trade in British vessels, the Ameri-  
Can Qawgation loses accordingly ; and the floss ts  
augmeiited by the advantage which is given tothe  
British competition over the American in the aa-  
V&#x27;gatton between our ports and British ports in  
Europe, by the circuitous voyages, enjoyed by  
the one, aud aot by ihe other,  
  
he reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity,  
applied to une branch of the commercial inter-  
Course, aas been pressed on our part as equaily  
  
  
  
167  
  
applicable to both branches ; but :t is ascertained  
that the British Cabinet declines all negociation  
on the subject; with a disavowel, however, of  
any disposition to view, ia ao unfriendly light,  
whatever countervailing regulations the United  
States may oppose te the regalations of which  
they complain. The wisdom of the Legistatare  
will decide on the course, whieh under these cir-  
cumstances, is prescribed by ajoint regard to the  
amicable relations between the two nations, and  
to the just taterests of the United States.  
  
I have the satisfaction to -tate, generrally, that  
‘we remain in amity with foreign powers.  
  
An oceurrence has indeed taken plaec in the  
gulf of Mexico, which if sanctioned by the Span-  
ish government, may make an exception as to  
that power. According to the report of our oa-  
val commander on that station,-onc of our public  
armed vessels was aliacked by an overpowering  
force, under a Spanish commander. and the A-  
merican flag, with the officers and crew, insulted  
in a manner calling for promps reparation. ‘Phis  
has been de:nanded. ‘8 the meau tine, a frig-  
ate and smaller vessel of war have been ordered  
into that Gulf, for the protection of our com.  
merce. It would be improper to omit, that the  
representative of his Catholic Majesty, in the  
United States, lost no time in giving the strong  
est assurances, that no hostile order could have  
emanated from his government, and that it will  
be as ready to do, as to expect, whatever the na-  
ture of the case, and the friendly relations of the  
two countries, shall be found to require.  
  
The posture of our affairs with Algiers, at the

As asubject of the highest importance to the  
national welfare, [ must, again, earnestly recom-  
mend to the consideration of Congress, a re-  
organization of the Militia, on a plan which wii  
form it into classes, according to the periods of  
lite more and less adapted to military services.  
An efficient militia is authorised and ~w atem-  
plated by the constitution, and required by the  
Spirit and safety of free government. The pre-  
sent organization of our militia is uaiversally re-  
garded as less efficient than it ought to be mare:  
and no organization can be better calculated to  
give to it its due force, than a classification which  
will assign the foremost place in the defence of  
the country, to that portion of its citiz?ns, whose  
activity and animation best enable them to rally  
to its standard. Besides the consideration that a  
time of peace is the time when the change can be  
made with must convenience and equity, it will  
now be aided by the experience of a recent war,  
in which the militia bore so interesting a part.  
Congress will call to mind, that no adequate  
provision has yet been made for the oniformity  
of weights and measures, also contemplated by  
the constitution. ‘The great utility of a standard,  
fixed in its nature, and founded on the easy rule  
of decimal proportions, is sufficiently obvious,  
I: led the government, at an early stage, to  
preparatory steps for introducing tt, and a com-

of them purchases of lands have been made, par.  
ticularly favourable to the wishes and security of  
our frontier settlements, as well as to the general

reduction of the pablick debt, and the establish-

ment of the law.  
  
intended to guard against abuses ofa kindred cha. -  
  
racter, in the trade between the several states,  
eught also to be rendered more effectual for their  
humane object. | :  
  
To these recommendations, I add for the eon.  
sideration of Congress, the expediency ofa re-  
modification of the judiciary establishment, and  
of an additional department im the Exécutive  
_branch ef the government.  .. .  
  
The first is called for by the accruing business,  
which necessarily swells the daties of the Federal  
Courts, and by the great and widening space,  
within which jastice is to be dispensed by ‘them,  
The time seems to have arrived, which claims  
for members of the Supreme Court a relief from  
luueravy fatigues, incumpatible,as well with the  
age which a portion of them will alwaye have at.  
tained as with the researches and preparations  
which are due to their stations, and to the juri-  
dical reputation cf the country. And considera-  
tions equally cogent require a more convenient  
organization of .the subordiaate tribunals, which  
may be accomplished without an objectionable  
increase of the number or expense of the Judges.  
  
The extent and variety of Executive business,  
also, accuinulating with the progress of our coun  
try, and its growing population, call for an addi-  
  
lienal department, to be charged with duties now  
overburdening other deyartments, and with such  
as have not been annexed to any department.  
  
The course of experience recommends as ano.  
ther improvementin the Executiveestablishment,  
that the provision for the station of Attorney Gen.  
eral. whose residence at the seat of gevernment,  
official connections with it, and management .of  
the pablick business before the Judiciary, pre  
clude an extensive participation in professional  
emoluments, be made naore adequate to his servi.  
ces and his rcelinquishments ; and that, with a  
view to his reasonable accommodation, and toa  
proper depository of his official opinions and pro  
geedings, there be included in the provision the  
usual appurtenances to a publick office.  
  
in directing the legislative attention to the  
state of the finances, it is a subject of great grati-  
fication to find, that, even within the dort period  
which has elapsed since the return of peace the  
revenue has far exceeded all the current demands  
wpon the treasury, and that under any probable  
diminution of its future annual product, which the  
vicissitudes of commerce way occasion, it will af-  
ford an amnple fund for the effectual and early ex-  
tinguishment ofthe publick debt. It has been es-  
timated, that during the year 1816, the ac.  
tual receipts of revenue at the treasury, incla-  
ding the balance at the commencement of the year,  
and excluding the proceeds of loans and treasury  
notes, will amount to about the sam of forty-seven  
millions of dollars ; that doring the same year,  
the actual pay ments at the Treasury including the  
payment of the arrearages of the War Depart-  
ment, as well as the payment of a considerable  
‘excess, beyond the annaal appropriation, will a-  
  
mount te about the sum of thirty eight millions of  
  
dolla- ; and that, consequently, at the close of the  
year, there will be a surplus in the treasary of a-  
bout the sum of nine millions of dollars.  
  
The operations of the treasury continue to be  
Y@bsiructed by difficulties, arising (rom the condi-  
  
The regulations which were ‘ted, with reference to the first of January next, at  
acum nat exceeding one hucdred an ten millions  
of dollars,

tions, civil, mifitary, and naval, have been esti  
mated at a sum tess than twenty miflicos of dol

The ordinary anvualexpenses of the  
  
nentrevenac to be derived  
from all the éxisting soerces, has cen estimated  
at asum of abotit twenty’ five millions of dollars.  
  
Upon this-general view of the subject, it is ob.  
vious, there is oaty wanting, to the fiscal prespeit.  
  
ty of the gevernment, the restoration of ati uni  
  
form medium efexchange. The resources aad  
  
the faith of the nation, displayed im the system  
  
which ©ongress has established, ensure respect  
  
and confidence both at home and abroad. The  
  
local accumulstions of the revenue have already  
  
enabled the treasury to meet the public engage-  
  
ments in the focal currency of most of the states ;  
and it is expected the same cause will produce ihe  
same effect, throughout the union. Bat for the  
interests of the comnmunity at large. as well as for  
the purposes of the treasury, it is essential that the  
nation should possess a currency of equal value,  
credit and use, wherever it may circulate. The  
constitution has entrusted Congress, exclusively,  
with the power of creating and regulating a cur-  
rency of that description ; and- the measures  
which were taken during the last sessien, in exe-  
cation of the power, give every promise of suc-  
cess. The Bank of the United States has bven  
organized under auspices the most favourabte,  
and cannot: fail to be an insportant auxiliary to  
those measures.  
  
Fora more enlarged view of the measures pur-  
sued by the ‘Treasu&#x27;y Department, previous to  
the resignation of the late Secretary, I transmit  
an extract from the last report of that officer.  
Congress will perceive in it ample proofs of the  
solid foundation on which the finanicel prosperity  
of the nation rests; and will do justice to the dis-  
tinguished ability and successful exertions with  
which the duties of the department were executed  
during a period remarkabie for its difficulties and  
its peculiar perplexities.  
  
The period of my retiring from the publick ser-  
vice, being at a little distance, I shall find ne oc-  
casion more proper than the present, for express-  
ing to my fellow citizens my deep sense of the  
continued confidence and kind support which I  
have received from then. My grateful recollec-  
tion of these distinguished marks of their favour-  
able regard can never cease ; and, with the con-  
sciousness, that if | have not served my country  
with greater ability, I have served it-with a sin-  
cere devotion, will accumpany me as a source of  
unfailing gratification.  
  
Happily, I shalf carry with me from the pub-  
lick theatre, other sources, which those who love  
their country most will best appreciate. I shall  
behold it blessed with tranquillity and pany  
at home, and with peace and respect abroad.  
ean indulge the proud reflection, that the Ameri-  
can people have reached in safety and success  
  
their fortieth year es an indepesdent nation ; that  
for nearly an entire generation, they have had ex-  
perience of their present constitution, the offsprir g  
of their undisturbed deliberations and of theis free  
choiee ; that they have found it to bear the ti als  
of adverse.as weil as prosperous circumstances, to

without losing its vital -energies, of expanding i,

the American people in their devotion to true kj.

ages, in every authorised mode, that general dif.  
fusion of knowledge which guarante:s to publick  
liberty its permanency, and to those whe possess  
the bicasing, the true enjoyment of it: a govern.  
ment which avoids intrusions on the internal re-  
pose of other nations, and repels them from its  
own ; which does justice to all nations with a  
readiness equal to the firmness with which it re-  
  
vires justice frem them ; and which, while it re-  
ance ite domestick code from every ingredient  
not congenial with the precepts of an enlightened  
  
age, and the sentiments of a virtuous pegple,.  
  
seeks, by appeals to reason, and its liberal exam-  
ples, to infuse inte the law which governs (he ct  
vilized world, a spirit which may diminish the  
frequency, or circumseribe the calamities of war,  
and meliorate the social and beneficent relattons  
of peace: a government, in a word, whose con-  
duct, within and without, may bespeak the most  
noble of ali ambitions, that of promoting peace  
on earth. and good will to man.

of my days, will animate my prayers for the hap-  
piness of my beloved country, and a perpetuity  
of the institations under which it is enjoyed.

he Message commences thus :—* In  
reviewing the present state of our country,  
our attention cannot be withheld from the  
effect produced by peculiar seasons, which  
have very generally impaired the annual  
gifts of the earth, and threatened scarcity  
in particular districts. Such, however, is  
the variety of soils, of climates, and of  
products, within our extensive lim&#x27;ts, that  
the aggregate resources for subsistence are  
more than sufficient for the aggregate  
wants, And, as far as economy of con-  
sumption, more than usual, may be neces-  
sary, our thankfulness is due to Provi-  
dence for what is far more than a com-  
pensation, in the remarkable hez!th which  
has distinguished the present year. Amidst  
the advantages which have succeeded the  
peace of Europe, and that of the United  
States with Great Britain, in a general in-  
vigoration of industry among us, and in  
the extension of our commerce, the value  
of which is more and more disclosing  
itself

itself to commercial nations, it is to be re-  
gretted that a depression is experienced  
by particular branches of our manufac-  
tures, and by a portion of our navigation.  
As the first proceeds, in an essential de-  
gree, from an excess of imported mer-  
chandize, which carries a check in its  
own tendency, the cause, in its present  
extent, cannot be of very long duration.  
The evi! wil! not, however, be viewed by  
Congress without a recollection, that ma-  
nufacturing establishments, if suffered to  
sink too low, or languish too long, may  
not revive after the causes shall have  
ceased; and that in the vieissitudes of  
buman affairs, situations may recur, in  
which a dependence on foreign sources,  
for indispensable supplies, may be among  
the most serious ewbarrassmenis.  
  
* The depressed state of our naviga-  
tion is to be ascribed, in a material de-  
gree, to its exclusion from the colonial  
ports of the nation most extensively con-  
nected with us in commerce, and from the  
indirect operation of that exclusion.— Pre-  
vious to the late convention at Londvun,  
between the United States aud Great Bri-  
tain, the relative state of the Navigation  
Laws of the two countries, growing out of  
the treaty of 1794, had given to the Bri-  
tish navigation a material advantage over  
the American, in the intercourse between  
the American ports and Biuitish ports in  
Europe. The Convention of London  
equalized the laws of the two countries,  
relating to those ports ; leaving the imter-  
course between our ports and the ports of  
the Britizh Colonies, subject as before to  
the respective regulations of the parties,  
+The British Government enforcing new  
regulations which prohibit a trade be-  
teen its colonies and the United States in  
American vessels, whilst they permit a  
trade in British vessels, the American na-  
vigation loses accord:ngly ; and the loss is  
augmented by the advantage which is  
givento British competition over the Ame-  
rican, in the navigation between our poris  
and British ports in Europe, by the cir-  
cuitous voyages enjoyed by one, and not  
enjoyed by the other.—The reasonable-  
ness of the rule of reciprocity, applied jo one  
braach of the commercial intercourse, has  
beer pressed on our part, as equally ap-  
plicable to both branches: but it is ascer-  
tained, that the British Cabinet declines  
all negociation on the subject, with a dis  
avowal, however, of any disposi&#x27;ion to  
view, in ah unfriendly light, whatever  
countervailing regulations the United  
States may oppose to the regulations of  
which they complain. The wisdom of the  
Legislature will decide on the course  
which, under these circumstances, is pre-  
scribed by a joint regard to the amicable  
relations betweep the two Nations, and to  
the just interests of the United States.

reign Powers.—An occurrence has indeed  
taken place in the Gulph of Mexico, which,  
if sanctioned by the Spanish Government,  
may make an exception as to that Power.  
—According to the report of our naval  
commander on that station, one of our  
public armed vessels was attacked by an  
over-powering force, under a Spanish  
commander, and the Americao flag, with  
the officers and crew, insulted in a manner  
calling for prompt reparation.—This has  
been demanded. In the mean time, a  
frigate and smaller vessel of war have been  
ordered into that Gulph, for the protection  
of our commerce, It would be improper  
to omit, that the Representative of his

that no hostile order could have emanated

of the finances :  
  
** In directing the legislative attention to  
the state of the finances, it is a subject of  
great gratification to find, that even within  
the short period which has elapsed since  
the return of peace, the revenue has far  
exceeded all the current demands upon  
the treasury, and that, under any proba-  
ble diminution +f its future annual pro-  
duct, which the vissicitudes of commerce  
may occasion, it will afford an ample fund  
for the effectual and early extinguishment  
of the public debt. It has been estimated,  
that during the year 1816, the actual re-  
ceipts of revenue at the treasury, includ-  
ing the balance at the commencement of the  
year, and excluding the proceeds of loans  
and treasury yotes, will amount to about  
the sum of 47 millions of dollars ; that dur-  
ing the same year the actual payments at  
the treasury, includiug the payment of the  
arrearages of the war department, as well  
as the payment of a considerable excess  
beyond the usual appropriation, will  
  
amount  
  
  
  
74  
  
amount to about the sum of 38 millions  
of dollars, and that consequently, at the  
close of the year, there will be a surplus  
in the Treasury of about the sum of nine  
mitlions of dollars.”  
  
{{u conclusion, the President alludes to  
the approaching close of his political la-  
bours; expresses his gratitude for the  
continued confidence ef his fellow citi-  
zens ; and felicitates himself on the hopes  
of being enabled, on his retirement, to  
leave his country in prosperity and peace. }  
  
From the report of the late Secretary  
to the Treasury it appears, that the re-

nrent of the publie debt. It has been estimated, that durtire the  
veor 1516, the actual receipts of revenue at the Treasury, in-  
cluding the balance at the commencement of the year, and ex-  
cluding the proceeds of loans and Treasury notes, will amount to  
shout the sum of 47 milliens of dollars; that during the same  
vear, the actual payments atthe Treasury, including the payment  
of the averages of the War Department, as well as the payment  
ot a comiderable excess beyond the aunual appropriation, will  
omount to about the sum of 38 millions of dollars; and that, con-  
ccauently, at the close of the year, there will be a surplus in the  
Vrensary of about the sum of nine millions of dollars.  
  
The Operations of the ‘Treasury continue to be obstructed by  
difficulties arising from the condition of the national currcucy 5  
but they have, nevertheless, been effectual, to abeneficial extent,  
in the reduetion of the public debt, aud the establishment of the  
public credit. The floatmg debt of Treasury notes, and tempo-  
rary loans, will soon be entirely discharged,  
the funded detyt, composed of the debts incurred during the wars  
of 1776 aud of 1812, has been estimated with reference to the Lst  
of Jawnary next, at a sam not exceeding EO millions of dollars.  
‘The ordinary annual expences of the Government, for the main-  
tenance of all its institutions, civil, military, and naval, have  
been estimated at a stm less than 20 millions of dollars. And the  
permanent reveane, to be derived from al! the existing sources,  
los been estimated at a sum of about 25 millions of dollars.  
  
{ pon thie general view of the subject, it is obvious that there  
is only wanting, to the fiscal prosperity of the Gevernment, the  
restoration of an uniform medium of exchange. ‘The resources  
wud the faith of she nation, displayed in the system which Con-  
cress has established, ensure respect and confidence both at home  
aud abroad, The local accumulations of the revenue have  
ulseody enabled the Treasury to meet the public engagements in  
the local curreney of most of the States; and it is expected that  
the same cause will produce the same effect throughout the  
Cwion, But, for the interests of the community at large, as well  
n= lor the parposes of the Treasury, it is essential that the nation  
shonld possess a currency of equal value, credit, and use,  
wherever it may circulate. The Constitution has entrusted Con-  
gress exclusively with the power of creating and regulating a cur-  
rency of that description; and the measures which were taken  
during the last Session, in execution of the power, give every  
promise of suecews. ‘The Bank ef the United States has been  
organized under auspices the most favourable, and cannot fail to  
be an important auxiliary to those measures,  
  
For a more enlatged view of the public finances, with a view  
of the measures pursued by the Treasury Department, previous  
to the resignation of the late Secretary, T transmit an extract from  
the lust report of that officer. Congress will perceive in it ample  
proofs of the solid f-undation on which the financial prosperity  
ef the nation rests; and will do justice to the distinguished  
ability and successful exertions with which the dutics of the de

FelfowCitixens of the Senate,  
And of the House of Representatives,  
In reviewing the present state of our country,  
our attention cannot be withheld from the ef­  
fect produced by peculiar seasons, which have  
very generally impaired the annual gifts of the  
earth, and threatened scarcity in particular dis­  
tricts. Such, however, is the variety of soils, of  
climates, and of products within our extensive  
limits, that the aggregate resources for sob­  
sistence are more than sufficient for the aggre­  
gate wants. And as far as an economy of con­  
sumption, more than usual, may l&gt;e necessary,  
our thankfulness is due to Providence, for what  
is far more than a compensation, in the re­  
markable health which has distinguished the  
present year.  
Amidst the advantages which have succeed­  
ed the peace of Europe, and that of the United  
States with Great-Britain, in a general invigo­  
ration of industry among us, and in the exten­  
sion of our commerce, the value of which is  
more and more disclosing itself to commercial  
nations, it is to be regretted that a depression  
is experienced by particular branches of our  
manufactures, and by a portion of our naviga­  
tion. As the first proceeds, in an essential de­  
gree, from an excess of imported merchandise,  
which carries a check in its own tendency, the  
caose, in its present extetot, cannot be of very  
long duration. The evil will not, however, b&lt;­  
viewed by Congress, without a recollection,  
that manufacturing establishments, if suffered  
to sink too low,&#x27; or languish too long, may not  
revive, after the causes shall have&#x27;ceased ; «nj  
that in the vicissitudes of hum-n affairs, titoa­  
tioris may recur, in which a dependence on fo­  
reign resources for indispensable supplies „,^y  
be among the most seiious embarrasments.  
The depressed state of our navigation is to be  
«scribe !, in a material degree, to its exclusion  
from the Colonial parts of the nation most ex­  
tensively connected wUh us in commerce, nnd  
from the indirect operation of that ea-chiaion.  
Previous to ihe late cnvention at London,  
between the United Stales and Great-Britain,  
the ; ?lative state, of the navigation laws of the  
two countries, growing out of the treaty of  
i&#x27; 94, had given to the British navigation a ma­  
teria] advantage over the American, in the in­  
tercourse b-lween the American port* and Bri­  
tish ports in Europe. The convention of Lon­  
don equalized the laws uf the two countries re­  
lating to these ports: leaving the intercourse  
between our ports and the ports of the British  
colonies subject, as before, to the respective  
regulations of the parue». The British govern­  
ment enforcing new regulations, which prohibit  
a trade between its colonies and the United  
States,-in American vessel?, whilst they permit  
a tiade in British vessels, the American navi­  
gation loies accordingly ; and the loss is aug­  
mented by the advantage which is given to the  
British competition over rhe American, in the  
navigation between our potts, and British porta  
in Europe, by the circuitous voyage, enjoyed  
hy the one, and not enjojed by Ihe other.  
The reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity,  
appiied to one-branch of the commercial inte.v  
course, has been pressed on our part, as equally  
applicable to both branches ; but it is ascer­  
tained, that the British cabinet declines all ne­  
gociation on the subject j with a disavowal,&#x27;  
however, of any disposition to vipw, in an un­  
friendly light, whatever countervailing regula­  
tions the United States may oppose to the re­  
gulations of which they coinplain. The wisdom  
of the Legisluf&#x27;.te will decide on the course,  
which, under th&gt;-se circumstance?, is prescribed  
by a joint regard to&#x27; the amicabie relations be­  
tween the two nations, and to the just interests&#x27;  
of tho United States.  
I Imve the satisfaction to state, generally, that  
we remain in amity with forejgi powers.  
An occurence h«s, indeed, taken pijcein the&#x27;  
Gulf of Mexico, which, if sanctioned by the  
Spanish government, may make an exception  
as to that pov?er. According to the report of  
our naval commander on that station, one of  
our public armed vessel* was attacked by aii  
overpowering force, under a Spanish comman­  
der, and the American flag, with the officers and  
crew, insulted, in a. manner .calling for prompt  
reparation. This has been demanded.—ln the  
mes&gt;n time, a frigate and smaller vessel of war  
have been ordered into that Gulf, for the pro­  
tection of our commerce. It would be improper  
to omit, that the representative of his Catholic  
majesty, in the United States, lost no time in  
giving the strongest assurances, that no hostile  
oider could have emanated from his govern­  
ment, and that it will be as ready to do, as to  
expert,, whatever the nature of the case, and !h»y  
friendly relations of the two countries, shall he  
fonnd to require.  
The posture of our affairs with Algims, at the  
present moment, is not known. The l)ey, driv­  
ing pretexts from circumstances, fur which the  
United States were not answ&lt; ral le, addressed a  
letter to this government, declaring the treaty,  
last concluded with him, to have b;en annulled  
by our violation of it; and presenting, as tiie al­  
ternative of war, or a renawal of the former  
ireaty, wbieb .stipulated, among otler things,  
en annual ttibn&#x27;.e. The answer, with an ex­  
plicit declaration that the. United States pre­  
ferred war to tribute, required &#x27;..is recognition  
gr.d observance of the treaty last made, which  
abolishes tribute, and the slavery of our cap­  
tured citizens. The result of the answer ha*  
not been received.— Should he renew his war­  
fare on our commerce, we iely on the protec­  
tion it will find ;n our naval force actually in  
the Mediterranean. §  
With the other Barbary States our affair  
have undergone no change.  
The Indian tribes within dor limits appear  
Biso disposed to remain at peace. From seve­  
ral of them purchases of lands have been made,  
particularly favourable to the wishes and secu­  
rity of our frontier settlements, as well as to  
the general interests of the nation. In some  
instances, the titles, though not supported by  
due proof, and clashing thoje of one tribe with  
the claims of another, have been extinguished  
by double purchases; the benevolent policy of  
the United States preferring the augmente

expenee to the haaard of doing injustice, or to  
the enforcement of justice against a feeble and  
untutored people, by means involving or threa­  
tening an effusion of blood lam happy to  
add, that the tranquillity which ha* been res­  
tored among the tribes themselves, as well as  
between them and our own population, will  
favour the resumption of the work of civiliza­  
tion, which had made an encouraging progress  
among some tribe?; and that the facility is  
increasing for extending that divided and indi­  
vidual ownership, which exists now in move  
able property only, to. the soil itself; and of  
thus establishing, in the culture and improve­  
ment of it, the tree foundation for a transit  
from the habits of the savage to the arts and  
comforts of social life.  
Asa subject of the highest importance to the  
national welfare, I must again earnestly recom­  
mend to the consideration of Cjngress a re-or­  
ganization of the Militia, on a plan which will  
form it into classes, according to the periods of  
life snore or less adapted to military services.  
An efficient müitia is authorised and contem­  
plated by the Constitution, and required by the  
spirit and safety of a free government. The  
present organization of our militia is universally  
regarded as less efficient than it ought to be  
made ; and no organization can be better cal­  
culated to give t.» it due force, than a classi­  
fication which will assign the foremost place in  
the.defence of the country, to that portion of  
its citizens, whose activity and animation best  
enable them to rally to its standard. Besides  
the consideration, that a time of peace is the  
time when the change can be made with most  
convenience and equity, it will now be aided by  
file experience of a recent war, in which the  
0 ilitia Km e so interesting a part.  
Congress will call to mind, that no adequate  
provision has yet been made for the uniformity  
of weights and measures, also contemplated by  
the Constitution. The great utility of a stan­  
dard, fixed in its nature, and founded on the  
easy rule of decimal proportions, is -sufficiently  
obvions.— It led the government, at an early  
stage, to preparator,* steps for introducing it ;  
and a completion of the work will be a just title  
to the pub&#x27;ic gratitude.  
The importance, which I have attached to  
the establishment of a university within this  
district, on a scale and for object» worthy of the  
American nation, induces me tn renew my re­  
rommendation of it to the favourable conside­  
ration of Congress ;&#x27;and I particularly invite  
•gain their attention to the expediency of ex­  
erting their etisting powers, and, where net.es­  
aary, of resorting to the prescribed mode of en­  
larging them in order to effectuate a compre­  
hensive system of roads and canals, such as will  
lave the effect of drawing more closely toge­  
ther every part of our country, by promoting  
intercourse and improvements, and by increas­  
ing the share of every part in the common stock,  
of national prosperity.  
Occurrences having taken place which shew  
that the statutmy provisions for the dispensa .  
tion of criminal justice, are deficient in relatlon  
both to places and to persons, under the exclu­  
sive cognizance of the national authority, an  
amendment of the law, embracing such c»*es,  
Will merit the earlie: t attention of the Legisla­  
ture. It will be a Seasonable occasion also for  
inquiring how far legislative interposition may  
be further requisite in providing penalties for  
offences designated in the constitution or in &lt;I,e  
Statutes, and to which either no penalties are  
annexed, or none with suticient certainty. And&quot;  
1 submit to the wisdom of Congress, whether a  
more enlarged revisal .of the criminal code be  
not expedient, for the pdrpose of mitigating, &#x27;&quot;  
certain cass, penalties which were adopted into  
it, antecedent to experiments and examples  
which justify and recommend a more lenient  
policy.  
The United States having been the first to  
«bolisb, within the extent of their authority, the  
transportation of the natives of Africa into  
slavery, by prohibiting the introduction of  
slaves, and by punishing their citizens partici­  
pating in the traffic, cannot but be gratified at  
the progress made by concurrent efforts of  
«ther nations, towards a general suppression of  
so great an evil. They must feel, at the same  
time, the greater solicitude to give the fullest  
efficacy to their own regulations. With that  
view the interposition of Congress appears to be  
required by the violations and evasions which,  
it is suggested, are chargeable on unworthy ci­  
tizens, «ho mingle in the Slave-Trade under  
loreign fl,gSi aild w,tn foreign ports ; and by  
&#x27;collusive importations of slaves into the United  
States, through adjoining ports and territories.  
1 present the subject to Congress, with a full  
•ssuranee of their disposition to apply all the  
remedy which can be afforded by an amend­  
ment of the law. The regulation» which were  
intended to guard against abases of a kindred  
character, in the trade between the several  
Sutes, ought also to be rendered more ettec­  
tual for their humane object.  
To these recommendations I add, for the con­  
si lerUion of Congress, the expediency .of a re­  
molification of the Judiciary establishment, and  
of an additional department in the Executive  
branch of the government.  
The first iscalled for by the accruing business  
which necessarily swells the duties of the Fe­  
deral Courts; and by the great and w.denmg  
space, within which justice is to be dispensed by  
them. The time seems to hive arrived, which  
claims for members of the Supreme Court a  
relief from itinerary fatigues, incompatible, as  
well with the age which a portion of them will  
always have attained, as with the researches  
and preparations which are due to their stations,  
and to thejuridical reputation of their country ;  
and considerations equally cogent require a  
more convenient «rgmization-of the subordi­  
nate tribunals, whiib may be accomplished  
without an objectionable increase of the num­  
ber or expenee of the Judges.  
The extent and variety of the Executive bu­  
siness, also accumulating with the progress of  
our country and its growing population, call f&gt;r  
an additional department, to be charged with  
duties now overburden;ng other departments,  
and with such as have not been annexed to any  
department.  
The course of experience recommends as an­  
other improvement in the Executive establish­  
ment, that the provision for the station of Attor­  
ney-General, whose residence at the seat of Go­  
vernment, official connections with it. and ma­  
nagement of the public business before the Ju­  
diciary, preclude an extensive participation in  
professional emoluments, be made more ade­  
quate to his service» and relinquishments; and  
.hat, with a view to his reasonable accommo­  
dation, a.d to a proper depository of bis official  
opinions and proceedings, there be included in  
the provisions the usual appurtenances to a pu­  
blic offi?e.  
In duet-ting the Legislative attention to the  
state of the finances, it is a subject of great gra­  
tification to find, that, even within the short pe­  
riod, *hich has elapted since the return of peace,  
the reve.nne has far exceeded all the current  
demands Upon the Treasury, anl that, under  
any ur.»bable diminution of its future annual  
product, which the vicissitudes of commerce  
may occasion, it will afford an ample fund for  
the effectual and early extinguishment of the  
public debt. It has been estimated, that during  
the year 1815, the actual receipts of revenue  
at the Tieasury, including the. balance at the  
commencenfent of the year, and excluding the  
proceeds of Loan» and Treasury Notes will  
amount to ab.iut lh« sum of forty-seven millions  
of dollars ; that during the same years the ac­  
tual payments, at the Treasury, including the  
payment of arrearage* of the War Department,  
as well as the payment of a considerable excess,  
beyond the annual appropriations, will amount  
to abo.it the sum of thirty-eight millions of dol­  
lars ; and that consequently, at the close of the  
year, there will be a surplus in the Treasury  
of ahnut the sum of nine millions of dollars.  
The operations of the treasury continue to be  
obstructed by difficulties, arising from the con­  
dition of the notional currency ; but they have,  
nevertheless, beer», effectual, to ar beneficial ex­  
tent, in the reduction of the public debt, and  
the establishment of the public credit. The  
floating debt of treasury notes and temporary  
loans will soon be. entirely discharged. The  
alienate of the funded debt, composed of  
debts incurred during the wars of 1776 and of  
1812, has been estimated, with reference to the  
first of January next, at a sum not exceeding  
one hundred and ten millions of dollars.—The  
ordinary annual expenccs of the government  
for the maintenance of all its institutions, civil,  
military, and naval, have been estimated at a  
sum less than twenty millions of dollars. And  
the permanent revenue, to be derived from all  
the existing sources, has been estimated at a  
sum of about twenty five millions of dollars.  
Upon this general view.of the subject, it is ob­  
vious, that there is only, wanting, to the fiscal  
prosperity of the government, the restoration  
of an uniform medium of exchange. The re­  
source» and the faith of the nation, displayed in  
the system which Congress has established, en­  
sure respect and confidence both at home and  
abroad. The local accumulations of the revenue  
have already enabled the treasury to meet the  
public engagements in the local currency of most  
of the State»; and it Is expected that the same  
cause will prodace the same effect throughout  
the Union. But, for the interests of the com­  
munity at large, a» well as for the purposes of  
the treasury, it is essential that the nation should  
possess a currency of equal value, credit, and use,  
wherever it may circulate. The constitution has  
entrusted Congress exclusively with the power  
of creating and ragulating a currency of that  
description ; and the measures which were ta­  
ken during the last session, in execution of the  
powet, give every promise of success. The bank  
of the United Stales has been organized under  
auspices the mostxfavourable, and cannot fail to  
be an important auxiliary to those mea«ures.  
For a more .enlarged view of the public fi­  
nances, with a view of the measures pursued by  
the treasury department, previous to the resig­  
nation of the late Secretary, I transmit an ex­  
tract from the last report of that officer. Con­  
gress will perceive in it ample groofs of the  
solid foundation on which the financial prospe­  
rity of the nation rests; and will do justice to  
the distinguished ability and successful exer­  
tions with which the duties ef the department  
were executed, during a period remarkable for  
its difficulties and its peculiar perplexities.  
The period of my retiring from the public  
service being afr little distance, I shall find no  
occasion more proper than the present for ex­  
pressing to my fellow citisens spy deep sense of  
the continued confidence and kind support  
which I have received from them. My grate­  
ful recollection of these distinguished marks of  
their favourable regard can never cease ; and,  
with the consciousness, that if I have not served  
my country with greater ability, I have served  
it with a sincere devotion, will accompacy me  
as 4 source of n-&#x27;failing gratifications.  
Happily I shall carry with me from the pub­  
lic theatre other sources, which those, who love  
their country most,w»ill best appreciate. 1 shall  
behold it blessed with tranqu llity and prospe­  
rity at home ; and with peace and respect a­  
broad. I can indulge the proud reflection, that  
the American people have reached in safety  
and success their fortieth year as an Indepen­  
dent Nation ; that, for nearly an entire genera­  
tion, they have had experience of their present  
Constitution, the offspring of their nndi-turb«d  
deliberations and of their free-choic» ; that they  
have found i; to bear the trials of adverse at .  
well as prosperou* circum-itances, to contain  
in its combination of the federate and elective  
principles a reconcilement of public strength  
with individual liberty, of national power for  
the defence&#x27;of national rights, with a security  
against wars of injustice, of ambition, or of vam  
gloiy, in the fundamental provision which sub­  
jects all question» of war to the will of the na­  
tion itself, which i» to pay it» costs and feel it»  
c lumities. Nor is it less a peculiar felicity nf  
&#x27;this Con-titut on, so dear to as all, that it is  
found to be capable, without losing jts vital  
energies, of expanding itself over a spacious ter­  
ritory, with the increase and expansion of the  
community for whose benefit it was esttblished.  
And may I not be allowed to add ta this gra­  
tifying sped, le, that I shall read in the cha­  
racter of the American people, in their devo­  
tion to true liberty, and to the Constitution  
which is it» palladium, sore presage», that the  
destined career of my country will exhibit a  
government pursuing the public good as its sole  
object, and regulating its means by the great  
principles consecrated in its charter, and by  
those moral principles to which they are to well  
allied: A government which watches over the  
purity of elections, the freedom of speech and  
of the press, the trial by Jury, and the equal in­  
terdict against encroachments and compact!  
between_ religion and the State, which main­  
tains inviolably the maxims of public faithi the  
security of persons and property, and encou­  
rages in every authorized mode that general  
diffusion of knowledge, which guarantees to  
public liberty its permanency, and to those who  
posse.BB the blessing the true enjoyment of it ;  
a government which avoids intrusions on tha  
internal repose of other nations, and repel»  
them from its own ; which does justice to all na­  
tions vvith a readiness equal to the firmness  
with which it requires justice from them ; and  
which, whilst it refines its domestic code from  
every ingredient not congenial with the precepts  
of at» enlightened age, and the sentiments of a  
virtu01&quot;, people, seeks, by appeals to reason,  
and hy ,tJ liberal examples, to infuse into the  
law, which governs the civilized world, a spirit  
which may diminish the frequency, or circum­  
scribe tne calamities, of war, and meliorate the  
soci»1 &#x27;nd .Der&gt;eficent relations of peace; a go­  
vernment, in a word, whose conduct, within and  
without, may bespeak the most noble of all  
ambit&gt;ons&gt; that of promoting peace on earth,  
and gu°d Wl&quot; to man.  
These contemplations, sweetening the rem­  
nant of my days, will animate my prayers for  
the happiness of my beloved country, and a per­  
petuity of the institutions under which it i» en­  
joyed- James Madison.

3, 1816.  
Amidst the advantages which have succeeded  
the peace of Europe, and that of the United States  
witliGreat Britain, in a general invigoration of in­  
dustry among u«, and in the extension of our com­  
merce, the value of which is more and more dis­  
closing itself to commercial nations, it i* to be re­  
gretted that a depression is experienced by partic­  
ular branches of our manufactures, and by a por­  
tion of our navigation. As the first proceeds, in  
an essential degree, from an excess of imported  
merchandise, which carries a check in its own ten­  
dency, the cause, initspreaent extent,cannot beof  
very long duration. The evil will not, however,  
be viewed by Longre-s, without a recollection,  
that manufacturing establishments, if suffered to  
sink too low*, or languish too long, may not revive,  
after the causes shall have ceased ; and that, in the  
vicissitudes of human affairs, situations may recur,  
in which a dependence on foreign sources, for in­  
dispensable supplies, may be among the most seri­  
ous embarrassments.

‘* The depressed state of our navigation,is to be ascribed, in a material degree,  
to its exclusion from the colonial ports of. the nation most extensively connected  
with us in commerce, and from the indirect operation of that exclusion.  
  
‘** Previous to the late convention at London, between the United States and  
Great Britain, the relative state of the navigation laws of the two countries,  
growing out of the treaty of 1794, had given to the British navigation a material  
udvantage over the American, in the intercourse between the American ports  
and British ports in Europe. The convention of London equalized the laws of  
the two countries relating to those ports; leaving the intercourse between our  
ports and the ports of the British colonies, subject, as before, to the respective  
regulations of the parties. The British government enforcing now, regulations  
which prohibit a trade between its colonies and the United States, in American  
vessels, whilst they permit a trade in British vessels, the American navigation  
loses accordingly ; and the loss is augmented, by the advantage which is given to  
the British competition over the American, in the navigation between our ports

“The period of my retiring from the public ser-  
vice being at little distance, I shall find no occasion  
g to my  
fellow citizens my deep sense of the continued con-  
  
support which I have received  
grateful recollections of these dis-  
tinguished marks of their favorable regard can  
never cease; and, with the consciousness that, if I  
greater ability, I

with me from the public  
theatre other sources, which those who love their  
I shall behold  
it blessed with tranquillity and prosperity at home,  
and with peace and respect abroad. I can indulge  
the proud reflection that the American people have  
reached, in safety and success, their fortieth year as  
an independent nation; that, for nearly an entire  
generation, they have had experience of their pre-  
sent constitution, the offspring of their undisturbed  
deliberations, and of their free choice; that they  
have found it to bear the trials of adverse as well  
as prosperous circumstances—to contain, in its  
combination of the federate and elective principles,  
a reconcilement of public strength with individual  
liberty, of national power for the defence of nation-  
  
of ambition, and of vain glory, in the fundamental  
provision which subjects all questions of war to the  
  
eculiar fe-  
licity of this constitution, so dear to us all, that it is  
found to be capable, without losing its vital ener-  
  
with the increase and expansion of the community  
  
«And, may I not be allowed to add to this grati-  
lying spectacle, that I shall read in the character of  
the American people, in their devotion to true li-  
berty, and to the constitution which is its palla-  
dium, sure wresages that the destined career of my  
country will exhibit a government pursuing the  
gr as its sole object, and regulating its  
  
y the great principles consecrated in its  
charter, and by those moral principles to which  
they are so well allied: a government which watches  
over the purity of elections; the freedom of speech  
and of the press, the trial by jury, and the equal  
interdict against encroachments and compacts be-  
tween religion and the state; which maintains in-  
  
persons and property, and encourages, in every au-  
thorised mode, that general diffusion of knowledge  
  
and to those who possess the blessing the true en-  
joyment of it: a government which avoids intru-  
sion on the internal repose of other nations, and re-  
nations with a readiness equal to the firmness with  
  
whilst it refines its domestic code from every in-  
  
en  
ee  
  
redient not congenial with the precepts of an en.  
ightened age, and the sentiments of a virtuous  
wary seeks, by appeals to reason, and by its  
iberal examples, to infuse into the law which go-  
verns the civilized world a spirit which may dimi-  
nish the frequency, or circumscribe the calamities,  
of war, and meliorate the social and beneficent re.  
lations of peace: a government, in a word, whose  
conduct, within and without, may bespeak the  
most noble of all ambitions—that of promoting  
peace on earth, and good-will to man.  
  
‘These contemplations, sweetening the remnant  
of my days, will animate my prayers for the hap-  
piness of my beloved country, and a perpetuity of  
the institutions under which it is enjoyed.”

iCUpon this general view of the subject, it is  
obvious that there is only wanting to the fiscal  
prosperity of the government the restoration of a  
uniform medium of exchange. The resource and  
faitli of the nation, displayed in the system which  
Congress has established, insure respect and con­  
fidence at home and abroad. The local accumu­  
lations of the revenue have already enabled the  
treasury to meet the public engagements in the  
local currency of inost of the states; and it is  
expected that the same cause will produce the  
same effect throughout the Union. But for the  
interests of the community at large, as well as  
for the purpose? of the treasury, it is essential  
that the nation should possess a currency of equal

sage to Congress, exhibits, in a condensed form, our relations with Great  
Britain. “The depressed state of our navigation,” he remarks, “is to be  
ascribed, in a material degree, to its exclusion from the colonial ports of  
the nation most extensively connected with us in commerce, and from the  
indirect operation of that exclusion. Previous to the late convention at  
London, between the United States and Great Britain, the relative state  
of the navigation laws of the two countries, growing out of the treaty of  
1794, had given to the British navigation a material advantage over the  
American, in the intercourse between the American ports and British  
ports in Europe. The convention of London equalized the laws of the  
two countries, relating to those ports; leaving the intercourse between  
our ports and the ports of the British colonies subject, as before, to the  
respective regulations of the parties. The British government, enforcing  
now regulations which prohibit a trade between its colonies and the  
United States in American vessels, whilst they permit a trade in British  
vessels, the American navigation loses accordingly ; and the loss is aug-  
mented by the advantage which is given to the British competition over  
the American, in the navigation between our ports and British ports in  
Europe, by the circuitous voyages enjoyed by the one, and not enjoyed by  
the other.”

nounced the fact in his message in 1816 in the following terms :  
**The operations of the treasury continue to be obstructed by  
difficulties arising from the condition of the national currency,  
but they have, nevertheless, been effectual to a beneficial extent  
in the reductien of the public debt and the establishment of the  
public credit. The aggregate of the funded debt, composed of  
debts incurred during the wars of 1776 and 1812, has been  
estimated with reference to the Ist of January next (1817) at  
asum not exceeding one hundred and ten millions of dollars.  
The ordinary annual expenses of the Government for the main-  
tenance of all its institutions, civil, military, and naval, have  
been estimated at a sum less than twenty millions of dollars ;  
and the permanent revenue to be derived from all the existing  
sources has been estimated at a sum of about twenty millions of  
dollars. Upon this general view of the subject, it is obvious  
that there is only wanting to the fiscal prosperity of the Govern-  
ment the restoration of a uniform medium of exchange. ‘  
For the interests of the community at large, as well as  
for the purposes of the treasury, it is essential that the nation  
should possess a currency of equal value, credit, and use wherever  
it may circulate. The constitution has entrusted Congress  
exclusively with the power of creating and regulating a currency  
of that description ; and the measures taken during the last  
session, in execution of the power, give every promise of success.  
The Bank of the United States has been organised under aus-  
pices the most favourable, and cannot fail to be an important  
auxiliary to those measures.’’
