ce, and increased expense thereby occasioned, which military subordination might seem not to permit them to refuse, shall be denied.  
To recur back to the constitution of the Department of War. By an “act to establish an Executive Department, to be denominated the Department of War” passed the 7th of Augt. 1789, it is provided by the first section thereof—“That there shall be an Executive Department , to be denominated the Department of War; and that there shall be a principal officer therein, to be called the Secretary for the Department of War, who shall perform and execute such duties, as shall from time to time be enjoined on, or entrusted to him, by the President of the United States, agreeably to the Constitution, relative to military commissions, or to the land or naval forces, ships, or warlike stores of the United States, or to such other matters, respecting military or naval affairs, as the President of the United States, shall assign to the said Department, or relative to the granting of lands to persons entitled thereto, for military services rendered to the United States, or relative to Indian affairs: and furthermore that the said principal officer, shall conduct the business of the said Department in such manner, as the President of the United States shall from time to time order or instruct”.  
The Department of War, by this act, is made one of the great executive members of the government, and the Secretary or Chief officer thereof, is made the organ of the Supreme Magistrate, or President, as to all matters relative to the army, or the military, and it is from the Chief Magistrate, that all the acts of the Secretary are presumed to emanate,—for he is expressly subjected to the orders and instructions of the President.  
“An act making alterations in the Treasury and war Departments” passed the 8th of May 1792, provides,—“That there be an Accountant to the Department of War who shall be charged with the settlement of all accounts, relative to the pay of the army, the subsistence of officers, bounties to soldiers, the expences of the recruiting service, the incidental and contingent expences of the Department, and who shall report from time to time, all such settlements, as shall have been made by him, for the inspection and revision of the accounting offices of the Treasury; and the said accountant, shall also be charged, with the settlement of all claims for personal service authorized by the act of this Congress of the 27th of March last, and of all military claims, lodged in the late office of the Pay Master General, and commissioner of army accounts, which are not foreclosed by the acts of limitation of the late Congress, and he shall report from time to time all such settlements as have been made by him, for the inspection and revision of the Treasury”

Besides those laws, the act creating the Executive De­

enjoin on or entrust to the Secretary of War such duties,

missions or to the land or naval forces, ships or warlike

Now, under this gene al authority, it is perfectly clear  
that the President cannot, by general instructions, en-­  
trust the Secretary of War with the power to issue mili.­

The Secretary of the War Department is the repre-  
sentative of the President as Commander-in-chief of  
the Army and Navy under the Constitution. He isa  
civil minister, and made by law “ the Secretary for the  
War Department.” That is his title, as created by the  
act of Congress approved August 7, 1789. That law  
does not functionize him in person with military com-  
mand or authority of any kind over the Army. It  
makes him the minister of the President, to perform  
ministerial duties only. These are the words of the  
law—“ He shail perform and execute such duties as  
shall from time to time be enjoined on, or entrusted to  
him by the President of the United States, agreeably to  
the Constitution, relative to military commissions, or  
to the land and naval forces, ships or warlike stores of  
the United States, or to such other matters respecting  
military or naval affairs as the President of the United  
States shall assign te the said department, or relative  
to the granting of lands for military services rendered  
to the United States, or relative to Indian affairs; and  
furthermore, that the said principal officer (the Secre-  
tary) shall conduct the business of the said department  
in such manner:as the President of the United States  
shall from time to time order or instruct.” So much  
of this law as gives the Secretary of War the direction  
of naval aflairs was repealed by act of Congress ap-  
proved April 30, 1798, creating the independent Navy  
department. Section 5 of “ act for better organization  
of the general staft of the Army,” approved March 3,

ume of increase in the business and the wonderful change of  
values.  
  
The new government, under the constitution, went into op-  
eration practically on the 30th of April, 1789, when Washing-  
ton was inaugurated at the old City Hall in New York as the  
first President of the United States, and became the “‘com-  
mander-in-chief of the army and navy.” The first act of Con-  
gress relating to military affairs, to be approved by him, was  
the act of August 7, 1789, which directed ‘that there shall be  
an executive department, to be denominated the Department  
of War; and that there shall bea principal officer therein to be  
called the Secretary for the Department of War.’ This officer  
was to perform such duties as the President should direct  
relating to military commissions, land or naval forces, ships,  
or warlike stores, or Indian affairs, or the granting of bounty  
lands, or “such other matters respecting military or naval  
affairs as the President of the United States shall assign to  
said department.” He was also authorized to appoint a chief  
clerk, who in the event of the removal of the Secretary, or the  
occurrence of a vacancy, should have charge of the records,  
books, and papers of the department (naval affairs, public  
lands, Indian affairs, and pensions were afterward transferred  
to other departments).  
  
The title of ‘‘Secretary of War’ appears to have been  
adopted as a matter of choice by the first Secretary appointed  
by Washington, the only change from the old title, it will be  
noticed, being the use of the preposition of for a/, a change

THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.  
  
THE Department of State ranks first among the  
Executive Departments. It was established by act  
of Congress approved July 27, 1789 (the fourth  
measure to go upon the Federal statute-books), as  
‘“¢The Department of Foreign Affairs”; and the  
functions of its principal officer, styled ‘*‘ The Sec-  
retary for the Department of Foreign Affairs,” as  
briefly defined by the act, related exclusively to  
matters of an international character. He was  
empowered to “‘ perform and execute such duties  
as shall from time to time be enjoined on or in-  
trusted to him by the President of the United  
States, agreeable to the Constitution, relative to  
correspondences, commissions or instructions to or

States, or to negotiations with public ministers from  
foreign states or princes, or to memorials or other  
applications from foreign public ministers or other  
foreigners, or to such other matters respecting for-  
eign affairs as the President of the United States  
shall assign to the said department”; he was  
charged with the custody and care of the records,  
books, and papers in the office of a somewhat  
similar functionary under the Confederation ; *  
and was required to ‘‘ conduct the business of the  
said department in such manner as the President  
of the United States shall from time to time order  
or instruct.” By the act of September 15, 1789,  
the name of the Department was changed to ‘‘ The  
Department of State,” the title of its principal of-  
ficer was shortened to *‘ The Secretary of State,”  
and additional duties were assigned to him of a  
nature wholly distinct from those previously im-

It is contended, however, that, in this instance, the final  
custody of the money was vested by the act of June 18, 1878,  
solely in the Secretary of State, and that it was thereby made  
his duty to distribute andgpay the awards to the claimants  
independently of the direction or control of the President.  
But the act thus referred to as the basis of this application,  
when considered throughout as it must be, not only does not

where the active control of foreign rela­  
tions shall be lodged, it seems to have  
Intended that it should be with the exec­  
utive branch of the government. The  
first Congress under the Constitution, in  
July, 1789, passed an act creating the De­  
partment of State and the office of Sec­  
retary of State. This laws says:  
The Secretary of State shall perform such  
duties as shall from time to time be en­  
Joined on or Intrusted to him by the Presi­  
dent relative to correspondence, commis­  
sions, or instructions to or wltli public min­

to negotiate with public ministers from for­  
eign states or princes, cr to memorials or  
other applications from foreign public min­  
isters or other- foreigner?, or to such other  
matters respecting foreign affairs as the  
President of the United States shall assign  
to the department, and he shall conduot the  
business of the department in such manner  
as the President shall direct.  
The evident intent of this was to place  
the active control of foreign affairs In  
the hands of the President and Secretary  
of State. This harmonizes with the Con

there had been none. The larger duties of the  
  
Secretary of War are not very particularly  
  
described in the statutes. The law reads: He  
  
“shall perform such duties as shall from time to time be  
  
enjoined on or entrusted to him by the President relative  
  
to military commissions, the military forces, the warlike  
stores of the United States, or to other matters respecting  
military affairs ; and he shall conduct the business of the  
department in such manner as the President shall direct.”  
  
The law defining the duties of the Secretary of the Navy  
runs much in the same terms. The thought of the law-  
makers seems to have been that as these departments  
had to do with the organization, equipment and subsist-  
ence of the land and naval forces of the United States,  
and the movement of troops and ships, and as the  
  
President is by the Constitution the Commander-in-Chief  
  
of such forces, the action of the heads of these depart-  
  
ments must proceed theoretically, at least, upon the

This is very explicit in making the sec­

are equally explicit. The framers of the

ating the State Department, passed in 1789,  
at the first session of Congress after the  
adoption of the Constitution, says;  
The secretary of state shall perform such  
duties as shall from time to time bo en­

matters respecting foreign affairs as the  
President of the United States shall assign  
to the department, and he shall conduct the  
business of the department in such manner  
as the President shall direct.  
This clearly* indicates a purpose to place  
the conduct of foreign affairs and all mat­  
ters of diplomacy in the hands of the sec­  
retary of state, subject to the President.
