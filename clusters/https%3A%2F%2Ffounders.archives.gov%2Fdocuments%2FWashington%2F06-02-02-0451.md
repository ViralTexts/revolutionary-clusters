Your favour of the 13th Ulto with the accounts, came duly to hand; and I thank you for the trouble you have had in paying and taking receipts therefor. The small balance of £1.3.5½ may, if you please, be given to Mr Custis.  
It was my intention to have written fully to you by the return of this young Gentleman to College, but the debilitated state into which I have been thrown by a fever, with which I was siezed on the 18th &amp; could procure no remission of until the 25th past, renders writing equally irksome &amp; improper.  
Were the case otherwise, I should, I confess, be at a loss to point out any precise course of study for Mr Custis. My views with respect to him, have already been made known to you, &amp; therefore it is not necessary to repeat them on this occasion; but it is not merely, what the best course is, for him to pursue, that requires consideration; but such an one as he can be induced to pursue; &amp; will contribute to his improvement, and the object in view. In directing the first, to these objects, a Gentleman of your literature, discernment &amp; knowledge of the world, would be at no loss, without any suggestions of mine, if there was as good a disposition to receive, as there are talents to acquire knowledge: but as there seems to be in this youth an unconquerable indolance of temper; a dereliction in fact to all study, it must rest with you to lead him, in the best manner, and by the easiest modes you can devise, to the study of such useful acquirements as may be serviceable to himself, and eventually, beneficial to his Country, hereafter.  
French, from having become in a manner the universal language, I wished him to be Master of; but I do not find, from enquiry, that he has made much progress in the study of it. Some of the practical branches of Mathematics, particularly Surveying—he ought, possessing a good deal of landed property, to be well acquainted with, as he may have frequent occasions for the exercise of that Art.  
I have already exceeded the limits I had prescribed to myself when I began this letter, but I will trespass yet a little more, while I earnestly entreat that you will examine him, as often as you can make it convenient, yourself; and admonish him seriously of his omissions &amp; defects; and prevent as much as it can be done without  
  
too rigid a restraint, a devotion of his time to visitations of the families in Annapolis; which, when carried to excess—or beyond a certain point, can not fail to unhing his mind from study, &amp; turn his thoughts to very different objects. Above all, let me request, if you should perceive any appearance of his attaching himself, by visits or otherwise, to any young lady of that place, that you would admonish him against the measure on account of his youth, and incapability of appreciating all the requisites for a connection, which in the common course of things, can terminate with the death of one of the parties only; and, if it is done without effect, to advise me thereof.  
If in his reading he was to make common place notes, as is usual; copy them fair &amp; shew them to you—two good purposes would be answered by it: 1. you would see with what judgment they were done; and 2. it might be a mean to improve his hand writing, which requires nothing but care &amp; attention to render it good.

Mount Vernon, 2d. Sep. 1798.  
  
S1r,—Your favour of the 13th ult® with the ac-  
counts came duly to hand, and I thank you for the  
trouble you have had in paying and taking receipts  
therefor. The small balance of 1/, 2s. 53d. may, if  
you please, be given to Mr. Custis.  
  
It was my intention to have written fully to  
hee by the return of this young Gentleman to Col-  
  
ege, but the debilitated state into which I have  
been thrown by a fever, with which I was seized on  
the 18th and could procure no remission of until  
the 25th past, rendered writing equally irksome and  
improper. Were the case otherwise I should, I  
confess, be at a loss to point out any precise course  
of study for Mr. Custis for Mr. Custis [sto]. My  
views with respect to him have already been made  
known to you, and therefore it is not necessary to  
repeat them on this occasion ;—but it is not merely  
what the best course is, for him to pursue, that re-  
quires consideration, but such an one as he can be  
induced to pursue, and will contribute to his im-  
provement, and the objects in view. In directing  
  
the first, to the subjects, a gentleman of your litera-  
ture, discernment, and knowledge of the world,  
would be at no loss, without any suggestion of  
mine, if there was as good a disposition to receive  
as there are talents to acquire knowledge ; but as  
  
  
  
there seems to be in this youth an unconquerable  
indolence of temper, a disinclination in fact to all  
study, it must rest with you to /ead him in the best  
manner, and by the easiest modes you can devise,  
to the study of such useful acquirements as may be  
serviceable to himself and, eventually, beneficial to  
his country hereafter.  
  
French, from having become in a manner the  
universal language, I wished him to be master of,  
but Ido not find from enquiry that he has made  
much progress in the study of it. Some of the  
practical branches of mathematics, particularly sur-  
veying, he ought, possessing a good deal of landed  
property, to be well acquainted with, as he may  
have a frequent occasion for the exercise of that  
art.  
  
I have already exceeded the limits I had _pre-  
scribed to myself when I began this letter, but I  
will trespass yet a little more while I entreat that  
you will examine him, as often as you can make it  
convenient, yourself, and admonish him seriously  
of his omissions and defects ; and prevent, as much  
as it can be done without too rigid a restraint, a  
devotion of his time to visitations of the families  
in Annapolis :—which, when carried to excess or  
beyond a certain point, cannot fail to take his mind  
  
_from study, and turn his thoughts to very different  
  
objects. Above all, let me request, if you should  
perceive any appearance of his attaching himself,  
by visits or otherwise, to any young lady of that  
place, that you would admonish him against the  
measure on account of his youth ard incapability  
of appreciating all the requisites for a connection  
which, in the common course of things, can ter-  
minate with the death of one of the parties only ;  
and if it is done without effect, to advise me thereof.  
If in his reading he was to make commonplace  
notes, as is usual ; copy them fair and show them te  
you, two good purposes would be answered by it—  
1. you would see with what judgment they were  
done ; and 2. it might be a means to improve his  
handwriting, which requires nothing but care and  
attention to render it good. At present all of his  
writirg that I have seen is a hurried scribble, as if  
to get to the end speedily was the sole object of  
writing. With very great esteem and regard,

MotNT VEnRo_, 2d Sep., 1798.  
SIR: Your favor of the 13th ulto  
with the accounts came duly to hand,  
and I thank you for the trouble you  
have had in paying and taking receipts  
therefor. The balance 1f. 2s. 5.id. may,  
if you please, be given to Mr. Custis.  
It was my intention to have written  
fully to you by the return of th.is young  
Gentleman to College, but the debili­  
tated state into which I have been  
throwvn by a fever, with which I was  
seized on the 18th, and could produce  
no remission of until the 25th past,  
rendered writing equally irksome and  
improper. Were the case otherwise I  
should, I confess, be at a loss to point  
out any precise course of study for Mr.  
Custis for Mr. Custis [sic.] My viewvs  
with regard to him have already been  
made known to you, and therefore it is  
not necessary to repeat them on this  
occasion;-but it is not merely what  
the best course is, for him to pur­  
sue, that require consideration, but  
such an one as he can be induced to  
pursue, and will contribute to his im­  
p)rovement, and the objects in view.  
In directing the first, to the subjects, a  
gentleman of your literature, discern­  
ent, and knowledge of the world,  
would be at no loss, without any sug­  
gestion, if there was as good a disposi­  
tion to receive as there are talents to ac­  
quire knowledge: but as there seems to  
be in this youth an unconquerable in­  
dolence of temper, a disinclination in  
fact to all study, it must rest with you  
to ad him in the best manner, and by  
the easiest modes you can devise, to the  
study of such useful acquirements as  
may be serviceable to himself and,  
eventually, beneficial to his country  
hereafter.  
French, from having become in a  
manner the universal language, I  
wished him to be master of, but I do  
not find fromenquiry that he has made  
much progress in the study of it. Some  
of the practical branches of mathe­  
matics, particularly surveying, he  
ougt, possessing a good deal of landed  
property, to be well acquainted with,  
as he umay have a frequent occasion for  
the exereise of that art.  
I have already exceeded the limits I  
had prescribed to myself when I began  
this letter, but I will trespass yet a lit­  
tle more while I entreat that you will  
examine him, as often as you can make  
it convenient, yourself, and admonish  
him seriously of his omission and de­  
fects; and prevent, as much as it can  
be done without too rigid a restraint, a  
devotion o,f his time to visitations of  
the families in Annapolis, which when  
arred to excess or beyond a certain  
poi~t, cannot fail to take his mind from  
st(y, and turn his thoughts to very  
dif Trent objecs. Above all, let me re­  
quest, if you should perceive any ap­  
p~earance of hi~s attaching himself, by  
visits or otherwise, to any younig lady  
of that place, that you would admionish  
him against the measure on account of  
is outh and incapability of appreciat­  
ing all the requisites for a conniection  
which, in the common course of things,  
an terminiate with the death o,f one  
of the parties only; and if it is done  
without eIlect, to advise me thereof.  
If in his reading he was to make  
commonplace notes, as is usual; copy  
them fair and show them to you, two  
good purposes would be answered by it  
-1, you would see with what judgmelnt  
e were doene: and :? it might be a  
reans to improve his handwriting,  
which requires nothing but care and  
attention to render it good. At present  
all of his writing that I have seen is a

speedily was the sole object of writing.

MNoUT , 2d Sep., 1~9S.  
Si: Your favor of the 13th ulto  
vith the accounts came duly to hand,  
.nd I thank you for the trouble you  
tave had in paying and taking receipts  
herefor. T&#x27;he balance 1i. 2. 3. 5d. may,  
you please, be given to MIr. Custis.  
It was my intention to have written  
ully to you by the return of this young  
entleman to College, but the debili­  
ated state into which I have been  
rown by a fever, with which I was  
ized on the ISth, and could produce  
o remission of until the 25th past,  
endered writing equally irksome and  
rnproper. Were the case otherwvise I  
bould, I confess, be a: a loss to point  
ut any precise course of study for 3Mr.  
ustis for MIr. Custis [sic.] M1y views  
,ith regard to him have already been  
tade known to you, and therefore it is  
ot necessary to repeat them on this  
ccasion;-but it is not mnerely what  
be best course is, for him to pur­  
te, that require consideration, but  
uch an one as he can be induced to  
ursue, el1 will contribute to his im­  
rovemet, and the objects- in view.  
directing the first, to the subjects, a  
entlenan of your literature, discern­  
ient, and knowledge of the world,  
could be at no loss, withou: any sug­  
estion, if there was~ as good a disposi­  
Lon to receive as there are talents to nc­  
ire knowledge: but as there seems to  
e in this youth an unconauerable in­  
olence of temper, a disinclination in  
act to all study, it must res&#x27;. with you  
&gt; lead him in the best manner, and by  
Le easiest mi les you can devise, to the  
tudy of such useful acquirements as  
my be serviceable to himnself and,  
ventually, beneficial to his country  
ereafter.  
French, fromi having become in a  
auner the universal language, I  
ished him to be master of, but I do  
ot find from enquiry that he has made  
iuch progress in the study of it. Some  
f the practical branches of mathe­  
1atics, particularly surveying, he  
ught, possessing a good deail of landed  
roperty, to be well acquainted with,  
she may have a frequent occasion for  
te exercise of that art.  
I have already exceeded tihe limits I  
ad prescribed to myself when I began  
als letter, but I will trespass yet a lit­  
e more while I entreat that you will  
amine hinm, a often as you can make  
convenient, yourself, and admonish  
m seriously of his omission and de­  
eets; and prevent, as muca:es it can  
Sdone vithout too rigid a restraint, a  
evotion of his time to visitations of  
e families in Anntapolis, w hich when  
Lrried to excess or beyond a certain  
intt, cannot fail to take his mind fronm  
dy, and turn his thougits to very  
Ke~rent objects. A bove all, let me re­  
test, if ou should perceive any ap­  
raie of l&#x27;is attaching himself, by  
sits r otherwise, to any youn g lady  
that place, that you wvould admoniish  
mn against the measure on account of  
v outht and incapability of appreciat­  
g all thle requisites for a conne!ct ion  
ici, in the comnmoni course of things,  
n terminate with the death of one  
the parties only; and if it is done  
ith~out el&#x27;eet, to advise mie thereof.  
f ii his readiing he was to make  
mminonplace notes, ats is usual; copy  
e fair and show them to you, two  
od purpses would be answered by it  
1, yo&#x27;u would see with wvhat judgmnent  
ev were done: and 2, it might be a  
eanus to improve his hani&#x27;iting,  
iih requires nothing but care and  
Lt&#x27;ntion t) render it good. A t piresenit  
. of his writing that I have seent is a  
trried scribble, as if to get to the end(  
Leediiv was the sole objec(&#x27;(t of writing.  
itl very great esteemi and( regard,  
I am. Sir,  
Your Obedt H ble Servt  
Go WVashinigtoni.
