[New York, December 29, 1801]  
  
In the rage for change, or under the stimulus of a deep-rooted animosity against the former administrations, or for the sake of gaining popular favor by a profuse display of extraordinary zeal for economy, even our judiciary system has not passed unassailed. The attack here is not so open as that on the revenue; but when we are told that the states individually have “principal care of our persons, our property and our reputation; constituting the great field of human concerns; and that therefore we may well doubt whether our organization is not too complicated, too expensive; whether offices and officers have not been multiplied unnecessarily and sometimes injuriously to the service they were meant to promote;” when afterwards it is observed that “the Judiciary System will of course present itself to the contemplation of Congress;” and when it appears that pains had been taken to form and communicate a numerical list of all the causes decided since the first establishment of the courts, in order that Congress may be able to judge of the proportion which the institution bears to the business; with all these indications it is not to be misunderstood that the intention was unequivocally to recommend material alterations in the system.  
No bad thermometer of the capacity of our Chief Magistrate for government is furnished by the rule which he offers for judging of the utility of the Federal Courts; namely, the exact number of causes which have been by them decided. There is hardly any stronger symptom of a pigmy mind, than a propensity to allow greater weight to secondary than to primary considerations.  
It ought at least to have been adverted to, that if this circumstance were a perfect criterion, it is yet too early to apply it, especially to the courts recently erected: And it might have merited reflection, that it would have been prudent to wait for a more advanced period of the Presidential term, to ascertain what influence the great change which has lately happened in our public functionaries may have on the confidence, which in many parts of the Union has heretofore been reposed in the State courts, so as to prevent a preference of those of the United States.  
But to enable us duly to appreciate the wisdom of the projected innovation, it is necessary to review the objects which were designed to be accomplished by the arrangement of the Judiciary power as it is seen in the constitution and to examine the organization which has been adopted to give effect to those objects.  
It is well known to all who were acquainted with the situation of our public affairs when the constitution was framed, and it is to be inferred from the provisions of the instrument itself, that the objects contemplated, were, 1st. To provide a faithful and efficient organ for carrying into execution the laws of the United States, which otherwise would be a dead letter. 2d. To secure the fair interpretation and execution of our treaties with foreign nations. 3d. To maintain harmony between the individual states; not only by an independent and impartial mode of determining controversies between them, but by frustrating the effects of partial laws in any one, injurious to the rights of the citizens of another. 4th. To guard generally against the invasions of property and right by fraudulent and oppressive laws of particular states enforced by their own tribunals. 5th. To guard the rights and conciliate the confidence of foreigners, by giving them the option of tribunals created by and responsible to, the general government; which having the immediate charge of our external relations, including the care of our national peace, might be expected to be more tenacious of such an administration of justice as would leave to the citizens of other countries no real cause of complaint. 6th. To protect reciprocally the rights and inspire mutually the confidence of the citizens of different states in their intercourse with each other, by enabling them to resort to Tribunals so constituted as to be essentially free from local bias or partiality. 7th. To give the citizens of each state a fair chance of impartial justice thro’ the medium of those Tribunals, in cases in which the titles to property might depend on the conflicting grants of different states. These were the immensely important objects to be attained by the institution of an adequate Judiciary power in the government of the United States. Nor did its institution depend upon mere speculative opinion, tho’ indeed even that would have been sufficient to indicate the expediency of the measure: but experience had actually in a variety of ways demonstrated its necessity.  
The Treaties of the United States had been infracted by state laws, put in execution by state judicatories. The rights of property had been invaded by the same means, in numerous instances, as well with respect to foreigners as to citizens, as well between citizens of different states, as between citizens of the same state. There were many cases in which lands were held or claimed under adverse grants of different states, having rival pretensions; and in respect to which the local tribunals, even if not fettered by the local laws, could hardly be expected to be impartial. In several of the states the courts were so constituted as not to afford sufficient assurance of a pure, enlightened and independent administration of justice; an evil which in some of them still continues. From these different sources serious mischiefs had been felt. The interests of the United States, in their foreign concerns, had suffered; their reputation had been tarnished; their peace endangered; their mutual harmony had been disturbed or menaced; creditors had been ruined or in a very extensive degree much injured; confidence in pecuniary transactions had been destroyed and the springs of industry had been proportionably relaxed. To these circumstances, as much, perhaps, as to any other, that accompanied a defective social organization, are we to attribute that miserable and prostrate situation of our affairs, which immediately before the establishment of our present National Constitution, filled every intelligent lover of his country with affliction and mortification. To the institution of a competent judiciary, little less than to any one provision in that constitution, is to be ascribed the rapid and salutary renovation of our affairs which succeeded.

r subjects.”  
of the component parts of the Judicial power, in the constitution, has an evident eye to the several objects which have been stated: And considering their vast magnitude, no sound politician will doubt that the principal question, with the administration, ought to be, how to give the greatest efficacy to this essential part of the system; in comparison with which the more or less of expence, must be a matter of trivial moment. The difference of expence between an enlarged and a contracted plan, may be deemed an atom in the great scale of national expenditure. The fulfillment of the important ends of this part of our constitutional plan, though with but a small degree of additional energy, facility, or convenience, must infinitely overbalance the consideration of such difference of expence.  
The number of causes which have been tried in these courts, as already intimated, can furnish but a very imperfect test by which to decide upon their utility or necessity. Their existence alone has a powerful and salutary effect. The liberty to use them, even where it is not often exercised, inspires confidence in the intercourse of business. They are viewed as beneficent guardians whose protection may be claimed when necessary. They induce caution in the state courts, and promote in them, a more attentive, if not a more able administration of justice. Though in some districts of the union the federal courts are seldom resorted to, in others they are used in an extensive degree, particularly as between foreigners and citizens, and between citizens of different states.  
That their organization throughout the U. States ought to be uniform, will not be denied; and it is evident that it ought to be regulated by the situation of those parts in which a greater degree of employment denotes the courts to be most necessary: Of consequence, if the quantity of business were at all a guide, the scenes in which there is the greatest employment for the federal courts, ought to furnish the rule of computation; it ought not to be sought for in the aggregate of business, throughout the union. In reference to this point, it is likewise material to observe that, from the manner in which the federal courts were constituted, previous to the last arrangement, the organization of the state courts was so much better adapted to expedition, as to afford a strong motive for giving them a preference. The establishment of circuit courts, as now modified, will vary that circumstance, and therefore, attract more business; but it is evident that, it must require a course of years, fully to exemplify its operations, which cannot be seen in a few months, or in a single year. To attempt, therefore, to draw important inferences from the short experience hitherto had, is worse than puerile.

IN the rage for change, or under the stimulus  
of a deep-rooted animosity against the former ad-  
ministrations, or for the sake of gaining popular fa-  
vour by a profuse display of extraordinary zeal for  
economy, even our judiciary system has not pas-  
sed unassaifed. The attack here is not so open as  
that on the revenue; but when we are told that  
the states individually have “ principal care of our  
persons, our property and our reputation ; consti-  
tuting the great field of human concerns ; and that  
therefore we may well doubt whether our organization  
is not too complicated, too expensive ; whether offices  
and officers have not been multiplied unnecessarily  
and sometimes injuriously to the service they were  
meant to promote ;” when afterwards it is observ-  
ed that “the Judiciary System will of course pre-  
sent itself to the contemplation of Congress;” and  
when it appears that pains had been taken to form  
and communicate a numerical list of all the cau-  
ses decided since the first establishment of the  
courts, in order that Congress may be able to  
judge of the proportion which the institution bears  
to the business ; with al! these indications it is not  
to be misunderstood that the intention was une-  
quivocally to recommend material alterations in  
the system.  
  
No bad thermometer of the capacity of our Chief  
Magistrate for government is furnished, by the  
rule which he offers for judging of the utility of the  
Iederal Courts ; namely, the exact numéer of cau-  
ses which have been by them decided. There is  
ltardly any stronger symptom of a pigmy mind,  
than a propensity to allow greater weight to se-  
condary than to primary considerations.  
  
It ought at least to have been adverted to, that  
if this circumstance were a perfect criterion, it is  
yet too early to apply it, especially to the courts  
recently erected : And it might have merited re-  
flection, that it would have been prudent to wait  
for a more advanced period of the Presidential

term, to ascertain what influence the great change  
which has lately happened in ovr pudlic functiona-  
ries may have on the confidence, which in many  
parts of the Union has heretofore been reposed in  
the State courts, so as to prevent a preference of  
those of the United States.  
  
But to enable us duly to appreciate the wisdom  
ofthe projected innovation, it is necessary to re-  
view the objects which were designed to hw accom-  
plished by the arrangement of the Judiciary power,  
as itis seen in the constitution, and to examine the  
organization which has been adopted to give effect  
to those objects.  
  
It is well known to all who were acquainted with  
the situation ofour public affairs, when the consti-  
tution was framed, and it is to be inferred from  
the provisions of the instrument itself, that the ob-  
jects contemplated, were, Ist. To provide a faith-  
ful and efficient organ for carrying into execution  
the laws of the United States, which otherwise  
would be a dead letter. 2d. To secure the fair in-  
terpretation and execution of our treaties with {fo-  
reign nations. 3d. To maintain harmony between  
the individual states ; not only by an independent  
and impartial mode of determining controversies  
between them, but by frustrating the effects of  
partial laws in any one, injurious to the rights of  
the citizens of another. 4th. To guard gei- rally  
against the invasions of property and right by  
fraudulent and oppressive laws of particular states  
enforced by their own tribunals. 5th. ‘To guard  
the rights and conciliate the confidence of foreign-  
ers, by giving them the option of tribunals creat-  
ed by and responsible to the general government ;  
which having the immediate charge of our exter-  
nal relations, including the care of our national  
peace, might be expected to be more tenacious of  
such an administration of justice as would leave to  
the citizens of other countries no real cause of com-~  
plaint. 6th.To protect reciprocally the rights, and  
inspire mutually the confidence of the citizens of  
different states in their intercourse with each other,  
by enabling them to resort to tribunals so consti-  
tuted as to be essentially free from lecal bias or par-  
tiality. 7th. Yo give the citizens of each state a  
fair chance of impartial justice through the medi-  
um of those tribunals, in cases in which the ti-  
tles to property might depend on the conflicting  
grants of different states.---These were the im-  
mensely important objects to be attained by the  
institution of an adequate Judiciary power in the  
government of the United States. Nor did its in-  
stitution depend upon mere svulative opinion,  
though indeed even that would have been suffici-  
ent to indicate the expediency of the measure:  
but experience had actually in a variety of ways  
demonstrated its necessity.  
  
The treaties of the United States had been in-  
fracted by state laws, put in execution by state ju-  
dicatories. The rights of property had been in-  
vaded by the same means, in numerous instances,  
as well with respect to foreigners as to citizens ;  
as well between citizens of different states, as be-  
tween citizens of the same state. There were  
many cases in which lands were held or claimed  
under adverse grants of different states, having ri-  
val pretensions ; and in respect to which the local  
tribunals, even if not fettered by the local laws,  
could hardly be expected to be impartial. In seve-  
ral of the states the courts were so constituted as  
not to afford sufficient assurance of a pure, enlight-  
ened and independent administration of justice ;  
an evil which jn some of them still continues.  
From these different sources, serious mischicfs  
had been felt. The interests of the United States,  
in their foreign concerns, had suffered ; their re-  
putation had been tarnished ; their peace endan-  
gered ; their mutual harmony had been disturbed  
or menaced; creditors had been ruined or ina  
very extensive degree much injured; confidence  
in pecuniary transactions had been destroved,  
and the springs of industry had been proportidna-

bly relared. To these circumstances, as much,  
perhaps, as toany other, that accompanied a defec-  
tive social organization, are we to attribute that  
miserable and prostrate situation of our affairs,  
which immediately before the establishment of our  
present National Constitution, filled every intelli-  
gent lover of his country with affliction and mor-  
tification. To the institution of a competent judi-  
ciary. little less than to any one provision in that  
constitution, is to be ascribed the rapid and salu-  
tary renovation of our affairs which succeeded.  
  
‘The enumeration* of the component parts of  
the Judicial power, in the constitution, has an  
evident eye to the several objects which have been  
stated: And considering their vast magnitude, no  
sound politician will doubt that the principal ques-  
tion. with the administration, ought to be, how to  
give the greatest efficacy to this essential part of  
the system; in comparison with which the more  
or less of expense, must be a matter of trivial mo-

larred and a contracted plan, may be deemed an  
atom in the great scale of national expenditure.  
The fulfillment of the important ends of this part  
of our constitutional plan, though with but a small  
degree of additional energy, facility, or conveni-  
ence, must infinitely overbalance the consideration  
of svch difference of expense.  
  
The number of causes, which have been tried in

avery imperfect test by which to decide upon their  
utility or necessity. ‘heir existence alone has a

bufinefs ; with all thefe indications it 1s not  
to be mifunderftood that the intention was  
unequivocally to recommend matéerza/ alter-  
ations inthe fyftem.  
  
No bad thermometer of the capacity of our  
Chief Magiftrate for government is furaifhed  
by the rule which he offers for judging of the  
utility of the Federal Courts; namely, the  
exaét number of caufes which have been by  
them decided. There is hardly any meonger  
fymptom ofa pigmy mind, than a propenfity  
to allow greater weight to /econdary than to  
primary confiderations.  
  
It ought at leafl to have been adverted to  
that if this ciremflance were a perfeét crite-  
rion, it is yet too early to apply it efpecially  
to the courts recently erefted: And it might  
have merited refle&amp;tion, that it would have  
been prudent to wait for a more advanced  
period of the Prefidential term, to afcertain  
what influence the great change which has  
lately happened in our public fundlionartes

ftate a fair chance of impartial juftice thro’ the  
medium of thofe Tribunals, in cafes in which  
the titles to property might depend on the con-  
fli€ting grants of different ftates.—Thefe were  
the immenfely important objeéts to be attain-  
ed by the inflitution of an adequate Judiciary  
power inthe government of the United States.  
Nor did its inftitution depend upon mere {pec-  
ulative opinion, tho’ indeed even that would  
have been fufficient to indicate the expediency  
of the meafure: but experience had aétually  
in a variety of ways demonftrated its neceflity.  
  
The Treaties of the United States had been  
infratled by fate laws, put in execution by  
ftate judicatories. The right of property had  
been invaded by the fame means, in nume-  
rous inftances,as well with refpeét to foreign-  
ers as to citizens; as well between citizens  
  
of different flates, as between citizens of the.  
  
fame ftate. There were manv cafes in  
which lands were held or claimed under ad-  
verife grants of different ftates, having rival  
pretenfions; and in refpe&amp; to which the lo-  
cal tribunals, even if not fettered by the lo-  
cal laws, could hardly be expeéted to be im-  
partial. In feveral of the ftates the courts  
were fo conftituted as not to afford fufficient  
afflurance of a pure, enlightened and inde-  
pendant adminiftration of juftice; an evil  
which in fome of them ftill continues. From  
thefe different fources ferious mifchiefs had  
been felt. The intereft of the United States,  
in their foreign concerns, had fuffered ; their  
reputation had been tarnifhed ; their peace  
endangered ; their mutual harmony bad been  
difturbed or menaced ; creditors had been  
ruined orin a very extenfive degree much  
injured ; confidence in pecuniary tranfac-  
tions had been deftroyed, and the’ {prings of  
induftry had been proportionably relaxed.  
To thefe circumftances, as much, perhaps, as  
to any other, that accompanied a defeétive  
focial organization, are we to attribute that  
miferable and proftrate fituation of our affairs,  
which immediately betore the eftablifhment

eflicacy to this effential part of the fyftem: |  
  
in comparifon with which the more or lefs  
of expence, muft be a matter of trivial mo-  
ment. The difference of expence between  
an enlarged and a contraéted plan, may be  
deemed an atom in the great {cale of nation-  
al expenditure. The fulfilment of the im-  
portant ends of this part of our conftitutional  
plan, though with but a {mall degree of addi-  
tional energy, facility, or convenience, muft  
infinitely overbalance the confideration of  
fuch diflerence of expentfe.  
  
The number of caufes which have been  
tried in thele courts, as already intimated,  
can furnifh but a very imperfeét teft by  
which to decide upon their utility or necefli-  
ty. ‘Their exiftence alone has a powes ful and  
falutary effeét. The liberty to ufe them, even  
where it is not often exercifed, infpires con-  
fidence in the intercoufe of bufinels. “They  
are viewed as beneficient guardians whofe  
protection may be claimed when neceflary.  
They induce caution in the ftate courts, and  
promote in them, a more attentive, if nota  
more able adminiftration of juftice. Though  
in fome diftriéts of the union the federal  
courts are feldom reforted to, in others they  
are ufed in an extenfive degree, particularly  
as between foreigners and citizens, and be-  
tween citizens of different ftates.  
  
That their organization throughout the U.  
States ought to be uniform, will not be de-  
nied ; and it is evident that it ought to be reg-  
ulated by the fituation of thofe parts in which  
a greater degree of employment denotes the  
court to be moft neceflary ; Ot confequence,  
ifthe quantity of bufinefs were at alla guide,  
the fcenes in which there isthe greateft em-  
ployment forthe federal courts, ought to fur-  
nifh the rule of computation: it ought not to  
be fought for in the aggregate of bufinefs,  
throughout the union.—In reference to this

IN the rajje for change, or under the ftimu.  
lus of a deep rooted animofity again ft &#x27;he for  
mer adrainiftrations, or for the fake of gaining  
popular favor by a profufe difplay of extraor­  
dina&gt;y /cal for economy, even our judiciary  
ft Item has not parted unart.iiled. The attack  
%.re is not fo open as that on the revenue ; but  
when we are told that the ftates individually  
h»ve “ principal care of our perfons, our prop,  
erty and cur leputation ; conftituting the great  
fold of human concerns ; and that therefore  
W! may well doult whether our organization is not  
too complicated, too espen/ive ; whether offices and  
officers have not been multiplied unneceffarily,  
and fornetimes injurioufly to the fervice they  
Were meant to promote,” when afterwards it  
is obferved that “ the Judiciary Syftem will of  
courje prefect itfelf to the contemplation of Con.  
grefa «nd when it appears that pains had  
b*en tak n to form and communicate a nu­  
merical lift of all the caufts decided fince the  
firfl eftabliffiment of the c®urts, in order that  
Congrefs might be able to judge of the propor­  
tion which the inftitution bears to the bufinefs ;  
with ail thcfe indications, it is not to he mifun  
derffood that the intention was unequivocally  
to reccommend material alterations in the fyf­  
tetti.  
No bad thermomenter of the capacity of our  
CJfief Magiftrate, for government, is furnilhed  
by the uric which he offers for judging of the  
utility of the Federal Courts ; namely., the exa&lt;5t  
number of caufes which have been by them de­  
cided- There is hardly any ftronger fymtnm  
•f a pigmy mind, than a prepenfity to allow  
greater weight to fccondary than to primary con­  
uderation .  
It ought at leaft to have been advertel to,  
that if this circumftance were a petted c* iteri -  
on, it is yet tooea&#x27;ly to apply it, cfpecially to  
the courts recently e’effed : And it might h ive  
merited reflexion, that it w’ouid have been p»u­  
dent to wait for a more advanced period of the  
Frefi lent.ri term, to afeertair. what influence the  
great ch mge which has lately happened in our  
publtc funfit onariet may have on the confidence  
which in man* parts of the Union has hereto­  
fore been repofed in the State Courts, fo as $  
prevent a preference of thole of the United  
tales  
  
But, to enibk us duly to appreciate the wif  
deni of ti e projected innovation, it is neceffary  
to review the objects which were deligned to be  
accompiiihed hvthe arrangment of thejudriary  
power, as it is feen in the conftitution, and to  
examine the organization which has been adop­  
ted, to give e(Fe&amp; to thole objects.  
It is well known to all who were acquainted  
withihe fr.uation of public affairs when the con  
It i«tr» be infei red from  
the previfluns ofihe inftrument itfelf, that the  
objects contemplated sveie, ift. Topiovide a  
faithful and efficacious organ lor carrying into  
execution the laws of the United States, which  
other wife would be a dead letter. 2d. To fe­  
cure the fair interpretation and execution ofexuir  
treaties with foreign nations. 3d. To main­  
tain ha’inony between the individual ftates ;  
not only by an independent and impartial mode  
of determining controverfies between them, but  
by hruftrating the effefb of partial laws in any  
one, injurious to the rights of thecitizei s of ano  
ther. 4th. To gu rrd generally ?gainft the in  
  
vahoDs of property and right, by fraudulent  
and oppreftive laws of particular dates, enfor­  
ced by their owe tribunals* 5th. To guard the  
righ s avid conciliate the confidence of foreigners,  
by giving them the option of tribunals created  
by and refponfible to, the general government ;  
which, having the immediate charge of ®ur ex­  
ternal relations, including the care of our na  
tional peace, might be expedfed to be more te*  
nacious of fuch an adrninidration of juftice as  
would leave to the citizens of other countries  
no real caufe of complaint. 6&#x27;h. To protedf  
reciprocally the rights and infpire mutually the  
confidence of the citizens of different dates in  
their intercourfe with each other, by enabling  
them to refort to tribunals fo condituted, as to  
be eflentiilly free from local-bias or partialliry.  
7th. To give the citizens of each date a fair  
chance of impartial judice through the medi  
utn of thole tribunals, in cafes in which the ti.  
lies to property might depend on the conflict  
ing grants of different dates.—Thefe were the  
immenleiy important objedls to be attained f y  
the itiditution of an adequate Judiciary power,  
in the government of the United States. Nor  
did its ind tution depend upon mere fpeculative  
opinion, though indeed, even ih«t would have  
been fudicient to indicate the expediency of the  
meafur£ : but experience had actually, in a  
variety of ways, demondratec^ its necedity.  
The treaties of the United States, had been  
infracted by date laws, put in execution by  
date jadicatories- The rights of property had  
been invaded by the Time means, in numerous&#x27;  
indances, as well with refpedt to foreigners as  
to citizens ; as well between citizens of differ­  
ent dates, as between citizens of the fame date.  
There were many cafes in which lands were  
held or claimed under adverfe grants of differ­  
ent dares, having rival pretenfions ; and in re  
Jfpevd to which the local tribunals, even if not  
fettered b? the local laws, could hardly be ex  
pedted to be impartial. In feveral of the dates  
the courts were fo condituted as not to afFord  
fudicient afliiraace of a pure, enlightened and  
independent a d/nr niff ration of jadice : an evil  
which in feme of them dill continues. From  
ihtle different fconrccs* felons roifehiefs had  
been felt. The intereds of ihe Unrted S ates, in  
Mviir foreign concerns, lud differed i their re­  
  
putatica 1iaJ&#x27;been tftVi&amp;ed ; their peace efldtan*  
gered ; the mutual harmony had been ruineJ  
| or in a very extenfive degiee injured ; canfi  
! dence in pecuniary rranfadions had been de  
itroyed, and the fprings of incluftry had been  
| proportionably relaxed. &#x27;I’o thefe orcumiVan*  
ce&gt;*, as much, peih-tps, as to any other, that ac  
companied a dehClive focial organization, are  
we to attribute that miferable and proftrate fit- j  
uarion of our affairs, which immediately before  
the eflablifbment of our prefent National Con­  
lii&#x27;ution, filled every intelligent lover of his  
country with affufiion and mortification- To  
i the inftitution of a competent judiciary, little  
lefs than to any one provifiion in that conftitu.  
tion, is to be afcribed the rapid and fduiaiy  
renovation of onr affairs which fucceeded­  
The enumeration* of the component parts  
of the judicial power, in the conRitttiion, 1ms an  
evident eye to the feveral ohjeCb which have  
  
been lilted : And conndering their vail mag­  
nitude, no found politician will doubt that the  
principal quellion with the adminiftration,  
ought to be. how to give the greateft efficacy to  
to this efieotial pare ot the fyftemr:—in compa&#x27;i&quot;  
loo with which the more or lefs of expence, muft  
be a matter of trivial moment. The difference of  
expence between an enlarged and a contracted  
plan, may be deemed an atom in the great  
fcale of national expenditure. The fulfilment  
of the important e: ds in this part of our confti­  
tutional plan, though wifh but a i&#x27;mali degree  
of additional energy, facility, or convenience,  
mud infinitely overbalance the confideration in  
furh difference of expence.  
The number of caufes which have been tried  
in thefe courts, as already intimated, can fur ,  
i(h but a v-.rv imperfed tell by which to d cide  
upon this u’ility or necelfity.—Their exiltence  
alone has a powerful and falmary effetf. The ]  
liber tv to ofe them, even were ir is n &gt;t cxerc f*  
j ed, infpires confidence in the intccourfe of bufi- i  
: nefs. They are veiwed as beneficent gaurJ- !  
1 ians whole protection may be c&#x27;nimrd when&#x27;  
neccffiry. They induce camion in the fta e  
coutis, and promote in them, a more attentive, 1  
if not a m »re able adrnmtftration of jolli e  
though in lome diftriCls ol the union the feder.  
al courts are ftidom reforttd to, in o*h-rs th y  
are ufed in an extenfive decree particularly as  
between foreigners, and citizens, and between  
citizens of different Hates.  
That their organization throughout the U  
ted States ought to be uniform, will not be de­  
nied ; and it is evident thar h oup.ht to be re  
gulated by the fitoition of \hofe pa«ts in which  
a greater degree of employment d*. notes the  
I! conrts to be m dl neceifary : Of cnnfequrncc.  
if the quan&#x27;i y of bufinefs were at all a guide,

i nilh the ru&#x27;e of tompuuti n ; it ought not to

j throughout the union.— In reference to this  
j point it is likewife material to obferve, that,  
i from the manner in which the federal courts  
| were conftitutej, previous to the laft arrang  
I ment, the organization of the Hate courts wax fo  
j much better adapted to expedition, as to afford  
ja rtrong mo ive for giving them the preference.  
The efiabldhment of circuit courts, as now mo­  
dified, will vr.iy th.&lt;f circumftance, and thtre.  
fore at[ra&lt;51 more bi.fir.efs ; bit» it is evident that  
it muff require acou.fe of years fully to exem­  
plify its operations, which cannot he feen in a  
fingle year. To attempt, therefore, to draw  
important it f;rences from the Ihort experience  
hitherto had, is worfe thin puerile.
