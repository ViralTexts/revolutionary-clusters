The most important speaker was William Pitt, who was present for the first time after a protracted illness. In the course of his speech he criticized the present ministry for its long delay in reporting to Parliament on events in the colonies, and he attacked much more severely the previous ministry, of which George Grenville had been the active head, saying that “every capital measure they have taken, has been entirely wrong!” Conway responded, agreeing in general with Pitt’s expressed opposition to taxing the colonies and explaining that he and
