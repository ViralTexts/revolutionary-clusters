 Letter.  
Sir  
Amsterdam Octr. 5 1780  
  
Your first Proposition is to prove by Striking Facts, “that an implacable Hatred and Aversion reigns throughout America.”  
In Answer to this, I beg leave to Say that the Americans are animated by higher Principles and better and Stronger Motives than Hatred and Aversion. They universally aspire after a free Trade with all the commercial World, instead of that mean Monopoly, in which they were shackled by great Britain, to the disgrace and Mortification of America, and to the Injury of all the rest of Europe, to whom it seems as if God and Nature intended, that So great a Magazine of Productions the raw Materials of Manufactures, So great a source of Commerce, and so rich a Nursery of Seamen as America is should be open. They despize, Sir, they disdain the Idea of being again Monopolized by any one Nation whatsoever: and this contempt is at least as powerfull a Motive of Action as any Hatred whatsoever.  
Moreover Sir they consider themselves contending for the purest Principles of Liberty civil and religious: for those Forms of Government under the Faith of which their Country was planted: and for those great Improvements of them which have been made by their new Constitutions. They consider themselves not only as contending for these great Blessings but against the greatest Evils that any Country ever suffered, for they know if they were to be deceived by England, to break their Union among themselves and their Faith with their Allies, they would ever after be in the Power of England who would bring them into the most abject submission to the Government of a Parliament, the most corrupted in the World in which they would have no Voice nor Influence, at 3000 miles distance from them.  
But if Hatred must come into consideration, I know not how to prove their Hatred better than by shewing the Provocations they have had to Hatred.  
If tearing up from the foundation, those Forms of Government under which they were born and educated and thrived and prospered, to the infinite Emolument of England—if imposing Taxes upon them, or endeavouring to do it for Twenty years without their consent, if commencing Hostilities upon them—burning their Towns—butchering their People—deliberately starving Prisoners, ravishing their Women—exciting Hosts of Indians to butcher and scalp them and purchasing Germans to destroy them, and hiring Negro servants to murder their Masters—if all these and many other things as bad are not Provocation enough to Hatred, I would request Mr. Calkoen to tell me what is or can be. All these Horrors, the English have practised in every Part of America from Boston to Savanna.  
2. Your second Proposition is to shew that this is general, at least so general that the Tories are in so small a Number, and of such little Force, that they are counted as Nothing.  
If Mr. Calkoen would believe me, I could testify as a Witness. I could describe all the sources; all the Grounds, Springs, Principles and Motives to Toryism through the Continent. This would lead me into great length: and the Result of all would be my Sincere opinion that the Tories through out the whole Continent do not amount to the twentyeth Part of the People. I will not however obtrude my Testimony, nor my opinion. I will appeal to Witnesses who cannot be Suspected. General Burgoine and General How. Burgoine has published a Narrative of his Proceedings in which he Speaks of the Tories. I left the Pamphlet at Paris, but it may easily be had from London.  
General How has also published a Narrative relative to his Conduct in America. Page 49 General How says “The only attempt by Bodies of Men to form themselves in Arms, and to assist in Suppressing the Rebellion, happened in North Carolina, in the Spring of 1776, when it was absolutely impossible for me to give Assistance to the Insurrection. The Plan was concerted between a Settlement of highland Emigrants, and a Body of Americans in that Province, distinguished by the name of Royalists. (He should have Said Regulators). They engaged to obey the orders of Governor Martin, who proposed they Should operate in favour of the Troops from Europe, under Earl Cornwallis. The Loyalists promised 5000, the Highlanders 700, Men. The former insisted upon their assembling immediately; the latter urged the Expediency of waiting the Arrival of the British Troops, but yeilded to the Importunity of the Royalists, and repaired in Arms to the Rendezvous, Stronger than the stipulated Compliment. The Loyalists, instead of 5000, did not assemble a Twentyeth Part of that Number, and two Companies of these deserted, upon the near Approach of the Rebells. The Highlanders Stood their ground, and fought bravely, but being overpowered, were defeated with considerable Loss, and forced to disperse.  
  
  
  
“My Letter of 20 Dec. 1776 was written before the Affair of Trenton, and I could have no reason to Suspect the Fidelity of those who came in, to Us from Monmouth; but I was Soon undeceived. Many, very many, of these Loyalists, were a Short time afterwards taken in Arms against Us, and others killed with my Protections in their Pocketts. In the Pocketts of the Killed, and Prisoners, were also found Certificates of those very Men having Subscribed a declaration of Allegiance, in Consequence of the Proclamation of the Kings Commissioners for a general Indemnity. These are notorious Facts.  
“Various offers of raising Men were made to me, nor did I decline any of those offers that brought with them the least Prospect of Success; but I must add, that very few of them were fullfilled in the Extent proposed.  
“Mr. Oliver Delancey, who was reputed to be the most likely man in New York, to induce the Loyalists of that Province to join the Kings Troops was appointed a Brigadier General, and authorized to raise three Battalions, to consist of 1500 privates, placing at the Head of each the most respectable Characters, recommended as Such by himself, and by Governor Tryon. Every possible Effort was used by those Gentlemen, not only in the districts possessed by the Kings Troops but by employing persons to go through the country, and invite the well affected to come in. Several of the officers (as I have Since been informed) anxious to complete their Corps, Sought for Recruits, even among the Prisoners, who were then very numerous, and ventured to hold out to them the Temptations of pay, Liberty, and Pardon. Notwithstanding all these Efforts and Encouragements,Brigadier-General Delancey, at the opening of the Campain in 1777, instead of 1500, had raised only 597.  
“Mr. Courtland Skinner, who was acknowledged to possess considerable Influence in the Jersies, where he had Served the office of Attorney General with great Integrity and Reputation, was also appointed a Brigadier General, and authorized to raise five Battalions, to consist of 2500 privates, under the command of Gentlemen of the Country, nominated by himself. The Same Efforts were made as for the raising of Delanceys Corps; but at the opening of the Campaign of 1777, Brigadier General Skinners numbers amounted only to 517, towards his expected Battalions of 2500.  
  
“In November 1777 Brigadier General Delanceys Corps encreased to 693 and Brigadier General Skinners to 859—In May 1778 their progress was so slow, that the first had only advanced to 707, the latter to 1101.  
“Several other Corps were offered to be raised, and were accepted, in the Winter of 1776, making in the whole thirteen, to consist of 6,500 men, including the Brigades of Delancey and Skinner. But in May, 1778, the whole Number in all these thirteen Corps amounted only to 3,609, little more than half the proposed complement, and of these, only a small Proportion were Americans.  
“Upon our taking Possession of Philadelphia, the Same, and indeed, greater Encouragements were held out to the People of Pensylvania. Mr. William Allen, a Gentleman who was Supposed to have great Family Influence in that Province—Mr. Chalmers, much respected in the three lower Counties on Delaware, and in Maryland—and Mr. Clifton, the Chief of the Roman Catholic Perswasion, of whom there were Said to be many in Philadelphia, as well as in the Rebel Army, serving against their Inclinations: These Gentlemen were appointed Commandants of Corps, to receive, and form for Service, all the well affected that could be obtained. And what was the Success of these Efforts? In May 1778, when I left America, Colonel Allen had raised only 152 rank and File—Colonel Chalmers 336—and Coll. Clifton 180, which, together with three Troops of light Dragoons, consisting of 132 Troopers, and 174 real volunteers from Jersey, under Coll. Vandyke amounting in the whole to 974 men, constituted all the Force that could be collected in Pensylvania, after the most indefatigable Exertions, during Eight months.  
“To make the Conclusion as easy as possible, I shall state a very Strong Fact, to shew how far the Inhabitants were anxious to promote the Kings service, even without carrying Arms.  
“As soon as we were in Possession of Philadelphia, my Intention was to fortify it in Such a manner, as that it might be tenable by a small Number of Men, whilst the main Army should keep the Field, and Act against General Washington. To effectuate this Purpose, I sent orders from Germantown to the Chief Engineer, to construct Redoubts and to form the necessary Lines of Communication. That the Work might be expedited and the Labour of the Soldiers Spared, I, at the Same time directed him to employ the Inhabitants, and pay them 8d a day besides a Ration of Salt Provisions each, without which I was persuaded convinced they could not have been persuaded to have worked at all.  
  
“Mr. Galloway, whom I had previously talked with upon the Subject had assured me there would be no difficulty in finding 500 men for this Business; and I presume he exerted himself to fulfil the Expectations he had given me. But with all the Assiduity of that Gentleman, and all the means made use of by the Chief Engineer, the whole Number that could be prevailed on to handle the Pick axe, and Spade, for the Construction of the Redoubts and Abbatis, amounted, each day, upon an average to no more than between Seventy and Eighty Men.”  
  
  
  
I have quoted to you General Hows Words, and one would think this was Sufficient to shew how much, or how little Zeal there is for the British Cause in North America. When We consider, that in the Period, here mentioned the English Army had been in Possession of the Cities of Boston, Newport, New York and Philadelphia, and that they had marched through the Jersies, Part of Maryland and Pensilvania, and with all their Arts, Bribes, Threats and Flatteries, which General How calls their Efforts and Exertions they were able to obtain so few Recruits and very few of these Americans, I think that any impartial Man must be convinced that the Aversion and Antipathy to the British Cause is very general, So general that the Tories are to be accounted but a very little Thing.  
The Addresses, which they have obtained to the King and his Generals when their Army was in Boston, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, Savanna and Charlestown shew the same Thing. It is well known that every Art of Flattery, and of Terror was always used to obtain subscribers to these Addresses. Yet the miserable Numbers they have obtained and the still more despicable Character of most of these small Numbers shew that the British Cause is held in universal Horror very low Esteem. Even in Charlestown, the Capital of a Province which contains two hundred thousand Whites, they were able to obtain only 210 subscribers, and among these there is not one Name that I ever remember to have heard before.  
I am Sorry I have not Burgoines Narrative, which shews in the same Point of Light, the Resources the English are likely to find in the Tories, to be nothing more than a sure Means of getting rid of a great Number of their Guineas.  
I have the Honour to be, Sir, your humble sert  
  
John Adams  
  
  
To learn the present state of America, it is sufficient to read the public Papers. The present State of Great Britain and its Dependencies may be learned the Same Way. The omnipotence of the British Parliament and the omnipotence of the British Navy, are like to go the Same Way

over to the Britiſh troops for protection (as aſſerted by the

ſame efforts were made as for the raiſing of Delancey&#x27;s corps;  
but, at the opening of the campaign 1777, Brigadier General  
Skinner&#x27;s numbers amounted only to 517, towards his expected  
five Battalions of 2,500. 7  
  
In November, 1777, Brigadier-General Delancey&#x27;s corps en-  
creaſed to 693, and Brigadier-General Skinner&#x27;s to 859.—In  
  
May, 1778 their progreſs was ſo flow, that the firſt had only ad-  
vanced to 707, the latter to 1101.  
  
Several other corps were offered to be raiſed, and were  
accepted, in the winter of 1776, making in the whole  
thirteen, to cogſiſt of 6,500 men, including the Brigades  
of Delancey and Skinner. But in May, 1778, the whole  
number in all theſe thirteen corps amounted only to  
3-609, little more than half the promiſed complement, * 55

theſe (as I have before obſerved) only a ſmall proportion were  
  
Americans.  
  
Upon our taking poſſeſſion of Philadelphia, the ſame, and  
indeed greater encouragements were held&#x27; out to the people of  
Pennſylvania.—Mr. William Allen, a gentleman who was ſup-  
poſed to have great family influence in that province — Mr.  
Chalmers, much reſpected in the three Lower Counties on Dela-  
ware, and in Maryland—and Mr. Clifton, the chief of the  
Roman Catholic perſuaſion, of whom there were ſaid to be many  
in Philadelphia, as well as in the rebel army, ſerving againſt their  
inclinations : Theſe gentlemen were appointed Commandants of  
corps, to receive, and form for ſervice, all the well-affected

ed, in the winter of 1976, making in the whole thirteen, to con-  
ſiſt of 6,500 men, including the brigades of D-lancey and Skinner.  
But in May, 1778, the whole number in all theſe thirteen corps,  
amounted only to g,609, little more than half the propoſed com-

poſed to have great family influence in that Province; Mr. Cu a *  
Mzx3, much reſpected in the three lower counties on Delaware,

mers 336 ; and Colonel Clifton 180&#x27;; which, together with three  
  
  
  
the whole to 974 men, conſtituted all the force that could be col-  
lected in Pennſylvania, afterthe moſt indefatigable excrtions; du-  
ring eight months.  
  
% To make the concluſion as eaſy as poſſible, I ſhall Rate a very  
ſtrong fact, to ſhew how far the inhabitants were anxious to pro-

&quot; l^at a&quot; implacable hatred and averjion  
&quot; reigns throughout America  
In answer to this, I beg leave to fay, that the  
Americans are animated by higher principles, and  
better and stronger motives, than hatred and aver­  
sion. They universally aspire after a free trade  
with all the commercial world, instead of that  
mean monopoly, in which they were (hackled by  
Great Britain, to the disgrace and mortification  
of America, and to the injury of all the veil of  
Europe; to whom it seems as if God and na­  
ture intended that so great a magazine of pro­  
ductions, the raw materials of manufactures, so  
great a source of commerce, and forich anurfery  
of feainen, as America is, should be open. They  
dcfpife, Sir, they disdain the idea of being again  
nionopolifed by any one nation whatsoever : And  
this contempt is at leafl as powerful a motive of  
adtion as any hatred whatsoever.  
Moreover, Sir, they consider themselves con­  
tending for the purest principles of liberty, civil  
and religious ; for those forms of government un­  
der the faith of which their country was planted ;  
and for those great improvements of them which  
have been made by their constitutions. 1 hey  
consider themselves not only as contending for  
these great blessings, but against the greatest evils  
thatany country ever fuffered ; for they know, if  
they were to be deceived by England, to break  
their union among themselves, and their faith  
with their allies, they would-ever after be in the

power of England, who would bring them into  
the most abject submission to the government ot  
a Parliament, the most corrupted in the world,  
m which they would have no voice nor influence,  
at threethoufand miles distance from them.  
But if hatred must come into consideration, I  
know not how to prove their hatred better than by  
fnewing the provocations they have had to hatred.  
If tearing up from the foundation those forms  
of government under which they were born and  
educated, and thrived and prospered, to the in­  
finite emolument of England—if imposing taxes  
upon them, or endeavouring to doit, for twenty  
years, without their consent—is commencing hos­  
tilities upon them— burning their towns—butch­  
ering their people—deliberately starving prifon­  
ers—ravifliing their women—exciting hosts of In­  
dians to butcher and fcalpthem—and purchasing  
Germans to destroy them, and hiring negro ser­  
vants to murder their masters ;—lf all these, and  
many other things as bad, are not provocations  
enough to hatred, J would request Mr. Calkoen  
to tell uie what is or can be. All iliefe horrors  
the English have pracftifed in every part of Ame­  
rica, from Boftoai to Savanna.  
3. Your second proportion is &quot; to flxe-ui that th &#x27;n  
&quot; &#x27;&#x27; general—at Icpjl so general, that the Tories art  
&quot; infjfmall a number, (itid of such little force, thai  
&quot; they are counted as nothing.&quot;  
If Mr. Cai.koen would believe me, I could  
teftify as a witness ; 1 could describe all the sources,  
all the grounds, springs, principles, and motives tc  
Toryism through the continent. This would lead  
me into great lengths ; and the refultofsll would  
be, my fine ere opinion that the Tories throughout  
the whole continent do not amount to a twentieth  
part of the people. I will not, however obtrude my  
testimony, nor my opinion : 1 will appeal to wit­  
nelles who cannot be fufpecled, General Bur­  
go yne and General llosve. Burgoyne has pub­  
lished a narrative of his Proceedings, in which  
he speaks of tlie Tories. I left the pamphlet  
at Paris, but it may eaiily be had from London.  
General Howe has also published a narrative re­  
lative to his conduct in America. Page 49, Gene­  
ral Howe fays, &quot; The only attempt bv bodies of  
men tp form themselves in arms, and to aflift in  
fupprelfing the rebellion, happened iu -&#x27;mi h-Ca­  
rolina, in the spring of 1776, when it was absolute­  
ly impossible for nie to give alii (lance to the insur­  
rection. The plan was concerted bei wren 1 fettle -  
ment of Highland emigrants, and a body of Ame­  
ricans in that Province, distinguished by the name  
of Loyalifls. (He should have said Regulators.)  
They engaged to obey the orders of Governor  
Martin, who proposed they fhonld operate in  
favor of the troops from Europe, under Earl Cor n­  
wallis. The Loyalists promised jooo, the High­  
landers 700 men. The former infilled upon their  
aflembling immediately ; the latter uged the ex­  
pediency of waiting the arrival of the British  
troops, but yielded to the importunity of the loy­  
alifls, and repaired in arms to the place of ren­  
dezvous, stronger than the flipulated compliment.  
The loyalifls, instead of 5000, did not afiemble a  
twentith part of that number ; and,two compa­  
niesof these deserted, vpon the near approach of  
the rebels. The Highlanders flood their ground,  
and fought bravely, but being overpowered, were  
defeated with considerable loss, and forced to  
disperse.  
&quot; My letter of the twentieth of December, 1 776,  
was written before the affair of Trenton, and I  
could have 110 reason to fufpeift the fidelity of  
those who caiue in to us from Moninouth ; but I was  
soon undeceived. Many, very many, of these loy­  
alifls were a short time afterwai&#x27;ds taken in arms  
against us, and others were killed with my protec­  
tions in their pockets. In the pockets of the killed  
and prifonevs, were also found certificates of those  
very men having fubferibed a declaration of alle­  
giance, in conference of the proclamation of the  
King&#x27;s Coinmiflioners for a general indemnity.  
These are notorious fa&lt;fts.  
&lt;&lt; Various offers of raising men were made to  
me, nor did I decline any of those offers that  
brought with them the least profped: of success :  
but I must add, that very few of them were ful­  
filled in the extent proposed.  
&quot; Mr. Olivf.r Delancey, who was reputed  
to be the most likely man in New-York to induce  
the loyalifls of that province to join the King&#x27;s  
troops, was appointed a Brigadier-General, and  
authorised to raile three battalions, to confifl of  
1500 privates, placing at the head of each the  
moftrefpetftablecliara&lt;sers, recommended asfucli  
by himfelfandbv Governor Try on. Every possi­  
ble effort was used by those gentlemen, not only in  
the diftritflsipoffelledbythe King&#x27;s troops, but by  
em ploying persons to go through the conn try, and  
invite the well-affected to come in. Several ol  
the officers (as I have since been informed) anxi  
  
\_PubliJhed on IVeancfday and Saturday  
  
oils to compleat their corps, fought for recruits  
even among the prisoners, who were then very  
numerous, and ventured to hold out to them the  
temptations of pay, liberty, and pardon. Not­  
withltandingall tliefe efforts and encouragements,  
Brigadier General Delancey, at the opening of  
the campaign in i 777, initead of i£oo, hadraifed  
only 597  
&quot; Mr. Courtland Skinner, who was ac­  
knowledged to pofiefs considerable influence in  
the Jerfies, where he had served the office of  
Attorney-General with great integrity and repu­  
tation, was also appointed a Brigadier-General,  
and authorised to raise five batallions, to confilt  
of 2500 privates, under the command of gentle­  
men of the country, nominated by himfelf. The  
fame efforts were made as for the raising of De­  
lancey&#x27;s corps ; but at the opening of the cam­  
paign of 1 777, Brigadier-General Skinner&#x27;s num­  
bers amounted only to 517, towards his expected  
battallions of 2 500.  
&quot; 111 November 1777, Brigadier-General Dc­  
lancey&#x27;s corps encreafed to 69}, and Brigadier-Ge­  
neral Skinner&#x27;s, to §&gt;59. In May 1 778, their pro­  
gress was so flow, that the firft: had only advanced  
to 707, the latter to 1101.  
&quot; Several other corps were offered toberaifed,  
and were accepted, in the Winter of 1776, mak­  
ing in the whole thirteen, to confill of 6,500 men,  
including the Brigades of Delancey and Skinner,  
Butin May, 1 778, the whole number in all these  
thirteen corps, amounted to only 3,609, little  
more than half the proposed compliment, and of  
these Only a final 1 proportion were Americans.  
&quot; Upon our taking pofleflion of Philadelphia,  
the fame, and indeed greater encouragements,  
were held out to the people of Pennsylvania. Mr.  
William Allen, a gentleman who was fuppoi&#x27;ed  
to have great family influence in that province;  
Mr. Chalmers, much refpecT;ed in the three low­  
er counties on Delaware, and in Marylad ; and  
Mr. Clifton, the chief of the Roman Catholic  
perluafion, of whom there were faitl to be many  
in Philadelphia, as well as in the rebel army, ser­  
ving againlt their inclinations ; these gentlemen  
were appointed commandants of corps, toreccive  
and form for service all the well-affected that  
could be obtained. And what was the success of  
these efforts ? In May, 1 778, when I left Ame­  
rica, Col. Allen hadraifed only 152 rank and file ;  
Col. Chalmers 336 ; and Col. Clifton 180 ; which,  
together with three troops oflight dragoons, con­  
fitting of 132 troopers, 174 real volunteers from  
Jersey, under Colonel Vandyke, amounting in  
the whole to 974 men, conflituted all the force  
that could be colleifted in Pennsylvania, after the  
molt indefatigable exertions during eight months.  
&quot;To make the conclusion as easy as poflible, L  
shall state a very strong fa&lt;fl, tolhew how far the  
inhabitants were anxious to promote the king&#x27;s  
service, even without carrying arms.  
&quot; As soon as we were in poii&#x27;eflioh of Philadel­  
phia, my intention was to fortify it in such a man­  
ner, as that it might be tenable by afmall number  
of men, whilst the main army should keep the field  
and act again!! Gen. Washington. To effec­  
tuate this purpose, I sent orders from German­  
-1 own to the chief engineer,to conftrucfl redoubts,  
and to form theneceflary lines of communication.  
That the work might be expedited, and the labor  
of the soldiers spared, I atthe fame time directed  
him to employ the inhabitants, and pay them  
eight pence a day, besides a ration of fait provi­  
sions each, without which, I was convinced, they  
could not have been persuaded to have worked at  
all. Mr. Galloway, whom I had previously  
talked with upon the fubje&lt;ft, had allured me there  
would be no difficulty in finding 500 men for this  
business ; and, I presume, he exerted himfelf to  
fulfil the expectations he had given me. But  
with all the afliduity of that gentleman, and all  
the means made use of by the chief engineer,  
the whole number that could be prevailed on to  
handle the pickaxe and spade, for the construction  
of the redoubts and abbatis, amounted, each day,  
upon an average, to 110 more than between seventy  
and eighty men.&quot;  
I have qiioted to you General Howe&#x27;s words ;  
and one would think this was fufficient to fliew  
how much or liow little zeal there is for the Bri­  
tifli cause in North America. When we consider,  
that in the period here mentioned, rlie Englifli  
army had been in pofleflion of Boston, Newport,  
New-York and Philadelphia, and that they had  
inarched through the Jerlies, part of Maryland,  
and Pennsylvania ; and with all their arts, bribes,  
threats and flatteries, which Gen. Howe calls  
their efforts and exertions, they were able to ob­  
tain so few recruits, and very few of these Ameri­  
cans ; I think that any impartial man mufl. be con­  
vinced that the aversion and antipathy to the Bri­  
tiflicaufe is very general, so general,that the to­  
ries are to be accounted but a very little thing.

T he adJrefles which they have obtained to the  
King and his Generals, when their army was in  
Bolton, Newport, New-York, Phifadelphia, Sa­

is very well known, that every art of flattery

LETTER 11,  
, Amaterdum, October 5, 1780,  
8&#x27;“, -  
Your fiest proposition is, “to prove, by  
striking facts, that.an implacable hatred snd  
aversion reigns throughout America,”  
- In gmewer to this, | beg.lw&#x27;h  
the Americans are animated by higher prine  
ciples,and Letter and stronger motives thun  
hatred and aversion. They unversaily aspire  
after a free trade with all the commercial  
world, insteardl of that tiean monopoly, in  
which they were shuckled by Great-Britsing  
to the disgrace and mprtification of America,  
and to the injury of all the rest of Europe ;  
to whom it seems as if God and nature intend~  
cd that so great a magueine of productions,  
the raw materiais of manufactures, so greatu  
source of commerce, shd 8o rich a nursery  
of scamen, as America is, should be open.  
They despise, Siry they disdain the idea of  
being again monopolized by any ohe nation  
whatsoever : and this contempt is at least as  
powerful a motive of action as any hatred  
whatsoever. :  
Morcover, Siry, they consider thémseclves  
contending for the purest principles of lib­  
crty, civil and religious ; for those forms of  
government uncer the faith of which their  
country was planted ; and for those great in­  
provements of them which have been made  
by their new constitutions. They censider  
themselves not only as contending for these  
great blessings, but against the greatest evils  
that an‘y country ever suffered ; for they  
know,if they were to be deceived by Eng­  
land, to break their unicn among themselves,  
and their faith with their allies, they would  
| ever after be in the power of England, who  
would bring them into the most abject sub­  
mission to the government of a Parliament,  
the most corrupted in the world, in whic)  
they would have no voice nor influence,  
at three thousand miles distance from  
them.  
But if hatred must come into considera­  
tion, I kmow not how to prove their hutred  
better than by shewing the provocations they  
have had to hatred.  
If tearing up from the foundation those  
formis of government under which they wer  
born and educated, and thrived and prosper­  
cd, to the infinite emolument of England ;.  
if imposing taxes upun them, or endeavour.  
ing to do it, for twenty years, without theis  
consent j—ifl commencing hostilities upor  
them—burning their toWns—=butchering thei  
: rcoplc-dcllberately; snrvlﬁ prisoners——rav.  
shing their women—~exciting bosts of In.  
dians to butcher.and scalp them, and purchas.  
ing Germans to destroy them, and pﬁlng_ ne.  
gro servants o murder their masters j~if all  
these, and many other things as bad, are no  
provocations enough to hatred, I would re.  
quest Mr. Kalkoen to tell me what is or can  
be. All these horrours the English have  
practiced in every part of America, from  
Boston to Savannah, &#x27;  
2. Your second pm’tion is, to shew  
that this is general, at least so general, that  
the Tories are in so small 4 number, and of  
:uch” little force, they are counted as noth­  
ng. &#x27;

I have quoted to you Gen. Howe’s words ;  
and one would think this was sufficient to shew  
hew much or how little zeal there 1s for the  
British cause in North America. When we  
consider, that in the Jel&#x27;iod here mentioned,  
the Englisléfrmy had been in possession of  
the cities of Boston, Newport, New-York and  
Philadelphia, and that they had marched thro’  
the Jersies, part of Maryland, and Pennsyl­  
vania ; and with all their arts, bribes, threats  
and flatteries, which Gen. Howe calls their  
efforts and exertions, they were able to obtain  
so few recruits, and very few of these Amer­  
icans ; I think that any impartial man must  
be convinced that the aversion and antipathy  
to the British cause is very general, so gener­  
al, that the tories are to be accounted but a  
very little thing.  
The addresses which they have obtained  
to the king and his Generals, when their ar­  
my was in Boston, Newport, New-York, Phi­  
ladelphia, Savannah and) Charleston, shew  
the same thing. It iswell known, that every  
art of flattery and of terrdur, was always used  
to obtain subscribersg to these addiesses. - Yet  
the miserable numbers they have obtained,  
and the still more despicable character of  
most of these small numbers, shew that the  
British cause is held in very low esteem.  
Even in Charleston, the capital of a province,  
which contains two hundred thousand whites,  
they were able to obtain only two hundred  
and ten subscribers ; und among; these there  
isnot one name that I ever remember to have  
heard before.  
  
I am sorry I have not Burgoyne’s narra­  
tive ; which shews in the same point of light,  
the resources the English are likely to find in  
the tories, to be nothing more than a sure  
means of getting rid of a great number of  
their guineas.  
  
I have the honour to be,  
Sir,  
  
Your humble servant,  
_ JOHN ADAMS.  
To learn the present state of America, itis  
sufficient to read the publick papers. The  
present state of Great-Britain and its depen­  
dencies may be learned the same way. The  
ompipotence of the British parliament and
