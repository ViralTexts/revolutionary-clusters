The commission, in each case, is computed upon the nett product of the duties on spirits distilled within the jurisdiction of the officer, to whom it is allowed; which nett product is determined by deducting, at each stage of the compensaton, all preceding charges.  
With regard to the ports, the following arrangements have been made: At the ports at which there are both a collector and a surveyor, the latter has been appointed an inspector; where there is a collector only, he has been appointed; and where there is a surveyor only, he has been appointed. The ports at which neither collector nor surveyor resides, have been placed under the inspection of the collector or surveyor of the district to which they belong, as the one or the other is the inspector of the revenue for the port where he resides. The duties of these inspectors are confined to spirits imported from abroad; and, as they bear an analogy to those which they have been accustomed to perform, no compensation has been assigned. The officers, directed by the 18th section of the law to be appointed by the supervisors, have been denominated collectors of the revenue. Their number has been, of necessity, left to the discretion of the supervisor, with these general in
