Mr. Hamilton. To deliver my sentiments on so important a subject, when the first characters in the union have gone before me, inspires me with the greatest diffidence, especially when my own ideas are so materially dissimilar to the plans now before the committee. My situation is disagreeable, but it would be criminal not to come forward on a question of such magnitude. I have well considered the subject, and am convinced that no amendment of the confederation can answer the purpose of a good government, so long as state sovereignties do, in any shape, exist; and I have great doubts whether a national government on the Virginia plan can be made effectual. What is federal? An association of several independent states into one. How or in what manner this association is formed, is not so clearly distinguishable. We find the diet of Germany has in some instances the power of legislation on individuals. We find the United States of America have it in an extensive degree in the cases of piracies.

tates. But on this great question I am still greatly embarrassed. I have before observed my apprehension of the inefficacy of either plan, and I have great doubts whether a more energetic government can pervade this wide and extensive country. I shall now show, that both plans are materially defective.  
1. A good government ought to be constant, and ought to contain an active principle.  
2. Utility and necessity.  
3. An habitual sense of obligation.  
4. Force.  
5. Influence.

ratifying the local objects of the state so as to defeat their concession? And this will ever be the case. Men always love power, and states will prefer their particular concerns to the general welfare; and as the states become large and important, will they not be less attentive to the general government? What, in process of time will Virginia be? She contains now half a million inhabitants—in twenty-five years she will double the number. Feeling her own weight and importance, must she not become indifferent to the concerns of the union? And where, in such a situation, will be found national attachment to the general government?  
By force, I mean the coercion of law and the coercion of arms. Will this remark apply to the power intended to be vested in the government to be instituted by theire plan? A delinquent must be compelled to obedience by force of arms. How is this to be done? If you are unsuccessful, a dissolution of your government must be the consequence; and in that case the individual legislatures will reassume their powers; nay, will not the interest of the states be thrown into the state governments?

, or the Helvetic union, are equally inefficient.  
Such are the lessons which the experience of others affords us, and from whence results the evident conclusion that all federal governments are weak and distracted. To avoid the evils deducible from these observations, we must establish a general and national government, completely sovereign, and annihilate the state distinctions and state operations; and unless we do this, no good purpose can be answered. What does the Jersey plan propose? It surely has not this for its object. By this we grant the regulation of trade and a more effectual collection of the revenue, and some partial duties. These, at five or ten per cent, would only perhaps amount to a fund to discharge the debt of the corporation.

ss. I foresee the difficulty on a consolidated plan of drawing a representation from so extensive a continent to one place. What can be the inducements for gentlemen to come 600 miles to a national legislature? The expense would at least amount to £100,000. This however can be no conclusive objection if it eventuates in an extinction of state governments. The burthen of the latter would be saved, and the expense then would not be great. State distinctions would be found unnecessary, and yet I confess, to carry government to the extremities, the state governments reduced to corporations, and with very limited powers, might be necessary, and the expense of the national government become less burthensome.  
Yet, I confess, I see great difficulty of drawing forth a good representation. What, for example, will be the inducements for gentlemen of fortune and abilities to leave their houses and business to attend annually and long? It cannot be the wages; for these, I presume, must be small. Will not the power, therefore, be thrown into the hands of the demagogue or middling politician, who, for the sake of a small stipend and the hopes of advancement, will offer himself as a candidate, and the real men of weight and influence, by remaining at home, add strength to the state governments? I am at a loss to know what must be done; I despair that a republican form of government can remove the difficulties. Whatever may be my opinion, I would hold it however unwise to change that form of government. I believe the British government forms the best model the world ever produced, and such has been its progress in the minds of the many, that this truth gradually gains ground. This government has for its object public strength and individual security. It is said with us to be unattainable. If it was once formed it would maintain itself. All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and well born, the other the mass of the people. The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and however generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true in fact. The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give therefore to the first class a distinct, permanent share in the government. They will check the unsteadiness of the second, and as they cannot receive any advantage by a change, they therefore will ever maintain good government. Can a democratic assembly, who annually revolve in the mass of the people, be supposed steadily to pursue the public good? Nothing but a permanent body can check the imprudence of democracy. Their turbulent and uncontrouling disposition requires checks. The senate of New-York, although chosen for four years, we have found to be inefficient. Will, on the Virginia plan, a continuance of seven years do it? It is admitted, that you cannot have a good executive upon a democratic plan. See the excellency of the British executive. He is placed above temptation. He can have no distinct interests from the public welfare. Nothing short of such an executive can be efficient. The weak side of a republican government is the danger of foreign influence. This is unavoidable, unless it is so constructed as to bring forward its first characters in its support. I am therefore for a general government, yet would wish to go the full length of republican principles.  
  
Let one body of the legislature be constituted during good behaviour or life.  
Let one executive be appointed who dares execute his powers.  
It may be asked is this a republican system? It is strictly so, as long as they remain elective.  
And let me observe, that an executive is less dangerous to the liberties of the people when in office during life, than for seven years.  
It may be said, this constitutes an elective monarchy? Pray, what is a monarchy? May not the governors of the respective states be considered in that light? But by making the executive subject to impeachment, the term monarchy cannot apply. These elective monarchs have produced tumults in Rome, and are equally dangerous to peace in Poland; but this cannot apply to the mode in which I would propose the election. Let electors be appointed in each of the states to elect the executive—(Here Mr. H. produced his plan, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed,) to consist of two branches—and I would give them the unlimited power of passing all laws without exception. The assembly to be elected for three years by the people in districts—the senate to be elected by the electors to be chosen for that purpose by the people, and to remain in office during life. The executive to have the power of negativing all laws—to make war or peace, with the advice of the senate—to make treaties with their advice, but to have the sole direction of all military operations, and to send ambassadors and appoint all military officers, and to pardon all offenders, treason excepted, unless by advice of the senate. On his death or removal, the president of the senate to officiate, with the same powers, until another is elected. Supreme judicial officers to be appointed by the executive and the senate. The legislature to appoint courts in each state, so as to make the state governments unnecessary to it.  
All state laws to be absolutely void which contravene the general laws. An officer to be appointed in each state to have a negative on all state laws. All the militia and the appointment of officers to be under the national government.  
I confess that this plan and that from Virginia are very remote from the idea of the people. Perhaps the Jersey plan is nearest their expectation. But the people are gradually ripening in their opinions of government—they begin to be tired of an excess of democracy—and what even is the Virginia plan, but pork still, with a little change of the sauce

**T believe the British Government forms the best model the  
world ever produced ; aud such has been its progress, in the  
minds of many, that this truth gradually gains ground. This  
Goverument has for its object public strength and additional  
security. It is said, with us, to be unattainable. If it was once  
formed, it would maintain itself. All communities divide them-  
selves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and  
well-bora—the other the mass of the people. The voice of the  
people has been said to be the voice of God ; and, however  
generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not  
true in fact. ‘The people are turbulent; they seldom judge or  
determine right. Give, therefore, the first class a distinct and  
permanent share in the Government ; they will check the uon-  
steadiness of the second : as they cannot receive any advan-  
tage by the change, they, therefore, will ever maintaia a good

&quot;I believe the British Government  
frms the best model the world ever pro­  
duced, and such has been its&#x27; progress in  
the minds of the many, that the truth  
gradually gains ground.&quot; This Govern­  
mentjias for its object public strength and  
individual security. It is said with us to  
  
be unattainable. If jt was once formed  
it would maintain itself All communities  
divide themselves into the few and the  
many. The first ere the rich and the  
veil hern, nnd the other the fnass of tJie  
people. Thc voice ofthe people has been  
said lo&#x27; be the voice of God; and however  
generally this maxim has been quoted  
and believed, it is not true in fact. The  
people nre turbulent and changing; they  
seldom judge or determine- right. Give  
therefore to the first class a distinct, per­  
manent share in the government. They  
will check the unsteadiness of the second,  
and as they cannot receive any advantage  
ty a change, they therefore will ever  
maintain good government. Can a dem -J  
ocralic assembly, who annually revolve  
in the ma33 of the people, bo supposed  
steadily to pursue the public good ? No  
thing nut a permanent body can check the  
imprudence of democracy. Their turbu­

checks; The .Senate of New York, nl­  
though chosen for foup years, we have  
found to be inefficient. Wilson the Vir

have a good Executive upon a democratic  
plan. See the excellency of the British  
Executive. He is placed above tempta­

the public welfare. Nothing short of

&quot;My situation is disagreeable, but it would  
be criminal not to come forward on a ques­  
tion of such magnitude. I have well con­  
sidered the subject, and am convinced that  
no amendment of the Confederation can an­  
swer the purpose of a good Government so  
Jon as STATEI SOVEREIGNTIES DO,  
LANY SHAPE EXIST.  
Again, on the same occasion, he declared:  
I BELIEVE THE BRITISH GOV­  
ERNMENT FORMS THE BEST MO­  
DEL the WORLD ever PRODUCED,  
and such has been its progress in the minds of  
the many that this truth gradually gains ground.  
This Government has for its object public  
strength and individual security. It is said  
with us to be unattainable. If it was once  
formed, it would maintain itself. AH com­  
munities divide themselves into the few and  
the many. The first are the rich and well­  
born, the other the mass of the people. The  
voice of the people has been said to be the  
voice of God; and however generally this  
maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not  
true in fact. THE PEOPLE ARE TUR­  
BULENT AND CHANGING ; THEY  
SELDOM JUDGE OR DETERMINE  
RIGHT. Give, therefore, to the first class, a  
distinct permanent share in the Government.  
The will check the unsteadiness of the se­  
cond; and as they caunot receive any advan­  
tage by a change, they therefore will ever  
tnaiutaiu a good government. Can a Demo­  
cratic Assembly, who annually revolve in the  
  
mass ot tho people, he supposed steadily to  
pursue the public good? Nothing but a per­  
manent body can check the imprudence of  
Democracy. Their turbulent uucontrolling  
disposition requires checks. The Senate of  
IVew-York, although chosen for four years,  
we have found to be inefficient. Will, on  
the Virginia plan, a continuance of seven  
years do it! It is admitted that you cannot  
have a good executive upon a democratic plan.  
See the excellency of the British executive.  
He is placed above temptation he can have  
no distinct interests from the public welfare.  
NOTHING SHORT OF SUCH AN  
EXECUTIVE CAN BE EFFICIENT.  
And in the same speech, proceeding to give  
his plan of Government, he said:  
&quot;Let one body of the legislature be con­  
stituted during good behaviour OR. LIFE.  
&quot;Let one executive be appointed who dares  
to execute his powers.  
&quot;It may be aske d, is this a republican sys­  
tem? It is strictly so, as long as they remain  
elective.&#x27;  
&quot;And let me observe, that an executive is  
less dangerous to the liberties of the &quot; people  
when in office during life than for seven  
years.  
&quot;It may be said this constitutes an elective  
monarchy. Pray, what is a monarchy?  
May not the Governors of the several States  
be considered ia that light? But, by making  
the executive subject to impeachment, the  
term monarchy cannot apply- These elec­  
tive monarchs have produced tumults in  
Rome, and are equally dangerous to peace in  
Polaud; but this cannot apply to the mode in  
which I would propose the election. Let  
electors be appointed in each of the States to  
elect the executive Here Mr. II. produced  
his planj to consist of two branches; and I  
would give them the unlimited power of pass­  
ing all laws without exception. The assem­  
bly to be elected for three years, by the peo­  
ple, in districts. The Senate to be elected  
by electors to be chosen for that purpose by  
the people. &amp;. to remain in office DURING  
  
LIFE. The executive to have the power of  
  
negativing all laws; to make war or peace,  
with the advice of the senate; to make treaties  
  
with their advice, but to have the sole direc  
  
tion of all military operations, and to send  
ambassadors and appoint all military officers,  
and to pardon all offenders, treason excepted,  
unless bv advice of the senate. On his death  
  
or removal, the president of the senate to offi  
  
ciate, with the same powers, until another is  
elected. Supreme judicial officers to be ap  
  
pointed by the executivex and the senate  
  
The legislature to appoint courts in each  
  
State, so as 4 make the State, Government  
  
ittmeces.y to it, -x  
  
upt State laws to be absolutely void which  
  
cpiitravene the general laws. AN Orrl­  
CER TO BE APPOINTED IN EACH  
  
&amp;TATE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE ON  
  
ALL STATE LAWS. AH the militia and  
  
tiie appointment of officers to be under the

 and too fickle and unstable to

the English Government, with its Bank controlling the  
currency of the country, and its schemes of stock-job-  
bing, funding, &amp;c., odious in every point of view, and  
calculated to grind to the dust the laborer, and exalt and  
enrich the capitalist and speculator— Hamilton thought  
the English Government, with all of its inequalities in  
point of rights and privileges, the best that the wit of  
man ever devised. But let him speak for himself and  
party. In the debate on the adoption of the Constitu-  
tion, he said: “I believe the British Government forms  
| the best model the world ever produced.’ In the same  
debate, he said: ‘All communities divide themselves

well-born; the other, the mass of the people. The peo-  
ple are turbulent and changing. They seldom judge or

check the unsteadiness of the second; and, as they can-  
not receive any advantage from a change, they (the

After reading his plan, he concludes  
his speech, according to the report of  
Yates, in the following terms :—“ I  
confess that this plan, and that from  
Virginia, are very remote from the  
ideas of the people. Perhaps the Jer-  
sey plan is nearest their expectation.  
But the people are gradually ripening  
in their ideas of government. They  
begin to be tired of an excess of de-

ginian plan, but pork stil, with a little  
change of the sauce ?

counteracted by such a complete sovereignty in the general

passions on its side. To this end, he would have abolished  
the State governments altogether, providing an effectual  
substitute in a machinery of local self-government—“ corpora-  
tions for local purposes”—and making the Central Govern-  
ment less democratic by appointing a President and Senate  
for life.&#x27; .Hamilton had no expectation that his plan would  
be preferred to the others; indeed, he confessed that it  
was “very remote from the idea of the people.” But then,  
he added, the Virginia plan shared in this disadvantage ;  
and, though the New Jersey plan might be more favoured at  
that moment, the people were “gradually ripening in their  
opinions of government,” and beginning “to be tired of an

of others affords us, and from whence results the evident con-  
clusion that all federal governments are weak and distracted.  
To avoid the evils deducible from these observations, we must  
establish a general and national government, completely sove-  
reign, and annihilate the state distinctions and state operations ;  
and unless we do this, no good purpose can be answered. He  
afterward explained that he would not destroy the states, but he  
would make the national government able to support itself with-  
out the aid or interference of state governments, and that there-  
fore it was necessary to have full sovereignty. Even with cor-  
porate rights, the states will be dangerous to the national govern-  
ment, and ought to be modified or reduced to a smaller scale.  
Such was the general view of Hamilton as to the kind of gov-  
ernment the convention ought to make; and he further sai

the contest was between a national arlsto­  
cratie form of government and a federal nnloa  
of equal states, with &quot;sll power Inherent in the  
people&#x27;&#x27; o&#x27; each state. On tbis suojecr, on  
June 18, 1787, Mr. Hamilton said: We must  
establish a general and national government,  
and annihilate the state distinctions and  
state operations ; and unless we do tnis, no  
good purpose can be answered. ... I fore­  
see the difficulty on a consolidated  
plan ef drawing a representation from  
so extensive a continent to one place. . . .  
This, however, can be no conclusive objection,  
if It geventualea 1a sn extinction of state  
governments. ... I believe the British  
government forms the best model the world  
ever produced, and such has been Its progress  
In the minds ol many, that this truth gradu­  
ally gains ground. This government has for  
Its object public strength and individual se­  
curity. It la said With us to be unattainable.  
If It was once formed It would maintain itself.  
All communities divide themselves Into the  
Jew and the many. The first are the rich and  
well born, the others the mass of the people.  
... Can a democratic assembly, who an­  
nually revolve In the mass otlhe people, be  
supposed steadily to pursue the pu lie good?  
Noinlng bat a permanent body can check: the  
Imprudence of democracy. &#x27;Iber turbulent and

tive be appointed for life who dares execute  
kls powers. . . . Ail state laws to be absolutely

AlexAnder HAMilton was the boldest

The voice of the people is said to be the voice of Con, but

These sentiments were uttered at the  
time when the foundation of the present  
form of Government was laid. They were  
entertained by the leaders of a powerful

to the worst abuses of that system. &quot;It is said  
with us,&quot; said he, &quot;to be unattainable. If it  
was once formed it would maintain itself. All  
communities divide themselves into the few  
and the many. The first are the rich and wall  
born; the other the mass of the people. Tho  
voice of the peotle has been said to be the voice  
of God; and however generally this maxim has  
been quoted and believed, it is not true in fact  
The pe ople are turbulent and changing; thay  
seldom judge or determine right. Give, there  
fore, to the first class a distinct, permanent  
share in the Government. They will check the  
unsteadiness of the second, and as they cannot  
receive any advantage by a change, they there  
fore will ever maintain good government. Can  
a democratic assembly, who annually revolve  
in the mass of the people, be supposed steadily  
to bursue the public good? Nothing but a per  
manent body can check the imprudence of de  
mocracy. Their turbulent and uncontrolling  
disposition requires checks.It is ad  
mitted that you cannot have a good Executive  
on the democratic plan. See the excellency of  
  
the British Executive! He is placed above  
temptation; he can have no interests distinct  
from the public welfare. Nothing short of such  
an Executive can be efficient.  Let one  
body of the Logislature be constituted during  
good behavior or life  
Let one Executive be appointed who dares  
execute his powers  
It may be asked, is this a republican system  
It is strictly so as long as they remain elective  
nd let me observe that an Executive is less  
dangerous to the liberties of the people when in  
office during life than for seven years  
Let electors be appointed in each of the

such has been its progress in the minds of  
the many that this truth gradually gains  
ground. This government has for its object  
publio strength and individual security. It  
is said with us to be unattainable If it was  
once formed, it would maintain itself. All  
communities divide themselves into the few  
and many. The first are the rich and well  
born: the other the mass of the people. The  
voice of the people has been said to be the  
voice of God, and however generally this  
maxim has been quoted and believed, it is  
not true in fact. Tho people are turbulent  
and changing; they seldom judge or deter­  
mine right. Give, therefore, to the first  
class a distinct, permanent share in the gov­  
ernment. They will check the unsteadiness  
of the second, and as they cannot receive  
any advantage by a change, they, therefore,  
will ever maintain good government. Can a  
democratic assembly who annually revolve  
in the mass of the people be supposed to  
steadily pursue the publio good? Nothing  
but a permanent body can check the impru­  
dence of democracy. Their turbulent and  
uncontrolling disposition require checks.&quot;  
This declaration of Mr. Hamilton has  
formed the foundation stone of every pplit­  
ical party that has ever existed in the Unite
