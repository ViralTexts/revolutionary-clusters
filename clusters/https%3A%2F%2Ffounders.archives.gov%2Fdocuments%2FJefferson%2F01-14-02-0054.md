ion of Congress. The principal changes effected are the following:  
The clauses of the Convention of 1784, cloathing Consuls with the  privileges of the law of Nations, are struck out, and they are expressly subjected, in their persons and property, to the laws of the land.  
That giving the right of Sanctuary to their houses is reduced to a protection of their Chancery room and it’s papers.  
Their coercive powers over passengers are taken away: and over those whom they might have termed deserters of their nation, are restrained to deserted seamen only.  
The clause allowing them to arrest and send back vessels is struck out, and instead of it they are allowed to exercise a police over the ships of their nation generally.  
So is that which declared the indelibility of the character of subject, and the explanation and extension of the 11th. article of the treaty of Amity.  
The innovations in the Laws of evidence are done away.  
And the Convention is limited to 12. years duration.

o. 5. the copy of a translation which I have put into their hands, with a request that, if they find any passages in which the sense of the original is not faithfully rendered they will point them out to me. Otherwise we may consider it as having their approbation. This, and the Convention of 1784. (marked No. 1.) are placed side by side so as to present to the  eye, with less trouble, the changes made; and I inclose a number of printed copies of them for the use of the members who will have to decide on the ratification. It is desireable that the ratification should be sent here for exchange as soon as possible.  
With respect to the Consular appointments, it is a duty on me to add some observations which my situation here has enabled me to make. I think it was in the Spring of 1784. that Congress (harrassed by multiplied applications from foreigners, of whom nothing was known but on their own information, or on that of others as unknown as themselves) came to a resolution that the interest of America would not permit the naming any person, not a citizen, to the office of Consul, vice consul, agent, or commissary. This was intended as a general answer to that swarm of foreign pretenders. It appears to me that it will be best still to preserve a part of this regulation. Native citizens, on several valuable accounts, are preferable to Aliens, and to citizens alien-born. They possess our language, know our laws, customs, and commerce, have generally acquaintance in the U. S. give better satisfaction, and are more to be relied on in point of fidelity. Their disadvantages are, an imperfect acquaintance with the language of this country, and an ignorance of the organisation of it’s judicial and executive powers, and consequent awkwardness whenever application to either of these is necessary, as it frequently is. But it happens that in some of the principal ports of France there is not a single

 office, without protecting our commerce. To avail ourselves of our good native citizens, when we have one in a port, and, when there are none, to have yet some person to attend to our affairs, it appears to me adviseable to declare, by a standing law, that no person but a native citizen shall be capable of the office of Consul; and that the Consul’s presence in his port should suspend for the time the functions of the Viceconsul. This is the rule of 1784. restrained to the office of Consul and to native citizens. The establishing this by a standing law will guard against the effect of particular applications, and will shut the door against such applications, which will otherwise be numerous. This done, the office of Viceconsul may be given to the best subject in the port whether citizen or alien and that of Consul be kept open for any native citizen of superior qualifications, who might come afterwards to establish themselves in the port. The functions of the Viceconsul would become dormant during the presence of his principal, come into activity again on his departure, and thus spare us and them the painful

o this that during the presence of the Consul, the Viceconsul would not be merely useless, but would be a valuable counsellor to his principal, new in the office, the language, laws and customs of the country. Every Consul and viceconsul should be restrained in his jurisdiction to the port for which he is named and the territory nearer to that than to any other Consular or Viceconsular port, and no idea permitted to arise that the grade of consul gives a right to any authority whatever over a viceconsul, or draws on any dependance.

by Congress, Jefferson concisely stated as follows the principal  
changes that had been made in the draft of 1784:  
  
The clauses of the convention of 1784, clothing consuls with the  
privileges of the law of nations, are struck out and they are expressly  
subjected, in their persons and property, to the laws of the land ;  
  
That giving the right of sanctuary to their houses is reduced toa  
protection of their chancery room and its papers};  
  
Their coercive powers over passengers are taken away, and over  
those whom they might have termed deserters of their nation are
