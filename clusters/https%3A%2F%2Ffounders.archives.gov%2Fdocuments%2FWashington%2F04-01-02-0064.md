At present I see but little prospect of such a voyage, the deranged situation of my private concerns, occasioned by an absence of almost nine years, and an entire disregard of all private business during that period, will not only suspend, but may put it forever out of my power to gratify this wish. This not being the case with you, come with Madame la Fayette &amp; view me in my domestic walks—I have often told you, &amp; I repeat it again, that no man could receive you in them with more friendship &amp; affection than I should do; in which I am sure Mrs Washington would cordially join me. We unite in respectful compliments to your Lady, &amp; best wishes for your little flock. With every sentiment of esteem, Admiration &amp; Love, I am, My Dr Marqs Your Most Affecte friend

the Potomac, under the shadow of my  
own vine and fig-tree, free from the bus  
tle of a camp; and the busy scenes of

soldier, who is ever in put suit of fame;  
the statesman, whose watchful days and  
sleepless nights&#x27; are&quot; spent in deving  
schemes to promote the welfare of his

ways watching the countenance of hii  
prince, in hopes of catching a gracioui  
smile,; can have very little conception.  
Iam not only retired from all public  
employments, but I am retiring within  
myself. I shall be able to resume &#x27;the  
solitary walk, and tread the paths of  
private life with heart-felt satisfaction:  
envious of none, I am determined to be  
pleased with all, and this, my dear friend,

gently down the stream of life, until I

most sincerely my dear marquis, for  
your kind invitation to your&#x27; house if I

but little prospect of such a voyage; the  
deranged situation of my private affain

bligo me to suspend, but perhaps forever  
hinder me from gratifying this wish.  
This not being the case with you, come  
with Madame Lafayette, and view me  
in my domestic walks. : I have often  
told you, and 1 repeat it again, that no  
I man could receive you in them with
