MonticellO) Nov. 12, 1818.  
The public papers, my dear friend, announ­  
ces the fatal event of which your letter of Octo­  
ber 20th had given me ominous foreboding.—  
Tried myself in the school of affliction, by the  
loss of every form of connexion which can rive  
the human heart, I know well, and feel, what  
you have lost,—what you have suffered,—are  
suffering,—and have yet to endure. The same  
trials have taught me that for ills so immeasu­  
rable, time and silence are the only medicines.  
I will not therefore, by useless condolences, o­  
pen afresh the sluices of your grief, nor, altho,  
mingling sincerely my tears with yours, will I  
say a word more, when words are vain; but this  
is of some comfort to us both, that the term is  
not very distant, at which we are to deposit, in  
the same cerement, our sorrows and our suffer­  
ing bodies; and to ascend in essence, to an ecsta­  
tic meeting with the friends we loved and lost;  
and whom we shall still love and never lose a­  
gain. God bless you and support you under  
your heavy affliction.

The public papers, my dear friend, an  
nounce the fatal event of which your let­  
ter of October the 20th had given me  
ominous foreboding. Tried myself in the  
school of affliction, by the loss of every  
form of connection which can rive the hu-  
man heart, I know well, and feel what  
you have lost, what you are suffering  
and have yet to endure. The same trials  
have taught me that for ills so immeasura  
ble, time and silence are the only medi  
cine. I will not, therefore, by useless  
condolence open afresh the sluices of  
your grief, nor, mingling sincerely my  
tears with yours, will I say a word where  
words are vain; but that it is some com­  
fort to us both, that the time is not far  
distant, at which we are to deposit in the  
same cerement our own sorrow and suf­  
fering bodies, and to ascend in essence  
to an ecstatatic meeting with the friends  
we have loved and lost, and whom we  
shall still love and never lose again.  
God bless you and support you under  
your heavy affliction.
