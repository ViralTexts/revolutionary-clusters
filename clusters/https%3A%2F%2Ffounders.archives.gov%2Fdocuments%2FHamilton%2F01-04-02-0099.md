as to the wisdom or necessity of secret sessions for other

treaties, and the discussion of them, should in many cases  
be kept in the confidence of those charged with conclud-

_ There was much debate in the Constitutional conven-

Mr. Randolph’s plan gave to the President, with the  
advice and approbation of the Senate, the power of mak-  
ing all treaties. Mr. Pinckney’s plan gave to the Senate  
“the sole and exclusive power to declare war, and to  
make treaties.’’ The Committee of Detail recommended  
that ‘‘the Senate of the United States shall have power  
to make treaties, and to appoint ambassadors,” etc. At  
a later day Mr. Madison proposed that the Senate should
