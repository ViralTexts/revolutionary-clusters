[Newport, R.I., 18 August 1790]  
  
While I receive, with much satisfaction, your Address replete with expressions of affection and esteem; I rejoice in the opportunity  
  
of assuring you, that I shall always retain a grateful remembrance of the cordial welcome I experienced in my visit to Newport, from all classes of Citizens.  
The reflection on the days of difficulty and danger which are past is rendered the more sweet, from a consciousness that they are succeeded by days of uncommon prosperity and security. If we have wisdom to make the best use of the advantages with which we are now favored, we cannot fail, under the just administration of a good Government, to become a great and a happy people.  
The Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.  
It would be inconsistent with the frankness of my character not to avow that I am pleased with your favorable opinion of my Administration, and fervent wishes for my felicity. May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid. May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful here, and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy.

To tin&#x27; Hebrew Conr/rei/ation in Newport,  
Rhode Island:  
Gentlemen:—While I receive with much  
satisfaction your address,replete with expres­  
sions of affection and esteem, I rejoice in  
the opportunity of assuring you, that I shall  
always retain a grateful remembrance of the  
cordial welcome I experienced in my visit to  
Newport, from all classes of citizens.  
The reflection on the days of difficulty  
and danger which are past, is rendered the  
more sweet from a consciousness that they  
are succeeded by days of uncommon pros­  
perity and security. If wo have wisdom to  
make the best use of the advantages with  
which we are now favored, wo cannot fail,  
under the just administration of a good  
government, to become a great and happy  
people.  
The citizens of the United States of Ame­  
rica, have a right to applaud themselves for  
having given to mankind examples of an en­  
lightened and liberal policy—a policy wor­  
thy of imitation. All possess alike liberty  
of conscience and immunities of citizenship.  
It is now no more that toleration is spoken  
of, as if it was by the indulgence of one  
class of people that another enjoy the exer­  
cise of their inherent natural rights. For,  
happily, the government of the United States,  
which gives to bigotry no sanction, to perse­  
cution no assistance, requires only that they  
who live under its protection, should demean  
themselves ns good citizens, in giving it on  
all occasions their effectual support.  
It would be inconsistent with the frank­  
ness of my character not to avow, that I am  
pleased with your favorable opinion of my  
administration and fervent wishes for my  
felicitv. May the children of the stock of  
Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue  
to merit and enjoy the good will of the oth­  
er inhabitants—while every one shall sit in  
safely under his own vine and figlree, and  
there shall be none to make him afraid.  
May the Father of all mercies scatter light,  
and not darkness, in our paths, and make us  
all, in our several vocations, useful hare, and,  
in his own duo time ami way, everlastingly  
happy. (L S.) Geokoe Washington
