n 1828 and has since disappeared, but of which a transcript is extant. The copy was headed 1776, contained the explanatory sentence and text from the Evening Post, and concluded with a note by Jefferson that there was reason to think the inscription “was written by Dr. Franklin, in whose hand [hands?] it was first seen.” Whether this attribution was correct must remain an open question; even if the paper Jefferson saw was in the Doctor’s hand, rather than hands, Franklin might have copied it. He was certainly struck by it, for he made it the last line of the motto for his proposed great seal of the United States.  
STRANGER,  
Ere thou pass, contemplate this CANNON,  
Nor regardless be told  
That near its base lies deposited the dust of  
JOHN BRADSHAW,  
Who, nobly superior to all selfish regards,  
Despising alike the pagentry of courtly splendor,  
The blast of calumny, and the terrors of royal vengeance  
Presided in the illustrious band of heroes and patriots,  
Who fairly and openly adjudged  
CHARLES STUART,  
Tyrant of England,  
To a public and exemplary death,  
Thereby presenting to the amazed world,  
And transmitting down, through applauding ages,  
The most glorious example  
  
Of unshaken virtue, love of freedom, and impartial justice,  
Ever exhibited on the blood-stained theatre of human action.  
O, reader,  
Pass not on till thou hast blessed his memory  
And never - never forget  
THAT REBELLION TO TYRANTS IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD

es. They are  
written over what is called the Regicides’ Cave, West Rock, New Haven,  
Conn. Mr. Hollis, inhis memoirs, mentions that he found the epitaphs at  
length, pasted up on the windows of inns in New England, in the early  
days of our Revolutionary struggle, and states the fact as an evidence  
of the spirit which actuated our forefathers.  
  
The original of the following is engraven upon a cannon, at the sum-  
mit of a steep hill, near Martha Bray, in Jamaica (see Memoirs of Mr.  
Hollis, Vol. II, p. 789), reprinted in Gentleman’s Magazine, XIV, 834:  
  
‘* Stranger, To a public and exemplary death;  
Ere thou pass, contemplate this cannon. Thereby presenting to the amazed world,  
Nor regardless be told And transmitting down through applauding ages,  
That near its base lies deposited the dust The most glorious example  
  
Of JouNn BRADSHAW;  
  
Who, nobly superior to selfish regards,  
Despising alike the pageantry of courtly  
splendour,  
  
The blast of calumny,  
  
And the terrors of royal vengeance,  
  
Of unshaken Virtue,  
Love of Freedom,  
And impartial Justice,  
Ever exhibited on the blood-stained theatre  
Of human actions.  
Oh, Reader, pass not on,
