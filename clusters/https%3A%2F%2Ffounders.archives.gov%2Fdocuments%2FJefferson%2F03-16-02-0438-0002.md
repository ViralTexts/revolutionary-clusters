r Sir,  
New-York, October 1, 1820.  
  
Your attention is respectfully requested to an association of Scholars for the purpose of improving American literature. This association, though yet at its commencement and unknown to the public, has been the subject of an interesting correspondence for some months past; and it is believed will not be deemed unimportant as connected with the best interests of our country.  
To settle at once a point on which some difference might exist, it is not designed, independent of England, to form an American language, farther than as it relates to the numerous and increasing names and terms peculiarly American; but to cultivate a friendly correspondence with any similar association or distinguished individuals in Great Britain, who may be disposed to join us in an exertion to improve our common language.  
The objects of such an institution which directly present themselves, are, to collect and interchange literary intelligence; to guard against local or foreign corruptions, or to correct such as already exist; to settle varying orthography; determine the use of doubtful words and phrases; and, generally, to form and maintain, as far as practicable, an English standard of writing and pronunciation, correct, fixed, and uniform, throughout our extensive territory. Connected with this, and according to future ability, may be such rewards for meritorious productions, and such incentives to improvement, in the language and literature of our country, and in the general system of instruction, as from existing circumstances may become proper.  
These objects will not be thought trifling, by those who have spent much time in the cultivation of literature, or attended to its influence on society. Such persons need not be told how directly they are connected with our progress in general knowledge, or our public reputation; or that their influence may extend from social to national intercourse, and to our commercial prosperity. Perspicuity in language is the basis of all science. The philosophy that professes to teach the knowledge of things, independent of words, needs only to be mentioned among enlightened men to be rejected.  
Most of the European nations have considered the improvement of language as an important national object, and have established academies, with extensive funds and privileges, for that purpose. An interference of the government has, perhaps, been omitted in England, from a singular and rather accidental reliance on the acknowledged superiority of a few leading individuals; and so long as all the literature in the English language had its origin and center in London, there was less danger in thus leaving it to the guidance of chance. Science may be comparatively recluse; but literature is social; and American scholars, spread over 2,000,000 square miles, are not to be drawn to a virtual and national association, without the form.  
It is very properly said of France that its literature has frequently saved the country when its arms have failed. The advantages resulting to that nation, from the exertions of a few academicians, have been incalculable, and may serve to show, in some degree, what such a confederacy of scholars is capable of performing. The effect of their influence was not barely to elevate France in the literary world, and to improve its learning within itself; but to extend their language throughout Europe; to introduce, at the expense of other nations, their books, their opinions, and, in aid of other causes, their political preponderance. The Philological Academies of Italy and Spain, though unaided by the same powerful co-operation, have effected very great improvements in the language and literature of their respective countries. The great work now performing by the German scholars, in addition to what they have before done, is a noble example to other nations, and calculated to elevate the condition of our nature. With how much greater force does every consideration connected with this subject, apply, in a free community, where all depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the great body of the people.  
Without dwelling a moment on invidious comparisons between England and the United States, the time appears to have arrived, in reference to ourselves, when, having acquired a high standing among nations, having succeeded in a fair trial of the practicability and excellence of our civil institutions, our scholars are invited to call their convention and to form the constitution of national literature.  
We have some peculiar advantages in an attempt to establish national uniformity in language. Happily for us, our forefathers came chiefly from that part of England where their language was most correctly spoken, and were possessed of a good degree of intelligence, according to the learning of that time. Though in a country as diversified as ours, there are, from various causes, many particular corruptions, we hardly find any thing that can properly be called a provincial dialect. We have at present no very inveterate habits to correct, where gross barbarisms, through large districts, are to be encountered. The attempt therefore, seasonably and judiciously made, presents a prospect not only of success, but of comparative facility. Our scattered population seem only to want from a competent tribunal, a declaration of what is proper, to guide them in their practice. The present appearances are more favorable than the most sanguine among the projectors of the plan dared to predict. There is the best reason to expect the general concurrence of our distinguished literary men in favor of a measure which promises so many advantages, so nationally important in its principles and effects, and to which so little can be objected. It is deemed unnecessary at present to dwell minutely on the details of the plan, which probably will not be difficult to settle, if the leading principles are generally approved. It is equally useless to enter upon a train of arguments to prove the advantages of such an association under the present circumstances of our country. The commanding influence of literature upon national wealth and power, as well as morals, character, and happiness, especially in free communities, will not be doubted by those whose minds have been most directed to this interesting branch of civil policy. Perhaps there never has been, and never may be, a nation more open to the influence of moral causes, than the American Republic at the present time. In every country truly free, public opinion is in effect the governing law; and public opinion, and all the complicated interests of society, greatly depend on the state of national literature. That independence which is our boast must consist in the proper independence of the mind. Without contemning the experience of past ages, we ought not too slavishly to follow the path of others. It is enough to respect the Europeans as honorable competitors, without regarding them as absolute masters. American ambition should aspire to noble objects, if we mean to rise to excellence: for, besides that the imitator is almost necessarily inferior to his model, the old world can furnish no model suited to the circumstances and character of our country. We are a world by ourselves. Our privileges, resources, and prospects, are of the highest order. Happily exempt from hereditary despotism or bigoted hierarchies, from jealous and powerful bordering nations; the professed advocates of rational freedom, the world may justly claim from us an example worthy of such a situation and such a cause. Our numbers and wealth are greater than those of England were, when the last of her splendid colleges was erected; we may have the learning of Europeans in common stock, with an exemption from their burdens, and the highest eminence which others have attained, ought to be the American starting point in the career of national greatness.  
And is there any thing impossible, or even particularly difficult, in reducing these ideas to practice? Without expecting to render human nature perfect, or to fix an unalterable standard for living language and literature, may there not be some regulation which will place the decisions of the wise in preference to the blunders of the ignorant? When can a more favorable time be expected, to correct the irregularities yearly multiplying upon us, and becoming more and more embodied with the literature of our country? Why should chance be expected to accomplish, what, from its nature, can result only from well-regulated system? It would indeed be imprudent to attempt too much. Sound discretion will point out a middle course between a wild spirit of innovation and a tame acquiescence in obvious error. Language is too important an instrument in human affairs to have its improvement regarded as useless or trifling. Of all the objects of national identity, affection, and pride, national literature is the most laudable, the most operative, and the most enduring. It is to the scholars of antiquity we owe all we know of their statesmen and heroes, and even their distinctive national existence. In the long train of ages their tables of brass have mouldered away, and their high-wrought columns crumbled to dust. Cities have sunk, and their last vestige been lost. The unconscious Turk half-tills the soil manured with decayed sculpture: but the monuments of genius and learning, more durable than marble and brass, remain the subject of undecreasing admiration and delight. The fame to which great minds aspire, is, to soar above the local contentions of the day, and live to after ages in the esteem of their fellow men. The thought of this animates the patriot’s hope and nerves his arm, in danger, toil, and want. Shall it not be the ambition of Americans to proclaim the honor of their benefactors, and transmit the glory of their country to the latest age of the world? We are not here to awe the ignorant by the splendor of royal trappings, but to command the respect of the wise and good by moral greatness. These objects are neither above the capacity, nor beneath the attention, of our countrymen. They are interwoven with our individual happiness, our national character, and our highest interests. When we survey this vast assemblage of States, independent, yet united; competitors in useful improvement, yet members of one great body; the world has never prepared such a theatre for the exhibition of mental and moral excellence: and if the men of all ages, whom we most delight to honor, have made it their chief glory to advance the literature of their respective countries, shall it be degradingly supposed, that, in this favored land, either talents or zeal will be wanting in such a cause? If it is said, that Americans have not paid that attention to education which the subject demanded; it is true; and neither justice nor sound policy requires us to disguise the fact: but has any fatality ordained that the people most interested in diffusing the light of instruction, must be degraded in the republic of letters? Much irritation has been produced by the observations of foreign writers upon the learning and intellect of our countrymen. We ought not to waste time in idle complaint on this subject. Is there not in America enough of genius, of scholarship, and of patriotic spirit, if properly organized and conducted, to raise our literary character above the influence of any combination abroad? Shall our numberless blessings remain an u

nprized possession? Will foreign pens maintain and elevate American character? Is it not time to make a national stand in the moral world, as the expositors of our own principles, the vindicators of our institutions, and, under a Beneficent Providence, the arbiters of the destiny of unborn millions? Even if, contrary to all human expectation, such an association should fail in its objects, would it not justly be said, ‘magnis tamen excidit ausis’?  
It is not intended to bring the society before the public by a premature and unnecessary parade, but to make it known chiefly by its practical good.  
The following is a general outline of the institution alluded to, subject of course to such variations as may be thought to increase the prospect of its utility.  
To be called “THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF LANGUAGE AND BELLES LETTRES.”  
Its prime object is to harmonize and determine the English language; but it will also, according to its discretion and means, embrace every branch of useful and elegant literature, and especially whatever relates to our own country.  
To be located in the city of New-York, where accommodations will be furnished free from expense.  
To commence with fifty members; maximum number, one hundred and twenty. More than that would lessen the credit of membership, and diminish rather than increase its authority.  
Members to be divided into three classes. Resident, who reside in or near New-York; Corresponding, those whose distance prevents their regular attendance; and honorary, those at home or abroad, whom the body may think proper expressly to admit as such: but, perhaps, it will be thought best to make very few honorary members in the United States. The only reason for making a difference between resident and corresponding members, is to give to the latter all practicable privileges and facilities in communicating their opinions, propositions and votes in writing, as a compensation for the difficulties of personal attendance. In questions requiring a ballot, the written opinions and wishes of distant members are taken as votes on all points to which they directly relate. As most of the questions likely to arise will relate to written language, and as few of them will require haste in the decision, there will be a particular fitness in arriving at a general result through the means of the various opinions in writing.  
It will be a standing request, though not absolutely required, that each member shall, within one year after his admission, deliver personally, or by writing, a discourse upon some subject relating to language or general literature, or to the situation and interests of the United States.  
The Society, when organized, will send a respectful communication to such literary gentlemen in the British dominions as may be thought proper, explaining to them the design of the establishment, and inviting their co-operation. Public policy, as well as general convenience will point out to them the importance of improving our language, facilitating its acquisition to foreigners as well as native citizens, and preserving its uniformity throughout the extensive regions where it now does, or hereafter may prevail.  
The Modus Operandi should be the result of the joint wisdom of the body, when formed; but almost every disputed point in language, and in ours they are very numerous, may be made a case, subjected to rule as far as possible, and brought to a decision, endeavoring to have this decision concurrent between the British and ourselves.  
But besides the acknowledged corruptions which prevail in the language of this country, our peculiar institutions and circumstances; our discoveries and improvements, have given rise to a large class of new words, Americanisms, if the critics please; necessary to express new things. To adopt and regulate these is not to alter the English language; but only to supply its deficiencies. This is particularly a work of our own. It is also important that attention should be paid to the numerous names of places, French, Spanish and Aboriginal, which are daily becoming incorporated with our literature, and concerning which so much diversity at present exists.  
The unprofitable disputes among teachers and the authors of elementary books, who are often very unskilful advocates of their opposing systems, and whose arguments tend only to increase a difference which ought not to exist, would be in a great degree obviated. The professors of Rhetoric and Logick, in our best universities, should at least agree in spelling the names of the important sciences they teach. Our numerous youth would then be left free to pursue the straight course to the knowledge of a language which might be, not only strong and copious, but, to a far greater extent, regular and fixed. In addition to other advantages, there cannot be a rational doubt that such an institution may have a beneficial influence in exciting emulation and national concert, in our literature in general, and that many might be drawn to this interesting subject, who are now less profitably and less honorably employed in other pursuits.  
The object here contemplated is certainly of sufficient national importance to merit an adequate fund from the public. Should this fail, it would be improper to lay a burdensome expense on the members. Expenditures to any considerable amount are not considered indispensably necessary; for though individuals may not be able to accomplish all that may be desired, much may be done at a moderate actual expense. Twenty-five dollars at the admission of a member, and two dollars a year afterwards, though trifling to some, is considered enough to impose by any imperative rule.  
The only objections which have been made to the proposed plan, are on the ground of its practicability. The difficulties alleged are, the superiority of the British in literature; the contempt with which they will look on our institutions and offers of correspondence; the prejudices of our own people in their favor, and the consequent necessity of waiting for them to lead the way. These difficulties, if correct to the extent that some of our citizens seem inclined to admit, show at least the necessity of trying to produce a favorable change. If in literature and science we are greatly inferior to any other people, it is not because we are deficient in natural, political, or moral advantages, or have not as strong reasons as any nation ever had to encourage letters; but because we have hitherto neglected any general or systematic means for their advancement. The arguments are fallacious which attempt to find in the circumstances or dispositions of our people any disqualification for the highest mental attainments. American genius and enterprise properly directed, may as well be displayed in the highest walks of literature and science as in any thing else. One difficulty is our scholars, as such, have very little intercourse, and have too long been strangers to each other. Homo solus imbecilis. Concert will excite a generous emulation. This, upon the plan proposed, will operate upon a vast and highly reputable field; it will be identified with the national character and the dearest interests of a great and rising people, and cannot fail to produce excellence and command patronage and respect. The bare circumstance of exciting attention to the subject is an important point gained. ‘Aude et faciat.’ A colonial servility in literature is as unworthy of our country as political dependence. The necessary limits of this letter forbid a course of reasoning upon the subject: it may be thought proper to give a fuller exposition in a pamphlet form. The general principles explained above are deemed sufficient as the basis of preparatory arrangement.  
Among the respectable persons consulted respecting the proposed institution, the sentiment, as far as ascertained, is very general and zealous in its favor. It is designed to carry it into effect with as little delay as sound discretion, in reference to character and advantageous arrangements for a favorable commencement will admit.  
The constitution formed for the Society is purposely a very short one, intended chiefly as the basis for a commencement. A body of scholars, associated for the laudable object of promoting the literature of their country, many of them very familiar with public proceedings, will need fewer legal rules than a bank or a state. Whatever may be the deficiencies of this constitution, experience will be more competent to supply them than any wisdom of anticipation.  
From the peculiar circumstances of our country, the institution will have no guide in any thing which has gone before; but liberal criticism will make some allowance for the difficulties necessarily attendant on first attempts. The same regular progress will not be expected in an untrodden field as on a well travelled road; but in pursuing a noble object with good intention, there is the consolation that those best qualified to judge are least inclined to condemn. If our beginning is a small one, so was that of the Royal Society of London; and we can have no reason to dread more obloquy from the illiberal, than they received.  
Very generous subscriptions, by a number of gentlemen who are not expected to be members, are volunteered, pro patria, and there is an encouraging prospect for funds. If among the variety of character in our country, there is a portion too ignorant, or too grovelling, to depart from their own narrow views of immediate gain, it is hoped that, among ten millions of people, there are enough possessed of talent to estimate, and spirit to maintain, an institution whose aim is to promote the best interests and lasting honor of the United States. In such a cause it is deemed unnecessary for the institution to solicit pecuniary aid, farther than by a fair exposition of its principles and objects. The subscriptions are to be a free-will offering upon the altar of our country: yet it will be no less creditable to the society, than just in itself, to hold in grateful remembrance and transmit to future generations, the names of those generous citizens who, by their donations, become at once, the patrons of learning and the vindicators of the American name. It may be one of the good effects of this society to bring patriotic generosity more into fashion, by causing it to be more honored.  
  
In behalf of the Association, Sir, I have the honor to be, Very respectfully and truly yours,  
WILLIAM S. CARDELL

association, though yet at its commencement, and unknown to the  
public, has been the subject of an interesting correspondence for  
some months past; and it is believed will not be deemed unim-  
portant as connected with the best interests of our country.  
  
To setile at once a point on which some difference might exist,  
it is not designed, independent of England, to form an American  
language, farther than as it relates to the numerous and increasing  
names and terms peculiarly American; but to cultivate a friendly  
correspondence with any similar association or distinguished in-  
dividuals in Great Britain, who may be disposed to join us in an  
exertion to improve our common language.  
  
The objects of such an institution which directly present them-  
selves, are, to collect and interchange literary intelligence; to  
guard against local or foreign corruptions, or to correct such as  
already exist; to settle varying orthography; determine the use of  
doubtful words and phrases; and, generally, to form and maintain,  
as far as practicable, an English standard of writing and pronun-  
ciation, correct, fixed, and uniform, throughout our extensive ter-  
ritory. Connected with this, and according to future ability, may  
be such rewards for meritorious productions, and such incentives  
to improvement, in the language and literature of our country, and  
in the general system of instruction, as from existing circum-  
stances may become proper.  
  
These objects will not be thought trifling, by those who have  
spent much time in the cultivation of literature, or attended to its  
influence on society. Such persons need not be told how directly  
they are connected with our progress in general knowledge, or our  
public reputation; or that their influence may extend from social  
to national intercourse, and to our commercial prosperity. Per-  
spicuity in language is the basis of all science. The philosophy  
that professes to teach the knowledge of things, independent of  
words, needs only to be mentioned among enlightened men to be  
rejected.  
  
Most of the European nations have considered the improvement  
of language as an important national object, and have established  
academies, with extensive funds and privileges, for that purpose.  
An interference of the government has, perhaps, been omitted in  
England, from a singular and rather accidental reliance on the

acknowledged superiority of a few leading individuals; and so long  
as all the literature in the English language had its origin and  
centre in London, there was less danger in thus leaving it to,the  
guidance of chance. Science may be comparatively recluse; but  
literature is social; and American scholars, spread over 2,000,000  
square miles, are not to be drawn to a virtual and national asso-  
ciation, without the form.  
  
It is very properly said of France that its literature has fre-  
quently saved the country when its arms have failed. The advan-  
tages resulting to that nation, from the exertions of a few acade-  
micians, have been incalculable, and may serve to show, in some  
  
degree, what such a confederacy of scholars is capable of perform-,  
  
ing. The effect of their influence was not barely to elevate France  
in the literary world, and to improve its learning within itself, but  
to extend their language throughout Europe; to introduce, at the  
expense of other nations, their books, their opinions, and, in aid  
of other causes, their political preponderance. The Philological  
Academies of Italy and Spain, though unaided by the same pow-  
erful co-operation, have effected very great improvements in the  
language and literature of their respective countries. The great  
work now performing by the German scholars, in addition to what  
they have before done, is a noble example to other nations, and  
calculated to elevate the condition of our nature. With how much  
greater force does every consideration connected with this subject,  
apply, in a free community, where all depends upon the virtue and  
intelligence of the great body of the people.  
  
Without dwelling a moment on invidious comparisons between  
England and the United States, the time appears to have arrived,  
in reference to ourselves, when, having acquired a high standing  
among nations, having succeeded in a fair trial of the practicability  
and excellence of our civil institutions, our scholars are invited  
to call their convention, and to form the constitution of national  
literature. ,  
  
We have some peculiar advantages in an attempt to establish  
national uniformity in language. Happily for us, our forefathers  
came chiefly from that part of England where their language was  
most correctly spoken, and were possessed of a good degree of

country as diversified as ours, there are, from various causes, many  
particular corruptions, we hardly find any thing that can properly  
be called a provincial dialect. We have at present no very invet-  
erate habits to correct, where gross barbarisms, through large dis-  
tricts, are to be encountered. The attempt, therefore, seasonably  
and judiciously made, presents a prospect not only of success, but  
of comparative facility. Our scattered population seem only to  
want, from a competent tribunal, a declaration of what is proper,  
to guide them in their practice. The present appearances are  
more favourable than the most sanguine among the projectors of  
the plan dared to predict. ‘There is the best reason to expect the  
general concurrence of our distinguished literary men in favour of  
a measure which promises so many advantages, so nationally im-  
portant in its principles and effects, and to which so little can be  
objected. It is deemed unnecessary, at present, to dwell minutely  
on the details of the plan, which probably will not be difficult to  
settle, if the leading principles are generally approved. It is  
equally useless to enter upon a train of arguments to prove the  
advantages of such an association under the present circumstances  
of our country. The commanding influence of literature upon na-  
tional wealth and power, as well as morals, character, and happi-  
ness, especially in free communities, will not be doubted by those  
whose minds have been most directed to this interesting branch of  
civil policy. Perhaps there never has been, and never may be, a  
nation more open to the influence of moral causes, than the Ameri-  
can republic at the present time. In every country truly free,  
public opinion is in effect the governing law; and public opinion,  
and all the complicated interests of society, greatly depend on the  
state of national literature. That independence which is otfr boast  
must consist in the proper independence of the mind. Without  
contemning the experience of past ages, we ought not too slavishly  
to follow the path of others. It is enough to respect the Euro-  
peans as honourable competitors, without regarding them as abso-  
lute masters. American ambition should aspire to noble objects,  
if we mean to rise to excellence: for, besides that the imitator is  
almost necessarily inferior to his model, the old world can fur-  
nish no model suited to the circumstances and character of our  
country. We are a world by ourselves. Our privileges, resources,

and prospects, are of the highest order. Happily exempt from  
hereditary despotism, or bigoted hierarchies, from jealous and pow-  
erful bordering nations; professed advocates of rational freedom,  
as we are, the world may justly claim from us an example worthy  
of such a situation and such a cause. Our numbers and wealth are  
greater than those of England were, when the last of her splendid  
colleges was erected: we may have the learning of Europeans in  
common stock, with an exemption from their burdens; and the  
highest eminence which others have attained, ought to be the  
American starting point in the career of national greatness.  
  
And is there any thing impossible, or even particularly difficalt,  
in reducing these ideas to practice? Without expecting to render  
human nature perfect, or to fix an unalterable standard for living  
language and literature, may there not be some regulation which  
will place the decisions of the wise in preference to the blunders  
of the ignorant? When can a more favourable time be expected, to  
correct the irregularities yearly multiplying upon us, and becoming  
  
more and more embodied with the literature of our country? Why .  
  
should chance be expected to accomplish, what, from its nature,  
can result only from well-regulated system? It would indeed be  
imprudent to attempt too much. Sound discretion will point out a  
middle course between a wild spirit of innovation and a tame ac-  
quiescence in obvious error. Language is too important an instru-  
ment in human affairs to have its improvement regarded as useless  
or trifling. Of all the objects of national identity, affection, and  
pride, national literature is the most laudable, the most operative,  
and the most enduring. It is to the scholars of antiquity we owe  
all we know of their statesmen and heroes, and even their dis-  
tinctive national existence. In the long train of ages their tables  
of brass have mouldered away, and their high-wrought columns  
crumbled to dust. Cities have sunk, and their last vestige been  
lost. The unconscious Turk half-tills the soil manured with de-  
cayed sculpture: but the monuments of genius and learning, more  
durable than marble and brass, remain the subject of undecreasing  
admiration and delight. The fame to which great minds aspire,  
is, to soar above the local contentions of the day, and live to after  
ages in the esteem of their fellow men. The thought of this ani,  
mates the patriot’s hope, and nerves his arm in danger, toil, and

ment, and inviting their co-operation. Public policy will unite  
with general convenience in pointing out to them the importance  
of improving our language, faciliating its acquisition to foreigners  
as well as native citizens, and preserving its uniformity through-  
out the extensive regions where it now does, or hereafter may  
prevail.  
  
The Modus Operandi should be the result of the joint wisdom  
of the body, when formed; but almost every disputed point in lan-  
  
guage, and in ours they are very numerous, may be made a casg,  
  
subjected to rule as far as possible, and brought to a decision, en-  
deavouring to have this decision concurrent between the British  
and ourselves.  
  
But besides the acknowledged corruptions which prevail in the  
language of this country, our peculiar institutions and circum-  
stances; our discoveries and improvements, have given rise to a  
large class of new words, Americanisms, if the critics please; ne-  
cessary to express new things. To adopt and regulate these is not  
to alter the English language; but only to supply its deficiencies.  
This is particularly a work of our own. It is also important that  
attention should be paid to the numerous names of places, French,  
Spanish, and Aboriginal, which are daily becoming incorporated  
with our literature, and concerning which so much diversity at  
present exists.  
  
The unprofitable disputes among teachers and the authors of  
elementary books, who are often very unskilful- advocates of their  
opposing systems, and whose arguments tend only to increase a  
difference which ought not to exist, would be in a great degree  
obviated. The professors of Rugroric and Loaio, in our best  
universities, should at least agree in spelling the names of the  
important sciences they teach. Our numerous youth would then  
be left free to pursue the straight course to the knowledge of a  
language which might be, not only strong and copious, but, to a far  
greater extent, regular and fixed. In addition to other advan-  
tages, there cannot be a rational doubt that such an institution  
may have a beneficial influence in exciting emulation and national  
concert in our literature in general, and that many might be drawn  
to this interesting subject, who are now less ‘profitably and less  
honorably employed in other pursuits.

The object here contemplated, is, certainly, of sufficient na-  
tional importance to merit an adequate fund from the public.  
Should this fail, it would be improper to lay a burdensome expense  
on the members. Expenditures to any considerable amount are  
not considered indispensably necessary; for though individuals  
may not be able to accomplish all that may be desired, much may  
be done at a moderate actual expense. Twenty-five dollars at the  
admission of a member, and two dollars a year afterwards, though  
trifling to some, is considered enough to impose by any imperative  
rule.  
  
The only objections which have been made to the proposed plan,  
are on the ground of its practicability. The difficulties alleged  
are, the superiority of the British in literature; the contempt with  
which they will look on our institutions and offers of correspon-  
dence; the prejudices of our own people in their favour, and the  
censequent necessity of waiting for them to lead the way. ‘These  
difficulties, if correct to the extent that some of our citizens seem  
inclined to admit, show at least the necessity of rryine to produce  
a favourable change. If in literature and science we are greatly  
inferior to any other people, it is not because we are deficient in  
natural, political, or moral advantages, or have not as strong rea-  
sons as any nation ever had to encourage letters; but because we  
have hitherto neglected any general or systematic means for their  
advancement. The arguments are fallacious which attempt to  
find in the circumstances or dispositions of our people any dis-  
qualification for the highest mental attainments. American genius  
and enterprise, properly directed, may as well be displayed in the  
highest walks of literature and science as in any thing else. One  
difficulty is, our scholars, as such, have very little intercourse,and  
have too long been strangers to each other. Homo solus imbecilis.  
Concert will excite a generous emulation. This, upon the plan  
proposed, will operate upon a vast and highly reputable field; it  
will be identified with the national character and the dearest in-  
terests of a great and rising people, and cannot fail to produce  
excellence, and command patronage and respect. The bare cir-  
cumstance of exciting attention to the subject is an important point  
to be gained. “ude et faciat.” A colonial servility in literature,  
is as unworthy of our country as political dependence. The ne

cessary limits of this letter forbid a course of reasoning upon the  
subject: it may be thought proper to give a fuller exposition in a  
pamphlet form. The general principles explained above are deem-  
ed sufficient as the basis of preparatory arrangement.  
  
Among the respectable persons consulted respecting the pro-  
posed institution, the sentiment, as far as ascertained, is very  
general and zealous in its favour. It is designed to carry it imte  
effect with as little delay as sound discretion, in reference to  
character and advantageous arrangements for a favourable com-  
mencement, will admit.  
  
The constitution formed for the society is purposely a very short  
one, intended chiefly as the basis for a commencement. A body  
of scholars, associated for the laudable object of promoting the  
literature of their country, many of them very familiar with pub-  
lic proceedings, will need fewer legal rules than a bank or a state.  
Whatever may be the deficiencies of this constitution, experience  
will be more competent to supply them ’than any wisdom of  
anticipation.  
  
From the peculiar circumstances of our country, the institution  
will have no guide in any thing which has gone before; but liberal  
criticism will make some allowance for the difficulties necessarily  
attendant on first attempts. The same regular progress will not  
be expected in an untrodden field as on a well travelled road:  
but in pursuing a noble object with good intention, there is the  
consolation, that those best qualified to judge are least inclined to  
condemn. If our beginning is a small one, so was that of the  
Royal Society of London; and we can have no reason to dread  
more obloquy from the illiberal, than they received.  
  
Very generous subscriptions, by a number of gentlemen who are  
not expected to be members, are volunteered, pro patria, and  
there is an encouraging prospect for funds. If among the variety  
of character in our country, there is a portion too ignorant or too  
grovelling to depart from their narrow views of immediate gain,  
it is hoped that, among ten millions of people, there are enough  
possessed of talent to estimate, and spirit to maintain, an institu-  
tion whose aim is to promote the best interests and lasting honour  
of the United States. In such a cause it is deemed unnecessary for  
the institution to solicit pecuniary aid, farther than by a fair ex-

position of its principles and objects. The subscriptions are te  
be a free-will offering upon the altar of our country: yet it will be  
no less creditable to the society, than just in itself, to hold in  
grateful remembrance, and transmit to future generations, the  
names of those generous citizens who, by their donations, become  
at once, the patrons of learning and the vindicators of the Ameri-  
can name. It may be one of the good effects of this society to  
bring patriotic generosity more into fashion, by causing it to be  
more honoured.

New York, October, 1, 1820. 92  
  
Your attention is respectfully request- 9%)  
ed to an association of scholars for the  
purpose of improving American litera-  
ture. This association, though yet at its  
commencement, and unknown to the  
public, has been the subject of an inter-  
esting correspondence for some months  
past; and it is believed will not be deem-  
ed unimportant as connected with the  
best interests of our country.  
  
To settle at once a point on which  
some difference might exist, it is not de-  
signed, independent of England, to form  
an American language, farther than as  
it relates to the numerous and increasing  
names and terms peculiarly American ;  
but to cultivate a friendly correspon-  
dence with any similar association or dis-  
tinguished individuals in Great Britain,  
who may be disposed to join us in an ex-  
ertion to improve our common language.  
  
-The objects of such an institution  
which directly present themselves, are,  
to collect and interchange literary intel-  
ligence ; to guard against local or foreign  
corruptions, or to correct such as already  
exist; to settle varying orthography ;  
determine the use ef doubtful words and  
phrases; and, generally, to form and  
maintain, as far as practicable, an Eng-  
lish standard of writing and pronuncia-  
tion, correct, fixed and uniform, through-  
out our extensive territory. Connected  
with this, and according to future ability,  
may be such rewards for meritorious pro-  
ductions, and such incentives to im-  
provement, in the language and litera-  
ture of our country, and in the general  
system of instruction, as from existing  
circumstances may become proper.  
  
These objects will not be thought  
trifling, by those who have spent much  
time in the cultivation of literature, or  
attended to its influence on society. Such  
persons need not be told how directly |  
they are connected with our progress in |  
general knowledge, or our public reputa-  
tion; or that their influence may extend  
from social to national intercourse, and  
to our commercial prosperity. Perspi-  
cuity in language is the basis of all sci-  
ence. ‘The philosophy that professes to  
teach the knowledge of thing&#x27;s, indepen-  
dent of words, needs only te be men-  
tioned among enlightened men to be re-  
jected.

Most of the European nations have  
considered the improvement of language  
as an important national object, and have  
established academies, with extensive  
funds and privileges, for that purpose.  
An interference of the government has,  
perhaps, been omitted in England, from  
a singular and rather accidental reliance  
on the acknowledged superiority of a  
few leading individuals ; and so long as  
all the literature i in the English language  
had its origin and centre in London,  
there was less danger in thus leaving it  
to the guidance of chance. Science may  
be comparatively recluse ; but literature  
is social; and American scholars, spread  
over 2,000,000 square miles, are not to  
be drawn to a virtual and national asso-  
ciation, without the form.  
  
It is very properly said of France that  
its literature has frequently saved the  
country when its arms have failed. The  
advantages resulting to that nation, from  
the exer tions of a few academicians, have  
been incalculable, and may serve to show,  
in some degree, what such a confederacy  
of scholars is capable of performing.  
The eftect of their influence was not  
barely to elevate France in the literary  
world, and to improve its learning within  
itself; but to extend their language  
throughout Europe ; to introduce, at the  
expense of other nations, t their books,  
their opinions, and, in aid of other causes  
their political preponderance. The Phi-  
lological Academies of Italy and Spain,  
though unaided by the same powerful co-  
operation, have effected very great im-  
provements in the language and litera-  
ture of their respective countries. The  
great work now performing by the Ger-  
man scholars, in addition to what they  
have before done, is a noble example to  
other nations, and calculated to elevate  
the condition of our nature. With how  
much greater force does every considera-  
tion connected with this subject, apply,  
ina free community, where all depends  
  
on the virtue and intelligence of the  
reat body of the people.  
  
Without dwelling a moment on invi-  
dious comparisons between England and  
the United States, the time appears to  
have arrived, in reference to ourselves,  
  
when, having acquired a high standing  
among nations, having succeeded in a fair  
trial of the practicability and excellence  
of our civil institutions, our scholars are

form the constitution of national litera-  
ture.  
  
We have some peculiar advantages in  
an attempt to establish national unifor-  
mity in language. Happily for us, our  
forefathers came chiefly from that part of  
England where their language was most  
cor rectly spoken, and were possessed of a  
good degree of intelligence, according to  
the learn ning of that time. Though ina  
country as diversified as ours, there are,  
from various causes, many particular  
corruptions, we hardly find any thing  
that can properly be called a provincial  
dialect. We have at present no very in-  
veterate habits to correct, where gross  
barbarisms, through large districts, are to  
be encountered. ‘The attempt, therefore,  
seasonably and judiciously made, pre-  
sents a prospect not only of success, but  
of comparative facility. Our scattered  
population seem only to want, from a  
competent tribunal, a declaration of what  
is proper, to guide them in their practice.  
The present appearances are more fa-  
vourable than the most sanguine among  
the projectors of the plan dared to pre-  
dict. ‘There is the best reason to expect  
the general concurrence of our distin-  
guished literary men in favour of a mea-  
sure which promises so many advantages,  
so nationally important in its principles  
and effects, and to which so little can be  
it is deemed unnecessary, at  
present, to dwell minutely on the details  
  
of the plan, which probabiy will not be  
  
difficult to settle, if the leading princi-  
  
_ ples are generally approved. It is equally  
useless to enter upon a train of argu-  
  
ments to prove the advantages of such an  
association under the present circum-  
  
_ stances of our country. The commanding  
influence of literature upon national  
_ wealth and power, as well as nior als, cha-  
_racter and happiness, especially in free  
  
communities, will not be doubted by  
those whose minds have been most di-  
rected to this interesting branch of civil  
Perhaps there never has been,  
  
the influence of moral causes, than the  
  
American republic at the present time.  
  
In every country truly free, public opi-  
nion is in effect the governing law; and  
ublic opinion, and all the complicated  
interests of society, greatly depend on  
the state of national literature. That  
independence which is our boast must  
consist in the proper independence of

the mind. Without contemning the ex-  
perience of peste ages, we ought not too  
slavishly to follow the path of others. It  
is enough to respect the Europeans as  
honourable competitors, without regard-  
ing them as abso ute masters. American  
ambition should aspire to nobie objects,  
if we mean to rise to excellence : for, be-  
sides that the imitator is almost necessa-  
  
ee  
  
  
  
rily inferior to his model, the old world |  
can furnish no model suited to the cir- |  
  
cumstances and character of our country.  
Weare a world by ourselves.  
  
Our privi- |  
  
leres, resources and prospects are of the |  
  
highest order. Happily exempt from he-  
reditar y despotism or bigoted hierarchies,  
from jealous and powerful bordering na-  
tions ; professed advocates of rational  
‘freedom, as we are, the world may justl  
claim from us an example worthy of mal  
a situation and such a cause. Our num-  
bers and wealth are greater than those of  
England were, when the last of her splen-  
did colleges was erected: we may have  
the learning of Europeans in common  
stock, with a an exemption from their bur-  
dens; and the highest eminence which  
others have attained, ought to be the  
American starting point in the career of  
national greatness.  
  
And is there any thing impossibie, or  
even particularly difficult, in reducing  
these ideas to practice ? Without expect-  
ing to render human nature perfect, or to  
fix an unalterable standard for living lan-  
guage and literature, may there not be  
some regulation which will place the de-  
cisions af the wise in preference to the  
blunders of the ignorant P When can a  
more favourable time be expected, to cor-  
rect the irregularities yearly multiplying  
upon us , and becoming more and more  
embodied with the literature of our coun-  
  
? Why should chance be expected to  
ahahuds § what, from its nature, can  
result only from well-regulated system?  
It would indeed be imprudent to attempt  
too much. Sound discretion will point  
out a middle course between a wild spi-  
rit of innovation and a tame acquiescence  
in obvious error. Language | is too impor-  
tant an instrument in human affairs to  
  
  
  
have its improvement regarded as useless |  
  
or trifling. Of all the objects of national  
identity, affection and pride, national  
literature is the most laudable, the most  
operative and the most enduring. It is  
to the scholars of antiquity we owe all  
we know of their statesmen and heroes,  
and even their distinctive national exist-

ence. i: the long train of ages their ta-  
bles of brass have mouldered awa , and  
their high- -wrought columns crumb ed to  
dust. Cities have sunk, and their last  
vestige been lost. The unconscious Turk  
half-tills the soil manured with decayed  
sculpture: but the monuments of genius  
and learning, more durable than marble  
and brass, remain the subject of unde-  
creasing admiration and delight.  
fame to which great minds aspire, is, to  
soar above the local contentions of the  
day, and live to after ages in the esteem  
of their fellow men. ‘The thought of this  
animates the patriot’s hope, and. nerves  
his arm in danger, toil and want. Shall it  
not be the ambition of Americans to pro-  
claim the honour of their benefactors, and  
transmit the glory of their country to  
the latest age of the world &gt;? Weare not  
here to awe the ignorant by the splendour  
of royal trappings, but to. command the  
respect of the. wise and good by moral  
greatness. ‘These objects are neither  
above the capacity, nor beneath the atten-  
tion of our countrymen. They are inter-  
woven with our individual happiness, our  
national character, and our highest in-  
terests. When we survey this vast as-  
semblage of states, independent, yet  
united ; competitors in useful improve-  
ment, yet members of one great body ;  
we behold such a theatre as the world has  
  
never before seen, for the exhibition of  
  
mental and moral excellence: and if the  
men of all ages whom we most delight to  
honour, have made it their chief glory to  
advance the literature of their respective  
countries, shall it be degradingly sup-  
posed, that, in this favoured land, either  
talents or zeal will be wanting in such a  
cause ? If it besaid, that Americaia have  
  
not paid that attention to education  
which the subject demanded ; it is true;  
  
and neither justice nor sound policy re- —  
  
quires us to disguise the fact: but has any  
fatality ordained that the people most in-  
terested in diffusing the light of instruc-  
tion, mast be degraded i in ‘the republic of  
letters? Much irritation has been pro- |  
duced by the observations of foreign wri-  
ters upon the learning and intellect of  
our countrymen. We ought not to waste |  
time in idle complaint on this subject. Is |  
there not in America enough of gen lus,  
of scholarship, and of patriotic spirit, if  
properly organized and conducted, to  
raise our literary character above the in-  
fluence of any combination abroad ? Shall

prized possession? Will foreign pens  
maintain and elevate American charac-  
ter? Is it not time to make a national  
stand in the moral world, as the exposi-  
  
tors of our own principles, the vindica- |  
  
tors of our institutions, and, under a be-  
neficent Providence, the arbiters of the  
destiny of unbern millions? Even if,  
contrary to all human expectation, such  
an association should fail in its objects,  
would it not justly be said, “ magnis ta-  
men excidit ausis ?”  
  
It is not intended to bring the society  
before the public by a premature and un-  
necessary parade, but to make it known  
chiefly by its practical good.  
  
The following isa veneral outline of  
  
the institution alluded to, subject, of  
course, to such variations as may be  
thought to increase the prospect of its  
utility. To be called “ The American  
Academy of Language and Belles Let-  
tres.”’  
  
Its prime object is to harmonize and  
determine the English language ; but it  
will also, according to its discretion and  
means, embrace every branch of useful  
and elegant literature, and especially  
whatever relates to our own country.  
  
To be located in the city of New York,  
where accommodations will be furnished  
free from expense.  
  
To commence with fifty members ;  
maximum number, one hundred and  
twenty. More than that would lessen  
the credit of membership, and diminish  
rather than increase its authority.  
  
Members to be divided into three classes.  
Resident, who reside in or near New York;  
corresponding, those whose distance pre-  
vents their regular attendance; and hono-  
  
, those at home or abroad, whom the

body may think proper expressly to admit |  
  
as such: but, perhaps, it will be thought  
best to make very few honorary members  
in the United States. The only reason for  
making a difference between resident and  
corresponding members, is to give to the  
latter all practicable privileges. and facili-  
ties in communicating their opinions, pro-  
positions and votes in writing, as a com-  
pensation for the difficulties of personal  
attendance. In questions requiring a bal-  
lot, the written opinions and wishes of dis-  
tant members are taken as votes on al}  
points to which they directly relate. As  
most of the questions likely to arise will  
relate to written language, and as few of ||

ADDRESS TO THE  
  
  
  
at a general result through the means of  
the various opinions in writing.  
  
It will be a standing request, though not  
absolutely required, that each member  
shall, within one year after his admission,  
deliver personally, or by writing, a dis-  
course upon some subject relating to lan-  
guage or general literature, or to the situa-  
tion and interests of the United States.  
  
The society, when organized, will send a  
respectful communication to such literary  
gentlemen in the British dominions as may  
be thought proper, explaining to them the  
design of the establishment, and inviting  
their co-operation. Public policy will unite  
with general convenience in pointing out  
to them the importance of improving our  
language, facilitating its acquisition to fo-  
reigners as well as native citizens, and  
preserving its uniformity throughout the  
extensive regions where it now ; does, or  
hereafter may prevail.  
  
The Modus Operandi should be the re-  
sult of the joint wisdom of the body, when  
formed; but almost every disputed point  
in language, and in ours they are very nu-  
merous, may be made a case, subjected to  
rule as far as possible, and brought to a  
decision, endeavouring to have this deci-  
sion concurrent between the British and  
ourselves.  
  
But besides the acknowledged corrup-  
tions which prevail in the language of this  
country, our peculiar institutions and cir-  
cumstances; our discoveries and improve-  
ments, have given rise to a large class of  
new words, Americanisms, if the critics  
please, necessary to express new things.  
To adopt and regulate these is not to alter  
the English language ; but only to supply  
its deficiencies. This is particularly a work  
of our own. It is also important that at-  
tention should be paid to the numerous  
names of places, French, Spanish, and abo-  
riginal, which are daily becoming incorpo-  
rated with our literature, and concerning  
which so much diversity at present exists.  
  
The unprofitable disputes among teach-  
ers and the authors of elementary books,  
who are often very unskilful advocates of  
their opposing systems, and whose argu-  
ments tend only to increase a difference  
which ought not to exist, would be ina  
great degree obviated. The professors of  
  
r rhetoric ‘and logick, in our best universities,  
should at least agree in spelling the names  
of the impor tant sciences they teach. Our  
numerous youth would then be left free to  
pursue the straight course to the know-  
ledge of a language which might be, not  
only strong and copious, but, to a far great-

‘er extent, regular and fixed. In addition  
to other advantages, there cannot be a ra-  
tional doubt that such an institution may  
have a beneficial influence in exciting emu-  
le tion and national concert, in our ‘litera-  
ture in general, and that many might be  
drawn to this interesting subject, who are  
now less profitably and less honourably  
employed in other pursuits.  
  
The object here contemplated, is, cer-  
tainly, of sufficient national importance to  
merit an adequate fund from the public.  
Should this fail, it would be improper to  
lay a burdensome expense on the mem-  
bers. Expenditures to any considerable  
amount are not considered indispensably  
necessary; for though individuals may not  
be able to accomplish all that may be de-  
sired, much may be done at a moderate ac-  
tual expense. ‘I&#x27;wenty-five dollars at the  
admission of a member, and two dollars a  
year afterwards, though trifling to some, ts  
considered enough to impose by any impe-  
rative rule.  
  
The only objections which have béen  
made to the proposed pian, are on the  
ground of its practicability. ‘The difficul-  
ties alleged are, the superiority of the Brit-  
ish in literature; the contempt with which  
they will look on our institutions and offers  
of correspondence; the prejudices of our  
own people in their favour, and the conse-  
quent necessity of waiting for them to lead  
the way. These difficulties, if correct to  
the extent that some of our citizens seem  
inclined to admit, show at least the neces-  
sity of trying to produce a favourable  
change. If in literature and science we  
are gr reatly inferior to any other people, it  
is not because we are deficient in natural,  
political, or moral advantages, or have not  
as strong reasons as any nation ever had  
to encourage letters; but because we have  
hitherto neglected any general or systema-  
tic means for their advancement. ‘The ar-  
guments are fallacious which attempt to  
find in the circumstances or dispositions of  
our people any disqualification for the high-  
est mental attainments. American genius  
and enterprise, properly directed, may as  
well be displayed in the highest walks of  
literature and science as in any thing else.  
One difficulty is, our scholars, as “such,  
have very little intercourse, and have too  
long been strangers to each other. Homo  
solus imbecilis. Concert will excite a ves  
nerous emulation. ‘This, upon the plan  
proposed, will operate upon a vast and  
highly reputable field; it will be identified  
with the national character and the dearest  
interests of a great and rising people, and

cannot fail to produce excellence, and  
command patronage and respect. The  
bare circumstance of exciting attention to  
the subject is an important point gained.  
“ Aude et faciat.” A colonial servility in  
literature, is as unworthy of our country as  
political dependence. The necessary limits  
of this letter forbid a course of reasoning  
upon the subject; it may be thought proper  
to vive a fuller exposition in a ~ pamphlet  
form. The general principles explained  
above are deemed sufficient as the basis of  
preparatory arrangement.  
  
Among the respectable persons consult-  
ed respecting the proposed institution, the  
sentiment, as far as ascertained, is very’  
general and zealous in its favour. It is  
designed to carry it into effect with as lit-  
tle delay as sound discretion, in reference  
to character and advantageous arrange-  
ments for a favourable commencement, will  
adinit.  
  
The constitution formed for the Society  
is purposely a very short one, intended  
chiefly as the basis for a commencement,  
A body of scholars, associated for the lau-  
dable object of promoting the literature of  
their country, many of them very familiar  
with public proceedings, will need fewer  
legal rules than a bank orastate. What-  
ever may be the deficiencies of this consti-  
tution, experience will be more competent  
to supply them than any wisdom of antici-  
pation.  
  
From the peculiar circumstances of our  
country, the institution will have no guide  
in any thing which has gone before; but  
liberal criticism will make some allowance  
for the difficulties necessarily attendant on  
first attempts. ‘The same regular progress  
will not be expected in an untrodden field  
as on a well travelled road; but in pursuing  
a noble object with good intention, there  
is the consolation that those best qualified  
to judge are least inclined to condemn, If  
our beginning is a small one, so was that  
of the Royal Society of London; and we  
can have no reason to dread more obloquy  
from the illiberal, than they received.  
  
Very generous subscriptions, by a num-  
ber of ‘gentlemen who are not expected to  
be members, are volunteered, pro patria,  
and there is an encouraging prospect for  
funds. If among the varie sty of character  
in our country, heowi isa portion too igno-  
rant or too grovelling, to depart from their  
narrow views of immediate gain, it is hoped  
that, among ten millions of people, there  
are enough ‘possessed of talent to estimate,  
  
and spirit to maintain, an institation whose  
aim is to promote the best interests and

Jasting honour of the United States. In  
such a cause it is deemed unnecessary for  
the institution to solicit pecuniary aid, far-  
ther than by a fair exposition of its princi-  
ples and objects. The subscriptions are to  
be a free-will offering upon the altar of our  
country: yet it will be no less creditable  
to the society, than just in itself, to hold in  
erateful remembrance, and transmit to fu-  
ture generations, the names of those gene-  
rous citizens who, by their donations, be-  
come at once, the patrons of learning and  
the vindicators of the American name. It  
may be one of the good effects of this so-  
ciety to bring patriotic generosity more  
into fashion, by causing it to be more hon-  
oured.

among others, “to collect and interchange  
literary intelligence ; ; to guard against local  
or foreign corruptions, or to correct such as  
already exist ; to settle varying orthography;
