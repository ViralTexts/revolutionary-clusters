ir,  
Mt Vernon 12th April 1786  
  
I give you the trouble of this letter at the instance of Mr Dalby of Alexandria; who is called to Philadelphia to attend what he conceives to be a vexatious law-suit respecting a slave of his, which a Society of Quakers in the City (formed for such purposes) have attempted to liberate. The merits of this case will no doubt appear upon trial; but from Mr Dalby’s state of the matter, it should seem that this Society is not only acting repugnant to justice so far as its conduct concerns strangers, but, in my opinion extremely impolitickly with respect to the State—the City in particular; &amp; without being able (but by Acts of tyranny &amp; oppression) to accomplish their own ends. He says the conduct of this society is not sanctioned by Law: had the case been otherwise, whatever my opinion of the Law might have been, my respect for the policy of the State would on this occasion have appeared in my silence; because against the penalties of  
  
promulgated Laws one may guard; but there is no avoiding the snares of individuals, or of private societies—and if the practice of this Society of which Mr Dalby speaks, is not discountenanced, none of those whose misfortune it is to have slaves as attendants will visit the City if they can possibly avoid it; because by so doing they hazard their property—or they must be at the expence (&amp; this will not always succeed) of providing servants of another description for the trip.  
I hope it will not be conceived from these observations, that it is my wish to hold the unhappy people who are the subject of this letter, in slavery. I can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of it—but there is only one proper and effectual mode by which it can be accomplished, &amp; that is by Legislative authority: and this, as far as my suffrage will go, shall never be wanting.  
But when slaves who are happy &amp; content to remain with their present masters, are tampered with &amp; seduced to leave them; when masters are taken at unawar[e]s by these practices; when a conduct of this sort begets discontent on one side and resentment on the other, &amp; when it happens to fall on a man whose purse will not measure with that of the Society, &amp; he looses his property for want of means to defend it—it is oppression in the latter case, &amp; not humanity in any; because it introduces more evils than it can cure.  
I will make no apology for writing to you on this subject; for if Mr Dalby has not misconceived the matter, an evil exists which requires a remedy; if he has, my intentions have been good though I may have been too precipitate in this address. Mrs Washington joins me in every good &amp; kind wish for Mrs Morris &amp; your family, and I am &amp;c.

not humanity in any, because it introduces more evils than it can cure.

Mur NT Vernon, 12th April, 17 Sb.  
| Dear Sir—1 give you the trouble of this letter ;  
at the instance of Mr. Dalby of Alexandria, w ho j  
is called to Philadelphia to attend to w hat he eon- j  
i siders a vexatious law suit, respecting a slave of;  
j  
I his, whom a society in the city,—formed lbr such  
purposes,—have attempted to liberate. The me­  
rits of his case will no doubt, appear upon trial. !  
From Mr. Dalby’s statement of the matter, it ;  
should seem, that this society is not only acting  
j repugnantly io justice,—so far as its conduct con­  
cerns strangers,—but, in my opinion, impoliticly i  
with respect to the State, the city in particular, |  
without being able, except by acts of tyranny and j  
oppression, to accomplish its ow n ends. He says j  
■ tie conduct of the society is not sanctioned by I  
law. Had the case been otherwise, whatever!  
my opinion of the Jaw s might have been, my re- I  
speet for the policy of the State, would, on this  
* occasion, have appeared in my silence; because  
against the penalties of promulgated law’s one !  
  
may guard, but there is no avoiding the snares ol :  
individuals, or ol private societies. If the prac- j  
lice of this society, of which Mr. l)alby speaks,  
ij not discount* nanoed, none of those, whose ?m\s­  
tlrlv&#x27;Hi it is to have slaves as attendants, will \is-!  
if the city if they can possibly avoid it; because  
by so doing they hazard their property, or they &#x27;  
must lie at the expense (and this will not always  
succeed,) of providing servants of another discrip- 1  
: tion. |  
1 hope it w ill not be conceived from the^c ob­  
servations, that it is my wish to hold the unhappy  
I people, who are the subject ol this letter, in sla­  
very. I can only say, that there is not a man liv­  
ing, who w ishes more sincerely than I do to see a  
plan adopted lor the abolition of it; but there is  
only one proper and effectual mode by w hich it  
can be accomplished, and that is by legislative  
authority ; and this as far as my sulfragc will go,  
shall never bo wanting. But when slaves who  
are happy and contented with their present mas­  
ters, are tampered with and seduced to leave  
! them; when masters arc taken unawares by these j  
practices; when a conduct of this kind hegets dis-;  
i *  
content on one side and resentment on the other ; i  
i and when it happens to fall on a man whose purse  
will not measure w ith that of the societv, and he  
lose his property for want of means to defend it; I  
it is oppression in such a case, and not humanity  
in any, because it introduces more evils than it  
can cure.  
I make no apology lor writing to y ou on this \
subject, for, if Mr. Dulby has not misconceived

dy ; and if he has, my intentions have been good,

andria. who is called to Philadelphia, to attend  
what he conceives to l&gt;e a vexatious law-suit,  
respecting a slave of his, whom a society of  
Quakers in the city, formed for such j?urp&lt;?ses,  
have attempted to liberate. The merits of this  
case will, no doubt, appear upon trial. From  
I Mr. Dalby&#x27;s state of the matter, it should  
seem, that this society is not only acting repugnantly  
to justice, so far as its conduct concerns  
strangers, but in my opinion impoliticly  
with respect to the State, the city in particular,  
without being able, except by acts of tyrnnny  
and oppression, to accomplish its own  
ends He savs* the conduct of this society is  
! not sanctioned by law. Had the case been  
! otherwise, whatever my opinion of the law  
might have been, my respect for the policy of  
the State would on this occasion have appeared  
; in my silence: because against the penalties  
of promulgated laws one may guard, but there

of which Mr. Dalby speaks, is not dis- |

it is to have sluves ns attendants, will visit the  
I city, if they can possibly avoid it; because, by  
so doing, they hazard their property, or they  
must bo at the expense (and this will not always  
succeed) of providing servants of another  
description.  
I I hope it will not be conceived, from these  
j observations, that it is my wish to hold the nnhappy  
people, who are the subject of this letter,  
in slavery I can only say, that there is  
not a man living who wishes more sincerely  
than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition  
of it. But there is only one proper and

discontent on one side and resentment on the

whose purse will not measure with that of the

MouNt VErNON, 12th April, 1785.  
Dear Sir: I give you the trouble of this, letter at  
the instance of Mr. Dalby of Alexandria, who is  
called to Philadelphia to attend what he conceives  
to be a vexatious lawsuit respecting a slave of his.  
whom a society of Quakers in this city, formed for  
such purposes, have attempted to liberate. The  
merits of this case will, no doubt, appear upon  
trial. From Mr. Dalby&#x27;s statement of the matter, it  
should seem that this society is not only acting re­  
pugnanlly to justice, so far as its conduct concerns  
strangers, but in my opinion impolitiely with respect  
to the State, the city in particular, without being  
able, except by acts of tyranny and oppression, to  
accomplish its own ends. He says the conduct of  
this society is not sanctioned by law. Had the case  
been otherwise, whatever my opinion of the law migtht  
have been, my respect for the policy of the State  
would on this occasion have appeared in my silence;  
because against the penalties of promulgated laws  
one may guard, but there is no avoiding the snares  
of individuals, or private societies. If the practice  
of this society, of which Mr. Dalby speaks, is not  
discountenanced, none of those, whose misrouruxe  
it is to have slaves as attendants, will not visit the  
city if they can possibly avoid it; because by so doing  
they hazard their property, or they must be at the  
expense (and this will not always succeed) of pro  
viding servants of another description.  
I hope it will not be conceived from these obser  
vations, that it is my wish to hold the unhappy  
people, who are the subject of this letter, in slavery.  
I can only say, that there is not a man living, who  
wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopt­  
ed for the abolition of it; but there is only one  
proper and effectual mode by which it can be ac-  
complished, and that is by legislative authority; and  
 this, as far as my suffrage will go, shall never be  
wanting. But when slaves, who are happy and con-  
tented wilh their present masters, are tampered with and  
seduced to leave them; when masters are taken unad-  
wares by these practices; when a conduct of this kind  
begets discontent on one side and resentment on the  
other; and when it happens to fall on a man whose  
purse will not measure with that of the society, and  
he loses his property for want of means to defend it.  
it is oppression in such a case, and not humanity in

Motrwr V=ll°34&#x27;l2 April, 1786.   
  
Data Sin give you the trouble of this   
letter at the instance of Mr. Dolby, of Alex­  
andria, who is called-to Philadelphia to attend   
to what he conceives to be   
na vexatious lawsuit   
respecting a slave of his, whom a &#x27;,Moiety of   
Quakers in the city, formed for euchaiurposes,   
have attempted to liberate. The merits of this   
case will no doubt. appear upon trial.= From   
Mr. Dolby&#x27;s state of the matter, it should seem   
that this society is not only acting repugnantly   
to justice, so far as its conduct concerns stran­  
gers, but in my opinion impolitically with re­  
spect to the State, the city in particular, with­  
out being able, except by acts of tyranny and   
oppression, to accomplish its own ends. He   
says the &#x27;conduct of this society is not sanc­  
tioned by law. Had the case been otherwise,   
whatever my opinion of the law might have   
been, my respect for the policy of the State•   
would en this occasion have appeared in my   
silence; because against the penalties of pro­  
mulgated laws one may guard, but there is no   
avoiding the snares of individuals, or of private   
societies. If the practice of this society, of   
which Mr. Dolby speaks, is not discounte­  
nanced, none &#x27;of those whose misfortunes it is   
to have slaves as attendants, &#x27;will visit the city   
if they can possibly avoid it ; because by so   
doing they hazard their property, or they must   
be at the expense (and this will not always   
succeed) of providing servants of another de­  
scription.   
  
I hope it will not be conceived from these   
observations, that it is my wish to hold the   
unhappy people, who are the subject of this   
letter, in slavery. I can only say, that there   
is not a man living who wishes more sincerely   
than I do, to see a plan adopted for the aboli­  
tion of it ; but there is only one proper and   
effectual mode by which it can be accomplished,   
and that is by&#x27; legislative authority; and this   
as far as my suffrage will go, shall never be   
wanting.   
But, when slaves, who are happy and con­  
tented with their present masters are tam­  
pered with and seduced to leave them;. when   
masters are taken unawares by these practices;   
when a conduct of this kind begets discontent   
on one side aid resentment on the other; and   
when it happens to fall on a man whose purse   
will not measure with that of the society, and   
he loses his property for want of means to defend   
it; it is oppression in such a case, aid not huma­  
nity in any, because it introduces more evils   
than it can cure. Gao. WASHINGTON.
