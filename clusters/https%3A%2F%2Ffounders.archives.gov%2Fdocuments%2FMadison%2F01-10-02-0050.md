ges of making “the general government partly federal and partly national,” moved that each state have an equal vote in the Senate (Farrand, RecordsMax Farrand, ed., The Records of the  
Federal Convention of 1787 (4 vols.; New Haven, 1911–37)., I, 474).  
  
Mr. Madison. I would always exclude inconsistent principles in framing a system of government. The difficulty of getting its defects amended are great and sometimes insurmountable. The Virginia state government was the first which was made, and though its defects are evident to every person, we cannot get it amended. The Dutch have made four several attempts to amend their system without success. The few alterations made in it were by tumult and faction, and for the worse. If there was real danger, I would give the smaller states the defensive weapons—But there is none from that quarter. The great danger to our general government is the great southern and northern interests of the continent, being opposed to each other. Look to the votes in congress, and most of them stand divided by the geography of the country, not according to the size of the states.  
Suppose the first branch granted money, may not the second branch, from state views, counteract the first? In congress, the single state of Delaware prevented an embargo, at the time that all the other states thought it absolutely necessary for the support of the army. Other powers, and those very essential, besides the

a system of government. The difficulty of getting its defects  
amended are great, and sometimes insurmountable. The Vir-  
ginia State government was the first which was made, and though  
its defects are evident to every person, we cannot get it amended.  
The Dutch have made four several attempts to amend their  
system without success. The few alterations made in it were by  
tumult and faction, and for the worse. If there was real danger,  
I would give the smaller States the defensive weapons; but there

the South. This was the great problem which they most  
distinctly proposed to themselves. Let us examine, then,  
how it was solved by their legislation.  
  
As the great difference of interests ‘lay between the  
Northern and Southern States,’ so, said Mr. Madison, ‘ if  
any defensive power were necessary, it ought to be mutually  
given tc those two interests. He was so strongly impressed  
with this important truth, that he had been casting about  
in his mind for some expedient that would answer the pur-  
pose. The one which had occurred, was, that instead of  
proportioning the votes in both branches to their respective  
number of inhabitants, computing the slaves in the value  
of five to three, they should be represented in one branch  
according to the number of free inhabitants; and in the  
other according to the whole number, counting the slaves  
as free. By this arrangement, the Southern scale would  
have had the advantage in one House, and the Northern in  
the other.’*

ests, not-by their difference in size, but by other circumstances ;  
the most material of which resulted partly from climate, but  
principally from the effects of their having or not having slaves.  
These two causes concurred in forming the great division of

not upon their size, but upon their being slave-holding or non-  
slave-holding States. The remedy for this difference which
