Sir,  
Washington 7th. March 1804  
I take up my Pen to communicate to you in Writing, what I had the Honour of expressing to you verbally the Day before yesterday.  
I shall begin by calling your Attention to the Act of Congress published in the enclosed Gazette, entitled “An Act for laying and collecting Duties on Imports and Tonnage within the Territories ceded to the United States by the Treaty of the 30th. April One thousand Eight hundred and three, between the United States and the French Republick and for other Purposes.”  
I confess, that after having read the Eleventh Section of this Act, although I saw it published in the National Intelligencer in which Paper the newly-enacted Laws of the United States usually appear first, I regarded the Section alluded to, as an atrocious libel against the Goverment of this Country.  
In reality, how could I imagine, after you had given me on the 1st. instant, in the Name of the President of the United states, the most positive assurances of his Desire to preserve the Ties which happily Subsist between the King of Spain and the United States, that this Goverment had Six Days before offered to his Catholic Majesty one of the greatest Insults which one Power can be guilty of towards another? How could I expect, that the American Goverment, which prides itself so much on its good Faith, which is so Zealous in the Preservation and Defence of its own Rights, would have violated, with all the Solemnity of a Legislative Act, those of the King my Master by usurping those of his Sovereignty? It appears, nevertheless, that the Act alluded to is Authen

f East Florida to the District of which Mention is made in the Eleventh Section, and to place a Collector of the Customs in Apalache or Pensacola, To convince you, Sir, that these Inferences are not exaggerated I will take the Liberty of transcribing a part of the Eleventh Section as follows: Sect 11th. “And be it further enacted, that the President be, and he hereby is, authorised, whenever he shall deem it expedient to erect the Shores, Waters, and Inlets of the Bay and river Mobille and of the other Rivers, Creeks Inlets and Bays emptying into the Gulph of Mexico, East of the said River Mobille and West thereof to the Pascaguola inclusive, into a seperate District, and to establish such place within the same, as he shall deem expedient, to be the Port of Entry and Delivery for such District, and to Designate such other Places within the same District, not exceeding Two, to be Ports of Delivery only. Whenever such seperate District shall be erected, a Collector shall be appointed to reside at the Port of Entry and a Surveyor shall likewise be appointed, to reside at each of the Ports of Delivery which may be established &amp;ca.” It is evident therefore that according to these Expressions the Authority given to the President is unlimited to the East of the river Mobille, and that it comprehends indirectly the Power of declaring, or rather of

go and being then informed of the Treaty of Purchase of Louisiana, by which it was to pass into their Hands, expresses himself in the following Terms “It does not appear by the Cession of Louisiana to the United States that we obtain the whole of both sides of the Mississippi: for by consulting No 5 of the Maps it will be seen that the Isle of New Orleans which lies on the East side of the Mississippi only extends North to Manchac⟨:⟩ from thence Northerly along the East side of the River to the Southern Boundary of the United States is still held by his Catholic Majesty as a part of West Florida and which Separates the Island of New Orleans from the other Possessions of the United States on the East side of the river” And further on he continues “By the Cession of Louisiana to the United States, we gain but little on the Gulph of Mexico, and are but little benefited as a Maratime People. The important and Safe Harbours in both the Floridas still remain in the possession of his Catholic Majesty &amp;ca.” Finally in the Map which he lays down of those Territories he calls them West Florida a⟨nd⟩ not Louisiana.

Having proved the offence and having demonstrated the Insult which has been offered to the Sovereignty of His Catholic Majesty, it is my Duty as His Minister and as the Guardian of His Interests in this part of the World, to ask, as I now do, of the Goverment of the United States Satisfaction proportionate to the Injury offered to my Sovereign and to Demand that the said Eleventh Section be annulled and revoked or at least that part of it which so manifestly violates the rights of His Catholic Majesty.

the Presi­  
dent to organize the collection district of Mo­  
bile, which formed a part of the territory in  
dispute between Spain and the United States.  
When the Spanish Hotspur heard of this he  
was furious. He went to the State Depart­  
ment in a towering rage, found Mr. Madison  
there, and overwhelmed him with reproaches.  
Then he nursed his wrath for two days, and  
on the third committed it to paper. His letter  
to Mr. Madison is undoubtedly the most out­  
rageous violation of diplomatic propriety that  
has ever been committed in the history of this  
country. Referring to the obnoxious act, he  
  
wrote!  
I confess that after having read the eleventh seo­  
tion of this act, although I saw it published in the  
Natsonal Intelligencer, in which paper the newly  
enacted laws of the United States usually appear  
first, I regarded the section alluded to as an atro­  
cious libel against the Government of this country.  
In reality, how could I imagine, after you had  
given me on the 1st inst., in the name of the Presl­  
dent of the United States, the most positive assur­  
ance of his desire to preserve the ties which hap-  
pily subsist between the King of Spain and the  
United States, that this Government had six day  
before offered to his Catholic Majesty one of the  
greatest insults which one power can be gullty of  
to another. How could I expect that the American  
Government, which prides itself so much upon its  
good faith, which is so zealous in the preservation  
and defence of its own rights, would have violated,  
with all the solemnity of a legislative act, those of  
the King, my master, by usurping his sovereignty.  
He then proceeds to argue the case, and con­  
eucts praved the offence, and havinr demon  
strated the insult which has been offered to the  
sovereignty of his Catholic Majesty, it is my duty as  
his Minister and the guardian of his interests in  
this part of the world, to ask, as I now do, of the  
Government of the United States satisfaction pro­  
portioned to the injury offered to my Sovereign,  
and to demand that the said eleventh section be an­  
nulled and revoked, or at least that part of it which  
so manifestly violates the rights of his Catholic  
Majesty.
