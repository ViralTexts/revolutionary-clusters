. that the present volume is equally orthodox, I know before reading it, because I know that Colo Taylor and myself have rarely, if ever, differed in any political principle of importance. every act of his life, &amp; every word he ever wrote satisfies me of this. so also as to the two presidents, late and now in office, I know them both to be of principles as truly republican as any men living. if there be any thing amiss therefore in the present state of our affairs, as the formidable deficit lately unfolded to us indicates, I ascribe it to the inattention of Congress to it’s duties, to their unwise dissipation &amp; waste of the public contributions. they seemed, some little while ago to be at a loss for objects whereon to throw away the supposed fathomless funds of the treasury. I had feared the result, because I saw among them some of my old fellow laborers, of tried and known principles, yet often in their minorities. I am aware that in one of their most ruinous vagaries the people were themselves betrayed into the same phrensy, with their Representatives. the deficit produced, &amp; a heavy tax to supply it will, I trust, bring both to their sober senses. but it is not from this branch of government we have most to fear. taxes &amp; short elections will keep them right. the Judiciary of the US. is the subtle corps of sappers &amp; miners constantly working under ground to undermine the foundations of our confederated fabric. they are construing our constitution from a coordination of a general and special governments to a general &amp; supreme one alone. this will lay all things at their feet, and they are too well versed in English law to forget the maxim ‘boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem.’ we shall see if they are bold enough to maintain the daring stride their 5 lawyers have lately taken. if they do, then, with the Editor of our book, in his address to the public, I will say that ‘against this every man should raise his voice,’ and more, should uplift his arm. Who wrote this admirable address? sound, luminous, strong, not a word too much, nor one which can be changed but for the worse. that pen should go on, lay bare these wounds of our constitution, expose these decisions seriatim, and arrouse, as it is able, the attention of the nation to these bold speculators on it’s patience. having found from experience that impeachmt is an impracticable thing, a mere scare-crow, they consider themselves secure for life; they sculk from responsibility to public opinion the only remaining hold on them, under a practice, first introduced into England by Ld Mansfield. an opinion is huddled up in Conclave, perhaps by a majority of one, delivered as a crafty Chief judge, as if unanimous, and, with the silente acquiescence of lazy or timid associates, he sophisticates the law to his mind by the turn of his own reasoning. a judiciary law was once reported by the Attorney Genl to Congress, requiring each judge to deliver his opinion seriatim &amp; openly, and then to give it in writing to the clerk to be entered on the record. a judiciary independant of a king on or Executive alone, is a good thing; but independance on the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a republican government.  
But to return to your letter. you ask for my opinion of the work you send me, and to let it go out to the public. this I have ever made a point of declining (one or two instances only excepted.) complimentory thanks to writers who have sent me their works have betrayed me sometimes before the public,

“But it is not from this branch of Government  
(Congress) we have most to fear. I axes a id  
short elections will keep them right. The judi­  
ciary of the United States is the subtle corps of  
sappers and miners constantly working under  
ground to undermine the foundations of our con­  
federated fabric. They are construing our Con­  
stitution from a co-ordination of a general and  
special government to a general and supreme one  
alone. This will lay all things at their feet, and  
they are too well versed in English law to f &gt;rg U  
the maxim, Boni judices est ampliarc jurisdiction­

“Having found from experience that impeach­  
ment is an impracticable thing, a mere scare­  
crow, they consider themseive^secure for life ;  
they skulk from responsibility to pu lie opinion  
the only remaining hold on them, under a prac­  
tice first introduced into England by Lord Mans­  
field. An opinion is huddled up in conclave,  
perhaps by a majority of one, delivered as if unan­  
imous, and with the silent acquiescence of lazy or  
timid associates, by a crafty chief judge, who  
sophisticates the law to his mind, by the turn of  
his own reasoning. A judiciary law was once  
reported by the Attorney GeneraJ to Congress,  
requiring each judge to deliver his opinion seria­  
tim and openly, and then to give it in writin gto  
the Clerk, to be entered on the record. A judi­  
ary independent of a King or Executive alone, is  
a £00d thing: but independence of the will of the  
nation, is a solecism at least in a republican gov­  
ernment *

“But it is not from this branch of govern-

elections will keep them right. The judi- .  
ciary of the United States is the subtle corps  
of sappers and miners constantly working un-

our confederated fabric. They are construing  
our constitution from a codrdination of a gene-  
ral and special government to a general and

their feet-—and they are too well versed in  
English law to forget the maxim, ‘ boni judicis  
est ampliare jurisdictionem.’ We shall see if  
they are bold enough to take the daring stride  
their five lawyers have lately taken. If they  
do, then, with the editor of our book, in his  
address to the public, I will say, that ‘ against  
this every man should raise his voice;’ and,  
more, should uplift his arm. Who wrote this  
admirable address ? Sound, luminous, strong,  
not a word too much, nor one which can be  
changed, but for the worse. That pen should  
go on—lay bare these wounds of our con-  
stitution—expose the decisions seriatim— and  
arouse, as it is able, the attention of the na-  
tion to these bold speculators on its patience.  
Having found, from experience, that impeach-  
ment is an impracticable thing—a mere scare-  
crow—they consider themselves secure for  
life ; they skulk from responsibilities to pub-  
lic opinion—the only remaining hold on them.  
Under a practice first introduced into =  
land by Lord Mansfield, an opinion is hud-  
died up in conclave, perhaps by a ee pr  
of one, delivered as if unanimous, and wit  
the silent acquiescence of lazy or timid asso-  
cates, by a crafty chief judge, who sophisti-  
cates the law to his mind by the turn of his  
own reasoning. A judiciary law was once  
reported by the Attorney General to Congress,

they consider themselves secure for

Mansfield. An opinion is huddled up

deliver his opinion seriatim and openly,  
and then to give it in writing to the  
clerk to be entered on the record. A

was by long odds the fiercest enemy  
the Supreme Court ever had, as can be  
  
proven by his own writings, published  
by Congress. See what he -wrote to  
Thomas Ritchie, author of the saying  
“We will see what we shall see,” in  
1820:  
  
“The judiciary of the United States  
is the subtle corps of sappers and mi-  
ners constantly working under ground  
to undermine the foundations of our  
confederated fabric. They are constru-  
ing our Constitution from a codrdina-  
tion of a general and special govern-  
ment to a general and supreme one  
alone. This will lay all things at their  
feet, and they are too well versed in  
English law to forget the maxim,  
“boni judicis est ampliare jurisdic-  
tionem.” . . Having found,from ex-  
perience, that impeachment is an im-  
practicable thing, a mere scarecrow,  
they consider themselves secure for life;  
they skulk from responsibility to pub-  
lic opinion, the only remaining hold on  
them, under a practice first introduced  
into England by Lord Mansfield. An  
opinion is huddled up in conclave, per-  
haps by a majority of one, delivered  
as if unanimous, and with the silent  
acquiescence of lazy or timid associ-  
ates, by a crafty chief judge who so-  
phisticates the law to his mind by the  
turn of his reasoning. . A judi-  
cilary independent of a king or execu-  
tive alone is a good thing; but indepen-  
dence of the will of the nation is a  
solecism, at least in a republican goy-  
ernment.”  
  
The above and other virulent utter-  
ances of Mr. Jefferson, compared with  
which Mr. Sumner’s speech was harm-  
less and tame, were directed at the  
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,  
John Marshall, whose interpretations  
and expoundings of our great and glo-  
rious Constitution have endeared his
