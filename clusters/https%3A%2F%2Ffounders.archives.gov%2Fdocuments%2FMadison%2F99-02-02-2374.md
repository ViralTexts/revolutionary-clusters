I have received your friendly letter of the 18th. inst. The few lines which answered your former one of the  
21st Jany last, were written in haste &amp; in bad health: but they expressed, though without the attention in some  
respects due to the occasion, a dissent from the views of the President, as to a Bank of the U. S. and a substitute for it; to  
which I cannot but adhere. The objections to the latter have appeared to me, to preponderate greatly over the advantages  
expected from it; and the constitutionality of the former I still regard as sustained by the considerations to which I  
yeilded in giving my assent to the existing bank.  
The charge of inconsistency between my objection to the constitutionality of such a Bank in 1791, and my  
assent in 1817, turns on the question, how far legislative precedents expounding the constitution, ought to guide  
succeeding legislatures, and to overule individual opinions.  
Some obscurity has been thrown over the question, by confounding it with the respect due from one  
Legislature, to laws passed by preceding Legislatures. But the two cases are essentially different. A Constitution being  
derived from a superior authority, is to be expounded &amp; obeyed, not controuled or varied by the subordinate  
authority of a legislature. A law on the other hand, resting on no higher authority than that possessed by every  
successive legislature, its expediency as well as its meaning is within the scope of the latter.  
The case in question has its true Analogy in the obligation, arising from Judicial expositions of the law on  
succeeding Judges; the Constitution being a law to the Legislator, as the law is a rule of decision to the Judge.  
And why are Judicial precedents, when formed on due discussion and consideration, and deliberately sanctioned  
by reviews and repetitions, regarded as of binding influence, or rather of authoritative force, in settling the meaning of  
a law? It must be answered 1. because it is a reasonable and established axiom, that the good of society requires that the  
rules of Conduct for its members should be certain and Known; which would not be the case, if every Judge, disregarding  
the decisions of his predecessors, should vary the rule of law according to his individual interpretation of it. Misera  
est servitus ubi jus est aut vagum aut incognitum [Being subject to a law is miserable where the law is either vague or  
unknown]. 2. because an exposition of the law publicly made, and repeatedly confirmed by the constituted authority,  
carries with it, by fair inference, the sanction of those, who having made the law through their legislative organ, appear  
under such circumstances to have determined its meaning through their Judiciary organ.  
Can it be of less consequence that the meaning of a constitution should be fixed and known that the meaning  
of a law should be so? Can indeed a law be fixed in its meaning and operation, unless the Constitution be so? On the  
contrary, if a particular Legislature, differing in the construction of the Constitution from a series of preceeding  
constructions, proceed to act on that difference, they not only introduce uncertainty &amp; instability in the  
Constitution, but in the laws themselves; in as much as all laws preceding the new construction, and inconsistent with it,  
are not only annulled for the future, but virtually pronounced nullities from the beginning.  
But it is said that the Legislator having sworn to support the Constitution, must support it in his own  
construction of it; however different from that put on it by his predecessors, or whatever be the consequences of the  
construction. And is not the judge under the same oath to support the law? yet has it ever been supposed that he was  
required, or at liberty, to disregard all precedents however solemnly repeated &amp; regularly observed; and by giving  
effect to his own abstract and individual opinions; to disturb the established course of practice in the business of the  
community. Has the wisest and most conscientious Judge ever scrupled to acquiesce in decisions in which he has been  
overuled by the matured opinions of the majority of his colleagues; and subsequently to conform himself thereto, as to  
authoritative expositions of the law? And is it not reasonable that the same view of the official oath should be taken by a  
legislator, acting under the Constitution which is his guide, as is taken by a Judge, acting under the law which is his.  
There is in fact and in common understanding, a necessity of regarding a course of practice, as above  
characterised, in the light of a legal rule of interpreting a law: and there is a like necessity of considering it a  
constitutional rule of interpreting a Constitution.  
That there may be extraordinary &amp; peculiar circumstances controuling the rule in both cases may be  
admitted: but with such exceptions, the rule will force itself on the practical judgements of the most ardent Theorist. He  
will find it impossible to adhere to, and act officially upon his solitary opinions as to the meaning of the law or  
constitution; in opposition to a construction reduced to practice, during a reasonable period of time; more especially  
where no prospect existed of a change of construction by the public or its agents. And if a reasonable period of time,  
marked with the usual sanctions, would not bar the individual prerogative, there could be no limitation to its exercise,  
altho’ the danger of error must increase with the increasing oblivion of explanatory circumstances, and with the continual  
changes in the import of words and phrases.  
Let it then be left to the decision of every intelligent and candid judge which on the whole, is most to be  
relied on for the true and safe construction of a constitution, that which has the uniform sanction of successive  
Legislative bodies, through a period of years and under the varied ascendancy of parties; or that which depends upon the  
opinion of every new legislature, heated as it may be by the spirit of party, eager in the pursuit of some favorite  
object, or led astray by the eloquence and address of popular Statesmen, themselves, perhaps, under the influence of the  
same misleading causes.  
It was in conformity with the view here taken of the respect due to deliberate &amp; reiterated  
precedents, that the Bank of the United States, tho’ on the original question held to be unconstitutional, received the  
Executive Signature in the year 1817. The Act originally establishing a Bank had undergone ample discussions in its  
passage thro’ the several branches of the Government: It had been carried into execution throughout a period of 20 years  
with annual legislative recognitions; in one instance indeed, with a positive ramification of it into a new State; and  
with the entire acquiescence of all the local authorities, as well as of the nation at large to all of which may be added,  
a decreasing prospect of any change in the public opinion adverse to the Constitutionality of such an Institution. A veto  
from the Executive under these circumstances, with an admission of the expediency &amp; almost necessity of the  
measure, would have been a defiance of all the obligations derived from a course of precedents amounting to the requisite  
evidence of the national judgement &amp; intention.  
It has been contended that the authority of precedents was in that case invalidated by the consideration,  
that they proved only a respect for the stipulated duration of the Bank, with a toleration of it until the law should  
expire; and by the casting vote given in the Senate by the Vice President in the year 1811, against a bill for  
establishing a national Bank, the vote being expressly given on the ground of unconstitutionality. But if the law itself  
was unconstitutional, the stipulation was void, and could not be constitutionally fulfilled or tolerated. And as to the  
negative of the Senate by the casting vote of the presiding Officer; it is a fact well understood at the time that it  
resulted not from an equality of opinions in that Assembly on the power of Congress to establish a Bank, but from a  
junction of those who admitted the power but disapproved the plan, with those who denied the power. On a simple question  
of constitutionality, there was a decided majority in favor of it.  
Mrs. Madison joins me in hoping that you will not fail to make the intended visit to Virginia, which promises  
us the pleasure of welcoming you to our domecil, and in a sincere return of all the good wishes you kindly express for us.

Montpelier, June 25, 1831.  
  
Dear sir—I have received your friendly letter of the  
18th inst. The few lines which answered your former  
one of the 2ist of January last, were written in haste  
and in bad health: but they expressed, though without  
the attention in some respects due to the oceasion, a  
dissent from the views of the president, as to a bank of  
the United States and a substitute for it; to which I can-  
not butadhere. The objections to the latter have ap-  
pearec to me to preponderate greatly over the advanta-  
ges expected from it, and the constitutionality of the  
former | still regard as sustained by the considerations  
to — 1 yielded in giving my assent to the existing  
bank.  
  
The charge of inconsistency between my objection to  
the constitutionality of such a bank in 1791, and my as-  
sent in 1817, turns on the question, how far legislative  
precedents, expounding the constitution, ought to guide  
succeeding legislatures, and to overrule individual opi-  
nions.  
  
Some obscurity has been thrown over the question, by  
confounding it with the respect due from one legislature  
to laws passed by preceding legislatures. But the two  
cases are essentially different. A constitution being de-  
rived from a superior authority, is to be expounded and  
obeyed, not controled or varied by the subordinate au-  
thority of a legislature. A law on the other hand,  
resting on no higher authority than that possessed by  
every successive legislature, its expediency as well as its  
meaning is within the scope of the latter.  
  
The case in question has its true analogy in the obli-  
gation arising trom judicial expositions of the law on  
succeeding judges; the constitution being a law to the  
legislator, as the law is a rule of decision to the judge.  
  
And why are judicial precedents, when formed on due  
discussion and consideration, and deliberately sanctioned  
by reviews and repetitions, regarded as of binding in-  
fluence, or rather of authoritative force, in settling the  
meaning of aluw? I[t must be answered, ist. because  
it is a reasonable and established axiom,that the good of  
society requires that the rules of conduct of its mem-  
bers should be certain and known, which would not be  
the case if any judge, disregarding the decisions of his  
  
redecessors, should vary the rule of law according to  
his individual interpretation of it. Misera est servitus  
ubi jus est aut vagum aut incognitum, 2d. because an  
exposition of the law publicly made, and repeatedly  
confirmed by the constituted authority, carries with it,  
by fair inference, the sanction of those who, having  
made the law through their legislative organ, appear un-  
der such circumstances to have determined its meaning  
through their judiciary organ.  
  
Can it be of less consequence that the meaning of a  
constitution should be fixed and known, than that the  
meaning of a law should be so? Can indeed a law be  
fixed in its meaning anc operation, unless the constitu-  
tion be so? On the contrary, if a particular | gislature,  
differing in thé construction of the constitution, from a  
series of preceding constructions, proceed to act on that  
difference, they not only introduce uncertainty and insta-  
bility in the constitution, but in the laws themselves; in-  
asmuch as all laws preceding the new construction and  
inconsistent with it, are not only annulled for the future,  
but virtually pronounced nullities from the beginning.  
  
But it is said that the legislator having sworn to sup-  
port the constitution, must support it in his own con-  
struction of it, however different from that put on it  
by his predecessors, or whatever be the consequences  
of the construction. And is not the judge under the  
same oath to support the law? yet has it ever been  
supposed that he was required, or at liberty to disre-  
gard all precedents, however solemnly repeated and  
regularly observed; and by giving effect to his own ab-  
stract and individual opinions, to disturb the establish-  
ed course of practice in the business of the community?  
Has the wisest and most conscientious judge ever seru-  
pled to acquiesce in decisions in which he has been  
overruled by the mature opinions of the majority of his  
colleagues; and subsequently to conform hi mself thereto,  
  
  
  
as Lo authoritative expositions of the Jaw? And is it not rea-  
sonable that the same view of the official oath should be  
taken by a legislator, acting under the constitution, which  
is his guide, as is taken by a judge, acting under the  
law, which is his?  
  
There is in fact and in common understanding, a ne-  
cessity of regarding a course of practice, as above cha-  
racterised, in the light of a legal rule of interpreting a  
law: and there isa like necessity of considering it a con-  
stitutional rule of interpreting a constitution,  
  
That there may be extraordinary and peculiar eireum-  
stances controlling the rule in both cases, may be ad-  
mitied: but with such exceptions, the rule will force  
itself on the practical judgment of the most ardent  
theorist. He will find it impossible to adhere to, and  
act officially upon, his solitary opinions as to the mean-  
ing of the law or constitution, in opposition to a con-  
struction reduced to practice, during a reasonable period  
of time; more especially where no prospect existed of a  
change of construction by the public or itsagents. And  
if a reasonable period of time, marked with the usual  
sanctions, would not bar the individual prerogative, there  
could be no limitation to its exercise, although the dan-  
ger of error must increase with the increasing oblivion  
of explanatory circumstances, and with the continual  
changes in the import of words and phrases.  
  
Let it then be left to the decision of every iatelligent  
and candid judge, which, on the whole, is most to be re-  
lied on for the true and safe construction of a consti-  
tution, that which has the uniform sanction of successive  
legislative bodies through a period of years, and under  
the varied ascendancy of parties; or that which depends  
upon the opinions of every new legislature, heated as it  
may be by the spirit of party, eager in the pursuit of  
some favorite object, or led astray by the eloquence and

your former one of the 21st of Jan. last, were written  
in haste and in bad health; but*they expressed, tho’

tnbiished, axiom, that the good of society requires  
that the rules of conduct of its members should he

any judge, disregarding the decisions of his prede­

or­  
  
t an it hr of less consequence that the meanirrg

that the meaning of a law should he so? Can in­  
dood a law he fixed irj its meaning and operation,

Hut it is said that the legislator having sworn to

The act originally establishing a Bank hud under­  
gone ample discussions in its passage through tlio  
several brunches of the government. It had been  
carried into execution throughout a period of twen­  
ty years with annual legislative recognitions; in ono  
•••-lance indeed, with a positive ramification of it  
into a now State: and with the cniirC a.7“’,&#x27;csccncq  
of all the local authorities, as well as of the nation  
at large; to all of which may be added, a decreasing  
prospect of any change in the public opinion  
adverse to the constitutionality of such an institu­  
tion. A veto from the Executive under these cir­  
cumstances, with an admission of the expediency  
and almost necessity of tho measure, would havo  
been a defiance of all the obligations derived from  
a course of precedents amounting to tlio requisite  
evidence ol tlio national judgment and intention.  
It has been contended that tho authority of pre­  
cedents was in that case invalidated by the con­  
sideration that they proved only a respect for tho  
stipulated duration of the Bank, with a tolera­  
tion of it until the law should expire, and by tho  
casting vote given in the Senate by the Vice’Pres­  
ident in the year 1811, against a bill for establishing  
a National Bank, the vote being expressly inven  
on the ground of unconstitutionality. But if the law  
itself was unconstitutional the stipulation was void,  
and could not be constitutionally fulfilled or toler­  
ated. And as to the negative oftlio Senate by the  
casting vote of tho presiding office, it is a fact well  
understood at the time, that it resulted not from an  
equality ol opinions in that assembly on the powcv  
ot Congress to establish a Bank, but from a junction  
of those who admitted tho power, hut disapproved  
the piau, with those who denied the power. On a  
simple question of constitutionality, there was a de­  
cided majoritv in favor of it.

Montpelier, June *5, 1881.  
Dear Sir—I bars received your friendly  
letter of the 18th in»t. The few line* which  
answered your former one of the 21st of Jan­  
uary last, were written in baste and in bad  
health; but they expressed, though without  
the attention in some respecU due to the oc­  
casion, a dissent from the views of the Presi­  
dent, as to a Bank of the United States and a  
substitute for it; to which I cannot but ad­  
here. The objections to the Utter have ap­  
peared to me to preponderate greatly ov«r  
the advantages expected from it, and the con­  
stitutionality of tne former I still regard as  
sustained by the considerations to which 1  
yielded in giving my assent to the existing  
Bank.  
The charge of inconsistency between my  
objection to the constitutionality of such a  
hank in 1791, aft! my assent in 1S17, turns on  
the question, how far legislative expounding  
the constitution, ought to guide succeeding le­  
gislatures, and to overrule individual opinions.  
Some obscurity has been thrown over the  
question, by confounding it with the respect  
due from one legislature to laws passed by  
  
preceding legislatures, But the two cases are  
essentially different, A constitution being de­  
rived from a superior authority, is to be ex­  
pounded and obeyed, not controlled or varied  
by the subordinate authority oftbe legislature.  
A law, on the other hand,resting on no higher  
authority than that possessed by every suc­  
cessive legislature, its expediency as well as  
its meaning is within the scope of the latter.  
The casp in question has ijj true analogy  
intha obligation arising from judicial exposi­  
tions of the law on succeeding Judges; the  
constitution being a law to the legislator, as  
the law is a rule of decision to the Judge.  
And why arcj::d!c&#x27;al precedents, when for­  
med on due discussion and considtftation, and  
deliberately sanctioned by reviews and repe­  
titions, regarded as of binding influence, or  
rather of authoritative force, in settling the  
meaning of a law ? It must be answered, 1st,  
because it is a reasonable and established ax­  
iom, that tba good of society requires that the  
rules of conduct of its members should be  
certain and known, which would not be the  
case if any judge, disregarding the decisions  
of his predecessors, should vary the rule of  
law according to his individual interpretation  
of it. Misera est servitus ubi jus est aut vagum  
aut incognilum. Sd, because an exposition  
of tha law publicly made, and repeatedly  
confirmed by the constituted authority, car­  
ries with it, by fair inference, the sanction of  
those who,,having made the taw through  
their legislative organ, appear under such cir­  
cumstances to have determined its meaning  
through their judiciary organ.  
Can it be of less consequence that th&lt;  
meaning of a constitution should be fixed ant  
known, than that the meaning of* law shook  
be so? Can|indeed a law be fixed io^ iti  
meaning and operation, unless the constitu  
tion be so ? On the contrary, if a particulai  
..v legislature, differing in the construction of the  
&quot; constitution, from a series of the preceding  
constructions, proceed to act on that differ­  
ence; they jiot only intrtu,!lce uncertainty and  
in me Constitution, but in the raws  
themselves; inasmuch as all laws preceding  
the new construction and inconsistent with it,  
are not only annulled for the future, blit vir­  
tually pronounced nullities from the beginning.  
But it is said that the legislator having  
■worn to support the Constitution, must sup­  
port it in his own construction of it, however  
different from that put op it by his predecess­  
ors, or whatever be the consequences of the  
construction. And is not the Judge under  
tha same oath to support the law ? yet has  
it ever been supposed that he was required,or  
at liberty to disregard all precedents, howev­  
er solemnly repeated and regularly observed;  
end by giving effect to his own abstract and  
individual opinions, to disturb the established  
course of practice in the business of the com­  
munity ? Has the wisest and most consci­  
entious Judge ever scrupled (o acquiesce in  
decisions in which he has been overruled by  
the matured opinions of the majority of his  
colleagues; and subsequently to conform him­  
self thereto, as to authoritative expositions of  
the law ? And is it not reasonable that the  
same view of the official oath should be taken  
by a legislator, acting under the Constitution,  
which is his guide, as is taken by a Judge,act­  
ing under the law, which is his ?  
There is in fact and in common understand­  
s____« AA.,..A ArM.»A  
  
tice, as above characterized, in the light of a  
legal rule of interpreting a law : and there is a  
like necessity of considering it a constitution­  
al rule of interpreting a constitution.  
That there may be extraordinary and -pe­  
culiar circumstances controlling the rule in  
both cases, may be admitted; but with such  
exceptions, the rule will force itself on the  
practical judgment of the most ardent theo­  
rist. He will find it impossible to adhere to,  
and act officially upon, his solitary opinion*as  
to the moaning of the law or constitution, in  
opposition to a construction reduced to prac­  
tice, during a reasonable period of time;  
more especially where no prospect existed of  
a change of construction by the public or its  
agents. And if a reasonable period of time,  
marked with the usual sanctions, would not  
bar the individual prerogative, there could be  
no limitation to its exercise, although the  
danger of error must increase with the in­  
creasing oblivion of explanatory circumstan­  
ces, and with the continual changes in the im­  
port of words and phrases.  
Let it then be left to the decision of every  
intelligent and candid Judge, which, on ths  
whole, is most to be relied oo for the true and  
safe construction of a constitution, that which  
has the uniform sanction ofsuccessive legisla­  
tive bodies through a period of years, and un­  
der the varied ascendency of parties; or that  
which depends upon the opinions of every  
new legislature, heated as it may be by the  
spirit of party, eager in the pursuit of some  
favorite object, or led astray by the elo­  
quence ana addTess of popular statesmen,  
tncmselres, perhaps, under the influence oi  
the same misleading causes.  
It was in conformity with the view here ta  
ben, of the respect due to deliberate and reit  
crated precedents that the Bank of the Uni  
ted States, though on the original questtoi  
- held to be unconstitutional, received the Ex  
ecutive signature In the year 1817. The mi  
originally estabUslliog a Bank had undergoes  
ample discussions in its passa£ through ths  
  
several branches of the government. It had  
been carried into execution  
riod of twenty yenra, with  
recognitions; in one instaw  
positive ramification of it into a new state;  
and with the entire acquiescence of all the  
local authorities, as weH as of the nation at  
large; to all of which may be added, a de­  
creasing prospect of any change in the public  
opinion adverse to the constitutionality of  
such an institution. A veto from the Execu­  
tive under these circumstances, with an ad­  
mission of the expediency and {almost neces­  
sity of the measure, would have been a defi­  
ance of all the obligations derived from a  
course of precedents amounting to the requi­  
site evidence of the national judgment and in­  
tention.  
It has been contended that the authority  
of precedents was in that case invalidated by  
the consideration, that they proved only a  
respect for the stipulated duration of the  
Bank with a toleration of it until the law­  
should expire, and hy the casting vote given  
in the Senate hy the Vice President in the  
year 1811, against a hill for establishing the  
National Bank, Ihe vote being expressly giv­  
en on the ground of unconstitutionally. But if  
the law itself was unconstitutional,the stipula­  
linn woe v.iiil nml efiuYd not be constitution­  
  
ally fulfilled ur tolerated. And as to tbe  
negative of the Senate by the casting vote of  
the presiding officer, it is a fact well under­  
stood at the time, that it resulted not from  
an equality of opinions in that assembly on  
the power of Congress to establish a Bank,  
but from a junctiou of those who admitted  
the power, but disapproved the plan, with  
those who denied the power. On a simple  
question of constitutionality, there was a de­  
cided majority in favor of it.

Moutpelicr, June 25, 1831  
  
Dear Sin: I have reccived your  
friendly letter of the 18(h inst. The  
few lines which answered your former  
one of the 21st of January lust, were  
written in haste and in bad healthy but  
they expressed, though without the at­  
tention i =ome respects due to the oce­  
caston, a dissent from the views of the  
President, as toa Bank of the United  
States and a substitute for it, to which |  
cannot but adhere. The objections to  
the latter have appeared to me to pre­  
ponderate greatly over the advantages  
expected fromat, and the constitutionali-|  
ty of the former 1 sull regard as sus­  
tained by the considerations to which 1  
vielded in giving my assent to the ex­  
isting Bank. ’  
  
| T&#x27;he charge of inconsistency between  
‘my objection to the constitutionality of  
such a bank in 1791, and my assent  
in 1817, turns on the question, how far  
legislative precedents, expounding the  
‘constitution, ought to guide succeeding  
Hegislatures, and to overrule individual  
lopinions, T 3  
  
&quot; Some obseurity has heen thrown over  
the question, by eonfounding it with the  
respect due from one legislature to laws  
passed by preceding legislatures, But  
the two cascs are essentially different,  
A constitution being dervived from a  
superior authority, is to be expounded  
and obeyed; not controlled or varied,  
by the subordinate authority of a legis­  
lature. A law, on the other hand,  
resting on no higher authority than that  
possessed by every successive legisla­  
ture, its expediency, as well as its  
!mvuniug, is within the scope of the  
Jatter.  
  
i The case in question has its true  
analogy in the obligantion arising from  
udicial expositions of the law on suc­  
‘ceeding Judges; the constitution being  
‘a law to the legislator, as the law is a  
rule of decision to the Judge, ;  
’ And why are judicial precedents,  
&#x27;when formed on due discugsion and con­  
&#x27;sideration, and deliberately sanctioned  
by reviews and repetitions, regarded as  
’uf binding influence, or rather of au­  
thoritative force, in settling the mean­  
!ing of a law? It must be answered,  
| Ist, because it 1s a reasonable and es­  
tablished axiom, that the good of society ‘\
(requives that the rules of conduct ol  
lits members should be certain and  
known, which would not be the case if  
any judge, disregarding the decisions of  
his predecessors, should vary the rule of  
Jdaw according to his individual in­  
terpretation of it. Misera est servitus  
übi jus est aut vagum aut incognitum,—  
2d, because an exposition of the law  
publicly made, and repeatedly coafirm­  
ed by the constituted anthority, carries  
with ity by fair inference, the sanction of  
those who, having made the law through  
their legislative organ, appear, under  
such circumstances, to have determin­  
ed its meaning through their judiciary  
  
organ,  
; ‘Can it be of less consequence that  
the meaning of a constitution should be  
fixed and known, than that the meaning  
of a law should be s 0? Can indeed a  
law be fixed, in its meaning and opera­  
tion, unless the constitution be so? On  
the contrary, if a particular legislature,  
differing in the construction of the con­  
stitution, from a series of preceding con­  
structions, proceed to act on that differ­  
ence, they not only intreduce uncertain­  
ty and instability i the constitution, but  
in the laws themselves; inasmuch as  
‘all laws preceding the new construction  
and inconsistent with ity are not only an­  
nulled for the fature, but virtuaily pro­  
nounced nullities from the beginning.  
  
- But it is =aid that the legislator hav­  
ing sworn to support the Constitution,  
must support it in his own construction  
of it, however different from that put  
on it by his predecessors, or whatever  
be the consequences ol the construction,  
And is not the judge under the same  
oath to support the law? Yet has it  
ever been supposed that he was re­  
quired, or at liberty to disregard all  
precedents, however solemnly repeated  
and regularly observed; and by giving  
leffect to his own abstract and individual  
opinions, to disturb the established  
course of practise in the business of the  
&#x27;community? Has the wisest and most  
‘conscientious Judge ever scrupled to  
acquiesce in decisions in which he has  
‘been overruled by the matured opinions  
of the majority of his colleagnes; and  
‘subsgequently to conform himself thereto,  
‘as to authoritative expositions of the  
law? And is it not reasonable that the  
‘same view of the oflicial oath should  
be taken by a legislator, acting under  
the constitution, which is his guide, as  
is taken by a judge, acting under the  
law whicl is his? |  
  
&#x27; There is in fact and in common un­  
derstanding a necessity of regarding a  
course of practice, as above character­  
ized, in the light of&#x27;a legal rule of in­  
terpreting a law; and there is a like  
necessity of considering it a constitu­  
tional rule of interpreting a constitu­  
tion, l  
  
&quot; : !  
That there may be extraordinary and  
peculiar circumstances controlling thel  
ruie in both cases, may be admitted;—|

but with such exceptions, the rule will ;  
force itsell on the practical judgment of  
the most ardent theorist, “&#x27;u will find |  
it impossible to adhere to, and act  
officially upon, his solitary opinions as |  
to the meaning ol the law or constitu-&#x27;  
tion, in opposition to a construction re­

period of time; more especiaully where |  
no prospect existed of a change of con­

Aund it a reasonable period of limc,?

although the danger of error must in­  
crease with the mercasing oblivion of  
explunatory circumstances, and with  
the continual changes in the import of  
words and phrases, |  
  
Let it then be left to the decision of |  
every intelligent and candid Judge, !  
which, on the whole, is most to be rchied |  
on for the true and safe construction uf!  
a constitution, that which has the uni­  
form sanction of successive legislative |  
bodies through a period of years, and  
under the varied ascendancy of partics;|’  
or that which depends upon the opilnulls“  
of every new legislature, heated as it  
may be by the spirit of party, eager in  
the pursuit of some favorite object, or  
led astray by the eloquence and address,  
of popular statesmen, themselves, per­  
haps, under the influence of the same  
misleading causes, i  
It was in conformity with the vimv;

out a period of twenty years with annual  
legislative recognitions; in one instance  
indeed, with a positive ramificetion of it  
into a new State; and with the entire  
acquicscence of all the local authoritics’  
as well as of the nation at large; to all  
of which may be added, a decreasing  
prospect of any change in the public  
copimon adverse to the constitutionality  
of&#x27; such an institution. A veto from the  
lixecutive under these circumstances,  
with an admission of the expediency and  
almost necessity of the measure, would  
have been a defiance of all the obliga­  
tions derived from a course of precedents  
amounting to the requisite evidence of  
the national judgment and intention. ‘  
It hias been contended that the author-|  
ity of precedents was in that case inval-|  
idated by the consideration that they|

duration of the Bank, with a toleration|  
of it until the law should expire, and by  
the casting vote given in the Senate by |

a bill for establishing a National Bank, |  
the vote being expressly given on the

stipulation was void, and could not be  
constitutionally fulfilled or tolerated.—

it is a fact well understood at the time,  
that it resulted mot from an equality of

lo guid • succeeding legislatures, and lo overrule in­

Sums obreuri y ha* been thrown over the qiastion,  
by C&#x27;in&#x27;ounding it with he reepset due from one Irgir­  
la&#x27;.ure to law* passed by pr c ding I g datura*. But  
til* two cases are e**»oti By d tl-rent. A cot* i«nti m  
being tlerved from a superior authority, is to b* ex­  
pounded and obeyed, not controlled or varied by tie  
subordinate authoiliy of a legislature. A law on the  
other b.irv!, resting oo no higher authority »hau that  
possessed by every successive legislature, its expe.  
diency a* well as its mexiiiug is within (be scope of the  
lader.  
  
I he ease in question has its Ir» c analogy in the ob­  
ligation arising from judicial exposition* ol the law on  
succeeding Judge-; the coos&#x27;itiiiion beii g a lavs to the  
Icgi-dator, as liie law is a ml a ol decision to the J udge.  
And why ura judicial precedents, wh-n formed on  
du.- discussion and consideration, and deliberately runs­  
tinned by reviews and repetition&quot;, regarded as of bind­  
ing influence, or raiber of authoritative lone, in settling  
• he meaning of a lavs? It must be auiwered, 1st b(­  
cau*e it is a reasonable and established t.xiom, that the  
good ol sori-ty requites that the tulr.s ol rord icl of its  
tn&lt; mbers s..ould be c* r»xio and known, which woul*  
nil be lie ca&gt;e it any judge, dtsregaid ng the decision*

ding 10 his individual interpretation of it. Muera e.t

because an expo ilion of the law publiely made, end re­  
peatedly conb.iiud by the cousli u*ed autfori y, carries  
with it, by talr lui-icnee, the irnc ion cf din * who  
having iwade th* law through their legislative organ,  
aj pecr under such circumstances to hsve determined  
i r meaning through their judiciary organ.  
Can it be of le .s rous-quecce that me meaning ol a  
constitution should be fixed and known, than that the  
meaning ol a law should be • u? Can indeed a law be  
b.xed in its meaning ai d operatiou, unless (be connim­  
tioi bo so? O.i the contrary, if a particular legislature,  
diff-ring in the construction of the constitution, from a  
series of preceding coustruet’orss, proceed to act on thai  
dil!*rence, they not only inl’oduce un ertain y and in­  
stability in the constitution, but in the laws theinse ve*;  
inasmuch as all l?ws precedit g the n-w construction  
and inconsistent with it, are not only enniilled for tbe  
lu tire, but vitlu.tlly piououuce.l nullities (run the be­  
gitdng

• ;t union of it, however diffiren from that put on it by  
Ins predecessors, or whatever be the coi s quences o&gt;  
•h&quot; construction. And is not the Judge under the same  
oaib to support the law? yet has it ever been supposed  
that he was required, or at liberty to disregard all pre­  
cedents, however solemnly repeated and regtii uly ob­  
served; and by giving rff-ct to hi* own an,tract and in  
dividual opinions, to disturb the estah!i&lt;bed course ol

i uat there may bs extraordinary and peculiar cir­

the reaped due lo deliberate and reitera&#x27;ed preced me,  
that tbe Bank of the United Stales, though on the ori­  
ginal question held to he unconstitutional, received he  
Execn Ive signature in ihe year 1817. The act origin­  
ally establi-hing Dank had undergone ample di*eursi*ons

decreasing prtspeet of any change in the public opinion  
adverse to the cnrliliilionaliiy of such an in*ti&#x27;ution.  
A vmo from Ihe Eterutive under these clrcuiiistmce*,

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
Montpelier, June 25, 1821.  
  
Dear Sir—I have received your friendly letter of the  
18th instant. The few lines which answered your form-  
er one of the 21st of January last, were written in haste  
and in bad health; but they expressed, though without  
the attention in some respects due to the occasion, a  
dissent from the views of the President, as to a Bank of  
the United States and a substitute for it, to which I can-  
not but adhere. Tie objections to the latter have ap-  
peared to me to preponderate greatly over the advan-  
tages expected from it, and the constitutionality of the  
former I still regard as sustained, by the considerations  
to which I yielded in giving my assent to the existing  
Bank,  
  
The charge of inconsistency between my objection  
to the constitutionslity of such a bank in 1791, and my  
assent in 1817, turns on the question, how far leyislative  
precedents, expounding the constitution, ought to guide  
succeeding legislatures and to overrule individual opi-  
nions.  
  
Some obscurity has been thrown over the question,  
by confounding it with the respect due from one legis-  
  
|  
  
-lature to laws passed by preceding legislatures. But  
  
the two cases are essentially different. A constitution  
being derived from a superior authority, is to be ex-  
  
SS  
  
possessed by every successive legislature, its expedien-  
cy, as well as its meaning, is within the scope of the  
latter,  
  
The case in question, has its true analogy in the ob-  
ligation arising trom judicizl expositions ot the law on  
siccecding judges—the constitution being a law to the  
legislator, as the law isa rule of decision to the judge.  
  
And why are judicial precedents, when formed on  
due discussion and consideration, and deliberately sanc-  
tioned by reviews and repetitions, regarded as of bind-  
ing influence, or rather of authoritative force, in settling  
the meaning of a law? It must be answered: first, be-  
cause it is a reasonable and establ shed axiom, that the  
good of society requires that the rules of conduct of its  
members should be certain and known, which would  
not be the case if. any judge, disregarding the decisions  
of his predecessors, should vary the rule of law accord-  
ing to his individual interpretation of it. Misera est  
servitus ubi jus est aut vagum aut incognitum., Second,  
because an exposition of the law publicly made, and  
repeatedly confirmed by the constituted authority, car-  
ries it with, by fair inference, the sanction of those, who,  
having made the law through their legislative organ,  
appear under such circumstances to have determined  
its meaning through their judiciary organ.  
  
Can it be of less consequence, that the meaning of a  
constitution should be fixed and known, than the mean-  
ing of a law should be so? Can indeed a law be fixed  
in its meaning, and operation, unless the constitution be  
so? On the contrary, if a particular legislature, differ-  
ing in the construction of the constitution, from a series  
of preceding constructions, proceed to act on that dif-  
ference, they not only introduce uncertainty and insta-  
bility in the constitution, but in the laws themselves;  
inasmuch as all laws preceding the new construction,  
and inconsistent with it, are not only annulled for the  
future, but virtually pronounced nullities from the be-  
ginning.  
  
But it is said, that the legislator having sworn to sup-  
port the constitution, must support it in his own con-  
struction of it, however different from that put on it by  
his predecessors, or whatever be the consequences of  
the construction. And is not the judge under the same  
oath to support the law? yet has it ever been supposed  
that he was required, or at liberty, to disregard all pre-  
cedents, however solemnly repeated and regularly ob-  
served; and by giving effect to,his own abstract and in-  
dividual opinions, to disturb the established course of  
practice in the business of the community? Has the  
wisest and most conscientious judge ever scrupled to  
acquiesce in decisions, in which he has been overruled  
by the matured opinions of the majority of his col-  
leagues, and subsequently to conform himself thereto,  
as to authoritative expositions of the law’ And it is not  
reasonable that the same view of the official oath should  
be taken by a legislator, acting under the constitution,  
which is his guide, as is taken by a judge, acting under  
the law which is his?  
  
There is, in fact, and in common understanding, a  
necessity of regarding a course of practice, as above  
characterized, in the light of a legal rule of interpreting  
a law; and there is a like necessity of considering it a  
constitutional rale of interpreting a constitution.  
  
That there may be extraordinary and peculiar circum.  
stances, controlling the rule in both cases, may be ad-  
mitted; but, with such exceptions, the rule will force  
itself on the practical judgment of the most ardent theo-  
rist. He will find it impossible to adhere to, and act  
officially upon his solitary opinions, as to the meaning  
of the law or constitution, in opposition to a construc-  
tion reduced to practice, during a reasonable period of  
time; more especially, where no prospect existed of a  
change of construction by the public or its agents. And  
if a reasonable period of time, marked with the usual  
  
pounded and obeyed, net controlled or varied by the | sanetions, would not bar the individual prerogative, there  
subordinate authority of a legislature, A Jaw, on the | could be no limitation to its exercise, although the dan

1 one, from all quarters of the civilized world, and of  
  
that the Bank of the United States, though on the ori- | ec

Executive signature in the year 1817, The act origin-| ‘There are four furnaces, a bloomery, and two forges,

A veto from the Executive, under these circumstances,  
with an admission of the expediency, and almost neces-  
sity ef the measure, would have been a defiance of all  
the obligations derived from a course of precedents,  
amounting to the requisite evidence of the national

that they proved only a respect for the stipulated dura. |

should expire, and by the casting vote given in the  
Senate, by the Vice President, in the year 1811, against  
a bill for establishing a National Bank, the vote being  
expressly given on the ground of unconstitutionality. |

jections to the latter have appeared to me to  
preponderate greatly over the advantages ex  
  
pected from it, and the constitutionality of the  
former I still regard as sustained by the con  
  
siderations to which! I yielded in giving my  
assent to the existing Sank. i  
The charge of inconsistency between my  
objection to the constitutionality of such a bank  
  
in 17U1, and my assent m 1817, turns on the  
  
question, ; how far legislative precedents, ex­  
pounding the constitution, ouffht to guide suc  
  
ceeding TegislatuTes, and to overrule individual  
&#x27; opinions. , j ;- j  
; Some obscurity. lias been thrown over the  
question, by confounding lit with the ; respect  
due from one legislature to laws passed by  
preceding legislatures. But the two eases are  
.essentially different A constitution being de­  
rived from a superior authority, is to be ex­  
pounded and obeyed, not controlled or varied  
bvthe subordinate authority of a legislature.  
  
A law, on the other hand; resting on no higher  
  
authority than that possessed by every succes  
  
! Kivn legislature.&#x27; its expediency, as well as its  
  
w - o &#x27; a - w  
.meaning, is within the scope of the latter.  
  
j 1 The case in question has its true analogy  
  
in the obligation arising from judicial exposi­  
tions of the law on succeeding judges: the  
  
- constitution being a law to the legislator, as  
  
the, law is a rule f of decision to the Judge.  
And why pre judicial precedents, when for  
  
med on due discussion and consideration, and  
  
deliberately sanctioned by reviews and repeti  
  
t tipns, regarded as of binding, influence, or ra-  
  
mer oi autnpruauve lorce, in settling tne mean

Constitution, is our sacred and imperishable aim&#x27; -We  
shall not stoop to make further professions of our attach­  
ment to the Union. This has been conclusively shewn in  
  
our past conduct, as well as by that forbearance wihich  
  
our  
  
known, which would not be the case, if any  
  
judge, disregarding the decisions of his prede­  
cessors, should vary the rule of law according  
  
io his individual interpretation of it. Misera  
  
est scrvitus ubi jus est aut vagum aut incogni  
  
turn. 2d, because an exposition of the law,  
publicly made and repeatedly confirmed by the  
constituted authority, carries with it, by fair  
inference, the sanction of those who, having  
inade the law through their legislative organ,  
&quot;appear. unHcr such circumstances to have de­  
termined its meaning , through their judiciary  
organ. , . . ; &quot; .&quot;t .  
j Can it be of less consequence that the mean­  
ing -of a constitution should be fixed and known,  
  
than that the meaning of a law should -be so ?  
Can indeed . a law be fixed in its meaning. and  
operation, unless the constitution be so? On  
the contrary if a particular legislature, differ­  
ing in the construction of the constitution, from  
a series of preceding constructions, proceed  
to act on that difference, they not only intro  
  
duce uncertainty and : instability in the consti­  
tution, but in , the laws themselves; inasmuch  
as all laws preceding thp new construction and  
j Inconsistent with it, ard not only annulled for  
the future, but virtually pronounced nullities  
from the beginning. -  
  
But it is said that the legislator having sworn  
  
to support the Constitution, must support it in  
his own construction of it, however different  
  
from, that piat oh by his predecessors, or what  
  
ever be the consequences of the construction.  
And is not the judge under the same oath to  
support the law ? yet has it ever been supposed j  
that he was required, or at liberty to disregard  
all precedents, however solemnly repeated and  
regularly observed; and by giving effect to his  
own. abstract and individual opinions, to dis­  
turb tho established course of practice in the  
business of the community ? Has the wisest  
and most conscientious Judge ever scrupled  
to acquiesce in decisions in which- he has been  
overruled by the matured opinions of the ma­  
jority of his colleagues; and subsequently to  
  
conform himself thereto, as to authoritative  
  
expositions- of the law ? And is it not reasona  
  
ble that the same view of the official oath  
  
should be taken by a legislator, acting under  
the constitution, which is his guide, as is taken  
by a judge,, acting under the law which is his?  
There is in fact and in common understan  
  
ding, a &quot;necessity of regarding a course ofprac  
  
lice, as above characterized, in the light of a  
  
legal rule of interpreting a law; and there is a  
like necessity of considering it a constitutional  
  
rule of interpreting a constitution.  
That there may be extraordinary and peculi  
  
ar circumstances jcotrolling the rule in both  
  
cases, may be admitted; but with such excep  
  
tions, thje rule will force itself on the practical  
judgment of ihe most ardent theorist. He  
  
will find it impossible to adhere to, and act  
  
officially upon, his solitary opinions as to the  
meaning of the law or constitution, in opposi  
  
tion to a construction reduced to practice,  
  
f durinsr a reasonable period of time : more cspeci-  
  
; ally where no prospect existed of a change of  
  
Construction by the public or its agent6. And  
  
if a reasonable period of time, marked? with the  
usual sanctions, would not bar the individual  
prerogative, there could be no limitation to its  
xercise, although the danger of error must

tory circumstances, and -with the continual  
&#x27; hangds in the impbrt of words and phrases.

amounting to the requisite evidence of the na  
tinnnl iuHo-ment and intention.  
  
It has been contended that the authority of  
  
nreeedents was m that case invalidated by the  
  
consideration that they proved only a respect  
  
for the stipulated duration of the Bank, with atol  
  
eration of it until the law should expire, and by  
  
the casting vote given in the Senate by the Vice  
  
President in the year 1811 againsta bill for  
establishing &#x27;a National Bank, the vote being  
  
expressly given on the ground of uncohstitu  
tionality. But if the law itself was unconstitu  
  
tional the stipulation was void and could not  
  
be constitutionally fulfilled or tolerated. And  
  
as to the negative of the Senate by the casting  
  
vote of the presiding officer, it is a fact will nn-  
  
derstood at the time, that it resulted not from  
  
an equality of opinions in that assembly on the  
  
power of Congres to establish a Bank, but  
from a iunction of those who admitted the  
  
power, but disapproved the plan, with those  
  
who denied the power. On a simple question  
  
of constitutionality, there was a decided majo  
sity in favor of it. JAMES MADISON

&#x27; &#x27; ; Moviprfier, June 25, 1831.  
DeahSir -I have received your friend­  
ly letter of the 18th inst. The few lines  
which answered your former one of the  
21st of January last, were written in baste  
and in bad health : but they expressed  
though, without the attention in so.i:e res­  
pecs due to the occasion, a dissent from  
the views of the President, as to a Bank  
of the United States and a substitute for  
it ; to whicn I cannot but adhere The  
objections to the latter have appeared to  
me to preponderate greatly over the ad­  
vantage expected, from it, and the con­  
stitutionality of &#x27;he firmer I still regard  
as sustained by the considerations to which  
I yielded in giving my assent to the ex­  
isiingBank. s  
The charge of inconsistency between  
my objection to the constitutionality of  
sich a bank in 1791, and toy assent in  
1817,&#x27;turns on the question, how far le­  
gislative precedent?, expounding the con­  
stitution, ought to guide succeeding legis­  
latures, and to overrule individual opiu  
ions, j &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;. ( .  
Some obscurity has been thrown over  
the question by confounding it with the  
respect due from one legislature to laws  
passed by preceding legislature. But  
the two cases are essentially -dilferent. .  
A constitution beins derived from a.snpe-T  
ri&#x27;or aa ttiority, .is to be expounded anl 0­  
beyed, not coittrolied or varied by the  
.subordinate aulhprity of a legislature. A  
law on the. other hand, resting on no high­  
er authority than that possessed by every  
successive legislature, its&quot; &#x27;-expediency- as  
wen as its meaning is vvithinjiie scope ol  
the latter: &#x27;&#x27; &#x27;; &#x27; . &#x27; v .&#x27; , &#x27;  
Tite case in.question- has its true ao&#x27;al-t.  
ogy in the obligation ai iing from judici­  
al expositions of: the law; on succ ceding  
judges ; the constitution being a; law to  
the legislator, ias the law, is a rule of tleci­  
sion&#x27;to the Jud&#x27;jre. ? , &#x27;  
And vhy are judicial precedents, when  
formed on due discussitnij and considera­  
tion, and deliberately sanctioned by, re­  
view and repetitious, regarded as of bind­  
ing influence,! or ratner &#x27; of autltOritative  
forces in settling. the. meaning of a law ?  
it must be answei ed 1st, because it is a  
reasonable and estabiished axiom, that the  
gtiod of sticiety. requires that the rules of  
conduct of itsimembers should,be certain  
antl kiniwn, which would tint be the case  
if any judge dfsregardiog the decisions of  
.ids predecessors, should vary the rule of

the con stitu tion be so ? On 1 he contrary,  
if a particular legislature, differing in ihe  
construction of the constitution, from a  
Series: of preceding constructions, proceed  
to act on that difference, they not only in

by giving elfsct to his own abti,ct and

acquiesce in decisions m wnicn ne na  
been overrruled by the matured, opinions  
of thef( majority of his colleagues ; and  
subsequently to conform himself thereto,  
as to authoritative expositions of the law?  
And is it not reasonable that r the same  
view of the official oath should be taken,  
by a legislator, acting under the Consti­  
tution, which is his guide,-as is taken by  
a Judyre, acting under the law,  
which is  
his? j , - :  
There is a fact and in comtnon under-(  
standinj, a necessity of regarding a course  
of practice as above characterized, in the  
light of a legal rule of interpreting a law:  
and there is a lile necessity of consider­  
ing it a constitutional rule pf interpret­  
ing a constitution.  
That there may be extraordinary and  
peculiar circumstances controlling the  
rule in both cases, may be admitted ; but  
with such exceptions, the rule will force  
itself on the practical judgment of the  
most ardent theorist. He will find it im­  
possible to adhere to and act officially up­  
on, his solitary opinions as to the mean­  
ing of the law or constitution,&#x27; in opposi­  
tion to a construction reduced to practice  
&#x27;during a reasonable period of time ; more  
especially uhere no prospect existed of a  
change of construe! ion by the publicjbr  
its agents. And if a reasonable period of  
time, marked w;th the usual sanctions,  
would not bar the individual prerogative,  
there could be no limitation to its exer­  
cise, although the danger: of error-must  
increase with the increasing oblivion of  
explanatory circumstances, &#x27;and with the  
continual changes in the Uoport of words  
and phrases. -  
Let it then be left to Ihe decision of e­  
very intelligent and candid jude, which,  
on the &quot;whole, is most to be reiied on for  
the truth and safe construction of a con­  
stitution, that which has the uniform  
sanction of successive legislative bodies  
through a period of years, and under the  
varied ascendancy of parties ; or that  
which depends upon the. opinions of eve­  
ry new legislature, heated as it may be  
by &#x27;he spirit of party, eager in the pursuit  
of some favorite object, or led astray by  
the eloquence and address; of popuiar  
statesmen, themselves, perhaps, &#x27; under  
the influence of the same misleading cau­  
ses. &#x27; ;....;!  
It wa9 in conformity with the view here  
taken, of the respect due to deliberate &amp;  
reiterated precedents, that i the Bank o!  
the United States, though on; the original  
question held to be tin-constitution.! 1, re­  
ceived the Executive signature in the year  
1817. The act originally establishing a  
fBank had undergone ample discussions  
in its passage through&#x27; the, several branch­  
es of the Government, lit had been car­  
ried into executitin&quot;thrtighout a period of  
t wen ty years yith annual legislative re­  
cognitions, in oDe instance .indeed,- with  
a positive ramification of it into a new  
State j aA&#x27;d with the entire acquiescence  
of all the local authorities,, as well -as of  
the nation at Jarge-; to all of which may­  
be added, a decreasing prospect of any  
change in the public opinion adverse ! to&#x27;  
the constitutionality of such an instituti­  
on. &#x27; A veto, from the Executive under  
th e s e c i rcum stab c es, w i th an ad mi ssi on

of all the obligations derived from a course

MONTPFI.il It, JUNE ‘25, 1831.  
Dear Sin—I hate received your  
friendly letter of the 18th inst. The  
lew lines which answered your note of  
the 21st of January last, were* written  
in haste and in bad health : but they  
exnressrd. thuuirh w ithout the attention  
  
in some respects due to the occasion,  
a dissent from the views of the 1’iesi­  
dent, as to a Hank of the United States  
and a substitute for it; to which I can­  
not but adhere. The objections to the  
latter have appeared to me to prepon­  
derate greatly over the advantages ex­  
pected fiom it, and the constitution­  
ality of the fuimrr I shall regard as  
sustained by the considerations to  
which 1 yielded in giving my assent to  
the existing bank.  
The charge of inconsistency between  
my objection to the constitutionality  
oi sih.Ii a bank in lT&#x27;Jl and my absent  
in lblT, turns on the q«/estion, hew  
far legislative precedents, expoundit g  
the constitution, ought to guide suc­  
ceeding legislatures, and to o\cri ulc ic­  
tlividual opinions.  
Some obscurity has been thrown  
over the question, hy confounding it  
with the respect due lroin ore legisla­  
ture to law* passed by preceding legis­  
latures. lint the two cases are essen­  
tially different. A constitution being  
derived from a superior authority, is to  
be expounded and obeyed, not con­  
trolled or varied bv tho subordinate  
authority of a legislature. A law ou  
tho other hand, resting on no higher  
aulhotity than that possess*d by every  
successive legislature* its expediency  
as well as its meaning is within the  
scope of the latter.  
The case ill question has its true  
analogy in tho obligation arising from  
judicial expositions «&gt;t the law of suc­  
ceeding Judges; the constitution be­  
ing a law to the legislator, as the law  
is a rule of decision to the Judges.  
Alltl tidft V in* tllilinial Iin&gt;r eiloriL  
  
when formed on due discussion and  
consideration, and deliberately sanc­  
tioned by reviews and repetitions, re­  
garded as of binding influence, or  
rather of authoritative force, in settling  
the meaning of a law ? It must be an­  
sweicil, 1st, because it is a reasonable  
and established axiom, that the good ot  
society requires that the rule* of con­  
duct of its members should be certain  
and known, which would not be the  
case if any judge, disregarding the de­  
cisions of his predecessors, should vary  
the rule of law accotdmg to hi* indi­  
vidual interpretation of it. Mi»era est  
servitus ubi jus est aut vagum aut in­  
cognitum. 2d, because an exposition  
of the law publicly made, and repeat­  
edly cun firmed by the constituted au­  
thority, cariies with it, bv fair infer­  
rnre, the ftancliou of those&#x27;who, having  
made the law through their legislative  
mgan, appear undei su«h circumstan­  
ces to have determined it* meaning  
through their judii lary organ.  
Can it be ol le*s runsequenrr lliat  
the meaning of a constitution should  
tia fixed and known, fhsn that the  
meaning of a law should he so? (&#x27;an  
indeed a law lie tiled to its meaning  
and operation, unless the constitution  
be so? On the contrary, if a particular  
legislature, diftVimg in the innstiuc­  
tmn of ihe constitution, from a senes  
of preceding constructions, proceed to  
ait Mi that difference, they not mb  
introduce uncertainty and tn*t»b ||ty ,n  
the constitution, but in Ihe laws litem­  
wl»e« | inasmuch a* all laws preceding  
tt*e new const* net ton and tm onsiatent  
&#x27;Mb t*, are nut nnty aci.fcJed f^ tb©  
  
luturc, but virtually prouounced nulli­  
ties Iruin tin* beginning.  
Hilt It is Haul that the Irgislati.r h*v -  
ing sw urn to support the &lt; or&gt;s&#x27;-.»nt|or».  
must support it in his own constnn -  
lion. And is nut the judge under if**  
same oatb t«» support the law ? Vet I..»h  
it ever been supposed that la* was rr  
&lt;|Uired, or at iibeity to t&#x27;utOj&#x27;aril all  
precedents,howev er solemnly repeated  
an«l regularly observed ; anti b\ giving  
effect to his own abstrat t and null  
vidual &#x27;.ipinion»,to distui b the e Salt!  
cd rouise of practice in the businrs-.  
ol the community? lias the wi*.e*t  
an«l most conscientious judge ever ** m  
plrul to acquiesce in decisions in win* !*  
he has been overrulrtl by the matured  
opinions «»l the majority ol lus col­  
leagues; and subsequently to conform  
hiinsetf thereto, as to authoritative ex­  
position* ol the law ? And is it rn.r  
ieasonable that the same view of the  
official oath should be taken l»v a login  
lator, acting under the Constitution,  
which IS Ills guide, as is taken bv a  
judge, acting under the law, which is  
hi* ?  
I herc is in fact and in common un­  
derstanding, a necessity ol regarding  
a course of piacticc, ns above charac  
tended, in the light of a legal lute ni  
interpreting a law ; and there i- a I.h«*  
necessity of considering it a const.tu­  
tumal rule of interpreting a constiufion.  
That there uiav be extranrdmarv  
and peculiar circumstances controlling  
he tule in both cases, may be admit­  
ted j but with such exceptions, the t ule  
Will force Itself on the practical judg­  
ment of the most ardent theorist. II.;  
will find it impossible to adhere to,  
and set officially upon, his solifaiy  
  
as iu mr meaning hi tiie law  
or constitution, in opposition to a ct u  
biruction reduced to practice, during  
a reasonable period of time; inure &lt; ■T  
pecially where no prospect existed ol a  
change of construction by the public or  
its agents. And if a leasouablo peri­  
od ol time, marked with the usu^i  
sanctions, would not bar the indivitlu­  
al prerogative,there could be no litnita  
lion to its exercise, although the dan­  
ger ol error must increase with ths in­  
creasing oblivion of explanatory c i»  
curustanccs, and with the continual  
changes in the import of words and  
phrases.  
I.ct it then be lift to the decision of  
c\ery intelligent and caudid judge ;  
which, on the whole cart bo relied i u  
lor the true anti safe construction of .*  
constitution, that which has theunifon t  
sanction of successive legislat.vo bod .e -  
through a period of years, anti ui du­

erC ressed, though without the attention in

a i y of the former 1 &#x27; su.ie.neu  
g considerations to whidi J wjded g.v­  
;, mv assent to tho existing Bank.  
The charge of inconsistency between xtiy d-  
tion t0 the constitutionality of such a bank iS  
J i accent in 1817. turns on the aues-  
1 Til 1 HI1U HI T &#x27; &quot; ------  
If  
i how far legislative precedents, expounding  
institution, ought to guide succeeded legis-  
tion,  
the  
i ...ri and to overrule individual opinions.  
Some obscurity has been thrown over the ques­  
tion by confounding it with the respect due from  
ono &#x27;legislature to laws passed by preceding legis­  
laturcs. But the two cases are essentially diffe­  
rent. A constitution being derived from a supe­  
rior authority, is to bo expounded and obeyed,  
not controlled or varied by the subordinate  
authority of a legislature. A law, on the other  
hand, resting on no higher authority than that  
possessed by evory successive legislature, its ex­  
pediency as well as its meaning is within the  
scope of the latter.  
The case in question hasJts true analogy in  
the ebligation arising from judicial expositions  
nf the law on succeeding Judges ; the constitution  
being a law to the legislator, as the law is a rule  
of decision to the Judge.  
n3 why are luuicial precedents, when form  
ed on due discussion and consideration, and de­  
liberately sanctioned by reviews and repetitions  
regarded ns of binding influence, or rathor pf  
authoritative force, in settling the meaning of a  
luiv? It must be answered, 1st, because it is a  
reasonable and established axiom, that the good  
of society requires that the rules of conduct of  
its members should be certain and known, which  
would not be tho case if any judge, disregarding  
the decision of his predecessors, should vary the  
rulo of law according to his individual interpre  
tation of it. Misera est scrvitus ubi jus est aut  
vaeum aut incognitum. 2d, because an exposition  
of tho law publicly made, and repeatedly con  
firmed by the constituted authority, carries with  
it, by fair inference, the sanction of those who,  
having made the law through their legislative or­  
gan, appear under such circumstances to have  
uotermimd its meaning through their judiciary  
organ.  
Can it be of less conscquenco that tho meaning  
of a constitution should be fixed and known,  
than that the meaning of a law should be so ? Can  
indeed a law be fixed in its meaning and opera­  
tion, unless the constitution be so 1 On the con­  
trary, if a particular legiilature, differing in the  
construction of the constitution, from a scries of  
preceding constructions, proceed to act on that  
difference, they not only introduce uncertainty  
and instability in the constitution, but in tho laws  
themselves ; inasmuch as all laws preceding the  
new construction and inconsistent with it, are  
nnt only annullod for the future, but virtually  
pronounced nullities from the beginning.  
But it is said that the legislator having sworn  
to support the Constitution, must support it in  
his own construction of it, however different from  
thai put on it by his predecessors, or whatever  
bo the consequence of the construction. And is  
r.ot the Judge under the same oath te support  
the law ? yet has it ever been supposed that he  
was required, or at liberty to disregard all pre­  
cedents, however solemnly repeated and regular­  
ly observed : and by giving effect to his own ab­  
stract and individual opinions, to disturb the es  
tablished course of practice in the business of  
the community T Has the wisest and most con­  
scientious Judge ever scrupled to acquiesce in  
decisions in which he has been arerruled by the  
matured opinions of th majority of his col­  
league; St subsequently to conform himself there  
to, as to auth native expositions of the lawt  
And is it not reasonable that the same view of  
the official eath should be takon by a legislator,  
acting under the Constitution, which is his guide,&quot;  
as is taken by a Judge, acting under the law,  
wnrni is nis t-  
There is in fuet and in common understand­  
ing, a necessity of regardinc a course of prac  
tice, us above characterized, in the light of a  
leg&quot; rule of intemretinfr n law : and there is  
Ms necessity of considering it n constitutional  
uie ot interpreting n constitution.  
TL.. 1 . &#x27; . .  
si mere may be extraordinary and peculiar  
tfcumstinces controlling tho rule in both cases,  
may be admitted : but with such exceptions, the  
run will forco itself on tho practical judgment  
v we raest ardent theerst. He wil Bad it im  
possible te adhere to, and act officially upon, his  
miliary opinions as to the meaning of the lav&quot;1  
onstitutin, in opposition to a construct.&quot;-&#x27;&quot; re&quot;  
(ducsd to practice, during a reasonable .srl0  
iime; mere especially where no prrt)BCt. existed  
ef a change of construction by tf Pbhc or

must increase with H increasing oblivion of ex­  
planatory circumsvaes, and with the continual  
changes in the imp&quot;&#x27; f words and phrases.

struction of a consutuint that which has th)j  
  
  
uniform sanction of successive legislative bodies  
inrougii a penoa oi years, and under the varied  
ascendency of parties ; or that which depends  
upon me opinions oi evory new legislature, heat  
ed as it may do Dy me spirit ol party, eager in the  
pursuit oi some iavorue ooject, or led astray by  
ihe eloquence and address of popular statesmen  
themselves, perhaps, under the influence of the  
same misleading causes.  
It was in conformity with the view hero taken.  
oi me respeci aue 10 aeiioerate and reiterated  
precedents that the Bank of the United States  
mougn en me original question held to be un­  
constitutional, received the Executive sienaturo  
in the year 1817. The act originally establish­  
ing a Bank had undergone ample discussions in  
its passage through the several branches of tho  
government.  
It had been carried into execution throughout  
a period of twenty yean, with annual legislative  
recognitions; in one instance indeed, with a posi­  
tive ramification of it into a new State ; and with  
the entire acquiescence of all the local authori  
ties, as well as of the nation at large ; to all of  
which may oe added, a decreasing prospect of  
any change in the public opinion adverse to the  
constitutionality of such an institution. A veto  
frdt) ihe Executive under these circumstances,  
with an actnittion of the expediency and almost  
necessity of thtJ measure, would have been a  
defiance of all the obligations derived from a  
course of precedents amounting to the requisite  
evidence of the national judgment and intention.  
It has been contended that the authority of  
precedents was In that case invalidated by the  
consideration, that they proved only a respect  
for the stipulated duration of the Bank, with a  
toleration of it until the law should expire, and  
by the casting vote given in the Senate by the  
Vice President in the year 1811, against a bill  
for establishing a National Bank, tlio VOlO being  
expressly given on the ground of unconstitution­  
ality. But if the law itself was unconstitutional,  
the stipulation was void, and could not be con­  
stitutionally fulfilled or tolerated. And as to the  
negative of the Senate by the casting vote of the  
presiding officer, it is a fsct well understood at  
the time, that it resulted not from an equality ef  
opinions in that assembly on the power of Con­  
gress to establish a Bank, but from a junction of  
those who admitted the power, but disapproved  
the plan, with those who denied the power. On  
a simple question ef constitutionality, there was  
a decided majority in favor of it.  
Mrs. Madi.on joins me in hoping that you will  
not fail to make the intended visit to Virginia,  
which promises us the pleasure of welcoming  
you to ourdoinicil, and in a sincere return of all  
the good wishes you kindly express for us.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Mostpelieh, June 25,1831.  
  
Dear Sirt I have received your friendly letter ol  
the 18th inst; The few lines which* answered your  
forrtlleVone of the 21st of January last, were written  
m haste and in bad health; but they expressed,though  
without the attention in some respects due to the oc­  
casion, a dissent from the views of the President, as  
to a Bank of the United States and a substitute for  
it; to which 1 cannot but adhere. The objections to  
the latter have appeared to me to preponderate great­  
ly over the advantages expected from it, and the con­  
stitutionality of the former I still regard as sustained  
by the considerations to which I yielded in giving  
my assent to the,existing Bank.  
The charge of inconsistency between my objec­  
tion to tli« constitutionality of such a bank in 1791  
and my assent in 1817, turns on &#x27;the question, how  
far legislative precedents, expounding the constitu­  
tion, ought to guide succeeding legislatures,vriand to  
Over-rule individual opinions.  
Some obscurity lias been thrown over the ques­  
tion. by confounding •* with tho rpspftct duo from  
one legislature to laws passed by preceding legis­  
latures. But the two cases are essentially different.  
A constitution;being derived from a superior au­  
thority, is to be expounded and obeyed, not controll­  
ed or varied by the subordinate authority of a legis­  
lature. A law on the other hand, resting on no  
higher authority than that possessed by every succes­  
sive legislature, its expediency as well as its mcan­  
ingis within the scope of the latter.  
The case in question has its true analogy in the  
obligation arising from judicial expositions of the  
law on succeeding Judges; the constitution being a  
law to the legislator, as tho law is a rule of decision  
to the Judge.  
And why are judicial precedents, when formed on  
due discussion and consideration, and deliberately  
sanctioned reviews and repetitions, regarded as of  
binding influence or rather of authoritative force, in  
settling the meaning of a law ? It must be answered,  
1st. because it is a reasonable and established uxiom,  
that the good of society requires that the rules of con­  
duct of its members should be certain and known,  
which would not be the case if any judge, disregard­  
ing the decision of Ins predecessors, should vary the  
rule of law according to his individual interpretation  
of it. Misera est servitus ubi jus est aut vagum aut  
incognitum. 2d, because an exposition of the law  
publicly made and repeatedly confirmed by ihe con­  
stituted authority carries with it, by fair inference,  
the sanction of those who, having made the law  
through their legislativc&#x27;organ appeur under such cir­  
cumstances to have determined its meaning through  
their judiciary organ.  
Can it be of less consequence that the meaning of  
A constitution should be fixed and known, than that  
the meaning of a law should he so? Can indeed a  
law be fixed in its meaning and operation, unless the  
constitution be so? On the contrary, if a particular  
legislature, differing in the construction of the con­  
stitution, from a series of preceding constructions,  
proceed to act on that difference, they not only in­  
troduce uncertainty and instability in the constitution,  
but in the laws themselves: inasmuch as all laws  
preceding the new construction and inconsistent  
with it, are not only annulled for the future but vir­  
tually pronounced nullities from the beginning.  
It is said that the legislator having sworn to sup­  
port the Constitution, must support it in his own con­  
struction of it, however different from that put on it  
by his predecessors, or whatever be the consequence  
ofthe construction. And is not the Judge under the  
same oath to support the law ? yet has it ever been  
supposed that he was required or at liberty to disre­  
gard all precedfents, however solemnly repeated and  
regularly observed ; and by giving effect to his o\n  
abstract and individual opinions, to disturb the es­  
tablished course of practice in the business of the  
community ? Has the wisest and most conscientious  
Judge ever scrupled to acquiesce in decisions in  
which lie has been overruled by the matured opin­  
ions of the majority of his colleagues; and subse­  
quently to conform himself thereto as to authorita­  
tive expositions ofthe law ? And is it not reasonable to  
suppose that the same view oftheofficial oath should  
be taken by a legislator, acting under tho Consti­  
tution. which is hi6 guide, os is taken by a Judge act­  
ing under the law which is his *  
There is in fact and in common understanding, a I  
necessity of regarding a course of practice, as above  
characterized, in the light of legal rule of interpret­  
ing a law: and there is a like necessity of consider­  
ing it a constitutional rule of interpreting a constitu­  
tion.  
  
That ibere may he extraordinary and peculiar cir­  
cumstances controlling the rule in both cases, may  
be admitted: but with such exceptions the rule will  
force itself on the practical judgement of the most ar­  
dent theorist. lie will find it impossible to adhere  
to, and act officially upon, his solitary opinions as to  
the meaning of the law or constitution, in opposi­  
tion to a construction reduced to practice, during a  
reasonable period of time; more especially where  
no prospect existed of a change of construction by  
the public or ite agents. And if a reasonable period  
of time, marked with the usual sanctions, would not  
bar the individual prerogative, there could he no  
limitation to its exercise, although the danger of er­  
, ror must increase with the increasing oblivion of ex­  
planatory circumstance*, and with the continual  
changes in the import of words and phrase*.  
Let it then be left to the decision of every intelli­  
gent and eandid Judge, which, on the whole, is most  
  
to be relied on for the true and safe construction of a  
constitution, that which has the uniform sanction of  
successive legislative bodies through a period of  
years, and under the varied ascendancy of parties;  
or that which depends upon the opinions of every  
new legislature, heated as it may be by the spirit ol  
party, eager in the pursuit of Some favorite object,  
or led astray by the eloquence and nddress of popu­  
lar statesmen, themselves, perhaps under the influ­  
ence of the same misleading causes.  
It was in conformity with the view here taken  
of the respect due to deliberate and reiterated  
precedents, that the Bank of the United States,  
though on the original question held to be unconsti­  
tutional, received the Executive signature in the year  
1817. The act originally establishing a Bank had  
undergone ample discussions in its passage through  
the several branches of the government. It had been  
carried into execution throughout a period of twenty  
years with annual legislative recognitions ; in one in­  
stance indeed with a positive ramification of it into a  
new State; and with the entire acquiescence of all  
the local authorities, a9 well as of theknation at large;  
to all of which may be added a decreasing prospect  
of any change in the public opinion adverse to the  
constitutionality of such an institution. A veto from  
the Executive under these circumstances, with nn  
admission of the expediency and almost necessity of  
the measure, would have been a defiance of ull the  
obligations derived from a course of precedents  
amounting to the requisite evidence of the national  
judgement and intention.  
It has been contended that the authority of prece­  
dents was in that case invalidated by the considera­  
tion, that they proved only n respect for tlia stipula­  
ted duration of the Bank, with a toleration of it un­  
til the law should expire, and by the casting vote  
given in the Senate by the Vice-President in the  
year 1811, against a bill for establishing a National  
Bank, the vote being expressly given on the ground  
of unconstitutionality. But if the law itself was  
unconstitutional, the stipulation was void, and could  
not bo constitutionally fulfilled or tolerated.&#x27; And as  
to the negative of the Senate by the casting vote of  
the presiding officer, it is a fact well understood at  
that time,that it resulted noi from an equality of opin­  
ions in that assembly on the power of Congress to  
establish a Bank, but from a junction of those who  
admitted the power, but disapproved the plan, with  
those who denied the power. On a simple questionof  
constitutionality, there was a decided majority in fa­  
vor of it.  
Mrs Madison joins me in hoping that you will not  
fail to make the intended^ visit to Virginia, which  
promises us the pleasure of welcoming you to our  
domicil, and in a sincere return of all the good wishes  
you express for us  
JAMES MADISON

tire casting vote given in the Senate by the Vice  
President in the year 1811, against a bill for es­  
tablishing a National Hank, the vote being ex­  
pressly given on the ground of unconstitutional­  
ly. B it if thel.iw itself was uucnnsti&#x27;utional  
. the stipulation was void, and could not be con­  
stitutionally fulfilled or tolerated. And as to the  
negative of the Senate by the casting vote of the  
i presiding officer, it is a fact well understood at  
the time, that it resulted not from an equality of  
| opinions in that assembly on the power of Con•  
gress to establish a Bank, but from a junction of  
1 those who admitted the power, but disapproved  
i the plan, with those who denied the power. On

a decided majority in favor of it.

&quot;The case in question has its true analogy in  
the obligation arising from judicial expositions  
  
of the U w on -ucceedme judges; the consiiiuuon  
beinsi a law to tho legislator, as the law is a rule  
  
of decision to the judge.  
And why are judicial precedents, when  
formed on due discussion and consideration, and  
  
deliberately sanctioned bv reviews and repeti  
tions, regnrded as ol funding imfluence, or ra  
ther of authoritative force, in settling the mean  
iiw of a taw! 1 1 must he answered, 1st, be  
  
cause it is a reasonriblo and established axiom,  
tint the good of aocieiy requires that tho rules  
  
of conduct of its membprs should be certain nna  
Itmiwn which would hot be the case if any judge,  
  
disregarding the decisi n of his predecessors,  
  
should vary the rule of law according to nis in-  
dividual interpretation of It. Misera esr servi-  
  
ttis ubi ius est nut vagum aut incognitum.  
  
(Wretched is the slavery-wtiere tne law is eimer  
  
uncertain or unknown.) 2n, because an ex­  
position of the law publicly make and repeatedly  
confirmed bv the consiituted authority, carries  
  
wiih it. bv fur inference, the sanction of those  
  
who, having made the law through the legislative  
organ, appeur under such circumstances, to have  
determined its meaning through their judiciary  
  
organ.  
&quot; Cm it be of less ronsequonce that the moan  
  
ing of the Constitution should bo fixed and  
known, than that the meaning of a law should  
  
be so? Can indeed a law be fixed in its mean  
  
ing Hnd its operation, ugless the Constitution be  
  
so? On the contrary, if a particular legisi­  
surc, diff-iing in the construdion of the Con­  
tention, from a aeries of preceding construc­  
tions, proceed to act on that difference, they not  
only introduce uncertainty and instability in  
the Constitution-, but in the laws themselves ;  
inasmuch as all laws, preceding the new ron-  
  
li&#x27;itrlinn un rl inconsistent with it. are not an  
  
nulled for ihe fuune, but virtually pronounced  
  
nullities from ihe beginning.  
&quot; But it is said that the legislator having  
sworn tit support the constitution, must support  
his own construction of it, however different from  
that put on it by his predecessors, or whatever  
be the consequence of the construction. And is  
no the judge under ih sime oaih to support  
the law? yet has it ever been supposed that he  
was required, or at libeity to disregard all pre­  
cedents, however solemnly repented and .egulnr­  
lv observed ; and by giving effect to his own  
abstract and individual opinions, to disiurb the  
est Wished business of tho community? lias  
the wisest and most conscientious judge ever  
scrupled to acquiesce in decisions in which he has  
been overruled by the matured opinions of the  
majority of his colleagues; and subsequently  
to conform himself thereto, as to authoritative  
expositions of the law? And is it not reasona­  
ble that the same view of the offiri.il oath should  
be taken by a legislator, acting under the consti­  
tuiion, which is his guide, as is taken by a judge,  
acting under the law, which is his?  
&quot; There is in tact and in common understand­  
ing, a necessity of regarding a course of practice,  
as above characterized, in the light of a leg il  
ruli of interpreting a law ; and there is a like  
ne &quot;ossify of considering it a constitutional rule  
of interpreting u constitution.  
That there may bi extraordinary and peculiar  
  
circumstances controlling the rule in botli cases,  
may be admitted ; hut with such exceptions, the  
  
rule will force itself upon the practical judgment  
of the most ardent theoiist. He will find it im­  
possible to adhere to, and act officially upon,  
  
his solitary opinions as to the meaning of the  
  
law or constitution, in opposition to a construe  
  
tioo, reduced to practice, during a reasonable  
  
pri d of time ; more especially .where no pros  
  
pert existed of a change of constitution by the  
  
public or its agents. And if a reasonable pe  
  
rio l of time, marked with the usual sanctions,  
  
would not bar the individual prerogative, the e  
could be no limitation to its exerrise, although  
  
the danger ol error must increase with the in  
  
creasing oblivion of explanatory circumstances,  
  
and with the continual changes in the import of  
  
words and phrases.  
&quot; Let it then be left to the decision of every  
intelligent and candid judge, &#x27;which, on the  
whole, is most to be relied on for the true and  
safe construction of a constitution, that which  
has the uniform sanction of successive legislative  
bodies through a period of yars, and under the  
varied ascendancy of parties; or that whi-h de­  
pends upon the opinions Of every new legisla  
  
ture, heated as it may be by the spirit of party,  
  
eager in the pursuit of some favorite object, or  
  
led astray by tho eloquence and address Ot po  
  
pul ir statesmen, themselves, perhips, under the  
  
in fl lence of :he ime misleading causes.  
&quot; It was in conformity with the view here ta  
ten of the respect dut to deliberate and rei&#x27;era-  
  
ted precedents, that the Bank of the United  
  
ifates, though on the original queshon held to be  
unconstitutional, received the Eztcutivt signa­  
ture in the year 1817. Toe act of originally  
establishing a B ink, had undergone ample dis­  
cussions in is p-issigo through the sevenl  
brunches of the government. It had been car­  
ried into execution throughout a period of 20

of the nation at large; to all of which may be  
added, a decreasing prospect of any change in  
  
he public opinion adverse to the constitutionality  
  
of such an institution. A veto from the Execu­  
tive under thete circumstances, with an admis­  
sia fihe eipediency and almost &#x27;necessity&quot; of  
  
the measure, Mould have been a dejiance oj au  
the obligations derioid from a course of prece­

national iudement and tztention.  
  
&#x27;It has been contended that the authority of

exercise, although the danger of error must increase with the  
increasing oblivion of explanatory circumstances, and with the  
continual changes in the import of words and phrases.  
  
“Let it then be left to the decision of every intelligent anq  
candid judge, which, on the whole, is most to be relied on for  
the true and safe construction of a constitution, that which has  
the uniform sanction of successive legislative bodies through a  
period of years, and under the varied ascendancy of parties; or  
that which depends upon the opinions of every new legislature  
heated as it may be by the spirit of party, eager in the pursuit of  
some favorite object, or led astray by the eloquence and address  
of popular statesmen, themselves, perhaps, under the influence  
of the same misleading causes.  
  
‘It was in conformity with the view here taken on the respect  
due to deliberate and reiterated precedents, that the bank of the  
  
United States, though on the original question held to be uncon-  
stitutrional, received the executive signature in the year 1817. The  
act of originally establishing a bank, had undergone ample dis-  
cussions in its passage through the several branches of the go-  
vernment. It had been carried into execution throughout a period  
of twenty years with annual legislative recognitions; in one in-  
stance, indeed, with a positive ramification o f it into a new state,  
and with the entire acquiescence of all the local authorities as well  
as of the nation at large; to all of which may be added, a de-  
creasing prospect of any change in the public opinion adverse to  
the constitutionality of such an institution. 4 veto from the  
executive under these circumstances, with an admission of the ex-  
pediency and almost necessity of the measure, would have been  
a defiance of all the obligations derived from a course of prece-  
dents amounting to the requisite evidence of the natsonal judgment  
and intention.  
  
“It has been contended that the authority of precedents was  
in that case invalidated by the consideration that they proved  
only a respect for the stipulated duration of the bank, witha  
toleration of it until the law should expire, and by the casting  
vote given in the senate by the vice president in the year 1811,  
against a bill for establishing a national bank, the vote being ex-  
pressly given on the ground of unconstitutionality. But if the  
law itself was unconstitutional, the stipulation was void, and  
could not be constitutionally fulfilled or tolerated. And as to  
the negative of the senate by the casting vote of the presiding offi-  
cer, it is a fact well understood at the lime, that it resulted not from  
an equality of opinions in that assembly on the power of congress  
to establish a bank, but from a junction of those who admitted  
the power, but disapproved the plan, with those who denied the  
  
  
  
power. On a simple question of constitutionality, there was a de-  
cided majorily in favor of it. JAMES MADISON.”

&quot; Montpelier, June 25, 1331.  
Dear Sir : I have received your friendly letter of the  
18th instant. The few lines which answered your tor­  
mer one of the 21st January last, were written in haste  
and in hml health ; but thev expressed, though  
without  
the Attention in some reenects due to the occasion,  
dissent from the views of the President as to a Bank of  
the United States, and a substitute for it ; to which 1  
cannot but adhere. The objections to the latter have  
anneared to me to preDonderate greatly over the ad  
vantages expected from it ; and the constitutionality of  
the former 1 still regard as susiaineo oy me conniueru.­  
tions to which I yielded in giving my assent to the ex­  
isting Bank.  
&quot;The charce ol inconsistency between my objection  
to the constitutionality of such a Bank in 1791, and my  
assent in 1817, turns on the question how far legislative  
precedents, expounding the constitution, ought to guide  
succeeding Legislatures ana to overrule lnaiviuum opi  
nions.  
&quot;Some obscurity has been thrown over the question,  
bv confounding it with the respect due from one Legis  
lature to laws passed by preceding Legislatures, put  
the two cases are essentially ditlerent. A constitution,  
beins derived from a superior authority, is to be ex  
pounded and obeyed, not controlled or varied by the  
subordinate authoritv&#x27;of a legislature. A law. on the  
other hand, resting on no higher authority than that  
Dosaeased be avery auccesmve Legislature, its expe  
diency, as well as its meaning, is within the acope of  
the latter.  
&quot;The case in question has its true analogy in the  
obligation arising from judicial expositions of the law  
or succeeding judges, the constitution being a law to  
the legislator, as the law is a rule of decision to the  
judges.  
&quot;And why are judicial precedents, wnen lormea on  
due discussion and consideration, and deliberately sanc­  
tioned by reviews and repetitions, regarded as of binding  
influence, or rather of authoritative force, in settling the  
meaning of a law ? It must be answered, first because  
it is a reasonable and established axiom, that the good  
of society requires that the rules of conduct of its mem­  
bers should be certain and known, which would not be  
the case if any judge, disregarding the decisions of his  
predecessorsshould vary the rule of law according to  
his individual interpretation of it. Misera est servilus  
ubijus est out vagum aut incegnitum. Second, because  
an exposition publickly made, and repeatedly confirmed  
by the constituted authority, carries with it, by fair in­  
ference, the sanction of those who, having made the  
law through their legislative organ, appear under such  
circumstances to have determined its meaning through  
their judiciary organ.  
&quot;Can it be of less consequence that the meaning of  
a constitution should be fixed and known than the  
meaning of a law should be so ? Can, indeed, a law  
be fixed in its meaning and operation, unless the con­  
stitution be so ? On the contrary, if a particular Legis­  
lature, differing in the construction of the constitution  
from a series of preceding constructions, proceed to  
act on that difference, they not only introduce uncer­  
tainty and instability in the constitution, but in the  
laws themselves, inasmuch as all laws preceding the  
new construction, and inconsistent with it, are not  
only annulled for the future, but virtually pronounced  
nullities from the beginning.  
&quot;But it is said that the legislator, having sworn to  
support the constitution, must support it in his own  
construction of it however different from that put on it  
by his predecessors, or whatever be the consequences  
of the construction. And is not the judge under the  
same oath to support the law ? Yet has it ever been  
supposed that he was required or at liberty to disregard  
all precedents, however solemnly repeated and regu  
larly observed, and by giving effect to his own abstract  
and individual opinions, to disturb the established  
course of practice in tho business of the community?  
Has the wisest and most consciencious judge ever  
scrupled to acquiesce in decisions, in which he has  
been overruled by the matured opinions of the majority  
of his colleagues, and subsequently to conform him­  
self thereto, as to authoritative expositions ol the law?  
And is it not reasonable that the same view ot the orh  
cialoath should be taken by the legislator, acting under  
the constitution, which is his guide, as is taken by  
judge acting under the law ; which is his ?  
&quot; 1 here is, in fact, and in common understanding, a  
necessity of regarding a course of practice, as above  
characterized, in the light of a legal rule of interpret  
ing a law ; and there is a like necessity of considering  
it a constitutional rule ot interpreting a constitution,  
&#x27; That there may be extraordinary and peculiar cir  
cumstances controlling the rule in both cases, may bo  
admitted ; but with such exceptions, the rule will force  
itself on the practical judgment of the most ardent tlieo  
rist. He will find it impossible to adhere to, and to  
act officially on his solitary opinions, as to the  
meaning of the law or constitution, in opposition to a  
construction reduced to practice during a reasonable  
period of time; more especially where no prospect ex­  
isted of a change of construction by the publick or its  
agents. And if a reasonable period of time, marked  
with the usual sanctions, would not bar the individual  
prerogative, there could be no limitation to its exercise,  
although the danger of error must increase with the in­  
creasing oblivion of explanatory circumstances, and  
with the continual changes in the import of words and  
phrases.  
&quot; Let it then be left to the decision of every intelli­  
gent and candid judge, which on the whole, is most to  
be relied on for the true and safe construction of the  
constitution, that which has the uniform sanction of  
successive legislative bodies, through a period of years,  
and under the varied ascendency of paries, or that  
which depends upon the opinions of every new Legis­  
ture, heated as it may be by the spirit of party, eager in  
the pursuit of some favoured object, or led astray by  
the eloquence and address of popular tatesmen, them­  
selves, perhaps, under the influence of the same mis  
leading causes.  
&quot;It was in conformity with the view here taken of  
the respect due to deliberate and reiterated precedents,  
that the Bank of the United States, though on the ori­  
ginal questions held to be unconstitutional, received the  
oxocutive signature in the year 1817. The act origi­  
nally establishing a bank, had undergone ample discus­  
sion in its passage through the several branches of tho  
Government. It had been carried into execution  
throughout a period of twenty years, with annual legis­  
lative recognitions; in one instance, indeed, with a  
positive ramification of it into a new State; and with  
the entire acquicscense of all the local authorities, as  
  
well as of the nation at large ; to all of which may be  
nAApii rWreaaina nmsnect of anv chance in the Dub-  
  
lick opinion, adverse to the constitutionality of such an  
institution. A veto from the Executive, under these  
circumstances, with an admission of the expediency,  
and almost necessity of the measure, would have been a  
defiance of all obligations derived from a course of pre­  
cedents, amounting to the requisite evidence of the na  
tional judgment and intention.  
&quot;It has been contended that the authority of prece­  
dents was, in that case, invalidated by the considera­  
tion that they proved only a respect for the stipulated  
duration of the Bank, with a toleration of it until the  
law should expire, and by the casting vote given in the  
Senate, by the Vice President, in tne year 101 1, against  
a bill for establishing a National Bank, the vote being  
expressly given on the ground of unconstitutionality.  
But if the law itself was unconstitutional, the stipula­  
tion was void, and could not be constitutionally fulfilled  
or tolerated. As to the negative of the Senate, by the  
casting vote of the &quot;presiding officer, it is a fact, well  
understood at the time, that it resulted not irom an  
equality of opinions in that assembly on the power of  
Congress to establish a bank, but from a junction of  
those who admitted the power, disagproved tne pian,  
with those who admitted the power. On a simple  
questionof constitutionality their was a decided majority  
in favour of it.&quot;  
&quot;JAMES MADISON.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
&quot; Montpelier, June 25, 1831.  
&quot; Dear Sir : I have received your friend­  
ly letter of the 18th inst. Ttiej few nea  
which answered your former one of the 21st  
of January fast,, were written- in j haste and  
in bad health ; but they expressed, though  
without attention in some respects due to  
the occasion, a dissent from the views of the  
President as to a Bank of the United States,  
and a substitute for it; to which SI cannot  
but adhere. (Mr. Madison herr alludes to  
Gen. Jackson s Government Bank.) The  
: objections to the latter have appeared to me  
to preponderate greatly pver the advantages  
expected from it, and the constitutionality  
of the former I still regard as sustained by  
the considerations to which I yielded, in  
giving my assent to the existing Bank.  
i Tlfe charge of inconsistency between  
my .objection to the constitutionality of such  
a bank in 1791, and my assent irrl817, turns  
on the question, how far legislative prece­  
dents, expounding the&quot; constitution, ought to  
guide succeeding -legislatures, and to over­  
rule individual opinions. J  
&quot;Some obscurity has been thrown over  
the question, by confounding it with the re­  
spect&#x27;due from one legislature to laws passed  
by preceding legislatures. But the two ca­  
ses are essentially different. A constitution  
being derived from a superior authority, is  
to be expounded and obeyed, not controlled  
or varied by the subordinate authority of a  
legislature. A law, on the other hand, rest­  
ing on no higher authority than that pos­  
sessed by every successive legislature, its  
expediency as well as its meaning is within  
the scope of the latter. . .  
&quot; The case in question has its true analo­  
gy in the obligation arising from judicial ex­  
positions, of the law on succeeding Judges ;  
the constitution, being a law to the legisla­  
tor, as the law is a rule of decision to the  
Judge.  
And why are judicial precedents, when  
formed on due discussion and consideration,  
and deliberately sanctioned by reviews and  
repetitions, regarded as of binding influence,  
or rather of authoritative force, in settling  
the meaning of the 7 law ? It must be an­  
swered, 1st, because it is a reasonable and  
established axiom, that the good of society  
requires that the rules of conduct of its mem­  
bers should be certain and known, which  
would not be the case if any Judge, disre­  
garding the decisions,&#x27; of his predecessors,  
should vary the rule of law according to his  
individual interpretation of it. Misery est  
servitus ubijtis est aut&#x27;vagum out incog&#x27;  
nitum. 2d, because an exposition of the  
law publicly made, and repeatedly confirm­  
ed By the constituted authority, carries with  
it, by fair inference, the sanction of those&#x27;  
who, having made the law through their le­  
gislative organ, appear under such circum­  
stances to have determined its meaning  
through their judiciary organ. . 1  
&quot; Can it be of less consequence that the!  
meaning of a constitution should be fixed  
and known, than that the meaning of a law  
should be so? Can indeed a law be fixed  
in its meaning and operation, unless the  
constitution be sot On the contrary, if a  
particular legislature, differing in the con­  
struction of the constitution, from a series  
of preceding constructions, proceed to act  
on that difference, they not only introduce  
uncertainty and instability in the constitu­  
tion, but in the laws themselves; inasmuch  
as all laws preceding the new construction  
are inconsistent with it, are not only annull­  
ed for the future, but virtually pronounced  
nullities from the beginning.  
I Bat it is said that the legislator havinsr  
sworn to support the constitution, must sup­  
port it in his own construction of it, how­  
ever different from that put on it by his pre­  
decessors, or whatever be the consequences  
of the construction. And&quot; is not the Judge  
under the &quot;same oath to support the law ?  
jYet has it ever been supposed that he was  
required, or at liberty to disregard all pre­  
cedents, however solemnly repeated and  
regularly; observed; and by giving effect to  
his own abstract and individual opinions, to  
disturb the established course of practice in  
the business of the community ? Has the  
wisest and most conscientious Judge ever  
scrupled to acquiesce in decisions in which  
he has been overruled by the matured oDin-  
ions of the majority of his colleagues ; and  
subsequently to conform himself thereto, as  
to authoritative expositions of the law?-r-And  
is it not reasonable that the same view  
of the official oath should be taken by a le­  
gislator, acting underthe constituiion. which  
is his guide, as is taken by a Judge; acting  
uiiuer uw law, wnicn is nis I  
There is, in fact, and : in .nmmVn  
derstanding, a necessity of regarding a course  
of practice, as above characterised. , in the  
light Of a leffal rule of intfirnretino lo .  
and there is a like necessity of considering  
it a constitutional rule of interpreting a con  
stitution . i  
I &quot; Thai there may be .extraordinary and  
peculiar circumstances controlling the rule  
  
in both cases, may be admitted : but with j  
such exceptions, the rule will force itself  
on the practical judgment of the most ardent  
theorist. He will find it impossible to ad­  
here to, and act oflicially upon, his solitary  
opinions as to the meaning of the law or con­  
stitution, in opposition to a construction re­  
duced to practice, during a reasonable peri­  
od of time ; more especially where no pros­  
pect existed of a change, of construction by  
the public or its agents. And if a reasona­  
ble period of time, marked with the usual  
sanctions, would not bar the individual pre­  
rogative, there could be no limitation to its  
exercise, although the danger of error must  
increase with the increasing oblivion of ex­  
planatory circumstances, and with ihe con­  
tinued changes . in the import of words and  
phrases.  
&quot; Let it then be left to the decision of  
every intelligent and candid Judge, which,  
on the whole, is most to be relied on for the  
true and safe construction of the constitution,  
that which has the uniform sanction of suc­  
cessive legislative bodies through -n period  
of years, and under the varied ascendancy  
of parties ; or that on which depends the  
opinions of every new legislature, heated as  
it may be by the spirit of party, eager in  
-the pursuit of some favorite object, or led  
away by the eloquence and address of pop­  
ular statesmen, themselves, perhaps, under  
the influence of the same misleading causes.  
&quot;It was in conformity to the. view here  
taken, of the respect due to&quot; deliberate and  
reiterated precedents, that the Bank of the  
United States, though on the original ques­  
tion held to be unconstitutional, received  
the Executive signature in the year 1817.  
The act originally establishing a Bank had  
undergone ample discussions in its passage  
through the several branches of the govern­  
ment. I had been carried into execution  
throughjt period of twenty years with the  
annual legislative recognition ; in one in­  
stance, indeed, with a positive ramification  
of it into ajiew State ; and with the entire  
acquiescence of all the local authorities, as  
well as of the nation at large ; to all which  
  
may be added, a decreasing prospect of any  
change in the public opinion adverse to the  
constitutionality of such an institution. A  
veto from the Executive under these circum­  
stances, with an admission of the expedien­  
cy and almost necessity of the measure,  
would have been a defiance of all the obli­  
gations derived from a course of precedents  
amounting to the requisite evidence of the  
national judgment and intentions.  
&quot; It has been contended that the authori­  
ty of precedents was, in that case, invalida­  
ted by the consideration, that they proved  
only a respect for the stipulated duration of  
the Bank, with a toleration ot it nntil the  
law should expire, and by the Vice Presi­  
dent in 1811, against a bill for establishing  
a National Bank, the vote being expressly  
given on the ground of unconstitutionality.  
But if the law itself was unconstitutional,  
the stipulation was void, and could not be  
constitutionally fulfilled or tolerated. And  
as to the negative of the Senate by the cast­  
ing vote of the presiding officer, it is a fact,  
well understood at the time, that it result  
ed, not from an equality of opinions in that  
assembly on the power of. Congress to es­  
tablish a Bank, but from a junction of those  
who admitted the power, but disapproved  
the plan, with those who denied the power.  
On a simple question of constitutionality  
there was a decided majority in favor of it.

of about the same date, Mr. Madison says

the cnnsiittiilntlt from a series of preceding con­  
structions. proceed to act on that difference, they  
! not only introduce uncertainty and instability in the  
I constitution, but in the laws themselves ; inasmuch  
as all laws preceding tiro new construction are in­  
consistent with it, are not only annulled fur the fu­  
1 tore, but virtually pronounced nullities from thebe­  
gii nmg.  
*• Hut ii is saiil that the legislator having sworn to  
support the constitution, must snppmf it in Ilia own  
construction of it, however different from that put on  
I it by his predecessors, or whatever be the onnse  
qtience* of the construction. And isnotlhe Judge  
under the same oath lo support the law ? Vet has it  
ever been supposed that lie was required, or at liber­  
ty to disregard all precedents, however solemnly re­  
peated and regulaily observed ; and by giving eff. it  
tolns own abstract and individual opinions, fn dis­  
turb the established course of practice in the husi

conscientious .1 udge ever scrupled to acquiesce in de­  
cision* in which lie has been overruled by the ma­  
tured opinion* of ilie majority *»f his colleagues ; and  
subsequently to conform himself thereto, as to an

reasonable that the same view of Hie official oath

! stitution, wfieb is Ills guide, as is taken by .a Judge,  
I acting under the la w, which is his?  
&quot;There is. in fact, and in common understand­  
ing, a necessity of regarding a course of practice, as  
above characterized, in the light of a legal rule of  
I interpreting a law : and there is a like necessity of  
considering il n constitutional rule of interpreting a  
constitution.  
  
“ That there may l»e extraordinary and peculiar  
circumstances controlling the rule in both cases,  
inav In* admitted : hut »\ith such exceptions, the Mile  
will fone itself on ?!;. practical judgment of t lie most  
ardent theoiist. lie will find it impossible to adhere  
to, and act ofiieially upon his solitary opinions as to  
the moaning of the law &lt; r constitution, in opposition  
to a construction reduced to practice, during a rea­  
sonable pei iod of time ; mo»e especially where no  
prospect existed ol a change of construction bv the  
public or its agents. And ifa reasonable period of  
lime, marked with the usual sanctions, would no*  
; bar the individual prerogative, there could he uo limi­  
tation to its exercise, although the danger of error  
| must increase with the increasing oblivion ul  
explanatory ciie’uinstances, and wrh the con­  
(i tied changes in the import of words and phrases.  
** Let ii then be left to the decision of every intel­  
ligent end candid Judge, which, on the whole, is  
&#x27; most to he relied on for the true and sale coristruc­  
&#x27; tion o* the cnns’itof ion, that which has the uniform  
I sanction of successive legislative bodies thiough a  
j period of years, and under the varied ascendancy of  
■ parties; or that on which depends the opinions of  
I every new legislature, heated ns it may be by the  
spint of party* eager in the porsuir ol some favorite  
object, or led away by tin* eloquence and address ol  
popular statesmen, themselves, perhaps, under the  
j influence of the same misleading causes.  
I “It was in conformity to the view here taken, of  
the respect due to deliberate and reiterated prece­  
dents, that the Bunk of the United Slates, though  
on the original question held to lie unconstitutional,  
received the Kxecutive signature in the year IHlfi.  
The act originally establishing a Bank had under­  
gone ample discussions in its passage thiough the  
several branches of (lie government. It had b« cn  
carried into execution through a period of twenty  
years with the annual legislative recognition; in  
one instance, indeed, with a positive ramification ol  
it into a new State; and with the entire aequies-J  
cerjee of all the local authorities, as well S3 of the  
  
^ nation at large; fo all winch may he added, a dr  
! creasing prospect of any change in (lie public opm  
ion adverse to the constitutionality of suc h an insti­  
tution. A veto horn the Executive under thcsr  
ciirtitiistiiucAs, with an admission ol the expedien­  
cy and almost necessity of the measure, would have  
bern j defiance of .ill the obligations derived from  
a course of precedents amounting to the requisite  
evidenc e of the national judgment and intrntinns.  
•• It has been contended that the authority of pre  
cedents was, in that case, invalidated by the consider  
ation, that they proved only a respect fo» the stipu  
latrd duration of the Hank, with a toleration of it  
until (Ik* law should expire, and that it was  
disregarded by the vote of the. Vico President  
hi |N||, against a bill for establishing a Nation­  
al Hank, the vote being expiesslv given on the  
ground ol him ousiiliitioii.ility. Hut if the law itself  
was uiK&#x27;onsiitlitmiial, the Mipul iiimi was void, and  
could not be constitutionally fullllled m tolerated.  
And as to tin* negative of tin* Senate by the catting

&quot; My last letter expressed, though without  
the attention in some respects due to the occa­  
sion, a dissent from the vicibs of the President, as  
to a Bank of the United Slates, and a substitute  
for it, to which I cannot but adhere. The ob­  
jections to the latter [substitute] have appe  
to me to preponderate greatly over the advanta­  
ges expected from it, and the constitutionality  
of the former I still regard as sustained by the  
considerations to which / yielded in giving my  
assent to the existing Bank. And as to the neg­  
ative of the Senate, by fhe casting vote of the  
presiding officer, in 1811, it is a fact Well under­  
stood at the time, that it resulted not from an  
equality of opinions in that assembly, on the  
power of Congress to establish a Bank, but from  
a junction of those who admitted the power but  
disapproved the plan, with those who denied  
the power. On a simple question of constitu­  
tionality, there was a decided majority in favor  
of it.

views and repetitions, regarded a- of  
binding influence, or rather of a-r.&#x27;a ra-  
  
tive force, in settling the meaninir of th-  
  
law? It must be answered. 1 -si. because  
  
it is a reasonable and established axiom.  
  
that the good of society requires that  
  
he rules of conduct of its membor  
  
should be certain and known, which  
  
would not be the case if anv Jud. dis

sor, should vary the rule of law accordi  
  
ng to his individual interpretation of it.  
  
Misera est servitus ubi jus est aut rait.rt  
  
2d, because an e.XjOKi-  
  
tion of the law publicly made, and re­  
peatedly confirmed by the constituted  
  
authority, carries with it, by Ia:r inier­  
ence, the sanction of those who. having  
  
made the law through their legislative  
  
organ, appear under such circumstances  
to have determined its meaning through  
  
their judiciary organ.  
Can it be of less consequenee that the  
meaningof a constitution should be fixed  
and known, than that the meaning of a  
law should be so? Can, indeed, a law be  
fixed in its meaning and operation, un­  
less the constitution be so? Oa the con­  
trary, if a particular legislature, differ­  
ing in the construction of the constitu­  
tion, from a series of preceding construc­  
tions, proceed to act on that difference,  
they not only introduce uncertainty and  
instability in the constitution, but in the  
laws themselves; inasmuch as all laws  
preceding the new construction are in­  
consistent with it, are not only annulled  
for the future, but virtually pronounced  
nullities from the beginning.  
But it is said that the legislator having  
sworn to support the constitution, must  
support it in his own construction of it,  
however different from that put on it bv  
his predecessors, or whatever be the  
consequences of the coastruction. And  
is not the Judge under the same oath to  
support the law? Yet has it ever been  
supposed that he was required, or at  
liberty to disregard alt precedents how­  
ever solemnly repeated and regularly  
observed; and by giving etfect to his  
own abstract and individual opinions, to  
disturb the established course of prac­  
tice in the business of the community?  
Has the wisest and most conscientious  
Judge ever scrupled to acquiesce in &quot;tie&#x27;  
  
cisions m which he has been overruled  
by the matured opinions ol the majority  
  
of his colleagues; and subsequently to  
  
coniorm himeit thereto, as to authori­  
tative expositions of the law? And is  
  
jt not reasonable that the same view of  
the official oath should be taken bv a  
  
legislator, acting under the constitution.  
  
wnicn is his guide, as is taken by a  
Judge, actinir under tho law, which is  
his?

eat from the views of the President as to  
  
a Bank of the United States and a subsni  
tute for it, to which I cannot but sdhere.  
The cbjections to the latter have appeared  
to me to preponderate greatly over the ad  
vantages expected from ahacd the const  
of the former I still regard  
sstzined by the considerstions to which  
I yielded, in giving my assent to the ex  
isting Bank.  
The charge of inconsistency between  
my objection to the Constitutionaluy  
such a Bank in 1791, and in 4817, turns  
on the question, how far legislative pre  
dedents, expounded in the Constitution,  
ought to guide succseding Legislatures,  
and to overrule individual opinions.  
  
Some obscurity has been thrown over  
  
the question, by confounding it with the  
respect due from one Legislature to laws  
passed by preceding Legislators. But  
the twocases are essentially different. A  
Jonstitution being derived from a supe  
rior authority, is to be expounded and o  
  
beyed, not controlled or saried by the sub  
  
ordinate suthority of the Legislature.  
  
A

It was in conformity with the view  
  
here taken of the respect due to del-berate  
  
and reiterated precedents that the Bank of  
  
the United States, theugh on the original  
question held to be unconstitutional, re  
ceived the Executive signature in the year  
1817. The Act originally establishing a  
Bank had undergone ample discussions in  
its passage through the several branches  
  
of the Guvernment. It had been carried  
into execution throughout a period of  
  
twenty years, with annual legislative re­  
cognitions; in one instance, indeed, with  
a positive ramification of it into a new  
  
State; and with the entire acquiescence of  
  
all the local suthorites, as well as of the  
nation at large; to all of which may be  
dded, a decreasing prospect of any change  
in the publte opinion adverse to the con  
itutionahty of such an institution. A veto  
from the Executive under these circum

well se its meaning, is within the senne? all tha etdisada dasiead feam a eusa  
  
of the latter.  
  
The case in question has its true ans  
lory in the obligation arising from judi­  
expositions of the law, on sueceed­  
ing Judges; the Constitution being a law  
the Legislator, as the law is a rule of  
decision to the Judge.  
And why are judicial precedente, when  
formed on due discussion and considers  
tion, deliberately sanctioned by reviews  
and repetitions, regarded as of binding  
influence, or rather of authoritative force,  
th setling the meaning of a law? It  
must be answered, 1st, because it is s  
geasonable and estsblished axiom, that the  
good of society requires that the rules of  
conduct of its members should be certain  
and known, which would not be the case  
fany Judge, disregarding the decisions  
of his predecestors, should vary the rule  
of law, according to his individual inter  
pretation of it. Misera est servitws ubl  
jus est gut wagum aut incognitum. 2d,  
because an exposition of the law publicly  
made, and repeatedly confirmed by the  
constituted authority, carries with it, by  
feir inference, the senction of those, who  
having made the law through their legis­  
Jative organ, appear under such circum  
tanres to have determined its meaning  
through their Judiciary organ.

of precedents amounting to the requisite  
  
evidence of the national judgment and  
intention.  
It has been contended that the suthori­  
ty of precedents wes in that case invalidat  
  
ed by the considerstion, that they proved  
only a respect for the stipulated durstion  
of the Bank with a toleration of it until  
  
the law should expite, and by the casting  
vote given in the Senate by the Vice  
President in the year 1811, sgainst a bill  
for establishing a National Bank, the vote  
being expressly given on the ground of  
unconstitutionality. But if the law of  
itself was unconstitutional, the stipulation  
was void, and could not be constitutional­  
ly fulfilled or tolerated. And as to the  
negative of the Senate, by the casting vote  
of the presiding officer, it is a faet well  
understood at the time, that it resulted  
not from an equality of opinions in that  
assembly on the power of Congress to  
establish a Bank, but from a junction of  
those who admitied the power, but dis  
approved the plan, with those who denied  
the power. On a simple question of con  
stitutionality, there was a decided majority  
in favor of it.  
JAMES MADISON.

rated precedents that the Bank of the United  
  
State.&quot;, though on the original question held to  
be unconstitutional, received tho Executive  
signature in the year 1617. The act original­  
ly establishing a Bank had undergone ample  
  
discussions in its passage through the several  
  
Drancnes oi the Government. It had been car  
ried into execution throughout a period of twen  
  
ty years, with annual legislative recognitions;

charge in the public opinion adverse to the  
  
constitutionality of such an institution. A Veto  
from the Executive, under these circumstan­  
ces, with an admission of the expediency and  
almost necessity of the measure, whould have  
been a defiance of all the obligations derived  
from a course of precedents amounting to the  
requisite evidence of the national judgement  
and intention.  
It has been contended that the authority of  
precedents was in that case invalidated by the  
consideration that they proved only a respect

MoNTI&#x27;Kl.lKIt, June 2.&#x27;?, IK1I .  
Dear Sik I have received your friendly letter of  
llu&#x27; iStli inst. The few linee which answered vour  
former one of tin- &#x27;J 1st of January last, were wntien  
in hasteand in bad health . but they cipwnl,(hough  
without tlx* attention in some resjs&#x27;cts due to the oc­  
casion, a dissent ftom llir \n w? of the President, as  
to n Hank of the United .States and a substitute for it  
to whirh 1 cannot hut adhere. The objection* to the  
latter have appeared to me to predominate greatly over  
the advantages ex|&gt;ectcd from it, anil the constitution­  
ality of the lormrr I null regard an sustained by the  
consideration to which I yielded in giving my assent  
to the exiMtinjr bank.  
The charge &lt;&gt;f inconsi tency between my objection  
to the constitutionality of such a bank, in l*&#x27;.M, and  
my assent in 1NI7, turns oil the question, how far le  
gislative precedents, expounding the constitution,  
ought to guide succeeding legislatures, and to overrule  
individual opinions.  
Some obscurity has been thrown over the question,  
by confounding it with the reaped due from one le^i*  
| latute to laws passed by preceding legislature*. Hut  
the twocasc* are essentially different. A constitution  
deing derived from_a superior authority, is to been  
|Niunded and obeyed, nut controlled or varied by the  
subordinate authority of a legislature. A law. on the  
other hand, resting on no higher authority than that  
i | assessed by every successive legislature, its ei^edi­  
| ency as well a.&#x27; its meaning Is within the m ope ul the  
latier.  
I The rase in question has its true analogy in the oh­  
I ligation arising from judicial exposition* of the law on  
succeeding judges; t.ie constitution being a law tothe  
legislator, as the law is a rule of decision to the judge  
And why are judicial precedents, when formed in  
ilue discussion and consideration, und deliberately  
sanctioned by reviews and reiietitions, regarded as ot  
binding influence, or rather of authoritative force, in  
settling the meaning of a l.iwl It must be answered,  
| Ut.lx-causr it is a reasonable and established axiom  
j that the good of society requires th.&#x27;.t ihcvruh-s nt con­  
| duet of its members should be certain and known,  
: which would not be t&#x27;ic case if any judge, disregard  
I ing the decisions of Ins predecessors, should vary the  
| rule of law according to his milmduil interpretation  
I ot it. Mnera r*t ferritin ubi ju- cut nut tiii-um nut  
iniofni/um. &#x27;2d. because an exposition of the law,  
|*lhhr|y made, and repeatedly confirmed by the Con­  
1 sufated authority, carries With it, by fsir inference,  
| the sanction of thoae who, having made the law through  
then legislative organ, ap|&gt;car, under such circumstan  
, res, to have determined its meaning through their ju­  
dietary organ  
  
Call it be of less con sequence* that the meaning of a  
constitution should be fixed and known, than that the  
meaning uf a law should tie so I Can, indeed, a taw  
bu fixed in it* iik-u it in i&gt; and operation, unless tbe con­  
stitution be so 1 On ibe contrary, if a particular le­  
gislature, differing in the construction of the oonstilu  
lion, forui a (eric* of preceding constructions, proceed  
to acton tbat difference, ilie/not only introduce un­  
certainty and instability iu the constitution, but in the  
law? themselves ; inasmuch as all laws preceding the  
new construction, and inconsistent with it, are not  
only annulled for the future, but virtually prouounced  
nullities from the beginning.  
Hut it is suid that llw legislator sworn to su|i|Hirt  
the constitution, mud support it in his own construc­  
tion of it, however different from that put on it by his  
piedecessuis, or whatever be the consequences of the  
construction. And is not thr judge under the sume  
oath to ?up|&gt;ort the law 7 Yet, has it ever been sup­  
posed that he was required, or at hbeity to disregard alL  
precedents, however solemnly repeuted and regularly  
observed ; and by giving effect to Ins own abstract  
anil individual opinions, to disturb the established  
course of practice in the business of the community I  
Has the wisest und most conscientious judge ever  
scrupled to acquiesce in decisions in which he has lieen  
overruled by tlie matured opinions of the majority of  
his colleagues; and subsequently to conform himself  
thereto, as to authoritative exposition of the law 1  
And is it not reasonable to suppose that the sume view  
of tlio olliciul eatli should be taken by a legislature,  
acting under the constitution, which is his guide, as  
is tukcii liy a judge, acting under the law, which is  
Ins I  
There is in fact, and in common understanding, a  
necessity of regarding a course of practice, as above  
characterized, in the light of u legal rule of interpret­  
ing law . and there is u like necessity of considering it  
a constitutional rule of interpreting a constitution.  
That there may be extraordinary mid peculiar cir­  
cumstances controlling the rule in both cases, muy tie  
admitted ; but with such exceptions, the rule will  
force itself on the pructical judgment of the most ar­  
dent theorist, lie will lind it iiiqioKsihlc to adhere to,  
und act ollicially upon, his solitary opinions as to the  
meaning of the law or constitution, in opposition to a  
construction reduccd to practice, during u reasonable  
period of time; more especially where no pros|iecl ex  
? sted of a change of construction by the public or its  
agents. And if a reasonable period of tune, marked  
with tile Usual sanctions, would not bar the individual  
prerogative, there could be no limit ation to its exercise,  
although the danger of crrot must increase with the  
increasing oblivion of explanatory circumstances, and  
witli (he continual changes in the iuqiort of words und  
phrases.  
Let it then tie left to the decision of every intelligent  
and candid judge, which, on the whole, is most to be  
relied on, for the true and safe construction of a con­  
| stitution that which has the uniform sanction of suc­  
cessive legislative bodies, through a peritsl of years,  
and under the varied ascendancy of parties ; or that  
which depends u|sin the opinions of every new legis­  
lature, I euted as it may be by the spirit of party, eager  
in the pursuit of some favorite object, or led ustruy by  
the cloquencc und address of popular statesmen, them­  
selves, perhaps, under the influence of the same mis­  
leading causes.  
It was in conformity with the view here taken of the  
respect due to deliberate and reiterated precedents,  
that the Bank of the United States, though on the  
original question held to lie unconstitutional, received  
j the Executive signature in the year 1817. The act  
originally establishing a bank had undergone ample  
discussions in its passage through the several branches  
of the Government. It had been carried into execu­  
tion, throughout a |&gt;eriod of twenty years, with annu­  
al legislative recognitions; in one instance, indeed,  
with a positive ramification of it into a new State, and  
with the entire acquiescenceol&quot;ull the local authorities,  
us well as the nation at large; to all of which may be  
added, u decreasing prosjiect of any change in the  
public opinion udver?e to the constitutionality of such  
an institution. A veto from the Executive, under  
these ciicutnslances, with an admission of the expedi­  
ency and almost necessity of the measure, would nave  
ticen a defiance of all the obligations derived from a  
course of precedents amounting to the requisite evi­  
dence of the national judgment and intention.  
It has been contehded that the authority of prece­  
dents was in that case invalidated by the consideration  
that thev proved only a respect for the stipulated du­  
ration of the bank with a toleration of it until the law  
should expire, and by the casting vote given in the Se­  
nate by the Vice President, in the year 1811, against  
a bill for establishing u national h-jnk, the vote being  
expressly given on tlie ground of unconstitutionality.  
Hut, if the law itself was unconstitutional, the stimu­  
lation was void, and could not be constitutionally ful­  
filled or tolerated. And as to the negative of the Se­  
nate. by the casting vote of the presiding officer, if is  
a fact, well understood at the time, thut it resulted not  
from an equality uf opinions in thut assembly on the  
|H)Wer of Congress to establish a bank, hut from a  
I junction of those who admitted the power, hut disup­  
i proved the plan, with those who denied the power.  
On a simple question of constitutionality, there was a  
decided majority in favor of it.

Montpeli F.rt, Juno 23ili, 1831.  
Dea Sir: I have received your friendly  
letter uf the 18th inst. The few lines which  
answered your former ono of tho 2 1st of  
January last, were written in h.isto and in bad  
health; but they expressed, tliougli without  
tho attention in same respects due to the  
iirrasinn. a dissent fioni tho view of the  
President, as to tho B.ink of tho United  
States and a substitute for it, to which I c in­  
not but adhere. The objections to the lat­  
tor have appeared to me to pieponderato  
really over tho advantago expected from it,  
and tho constitutionality of tho former, I still  
regard as sustained by the considerations to  
which I yielded in giving my assent to the  
existing Bank.  
The chargo of inconsistency between my  
objection to the constitutionality of such a  
Dank in 1791. and in 1817, turns on tho  
question, how far legislative precedents, ex­  
landed in the Constitution, ought to guide  
succeedint; Legislatures, Htid to overrule in­  
dividual opinions.  
Some obscurity has been thrown over the  
question by confounding it with the respect  
due by one Legislature to laws passed by pre­  
ceding Legislatures. But the two cases are  
essentially different. A (&#x27;unstilu&#x27;ion being  
derived from a superior authority, it is to be  
expounded and obeyed, not controlled or  
varied by the subordinate au&#x27;.liot ity of the  
Legislature. A law on the other hand,  
resting on no higher authority than that pos­  
sessed by every successive Legislature, its  
expediency as well as its meaning is within  
the scope of tho latter.  
The case in question has its iruO analogy  
jti the obligation urising from judicial exposi­  
tion of the law on succeeding judges ; iho  
Constitution being a law to the legislator, as&quot;  
the law is a rule of decision to the judge.  
And why are judicial precedents, when  
foimed on due discussion and consideration,  
and deliberately sanctioned by reviews and  
repetitions, regarded as of binding influence,  
or rather of authoritative force, in settling the  
meaning of the law? It must be answered,  
1st, because it is a reasonable and established  
axiom, that the good of society requires that  
the rules of conduct of its membeis should be  
certain and known, which would not be the  
case if any judge, disregarding the decisions  
of his predecessors, should vary the rule of  
law, acsordiog to his individual interpreta­  
tion of it. Shsera est servitus vbi jus est  
aut vagum aut iucogniluvl. 2d, because an  
exposition of the law, publicly made, and  
repeatedly confirmed by the constituted au-j  
  
thority, carries with it, by fair inference, tho  
sanction of those who, having made the law  
through their legislative organ, appear under  
such circumstances to have determined its  
meaning through their judiciary organ.  
Can ii be of less consequence that the  
meaning of a constitution should be fixed and  
known, than that the meaning of a law should  
be so? Can indeed a law be fixed in its  
meaning nnd operation, unless the constitu­  
tion be so? On the contrary, if a particular  
Legislature, differing in tho construction of  
the constitution, from a series of the piece­  
ding constructions, proceed to act on that dif­  
ference, they not only introduce uncertainty  
and instability in the constitution, but in the  
laws themselves; inasmuch us all laws pre­  
ceding the new constiuction, nnd inconsistent  
with it, are nut only annulled lor the future,  
but virtually pronounced nullities from the  
beginning.  
But it is said that the legislator, having  
  
sworn to support the constitution, must sup-  
poit it m his own construction of it, howevei  
different from that put on it by Ins predeces­  
sors, or whatever bo the consequences of iho  
construction. And is not the judge tinder  
the same oath to support tho law ? Yet, has  
it ever been supposed that he was required,  
or at liberty to disregard iill precedents, how  
ever solemnly repealed and legolarly ob­  
served; and, by giving effect to his own  
abstract and individual opinions, to disturb  
the established couse of practice in the  
business of the community . Has the wisest  
and most conscientiuus judge ever scrupled  
to acquiesce in decisions in which he has  
been overruled by the matured opinions of  
ilio majority of lits colleagues; and subse­  
quently to conform himfelf thereto, as to  
authoritative repositions of the law? And  
is it not reasonable tlmt the same view of the  
official oath should bo taken by h legislator,  
acting under the constitution, which is his  
guide, as is taken by n judge, acting under  
the law, which is his ?  
There is, in fact and in common under-  
standing, a necessity ol regarding a couise  
ufprnctico ns ab&#x27;ve characterized, in the  
light of a legal rule of interpreting a law;  
and llieic is a like necessity of considering  
it a constitutional rule of interp&#x27;cting a Con.  
Simmon.  
riiat there may be extiaordinaty and pe  
culiar circumstances controlling the rule in  
both cases, may bo admitted; but, with  
such exceptions, the rulo will force itself on  
the practical judgment of the must ardent  
lieoitsl. lie will find it impossible load-  
here to, nnd act offi . ially upon, his solitary  
opinions as to the meaning of the law or  
Constitution, in opposition to a construction  
reduced to practice, during a reasonable pe­  
tied of lime; mure especially where no  
prospect existed of a change of construction  
by Hie public or its agents. And if a rca-  
sonaiip.&#x27; period ot tune, inaiked with the  
usual sanctions, would not bar tlie indivi­  
dual pmrogative, there could bo no limita­  
tion to its exercise, although the danger of  
error must increase with the increasing obli­  
vion of explanatory ciicumslances, and with  
tho continual changes in the impoit of Words  
nnd phrases.  
Let it then bo left to tho decision of evory  
intelligent anil candid Judge, which, on the  
whole, is most to be relied on for tho due  
and safe construction of n Constitution, that  
which has the uniform sanction of successive  
legislative bodies through u period of years,  
and under tlie varied ascendancy of parties;  
or that which deponds upon the opinions of  
every new Legislature, healed ns it may be  
by tho spirit of party, eager in tho pursuit  
of soino favorite object, or led astray by tho  
eloquence and address of popular statesmen,  
themselves, perhaps, under tho influence of  
some misleading causes.  
It whs in conformity with tho view here  
taken of the respect due to deliberate and  
reiterated precedents (hat the Bank of the  
United States, though on the original ques­  
tion held to bo unconstitutional, received  
the Executive signature in the year 1817.  
The act onginally establishing a Bank had  
undergone ample discussions in its passage  
through thi sevnil branches of the Govern­  
ment. It had been carriod into execution  
throughout n period of twenty years, with  
annual legislative recognitions; in ono in­  
stance, indeed, with a positivo ramification  
of it into a new state, nnd with the entire  
acquiescence of all the local authorities, as  
well as of the nation at large; lo all of which  
may bo added a decreasing prnspeel of any  
change in the public opinion adverse to the  
constitutionality of such tin institution. A  
veto from the Executive, under these cir­  
cumstances, with an admission of the expe­  
diency and almost necessity of the measure,  
would havo been a defiance of all the obli­  
gations derived from a course of precedents  
amounting lo the requisite evidtneo of the  
national judgment and intention.  
Ii has been contended that the authority  
uf precedents was in that case1 invalidated by  
the consideration that they proved only a  
respect for tho stipulated duration of the  
Bank, with a toleration of it until the law  
should expire, and by the casting voto given  
in the Senate by the ice I resident, in the  
year 1811, against a bill for establishing n  
National Bank, the vote being expressly  
ginen on the ground of unconstitutionality.  
But if the law of itself was unconstitutional,  
the stipulation was void, and could not be  
constitutionally fulfilled or tolerated. And  
as lo the negative of tho Senate, by the cast­  
ing vote of the presiding officer, it is u fact  
well understood ai the time, that it resulted  
not Norn an equality of opinions in that as­  
sembly 00 the power of Congress to establish  
a Bank, btli from a junction of those who  
admitted the powor, but disapproved the  
plan, with those who denied tho power.  
On a simple question of constitutionality  
there was a decided majority in favor of it.  
Jambs Madison

MoxtTreLier, June 25, 1831,  
  
Dear Siri—l hnve received your friendly let  
ter of the 18th inst. “The few lines which an­  
swered your former one of the 215 t of January  
laet, were written in haste and in bad hea&#x27;lth;  
but they expressed, though without the al  
tention ip sume respects cue to the occasion,  
a dissent from the views of thie President, as  
to u Bank of the Umted States, and a substi  
tute for it; to which I cannot but adhere,—  
I&#x27;he objections to the latter have appeared to  
eto preponderate greatly over the advan­  
tages expected from i, undyllm constitution­  
shity of the former I still regard as sustained  
by the considerations to which | yielded, n  
giving my assent to the existing Bank.  
The charge of inconsistemey between my  
objection to the constitutionality of such  
bank in 1791, and my assent in 1817, turns on  
the question, how far legislative precedents,  
expounding the constitution, ought to guule  
gncceeding legislatures, aud to over-rule in­  
dividual opinions,  
Some obscurity has been thrown over the  
qicstion, by contounding it with the respect  
due from one legislature to lawas passed by  
preceding legislatures. But the twe cases  
ure cssentiolly different. A constitution be.  
ing derived from a superor authoriiy, 19 to be  
expounded and obeyed, not controlled or va­  
ried by the subordmiate authority of a legis.  
lature. A law on the other hand, resting on  
no higher anthority than that possessed by  
evary successive legirlature, its expediency  
as well a 9 its meening is within the scope ol  
the Intter, }  
  
‘The case in question has its true analogy ||  
in the obhigation ansing from judicial cxposi !&quot;  
tions of the law on succeeding Judges; &quot;&#x27;eix&#x27;  
constitution being a law to the legislator, as  
the luw 18 a rale of decision to the Judge. &quot;\
And why are jndiciul preeedents, when!  
formed on due discussion and cuusidcrﬂion.“  
and deliberutely sanctioned by reviews and ||  
repetitions, regarded as of binding ntuence ||  
or rather of authorntative forece, in uenlmul&#x27;  
the meaning of alaw ? It must be answer. |,  
ed, 15t, because it is a reasonable and estab.  
lished axiom, that the good of rocicty rvquireni&#x27;  
that the roles of conduct of its membeui]  
should be certain and kuown, which would &#x27;  
not be the case if any judge, disrezarding 7  
the docisions of his predecessors, should vary |  
the rule of law according to s individual in- |  
terpretation of it Misera est servitus üby &#x27;.  
jus est aut vagum aut incognitom. [That l  
servitude is miserable, when the law s either I  
uncertain or unknown.] 24, because an ex- ||  
position of the lnw publicly mnde,and repeat. ||  
cdly confirmed by the eonstituted uulhurlly,”  
carrivs with jt, by fair infercnce, the llnclmn‘i  
of those who, imv&#x27;mg made the law through  
their legislative organ, appear under sucl:l‘  
circumstances to have determined its mean- ||  
ing throngh their judiciary organ. h  
Can it be of less cousequence that the |  
meaning of a constitution should be fixed  
and known, than that the meaning of a law  
should be so? Can indeed a law be fixed mL!  
its meaning and operation, unless the consti- ||  
tution be so? On the conlrary, if a particu. “  
Inr legislature, differing 10 the construction |  
of the constitution, from a series of pn~cvdmg“  
constructions, proceed to act on that differ- l  
enee, they not only introduce uncertainty andll  
justability in the constitution, but in the laws |  
themselves 3 inasmuch as all laws prcccdmgl  
the new constiuction and inconsistent with|  
it, are ot only anoulled for the future, but |  
virtually pronvunced uullives from the be- (  
ginning. ‘  
But it is said that the legislator having“  
gworn to support the constitunion, must sup­  
port it in his own construction of 11, however  
different from that put on it by lus predeces­  
sors, or whatever be the consequences of the |  
construction. And is not the jodge under  
the sawe oath to support the law ? yet has it  
ever been supposed that he was required, or  
st liberiy to disregard nll precedents, how­  
ever solemnly repeated and regularly observ.  
¢4 5 and by giving effect to his own abstract|  
and individual opinions, to distarh the estab- |  
hished conese of practice in the business of |  
twe commmnity 2 Has the wisest and most |  
conscientions Judge ever scrupled to aequi­  
esce 1o covisions in which he has been over­  
ruled by the matured opinions of the majority  
of his eolleagnes ; and subsequently to con­  
form hunself thereto, as to authoritative ex­  
position&lt; of the law 2 And 18 it not reasona.

&quot;Can it be of less consequence that the mean­  
ing of a constitution should be fixed and known:  
than that the meaning of a law should be so?  
Can indeed, a law be fixed in its meaning and op­  
eration, unless the Constitution be so? On the  
contrary, if a particular legislature, differing in  
the construction of the Constitution from a series  
of preceding constructions, proceed to act on that  
difference, they not only introduce uncertainty  
and instability in the Constitution, but in the laws  
e  elare teaes  e il o tai e e  
theniseives; masmuch as an laws preetuing the  
new construction and inconsistent with it are not  
only annulled for the future, but virtually pro  
nounced nullities from the beginning.&quot;  
It was in conformity with these views that Mr.  
Madison saw fit to approve the Bank of the Uni-  
ted States, in 1517, though on the original ques­  
tion, he had held it to be unconstitutional. He  
believed the Constitutional question already settled  
by repeated acts of legislative recognitions &quot;in one  
instance indeed, with a positive ramification of it  
into a new state.&quot; Under these circumstances, he  
did not feel himself at liberty to raise a constitu-  
tional objection, for the reason that the question  
had once been raised, and had been setiled.  
Such was the reasoning of Mr. Madison. He  
has since been overruled in his opinion by Messrs  
Jackson and Tyler. They are governed by the  
constitution as ther understand it. They seem  
to understand the constitution much better tha

Madison while in theory denying that any  
appropriation could be made not specifi­
