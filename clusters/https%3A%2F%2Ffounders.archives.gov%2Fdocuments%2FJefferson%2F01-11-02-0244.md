usement, and abstraction from business, of which I had too much at Paris. I am glad to learn that you are employed in things new and good in your music and drawing. You know what have been my fears for some time past; that you do not employ yourself so closely as I could wish. You have promised me a more assiduous attention, and I have great confidence in what you promise. It is your future happiness which interests me, and nothing can contribute more to it (moral rectitude always excepted) than the contracting a habit of industry and activity. Of all the cankers of human happiness, none corrodes it with so silent, yet so baneful a tooth, as indolence. Body and mind both unemployed, our being becomes a burthen, and every object about us loathsome, even the dearest. Idleness begets ennui, ennui the hypochrondria, and that a diseased body. No laborious person was ever yet hysterical. Exercise and application produce order in our affairs, health of body, chearfulness of mind, and these make us precious to our friends. It is while we are young that the habit of industry is formed. If not then, it never is afterwards. The fortune of our lives therefore depends on employing well the short period of youth. If  at any moment, my dear, you catch yourself in idleness, start from it as you would from the precipice of a gulph. You are not however to consider yourself as unemployed while taking exercise. That is necessary for your health, and health is the first of all objects. For this reason if you leave your dancing master for the summer, you must increase your other exercise. I do not like your saying that you are unable to read the antient print of your Livy, but with the aid of your master. We are always equal to what we undertake with resolution. A little degree of this will enable you to decypher your Livy. If you always lean on your master, you will never be able to proceed without him. It is a part of the American character to consider nothing as desperate; to surmount every difficulty by resolution and contrivance. In Europe there are shops for every want. It’s inhabitants therefore have no idea that their wants can be furnished otherwise. Remote from all other aid, we are obliged to invent and to execute; to find means within ourselves, and not to lean on others. Consider therefore the conquering your Livy as an exercise in the habit of surmounting difficulties, a habit which will be necessary to you in the country where you are to live, and without which you will be thought a very helpless animal, and less esteemed. Music, drawing, books, invention and exercise will be so many resources to you against ennui. But there are others which to this object add that of utility. These are the needle, and domestic oeconomy. The latter you cannot learn here, but the former you may. In the country life of America there are many moments when a woman can have recourse to nothing but her needle for employment. In a dull company and in dull weather for instance. It is ill manners to read; it is ill manners to leave them; no cardplaying there among genteel people; that is abandoned to blackguards. The needle is then a valuable resource. Besides without knowing to use it herself, how can the mistress of a family direct the works of her servants? You ask me to write you long letters. I will do it my dear, on condition you will read them from time to time, and practice what they will inculcate. Their precepts will be dictated by experience, by a perfect knowlege of the situation in which you will be placed, and by the fondest love for you. This it is which makes me wish to see you more qualified than common. My expectations from you are high: yet not higher than you may attain. Industry and resolution are all that are wanting. No body in this world can make me so happy, or so miserable as you. Retirement from public life will ere long become necessary for me.  To your sister and yourself I look to render the evening of my life serene and contented. It’s morning has been clouded by loss after loss till I have nothing left but you. I do not doubt either your affection or dispositions. But great exertions are necessary, and you have little time left to make them. Be industrious then, my dear child. Think nothing unsurmountable by resolution and application, and you will be all that I wish you to be. You ask me if it is my desire you should dine at the abbess’s table? It is. Propose it as such to M

“T do not like your saying that you are unable  
to read the ancient print of your Livy, but with  
the aid of your master. We are always equal to  
what we undertake with resolution. A little degree  
of this will enable you to decipher your Livy. If  
you always lean on your master, you will never be  
able to proceed without him. It is a part of the  
American character to consider nothing as despe-  
rate—to surmount every difficulty by resolution  
and contrivance. In Europe there are shops for  
every want : its inhabitants therefore have no idea  
that their wants can be furnished otherwise. Re-  
mote from all other aid, we are obliged to invent  
and to execute; to find means within ourselves, and  
not to lean on others. Consider, therefore, the  
  
conquering your Livy as an exercise in the habit ,  
of surmounting difficulties; a habit which will be  
  
necessary to you in the country where you are to  
live, and without which you will be thought a very  
helpless animal, and less esteemed. Music, draw-  
ing, books, invention, and exercise, will be so many  
resources to you against ennui. But there are  
others which, to this object, add that of utility.  
These are the needle and domestic economy. The  
  
latter you cannot learn here, but the former you |  
  
may. In the country life of America there are  
many moments when a woman can have recourse  
to nothing but her needle for employment. Ina  
dull company and in dull weather, for instance, it  
is ill manners to read; it is ill manners to leave

&quot;I am gUd to. tears, my dear  
Patsy, that you are employed in  
things new and good. Of all the  
cankers of human happiness, none  
corrode with so silent yet so bale­  
ful an influence as indolence. Ex­  
ercise and application produce order  
in our affairs, health of body and  
cheerfulness of mind. If at any  
moment, my dear, yon catch your  
self in idleness, start from it as you  
would from the precipice of gulf.  
I do not like your saying that you  
are unable to read Livy but with  
the aid of a master. It is a part of  
the American character to surmount  
every difficulty by resolution.
