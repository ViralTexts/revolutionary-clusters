Sir Monticello Sep. 20. 13.  
Your fa letter of Aug. 20. enabled me to turn to mine of Feb. 23. 98. and your former one of Feb. 22. 1801. and to recall to my memory the oration at Jamaica which was the subject of them. I see with pleasure a continuance of the same sound principles in the address to mr Quincy. your quotation from the former paper alludes, as I presume, to the term of office of our Senate; a term, like that of the judges, too long for my approbation. I am for responsibilities at short periods; seeing neither reason nor safety in making public functionaries independant of the nation for life, or even for long terms of years. on this principle I prefer the Presidential term of 4. years, to that of 7. years which I myself had at first suggested, annexing to it however ineligibility for ever after; and I wish it were now annexed to the 2d quadrennial election of President.  
The conduct of Massachusets, which is the subject of your address to mr Quincy, is serious, as embarrassing the operations of the war, &amp;  
			 jeopardising it’s issue; and still more so, as an example of contumacy  
			 against the  
			 Constitution.  
			 one method of proving their  
			 purpose would be to call a Convention of their state, and to require them to declare themselves members of the Union, and obedient to it’s determinations, or not members, and let them go. put  
				this  
			 question solemnly to their people and their answer cannot be doubtful. one half of them are republicans, and would cling to the union from principle. of the other half, the dispassionate part  
				would  
			 consider 1. that they do not raise bread necessary sufficient for their own subsistence, and must go to Europe for the deficiency if excluded from our ports, which vital interests would force us to do. 2. that they are a navigating people without a stick of timber for the hull of a ship, nor a pound  
			 of any thing to export in it which would be admitted at any market. 3. that they are also a manufacturing people, and left by the exclusive system of Europe without a market but ours. 4. that as the rivals of England in manufactures, in commerce, in navigation, and fisheries, they would meet her competition in every point. 5. that England would feel no scruples in making the abandonment &amp; ruin of such a rival the price of a treaty with the producing states; whose interest too it would be to nourish a navigation beyond the  
			 Atlantic, rather than a hostile one at our own door. and 6. that in case of war with the Union, which occurrences between coterminous nations frequently produce it would be a contest of 1. against  
			 15.the remaining portion of the Federal moiety of the state would, I believe, brave all these obstacles, because they are monarchists in principle, bearing deadly hatred to their republican  
			 fellow citizens, impatient under the ascendancy of republican principles, devoted in their attachment to England, and preferring to be placed under her despotism, if they cannot hold the helm of government here. I see, in their separation, no evil but the example: and I believe that the effect of that  
			 would be corrected by an early and humiliating return to the Union, after losing much of the population of their country, insufficient in it’s own resources to feed numerous inhabitants and  
				inferior  
			 in all it’s allurements to the more inviting soils, climates, and government of the other states.whether a dispassionate discussion before the public, of the advantages &amp; disadvantages  
				of  
			 separation to both parties would be the best medecine for this dialytic fever, or to consider it as sacrilege ever to touch the question, may be doubted. I am myself generally disposed to indulge, &amp; to follow reason; and believe that in no case would it be  
			 safer  
			 than in the present. their refractory course however will not be unpunished by the indignation of their co-states, their loss of influence with them, the censures of history, &amp; the stain on  
				the  
			 character of their state.With my thanks for the paper inclosed accept the assurance of my esteem and respect.

forwer one of Februaty 2?, 1801, and 1o recall

wis the suljeet of thém. Isee with pleasue  
a continunhoe of the same sound principles in  
the address to Mr. Quincy. Youtr guotation  
from the former paper allndes, ns I pr sowmne,  
to the term of office of our Senate; a term like  
that of thé judges, too long for my approbation.  
1 am for rhr&amp;l:iblli ies at short periods; sees  
ing heither n hor ensfety in making {mblio  
functivnaties independent of the hatiom fof life  
or even fur long terms of years. On this prine  
ciple 1 prefer the presidentinl term of four  
mn. to that of seven years, which 1 myself  
first suggested, aunexing to it, however,  
ineligibility forever after, and I wish it were  
now annexcd to the second guadrenninl elee­  
tion of president. The condaet of Mussnchu­  
setts, which is the subject of your widres  
to Mr. Quiney, is serious as em­  
barrassing the operations of the war and  
jeopaurdizing ite issue, and still more s 0 ns w 0  
act of contumacy against the Comstitution.  
One method of proving their purpose won&#x27;d be  
to call convention of their State und to reguire  
thom to declure themselvos membexl&quot;:? the  
Union, and obedient Lo Me determin.tions or  
not memhe s, and lot them go. Put this gues­  
tion solemnly 1o their people nnd their answer  
eannot be doubtful. One-hall of them e  
Ropublienns, and would eling to the Union {rom  
principle. Of the other hall the dispuesionate  
purt would consider: 1. That they do not  
raise bread suflicient for their own su&#x27;»istence,  
and must go to Europe for the deficiency if ex«  
cluded from our ports, which vital interests  
would force we to do. 2. That they are o  
nnvigam:, people without a stick ol timber for  
the hull of a ship nor a {vound ol anything to  
export in 1t which would be admitted at anv  
market. 3. Thatthey are aleo a manufactur  
ing people, and left by the exclusive system of  
Europe without a murket but cors. 4. Tha

Mosticklio, September 20, U.S.  
To Mr. Jnmes Martini  
Sir Your letter ol&#x27; August 20 enables me a  
turn t nuns ol Februarv 23, 1798, and your  
former one of Februury 22, 1801, nd lo recall  
lo my memory th oration at Jamuloa, which  
was the siibj&#x27; ot of them. I see with planui  
a oontiuunnoe of the same sound piiuciples in  
the address to Mr. Quincy. Yoi r quotation  
hum ilia former paper allndos, as I pr. sumo,  
to the term of oflice of our Senate; a lorm like  
that of the judges, too long for my approbation.  
I am lor re.ionibil! ius at short periods s see.  
ing neithur toi.oii nor safety in making public  
luuotioniiries independent ol tho nation tor life  
or even for long terms of .veal&#x27;s. On this prin­  
ciple 1 prefer tho presidential tea ill ol four  
years to that of sot. il years, whioh I inysell  
had first suggested, annexing to it, howuver,  
ineligibility lorever oflar, and I wish it were  
now unmixed to the seonnd quudrenninl elec­  
tion of president. Tho ronduo. of MiiKSiichu.  
setts, whioh is the sulijoct of your udre-  
to Mr. Quincy, is sorious as em­  
barrassing ihe operations of the war and  
jeojiardiiing its issue, and still more so us an  
  
aotot coututnaoy iigains. the Constitution.  
One method of proving their purpose woa&#x27;tl bs  
to call convention of their Slate and to require  
Ihom to declare themselves inemheisot the  
Union, and obedient to its determinations, or  
not intra ie: s, and let tlitln go. Put this ques­  
ti n solemnly to their people and their answer  
cannot ha doubtful. One-half of them are  
Itupublioiins, and would eling to the ITuionlVoin  
principle. 01 the other hull tho dispnssiouato  
part would consider: 1. That Ihey do not  
latse bread tutlioient for the r own subsistence,  
and must go to Europe for the deficiency if ex.  
o&#x27;uded from our ports, which vital interests  
would force us to do. 2. That they are e  
navigating people without a stick of timber fo(  
tho hull of a ship nor a pound ol anything to  
export in it which would be admitted at anv  
market. 3. Thai they are also a mnnulnotur  
ing people, and left by the exolusive syteni id  
Europe without a market but mis. 4. That  
as the&#x27; rivals of Iingb.nd in manufactures, in  
Commerce, in navigation und fishe: &#x27; &quot;&quot;J  
would meet her competition in every point.  
6. That England would feel no scruples in  
making the abandonment and ruin of such a  
rival the rice cf a treaty with the producing  
States, whoso interest, too, it would bo to  
nourish a navigation beyond the AUivntio  
rather than a hostile one at our own door. And  
0. That in onse ol wr with tho Union, which  
occurrences between coterminous nations fre­  
O&#x27;lentlv produce, it would be a oontest of 1  
  
against 13. The remaining poition of the  
Federal moiety of the state would, I believe,  
brave all these obstacles, because they are  
monarchists in principle, bearing deadly hatred  
to their republican fellow-citizens, impatient  
under tho usoendnncy of republican principle,  
devoted in their attachment to England, and  
nreterr.nir to be placed under her despotism ii  
  
they cannot hold tho holm of uovemment here.  
1 see in their separation no evil lint the ex.  
ample, and I beliove that the effect of that  
would ba oorrecteil by an early and humiliat­  
ing return totlie Union, after losing much of  
the population of their country, insufficient in  
its own resomocs to food numerous inhabitants,  
and inferior in all i&#x27;s allurements to tho more  
inviting so.is, climates, and government of the  
other states. Whether a dispassionate discus­  
sion before the public of the advantages and  
disad van ages of separation to both parties  
wouid ue the best medicine for this dinlyio  
fever, or to consider it as sacrilege over to  
touch the question, may bo doubted. I am  
myselt generally dispo ed to indulge and to  
loliow reason, and bjlieve that in no ease  
would it be safer than in the present. Their  
rnfrnetory oourse, however, will not bo unpun­  
ished by the indignation of their co-9iates,  
their loss of iiiflu- nee witli them, the ceusurei  
ol historc, and the stain on the character ol  
their stale. With my llinnks for the paper in­  
closed, aocept the assurance of my esteem and  
respect. Th. Jkitehsos
