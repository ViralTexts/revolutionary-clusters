Oaks—near Geo: Town S.C.July 6th. 1808  
  
The Legislature of South-Carolina, deeply impressed with the situation in which the U. States have been placed by the unfounded &amp; arrogant pretensions of the belligerent Powers of Europe; &amp; aware of the force derived; in a Government like our’s, from public opinion; have deemed it incumbent upon them, at the present crisis, to make known to the World their unalterable determination to support the rights &amp; honor of our Country, &amp; to declare their entire approbation of the prudent &amp; dignified course pursued by its Administration. To this manifestation of their own feelings they have been yet further induced by the expression, in other parts of the Union, of contrary sentiments, at a moment when, it is conceived, that a sacrifice of the conflicting opinions of individuals &amp; the animosities of party were demanded alike by sound policy &amp; by patriotism.—  
The Resolutions I have now the honor to transmit you, obtained, as you will perceive, the unanimous concurrence of both branches of our Legislature. A conclusion, however, from this circumstance, either that there existed among us a perfect unanimity of political opinion, or that the present restrictions upon our commerce were but little felt by us, now be equally erroneous. South-Carolina, like her Sister States, has, to a certain extent, her parties [in] the Legislature, which adopted these Resolutions consisted, to use the distinguishing appelation of the day, of Republicans &amp; of Federalists. But, Sir, however various may be our opinions as to questions of ordinary policy, we should deprecate, as disgraceful to us, the idea of division when the national honor or interests were to be defended.—Of the effects attendant, in all Countries, upon the sudden suspension of trade in this State, from a variety of circumstances, is very far from being insensible. But if the inconveniences or privations resulting to our citizens from the Embargo be great, their patriotism &amp; public virtue are yet greater; &amp; I am persuaded that the members of the Legislature are the faithful organs of their Constituents, when they declare their determination, at every hazard, “to support the General Government in all measures calculated to maintain the rights &amp; support the independence of the United States.”—  
I have the honor, to be, Sir, very respectfully, yours &amp;c

Oaks, near Georgetown, S. C.  
o &#x27;PU T July 6, 180«.  
Mr— i he Legislature of South-Ca­  
lolina, deeply impressed with the situ­  
ation in which the United States h tve  
been placed, by the unfounded and ar­  
rogant pretensions of the belligerent  
powers of Europe ; and aware of tho  
force derived, in a government like  
ours, ^ from public opinion, have  
thought it right, at such a crisis, *o  
make known to the world their unal­  
t..ia.,!c determination to support the  
  
“V ’ “““ Munor oi our country, and  
to declare tneir entire approbation of  
the prudent and dignified course pur­  
sued by its administration. To this  
manifestation of their own feeli‘&#x27;rs,  
tne\ have been yet further induced  
jy the expression, in other parts of the  
union, of contrary sentiment &#x27;, at a mo­  
ment when, it is conceived, that a sacri­  
fice of the conflicting opinions of indi­  
viduals, and the animosities of party,  
was demanded alike by sound policy  
and by patriotism.  
The Resolutions I have now the ho­  
nor to transmit you, obtained, you will  
petceive, tlie unanimous concurrence  
of both branches of our legislature.  
A conclusion from hence, however,  
either that there existed among us a  
perfect unanimity of political srnti.  
inent, or th it til present restrictions  
upon our commerce were but little felt  
by ns, would be equally erroneous.—  
South-Garolina, like her sister states,  
is, to a certain extent, characterised by  
parties. 1 he Legislature, which a­  
dopted these Resolutions, consisted,  
to use the distinguishing appellations  
of the day, of Federalists and Huput­  
licans.—• Rut, sir however we may dif­  
fer as to questions of ordinary policy,  
we should deprecate as disgraceful  
to us, the idea of division whore the  
national honor or interests were con­  
cerned. Of the effects, attend-,in  
all countries, upon a sudden su*p-\rj.  
nn of trade, many cir .ms-antes com&#x27;  
bine to render this State far from in­  
sensible : JJuf, if the inconvcni* nces  
or privations resulting to our citizens
