o me a wild Measure and I endeavored to dissuade those gentlemen from it who mentioned it to me; it seems now to be given up. The Object with many is to take Mr Burr &amp; I should not be surpriz’d if that Measure were adopted. Not meaning to enter into Intrigues I have meerly exprest the Opinion that since it was evidently the Intention of our fellow Citizens to make Mr Jefferson the President it seems proper to fulfill that Intention. The Answer is simple and in meer Reasoning conclus⟨ive⟩ but it is not conclusive to unimpassioned Sentim⟨ent.⟩ Let the Representatives do what they may they will not want Argument to justify them, and the Situation of our Country (doomed perhaps to sustain unsupported A War against France or England) seems indeed to call for a vigorous practical Man. Mr Burr will it is said come hither, and some who pretend to know his Views think he will bargain with the Federalists. Of such Bargain I shall know Nothing and having declar’d my Determination to support the constitutionally appointed Administration so long as it’s Acts shall not in my Judgment be essentially wrong my personal Line of Conduct gives me no Difficulty but I am not without serious Apprehensions for the future State of Things.
