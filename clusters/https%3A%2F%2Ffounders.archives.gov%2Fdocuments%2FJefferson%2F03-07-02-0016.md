Sepr 21: 1810 not only of the blockade from Elbe to Brest, but of those of Zealand, and of the Isles of Mauritious &amp; Bourbon—And in his Letter of Jany 14th 1811 to the same minister, he speaks also of other Blockades (including that of Zealand) which the United States expected to see recalled; besides the blockade of May. In this Letter he suggests an idea, directly calculated, and perhaps designed to alarm the British ministry; as to the ulterior views of our government, on the subject of blockade in general; and to discourage them from a compliance with our demands. Concerning the blockade of May; he observes, “It is by no means clear, that it may not be fairly contended, that a maritime blockade is incomplete, with regard to States at peace; unless the place which it would affect, is invested by land, as well as by sea.”  
Apprehensive that some shuffling conduct of this kind, would be the result of an official communication with Mr Pinkney, I urged in my Letter to Sir John Sinclair; and to other gentlemen in London w

It may be generally observed, that the larger the extent of a republics, the more they are subject to revolutions and misfortunes. Already the citizens of the United States, inhabiting the southern and northern portions of the republic regard each other with jealousy, and suspicion, What then of concord can be expected in our councils, from the hetorigenioushetorogenious population of Canada and Florida?  
			 On this account I am not afraid to say; it is almost equally unhappy for its government to succeed or miscarry in its enterprizes of conquest—The tranquillity of our republican government,  
			 depends upon preserving it within its present limits—We enjoy every advantage of extent of territory, climate and soil; to render us completely happy The true interest of the United States is to render us compl her own interior condition such as may make her not only independent but respected by other nations. This is only difficult to Statesmen, who can conceive no other methods to effect it, than  
			 war and violence—methods that ought never to be pursued without the most absolute necessity.
