ed that redress is insidiously withheld lest the example should be followed. The communications  
						and instructions forwarded by Mr. Purviance who was a passenger in the St. Michael will enable you to bring the British Government to a fair issue on the subject of its orders. If it has nothing more in view than it is willing to avow, it cannot refuse to concur in an  
						arrangement, rescinding on her part the orders in Council, and on ours, the Embargo. If France should concur in a like arrangement, the state of things will be restored which is the alleged object of the orders. If France does not concur the orders will be better enforced by

					It appears that the British Government not satisfied with the general blockade by her orders of Novr. 11th. has superadded a particular blockade, or rather a diplomatic notification of an intended one of Copenhagen and the other

						blockade within the true definition should be carried into effect. And as all defective blockades, whether so in the disproportion of force to the object, or in the mode of notification, will authorize fair claims of indemnification, it is the more necessary that guarded

					Since the British order of  evidently inviting our Citizens to violate the laws of their Country, by patronizing on the high seas their vessels destitute of Registers and other necessary papers, and therefore necessarily  
						smugglers, if not pirates, the circular letter of Mr. Huskisson has made its appearance, in which the United States are named as alone within the purview of the order. A more disorganizing and dishonorable experiment is perhaps not to be found in the annals of modern  
						transactions. It is aggravated, too, by every circumstance that could make it reproachful. It is levelled against a nation towards which friendship is professed, as well as against a law the justice and validity of which is not contested; and it sets the odious example, in  
						the face of the world, directly in opposition to all the principles which the British Government has been proclaiming to it. What becomes of the charge against the United States for receiving British subjects who leave their own Country contrary to their allegiance? What

						prevail here against the Americans in Europe who are trading under British licenses, and thereby sacrificing as far as they can the Independence of their Country, as well as frustrating the laws which were intended to guard American vessels and mariners from the dangers  
						incident to foreign commerce, that their continuance in that career ought to be frowned upon, and their return home promoted in every proper manner. It appears by information from our Consul at Tangier that great numbers of our vessels are engaged in a trade between Great

Depariment of Siate,  
July 18th, 1808.  
  
Your communications by tieut.  
Lewis were safely delivered on  
the evening of the 8th inst.  
  
As it had been calculated that  
the interva] between the return of  
Mr. Rose, and the departure of  
lieutenant Lewis, would give suf-  
ficient time to the British govern-  
ment to decide on the course re-  
quired by the posture in which  
the affair of the Chesapeake was  
left, its silence to you on that sub-  
ject could not fail to excite the  
particular attention of the presi-  
dent : and the appearance is ren-  
dered the more unfavorable by the  
like silence, as we learn from Mr.  
Erskine, of the dispatches  
brought to him by the packet  
which left England and arrived at  
New York at nearly the same  
time with the Osage. I have  
intimated to Mr. Erskine the im-  
pressions made by this reserve,  
without, however, concealing our  
hope that the delay does not im-  
ply a final purpose of withholding  
reparation, and that the next  
communications from London  
will be of a different import.  
They must et least ascertain the  
real views of the British govern~

ment on this interesting subject.  
  
‘There was certainly no just  
ground for Mr. Canning to ex-  
pect any particular communica-  
tions from you on the arrival of  
the Osage, unless they should  
have grown out of such accounts  
from France as would second our  
demands of justice from Great  
Britain, particularly the revoca-  
tion of her orders in council : and  
in imparting to him what you did  
from that quarter, every proof of  
candor was given which the occa-  
sion admitted.  
  
If Mr. Canning was disap-  
pointed, because he did not re-  
ceive fresh complaints against the  
orders in council, he ought to  
have recollected, that you had  
sufficiently dwelt on their offen-  
sive features, in the first instance ;  
and that as he had chosento make  
the formal communication of  
them to this government through  
another channel, it was through  
that channel, rather than through  
you, that answers to it would be  
most regularly given.  
  
The communications and in-  
structions forwarded by Mr. Pur-  
xiance, who was a passenger in  
the St. Michael, will enable you  
to bring the British government  
to a fair issue on the subject of  
its orders. If it has nothing more  
in view than it is willing to avow,  
it cannot refuse to concur in an  
arrangement, rescinding, on her  
part, the orders in council; and  
on ours, the embargo. If France  
should concur in a like arrange-  
ment, the state of things will be  
restored, which is the alleged ob-  
ject of the orders. If France  
does not concur, the orders will  
be better enforced by the conti-  
nuance of the embargo against  
her, than they are by the British  
  
fleets and cruisers, and in the  
mean time, all the benefits of our  
trade will be thrown into the lap  
of Great Britain. It will be diffi-  
cult, therefore, to conceive any  
motive in Great Britain to reject  
the offer which you will- have  
made, other than the hope of in-  
ducing, on the part of France, a  
perseverance in her irritating po-  
licy towards the United States,  
and, on the part of the latter, hos-  
tile resentments against it.  
  
If the British government  
should have elected the more  
  
wise and more worthy course, of [  
  
meeting the overture of the pre-  
sident, in the spirit which dictat-  
ed it, it is to be hoped, that mea-  
sures will have been taken in con-  
cert with you, and through its  
minister here, for hastening, as  
much as possible, the renewal of  
  
‘the intercourse, which the or-  
  
ders and the embargo have sus-  
pended, and thereby smoothing  
the way for other salutary adjust-  
ments.  
  
It appears that the British go-  
vernment, not satisfied with the  
general blockade, by her orders  
of November 1ith, has super-  
added a particular blockade, or  
rather a diplomatic notification of  
an intended one, of Copenhagen,  
and the other perts in the island  
of Zealand; that is to say, a  
strict and legal blockade of the  
whole island. The island cannot  
be much less than two hundred  
miles in its outline, and is de-  
scribed as abounding in inlets. It  
is not probable, therefore, if it be  
possible, that the blockade, with-  
in the true definition, should be  
carried into effect. And as all  
defective blockades, whether so

the object, or in the mode of no-

tification, will authorise fair  
claims of indemnification, it is  
the more necessary that guarded  
answers should be given, in such  
cases, as heretofore siggested.  
Since the British order of  
  
evidently inviting our citizens to  
violate the laws of their country,  
by patronizing on the high seas  
their vessels destitute of regis-  
ters, and other necessary papers,  
and therefore, necessarily smug-  
glers, if not pirates, the circular  
letter of Mr. Huskisson has made  
its appearance; in which the  
United States are named as alone  
within the purview of the order.  
A more extraordinary experi-  
ment is, perhaps, not to be found  
in the annals of modern transac-  
tions. It is levelled, moreover,  
against a nation towards which  
friendship is professed, as well as  
against a law, the justice and va-  
lidity of which are not contested ;  
and it sets the odious example,  
in the face of the world, directly  
in Opposition to all the principles  
which the British government  
has been proclaiming to it. What  
becomes of the charge against  
the United States for receiving  
British subjects who leave their  
own country contrary to their al-  
legiance? What would be the  
charge against them, if they were  
by proclamation, to invite British  
subjects, those too expressly and  
particularly prohibited from leav-  
ing their country, to elude the  
prohibition ; or to tempt, by in-  
terested inducements, a smug-  
gling violation or evasion of laws,  
en which Great Britain founds so  
material a part of her national  
pelicy’ In the midst of so many  
more important topics of dissatis-  
faction, this may not be worth a  
representation. -But it  
  
will not be amiss to let that go-  
vernment understand the light in  
which the proceeding is regarded  
by this. I have already touched  
on itto Mr. Erskine, withan in-  
timation that I should not omit it  
in my observations to you.  
  
The French decree, said to  
have been issued at Bayonne, has  
not yet reached this country.  
Such a decree, at sucha time,  
has a serious aspect on the rela-  
tions of the two countries, and  
will form a heavy item in our de-  
mands of redress. It is much to  
be regretted, at the same time,  
that any of our vessels, by ne-  
glecting to return home, and con-  
forming to the arbitrary regula-  
tions of one belligerent, should  
expose themselves to the arbitra-  
ry proceedings of another. So  
strong and general an indi  
tion seems particularly to prevail  
here against the Americans in  
Europe, who are trading under  
British licenses, and thereby sa-  
crificing, as far as they can, the  
independence of their country, as  
wellas frustrating the laws which  
were intended to guard Ameri-.  
can vessels and mariners from  
the dangers incident to foreign  
commerce, that their continuance  
in that career ought to be frowned  
upon, and their return home pro-  
moted in every proper manner.  
It appears, by information from

numbers of our vessels are en-  
gaged ina trade between Great  
Britain and Spanish ports, under

that the experiment proves as

Mr. Erskine the impressions made by this reserve,  
without, however, concealing our hope tliat the de­  
lay does not imply a Hum I purpose of withholding  
reparation, and that the next communications from  
London wilt he of a different import. They must at  
least ascertain the real views of the British govern­  
ment on this interesting subject.  
“ There was certainly no just ground for Mr.  
Canning to expert any particular romimum atoms  
from you on the arrival of the Osage, unless they  
should have grown out of such accounts from France  
sts would second our demands of justice from Great­  
Britain, particularly the revocation of her orders in

from that (juarter, every proof of candor was given,  
which the occasion annulled.

ment, through another cb.mm I, it « ts through  
that channel, rather than through you, that an­  
swers to it would he most regal.irly given.”  
“The romniuuir.!lions an.l lust met ions forwarded  
by Mi. Purviance, who was a passenger in the St.  
Iilirnael, will enable you to bring the British gov­  
ernment to a fair issue on the subject .4 its orders.  
It it lies nothing more in view than .it is willing to

France does not concur, li e orders will he better  
enforced by the continuance of the end,arco against  
her, than thfy are by thr British fleets and cruisers  
—and, in the mean lime, all the benefits of our  
trade will hi- thrown into the Up of Great Britain.  
It will he difficult,(therefore, looonrrivc any motive  
in Great Britain to rejee-t the otfrr which you will  
have made, other thru the hope of inducing, on the  
p rl of France, a perseverance m her irritating pn­  
liry towards the United States, and on the part of  
the latter, hostile resentments against it.  
“ ff ti e British government should have alerted

“ It appears that the British govei nroinl, not sa­

November 1 Itb, Iws stipernddrd a particular hlork­

probable, therefor-&#x27;, i t be possible, that a blockade,  
within the liwdehi &#x27; n,could he carried into&lt;(1. rl.  
And-as all debt &gt; lor hades, whether so in the

“ Since the British order of evidently in­  
viting our citizens to violate the laws ol their coun­  
try, by patronizing on the high seas their vessels  
destitute of registers and other necessary papers,  
and there rr necessarily smugglers, if not pirates,  
the circul .1 letter of Mr, 1 fuskisson, has made its  
npp&#x27; .ranee, in which the United Suites are named  
Iks alone within the purview of the order. A more  
extraordinary experiment is perhaps not to he found  
in the ann-rls of modern transactions. 11 is levell. d  
moreover against a nation, towards which fri, lid­

tire and validity of which is not contested ; and it  
sets the odious example, in the face of the world, di­  
rectly in opposition to all the principles which the  
British government has been proclaiming to it.­  
What becomes of the charge against the United  
Stales for receiving British subjects, those too ex­  
pressly and particularly prohibit. .1 fiom leaving  
their country, to elude the prohibition, or to tempt,  
by interested inducements, a smuggling violation or  
evasion of laws, on which Great Britain founds so  
material a part of her national policy ? In the midst  
of so many more important topicks of dissatisfac­  
tion, this may not he worth a turnial representation.  
But il will not I e amiss to let that government un­  
derstand the light in which the proceeding is regard­

it tierrhp, at such a tune, lias a seriolii aspect- on the  
rel.il lifts of the two countries, and will form a hea­

ons from I.ondnn wil he a different im  
port. They must at e.t«t a -certain tne real  
views of the British g ivenmunt on this in­  
teresting subject.  
There were ce ainlv no j 1st grounds for  
Air. Canning to 1 xpect anv painrular com­  
munications from \ «u -») &#x27;he arrival o&#x27;the  
0»age, times. ;hev s i mid &#x27;live g v/11 o . f

council. And in lmpnr-i .g u. him what  
you did from that qnar»er, eterv proof -f  
candor was given which the occasion admit­  
ted.  
  
If Mr. Canning was disappointed, because ;  
he did not receive fresh comp-amts against ]  
the orders in council, lie &lt;»nr,ht to have re- i  
collected that yon had suffio tenth dwelt on  
their offensive features in the hvst instance; !  
and that as lie had chosen to make the ter- !  
mal.communication of them t&lt;i this truvern- !  
meut, through another channel, it was thro’ !  
that channel, rather than thmtgh yon, tiial !  
answers to it would be most tegularly giv- |  
en.”  
“ The communications ant instructions  
forwarded by Mr. Purvinnctj, who was a  
passenger in the St. Michael, will enable  
vou to bring the British government to a  
fair issue on the subject of its orders. If it I  
has nothing more in view than it is willing to  
avow, it cannot refuse to coicur in an ar­  
rangement, rescinding on her part the or­  
ders in council, and on ours, the embargo.—  
If France should concur in a like arrange­  
ment, the state of things will be restored,  
which is the alledged object of the orders.—  
If France does not concur, the orders will  
be better enforced by the continuance of the  
embargo against her, than they are by the  
British fleets and cruisers; and, in the mean  
time, all the benefits of our trade will he  
thrown into the lap of Great Britain. It  
will be difficult, therefore, to conceive any  
motive in Great Britain to reject the offer  
which you will have m \de, other than the  
hope of inducing, on the part ot France, a  
perseverance in her irritating policy towards  
the United States, and on the part of the  
j latter, hostile resentments against it.  
| If the British government should have e­  
| lected the more wise and the more worthy  
I course of meeting the overture of the Pre­  
sident in the spirit which dictated it, it is  
to be hoped that measures will have been  
taken to concert with you, and through its  
minister here, for hastening as much as pos­  
sible, the renewal of the intercourse which  
the orders and the embargo have suspended,  
and thereby smoothing the woy for other sa­  
lutary adjustments. &#x27;  
“ It appears that the British government  
not satisfied with the general blockade by  
her orders ol November 11th has superad­  
ded a particular blockade, or raiher a di­  
plomatic notification of an intended one of  
Copenhagen and (he -&#x27;her /torts in the is  
land of Zealand ; that is to say, a strict and  
legal blockade of the who.e island. The  
island cannot he much less than tw i hun­  
dred miles in its oil line, and is described as  
abounding in inlets It is not probable,  
therefore, if it be ,v. sib&gt;e, that a borkade,  
within the true definition, &gt;h aid be caried  
into effect. And as all defective bi*&gt;ck ties,  
whether so in tile disproportion of force to  
the object, or in the ;n ;*■’? of notification,  
will authorise fair claims of indemr ideation,  
it is the more necessary tha giaidcd an­  
swers should be given in suchcasc^, uahere­  
tofore suggested.  
  
Since the British order of  
evidently inviting our citizens to violate the  
laws of their country, by patrnnieuig&#x27;on the  
high seas their vest-els destitute &lt;&gt;! registers  
and other necessur&gt; papers, ai d therefore  
necessarily smugglers, it not pirates, the  
Circular letter of Mr. Hnskissnn has made  
its appearance, in which the United States  
are named as alone within the purview of  
the order. A more extraordinary experi­  
ment is perhaps not to be found in the an­  
nals of modern transactions. It is levelled  
moreover against a nation towards which  
I friendship is professed, as well as against a  
j law, the justice and validity of which is not  
I contested ; and it sets the odious example,  
| in the face of the world, directly in opposi­  
tion to all the principles which the British  
government has beenproclainiingto it. What  
becomes of the charge against the United  
States for receiving Bi itish subjects, who  
leave their own country contrary to their  
allegiance? What would be the charge a­  
gainst them, if they were, by proclamation,  
to invite British subjects, those too express­  
ly and particularly prohibited from leaving  
their country, to elude the prohibition, or to  
tempt, by interested inducements, a smug­  
gling violation or evasion of laws, on which  
Great Britain founds so material a part of  
her national policy? In the midst of so ma­  
ny more important topics of dissatisfaction,  
this may not be worth a formal repre­  
sentation. But it will not bt* amiss to let  
that government understand the light in  
which the proceeding is regarded by this.—  
I have already touched on it toMr. Erskine,  
with an intimation that I should not omit it  
in my observations to you.  
The French decree said to have been is­  
sued at Bayonne has not yet reached this  
country. Such a decree, at such a time, has  
a serious aspect on the relations of the two  
countries, and will form a heavy item in our  
demands of redress. It is much to he re­  
gretted at the same time that any of n.ir ves­  
sels, by neglecting to return home, and con­  
forming to the arbitrary regulations of one  
belligerent, should expose themselves to the  
arbitrary proceedings of another. So strong  
ind general indignation sc&lt; ms particularly  
o prevail here ag-tinst the Americans in  
Europe who arc tending under British li­  
cences, and thereby sacrificing, as f ir as  
they can, the independence of their country,  
as well as frustrating the laws t.hicli were  
  
intended to guard Arsertcan vessels and *n*- j  
ruiers t&#x27;nun the dang^s incident to foreign .  
commerce, that their cououuuncc in that j  
career ought to be frowned upon, and their:  
return home promoted in every proper man-j  
per. It ip|*ear» by information from orr|

ur vessels are engaged in a trade between  
Great i’ritain and Spanish p.rts, under li­

ri lent proves as unsuccessful as it is dis­  
honorable ; tnc greater part of them being

soli seat ti ne to the British governin&#x27; nt to

t on of the President: and the appearance  
is rendered the more unfavorable t&gt;v the  
1 kc silence, as we lean from Mr Erskine,  
of the dispatches brought to him by h  
p i :ket wh ch left England and arrive I •

out, however, concealing our hope t&quot;.at tin

ferent import. Tncy must at least ascer_  
taiu the real vie ws of the British govern­

“There was certainly no just ground for  
Mr. Canning to expect any particular com­  
munications from y u on the arrival of the  
Osage, unless they should have grown out  
of such accounts from France as would se­  
cond our demands of justice from G. Brit­

mitted.  
•* If Mr. Canning was disappointed, be­

have recollect&#x27;d that you had sufficiently  
dwelt on their offensive features in the first  
ix&gt;tance; and that as he had chosen to  
make the formal communication of them to  
tins government, through another cnannel,  
it w .s through that channel, rather than  
through you, that answers to it would be

f.rwarded by Mr. Purvinnce, who wa&lt; a  
passing r i&lt;i the St Michael, wnl enable  
y u to brirg the British government to a fair  
issue on toe subject of its orders. If it has  
no hing more in view than it is willing tc

der*&lt; in council, and on ours, the embargo,  
&#x27;If France should concur in a like arrange.,  
inent, the state of things will be restored,  
which is the alleged object of the or­  
&#x27; ders. If France does not concur, the or.  
&#x27; ders will be be,ter enforced by the conti­  
nuance of the embargo against her, than  
they are hy the British fleets and ernizers;  
and, in the mean time, all the benefits ol  
i onr trade will be thrown into the lap of G.  
• Britain. It will be difficult, therefore, t&lt;  
’ conceive any motive in Great Britain tore  
ject the offer which you will have made  
&#x27; other than the hope of inducing, on the ptr

“ It appears that the Br tish governni mu,  
not satisfied with the ge .1 ,.«kic y  
her orders of November 1 lih, has supvrad­  
d -d a particular block de. or iuh i di­  
plomatic notification of an intended one, of  
Copenha ;«ii and the otfu-r ft or;* in the  
island of Zealand; th it is to siv, a sr.iict  
and legal blockade of the whole is’a&#x27;id. The  
i&#x27;.iand cannot be much less than two hun­  
dred miles in its on line, and is descri­  
bed is abounding in inlets. It is not pro*  
bable, therefore, if it be possible, that a  
blockade, within the true definition, should  
be carried into effect. And as all defect­  
ive block ides, whether so in the dispropor­  
tion of force to the object, or in the mode  
ot notification, will authorise fair claims of  
indemuific uion, it is the more necessary  
i that guarded answers should b; given in  
such cases, as heretofore suggested.  
“ Since the British order of  
evidently inviting our citizens to vio­  
late the laws of their country, bv pa­  
tronizing on the high seas their ves­  
sels destitute of registers and other  
necessary papers, and therefore ne­  
-ssarily smugglers, if not pirates, the  
circular letter of Mr. Hu: Lis son has  
made its app arance, in which the U.  
itates are named as alone within the  
nurview of the order. A more extra­  
ordinary experiment is perhaps not to  
be found in the ann.ds of modi r i  
transactions. It is levelled moreover a­  
1 gainst a nation towards which friend­  
ship is professed, as well as auainst a  
law, the justice and validity of which  
is not contested ; and it sets the odi­  
ous example, in the face of the world,  
directly in opposition to all the princi­  
ples which the British government has  
been proclaiming to it. What be­  
comes ot the charge against the U.  
States for receiving Biitish subjects,  
who leave their own country contrary  
t &lt; their allecdrinr.e ? VVknt ttf Atilrl Iia

»rly prohibit* d from leaving th ir  
co intry, to elud.* the proh bition, or :t&gt;  
t :npt. by inte-es*ecl inducements, a  
s o g^ling vio&#x27; t n or evasion of  
aw*, on which G. 13. founds so mate­  
mi a parr, of h r n t :on d policy ? In  
the naif!st «&gt;f*o man) mor important  
topics of tli-satisfac i &gt;n, this mav not  
oe worth a formal r-presentation.  
! But it wifi not he amiss to 1 t that yo­  
vemmrnt understand the light in  
j wni h the proceeding is regarded by  
j ’his. 1 h ».ve already tout lied on it to  
Mr. Ersk ine, with an in:ima: on that  
j I should not omit it in my observati­  
ons t*. you.  
i “ I he French decree said to have  
Dren i ued at Bayonne has not yet  
reached this country. Such a decree,  
t sti.h a time, has a serious aspect on  
the r lations of the two countries, and  
will form a heavy item in our demands  
of redress. It is much to be regret­  
ted at the same time that a ty of our  
vessels, by neglecting to return home,  
and conforming to the arbitrary regu­  
lations of one belligerent, should ex­  
pose themselves to the arbitrary pro­  
ceedings of another. So strong and  
general an indignation seems particu­  
larly to prevail here against the Ame­  
ricans in Europe who are trading un­  
der British licences, and thereby sa­  
crificing, as far as they can, the inde­  
pendence of their countrv, as well as  
frustrating the laws which were in­  
tended to guard American vessels and  
mariners from the dangers incident to  
foreitrn commerce, that tlicirmniln,..  
  
ance m that career ought to be frown­  
ed upon, and their return home pro­  
moted in every proper manner. It ap­  
pears by information from our consul  
at Tangiers, that great numbers of our  
vessels are engaged in a trade b tween  
(ireat Britain and Spainish ports, un .  
der licences from the former, and that  
the experiment proves as unsuccessful  
as it is dishonorable; the greater part  
of them being either a~rested in port,  
or by French and Spani h cruisers.

dnet, that, as there had been stifH  
cient time since MrRose&#x27;s re-  
turn, no mention was made of the  
affiirof the Chesapeake. i The  
communications and instructions  
forwarded by Mr. Purviancewho  
was a passenger in the St.Michael,  
will enable you to bring the Bri  
tisl government to a fair issue on  
the. subject of its ordtrs. If it has  
nothing more in view than it is  
willing to avow, it cannot retusc  
to concur in an arrangement, res­  
cinding on her part the &quot;orders in  
council, and on ours the embargo.  
If iFrance should concur in a like  
arrangement, the state of things  
will be restored, which is the al  
iened obiect of the orders, if  
France does not concur, the or­  
ders will be better enforced by the  
continuance of the embargo against  
her, than they are by the British  
fleets and cruizers ; and, in the  
mean time, all the benefits of our  
trade will be thrown into the lap  
t)f Great-Britain. It will be diffi­  
cult, therefore, to conceive any  
motive in Great- Britain to reject  
the offer which you will have made,  
other than the hope of inducing, on  
the part of France, a perseverance  
in her irritating policy towards the  
United States, and on the part of  
the latter hostile resentments a­  
gainst it- If the British govern  
meat should have elected the more  
wise and more worthy course of  
meeting the overture of the Presi  
dent in the spirit which dictated, is  
it to be hoped that measures will  
have been taken in concert with  
you, and thro&#x27; its Minister here,&#x27;  
for hastening as much as possible,  
the renewal of the intercourse  
which the orders and the embar  
go have suspended ; and thereby  
smoothing the way for other salu­  
tary adjustments.  
&#x27; Since the British order of ,  
evidently inviting our. citizens to  
violate the laws of, their country,  
by patronising on the high seas,

ters and other &#x27;requisite papers,  
and therefore, necessarily smug­  
glers, if not pirates, the circular  
letter of Mr. Huskisson has made  
its appearance, in which the U.  
States are named as alone within  
the purview of the order. A more  
extraordinary experiment is, per­  
haps not to be found in the annals  
of modern transactions. It is le­  
velled moreover agaiiut. a nation  
towards which friendship is pro­  
fessed, as well as against a law, the  
justice and validity of which is not  
contested ; and it sets the odious
