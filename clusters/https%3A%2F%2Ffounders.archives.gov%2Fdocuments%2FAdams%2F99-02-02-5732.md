My dear wife who has been the faithful Companion of my labors pains and pleasures has sometimes told me the friend no Character in Biography more like  mine than Luther’s.—Ardent in all his my pursuits, fearless of the consequences of attacking old prejudices, and often hasty in my manner of speaking of my enemies. To the defects in the temper and conduct of the illustrious reformer I heartily subscribe, but I think there is a character in the old testament which more nearly accords with mine. It is that of the prophet Jeremiah. I shall give it to you in his own words. “Woe is me! my mother, that thou has borne me a man of strife, and a man of Contention to the whole earth. I have neither lent on Usury, nor have men lent to me on Usury, yet every one of them doth curse me.” Jer: 15.10.  
I proceed now to the second part of your letter. I do not consider my Son as having been called upon to share in the honors of the general government, nor do I believe the office to which he has been appointed will satisfy the claims, or appease the jealousy of Pennsylvania as you have supposed. You will say perhaps, what can she mean by asking for a larger representation in the honors of

The truth of the general pro-  
position suggests the remark, that  
ministers who faithfully preach  
the gospel, cannot reasonably ex-  
pect to escape opposition. The  
Prophets were hated and opposed  
on account of the messages of  
God which they delivered. “* Woe  
is me, my mother,” exclaimed  
Jeremiah, “* that thou hast borne  
me a man of strife and of con-  
tention to the whole earth. |  
have neither lent on usury, nor  
have men lent me on usury, yet  
every one of them doth curse  
me.” ‘The Lord Jesus Christ  
was, also, violently opposed, on  
account of the doctrines and du-  
ties which he preached. And he  
forewarned his first ministers, that  
they would be hated and perse-  
cuted on the same account. Ac-  
cordingly we find that they were  
strongly and constantly opposed,  
wherever they preached the gos-  
pel. With two or three excep-  
tions, they were all put to an ig-  
nominious death. Can, then, the  
faithful minister of the gospel, a
