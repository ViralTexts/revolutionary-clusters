How to secure Houses, &amp;c. from Lightning.  
It has pleased God in his Goodness to Mankind, at length to discover to them the Means of securing their Habitations and other Buildings from Mischief by Thunder and Lightning. The Method is this: Provide a small Iron Rod (it may be made of the Rod-iron used by the Nailers) but of such a Length, that one End being three or four Feet in the moist Ground, the other may be six or eight Feet above the highest Part of the Building. To the upper End of the Rod fasten about a Foot of Brass Wire, the Size of a common Knitting-needle, sharpened to a fine Point; the Rod may be secured to the House by a few small Staples. If the House or Barn be long, there may be a Rod and Point at each End, and a middling Wire along the Ridge from one to the other. A House thus furnished will not be damaged by Lightning, it being attracted by the Points, and passing thro the Metal into the Ground without hurting any Thing. Vessels also, having a sharp pointed Rod fix’d on the Top of their Masts, with a Wire from the Foot of the Rod reaching down, round one of the Shrouds, to the Water, will not be hurt by Lightning

may be of interest to quote  
from the American philoso-  
pher : ‘‘ How to secure houses,  
etc., from lightning. It has  
pleased God in His goodness  
to mankind at length to dis-  
cover to them the means of  
securing their habitations and  
other buildings from mischief  
by thunder and lightning.  
  
The method is this: Provide  
  
a small iron rod. It may be  
  
made of the rod-iron used by  
  
the nailers, but of such a  
  
length that one end being  
  
three or four feet in the moist  
ground, the other may be six  
or eight feet above the high-  
est part of the building. To  
the upper end of the rod  
fasten about a foot of brass  
wire, the size of a common  
knitting-needle, sharpened to  
  
a fine point; the rod may be  
  
secured to the house by a few  
staples. If the house or barn be long, there may bea  
rod and point at each end, and a middling wire along  
the ridge from one to the other. A house thus fur-  
nished will not be endangered by the lightning, it being  
attracted by the points, and passing through the metal  
into the ground without hurting anything. Vessels also,  
  
ving a sharp-pointed rod fixed on the top of their  
.. asts, with a wire from the foot of the rod reaching  
down round one of the shrouds to the water, will not be  
hurt by the lightning.
