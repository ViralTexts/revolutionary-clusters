. Jan. 6.  
at the age of 77. I begin to make some memoranda and state some recollections of dates &amp; facts concerning myself, for my own more ready reference &amp; for the informn of my family.  
The tradition in my father’s family was that their ancestor came to this country from Wales, and from near the mountain of Snowden, the highest in Gr. Br. I noted once a case from Wales in the law reports where a person of our name was either pl. or def. and one of the same name was Secretary to the Virginia company. these are the only instances in which I have met with the name in that country. I have found it in our early records, but the first particular information I have of any ancestor was my grandfather who lived at the place in Chesterfield called Ozborne’s and ownd the lands afterwards the glebe of the parish,. here he had 3. sons, Thomas who died young, Field who settled on the waters of Roanoke and left numerous descendants &amp; Peter my father, who settled on the lands I still own Called Shadwell adjoining my present residence. he was born Feb. 29. 1707/8 and intermarried  in 1739. with Jane Randolph of the age of 19 daur of Isham Randolph one of the seven sons of that name &amp; family settled at Dungeoness in Goochld. they trace their pedigree far back in England &amp; Scotland, to which let every one ascribe the faith &amp; merit he chuses  
My father’s education had been quite neglected, but being of a strong mind, sound judgment and eager after information, he read much and improved himself insomuch that he was chosen with Joshua Fry professor of Mathem. in W. &amp; M. college to continue the boundary line between Virginia &amp; N. Carolina which had been begun by Colo Byrd, and was afterwards employed with the same mr Fry to make the 1st Map of Virginia which had ever been made, that of Capt Smith being merely a conjectural sketch. they possessed excellent materials for so much of the country as is below the blue ridge; little being then known beyond that ridge. he was the 3d or 4th settler of the part of the country in which I live, which was about 1737. or he died Aug. 17. 1757. leaving my mother a widow who lived till 1776. and with 6 daurs &amp; 2. sons, myself the elder. to my younger brother he left his estate on James river called Snowden after the supposed birth-place of the family. to myself he gave the lands on which I was born &amp; live. he placed me at the English school at 5. years of age and at the  Latin at 9.  where I continued until his death. my teacher mr Douglas a clergyman from Scotland was but a superficial Latinist, less instructed in Greek, but with the rudiments of these languages he taught me French, and on the death of my father I went to the revd mr  Maury a correct classical scholar, with whom I continued two years, and then went to Wm &amp; Mary college to wit in the spring of 1760 where I continued 2. years. it was my great good fortune, and what probably fixed the destinies of my life that Dr Wm Small of Scotland was then professor of Mathematics, a man profound in most of the useful branches of science, with a happy talent of communicn correct &amp; gentlemanly manners, &amp; an enlarged &amp; liberal mind. he fortunat he, most happily for me, became soon attached to me &amp; made me his daily companion when not engaged in the school; and from his conversation I got my first views of the expansion of science &amp; of the system of things in which we are placed. fortunately the Philosophical chair became vacant soon after my arrival at College, and he was appointed to fill it per interim: and he was the first who ever gave in that college regular lectures in Ethics, Rhetoric &amp; Belles lettres. he returned to Europe in 1762. having previously filled up the measure of his goodness to me, by procuring for me, from his most intimate friend G. Wythe, a reception as a student of law, under his direction, and introduced me to the acquaintance and familiar table of Governor Fauquier, the ablest man who had ever filled that office. with him, and at his table, Dr Small &amp; mr Wythe, his amici omnium horarum, &amp; myself, formed a parti quarré, &amp; to the habitual conversations on these occasions I owed much instruction. mr Wythe continued to be my faithful and beloved Mentor in youth, and my most affectionate friend through life. in 1767. he led me into the practice of the law at the bar of the General court, at which I continued until the revolution shut up the courts of justice. [for a sketch of the life &amp; character of mr Wythe see my letter of Aug. 31. 20. to mr John Saunderson]  
In 1769. I became a member of the legislature by the choice of the county in which I live, &amp; continued in that until it was closed by the revolution. I made one effort in that body for the permission of the emancipation of slaves, which was rejected: and indeed, during the regal government, nothing liberal could expect success. our minds were circumscribed within narrow limits by an habitual belief that it was our duty to be subordinate to the mother country in all matters of government, to direct all our labors in subservience to her interests, and even to observe a bigotted intolerance for all religions but hers. the difficulties with our representatives were of habit and despair, not of reflection &amp; conviction. experience soon proved that they could bring their minds to rights on the first summons of their attention. but the king’s council, which acted as another house of legislature, held their places at will &amp; were in most humble obedience to that will: the Governor too, who had a negative on our laws held by the same tenure, &amp; with still greater devotedness to it: and last of all the Royal negative closed the last door to every hope of amelioration.

 &amp; daughter of John Wayles, then 23. years old. mr Wayles was a lawyer of much practice, to which he was introduced more by his great industry, &amp; punctuality &amp; practical readiness, than to eminence in the science of his profession. he was a most agreeable companion, full of pleasantry &amp; good humor, and welcomed in every society. he acquired a handsome fortune, died in May. 1773. leaving three daughters, and the portion which came on that event to mrs Jefferson, after the debts should be paid, which were very considerable, was about equal to my own patrimony, and consequently doubled the ease of our circumstances.  
When the famous Resolutions of 1765. against the Stamp-act were proposed, I was yet a student of law in Wmsbg. I attended the debate however at the door of the lobby of the H. of Burgesses, &amp; heard the splendid display of mr Henry’s talents as a popular orator. they were great indeed; such as I have never heard from any other man. he appeared to me to speak as Homer wrote. mr Johnson, a member &amp; lawyer from the Northern neck, seconded the resolns. &amp; by him the learning &amp; logic of the case were chiefly maintained. my recollections of these transactions may be seen pa. 60. of Wirt’s life of P.H. to whom I furnished them.  
In May 1769. a meeting of the General assembly was called by the Govr Ld Botetourt. I had then become a member; and to that meeting became known the joint resolutions &amp; address of the Lords &amp; Commons of 1768.9. on the proceedings in Massachusets. Counter-resolutions, &amp; an Address to the king, by the H. of Burgesses were agreed to with little opposition, &amp; a spirit manifestly displayed of considering the cause of Massachusets as a common one. the Governor dissolved us: but we met the next day in the Apollo of the Raleigh tavern, formed ourselves into a voluntary Convention, drew up articles of association against the use of any merchandise imported from Gr. Britain, signed &amp; recommended them to the people, repaired to our several counties, &amp; were reelected without any other exception than of the very few who had declined assent to our proceedings.  
Nothing of particular excitement occurring for a considerable time. our countrymen seemed to fall into a state of insensibility to our situation. the duty on tea not yet repealed &amp; the Declaratory act of a right in the British parl. to bind us by their laws in all cases whatsoever, still suspended over us. but a court of enquiry held in R. Island in 1772. with a power to send persons to England to be tried for offences committed here was considered at our session of the spring of 1773. as demanding attention. not thinking our old &amp; leading members up to the point of forwardness &amp; zeal which the times required, mr Henry, R. H. Lee, Francis L. Lee, mr Carr &amp; myself agreed to meet in the evening in a private room of the Raleigh to consult on the state of things. there may have been a me

nforming me of the crossing of our messengers.  
The next event which excited our sympathies for Massachusets was the Boston port bill, by which that port was to be shut up on the 1st of June 1774. this arrived while we were in session in the spring of that year. the lead in the house on these subjects being no longer left to the old members, mr Henry,  R. H. Lee, Fr. L. Lee, 3. or 4. other members, whom I do not recollect, and myself, agreeing that we must boldly take an unequivocal stand in the line with Massachusets, agreed determined to meet and consult on the proper measures in the Council chamber, for the benefit of the library in that room. we were under conviction of the necessity of arrousing our people from the lethargy into which they had fallen as to passing events; and thought that the appointment of a day of general fasting &amp; prayer would be most likely to call up &amp; alarm their attention. no example of such a solemnity had existed since the days of our distresses in the war of 55. since which a new generation had grown up. with the help therefore of Rushworth, whom we rummaged over for the revolutionary precedents &amp; forms of the Puritans of that day, preserved by him, and we cooked up a resolution, somewhat modernising their phrases, for appointing the 1st day of June, on which the Port bill was to commence, for a day of fasting, humiliation &amp; prayer, to implore heaven to avert from us the evils of civil war, to inspire us with firmness in support of our rights, and to turn the hearts of the king &amp; parliament to moderation &amp; justice. to give greater emphasis to our proposition, we agreed to wait the next morning on mr Nicholas, whose grave &amp; religious character was more in unison with the tone of our resolution and to sollicit him to move it. we accordingly went to him in the morning and he moved it the same day the 1st of June was appointed proposed and it passed without opposition. the Governor dissolved us as usual. we retired to the Apollo as before, agreed to an association, and instructed the Commee of correspdce to propose to the corresponding commees of the other colonies to appoint deputies to meet in Congress at such place, annually, as should be convenient to direct, from time to time, the measures required by the general interest: and we declared that an attack on any one colony should be considered as an attack on the whole. this was in May, and we further recommended to the several counties to elect deputies to meet at Wmsbg the 1st of Aug. ensuing, to consider the state of the colony, &amp; particularly to appoint delegates to a general Congress, should that measure be acceded to  by the commees of correspdce generally. it was acceded to, Philada was appointed for the place, and the 5th of Sep. for the time of meeting. we returned home, and in our several counties invited the clergy to meet assemblies of the people on the 1st of June, to perform the ceremonies of the day, &amp;  to address to them discourses suited to the occasion. the people met generally, with anxiety &amp; alarm in their countenances, and the effect of the day thro’ the whole colony was like a shock of electricity, arrousing every man &amp; placing him erect &amp; solidly on his center. they chose universally delegates for the Convention. being elected one for my own county I prepared a draught of instructions to be given to the delegates whom we should send to the Congress, and which I meant to propose at our meeting. in this I took the ground which, from the beginning I had thought the only one orthodox or tenable, which was that the relation between Gr. Br. and these colonies was exactly the same as that of England &amp; Scotland after the accession of James &amp; until the Union, and the same as her present relations with Hanover, having the same Executive chief but no other necessary political connection; and that our emigration from England to this country gave her no more rights over us, than the emigrations of the Danes and Saxons gave to the present authorities of the mother country over England. in this doctrine however I had never been able to get any one to agree with me but mr Wythe. he concurred in it from the first dawn of the question What was the political relation between us &amp; England? our other patriots Randolph, the Lees, Nicholas, Pendleton stopped at the half-way house of John Dickinson who admitted that England had a right to regulate our commerce, and to lay duties on it for the purposes of regulation, but not of raising revenue. but fo

yton Randolph informed the Convention he had recieved such a paper from a member prevented by sickness from offering it in his place, and he laid it on the table for perusal. it was read generally by the members, approved by many, but thought too bold for the present state of things; but they printed it in pamphlet form under the title of ‘A Summary view of the rights of British America.’ it found it’s way to England, was taken up by the opposition, interpolated a little by mr Burke so as to make it answer opposition purposes, and in that form run rapidly thro’ several editions. this information I had from Parson Hurt, who happened at the time to be in Londonat the time, whither he had gone to recieve clerical orders. and I was informed afterwards by Peyton Randolph that it had procured me the honor of having my name inscribed in a long roll list of proscriptions enrolled in a bill of attainder commenced in one of the houses of parliament, but suppressed in embryo by the hasty step of events which warned them to be  a little cautious.

mediately to Philadelphia, and conveyed to Congress the first notice they had of it. it was entirely approved there. I took my seat with them on the 21st of June. on the 26 24th a commee which had been appointed to prepare a declaration of the causes of taking up arms, brought in their report (drawn I believe by J. Rutledge) which not being liked they recommitted it on the 26th and added mr Dickinson and myself to the committee. on the rising of the house, the commee having not yet met, I happened to find myself near Govr W. Livingston, and proposed to him to draw the paper. he excused himself and proposed that I should draw it. on my pressing him with urgency, ‘we are as yet but new acquaintances, Sir, said he, why are you so earnest for my doing it?’ ‘because, said I, I have been informed that you drew the Address to the people of Gr. Britain, a production certainly of the finest pen in America.’ ‘on that, says he, perhaps Sir you may not have been correctly informed.’ I had recieved that information in Virginia from Colo Harrison on his return from that Congress. Lee, Livingston &amp; Jay had been the commee for that draught. the first, prepared by Lee, had been disapproved &amp; recommitted. the second was drawn by Jay, but being presented by Govr Livingston, had led Colo Harrison into the error. the next morning, walking in the hall of Congress, many members being assembled but the house not yet formed, I observed mr Jay, speaking to R.

cieved that information from mr Lee &amp; that not a word had ever passed on the subject between mr Lee &amp; myself; and after some explanations the matter subject was dropt. these gentlemen had had some sparrings in debate before, and continued ever very hostile to each other.  
I prepared a draught of a the Declarn of the committed to us. it was too strong for mr Dickinson. he still retained the hope of reconciliation with the mother country, and was unwilling it should be lessened by offensive statements. he was so honest a man, &amp; so able a one that he was greatly indulged even by those who could not feel his scruples. we therefore requested him to take the paper and put it into a form he could approve. he did so, preparing an entire new statement, and preserving of the former one only the last 4. paragraphs &amp; half of the preceding one. we approved &amp; reported it to Congress who accepted it. Congress gave a signal proof of their indulgence to mr Dickinson, and of their great desire not to go too fast for any respectable part of our body, in permitting him to draw their second petition to the king according to his own ideas, scarcely I believe altering one and passing it with scarcely any amendment. the disgust against it’s humility was general; and mr Dickinson’s delight at it’s passage was the only circumstance which reconciled them to it. the vote being past, altho’ further observn on it was out of order, he could not refrain from rising and expressing his satisfaction and concluding by saying ‘there is but one word, mr President, in the paper which I disapprove, &amp; that is the word Congress.’ on which Ben Harrison rose and said ‘there is but one word in the paper, mr President, of which I approve, and that is the word Congress’  
On the 22d of July Dr Franklin, mr Adams, R. H. Lee &amp; myself were appointed a commee to consider and report on Ld North’s conciliatory resolution. Jan. 10. the answer of the Virginia assembly on that subject having been approved I was requested by the Commee to prepare this report, which will account for the similarity of feature in the two instruments.  
On the 15th of May 1776. the Convention of Virginia instructed their delegates in Congress to propose to that body to declare the colonies independent of Gr. Britain, and appointed a commee to prepare a declaration of rights and plan of government.

viduals procured large grants, and, desirous of founding great families for themselves, settled them on their descendants in fee-tail. the transmission of this property from generation to generation in the same name raised up a distinct set of families who, being privileged by law in the perpetuation of their wealth were thus formed into a Patrician order, distinguished by the splendor and luxury of their establishments. from this order too the king habitually selected his Counsellors of state, the hope of which distinction devoted the whole corps to the interests &amp; will of the crown. to annul this privilege, and instead of an Aristocracy of wealth, of more harm and danger, than benefit, to society, to make an opening for the aristocrasy of virtue and talent, which nature has wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society, &amp; scattered with equal hand thro’ all it’s conditions, was deemed essential to a well ordered republic. to effect it no violence was necessary, no deprivation of natural right, but rather an enlargement of it by a repeal of the law. for this would authorise the present holder to divide the property among his children equally, as his affections were divided; and would place them, by natural generation on the level of their fellow citizens. but this repeal was strongly opposed by mr Pendleton, who was zealously attached to antient establishments; and who, taken all in all, was the ablest man in debate I have ever met with. he had not indeed the poetical fancy of mr Henry, his sublime imagination, his lofty and overwhelming diction; but he was cool, smooth and persuasive; his language flowing, chaste,, &amp; embellished, his conceptions quick, acute and full of resource; never vanquished; for if he lost the main battle, he returned upon you, and regained so much of it as to make it a drawn one, by dexterous maneuvres, skirmishes in detail, and the recovery of small advantages which, little singly, were important all together. you never knew when you were clear of him, but were harrassed by his perseverance until the patience was worn down of all who had less of it than himself. add to this that he was one of the most virtuous &amp; benevolent of men, the kindest friend, the most amiable &amp; pleasant of companions, which ensured a favorable reception to whatever came from him. finding that the general principle of entails could not be maintained, he took his stand on an amendment which he proposed, instead of an absolute abolition, to permit the tenant in tail to convey in feesimple, if he chose it: and he was within a few votes of saving so much of the old law. but the bill past finally for entire abolition.  
In that one of the bills for organising our judiciary system which proposed a court of chancery, I had provided for a trial by jury of all matters of fact in that as well as in the courts of law. he defeated it by the introduction of 4. words only, ‘if either party chuse.’ the consequence has been that as no suitor will say to his judge ‘Sir, I distrust you, give me a jury’ juries are rarely, I might say perhaps never seen in that court, but when called for by the Chancellor of his own accord.  
Jan. 16.The first establishment in Virginia which became permanent was made in 1607. I have found no mention of Negroes in the colony until about 1650. the first brought here as slaves were by a Dutch ship; after which the English commenced the trade and continued it until the revolutionary war. that suspended, ipso facto, their further importation for the present, and the business of the war pressing constantly on the legislature, this subject was not acted on finally until the year 78. when I brought in a bill to prevent their further importation. this passed without opposition, and stopped the increase of the evil by importation, leaving to future efforts it’s final eradication  
The first settlers of this colony were Englishmen, loyal subjects to their king and church, and the grant to Sr Walter Raleigh contained an express Proviso that their laws ‘should not be against the true Christian faith, now professed in the church of England.’ as soon as the state of the colony admitted, it was divided into parishes, in each of which was established a minister of the Anglican church, endowed with a fixed salary, in tobacco, a glebe house and land with the other necessary appendages. to meet these expences all the inhabitants of the parishes were assessed, whether they were or not, members of the established church. towards Quakers who came here they were most cruelly intolerant, driving them from the colony by the severest penalties. in process of time however, other sectarisms were introduced, chiefly of the Presbyterian family; and the established clergy, secure for life in their glebes and salaries, adding to these generally the emoluments of a classical school, found employment enough, in their farms and school rooms for the rest of the week, and devoted Sunday only to the edification of their flock, by service, and a sermon at their parish church. their other pastoral functions were little attended to. against this inactivity the zeal and industry of sectarian preachers had an open and undisputed field; and by the time of the revolution, a majority of the inhabitants had become dissenters from the established church, but still obliged to pay contributions to support the Pastors of the minority. this unrighteous compulsion to maintain teachers of what they deemed religious errors was grievously felt during the regal government, and without a hope of relief. but the first republican legislature which met in 76. was crouded with petitions to abolish this spiritual tyranny. these brought on the severest contests in which I have ever been engaged. our great opponents were mr Pendleton &amp; Robert Carter Nicholas, honest men, but zealous churchmen. the petitions were referred to the Commee of the whole house on the state of the country; and after desperate contests in that Committee, almost daily from the 11th of Octob. to the 5th of December, we prevailed so far only as to repeal the laws which rendered criminal the maintenance of any religious opinions, the forbearance of repairing to church, or the exercise of any mode of worship: and further, to exempt dissenters from contributions to the support of the established church; and to suspend, only until the next session levies on the members of that church for the salaries of their own incumbents. for altho’ the majority of our citizens were dissenters, as has been observed, a majority of the legislature were churchmen. among these however were some reasonable and liberal men, who enabled us, on some points, to obtain feeble majorities. but our opponents carried in the general resolutions of the Commee of Nov. 19. a declaration that religious assemblies ought to be regulated, and that provision ought to be made for continuing the succession of the clergy, and superintending their conduct. and in the bill now passed was inserted an express reservation of the question Whether a general assesment should not be established by law, on every one, to the support of the pastor of his choice; or whether all should be left to voluntary contributions: and on this question, debated at every session from 76. to 79.

. I had proposed it’s removal so early as Octob. 76. but it did not prevail until the session of May. 79.  
Early in the session of May 79. I prepared, and obtained leave to bring in a bill declaring who should be deemed citizens, asserting the natural right of expatriation, and prescribing the mode of exercising it. this, when I withdrew from the house on the 1st of June following, I left in the hands of George Mason and it was passed on the 26th of that month.  
Jan. 17In giving this account of the laws of which I was myself the mover &amp; draughtsman, I by no means mean to claim to myself the merit of obtaining their passage. I had many occasional and strenuous coadjutors in debate, and one most stedfast, able, and zealous; who was himself a host. this was George Mason, a man of the first order of wisdom among those who acted on the theatre of the revolution. of expansive mind, profound judgment, cogent in argument, learned in the lore of our former constitution, and earnest for the republican change on democratic principles. his elocution was neither flowing nor smooth, but his language was strong, his manner most impressive, and strengthened by a dash of biting cynicism when provocation made it seasonable.  
Mr Wythe, while Speaker in the two sessions of 1777. between his return from Congress and his appointment to the Chancery, was an able and constant associate in whatever was before a committee of the whole. his pure integrity, judgment, and reasoning powers gave him great weight. of him see more in some notes inclosed in my letter of Aug. 31. 1820 to mr John Saunderson.  
Mr Madison came into the House in 1776. a new member and young; which circumstances, concurring with his extreme modesty, prevented his venturing himself in debate before his removal to the Council of state in Nov. 77. from thence he went to Congress, then consisting of few members. trained in these successive schools, he acquired a habit of self-possession which placed at ready command the rich resources of his luminous and discriminating mind, &amp; of his extensive information, and rendered him the first of every assembly afterwards of which he became a member. never wandering from his subject into vain declamation, but pursuing it closely in language pure, classical, and copious, soothing always the feelings of his adversaries by civilities and softness of expression, he rose to the eminent station which he held in the great National convention of 1787. and in that of Virginia which followed, he sustained the new constitution in all it’s parts, bearing off the palm against the logic of George Mason and the fervid declamation of mr Henry. with these consummate powers were united a pure and spotless virtue which no calumny has ever attempted to sully. of the powers and polish of his pen, and of the wisdom of his administration in the highest office of the nation, I need say nothing. they have spoken, and will for ever speak for themselves:  
So far we were proceeding in the details of reformation only; selecting points of legislation prominent in character &amp; principle, urgent, and indicative of the strength of the general pulse of reformation. when I left Congress in 76. it was in the persuasion that our whole code must be reviewed, adapted to our republican form of government, and, now that we had no negatives of Councils, Governors &amp; Kings to restrain us from doing right, that it should be corrected, in all it’s parts, with a single eye to reason, &amp; the good of those for whose government it was framed. early therefore in the session of 76. to which I returned, I moved and presented a bill for the revision of the laws; which was past on the 24th of October, and on the 5th of November mr Pendleton, mr Wythe, George Mason, &amp; Thomas L. Lee and myself were appointed a Committee to execute the work. we agreed to meet at Fredericksburg to settle the plan of operation and to distribute the work. we met there accordingly on the 13th of January 1777. the first question was Whether we should propose to abolish the whole existing system of laws, and prepare a new and complete Institute, or preserve the general systemof laws, and only modify it to the present state of things. mr Pendleton, contrary to his usual disposition in favor of antient things, was for the former proposition, in which he was joined by mr Lee. to this it was objected that to abrogate our whole system would be a bold measure, and probably far beyond the views of the legislature; that they had been in the practice of revising from time to time the laws of the colony, omitting the expired, the repealed and the obsolete, an amending only those retained, and probably meant we should now do the same, only including the British statutes as well as our own: that to compose a new Institute like those of Justinian or Bracton, or that of Blackstone, which was the model proposed by mr Pendleton, would be an arduous undertaking, of vast research, of great consideration &amp; judgment; and when reduced to a text, every word of that text, from the imperfection of human language, and it’s incompetence to express distinctly every shade of idea, would become a subject of question &amp; chicanery until settled by repeated adjudications; that this would involve us for ages in litigation, and render property uncertain  until, like the statutes of old, every word had been tried, and settled by numerous decisions, and by new volumes of reports &amp; commentaries; and that no one of us probably would undertake such a work, which, to be systematical, must be the work of one hand. this last was the opinion of mr Wythe, mr Mason &amp; myself. when we proceeded to the distribution of the work, mr Mason excused himself as, being no lawyer, he felt himself unqualified for the work, and he resigned soon after. mr Lee excused himself on the same ground, and died indeed in a short time. the other two gentlemen therefore and myself divided the work among us, the Common law and statutes to the 4. James I. (when our separate legislature was established) was assigned to me; the British statutes from that period to the present day to mr Wythe, and the Virginia laws to mr Pendleton. as the law of Descents, &amp; the Criminal law fell of course within my portion, I wished the Commee to settle the leading principles of these, as a guide for me in framing them. and with respect to the first, I proposed to abolish the right law of primogeniture, and to make real estate descendible in parcenary to the next of kin, as personal property is by the statute of distribution. mr Pendleton wished to preserve the right of primogeniture, but seeing at once that that could not prevail, he proposed we should adopt the Hebrew principle, and give a double portion to the elder son. I observed that if the elder son could eat twice as much, or do double work, it would might be a natural evidence of his right to a double portion; but being on a par in his powers &amp; wants, with his brothers and sisters, he should be on a par also in the partition of the patrimony. and such was the decision of the other members.  
On the subject of the Criminal law, all were agreed that the punishment of death should be abolished, except for treason and murder, and t

ce a question in our courts. I thought it would be useful also, in all new draughts, to reform the style of the later British statutes, and of our own acts of assembly, which from their verbosity, their endless tautologies, their involutions of case within case, and parenthesis within parenthesis, and their multiplied efforts at certainty by saids and aforesaids, by ors and by ands, to make them more plain, do really render them more perplexed and embarrassing incomprehensible, not only to common readers, but to the lawyers themselves. we were employed in this work from that time to Feb. 1779. when we met in Williamsburg, that is to say, mr Pendleton, mr Wythe &amp; myself, and meeting day by day, we examined critically our several parts, sentence by sentence, scrutinizing and amending until we had agreed on the whole:. we then returned home, had fair copies made of our several parts, which we were reported to the General assembly June 18. 1779. by mr Wythe and myself, mr Pendleton’s residence being distant, and he having authorised us by letter to declare his approbation. we had in this work brought so much of the Common law as it was thought necessary to alter, all the British statutes from Magna charta to the present day, and all the laws of Virginia, from the establishment of our legislature, in the 4th Jac. 1. to the present time, which we thought should be retained, within the compass of 126. bills, making a printed folio of 90. pages only. some bills were taken out occasionally, from time to time, and past; but the main body of the work was not entered on by the legislature, until, after the general peace, in 1785. when by the unwearied exertions of mr Madison, in opposition to the endless quibbles, chicaneries, perversions, vexations and delays of lawyers and demi-lawyers, most of the bills were past by the legislature, with little alteration.  
The bill for establishing religious freedom, the principles of which had, to a certain degree, been enacted before, I had drawn in all the latitude of reason &amp; right. it still met with opposition; but, with some mutilations in the preamble, it was finally past; and a singular proposition proved that it’s protection of opinion was meant to be universal. where the preamble declares that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed, by inserting the words ‘Jesus Christ’ so that it should read ‘a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion’ the insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of it’s protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo and infidel of every denomination.

Feb. 7.The acts of assembly concerning the College of Wm &amp; Mary, were properly within mr Pendleton’s portion of our work. but these related chiefly to it’s revenue, while it’s constitution, organization and scope of science were derived from it’s charter. we thought that on this subject a systematical plan of general education should be proposed, and I was requested to undertake it. I accordingly prepared three bills for the Revisal, proposing three distinct grades of education, reaching all classes. 1. Elementary schools for all children generally, rich and poor. 2. Colleges for a middle degree of instruction, calculated for the common purposes of life, and such as would be desirable for all who were in easy circumstances. and 3. an ultimate grade for teaching the sciences generally, &amp; in their highest degree. the first bill proposed to lay off every county into Hundreds or Wards, of a proper size and population for a school, in which reading, writing and common arithmetic should be taught; and that the whole state should be divided into 24. districts, in each of which should be a school for classical learning, grammar, geography, and the higher branches of numerical arithmetic. the second bill proposed to amend the constitution of Wm &amp; Mary college, to enlarge it’s sphere of science, and to make it in fact an University. the third was fo

. for they left it to the court of each county to determine for itself when this act should be carried into execution, within their county. one provision of the bill was that the expences of these schools should be borne by the inhabitants of the county, every one in proportion to his general tax-rate. this would throw on wealth the education of the poor; and the justices, being generally of the more wealthy class, were unwilling to incur that burthen, and I believe it was not suffered to commence in a single county.   I shall recur again to this subject towards the close of my story, if I should have life and resolution enough to reach that term; for I am already tired of talking about myself.  
Feb. 8.The bill on the subject of slaves was a mere digest of the existing laws respecting them, without any intimation of a plan for a future &amp; general emancipation. it was thought better that this should be kept back, and attempted only by way of amendment whenever the bill should be brought on. the principles of the amendment however were agreed on, that is to say, the freedom of all born after a certain day, and deportation at a proper age. but it was found that the public mind would not yet bear the proposition, nor will it bear it even at this day. yet the day is not distant when it must bear and adopt it, or worse will follow. nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free. nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them. it is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably and in such slow degree as that the evil will wear off insensibly, and their place be pari passu filled up by free white laborers. if on the contrary it is left to force itself on, human nature must shudder at the prospect held up. we should in vain look for an example in the Spanish deportation or deletion of the Moors. this precedent would fall far short of our case.  
I considered 4. of these bills, past or reported, as forming a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of antient or future aristocracy; and a foundation laid for a government truly republican. the repeal of the laws of entail would prevent the accumulation and perpetuation of wealth in select families, and preserve the soil of the country from being daily more &amp; more absorbed in Mortmain. the abolition of primogeniture, and equal partition of inheritances removed the feudal and unnatural distinctions which made one member of every family rich and all the rest poor, substituting equal partition, the best of all Agrarian laws. the restoration of the rights of conscience relieved the people from taxation for the support of a religion not theirs; for the establishment was truly of the religion of the rich, the dissenting sects being entirely composed of the less wealthy people; and these, by the bill for a general education, would be qualified to understand their rights, to maintain them, and to exercise with intelligence their parts in self-government: and all this would be effected without the violation of a single natural right of any one individual citizen. to these too might be added, as a further security, the introduction of the trial by jury, into the Chancery courts, which have already ingulphed and continue to ingulph so great a proportion of the jurisdiction over our property.  
On the 1st of June 1779. I was appointed Governor of the Commonwealth and retired from the legislature. being elected also one of the Visitors of Wm &amp; Mary college, a self-electing body, I effected, during my residence in Williamsburg that year, a change in the organisation of that institution by abolishing the Grammar school, and the two professorships of Divinity &amp; Oriental languages, and substituting a professorship of Law &amp; Police, one of Anatomy &amp; Medecine and Chemistry, and one of Modern languages; and the Charter confining us to six professorships, we added the Law of nature &amp; nations, &amp; the Fine arts to the duties of the Moral professor, and Natural history to those of the Professor of Mathematics and Natural philosophy.

 the Confederation to constitute a house even for minor business did not assemble until the 13th of December.  
They as early as Jan. 7. 1782. had turned their attention to the monies current in the several states, and had directed the Financier, Robert Morris, to report to them a table of rates at which the foreign coins should be recieved at the treasury. that officer, or rather his assistant, Gouverneur Morris, answered them on the 15th in an able and elaborate statement of the denominations of money current in the several states, and of the comparative value of the foreign coins chiefly in circulation with us. he went into the consideration of the necessity of establishing a standard of value with us, and of the adoption of a money-Unit. he proposed for that Unit such a fraction of pure silver as would be a common measure of the penny of every state, without leaving a fraction. this common divisor he found to be 11440 of a dollar, or 11600 of the crown sterling. the value of a dollar was therefore to be expressed by 1440. units, and of a crown by 1600. each Unit containing a quarter of a grain of fine silver. Congress turning again their attention to this subject the following year, the financier, by a letter of Apr. 30. 1783. further explained and urged the Unit he had proposed: but nothing more was done on it until the ensuing year, when it was again taken up, and referred to a commee of which I was a member. the general views of the financier were sound, and the principle was ingenious on which he proposed to found his Unit. but it was too minute for ordinary use, too laborious for computation either by the head or in figures.

a loaf of bread 120 of a dollar would be 72. Units

and the public debt, suppose of 80. Millions, would require 12. figures, to wit 115,200,000,000. Units. such a system of money-arithmetic would be entirely unmanageable for the common purposes of society. I proposed therefore, instead of this, to adopt the Dollar as our Unit of account and payment, and that it’s divisions and subdivisions should be in the decimal ratio. I wrote &amp; printed some Notes on the subject, which I submitted to the consideration of the financier. I recieved his answer and adherence to his general system, only agreeing to take for his Unit 100. of those he first proposed, so that a Dollar should be 14.40100 and a crown 16. units. I replied to this and printed my notes and reply on a flying sheet which I put into the hands of the members of Congress for consideration, and the Committee agreed to report on my principle. this was not immediately carried into operation, but  was adopted the ensuing year and is the system which now prevails. I insert here the Notes and Reply, as shewing the different views on which the adoption of our money system hung. the division

sness of Congress, and their permanent session began to be a subject of uneasiness and even some of the legislatures had recommended to them intermissions, and periodical sessions. as the Confederation had made no provision for a visible head of the government during vacations of Congress, and such a one was necessary to superintend the executive business, to recieve and communicate with foreign Ministers &amp; nations, and to assemble Congress on sudden and extraordinary emergencies, I proposed early in April the appointment of a commee to be called the Committee of the states, to consist of a member from each state, who should remain in session during the recess of Congress: that the functions of Congress should be divided into Executive and Legislative, the latter to be reserved, and the former, by a general resolution to be delegated to that Committee. this proposition was afterwards agreed to, a Committee appointed, who entered on duty on the subsequent adjournment of Congress, quarelled very soon, split into two parties, abandoned their post, and left the government without any visible head until the next meeting of Congress. we have since seen the same thing take place in France the Directory of France; and I believe it will for ever take place in any Executive consisting of a plurality. our plan best I believe, combines wisdom and practicability, by providing a plurality of Counsellors, but a single Arbiter for ultimate decision. I was in France when we heard of this schism, and separation of our Committee, and speaking with Dr Franklin on this singular disposition of men to quarrel and divide into parties, he gave his sentiments as usual by way of Apologue. he mentioned the Eddystone lighthouse in the British channel as being built on a rock in the mid-channel, totally inaccessible in winter, from the boisterous character of that sea, in that season. that therefore, for the two keepers employed to keep up the lights, all provisions for the winter were necessarily carried to them in autumn, as they could never be visited again until the return of the milder season. that on the first practicable day in the spring a boat put off to them with fresh supplies. the boatmen met at the door one of the Keepers and accosted him with a ‘How goes it friend?—very well.—how is your companion?—I do not know—Don’t know? is not he here?—I can’t tell. have not you seen him to-day?—No—when did you see him?—not since last fall.—you have killed him?—not I.’ indeed—they were about to lay hold of him, as having certainly murdered his companion: but he desired them to go upstairs &amp; examine for themselves. they went up, and there found the other keeper. they had quarelled it seems soon after being left there, had divided into two parties, assigned the cares below to one, and those above to another the other, and had never  spoken to or seen one another since.

that this would be approved by all nations, &amp; by Great Britain herself, if not determined to renew the war, and if so determined, she would never want excuses, were this out of the way. mr Reade gave notice he should call for the yeas &amp; nays; whereon those in opposition prepared a resolution expressing pointedly the reasons of their dissent to his motion. it appearing however that his proposition could not be carried, it was thought better to make no entry at all. Massachusets alone would have been for it; Rhode island, Pensylvania and Virginia against it, Delaware, Maryland &amp; N. Carolina would have been divided.  
Our body was little numerous, but very contentious. day after day was wasted on the most unimportant questions. my colleague Mercer was one of those afflicted with the morbid rage of debate. of an ardent mind, prompt imagination, and copious flow of words, he heard with impatience any logic which was not his own. sitting near me on some occasion of a trifling but wordy debate, he asked how I could sit in silence hearing so much false reasoning which a word should refute? I observed to him that to refute indeed was easy, but to silence impossible. that in measures brought forward by myself, I took the laboring oar, as was incumbent on me; but that in general I was willing to listen. if every sound argument or objection was used by some one or other of the numerous debaters, it was enough: if not, I thought it sufficient to suggest the omission, without going into a repetition of what had been already said by others. that this was a waste and abuse of the time and patience of the house which could not be justified. And I believe that if the members of deliberative bodies were to observe this course generally, they would do in a day what takes them a week. and it is really more questionable, than may at first be thought, whether Bonaparte’s dumb legislature which said nothing and did much, may not be preferable to one which talks much and does nothing. I served with General Washington in the legislature of Virginia before the revolution, and, during it, with Dr Franklin in Congress. I never heard either of them speak ten minutes at a time, nor to any but the main point which was to decide the question. they laid their shoulders to the great points, knowing that the little ones would follow of themselves. if the present Congress errs in too much talking, how can it be otherwise in a body to which the people send 150. lawyers, whose trade it is to question every thing, yield nothing, &amp; talk by the hour? that 150. lawyers should do business together ought not to be expected.—but to return again to our subject.  
Those who thought 7. states competent to the ratification being very restless under the loss of their motion, I proposed, on the 3d of January to meet them on middle ground, and therefore moved a resolution which premised premising that there were but 7. states present &amp; who were unanimous for

Mr Adams soon joined us at Paris, &amp; our first employment was to prepare a general form to be proposed to such nations as were disposed to treat with us. during the negociations for peace with the British Commissioner David Hartley, our Commissioners had proposed, on the suggestion of Doctr Franklin, to insert an article exempting from capture by the public or private armed ships of either belligerent, when at war, all merchant vessels and their cargoes, employed merely in carrying on the commerce between nations. it was refused by England, and unwisely, in my opinion. for in the case of a war with us, their superior commerce places infinitely more at hazard on the ocean than ours; and as hawks abound in proportion to game, so our privateers would swarm in proportion to the wealth exposed to their prise, while theirs would be few for wants of subjects of capture. we inserted this article in our form, with a provision against the molestation of fishermen, husbandmen, citizens unarmed and following their occupations in unfortified places, for the humane treatment of prisoners of war, the abolition of contraband of war, which exposes merchants vessels to such vexatious &amp; ruinous detentions and abuses; and for the principle of free bottoms, free goods.

Denmark and Tuscany entered also into negociations with us. other powers appearing indifferent we did not think it proper to press them. they seemed in fact to know little about us, but as rebels who had been succesful in throwing off the yoke of the mother country. they were ignorant of our commerce, which had been always monopolised by England, and of the exchange of articles it might offer advantageously to both parties. th

Mr Adams being appointed Min. Pleny of the US. to London, left us in June, and in July 1785. Dr Franklin returned to America, and I was appointed his successor at Paris. in Feb. 1786. mr Adams wrote to me pressingly to join him in London immediately, as he thought he discovered there some symptoms of better disposition towards us. Colo Smith, his Secretary of legation, was the bearer of his urgencies for my immediate attendance. I accordingly left Paris on the 1st of March, and on my arrival in London we agreed on a very summary form of treaty, proposing an exchange of citizenship for our citizens, our ships, and productions generally, except as to office. on my presentation as usual to the King and Queen, at their leveés, it was impossible for any thing to be more ungracious than their notice of mr Adams &amp; myself. I saw at once that the ulcerations in the narrow mind of that mulish being left nothing to be expected on the subject of my attendance; and on the first conference with the Marquis of Caermarthen, his Minister for foreign affairs, the distance and disinclination which he betrayed in his conversation, the vagueness &amp; evasions of his answers to us, confirmed me in the belief of their aversion to have any thing to do with us. we delivered him however our Projet, mr Adams not despairing so much as I did of it’s effect. we afterwards, by one or more notes, requested his appointment of an interview and conference, which, without directly declining, he evaded by pretences of other pressing occupations for the moment. after staying there seven weeks, till within a few days of the expiration of our commission, I informed the Minister by note that my duties at Paris required my return to that place, and that I should with pleasure be the bearer of any commands to his Ambassador there. he answered that he had none, and wishing me a pleasant journey, I left London on the 26th &amp; arrived at Paris the 30th of April.  
While in London we entered into negociations with the Chevalier Pinto Ambassador of Portugal at that place. the only article of difficulty between us was a stipulation that our bread stuff should be recieved in Portugal in the form of flour as well as of grain. he approved of it himself, but observed that several Nobles of great influence at their court were the owners of windmills in the neighborhood of Lisbon which depended much for their profits on manufacturing our wheat, and that this stipulation would endanger the whole treaty. he signed it however, &amp; it’s fate was what he had candidly portended.

ss attention was paid to the calls of Congress. the fundamental defect of the Confederation was that Congress was not authorised to act immediately on the people, &amp; by it’s own officers. their power was only requisitory, and these requisitions were addressed to the several legislatures, to be by them carried into execution, without other coercion than the moral principle of duty. this allowed in fact a negative to every legislature, on every measure proposed by Congress, a negative so frequently exercised in practice as to benumb the action of the federal government and to render it inefficient in it’s general objects, &amp; more especially in pecuniary and foreign concerns. the want too of a separation of the legislative, executive &amp; judiciary functions worked disadvantageously in practice. yet this state of things afforded a happy augury of the future march of our confederacy, when it was seen that the good sense and good dispositions of the people, as soon as they percieved the incompetence of their first compact, instead of leaving it’s correction to insurrection and civil war, agreed with one voice to elect deputies to a general convention, who should peaceably meet and agree on such a constitution as ‘would ensure peace, justice, liberty, the common defence &amp; general welfare.’  
This Convention met at Philadelphia on the 25th of May ’87. it sate with closed doors, and kept all it’s proceedings secret, until it’s dissolution on the 17th of September, when the results of their labors were published all together. I recieved a copy early in November, and read and contemplated it’s provisions with great satisfaction. as not a member of the Convention however, nor probably a single citizen of the Union, had approved it in all it’s parts, so I too found articles which I thought objectionable. the absence of express declarations ensuring freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of the person under the uninterrupted protection of the Habeas corpus, &amp; trial by jury in civil, as well as in criminal cases excited my jealousy; and the re-eligibility of the President for life, I quite disapproved. I expressed freely in letters to my friends, and most particularly to mr Madison &amp; Genl Washington, my approbations and objections. how the good should be secured, and the ill brought to rights was the difficulty. to refer it back to a new Convention might endanger the loss of the whole. my first idea was that the 9. states first acting should accept it unconditionally, and thus secure what in it was good, and that the 4. last should accept on the previous condition that certain amendments should be agreed to. but a better course was devised of accepting the whole and trusting that the good sense, &amp; honest intentions of our citizens would make the alterations which should be deemed necessary. accordingly all accepted, 6. without objection, and 7. with recommendations of specified amendments. those respecting the press, religion, &amp; juries, with several others, of great value, were accordingly made; but the Habeas corpus was left to the discretion of Congress, and the amendment against the reeligibility of the President was not proposed by that body. my fears of that feature were founded on the importance of the office, on the fierce contentions it might excite among ourselves, if continuable for life, and the dangers of interference either with money or arms, by foreign nations, to whom the choice of an American President might become interesting. examples of this abounded in history; in the case of the Roman emperors for instance, of the Popes while of any significance, of the German emperors, the kings of Poland, &amp; the Deys of Barbary. I had observed too in the feudal History, and in the recent instance particularly of the Stadtholder of Holland, how easily offices or tenures for life slid into inheritances. my wish therefore was that the President should be elected for 7. years &amp; be ineligible afterwards. this term I thought sufficient to enable him, with the concurrence of the legislature, to carry thro’ &amp; establish any system of improvement he should propose for the general good. but the practice adopted I think is better allowing his continuance for 8. years with a liability to be dropped at halfway of the term, making that a period of probation. that his continuance should be restrained to 7. years was the opinion of the Convention at an early state stage of it’s session, when it voted that term by a majority of 8. against 2. and that by a simple majority that he should be ineligible a second time. this opinion was confirmed by the house so late as July 26. referred to the committee of detail, reported favorably by them, and changed to the present form by final vote on the last day but one only of their session. of this change three states expressed their disapprobation, N. York by recommending an amendment that the President should not be eligible a third time, and Virginia and N. Carolina that he should not be capable of serving more than 8. in any term of 16. years. and altho’ this amendment has not been made in form, yet practice seems to have established it. the example of 4. Presidents voluntarily retiring at the end of their 8th year, &amp; the progress of public opinion that the principle is salutary, have given it in practice the force of precedent &amp; usage; insomuch that should a President consent to be a candidate for a 3d election, I trust he would be rejected on this demonstration of ambitious views.  
But there was another amendment of which none of us thought at the time and in the omission of which lurks the germ which is to destroy this happy combination of National powers in the General government for matters of National concern, and independant powers in the states for what concerns the states severally. in England it was a great point gained at the Revolution, that the commissions of the judges, which had hitherto been during pleasure, should thenceforth be made during good behavior. a judiciary dependant on the will of the king had proved itself the most oppressive of all tools in the hands of that magistrate. nothing then could be more salutary than a change there to the tenure of good behavior; and the question of good behavior left to the vote of a simple majority in the two houses of parliament. before the revolution we were all good English whigs, cordial in their free principles, and in their jealousies of their executive magistrate. these jealousies are very apparent in all our state constitutions; and, in the general government in this instance, we have gone even beyond the English caution, by requiring a vote of two thirds of each house to remove in one of the Houses for removing a judge; a vote so impossible where  
* in the impeachment of judge Pickering of New Hampshire, a habitual &amp; Maniac drunkard, no defence was made. had there been, the party vote of more than one third of the Senate would have acquitted him.  
any defence is made, before men of ordinary prejudices &amp; passions, that our judges are effectually independant of the nation. but this ought not to be. I would not indeed make them inde dependant on the Executive authority, as they formerly were in England; but I deem it indispensable to the continuance of this government that they should be submitted to some practical &amp; impartial controul: and that this, to be impartial, must be compounded of a mixture of state and federal authorities. it is not enough that honest men are appointed judges. all know the influence of interest on the mind of man, and how unconsciously his judgment is warped by that influence. to this bias add that of the esprit de corps, of their peculiar maxim and creed that ‘it is the office of a good judge to enlarge his jurisdiction,’ and the absence of responsibility, and how can we expect impartial decision between the General government, of which they are themselves so eminent a part, and an individual state from which they have nothing to hope or fear. we have seen too that, contrary to all correct example, they are in the habit of going out of the question before them, to throw an anchor ahead and grapple further hold for future advances of power. they are then in fact the corps of sappers &amp; miners, steadily working to undermine the independant rights of the states, &amp; to consolidate all power in the hands of that government in which they have so important a freehold estate. but it is not by the consolidation, or concentration of powers, but by their distribution, that good government is effected. were not this great country already divided into states, that division must be made, that each might do for itself what concerns itself directly, and what it can so much better do than a distant authority. every state again is divided into counties, each to take care of what lies within it’s local bounds; each county again into townships or wards, to manage minuter details; and every ward into farms, to be governed each by it’s individual proprietor. were we directed from Washington when to sow, &amp; when to reap, we should soon want bread. it is by this partition of cares, descending in gradation from general to particular that the mass of human affairs may be best managed for the good and prosperity of all. I repeat that I do not charge the judges with wilful and ill-intentioned error; but honest error must be arrested where it’s toleration leads to public ruin. as, for the safety of society, we commit honest Maniacs to Bedlam, so judges should be withdrawn from their bench, whose erroneous biasses are leading us to dissolution. it may indeed injure them in fame or in fortune; but it saves the republic, which is the first and supreme law.  
Among the debilities of the government of the Confederation, no one was more distinguished or more distressing than the utter impossibility of obtaining, from the states, the monies necessary for payment of debts, or even for the ordinary expences of the government. some contributed a little, some less, &amp; some nothing, and the last furnished at length an excuse for the first to do no

On my return from Holland, I had found Paris in high fermentation still as I had left it. had the Archbishop, on the close of the assembly of Notables, immediately carried into operation the measures contemplated, it was believed they would all have been registered by the parliament. but he was slow, presented his edicts, one after another, &amp; at considerable intervals of  time, which gave time for the feelings excited by the proceedings of the Notables to cool off, new claims to be advanced, and a pressure to arise for a fixed constitution, not subject to changes at the will of the king. nor should we wonder at this pressure when we consider the monstrous abuses of power under which this people were ground to powder, when we pass in review  
the weight of their taxes, and inequality of their distribution;  
the oppressions of the tythes, of the tailles, the corvées, the gabelles, the farms &amp; barriers;  
  
  
the shackles   
on Commerce by Monopolies;  
  
  
  
on Industry by gilds &amp; corporations;  
  
  
  
on the freedom

of person by letters de Cachet.  
  
  
the cruelty of the criminal code generally, the atrocities of the Rack, venality of judges, and their partialities to the rich;  
the Monopoly of Military honors by the Noblesse;  
the enormous expences of the Queen, the princes &amp; the Court;  
the prodigalities of pensions;  
&amp; the riches, luxury, indolence &amp; immorality of the clergy.  
surely under such a mass of misrule and oppression, a people might justly press for thoro’ reformation, and might even dismount their roughshod riders, &amp; leave them to walk on their own legs. the edicts relative to the Corvées &amp; free circulation of grain, were first presented to the parliament and registered. but those for the impôt territorial, &amp; stamp tax, offered some time after, were refused by the parliament, which proposed a call of the States General as alone competent to their authorisation. their refusal produced a Bed of justice, and their exile to Troyes. the Advocates however refused refusing to attend them, a suspension in the administration of justice took place. the Parliament held out for awhile, but the ennui of their exile and absence from Paris begun at length to be felt, and some com dispositions for compromise to appear. on their consent therefore to prolong some of the former taxes, they were recalled from exile, the King met them in session Nov. 19. 87. promised to call the States General in the year 92. and a majority expressed their assent to register an edict for successive and annual loans from 1788. to 92. but a protest being entered by the Duke of Orleans and this encoraging others in a disposition to retract, the King ordered peremptorily the registry of the edict, and left the assembly abruptly. the parliament immediately protested that the votes for the enregistry had not been legally taken, and that they gave no sanction to the loans proposed. this was enough to discredit and defeat them. hereupon issues another edict for the establishment of a cours pleniere, and the suspension of all the parliaments in the kingdom. this being opposed as might be expected by reclamations from all the parliaments &amp; provinces, the King gave way and by an edict of July 5. 88 renounced his Cour pleniere, &amp; promised the States General for the 1st of May of the ensuing year: and the Archbishop finding the times beyond his faculties, accepted the promise of a Cardinal’s hat, was removed [Sep. 88] from the ministry, and mr Neckar was called to the department of finance. the innocent rejoicings of the people of Paris on this change provoked the interference of an officer of the city guards, whose order for their dispersion not being obeyed, he charged them with fixed bayonets, killed two or three, and wounded many. this dispersed them for the moment; but they collected the next day in great numbers, burnt 10. or 12. guard houses, killed two or three of the guards, &amp; lost 6. or 8. more of their own number. the city was hereupon put under martial law, and after awhile the tumult subsided. the effect of this change of ministers, and the promise of the States General at an early day, tranquilised the nation. but two great questions now occurred. 1. What proportion shall the number of deputies of the tiers etat bear to those of the Nobles and  Clergy? and 2. shall they sit in the same, or in distinct apartments? Mr Necker, desirous of avoiding himself these knotty questions, proposed a second call of the same Notables, and that their advice should be asked on the subject. they met Nov. 9. 88. and, by five bureaux against one, they recommended the forms of the States General of 1614. wherein the houses were separate, and voted by orders, not by persons. but the whole nation declaring at once against this, and that the tiers etat should be, in numbers, equal to both the other orders, and the Parliament deciding for the same proportion, it was determined so to be, by a declaration of Dec. 27. 88. a Report of mr Necker to the King, of about the same date, contained other very important concessions. 1. that the King could neither lay a new tax, nor prolong an old one. 2. it expressed a readiness to agree on the periodical meeting of the States. 3. to consult on the necessary restrictions on letters de Cachet. and 4. how far the Press might be made free. 5. it admits that the States are to appropriate the public money; and 6. that Ministers shall be responsible for public expenditures. and these concessions came from the very heart of the king. he had not a wish but for the good of the nation, and for that object no personal sacrifice would ever have cost him a moment’s regret. but his mind was

, his judgment null, and without sufficient firmness even to stand by the faith of his word. his queen too, haughty and bearing no  contradiction, had an absolute ascendancy over him; and around her were rallied the king’s brother d’Artois, the court generally,  and the aristocratic part of his ministers, particularly Breteuil, Broglio, Vauguyon, Foulon, Luzerne, men whose principles of government were those of the age of Louis XIV. against this host the good counsels of Necker, Montmorin, St Priest, altho’ in unison with the wishes of the king himself, were of little avail. the resolutions of the morning formed under their advice, would be reversed in the evening by the influence of the Queen &amp; court. but the hand of heaven weighed heavily indeed on the machinations of this junto; producing collateral incidents, not arising out of the case, yet powerfully co-exciting the nation to force a regeneration of it’s government, and overwhelming with accumulated difficulties this liberticide resistance. for, while laboring under the want of money for even ordinary purposes, in a government which required a million of livres aday, and driven to the last ditch by the universal call for liberty, there came on a winter of such severe cold, as was without example in the memory of man, nor  or in the written records of history. the Mercury was at times 50.° below the freezing point of Farenheit, and 22.° below that of Reaumur. all out-door labor was suspended, and the poor, without the wages of labor, were of course without either bread or fuel. the government found it’s necessities aggravated by that of procuring immense quantities of fire-wood, and of keeping great fires at all the cross-streets, around which the people gathered in crouds to avoid perishing with cold. bread too was to be bought, and distributed daily gratis, until a relaxation of the season should enable the people to work: and the slender stock of bread-stuff had for some time threatened famine, and had raised that article to an enormous price. so great indeed was the scarcity of bread that from the highest to the lowest citizen, the bakers were permitted to deal but a scanty allowance per head, even to those who paid for it; and in cards of invitation to dine in the richest houses, the guest was notified to bring his own bread. to eke out the existence of the people, every person who had the means, was called on for a weekly subscription, which the Curés collected and employed in providing messes for the nourishment of the poor, and vied with each other in devising such economical compositions of food as would subsist the greatest number with the smallest means. this want of bread had been foreseen for some time past and M. de Montmorin had desired me to notify it in America, and that, in addition to the market price, a premium should be given on what should be brought from the US. notice was accordingly given and produced considerable supplies. subsequent information made the importations from America, during the months of March, April &amp; May, into the Atlantic ports of France, amount to about 21,000 barrels of flour, besides what went to other ports, and in other months, while our supplies to their West-Indian islands relieved them also from that drain. this distress for bread continued till July.  
Hitherto no acts of popular violence had been produced by the struggle for political reformation. little riots, on ordinary incidents, had taken place, as at other times, in different parts of the kingdom, in which some lives, perhaps a dozen or twenty had been lost. but in the month of April a more serious one oc  curred in Paris, unconnected indeed with the revolutionary principle, but making part of the history of the day. the Fauxbourg St Antoine is a quarter of the city inhabited entirely by the class of day-laborers and journeymen in every line. a rumor was spread among them that a great paper-manufacturer, of the name of Reveillon, had proposed, on some occasion, that their wages should be lowered to 15. sous aday. inflamed at once into rage, &amp; without enquiry into it’s truth, they flew to his house in vast numbers, destroyed every thing in it, and in his magazines &amp; workshops, without secreting however a pin’s worth to themselves, and were continuing this work o

e killed, before the rest would disperse. there had rarely passed a year without such a riot in some part or other of the kingdom; and this is distinguished only as cotemporary with the revolution, altho’ not produced by it.  
The States General were opened on the 5th of May 89. by speeches from the king, the Garde des sceaux Lamoignon, and mr Neckar. the last was thought to trip too lightly over the constitutional reformations which were expected. his notices of them in this speech were not as full as in his previous Rapport au roi. this was observed to his disadvantage. but much allowance should have been made for the situation in which he was placed between his own counsels, and those of the ministers and party of the court. overruled in his own opinions, compelled to deliver, and to gloss over those of his opponents, and even to keep their secrets, he could not come forward in his own attitude.  
The composition of the assembly, altho’ equivalent on the whole to what had been expected, was something different in it’s elements. it had been supposed that a superior education would carry into the scale of the Commons a respectable portion of the Noblesse. it did so as to those of Paris, of it’s vicinity and of the other considerable cities, whose greater intercourse with enlightened society had liberalised their minds, and prepared them to advance up to the measure of the times. but the Noblesse of the country, which constituted two thirds of that body, were far in their rear. residing constantly on their patrimonial feuds, and familiarised by daily habit with seigneurial powers and practices, they had not yet learned to suspect their inconsistence with reason and right. they were willing to submit to equality of taxation, but not to descend from their rank and prerogatives to be incorporated in session with the tiers etat. among the clergy, on the other hand, it had been apprehended that the higher orders of the hierarchy, by their wealth and connections, would have carried the elections generally. but it proved that in most cases the lower clergy had obtained the popular majorities. these consisted of the Curés, sons of the peasantry who had been employed to do all the drudgery of parochial services for 10. 20. or 30 Louis a year; while their superiors were consuming their princely revenues in palaces of luxury &amp; indolence.  
The objects for which this body was convened being of the first order of importance, I felt it very interesting to understand the views of the parties of which it was composed, and especially the ideas prevalent as to the organisation contemplated for their government. I went therefore daily from Paris to Versailles, and attended their debates, generally till the hour of adjournment. those of the Noblesse were impassioned and tempestuous. they had some able men on both sides, and actuated by equal zeal. the debates of the Commons were temperate, rational and inflexibly firm. as preliminary to all other business, the awful questions came on, Shall the states vote sit in one, or in distinct apartments? and shall they vote by heads or houses? the opposition was soon found to consist of the Episcopal order among the clergy, and two thirds of the Noblesse; while the tiers etat were, to a man, united and determined. after various propositions of compromise had failed, the Commons undertook to cut the Gordian knot. the Abbé Sieyes, the most logical head of the nation, (author of the pamphlet ‘Qu’est ce que le tiers etat?’ which had electrified that country, as Paine’s Common sense did us) after an impressive speech on the 10th of June, moved that a last invitation should be sent to the Nobles and Clergy, to attend in the Hall of the States, collectively or individually for the verification of powers, to which the commons would proceed immediately, either in their presence or absence. this verification being finished, a motion was made, on the 15th that they should constitute themselves a National assembly; which was decided on the 17th by a majority of four fifths. during the debates on this question, about twenty of the Curés had joined them, and a proposition was made in the chamber of the clergy that their whole body should join. this was rejected at first by a small majority only; but, being afterwards somewhat modified, it was decided affirmatively, by a majority of eleven.   While this was under debate and unknown to the court, towit, on the 19th a council was held in the afternoon at Marly, wherein it was proposed that the King should interpose by a declaration of his sentiments, in a seance royale. a form of declaration was proposed by Necker, which, while it censured in general the proceedings both of the Nobles and Commons, announced the king’s views, such as substantially to coincide with the Commons. it was agreed to in council, the seance was fixed for the 22d, the meetings of the States were till then to be suspended, and every thing, in the mean time, kept secret. the members the next morning [20th] repairing to their house as usual, found the doors shut and guarded, a proclamation posted up for a seance royale on the 22d and a suspension of their meetings in the mean time. concluding that their dissolution was now to take place, they repaired to a building called the Jeu de paume (or Tennis court) and there bound themselves by oath to each other, never to separate of their own accord, till they had settled a constitution for the nation, on a solid basis, and if separated by force, that they would reassemble in some other place.   the next day they met in the church of St Louis, and were joined by a majority of the clergy. the heads of the Aristocracy saw that all was lost without some bold exertion. the king was still at Marly. no body was permitted to approach him but their friends. he was assailed by falsehoods in all shapes. he was made to believe that the Commons were about to absolve the army from their oath of fidelity to him, and to raise their pay. the court party were now all rage and desperate. they procured a committee to be held consisting of the king and his ministers, to which Monsieur &amp; the Count d’Artois should be admitted. at this committee the latter attacked mr Necker personally, arraigned his declaration, and proposed one which some of his prompters had put into his hands. mr Necker was brow-beaten and intimidated, and the king shaken. he determined that the two plans should be deliberated on the next day and the seance royale put off a day longer. this encoraged a fiercer attack on mr Neckar the next day. his draught of a declaration was entirely broken up, &amp; that of the Count d’Artois inserted into it. himself and Montmorin offered their resignation, which was refused, the Count d’Artois saying to mr Necker ‘No, sir, you must be kept as the hostage; we hold you responsible for all the ill which shall happen.’ this change of plan was immediately whispered without doors. the Noblesse were in triumph; the people in consternation. I was quite alarmed at this state of things. the army soldiery had not yet indicated which side they should take, and that which they should support would be sure to prevail. I considered a succesful reformation of government in France, as ensuring a general reformation thro Europe, and the resurrection, of their pe to a new life, of their people, now ground to dust by the abuses of the governing powers. I was much acquainted with the leading patriots of the assembly. being from a country which had succesfully passed thro’ a similar reformation, they were disposed to my acquaintance, and had some confidence in me. I urged most strenuously an immediate compromise; to secure what the government was now ready to yield, and trust to future occasions for what might still be wanting. it was well understood that the King would grant at this time 1. freedom of the person by Habeas corpus. 2. freedom of conscience. 3. freedom of the press. 4. trial by jury. 5. a representative legislature. 6. annual meetings. 7. the origination of laws. 8. the exclusive right of taxation and appropriation. and 9. the responsibility of ministers: and with the exercise of these powers they would obtain in future whatever might be further necessary to improve and preserve their constitution. they thought otherwise however, and events have proved their lamentable error. for after 30. years of war, foreign and domestic, the loss of millions of lives, the prostration of private happiness, and foreign subjugation of their own country for a time, they have obtained no more, nor even that securely. they were unconscious of, (for who could foresee?) the ma melancholy sequel of their well-meant perseverance; that their physical force would be usurped by a first tyrant to trample on the independance, and even the existence, of other nations; that this would afford fatal example for the atrocious conspiracy of kings against their people; would generate their unholy and homicide alliance to make common cause among themselves, and to crush, by the power of the whole, the efforts of any part, to moderate their abuses and oppressions.  
When the king passed, the next day thro’ the lane formed from the Chateau to the Hotel des etats, there was a dead silence. he was about an hour in the House delivering his speech &amp; declaration. on his coming out a feeble cry of ‘vive le roy’ was raised by some children, but the people remained silent &amp; sullen. in the close of his speech he had ordered that the members should follow him, &amp; resume their deliberations the next day. the Noblesse followed him, and so did the clergy, except about thirty, who, with the tiers, remained in the rooms room, and entered into deliberation. they protested against what the king had done, adhered to all their former proceedings, and resolved the inviolability of their own persons. an officer came to order them out of the room in the king’s name. ‘tell your master those who sent you, said Mirabeau, that we shall not move hence but at our own will, or the point of the bayonet.’   in the afternoon the people, uneasy, began to assemble in great numbers in the courts and vicinities of the palace. this produced alarm. the Queen sent for Mr Neckar. he was conducted amidst the shouts and acclamations of the multitude who filled all the apartments of the palace. he was a few minutes only with the queen, and what passed between them did not transpire. the king went out to ride. when he passed thro’ the croud to his carriage and into it, without being in the least noticed. as mr Neckar followed him universal acclamations were raised of ‘vive Monsr Neckar, vive le sauveur de la France opprimée.’ he was conducted back to his house with the same demonstrations of affection and anxiety. about 200. of deputies of the Tiers, catching the enthusiasm of the moment, went to his house, and extorted from him a promise that he would not resign. on the 25th 48. of the Nobles joined the tiers, &amp; among them the D. of Orleans. there were then with them 164. members of the clergy, altho’ the minority of that body still sat apart &amp; called themselves the chamber of the clergy. on the 26th the Archbp of Paris joined the tiers, as did some others of the clergy and of the Noblesse.  
These proceedings had thrown the people into violent ferment. it gained the souldiery, first of the French guards, extended to those of every other denomination, except the Swiss, and even to the body guards of the king. they began to quit their barracks, to assemble in squads, to declare they would defend the life of the king, but would not be the murderers of their fellow-citizens. they called themselves the souldiers of the nation, and left now no doubt on which side they would be in case of a rupture. similar accounts came in from the troops in other parts of the kingdom, giving good reason to believe they would side with their fathers and brothers rather than with their officers. the operation of this medecine at Versailles was as sudden as it was powerful. the alarm there was so compleat that in the afternoon of the 27th the king wrote with his own hand letters to the Presidents of the clergy and Nobles, engaging them immediately to join the Tiers. these two bodies were debating &amp; hesitating when Notes from the Ct d’Artois decided their compliance. they went in a body and took their seats with the tiers, and thus rendered the union of the chambers orders in on

r compleat.  
The Assembly now entered on the business of their mission, and first proceeded to arrange the order in which they would take up the heads of their constitution, as follows.  
first, and as Preliminary to the whole a general Declaration of the Rights of man.  
  
  
then specifically the   
Principles of the Monarchy;  
  
  
  
rights of the Nation;  
  
  
  
rights of the King;  
  
  
  
rights of the citizens;  
  
  
  
organisation &amp; rights of the National assembly;  
  
  
  
forms necessary for the enactment of laws;  
  
  
  
organisation &amp; functions of the provincial &amp; municipal assemblies;  
  
  
  
duties and limits of the Judiciary power;  
  
  
  
functions &amp; duties of the military power.  
  
  
a declaration of the rights of man, as the preliminary of their work, was accordingly prepared and proposed by the Marquis de la Fayette.  
But the quiet of their march was soon disturbed by information that troops, and particularly the foreign troops, were advancing on Paris from various quarters. the king had been probably advised to this on the pretext of preserving peace in Paris. but his advisers were believed to have other things in contemplation. the Marshall de Broglio was appointed to their command, a high flying aristocrat, cool and capable of every thing. some of the French guards were soon arrested, under other pretexts, but really on account of their dispositions in favor of the National cause. the people of Paris forced their prison, liberated them, and sent a deputation to the Assembly to solicit a pardon. the Assembly recommended peace and order to the people of Paris, the prisoners to the king, and asked from him the removal of the troops. his answer was negative and dry, saying they might remove themselves, if they pleased, to Noyons, or Soissons. in the mean time these troops, to the number of twenty or thirty thousand, had arrived and were posted in, and between Paris and Versailles. the bridges and passes were guarded. at three aclock in the afternoon of the 11th July the Count de la Luzerne was sent to notify Mr Neckar of his dismission, and to enjoin him to retire instantly without saying a word of it to any body. he went home, dined, and proposed to his wife a visit to a friend, but went in fact to his country house at St Ouen, and at midnight set out for Brussels. this was not known till the next day, 12th when the whole ministry was changed, except Villedeuil of the Domestic department, and Barenton, Garde des sceaux. the changes were as follows.  
the Baron de Breteuil, president of the council of finance;  
de la Galaisiere, Comptroller general in the room of mr Neckar;  
the Marshal de Broglio, minister of war, &amp; Foulon under him in the room of Puy-Segur;  
the Duke de la Vauguyon, minister of foreign affairs instead of the Ct de Montmorin;  
de la Porte, minister of Marine in place of the Ct de la Luzerne;  
St Priest was also removed from the council. Luzerne and Puy-Segur had been strongly of the Aristocratic party in the Council, but they were not considered as equal to the work now to be done. the king was now compleatly in the hands of men, the principal among whom had been noted thro’ their lives for the Turkish despotism of their characters, and who were associated around the king as proper instruments for what was to be executed. when the news of this change began to be known at Paris about 1. or 2. aclock. in the afternoon a body of about 100. German cavalry were advanced and drawn up in the Place Louis XV. and about 200. Swiss posted at a little distance in their rear. this drew people to the spot, who thus accidentally found themselves in front of the troops, merely at first as spectators; but as their numbers increased their indignation rose. they retired a few steps, and posted themselves on and behind large piles of large stone, large and small, collected in that Place for a bridge which was to be built adjacent to it. in this position, happening to be in my carriage on a visit, I passed thro’ the lane they had formed, without interruption. but the moment after I had passed, the people attacked the cavalry with stones. they charged, but the advantageous position of the people, and the showers of stones obliged the horse to retire, and quit the field altogether, leaving one of their number on the ground, &amp; the Swiss in their rear not moving to their aid. this was the signal for universal insurrection, and this body of cavalry, to  avoid being massacred, retired towards Versailles. the people now armed themselves with such weapons as they could find in Armorer’s shops and private houses, and with bludgeons, and were roaming all night thro’ all parts of the city, without any decided object. the next day (13th) the assembly pressed on the king to send away the troops, to permit the Bourgeoisie of Paris to arm for the preservation of order in the city, and offered to send a deputation from their body to tranquilise them: but their propositions are refused. a committee of magistrates and electors of the city are appointed by those bodies to take upon them it’s government. the people, now openly joined by the French guards, force the prison of St Lazare, release all the  prisoners, and take a great store of corn, which they carry to the Corn-market. here they get some arms, and the French guards begin to form &amp; train them. the City-committee determine to raise 48,000. Bourgeois, or rather to restrain their numbers to 48,000. on the 14th they send one of their members (Monsr de Corny) to the Hotel des Invalides, to ask arms for their Garde-Bourgeoise. he was followed by, or he found there a great collection of people. the Governor of the Invalids came out and represented the impossibility of his delivering arms without the orders of those from whom he recieved them. De Corny advised the people then to retire, and retired himself: but the people took possession of the arms. it was remarkable that not only the Invalids themselves made no opposition, but that a body of 5000. foreign troops, within 400. yards, never stirred. M. de Corny and five others were then sent to ask arms of M. de Launay, governor of the Bastille. they found a great collection of people already before the place, and they immediately planted a flag of truce, which was answered by a like flag hoisted on the Parapet. the deputation prevailed on the people to fall back a little, advanced themselves to make their demand of the Governor, and in that instant a discharge from the Bastille killed four persons, of those nearest to the deputies. the deputies retired. I happened to be at the house of M. de Corny when he returned to it, and recieved from him a narrative of these transactions. on the retirement of the deputies, the people rushed forward, &amp; almost in an instant were in possession of a fortification, defended by 100. men, of infinite strength, which in other times had stood several regular sieges, and had never been taken. how they forced their entrance has never been explained. they took all the arms, discharged the prisoners, and such of the garrison as were not killed in the first moment of fury, carried the Governor and Lt Governor to the Place de Grève (the place of public execution) cut off their heads, and sent them thro’ the city in triumph to the Palais royal. about the same instant a treacherous correspondence having been discovered in M. de Flesselles, prevot des marchands, they siezed him in the Hotel de ville where he was in the execution of his office, and cut off his head. these events carried imperfectly to Versailles were the subject of two successive deputations from the assembly to the king, to both of which he gave dry and hard answers for nobody had as yet been permitted to inform him truly and fully of what had passed at Paris. but at night the Duke de Liancourt forced his way into the king’s bedchamber, and obliged him to hear a full and animated detail of the disasters of the day in Paris. he went to bed fearfully impressed. the decapitation of de Launai worked powerfully thro’ the night on the whole aristocratical party, insomuch that, in the morning, those of the greatest influence on the Count d’Artois represented to him the absolute necessity that the king should give up every thing to the Assembly. this according with

d no people ever recieved.  
And here again was lost another precious occasion of sparing to France the crimes and cruelties thro’ which she has since past, and to Europe, &amp; finally America the evils which flowed on them also from this mortal source. the king was now become a passive machine in the hands of the National assembly, and had he been left to himself, he would have willingly acquiesced in whatever they should devise as best for the nation. a wise constitution would have been formed, hereditary in his line, himself placed at it’s head, with powers so large as to enable him to do all the good of his station, and so limited as to restrain him from it’s abuse. this he would have faithfully administered, and more than this I do not believe he ever wished. but he had a Queen of absolute sway over his weak mind, and timid virtue, and of a character the reverse of his in all points. this angel, so gaudily painted in the rapsodies of the Rhetor Burke, with some smartness of fancy, but no sound sense was proud, disdainful of all restraint, indignant at all obstacle to her will, eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and firm enough to hold to her desires, or perish in their wreck. her inordinate gambling and dissipations, with those of the Count d’Artois, and others of her clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury, which called into action the reforming hand of the nation; and her opposition to it, her inflexible perverseness, and dauntless spirit, led herself to the Guillotine, and drew the king on with her, and plunged the world into crimes &amp; calamities which will for ever stain the pages of modern history. I have ever believed that had there been no queen, there would have been no revolution. no force would have been provoked nor exercised. the king would have gone hand in hand with the wisdom of his sounder Counsellors, who, guided by the increased lights of the age, wished only, with the same pace, to advance the principles of their social institution. the deed which closed the mortal course of these sovereigns, I shall neither approve nor condemn. I am not prepared to say that the first magistrate of a nation cannot commit treason against his country, or is unamenable to it’s punishment: nor yet that where there is no written law, no regulated tribunal, there is not a law in our hearts, and a power in our hands, given for righteous employment in maintaining right, and redressing wrong. of those who judged the king, many thought him wilfully criminal, many that his existence would keep the nation in perpetual conflict with the horde of kings, who would war against a regeneration which might come home to themselves, and that it were better that one should die than all. I should not have voted with this portion of the legislature. I should have shut up the Queen in a Convent, putting harm out of her power, and placed the king in his station, investing him with limited powers, which I verily believe he would have honestly exercised, according to the measure of his understanding. in this way no void would have been created, courting the usurpation of a military adventurer, nor occasion given for those enormities which demoralised the nations of the world, and destroyed, and is yet to destroy millions and millions of it’s inhabitants. there are three epochs in history signalised by the total extinction of National morality. the first was of the successors of Alexander, not omitting himself. the next the successors of the first Caesar, the third our own age. this was begun by the partition of Poland, followed by that of the treaty of Tilsit Pilnitz next the conflagration of Copenhagen; then the enormities of Bonaparte, partitioning the earth at his will, and devastating it with fire and sword; now the conspiracy of kings, the successors of Bonaparte, blasphemously calling themselves the Holy alliance, and treading in the footsteps of their incarcerated leader, not yet indeed usurping the government of other nations avowedly and in detail, but controuling by their armies the forms in which they will permit them to be governed; and reserving in petto the order and extent of the usurpations further  meditated.—but I will return from a digression, anticipated too in time, into which I have been led by reflection on the criminal passions which refused to the world a favorable occasion of saving it from the afflictions it has since suffered.  
Mr Necker had reached Basle before he was overtaken by the letter of the king, inviting him back to resume the office he had so recently left. he returned immediately, and all the other ministers having resigned, a new administration was named, to wit  
St Priest &amp; Montmorin were restored;  
the Archbishop of Bordeaux was appointed Garde des sceaux;  
La Tour du Pin Minister of War;  
La Luzerne Minister of Marine; this last was believed to have been effected by the friendship of Montmorin; for altho’ differing in politics, they continued firm in friendship, &amp; Luzerne, altho’ not an able man was thought an honest one.  
and the prince of Bauvau was taken into the Council.  
Seven princes of the blood royal, six ex-ministers, and many of the high Noblesse having fled, and the present ministers, except Luzerne, being all of the popular party, all the functionaries of government moved for the present in perfect harmony.  
In the evening of Aug. 4. and on the motion of the Viscount de Noailles brother in law of La Fayette, the assembly abolished all titles of rank, all the abusive privileges of feudalism, the tythes and casuals of the clergy, all provincial privileges, and, in fine, the Feudal regimen generally. to the suppression of tythes the Abbé Sieyes was vehemently opposed; but his learned and logical arguments were unheeded, and his estimation lessened by a contrast of his egoism (for he was beneficed on them) with the generous abandonment of rights by the other members of the assembly. many days were employed in putting into the form of laws the numerous demolitions of antient abuses; which done, they proceeded to the preliminary work of a Declaration of rights. there being much concord of sentiment on the elements of this instrument, it was liberally framed, and passed with a very general approbation. they then appointed a Committee for the redaction of a projet of a Constitution, at the head of which was the Archbishop of Bordeaux. I recieved from him, as Chairman of the Committee a letter of July 20. requesting me to attend and assist at their deliberations. but I excused myself on the obvious considerations that my mission was to the king as Chief magistrate of the nation, that my duties were limited to the concerns of my own country, and forbade me to intermeddle with the internal transactions of that in which I had been recieved under a specific character only. their plan of a constitution was discussed in sections, and so reported from time to time, as agreed to by the Committee. the first respected the general frame of the government; and that this should be formed into three departments, Executive, Legislative and Judiciary was generally agreed. but when they proceeded to subordinate developements, many and various shades of opinion came into conflict, and schisms, strongly marked, broke the Patriots into fragments of very discordant principles. the first question Whether there should be a king, met with no open opposition, and it was readily agreed that the government of France should be monarchical &amp; hereditary. Shall the king have a negative on the laws? shall that negative be absolute, or suspensive only? shall there be two chambers of legislation? or one only? if two, shall one of them be hereditary? or for life? or for a fixed term? and named by the king? or elected by the people? these questions found strong differences of opinion, and produced repulsive combinations among the Patriots. the Aristocracy was cemented by a common principle of preserving the ancient regime, or whatever should be nearest to it. making this their Polar star, they moved in phalanx, gave preponderance on every question to the minorities of the Patriots, and always to those who advocated the least change. the features of the new constitution were thus assuming a fearful aspect, and great alarm was produced among the honest patriots by these dissensions in their ranks. in this uneasy state of things, I recieved one day a note from the Marquis de la Fayette, informing me he should bring a party of six or eight friends to ask a dinner of me the next day. I assured him of their welcome. when they arrived, they were La Fayette himself, Duport, Barnave, Alexander La Meth, Blacon, Mounier, Maubourg, and Dagout. these were leading patriots, of honest but differing opinions, sensible of the necessity of effecting a coalition by mutual sacrifices, and, knowing each other, and not afraid therefore to unbosom themselves mutually. this last was a material principle in the selection. with this view the Marquis had invited the conference, and had fixed the time &amp; place inadvertently as to the embarrasment under which it might place me. the cloth being removed and wine set on the table, after the American manner, the Marquis introduced the objects of the conference by summarily reminding them of the state of things in the assembly, the course which the principles of the constitution was taking, and the inevitable result, unless checked by more concord among the patriots themselves. he observed that altho’ he also had his opinion, he was ready to sacrifice it to that of his brethren of the same cause: but that a common opinion must now be formed, or the Aristocracy would carry every thing, and that whatever they should now agree on, he, at the head of the National force, would maintain. the discussions began at the hour of four, and were continued till ten aclock in the evening; during which time I was a silent witness to a coolness and candor of argument unusual in the conflicts of political opinion; to a logical reasoning, and chaste eloquence, disfigured by no gaudy tinsel of rhetoric or declamation, and truly worthy of being placed in parrallel parallel with the finest dialogues of antiquity, as handed to us by Xenophon, by Plato, and Cicero. the result was an agreement that the king should have a suspensive veto on the laws, that the legislature should be composed of a single body only, &amp; that to be chosen by the people. this Concordate decided the fate of the constitution. the Patriots all rallied to the principles thus settled, carried every question agreeably to them, and reduced the Aristocracy to insignificance and impotence. but duties of exculpation were now incumbent on me. I waited on Count Montmorin the next morning, and explained to him with truth and candor how it had happened that my house had been made the scene of conferences of such a character. he told me he already knew every thing which had passed, that, so far from taking umbrage at the use made of my house on that occasion, he earnestly wished I would habitually assist at such conferences, being sure I should be useful in moderating the warmer spirits, and promoting a wholesome and practicable reformation only. I told him I knew too well the duties I owed to the king, to the nation, and to my own country to take any part in councils concerning their internal government, and that I should persevere with care in the character of a neutral and passive spectator, with wishes only and very sincere ones, that those measures might prevail which would be for the greatest good of the nation. I have no doubt indeed that this conference was previously known and approved by this honest minister, who was in confidence and communication with the patriots, and wished for a reasonable reform of the Constitution.  
Here I discontinue my relation of the French revolution. the minuteness with which I have so far given it’s details is disproportioned to the general scale of my narrative. but I have thought it justified by the interest which the whole world must take in this revolution. as yet we are but in the first chapter of it’s history. the appeal to the rights of man, which had been made in the US. was taken up by France, first of the European nations. from her the spirit has spread over those of the South. the tyrants of the North have allied indeed against it. but it is irresistable. their opposition will only multiply it’s millions of human victims; their own satellites will catch it, and the condition of man thro’ the civilized world will be finally and greatly ameliorated. this is a wonderful instance of great events from small causes. so inscrutable is the arrangement of causes &amp; consequences in this world that a two-penny duty on tea, unjustly imposed in a sequestered part of it, changes the condition of all it’s inhabitants.   I have been more minute in relating the early transactions of this regeneration because I was in circumstances peculiarly favorable for a knolege of the truth. possessing the confidence and intimacy of the leading patriots, &amp; more than all of the Marquis Fayette, their head and Atlas, who had no secrets for me, I learnt with correctness the views &amp; proceedings of that party; while my intercourse with the diplomatic missionaries of Europe at Paris, all of them with the court, and eager in prying into it’s councils and proceedings, gave me a knolege of these also. my information was always and immediately committed to writing, in letters to mr Jay, and often to my friends, and a recurrence to these letters now ensures me against errors of memory.  
These opportunities of information ceased at this period, with my retirement from this interesting scene of action. I had been more than a year solliciting leave to go home with a view to place my daughters in the society &amp; care of their friends, and to return for a short time to my station at Paris. but the metamorphosis thro’ which our government was then passing from it’s Chrysalid to it’s Organic  form, suspended it’s action in a great degree; and it was not till the last of August that I recieved the permission I had asked.—And here I cannot leave this great and good country without expressing my sense of it’s preeminence of character among the nations of the earth. a more benevolent people, I have never known, nor greater warmth &amp; devotedness in their select friendships. their kindness and accomodation to strangers is unparalleled, and the hospitality of Paris is beyond any thing I had concieved to be practicable in a large city. their eminence too in science, the communicative dispositions of their scientific men, the politeness of the general manners, the ease and vivacity of their conversation, give a charm to their society to be found no where else. in a comparison of this with other countries we have the proof of primacy, which was given to Themistocles after the battle of Salamis. every general voted to himself the first reward of valor, and the second to Themistocles. so ask the traveled inhabitant of any nation, In what country on earth would you rather live?—certainly in my own, where are all my friends, my relations, and the earliest &amp; sweetest affections and recollections of my life.—Which would be your second choice?—France.  
On the 26th of Sep. I left Paris for Havre, where I was detained by contrary winds until the 8th of Oct. on that day and the 9th I crossed over to Cowes, where I had engaged the Clermont, capt Colley, to touch for me. she did so, but here again we were detained by contrary winds until the 22d when we embarked and landed at Norfolk on the 23d of November. on my way home I passed some days at Eppington in Chesterfield, the residence of my friend and connection, mr Eppes, and, while there, I recieved a letter from the President, Genl Washington, by express, covering an appointment to be Secretary of State. I recieved it with real regret. my wish had been to return to Paris, where I had left my houshold establishment, as if there myself, and to see the end of the revolution, which, I then thought would be certainly and happily closed in less than a year. I then meant to return home, to withdraw from Political life, into which I had been impressed by the circumstances of the times, to sink into the bosom of my family and friends, and devote myself to studies more congenial to my mind. in my answer of Dec. 15. I expressed these dispositions candidly to the President, and my preference of a return to Paris; but assured him that if it was believed I could be more useful in the administration of the government, I would sacrifice my own inclinations without hesitation, and repair to that destination. this I left to his decision. I arrived at Monticello on the 23d of Dec. where I recieved a 2d letter from the President, expressing his continued wish that I should take my station there, but leaving me still at liberty to continue in my former office, if I could not reconcile myself to that now proposed. this silenced my reluctance, and I accepted the new appointment.  
In the interval of my stay at home, my eldest daughter had been happily married to the eldest son of the Tuckahoe branch of Randolphs, a young gentleman of genius, science and honorable mind, who afterwards filled a dignified station in the general government, &amp; the most dignified in his own state. I left Monticello on the 1st of March 1790. for new York. at Philadelphia I called on the venerable and beloved Franklin. he was then on the bed of sickness from which he never rose. my recent return from a country in which he had left so many friends, and the perilous convulsions to which they had been exposed, revived all his anxieties to know what part they had taken, what had been their course, and what their fate. he went over all in succession, with a rapidity and animation almost too much for his strength. when all his enquiries were satisfied, and a pause took place, I told him I had learnt with much pleasure that, since his return to America, he had been occupied in preparing for the world the history of his own life. I cannot say much of that, said he; but I will give you a sample of what I shall leave: and he directed his little grandson (William Bache) who was standing by the bedside, to hand him a paper from the table to which he pointed. he did so; and the Doctr putting it into my hands, desired me to take it, and read it at my leisure. it was about a quire of folio paper, written in a large and running hand very like his own. I looked into it slightly, then shut it and said I would accept his permission to read it, and would carefully return it. he said ‘no, keep it.’ not certain of his meaning, I again looked into it, folded it for my pocket, and said again, I would certainly return it. ‘no,’ said he ‘keep it.’ I put it into my pocket, and shortly after took leave of him. he died on the 17th of the ensuing month of April; and as I understood that he had bequeathed all his papers to his grandson William Temple Franklin, I immediately wrote to mr Franklin to inform him I possessed this paper, which I should consider as his property, and would deliver to his order. he came on immediately to New York, called on me for it, and I delivered it to him. as he put it into his pocket, he said, carelessly he had either the original, or another copy of it, I do not recollect which. this last expression struck my attention forcibly, and for the first time suggested to me the thought that Dr Franklin had meant it as a confidential deposit in my hands, and that I had done wrong in parting from it. I have not yet seen the collection he published  of Doctor Franklin’s works, and therefore know not if this is among them. I have been told it is not. it contained a narrative of the negociations between Dr Franklin and the British ministry, when he was endeavoring to prevent the contest of arms which followed. the negociation was brought about by the intervention, of Ld Howe and his sister, who, I believe, was called Lady Howe, but I may misremember her title. Ld Howe seems to have been friendly to America, and exceedingly anxious to prevent a rupture. his intimacy with Dr Franklin, and his position with the ministry induced him to undertake a mediation between them; in which his sister seemed to have been associated.  they carried from the one to the other, backwards and forwards, the several propositions and answers which past, and seconded with their own intercessions the importance of mutual sacrifices to preserve the peace &amp; connection of the two countries. I remember that Ld North’s answers were dry, unyielding, in the spirit of unconditional submission, and betrayed an absolute indifference to the occurrence of a rupture; and he said to the mediators distinctly at last that ‘a rebellion was not to be deprecated on the part of Great Britain; that the confiscations it would produce would provide for many of their friends.’ this expression was reported by the mediators to Dr Franklin, and indicated so cool and calculated a purpose in the ministry, as to render compromise hopeless, and the negociation was discontinued. if this is not among the papers published, we ask what is become of it? I delivered it with my own hands into those of Temple Franklin. it certainly established views so atrocious in the British government as that it’s suppression would to them be worth a great price. but could the grandson of Dr Franklin be guilty in such degree an accomplice in the parricide of the memory of his immortal grandfather? the suspension for more than 20. years of the general publication bequeathed and confided to him, produced for a while hard suspicions against him: and if at last all are not published, a part of these suspicions may remain with some.  
I arrived at New York on the 21st of Mar. where Congress was in session.

/  
beloved Franklin. He was then oil the !&gt;•*! oi  
sickness, fmm which he never rose. My re­  
cent return from a countryin which he had left  
so many friends and the perilous convulsions to  
which they had heen exposed, revived all his  
anxieties &#x27;o know what part they had taken,  
what had been their course, and what their f»te  
He went over all in succes-ioo, &quot;&#x27;i’h a rap&#x27;dity  
and animation almost too much for his strength  
When all his inquiries were sa&#x27;isfied, and a  
pause took place, I told him I had learned vv i It  
much pleasure that, since his return to Ame­  
rica, he had been occupied in preparing for the  
world the history of hi? own life I cannot iuy  
mu&lt;h of that Said he; hut I will give you a sam­  
ple of what I shall leave; and n&lt;- direcn&#x27;il his  
hitle grandson (Wm Ba&lt;*hc) who vv.*s standing  
by the bed side, to hand him a papet Ironi the  
table, to which he pointed. He did »«»;and the  
Doctor puiung it mho my hands, d sired me  
to take it, and read it a&lt; my leisuic. It was about  
a quite of folio pap&lt;r, w ritten in a large and  
running hand, v* ry like hi# own. I lookrtl into  
it slightly, then shut it, and said ! would ac­  
cept Iris permission :o read it, and would care­  
fully return it. He said, ‘no, keep it.’ No&#x27;  
certain of his meaning, I again look&#x27; d into it,  
folded it for my poc ket, and said again, 1 would  
certainly return it. ‘ Nc.,’ said he,4 kiep i&#x27;.’—  
I put it into my pocket, and shortly after  
took leave of him He died on the 17th of the  
ensuing month of April; and as I understood  
that he had bequeathed til) his papers to his  
grandson, William Temple Fianklin, I imme­  
diately wrote to Mr. F-anklin, to inform him  
I possessed &#x27;his paper, which I should consi­  
der as his property, jnd would deliver to hi**  
older. He came on immediately to New York,  
called on me for it, and I d&lt; liver* ri it to him.  
As lie pul it into his pocket, he said carelessly,  
he had either the oiiginal, or another copv of  
it, 1 do not recollect which. This last expres­  
sion struck my attention forcibly, and fur the  
first time suggested to me the thought, that  
Doctor Fianklin had meant it as a confidential  
d* posite in my hands, and that I had done  
wrong in pat tng from it. I have not yet seen  
the collection he puhltsnrd of Dt. Frunkiin’s  
works,-and theieTore know not if this is among  
them. I h *ve been told it is not. It con&#x27;ain*d

(ached to ancient establishments; and who, taken •  
all in all, was the ablest man in debate I hare ever  
met with. He I. id not indeed, the poetical fancy  
of Mr. Henry, his sublime imagination, bis lofty  
and overwhelming diction; but he was cool,smooth  
and persuasive; his language flowing, chaste and  
embellished; for it he lost the main battle, be rc­  
  
lurucu upon you ano regained so much ol it n9 to  
make it a diawn one, tty dexterous manoeuvres,  
skirmishes in detail, and the recovery of small  
advantages which, little singly, were important al­  
together. You never kn*-w when you were clear  
at him,but were hnrrassed by hi&lt; perseverance, un­  
til the patience wa» worn down of all who had  
less ol it than himself. Add to this, that he was one  
ot thp most virtuous and benevolent of meu, the  
kindest friend, the most amiable anil pleasant of  
companions, which ensured a favorable reception  
to whatever came from him. Finding that the gen­  
era] principle of entails could not be maintained,  
he took his stand on an amendment which he pro­  
posed, instead of an absolute abolition, to |v&gt;nnit  
the tenant in tail to convey in fee simple if he  
chose it: and he was within a few voles of saving  
so much of (he old law. Hut the bill passed final­  
ly for entire abolition.—In that one of the hills for  
organizing our judiciary system, which proposed  
a court or Chancery, I had provided for a trial by  
jury of all matters of fact, in that as well us in the  
courts of law. He defeated it by the introduction  
of tour words only, if either party choose. The  
consequence has been, that as no suitor n il! say i  
to his judge—,Sir, I distrust you, give me a jury,&#x27;  
juries are rarely, i might say perhaps never seen J  
in that court, but when called for by tljo Chancel- :

return to Paris, where I had left my household  
establishment, as if there myself, and to see the  
end of the Revolution, which, I then thought,  
would be certainly and happily closed in less  
than a year.  
withdraw from political life, into which [had  
been impressed by the circumstances of the times,

and devote myself to studies, more congenial to

expressed these dispositions candidly to the Pre-  
sident, and my preference of a return to Paris;  
but assured him, that if it was believed | could  
be more useful in the administration of the go-  
vernment, I would sacrifice my own inclinations  
without hesitation, and repair to that destination;  
this I left to his decision. I arrived at Monti-  
cello on the 23d of December, where I received  
a second lette: frum the President, expressing  
his continued wish, that I should take my sta-  
tion there, but leaving me still at liberty to con-  
tinue in my former office, if I could not reconcile  
myself to that now proposed. This silenced my  
reluctance, and I accepted the new appointment.  
  
‘*In the interval of my stay at home, my  
eldest daughter had been happily married tothe  
eldest son of the Tuckahoe branch of the Ran-  
dolphs, a young gentleman of genius, science,  
and honorable mind, who afterwards filled a  
dignified station in the General Government, and  
the most dignified in his own state. I left  
Monticello on the Ist of March, 1790, for New  
York. At Philadelphia I called on the venerable  
and beloved Franklin. He was then onthe bed  
of sickness, from which he never rose. My re-  
cent return from a country in which he had left  
so many friends, and the perilous convulsions to  
which they had been exposed, revived all his  
anxieties to know what part they had taken.  
what had been their course, and what their fate.  
He went over all in succession, witha rapidity  
and animation, almost too much far his strength.  
When all his enquiries were satisfied, and a pause  
took place, I told him I had learned with much  
pleasure that, since his return to America, he  
had been occupied in preparing for the world,  
the history of his own life. I cannot say much  
of that, said he; but I will give you a sample of  
what [ shall leave; and ke directed his little  
grandson (Wm. Bache) who was standing by  
the bed side, to hand him a paper from the table,  
to which he pointed. He did so, and the Doc-  
tor putting it into my hands, desired me to take  
it, and road it at my leisure. It was about a  
quire of folio paper, written in a large and run-  
ning hand, very like his own.  
slightly, then shut it, and said I would accept  
his permission to read it, and would carefully  
return it. He said, ‘ no, keep it.” Not certain  
of his meaning, I again looked into it, folded it  
for my pocket, and said again, [ would certainly  
return it. ‘ No,’ said he, ‘ keep it.’ I put it  
into my pocket, and shortly after, took leave of  
him. He died on the 17th of the ensuing month  
of April; and as I understood that hv had be-  
queathed all bis papers to his grandson, William  
Temple Franklin, I immediately wrote to Mr.  
Franklin, to inform him I possessed this paper,  
which 1 should consider as his property, and  
would deliver to his order. He came on im-  
mediately to New York, called on me for it, and  
I delivered it to him. As he put it into his  
pocket, he said carelessly, he had either the  
original, or another copy of it, [ do not recollect  
which. This last expression struck my attention  
forcibly, and for the first time suggested to me  
the thought, that Dr. Franklin had meant it as  
a confidential deposit in my hands, and that I  
had done wrong in parting from it.  
  
I have not seen the collection he published of  
Dr. Franklin’s works, and therefore, know not  
if this is among them. I have been told it 1s  
not. It contained a narrative of the negociation  
between Dr. Franklin and the British Ministry,  
when he was endeavoring to prevent the contest  
of arina which followed. The negociation was  
brought about by the invention of Lord Howe,  
and his sister, who, I believe, was called lady  
Howe, but I may misremember her title. Lord  
Howe seems to have been friendly to America,  
and exceedingly anxious to prevent a rupture.  
His intimacy with Dr. Franklin, and his position  
with the Ministry, induced him to undertake a  
mediation between them, in which his sister  
seemed to have been associated. They carried  
from one to the other, backwards and forwards,  
the several propositions and answers which  
passed, and seconded, with their own interces-  
sions, the importance of mutual sacrifices, to  
preserve the peace and connexion of two coun-  
tries. I-remember that Lord North’s answers  
were dry, unyielding, in the spirit of uncondi ion-  
al submission, and betrayed an absolute indif-  
ference to the occurrence of a rupture; tind he  
said to the mediators directly, at last, that ‘a  
rebellion was not to be deprecated on the part  
of Great Britain; that the confiscations it would  
produce, would provide for many of their friends.’  
This expression was reported by the inedia-  
tors to Dr. Franklin, and indicated so cool and  
calculated a purpose in the Ministry as to render  
compromise hopeless, and the negociation was  
discontinued. If this is not among the papers  
published, I ask, what has become of it? I deli-  
vered it with my own hands, into those of Tem-  
ple Franklin. It certainly established views so  
atrocious in the British Government, that its  
suppression would, to them, be worth a great  
price.—But-could the grandson of Dr. Franklin  
be, ineuch a degree, an accomplice in the pa-  
ricide of the memory of his immortal grandfather.  
The suspension for more than twenty years, of  
the general publication, bequeathed and confid-  
ed to him, produced, for a while, hard suspicions  
  
a part of those suspicions may remain with  
some.

to Paris, where! had left my household estab­

of the Revolution, which I then thought, would  
be certainty and happily closed in less than

draw from political life, into which I had been  
impressed by the circumstances of the times,  
to sink into the bosom of my family k friends,  
and devote thyself to studies, more congenial  
to my mind. In my answer of December,  
1&#x27;nh, I expressed these dispositions candidly to  
ike President, and my preference of a return  
to Paris ; but nisured him, that if it was believ­  
ed I could he more useful m the administration

iatimaev with Dr. Franklin, and his position  
with tha Ministry induced him to undertake a

•aemed to have been associated. They earn­  
ed from out to tha other, backwards and for­

which passed, and seconded with their own  
intercessions the impo-tance of mutual sacri­  
fices, to preserve the paece and connrxiiuri of  
the two countries. I remember that Lord  
North&#x27;s answers were dry, unyielding, in tha  
spirit ol unconditional submission, and betray­  
ed an absolute indifference lo the occurrence  
of a rupture ; and he said to the tnedialoif di  
reclly, at last, that a rebellion was not to be  
deprecated on the part of Great Britain ; that  
the confiscations it would produce, would pro­

tion was reported by the mediators to Doctor  
Franklin, and indicated so cool and calculated  
a purpose in the ministry, as to render com­  
promise hopeless, and the negotiation was dis­  
continued. If this is not amurfg the papers

haxl less of it than himself. I Add to this, that he wax  
  
one of ihe most virtuous and benevolent of men, thel  
  
kindest mend, the most amiable and pleasant of com­

stand on an amendment which he proposed, Instead  
of an absolute abolition, to permit the tenantin tail to  
convey in fee simple if he chose it:! and he was with  
  
in a few votes of saving so much of the old law. But  
the bill passed finally for entire abolition. In that one

so influenced the destinies of this country  
and of mankind.  
  
“When the famous Resolutions of 1765,  
against the Stamp-act, were proposed, I was yet  
a student at law in Williamsburg. I attended  
the debate, however, at the door of the lobby of  
  
the House of Burgesses, and heard the splendid  
display of Mr. Henry’s talents as a popular ora-  
tor. They were great indeed ; such as { have  
never heard from any other man. He appeared to  
me to speak as [omer wrote. Mr. Johnson, a law-  
yer, and member from the Nothern neck, second-  
ed the resolutions, and by him the learning and  
logic of the case were chiefly maintained. My  
recollections of these transactions may be seen  
page 60 of the life of Patrick Henry, by Wirt,  
to whom I furnished them.  
  
In May, 1769, a meeting of the General Ar-  
sembly was called by the Governor, Lord Bote-  
tourt. I had then become a member ; and to that  
meeting became known the joint resolutions and  
address of the Lords and Commons of 1768-9,  
on the proceedings i in Massachusetts. Counter-  
resolutions, and an address to the King by the  
House of Burgesses, were agreed to with little  
opposition, and a spirit manifestly displayed it-  
self of considering the cause of Massachusetts  
as asommon one. &quot; ‘he Governor dissolved us :  
but we met the next day in the Apollo* of the  
Raleigh tavern, formed ourselves into a volun-  
tery convention, drew up articles of association  
against the use of any merchandise imported  
from Great Britain, signed and recommended  
them to the people, repaired to our several coun-  
ties, and were re-elected without any other ex-  
ception than of the very few who had declined  
assent to our proceedings.

him to take the paper, and put it into a form he  
could approve. Te did so, preparing an entire  
new statement, and preserving, of the fornier,  
only the last four paragraphs and half of the pre

signal proof of their indulgence to Mr. Dickin-

ting him to draw their second petition to the  
King according to his own ideas, and passing if  
with scarcely any amendment. The disgust  
against its humility was general; and Mr. Dick-  
inson’s delight at its passage was the only cir-  
cumstance which reconciled them to it. The  
vote being passed, although further observation  
on it was out of order, he could not refrain from  
rising and expressing his satisfaction, and con-  
cluded by saying ‘there is but one word, Mr

January &lt;&gt;, 18il.—At the age ot i *, I j  
began to make some memoranda, and state  
some recollection of dates and facts con­  
cerriing myself, for my own more ready  
reference, and tor tho information ot my j  
family.  
  
I he tradition nt my tamer 8 family was,  
that their ancestors came to this country)  
from Wales, and from near the mountains j  
of Snowden, the highest in Great Britain.,  
I noted once a case from W ales, in the law  
reports, where a person of our name was i  
either plaintifl’ or defendant: and one of  
the same was secretary to the \ irgima ,  
Company. These are the only instances &#x27;  
in which 1 have met witli the name in that  
countrv. I have found it in our early re- j  
cords; but the first particular information  
f have of any ancestor was of mv grand- j  
father, who lived at the place in Chc-ter*;  
field called Osborne’s, &amp; owned the lands  
afterwards the ^lebe of the parish. He j  
had thiceson*; Thomas, who died young,  
Field, who settled on the waters of the  
Roanoke, and left several descendants,  
and Peter, mv father, who settled on the!  
lands 1 still own, called Shad well, adjoin­  
ing my present residence. He was horn  
Feb. 29, 1707-8, and intermarried 1799. j  
with Jane Randolph, of the age of 19,  
daughter of Isham Randolph, one of the  
seven sons of that name and family settled &lt;  
it Dungerness in Goochland.—They trace j I  
their pedigree far back in England audi&#x27;  
Scotland, to which let every one ascribe  
the faith and merit he chooses. ! I  
My father&#x27;s education had been quitejl  
neglected; but being of a strong ryind, 11  
sound judgment, and eager after inform&#x27;d- |i  
[ton, he read much and improved himself,;  
inasmuch that he was chosen with Joshua |  
Fry, professor of Mathematics in Wilburn j i  
and Mary College, to continue the boun-1!  
dary line between Virginia and N. Caro-, i  
lina, winch bad been begun by Colonel i  
Byrd; and was afterwards employed with t  
the same Mr. Fry to make die first map t  
&quot;d* Virginia which had e^£r J&gt;c» n made, j  
hat of Captain Smith being merely a con-1 i  
ectured sketch. They possessed excel-! I  
cut materials ft»r so much of the country I c  
is is below the Blue Ridge; little being! t  
’•en known lieyoru! that Ridge. Ho was!&#x27;  
  
the third or fourth settler about tho year  
17:JO, of the part of the country where I  
live—He died August 17th, 1757, leaving  
uv mother a widow, who lived till !77t&gt;  
urith six daughters and two sons, myself  
the elder—To my younger brother he left  
ns estate on James River, called Snowden,  
liter the supposed birth place of the fami­  
v; to nivself, the lands on which I * as  
iorn and live—He placed me at tho Eng­  
lish school at five years of age, and tho.  
Latin at nine, where I continued until Ins  
Jeath. My teacher, Mr. Douglas, aclor­  
Tvmnn frnn Scotland, with the rudimente  
tf the Latin and (ireck langu.iges, taught  
lie the French; and on the death of my  
father, l went to the Reverend Mr. Maury,  
i correct classical scholar, with whom I  
continued two years; and then, to wit, in  
the Spring of 1700, went to William and  
Mary ColUge, where 1 continued two  
years. It wis my great good fortune, and  
what prohalty fixed the destinies of my  
life, that Dr.VVm. Small of Scotland, wag  
then professo^of Mathematics, j^man pro­  
found iu most of the useful iKuMches of  
science, with i happy talent%&amp;&amp;)iririiuiii­  
cation, correctand gentlenuiiirWmnners,  
and an enlarged and liberal mind. He,  
most happily ter me, became soon attach­  
ed to me, and nude me Ins daily compan­  
ion when not engaged in school; and from  
ins conversation I got my first views ot  
the expansion of science, and ot the sys­  
tem of things itj which 1 am placed.—  
Fortunately, tho philosophical chair be­  
came vacant soon alter my arrival at Col­  
lege, and he was appointed to fill it pet  
interim; and ho ivas tho first who ever  
gave, m that colltge, regular lectures iu  
Ethics, Rhetoric ind Relies-Letters, tic  
returned* Eurou. tu 170^, haymg previ­  
ously tiiW* tip tlf measure of fct* good­  
ness to me, by procuring fir me, from his  
most intimate fYield (ieorgo Wythe, a re­  
ception as a studmt of law. under Ins di­  
  
reetion, and introdiceo me to tiie acquaint­

office. With him. and ut his table, Dr.  
Small and Mr. Wythe, his amici omnium  
horarum, and myself, formed a purtic  
nuarrcc, audio the habitual conversations  
on these occasions I owe much instruction.  
Mr. Wythe continued to be my faithful  
beloved Mentor in youth, mid my most  
affectionate friend through life. In 17(57,  
he led me into the practice of the law at  
the liar of the (icnrral Court, at which I

‘These opportunities of information,  
ceased at tins period, with my retirement  
Iro.n this interesting scene of nction. I  
had been more than a year soliciting leave  
Lo go home, with a view to place my daugh­  
ters in the society mid care of their friends,  
Find to return for a short tune, to my sta­  
tion at Paris. Rut tho metamorphosis  
through which our government was then  
passing from its Chrysalid to its Organic  
liirrn, suspended its action in a grout de­  
cree; and it was not till the last of August  
that 1 received the permission 1 had asked.  
And here 1 cannot leave this great and  
food country, without expressing my s&#x27;-nse  
jf its pre-enuncm e of character, urn »ng  
the nations of the earth. A more benevo­  
lent |&gt;eoplc I have never known, nor great­  
i;r warmth and dcvotcducss m their select  
friendships. Their kindness and accom  
niodutioii to strangers, is unparralioled and  
tho hospitality of Paris is beyond any tiling  
I hud conceived to he practicable in a large  
ity. Their eminence, too, in science,  
the communicative disposition of their »ci*  
entitle inen, tho jKilitcness tho general  
manners, the ease and vivacity of their  
conversation, give a charm to their socie­  
ty, to lie found no where else. In a com­  
parison of this, with other countries, wo  
lave the proof of piirnacy w hich was given  
to Thennstocles, after the battle of fc&#x27;ulu*  
mis. Every general voted to himself the  
first reward of valor, and tho second to  
Themistocles.&#x27; So, ask the travelled in­  
habitant of any nation, in w hat country on  
.nrth would you rather live/ Certainly, ill  
my own, where arc nil my friends, my re­  
lations, and the earliest and sweetest af  
lections and recollections of my life.—  
Which would be your second choice?  
France.

fjjy answer of December, I5t»t, I expressed  
♦hose dispositions candidly to the Presi­  
dent, and my preference of a return to  
Paris; hot assured him, that if it wus be­  
lieved l could be more useful in the ad­  
ministration of the government, I would  
sacrifice my own inclinations without hes­  
itation, and repair to that destination; tins  
1 left to his decision, I arrived at Monti*  
cello, on the 2ld ot Decetnb :r, where 1  
received a second letter Irotn the 1 resideo,  
expressing lus continued wi-h, that 1  
should take mv station there, but leaving  
rnr* still at liberty to continue m my former  
office if 1 could not reconcile myself to  
that now proposed. Tins silenced my re*  
luctaoce, and 1 accepted the new appoint*  
moot.  
* In the interval of my stay at home, in&#x27;  
eldest daughter bad been happily married  
to the eldest son ot the I uc^aho branch  
of Randolphs, a young gentleman ot geni­  
us, science and honorable mind, who af­  
terwards filled a dignified station in the  
&lt;ieneral Government, and the most digni­  
fied in lus own State. I left Monticello,  
on the i»t of March, 1790. for New York.  
At Philadelphia l called on the venerable  
and beloved Franklin. He was then on  
the bed of sickness, trow whicn he never  
rose. My recent return troiri q country  
in winch he had left so many friends, and  
the perilous convulsion to vhich they had  
been exposed revived all ii» anxieties to  
know what part they had token, &quot; hat had  
been their course and whit their tafe.—  
He went over all in sutfession, with a  
  
rapktakMUKl animation, iJrnost too much  
for lus strength. When ill his enquiries  
wortf satisfied, and a pause took place, I  
told hunt r.ad learned wth much pleasure  
that since his return to America, ho had  
beeu occupied in preparing for the world,  
the history of his own Ife. I cannot say  
much of that, said he; lut I will give you  
a sample of wh.it I shat leave; and ho di­  
rected his little grandton (Wm. Bache)  
who was standing bv tie lied side, to hand (  
him a paper from the table to which he  
pointed. He did go; ind the Doctor put­  
ting it into mv hands, lesired me to take it  
and read it at my leisire. It was about a;  
rpiire of folio paper, witten 1:1 a large arid |  
running hand, very like his own. I looked  
into it slightly, then shut it, and said 11  
would accept his perriissiou to read, aud j  
would carefully return it. He said, * uo, j  
keep it.’ Not certain of his meaning, I j  
again looked into it, folded it tor ray pock |  
et, and said again 1 wculd certainly return I  
it. ‘ No,* said he, ‘ keep it.’ I put it into i  
my pocket, and shortly after, took leave  
of him. He died on the 7th of the ensuing  
month of April; and as I understood that he  
hud bequeathed all his papers to his grand  
son, William Temple Franklin, I imniedi-j  
ately wrote to Mr. Franklin, to inform him  
! possessed this paper, which I should  
consider as his property, and would deliv­  
er to his order. He came on immediately j  
to New A’ork. called on me for it, and !;  
delivered it to him. As lie put it into his!  
pocket, he said, carelessly, he had either  
the original, or another copy of it. I do not  
recollect which. This last expression  
struck m attention forcibly, and for the  
first time suggested to me die thought that  
Dr. Franklin had meant it as a confidential  
ileposito in mv hands, that I had done  
wrong in parting troin it. I have not yet  
seen the collection he published of Doctor  
Franklin’s works, and therefore, know not  
if this is among them. I have been told  
4t is not. It contained a narrative of the  
negotiations between Dr. b ranklin and the  
British ministry, when he was endeavor­  
ing to prevent the contest of arms which  
followed. The negotiation was brought  
about by the intervention of Lord Howe  
and his sister, who, I believe, was called  
Lady Howe, but I may misremember her  
title. Lord Howe seems to have been  
friendly to America, and exceedingly  
anxious to prevent a rupture. His intima­  
cy with Dr. Franklin, and his position  
with the Ministry induced him to undertake  
a mediation between them; in which his  
sister seetned to have been associated.—  
They carried from one to the other, back­  
  
wards and forwards, tne sever u preposi­  
tions and answers, which passed, and  
seconded with their own intercessions the  
importance of mutual sacrifices, to preserve  
(he peace and connexion of the two coun  
tries. I remember that Lord North&#x27;s  
answers were dry, unyielding, in the spirit  
of unconditional submission, and betrayed  
an absolute indifference to the occurrence  
of a rupture, and he said to the mediators  
directly, at last, that a rebellion was not  
to be deprecated on the part ot Great  
Britain; that the confiscations it would  
produce, would provide for many of their  
friends.* Tins expression was reported  
by tiie mediators to Doctor 1 rankhu, and j  
indicated so cool and calculated a purpose j  
in tlie ministry, as to render compromise &lt;  
hopeless, and the negotiation was discon­  
tinued. If this is not among the papers  
published, we a9k what has become ot it ?;  
1 delivered it with mv own hands, into  
those of Temple Franklin. It certainly  
established views so attrocious in the Brit*  
ish Government that its suppression would,  
to them, be worth a great price. But  
could the grandson of Dr. Franklin be, in  
such degroe, an accomplice in the parri­  
cide of the memory of his immortal grand­  
father? Tim suspensions for more than  
twenty years, of the general publication,  
bequeathed and confided to him, produced  
for a while, hard suspicions against him.  
and if. at least, all are not published, a  
part of those suspicions may remam with  
some.

Mr. Pendleton. &quot; The repeal was  
strongly opposed by Mr. Pendleton, who  
was zealously attached to ancient establish­  
ments, and who, taken all in all, was the  
ablest man in debate I have ever met with.  
He had not indeed, the poetical fancy of  
Mr. Henry, his sublime imagination, his  
lofty and overwhelming diction, but he was  
cool, smooth and persuasive, his language  
flowing, chasteand embellished j for if he  
lost the main battle, he returned upon you  
and regained so much of it as to make it a  
drawn one, by dexterous manoeuvres, skir­  
mishes in details, and the recovery of small  
advantages, which, little singly, were im­  
portant altogether. You never knew when  
you were clear of him, but were harrased  
by his perseverance ; until the patience was  
worn down, of all&#x27; who had less of it than  
Himself. Add to this, that he was one ot  
the most virtuous and benevolent of men,  
the kindest friend, the most amiable and  
pleasant of companions, which ensured a  
favorable reception to whatever came from  
him. Finding &#x27;thai the general principle ol  
entails could not be maintained, he took bis  
stand on an amendment which he proposed,  
instead of an abolition, to permit the tenant  
in tail to convey in free simple if he chose  
it, and he was within a few votes of saving  
so much of the old law. But the bill passed  
fitiallv for entire abolition. In one ol  
the bills for organizing our Judiciary system  
which proposes a Court of Chancery, I bad  
provided for a trial by jury of all matters ot  
fact, in that as well as in the courts of law.  
He defeated it by the introduction of four

Messrs. Wythe and Madison. In giving  
this account of the laws of which I was my­  
self the mover and draughtsman, I by no  
means, mean to claim to myself the mtrit.  
of obtaining their, passage. I had man v  
occasional and strenuous coadjutors in de  
bate, and one most stedfast, able and zeal­  
ous, who was himself a host. This was  
George Mason, a man of; the first order; of  
wisdom among those tvho acted on thr  
Theatre of the 1 evolution, of expansive  
mind profound lodgment, cogent in argu  
ment, learned in the lore of our former con  
stitutidn, and earnest for the Republicar.  
change on Democratic principles. His elo­  
cution was neither flowing nor smooth,5 bur  
his language was strong, His manner mosi  
impressive, and strengthened by a dash o  
biting cynicism, when provocation made i  
seasonable. &#x27; : . . -r 1

reasoning powers, gave him greaijweight .  
Of him, see more in some notes inclosed in  
hy letter of August 13, 1821, to Mr. Jno.  
Saundersbn. r  
Mr. Madison came in the house in 1776  
a new member and young, while circum.  
stances cohcuning &quot;with his extreme modes.  
ty , prevented his venturing himself in debate  
before his removal to the Council of State,  
m iov . r rom inence ne went to  
Congress, then consisting of few members.  
Trained in these successive schools, he ac  
quired a habit of self possession, which  
placed at ready command the rich resources  
of his luminous and discriminating mind,;ind  
of his extensive information, and rendered  
him the first of every assembly afterwards,  
of which he became a member. Never  
wandered from his subject into vain decla­  
mation, but pursuing it closely, in language  
pure, classical and copious, soothing always  
the feelings ot his adversaries by civilities  
and softness of expression he rose to the  
eminent station which he held in the great  
National Convention of 1787, and in that  
of Virginia which followed, he sustained the  
new Constitution in all its parts, bearing  
off the palm against the logic of Geo. Mason,  
and the fervid declamation of Mr. Henry.  
With these consummate powers,were united  
a pure and spotless virtue, which no calum  
ny has ever attempted to sully. On the  
nntrpre anA nrvltW rf hi npn. nnd thf  
wisdom of his administration in the highest  
office of the nation, ijneed say nothing.

January 6,1821.  
At the age of 77, I began to make tome  
memoranda, and state some recollections ol  
dates and facts concerning myself, for my own  
more ready reference, and for the information  
of my family.  
The tradition of my father’s family was,  
that their ancestors came to this country from  
Wales, and from near the mountain of Snow­  
den, the highest in Great Britain. I noted  
ones a case from Wales, in the law reports,  
where a person of our name was either  
plaintiff or defendant; and one of the same  
name was secretary to the Virginia Company.  
These are the only instances in which I have  
met with the name in that country. I have  
found it in our early records; but the first  
particular information I have of any ancestor  
WMof my grandfather, who lived at the place  
£ Cbesterfleld called Osborne’s, and owned  
the lands afterwards the glebe of the parish.  
■&lt;&gt;«■ • Thomas, who died  
young, Field, who settled on the waters of  
the Roanoke, and left several descendants,  
*nd. Vte,r&lt; my father, who settled on the  
lands I still own, called Shad well, adjoining  
my present residence. He was born, Feb.  
t», 1707-8, and intermarried 1780, with Jane  
Randolph, of the age of 17, daughter of Ish­  
am Randolph, one of the seven sons of that  
name and family settled at Oungeroess in  
Goochland. They trace .their pedigree far  
back in England and Scotland, to which let

V* Worth Carolina, which  
??&#x27;• BJ&quot;t * ami was after­  
  
ever bmm made, that of Captain Smith being  
merely a conjectural sketch. They poseess- &lt;  
ed excellent materials for so much of the i  
country as is below the blue ridge $ little be- I  
ing then known beyond that ridge. He was &lt;  
the third or fourth settler, about the year &lt;  
1787, of the part of the country in which 1 &lt;  
lire t he died August 17th, 1787, leaving my  
mother a widow, who lived to 1776 with six  
daughters end two eons, myself the elder;  
To my young brother he left hit estate on  
James river, called Snowden, after the suppo­  
sed birth-place of the family ; to myself, the  
lands on which I was born and live. He  
placed me at the English school at five years &#x27;  
of age, and the Latin at nine, where I contin­  
ued until his death.  
My teacher, Mr. Douglas, a clergyman  
from Scotland, with the rudiments of the  
Latin and Greek language, taught me the  
French, and on the death of my father, I went  
to the Rev. Mr. Murry, a correct classical  
scholar, with whom I continued two years;  
and then, to wit, in the spring of 1760, went  
to William and Mary College, where I contin­  
ued two years. It was my great good for­  
tune, and what probably fixed the destinies  
of my life, that Dr. William Small, of Scet­  
land, was then professor of Mathematics, a  
man profound in most of the usefol branches  
of science, with a happy talent of communi­  
cation, correct and gentlemanly manners and  
an enlarged and liberal mind. He, most hap­  
pily forme, became soon attached to me, and  
made me his daily companion when not enga­  
ged in school; and from his conversation I  
got my first views of the expansion of sci­  
ence, and of the system of things in which I  
am placed. Fortunately, the philosophical  
chair became vacant soon after my arrival nt  
College, and ho was appointed to fill it per in­  
terim; and he was the first who ever gave in  
that College, regular lectures in ethics, rheto­  
ric, and holies lettres. He returned to Eu­  
ropo in 1762, having previously tilled up the  
measure of his goodness to mu, hy procuring  
for me from his most intimate friend, George  
Wythe, a reception as a student at law, under  
his direction, and introduced me to the nc-1  
quaintance and familiar table of Governor i  
Fauquier, the ablest man who lind|ever filled j  
that office. With him and at his table, Dr. j  
Small and Mr. Wythe, his amici omnium ho- I  
rarum, Hnd myself, formed a partie quarree,  
and to tho habitual conversations on tlieso  
occasions I owed much instruction. Mr.  
Wythe continued to be my fnithfol and belov­  
ed Mentor in youth, and my most affectionate  
friend through life. In 1707, ho led me into  
the practise of the law at the bar of tho Gen­  
eral Court, at which I continued until the  
Revolution shut up tho Courts of Justice.”

from Waletyaad frota near the mountain  
of Snowden the highest in Great Britain.  
I noted once a case from Walea, in the

was plaintiff or defendant : and one of tbe  
s.me name was Secretary to the Virginia  
Company. These are the only instances  
in which I have met with the name in  
that country. 1 have found it in our early  
records ; but the first particular infor­  
mation 1 have of any ancestor, was of my  
grandfather, who lived at the place &#x27;in  
ChesteiGf Id called Osborne&#x27;s, and owned  
the lands afterwards the glebe of the par­  
ish. He had three sons: Thomss, who  
died voung, Field, whoteltkd on the wa­

scendants, and Ptter, my father, who et-j

neglected ; but being of a strong mind,  
sou&#x27;tifTjnd jTnmi!trr e&amp;T-ftsr&#x27;mfori  
tion, he read much and imptoird him­  
self, insomuch that he was chosen with  
Joshua Fry, Professor of Mathematics in

boundary line betweeji Virginia and Notth

They laid their shoulders to the

errs in too much talking, how can  
it be otherwise, in a body to which

ty. Our plan, I believe, best combines wisdom and practicability, by provid-  
ing a plurality of Counsellors, but a single Arbiter for ultimate decision. 1 was  
in France when we heard of the schism, and separation of our committee, and,  
speaking with Dr. Franklin of this singular disposition of men to quarrel, and  
divide into parties, he gave his sentiments as usual, by way of apologue. He  
mentioned the Eddystone light-house, in the British channel, as being built on  
a rock, in the mid-channel, totally inaccessible in winter, from the boisterous  
character of that sea, in that season ; that, therefore, for the two keepers employ-  
ed to keep up the lights, all provisions for the winter, were necessarily carried  
to them in autumn, as they could never be visited again till the return of the mild.  
er season ; that, on the first practicable day in the spring, a boat put off to them  
with fresh supplies. The boatmen met at the door one of the keepers, and ac-  
costed him with a ‘how goes it friend ? ‘very well.’ ‘How is your companion ?”  
‘I do not know.’ ‘Don’t know? Is not he here? ‘I can’t tell.’ ‘Have not  
you seen him to-day ?? No.’ ‘When did you see him? ‘Not since last fall.”  
* You have killed him ? ‘Not I, indeed.’ They were about to lay hold of him,  
as having certainly murdered his companion ; but he desired them to go up  
stairs and examine for themselves. They went up, and there found the other  
keeper. They had quarrelled, it seems, soon after being left there, had divided  
into two parties, assigned the cares below to one, and those above to the other,  
and had never spoken to or seen one another since.”

**Mr. Madison came into the House in 1776, a new member and young;  
which circumstances, concurring with his extreme modesty, prevented his ven-  
turing himself in debate before his removal to the Council of State, in Novem-  
ber ’77. From thence he went to Congress, then consisting of few members.  
Trained in these successive schools, he acquired a habit of self-possession,  
which placed at ready command the rich resources of his luminous and discrimi-  
nating mind, and of his extensive information, and rendered him the first of every  
assembly afterwards, of which he became a member. Never wandering from  
his subject into vain declamation, but pursuing it closely, in language pure,  
classical, and copious ; soothing always the feelings of his adversaries, by civili-  
ties and softness of expression, he rose to the eminent station which he held in  
the great National Convention of 1787 ; and in that of Virginia, which follow-  
ed, he sustained the new constitution in all its parts, bearing off the palm  
against the logic of George Mason, and the fervid declamation of Mr. Henry.  
With these consummate powers, were united a pure and spotless virtue, which  
no calumny has ever attempted to sully. Of the powers and polish of his pen,  
and of the wisdom of his administration in the highest office of the nation, I  
need say nothing. They have spoken, and will forever speak for themselves.”

won, as proved to be the case, if as much ever was@*fterwards  
won, at sacrifices dreadful beyond calculation. The following  
anecdote is a striking instance of the interest taken in Mr. Jef-  
ferson’s opinions, to which we have alluded.  
  
“*I received one morning,” he says, “a note from the Marquis de la Fayette,  
informing me, that he should bring a party of six or eight friends, to ask a din-  
ner of me the next day. I assured him of their weleome. When they arrived,  
they were La Fayette himself, Duport, Barnave, Alexander Lameth, Blacon,  
Mounier, Maubourg, and Dagout. These were leading patriots, of honest but  
differing opinions, sensible of the necessity of effecting a coalition by mutual  
sacrifices, knowing each other, and not afraid, therefore, to unbosom themselves  
mutually. This last was a material principle in the selection. With this view,  
the Marquis had invited the conference, and had fixed the time and place inad-  
vertently, as to the embarrassment under which it might place me. The cloth  
being removed, and wine set on the table, after the American manner, the Mar-  
quis introduced the objects of the conference, by summarily reminding them of  
the state of things in the Assembly, the course which the principles of the Con-  
stitution were taking, and the inevitable result, unless checked by more concord  
among the patriots themselves. He observed, that although he also had his  
opinion, he was ready to sacrifice it to that of his brethren of the same cause ;  
but that a common opinion must now be formed, or the aristocracy would carry  
every thing, and that, whatever they should now agree on, he, at the head of the  
National force, would maintain. The discussions began at the hour of four, and  
were continued till ten o’clock in the evening ; during which time, I was a si-  
lent witness to a coolness and candour of argument, unusual in the conflicts of  
political opinion ; to a logical reasoning, and chaste eloquence, disfigured by no  
gaudy tinsel of rhetoric or declamation, and truly worthy of being placed in pa

Plato and Cicero. But duties of exculpation were now incumbent onme. I wait-  
ed on Count Montmorin the next morning, and explained to him, with truth  
and candour, how it had happened that my house had been made the scene of  
conferences of such a character. He told me, he already knew every thing  
which had passed; that so far from taking umbrage at the use made of my house  
on that occasion, he earnestly wished I would habitually assist at such confer-  
ences, being sure I should be useful in moderating the warmer spirits, and pro-  
moting a wholesome and practicable reformation only. I told him, I knew too  
well the duties I owed to the King, to the nation, and to my own country, to  
take any part in councils concerning their internal government, and that I should  
persevere, with care, in the character of a neutral and passive spectator, with  
wishes only, and very sincere ones, that those measures might prevail which  
would be for the greatest good of the nation. I have no doubt, indeed, that this  
conference was previously known and approved by this honest minister, who  
was in confidence and communication with the patriots, and wished for a reason-  
able reform of the Constitution.”

and it must be placed among that vast collection of contradictions  
of which all history is made up.  
  
“Louis XVI. had a Queen of absolute sway over his weak mind, and timid  
virtue, and of a character, the reverse of his in all points. This angel, as gaudi-  
ly painted in the rhapsodies of Burke, with some smartness of fancy, but no  
sound sense, was proud, disdainful of restraint, indignant at all obstacles to her  
will, eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and firm enough to hold to her desires, or  
petish in their wreck. Hef inordinate gambling and dissipations, with those of  
the Count d’Artois, and others of her clique, had been a sensible item in the ex-  
haustion of the treasury, which called into action the reforming hand of the na-  
tion ; and her opposition to it, her inflexible perverseness, and dauntless spirit,  
led herself to the guillotine, drew the king on with her, and plunged the world  
into crimes and calamities which will for ever stain the pages of modern history.  
I have ever believed, that had there been no Queen, there would have been no  
revolution. No force would have been provoked, nor exercised. The King  
would have gone hand in hand with the wisdom of his sounder counsellors,  
who, guided by the increased lights of the age, wished only, with the same  
pace, to advance the principles of their social constitution. The deed which  
closed the mortal course of these sovereigns, I shall neither approve nor con-  
demn. I am not prepared to say, that the first magistrate of a nation cannot  
commit treason against his country, or is unamenable to its punishment : nor  
yet, that where there is no written law, no regulated tribunal, there is not a  
Jaw in our hearts, and a power in our hands, given for righteous employment in  
maintaining right, and redressing wrong. Of those who judged the King, many  
thought him wilfully criminal ; many, that his existence would keep the nation  
in perpetual conflict with the horde of Kings, who would war against a regene-  
ration which might come home to themselves, and that it were better that one  
should die than all. I should not have voted with this portion of the legislature.  
T should have shut up the Queen in a convent, putting harm out of her power,  
and placed the King in his station, investing him with limited powers, which, I  
verily believe, he would have honestly exercised, according to the measure of  
his understanding. In this way, no void would have been created, courting the  
usurpation of a military adventurer, nor occasion given for those enormities  
which demoralized the nations of the world, and destroyed, and is yet to destroy  
millions and millions of its inhabitants. ‘There are three epochs in history, sig-  
nalized by the total extinction of national morality. The first was of the succes-  
sors of Alexander, not omitting himself: The next, the successors of the first  
Ceasar: The third, our own age. This was begun by the partition of Poland,  
followed by that of the treaty of Pilnitz ; next the conflagration of Copenhagen ;  
then the enormities of Bonaparte, partitioning the earth at his will, and devas-  
tating it with fire and sword; now the conspiracy of Kings, the successors of  
Bonaparte, blasphemously calling themselves the Holy Alliance, and treading in

her desires, or |K‘rish in their W&#x27;reck. Her inordinate gambling and  
dissipations, w’lth those of the Count d’Artois, and others of her  
c/h/Mc, had lieen a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury,  
which called into action the reforming hand of the nation; and her  
opposition to it, her indexible perverseness, and dauntli^ spirit, led  
herself to the guilhitinc, drew the king on w&#x27;ith her, and plunged the  
world into crimes and Ciilamities w&#x27;hich will for ever stain the pages of

there would have Ihh&#x27;.ii no revolution. No force would have been pro¬  
voked nor exercised. The king would have gone hand in hand w&#x27;ith

for rightetuis employment in maintaining right and redressing wrong.  
Of those who judged the king, many thought him wilfully criminal;

fortunate event of the same nature.  
  
* The King was now become a passive machine  
in the hands of the National Assembly, and had he  
been left to himself, he would have willingly acqui-  
esced in whatever they should devise as best for the  
nation. A wise constitution would have been formed,  
hereditary in his line, himself placed at ‘its head,  
with powers so large, as to enable him to do all the  
good of his station, and so limited, as to restrain him  
  
rom its abuse. This he would have faithfully ad-  
ministered, and more than this I do not believe he  
ever wished. But he had a Queen of absolute sway  
over his weak mind and timid virtue, and of a cha-  
racter the reverse of his in all points. This angel,  
as gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke, with  
some smartness of fancy, but no sound sense, was  
proud, disdainful of restraint, indignant at all obsta-  
cles to her will, eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and  
firm enough to hold to her desires, or perish in their  
wreck. Her inordinate gambling pod dissipations,  
with those of the Count d’Artois, and others of her  
clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion  
of the treasury, which called into action the reform-  
ing hand of the nation; and her opposition to it,  
her inflexible perverseness and dauntless spirit, led  
herself to the guillotine, drew the King on with her,  
and plunged the world into crimes and calamities  
which will for ever stain the s of modern his-  
tory. I have ever believed, that had there been no  
Queen, there would have been no revolution. No  
force would have been provoked, nor exercised. The  
King would have gone hand in hand with the wis-  
dom of his sounder counsellors, who, guided by the  
increased lights of the age, wished only, with the  
same pace, to advance the principles of their social  
constitution. The deed which closed the mortal  
course of these sovereigns, I shall neither approve  
nor condemn. I am not prepared to say, that the  
first magistrate of a nation cannot commit treason  
against his country, or is unamenable to its punish-  
ment: nor yet, that where there is no written law,  
no regulated tribunal, there is not a law in our  
hearts, and a power in our hands, given for right-  
eous employment in maintaining right, and redress-  
ing wrong. Of those who judged the King, many  
thought him wilfully criminal; many, that his ex-  
istence would keep the nation in perpetual conflict  
with the horde of kings, who would war against a  
regeneration which might come home to them-  
selves, and that it were better that one should die  
than all. I should not have voted with this portion of  
the legislature. I should have shut up the Queenina  
convent, putting harm out of her power, and placed  
the King in his station, investing him with limited  
wers, which, I verily believe, he would have  
onestly exercised, according to the measure of his  
understanding. In this way, no void would have  
been created, courting the usurpation of a military  
adventurer, nor occasion given for those enormities  
which demoralized the nations of the world, and  
destroyed, and is yet to destroy, millions and mil-  
lions of its inhabitants. There are three epochs in  
history, signalized by the total extinction of national  
morality. The first was of the successors of Alex-  
ander, not omitting himself. The next, the succes-  
sors of the first Cesar. The third, our own age.  
This was begun by the — of Poland, followed  
byjthat of the treaty of Pilnitz ; next, the conflagra-  
tion of Copenhagen ; then the enormities of Bona-  
parte, partitioning the earth at his will, and devas-  
tating it with fire and sword; now the conspiracy  
of Kings, the successors of Bonaparte, blasphemously  
calling themselves the Holy Alliance, and treading  
in the footsteps of their incarcerated leader; not  
yet, indeed, usurping the government of other na-

&quot; The King was now become a passive ma­  
chine in the hands of the National Assembly;  
and, had he been left to himself, he would have  
willingly acquiesced in whatever they should de­  
vise as best for the nation. A wise constitution  
would have been formed, hereditary in his line,  
himself placed at its head, with powers so large  
os to enable him to do all the good of his sta­  
tion, and so limited as to restrain him from its  
abuses. This he would have faithfully adminis­  
tered, and more than this I do not believe he  
ever wished. But he had a Queen of absolute  
sway over his weak mind and timid virtue, and  
of a character the reverse of his in all points.  
This angel, so gaudily painted in the . rhapso­  
dies of Burke, with some smartness of fancy but  
no sound sense, was proud, disdainful of re  
straint, indignant at all obstacles to her will,  
eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and firm enough  
to hold to her desires, or perish in their wreck.  
Her inordinate gambling and dissipations, with  
those of thef -Count d&#x27;Artois and others of her  
clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaus  
tion of the treasury which called into action the  
reforming hand of the nation; and her opposi  
tion to it, her inflexible perverseness and daunt  
less spirit, led herself to tho guillotine, drew the  
King on with hei, und plunged tho world into  
crimes and calamities which will for ever stain  
the pages of modern history. I have ever be  
lieved, that had there been no Queen, there would  
have been no revolution. No&#x27; force would have  
been provoked nor exercised. The King would  
have gone hand in hand with the wisdom of his  
sounder counsellors, who, guided by the in  
creased lights of the age, wished only, with the  
same pace, to advance the principles of their  
social constitution. The deed which closed the  
mortal course of these sovereigns, I shall neither  
approve nor condemn. I am not prepared to  
aay that the first magistrate of a nation cannot  
commit treason against his country or is una­  
menable to its punishment; nor vet that, where  
there is no written law, no regulated tribunal,  
there is not a law in our hearts, and a power in  
our hands, given for righteous employment in  
maintaining right and redressing wrong. Of  
those who judged the King many thought him  
wilfully criminal; many, that his existence would  
keep the nation in perpetual conflict with the  
horde of Kings, who would war against a re  
generation which might come home to them­  
selves ; and that it were better that one should  
die than all. I should not have voted with this  
portion of the Legislature. I should have shut  
up the Queen in a convent, putting harm out of  
her power, and placed the King in his station,  
investing him with limited powers, which, I ve  
rily believe, he would have honestly exercised ac­  
cording to the measure of his understanding. In  
this way no void would have been created, court  
ing the usurpation of a military adventurer, nor  
occasion given for those enormities whicli de  
moralized the nations of the world, and destroy­  
ed, and is yet to destroy, millions and millions  
of its inhabitants. There are three epochs in  
history signalized by the total extinction of na  
tural morality. I he (irst was of the succqssori  
of Alexander, not omitting himself. The next,  
the successors, of the first Ca;sar. The third,  
our own age. This was begun by the partition  
of Poland, followed by that of the treaty of Pil-  
rAz: next, the conflagration of l,openlin:en  
tjien t,3 enormities of Bonaparte, partitioning  
tho earth at his will, and devastating it with fire  
and sword; now tho fonspiracy of Kings, the  
successors of Bonaparte, biahcmously calling  
themselves the Holy Alliance, arid treading in  
the footsteps of their incarcerated lnanto.r n0&#x27;  
yet, indeed, usurping the govrrnment of oth.r  
nations avowedly and in detail, but controlling,  
by their armies, the forms in whicli they will  
permit them to be governed ; and reserving, in  
petto, the order and extent of the usurpation  
further meditated.

“ We were under conviction of the ne-  
cessity of arousing our people from the  
lethargy into which they had fallen, as to  
passing events; and thought that the ap-  
pointment of a day of general ape and  
prayer, would be most likely to call up  
and alarm their attention. No example  
of such a solemnity had existed since the  
days of our distresses in the war of ’55,  
since which a new generation had grown  
up. With the help, therefore, of Rush-  
worth, whom we rummaged over for the  
revolutionary precedents and forms of  
the Puritans of that day, preserved by  
him, we cooked up a resolution, some-  
what modernizing their phrases, for ap-  
pointing the Ist day of June, on which  
the port bill was to commence, for a day  
of fasting, humiliation and prayer, to im-  
plore Heaven to avert from us the evils  
of civil war, to inspire us with firmness  
in support of our rights, and to turn the  
hearts of the King and Parliament to mo-  
deration and justice. To give greater  
emphasis to our proposition, we agreed  
to wait the next morning on Mr. Nicholas,  
whose grave and religious character was  
more in unison with the tone of our re-  
solution, and to solicit him to move it.  
We accordingly went to him in the morn-  
ing. He moved it the same day: the 1st  
of June was proposed; and it passed  
without opposition

first views of the expansion of science, and of the system of things in  
which we are placed. Fortunately, the philosophical chair became

bled immediately at the Raleigh, then, as we believe wt still is,  
the principal tavern in Wilhamsburg, and proposed a conven-  
tion for Virginia, and tothe other colouies, an annual Congress.  
On his return home, Mr. Jefferson prepared a draft of instrue-  
tions for the deputies trom Virginia, in which he took the bold  
ground, that the relation between Great-Britain and her colonies  
‘was exactly the same as that of England and Scotland, after  
the accession of James, and until the Union; and the same as her  
present relations with Hanover; having ihe same executive  
chief, but no other political connexion.” But in this doctrine,  
he remarks, [ had been able to get no one to agree with me but  
Mr. Wythe. ‘ Our other patriots, Randolph, the Lees, Nicho-  
las, and Pendleton, stopped at the half way house of John Dick-  
inson, Who admitted that England had a rizht to regulate our  
commerce, and to lay duties on it for the purpose of regulation,  
hut not of raising revenue.”

duplicates of the mstructions he had prepared, to Mr. Henry,  
and Peyton Randolph the presumed chairman. Aud, al.hough  
they were not adopted, ‘as being too bold for the present state  
of things,” they were printed in the form of a pamphlet, under  
the title of “ asummary view of the rights of British America.”  
This pamphlet was reprinted in England, with some interpola-  
tions by Edmund Burke, ran through several editions, and pro-  
cured for the author, as he thinks, the honour of having his name  
inserted, with about twenty other Americans, in a bill of attain-  
der, which he learnt was introduced into Parliament, but “sup-  
pressed in embryo by the hasty step of events.” A copy of  
these instructions is inserted in the appendix. It is a cogent  
piece of reasoning, expressed in clear and forcible language, and  
resting on the same liberal principles as would be assumed at  
the present day.

** As the law of descents, [says Mr. Jefferson,] and the criminal law  
fell of course within my portion, | wished the committee to settle the  
leading principles of these, as a guide for me in framing them ; and,  
with respect to the first, | proposed to abolish the law of primogeniture,  
and to make real estate descend in parcenary to the next of kin, as  
personal property does, by the statute of distributions. Mr. Pendleton  
wished to preserve the right of primogeniture, but seeing at once that  
that could not prevail, he proposed we should adopt the Hebrew princi-

eldest son could eat twice as much, or do double work, it might be a  
natural evidence of his right to a double portion ; but being on a par in

“ The first question [says he.] was, whether we should propose te  
abolish the whole existing system of laws. and prepare a new and com-  
plete Institute, or preserve the general system, and only modify it to  
the present state of things. Mr. Pendleton, contrary to his usual dis-  
position in favor of ancient things was for the former proposition, in  
which he was joined by Mr. Lee. To this it was objected, that to ab-  
rogate our whole system would be a bold measure, and probably far be-  
yond the views of the Legislature ; that they had been in the practice  
of revising, from time to time, the laws of the Colony, omitting the ex-  
pired, the repealed, and the obsolete, amending only those retained, and  
probably meant, we should now do the same, only including the British  
statutes as well as our own: that to compose a new Institute, like those  
of Justinian and Bracton, or that of Blackstone, which was the model  
proposed by Mr. Pendleton, would be an arduous undertaking, of vast  
research, of great consideration and judgment ; and when reduced to a  
text. every word of that text, from the imperfection of human language,  
and its incompetence to express distinctly every shade of idea, would be-  
come a subject of question and chicanery, until settled by repeated adju-  
dications ; that this would involve us for ages in litigation, and render  
property uncertain, until, like the statutes of old, every word had been  
tried and settled by numerous decisions, and by new volumes of reports  
and commentaries; and that not one of us, would probably undertake such  
a work, which to be systematical, must be the work of one hand. This  
last was the opinion of Mr. Wythe, Mr. Mason, and myself.”

“Here I discontinue my relation of the French Revolution. The  
minuteness with which I have so far given its details, is disproportioned  
to the general scale of my narrative, but I have thought it justified by  
the interest which the whole world must take in the Revolution. As  
yet, we are but in the first chapter of its history. The appeal to the  
rights of man, which had been made in the United States, was taken  
up by France, first of the European nations. From her, the spirit has  
spread over those of the South. The Tyrants of the North have allied,  
indeed, against it ; but it is irresistible. Their opposition will only mul-  
tiply its millions of human victims; their own satellites will catch it,  
and the condition of man through the civilized world, will be finally  
and greatly ameliorated. This is a wonderful instance of great events,  
from small causes. So inscrutable is the arrangement of causes and  
consequences in this world, that a two-penny duty on tea, unjustly im-  
posed in a sequestered part of it, changes the condition of all its inhab-  
itants. I have been more minute in relating the early transactions of  
this regeneration, because I was in circumstances peculiarly favourable  
for a knowledge of the truth. Possessing the confidence and intimacy

head and Atlas, who had no secrets from me, I learned with correct-  
ness the views and proceedings of that party ; while my intercourse  
with the diplomatic missionaries of Europe at Paris, all of them with  
the court, and eager in prying into its councils and proceedings, gave  
me a knowledge of these also. My information was always, and im-  
mediately committed to writing, in letters to Mr. Jay, and often to my

member of the Convention, which met in Philadelphia in Septem.  
ber of the same year, in which capacity he undertook to prepare some  
documents for public use. The limited ambition of the American at  
the time, cannot be better described than they are in the following  
extract from the imperfect memoir which Jefferson has left us.  
  
‘ In this I took the ground that, frown the beginning, I had thought the  
only one orthodox or tenable, which was, that the relation between Great  
Britain and these colonies was exactly the same as that of England and  
Scotland, after the accession of James and until the Union, and the same  
as her present relations with Hanover, having the same executive chief,  
but no other necessary political connection; and that our emigration from  
England to this country gave her no more right over us, than the emigra-  
tions of the Danes and Saxons gave to the present authorities of the mother  
country, over England. In this doctrine, however, I had never been able  
to get any one to agree with me but Mr. Wythe.’—p. 7.

_* But he had a Queen of absolute sway over his weak mind and timid  
virtue, and of a character the reverse of his in all points. This angel, as  
gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke, with some smartness of fancy,  
but no sound sense, was proud, disdainful of restraint, indignant at all  
obstacles to her will, eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and firm enough to  
hold to her desires, or perish in their wreck. Her inordinate gambling  
and dissipations, with those of the Count d’Artois, and others of  
her clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury,  
which called into action the reforming hand of the nation ; and her oppo-

crimes and calamities which will for ever stain the pages of modern history.  
I have ever believed, that had there been no Queen, there would have been  
no revolution. No force would have been provoked, or exercised. The  
King would have gone hand in hand with the wisdom of his sounder coun.  
sellors, who, guided by the increased lights of the age, wished only, with  
the same pace, to advance the principles of their social constitution. The  
deed which closed the mortal course of these sovereigns, I shall neither  
approve nor condemn. I am not prepared to say, that the first magistrate  
of a nation cannot commit treason against his country, or is unamenable  
to its punishment: nor yet, that where there is no written law, no regulated  
tribunal, there is not a law in our hearts, and a power in our hands, given  
for righteous employment in maintaining right, and redressing wrong. Of  
those who judged the King, many thought him wilfully criminal ; many,  
that his existence would keep the nation in perpetual conflict with the  
horde of kings, who would war against a regeneration which might come  
home to themselves, and that it were better that one should die than all. |  
should not have voted with this portion of the legislature. I should have  
shut up the Queen in a convent, putting harm out of her power, and  
placed the King in his station, investing him with limited powers, which, |  
verily believe he would have honestly excercised, according to the measure  
of his understanding.’—vol, i. pp. 86, 87.

custom, an apologue:—  
  
‘““He mentioned the Eddystone light-

built on a rock, in the mid-channel, total-  
ly, inaccessible in winter, from the bois-  
terous character of that sea, in that sea-

employed to keep up the lights, provisions  
for the winter were necessarily carried to  
them in autumn, as they could never be  
visited again till the return of the milder  
season; that, on the first practicable day  
in the spring, a boat put off to them with  
fresh supplies: The boatmen met at the  
door one of the keepers, and accosted  
him with.a ‘ How eons it, friend ?—~ Very

to lay hold of him, as having certainly mur-

They went up, and there found the other

unparalleled; and the hospitality of Paris is beyond any  
thing I had conceived to be practicable in a large city,  
Their eminence, too, in science, the communicative dispo.  
sitions of their scientific men, the politeness of the general’  
manners, the ease and vivacity of their conversation, give  
a charm to their society to be found nowhere else. Ina  
comparison of this with other countries, we have the proof  
of primacy which was given to Themistocles after the  
battle of Salamis. Every General voted to, himself the  
first reward of valour, and the second to Themistocles,  
So, ask the travelled inhabitant of any nation,—‘«In

Coneress at body was lit-  
tle Tumerous, but very contentious. Day after  
day was wasted on the most unimportant ques-  
tions. A member, one of those afflicted with  
the morbid rage of debate, of an ardent mind,  
prompt imagination, and copious flow of words,  
who heard with impatience any logic which was  
not his own, sitting near me on some occasion  
of trifling debate, asked me how I could sit in  
sileoce, hearing so much false reasoning, which  
a word should refiite? I observed to him, that  
to refute indeed was easy, but to silence impos-  
sible ; that in measures brought forward by my-  
self, | took the laboring oar, as was incumbent  
on me; but in general, I was willing to listen;  
that if every sound argument or objection was  
used by some one or other of the numerous d¢-  
baters, it was enough: If not, 1 thought it suffi-  
cient to suggest the omission, without going  
into a repetition of what had been already said  
by others; that this was a waste to the House,  
which could not be justified. And I believe,  
that if the members of deliberate bodies were  
to observe this course generally, they would do  
in a day, what takes them a week ; and its real-  
ly more questionable, than may at first be  
thought, whether Kuonaparte’s dumb legisla-  
ture, which said nothing, and did less, may not  
| be preferable to one which talks much, and  
does nothing. I served with General Wash-  
ington in the legislature of Virginia, before the  
revolution, and during it, with Dr. Franklin in  
Congress. I never heard cither of them speak  
| ten minutes at a time, nor to any but the main  
  
point, which was to decide the question, They  
laid their shoulders to the great points, knowing  
that the little ones would follow of themselves.  
If the present Congress errs in too much talking,  
how can it be otherwise, in a body to which the  
people send one hundred and fifty lawyers,  
whose trade it is, to question every thing, yield  
nothing, and talk by the hour? That one hun-  
dred and fifty lawyers should do business to-  
gether, ought not to be expected.—Jefferson’s

“In this I took the ground that, from the  
  
beginning, I had theught the only one ortho-  
dox or tenable, which was, that the relation  
between Great Britain and these colonies was  
exactly the same as that of England and Seot-  
land, after the accession of James and until  
the Union, and the same as her present rela-  
tions with Hanover, having the same execu-  
tive chief, but no other necessary political  
connexion; and that our emigration from Eng-  
land to this country gave her no more right  
over us, than the emigrations of the Danes  
and Saxons gave to the present authorities of  
the mother country, over England. In this  
doctrine, however, I had never been able to  
get any one to agree with me but Mr. Wythe.

the rights of man, which had been made in the United States, was  
taken up by France, first of the European nations. From her the  
spirit has spread over those of the South. The tyrants of the North  
have allied indeed against it, but it is irresistible. Their opposition  
will only multiply its millions of human victims ; their own satellites  
will catch it, and the condition of man through the civilized world,  
will be finally and greatly ameliorated. This is a wonderful instance  
of great events from small causes. So inscrutable is the arrangement

return to Paris. Much as the cessation of his invaluable  
testimony to the progressive events of the French Revolution is

## WISDOM IN DEBATE...Mr. Jefferson, in speaking of the proceedings of the Congress met at Annapolis in the year 1789, When the definitive Treaty of Peace which had been signed at Paris had just been received, and could not be ratified until nine States were represented, (Sever only being then present) complains of the contentiousness of debate in that small body

fute was indeed easy, but to silence im­  
possible ; that in measures brought for­  
ward by himself, he felt it incumbent on  
  
him to take the labouring oar ; but that,  
in general, he was willing to listen. 1:&#x27;,

tion, is&#x27; brought forward by some one of  
the numerous debaters on a question .it is  
sufficient 5 if not, he thought it sufficient  
to suggest the omission, without going  
into a repetition of what had been said  
by others, which would be a Wiste aitf

on had indeed pone further, nnd having  
formally expressed the opinion that a President  
oupht not to bo rc-eligihic after a single term, may  
seem at first to afford n strong precedent for Gen.  
Jackson. But what was that precise opinion, and  
when was it expressed? llis opinion, as expressed  
at Inc formation of the Constitution, was, that the  
t resident should ho elected in the first instance for  
seven yoa^s, and that he should he ineligible after­  
wards. I ho following are his words, as onoted  
from h.s memoirs (page 64.) -The re-eligibility of  
the President for fife, I (,uit0 disapproved’’-—“* *  
my fears of that feature were foundod on the iin­  
porta nee of the office, on the fierce contentions it  
might, excite among onrselvos, if eontinuable for  
I&#x27;Jc, and the dangers of interference, cither with  
money or arms by foreign nations, to whom the  
choice of an American President might become  
very interesting. Examples of this abounded in  
his ory, m the case of the Roman Emperors, for  
of C °f lh* PoJ”&quot;’ any significance;  
of the f.ormnn Emperors; the Kings of Pohnd, nod  
the Dcys of Barbary. I had observed, too, in the  
feudal history, and in the recent instance particu­  
larly of the Stadholdor of Holland, how easily off,  
ccs or tenures for life, slide into inheritance*. Mv  
w&gt;sh, therefore, was, that the President should be  
elected for seven years, and he ineligible afterwards.  
, h,s lorm 1 bought sufficient to enable him, with  
the concurrence of the legislature, to *arry through  
ind establish any system of improvement he should  
propose for the general good. But the practice a­  
p.tcd I flunk is better, allowing his continnance  
ror eight years, with a liability to he dropped at  
li»If way of the term, making that a period of pro­  
nation. 1

&quot; Our body was little numerous, but very  
con-tentious,&quot; says Mr. Jefferson. &quot; Day  
after day was wasted on the most  
unimportant questions. A membc-r, one of  
those afflicted with the morbid rage of  
debate, of an ardent mind, prompt indig-  
nation, and copious flow of words, who  
heard with impatience any logic that was  
not his own, sitting near me on some  
occasion of a trifling but wordy debate,  
asked me how I could sit in silence,  
hearing so much false reasoning which a  
word would re&#x27;futo. I observed to him  
that to refute indeed was easy, but to  
silence impossible ; that in measures  
brought forward by myself I took the  
labouring oar, as was incumbent on me,  
but that in general I was willing to  
listen ; that if every sound argu-ment  
or objection was used by some one or  
other of the numerous debaters it was  
enough ; if not, I thought it sufficient  
to suggest the omission, without going  
into a repetition of what had been  
already said by others ; that this was a  
waste and abuse of the time and patience  
of the house, which could not be  
justified ; and I believe, that if the  
members of deliberative bodies were to  
observe tin» course generally, they  
would do in a day what takes them a  
week. * . » I served with Gene-ral  
Washington in the Legislature of  
Virginia before the revolution, and  
during it with Dr. Franklin in Congress.  
I never heard either of them speak ten  
minutes at a time, nor to any but the  
main point which was to decide the  
question. They laid their shoulders to  
the great points, know-ing that the  
little ones would follow of themselves,  
If the present Congress errs in too much  
talking, how can it be otherwise in a  
body to which the people send 150  
lawyers, whose trade is to question

&quot;Our body was little numerous, but very  
oontentious,&quot; says Mr. Jefferson, &quot; Day  
after day was waited on the most  
unimportant questions. A member, one of  
those afflicted with the morbid rage of  
debate, of an ardent mind,, prompt  
indignation, and copious flow of words,  
who beard with impa-tience any logio  
that was not his own, sitting near me on  
some occasion ofjá trifling but wordr  
debate, asked mo how I could sit in  
silence, bearing so much false reasoning  
witch a word would refute. 1 observed to  
bim that to refute indeed was easy, but  
to silence impossible ; that in measures  
brought forward by myself I took the  
labouring oar, as was incumbent on me,  
but that in general I was willing to  
listen ; that if every sound argument or  
objection was used by some one or other  
of the numerous de-baters it was enough  
; if not, I thought it sufficient to  
suggest the omission, without going into  
a repe-tition of what had been already  
said by others ; (bat this was a waste  
and abuse of the time and patienee of  
the house, which could, not be justified  
; and I believe, that if the members of  
deliberativo bodies were to observe  
this, course generally, they would do in  
a day what takes them a week. . » . » I  
served with General Washington in the  
legislature of Virginia before the  
revolution, and during it with Dr.  
Franklin, in Congress. I never heard  
.ither of them speuk ton minutes at a  
time, nor to any but the main point  
which was to decide the question. They  
laid their shoulders to the great  
points, knowing that the little ones  
would follow of therasejves. If  
the.present Congress orrs in too much  
talking, how oan it be otherwise in a  
body to which the people send 150  
lawyers, whose trade is to qu-atinn  
everything, yield nothing, and talk by

within its local bounds; each county

“The bill on the subject of slaves, was a mere digest of the existing laws respecting  
* them, without any iatimation of a plan for a future and general emancipation. It was  
‘ thought better that this should be kept back, and attempted only by way of amendment,  
* whenever the bill should be brought on. The principles of tle amendment, however,  
* were agreed on, that is to say, the freedom of all born after a certain day, and DEPORTA-  
‘ TION ata proper age. But it was found thatthe public mind would not yet bear the proposi-  
‘ tion, nor will it bear it even at this day. Yet the day is not distant when it must bear  
* and adopt it, or worse will follow. Nothing is more certainly written in the book of  
‘ fate, than that these people are to be free; nor is it less cerlain that the two races, equally  
‘ free, CANNOT LIVE IN THE SAME GOVERNMENT. Nature, haou, opinion, have drawn in-

tinction of slavery, that foulest blot upon the Ameri-  
can name. A provision was introduced chiefly by his  
exertions, into the Digest of the Slave Laws made in  
1779, by which all children born after a certain day  
were to be declared free; and to be carried out of the  
state, and settled on unoccupied territory, wpon attain-  
ing a certain age, according to a plan which he had  
digested. Here, however, as in other instances, he  
found that ke was in advance of the age. ** The pub-  
lic mind,” he says many years after, “* would not yet  
bear the proposition, nor will it bear it even at this  
day. Yet the day is not far distant, when it must  
bear and adopt it, or worse will follow. Nothing is  
more certainly written in the book of fate, than that  
these people are to be free; nor is it less certain, that  
the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same  
government. Nature, habit, opinion, have drawn in-  
delible lines of distinction between them. It is still  
in our power to direct the process of emancipation and  
deportation, peaceably, and in such slow degree, as  
that the evil will wear off insensibly, and their p&#x27;av&gt;  
be, pari passu, filled up by free white labourers. If,  
on the contrary, it is left to force itself on, human na-  
ture must shudder at the prospect held up. We should  
in vain look for an example in the Spanish deportation  
or deletion of the Moors. This precedent would fall  
far short of our case.”

ne of the best things the House of Repre­  
sentatives ever did. It saves time and money, and  
relieves the public of a world of trash, which the  
small fry orators are in the habit of throwing out.  
It enables, too, the Representatives of the People  
to dispatch the public business. The People, who  
have no sympathy for the windy tribe, and desire  
not to be bored by their senseless slang, will ap-  
plaud those who have instituted this Rule.  
As germain to this matter, we copy the senti­  
ments of Mr. Jefferson, respecting the wordy gene­  
ration:  
  
Fromthe Life. Writings, and Opinions of Thos. Jefferson,  
Our body was little numerous, but very conten-  
tious. Day after was day wasted on the most unim  
portant questions. A member, one of those afll cted  
with the morbid rage of debate, of an ardent mind,  
pro-apt imagination, and copious flow of words, who  
beard with impatience any logic which was not his  
own, sitting near me on some occasion of a trifling  
but wordy debate, asked me how I could sit in si­  
lence, hearing so much false reasoning, which a  
word should refute. I observed to him that to re­  
indeed, was easy, but to silence, impossible­  
that in measures brought forward by myself I took  
the laboring oar, as was incumbent on me, but that  
in general I was willing to listen; that if every  
sound argument or objection was used by some one  
or other of the numerous debaters, it was enough  
-if not, I thought it sufficient to suggest the omis  
sion, without going into a repetition of what had  
een already said by others; that this was a waste  
and abuse of the time and patience of the House  
which could not be justified. And I believe that if  
 the members of deliberative bodies were to observe  
this course generaily, they would do in a day what  
takes them a week; and it is really more questiona­  
ble than may at first be thought, whether Boxa­  
raate&#x27;s dumb Legislature, which said nothing and  
did much, may not be preferable to one which talks  
much and does nothing. I served with General  
Washinoron in the Legislature of Virginia, be­

LIn in Congress. I hever heard either of them

Jefferson&#x27;s Opinion of the French People-—A more bene-  
volent people I have never known, nor greater warmth and  
devotedness in their select friendships. Their kindness and  
accommodation to strangers is unparalleled, and the hos-  
pitality of Paris is beyond anything I had conceived to be  
practicable in a large city. Their eminence, too; in science,  
the communicative dispositions of their scientific men, the  
politeness of the general manners, the ease and vivacity of  
their conversation, give a charm to their society to be found  
nowhere else. In a comparison of this with other countries,  
we have the proof of primacy which was given to Themistocles  
after the battle of Salamis. Every General voted to himself  
the first reward of valour, and the second to Themistocles.  
So, ask the travelled inhabitant of any nation, “ In what  
country on earth would you rather tive?”—“ Certainly in my  
own, where are ull my friends, my relations, and the earliest  
and sweetest affections and recollections of my life.”—‘* Which

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
&quot;As early as January 7, 1782, Congress had  
turned their attention to the monies current in  
the several states, and had directed the Finan  
cier, Robert Morris, to report to them a table of  
rates, at which the foreign coins should be re­  
ceived at the Treasury. That officer, or rather  
his assistant, Gouveneur Morris, answered them  
on the 15th, in an able and elaborate statement  
of the denominations of money current in the  
several states, and of the comparative value of  
the foreign coins chiefly in circulation with us.  
He went into the consideration of the necessity  
of establishing a standard of value with us, and  
of the adoption of the money unit. He propo  
sed for that unit such a fraction of pure silver  
as would be a common measure of the penny of  
every state, without leaving a iraction. This  
common divisor he found to be one 1440th of a  
dollar, or one 1600th of the crown sterling.  
The value of a dollar was, therefore, to be ex  
pressed by 1440 units, and of a crown by 1600,  
each unit containing a quarter of a grain of fine  
silver. Congress turning again their attention  
to this subject the following year, the Financier,  
by a letter of April 30, 1783, further explained  
and urged the unit he had proposed; but no  
thing more was done on it until the ensuing  
year, when it was again taken up, and referred  
to a committee of which I was a member.  
The general views of the Financier were sound  
and the principle was ingenious on which he  
proposed to found his unit; but it was too mi  
nute for ordinary use, too laborious for compu  
tation, either by the head or in figures. A horse  
or bullock of $80 value, would require a nota  
tion of 6 figures, viz. 115,200. I proposed,  
therefore, instead of this, to adopt this Dollar  
as our unit of account and payment, and that its  
divisions and subdivisions should be in the decl  
mal ratio. I wrote some notes on the subject,  
which I submitted to the consideration of the  
Financier. I received his answer and adhe  
rence to his general system, only agreeing to  
take for his unit 100 of those he first proposed,  
so that a dollar should be 14 40, and a crown 16  
units. I replied to this and printed my Notes  
and Reply on a flying sheet, which I put into  
the hands of the members of Congress for con  
sideration, and the committee agreed to report  
on my principle. This was adopted the ensu  
ing year, and is the system which now prevails

I accordingly prepared three bills for the revisal, proposing  
three distinct grades of education, reaching all classes. 1st.  
Elementary Schools, for all children generally, rich and

desirable for all who were in easy circumstances. And 3d.  
An ultimate grade for teaching the sciences generally, and  
in their highest degree. The first bill proposed to lay off  
every county into Hundreds or Wards, of a proper size and  
population for a school, in which reading, writing, and com.

tion paper, that constantly quotes Mr. Jefferson  
in support of its vationally dividing and socially  
degrading sentiments, celebrates the anniversary  
of his birthday (April 1) by copying extracts  
from his lcuers. Among others we find the fol­  
lowing paragraph, u enrious one for such a place :  
  
[From Autnblo.nphy. vol. 1, p. 39.]  
  
The bill on the subject of slaves was a mere di­  
gest of the existing laws respecting them, withoug  
any intimation of a plan for a futare and general  
emancipation. It was thought better that this  
should be kept back, and n\tmnrted only by way  
of amendment whenever the billshould be bronght  
on. T&#x27;he principles of the amendment, however,  
were agreed on, that is to say, the freedom of all  
born after a certain day and deporiation at a  
properage. Butit was found the public mind  
would not bear this proposition, nor will it bear it  
even at this day. \&quot;;t lﬁe day is not far distant  
when it must bear and adopt it, or worse will fol­  
low. Nothing is mord certainly written in the  
book of fate, than that these people are to be  
free; noris it les« certain, that the two races  
equally free, cannot like in the samne government.  
Nature, habit, opinion, have drawn indelible  
lines of distinetion between them. It is still in  
uir power to direct the process of emancipation  
and deportation, peaceably, and in such slow de­  
gree, as that the evil will wear off insensibly, and  
their place be pari passu filled up b&amp; free white la­  
borers. [lf, on the contrary, it is left to force it  
self on, human nature must shudder ut the pros­  
peet held up. We should in vain look for an ex­  
ample in the ?lpnnich doj)nmuion or deletion of  
the Moors. This precedent would fall far short  
of our case.

our democracy that he was a witness with  
a character. Jefferson says of Maric An­  
toinette:  
&quot;The King was now become a passive  
machine in the hands of the National As­  
sembly, and had he been left to himself, he  
would have willingly acquiesced in what­  
ever they should devise as best for the na­  
tion. A wise constitution would have been  
formed, hereditary in his line, himself pla­  
ced at its head, with powers so large, as to  
enable him to do all the good of his station,  
and so limited, as to restrain him from its  
abuse. This he would have faithfully ad­  
ministered, and more than this, I do not  
believe, he ever wished. But he had a  
Queen of absolute sway over his weak  
mind, and timid virtue, and of a character,  
the reverse of his in all points. This angel,  
as gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of  
Burke, with some smartness of fancy, but  
no sound sense, was proud, disdainful of  
restraint, indignant at all obstacles to her  
will, eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and  
firm enough to hold to her desires, or per­  
ish in their wreck. Her inordinate gamb­  
ling and dissipations, with those of the  
Count d&#x27;Artois, and others of her cligze,  
had been a sensible item in the exhaustion  
of the Treasury, which called into action  
the reforming hand of the nation; and her  
opposition to it, herinflexible perverseness,  
and dauntless spirit, led herself to the guil­  
lotine, drew the King on with her, and plun­  
ged the world into crimes and calamities  
which will for ever stain the pages of mod­  
ern history. I have ever believed, that  
had there been no Qucen, there would  
have been no revolution. No force would  
have been provoked, nor exercised. The  
King would have gone hand in hand with  
the wisdom of his sounder counsellors, who,  
guided by the increased lights of the age,  
wished only, with the same pace, to ad­  
vance the principles of their social constitu­  
tion. The deed which closed the mortal  
course of these sovereigns, I shall neither  
approve nor condemn, I am not prepared  
to say, that the first magistrate of a nation  
cannot commit treason against his country,  
or is unamenable to its punishment; nor  
yet, that where there is no written law, no  
regulated tribunal, there is not a law in our  
hearts, and a power in our hands, given for  
  
righteous employment in maintaining right,  
and redressing wrong. Of those who jud­  
ged the King, many thought him wilfully  
criminal; many, that his existence would  
keep the nation in perpetual conflict with  
the horde of Kings, who would war against  
a regeneration which might come home to  
themselves, and that it were better that one  
should die than all. I should not have vo­  
ted with this portion of the legislature. I  
should have shut up the Queen in a con­  
vent, putting harm out of her power, and  
placed the King in his station, investing  
him with limited powers, which, I verily  
believe, he would have honestly exercised,  
according to the measure of his understan­  
ding. In this way, no void would have  
been created, courting the usurpation of a  
military adventurer, nor occasion given for  
those enormities which demoralized the na­  
tions of the world, and destroyed, and is  
yet to destroy, millions and millions of its  
inhabitants.

While in London, we entered into negotiations with the Chevalier Pinto, Ambassador  
of Portugal, at that place. The only article of difficulty between us was a stipulation  
that our breadstuffs should be received in Portugal, in the form of flour as well as of  
grain. He approved of it himself, but observed that several nobles, of great influence at  
their court, were the owners of wind-mills in the neighborhood of Lisbon, which depended  
much for their gaa on manufacturing our wheat, and that this stipulation would en-  
danger the whole treaty. We signed it, however, and its fate was what he had candidly  
portended.  
  
Mr. Jefferson was anxious to secure the profit resulting from manufacturing  
the wheat. He knew that a barrel of flour was the equivalent of nearly five  
bushels of wheat, and that it contained not only that, but also the food an

“The Eddystone light-house, in the British  
channel, is built on a rock, in the mid-channel,  
and is totally inaccessible in winter, from the bois-  
terous character of that sea, in that season. For  
the two keepers, therefore, employed to keep up  
the lights, all provisions for the winter neces-  
sarily carried to them in autumn, as iey can  
never be visited again till the return of the milder  
season. On the first practicable day in the  
spring, a boat once put off to them with fresh  
supplies. The boatmen met 2t the door one of  
  
  
  
the keepers, and accosted him with a ‘ How goes  
it, friend? ‘Very well.’ ‘How is your compan-

him to day? ‘No? ‘When did you see him ?

him, as having certainly murdered his companion:

for themselves. They went up and _ there found  
the other keeper. They had quarrelled, it seems,

parties, assigned the cares below to one, and those  
above to the other, and had never spoken to, or

The flrat establishment in Virginia which  
became permanent, was made in 1607. I hare  
found no mention of negroes in the colony until  
ihout 1650. The first brought hero as slaves  
were by a Dutch ship ; afior which the Knglish  
:ommonced the trade, and continued it until  
the revolutionary war. That suspended, ipso  
facto, their further importation for the present;  
and the business of the war pressing constantly  
on the Legislature, this subject was not acted  
on finally until the year &#x27;78. when I brought  
in a bill to prevent their further importation.  
I&#x27;his passed without opposition, and stopped  
the increase of the evil by importation, leaving  
to future efforts its final eradication.?Page 31.  
The bill on the subject of slaves was a mere  
digest of the existing laws respecting them,  
without any intimation of a plan for a future  
ind general emancipation. It was thought  
Jetter that this should be kept back, and atempted  
only by way of amendment, whenever  
he bill should be brought on. The principles  
if the amendment, however, woro agreed on ;  
  
hat is to say, the freedom of all born after a 1  
ertain day, and deportation at n proper age.  
Jut it was found that the public mind would not  
mt bear the proposition, nor will it boar it even  
it thin day ; yet the day is not distant when it  
nust bear and adopt it, or worse will follow.  
Nothing is more certainly written in the book  
if fate, than that these people are to be free;  
lor is it less cortain that the two races, equally  
roe, cannot live in the samo Government. Na- i  
ure, habit, opinion, have drawn indelible lines  
f distinction betweon them. It is still in our  
ower to direct the process of emancipation  
nd deportation peaceably, and in such slow  
egree as that tho evil will wear olf insensibly,  
nd thoir place be pari passu filled up by free i  
&#x27;hite laborers. IfJ on the contrary, it is left to i  
roe itself on, human nature must shudder at I  
je prospect held up. We should in vain look &lt;  
&gt;r an example in the Spanish deportation or 1  
slotion of the Moors. This precedent would i  
ill far short of our caso.?Pages .&#x27;1!^ 40.

up to the moment when it was closed by the  
Revolution. I made in that assembly, a pro­  
position in favor of emancipating the sla\es;

our duty to subordinate ourselves to the mother

““At Philadelphia, I called on the venerable and beloved Franklin. He was  
then on the bed of sickness from which he never rose. My recent return  
from a country in which he had left so many friends, and the perilous con  
valsions to which they had been exposed, revived all his anxieties to know  
what part they had taken, what had been their course, and what their fate.  
He went over all in succession, with a rapidity and animation almost too  
much for his strength. When all his inquiries were satisfied, and a pausi  
took place, I told him I had learned with much pleasure that, since his  
return to America, he had been occupied in preparing for the world the his-  
  
tory of his own life. ‘I can not say much of that,’ said he, ‘but I will give  
you a sam pie of what I shall leave ;’? and he directed his little grandson,  
(William Bache,) who was standing by the bedside, to hand him a paper from  
  
the table, to which he pointed. He did so; and the Doctor putting it into  
  
my hands, desired me to take it and read it at my leisure. It was about a  
quire of folio paper, written in a large and running hand, very like his own.  
  
yoked into it slightly, then shut it, and said I would accept hi  
  
to read it, and would carefully return it. He said, ‘No, k« ep it.’ Not cer  
tain of his meaning, I again looked into it, folded it for my pocket, and said  
ugain, [ would certainly return it. ‘No,’ said he, ‘keep it.’ I put it into  
  
my pocket and shortly after took leave of him. He died on the 17th of the  
ensuing month of April; and as I understood that he intended to bequeath  
to his grandson, William Temple Franklin, I immediately wrote to Mr.  
  
Franklin, to inform him I pessessed this paper, which I should consider his  
  
property, and would deliver to his order. He came on immediately to New-  
York, called on me for it, and I delivered it to him. As he put it into his  
pocket, he said carelessly, he had either the original, or another copy of it,  
[ do not recollect which. This last expression struck my attention forcibly,  
and for the first time suggested to me the thought that Dr. Franklin had  
  
meant it as a confidential deposit in my hands, and that I had done wrong  
  
in parting from it. I have not yet seen the collection he published of Dr.  
Franklin’s works, and therefore know not if this isamong them. I have  
  
been told itis not. It contained a narrative of the negotiations between  
  
Dr. Franklin and the British ministry, when he was endeavoring to prevent  
the contest of arms which followed. The negotiation was brought about by  
  
he interyention of Lord Howe and his sister, who, I believe, was called  
  
  
  
  
  
1855. | . f Wh FINS of Th WA ole ( SOUL. 2]  
Lady Howe, but I may misremember her title. Lord Howe seems to have  
been friendly to America, and exceedingly anxious to prevent a rupture.  
  
His intimacy with Dr. Franklin, and his position with the Ministry, induced  
him to undertake a mediation between them: in which his sister seemed to  
have been associated. They carried from one to the other, backwards and  
forwards, the several propositions and answers which passed, and seconded  
1eir intercessions the importance of mutual sacrifices, to preserve the  
  
peace and connection of the two countries. I remember that Lord North’s

said to the mediators distinctly, at last, that ‘a rebellion was not to be  
  
deprecated on the part of Great Britain; that the confiscations it would  
  
  
  
  
  
produce would provide for many of their friends,’ This expression was  
reported by the mediators to Dr. Franklin, and indicated so cool and calcu-  
lated a purpose in the Ministry, as to render compromise hopeless, and thi  
negotiation was discontinued. If this is not among the papers published,  
we ask, what has become of it? I delivered it with my own hands into  
t ) Ol T mpl Franklin. It certainly established vi Ws SO atrocious in  
the British government, that its suppress ld, to them, be worth a  
great price. But could the grandson of Dr. klin be, in such Cegree, an

accomplice in the parricide of the memory of his immortal grandfather?  
  
The suspension for more than twenty years of the general publication, be-  
  
queathed and confided to him, prodiac for awhile, hard suspicions against  
him; and if, at last, all are not published, a part of th suspicions may  
remain with some.”

The bill on the subject of slaves, was a  
mere digest of the existing laws without  
any intimation of a plan for a future and  
goneral emancipation. It was thought  
better that this should be kept back and  
attempted only by way of amendment,  
whenever the bill should be brought on.  
The principles of the amendment were  
agreed on, that is to say, the freedom of  
all after a certain day, and deportation of  
a proper age. But it was found that the  
public mind would not bear the proposi-  
ion, nor will it bear it aven at this day  
when he wrote his notes on Virginia.)  
Yet the day is not distant when it must  
bear and adopt it, or worse will follow.  
Nothing is more certainly written in the

be free; nor is it less certain that the two  
races equally free cannot live in the same  
government. Nature, habit, and opinion  
have drawn indelible lines of distinction

“ The bill on the subject of slaves was a mere digest of the existing laws  
respecting them, without any intimation of a plan for future and general eman-  
cipation. It was thought better that this should be kept back, and attempted  
only by way of amendment whenever the bill should be brought on. The  
principles of the amendment, however, were agreed on; that is to say, the  
freedom of all born after a certain day, and deportation at a proper age. But  
it was found that the public mind would not yet bear the proposition, nor will  
it bear it even at this day. Yet the day is not far distant when it must bear  
and adopt it, or worse will follow. Nothing is more certainly written in the  
book of fate, than that these people are to be free: nor is it less certain that  
the two races equally free cannot live in the same government. Nature,  
habit, opinion have drawn indelible lines of distinction between them. It is  
still in our power to direct the process of emancipation peaceably, and in such  
slow degree, as that the evil will wear off insensibly, and their places be, pari  
passu, filled up by free white laborers. If, on the contrary, it is left to force  
itself on, human nature must shudder at the prospect held up. We should in  
vain look for an example in the Spanish deportation or deletion of the Moors  
—the precedent would fall far short of our case.”

“and what probably fixed the destinies of my life, that Dr.  
William Small of Scotland was then Professor of Mathe-

most of the useful branches of science, with a happy talent  
of communication, correct and gentlemanly manners, and an

country without any visible head whatever,  
&quot;At this time&quot; says Jefferson, &quot;I was in France  
and speaking with Dr. Franklin of this singu­  
lar disposition of men to quarrel, and divide  
into parties, he gave his sentiments, as usual,  
by way of Apologue. He mentioned the Ed-  
dystone light-house, in the British channel, a  
being built on a rock, in the mid-channel, to-  
tally inaccessible ingwinter, from the boisterou.  
character of that sea, in that season; that,  
therefore, for the two keepers employed to keep  
up the lights, all provisions for the winter were  
necessarily carried to them in autumn, as they  
could never be visited again till the return of  
the milder season; that, on the first practical  
day in the spring, a boat put off to them with  
resh supplies. The boatmen met at the door  
one of the keepers, and accosted him with a  
&quot;How goes it, friend? Very well How is your  
companion? I do not know. Don&#x27;t know?  
a not he here? I can&#x27;t tell. Have you not

him? Not since last fall. You have killed  
him? Not I, indeed,&quot; They were about to  
lay hold of him, as having certainly murdered  
his companion; but he desired them to go up  
tairs and examine for themselves. They bad  
quarrelled, it seems, soon after being left there,  
had divided into two parties, assignod the cares  
below to one, and those above to the other,  
and had never spoken to, or seen, one another  
since.

“In England it was a great point gained at the Revolution, (English,) that

change there to the tenure of good behavior, left to the vote of the simple

we were all good English whigs, cordial in their free principles, and in their  
jealousies of their executive magistrate. These jealousies are very apparent  
in all our state constitutions ; and in the general government, in this instance, we  
have gone even beyond the English caution, by requiring a vote of two-thirds,  
in one of the houses, for removing a judge; a vote so impossible, where any  
defense is made,* before men of ordinary prejudices and passions, that our  
judges are effectually independent of the nation. But this ought not to be.  
I would not, indeed, make them dependent on the executive authority, as  
they formerly were in England ;+ but I deem it indispensable to the continu-  
ance of this government, that they should be submitted to some practical and  
impartial control ; and that this, to be imparted, must be compounded of a  
mixture of state and federal authorities. Itis not enough that honest men are  
appointed judges. All know the influence of interest on the mind of man, and  
how unconsciously his judgment is warped by that influence. To this biasadd that  
of the esprit du corps, of their peculiar maxim and creed, that ‘ it is the office  
of a good judge to enlarge his jurisdiction,’ and the absence of responsibility ;  
and how can we expect impartial decision between the general government,  
of which they are themselves so eminent a part, and an individual state, from  
which they have nothing to hope or fear? We have seen, too, that, con-  
trary to all correct example, they are in the habit of going out of the question  
before them, to throw an anchor ahead, and grapple further hold for future  
advances of power. They are then, in fact, the corps of sappers and miners,  
steadily working to undermine the independent rights of the states, and to  
consolidate all power in the hands of the government in which they have so  
large a freehold estate.... I do not charge the judges with willful and ill-  
intentioned error; but honest error must be arrested, where its toleration leads  
to public ruin. As, for the safety of society, we commit honest maniacs to  
Bedlam, so judges should be withdrawn from the bench, whose erroneous  
biases are leading us to dissolution. It may, indeed, injure them in fame or

now, when viewed in the light (or rather in the darkness) of the  
Dred Scott case? When we consider the obiter dicta character of  
the decision in this notorious case, how the court traveled widely  
out of the record solely to crush a formidable political party, we see  
a peculiar significance in his remark that, “ they are in the habit of  
going out of the question before them, fo throw an anchor ahead,  
and grapple further hold for future advances of power.”  
  
There are two corollaries to his love of republicanism. First, his  
  
* In the impeachment of Judge Pickering, of New-Hampshire, a habitual and  
maniac drunkard, no defence was made. Had there been, the party vote of  
more than one-third of the Senate would have acquitted him.

States is not out of place at the present moment

framed the basis of all our laws, were Madison  
and Jefferson, of Virginia. After the general  
peace in 1783, by the unwearied exertions of  
these two men in their own State, in opposition  
to the endless quibbles, chicaneries and vexatious  
delays of lawyers and demi-lawyers, several bills  
  
of importance were passed. Among them was  
the bill for establishing religious freedom. The  
principles had, to a certain degree, been enacted  
before; but Jefferson drew it up ir  
all the latitude of reason and right. It still  
met with opposition, but with some mutilations  
in the preamble it was finally passed; and a sin  
gular proposition proved that its protection of  
opinion was meant to be universal. Where the  
peamlic declares that coucion is a depwtacs

I am tempted to give our coming mon the  
benefit of the lesson they convey. &quot; Our  
body,&quot; he remarks, &quot; was little  
numerous, but very contentious. Day  
after day was wasted on tho most  
unimportant questions. A member, one of  
those afflicted with the morbid rage of  
debate, of an ardent mind, prompt  
imagination, and copious flow of words,  
who heard with impatience any logic  
which was not his own, sitting near me  
on some occasion of a trifling, but  
wordy de-bate, asked me how I could sit  
in silence and bear so much false  
reasoning, which a &amp;nbsp; word would  
refute? I observed to him, to refute  
indeed was easy, but to silence,  
impossible; that in measures brought  
for-ward by myself I took the laboring  
oar as was incurabent on me ; but that  
in general I was willing to listen ;  
that if every sound argument or  
objection was used by some one or other  
of the numerous debaters it was enough;  
if not,&#x27; I thought it sufficient to  
suggest the omission, without going into  
a repetition of what-had been already  
said by others ; that this was a waste  
and abuse of the time and patience of  
the House, which &amp;nbsp; could not be  
justified.&quot; &quot;I served with General  
Washington in the Legislature of  
Virginia, before the revolu &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp; tion, and, during it, with Dr.  
Franklin in &amp;nbsp; &#x27; Congress. I never  
heard either of them speak ten minutes  
at a time, nor to any but the main point  
which was to decide the ques-tion. They  
laid their shoulders to the great  
points, knowing that the little ones  
would follow of themselves. If the  
present Con-gress &#x27; he adds,&#x27; errs in  
too much talking, how can it be  
otherwise, in a body to which the people  
send 150 lawyers, whose trade it is to  
question everything, yield nothing, and

## [COLONIAL PARLIAMENT. NEW SOUTH WALES. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9TH.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13034264)

America, said:-&quot;I served with General  
Washington in the Legislature of  
Virginia, and with Dr. Franklin in  
Congress. I never heard either of them  
speak ten minutes at a time, nor to  
anything bnt the main point which was to  
decide the question. They laid their  
shoulders to the grand points, knowing  
that little ones would follow of  
themselves. Our body was little  
numerous, but very contentious. Day  
after day was wasted in the mott  
unimportant questions. To refute,  
indeed, was easy, bat to Bilence  
impossible. I was willing to listen, and  
thought it sufficient to suggest any  
omission, without re-peating, for the  
tenth time, what had already been said  
by others-a waste and abuse of the time  
and patience ot the House which could  
not be justified. Such conduct renders  
it questionable whether Bonaparte&#x27;s  
dnrab Legislature, which said nothing  
and DID much, may not be preferable to  
one which TALKS much and does NOTHINO.  
(Laughter.; Another consideration which  
he (Mr. Cape) thought ought to influence  
tbe decision of this matter, was the  
faot that in a climate like this it was  
injurious to health to sit so long and  
se late. (Hear, hear.) Awl it appeared  
to him that, in considering the right of  
debate, they would have to consider at  
the same time the debating powers of the  
House ; for while the greatest scope  
should be given to those who were  
qualified from their talent,  
information, and experience to throw  
light upon a question, it did not follow  
that they should extend the sam

* The fundamental defect ofthe Confederation was, that  
Congress was not authorized to act iminediately on the  
people, and by its own officers. Their power was only  
requisitory, and these requisitions were addressed to the  
several Legislatures, to be by them carried into execution,  
without other coercion than the moral principle of duty.’’  
  
Acting in this high sovereign capacity, they  
withdrew from the State authorities the exercise  
of certain sovereign powers, and vested the same  
in the General Government.  
  
So much for the mode of its formation. Icome

papers at the time of his death. Says his biog-  
rapher, ‘* Time but added emphasis to his appall-  
ing predictions, and strengthened his attachment  
to the plan of redemption which he originally  
proposed.”  
  
* It was found that the public mind would not  
yet bear the proposition, nor will it bear it even  
at this day, (1821.) Yet the day is not distant,  
when it must bear and adopt it, or worse will  
follow. Nothing is more certainly written in the  
book of fate, than that these people are to be  
free; nor is it less certain, that the two races,  
equally free, cannot live in the same government.  
Nature, habit, opinion have drawn indelible tines  
of distinction between them. It is still in our  
power to direct the process uf Emancipation and de-  
portation, peaceably, and in such slow degree, as  
that the evil will wear off insensibly, and their  
place be, pari passu, filled up by free white la-  
borers. Jf, on the contrary, it is left to force itself  
on, human nature must shudder at the prospect held  
up. We should in vain look for an example in the  
Spanish deportation, or deietion of the Moors.  
‘This precedent would fall far short of our case.”

wise, in a body to which the people send one  
hundred and fifty lawyers, whose trade it is to  
question every thing, yield nothing, and talk  
by the hour ?”—adding, with satirical emphasis,  
“*that one hundred and fifty lawyers should do  
business ought not to be expected.” This head  
of Jefferson fails to convey the philosophic force  
of his maturer years. It is that of a sanguine  
more than a sagacious man. The erect posi-  
tion adds to its impulsive character, and I can  
well imagine how the dramatic fire of Patrick  
Henry’s speech against the Stamp Act must  
have set the young red head of Jefferson in  
flames.

Jefferson says: “One provision of the bill was that the expenses of  
the schools should be borne by the inhabitants of the county, every  
one in proportion to his general tax rate. This would throw on wealth  
the education of the poor.”  
  
In 1796 the assembly acted upon the bill, but inserted a provision  
leaving to each county court to declare when the act should go into  
operation within the limits of its jurisdiction, which, adds Jefferson,  
“completely defeated it. The justices being generally of the more  
wealthy class, were unwilling to incur the burden, and I believe it  
was not suffered to commence in a single county.”

Mir. Madison,&quot; he says, &quot; came into the   
House in 1776, a new member and young;   
which circumstances, concurring with his   
extreme modesty, prevented his venturing   
himself in debate before his removal to the   
Council of State in November, 1777. From   
thence he went to Congress, then consisting   
of few members. Trained in three succes­

from his subject into vain declamation,   
but pursuing it closely in language pure,   
classical and copious, soothing always the   
feelings of his adversaries by civilities and   
softness of expression, he rose to the emi­

Virginia, which followed, he sustained the   
new Constitution in all its parts, bearing   
off the palm against the logic of George   
Mason and the fervid declamation of Mr.   
Henry. With these consummate powers   
were united a pure and spotless virtue,

Harrison had told him that William  
Livingston was the author. Hence he  
now turned to Livingston and urged  
him to undertake the important and  
difficult draft committed to them. The  
member from New Jersey excused him-  
self, and proposed the work to Jeffer-  
son. Upon this he renewed his re-  
quest with such urgency that Living-  
ston was puzzled. “We are as yet  
but new acquaintances, sir,” said the  
Jerseyman ; “why are you so urgent  
for my doing it?” He replied, “ Be-  
cause I have been informed that  
you drew the Address to the People

paper to the house, but as it was the  
composition of John Jay of New York,  
he was compelled to waive the compli-

ment. “On that, perhaps, sir,” said  
he, “ you may not have been correctly  
informed.”  
  
The next morning, as Jefferson him-  
self reports, he discovered that Mr.  
Jay was not disposed to lose the honor  
of his performance. As he was walk-  
ing about in the hal] before the house  
had been called to order, he observed  
Mr. Jay leading towards him, “ by the  
button of his coat,” Mr. R. H. Lee of  
Virginia. These gentlemen were not

said Jay to Jefferson, when he had

asked Dickinson, make reconciliation

“He was so honest a man,” says Mr.  
Jefferson, “and so able a one, that he  
was greatly indulged even by those  
who could not feel his scruples.” The  
committee asked him to take Mr. Jef-  
ferson’s draft, which all seem to have  
approved but Dickinson, and put it  
into a form he could adopt. The re-

from the wreck; proposing that the  
eldest son should, at least, have a  
double portion. No, said Jefferson ;  
“if the eldest son could eat twice as  
much, or do double work, it might be  
a natural evidence of his right to a  
double  
in his  
  
portion; but, being on a par  
powers and wants with his  
brothers and sisters, he should be on  
a par also in the partition of his patri-  
mony.” Against Pendleton, too, Mr.  
Jefferson prevailed to preserve as much

brought forward his proposition to

executive functions to a permanent

This was the first attempt toward a

Jefferson records, was speedy and com-

only a more disputatious and unnmaan-

their post, and left the government

ity. He thought it better, and the  
commissioners came into the same  
opinion, “to leave to legislative regu-  
lation, on both sides, such modifica-  
tions of our commercial intercourse as  
would voluntarily flow from amicable  
dispositions.”  
  
The commissioners did, neverthe-  
less, fulfil their instructions by “ sound-  
ing ” the several ambassadors resident  
at Paris, most of whom forwarded cop-  
ies of the draft to their courts. At  
that moment there was in Europe but  
one intelligent man upon a throne;  
“old Frederick of Prussia,” as Jeffer-  
son styles him, who “ met us cordially  
and without hesitation”; and with  
him the treaty, with unimportant  
changes, was concluded. Denmark  
and Tuscany also entered into negoti-  
ations. The other powers appeared  
so indifferent that the commissioners  
could not, consistently with self-respect,  
press the matter. “They seemed, in  
fact,” says Jefferson, “to know little  
about us, except as rebels who had  
been successful in throwing off the  
yoke of the mother country. They were  
ignorant of our commerce, which had  
always been monopolized by England,  
and of the exchange of articles it might  
offer advantageously to both parties.

It was four o’clock in the afternoon

Jefferson says, “I was a silent witness

opinion; to a logical reasoning and  
chaste eloquence, disfigured by no

On the 22d of July, Dr. Franklin, Jefferson, John Adams,  
and R. H. Lee were appointed a committee to consider and  
report on Lord North’s conciliatory resolution. The answer  
of the Virginia assembly having been approved, Jefferson  
was requested by the committee to prepare this report, which,  
he says, accounts for the similarity of the two instruments.  
On the 15th of May, 1776, the convention of Virginia, that  
had assembled to make a state constitution, instructed the  
Virginia delegates, in Congress, to propose to that body to  
declare the colonies independent of Great Britain, and ap-  
pointed a committee to propose a declaration of rights and

and being assured of a welcome they arrived and sat at din-  
ner the next day. His companions were Dupont, Barnave,  
Alex. la Moth, Blacon, Monnior, Maubourg, and Dagout.  
These were the leading patriots who sought to reconcile the  
extremes of their constitution to save France.  
  
With this view La Fayette had invited this conference  
under the roof and at the table of the American minister.  
The cloth being removed, and wine set on the table, after  
the American manner, the marquis introduced the objects of  
the conference by summarily reminding them of the state of  
things in the assembly, the course of the constitution, and the  
inevitable result unless checked by concord among the patriots  
themselves. La Fayette observed that he was ready to sacri-  
fice his own opinions to that of his brethren in the same cause,  
and that they must come to one accord or that the aristocracy  
would carry every thing, and that whatsoever they should  
agree upon he, at the head of the National Guards, would  
maintain. .  
  
The discussions began at the hour of four, and continued  
until ten in the evening, during which Jefferson relates that  
  
he was a silent witness to a coolness and candor of argument  
unusual during the conflicts of political opinion, to a logical  
reasoning, chaste eloquence truly worthy of being placed in  
parallel with the finest dialogues of antiquity as handed down  
by Plato, Xenophon, and Cicero. The result was, the king  
should have a suspensive veto, the legislature should be com-

necessity of arousing our people from the lethargy into which  
they had fallen, as to passing events, and thought that the

fasting, humiliation and prayer, to implore Heaven to avert  
from us the evils of civil war, to inspire us with firmness in  
support of our rights, and to turn&#x27;the hearts of the King and  
Parliament to moderation and justice. * * * This was in

His plan evinced a mastery of the subject. He digged to the  
bottom, and built on the true-principle, a decimal coinage. He  
was profoundly clear in devising a money unit which should dis-  
turb but slightly all former modes of valuation. Congress took no  
action until the next year, when the subject was discussed and re-  
ferred to a committee of which Jefferson was a member. He de-  
clared that “the general views of the financier were sound, and  
the principle was ingenious on which he proposed to found his  
  
unit, but it was too minute for ordinary use, too laborious for compu-  
tation, either by the head or in figures.” Jefferson proposed, there-  
fore, to adopt the dollar as a unit of account and payment, and  
that its divisions and sub-divisions should be in the decimal ratio.  
  
He prepared some observations on the subject, for the consideration  
of Morris. The financier replied, still adhering to his scheme,

proposed, To Morris’s communication Jefferson wrote an answer,

Madison declared him the ablest man in debate that he had ever  
heard ; and Jefferson, near the close of his life, wrote : “I had many  
occasional and strenuous coadjutors in debate ; and one most stead-  
fast, able and zealous, who was himself a host. This was George  
Mason, a man of the first order of wisdom among those who acted  
on the theatre of the Revolution, of expansive mind, profound judg-  
ment, cogent in argument, learned in the lore of our former Con-  
stitution, and earnest for the republican change on democratic  
principles. His elocution was neither flowing nor smooth ; but his  
language was strong, his manner most impressive, and strengthened  
by a dash of biting cynicism, when provocation made it seasonable.”  
  
In 1777 Mason was elected a member of the Continental Con-  
gress, and was engaged in correspondence and consultation about  
public affairs with leading men, but took no conspicuous part until  
1787, when he was chosen a member of the Federal Convention to  
frame the Constitution of the United States. Devoted to his home  
and children, he preferred privacy, and a sense of duty alone could  
induce him to accept public station. He took the lead in the de-  
bates on the formation of the Constitution, and always on the liberal  
and democratic side. When the question was discussed whether the

Third Term. He was in fivor ot a  
limited term. He says &quot;My fears of  
that feature term for lite Were found­  
ed on th importance of the office, on  
the fierce contentions it . migiit excite  
among ourselves, if continuable for  
life, and the dangers of interference, by  
foreign nations, to whom the choice of  
an Americau President might become  
interesting. Examples of this abound:  
in history ; m the case of thej Roman  
Emperors, for instance;: of the Popes of  
any significance ; of the German Em­  
perors; of the kings of Polaad, and the  
deya of Barbery. I had observed, too,  
in the feudal history, and in the recent  
instance, particularly, of the Stadhol­  
der of Holland, how easily, officers,, or  
tenu res or life, slide into inhcritancse.  
My wish, therefore, was that the Presi­  
dent should be elected for seven yearsi  
lind be ineligible afterwards.&quot; &#x27; &quot;  
&quot;But the practice, adopted, I think, is  
better, his continuance, for eight years,  
with a liability to be dropped halfway  
of the term, making that a period &quot;of  
probation&#x27; That this  
continuance should be restrained to  
seven years, was the opinion of the  
Convention at an earlier stage of, its  
session, when it voted that term, by a  
majority of 8 against 2, and by a simple  
majority of colonics, that he should  
be eligible a second time. This opinion  
was confirmed by the House so late as  
  
J uly 2G, refei red to the- committee of  
detail, report.d favorably bv , them,  
and changed to the presentform by a  
final vole, on the Inst day, but one only,  
of their session. Of this change,&#x27; three  
states expressed their disapprobation;  
New York, by recommending an amend­  
ment, the President should not be eligi­  
ble a third ii?ne, and Virginia and North  
Carolina, that he should not be capable  
of serving more than eight, in any term  
of sixteen years; and although this  
amendment has not been made inform,  
yet practice sem3 to have established  
it. The example of four Presidents, vol  
untarily retiring at the end of the eighth  
year, and the progress of public opinion,  
the principle of which is salutary, have  
given it in practice, tlte force of precedent  
and usatjc; insomuch, that should tht  
President consent to be d candidate for a  
third election, I trust he WOULD BE re  
JECTED, ON THIS DEMOSSTKATION OF  
AMBITIOUS VIEWy.&quot;

This Convention met in Philadelphia on the 25th of May, 1787. It sat  
with closed doors, and kept all its proceedings secret until its dissolution on  
the 17th of September, when the results of its labors were published all to-  
gether. I received a copy early in November, and read and contemplated its  
provisions with great satisfaction. As not a member of the Convention, how-  
ever, nor probably a single citizen of the Union had approved it in all its  
parts, so I too found articles which I thought objectionable. The absence of  
express declarations insuring freedom of religion, freedom of the press, free-  
dom of the person under the uninterrupted protection of the habeas corpus,  
and trial by jury in civil as well as in criminal cases, excited my jealousy, and  
the reéligibility of the President for life I quite disapproved. I expressed  
freely in letters to my friends, and most particularly to Mr. Madison and Gen-  
eral Washington, my approbations and objections. How the good should be  
secured and the ill brought to rights was the difficulty. To refer it back to  
a new Convention might endanger the loss of the whole. My first idea was,  
that the nine States first acting should accept it unconditionally, and thus  
secure what in it was good, and that the last four should accept on the pre-  
vious condition that certain amendments should be agreed to; but a better  
course was devised, of accepting the whole and trusting that the good sense  
and honest intuitions of our citizens would make the alterations which should  
be deemed necessary. Accordingly, all accepted, six without objection and  
seven with recommendations of specified amendments. Those respecting the  
press, religion, and juries, with several others of great value, were accordingly  
made; but the habeas corpus was left to the discretion of Congress, and the  
amendment against the reéligibility of the President was not proposed. My  
fears of that feature were founded on the importance of the office, on the  
fierce contentions it might excite among ourselves, if continuable for life, and  
the dangers of interference, either with money or arms, by foreign nations to  
whom the choice of an American President might become interesting. Ex-  
amples of this abounded in history; in the case of the Roman Emperors, for  
instance; of the Popes, while of any significance; of the German Emperors ;  
the Kings of Poland, and the Deys of Barbary. I had observed too, in the  
feudal history, and in the recent instance particularly of the Stadtholder of  
Holland, how easily offices or tenures for life slide into inheritances. My  
wish, therefore, was that the President should be elected for seven years and  
be ineligible afterward. This term 1 thought sufficient to enable him, with  
the concurrence of the Legislature, to carry through and establish any system  
of improvement he should propose for the general good. But the practice

liability to be dropped at half-way of the term, making that a period of pro-  
bation. That his continuance should be restrained to seven years was the  
opinion of the Convention at an earlier stage of its session, when it voted that

should be ineligible a second time. This opinion was confirmed by the House  
so late as July 26th, referred to the committee of detail, reported favorably

one of their session. Of this change three States expressed their disappro-  
bation—New York by recommending an amendment that the President should  
not be eligible a third time, and Virginia and North.Carolina that he should  
not be capable of serving more than eight in any term of sixteen years; and,  
though this amendment has not been made in form, yet practice seems to  
have established it. The example of four Presidents voluntarily retiring at  
the end of their eighth year, and the progress of public opinion that the prin-  
ciple is salutary, have given it in practice the form of precedent and usage;  
insomuch that should a President consent to be a candidate for a third elec-

with money or arms, by foreign nations to  
whom tbo choice of an American President  
might become Interesting. Examples of this  
abounded In history; in tbo case of tho Roman  
Emperors, for instance: of the Popes, while of  
any significance; of tbo Gorman Emperors;  
tbo Kings of Poland, and tbo Doys of liurhnrr.  
I bad observed, too, in tho feudal history, and in  
tbo recent Inutmico particularly of tbo Btadt­  
boldor of Holland, bow easily offices or tenures  
tor life slldo Into inheritances. My witib, there­  
fore, was that tho President should bo elected  
for rrcen prnrn mid he ineligible atterumrd. This  
term 1 thought sulllelont to onnblo him, with tho  
concurrence of tho Legislature, to cam- through  
and establish any system of improvement ho  
should propose for tbo general good. Hut tbo  
practice adopted, I think, Is bettor, allowing bis  
continuance for eight yours, with a liability to  
be dropped at half-war of tho term, making  
that u period of probation. That bis continu­  
ance should bo restrained to seven years was tbo  
opinion of tbo Convention at an earlier  
atago of its session, when it voted that  
term by a majority of eight against  
two, mid by a simple majority that bo  
should bo Ineligible asceond time. This opinion  
whs confirmed by tho House so Into ns July 30,  
referred to tho Committee of Detail, reported  
favorably by thorn, and changed to tbo present  
form by final vote, on tho last&#x27; day but one of  
tbolr session. Of tills change three States ex­  
pressed tholr disapprobation,—Now York by  
recommending an amendment that tho Presi­  
dent should not bo eligible a third (Imo, and Vir­  
ginia and North Carolina that ho should not bo  
capable of nerving more than eight In any form  
of sixteen years; and, though this amendment  
has not boon mode in form, yot practice seems  
to bnvo established it. Tho example of four  
Prcsldenta voluntarily retiring at tho end of  
tbolr eighth year, and the progress of public  
opinion that tbo principle Is salutary, have given  
it in practice (bo form, of precedent and usage;  
Insomuch that should a President consent to bo  
a candldatmfor u third election, I trust ho would  
bo rejected on this demonstration of ambitious  
views.

“ Among these, however, were some reasonable and liberal men, who  
enabled us on some points to obtain feeble majorities.” “A majority

‘*In process of time, however, other sectarisms were  
introduced, chiefly of the Presbyterian family. The es-  
tablished clergy, secure for life in their glebes and sala-  
ries, adding to these generally the emoluments of a  
classical school, found employment enough in their  
farms and school-rooms for the rest of the week, and de-  
voted Sunday only for the edification of their flock by  
service and a sermon at their parish church. Their  
other pastoral functions were little attended to. Against  
this inactivity the zeal and industry of sectarian  
preachers had an open and undisputed field, and by the  
time of the Revolution a majority of the inhabitants  
had become dissenters from the Established Church, but  
were still obliged to pay contributions to support the  
pastors of the minority. This unrighteous compulsion  
to maintain teachers of what they deemed religious  
errors was grievously felt during the regal government,  
and without a hope of relief.”

laws respecting them, without any intimation of a plan for a future or general emancipation.  
It was thought better that this should be kept back, and attempted only by way of amendment  
whenever the bill should be brought on, The principles of the amendment, however, were  
agreed on—that is to say, the freedom of all born after a certain day and deportation after a pro:

bear it even at this day. Yet the day is not distant when it must bear and adopt it, or worse

frankly, and without ‘hesitation, that our disposi-

be the interest of both these powers that we should  
be so; because, it would relieve both from all anx-

a clause, also, by which we guaranteed to France  
her American possessions, might perhaps force us  
into the war, if these were attacked. ‘Then it will

“No,” said Mr. Jefferson, the Democrat,  
“not until he can eat a double allowance  
food and double the amount of work.”  
Thus, by this prince of Democrats, an equal  
distribution of property among children  
was established.  
We can hardly imagine what a great  
social revolution was inaugurated by this  
one man. Said he—“instead of an aristoc­

&quot;A member, one of those afflicted  
with the morbid rage of debate, of an  
ardent mind, prompt imagination and  
copious flow of words, who heard  
with impatience any logic which was  
jiot his own, sitting near me on some  
occasion of a trifling, but wordy, de­  
bate, asked me how I could sit in  
silence, hearing so much false xeason  
ing, which a word could refute ? I  
observed to him that to refute indeed  
was easy, but to silence, impossible;  
that in measures brought forward by  
myself I took the laboring oar as  
was incumbent on me, but that in  
general I was unwilling to listen; that,  
if every sound argument or objection  
was used by some one or other of  
the numerous debaters, it was enough;  
if not, I thought it sufficient to sug  
gest the omission without going into  
a repetition of what had been already  
said by others, that this was a waste  
and abuse of the time and patience or  
the House which could not be justi  
fied. And I believe if members of  
deliberate bodies were to observe this  
course generally they would do in a  
day what takes them a week; and it  
is really more questionable than may  
at first be thought, whether Bon  
parlis dumb legislature, which said  
nothing and did much, may not be  
preferable to one which talks much  
and does nothing. I served with Gen  
eral Washington ia the legislature ot  
Virginia, before the revolution, and  
during it with Dr, Franklin in Con­  
gress. I never heard either of theui  
speak ten minutes at a time, nor to  
any but the main point which was to  
decide the question. They laid their  
shouliers to the greit points, know  
ing that the little ones would follow  
of themselves.&quot; P. 47-48, Memoir f  
Ihos. Jefftrson, Vol. 1.  
If the present Congress errs in too  
much talking, how can it be other wife  
in a body to which the people send  
one hundred and fifty lawyers, whose  
trade it is to question everything,  
and talk by the hour ? That one  
hundred and fifty lawyers should do  
business together ought not to be ex

It is not enough that honest men  
are appointed judges. All know the  
influence of interest, on the mind of  
man, and how unconsciously his judg­  
ment is warped by that influence. To  
this bias add that of the esprit de corps,  
of their peculiar maxim and creed  
that &quot;it is the office of a good Judge  
to enlarge his jurisdiction,&quot; and the  
absence of responsibility; and how  
can we expect impartial decision be­  
tween the general government, of  
which they are themselves so eminent  
a part, and an in livid ual State, from  
which they have nothing to hope or  
fear? We have s?en, too, that, con­  
trary to all correct example theyare  
in the habit of going out of the ques  
tion before them, to throw an anchor  
ahead, and grapple further hold for  
future advances of power. They are  
then, in fact, the corps of saffers and  
miners, steadily working to under­  
mine the independent right of States  
and to consolidate ail power in the  
hands of that government, on which

writing in 1821, at the age of 77, Jefferson gives the date of his taking his seat  
in Congress, which was on the 21st of June, 1775. He then adds: ‘* On the 24th  
a committee which had been appointed to prepare a declaration of the causes of  
taking up arms, brought in their report (drawn I believe by J. Rutledge) which  
not being liked, the House recommitted it on the 26th, and added Mr. Dickinson  
and myself to the committee. ..... I prepared a draught of the Declaration  
committed to us. Jt was too strong for Mr. Dickinson. He still retained the  
hope of reconciliation with the mother country, and was unwilling it should be  
lessened by offensive statement. He was so honest a man, and so able a one,  
that he was greatly indulged even by those who could not feel his scruples. We

at the door of the Queen, whom he calls  
  
“This angel, so gaudily painted in the  
rhapsodies of Rhetorician Burke, with  
  
some smartness of fancy, but no sound  
sense.” She was “ proud, disdainful of re-  
straint, indignant at all obstacles to her  
  
will, eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and  
firm enough to hold _her desires or perish  
in their wreck.” He had ever believed  
that “had there been no Queen there  
would have been no revolution.” His rem-  
edy would have been to shut up the Queen  
in a convent, putting harm out of her pow-  
er, and invest the King with limited pow-  
ers, which he “would have honestly  
exercised according to the measure of his  
understanding.” Another interesting part  
of the autobiography describes the visit to  
  
Franklin, when he lay on “ the bed of sick-  
  
mess from which he never rose.” In it we  
  
have Jefferson’s account of the way in  
which he received the manuscript of  
  
Franklin’s autobiography, and how it  
passed into the hands of Franklin’s grand-  
6on.

“ Here I discontinue my relation of the French Rev-  
olution. The minuteness with which I have so far  
given its details is disproportioned to the general scale  
of my narrative. But I have thought it justified by  
the interest which the whole world must take in this  
revolution. As yet we are but in the first chapter of  
its history. The appeal to the rights of man, which had  
been made in the United States, was taken up by  
France first of the European nations. From her the  
spirit has spread over those of the South. The tyrants  
of the North have allied indeed against it, but it is  
irresistible. Their opposition will only multiply its  
millions of human victims; their own satellites will  
eatch it, and the condition of man thro’ the civilized  
world will be finaliy and greatly ameliorated. This is  
a wonderful instance of great events from small causes.  
So inscrutable is the arrangement of causes and con-  
sequences in this world, that a two-penny duty on tea,  
unjustly imposed in a sequestered part of it, changes  
the condition of all its inhabitants. I have been more  
minute in relating the early transactions of this regen-  
eration, because I was in circumstances peculiarly fav-  
orable for a knowledge of the truth. Possessing the  
confidence and intimacy of the leading patriots, and  
more than all of the Marquis’ Fayette, their heatl and  
Atlas, who had no secrets from me, I learnt with cor-  
rectness the views and proceedings of that party; while  
my intercourse with the diplomatic missionaries of Eu-  
  
  
  
  
  
rope in Paris, all of them with the court and eager in  
prying into its councils and proceedings, gave me a  
knowledge of these also.

« And here I cannot leave this great and good coun-  
try without expressing my sense of its preéminence of  
character among the nations of the earth. A more  
benevolent people I have never known, nor greater  
warmth and devotedness in their select friendships.  
Their kindness and accommodation to strangers is un-  
paralleled, and the hospitality of Paris is beyond any-  
thing I had conceived to be practicable in a large city.  
Their eminence too in science, the communicative dis-  
positions of their scientific men, the politeness of the  
general manners, the ease and vivacity of their conver-  
sation, give a charm to their society to be found no-  
where else. In a comparison of this with other coun-  
tries, we have the proof of primacy which was given to  
Themistocles after the battle of Salamis. Every gen-  
eral voted to himself the first reward of valor, and the  
second to Themistocles. Go ask the travelled inhabit-  
ant of any nation, In what country oa earth would you  
rather live? Certainly in my own, where are all my  
friends, my relations, and the earliest and sweetest af-  
fections and recollections of my life. Which would be  
your second choice? France.”

that it contained no provision against the  
re-eligibility of the President. &quot;My  
fears, &#x27; writes Mr. Jefferson, &quot;of that  
feature were founded on the Importance

&quot; But the practice adopted, I think, is  
better, allowing his continuance for eight  
years, with a liability to be dropped at  
half way of tbe term, making that a  
period of probation.&quot;  
The debates on tbe subject show that  
at the early stage of the session of the  
House tbe opinion prevailed, evidenced  
by a vote of eight against two, to re  
strain the presidential term to seven  
years, and by a B4in pie majority that he  
should be ineligible a second time. 1 bis  
opinion was confirmed by the House as  
late as July 2(J, 1787, referred to the com­  
mittee of detail, reported favorably by  
them, aud changed to tbe present form  
by final vote, on the last day but one  
only of the session. North Carolina pro  
posed that the President should not be  
capable of serving more than eight in  
any term of sixteen years; and though  
this amendment was not adopted, yet  
practice seems to have established it.  
At the time Mr. Jelierson wrote,  
four Presidents had voluntarily retired  
at the end of their eighth year; aud be  
hoped that their example, with the prog­

Now, aristocracy is not dependent for its exist-

nor less than the substitution of the good of the  
few for the good of the whole people, and it ex-

times 50° below the freezing point of Fahrenheit and 22°  
below that of Réaumur. All outdoor labor was sus-  
pended, and the poor, without the wages of labor, were,  
of course, without either bread or fuel. The government  
found its necessities aggravated by that of procuring im-  
mense quantities of firewood and of keeping great fires  
at all the cross streets, around which the people gathered  
in crowds to avoid perishing with cold. Bread, too, was  
to be bought, and distributed daily, gratis, until a relaxa-  
tion of the season should enable the people to work; and  
the slender stock of breadstuff had, for some time, threat-  
ened famine, and had raised that article to an enormous  
price.” So great indeed was the scarcity of bread, that,

nave, Alexandre La Meth, Blacon, Mounier, Maubourg, |  
and Dagout. “They discussed together,” he says, in a  
letter dated September 19, 1789, “their points of difference  
for six hours, and in the course of discussion agreed on  
mutual sacrifices. The effect of this agreement has been !  
considerably defeated by the subsequent proceedings of  
the Assembly, but I do not know that it has been through  
any infidelity of the leaders to the compromise they had  
agreed on.” This conference appears in Jefferson’s Auto-  
biography, composed thirty years later, in the following  
altered and glorified form: “The cloth being removed  
and wine set on the table after the American manner, the  
Marquis [de Lafayette] introduced the objects of the con-  
ference by summarily reminding them of the state of things  
in the Assembly, the course which the principles of the !  
Constitution were taking, and the inevitable result, unless  
checked by more concord among the Patriots themselves.  
  
He observed that, although he also had his opinion, he  
was ready to sacrifice it to that of his brethren of the same  
cause; but that a common opinion must now be formed,  
or the Aristocracy would carry everything, and that what- {  
ever they should now agree on, he, at the head of the  
National force, would maintain. The discussions began at  
the hour of four, and were continued until ten o&#x27;clock in  
the evening, during which time I was a silent witness to  
a coolness and candor of argument unusual in the con

eloquence disfigured by no gaudy tinsel of rhetoric or

Xenophon, by Plato and Cicero. The result was that the  
King should have a suspensive veto on the laws, that the  
legislature should be composed of a single body only, and  
that to be chosen by the people. This Concordate decided  
the fate of the Constitution. The Patriots all rallied to

phy Jefferson lays the whole responsibility of the Revolu-  
tion upon the Queen. The King, he says, would willingly  
have acquiesced in any scheme of government upon which  
the reformers could agree. “ But he had a Queen of abso-  
lute sway over his weak mind and timid virtue, and of a  
character the reverse of his in all points. This angel, as  
gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke, with some  
smartness of fancy but no sound sense, was proud, dis-  
dainful of restraint, indignant of all obstacles to her will,  
eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and firm enough to hold to  
her desires or perish in their wreck. Her inordinate gamb-  
ling and dissipations, with those of the Count d’Artois and  
others of her clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaus-  
tion of the treasury, which called into action the reforming  
hand of the nation; and her opposition to it, her inflexible  
perverseness and dauntless spirit, led herself to the guillo-  
tine, drew the King on with her, and plunged the world  
into crimes and calamities which will forever stain the

pages of modern history. I have ever believed, that had  
there been no Queen, there would have been no revolution.  
No force would have been provoked, nor exercised. The  
King would have gone hand in hand with the wisdom of  
his sounder counsellors, who, guided by the increased lights  
of the age, wished only, with the same pace, to advance  
the principles of their social constitution. The deed which  
closed the mortal course of these sovereigns, I shall neither  
approve nor condemn. .. . I should not have voted with  
this portion of the legislature [the portion that decreed the  
death of Louis XVI]. I should have shut up the Queen  
in a convent, putting harm out of her power, and placed  
the King in his station, investing him with limited powers,  
which, I verily believe, he would have honestly exercised.  
In this way no void would have been created, courting the  
usurpation of a military adventurer, nor occasion given for  
those enormities which demoralized the nations of the  
world, and destroyed and is yet to destroy millions and  
millions of its inhabitants.” *  
  
So tremendous an estimate of the Queen is to be found  
nowhere in the contemporary letters of Jefferson. He  
says, indeed, in one place, “the queen weeps, but sins on,”  
and in another, speaking of the reactionary intrigues before  
the Royal Session of June 23, that the Queen and the  
Princes are infatuated enough to hazard almost anything.’  
But these are almost the only references to the Queen, and  
are not weighty enough to make her the cause of the great

JEFFeRSON&#x27;s CoLD reCEPTIOoN AT COURT.  
&quot;In February, 1786, Mr. Adams wrote to me.  
pressingly, to join him in London immediately.  
as he thought he discerned there some symp­  
toms of bitter disposition toward us. I accord­  
ingly left Paris on the 1st of March, and on my  
arrival in London, we agreed on a very summary  
form of treaty, proposing an exchange of citizen­  
ship for our own citizens, our ships, and our  
productions generally, except as to office. On  
my presentation, as usual, to the King and  
Queen, at their levees, it was impossible for  
anything to be more ungracious than their  
notice of Mr. Adams and myself. I saw at once  
that the ulceration of mind in that quarter left  
nothing to be expected on the subject of my at­  
tendance, and on the first conference with the  
Marquis Caermarthen, their Minister of Foreign  
Affairs, the distance and disinclination which he  
betrayed in his conversation, the vagueness and  
evasions of his answers to us, confirmed me in  
the belief of their aversion to have anything to  
do with us. We afterward, by one or more notes,  
requested his appointment of an interview and  
conference, which, without directly declining.  
he evaded by pretences of other pressing occupa­

“In February, 1786, Mr. Adams ‘wrote to

less in reference to the events of the Revolu­  
tion. For instance, in his autoblography, Jeffer­  
son lays the whole responsibility of the Revolu­  
tion upon the Queen. The King, he says, would  
willingly have acquiesced in any scheme of gov.­  
ernment upon which the reformers could agree.  
&quot;But he had a Queen of absolute sway over his  
weak mind and timid virtue, and of a character  
the reverse of his in all points. This angel, as  
she is gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke,  
with some smartness of fancy, but no sound  
sense, was prond, disdainful of restraint, indig­  
nant of all obstacles to her will, eager in the pur­  
suit of pleasure and firm enough to hold to her  
desires or perish in their wreck. Her inordi­  
nate gainbling and dissipations, with those  
of the Count d&#x27;Artols and others of her  
clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaus­  
tion of the Treasury, which called into action the  
reforming hand of the nation; and her opposi­  
tion to it, her inflexible perverseness and daunt­  
less spirit, led her to the guiilotine, drew the  
King on with her, and plunged the world into  
crimes and calamities which will forever stain  
the pages of modern history. I have ever believed  
that, had there been no Queen, there would have  
been no revolution. No force would have been  
provoked or exercised. The King would have  
gone hand in hand with the wisdom of his  
sounder counsellors, who, guided by the in­  
creased lights of the age, wished only, with the  
same pace, to advance the principles of their  
social constitution. The deed which closed the  
mortal course of these sovereigns I shall neither

Day after day was wasted on the most unimportant  
questions. I served with General Washing-

never heard either of them speak ten minutes at a

decide the question. They laid their shoulders to the  
great points, knowing that the little ones would fol-  
low of themselves. If the present Congress errs in  
too much talking how can it be otherwise in a body  
to which the people send 150 lawyers, whose trade is  
to question everything, yield nothing and talk by the

In 1784 the Federal Congress, just before it  
ejeurnment at Annapolis on June 3 to meet in  
Trenton on Oct. 30, appointed a &quot;Committee of  
the States,&quot; which was authorized to carry on  
the Government during the interim.

 &quot;As the Confederation had made no provision

2e vacations of Congress, and such a one was nece  
 essary to superintend the executive business, to  
 receive and communicate with foreign Minis-  
61 ters and nations, and to assemble Congress on  
4at sudden, extraordinary emergencies, I proposed  
 early in April (1784) the appointment of a come  
09, mittee of the States,&quot; to consist of a member  
40s from each State, who should remain in session  
 during the recess of Congress; that the func-

5y tive and legislative, the lattor to be reserved,  
$ and the former, by a general resolution, to be  
 delegated to that committee.

an who has been in active bust­  
ness for forty years, who has lived in Ouba  
and has a clear idea of what freedom means to  
the wretched inhabitants of that island, and  
what its freedom means to the United States  
something very few of our people are able to  
comprehend yet.  
The present &quot;wind-mill&quot; attitude of some  
members of the United States Senate recalls the  
judgment expressed by Thomas Jefferson con­  
cerning an earlier manifestation of the sort.  
On the 26th and 27th of December, 1783, Con­  
gress debated the Treaty with Great Britain.  
Jefferson used this language in describing the  
proceedings:  
Our body was little numerous, but very conten­  
tious. Day after day was wasted on the most unim­  
portant questions. A member, one of those afflicted  
with the morbid rage of debate, of an ardent mind,  
prompt imagination, a copious flow of words, who  
heard with impatience any logic which was not his  
own, sitting near me on some occasion of a trifling.  
but wordy, dobate, asked me how I could sit  
in silence hearing so much false reasoning,  
which a word would refute? I observed to  
him that to refute, indeed, was easy, but to  
silence impossible; that in measures brought forward  
by myself, I took the laboring oar, as was inoumbent  
on me; but that in general I was willing to listen;  
that if every sound argument or objection was used  
by some one or other of the numerous debaters, it  
was enough; if not, I thought it sufficient to suggest  
the omission, without going into a repetition of what  
had been already said by others; that this was a  
waste and abuse of the time and patience of the  
House which could not be justiffed. And I bolieve  
that if members of deliborate bodies were to observe  
this course generally they would do in a day what  
takes them a week; and it is really more questiona­  
ble than may be at first thought whether Bonaparte&#x27;s  
dumb Legislature, which said nothing and did much,  
may not be preferable to one which talks much and  
does nothing.  
I served with Genr Washington in the Legislature  
of Virginia before the Revolution, and during it  
with Dr. Frankiin in Congress. I never heard either  
of them speak ten minutes at a time, nor to any but  
the main point, which was to decide the question.  
They laid their shoulders to the great points, know-  
ing that the little ones would follow of themselves.

That it Would Undermine State  
Rights.  
Mnntieello, January 0. IK2I.  
But there was another amendment, of  
which none of us thought at tlu* time,  
and in the omission of which lurks tin*  
germ that is to destroy this happy com­  
bination of national powers in tin* Gen­  
eral Government, f*»r matters of na­  
tional concern, and independent powers  
in the States, for what concerns the  
States severally. In England it was a  
great point gained at tin* revolution,  
that the commissions of the judges,  
which had hitherto been during pleasure,  
should thenceforth be made during  
good behavior. A judiciary dependent  
on the king had proved itself tlu* most  
oppressive of all tools in the hands « f  
that magistrate. Nothing, then, could  
be more salutary than a change there to  
the tenure of good behavior, and the  
question of good behavior left to Un­  
vote of a simple majority in the two  
Houses of Parliament. Before the rev­  
olution we were all good English Whigs,  
cordial in their free principles and in  
their jealousies of their executive magis­  
trate. These jealousies are very appa  
rent in all our State constitutions, and  
in the General Government, in ibis in­  
stance. we have gone even beyond the  
English caution, by requiring a vote of  
two-thirds in one of the Houses for re­  
moving a judge—a vote so impossible,  
where any defense is made before men of  
ordinary prejudices and passions, that  
our judges are effectually independent  
o. the nation. But this ought not to  
be. I Would not, indeed, make them de­  
pendent on tin* executive authority, ns  
they formerly were in England, but I  
deem it indispensable to tlu* continu­  
ance of this government that they should  
he submitted to some practical and im­  
partial control, and that this, to bo im­  
parted. must be compounded of a mix­  
ture of State and Federal authorities.  
It is not enough that honest men are ap­  
pointed judges. All know the influence  
of interest on the mind of man. and how  
unconsciously his judgment is warped by  
that influence. To this bias add that of  
the “esprit de corps,’’ of their peculiar  
maxim and creed, that “it is the office  
of a good judge to enlarge his jurisdic­  
tion,” and the absence of responsibility,  
and how can we expect impartial decis­  
ion between the General Government, of  
which they are themselves so eminent  
a part, and an individual State, from  
which they have nothing to hope for?  
We have seen, too, that, contrary to ill  
correct example, they are in tin* habit  
of going out of the question before them,  
to throw the anchor ahead, and grapple  
farther hold for future advances of  
power. They are, then, in fact, the  
corps of sappers and miners, steadily  
working to undermine the independent  
rights of the States and to consolidate  
all powers in the hands of that govern­  
ment in which they have so important a  
freehold estate. But it is not by the  
consolidation or concentration of pow­  
ers, but by their distribution, that good  
government is effected. Were not this  
great country already divided into  
States, that division must be made, that  
each might do for itself whit concerns  
itself directly, and what it can so much  
better no than a distant authority. Ev­  
ery State, again, is divided into coun­  
ties. each to take care of what lies with­  
in its local bounds; each comity, again

rights of the States, and to consolidate  
all powers in the hands of that govern­  
ment in which they have so important  
a freehold estate. As for the safety of  
society, we commit honest maniacs to  
Bedlam, so judges should be with-,  
drawn from their bench, whose erron­  
eous biases are leading us to dissolu­  
tion. It may, indeed, injure them in  
fume or in fortune; but it saves the  
republic, which is the first and supreme  
law.
