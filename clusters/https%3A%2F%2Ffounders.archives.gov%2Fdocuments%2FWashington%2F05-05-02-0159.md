 Hope You do Not impute it to Any fault on My part—In these time of troubles, it Has Become More difficult to Know, or to Reach Opportunities, and How this Will be Carried I leave to the Care of Mr Payne Who Goes to London.  
Our Revolution is Getting on as Well as it Can With a Nation that Has Swalled up liberty all at once, and is still liable to Mistake licentiousness for freedom—the Assembly Have More Hatred to the Ancient System than Experience on the proper Organisation of a New, and Constitutional Governement—the Ministers are lamenting the loss of power, and Affraid to use that which they Have—and As Every thing has been destroied and Not much New Building is Yet Above Ground, there is Much Room for Critics and Calomnies.  
to this May be Added that We still are Pestered By two parties, the Aristocratic that is panting for a Counter Revolution, and the factious Which Aims at the division of the Empire, and destruction of all Authority and perhaps of the lifes of the Reigning Branch, Both of which parties are fomenting troubles.  
And after I Have Confessed all that, My dear General, I will tell you With the Same Candour that We Have Made an Admirable, and Almost incredible destruction of all abuses, prejudices, &amp;c. &amp;c. that Every thing Not directly Useful to, or Coming from the people Has been levelled—that in the topographical, Moral, political Situation of France We Have Made More changes in ten Month than the Most Sanguine patriot could  
  
Have imagined—that our internal troubles and Anarchy are Much Exagerated—and that upon the Whole this Revolution, in which Nothing will be wanting But Energy of Governement just as it was in America, Will propagate implant liberty and Make it flourish throughout the world, while We must wait for a Convension in a few years to Mend Some defects which are not Now perceived By Men just Escaped from Aristocracy and despotism.  
You know that the Assembly Have adjourned the Westindia affairs, leaving Every thing in the Actual State, Viz.—the ports oppened as We Hear they Have Been to American trade. But it was impossible, circumstanced as We are, to take a definitive Resolve on that Matter—the Ensuing legislature will More Easily determine, after they Have Received the demands of the Colonies who Have Been Invited to Make them, particularly on the object of Victualling.  
Give me leave, My dear General, to present you With a picture of the Bastille just as it looked a few days after I Had ordered its demolition, with the Main Kea of that fortress of despotism—it is a tribute Which I owe as A Son to My Adoptive father, as an aid de Camp to My General, as a Missionary of liberty to its patriarch.  
Adieu, My Beloved General, My Most Affectionate Respects Wait on Mrs Washington, present me most affectionately to George, to Hamilton, Knox, Harrison, Jay, Humphrey and all friends Most tenderly an

that they should know it, and to be free that they should will to be so.” But  
hopeful words could not blind him to facts, and a comparison of hb letters to  
Washington, written after the capture of the Bastille, and again not many months  
later, wUl show his real opinion of the state of things. Early in 1790 he writes:  
“ Our revolution b getting on as well as it can with a nation that has attained its  
liberty at once, and is still liable to mbtake licentiousness for freedom. The  
Assembly have more hatred of the ancient system than experience in the proper  
organisation of a new and constitutional government. The minbters are lament¬  
ing their loss of power, and afraid to use that which they have; and as every  
thing has been destroyed, and not much of the new building b yet above grounc^  
there is room for criticism and calumnies. To this it may be added that we are  
still pestered by two parties—^the aristocratic, which is still panting for a counter¬  
revolution, and the factious, w’hich sums at the divbion of the empire and destruc¬  
tion of all authority, and perhaps of the lives of the reigning branch; both of  
which sure fomenting troubles. After I have explained this to you, I will tell  
you with the ssune candour that we have made an admirable, suid almost incre¬  
dible destruction of almost all abuses and prejudices; that everything not directly  
useful to, or coming from the people, has been levelled; that in this topographical,  
moral, and politick situation of France we have m^e more changes in ten  
months than the most sanguine patriot could have imsigined ; that our internal  
troubles and suisnchy are much exsiggerated; and that upon the whole thb revo¬  
lution, in which nothing will be wanting except energy of government, as it wras  
in America, will implant hberty, suid make it flourish through the world; while  
we must wait for a W yesurs for a convention to mend some defects, which are  
now perceived by men just escaped from wistocracy and despotbm.”
