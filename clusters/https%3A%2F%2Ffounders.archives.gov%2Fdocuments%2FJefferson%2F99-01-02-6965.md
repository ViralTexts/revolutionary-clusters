ral Assembly of Rhode-island  
  
Dec. 10. 1807.  
  
I recieved in due season the Address of the General assembly of Rhode island, bearing date the 27th. of  
February last, in which, with their approbation of the general course of my administration, they were so good as to  
express their desire that I would consent to be proposed again to the public voice, on the expiration of my present term  
of office. entertaining, as I do, for the General assembly of Rhode-island those sentiments of high respect which would  
have prompted an immediate answer, I was certain, nevertheless, they would approve a delay which had for it’s object to  
avoid a premature agitation of the public mind, on a subject so interesting as the election of a chief magistrate.  
That I should lay down my charge at a proper period is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully. if some  
termination to the services of the Chief magistrate be not fixed by the constitution, or supplied by practice, his office,  
nominally for years, will, in fact, become for life; and history shews how easily that degenerates into an inheritance.  
believing that a representative government, responsible at short periods of election, is that which produces the greatest  
sum of happiness to mankind, I feel it a duty to do no act which shall essentially impair that principle; and I should  
unwillingly be the person who, disregarding the sound precedent set by an illustrious predecessor, should furnish the  
first example of prolongation beyond the second term of office.  
Truth also requires me to add that I am sensible of that decline which advancing years bring on; and feeling  
their Physical, I ought not to doubt their Mental effect. happy if I am the first to percieve &amp; to obey this admonition  
of nature, and to sollicit a retreat from cares too great for the wearied faculties of age.  
For the approbation which the General assembly of Rhode-island has been pleased to express of the principles  
and measures pursued in the management of their affairs, I am sincerely thankful and should I be so fortunate as to carry  
into retirement the equal approbation &amp; good will of my fellow citizens generally, it will be the comfort of my future  
days, and will close a service of forty years with the only reward it ever wished.

day and night:  
&quot;DEC, 10, 1807.  
&quot;To the Legislature of Fermont.  
&quot;I received in due season the address of  
the Legislature of Vermont, bearing date  
the 5th of November, 1806, in which, with  
their approbation of the general course of  
my administration, they were so good as  
to express their desire that I would con­  
sent to be proposed again to the public

had for its object to avoid a premature  
agitation of the public mind on a subject  
  
so interesting as the election of a chief

&quot;That I should lay down my charge at a  
proper period is as much a duty as to have  
borne it faithfully. If some termination  
to the services of the chief magistrate be  
not fixed by the Constitution, or supplied

Happy if I am the first to perceive and to

&quot;For the approbation which the Legisla­

I am sincerely thankful; and should I be
