ork, December, 1800]  
  
Your last letter, My Dear Sir, has given me great pain; not only because it informed me that the opinion in favour of Mr. Burr was increasing among the Fœderalists, but because it also told me that Mr. Sedgwick was one of its partizans. I have a letter from this Gentleman in which he expresses decidedly his preference of Mr. Jefferson. I hope you have been mistaken and that it is not possible for him to have been guilty of so great duplicity.  
There is no circumstance which has occurred in the course of our political affairs that has given me so much pain as the idea that Mr. Burr might be elevated to the Presidency by the means of the Fœderalists. I am of opinion that this party has hitherto solid claims of merit with the public and so long as it does nothing to forfeit its title to confidence I shall continue to hope that our misfortunes are temporary and that the party will ere long emerge from its depression. But if it shall act a foolish or unworthy part in any capital instance, I shall then despair.  
Such without doubt will be the part it will act, if it shall seriously attempt to support Mr. Burr in opposition to Mr. Jefferson. If it fails, as after all is not improbable, it will have rivetted the animosity of that person, will have destroyed or weakened the motives to moderation which he must at present feel and it will expose them to the disgrace of a defeat in an attempt to elevate to the first place in the Government one of the worst men in the community. If it succeeds, it will have done nothing more nor less than place in that station a man who will possess the boldness and daring necessary to give success to the Jacobin system instead of one who for want of that quality will be less fitted to promote it.  
Let it not be imagined that Mr. Burr can be won to the Fœderal Views. It is a vain hope. Stronger ties, and stronger inducements than they can offer, will impel him in a different direction. His ambition will not be content with those objects which virtuous men of either party will allot to it, and his situation and his habits will oblige him to have recourse to corrupt expedients, from which he will be restrained by no moral scruples. To accomplish his ends he must lean upon unprincipled men and will continue to adhere to the myrmidons who have hitherto seconded him. To these he will no doubt add able rogues of the Fœderal party; but he will employ the rogues of all parties to overrule the good men of all parties and to prosecute projects which wise men of every description will disapprove.  
These things are to be inferred with moral certainty from the character of the man. Every step in his career proves that he has formed himself upon the model of Catiline, and he is too coldblo[o]ded and too determined a conspirator ever to change his plan.  
What would you think of these toasts and this conversation at his Table within the last three or four weeks   1   The French Republic—2   The Commissioners on both sides who negotiated the Convention—3   Buonaparte   4   la Fayette. What would you think of his having seconded the positions that it was the interest of this country to allow the belligerent powers to bring in and sell their prizes and build and equip ships in our ports? Do you not see in this the scheme of War with Great Britain as the instrument of Power and Wealth? Can it be doubted that a man who has all his life speculated upon the popular prejudices will consult them in the object of a War when he thinks it expedient to make one? Can a man who despising democracy has chimed in with all its absurdities be diverted from the plan of Ambition which must have directed this course? They who suppose it must understand little of human nature.  
If Jefferson is President the whole responsibility of bad measures will rest with the Anti-fœderalists. If Burr is made so by the Fœderalists the whole responsibility will rest with them. The other party will say to the People. We intended him only for Vice President. Here he might have done very well or been at least harmless. But the Fœderalists to disappoint us and a majority of you took advantage of a momentary superiority to put him in the first place. He is therefore their President and they must answer for all the Evils of his bad conduct. And the People will believe them.  
Will any reasonable calculation on the part of the Fœderalists uphold the policy of assuming so great a responsibility in the support of so unpromising a character?  
The negative is so manifest that had I not been assured of the contrary I should have thought it impossible that assent to it would have been attended with a moments’ hesitation.  
Alas! when will men consult their reason rather than their passions? Whatever they may imagine the desire of mortifying the adverse party must be the chief spring of the disposition to prefer Mr. Burr. This disposition reminds me of the conduct of the Dutch monied men who from hatred of the old Aristocracy favoured the admission of the French into Holland to overturn every thing.  
Adieu to the Fœderal Troy if they once introduce this Grecian Horse into their Citadel.  
Trust me my Dear friend. You cannot render a greater service to your country than to resist this project. Far better will it be to endeavour to obtain from Jefferson assurances on some cardinal points—1 The preservation of the actual Fiscal System   2   Adherence to the Neutral plan.   3   The preservation &amp; gradual increase of the Navy   4   The continuance of our friends in the offices they fill except in the great departments in which he ought to be left free.  
Adieu My Dr. Sir   Yrs. ever

Ler it not be imagined that Mr. Burr can be won to

strenger inducements than they can offer will impel

&quot;December 17, 1800.  
&quot;Your last letter, my dear sir, litis given me great  
pain; not only lieoause it informed me that the opinion  
in favor of Mr. Burr was increasing among the  
federalists, hut because it was also told me that  
Mr. was one of his partisans. 1 have n letter  
from this gentleman, in which he expresses decidedly  
his preference of Mr. Jefferson. 1 hope you  
have been mistaken, and that it is not possible for  
him to have been guiliy of s &gt; great dupli.city.  
&quot;There is no circumstance which has occurred in  
the course of our political uffdirs, that has given me  
so much pain as the idea that Mr. Burr might be  
elected to the presinency by the means of federalists.  
I am of opinion that this party has hitherto solid  
claims of merit with the public; and so long as it  
does nothing to forfeit its title (o confidence, I shall  
continue to hone that our misfortunes are temporary,  
and thut the party will ere lung emerge from its  
depression. But if it shall act a foolish or unworthy  
part it uny capital instance, 1 shall then despair.  
&quot;Such, without doubt, will be the part it will act,  
if it shall Eeiioualy attempt to support Mr. Burr in  
opposition to Mr- Jefferson. If it fails, as after all  
is not improbable, it will have rivalled the animosity  
of that person?will have destroyed or weakened the  
motives to moderation which he must at present  
frsl?and it will expose ihem to the disgrace of a  
defeat in an attempt to elevate to the first place in  
the government one of the worst men in tne community.  
&quot;If it succeeds, it will have done nothing more  
nor lest than place in that atation a man who will  
possess the boldness and daring necessary to give  
success to the Jacobin system, instead of one who,  
for want of that quality, will be less fitted to promole  
it.  
&quot;Let it not be imagined that Mr. Burr can be won  
to the federal views. It ia a vain hope. Stronger  
ties and stronger inducements than they can offer  
will impel him in a different direction. His ambition  
will not be content with those objects which  
virtuous men of either party will allot to it, and his  
situation, and his habits. Will oblige him to have recourse  
to corrupt expedients, from which he will lie  
restrained by no moral scruples. To accomplish  
his ends he mdat lean upon unprincipled men, and  
will continue to adhere to the myrmidons who have  
hitherto surrounded him. To these he will, no  
doubt, add able rogues of the federal party; but he  
will employ the rogues of all parties to overrule the.  
good men of all parties, and to prosecute projects  
which wise men of every description will disapprove.  
&quot;These things are to be inferred with moral certainty  
from the character of the in.tn. Every step  
  
in niM career proves mni ne mis lormea ntmsetr upon  
the model of Catiline; and lie is too cold-blooded,  
end too determined a conspirator, ever to change  
his plan.  
&quot;If Jefferson is President, the whole responsibility  
of bad measures will rest with the anti-federalisls  
If Burr is made so by the federalists, the whole responsibility  
will rest with them. The other party  
will say to the people, we intended him only for  
Vice President; here he might have done very well,  
and been at least harmless. But the federalists, to  
disappoint us and a majority of you, took advantage  
of a momentary superiority to put him in the  
first place. He is, therefore, their President, and  
they must answer for all the evils of his bad conduct;  
and the people will believe tliern.  
&quot;Will any reasonable calculation on the part of the  
federalists uphold the policy of assuming so great a  
responsibility in the support of so unpromising a  
character? The negative is so manifest, that, had I  
not been assured of the contrary, 1 should have  
thought it impossible that assent to it would have  
bcen attended with a moment&#x27;s hesitation.  
&quot;Alas! when will men consult their reason rather  
than their passions? Whatever they may imagine,  
the desire of mortifying the adverse party must lie the  
chief spring of their disposition to prefer Mr. Burr.  
This disposition reminds me of the conduct of thr  
Dutch moneyed men, who, from hatred to the old  
aristocracy, favored the adiuis-ion of the French into  
Holland to overturn everything.  
&quot;Adieu to the federal Troy, if they once introduce  
  
this Grecian horse into their citadel.  
&#x27; Trust me, very dtor friend, you cannot render a  
greater service In your country than to reaist this  
projeet. Far better will it be to endeavor to obtain  
from Jefferson assurances on some cardinal points  
1. The preservation of the actual fiscal system, ii

2.—The Same to the Same.  
  
Your last letter has given me great pain—not  
only because it informed me that the opinion in  
favor of B. was increasing among the F&#x27;s, but be-  
cause it also told me that M&#x27;. Sedgwick was one  
  
of its partisans. I have a letter from this gentle-  
man in which he expresses decidedly his opinion  
in favor of M&#x27; Jeffers&quot;. I hope you have been  
mistaken and that it is not possible for him to  
have been guilty of so great duplicity.  
  
There is no circumstance, which has occurred  
in the course of our political affairs, that has giv-  
en me so much pain, as the idea that M&#x27; Burr  
might be elected to the Presidency by the means  
of the Federalists. Iam of opinion that this par-  
ty has hitherto solid claims of merit with the pub-  
  
‘lic; and so long as it does nothing to forfeit its  
title to confidence, I shall continue to hope that  
our misfortunes are temporary, &amp; that the party  
will ere long emerge from its depression. But  
if it shall act a foolish or unworthy part in any  
capital instance I shall then despair. Such with-  
out doubt, will be the part it will act, if it shall  
seriously attempt to support B. in opposition to J.  
—If it fails, as after all is not improbable, it will  
have rivetted the animosity of that person will  
have destroyed or weakened the motives to mod-  
eration, which he must at present feel &amp; it will ex-  
pose them to the disgrace of a defeat in an at-  
tempt to elect to the first place in the government  
  
  
  
one of the worst men in the community. If it  
succeeds it will have done nothing more nor less  
than place in that station a man who will possess  
the boldness and daring necessary to give success  
to the jacobin system, instead of one who, for  
want of that quality, will be less fitted to promote  
it.  
  
Let it not be imagined that B. can be won to  
the federal views. Itisa vain hope. Stronger  
ties and stronger inducements than they can offer,  
will impel him in a different direction. His ambi-  
tion will not be content with those objects, which  
virtuous men of either party will allot to it, and  
his situation and habits will oblige him to havere-  
course to corrupt expedients from which he will  
be restrained by no moral scruples. To accom-  
plish his ends he must lean upon unprincipled  
men, &amp; will continue to adhere to the myrmidons,  
who have hitherto surrounded him. To these he  
will, no doubt, add able rogues of the federal  
party: but he will employ the rogues of all par-  
ties to over match the good men of all parties and  
to prosecute projects which wise men of every des-  
cription will disapprove.  
  
These things are to be inferred with moral cer-  
tainty from the character of the man. Every  
step in his career proves that he has formed hjm-  
self upon the model of Cataline; and he is too  
cold-blooded &amp; too determined a conspirator to  
change his plan.  
  
What would you think of these toasts &amp; this con-  
versation at his tabie within the last three or four  
weeks—1. The French Republic—2. The Com-  
miss&quot;* on both sides who negotiated the Convention  
—8. Bonaparte &amp; Lafayette ?—What would you  
think of his having seconded the positions that  
it was for the interest of the country to allow the  
belligerent powers to bring in &amp; sell their prizes  
and build &amp; equip shipsin our ports?) Can it be  
doubted that a man who has all his life speculat-  
ed upon the popular prejudices will consult them  
in the object of a war when he thinks it expedi-  
ent tomake one? Can a man, who, despising  
  
| democracy, has chimed in with all its absurdi-  
  
ties, be diverted from the plans of ambition which  
must have directed its course? They who sup-  
pose it must understand little of human nature.  
  
If Jeff. is president, the whole responsibility  
of bad measures will rest with the Anti-fed&#x27;*. If  
B. is made so by the Feds, the whole responsibil-  
ity will rest with them. The other party willsay  
to the people, ‘‘ we intended him only for the V.  
‘*P, here he might have done very well, or at least  
“been harmless ; but the Feds. to disappoint us &amp;  
‘*a majority of you, took advantage of a moment-  
‘‘ary expedient to put him in the first place. He  
‘* is therefore their pres‘ and they must answer for  
‘* all the evils of his bad conduct :” and the peo-  
ple will believe them.  
  
Will any reasonable calculation on the part of  
  
  
  
260 HISTORICAL  
  
the feds. uphold the policy of assuming so great |  
  
a responsibility in the support of so unpromising  
a character? The negative is so manifest, that  
had I not been assured of the contrary, I should |  
have thought it impossible that assent to it would |  
have been attended with a moment&#x27;s hesitatiun.  
  
Alas! when will men consult their reason rather  
than their passions? Whatever they may imag-  
ine, the desire of mortifying the adverse party |  
must be the chief spring of the disposition to  
prefer Mr. B. This disposition reminds me of the  
conduct of the Dutch moneyed-men, who from  
hatred to the old aristocracy favored the admission  
of the French into Holland to overturn everything  
Adieu to the Federal Troy if they introduce this  
Grecian horse into their citadel.  
  
Trust me, my dear friend, you cannot render a  
greater service to your country than to resist this  
project. Far better will it be to obtain from J,  
assurances on some cardinal points—1 The pres-  
ervation of the actual fiscal system. 2 Adher-  
ence to the neutral plan, 8 The preservation &amp;  
gradual increase of the Navy. 4 The continu-  
ance of our friends in the offices they now fill,  
except in the great departments, in which he  
ought to be left free. Adieu my dear Sir,
