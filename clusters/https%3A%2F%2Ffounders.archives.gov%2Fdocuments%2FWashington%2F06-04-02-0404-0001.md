[Mount Vernon, 9 July 1799]  
  
In the name of God amen I George Washington of Mount Vernon—a citizen of the United States, and lately Pr⟨es⟩ident of the same, do make, ordai⟨n⟩ and declare this Instrument; w⟨hic⟩h is written with my own hand ⟨an⟩d every page thereof subscribed ⟨wit⟩h my name, to be my last Will &amp; ⟨Tes⟩tament, revoking all others.  
⟨I⟩mprimus. All my ⟨deb⟩ts, of which there are but few, and none of magnitude, are to be punctu⟨al⟩ly and speedily paid—and the Legaci⟨es he⟩reinafter bequeathed, are to be disc⟨ha⟩rged as soon as circumstances will ⟨pe⟩rmit, and in the manner directe⟨d⟩.  
⟨I⟩tem. To my dearl⟨y be⟩loved wife Martha Washington ⟨I⟩ give and bequeath the use, profit ⟨an⟩d benefit of my whole Estate, real and p⟨er⟩sonal, for the term of her natural li⟨fe⟩—except such parts thereof as are sp⟨e⟩cifically disposed of hereafter: ⟨My i⟩mproved lot in the Town of Alex⟨andria, situated on⟩ Pitt &amp; Cameron ⟨streets, I give to her and⟩ her heirs forev⟨er; as I also do my⟩ household &amp; Kitc⟨hen⟩ furniture of every sort &amp; kind, with the liquors and groceries which may be on hand at the time of my decease; to be used &amp; disposed of as she may think proper.  
  
⟨Ite⟩m Upon the decease ⟨of⟩ my wife, it is my Will &amp; desire th⟨at⟩ all the Slaves which I hold in ⟨my⟩ own right, shall receive their free⟨dom⟩. To emancipate them during ⟨her⟩ life, would, tho’ earnestly wish⟨ed by⟩ me, be attended with such insu⟨pera⟩ble difficulties on account of thei⟨r interm⟩ixture by Marriages with the ⟨dow⟩er Negroes, as to excite the most pa⟨in⟩ful sensations, if not disagreeabl⟨e c⟩onsequences from the latter, while ⟨both⟩ descriptions are in the occupancy ⟨of⟩ the same Proprietor; it not being ⟨in⟩ my power, under the tenure by which ⟨th⟩e Dower Negroes are held, to man⟨umi⟩t them. And whereas among ⟨thos⟩e who will recieve freedom ac⟨cor⟩ding to this devise, there may b⟨e so⟩me, who from old age or bodily infi⟨rm⟩ities, and others who on account of ⟨the⟩ir infancy, that will be unable to ⟨su⟩pport themselves; it is m⟨y Will and de⟩sire that all who ⟨come under the first⟩ &amp; second descrip⟨tion shall be comfor⟩tably cloathed &amp; ⟨fed by my heirs while⟩ they live; and that such of the latter description as have no parents living, or if living are unable, or unwilling to provide for them, shall be bound by the Court until they shall arrive at the ag⟨e⟩ of twenty five years; and in cases where no record can be produced, whereby their ages can be ascertained, the judgment of the Court, upon its own view of the subject, shall be adequate and final. The Negros thus bound, are (by their Masters or Mistresses) to be taught to read &amp; write; and to be brought up to some useful occupation, agreeably to the Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, providing for the support of Orphan and other poor Children. and I do hereby expressly forbid the Sale, or transportation out of the said Commonwealth, of any Slave I may die possessed of, under any pretence whatsoever. And I do moreover most pointedly, and most solemnly enjoin it upon my Executors hereafter named, or the Survivors of them, to see that th⟨is cla⟩use respecting Slaves, and every part thereof be religiously fulfilled at the Epoch at which it is directed to take place; without evasion, neglect or delay, after the Crops which may then be on the ground are harvested, particularly as it respects the aged and infirm; seeing that a regular and permanent fund be established for their support so long as there are subjects requiring it; not trusting to the ⟨u⟩ncertain provision to be made by individuals. And to my Mulatto man William (calling himself William Lee) I give immediate freedom; or if he should prefer it (on account of the accidents which ha⟨v⟩e befallen him, and which have rendered him  
  
incapable of walking or of any active employment) to remain in the situation he now is, it shall be optional in him to do so: In either case however, I allow him an annuity of thirty dollars during his natural life, whic⟨h⟩ shall be independent of the victuals and cloaths he has been accustomed to receive, if he chuses the last alternative; but in full, with his freedom, if he prefers the first; &amp; this I give him as a test⟨im⟩ony of my sense of his attachment to me, and for his faithful services during the Revolutionary War.  
Item. To the Trustees (⟨Go⟩vernors, or by whatsoever other name they may be designated) of the Academy in the Town of Alexandria, I give and bequeath, in Trust, four thousand dollars, or in other words twenty of the shares which I hold in the Bank of Alexandria, towards the support of a Free school established at, and annexed to, the said Academy; for the purpose of Educating such Orphan children, or the children of such other poor and indigent persons as are unable to accomplish it with their own means; and who, in the judgment of the Trustees of the said Seminary, are best entitled to the benefit of this donation. The aforesaid twenty shares I give &amp; bequeath in perpetuity; the dividends only of which are to be drawn for, and applied by the said Trustees for the time being, for the uses above mentioned; the stock to remain entire and untouched; unless indications of a failure of the said Bank should be so apparent, or a discontinuance thereof should render a removal of this fund necessary; in either of these cases, the amount of the Stock here devised, is to be vested in some other Bank or public Institution, whereby the interest may with regularity &amp; certainty be drawn, and applied as above. And to prevent misconception, my meaning is, and is hereby declared to be, that these twenty shares are in lieu of, and not in addition to, the thousand pounds given by a missive letter some years ago; in consequence whereof an annuity of fifty pounds has since been paid towards the support of this Institution.  
Item. Whereas by a Law of the Commonwealth of Virginia, enacted in the year 1785, the Legislature thereof was pleased (as an evidence of Its approbation of the services I had rendered the Public during the Revolution—and partly, I believe, in consideration of my having suggested the vast advantages which the Community would derive from the ex⟨te⟩nsions of its Inland Navigation, under Legislative patronage) to present me with one hundred shares of one hundred dollars each, in the incorporated  
  
company established for the purpose of extending the navigation of James River from tide water to the Mountains: and also with fifty shares of one hundred pounds Sterling each, in the Corporation of another company, likewise established for the similar purpose of opening the Navigation of the River Potomac from tide water to Fort Cumberland, the acceptance of which, although the offer was highly honourable, and grateful to my feelings, was refused, as inconsistent with a principle which I had adopted, and had never departed from—namely—not to receive pecuniary compensation for any services I could render my country in its arduous struggle with great Britain, for its Rights; and because I had evaded similar propositions from other States in the Union; adding to this refusal, however, an intimation that, if it should be the pleasure of the Legislature to permit me to appropriate the said shares to public uses, I would receive them on those terms with due sensibility; and this it having consented to, in flattering terms, as will appear by a subsequent Law, and sundry resolutions, in the most ample and honourable manner, I proceed after this recital, for the more correct understanding of the case, to declare—  
That as it has always been a source of serious regret with me, to see the youth of these United States sent to foreign Countries for the purpose of Education, often before their minds were formed, or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of their own; contracting, too frequently, not only habits of dissipation &amp; extravagence, but principles unfriendly to Republican Governmt and to the true &amp; genuine liberties of Mankind; which, thereafter are rarely overcome. For these reasons, it has been my ardent wish to see a plan devised on a liberal scale, which would have a tendency to sprd systemactic ideas through all parts of this rising Empire, thereby to do away local attachments and State prejudices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed ought to admit, from our National Councils. Looking anxiously forward to the accomplishment of so desirable an object as this is (in my estimation) my mind has not been able to contemplate any plan more likely to effect the measure than the establishment of a UNIVERSITY in a central part of the United States, to which the youth of fortune and talents from all parts thereof might be sent for the completion of their Education in all the branches of polite literature; in arts and Sciences, in acquiring knowledge in the principles of Politics &amp; good Government; and (as a matter of infinite Importance in  
  
my judgment) by associating with each other, and forming friendships in Juvenile years, be enabled to free themselves in a proper degree from those local prejudices &amp; habitual jealousies which have just been mentioned; and which, when carried to excess, are never failing sources of disquietude to the Public mind, and pregnant of mischievous consequences to this Country: Under these impressions, so fully dilated,  
Item I give and bequeath in perpetuity the fifty shares which I hold in the Potomac Company (under the aforesaid Acts of the Legislature of Virginia) towards the endowment of a UNIVERSITY to be established within the limits of the District of Columbia, under the auspices of the General Government, if that government should incline to extend a fostering hand towards it; and until such Seminary is established, and the funds arising on these shares shall be required for its support, my further Will &amp; desire is that the profit accruing therefrom shall, whenever the dividends are made, be laid out in purchasing Stock in the Bank of Columbia, or some other Bank, at the discretion of my Executors; or by the Treasurer of the United States for the time being under the direction of Congress; provided that Honourable body should Patronize the measure, and the Dividends proceeding from the purchase of such Stock is to be vested in more stock, and so on, until a sum adequate to the accomplishment of the object is obtained, of which I have not the smallest doubt, before many years passes away; even if no aid or encouraged is given by Legislative authority, or from any other source.  
Item The hundred shares which I held in the James River Company, I have given, and now confirm in perpetuity to, and for the use &amp; benefit of Liberty-Hall Academy, in the County of Rockbridge, in the Commonwealth of Virga.  
Item I release exonerate and discharge, the Estate of my deceased brother Samuel Washington, from the payment of the money which is due to me for the Land I sold to Philip Pendleton (lying in the County of Berkeley) who assigned the same to him the said Samuel; who, by agreement was to pay me therefor. And whereas by some contract (the purport of which was never communicated to me) between the said Samuel and his son Thornton Washington, the latter became possessed of the aforesaid Land, without any conveyance having passed from me, either to the said Pendleton, the said Samuel, or the said Thornton, and without  
  
any consideration having been made, by which neglect neither the legal nor equitable title has been alienated; it rests therefore with me to declare my intentions concerning the Premises—and these are, to give &amp; bequeath the said land to whomsoever the said Thornton Washington (who is also dead) devised the same; or to his heirs forever if he died Intestate: Exonerating the estate of the said Thornton, equally with that of the said Samuel from payment of the purchase money; which, with Interest; agreeably to the original contract with the said Pendleton, would amount to more than a thousand pounds. And whereas two other Sons of my said deceased brother Samuel—namely, George Steptoe Washington and Lawrence [Charles] Augustine Washington, were, by the decease of those to whose care they were committed, brought under my protection, and in conseq[uenc]e have occasioned advances on my part for their Education at College, and other Schools, for their board—cloathing—and other incidental expences, to the amount of near five thousand dollars over and above the Sums furnished by their Estate wch Sum may be inconvenient for them, or their fathers Estate to refund. I do for these reasons acquit them, and the said estate, from the payment thereof. My intention being, that all accounts between them and me, and their fathers estate and me shall stand balanced.  
Item The balance due to me from the Estate of Bartholomew Dandridge deceased (my wife’s brother) and which amounted on the first day of October 1795 to four hundred and twenty five pounds (as will appear by an account rendered by his deceased son John Dandridge, who was the acting Exr of his fathers Will) I release &amp; acquit from the payment thereof. And the Negros, then thirty three in number) formerly belonging to the said estate, who were taken in execution—sold—and purchased in on my account in the year  and ever since have remained in the possession, and to the use of Mary, Widow of the said Bartholomew Dandridge, with their increase, it is my Will &amp; desire shall continue, &amp; be in her possession, without paying hire, or making compensation for the same for the time past or to come, during her natural life; at the expiration of which, I direct that all of them who are forty years old &amp; upwards, shall receive their freedom; all under that age and above sixteen, shall serve seven years and no longer; and all under sixteen years, shall serve until they are twenty five years of age, and then be free. And to avoid disputes  
  
respecting the ages of any of these Negros, they are to be taken to the Court of the County in which they reside, and the judgment thereof, in this relation shall be final; and a record thereof made; which may be adduced as evidence at any time thereafter, if disputes should arise concerning the same. And I further direct, that the heirs of the said Bartholomew Dandridge shall, equally, share the benefits arising from the services of the said negros according to the tenor of this devise, upon the decease of their Mother.  
Item If Charles Carter who intermarried with my niece Betty Lewis is not sufficiently secured in the title to the lots he had of me in the Town of Fredericksburgh, it is my will &amp; desire that my Executors shall make such conveyances of them as the Law requires, to render it perfect.  
Item To my Nephew William Augustine Washington and his heirs (if he should conceive them to be objects worth prosecuting) and to his heirs, a lot in the Town of Manchester (opposite to Richmond) No. 265—drawn on my sole account, and also the tenth of one or two, hundred acre lots, and two or three half acre lots in the City, and vicinity of Richmond, drawn in partnership with nine others, all in the lottery of the deceased William Byrd are given—as is also a lot which I purchased of John Hood, conveyed by William Willie and Samuel Gordon Trustees of the said John Hood, numbered 139 in the Town of Edinburgh, in the County of Prince George, State of Virginia.  
Item To my Nephew Bushrod Washington, I give and bequeath all the Papers in my possession, which relate to my Civel and Military Administration of the affairs of this Country; I leave to him also, such of my private Papers as are worth preserving; and at the decease of wife, and before—if she is not inclined to retain them, I give and bequeath my library of Books and Pamphlets of every kind.  
Item Having sold Lands which I possessed in the State of Pennsylvania, and part of a tract held in equal right with George Clinton, late Governor of New York, in the State of New York; my share of land, &amp; interest, in the Great Dismal Swamp, and a tract of land which I owned in the County of Gloucester; withholding the legal titles thereto, until the consideration money should be paid. And having moreover leased, &amp; conditionally sold (as will appear by the tenor of the said leases) all my lands upon the Great Kanhawa, and a tract upon Difficult Run, in the county of Loudoun,  
  
it is my Will and direction, that whensoever the Contracts are fully, &amp; respectively complied with, according to the spirit; true intent &amp; meaning thereof, on the part of the purchasers, their heirs or Assigns, that then, and in that case, Conveyances are to be made, agreeably to the terms of the said Contracts; and the money arising therefrom, when paid, to be vested in Bank stock; the dividends whereof, as of that also wch is already vested therein, is to inure to my said Wife during her life—but the Stock itself is to remain, &amp; be subject to the general distribution hereafter directed.  
Item To the Earl of Buchan I recommit “the box made of the Oak that sheltered the Great Sir William Wallace after the battle of Falkirk” presented to me by his Lordship, in terms too flattering for me to repeat, with a request “to pass it, on the event of my decease, to the man in my country, who should appear to merit it best, upon the same conditions that have induced him to send it to me.” Whether easy, or not, to select the man who might comport with his Lordships opinion in this respect, is not for me to say; but conceiving that no disposition of this valuable curiosity can be more eligable than the re-commitment of it to his own Cabinet, agreeably to the original design of the Goldsmiths Company of Edenburgh, who presented it to him, and at his request, consented that is should be transferred to me; I do give &amp; bequeath the same to his Lordship, and in case of his decease, to his heir with my grateful thanks for the distinguished honour of presenting it to me; and more especially for the favourable sentiments with which he accompanied it.  
Item To my brother Charles Washington I give &amp; bequeath the gold headed Cane left me by Doctr Franklin in his Will. I add nothing to it, because of the ample provision I have made for his Issue. To the acquaintances and friends of my Juvenile years, Lawrence Washington &amp; Robert Washington of Chotanck, I give my other two gold headed Canes, having my Arms engraved on them; and to each (as they will be useful where they live) I leave one of the Spy-glasses which constituted part of my equipage during the late War. To my compatriot in arms, and old &amp; intimate friend Doctr Craik, I give my Bureau (or as the Cabinet makers call it, Tambour Secretary) and the circular chair—an appendage of my Study. To Doctor David Stuart I give my large shaving &amp; dressing Table, and my Telescope. To the Reverend, now Bryan,  
  
Lord Fairfax, I give a Bible in three large folio volumes, with notes, presented to me by the Right reverend Thomas Wilson, Bishop of Sodor &amp; Man. To General de la Fayette I give a pair of finely wrought steel Pistols, taken from the enemy in the Revolutionary War. To my Sisters in law Hannah Washington &amp; Mildred Washington; to my friends Eleanor Stuart, Hannah Washington of Fairfield, and Elizabeth Washington of Hayfield, I give, each, a mourning Ring of the value of one hundred dollars. These bequests are not made for the intrinsic value of them, but as mementos of my esteem &amp; regard. To Tobias Lear, I give the use of the Farm which he now holds, in virtue of a Lease from me to him and his deceased wife (for and during their natural lives) free from Rent, during his life; at the expiration of which, it is to be disposed as is hereinafter directed. To Sally B. Haynie (a distant relation of mine) I give and bequeath three hundred dollars. To Sarah Green daughter of the deceased Thomas Bishop, &amp; to Ann Walker daughter of Jno. Alton, also deceased, I give, each—one hundred dollars, in consideration of the attachment of their fathers to me; each of whom having lived nearly forty years in my family. To each of my Nephews, William Augustine Washington, George Lewis, George Steptoe Washington, Bushrod Washington and Samuel Washington, I give one of the Swords or Cutteaux of which I may die possessed; and they are to chuse in the order they are named. These Swords are accompanied with an injunction not to unsheath them for the purpose of shedding blood, except it be for self defence, or in defence of their Country and its rights; and in the latter case, to keep them unsheathed, and prefer falling with them in their hands, to the relinquishment thereof.  
And now  
Having gone through these specific devises, with explanations for the more correct understanding of the meaning and design of them; I proceed to the distribution of the more important parts of my Estate, in manner following—  
⟨Fi⟩rst To my Nephew Bushrod Washington and his heirs (partly in consideration of an intimation to his deceased father while we were Bachelors, &amp; he had kindly undertaken to superintend my Estate during my Military Services in the former War between Great Britain &amp; France, that if I should fall therein, Mount Vernon (then less extensive in domain than at present) should become his property) I give and bequeath all that part thereof which is  
  
comprehended within the following limits—viz.—Beginning at the ford of Dogue run, near my Mill, and extending along the road, and bounded thereby as it now goes, &amp; ever has gone since my recollection of it, to the ford of little hunting Creek at the Gum spring until it comes to a knowl, opposite to an old road which formerly passed through the lower field of Muddy hole Farm; at which, on the north side of the said road are three red, or Spanish Oaks marked as a corner, and a stone placed. thence by a line of trees to be marked, rectangular to the back line, or outer boundary of the tract between Thomson Mason &amp; myself. thence with that line Easterly (now double ditching with a Post &amp; Rail fence thereon) to the run of little hunting Creek. thence with that run which is the boundary between the Lands of the late Humphrey Peake and me, to the tide water of the said Creek; thence by that water to Potomac River. thence with the River to the mouth of Dogue Creek. and thence with the said Dogue Creek to the place of beginning at the aforesaid ford; containing upwards of four thousand Acres, be the same more or less—together with the Mansion house and all other buildings and improvemts thereon.  
Second In consideration of the consanguinity between them and my wife, being as nearly related to her as to myself, as on account of the affection I had for, and the obligation I was under to, their father when living, who from his youth had attached himself to my person, and followed my fortunes through the viscissitudes of the late Revolution—afterwards devoting his time to the Superintendence of my private concerns for many years, whilst my public employments rendered it impracticable for me to do it myself, thereby affording me essential Services, and always performing them in a manner the most felial and respectful—for these reasons I say, I give and bequeath to George Fayette Washington, and Lawrence [Charles] Augustine Washington and their heirs, my Estate East of little hunting Creek, lying on the River Potomac; including the Farm of 360 Acres, Leased to Tobias Lear as noticed before, and containing in the whole, by Deeds, Two thousand and Seventy seven acres—be it more or less. Which said Estate it is my Will &amp; desire should be equitably, &amp; advantegeously divided between them, according to quantity, quality &amp; other circumstances when the youngest shall have arrived at the age of twenty one years, by three judicious and disinterested men; one to be chosen by each of the brothers, and the third by these two. In the meantime,  
  
if the termination of my wife’s interest therein should have ceased, the profits arising therefrom are to be applied for th[e]ir joint uses and benefit.  
Third And whereas it has always been my intention, since my expectation of having Issue has ceased, to consider the Grand children of my wife in the same light as I do my own relations, and to act a friendly part by them; more especially by the two whom we have reared from their earliest infancy—namely—Eleanor Parke Custis, &amp; George Washington Parke Custis. And whereas the former of these hath lately intermarried with Lawrence Lewis, a son of my deceased Sister Betty Lewis, by which union the inducement to provide for them both has been increased; Wherefore, I give &amp; bequeath to the said Lawrence Lewis &amp; Eleanor Parke Lewis, his wife, and their heirs, the residue of my Mount Vernon Estate, not already devised to my Nephew Bushrod Washington; comprehended within the following description—viz.—All the land North of the Road leading from the ford of Dogue run to the Gum spring as described in the devise of the other part of the tract, to Bushrod Washington, until it comes to the Stone &amp; three red or Spanish Oaks on the knowl. thence with the rectangular line to the back line (between Mr Mason &amp; me)—thence with that line westerly, along the new double ditch to Dogue run, by the tumbling Dam of my Mill; thence with the said run to the ford aforementioned; to which I add all the Land I possess West of the said Dogue run, &amp; Dogue Crk—bounded Easterly &amp; Southerly thereby; together with the Mill, Distillery, and all other houses &amp; improvements on the premises, making together about two thousand Acres—be it more or less.  
Fourth Actuated by the principal already mentioned, I give and bequeath to George Washington Parke Custis, the Grandson of my wife, and my Ward, and to his heirs, the tract I hold on four mile run in the vicinity of Alexandria, containing one thousd two hundred acres, more or less, &amp; my entire Square, number twenty one, in the City of Washington.  
Fifth All the rest and residue of my Estate, real &amp; personal—not disposed of in manner aforesaid—In whatsoever consisting—wheresoever lying—and whensoever found—a schedule of which, as far as is recollected, with a reasonable estimate of its value, is hereunto annexed—I desire may be sold by my Executors at such times—in such manner—and on such credits (if an equal, valid,  
  
and satisfactory distribution of the specific property cannot be made without) as, in their judgment shall be most conducive to the interest of the parties concerned; and the monies arising therefrom to be divided into twenty three equal parts, and applied as follow—viz.  
To William Augustine Washington, Elizabeth Spotswood, Jane Thornton, and the heirs of Ann Ashton; son, and daughters of my deceased brother Augustine Washington, I give and bequeath four parts; that is—one part to each of them.  
To Fielding Lewis, George Lewis, Robert Lewis, Howell Lewis &amp; Betty Carter, sons and daughter of my deceased Sister Betty Lewis, I give &amp; bequeath five other parts—one to each of them.  
To George Steptoe Washington, Lawrence Augustine Washington, Harriot Parks, and the heirs of Thornton Washington, sons &amp; daughter of my deceased brother Samuel Washington, I give and bequeath other four parts, one part to each of them.  
To Corbin Washington, and the heirs of Jane Washington, Son &amp; daughter of my deceased brother John Augustine Washington, I give &amp; bequeath two parts; one part to each of them.  
To Samuel Washington, Francis Ball &amp; Mildred Hammond, son &amp; daughters of my Brother Charles Washington, I give &amp; bequeath three parts; one part to each of them. And to George Fayette Washington[,] Charles Augustine Washington &amp; Maria Washington, sons and daughter of my deceased Nephew Geo: Augustine Washington, I give one other part; that is—to each a third of that part.  
To Elizabeth Parke Law, Martha Parke Peter, and Eleanor Parke Lewis, I give and bequeath three other parts, that is a part to each of them.  
And to my Nephews Bushrod Washington &amp; Lawrence Lewis, and to my ward, the grandson of My wife, I give and bequeath one other part; that is, a third thereof to each of them. And if it should so happen, that any of the persons whose names are here ennumerated (unknown to me) should now be deceased—or should die before me, that in either of these cases, the heirs of such deceased person shall, notwithstanding, derive all the benefits of the bequest; in the same manner as if he, or she, was actually living at the time.  
And by way of advice, I recommend it to my Executors not to be precipitate in disposing of the landed property (herein directed  
  
to be sold) if from temporary causes the Sale thereof should be dull; experience having fully evinced, that the price of land (especially above the Falls of the Rivers, &amp; on the Western Waters) have been progressively rising, and cannot be long checked in its increasing value. And I particularly recommend it to such of the Legatees (under this clause of my Will) as can make it convenient, to take each a share of my Stock in the Potomac Company in preference to the amount of what it might sell for; being thoroughly convinced myself, that no uses to which the money can be applied will be so productive as the Tolls arising from this navigation when in full operation (and this from the nature of things it must be ’ere long) and more especially if that of the Shanondoah is added thereto.  
The family Vault at Mount Vernon requiring repairs, and being improperly situated besides, I desire that a new one of Brick, and upon a larger Scale, may be built at the foot of what is commonly called the Vineyard Inclosure, on the ground which is marked out. In which my remains, with those of my deceased relatives (now in the old Vault) and such others of my family as may chuse to be entombed there, may be deposited. And it is my express desire that my Corpse may be Interred in a private manner, without parade, or funeral Oration.  
Lastly I constitute and appoint my dearly beloved wife Martha Washington, My Nephews William Augustine Washington, Bushrod Washington, George Steptoe Washington, Samuel Washington, &amp; Lawrence Lewis, &amp; my ward George Washington Parke Custis (when he shall have arrived at the age of twenty years) Executrix &amp; Executors of this Will &amp; testament, In the construction of which it will readily be perceived that no professional character has been consulted, or has had any Agency in the draught—and that, although it has occupied many of my leisure hours to digest, &amp; to through it into its present form, it may, notwithstanding, appear crude and incorrect. But having endeavoured to be plain, and explicit in all Devises—even at the expence of prolixity, perhaps of tautology, I hope, and trust, that no disputes will arise concerning them; but if, contrary to expectation, the case should be otherwise from the want of legal expression, or the usual technical terms, or because too much or too little has been said on any of the Devises to be consonant with law, My Will and direction expressly is, that all disputes (if unhappily any  
  
should arise) shall be decided by three impartial and intelligent men, known for their probity and good understanding; two to be chosen by the disputants—each having the choice of one—and the third by those two. Which three men thus chosen, shall, unfettered by Law, or legal constructions, declare their sense of the Testators intention; and such decision is, to all intents and purposes to be as binding on the Parties as if it had been given in the Supreme Court of the United States.  
In witness of all, and of each of the things herein contained, I have set my hand and Seal, this ninth day of July, in the year One thousand seven hundred and ninety [nine] and of the Independence of the United States the twenty fourth.

from the latter, while both deſcriptions are in the occupancy  
of the fame proprietor ; it not being in my power, under the  
tenure by which the dower Negroes are held, to manumit  
them. And whereas, among thoſe who will receive freedom  
according to this deviſe, there may be ſome, who from old  
age or bodily infirmities, and others, who, on account of  
their infancy, that will be unable to ſupport themſelves, it is  
my will and deſire, that all who come under the firſt and  
ſecond deſcription, ſhall be comfortably cloathed and fed  
by my heirs, while they live; and that ſuch of the latter  
_ deſcription as have no parents living, or if living, are unable  
or unwilling to provide for them, ſhall be bound by the  
court until they ſhall arrive at the age of twenty-five years;  
and in caſes where no record can be produced, whereby  
their ages can be aſcertained, the judgment of the court,  
c its own view of the ſubject, ſhall be adequate and final.  
he Negroes thus bound, are (by their maſters or miſtreſ-  
ſes) to be taught to read and write, and to be brought up to  
fome uſeful occupation, agreeably to the laws of the Com-  
monwealth of Virginia, providing for the ſupport of orphan  
and other poor children.— And I do hereby expreſsly for-  
bid the fale or tranſportation, out of the ſaid Commonwealth,  
of any Slave I may die poſſeſſed of, under any pretence  
whatſoever. And I do moreover, moſt pointedly and moſt  
ſolemnly enjoin it upon my Executors hereafter named,  
or the ſurvivor of them, to ſee that his clauſe reſpecting  
Slaves, and every part thereof, be religiouſly fulfilled at the  
epoch at which it is directed to. take place, without evaſion,  
neglect, or delay, after the crops which may then be on the  
ground are harveſted, particularly as it reſpects the aged and  
infirm ; ſeeing that a regular and permanent fund be eſtab-  
liſned for their ſupport, as long as there are ſubjects requir-  
ing it ; not truſting to the uncertain proviſion to be made by  
individuals: — And to my mulatto man, William, (calling  
himſelf William Lee) I give immediate freedom, or if he  
mould prefer it (on account of the accidents which have  
befallen him, and which have rendered him incapable of  
walking, or of any active employment) to remain in the ſitu-  
ation he now is, it ſhall be optional in him to do ſo; in cither  
caſe, however, I allow him an annuity of T hirty Dollars.

victuals and cloaths he has been accuſtomed to receive, if he

refufal, however, an intimation that, if it ſhould be the plea-  
fure of the legiſlature to permit me to appropriate the ſaid  
Shares to public uſes, I would receive them on thoſe terms  
with due fenfibility ; and this it having conſented to, in  
flattering terms, as will appear by a ſubſequent law and ſun-  
dry reſolutions, in the moſt ample and honorable manner)  
I proceed after this recital, for the more correct underſtand-  
ing of the cafe, to declare—That as it has always been a  
  
  
Education, often before their minds were formed, or they  
had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happinefs of their  
  
  
tion and extravagance, but principles unfriendly to Repub»  
lican Government, and to the true and genuine liberties of  
  
  
theſe reaſons, it has been my ardent wiſh, to fee a plan de-  
viſed on a liberal fcale, which would have a tendency to  
ſpread ſyſtematic ideas through all parts of this rifing Em-  
pire, thereby to do away local attachments and State preju-  
dices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed ought to  
admit, from our National Councils. —Looking anxiouſly  
  
  
this is, (in my eſtimation) my mind has not been able to  
contemplate any plan more likely to effect the meaſure, than  
  
  
the United States, to which the Youths of fortune and tal-  
ents, from all parts thereof, might be {ent for the completion  
of their Education in all tae branches of polite literature;

of miſchievous conſequences to this country ; under theſe  
impreſſions, ſo fully dilated, _ 5 \ .  
Item. I give and bequeath in perpetuity the Fifty Shares  
which I hold in the Potomack Company (under the afore-  
ſaid acts of the legiſlature of Virginia) towards the endow-

mmits of the Diſtrict of Columbia, under the auſpices of the  
General Government, if that government ſhould incline to  
extend a foſtering hand towards it; and until ſuch Seminary  
is eſtabliſhed, and the funds ariſing on theſe ſhares ſhall be  
required for its ſupport, my further WII L and DESIRE is,  
that the profit accruing therefrom ſhall, whenever the divi-  
dends are made, be laid out in purchaſing Stock in the Bank  
of Columbia, or ſome other Bank, at the diſcretion of my

before their minds were formed, or they hid

For thefe reafons, it has beer, my ardent wilh,

the completion r.f their EJuoton in all the  
branches of polfte literature ; in arts anJ feien

of politics and good government, and (as a  
matter of infinite importance in my judgement)  
by afTiciuting with each other, and forming  
friendihips in juvenile years, be enabled to  
free themf-lves, in a proper degree, from thole  
local prejudices and habitual jealoufies which  
have juft been mentioned; and which, when  
carried to exc.fs, are never-failing foarres of,

of Moung-Vernon, a Citizen of the  
United States; and lately President  
of the {fame, DO make, ordain, and  
declare thig instrument, which is writ­  
ten with m{ own hand*, and every  
page thereof subscribed with my name,  
.to he iy lat WILL and TESTA­  
MENT, revoking all- others—J/mpri­  
mis : All my debts, of which there até  
but few, and none of magnitude, are  
to bé punétually and speedily paid,  
and the Legacies herein after be­  
queathed, are to be discharged as soon  
as circumstances will permit, and in  
the manner direéted.  
- Rem. To my dearly beloved wife  
Martha Wafhingten, I give and be­  
qui¢ath the use, profit and benefit of  
mmy whole estate, réal and personal,  
for the term of her natural [ife, ex­  
cept such parts thereof as are special-  
Iy disposed of hereafter. My impro­  
ved Lot in the town of Alexandria,  
situated on Pitt and Cameron-ftrcets,  
I givé to her and her heirs foréver ; as¢  
I also do my Houthold and Kitchen  
Furniture of every fort and kind, with  
the Liquors and Groceries which may  
be on hand at the timé of my decease,  
6 be used and disposed of as flie may  
think proper. |  
Jtem. Upon the decease of my  
wife, it is my will and desire, that all  
the Slaves which I hold in my own  
right, shall receive their freedom.  
To emancipate them during her life,  
would, ths* earnefMly withed by me,  
be attended with such insuperable dif­  
ficulties on account of their intermix­  
ture by marriage with the dower Ne­  
groes, as to excite the most painful  
sensations, if not difagreéable conse­  
quences from the latter, while both  
descriptions dre in the occupancy of  
the fame proprietor ; it not being in  
my power, under the tenure by which  
the dower Neg‘t%i!‘i are held, to man-  
  
amit them. And whereas, among  
those who will receive freedom accor­  
ding to this devise, there may be  
some who from old age or bodily in­  
firmities, and others who, on account:  
of their infancy, that will be unable  
to support themselves, it is my will  
and desire, that all who come under  
the Ift and 2d description, shall be  
eomfortably clothed and fed by my  
heirs while they live ; and that such  
of the latter défcription as have no  
parent’s living, or if living, are unable  
or unwillng to provide for them, shall  
be bound by court until they shall  
arrive at the aﬁe of twenty-five years ;  
and in cases where no record can be  
produced, whereby their ages can be  
ascertained, the judgment of the court  
@ipon its own view of the fubje&amp;, thall  
be adequate 2nd final. The Negroes  
thus bound, are (by their masters or  
mistresses) to be taught to read and  
write, and to be brought up to some  
~ufeful occupation, agreeably to the  
laws of the commonwealth of Virgi­  
nia, providing for the support of or­  
- phian and other poor children.—And  
Tdo hereby expressly forbid the sale  
ot transportation out of the said com­  
monwealth of any Slave I may die  
pofieficd of under any pretence what­  
soever. And I do moreover, most  
peintedly and most solemnly enjoin  
* it upon my Executors hereafter nam­  
ed or the survivor of them,to fee that  
this clause refpe&amp;ing Slaves and every  
part thereof, be religiously fulfilled at

ot by whatsoever other fame they &quot;  
may be designated) of the Academy,  
i the town of Alexandria, I- give and

dollars; or, in other words, twenty of  
the Shares which I hold m the bank  
of Alexandria, towafd the support of  
a Free-School, established at, and an--  
nexed to, the said Academy, for the  
purpose of éducating such Orphan  
Children, or the Children of such o­  
ther poor and indigent persons as  
are unable to accomplish it with their  
own means ; and who, in the judg­  
meént of the Trustees of the said Se­  
minary, are best entitled to the beme­  
fic of this donation. The aforefaid  
20 Shares I give and bequeath in  
perpetuity ; the dividends only of  
which are to be drawn for, and ap­  
plied by the said Trustees, for the  
time being, for the uses above men­  
tioned ; the stock to remain ertire and  
untouched, unless indications of fail­  
ure of the said bank should be so ap­  
parent, or 2 discontinuance thereof,  
should rénder a removal of this fund  
necessary. In either of these cases,  
the amount of the stocks here devised  
is to be vested in some other bank, or  
public institution, whereby the mtereft  
may with regularity and certainty be  
drawn, and applied as above : And to  
prevent misconception, my meéaning is,  
and is hereby declared to be, that these  
twenty shares are in Heu of, and not in  
addition to, the Thousand Pounds  
gigen by a missive letter some years  
. sHinkconfequence whereof, an an­  
yof Fifty Pounds has since been  
id towards the support of the insti­  
tution. n e  
  
ltem. Whereas by a law of the com­  
monwealth of Virginia, ena&amp;ed in the  
year 1785,the legislature thereof was  
pleased (as an evidence of its appro­  
_bation of the services I had rendered  
_the public during the revolution, and  
partly I bélieve, in consideration of  
my having suggested the vast advan­  
tages which the community would  
derive from the extension of its inland  
navigation under legislative patron­  
age) to ‘prefent me with one hundred  
thares of one hundred dollars each,in  
the incorporated company eltablifhed  
~ for the purpose of extending the navi­  
gation of James River from the tide  
water to the mountains :—and also  
- with ﬁfthy thares of 100 pounds fter­  
. ling each, in the corporation of ano­  
~ ther company likewise established for  
~ the similar purpose of opening the  
. navigation of the river Potomac from  
- tide &#x27;water to Fort Cumberland ; the  
- acceptance of which, altho’ the offer  
was highly honorable and grateful to  
my fee%ings,was refufed as inconsistent  
with a principle which I had adopted,  
and had never departed from me—  
Namely,not to receive pecuniary com­  
pensation for any services I could ren­  
der my country in its arduous struggle  
with Great Britain for its rights; and  
because I had evaded similar proposi­  
tions from ‘other States in the Union.  
Adding to this refufal, . however, an  
intimation that, if it {hould be the plea­  
sure of the legislature to permit me  
to appropriate the fame to public uses,  
I would receive them on those terms  
with due ‘fenfibility ; and &#x27;this it  
having consented to, in flattering  
terms, as will appear by a fiabfequent  
law and sundry resolutions, in the

ciples unfriendly to Republican gov­

liberties of ﬁ;anﬁua , which thereaf­  
ter are farely overdome—For these  
reasons, it has been my ardent wish to  
fee a plan deviféed ot a liberal feale  
- which would have a tindency tofpread  
systematic ideas thraugh all parts of  
this rising empire, thireby to do away  
local attachments and.itate prejudices  
as far as the natur ‘Z!‘féngs would,  
or indeed ought C, fadmit, from  
“our National Councik.— Looking anx­  
iously forward to the accomplﬂﬁment  
of so desirable at obje@ as this is,  
(in my eltimatie;) my mind has not  
been able to chtegzhtc any plan  
more likely to efe&amp; the measure, than  
the establishment of a University in a  
central part of the United States, to  
which the Youths of fortune and ta­  
lents from all parts thereof might be  
sent for the completion of their Edu­  
cation in all the branches of polite  
literature s in arts and {ciences, in ac­  
quiring knowledge- in the principles  
of politics and good government, and  
(as a matter of infinite importance in  
my judgment) by associating with  
each other, and forming friendfhips in  
Juvenile years, be enabled to free  
themselves in a proper degree from  
those local prejudices and habitual  
jealouftes which have jut been men­  
‘tioned ; and which, when carried to  
excess, are never failing fonrces of dis­

their board, cloathing, and other in-_

near five thousand dollars over and  
above the sums furnithed by their

to refund—l do, for these reasons, ac­

my account, in the year [blank] and  
ever since have remained in ‘the pof­  
feflion, and to the use of Mary, widow  
of the said Bartholomew Dandridge,  
with their increase, it is my i/ and  
desire thall continue and be in her pof­  
feflion, without paying hire,or making  
compensation for the fame, for the,  
time past or to come, during her natu­  
ral life ; at the éxpiration of which, I  
direét that all éf them, who are forty  
years old and upwards, shall receive  
their freedom ; all under that age and  
above sixteen, shall serve seven years  
and no longer ; and all under sixteen  
years, shall serve until they are twenty­  
five yeare of ags, cud then he free——  
And to avoid disputes refpeéting the  
ages of any of these negroes, they are  
to be taken into the court of the county  
in which they reside, and the judg­  
ment thereof, in this relation shall be  
final, and record thereof made, which  
may be adduced as evidence at any  
time thereafter, if disputes should arise  
concerning the fame.—And I further  
direé, that the heirs of the said Bar­  
tholomew Dandridge, shall, equally,  
share the benefits ariﬁng from the said  
negroes, according to the tenor of this  
devise, upon the decease of their  
mother. i  
  
Item. 1f Charles Carter, who inter­  
married my niece, Betty Lewis, is not  
fufficiently secured in the title to the  
lots he had of me, in the town of  
Frederickiburg, it is my w;i// and desire  
that my executors thall make such con­  
veyances of them as the law requires,  
to render it perfe&amp;.  
Iter. &#x27;To my nephew, William  
Augustine Washington, (if he {hould  
conceive them to be objeéts worth  
profecutingf) and to his heirs, a lot in  
the town of Manchester (opposite to  
Richmond) N° 265, drawn on my sole  
account, and also the tenth of one or  
two hundred acre lots, and two or  
_three half acre lots, in the city and vi­  
cinity of Richmond; drawn in partner­  
ship with riine others, all in the lottery  
~ of the deccafed Wm, B{rd, are given ;  
as is also a lot which I purchased of  
Jobn Hood, conveyed by William  
Willie and Samuel Gordon, trustees  
of the raid John Hood, numbered 139,  
in the town of Edinburg, in the county  
of Prince George, State of Virginia.

I leave to him also, such of my private  
papers as are worth preserving ; and  
~ at the decease of my wife, and before,

re-commit ¢ the box made of the cak  
that sheltered the great Sir William  
Wallace after the battle of Falkirk,”  
presented to me by his lordship, in  
terms too flattering for me to repeat;  
with a request “to pass it, on the event  
of my decease, to the man in my  
country who thould appear to merit it  
best, uponn the fame conditions that  
have induced him to fend it to me.”  
Whether easy” or not to fele@® Trg  
MAN who mhight comport with his  
lordthip’s opimion in this refpe&amp;, is not  
for me to fay ; but conceiving that  
no disposition of this valuable curiosi­  
ty can be more eligible than the re­  
commitiment of it to his own cabinet,  
agreeably to the original design of the  
goldimith’s éompany of Edinburg,  
‘who presented it to him, and, at his  
request, consented that it should be,  
transferred to me—ll do give and be­  
queath the fame to his lordship ; and,  
in case of his decease, to his heir, with  
my gratéful thanks for the distinguish­  
ed honor for presenting it to me, and  
more especially for the favorable sen­  
timents with which he accompanied it.  
Item. ‘To my brother, Charles  
Wathington, I give and bequeath the  
~gold-keaded cane. left me by Dr.  
Franklin, in his will. I add nothing  
to it, because of the ample proviﬁoni  
- made for his issue. To the acquain­  
tances and friends of my juvenile  
~ years, Lawrence Wathington &amp; Robert  
~ Wathington, of Chotanck, I give my  
- other two gold-headed canes, having  
- my arms engraved on them ; and to  
- each (as they will be ufeful where they  
live) I leave one of the spy-glasses  
which constituted part of my equipage  
during the late war. To my compa­  
triot in arms, and old and intimate  
friend, Dr. Craik, I give my bureau,  
~ (or, as the cabinet makers call it,  
- tambour secretary) and the circular  
-~ chair, an appendage to my study. To  
- Dr. David Stuart, I give ‘my large  
-shaving and drefling table, and my  
~telefcope. To the Reverend, now

in three large folio volumes, with  
notes ; presented to me by the Rt.  
.Rev. Thomas Wilson, bishop of So­

steel pistols, taken from the enemy in  
the revolutionary war. To my fif~  
ters in-law, Hannah Washington and  
Mildred Wa(bin%on ; to my friends  
Eleanor Stuart, Hannah Wathington  
of Fairfield, and Elizabeth Wafhing=  
ton of Hayfield, I give each a mourn­  
ing ring, of the value of one hundred  
de%lars&#x27;. These bequests are not mere  
for the intrinsic value of them, but  
as mementos of my esteem and re­  
gard. To Tobias Lear I give the  
use of the farm which he now holds  
in virtue of a lease from me to him  
and his dcceafed wife (for and durs

and in the latter case, to keep them

Anxp wNow, having gone through  
these fpecific Devifgs,g with -‘expifrxs&#x27;  
nations fer the more corre@ under­  
standing of the meaning and--de­  
sign of them, I proceed to the distri­  
bution of ‘the more important parts  
of my &amp;éftate in ‘manner following : =  
Firsz, To my nephew, Bufhrod  
Wa{hington, and his heirs, {partly in .  
consideration of an intimaticn to his  
decealed father, while we wergbach- &quot;  
eldors, and he had kindly undértaken  
to {uperintend my estate duri .»my

that if I {hould fall therein, ‘:ﬁz nt-  
Vernon then less extenfivei ui‘  
ion than ac psefeat) fhou f‘ me  
his property 3 1 give and bequeath  
all that partthereof, which is compre­  
hended within the following lingsy  
viz :—DBeginning at&#x27;the - ford of Do-.  
gue Run, near my Mill, and extend­  
ing -along the road, .and iboug%ed  
thereby as it now goes and ever has  
gone 4ince ‘my recolleftion of . it, to  
the ford of Little . Hunting Creek, at  
“ithe Gum Spring, until it comes to a  
. knowl, oppefite to an old road which  
formerly -paflfed through the lower  
- field of Muddy-hple Farm ; at which,  
on the north fide of the said road, are  
three red or Spanish oaks, marked as  
a corner, and a f{tone placed—thence  
by a line of trees to be marked re&amp;-  
angular to the back -line or -outer  
boundary of the tract between Thomp­  
son Mafon and myfelf—thence with  
that line easterly (now double ditch­  
ing With a post and rail fence thereon)  
~ to the run of Little Hunting Creek  
&quot; a—thence with that run, which is the  
boundary between the lands of the  
late Humphrey Parke and me, to the  
tide water to Potomac River—thence  
with the River to the mouth of Dogue  
Creek—and thence with the said  
Pogue Creek to the place of begin­  
ning at the aforefaid ford, containing  
wpwards of four thousand acres, be  
the fame more or less, tpgether with  
the mansion house and all other build­  
ings and improvements thereon.  
  
Second—ln consideration of the  
consanguinity between them and my  
wife, being as nearly related to her as.  
to myfelf ; as on account of the af­  
feétion I had for, and the obligation  
I was under to their father when liv­  
ing, who from his youth had attached  
himfelf to my person, and followed  
my fortunes through &quot;the vicissitudes  
of the late revolution, afterwards de­  
voting his time to the fuperintend­  
ance of my private concerns for many  
years, whilit my public employments  
rendered it impradicable for me to  
do it myfelf, thereby affording me ef­  
{ential services, and always perform­  
ing them in a manner the most filial  
and refpe&amp;ful ; for these reasons, I  
fay, I give and bequeath to George  
Fayette Wathington and Lawrence  
Augustine Waﬁﬁngton, and their  
heirs, my estate east of Little Hunt­  
ing Creek, lying on the River Poto­  
mac, including the Farm, of three  
.hundred and sixty acres, leafed to  
Tobias Lear, as noticed before, ands  
containing in the whole, by deed, two  
thousand and twenty-seven acres, be  
it more or less ;—which said estate it  
is my will and desire should be equi­  
tably and advantageouily divided be­  
tween them, according to quantity,  
quality, and other circumstances,  
when the youngest {hall arrive. at the  
age of twenty-one years, by three ju­  
dicious and disinterested men ; one to  
be chosen by each of the brothers, and  
the third by these two. In the mean  
time if the termination of my wife’s  
interest therein should have ceased,  
the profits arising therefrom are to be  
applied for their joint uses and benefit.  
T hird—dAnd awhereas it has always  
been my intention, since ‘my expe&amp;ta­  
tion of having issue has ceafed,:to  
confider the. grand children of my  
wife, in the fame light as I-do my  
own relations, and to a&amp; a friendly  
part by them, more especially by the  
two whom we have raised from their  
infancy—namely, Eleanor Park Cuf­  
tis and Geo. Wathington Park Cuftis.  
And. awhereas the former of these hath  
lately intermarried with Lawrence  
Lewis, a son of my deceased sister,  
Betty Lewis, by which union the in­  
ducement to provide for them both  
hath increased, Wierefore, 1 give and.  
bequeath to the said Lawrence Lewis  
and Eleanor Park Lewis, his wife,  
and their heirs, the residue of my  
_Mount Vernon estate, not already de­  
~vifed to my nephew, Bufhrod Wafh­  
iw,c?ﬁhmded within the fol­  
‘lowing de sgpsion,~- viz.—=All . the  
Lands north of the road leading from  
fwdﬂfmhn to the Gum  
~ Spring, as described in the devise of  
  
ditch to Dogtie Run by the tumbling  
dam of my mill ; thence with the  
said run to the ford aforementioned,  
to which 1 add all the land I possess  
welt of the said Dogue Run and  
Dogue Creek, bounded easterly and  
southerly thereby—together with  
the mill, distillery, and all other hou­  
ses and improvements on the premi­  
ses ; makmg together about two.  
thousand acres, be it more or less. -  
Fourth—A&amp;uated by the principle  
already mentioned, I give and be­  
queath to George Wathington Park  
Cuftis, the grandson of my wife, and  
‘my ward, and to his heiis, the tract 1  
hold on Four Mile Run in the vicin­  
ity of Alexandria, contairing one  
thousand two hundred acres, more or  
less, and -my entire square, number  
twenty-one, in the City of Washing-  
D, i e ey g  
. Fifth——All the rel 2nd residue of  
my estate, real and personal, not dis­  
posed of in manner aforefaid, in what­  
soever consisting—wheresoever lying  
~—and whensoever found-—a Schedule  
vof which as far as is recolle&amp;ted, with  
_a reasonable effimate .of its value, is  
hereunto annexed-—1 defirte may be  
fold by my exeeutors,at ﬁiﬁ;.times, in  
such manner; and on .such credits (if  
an equal, valid, and fatisfactory dis­  
tribution of the fpecific property can­  
not be made without) as in their  
judgment -shall be most conducive to  
the ‘intereft of ‘the parties concerned,  
and the monies arising therefrom to  
be divided into twenty-three equal  
parts, and applied as follows : viz.  
To William Augustine Wathington,  
Elizabeth Spotfweod, Jane Thoraton,  
and the heirs of Ann Ashton, {fon and  
daughters of my .deceased brother  
Augultine Wathington, I give and  
bequeath four parts, that is, one part  
to each of them: To Fielding Lewis,  
George Lewis, Robert Lewis, Howell  
Lewis, and Betty Carter, sons and  
daughter of my deceased sister Betty  
Lewis, I give and bequeath five other.  
parts, one to each of them. To-Geo.  
Steptoe Wathington, Lawrence Au­  
gustine &#x27; Wathington, Harriot Parks,  
and the heirs of Thornton Wathing­  
ton, {fons and daughter of my decea­  
sed brother -Samuel Washington, I  
give and bequeath the other four  
parts, one part to each of them : To  
Corbin Wafthington, and the heirs of  
Jane Wafthington, son and daughter  
of my deceased brother John Au­  
- gultine Wathington, I give and be­  
queath two parts,-one part to each of  
them : To Samuel Washington,  
Frances Ball, and Mildred Ham­  
mond, son dad daughters of my  
brother Charles Wathington, I give  
, and bequ_eazh tl’lree, parte, one part to  
~each of them ; and to Genrge Fay­  
~ette Wathington, Charles Augustine  
Wathington, and Maria Wathington,  
{ons and daughter of my deceased  
r nephew George Augustine Wathing­  
ton, I give one other part, that is, to  
“each a third of that part ; To Eliza­  
} beth Park Law, Martha Park, Peter  
- and Eleanor Park Lewis, I give and  
- bequeath three. other parts, that is a  
- part to each of them : And to my  
nephew Bufhrod Wathington and  
- Lawrence Lewis, and to my ward,  
the grand son of my wife, I give and  
bequeath one other part, that is, a  
third thereof to each of them. And  
if it should so happen, that any of the  
persons whose names are here enume­  
rated, (unknown to me) should now  
- be dead, or should die before me, that  
in cither of these cases, the heirs of  
such deceased persons shall, notwith­  
standing, devise all the benefits of the.  
bequest, in the fame manner as if - he­  
or she was acually living at the times  
and by way of advice 1 recommend  
it to my Executors not to be precipi­  
tate of disposing of the landed proper­  
ty (therein dire@ted to be fold) if  
_from temporary causes the sale thereof  
should be dull ; experience having  
fully evinced that the price of Jand  
(especially above the falls of the riv­  
ers and on the western waters) have  
been progreflively rising and cannot  
be long checked in its increasing va­  
lue. And I particularly recommend  
it to such of the Legatees (under this  
clause of my will) as can make it con­  
venient, to take each a share of my  
stock in the Potomac Company, in  
~ preference to the ameunt of what it  
might fell for—being thoroughly con­  
~vinced myfelf that no uses to which  
the money can be applied will be so  
“productive as the tolls arising from  
this navigation when in full opera­  
tion, (and this from the nature of  
things it must be ere lonsi) and more  
P‘efpcci_allyifthat of the Shenandoah is  
added thereto, &#x27; e el  
~ The Family Vault at Mount Ver­  
‘non, requiring repairs, and beingim­  
-properly situated besides, I desire that  
a new one of brick;and upon a.;hﬁ‘:-,  
scale, may be built at the foot of what  
is commonly called the Vineyard In­  
clofure, on the ground which is mark­  
_ed out—ln which my Remains, with  
those of my decealed relations (now  
inthe old Vault) and such others of  
  
‘manner, without &quot;parad’c or Funeral  
Oratiop.” A iy  
Lastly. I constitute and appoint  
my dearly beloved wife &#x27; Martha  
Wathington, ‘my nephews Wm. Au--  
gufltine Washington, Bufhrod Wath- .  
ington, George Steptoe Wathington,  
Samuel Waﬁaa%;)n, and Lawrence  
Lewis, and my Ward George Wath­  
ington Park Cuftis; (when he shall  
have arrived at the ‘age of Twenty  
years). Executrix and Execntors of  
this WILL and TESTAMENT.—  
In the conftru@ion of which it will  
‘readily *be perceived that no proses:  
fional charaéter has been consulted,:  
or has had any agency ia the draught,  
and that although it has ‘occupied  
many of my leii§fe&quot;honrs ‘to digelt,  
and to throw.it into its present form,  
it may; notwithfanding, appear crude’  
and incorreét—bat having endeavour­  
ed to be plainy aad explicit in all the  
devises, even at the expence of pro­  
lixity, perhaps jof toutology, I hope  
and trust that to disputes will arise  
concerning them ; but if contrary to  
expectation, theicafe should be other­  
wise from @j.grant of legal expres­  
sion, or the Ge#l technical terms, or  
‘becanfle too much or too little has  
been said on any of the devises to be:  
~confonant with lawymy will and di­  
rection expressly is, that all disputes  
(if unhappily any fhwuld arise) {hall  
be decided by threc impartial alg’n­  
telligent men, knownfor their probity  
and good underftanling—two to be  
chosen by the disputants, each having  
the choice of one, amd the -third by -  
those two—which three men. thus  
chosen shall, unfettered by law or le:  
gal constructions, dedlare the sense of  
the Testator’s intentions ; and such  
decision is to all intents and purposes  
to be as binding on the parties as if  
it had been given in the Swpreme  
Court of the United States.  
  
IN WITNESS of all, and of each  
. - .of the things herein contained, I  
have set my Hand and Seal, this  
‘ Ninth day of July, in the Year  
: One Thousand, Seven Hundred  
. and Ninety——, and of the In­  
. dependen# of the U. States the  
Twenty-Fourth. ;

In the name of God — Amen.  
I GEORGE WASHINGTON, of  
Mount Vernon, a citizen of the United  
states, and lately prefident of the fame,  
!o make, ordain, and declare this inflru-  
iiient which is written with my own  
land,* and every page thereof fubferib-  
ed with my own name, to be my laft will  
and teftament revoking all others. — Im-  
orimis. All my debts, of which there  
■ re but few, and none of magnitude are  
to be punctually and fpeedily paid, and  
the legacies herein after bequeathed, arc-  
to be difcharged as foon as circumftan-  
res will permit, and in the manner di-  
rected.  
  
Item, To my dearly beloved wife Mar-  
tha Wafhington, I give and bequeath the  
ufe, profit, and benefit of my whole cftate  
real and pcrfonal, for the term of her na-

are fpecially difpofed of hereafter. —  
My improved lot in the town of Alexan-

Item. Upon the deceafe of my wife, it  
is my will and defire, that all the flaves  
which 1 hold in my own right fliall re-  
ceive their freedom. To emancipate  
them during her life, would, though ear-  
neftlywifhed by me, be attended with  
fuch infuperable difficulties on account of  
their intertnixture by marriages with the  
d nver negroes, as to excite the moft pain-  
ful fenfatioaa, if not difagreeable confe-  
quertces frOta the latter while both def-

to the laws of the commonwealth of Vir-

do hereby exprefsly forbid the falc or  
tfanfpot.tation.out of the laid common-

moreover n-.oft pointedly and moftfolemn-

named or ti:e ftuviv or of thern, to fee  
that this claafe.refpecting (Uvea and e-  
.ery part thereof be religioufly fulfilled  
at the epoch at which it is directed to

liam, (.calling himfelf William Lee) I

prefer it (V;i account of the accidents  
which have befallen him and which have  
red bhp incapable of walking or of  
nr.y active employment) to remain in the

hi 1 to &#x27;1 fo : in either cafe however I  
allow him an annuity of 30 dollars during

Item. &#x27;Fo the truftees (governors, or  
by wlja t foe ver .other name they may be

pf Alexandria I give and bequeath, in  
truf&#x27;t, four ti-.oufand dollars, or in other  
words, twentv of the (hares which I hold  
in the bank of Alexandria, towards the  
fupport of a free fchool, ellabliflied at,  
and annexed to the faid accademy, for  
the purpofe of educating fuch orphan  
children, or the children of fuch poor and  
indigent perfons as are unable to accom-  
plish it with their own means ik whom the  
judgment of the truftces of the faid femt-  
uary,&#x27;are belt entitled tothe benefitofthis

give and bequeath in perpetuity ; the di-  
vidends only of which are to be drawn  
for, and applied by the faid trultecs, for  
the ufes above mentioned the (lock to re-  
main entir- and untouched, unlefs indi-  
cations of the failure of the faid bank  
(Would be fo apparent, or a discontinu-

this fund neceffary. In either of thefe  
cafes, the amount of the (lock here devi-  
led is to he veiled in fome other bank, or  
public inflitution whereby the intereft  
may with regularity and certainty be  
drawn and applied as above : and to pre-  
vent mifconception, my meaning is, and  
is hereby declaied tobe, that thefe twen-  
ty (hares are in lieu of, and not in additi-  
on to the thoufand pounds given by a mif-  
live letter fome years ago ; in confe-  
quence whereof, an annuity of 50I has  
I. nee been paid towards the fupport o£  
tins inflitution.  
  
Item. Whereas by a law of the com-  
monwealth of Virginia, enacted in the  
vevr 17^ c, the legislature thereof was  
plealed (as an evidence of its approbati-  
on of the fervices I had rendered the pub-  
lic during the revolution, and partly 1 be-  
lieve in confideration of my having fug-  
tufted the vaft advantages which the  
community would derive from the cxten-  
tion of its inland navigation- under legif-  
lative patronage) to prefent me with one  
hundred (hares of one hundred dollars  
each, in the incorporated company cfta-  
ulifhedfor the purpofe of extending the  
navigation of James River from tide wa-  
ter to the mountains ; — and alfo with  
fifty (hares of one hundred pounds  
fterlingeach, fa the corporation of ano-  
ther company likewife eitablifhed for the  
Gmilar purpofe of opening the navigation  
of the river Potomac from tidewater to*  
Fort Cumberland ; the acceptance of  
which, although the offer was highly ho-  
norable and grateful to my feelings, was  
refuted as inconfillent with a principle  
which I had adopted, &amp; had not departed  
t&#x27;rom — Namely, not to receive pecuniary  
compenfation for any fervices I could  
render my country in its druggie with  
Great Britain for its rights ; and becaufe  
I had evaded t fimilar proportions from  
&gt;ther ftates in the Union. Adding to  
, his refufal, however, an intimation that,  
•f it fliotild be the pleafure of the legifla-  
lure to permit me to appropriate the faid  
&#x27;bares to public ufe I would receive them  
m thofe terms with due fenfibility ; and  
this it having confented to, in flattering  
terms, as will appear by a fubfequcr.t law  
and fundry refolutions, in the mod ample  
md honorable manner. I proceed alter  
&#x27;his recital, for the more correct undcr-  
ftanding of the cafe to declare — that as it  
has always been a fource of ferious regret  
  
with me to fee the ye-utn #tf*fe Uuitcd |[ inconvenient for them or their fathers ef  
States fent to foreign Countries for the | tate lo refund -&gt;  
  
purpofe of Education, often before their  
minds were formed, or they had imbibed  
any adequate ideas of the happinefs of  
their own ; contracting too frequently,  
not only habits of diiiipa.ion and extrava-  
gance, but principles unfriendly to Re-  
publican government, and to the true and  
  
liberties of mankind ; which, thet  
  
after arc rarely overcome. Kor thefe rea-  
fons, it has been my ardent v;i(h to fee a  
plandevifed on a liberal fcale which would  
have a tendency to fprMd fyf.eiiiatic ideas  
through all parts of this riling empire,  
therebv to do away local attachments and  
ftnte prejudices, as far r.s the nature of  
things would, or indeed, ought to admit,  
from&quot; our National Councils. — Looking  
arucioufly forward to the accompliflnnent  
of fo deferable an object as this is, (in my  
eftimation) my mind has not been able to  
Contemplate any plan more likely toeffeel  
the nieal&#x27;ure than the eftaolilhmenr. &#x27;  
UNIVERSITY in a central part  
United States, to which the youths of  
fortune, and talents from all parts thereof  
might be fent for the completion of their  
education in all the branches of polite  
literature ; in arts and fciences, in acqui-  
ring knowledge in the principles of poli-  
tics and good&#x27; government, and (.is a niat-  
ferof infinite importance™ royjudgement)  
by affociating with each other and form-  
ing frienifhips in Juvenile years, be ena-  
bled to free themfelves in a proper degree  
from thofe local prejudices and habitual  
jealoufies which have juft beenmcnti oned ;  
and which, when carried to excefs, are  
never failing fources of difquietude to the  
public mind, and pregnant of mifchievous  
cenfequences to this country under thefe  
iinprefiions, fo fully dilated.  
  
Item. I give and bequeath in perpetui-  
ty the Fifty Shares which I hold in the Po-  
tomac Company (under the aforcfaid a&amp;s  
of the legillature of Virginia) towards the  
endowment of a Univemsitv to be eftab-  
lifhed within the limits of the dillriel of  
Columbia, under the nufpiccs of the gen-  
eral government, if that government  
fliould incline to extend a faltering hand  
towards it ; and until fuch feminary is  
eftablifhed, and the funds arifing on thefe  
fl^ircs (hall be required for its fupport,  
irly further win. and D.-.sirtc is, that the  
profit accruing therefrom (hall, whenever  
the dividends are made, be laid out in  
purchafing Stock in the bank of Columbia,  
or fame other bank, at tiie difcretion of am  
executors or by thetreafurer of the U. cW  
for the time being, under the direction of  
Congrefs — provided that honorable body  
fliould patronize the meafure, and the di-  
vidends proceeding fro n the purchafe of  
fuch Stock is to be veiled in more Stock,  
and fo on, until a fum, adequate to the ac-  
complifhment of the object, is obtained ;  
of which I have not the (mailed doubt, be-  
fore many years pftfs away, even if no aid  
or encouragement is given by legifhtive  
authority, or from any other fource.  
  
Item. The hundred lliares which I  
hold in the James River Company, I have  
given, and now confirm in perpetuity, to  
and for the ufe and benefit of Liberty  
Hall Academy, in the county of Roc:.-  
bridge, in the common wealth of Virginia.  
  
Item. I releafe,exhonorat£ &amp; difcharge  
the eflate of my deceafed Brother Samuel  
Waihit-.gton, from the payment of the mo-  
ney which is due to me for the land I fold  
to Philip Pendleton (lying in the county  
of Berkley) who affigned the fame to him  
the faid Samuel, who, by agreement, was  
to pay me therefor ; And whereas, by  
fome contract (th™ purport of which was  
never communicated to rue) between the  
faid Samuel and his Ion, Thornton Well-

aforcfaid land, without any conveyance

to take each a lhare ofjmy flock in

expence of prolixity, perhaps of  
tautology, I hope and truft that no

(Concluded.)  
  
Item. The balance due to me from the  
elate of&quot; Bartholomew Daiidridge, dec.  
(my wife&#x27;s brother) and which amounted  
011 the lit day of October, 1795, to four  
hundred and twenty five pounds (as will  
appear by an account rendered by his de-  
ceafed fo&#x27;n, John Daiidridge, who was the  
a. ling executor of his fathers will) I re- inan  
It if. and acquit from the payment thereof ! e ^_&gt;&#x27;  
*— and the negroes (then 33 in  
  
ken into the court of the county in which  
they refide, and the judgment thereof, in  
th&#x27;13 relation, drill bo final, and record  
thereof made, which may be adduced as  
evidence 1,1 any timetheieafler, if dilnutes

further direct, that the heirs of the faid  
Bartholomew Dandridge {hall, equally,

of the faid negroes, according to the te-  
nor of this devife, upon the deceafe of  
their mother. / , t  
  
Item. If Charles Career, who inter-  
married with my niece, Betty Lewis, is  
not fufficiently fecured in the title to the  
lots he had of me in the town of Frede-  
rickftnirg, it is my will and deli re that my  
executors fliall make fuch conveyances of  
them as the law requires, to render it  
perfect. . &#x27;  
  
Item. To my nephew, &quot;William Auguf-  
tine Wafliington, and his heirs (if he  
fliould conceive them to be objects worth  
profecuting) and to his heirs, a lot in the

mond) No. 265, drawn on my ible ac-  
count, and alfo the tc^th of one or two  
hundred acre lots, and two or three half  
acre lots in the city and vicinity of I  
Richmond, drawn in partnerlhip with  
nine others, all in the lottery of tlie  
deceafed William Byrd, are given ; as is  
alfoa lot which I purchafed of John Hood,  
conveyed by William Willie and Samuel  
Gordon, truftees of the faid John Hood,  
numbered 139, in the town of Edenburgh,  
in the county of Prince George, ftate of  
Virginia.  
  
Item. To my nephew, Euflirod Wafli-  
ington,! give and bequeath all the papers  
in my poffeffion, which relate to my civil  
and military adminiltration of the affairs  
of this country. — I leave to him alfo,  
fuch of privates papers as are worth pre-  
feTving ; and at the deceafe of my wife,  
and before, if Ihe i.&quot; not inclined to re-  
tain them, I give and bequeath my libra-  
ry of Books and Pamphlets of every kind.  
  
Item, Ilaviiig fold lands which I pof-  
feffed in the ftatc of Pennfylvauia, and  
I part of a tract held in equal right with  
I George Clinton, late governor of New-  
York^ in the ftate of New- York ; my fliarc  
of land and intered, in the Great Difmal  
Swamp and a tract of land, which I own-  
ed in the county of Glouccfter — with-  
holding the legal titles thereto, until the  
conftderation money fliould be paid — and  
having moreover leafed, and conditional-  
ly fold, (as will appear by the tertor of  
the faid lcafes) all my lands upon the  
Great Kenhawa, and a tract upon Diffi-  
cult run, in the county of Loudon, it is  
my will and direction that whenfoever  
the contracts are fully and refpectively  
complied with, according to the fpirit,  
true intent and meaning thereof, on the  
part of the purchafers, their heirs or af-  
figns, that then, and in that cafe, convey-  
ances are to be made, agreeable to the  
terms of the faid contracts, and the mo-  
ney arifmg therefrom when paid, to be  
veiled in Bank Stock ; the dividends  
whereof, as of that alfo which is already  
veiled therein is to inure to my laid wife  
•during her life, but the ftock itfelf is to  
remain and be fubject to the general diftri-  
bution hereafttr directed.  
  
Item. To the earl of Buchan I recom-  
mit, &quot; the box made of the Oal: that Shelt-  
ered the great fir William Wallace after  
the battle of Falkirk&quot; — prefented to me  
by his lordfliip, in tcr;ns too flattering for  
me to repeat, with a requeft &quot;to pafs it  
on the ever.: of my deceafe, to the maain  
my country, who fliould appear to merit it  
bed, upon the fame conditions that have  
duced him to fend it to me.&quot; Whether  
not, to felect the man who might  
  
^numbeO [import with Ids lordibips opinion/ in  
  
ceiving that no dilpoikionof this valuabk  
curioiuy can be more eligible than the  
recommitment of it to his own cabinet, a-  
greeably to the original dtlign of the  
Goldfraitlis company of Edinburgh, who  
prefented it to him, and at his requeft,  
conferred that it fliould be transferred to  
me — I do give and bequeath the fame to  
his lordfliip ; and in cafe of his deceafe to  
heir, with my grateful thanks for the  
diitinguuhed honor ofprefenting it to me,  
and more efpecially for the favorable fen-  
tiinehts with which he accompanied it.  
  
Item. To my brother Charles Wafli-  
ington, I give and bequeath the gold  
headed cane left me by nr. Franklin, in  
bis will. I add nothing to it, becaufe of  
ihe ample proviiion I have made for his  
iffue* To the acquaintances and friends  
of my juvenile year3, Lawrence Wafli-  
ington and Robert Wafliington of Cho-  
tai.k I give my other two gold headtd  
canes, having my arms engraved on  
their, ; and to each (as they will be ufe-  
ful v. here they live) I leave one of the  
fpyglafles, which cor.ftituted part of my  
equipage during the late war. To my co-  
patriot in arms and old intimate friend  
Dr. Craik, I give my bureau (or, as the  
cabinet makers call it, tambour fecrctar^)  
and the circular chair, and appendage of  
my ftudy. To Dr. David Stuart I give  
my large (having and dreffing table, and  
my telefcope. To the reverend, now  
Bryan lord Fairfax, I give a bible in three  
large folio volumes, with note;. — presen-  
ted to me by the right rev. Thomas Wilfon,  
biftVop of Scdor and Man. To general de  
la Fayette I give a pair of finely wrought  
tlecl piilols, taken from the enemy in the  
revolutionary war. &#x27;Fo my filters inlaw,  
Hannah Washington and Mildred Wafli-  
ington — to my friends Eleanor Stuart,  
Hannah Wafliington, of Fairfield, andE-  
lizabeth Wafliington, of Hayfield, I give  
each a mourning ring of the value of one  
hundred dollars. Thefe bequcfts are  
not made for the intrinfic value of them,  
but as mementos of my cfteem and re-  
gard. To Tobias Lear I give the ufe of  
the farm which he now holds, in virtue of a  
leafe from me to him &amp; his deceafed wife  
(for and during their natural lives) free  
from rent during his life ; at the expira-  
tion of which, it is to be difpofed of as is  
herein after directed. &#x27;Fo Sally B. Hay-  
nie (a dillant relation of mine) I give and  
bequeath three hundred dollars. To Sa-  
rah Green, daughter of the dec. Thomas  
Biihop, and to Ann Walker, daughter of  
John Alton, alfo deceafed, I give each  
one hundred dollars, in confideration of  
the attachment of their fatiiers tome;  
each of whom having lived nearly forty  
years in my family. To each of my ne-  
phews William Auguftine Wafliington,  
George Lewis, George Steptoe Wafliing-  
ton, Buflirod Wafliington, and Samuel  
Wafliington, I give one of the fwords or  
cutteaux, of w hich I may die poffeffed,  
and they are to choofo in the order they  
are named. — Thefe fwords are accompa-  
nied with an injunction not to uuflicath  
them for the purpofe of (bedding blood,  
except it be for felf defence, or in de-  
fence of theircountry and its rights; and  
in the latter cafe, tokeep them unflieath-  
e-d, and prefer falling with them in their  
hands to the reliiiquithment thereof.  
  
And now, having gone through theft  
fpecific devifes, with explanations for the  
more correct underftanding of the mean-  
ing and defign of them, I proceed to the  
diftribution of the more important parts  
of my tftate,in manner following:  
  
Firft. To my nephew Buflirod Wafli-  
ington, and his heirs (partly In confide-  
ration of an intimation to his deceafed  
father, while we were bachelors, and he  
had kindly undertaken to i&#x27;uperintend my  
eftate during my military fervices in the  
former war between Great Britain and  
France, that if I fliould fall therein,  
Mount Vernon (then lefs extenfive in do-  
main than at prefent) Ihould become his  
property, I give and bequeath all that  
part thereof, which is comprehended  
within the following limits, viz.; Begin-  
ning at the ford at Dogue run, near my  
mil^and extending along the road, and  
bounded thereby, as it now goes and ever  
has gone fine* my recollection of it, to  
the ford of little hunting creek, at thegum  
fpring, until it comes to a knowl, oppo-  
lite to an old road which formerly palled  
through the lower field of muddyhole farm  
at which, on the north fide of the faid road  
are three read or Spanifh oaks, marked as  
a corner, and a ftone placed ; thence by a  
  
line of trees to be marked recl-ar-oular  
fo the baek line or outer boundary of the  
trafi between Thompfon MaTonand my-  
felfj thence With that lire eafterly,  
(now double ditching with a port and rail  
i&#x27;ence thereon) to the run of little hunting  
creek; thence with that run, which is  
the boundary between the lands of ihe  
late Humphrey Peake and me, to the tide  
water of the faid creek ; thence by that  
water to Potomac river; thence with  
the river to the mouth of Dogue creek ;  
and thence with the faid Dogue creek to  
thcplaceof beginning at the afonf.id  
ford, containing upwards of four thou-  
fand acres, be the fame more or lei&#x27;s, to-  
gether with the manfion lu ufe. and all o-  
ther buildings and improvements ikre-  
o.n. Second. In confideration of the  
cenfanguinity between them and my w ife  
being as nearly related to her as to mv-  
felf; as on account of the affection I ha.l  
I for, :.rd the obligation 1 was under to  
their father when living, who, from his  
youth had attached himfelf to my ptrfon,  
and followed my fortunes through the  
viciffitudes of the late revolution,&quot; after-  
wards devoting his time to the fuperin-  
dance of my private concerns for many  
years, whilft my public employment ren-  
dered it impracticable for me to do it my.  
felf, thereby r.ffording me effeniijl fervi-  
ces, and always performing ihem in a  
manner the molt filial and refpectiul : for  
thefe reafens, I fay, I give and bequeath  
to George Fayette Wafliington, anil Law-  
rence Auguftine Wafliington, and their  
heirs, my eftate caft of Little Hunting  
creek, lying on the river Potomac, inclu-  
ding the farm of three hundred and fixty  
acres, leafed to Tobias Lear, as noticed  
before, and containing in the whole by  
deed, two thoufand and twentv-feven a-  
cres, be it more or lefs ; which faid e-  
ftatc it is my will anddefire fliould be equi-  
tably and advantageouliy divided between  
them, according to quantity, quality, and  
other circumftances, when the voungell  
fliall have arrived at the age of twenty-one  
years, by three judicious and dilinterefted  
men ; one to be chofen by each of the bro-  
thers, and the third by thefe two. In the  
mean time, if the termination of my wife&#x27;s  
intereft therein fliould have ceafed, the  
profits arifing therefrom are to be appli-  
ed for their joint ufes and bem-fit. Third,  
And whereas it has always been my in-  
tention, fince my expectation of having  
iffue has ceafed, to confde-r the grand  
children of my wife, in the fame light as  
I do my own relations, and to act a  
J friendly part by them, more efpecially  
li by the two whom we have raifed from  
i. their earliefi infancy — namely Eleanor  
!, Park Cuftis and George Wafhingcn Fark  
I&#x27; Cuftis ; and whereas the former of thefe  
j. hath lately intermarried with Lawrence  
ji Lewis, a fon of my deceafed lifter B&gt;. tty  
&#x27;,\ Lewis, by which union the inducement  
to provide for them both has been increa-  
fed, wherefore I give and bequeath to the  
faid Lawrence Lewis and Fleanor ! ark  
Lewis, his wife, and their heirs, the tefdue  
of my Mount Vernon eftate, not already  
deviled to my nephew Bufli&#x27;-od Wafliing-  
ington, comprehended within the follow*  
I ing description, viz. — All the land north  
of the road leading from the ford of Dogue  
run, to the Gum fpring, as defer ibed in  
the devife of the other part of the tra£t, to  
Buflirod Wafliington, until it comes to  
the (tone and three Red or Spanifli oaks,  
on the knowl, thence with the rect-angu-  
lar line to the back line (between Mr.  
Mafon h ine) thence with that line weft-  
erly along the new double ditch to Dogue  
run by the tumbling dam of my mill ;  
thence with the faid run to the ford afore-  
mentioned, to wdiich I add all the land I  
poflefs weft of the faid Dogue run and  
Dogue creek, bounded eafterly andfouth-  
erly thereby — together with the mill,  
dilcillery, and all other houfes and im-  
provements on the premifes ; making to-  
gether about two thoufand acres, be it  
more or lefs. Fourth. Actuated by the  
principle already mentioned, I give and  
bequeath to George Wafliington Park.  
Curtis, the grandfon of my wife, and my  
ward, and to his heirs, the tract I hold  
on Four Mile run, in the vicinity of A-  
lexandria, containing one thouland two  
hundred acres, more or lefs, and my en-  
tire fquare, number twenty one, in the  
city of Wafliington, Fifth. All the rclb  
and refidue of my eftate, real and perfon-  
al, not difpofed of in manner aforefaid, in  
wtiatfoevcr confuting ; wherefoever ly-  
ing ; and whenfoever found ; a fch^dule  
of which as far as is recollected, with a  
  
VearonaUeeftimate ofits value, is nejrenrl-  
to Annexed ; I defire may be fold by my  
&#x27;(txecu&gt;»i-s at fu:h tlr.-.cs : in fuch&#x27; manlier,  
&amp; on iV.r;h credit; &#x27;(if Sr. equal, valid; &amp;ft-  
tisfactory distribution of the fpecific pro-  
perty cannot be made without) aS in their  
judgment ftiall be r,ioft conducive to the  
intereft bf the parties concerned, and the  
monies arifingtherefrom tobe divided into  
twenty three equal parts, and applied as  
follows : viz. To William Auguftine  
Washington, Elizabeth Spotfwood, Jane  
Thornton, and the heirs of Ann Afliton,  
fon and daughters of my deceafed bio-  
ther AuguRine Wafhington, I give and  
bequeath four parts, that is, one part to  
each of them : To Fielding Lewis,  
George Lewis, Robert Lewis, Howell  
Lewis, and Betty Carter, fons and daugh-  
ter to my deceafed filter Betty Lewis, I  
give and bequeath five other (hares, one  
to each of them : To George Steptoc  
Wafhingtcn, Lawrence Auguftine Wafti-  
ington, Harriot Parks, and the heirs of  
Thornton Wafhington, fons and daughter  
to my deceafed brother Samuel Walhing-  
ton, I give and bequeath the other four  
parts, one part to each of them : To Cor-  
bin Wafhington, and the heirs of Jane  
Wafhington, fon and daughter of my dec.  
brother John Auguftine Wafhington, I  
give and bequeath two parts, one part to  
each of them : To Samuel Wathington,  
Francis Ball, Mildred Hammond, fon and  
daughters to my brother Charles Wafh-  
ington, I give nnd bequeath three parts,  
one part to each of them : and to George  
Fayette Wafhington, Charles Auguftine  
W afliington, and Maria Wafhington, fons  
and daughter of my deceafed nephew  
George Auguftine Wathington, I give  
one other part, that is, to each a third  
of that part : To Elizabeth Park Law,  
Martha Park Peter, and Eleanor Park  
Lewis, I give and bequeath three other  
parts, that is, a part to each of them :  
And to my nephew Bufhrod Wafhington  
and Lawrence Lewis, and to my ward,  
the grandfon of my wife, I give and be-  
queath one other part, that is, a third  
thereof to each of them. And if it fliould  
fo happen, that any of the perfons whole  
names are here enumerated (unknown to  
me) fliould now be dead, or fliould die  
before me that in either of thefe cafes,  
the heirs of fuch deceafed perfons, fhall,  
notwithstanding, derive all the benefit?  
of thebequeft, in the fame manner as if  
he or (be was actually living at the time ;  
and by way of advice I recommend it to  
my executors not to be precipitate ofdil&quot;  
pofing of the landed property (therein di-  
rected to be fold) if from temporary cau-  
fes the fale thereof fliould be dull; ex-  
perience having fully evinced that the  
price of land (efpecially above the falls of  
the rivers and on the weftern waters,)  
have been progreffively rifing and cannot  
be long checked in its increafing value.  
And I particularly recommend it to fuch  
of the legatees (under this daufe of my  
will) as can make it convenient, to take  
each a fhare of my flock in the Potomac  
company, in preference to the amount of  
what it might fill for, being thoroughly  
convinced myfelf, that no ufes to which  
the money can be applied, will be fo pro-  
ductive as the tolls aiifmg from this na-  
vigation when in full operation, (and this  
from the nature of things it mull be ere  
long) and more efpecially if that of the  
Shenandoah is added thereto.  
  
The family vault at Mount Vernon,  
requiring repairs, and being improperly  
fituated befides, I defire that a new one  
of brick, and upon a larger fcale, may be  
built at the foot of what is commonly  
called the Vineyard inclofure, on the  
ground which is marked out — In which  
my remains, with thole of my deceafed  
relations, (now in the old vault) and fuch  
others of my family as may chufe to be  
entombed there, maybe depofited. And  
it is my exprefs defire, that my corpfe  
may be interred in a private manner,  
without parade or funeral oration.  
  
Laftly. ( confthate and appoint my  
dearly belovad wife M:rtba Washington,  
my nephews, William Augustine Washing-  
ton. Huskrod Washington, George SttB-  
toe Washington, Samuel Washington, and  
Lawrence Lewis, and my ward, George  
Washington Park Custis, (when he fhall  
have arrived at the age of twenty years)  
executrix and executors of this will and  
teftament — In the coiiftruction of which  
it will readily be perceived that no pro-  
feffional character has been confulted, or  
had any agency in the draught, and that  
although it has occupied many of my  
leifure hours to dig;ft, and throw it into  
its prefent form, it may iiotwithftanding  
appear crude and incorrect — but havino-  
endeavored to be plain and explicit in all  
the devifes, even at the expen&#x27;ce of pro-  
lixity, perhaps of tautology, 1 hope and  
truft that no difputcs will arife concern-  
ing; them ; but if, contrary to expectation  
the cafe fliould be otherwil&#x27;e from the  
want of legal exprelfion, or the ufnal tech-  
nical terms, or becaufe too much or too  
  
little has been laid on any of the devifes  
  
to be confonant with law, my will and  
direction exprefsly is, that all difputes  
( ; f unhappily any fliould ar&#x27;fe) fhall be de-  
cided by three impartial and intelligent  
men, known for their probity and good  
unJerflanding — two to be chofen by the  
dilputants, each having the choice of  
one, and the third by thofe two— which  
three men thus chofen fhall, unfettered  
by law or legal conftruetions, declare the  
fenfe of the teftators intentions ; and  
fuch decifion is, to all intents and pur-  
pofes, to be as binding on the parties as  
if it had been given in the fupremc court  
of the United States.

Item .—Whereas by a law of the  
commonwealth of Virginia, enabled  
in the year 1785, the Leglilature  
theteof was plcaled, as an evidence  
ot Its approbation of the fervices 1  
had lendcrcd the public during the  
Rtvolution, and partly, I believe, in  
coniideration of my having fuggellcd  
the v^ft advantages which the com*  
inunity would aerive from the ex*  
tenlion of its inland navigation, un¬  
der Legtfl. ■ ;vc patronage, to prefctit  
me wiih one hundred lhares, of one  
hundred dollars each, in the incorpo¬  
rated company eftablilhed for the  
puroofe of extending the navigation  
of J &lt;mes River, from Tidewater to  
the mountains; and alfo with fifty  
fhares, of one hundred pounds fier-  
ling each, in the corporation of ano¬  
ther company, likewife eftablilhed  
for the limilar purpofe of opening  
the navigation of the River Potomac,  
from Tidewater to Fort Cumbei-  
land ; the acceptance of which, tho*  
the offer was highly honourable and  
grateful to my feelings, was refufed,  
as inconfifient with a principle which  
1 had adopted, and never departed  
from, namely, not to receive pecu¬  
niary compenfation for any fervices  
I could render my country in its ar¬  
duous Ifruggle with Great Britain  
for its rights, and becaufe 1 had  
evaded (imilar propofuions fremother  
States in the Union. Adding to this  
refufal, however, an intimation, that,  
if it (hould be the pleafute of the  
Legiflature to permit me to appro¬  
priate the faid lhares to public ults, I  
would receive them on thofe terms  
with due fenfibility ; and this it hav¬  
ing confented to in flattering termsy  
as will appear by a fubfequent law,  
and fundry refolutions. in the moff  
ample and honourable manner; I  
proceed, after this recital, for the  
more corie6t unaeritanding of the  
  
cafe, to declare that it has always  
been a fource of ferlous regret with  
me to fee the Youth of thele United  
States fent to Foreign Countries for  
tlie purpole of Fducatiun, otten be¬  
fore their minds were formed, or  
they had imbibed any adequate idt as  
of the bappinefs of their own, con-  
tra6fing too frequently not only ha¬  
bits o (iiflipation and extravagance,  
but principles unfriendly to Republi¬  
can Government, and to the tiucand  
genuine Liberties of Mankind, nhich  
thereafter are rarely overcome—For  
thefc reafons, it has been my ardent  
wilh to fee a plan devifed on a liberal  
fcale, which would have a tendency  
to fpread lyfiematic ideas through all  
parts of this riling F.mpirt, iheicby  
to do away local attachments and  
Dale prejudices as far as the natuie  
of things would, or indeed ought, to  
admit from our National Councils.  
Looking anxioully forwaid to the  
arromplifhnient of fo delirable an ob-  
je£l as this is (in my eflimation,} my  
mind hes not been able to contem¬  
plate ary plan more likely to efi&#x27;ed  
the mealuie than to eltablini a Uni-  
veifity in a cential part of the United  
States, to which the youths of for¬  
tune and talents, from all parts there¬  
of, might be fent for the completion  
of their Education in all the branches  
of polite Literature, in Arts and  
Sciences, in acquiring knowledge in  
the principles of Politics and good  
Governnient, and (as a matter of in¬  
finite importance to niy judgement,)  
by aflbeiating with each other, and  
forming fiiendihip in juvenile yeus,  
be enabled to free tliemfelvtf. in a  
proper degree from thofe local pre¬  
judices and habitual jraloufies which  
have juft been mentioned, and which,  
when carried to excef&#x27;, arc never-

In the name of God, Amen. I, George Wathington,  
of Mount Vernon, a citizen of the United States, and  
lately Prefident of the fame, do make, ordain, and de-  
clare this inftrument, which is written with my own  
hand, and every page thereof fubfcribed with my  
name, to be my laft will and teftament, revoking all  
others.  
  
Imprimis—All my debts, of which there are but  
few, and none of magnitude, are to be punétually and  
fpeedily paid ; and the legacies hereafter bequeathed  
are to be difcharged as foon as circumftances will per-  
mit, and in the manner direéted.  
  
Item. To my dearly beloved wife, Martha Wafhing-  
ion, I give and bequeath the ufe, profit, and benefit of  
my whole eftate, real and perfonal, for the term of her  
natural life, except fuch parts thereof as are {pecially  
difpofed of hereafter. My improved lot in the town  
of Alexandria, fituated in Pitt and Cameron-ftreets, I  
give to her and her heirs for ever, as 1 alfo do my  
houfehold and kitchen furniture of every fort and  
kind, with the liquors and groceries which may be on  
hand at the time of my deceafe, to be ufed and difpofed  
of as fhe may think proper.  
  
Item. Upon the deceafe of my wife, it is my will  
and defire that all the flaves which I hold in my own  
right, fhall receive their freedom. To emancipate  
them during her life would, though earneftly withed  
by me, be attended with fuch infeparable difficulties,  
on account of their intermixture by marriages with  
the dower negroes, as to excite the moft paintul fenfa-

while both defcriptions are in the occupancy of the  
fame proprietor ; it not being in my power, under the  
tenure by which the dower negroes are held, to manu-  
mit them. Azd whereas among thofe who will receive  
freedom according to this demife, there may be fome  
who, from old age or bodily infirmities, and others who,  
on account of their infancy, will be unable to fupport  
themfelves, it is my will and defire that all who come  
under the 1ft and 2d defcription, fhall be comfortably  
clothed and fed by my heirs while they live ; and that  
fuch of the latter defcription as have no parents living,  
or if living, are unable or unwilling to provide for  
them, fhall be bound by the Court till they fhall arrive  
at the age of twenty-five years ; and in cafes where no  
record can be produced whereby their ages can be af.  
certained, the judgment of the Court, upon its own view  
of the fubjeét, fhall be adequate and final. The ne-  
groes thus bound are (by their mafters or miftreffes)  
to be taught to read and write, and to be brought up to  
fome ufeful occupation, agreeable to the laws of the faid  
Commonwealth of Virginia, providing for the fupport  
of orphan and other poor children. And I do hereby  
exprefsly forbid the fale, or tranfportation out of the faid  
Commonwealth, of any flave I may die poffeffed of,  
under any pretence whatever. And I do moreover  
moft folemnly and moft pointedly enjoin it upon my er-  
ecutors hereafter named, or the furvivor of them, to fee  
that ¢Ais claufe refpeéting flaves, and every part thereof,  
be religioufly fulfilled at the epocha at which it is di-  
reéted to take place, ‘without evafion, negleét, or delay,  
after the crops which may then be in the ground are  
harvefted, particularly as it refpeéts the aged and in-  
firm: feeing that a regular and permanent fund be ef-  
tablithed for their fupport as long as there are fubjeéts  
requiring it, not trufting to the uncertain provifion to

town of Alexandria, I give and bequeath (in truft)  
four thoufand dollars, or in other words, twenty of the  
fhares which I hold in the Bank of Alexandria, to-  
wards the fupport of a free {chool, eftablifhed at and an-  
nexed to the faid Academy, for the purpofe of edu-  
cating fuch orphan children, or the children of fuch  
other poor and indigent perfons as are unable to accom-  
plifh it with their own means; and who, in the judg-  
ment of the truftees of the faid feminary are beft en-  
titled to the benefit of this donation. The aforefaid  
twenty fhares I give and bequeath in perpetuity ; the  
dividends only of which are to be drawn for, and ap-  
plied by, the faid truftees for the time being, for the  
ufes above-mentioned : the ftock to remain entire and  
untouched, unlefs indications of failure of the faid Bank  
fhould be fo apparent, or a difcontinuance thereof fhould  
render the removal of this fund neceffary. In either  
of thefe cafes, the amount of the ftock here devifed is  
to be vefted in fome other bank, or public inftitution,  
whereby the intereft may with regularity and certainty  
be drawn and applied as above. And to prevent mif-  
conception, my meaning is, and is hereby declared to  
be, that thefe twenty fhares are in lieu of, and not in  
addition to, the twenty thoufand pounds given by a  
miffive letter fome years ago; in confequence whereof,  
an annuity of fifty pounds has fince been paid towards  
the fupport of this mftitution.  
  
Item. Whereas by a law of the Commonwealth of  
Virginia, enaéted in the year 1735, the legiflature  
thereof was pleafed, as an evidence of its approbation of  
the fervices I had rendered the public during the revo-  
lution, and partly, I believe, in confideration of my  
having fuggefted the vaft advantages which the com-  
munity would derive from the extenfion of its inland  
navigation, under legiflative patronage, to prefent me  
with one hundred fhares, of one hundred dollars each,  
inthe incorporated company eftablifhed for the pur-  
pofe of extending the navigation of James River from

Tydewater to the mountains ; and alfo with fifty thares  
of one hundred pounds fterling each, in the corporation  
of another company, likewife eftablithed for the fimilar  
purpofe of opening the navigation of the river Potomac,  
from Tidewater to Fort Cumberland; the acceptance  
of which, though the offer avas highly honourable and  
gratefulto my feelings, was refufed, as inconfiftent with  
a principle which I had adopted, and never departed  
from, namely, not to receive pecuniary compentfation  
for any fervices I could render my country in its ardus  
ous ftruggle with Great Britain, for its rights, and bes  
caufe I had evaded fimiiar propofitions from other ftates  
inthe Union. Adding to this refufal, however, an ins  
timation that if it fhould be the pleafure of the legifla.  
ture to permit me to appropriate the faid fhares to  
public ufes, 1 would receive them on thofe terms with  
due fenfibility ; and this it having confented to in flat.  
tering terms, as will appear by a fubfequent law, and  
fundry refolutions, in the mott ample and honourable  
manner ; I proceed, after this recital, for the more cor-  
re&amp;t underftanding of the cafe, to declare, that it has  
always been a fource of ferious regret with me to fee  
the youth of thefe United States fent to foreign coun  
tries for the purpofe of education, often before their  
minds were formed, or they had imbibed any adequate  
ideas of the happine(s of their own, contraéting too fre-  
quently, not only habits of diffipation and extravagance,  
but principles unfriendly to Republican government,  
and to the true and genuine liberties of mankind, which  
thereafter are rarely overcome. For thefe reaions it  
has been my ardent with to fee a plan devifed on a li-  
beral fcale, which would have a tendency to fpread  
fy {tematic ideas through all parts of this rifing empire,  
thereby to do away local attachments and ftale preju-  
dices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed  
ought, to admit from our national councils. Looking  
anxioufly forward to the accomplifhment of fo defirable  
an object as this is (in my eftimation), my mind —=

the meafure, than to eftablifh an UNIVERSITY, ina  
central part of the United States, to which the youths  
of fortune and talents, from all parts thereof, might be  
fent for the completion of their education, in all the  
branches of poiite literature, in arts and f{ciences, in ac-  
quiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good  
government, and (as a matter of infinite importance in  
my judgment ) by affociating with each other, and form-  
ing friendthip in juvenile years, be enabled to free  
themfelves, in a proper degree, from thofe local preju-  
dices, and habitual jealoufies, which have juf been  
mentioned ; and which, when carried to excefs, are  
never-failing fources of difquietude to the public mind,  
and pregnant with mifchievous confequences to this  
country : under thefe impreffions fo fully dilated,  
  
Item. I give and bequeath, in perpetuity, the fifty  
fhares I hold in the Potomac Company (under the  
aforefaid aéts of the Legiflature of Virginia), towards  
the endowment of an Univerfity, to be eftablithed  
within the limits of the diftri€ét of Columbia, under the  
aufpices of the general government, if that government  
fhould incline to extend a foftering hand towards it;  
and until fuch feminary is eftablithed, and the funds  
arifing in thofe fhares fhall be required for its fupport,  
my further WILL and DESIRE is, that the profit ac-  
cruing therefrom fhall, whenever the dividends are  
made, be laid out in purchafing ftock in the Bank of  
Columbia, or fome other Bank, at the difcretion of my  
executors, or by the Treafurer of the United States,  
for the time being, under the direétion of Congrefs,  
provided that honourable body fhould patronize the  
meafure, and the dividends proceeding from the pur-  
chafe of fuch ftock are to be vefted in more ftock, and

IN the name of God, Amen. If,  
George Wafhington, of Mount Vernon,  
a citizen of the United States, and lately  
prefident of the f«me, do make, ordain,  
and declare this infti uinent, which is writ-  
ten with my own hand, and every page  
thereof fubfcribed with my name, to be  
my laft will and tefument, revoking all  
others.  
  
Imprimis—All my debts, of which  
there are but few, and none of magnitude,  
are to be punctually and fpeedily paid ;  
and the legacies hereafter bequeathed are  
to be difcharged as foon as circumftances  
will permit, and in the manner dire&amp;ed.  
  
Item. To my dearly beloved wife,  
Martha Wathington, I give and bequeath  
the ufe, profit, and benefit of my whole  
eftate, real and perfonal, for the term of  
her natural life, except fuch parts thereof  
as are [pecially difpoted of hereafter. My  
improved lot ins the town of Alexandria,  
fituate in Pitt and Cameron-ftreets, I  
give to her and her heirs for ever, as I  
a.lodo my houfhold and kitchen furniture  
  
_ of every fort and kind, with the liquor  
  
and groceries which may be on hand at  
the time of my deceafe, to be ufed and  
difpofed of as fhe may think proper.  
  
Item. Upon the deceafe of my wife, it -  
  
is my will and defire that all the flaves  
which I hold in my own right fhall receive  
their freedom. To emancipate them du-  
ring her lire, would, though earneftly  
wifhed by me, be attended with fuch in-  
fuperable difficulties, on account of their  
intermixture by marriages with the dower  
negroes, as to excite the moft painful fen-  
fations, if not difagreeable confequences  
from the latter, while both de{criptions  
are. in the occupancy of the fame proprie-  
tor; it not being in my power, under the  
tenure by which the dower negroes are  
held, to manumit them. Aud whereas  
among thofe who will receive freedcm ac-  
cording to this demi, there may be fome  
who, from old age or bodily infirmities,  
and others, who, on account of their in-  
fancy, will be unable to fupport them-  
feives, it is my will and defire that all  
who come under the firft and fecond de-  
{cription, fhall be comfortably clothed and  
fed by my heirs winile they live ; and that  
fuch of the iatter defcription as have no  
parents living, or if living, are unable or  
unwilling to provide tor them, fhall be  
bourd by the court til! they fhall arrive at  
the age of pwenty-five years 5 and in cakes  
  
where no record can be produced whereby  
their ages can be afcertained, the judge-  
ment of the court, upon its own view of  
the fubje&amp;t, fhall be adequate and -final.  
The negroes thus bound, are (by their  
matters or miltrefles) to be taught to read  
and write, and to be brought up to fome  
ufeful occupation, agreeably to the laws  
of the commonwealth of Virginia, pro-  
viding for the fupport of orphan and other  
poor children. And I do hereby exprefs-  
ly forbid the fale, or tranfportation out of  
the faid commonwealth, or of any flave I  
may die poffeffed of, under any pretence  
whatever. And I do moreover moft fo-  
lemoly and moft pointedly enjoin it upon  
my executors hereafter named, or the fur-  
vivor of them, to fee that this claufe res  
fpe&amp;ting flaves, and every part thereof,  
be religioufly fulfilled at the epoch at  
which it is dire&amp;ted to take place, without  
evafion, neglect, or delay, after the crops  
which may then be in the ground are har-  
vefled, particularly as it refpects the aged  
and infirm; feeing that a regular and per-  
manent fund be eltablifhed for their fup-  
port as long as there are fubje&amp;ts re-  
guiring it, not trufting to the uncertain  
provifion to be made by individuals.

ard is hereby declared to ‘be, that thefe

five letter fome years azo; in confequence  
of which an annuity cf 50! has iince been  
paid toward the fupport of this infitu-  
tion.  
  
Item. Whereas by a law of the com-  
monwealth of Virginia, enacied in the  
year 3785, the legiilature thereof was  
pleafed, as an evidence of its approbation  
of the fervices I had rendered the public  
during the revolution, and partly, I be-  
lieve, in confideration of my having fug-  
gefted the vait advantages which the com-  
munity would derive from the extenfion  
of its inJand navigation, under legiflative  
patronage, to prefent me with one hun-  
dred fhares, of one hundyed dollars each,  
in the incorporated company eltablifhed  
for the purpofe of extending the naviga-  
tion of James River from ‘Vydewater to  
the mountains ; and alfo with 50 fhares  
of soo] fterling each, in the corporation  
of another company, likewife eflablithed  
for the fimilar purpofe of opening the na-  
vigation of the river Potomac, from Tyde-  
water to Fort Cumberland ; the accep-  
tance of which, though the offer was  
highly honorable and grateful to my feel-  
ings, was refufed as inconfiftent with a  
principle which I had adopted, and never  
departed from, namely, not to receive pe-  
cuniary compenfation for any fervices I  
could rénder my country in its arduous  
ftruggle with Great Britain for its rights,  
and becaufe I had evaded fimilar propoli-  
tions from other ftates in the union,  
Adding to this refufal, however, an inti-  
mation that if it fhould be the pleafure of  
the Jegiflature to permit me to appropriate  
the faid thares to public ufes, I woutd re-  
ceive them on thofe terms with due fenfi-  
bility; and this it having confented to in  
flattering terms, as will appear by a fub-  
fequent law, and fundry refolutions, in  
the moft amp!e and honorable manner ; I  
proceed, after this fecital, for the more  
correét underftanding of the cafe, to de-  
clare, that it has always been a fource of  
ferious regret with me to fee the youth of  
thefe United States fent to foreign coun-  
tries for the purpofe of education, often  
before their minds were fofmed, or they  
had imbibed any adequate ideas of the  
happinefs ‘of their own, contracting too  
frequently, not only habits of diffipation  
and extravagance, but principles untriend-  
ly to republican government, and to th  
  
8  
  
true and genuine liberties of mankind,  
which thereafier are rarely overcome. For  
thefe reafons, it has heen my ardent with  
to fee a plan devifed on a liberal feale,  
which would have a tendency to fpread  
fyftematic ideas through all parts of this  
rifing empire, thereby to do away local  
attachments and ftale prejudices, as far as  
the nature of things would, or indeed  
ought to admit from our national coun-  
cils. Looking anxioufly forward to the  
accomplifhment of fo defirable an objegt  
as this is (in my eftimation} my mind  
has not been able to contemplate any plan  
more likeiy to effe&amp; the meafure than to  
eftablith an Univerfity, in a central part  
of the United States, to which the youths  
of fortune and talents, from all parts  
thereof, might be fent for the completion  
of their education, in all the branches of  
polite literature, in arts ad fciences, in  
acquiring knowledge in the principles of  
politics and good government, and (as a  
matter of infinite importance in my judge-  
ment) by affociating with each other, and  
forming friendfhip in juvenile years, be  
enabied to free themfelves, in a proper  
degree, from thofe local prejudices and  
habitual jealoufies, which have juft been  
mentioned ; and which, when carried to  
excefs, are neverfailing fources of difquie-  
tude to the public mind, and pregnant  
with mifchieveus coniequences to this  
country: Under theie impreffions {fo fully  
dilated,  
  
Tim. I give and bequeath, in perpe-  
tuity, the fitty fhares I hold in the Pote-  
mac company (under the aforcfaid aéts of  
the legiflature of Virginia) toward the  
endowmert of an univerfity, to be efta-  
blished within the limits of the diftrict of  
Columbia, under the aufpices of the gene-  
ral government, if that government fhould  
incline to extend a foflering hand toward  
it; and until fuch feminary is eftablifhed,  
and the fands arifing in thofe fhares thal  
be required for its fupport, my further  
will and defire is, that the profit accruing  
therefrom fhall, whenever the dividends  
are made, be laid out in purchafing ttock  
in the bank of Columbia, or fome other  
bank, at the difcretion of my executors,  
or by the treafurer of the United States  
tor the time being, under the direction of  
congrefs, provided that honorable body  
fhould patronife the meafure, and the di-  
vidends proceeding from the purchafe of  
fuch ftock are to be vefted in more ftock,  
and fo on until a fum adequate to the ac-  
complifhment ot the objeét is obtained ; of  
which I have not the finaileft doubt betore

thority, or from any other fource.

ho&#x27;d in the James River company, I have  
given, and now confirm in perpetuity, to  
snd for the ufe of Liberty-hal! academy,

Item. I releafe, exonerate, and dif-  
charge the eltate of my deceafed brother  
Samuel Wafhington, from the payment  
of the money which is due to me for the  
Jand I fold to Phitip Pendleton (lying in  
the county of Berkeley) who affigned the  
fame to him the {aid Samuel, and his fon  
Thornton Wafhington ; the latter be-  
came pofleffcd of the aforefaid land with-  
out any conveyance having paffed trom  
me, either to the faid Pendleton, the faid  
Samuel, or the faid Thornton, and with-  
out any coniideration having been made,  
by which negle&amp; neither the legal nor e-  
quitable title has been alienated ; it refts  
theretcre with me to declare my intentions  
concerning the premifes; and thefe are to  
give and bequeath the faid land to whom-  
foever the faid Thornton Wafhington  
(who is alfo dead) devifed the fame, or to  
his heirs for ever, if he died inteltate; ex-

contract with the faid P. Pendleton, would  
amcunt to more than a thouland pounds.  
And whereas two other fons of my faid  
deceated brother Samuel, viz. George  
Steptoe Wafhington and Lawrence Au-  
gultine Wafhington, were, by the deccafe  
of thofe to whole cave they were commit-  
ted, brought under my prote@tion, and,  
in confequence, have occafioned advances  
on my part for their education at coilege  
and other f{chools, for their board, cicth-  
ing, and other incidental expences, to the  
amount of near 5000 dollars, over  
and above the fums furnifhed by their  
e(late, which fum it may be inconvenicnt  
for them or their father’s eftate to re-  
tund; I do, for thefe reafons, acquit them  
and the {aid eitate from the payment  
thereof ; my intention being, that all ac-  
counts between them and me, and their  
father’s eltaie and me, fhall ftand ba-  
janced.  
  
Item. The balance due to me from the  
eRtate of Bartholomew Dandridge, de-  
cealed (my wife’s brother) and which a-  
mounted on the firft day of O&amp;ober, 1795,  
to 4251 (as wall appear by an account

rendered by his deceafed fon, John Dan-  
dridge, who was the a@ling executor of  
his father’s will) I releafe and acquit from  
the payment thereof; and the negroes  
(then 33 in number) formerly belonging  
to the faid eftate, who were taken ‘in exe-  
cution, fold and purchafed in on my ac-  
count, in the year | /ank] and ever fince  
have remained in the poffeifion, and to the  
ule of Mary, widow of the faid Bartholo-  
mew Dandridge, with their increafe, it  
is my will and defire, fhall continue to be  
in her pofleflion, without paying hire, or  
making compenfation for the iame, for  
the time paft or to come, during her na-  
tural life, at the expiration of which, I  
dire&amp; that all of them, who are 4o years  
old and upward, fhall receive their tree-  
dom ; all under that age, and above 16,  
fhall ferve feven years, and no longer ;  
and all under 16 years, fhall ferve until  
they are 25 years of age, and then to be  
free; and to avoid difputes refpecting the  
ages of any of thofe negroes, they are to  
be taken into the court of the county in  
which they refide, and the judgement  
thereof, in this relation, fhail be final,  
and record thereof made, which may be  
adduced as evidence at any time thereafter,  
if difputes fhould ariie concerning the  
fame ; and I further direst that the heirs  
of the faid Bartholomew Dandridge fhall  
equally fhare the benefits arifing from the  
fervice of the faid negroes, according to  
the tenor of this devile, upon the deceale  
of their mother,

married with my neice, Betty Lewis, is  
not fufficiently fecured in the title to the

Item. To iny nephew, Wiliam Au-

at the ford of Dogue Run, near my mill,  
and extending along the road, and bound-  
ed thereby, as it now goes and ever has  
gone fince my recolle&amp;tion of it, to the  
ford of Little Hunting Creek, at the Gum  
Spring, until it comes toa knowl oppo-  
fite an old yoad which formerly pafled  
through the lower field of Mu idyhuie  
Farm ; at w! hich, 0 on the north fide of the  
faid road, are three red or Spanifh oaks,  
marked as a corner, and a ttene placed :  
thence by a line of trees to be marked rec-  
tangular to the back line or outer Dounda-  
ry of the tra&amp; between Thompfon Mafon  
and myfef: thence w ith that line eatterly  
(now double ditching with a poft and rail  
fence thereon) to the run of Little Hunt-  
ing Creek 5 thence with that run, which  
is the boundary between the lands of the  
Jate Humphrey Peake and me, to the tide-  
water of the faid creek: thence by that  
water to Potomac River ; thence with the  
river to the mouth of Dogue Creck 5 and  
thence with the faid Dogue,of Creek to  
the place of hesinning at the aforefaid  
ford, containing upward of four thoufand  
acres, be the f«me more or lefs, together  
with the manfion. houfe, and all other  
buildings and improvements thereon.  
Second. In confideration of the confan-  
guinity between them and my wife, being  
as nearly related to her as to myfeif, as on  
account of the affeion I had for, and  
the obligation I was under, to their fae  
ther, when living, who, from his youth,  
had attached himfclf to my perfon, and  
followed my fortunes through the vicifli-  
tudes of the late revolution, afterward  
devoting his time to the fuperintendance  
ot my private concerns for many years,  
while my public employments rendered it  
impracticable for me to do it mytelt,  
thereby affording me effential fervices, and  
peal performing them in a manner moft  
filial and refpecttul ; for thefe reafons, 1  
fay, I give and bequeath to George Fay-  
ette Wathington, and Lawrence Augul-  
tine Wafhington, dnd their heirs, my  
eftate ealt of Li:tde Hunting Creek, lying  
on the river Potomac, including the farin  
of three hundre.t and fixty acres, leafed to  
Tobias Lear, as noticed before, and con-  
taining in the whole, by deed, two thou-  
fand and twenty acres, be it more or lets ;  
whith fiid eftate it is my will and dehre  
fhould be equitably and advantageoufly  
divided between them, according to quan-  
tity, quality, and other circeumftances,  
when the youngell fhail arrive at the age  
of twenty-one years, by three judicious  
and difintereited men 3 one to be chogn  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
by each of the brothers, and the third by  
thefe two. In the mean time, if the ter~  
mination of my wife’s intereft therein  
fhould have ceafed, the profits arifing  
therefrom are to be applied for their joint  
ufes and benefit.  
  
Third. And whereas it has always  
been my intention, fince my expe&amp;ation  
of having iffue has ceafed, to confider the  
grand-children of my wife in the fime  
light as I do my own relations, and to  
act a friendly part by them, more efpe-  
cially by the two whom we have raifed  
from their — infancy, namelv, Elca.  
nor Park. Cuttis, and George Wathing-  
ton Park Cultis. ” And whereas the fore  
mer of thefe bath lately intermarvied with  
Lawrence Lewis, a fon of my deceafed  
fitter, Betty Lewis, by which union the  
inducement to provide for them both has  
been increafed :—-Wherefore I. give and  
bequeath to the faid Lawrence Lewis and  
Eleanor Park Lewis, his wife, and their  
heirs, the refidue of my Mount Vernon  
eltate, not already deviled to my nephew  
Buthrod Wafhington, comprehended with-  
in the following defcrip ion, viz. All the  
lands north of the road leading fiom the  
ford of Dogue Run to the Gum Spring,  
as decribed in the devife of the other pare  
of the tract, to Bufhrod Wathington, un-  
til it comes ns the fione and three red or  
Spanifk oaks on the knowl, thence with  
the rectangular line to the back line (be-  
tween Mr. Malon and me); thence with  
that line welterly along the new doub&#x27;e  
ditch to Dogue Run by the tumbling dam  
of niy mils, thence with the faid 1un to  
the ford aforementioned, to which I add  
all the land I poffels weit of the fad  
Dogue Run and Dogue Creek, bounded  
eaiterly aud foutherly thereby ; together  
with the mull, diltillery, and all other  
hcufes and improvements on ihe premifes,  
m iking together about two thouland acres,  
be it more or lefs.  
  
Fourth. Agtuated by the principte al-  
ready mentioned, I give and bequeath to  
George Wathington Park Cuittis, the  
grand{fon of my wite, and my ward, and  
to his heirs, the wa&amp; I bold on Four  
Mile Run, in the vicinity of Alexandria,  
containing 1200 acres, more or lefs, and  
my entire {quare, number 21, in the city  
of Wathington.  
  
Fifth. All the ret and refidue of my  
eftate, real and pertonal, not dilpoled of  
iu manner aforeiaid, in whatloever con-  
fitting, wherefoever lying, and whenioe  
  
ver tound,’ a f{ebedule of which, as far as  
is recollesied, with a realonable climate

Of its value, is hereunto annexed, I de-  
fiie may be fold by my executors at {uch  
times, in fuch manner and on fuch credits  
(if an equal, valid, and fatisfactory dif-  
tuibution of the {pecitic property cannot  
be made without) as in their jr &#x27;gement  
fiial] be moft conducive to the intercit of  
the partics concerned, and the monies a-  
rifing therefrom to be divided into twenty-  
thiee equal parts, and applied as follows,  
viz. To William Auguttine Wathington,  
Elifaheth Spotwood, Jane Thornton, and  
the heirs of Ana Afhton, fon and daugh-  
ters of my decesled brother Auguttine  
Wathington, I give and bequeath four  
parts, that is one part to each of them—

the other four parts, one to each of them

commend it to my executors not to be  
precipitate in difpofing of the landed pro-  
perty therem directed to be foid, if frome  
temporary caufes the fale thereof thould  
be dull, experience having fully eviccid  
that the price of land (efpesiaily above  
the falls of the rivers, and on the weltern  
waters) has been progreflively riling, and  
cannot be long checked in its increating  
value. And I particularly recommend  
it to fuch of the legatees (under the  
claufe of my will) as can make it con-  
venient, to take each a fhare of my flock  
in the Potomac company, in preterence  
to the amount of what it might fell for,  
being thoroughly convinced myfeif, that  
no wes to which the money can be ap-  
plied will be fo productive as the toils  
raiing from this navigation when im

ture of things, it mult be eve long) and  
more efpecially if that of the Shenandoah  
is added thereto.  
  
The family vault at Mount Vernon  
requiring repairs, and being improper-

monly called the Vineyard Inclofure, on  
the ground which is marked out; ia  
wiich my remains, with thoie of my de-  
cealed relations (now in the old vault)  
and fuch others of my family as may  
choole to be entombed there, may be  
depotited. And it is my exprefs defire  
that my corpfe may be interred in a  
private manner, without parade or fune-

caufe Ihad evaded fimilar propofitions from other fates in the  
Union. Adding to this refufal, however, an intimation that  
if it fhould be the pleafure of the legiflature to permit meto  
appropriate the faid fhares to public ufes, I would receive  
them on thofe terms with due fenfibility ; and this it having  
confented to in flattering terms, as will appear by a fubfe-  
quent law, and fundry refolutions, in the moft ample and  
honourable manner; I procced after this recital, for the  
more corre&amp;t underitanding of the cafe, to declare, that it  
has always been a fource of ferious regret with me to fee thie  
youth of thefe United States fent to foreign countries for the  
purpofe of education, often before their minds were formed,  
or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happinefs of  
theirown, contraéting too frequently, not only habits of dif-  
fipation and extravagance, but principles unfriendly to re-  
publican government, and to the true and genuine liberties  
of mankind, which thereafter are rarely overcome. -For  
thefe reafons it has been my ardent wifh to fee a plan de-  
vifed on a liberal fcale, which would have a tendency to  
{pread fyftematic ideas through all parts of this rifing. em-  
pire, thereby to do away local attachments and ftale preju-  
dices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed ought;  
to admit from our national councils. Looking anxioully  
  
forward to the accomplilhment of fo defirable an objeét as  
  
this is (in my eftimation), my mind has not been able to con-  
template any plan more likely to efle&amp; the meafure, than to  
eftablifh an univerfity,in a central part of the United States,  
to which the youths of fortune and talents, from all parts  
thereof, might be fent for the completion of their education,  
in all the branches of polite literature, in arts and fciences,  
in acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and  
good government, and (asa matter of infinite importance in  
my judgment) by affociating with each other and forming  
friendfhip in juvenile years, be enabled to free themfelves, in  
a4 proper degree, from thofe local prejudices, and habitual  
jealoufies, which have juft been mentioned ; and which,  
when carried to excefs, are never failing fources of difquic-  
tude,to the public mind, and pregnant with mifchievous con-  
fequences to this country : under thefe impreffions fo fully  
dilated, ‘

local prejudices and habitual jealousies which have just been

the following in his Will:  
“Item. Whereas by a law of the Common­  
wealth of Virginia, enacted in the year 1785,  
the legislature thereof was pleased, as an evi­  
dence of its approbation of the services I had  
rendered the public during the revolution; and  
partly, I believe, in consideration of my having  
suggested the vast advantages which the com­  
munity would derive from the extension of its  
inland navigation, under legislative patronage,  
to present tne with one hundred shares of one  
hundred dollars each, in the incorporated com­  
pany, established for the purpose of extending  
the navigation of James Rivttf from the tide­  
water to the mountains; and also with fifty  
shares of 100/. sterling each, in the incorpora­  
tion of anothei company, likewise established  
  
for th9 similar purpose of opening the naviga  
tion of the river Potomac, from the  
to Fort Cumberland; the acceptance of which,  
although the ofFer was highly honorable!»nd  
grateful to my feelings, was refused, as^incon­  
sistent with a principle which I had adopted,  
and had never departed from, namely, not t.  
receive pecuniary compensation for any serv  
ces I couia render my country, in its arduous  
struggle with Great Britain for its rights, and  
because I had evaded similar propositions from  
other States in the Union; adding to this retu­  
sal, however, an intimation, that, if it should be  
the pleasure of the legislature to permit me to  
appropriate the said shaies to public uses, 1  
would receive them on those terms with ue  
sensibility; and this it having consented to, in  
flattering terms, as will appear by a subsequent  
law, and sundry resolutions, in the most ample  
and honorable manner. I proceed, after ibis  
recital, for the more correct understanding of  
the case, to declare, that as it has always been a  
source of serious regret with me, to see the  
youth of these United States sent to foreign  
countries for the purpose of education, often  
before their minus were formed, or they had  
imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness or  
their own; contracting, too frequently, not only  
habits of dissipation and extravagance, but  
principles unfriendly to republican government, and  
to the true and genuine liberties of mankind, which,  
thereafter, are rarely overcome. For these rea­  
sons, it has been my ardent wish to see a plan  
devised, on a liberal scale, which would have a  
tendency to spread systematic Ideas, through  
all pai ls of this rising empire, thereby to do a­  
wav local attachments and state prejudices, as  
far a3 the nature of things would, or indeed  
ought to admit, from our national councils.—

estimation, my mind has not been able to con­

ure, than the establishment of . University in the

be enabled to free themselves, in a proper de­  
gree, from those local prejudices and habitual  
jealousies which have just been mentioned, and  
which, when carried to excess, are never failing

best reward for more than human endur-  
ance and perseverance.” An Institution of  
a national character for the promotion of  
education, science and the arts, was a  
favorite object of the patriotism of Gen.  
Washington. His sentiments, and the  
frequent and recorded expression of them,  
were founded not merely in a regret at  
seeing the youth of these United States  
sent to foreign countries for edveation,  
whereby they contract ‘too frequently,  
not only habits of dissipation and ex-  
travagance, but principles unfriendly to  
republican government and to the true  
and genuine liberties of mankind.” It  
was his “ardent wish to see a plan de-  
vised on a liberal scale, which would  
have a tendency to gree systematic ideas  
through all parts of this rising empire,  
thereby to do away local attachments and  
State prejudices.” His view extended  
to education in a central position in all  
the branches of polite literature, in the  
arts and sciences, to the formation of  
friendships in juvenile years, to a freedom  
from local prejudices and habitual jealou-

Such of the young negroes as might have

unwilling to provide for them, were to be  
‘bouad by the court till they should arrive

Ien. Upon the decease of my wife, it is my will  
and desire, that all the Slaves which I hold in my  
own right shall receive their freedem. To emancl-  
pate them during her life, would, thoagh earsestly  
wished by me, be attended with such insuperable  
difficulties on account of their intermixture by mar  
riages with the dower Negroes, as to excite the  
most painful sensations, if not disagrecable con-­  
sequences from the latter while both descriptions  
are in the occupancy of the same proprietor, it not  
being in my power, under the tenuire by which the  
dower Negroes are beld, to manumit them. And  
whereas, among those who will receive freedom a  
cording to this devise, there may be some who  
from old age or bodily infirmities, and others who,  
on account of their infancy, that will be unable to  
support themselves, it is my will and desire that  
all who come under the firet and second description,  
shall be comfortably clothed and fed by my heirs  
while they live, and that such of the latter description  
as have no parents living, or if living, are unable  
or unwilling to provide for them, shall be bound by  
 the court until they shall arrive at the age of twen  
ty-five years; and in cases where no record can be  
produced, whereby their ages can be ascertained,  
the judgment of the Court upon its own view of the  
subject, shall be adequate and final. The Negroes  
thus bound, are thy their masters or mistresses)  
to be taught to read a write a to be bro&#x27;t up to  
some aseful occupation, sgreeably to the lawe of  
the commonwealth of Virginis, providing for the  
support of orphan and other poor children. And I  
do hereby expreasly forbid the sale or tranaporta.  
tion out of the said commonwealth of any Slave I  
may die posseszed of under any pretence whate  
soever. And I do moreover, moat pointedly and  
most solemnly enjoin it upon my Executors here  
after named or the survivor of them, to see that this  
clause respecting Slaves and every part thereof,  
be religiously fulfilled at the epoch at which it is  
directed to take place, without evasion, neglect, or  
delay, after the crops which may then be on the  
ground are harvested, particularly as it respects  
the aged and infirm; seeing that a regular and pers  
manent fund be established for their support as  
long as there are subjects requiring it; not trust

IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN.  
I GeorGe WasuinerTon, of Mount Vernon, &amp; Citizen of the United  
States, and lately President of the same, Do make, odain, and declare  
this insrtument, which is written in my own hand, and every page thereof  
subscribed with my name,* to be my Last Witt anv TESTAMENT, re-  
voking all others.  
  
Imprimus—All my debts, of which there are but few, and fone of mag-  
nitude, are to be punctually and speedily paid; and the legacies herein-  
after bequeathed, are to be discharged as soon as circumstances will per-  
mit, and in the manner directed.  
  
Item—To my dearly beloved wife Martha Washington, I give and be-  
queath the use, profit, and benefit of my whole estate, real and personal,  
for the term of her natural life, except such parts thereof as are specially  
disposed of hereafter. My improved lot in the town of Alexandria, situa-  
ted on Pitt and Cameron-streets, I give to her and her heirs for ever; as  
I also do my household and kitchen furniture of every sort and kind, with  
the liquors and groceries which may be on hand at the time of my decease,  
to be used and disposed of as she may think proper.  
  
Item—Upon the decease of my wife, it is my will and desire, that all the  
slaves which I hold in my own right, shall receive their freedom. To  
emancipate them during her life, would, tho’ earnestly wished by me, be  
attended with such insuperable difficulties on account of their intermix-  
ture by marriages with the dower negroes, as toexcite the most painful  
sensations, if not disagreeable consequences to the latter, while both de-  
scriptions are in the occupancy of the same proprietor, it not being in my  
power, under the tenure by which the dower negroes are held, to manu-  
mit them. And whereas among those who will receive freedom according  
to this devise, there may be some who, from old age or bodily infirmities,  
and others, who, on account of their infancy, will be unable to support  
themselves, it is my will and desire, that all who come under the first  
and second description, shall be comfortably clothed and fed by my heirs  
while they live; and that such of the latter description as have no parents  
living, or, if living, are unable or unwilling to provide for them, shall be  
bound by the Court, until they shall arrive at the age of 25 years; and  
in cases where no record can be produced, whereby their ages can be as-  
certained, the judgment of the Court, upon its own view of the subject,  
shall be adequate and final. The negroes thus bound, are (by their mas-  
ters or mistresses) to be taught to read and write, and be brought up to  
some useful occupation, agreeably to the laws of the Commonwealth of  
Virginia providing for the support of orphan and other poor children.  
And I do hereby expressly forbid the sale or transportation out of the  
said Commonwealth, of any slave I may die possessed of under any pre-  
tence whatsoever. And 1 do moreover most pointedly and most solemnly  
enjoin it upon my Executors hereafter aaah or the survivor of them, to  
see that ¢his clause respecting slaves, and every part thereof, be reli-  
giously fulfilled at the epoch at which it is directed to take place, without  
evasion, neglect, or delay, after the crops which may then be on the  
ground are harvested, particularly as it respects the aged and infirm ;  
seeing that a regular and permanent fund be established for their support,  
as long as there are subjects requiring it, not trusting to the uncertain  
provision made by individuals.—And to my mulatto man William (call-  
ing himself Wm. Lee,) I give immediate freedom, or if he should prefer  
it (on account of the accidents which have befallen him, and which have  
rendered him incapable of walking or any active employment) to remain  
in the situation he now is, it shall be optional in him to do so; in either  
case, however, I allow him an annuity of 30 dollars during his natural  
life, which shall be independent of the victuals and clothes he has been  
accustomed to receive, if he chuses the last alternative; but in full with  
his freedom, if he prefers the first; and this I give him as a testimony of  
my sense of his attachment to me, and for his faithful services during the  
Revolutionary War.  
  
Jtem—To the Trustees (Governors, or by whatsoever other name they  
may be designated) of the Academy in the town of Alexandria, I give and  
bequeath, in trust, 4000 dollars, or, in other words, 20 of the shares  
which I hold in the bank of Alexandria, towards the support of a Free  
School, established at, and annexed to, the said Academy, for the purpose  
of educating orphan children, or the children of such other poor and in-  
digent persons, as are unable to accomplish it, with their own means,  
and who, in the judgment of the Trustees of the said Seminary, are best  
entitled to the benefits of this donation. The aforesaid 20 shares I give  
and bequeath in perpetuity ; the dividends only of which are to be drawn  
for, and applied by the said Trustees, forthe time being, for the uses  
above mentioned ; the stock to remain entire and untouched, unless in-  
dications of failure of the said bank should be so apparent, or a discon-  
tinuance thereof, should render a removal of this fund necessary. In  
either of these cases, the amount of the stock here devised is to be vested  
in some other bank, or public institution, whereby the interest may with  
regularity and certainty be drawn and applied as above. And, to pre-  
vent misconception, my meaning is, and is hereby declared to be, that  
these 20 shares are in lieu of, and not in addition to, the £1000 given by  
a missive letter some years ago, in consequence whereof, an annuity of  
£50 has since been paid towards the support of this institution.  
  
Item.—Whereas by a law of the Commonwealth of Virginia, enacted in  
the year 1785, the Legislature thereof was pleased (as an evidence of its  
approbation of the services I had rendered the public during the Revo-  
lution, and partly, I believe, in consideration of my having suggested the  
vast advantages which the community would derive from the extension  
of its inland navigation under Legislative patronage) to present me  
with 100 shares of 100 dollars each, in the incorporated Company es-  
tablished for the purpose of extending the navigation ef James River from  
the tide- water to the mountains ; and also with 50 shares of £100 ster-  
ling each in the corporation of another Company likewise established for  
the similar purpose of opening the navigation of the river Potowmac  
from the tide-water to Fort Cumberland ; the acceptance of which, altho’  
the offer was highly honorable and greatful to my feelings, was refused as  
inconsistent with a principle which I had adopted, and had never depart-  
ed from—namely, not to receive pecuniary compensation for any services  
I could render my country in its arduous struggle with Great Britain  
for its rights, and because I had evaded similar propositions from  
other States in the Union: Adding to this refusal, however, an intima-  
tion, that, if it should be the pleasure of the Legislature to permit me to  
appropriate the said shares to Public Uses, I would receive them on those  
terms with due sensibility ; and this it having consented to, in flattering  
terms, as will appear by a subsequent law and sundry resolutions, in the  
most ample and honorable manner—I proceed, after this recital, for the  
more correct understanding of the case, to declare, That as it has always  
been a source of serious regret with me, to see the youth of these United  
States sent to foreign countries for the purposes of Education, often be-  
fore their minds were formed, or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of  
the happiness of their own, contracting, too frequently, not only habits  
of dissipation and extravagance, but principles unfriendly to republican  
  
Government, and to the true and genuine Liberties of Mankind,  
Which, thereafter are rarely overcome—For these reasons, it has been  
: y ardent wish to see a plan devised, on a liberal scale, which would  
no _ enneney to spread systematic ideas through all parts of this  
dices aounites thereby to do away local attachments and state preju-  
pa ~S far as the nature of things would, or indeed ought to admit, from  
on pss Councils. Looking anxiously forward to the accomplish-  
OT heen cc desirable an object as this is (in my estimation) my mind has  
than the pero i contemplate any plan more likely to effect the measure,

Item—I give and bequeath, in perpetuity, the 50 shares which I ho.d  
  
of Virginia) towards the endowmert of a University, to be established  
within the limits of the District of Columbia, under the auspices of the  
General Government, if that Government should incline to extend a fos-  
tering hand towards it ; and until such Seminary is established, and the  
funds arising on these shares shall be required for its support, my further  
will and desire is, that the profit accruing therefrom, shall,whenever the  
dividends are made, be laid out in purchasing stock in the Bank of Co-  
lumbia, or some other bank, at the discretion of my Executors, or by the  
Treasurer of the United States} for the time being under the direction  
of Congress, provided that honourable Body should patronize the mea-  
sure ; and the dividends proceeding from the purchase of such stock are  
to be vested in more stock, and so on, until a sum adequate to the accom-  
plishment of the object is obtained, of which I have not the smallest doubt  
before many years pass away, even if no aid or encouragement is given  
by legislative authority, or from any other source.  
  
Jtem—The hundred shares which I hold in the James River Company,  
I have given, and now confirm, in perpetuity, to and for the use and be-  
nefit of Liberty Hall dcademy, in the County of Rockbridge, in the Com-  
monwealth of Virginia.  
  
Item—I release, exonerate, and discharge the estate of my deceased  
brother, Samuel Washington, from the payment of the money which is  
due to me for the land I sold to FPhilip Pendleton (lying in the county  
of Berkeley,) who assigned the same to him, the said Samuel, who, by  
agreement, was to pay me therefor : And whereas by some contract (the  
purport of which was never communicated to me) between the said Sa-  
muel and his son Thornten Washington, the latter became possessed of  
the aforesaid land, without any conveyance having passed from me,  
either to the said -Pendleton, the said Samuel, or the said Thornton,  
and without any consideration having been made, by which neglect, nei-  
ther the legal nor equitable title has been alienated, it rests therefore  
with me, to declare my intentions concerning the premises ; and these  
are, to give and bequeath the said land to whomsoever thesaid Thornton  
| Washington (who is also dead) devised the same, or to his heirs for  
  
ever, if he died intestate, exonerating the estate of the said Thornton,  
equally with that of the said Samue/, from payment of the purchase  
money, which, with interest, agreeably to the original contract with  
the said Pendleton, would amount to more than £1000. And whereas  
two other sons of my said deceased brother, Samuel, namely, Geerge  
Steptoe Washington, and Lawrence Augustine Washington, were, by  
the decease of those to whose care they were committed, brought  
under my protection, and, in consequence, have occasioned advances  
on my part for their education at college and other schools, and  
for their board, clothing, and other incidental expences, to the amount  
of near 5000 dollars, over and above the sums furnished by their estate,  
which sum it may be inconvenient for them or their father’s estate to re-  
fund—I do, for these reasons, acquit them and the said estate from the  
payment thereof, my intention being, that all accounts between them and  
_me, and their father’s estate and me, shall stand balanced.  
  
Item—The balance due to me from the estate of Bartholomew Dan-  
dridge, deceased (my wife’s brother) and which amounted, on the first  
day of October 1765, to £425 (as will appear by an account rendered by  
his deceased son, John Dandridge, who was the acting executor ofhis fa-  
ther’s will) I release and acquit from the payment thereof. And the ne-  
groes (then 33 in number, formerly belonging to the said estate, who  
were taken in execution, sold, and purchased in on my account, in the  
year , and ever since have remained in the possession and to the use  
of Mary, widow of the said Barth. Dandridge, with their increase, it is  
my willand desire, shall continue and be in her possession, without pay-  
ing hire, or making compensation for the same, for the time past or to  
come, during her natural life; at the expiration of which, I direct, that  
all of them who are 40 years old and upwards, shall receive their free-  
dom ; all under that age and above 16, shall serve 7 years, and no longer ;  
and all under 16 years shall serve until they are 25 years of age, and then  
be free. And to avoid disputes respecting the ages of any of these Negroes,  
they are to be taken into the Court of the county in which they reside, and  
the judgment thereof, in this relation, shall be final,&amp; record thereof made,  
which may be adduced as evidence at any time thereafter, if disputes  
should arise concerning the same. And I further direct, that the heirs  
of the said Barth. Dandridge shall, equally, share the benefits arising  
from the services of the said negroes, according to the tenor of this de-  
vise upon the decease of their mother.  
  
Hem—If Charles Carter,who intermarried with my niece Betty Lewis,  
is not sufficiently secured in the title to the lots he had of me in the town  
of Fredericksburgh, it is my will and desire, that my executors, shall  
make such conveyances of them as the law requires to render it perfect.  
  
Item—To my nephew William Augustine Washington, and his heirs  
(if he should conceive them to be objects worth prosecuting) a lot in the  
town of Manchester (opposite to Richmond) No. 265, drawn on my sole  
account, and also the tenth of 1 or 200 acre lots, andtwo or three half  
acre lots, in the city and vicinity of Richmond, drawn in partnership  
with nine others, all in the Lottery of the deceased William Byrd, are  
given; as is also a lot which I purchased of John Hood, conveyed by Wil-  
liam Willie and Sam. Gordon, trustees of the said John Hood, numbered  
139, in the town of Edinburgh, in the county of Prince George, state of  
Virginia.  
  
Item—To my nephew Bushrod Washington, I give and bequeath all the  
papers in my possession which relate to my civil and military administra-  
tion of the affairs of this Country ; I leave to him also such of my private  
papers as are worth preserving ; an‘, at the decease of my wife, and be-  
fore, if she is not inclined to retain them, I give and bequeath my library  
of books and pamphlets of every kind.  
  
Jtem—Having sold lands which I possessed in the state of Pennsylva-  
nia, and part of a tract held in equal right with George Clinton, late  
Governor of New York, in the state of New York ; my share of land and  
interest in the Great Dismal Swamp, and a tract of land which I owned  
in the County of Gloucester—withholding the legal titles thereto, until  
the consideration money should be paid—and having moreover leased,  
and conditionally sold (as will appear by the tenor of the said leases) all  
my lands upon the Great Kenhawa, and a tract upon Difficult Run in the  
county of Loudon, it is my will and direction, that whensoever the con-  
tracts are fully and respectively complied with, according to the spirit,  
true intent and meaning thereof, on the part of the purchasers, their  
heirs or assigns, that then, and in that case, conveyances are to be made,  
agreeable to the terms of the said contracts, and the money arising there-  
from, when paid, to be vested in bank stock ; the dividends whereof, as  
of that also which is already vested therein, is to inure to my said wife  
during her life, but the stock itself is to remain and be subject to the ge-  
neral distribution hereafter directed.  
  
Item—To the Earl of Buchan I re-commit ‘‘ the Box made of the Oak  
that sheltered the brave Sir William Wallace after the battle of Fal-  
kirk,” presented to me by his Lordship in terms too flattering for me to  
repeat, with a request ‘‘to pass it, on the event of my decease, to the man  
in my country who should appear to merit it best, upon the same condi-  
tions that have induced him to send it tome.” Whether easy or not, to  
select the Man who might comport with his Lordship’s opinion in this  
respect, is not for me to say ; but conceiving that no disposition of this  
valuable curiosity can be more eligible than the recommitment of it to  
his own cabinet, agreeably to the original design of the Goldsmiths’ Com-  
pany of Edinburgh, who presented it to him, and, at hfs request, consent-  
ed that it should be transferred to me—I do give and bequeath the same  
to nis Lordship ; and, in case of his decease to his heir, with my greatful  
thanks for the distingished honor of presenting it to me, and more es-  
pecially for the favorable sentiments with which he accompanied it.  
  
dtem—To my brother Charles Washington, I give and bequeath the gold  
headed Cane left me by Dr. Franklin, in his will. — I add nothing to it,  
because of the ample provision I have made for his issue. To the ac-  
quaintances and friends of my juvenile years, Lawrence Washington and  
Robert Washington, of Chotanck, I give my other two gold headed Canes,  
having my arms engraved on them ; and to each (as they will be useful  
where they live) I leave one of the Spy Glasses, which constituted part  
of my equipage during the late war. To my compatriot in arms and old  
and intimate friend, Dr. Craik, I give my Bureau, or, as the Cabinet Ma-  
kers call it, Tambour Secretary and the circular Chair, an apperflage of  
my Study. To Dr. David Stuart, I give my large Shaving and Dressing  
Table, and my Telescope. To the Reverend, now Bryan Lord Fairfax, |  
give a Bible in three large folio volumes, with notes, presented to me by  
the Rt. Rev. Thomas Wilson, Rishop of Sodor and Man. To General De  
la Fayette, I give a pair of finely wrought Steel Pistols, taken from the  
enemy in the Revolatiqnar War. To my sisters in Law, Hannah Wash-  
ington and Mildred Washington—to my friends Eleanor Stuart, Hannah  
Washington, of Fairfield, and Elizabeth Washington of Hayfield, I give,  
each, a Mourning Ring of the value of 100 dollars. These bequests are  
not made for the intrinsic value of them, but as mementoes of my esteem  
and regard. To Tobias Lear, I give the use of the farm which he now  
holds, in virtue of a lease from me to him and his deceased wife (for and  
during their natural lives) free from rent during his life ; at the gg  
stion of which, it is to be disposed of as is hereinafter directed. To Sally  
‘B. Haynie (a distant relation of mine) I give and bequeath 300 dollars.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
Walker daughter of John Alton, also deceased, | give each 100 dollars, in  
consideration of the attachment of their fathers to me, each of whom hay-  
ing lived nearly forty years in my family. To each of my Nephews, William  
Augustine Washington,George Lewis, George Steptoe Washington, Bush-  
rod Washington, and Samuel Washington, I give one of the Swords, or  
Cutteaux, of which I may die possessed ; a they are to choose in the  
order they are named. These swords are accompanied with an injunc-  
tion, not to unsheath them for the purpose of shedding blood, except it  
be for self-defence, or in defence of their Country and its Rights ; and  
in the latter case, to keep them unsheathed, and prefer falling with  
them in their hands to the relinquishment thereof.  
  
_ And now, having gone through these specific Devises, with explana-  
tions for the more correct understanding of the meaning and design of  
them, I proceed to the distribution of the more important parts of my Es-  
tate, in manner following :—  
  
First—To my nephew, Bushrod Washington, and his heirs, (partly in  
consideration of an intimation to his deceased father, while we were bach-  
elors, and he had kindly undertaken to superintend my estate during my  
military services in the former war between Great Britain and France,  
that if I should fall therein, Mcunt Vernon, then less extensive in doma‘n  
than at present, should become his property) I give and bequeath all that  
part thereof which is comprehended within the following limits, viz. Be-  
ginning at the ford of Dogue Run near my mill, and extending along the  
road, and bounded thereby, as it now goes and ever has gone since my  
recollection of it, to the ford of Little Hunting Creek, at the Gum Spring,  
until it comes to a knowl opposite to an old road which formerly passed  
through the lower field of Muddy-hole Farm, at which, on the north side  
of the said road, are three red or Spanish oaks marked as a corner, and a  
stone placed—thence by a line of trees to be marked rectangular, to the  
back line or outer boundary of the track between Thomas Mason and my-  
self—thence with that line easterly (now double ditching, with a post-and-  
rail fence thereon) to the run of Little Hunting Creek—thence with that  
run which is the boundary between the lands of the late H. Peake and  
me, to the tide water of the said creek—thence by that water to Potowmac  
River—thence with the river to the mouth of Dogue Creek—and thence  
with the said Dogue Creek to the place of beginning at the aforesaid ford ;  
containing upwards of 4000 acres, be the same more or less, together with  
the Mansion House and all other buildings and improvements thereon.  
  
Second—In consideration of the consanguinity between them and m  
wife, being as nearly related to her as to myself, as on account of the af-  
fection I had for, and the obligation I was under to, their father, when  
living, who, from his youth, had attached himself to my person, and fol-  
lowed my fortunes through the vicissitudes of the late Revolution, after-  
wards devoting his time to the superintendance of my private concerns  
for many years, whilst my public employments rendered it impracticable  
for me to do it myself, thereby affording me essential services, and always  
performing them in a manner the most filial and respectful—For these  
reasons, I say, I give and bequeath to George Fayette Washington and  
Lawrence Augustine Washington, and their heirs, my estate east of  
Little Hunting Creek lying on the river Potowmac, including the farm of  
360 acres, leased to Tobias Lear, as noticed before, and containing in the  
whole, by deed, two thousand and twenty-seven acres, be it more or less ;  
which said estate it is my will and desire, should be equitably and advan-  
tageously divided between them, according to quantity, quality, and other  
circumstances, when the youngest shall have arrived at the age of 21  
years, by three judicious and disinterested men; one to be chosen by each  
of the brothers, and the third by these two. In the mean time, if the  
termination of my wife’s interest therein should have ceased, the profits  
arising therefrom are to be applied for their joint uses and benefit.  
  
Third—And whereas it has always been my intention, since my expec-  
tation of having issue has ceased, to consider the grand-children of my  
wife, in the same light as I do my own relations, and to act a friendly  
part by them, more especially by the two whom we have raised from their  
earliest infancy—namely, E/eanor Park Custis, and George Washing-  
ton Park Custis. And whereas the former of these hath lately inter-  
married with Lawrence Lewis, a son of my deceased sister Betty Lewis,  
by which union the inducement to provide for them both has been in-  
creased, Wherefore I give and bequeath to the said Lawrence Lewis and  
Eleanor Park Lewis, his wife, and their heirs, the residue of my Mount  
Vernon estate, not already devised to my Nephew, Bushrod Washington,  
comprehended within the following description, viz. All the land north  
of the road leading from the ford of Dogue Run to the Gum Spring, as de-  
scribed in the devise of the other part of the tract to Bushrod Washing-  
ton until it comes to the stone and three red or Spanish oaks on the  
knowl; thence with the rectangular line to the back line (between Mr.  
Mason and me) thence with that line westerly along the new double ditch  
to Dogue Run by the tumbling dam of my mill ; thence with the said run  
to the ford afore mentioned ; to which I add all the land I possess west of  
the said Dogue Run and Dogue Creek, bounded easterly and southerly  
thereby ; together with the mill, distillery, and all other houses and im-  
provements on the premises; making together about 2000 acres, be it  
more or less.  
  
Fourth—Actuated by the principle already mentioned, I give and be-  
queath to George Washington Park Custis, the grandson of my wife,  
and my ward, and to his heirs, the tract I hold on Four Mile Run, in the  
vicinity of Alexandria, containing 1200 acres, more or less, and my entire  
square, No. 21, in the city of Washington.  
  
Fifth—All the rest and residue of my estate, real and personal, not  
disposed of in manner aforesaid, in whatsoever consisting, wheresoever  
lying, and wheresoever found, (a Schedule of which as far as is recollec-  
ted, with a reasonable estimate of its value, is hereunto annexed) I desire  
may be sold by my Executors, at such times, in such manner, and on such  
credits (if an equal, valid, and satisfactory distribution of the specific  
property cannot be made without) as in their judgment shall be most con-  
ducive to the interest of the parties concerned, and the monies arising  
therefrom to be divided into 23 equal parts, and applied as follows, viz.  
To William Augustine Washington, Elizabeth Spotswood, Jane  
Thornton, and the heirs of Ann Ashton, son and daughters of my de-  
ceased brother Jugustine Washington, I give and bequeath four parte,  
that is, one part to each of them: To Fielding Lewis, George Lewis,  
Robert Lewis, Howell Lewis, and Betty Carter, sons and daughter of  
my deceased sister Betty Lewis, I give and bequeath five other parts, one  
to each of them: To George Steptoe Washington, Lawrence A. Wash-  
ington, Harriot Parks, and the heirs of Thornton Washington, sons and  
daughter of my deceased brother Samuel Washington, I give and be-  
queath the other four parts, one part to each of them: To Corbin Wash-  
ington, and the heirs of Jane Washington, son and daughter of my de-  
ceased brother John 4. Washington, | give and bequeath two parts, one  
part to each of them: To Samuel Washington, Frances Ballgand Mil-  
dred Hammond, son and daughters of my brother Cha. Washington, I  
give and bequeath three parts, one part to each of them; and to Geo. F.  
Washington, Cha. Jug. Washington, and Maria Washington, cons and  
daughter of my deceased nephew, Geo. 4. Washington, I give one other  
part, that is, to each a third of that part: To Eliz. Park Law, Martha  
Park Peter, and Eleanor Park Lewis, I give and bequeath three other  
parts, that is, a part to each of them: And, to my nephews, Bushrod  
Washington and Law. Lewis, and to my Ward, the grand-son of my wife,  
I give and bequeath one other part, that is, a third thereof to each of them.  
And if it should so happen, that any of the persons whose names are here  
enumerated (unknown to me) should now be dead, or should die before  
me, that in either of these cases, the heirs of such deceased persons shall,  
notwithstanding, derive all the benefits of the bequest, in same manner as  
if he or she was actually living at the time. And, by way of advice, |  
recommend to my Executors not to be precipitate in disposing of the  
landed property (therein directed to be sold) if from temporary causes the  
sale thereof should be dull; experience having fully evinced, that the  
price of land, especially above the falls of the rivers and on the western  
waters, have been progressively rising and cannot be long checked in its  
increasing value. And I particularly recommend it to such of the Lega-  
tees (under this clause of my will) as can make it convenient to take each  
a share of my stock in the Potowmac Company, in preference to the amoun  
it might sell for—being thoroughly convinced myself, that no uses to  
which the money can be applied, will be so productive as the tolls arising  
from this navigation when in full operation (and this from the nature of  
things it must be ere long) and more especially if that of the Shenandoah  
is added thereto. iti  
  
The Family Vault at Mount Vernon, requiring repairs, and being im-  
properly situated besides, I desire that a new one of brick, and upon a  
larger scale, may be built at the foot of what is commonly called the  
Vineyard inclosure, on the ground which is marke¢ out—In which my  
remains, with those of my deceased relations (now in the old Vault) and  
such others of my Family as may choose to be entombed there, may be  
deposited. And it is my express desire that my corpse be interred in a  
private manner, without parade or funeral oration. $  
  
Lastly—I constitute and appoint my dearly beloved wife Martha  
Washington, my nephews William Augustine Washington, Bushrod  
Washington, George Steptoe Washington, Samuel Washington, and  
Lawrence Lewis, and my Ward George Washington Park Custis (when  
he shall have arrived at the age of 20 years) Executrix and Executors of  
this my Writ and Tesrament—In the construction of which, it will  
readily be perceived, that no professional character has been consulted,

many of my leisure hours to digest, and to throw it into its present form, |  
it may notwithstanding, a r crude and incorrect—but having endea-  
voured to be plain and explicit in all the Devises, even at the expense of  
prolixity, perhaps of tautology, I hope and trust, that no disputes will |  
arise concerning them; but if, contrary to expectation, the case should be  
otherwise from the want of legal expression, or the usual technical terms,  
or because too much or two little has been said on any of the Devises to  
be consonant with law, my Will and Direction expressly is, that all dis-  
putes (if unhappily any should arise) shall be decided by three impartial  
and intelligent men, known for their probity and good understanding—  
two to be chosen by the disputants, each having the choice of one, and the  
third by those two—which three men thus chosen shall, unfettered by  
law or Tegal constructions, declare the sense of the testator’s intentions;

f of your humanity. Would to God  
like spirit might diffuse itself generally  
the minds of the people of this country  
  
When Mrs Washington&#x27;s maid Oney  
away, Mrs. Washington desired the General  
to advertise, offering a reward for her.  
wholly declined with a laugh (and, we doubt  
not, a blush too,) saying it would appear  
finely for him to be advertising a runaway  
slave!7? It is well known  
Washington never bequeathed a slave;  
in the drawing up of that admirable  
which, as he said, it occupied many of  
leisure hours to digest, he carefully  
vided for the emancipation of all over whom  
he had any control.  
Upon the decease of my wife, it is  
will and desire that all the slaves whom  
hold in my owu right shall receive  
freedom. To emancipate them during  
life would, though earnestly wished by  
be attended with such insuperable difficulties  
on account of their intermixture by mar­  
rlage with the dower nogroes, as to excite  
the most painful sensations, if not disagree  
able consequences to the latter, while  
descriptions are in the occupancy of  
same proprietor; it not being in my power,  
under the tenure by which the dower  
are held, to manumit them.  
whereas among those who will receive  
according to this devise, thore may  
some who, from old age or bodily infirmities,  
and others who on account of their infancy.  
will be unable to support themselves,  
my will and desire that all who come

comfortably clothed and fod by my  
while they live; and that such of the  
description as have no parents living, or  
living, unable or unwilling to provide  
them, shall be bound by the court  
hey arrive at the age of twenty-five  
The negroes thus bound are to be taught  
read and write, and to be brought up  
some useful occupation.  
And I do hereby expressly forbid the  
or transportation out of the Commonwealth  
of any slave I may die possessed  
under any pretence whatever; and I  
moreover, most pointedly and most solemnly  
enjoin it on my executors hereafter named,  
or the survivors of them, to see that  
clause respecting slaves and every  
thereof be religiously fulfilled at the  
at which it is directed to take place, without  
evasion, neglect or delay after the  
which may then be on the ground  
harvested, particularly as it respects

* ‘ Item. Upon the decease of my wife it is my will and desire that all the slaves  
which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom. To emancipate them  
during her life would, though earnestly wished by me, be attended with such in¬  
superable difficulties, on account of their intermixture by marriage with the dower  
Negroes, as to excite the most painful sensations, if not disagreeable consequences  
from the latter; while both descriptions are in the same occupancy of the same pro¬  
prietor ; it not being in my power, under tbe tenure by which the dower Negroes  
are held, to manumit them. And whereas among those who will receive freedom  
according to this devise, there may be some who from old age or bodily infirmities,  
and others on account of their infancy, that will be unable to support themselves,  
it is my will and desire that all who come under the first and second description  
shall be comfortably fed and clothed by my heirs while they live, and that such of  
the latter description as have no parents firing, or if living are unable or unwilling  
to provide for them, shall be bound by the court till they arrive at the age of  
twenty-five years ; and in cases where no record can be produced whereby their  
ages can be ascertained, the judgment of the court upon its own view of the sub¬  
ject shall be adequate and final. The Negroes thus bound are (by their masters  
or mistresses) to be taught to read and write, and be brought up to some useful  
occupation, agreeably to the laws of the commonwealth of Virginia providing for  
the support of orphan and other poor children. And I do hereby expressly forbid  
the sale or transportation out of the said commonwealth of any slave I may die  
possessed of, imder any pretence whatever. And I do moreover most pointedly  
and most solemnly enjoin it upon my executors hereafter named, or the survivors  
of them, to see that this clause respecting slaves, and every part thereof, be reli¬  
giously fulfilled at the epoch at which it is directed to take place, without evasion,  
neglect or delay, after the crops which are then on the ground are harvested, par¬  
ticularly as it respects the ag^ and infirm, seeing that a regular and permanent  
fund be stablished for their support, as long as there are subjects requiring it, not  
trusti^ to the imcertain provision to be made by individuals. And to my mulatto  
man, William, calling himself William Lee, I give immediate freedom; or if he  
should prefer it (on account of the accidents which have befallen him, and which  
have rendered him incapable of walking, or any active employment) to remain in  
the situation he now is, it shall be optional in him to do so in either case. How¬  
ever, I allow him an annuity of thirty dollars during his natural life, which shall be  
independent of the victuals and clothes he has been accustomed to receive, if he  
chooses the last alternative, but in full with his freedom if he prefers the first; and  
this I give him as a testimony of my sense of his attachment to me, and for hia  
faithful services during the revolutionary war.’

be produced whereby their age can be ascer­

—aAs it has always been a source of serious regret with me to see the  
youth of these United States sent to foreign countries for the purposes of  
education, often before their minds were formed, or they had imbibed any ade-  
quate ideas of the happiness of their own; contracting, too freyuently, not only  
habits of dissipation and extravagance, but principles unfriendly to republican  
government, and to the true and genuine liberties of mankind, which thereafter  
are rarely overcome; for these reasons it has been my ardent wish to see a plan  
devised on a liberal scale, which would have a tendeffcy to spread systematic  
ideas through all parts of this rising empire, thereby to do away local attach-  
ments and State prejudices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed  
ought to admit, from our national councils. Looking anxiously forward to the  
accomplishment of so desirable an object as this is (in my’ estimation), my mind  
has not been able to contemplate any plan more likely to affect the measure,  
than the establishment of a University in a central part of the United States, to  
which youths of fortune and talents from all parts thereof may be sent for the  
completion of their education in all branches of polite literature, in arts  
and sciences, in acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good gov-  
ernment; and, as a matter of infinite importance in my judgment, by associa-  
ting with each other, and forming friendships in juvenile years, be enabled to  
free themselves in a proper degree from those local prejudices and habitual  
jealousies, which have just been mentioned, and which, when carried to excess,  
are never-failing sources of disquietude to the public mind, and pregnant with  
mischievous consequences to the country. Under these impressions,  
  
I give and bequeath in perpetuity the fifty shares which I hold in the  
Potomac Company (under the aforesaid acts of the Legislature of Virginia,)  
towards the endowment of a university to be established within the limits of  
the District of Columbia, under the auspices of the general government, if that  
government should incline to extend a fostering hand towards it; and until  
such seminary is established, and the funds arising on these shares be required  
for its support, my further will and desire is, that the profit accruing therefrom  
shall, whenever the dividends are made, be laid out in purchasing stock in the  
bank of Columbia, or some other bank, at the discretion of my executors, or by  
the treasurer of the United States for the time being, under the direction of  
Congress, provided that honorable body should patronize the measure; and the  
dividends proceeding therefrom are to be vested in more stock, and so on until  
a sum adequate to the accomplishment of the object is obtained, of which I  
have not the smallest doubt before many years pass away, even if no aid or  
encouragement is given by legislative authority, or from any other source.  
  
The hundred shares, which I hold in the James River Company, I have  
given, and now confirm, in perpetuity, to and for the use and benefit of Liberty  
Hall Academy, in the county of Rockbridge, in the commonwealth of Virginia,

of Manchester, my tenth of certain lots in  
the city and vicinity of Richmond, as also  
lot No. 139, in the town of Edinburg, Vir­  
ginia.  
Item. To my nephew, Bushrod Washing­  
ton, I give and bequeath all the papers in  
my possession, which relate to my civil and  
military administration of the affairs of  
this country, I leave to him also, such of  
my private papers as arc worth preserving;  
and at the decease of my wife, and bofore,  
if she is not inclined to retain them, I give  
and bequeath my library of books and pam­  
phlets of every kind.  
Item. Having sold certain lands which I  
possessed in Pennsylvania and Now York,  
my share in Great Dismal Swamp, and a  
tract in the county of Gloucester, withhold­  
ing the titles until the consideration money  
should be paid; also, haying leased and  
conditionally sold all my lands on the Great  
Kanawha, and a tract upon Difficult Run,  
whenever these contracts are fulfilled, the  
money shall be vested in bank stock, the  
interest whereof I give to my wife during  
her life, but the stock itself shall be subject  
to the distribution hereafter willed.  
Item. To the Earl of Buchan I recommit  
“the box made of the oak that sheltered the  
great Sir William Wallace after the battle  
of Falkirk,” presented to me by his lord­  
ship, in terms too flattering for me to re­  
peat, with a request “to pass it, on the  
event of my decease, to the man in my  
country, who should appear to merit it best,  
upon the same conditions that have induced  
him to send it to me.” Whether easy or  
not to select the man who might comport  
with his lordship’s opinion in this respect,  
is not for me to say; but conceiving that no  
disposition of this valuable curiosity can be  
more eligible than the recommitment of it  
to his own cabinet, agreeably to the origi­  
nal design of the Goldsmith’s Company of  
Edinburg, who presented it to him, and, at  
his request, consented that it should be  
transferred to me; I bequeath the same to  
his lordshin: and. in t.lm man nf l&gt;ic  
  
cease, to his heir, with my grateful thanks  
for the distinguished honor of presenting it  
to me, and more especially for the favorable  
sentiments with which ho accompanied it.  
Item. To my brother, Charles Washing­  
ton, I bequeath the gold-headed cane left  
me by Dr. Franklin in his will. To the ac­  
quaintances and friends of my juvenile  
years, Laurence Washington and Robert  
Washington, of Chotanck, I give my other  
two gold-headed canes, having my arms en­  
graved on them; and to each (as they will  
be useful whero they live) I leave one of the  
spy-glasses, which constituted part of niy  
equipage during the late war. To my com­  
patriot in arms and old and intimate friend,  
Dr. Craik, I give my bureau (or as the  
cabinet-makers call it, tambour secretary),  
and the circular chair, an appendage to my  
study. To Dr. David Stuart I give my  
large shaving and dressing-table and my  
telescope. To the Rev., now Bryan Lord  
Fairfax, I give a Bible in three large folio  
volumes, with notes, presented to me by  
the Rt. Rev. Thomas Wilson, Bishop of  
Sodor and Man. To General de Lafayette  
I give a pair of finely wrought steel pistols,  
taken from the enemy during the Revolu­  
tionary War. To my sisters-in-law, Han­  
nah Washington and Mildred Washington;  
to my friends Eleanor Stuart, Hannah  
Washington, of Fairfield, and Elizabeth  
Washington, of Hayfield, I give, each, a  
mourning ring, of the value of $100. These  
bequests are not made for the intrinsic  
value of them, but as mementos of my es­  
teem and regard. To Tobias Lear I give  
the use of the farm which he now holds  
free from rent during his life. To Sally B.  
Ilaynie (a distant relation of mine) I give  
and bequeath $300. To Sarah Green,  
  
daughter of the deceased Thomas Bishop,  
and to Ann Walker, daughter of John Al­  
ton, also deceased, I give each $100, in  
consideration of the attachment of their  
fathers to me; each of whom having lived  
nearly forty years in my family. To each  
of my nephews, William A. Washington,  
George Lewis, George S. Washington,  
Bushrod Washington and(Samuol Washing­  
ton, I give one of the swords or catteaux of  
which I may die possessed, and they are to  
choose in the order they are named. These  
swords are accompanied with an injunction  
not to unsheath them for the purpose of  
shedding blood, except it be for self-de­  
fence, or in defence of their country and  
its rights; and, in the latter case, to keep  
them unsheathed, and prefer falling with  
them in their hands to the relinquishment  
thereof.  
Item. To my nephew, Bushrod Washing­  
ton, and his heirs, I bequeath all that part

lowing limits [here the original will describe

‘In the construction of which (referring to  
his will), it will readily be perceived that no  
professional character has been consulted, or  
has had any agency in the drafting, and that,  
although it has occupied many of my leisure  
hours to digest it, and to throw it into its  
present form, it may, notwithstanding, appear  
crude and incorrect. But having endeavored  
to be plain and explicit in all the devises—  
even at the expense of prolixity, perhaps of  
tautology, I hope, and trust, that no disputes  
will arise concerning them ; but if, contrary  
to expectation, the case should be otherwise  
from want of legal expression of the usual  
technical terms, or because too much or too  
little has been said on any of the devises, to  
be consonant with law, my will and direction  
expressly is, that all disputes (if nnhappily  
any should arise) shall be decided by three  
impartial and intelligent men, known for their  
probity and good understanding , two to be  
chosen by the disputants, each having the  
choice of one, and the third by those two.  
Which three men thus chosen, shall, unfet-  
tered by ‘law or legal constructions, declare  
their sense of the Testator’s intention; and  
such decision is, to all intents and purposes,  
to be as binding on the parties as if it had  
been given in the Supreme Court of the  
United States.”

f Washington&#x27;s family, was also interest­  
ing. But to make this letter more complete I  
obtained a copy of the patriot&#x27;s will, one por­  
tion of it which I here give, to show the won­  
derful foresight of the man, and how his pro­  
phetic vision discerned in the grand futurity,  
as yet unveiled, the prosperity of the country,  
but the dangers which would menace it from  
sectional interests, sectional prejudices, hates,  
and passions. After providing for his wife and  
family and for the establishment of a free  
school at Alexandria for the education of poor  
orphan children, comes the following, verbatim:  
IteM- Whereas by a law of the Commonwealth  
of Virginia, enacted in the year 1785, the Legislature  
thereof was pleased fas an evidence of it&#x27;s approba-  
bation of the services I had rendered the public  
during the Revolution,-and partly, I believe in  
consideration of my having suggested the vast ad  
vantages which the community would derive from  
the extension of its Inland navigation, under Legis­  
lative patronage) to present me with one hundred  
shares, of one hundred dollars each, in the incor  
porated company established for the purpose of ex­  
ending the navigation of James River from tide  
water to the mountains; and with also fifty shares of  
ohe hundred pounds storling cach in the corpora­  
tion of another company likewise established for  
the similar purpose of opening the navigation of  
the iver Potomac from tide water to fort Cum­  
berland; the acceptance of which, although the  
offer was highly honorable and grateful to my  
feelings, was refused, as inconsistent with a princi­  
ple which I had adopted, and had never departed  
from, namely not to receive pecuniary com­  
pensation for any services I could render my coun­  
lry in it&#x27;s arduous struggle with Great Britain for  
it&#x27;s Rights; and because I had ovaded similar  
propositions from other States in the Union, adding  
to this refusal however an intimation, that, if it  
should be the pleasure of the Legislature to permit  
me to appropriate the said shares to publle uses, I  
would receive them on those terms with due sensi­  
bility,-and this it having consented to in flattering  
terms, as will appear by a subsequent law and sun­  
dry resolutions, in the most ample and honorable  
manner, I proceed after this recital for the more  
correct ufderstanding of the caso to declare­  
That as it has always been a source of serious re­  
gret with me to see the youth of these United State  
sent to foreign countries for the purpose of educa­  
tion, often before their minds were formed or they  
had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness  
of their own, contracting too frequently not only  
habits of dissipation and ertravagence, but princi­  
ples unfriendly to Republican Gorerum&#x27;t, and to  
he true and genuine liberties of mankind, which  
thereafter are rarely overcome. For these reasons  
it has been my ardent wish to seo a plan devised on  
a liberal scale, which would have a tendeny to  
spread systamatic ideas through all parts of this  
rising empire, thereby to do away local attachments  
and State prejudices as far as the nature of things  
would, or indeed, ougnt to adhilt from our hational  
councils, Looking anxlously foward to the accom­  
plishment of so desirable an object as this is (in my  
estimation) my mind has not been able to contem­  
plate any plan more likely to effect the measure,  
than the establishment of a university in a central  
part of the United States, to which the youth of  
fortune and talents from all parts thereof mnight be  
sent for the completion of their education in all  
  
the branches of polite literature in arts and sciences  
in acquiring knowledge in the principles of pol­  
itics and good government--and as a matter of  
infinite importance in my judgment) by associat­  
ing with each other and forming friendships, in in-  
  
venne yeurs, be enabled to free themselves in a  
proper degree from those local prejudices and hab­  
itual jealousies which have iust been mentioned  
and which when carried to excess are never fail  
ing sources of disquictude to the public mind and  
pregnant of mischievous consequences to this coun­  
try--under these impressions so fully dilated.  
IreM-I give and bequeath in perpetuity the  
fifty shares which I hold in the Potomac Company  
(under the aforesaid Acts of the Legislature of  
Virgini) towards the endowment of a University  
to be established within the limits of the District  
of Columbia, under the auspices of the General  
Government, if that Government should incline to  
extend a fostering hand towards it,--and until such  
seminary is established, and the funds arising on  
these shares shall be required for its support, my  
further will and desire is that the profit accruing  
therefrom shall whenever the dividends are made,  
be laid out in purchasing stock in the Bank of Col­  
umbia or some other Bank at the discretion of my  
Executors, or by the Treasurer of the United  
States for the time being under the direction of  
Congress, provided that Honorable body should  
patrontse the measure. And the dividends proceed.  
ing from the purchase of such Stock is to be vested in  
more Stock and so on until a sum adequate to the  
accomplishment of the object isobtained, of which  
I have not the smallest doubt before many years  
passes away even if no aid or ncouraged is given  
y Legislative authority or from any other source.  
Unfortunately the proposed measure was re­  
jected by Congress, and the James River navi­  
gation stock reverted back to the State of Vir­  
ginls. first extra session of the Fortysixt

&quot;I proceed, after this recital, for the more cor­  
rect understanding of the csme,\o declare, that,  
as it has always been a source of serious regret  
with me to see the youth of these United States  
sent to foreign countries for the purpose of edu­  
cation, often before their minds were formed,  
or they had imbibed auy adequate ideas of the  
happiness of their owu; contracting too fre­  
quently, not only habits of dissipation and ex­  
travagauce, but principles unfriendly to re­  
publican government, aud to the true and gen­  
uine liberties of manklud, which thereafter are  
rarely overcome; for these reasons it has been  
inv ardent wish to see a plan devised on a lib­  
eral scale, which would have a tendency to  
spread systematic ideas through all parts of the  
rising empire, thereby to do away with local at­  
tachments and state prejudices, as far as the na­  
ture of things would, or Indeed ought to admit,  
from our national couuoils. Looking forward  
anxiously to the accomplishment of so desira­  
ble an object as this Is ^in my estimation), my  
mind has not been able to contemplate any  
plan more likely to effeet the measure than the  
establishment of a university in a central part  
of the United States, to which the youths of for­  
tune and talents from all parts thereof might  
be sent for the completion ot their education io  
all the branches of polite literature, in the arts  
and sciences , in acquiring knowledge in the  
principle of politics and good government;  
and, as a matter ot Infinite importance  
in my judgment,by associating with eachotner,  
aud forming friendships in juvenile years, be  
enabled to free themselves in a proper degree  
from those local prejudices and habitual Jeal­  
ousies, which have just been mentioned, and  
which, when carried to excess, are never-tailing  
sources ot disquietude to the public mind, and  
pregnant with mischievous consequences to  
this country. Under these impressions,so fully  
dilated, 1 give and bequeath in perpetuity the  
fifty shares, which I hold in the Potomac com­  
pany (under the aforesaid acts of the legislature  
ol&quot; Virginia) toward the endowment of a uni­  
versity tone established within the District of  
Columbia, under the auspices of the general  
government, if that government should incline  
to extend a losleriug hand towards it; and until  
such seminary is established, and the funds  
arising on these shares shall be required for its  
support, my further will and desire is, that the  
profit accruing therefrom shall, whenever the  
dividends are made, be laid out in purchasing  
stock in tbe bank ol Columbia, or some other  
bank, at the discretion of my executors, or by  
the Treasurer of the United States for the time  
being, under the direction of Congre-s, provided  
that honorable body should patronize the  
measure; and the divideuds proceeding from  
tlie purchase of such stock are to be vested in  
more stock, and so on until a sum adequate to  
the accomplishment of the object is obtained, of  
which 1 have not the smallest doubt before  
many years pass away, even it no aid or en­  
couragement is given by legislative authority  
or from any other source.&quot;

his rule never to receive pecuniary  
compensation for any services he had  
rendered his country in it arduous  
struggle with great Britain, and how  
he had received the tendered gift for  
public uses, he proceeded to declare:  
‘That, as it has always been a source  
of serious regret with me, to see the  
youth of these United States sent to  
foreign countries for the purpose of ed-  
ucation, often before their minds were  
formed, or they had imbibed any ade-  
quate ideas of the happiness of their  
own, contracting to frequently, not  
only habits of dissipation and extrav-  
agance, but principles unfriendly to re-  
publican government, and to the true  
and genuine liberties of mankind,  
which thereafter are rarely overcome;  
for these reasons it has been my ar-  
dent wish to see a plan devised on a  
liberal scale which would have a ten-  
dency to spread systematic ideas  
through all parts of this rising empire,  
thereby to do away with local attach-  
ments and state prejudices, as far as  
the nature of things would or, indeed,  
ought to-admit, from our national  
councils. Loeking anxiously forward  
to the accomplishment of so desirable  
  
  
  
ative person wins. Negation is death.

an object as this is (in my estimation),  
my mind has not been able to contem-  
plate any plan more likely to effect  
the measure than the establishment of  
a university in a central part of the  
United States, to which the youths of  
fortune and talents from all parts  
thereof may be sent for the comple-  
tion of their education, inal branches  
of polite literature, in arts and  
sciences, in acquiring knowledge in the  
principles of politics and good govern-  
ment, and, as a matter of infinite im-  
portance, to my judgment, by associ-  
ating with each other and forming  
friendships in juvenile years be ena-  
bled to free themselves in a proper  
degree from those local prejudices and  
habitual jealousies which have just  
been mentioned, and which, when car-  
ried to excess, are never-failing sources  
of disquietude to the public mind, and  
pregnant of mischievous consequences  
to this country.’  
  
And then the Father of His Country  
proceeded to bequeath fifty shares in  
the Potomac Company toward the en-  
dowment of a university, to be estab-  
lished within the limits of the District  
of Columbia, under the auspices of the  
general government, ‘if that govern-

I&#x27;pon the decease of my wife, it is my will  
aud desire that all the slaves which 1 hold in

emancipate them during her life, would though

“T proceed, after this recital, for the more cor-  
rect understanding of the case, to declare that, as  
it has always been a source of serious regret to  
me, to see the youth of these United States sent  
to foreign countries for the purposes of education,  
often before their minds were formed, or they had  
imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of  
their own country; contracting too frequently, not  
only habits of dissipation and extravagance, but  
principles unfriendly to republican government,  
and to the true and genuine liberties of mankind,  
which thereafter are rarely overcome; for these  
reasons it has been my ardent wish to see a plan  
devised, on a liberal scale, which would have a  
tendency to spread systematic ideas through all  
parts of this rising empire, thereby to do away  
with local attachments and State prejudices, as far  
as the nature of things would, or indeed ought to  
admit, from our national councils. Looking anx-  
iously forward to the accomplishment of so de-  
sirable an object as this is (in my estimation), my  
mind has not been able to contemplate any plan  
more likely to effect the measure, than the estab-  
lishment of a university in a central part of the  
United States, to which the youths of fortune and  
talents from all parts thereof might be sent for the  
completion of their education in all the branches  
of polite literature, in the arts and sciences, in ac-  
quiring knowledge in the principles of politics and  
good government; and, as a matter of infinite im-  
portance in my judgment, by associating with each  
other, and forming friendships in juvenile years,  
be enabled to free themselves in a proper degree  
from those local prejudices and habitual jealousies,  
which have been just mentioned, and which, when  
carried to excess, are never-failing sources of dis-  
quiet to the public mind, and pregnant with mis-  
chievous consequences to the country. Under  
these impressions so fully dilated, I give and be-  
queath in perpetuity the fifty shares, which I hold  
in the Potomac Company (under the aforesaid acts  
of the legislature of Virginia), towards the endow-  
ment of a university to be established within the  
limits of the District of Columbia, under the au-  
spices of the general government, if that govern-  
ment should incline to extend a fostering hand  
towards it; and until such seminary is established,  
and the funds arising on these shares shall be re-  
quired for its support, my further will and desire  
is, that the profit accruing therefrom shall, when-  
ever the dividends are made, be laid out in pur-  
chasing stock in the bank of Columbia, or some  
other bank, at the discretion of my executors, or  
by the treasurer of the United States for the time  
being, under the direction of Congress, provided  
that honorable body should patronize the measure ;  
and the dividends proceeding from the purchase  
of such stock, are to be invested in more stock,  
and so on until a sum adequate to the accomplish-  
ment of the object shall be obtained, of which I  
  
have not the smallest doubt before many years  
pass away, even if no aid or encouragement is  
given by legislative authority, or from any other  
source. The hundred shares, which I hold in the  
James River Company, I have given, and now con-  
firm, in perpetuity, to and for the use and benefit  
of Liberty Hall Academy, in the county of Rock-  
bridge, in the commonwealth of Virginia.”

&quot;It has always been a source of serious  
regret with me to see the youth of tho  
United States eent to foreign countries for  
the purpose of education, often before  
their minds were formed, or they had im­  
bibed any adequate ideas of the happiness  
ot their own. My mind has not been able  
to contemplate any plan more likely to  
affeot the pleasure than the establishment  
of a university in a central part of tbe  
United States, to which the youths of for  
tune aud talent from all parts thereof mar  
be sent for the completion of their educa­

free themselves m a proper degree from  
those local prejudices and habitual jealous­

never-failing sources ot disquietude to the .  
publio mind and pregnant of mischievous  
consequences to this country. Under these  
impreesions:  
&quot;Item 1 give and bequeath, in perpetu­

Potomao Company, toward the endowment

these shares shall be required for its sup­  
port, my further will and desire is that tho  
profit accruing therefrom shall, whenever  
the dividends are made, be laid out in pur­  
chasing stock in tho Bank of Columbia, oi  
some other bank, at the discretion of my  
executors, or by the Treasurer of the  
United States for the time being, until a  
sum adequate to the accomplishment of tho  
object is obtained; of which I have not the

United States sent to foreign countries for

adequate ideas of thehappines.iof their own;  
contracting too frequently not only habits  
of divination and extravagance, but prin­  
ciple&#x27;s unfriendly to republican government.  
and to tlie true anil genuine internes oi  
mankind, which thereafter are rarely over­  
come; for these reasons it has been my ar­  
dent wisli to see a plan devised on a liberal  
scale, which would have a tendency to  
spread systematic ideas through all parts  
of this rising empire, tlieieby to do away  
local attachments and state prejudices, as  
far as tlie nature of the things w.ould, or  
indeed ought, to admit, from our &quot;national  
councils.  
&quot;hooking anxiously forward to the ac­  
complishment of so desirable nn object as  
this is fin my estimation), my mind has  
not been able to contemplate any plan more  
likely to elfcct the measure than tho es­  
tablishment of a university in a central  
part of the United States, to which the  
youths of fortune and of talents from all  
parts thereof may be sent for the comple­  
tion of tlieir education ill all the branches  
of polite literature, in arts and sciences, in  
acquiring knowledge in the principles of  
politics and good government, and a mat  
ter ot inumte importance, in my judg­  
ment, by associating with each other and  
forming friendship?- in juvenlbi years, lie  
enabled to free themselves from those local  
prejudices which have just been mentioned,  
and which, when carried to excess, are  
never failing sources of disqjietude to the  
public mind, and pregnant of mischievous  
consequences to their country. Under these  
impressions, so Hilly diluted, I give and  
bequeath, in perpetuity, the fifty shares  
which I hold in the Potomac Company  
(under the aforesaid acts of the legisla­  
ture of Virginia) towards the endowment

that government should incline to extend a  
fostering hand towards it, and, until such  
seminary is established, and the funds  
arising on these shares shall be required  
for its support, my further will and de­  
sire is that the profit accruing therefrom  
shall, whenever the dividends nre made, be  
laid out in purchasing stock in tlie ltank  
of Columbia, or some other bank, at the  
discretion of my executors, or bv the treas­  
urer of tlie United Slates for the time be­

It has&#x27;always been a source of serious regret with  
me to see the youth of these United States sent  
to foreign countries for the purpose of education,  
often before their minds were formed, or they  
had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness  
of their own; contracting too frequently princi-  
ples unfriendly to republican government, and to  
the true and genuine liberties of mankind; which,  
thereafter, are rarely overcome. For these rea-  
  
sons it has been my ardent wish to see a plan  
devised on a liberal scale, which would have a  
tendency to spread systematic ideas through all  
the parts of this rising empire, thereby to do  
away local attachments and State prejudices  
so far as the nature of things would, or indeed  
  
ought to, admit, from our National councils.  
Looking anxiously forward to the accomplish-  
ment of so desirable an object as this is (in my  
estimation), my mind has not been able to con-  
template any plan more likely to effect the measure  
than the establishment of a university in a cen-  
tral part of the United States, to which the youths  
of fortune and talents from all parts thereof might  
be sent for the completion of their education in  
all the branches of polite literature; in arts and  
sciences, in acquiring knowledge in the principles  
of politics and good government, and (as a mat-  
ter of infinite importance in my judgment) by  
associating with each other, and forming friend-  
ships in juvenile years, be enabled to free them-  
selves in a proper degree from those local preju-  
dices and habitual jealousies which have just  
been mentioned, and which, when carried to ex-  
cess, are never-failing sources of disquietude to  
the public mind, and pregnant of mischievous  
consequences to this country; under these im-  
pressions, so fully dilated, .. .  
  
I give and bequeath in perpetuity the fifty  
shares (value, $500 each) which I hold in the  
Potomac Company (under the aforesaid acts of  
the Legislature of Virginia) toward the endow-  
ment of a university to be established in the Dis-  
trict of Columbia under the auspices of the Gen-  
eral Government, if that Government should  
incline to extend a fostering hand toward it;  
and until such a seminary is established and the  
funds arising on these shares shall be required  
for its support, my further desire is that the profit  
accruing therefrom shall, whenever dividends are  
made, be laid out in purchasing stock in the  
  
Bank of Columbia, or some other bank at the  
discretion of my executors, or by the Treasurer  
of the United States for the time being, under  
the direction of Congress; and the dividends  
proceeding from the purchase of said stock is to  
be invested in more stock, and so on untila sum  
adequate to the accomplishment of this object  
is obtained.

systematic ideas through all parts of this rising empire, thereby to do  
away local attachments and state prejudices, as far as the nature of things  
would, or indeed ought to admit, from our national councils. Ix)oking  
anxiously forward to the accomplishment of so desirable an object as  
this is (in my estimation), my mind has not been able to contemplate  
any plan more likely to effect the measure, than the establishment of a  
University in a central part of the United States, to which the youths  
of fortune and talents from all parts thereof may be sent for the com¬  
pletion of their education, in all the branches of polite literature, in arts  
and sciences, in acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good  
government, and, as a matter of infinite importance in my judgment, by  
associating with each other, and forming friendships in juvenile years,be  
enabled to free themselves in a proper degree from those local prejudices  
and habitual jealousies which have just been mentioned, and which, when  
carried to excess, are never-failing sources of disquietude to the public  
mind, and pregnant of mischievous consequences to this country.  
Under these impressions, so fully dilated.  
  
Item. ... I give and bequeath, in perpetuity, the fifty shares which  
I hold in the Potomac Company, . . . . towards the endowment of a  
University, to be established within the limits of the District of Colum¬

should incline to extend a fostering hand towards it. . .
