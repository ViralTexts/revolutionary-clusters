sir,  
stoney Point [N.Y.] July 17 1779  
  
I have the honor of giving you a full &amp; particular relation of the reduction of this post by the light Infantry under my command.  
On the 15th instant at twelve o Clock we took up our line of march from Sandy beach, distant 14 miles from this place; The roads being exceedingly bad and narrow, and having to pass over high mountains, through deep morasses, and difficult defiles, we were obliged to move in single file, the greatest part of the way. At 8 o Clock in the evening, the van arrived at Mr Springsteels within 1½ miles of the enemy, and formed into Columns as fast as they came up, agreeable to the order of Battle annexed; viz. Colonels Febeger’s and Megg’s regiments with Major Hull’s detachment formed the right column; Colo. Butler’s regt &amp; Major Murfeys two companies the left. The troops remained in this position until several of the principal officers, with myself had returned from reconnoitring the works. Half after eleven o Clock being the hour fixed on, the whole moved forward; the Van of the right consisted of One Hundred and Fifty volunteers, properly officered; who advanced with unloaded musquets and fixed Bayonets under the command of Lieut. Colo. Fleury; these were preceded by twenty picked men &amp; a vigilant, &amp; brave officer to remove the abbatis and other obstructions. The Van of the left consisted of one hundred volunteers, under the command of Major Steward with unloaded  
  
musquets, and fixed bayonets, also preceeded by a brave and determined officer with twenty men for the same purpose as the other.  
At 12 o Clock the assault was to begin on the right, and left flanks of the enemies works, whilst Major Murfey amused them in front; but a deep morass covering their whole front, and at this time overflowed by the tide, together with other obstruct⟨ions⟩ rendered the approaches more difficult than were at first apprehended, so that it was about twenty minutes after twelve before the assault began, previous to which I placed myself at the Head of Febeger’s regt or right Column, and gave the troops the most pointed orders not to fire on any account, but place their whole dependance on the Bayonet; which order was literally &amp; faithfully obeyed.  
Neither the deep morass, the formidable, and double rows of abbatis, or the strong works in front, and flank could damp the ardour of the troops, who in the face of a most tremendous, and incessant fire of Musquetry, and from Cannon loaded with grape shot forced their way at the point of the bayonet through every obstacle, both columns meeting in the center of the enemies works nearly at the same instant. Too much praise cannot be given to Lieut. Colo. Fleury (who struck the enemies standard with his own hand) and to Major Steward, who commanded the advanced parties, for their brave, and prudent conduct.  
Colonels Butler, Meggs, &amp; Febeger conducted themselves with that coolness, bravery, and perseverance that will ever ensure success. Lieut. Colo. Hay was wounded in the thigh bravely fighting at the head of his Battalion. I should take up too much of your Excellency’s time was I to particularize every individual who deserves it, for his bravery on this occasion, I cannot however omit Major Lee to whom I am indebted for frequent, and very useful intelligence which contributed much to the success of the enterprize; and it is with the greatest pleasure I acknowledge to you I was supported in the attack by all the Officers and Soldiers under my command to the utmost of my wishes; the Officers and Privates of the Artillery exerted themselves in turning the Cannon against Verplanks point, &amp; forced them to cut the cables of their Shiping and run down the river.  
I should be wanting in gratitude were I to omit mentioning Capt. Fishbourn, and Mr Archer, my two aids de Camp, who on every occasion shewed the greatest intrepidity, and supported me into the works after I received my wound in passing the last abbatis.  
Enclosed are the returns of the Killed and wounded of the light Infantry; as also of the enemy, together with the number of Prisoners taken, likewise of the ordenance, and stores found in the garrison. I forgot to inform your Excellency that previous to my marching, I had  
  
drawn Genl Muhlenberg into my rear, who with three hundred men of his Brigade took post on the opposite side of the marsh so as to be in readiness either to support me, or to cover a retreat in case of accident, and I have no doubt of his faithfully, and effectually executing either had there been any occasion for him.  
The humanity of our brave Soldiery who scorned to take the lives of a vanquished foe, calling for mercy reflects the highest honor on them and accounts for the few of the enemy Killed on the occasion.  
I am not satisfied with the manner in which I have mentioned the conduct of Lieutenants Gibbons, and Knox, the two Gentlemen who led the advance parties of twenty men each; their distinguished bravery deserves the highest commendation. The first belongs to the 6th Pennsa regt and lost 17 men Killed, and wounded in the attack; the last belongs to the ninth D[itt]o who was more fortunate in saving his men, tho’ not less exposed. I have the honor to be with great respect, Your Excellency’s Most obt hble Sert

of the reduction of this point, by  
the light infantry under my com-  
mand.  
  
On the 15th inft. at twelve  
o’clock we took up our line of  
march from Sandy -beach, diftant  
14 miles from this place; the  
roads being exceedingly bad and  
narrow, and having to pafs over  
high mountains, through deep  
moraffes, and difficult defiles, we  
were obliged to move in fingle  
files the greateft part of the way.  
At 8 o’clock in the evening the  
van arrived at Mr. Springfteel’s,  
within one and a half miles of  
the enemy, and formed into co-  
lumns as faft as they came up,  
agreeable to the order of battle  
annexed ; Colonels Febiger’s  
and Meig’s regiments, with Ma-  
jor Hull&#x27;s detachment, formed  
the right column; Col. Butler’s  
regiment, and Major Murtree’s  
two companies, the left. “The  
troops remained in this pofition  
until feveral of the principal of-  
ficers with myfelf, had returned  
from reconnoitering the works.  
Half after eleven o’clock, being  
the hour fixed on, the whole  
moved forward; the van of the  
right confifted of one hundred  
and fifty volunteers, properly of-  
ficered, who advanced with un-  
loaded mufkets and fixed bayo-  
nets, under the command of  
Lieut. Col. Fleury; thefe were  
preceded by 20 picked men, and  
a vigilant and brave officer, to  
remove the abbatis and other ob-  
ftru€tions. ‘The van of the left  
confifted of one hundred yolun-  
teers, under the command of  
Major Steward, with unloaded  
mufkets and fixed bayonets, alfo  
preceded by a brave and deter-  
mined officer, with twenty men,  
for the fame purpofe as the other.  
  
At twelve o’clock the affault  
was to begin on the right and  
left flanks of the enemy’s works,  
whilft Major Murtree amufed  
them in front; but a deep mo-  
rafs covering their whole front,  
at this timeoverflo wed bythe tide,  
together with other obftruétions,  
rendered the approaches more  
dificult, than was at firtt appre-  
hended, fo that it was about 20  
minutes after twelve before the  
aflault began, previous to which  
L placed myfelf at the head of  
Febiger’s regiment or right co-  
lumn, and gave the troops the  
moft pointed orde:s not to fire  
on any account, but place their  
whole dependence on the bayo-  
net, which order was literally  
and faithfully obeyed, Neither  
  
‘the deep morafs, the formidable  
  
and double rows of abbatis, or  
the {trong works in front and  
flank, could damp the ardour of  
the troops, who in the face of  
a moft tremenduous and incef-  
fant fire of mufketry, and from  
cannon loaded with grape-fhot,  
forced their way, at the point of  
the bayonet, through every ob-  
ftacle, both columns meeting in  
the center of the enemy’s works  
nearly at the fame inftant. ‘Too  
much praife cannot be given to  
Lieut. Col. Fleury, who ftruck  
the enemy’s ftandard with his  
own hand, and to Major Steward  
who commanded the advanced  
parties, for their brave and pru-  
dent condu&amp;.  
  
‘Colonels Butler, Meigs, and  
Febiger,! conduted . themfelves  
with that coo!nefs, bravery, and  
perfeverence, that will ever infure  
fuccefs. Lieut. Col. Hay was  
wounded in the thigh, bravely  
fighting at the head of his batta-  
lion. Ffhould take up too much  
  
of  
  
Domeftic Affairs.  
  
6f your Excellency’s time was  
J to particularize every individu-  
al who deferves it, for his bra-  
very on this occafion. | cannot,  
however, omit Major Lee, to  
whom I am indebted for frequent  
and very ufeful intelligence, which  
contributed much to the fuccefs  
of the enterprize, and it is with  
_ the greateft pleafure I acknow-  
ledge to you I was fupported in  
the attack by all the officers and  
foldiers under my command, to  
the utmoft of my wifhes. “Ihe  
oficers and privates of the artil-  
lery exerted themfelves in turn-  
&#x27; ing the cannon againft Verplank’s  
point, and forced them to cut  
the cables of their fhipping, and  
run down the river,

every occalion fhewed the great-  
eft intrepidity, and fupported me  
into the works after | received  
* my wound in paffing the laft ab-

The humanity of our brave  
foldiery, who fcorned to take the  
lives of a vanquifhed foe calling

honour on them, and accounts  
forthe few of the enemy killed  
on the occafion.  
  
I am not fatisfied with the

high mountains, through deep moraiies and difficult defiles, _we were obliged to move in fingle

being the time fixed upon, the whole moved forward, the van of the right confifting of 150 vo-

’ Stony Point, July 17th, 1779.  
  
Sir,—I have now the honour of giving your  
Excellency a full and particular account of the  
reduction of this post, by the light troops under  
my cominand.  
  
On the 15th inst. at twelve o’clock, we took  
up our line of march from Sandy Beach, distant  
about fourteen miles from this place;—the roads  
being exceedingly bad and narrow, and having  
to pass over high mountains, and through such  
deep morasses and difficult defiles, that we were  
obliged the greatest part of the way to move In  
single files. At eight o’clock in the evemng,  
the van arrived at a Mr. Springsteel’s, within  
one mile and a half of the enemy’s lines, and  
formed into columns as fast as they came Up,  
agreeable to the order of battle herewith trans-  
mitted, (vide order.) Colonel Febiger’s and  
Colonel Meigs’ regiments, with Major Hull’s  
detachment, formed the right column, Colonel  
Butler’s regiment, and Major Murfree’s two  
companies, the left. ‘The troops remained in  
this position until several of the prineipal affi-

cers, with myself, returned from reconnoitring  
the works. At half after eleven, being the hour  
fixed on, the whole moved forward.—The van  
of the right was composed of one hundred and  
fifty volunteers, properly officered, with fixed  
bayonets and unloaded muskets, under the com-  
mand of Lieutenant Colonel Fleury, preceded by  
twenty picked men, headed by a vigilant officer,  
to remove the abbatis and. other obstructions.  
The van of the left consisted of one hundred  
volunteers, also with fixed bayonets and unload-  
ed muskets, under the command ajor Stew-  
ard: these were likewise preceded by twenty  
men, under a brave and determined officer.  
  
At twelve o’clock the assault was to begin,  
on the right and left flanks of the enemy’s works,  
and Major Murfree to amuse them in front; but  
from the obstructions thrown in our way, and a  
deep moraes surrounding their whole front, and  
overflowed by the tide, rendering the approaches  
more difficult than at first apprehended, it was  
about twenty minutes after twelve before the  
assault began; previous to which I placed myself  
at the head of Febiger’s regiment, or right co-  
lumn, and gave the troops the most pointed  
orders not to attempt to fire, but put their whole  
dependence on the bayonet, which was most  
faithfully and literally obeyed. Neitherthe deep  
morass, the formidable and double rows of abba-  
tis, nor the high and strong works in front and  
flank, could damp the ardor of the troops, who,  
in the face of a most tremendous and incessant  
fire of musketry, and from artillery loaded with  
shells and grape-shot, forced their way, at the  
point of the bayonet, through every obstacle,.  
both columns meeting in the centre of the ene-  
my&#x27;s works nearly at the same instant. ‘Too  
much praise cannot be given to Lieutenant Co-  
lonel Fleury, (who struck the enemy’s standard  
with his own hand) and to Major Steward, who  
eommanded the advanced parties, for their brave  
and prudent conduct. Colonels Butler, Meigs,  
and Febiger, conducted themselves with that  
coolness, bravery, and perseverance, that will  
ever ensure success. Lieutenant Colonel Hay  
was wounded in the thigh, bravely fighting at  
the head of his battalion.  
  
I should take up too much of your Excellen-  
ey’s time, was I to particularizeevery individual!  
who deserves it, for his bravery on this occasion;  
however, I must acknowledge myself indebted  
to Major Lee, for the frequent and useful intel-  
ligence he gave me, and which contributed much  
to the success of the enterprise; and it is with  
the greatest pleasure I acknowledge to you, that  
1 was supported in the attack by all the officers  
and soldiers to the utmost of my wishes; and  
return my thanks to the officers and privates of  
artillery, for their alertness in turning the can-  
non against the enemy’s works at Verplank’s  
Point, and their shipping, which slipped their  
eables and immediately dropped down the river.  
I should be wanting in gratitude, was I to omit  
mentioning Captain Fishbourn and Mr. Archer,  
my two aids-de-camp, who, on every occasion,

showed the greatest intrepidity, and supported

me into the works after I had received my wound  
in passing the last abbatis.  
  
Enclosed are returns of the killed and wound-  
ed belonging to the light corps, as also that of  
the enemy, together with the number of prison-  
ers taken; likewise of the ordnance and stores  
found in the garrison. I had forgot to inform  
your Excellency that, previous to the attack, I  
had drawn General Mublenburg into my rear,  
who, with three hundred men of his brigade,  
took post on the opposite side of the marsh, and  
was to be in readiness, either to support us, or  
to cover a retreat in case of accident; and I  
have not the least doubt of his faithfully and ef-  
fectually executing @ither, had there been an  
occasion for it. The humanity of our brave  
soldiers, who scorned to take the lives of van-  
quished foes calling for mercy, reflects the high-  
est honour on them, and accounts for so few of  
the enemy being killed on the occasion. I am  
not fully satisfied with the manner in which I  
have mentioned Lieutenant Gibbon, of the sixth,  
and Lieutenant Knox, of the ninth Pennsylva-  
nia regiments,—the two gentlemen who led the  
advanced parties of each column. ‘The first ha

a full and particular account of the reduction of this  
post, by the light troops under my command,  
  
On the 15th inst. at twelve o’clock, we took up our  
line of march from Sandy Beach, distant about fourteen  
miles from this place;—the roads being exceedingly  
bad and narrow, and having to pass over high moun-  
tains, and through such deep morasses and difficult de-  
files, that we were obliged the greatest part of the way  
to move in single files. At eight o’clock in the even-  
ing, the van arrived at Mr. Springsteel’s, within one  
mile and a half of the enemy’s lines, and formed into  
columns as fast as they came up, agreeably to the order  
of battle herewith transmitted, (vide order.) Colonel  
  
Febiger’s and Col. Meigs’ regiments, with Major Hull’s  
  
detachment, formed the right column. Colonel But-  
ler’s regiment, and Major Murfree’s two companies the  
left. The troops remained in this position until several  
of the principal officers, with myself, returned from re-  
connoitering the works. At half after eleven, being the

oy  
  
was wounded in the thigh, bravely fighting at the head  
| of his battalion.  
} 1 should take up too much of your Excellency’s  
| time, was I to particularize every individual who de-  
serves it, for his bravery on this occasion; however, I  
| must acknowledge myself indebted to Major Lee, for  
| the frequent and useful intelligence he gave me, and  
&#x27; which contributed much to the success of the enter-  
| pris’; and it is with the greatest pleasure | acknowl-  
| edge to you, that I was supported in the attack by all  
| the officers and soldiers to the utmost of my wishes;  
and return my thanks to the officers and privates of ar-  
| lillery, for their alertness in turning the cannon against  
| the enemy’s works at Verplank’s Point, and their ship-  
| ping, which slipped their cables and immediately drop-  
ped down the river. Ishould be wanting in gratitude,  
was Ito omit mentioning Captain Fishbourn and Mr.  
| Archer, my two aids-de-camp, who, on every occasion,  
showed the greatest intrepidity, and supported me into  
| the works after I had received my wound in passing the  
| last abbatis.  
  
| Enclosed are returns of the killed and wounded be-  
longing to the light corps, as also that of the enemy, to-  
gether with the number of prisoners taken; likewise of  
| the ordnance and stores found in the garrison. I had  
| forgot to inform your Excellency that, previous to the  
attack, I had drawn General Muhlenburg into my rear,  
who, with three hundred men of his brigade, took post  
on the opposite side of the marsh, and was to be in rea-  
| diness, either to support us, or to covera retreat in case  
| of accident; and I have not the least doubt of his faith-  
| fully and effectually executing either, had there been  
| an occasion for it. ‘The humanity of-our brave soldiers,  
  
  
  
| who scorned to take the lives of vanquished foes calling  
| for mercy, reflects the highest honour on them, and ac-  
counts for so few of the enemy being killed on the occa-  
sion. I am not fully satisfied with the manner in which  
I have mentioned Lieutenant Gibbon, of the sixth, and  
  
| Lieutenant Knox, of the ninth Pennsylvania regiments,  
  
hour‘fixed on, the whole moved forward.—The van of | —the two gentlemen who led the advanced parties of  
  
the right was composed of one hundred and fifty volun-  
teers, properly officered, with fixed bayonets and un-  
loaded muskets, under the command of Lieutenant Co-  
lonel Fleury, preceded by twenty picked men, headed  
by a vigilant officer, toremove the abbatis and other ob-  
  
structions. The van of the left consisted of one hun- |  
dred volunteers, also with fixed bayonets and unloaded |  
  
muskets, under the command of Major Steward: these  
were likewise preceded by twenty men, under a brave  
and determined officer.  
  
At twelve o’clock the assault was to begin, on the  
right and left flanks of the enemy’s works, and Major  
Murfree to amuse them in front; but from the obstruc-  
tions thrown in our way, and a deep morass surrounding  
  
their whole front, and overflowed by the tide, render- |  
  
ing the approaches more difficult than at first appre-  
hended, it was about twenty minutes after twelve be-  
fore the assault began; previous to which I placed my-  
self at the head of Febiger’s regiment or right column,  
and gave the troops the most pointed orders not to at-

Neither the deep morass, the formidable and double  
rows of abbatis, nor the high and strong works in front  
and flank, could damp the ardor of the troops, who, in  
the face ofa most tremendous and incessant fire of mus-  
ketry, and from artillery loaded with shells and grape-  
shot, forced their way, atthe point of the bayonet,  
through every obstacle, both columns meeting in the  
centre of the enemy’s works nearly at the same instant.  
Too much praise cannot be given to Lieutenant Colonel  
Fleury, (who struck the enemy’s standard with his own  
hand) and to Major Steward, who commanded the ad-  
vanced parties, for their brave and prudent conduct.—
