r,  
Mount Vernon July 31st 1788.  
  
I duly received your letter of the 14th instant, and can only answer you briefly, and generally from memory: that a combined operation of the land and naval forces of France in America for the year 1781, was preconcerted the year before: that the point of attack was not absolutely agreed upon, because it would be easy for the Count de Grasse, in good time before his departure from the West Indies, to give notice by Express, at what place he could most conveniently first touch to receive advice, because it could not be foreknown where the enemy would be most susceptible of impression; and because we (having the command of the water with sufficient means of conveyance) could transport  
  
ourselves to any spot with the greatest celerity: that it was determined by me (nearly twelve months before hand) at all hazards to give out &amp; cause it to be believed by the highest military as well as civil Officers that New York was the destined place of attack, for the important purpose of inducing the Eastern &amp; Middle States to make greater exertions in furnishing specific supplies than they otherwise would have done, as well as for the interesting purpose of rendering the enemy less prepared elsewhere: that, by these means and these alone, artillery, Boats, Stores &amp; Provisions were in seasonable preparation to move with the utmost rapidity to any part of the Continent—for the difficulty consisted more in providing, than knowing how to apply the military apparatus: that before the arrival of the Count de Grasse it was the fixed determination to strike the enemy in the most vulnerable quarter so as to ensure success with moral certainty, as our affairs were then in the most ruinous train imaginable: that New York was thought to be beyond our effort &amp; consequently that the only hesitation that remained was between an attack upon the British Army in Virginia or that in Charleston—and finally that (by the intervention of several communications &amp; some incidents which cannot be Detailed in a letter; and wch were altogether unknown to the late Quarter Master General of the Army, who was informed of nothing but what related to the immediate duties of his own department) the hostile Post in Virginia, from being a provisional &amp; strongly expected became the definitive and certain object of the Campaign.  
I only add, that it never was in contemplation to attack New York, unless the Garrison should first have been so far degarnished to carry on the Southern operations, as to render our success in the siege of that place as infallible as any future military event can ever be made. For I repeat it, and dwell upon it again &amp; again—some splended advantage (whether upon a larger or smaller scale was almost immaterial) was so essentially necessary to revive the expiring hopes &amp; languid exertions of the Country, at the crisis in question, that I never would have consented to embark in any enterprize, wherein, from the most rational plan &amp; accurate calculations, the favourable issue should not have appeared as clear to my view, as a ray of light. The failure of an attempt agst the Posts of the enemy, could, in  
  
no other possible situation during the war, have been so fatal to our cause.  
That much trouble was taken and finesse used to misguide &amp; bewilder Sir Henry Clinton in regard to the real object, by fictitious communications, as well as by making a deceptive provision of Ovens, Forage &amp; Boats in his Neighbourhood, is certain. Nor were less pains taken to deceive our own Army; for I had always conceived, when the imposition did not completely take place at home, it could never sufficienty succeed abroad.  
Your desire of obtaining truth is very laudable, I wish I had more leizure to gratify it as I am equally solicitous the undisguised verity should be known. Many circumstances will unavoidably be misconceived &amp; misrepresented. Notwithstanding most of the Papers which may properly be deemed official are preserved yet the knowledge of innumerable things, of a more delicate &amp; secret nature, is confined to the perishable remembrance of some few of the present generation. With esteem I am—Sir Your Most Obedt Hble Servt

MOUNT VERNON, JULY 31, 1783.  
Sir: I duly received your letter of the  
14th inst., and can only answer you brief­  
ly and generally from memory : that, a  
combined operation of the land and naval  
forces of France and America,for the year  
1781, was preconcerted the year before;  
that the point of attack was not absolute­  
ly agreed upon,* because it could not be  
foreknown where the enemy would be  
most susceptible of impression ; and be­  
cause (having the command of the wa­  
ter with sufficient means of conveyance)  
could transport ourselves to any spot with  
the greatest celerity.; that it was deter­  
mined by me, nearly twelve mouths be­  
forehand, at all hazards, to give out, and  
cause it to be believed by the highest mi­  
litary as well as civil officers, that New  
York was the destined place of attack,  
for the important purpose of inducing the  
eastern and middle States to make grea­  
ter exertions in furnishing specific sup­  
plies, than they otherwise would have  
done, as well as for the interesting pur­  
pose of rendering the enemy less prepar­  
ed elsewhere; that by these means, and  
these alone, artillery, boats, stores &amp; pro­  
visions, were in seasonable preparation,  
to.move with the utmost rapidity to any  
part of the continent: for the difficulty  
consisted more in providing, than know­  
ing how to apply the military apparatus;  
that before the arrival of the Count de  
Grasse, it was the fixed determination to  
strike the enemy in the most vulnerable  
quarter, so as to insure success with mo-&#x27;  
ral certainty, as our affairs were then in  
the most ruinous train imaginable ; that  
New York was thought to be beyond our  
effort, and consequently that the only he­  
sitation that remained, was between an  
attack upon the British army in Virginia,  
and that in Charleston ; and finally, that,  
by the intervention of several communi­  
cations, and some incidents which cannot  
be detailed in a letter, the most hostile  
post in Virginia, from being a provincial  
and strongly expected, became the defini­  
tive and certain object of the campaign.  
I only add, that it never was in contem­  
plation to attack New York, unless the  
garrison should first have been so far de­  
garnished to carry on the southern ope­  
rations as to render our success in the  
siege of that place as infallible as any fu­  
  
ture military event can ever ne ,maue.—  
For I repeat it, and dwell upon it again,  
some splendid advantage (whether upon a  
larger or smaller scale was almost imma­  
terial) was so essentially necessary, to re­  
vive the expiring hopes and languid exer­  
tions of the country, at the crisis in ques­  
tion, that I never would have consented  
to embark in any enterprise, wherein,  
from the most rational plan and accurate  
calculations, the favorable issue should  
not have appeared to my view as a ray of  
light. The failure of an attempt against

Mount Vernon, Jult 81, 1788.  
8?: I daly received your letter of the 14th instant  
and oan only answer you briefly and generally from me­  
mory, that a combined operation of the land and naval  
forces of France and America,- for the ymt i781, was pre­  
concerted the year before; that the point of attaok was  
not absolutely agreed upon,* because it could not be fore­  
known where the enemy would be most susceptible of  
impression, and because we, having the command of the  
water with sufficient means of conveyance, could trans­  
port ourselves to any spot with the greatest celerity;  
that it was determined by me nearly twelve months be­  
orehand, at all hazards, to give out, and cause it to be  
believed by the highest military as well as civil officers,  
that New York was the destined place of attack, for  
PurP?80 of inducing the Eastern and  
. M iddle States to make greater exertions in furnish-&#x27;  
xng specific supplies than they otherwiso would have  
done, as well as for the interesting purpose of rendering  
the enemy less prepared elsewhere; that by these means,  
and these alone, artilleiy, boats, stores, and provisions  
were in seasonable preparation to move with tHe utmost  
rapidity to any part of the oontinent; for the difficulty  
consisted more in providing than knowing how to apply  
the military apparatus; that before the arrival of the  
Count de Grasse it was the fixed determination to ttrik.  
mtmy m the m0it vulnerable quarter, so as to ensure  
suocess with moral certainty, as our affairs were then in  
the most ruinous train imaginable ; that New York was  
thought to be beyond our effort, and consequently that  
the only hesitation that remained was between an attack  
upon the British army in Virginia and that in Charleston;  
and, finally, thtt, by the intervention of several commu­  
nications, and some incidents which cannot be detailed  
in a letter, the hostile post in Virginia, from being a  
provisional and strongly expected, became the definitive and  
certain objeet of tho campaign.  
I only add, that it never, was in contemplation to attaok  
New York, unless the garrison should first have been so  
far degarnished to carry on the southern operations as  
to render our success in the siege of that place as infal­  
lible as any future military event can ever be made; for  
l repeat it, and dwell upon it again, some splendid ad­  
vantage, whether upon a larger or smaller scale was al­  
most immaterial, was so essentially necessary to revive  
the expiring hopes and languid exertions of the country  
at the crisis in question, that I never would have con­  
sented to embark in any enterprise wherein, from the  
most rational plan and accurate calculations, tho favor­  
able issue should not have appeared to my view as a ray  
o light. The failure of an attempt against the posts of  
the enomy could, in no other possible situation during  
the war, have been so fatal to our cause.  
That much trouble was taken and finesse used to mis­  
guide and bewilder Sir Henry Clinton in regard to the rea&#x27;  
object, by fictitious communications as well as by making  
a deceptive provision of ovens, forage, and boats In his  
neighborhood, is certain. Nor were less pains taken to  
deceive our own army; for I had always conceived where  
the imposition does not completely take place at home, it  
would never sufficiently suoceed tbroad.  
Your desire of obtaining truth is very laudable. I wish  
I had more leisure to gratify it, as I am equally solici­  
tous the undisguised verity should be known. Many  
circumstances will unavoidably be misconccived and mis­  
represented. Notwithstanding most of the papers which  
may properly be deemed official are preserved, yet the  
knowledge of innumerable things, of a more delicate and  
secret nature, is confined to the perishable remembrance  
of some few of the present generation.

should first have been so far degarnished to

our success in the siege of that place as infal-  
litile as any future mititary event can ever be  
made ; for I repeat it, and dwell upon it again,  
some splendid advantage, whether upon a larger

essentially necessary to revive the expiring

the crisis in question, that I never would have  
consented to embark in any enterprize wherein,  
from the most rational plan and accurate cal¬

appeared to my view as a ray of light. The  
failure of an attempt against the posts of the  
enemy could, in no other possible situation  
during the -war, have been so fatal to our cause.  
  
That much trouble was taken and finesse  
used to misguide and bewilder Sir Henry Clin¬  
ton in regard to the real object, by fictitious  
communications as well as by making a decep¬  
tive provisions of ovens, forage, and boats iu  
his neighborhood, is certain. Nor were less  
pains taken to deceive our own army ; for I had  
always conceived where the imposition does not  
completely take place at home, it would never  
sufficiently succeed abroad.  
  
Your desire of obtaining truth is very laud¬  
able. I wish I bad more leisure to gratify it,

Notwithstanding most of the papers which may  
properly be deemed ofiiciil are preserved, yet  
the knowledge of innumerable things, of a more

Mouwi Vernom, July 31, 1’33.  
Sir: I duly jeceired your let’er of the 14. h inat., and can  
only answer you briefly, aud generally, from memory—that  
a combined ope ration »f the land and naval forces of France  
in America, for the year 1781, was preconcerted the year be­  
fore: that the point of sttack was not absolutely agreed upoa,*  
because it could not be foreknown when the enemy would be  
most susceptible of imoression; and because we, having the  
command of the water, with sufficient mears of conveyance,  
could transport ourselves to any spot with the greatest alac­  
trity. That it was determined by us, nearly twelve months  
beforehand, at all hazaid. to give out, and cause it to be be­  
lieved, by the highest nilitary, as well as civil, officers, that  
New York was the destined place of attack, for the important  
purpose of inducing the eastern and middle States to make  
greater exertions in ftrnishing specific supplies than they  
otherwise would have dene, as well as for the in’ere sting pur­  
pose of renderlcg the entmy less prepared elsewhere, That,  
by these means, and these alone, the artillery, boats, stores,  
and provisions were In seasonable preparation to movs with  
the utmost rapidity to any part of the continent; for the diffi­  
culty consisted more in providing than knowing how to apply  
the military apparatus. Ihat, before the arrival of the Count  
de Grasse, it was the fixed determination to strike the enemy  
in the most vulnerable quaiter, so as to ensure success with mo­  
ral certainty, es our affairs were then in the most ruinous  
train imaginable. That New York was thought to be beyond  
cur efforis, ard, consequently, that the only hesitation that re­  
mained, was b.eiween an attack upon the British army in Vir­  
ginia, and that in Charleston; and, finally, that, by the inter­  
vention of several communications, and some incidents, which  
carnot be detailed in a letter, the hostile post in Virginia,  
from being a 2 a/.d etroigly expected, become the  
definitive and certaivi object, of the campaign.  
I oily add that it was tever ia contemplation to attack New  
York unless the garrison should first h&amp;vabeeu so far de gar­  
nished., to carry on the southern operations,as to render our  
success in the siege of that place, as infaUibfe as any future

The following Is an extract:  
“Nearly twelve months before the ar­  
rival ot Count DeGrasse it was the fixed  
determination to strike the enemy lu tbe  
most vulnerable quarter, so as to insure  
success with moral certainty, as our  
foroes were In the most ruinous trim  
imaginable. New York was thought to  
be t&gt;eyoDd our efforts, and consequently  
the only hesitation that remained was be­  
tween an attack upon the British army In  
Virginia and that In ( harleston. And  
finally by the intervention ot several com­  
munications and some Incidents that  
cannot be detailed iu a letter, and which  
were altogether unknown to others, tbe  
hostile post In Virginia, from being a  
provisional and strongly expected one  
became a certain object of  
the campaign. That much trouble  
was taken and fiuesse used  
to misguide and bewilder Sir Henry  
Clinton in regard to the real object by  
fictitious communications, as well as by  
making a deceptive provision of ovens,  
forage,&quot; and boats in his neighborhood, Is  
certain. Nor were less pains taken to  
deceive our own army, for l had always  
conceived that when tbe Imposition did  
not completely take place at home, it  
could never sufficiently succeed abroad.  
Notwithstanding that most of the papers,  
which may projajrly tie deemed official,  
ar preserved, vet a knowledge of innu­  
merkble tfiltrj* of a more delicate and  
secret nalyfe is confined to tbe perish­  
able remembrance of some men of the  
present generation.
