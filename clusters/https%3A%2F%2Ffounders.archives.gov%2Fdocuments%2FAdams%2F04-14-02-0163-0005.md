		The reason, which induces travellers, who purpose a visit to the Riesenkoppe, to pass the night before at the Hempel’s baude is, that they may ascend the mountain in the morning early enough to see the sun rise, from its summit— Such was our own intention; but  
  
when we rose at two o’clock in the morning, Louisa, found herself suffering so severe a headache, that she was obliged to give up the idea of going with us; &amp; I set out accompanied only by Whitcomb &amp; our guide— We had at first a steep &amp; painful ascent for about twenty minutes; then a gentle sloping downwards &amp; a plain for a quarter of an hour, untill we came to the immediate foot of the particular hill, which bears the name of the giant’s head— The darkness of the night had been gradually dispersing, &amp; the borders of the horison at the east gradually reddening from the moment when we left the baude, so that I was apprehensive the Queen of day, as Zöllner on a similar occasion calls him, would show his glowing face before we should reach the summit, &amp; to avoid this disappointment doubled the usual pace of ascent, &amp; in another quarter of an hour stood at the door of the chapel on the top of the mountain— About ten minutes after, the great luminary arose in all his glory from the low cloud, which bordered the horison, for although the weather was remarkably fine for this region, the sky was not perfectly clear, &amp; a murky vapour hung upon the atmosphere, which intercepted a part of the immense extent of territory, which would otherwise have been within the compass of our vision. I had heard so much of the apparent magnitude of the sun’s disk, when seen rising from this spot, that when I came to see it, I found it less striking than I imagined. It appears to me about the size of a large coach wheel, but the same effect may at any time be produced to a much greater degree by looking at it through a telescope.  
					The prospect from this spot is of course more extensive, than from any other point upon these mountains, &amp; its grander is augmented by the circumstance that the eye can range freely, bounded only by the horizon, on every side. The spectator has but to turn on his heel, &amp; all Silesia, all Saxony, all Bohemia, pass in an instant before his view— It is therefore truly sublime, but it has the defect usually attendant upon sublimity, of being indistinct, &amp; in some sort chaotic— The lovel of beautiful objects must content himself with a smaller elevation— A Painter at Hirschberg, by the name of Rheinhart, who is employed by the academy of Sciences at Berlin, to paint views of the most remarkable spots in this province, observed to me, that from the highest mountains there was nothing picturesque, nothing that he could employ as a subject for any one of his paintings— When on the Schneekoppe, I felt the force of this remark, for when the eye embraces at once such an extent of  
  
objects it perceives only great masses; whereas all the pleasure that painting can afford is by the accurate representation of details.  
					The proper Giant’s head is of a conical form, &amp; the surface of the summit is not more I think than an hundred yards in diameter— Its perpendicular elevation is about 600 feet, &amp; the path by which it is ascended forms nearly a regular angle of about 45 degrees— The ascent would indeed be too steep to be practicable, but that when the chapel on the top was built in the year 1668, a flight of stone steps was made to help in mounting to it, of which a sufficient part remains to give no small assistance. The mountain itself appears to be a solid rock of granite, upon which there is no appearance of vegetation, unless a kind of red moss, resembling rust upon iron, which grows on the loose stones, that cover it on every side may be so called— These loose stones, part of which are of granite, &amp; part of a species of white flint, are in such abundance that they wholly conceal the side of the mountain itself— On one side of the path as you approach the top, a precipice of about 1500 feet opens, by the side of which you continue to mount; it ends at the bottom in a narrow vale of perhaps a mile in extent along the course of which are scatter’d a number of peasant’s huts— Here too it looks as if the body of the mountain had been riven at a single stroke, &amp; the rocks which stand on either side correspond in such a manner as to resemble the teeth of a saw— Opposite the summit to the westward, is a mountain somewhat lower, called the little koppe, from the foot of which is a sloping grass plot, that goes by the name of Rübenzall’s pleasure garden— Other remarkable spots within the view, are called his meadow, his pulpit, his grounds &amp;c. The whole neighbourhood is full of his name— I asked our guide to tell me honestly whether he had ever seen him; but he thought I was joking him, &amp; said that he had not only never seen him, but had never believed in him— That the Silesians had never given credit to the stories about him; all of which had been believed &amp; circulated by the Bohemians alone— I suppose a Bohemian guide would have assured me, that it was merely a Silesian superstition, which his countrymen had always derided.  
					The chapel at the summit, is a small round building, partly of laths, partly of stone, &amp; not more than twelve, or fifteen feet in diameter; it

ndent still owns the whole range of these mountains, &amp; is the richest subject in Silesia— The number of his vassals is said to be upwards of  
  
35000— The chapel is dedicated to St: Laurence, &amp; the Cistercian monks at Warmbrunn, are obliged to perform the mass in it, on the Saint’s day, &amp; upon four other feasts days annually.  
					After passing about an hour &amp; a half upon this spot, we thought it time to descend once more to the habitable world regions of the earth; but when we had got about half way from the bottom of the mount to the baude, who should we meet but Louisa, whose headache had left her as the day advanced, &amp; who after coming so far had determined not to return &amp; leave the most important object upon our tour unseen— I turned back of course, &amp; went up the second time with her— It was now about 8 o’clock in the morning, &amp; the sun had risen so high as partly to disperse the vapours, which had streightened the view at my first ascent— The mountain now appeared familiar to me as an old acquaintance, &amp; the temperature of the air upon it was so uncommonly mild, that we might have dispensed with putting on our cloaks— It has so happened that the three, or four days we have been upon the mountains’ have proved to be among the warmest of the year; &amp; excepting the few minutes before sunrise this morning, the cold has in no one instance been troublesome, in scarcely any perceptible degree to us— We had indeed taken the precaution to be very warmly clad, &amp; as were advised have never been without thick cloaks to put on whenever the occasion should require.  
					Sentiments of devotion, I have always found the first to take possession of the mind, on ascending lofty mountains— At the summit of Giant’s head, my first thought was turned to the supreme creator of the universe, who gave existence to that immensity of objects expanded before my view— The transition from this idea, to that of my relation, as an immortal soul, with the author of nature, was natural &amp; immediate— From this to the recollection of my country, my parents, &amp; friends, there was but a single &amp; a sudden step— On returning to the hut where we had lodged, I wrote the following lines in the book.  
					  
						From lands, beyond the vast atlantic tide,  
						Celestial freedom’s most beloved abode,  
						Panting, I climb’d the mountain’s craggy side,  
						And view’d the wondrous works of Nature’ God.  
						Where yonder summit, peering to the skies,  
						Beholds the earth beneath it with disdain,  
						  
						O’er all the regions round I cast my eyes,  
						And anxious, sought my native home—in vain.  
						As, to that native home, which still infolds  
						Those youthful friendships, to my soul so dear,  
						Still, you, my parents, in its bosom holds,  
						My fancy flew, I felt the starting tear.  
						Then, in the rustling of the morning wind,  
						Methought I heard a Spirit whisper fair,  
						“Pilgrim, forbear— Still upwards raise thy mind,  
						Look to the skies—thy native home is there.”  
					  
					But as you will probably think these lines of too melancholy, or even too gloomy a cast, task, the lines written by my immediate predecesser in the book, which may perhaps restore the tone to your spirits—  
					  
						Es ist alles eitel!  
						Ausser nur drey stück allein,  
						Hübsche mädchen, guter wein,  
						And ein volles beutel.  
						Hab ich die, so bin ich froh,  
						Und sprich auch mit Salomo,  
						Es ist alles eitel!  
					  
					Upon taking our departure from the baude, we thought the charges of the land lady rather extravagant, &amp; upon asking her in the mildest manner, how they came to amount so high, she flew into one of the most violent passions that ever deformed an individual of the softer sex, &amp; stormed in a manner that a Fury might have taken lessons from her— Our guide afterwards told us, that the reason why we found her so ill natured was because her husband had yesterday given her a severe flogging, &amp; she had not yet recovered from the ruffling of her disposition— Simple! virtuous! happy partriarchs!  
					At no inconsiderable distance from this hut are two lakes, or ponds, the water of which is deep &amp; clear, &amp; which contain some fish— We visited one of them as we returned to the place, at which we had left our cart. This spot we reached at about 11 in the morning, &amp; proceeding immediately thence, through Warmbrunn arrived again at Hirschberg at 3 in the afternoon.  
					You have now an account, probably more circumstancial than you would have wished of our excusions upon the Giant mountains,  
  
which, although in point of elevation they cannot stand a comparison with those of Switzerland, &amp; much less with those of South America, still yield an ample compensation of pleasure, for the toil &amp; trouble of ascending them. There are travellers, who think to give themselves an air of courage &amp; importance, by representing parts of this tour as dangerous— But in truth with common prudence &amp; precaution, there is no more danger than in walking the streets of any city— The roads have indeed been within the last month somewhat mended upon the expectation that the queen, who in the course of ten days is expected at Warmbrunn will be disposed to make the tour of the mountains— They have been made less inconvenient, but there was really no danger to remove.  
					There are two remarkable changes in the face of the country, as you ascend— From the bottom of the mountains about half way up, the ground is covered with tall, majestic trees, chiefly pines, &amp; firs, which gradually dwindle in size &amp; height, untill in the middle region they can no longer be called trees; but shrink to a shrub of an extraordinary kind, which I believe is commonly called, dwarf pine. It goes here by the name of knee wood, in allusion to the height, which it seldom exceeds— The stem is sometimes about the size of a man’s leg, &amp; it spreads round its branches, something in the shape of a large lustre, so as to be at least fifty feet in circumference— This bush grows up as high as what is called the kamm, or back of the whole range of mountains, &amp; the bounderies between the two provinces are shown by a narrow lane cut between these bushes all along the ridge. The region above this consits entirely of the naked rock, without a trace of any kind of vegitation.  
					We have had repeated opportunity to observe the sentiments of national aversion &amp; rivalry between the neighbouring Bohemians &amp; Silesians. At the Bohemian glass works, one of the men, who shew’d us some of their best specimens of cut glass, boastingly said to us— “You have seen nothing like this in Silesia—” And upon our return, a glass merchant at Warmbrunn shew’d us a large wine glass, with a landscape cut upon it, very beautifully executed, though done more than a century ago— “You saw nothing like this at the glass works in Bohemia”—said he— But the story I have related concerning the old dispute, respecting the source of the Elbe you will perceive that these neighbourly jealousies are of a more antient date, than the period when the two provinces belonged to different &amp; rival sovereigns.

‘nt upon sublimity, of being indistinct, and in}  
  
Sciences at Berlin, to paint views of the most  
remarkable spots in this province, observed to  
me, that from the highest mountains there was  
nothing picturésque, nothing that he could em-  
ploy as a subject for any one of his paintings.—  
When on the Schneekoppe, I felt the force of  
his remark ; for when the eye embraces, at once,  
such an extent of objects, it perceives only great  
masses ; whereas, all the pleasure that painting  
can afford, is by the accurate representation of  
details.  
  
The proper Giant’s head, is of a conical form,  
and the surface of the summit is not more, I  
think, than“an hundred yards in diameter ; its  
perpendicular elevation is about six hundred  
feet, and the path, by which it is ascended, forms  
nearly a regular angle of about 45 degrees: the  
ascent would indeed be too steep to be practica-  
ble, but that when the chapel, on the top, was  
built, in the year 1668, a flight of stone steps  
was made to help in mounting to ity of whicha  
sufficient part remains, to give no small assis-  
tance. The mountain itself appears to be a solid  
block of granite, upon which there is no appear-  
ance of vegetation, unless a kind of red moss,  
resembling rust upon iron, which grows on the  
loose stones that cover it on every side, may be  
so called: these loose stones, part of which are  
of granite, and part of a species of white flint,  
are in such abundance, that they wholly conceal  
the side of the mountain itself. On one side of  
the path, as you approach the top, a precipice of  
about 1500 feet, opens, by the side of which  
you continue to mount; it ends at the bottom, in  
a marrow vale, of perhaps a mile in extent,  
along the course of which are scattered a num-  
ber of peasant’s huts. Here too it looks, as if  
the body of the mountain had been riven at a  
single stroke, and the rocks, which stand on ei-  
ther side, correspond in such a manner as to re-  
semble the teeth of asaw. Opposite the sum-  
mit, to the westward, is a mountain, somewhat  
lower, called the Little Koppe, from the foot of  
which isa sloping grass-plot, that goes by the  
name of Riibenzahl’s pleasure garden: other re-

of which had been believed and circulated by the

dant still owns the whole range of these moun-  
tains, and is the richest subject in Silesia. The  
number of his vassals is said to be upwards of  
35000. The chapel is dedicated to St. Laurence,  
and the Cistercian monks, at Warmbrunn, are  
obliged to perform the mass in it, on the Saint’s  
day, and upon four other feast days, annually.  
  
After passing about .an hour and a half upon  
this spot, we thought it time to descend, once  
more, to the habitable regions of the earth; but  
when we had got about half way from the bot-  
tom of the mount to the baude, who should we  
meet but L....., whose head-ache had left her  
as the day advanced, and who, after coming so  
far, had determined, at all events, not to return,  
and leave the most important object upon our  
whole tour unseen: I turned back, of course,  
and went up a second time with her. It was  
now about § in the morning, and the sun had  
risen so high, as partly to disperse the vapours,  
which had straitened the view, at my first as-  
cent. The mountain now appeared familiar to  
me as an old acquaintance, and the temperature  
of the air upon it was so uncommonly mild, that  
we might have dispensed with putting on our  
cloaks. It has so happened that the three or four  
days we have been upon the mountains, have  
proved to be among the very warmest of the  
year; and, excepting the few minutes before sun-  
rise this morning, the cold has in no one instance  
been troublesome, in scarcely any perceptible de-  
gree to us; we had indeed taken the precaution  
te be very warmly clad, and as we were advised,  
have never been without thick cloaks, to put on,  
whenever the occasion should require.  
  
Sentiments of devotion, I have always found  
the first to take possession of the mind, on as-  
cending lofty mountains, At the summit of the  
Giant’s head, my first thought was turned to the  
Supreme Creator, who gave existence to all that  
immensity of objects, expanded before my view.  
The transition from this idea, to that of my own  
relation, as an immortal soul, with the Author of  
Nature, was natural and immediate ; from this to  
the recollection of my native country, my pa-  
rents and friends, there was but a single, and a  
sudden step. On returning to the hut, where we  
had lodged, I wrote the following lines in the  
ook :=——  
  
From lands, beyond the vast Atlantic tide,  
Celestial freedom’s most belov’d abode,  
Panting, I climb’d the mountain’s craggy side,  
And view’d the wond’rous works of Nature’s  
God.  
  
Where yonder summit, peering to the skies,  
Beholds the earth beneath it with disdain,  
O’er all the regions round I cast my eyes,  
And anxious sought my native home—in vain.

Upon taking our departure from the baude,

and stormed ina manner, that a fury might have  
taken lessons from her. Our guide afterwards  
told us, that the reason why we found her so ill-  
tempered, was, because her husband had yester-  
day given her a severe flogging, and she had not  
yet recovered from the ruffling of her disposi-|  
tion.—Simple! virtuous! happy patriarchs !  
  
At no considerable distance from this hut,  
are two lakes or ponds, the water of which is  
deep and clear, and which contain some fish; we  
visited one of them, as we returned to the place’  
at which we left our cart. This spot we reached  
at about eleven in the morning; and proceeding  
immediately thence, through the Warmbrunn,  
arrived again at Hirschberg, at three in the after-  
noon. :  
  
You have now an account, probably more cir-  
cumstantial than you would have wished, of our  
excursions upon the Giant mountains, which, al-  
though in point of elevation, they cannot stand a  
comparison with those of Switzerland, and much  
less with those of South-America, still yield an  
ample compensation of pleasure, for the toil and  
trouble of ascendingthem. There are travellers,  
who think to give themselves an air of courage  
and importance, by representing parts of this  
tour as dangerous; but in truth, with the use of  
common prudence and precaution, there is no  
more danger, than in walking the streets of any  
city. The roads have indeed been, within the  
last month, somewhat mended, upon the expecta-  
tion, that the queen, who, in the course of ten  
days, is expected at Warmbrunn, will be dispos-  
ed to make the tour of the mountains. They  
have been made less inconvenient, but there was  
really no danger to remove.  
  
There are two remarkable changes in the face  
of the country, as you ascend. From the bot-  
tom of the mountains, about half way up, the  
ground is covered with tall, majestic trees, chiefly  
pines and firs, which gradually dwindle in size  
and height, until, in the middle region, they can  
no longer be called trees, but shrink to a shrub  
of an extraordinary kind, which, I believe, is  
commonly called dwarf-pine. It goes here by  
the name of knee-wood, in allusion to the height,  
which it seldom exceeds. The stem is sometimes  
about the size of a man’s leg; and it spreads  
round its branches, something in the shape of  
  
THE PORT FOLIO. .  
  
a large lustre, so as tobe at least sixty feet in cir-  
  
cumference. This bush grows up as high as  
what is called the Aamm, or back of the whole  
range of mountains; and the boundaries between  
the two provinces, are shewn by a narrow lane,  
cut between these bushes all along the ridge.  
The region above this, consists entirely of the  
naked rock, without atrace of any kind of vege-  
tation.  
  
We have had repeated opportunity to observe  
the sentiments of national aversion and rivalry,  
between the neighbouring Bohemians and Sile-  
sians, At the Bohemian glass-works, one of the  
men who shewed us some of their best specimens  
of cut-glass, boastingly said to us, * You have  
seen nothing like this in Silesia.”” And upon our  
return, a glass-merchant at Warmbrunn shewed  
us a large wine-glass, with a landscape cut upon  
it, very beautifully executed, though done more  
than a century ago, ‘ You saw nothing like  
this at the glass-works in Bohemia,” said he.  
By the story I have related, concerning the old  
dispute respecting the source of the Elbe, you  
will perceive, that these neighbourly jealousies  
are of amore ancient date, than the period when  
the two provinces belonged to different and rival  
sovereigns.

The view from the Reisenkoppe, or the Giant’s Head, is an-  
other striking feature in the picture.  
  
‘ The darkness of the night had been gradually dispersing, and the  
borders of the horizon at the east gradually reddening from the  
moment when we left the baude, so that I was apprehensive the  
queen of day, as Zéllner on a similar occasion calls the sun, would  
shew his glowing face before we should reach the summit, and to  
avoid this disappointment doubled the usual pace of ascent, and in  
another quarter of an hour stood at the door of the chapel on the top  
of the mountain. About ten minutes after, the great luminary rose  
in all his glory, from the lower cloud which bordered the horizon ; for  
although the weather was remarkably fine for this region, the sky was  
not perfectly clear, and a murky vapour hung upon the atmosphere,  
which intercepted a part of the immense extent of territory which  
would otherwise have been within the compass of our vision. I had  
heard so much of the apparent magnitude of the sun’s disk when seen  
rising from this spot, that when I came to view it I found it less  
striking than I imagined ; it appears about the size of a large coach-  
wheel; but the same effect may at any time be produced by looking  
at it through a telescope.  
  
‘ The prospect from this spot is of course more extensive than from  
any other point upon these mountains; and its grandeur is augmented  
by the circumstance that the eye can range freely, bounded only by  
the horizon on every side. ‘The spectator has but to turn on his heel,  
and all Silesia, all Saxony, and aH Bohemia, pass in an instant before  
his view ; it is therefore truly sublime; but as it has the defect usually  
attendant upon sublimity, of being indistinct, and in some sort chaotic,  
the lover of beautiful objects must content himself with a smaller  
elevation. A painter at Hirschberg, by the name of Reinhardt, who  
is employed by the Academy of Sciences at Berlin to paint views of  
the most remarkable spots in this province, observed to me, that from  
the highest mountains there was nothing picturesque, nothing that he  
could employ as a subject for any one of his paintings.—-When on the  
Schneekoppe, I felt the force of his remark; for when the eye  
embraces at once such an extent of objects, it perceives only  
masses ; whereas, all the pleasure that painting can afford is by the  
accurate representation of details. Z  
  
‘ The proper Giant’s Head is of a conical form, and the surface of  
the summit is not more, I think, than an hundred yards in diameter ;

its perpendicular elevation is about six hundred feet, and the _ by  
which it is ascended forms nearly a regular angle of about 45 degrees :  
the ascent would indeed be too steep to be practicable, but that when  
the chapel on the top was built, in the year 1668, a flight of stone  
steps was made to assist the traveller in mounting to it, of which a  
sufficient part remains to give no small assistance. The mountain  
itself appears to be a solid block of granite, upon which there is no  
appearance of vegetation, unless a kind of red moss, resembling rust  
upon iron, which grows on the loose stones that cover it on every side,  
may be so called: these loose stones, part of which are of granite and  
part of a species of white flint, are in such abundance that they  
wholly conceal the side of the mountain itself. On one side of the  
path as you approach the top, a precipice of about 1500 feet opens,  
by the side of which you continue to mount; it ends at the bottom  
in a narrow vale of perhaps a mile in extent, along the course of which  
are scattered a number of peasants’ huts. Here too it looks as if the  
body of the mountain had been riven at a single stroke, and the rocks  
which stand on either side correspond in such a manner as to resemble  
the teeth of a saw. Opposite the summit, to the westward, is a  
mountain somewhat lower, called the Little Koppe, from the foot  
of which is a sloping grass-plot that goes by the name of Riibenzahl’s  
pleasure-garden ; other remarkable spots within the view are called  
his meadow, his pulpit, hisgrounds, &amp;c.: the whole neighbourhood  
is full of hisname,’ Pp. 107

Sentiments of devotion I have always found  
the first to take possession of the mind, on ascend-  
ing lofty mountains. At the summit of the  
mountain my first thought was turned to the Su-  
preme Creator, who gave existence to all that  
immensity of objects expanded before my view.  
The transition from this idea to that of my own  
relation, as an immortal soul, with the Author of  
nature, was natural and immediate, from this to  
the recollection of my native country, my parents  
and friends, there was but a single and sudden  
step. On returning to the hut where we had  
lodged, I wrote the following lines in my book:  
  
From lands beyond the vast Atlantic tide,  
  
Celestial freedom’s most beloved abode,  
  
Panting I climbed the mountain&#x27;s craggy side,  
  
And viewed the wondrous works of nature&#x27;s God.
