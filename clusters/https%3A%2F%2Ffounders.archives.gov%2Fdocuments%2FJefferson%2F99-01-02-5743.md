under the date of it’s receipt which was Nov. 25. but lest the Attorney General should not have left those papers with  
you I this day write to him to forward this one by post, an uncertainty whether he is at Philadelphia, Wilmington or  
Newcastle may produce delay in his recieving my letter, of which it is proper you should be apprised. but as I do not  
recollect the whole contents of that letter, I must beg leave to devolve on you the exercise of that discretion which it  
would be my right &amp; duty to exercise, by witholding the communication of any parts of the letter which are not directly  
material for the purposes of justice.  
With this application, which is specific, a prompt compliance is practicable. but when the request goes to  
‘copies of the orders issued in relation to Colo. Burr to the officers at Orleans, Natchez Etc by the Secretaries  
of the War &amp; Navy departments’, it seems to cover a correspondence of many months with such a variety of officers civil  
&amp; military all over the US. as would amount to the laying open the whole executive books. I have desired the Secretary  
at War to examine his official communications, and on a view of these we may be able to judge what can &amp;  ought to be  
done towards a compliance with the request. if the defendant alleges that there was any particular order which as a  
cause, produced any particular act on his part, then he must know what this order was, can specify it, and a prompt answer  
can be given. if the object had been specified we might then have had some guide for our conjectures as to what part of  
the Executive records might be useful to him. but, with a perfect willingness to do what is right, we are without the  
indications which may enable us to do it. if the researches of the Secretary at War should produce any thing proper for  
communication &amp; pertinent to any point we can concieve in the defence before the court, it shall be forwarded to you. I  
salute you with esteem &amp; respect.
