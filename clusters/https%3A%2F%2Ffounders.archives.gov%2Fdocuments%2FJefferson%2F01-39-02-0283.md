“Deau Sir: I dropped you aline on the 10th,  
informing you of a nomination I had made of  
you to the Senate, and yesterday I enclosed you  
tbeir approbation, not having then time to write.  
The agitation of the public mind on occasion  
of the late suspension of our right of deposite  
at New-Orleans, is extreme. This in the West­  
ern Country is natural,and grounded on opera*

j are now circulating through the whole of that

pic. The measures which we have been pur­  
&#x27; suing, being invisible, do not satisfy their minds;  
something sensible, therefore, has become ne­  
cessary, and .indeed eur object of purchasing  
Xew-Orleans and the Floridas, is a measure  
! likely to assume so many shapes, that no in­  
| struc»ions could be squared to fit them. It was  
i essential then to send a Minister Extraerdioaiy

i tionary power, first however, well impressed  
with all our views, and therefore qualified to  
meet and modify to these every form of propo­  
sition which could come from the other party.  
T£is could be done only in frequent and full  
oral communication. Having determined on  
this, there could not be two opinions as to the  
person. You possessed the unlimited confi­  
dence of the administration, and of the West­

other man can be found who does this All  
eyes are now fixed on you; and were you to  
decline, the chagrin would be great, and would  
shake under your feet the high ground on which  
you stand with the public. Indeed I know no­  
thing which would produce such a shock: for  
on the event of this mission, depends the future  
destinies of this Republic. If we cannot by a  
purchase of the country, ensure to ourselves a  
course of perpetual peace and friendship with  
all nations, then, as war cannot be far distant,  
it behoves us immediately to be preparing for  
that course, without however hastening it, and  
it may be necessary, (on your failure on the con­  
tinent) to cross the channel We shall get en­  
tangled in European politics, and figuring more,  
be much less happy and prosperous. This ran  
only bi- prevented by a successful issue to your  
present mission. 1 am sensible, after the mea­  
sures you have taken for getting into a differ­

crifice on your part, and presents from the sea­

wrote to Mr. Monroe on his nomination and the policy of the  
Government regarding the subject of purchasing New Orleans  
as follows: “The agitation of the public mind on occasion of  
the late suspension of our right of deposit at New Orleans is  
extreme. In the Western country it is natural, and grounded  
on honest motives. In the seaports it proceeds from a desire  
for war, which increases the mercantile lottery; in the  
Federalists generally, and especially those of Congress, the

object is to force us into war, if possible, in order to derange  
our finances, or, if this cannot be done, to attach the Western  
country to them as their best friends, and thus get again into  
power. Remonstrances, memorials, etc., are now circulating  
through the whole of the Western country, and signed by the  
body of the people. The measures we have been pursuing,  
being invisible, do not satisfy their minds. Something  
sensible, therefore, has become necessary; and indeed our  
object of purchasing New Orleans and the Floridas is a  
measure liable to assume so many shapes that no instructions  
could be squared to fitthem. It was essential, then, to send a  
Minister Extraordinary, to be joined with the ordinary one,  
with discretionary powers. ... . All eyes, all hopes, are now  
fixed on you; and were you to decline, the chagrin would be  
universal, and would shake under your feet the high ground  
on which you stand with the public. Indeed, I know nothing  
which would produce such a shock. For on the event of this  
mission depend the future destinies of this republic.&quot; The  
entire correspondence of Mr. Jefferson shows that he regarded  
the acquisition of Louisiana as necessary to the United States  
in order to preserve peace at home and friendship abroad
