hrough the Post offices they should become known to all the world) for, in truth, I have nothing to conceal on that subject. It appears to me, then, little short of a miracle, that the Delegates from so many different States (which States you know are also different from each other in their manners, circumstances and prejudieces) should unite in forming a system of national Government, so little liable to well founded objections. Nor am I yet such an enthusiastic, partial or undiscriminating admirer of it, as not to prerceive it is tinctured with some real (though not radical) defects. The limits of a letter would not suffer me to go fully into an examination of them; nor would the discussion be entertaining or profitable, I therefore forbear to touch upon it. With regard to the two great points (the pivots on which the whole machine must move) my Creed is simply:  
1st That the general Government is not invested with more Powers than are indispensably necessary to perform [the] functions  
  
of a good Government; and, consequently, that no objection ought to be made against the quantity of Power delegated to it.  
2ly That these Powers (as the appointment of all Rulers will forever arise from, and, at short stated intervals, recur to the free suffrage of the People) are so distributed among the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches, into which the general Government is arranged, that it can never be in danger of degenerating into a monarcchy, an Oligarchy, an Aristocracy, or any other despotic or oppressive form; so long as there shall remain any virtue in the body of the People.  
I would not be understood my dear Marquis to speak of consequences which may be produced, in the revolution of ages, by corruption of morals, profligacy of manners, and listlessness for the preservation of the natural and unalienable rights of mankind; nor of the successful usurpations that may be established at such an unpropitious Juncture, upon the ruins of liberty, however providently guarded and secured, as these are contingencies against which no human prudence can iffectually provide. It will at least be a recommendation to the proposed Constitution that it is provided with more checks and barriers against the introduction of Tyranny, &amp; those of a nature less liable to be surmounted, than any Government hitherto instituted among mortals, hath possessed. we are not to expect perfection in this world: but mankind, in modern times, have apparently made some progress in the science of Government. Should that which is now offered to the People of America, be found an experiment less perfect than it can be made—a Constitutional door is left open for its amelioration.

 I will only add, as a farther opinion founded on the maturest deliberation, that there is no alternative—no hope of alteration—no intermediate resting place—between the adoption of this and a recurrence to an unqualified state of Anarchy, with all its deplorable consequences.  
Since I had the pleasure of writing to you last, no material alteration in the political State of affairs has taken place to change the prospect of the Constitution’s being adopted by nine States or more. Pennsylvania, Delaware, Jersey and Connecticut have already done it. It is also said Georgia has aceeded. Massachusetts

d you, is now in Convention.  
A spirit of emigration to the western Country is very predominant. Congress have sold, in the year past, a pretty large quantity of lands on the Ohio, for public Securities, and thereby diminished the domestic debt considerably. Many of your military acquaintances such as the Generals Parsons, Varnum and Putnam, the Colos. Tupper[,] Sprout and Sherman, with many more, propose settling there. From such beginnings much may be expected.  
The storm of war between England and your Nation, it seems, is dissipated. I hope and trust the political affairs in France are taking a favorable turn.

It may be well, in this investigation, for  
to turn to the great charts of liberty, and  
what are the safeguards which in these constitu  
tions are thrown around the citizen, to protect  
him in his inalienable rights. 1  
The Constitution of the United States,  
originally agreed upon in the convention which  
formed, and as ratined by the States, was meant  
to protect fully and unmistakably the rights  
of the citizen; and to prevent the exercise of  
arbitrary power upon the part of the Exeoutive.  
Washington, in writing to Lafayette, says of  
Constitution as submitted to the States:   
will at least be a recommendation to the proposed  
Constitution, that it provides with more checks  
and barriers against the introduction of tyran­  
ny, and those of a nature less likely to be sur­  
mounted, than any Government heretofore

months before he had written to Lafayette: “A spirit of emigration to  
the Western country is very predominant. Congress has sold in the year

thereby diminished the public debt considerably. Many of your military

The colony was referred to in the correspondence of many public men

Minister of Foreign Affairs in France. It was regarded as an event of
