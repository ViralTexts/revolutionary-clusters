River-Farm  
Crops for, &amp; operations thereon, for the year 1800  
Field No. 1—Is now partly in Wheat. Part thereof is to be sown with Oats. another part may be sown with Pease, broadcast. Part is in meadow, and will remain so. and the most broken, washed, &amp; indifferent part, is to remain uncultivated; but to be harrowed &amp; smoothed in the Spring, and the worst parts thereof (if practicable) to be covered with litter, straw, weeds or any kind of vegitable Rubbish to prevent them from running into gullies.  
No. 2—One fourth is to be in Corn, and to be sown with wheat; another fourth is to be in Buckwheat and Pease, half of it in the one, and half of it in the other, sown in April; to be plowed in as a green dressing; and by actual experiment, to ascertain which is best. The whole of this fourth is to be sown with Wheat also; another fourth part is to be naked fallow for wheat; and the other, and last quarter, to be appropriated for Pumpkins, Simlins, Turnips[,] Yateman Pease (in hills), and such other things of this kind as may be required—and to be sown likewise with Rye after they are taken off, for Seed.  
No. 3—Is now in wheat, to be harvested in the year 1800; the stubble of which, immediately after Harvest, is to be plowed in and sown thin with Rye; and such parts thereof as are low, or produces a luxurient growth of grain, is to have grass-seeds sprinkled over it. The whole for Sheep to run on, in the day, (but housed at night) during the winter and spring months. If it should be found expedient, part thereof in the spring might be reserved, for the purpose of Seed.  
No. 4—Will be in Corn, and is to be sown in the Autumn of that year with Wheat, to be harvested in 1801—and to be treated in all respects as has been directed for No. 3, the preceeding year. It is to be manured, as much as the means will permit, with such aids as can be procured during the present Winter, and ensuing Spring.  
Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8—Are to remain as they are, but nothing suffered  
  
to run upon them; as ground will be allotted for the sole purpose of Pasturage, and invariably used as such.  
Clover-Lots  
No. 1—Counting from the Spring branch, is to be planted in Potatoes.  
No. 2—That part thereof which is now in Turnips, is to be sown with Oats &amp; clover; the other part, being now in clover, is to remain so until it comes into Potatoes, by rotation.  
No. 3—Is also in Clover at present, and is to remain so, as just mentioned, for No. 3.  
No. 4—Is partly in Clover, and partly in Timothy, &amp; so to be, until its turn for Potatoes.  
The rotation for these Lots  
Invariably is to be—1st Potatoes, highly manured; 2d Oats, &amp; clover sown therewith; 3d Clover; 4th Clover. Then to begin again with Potatoes, and proceed as before. The present Clover lots must be Plastered.

 will ferment, putrify, &amp; ameliorate the Soil, should be plowed in, in Autumn, and at such times in Winter, as can be done while the ground is dry, and in condition for it.  
Pasture-Grounds  
The large lot adjoining the Negro houses and Orchd, is to have Oats sown on the Potatoe and Pumpkin ground; with which, and on the Rye also, in that lot and on the Mellon part, orchard-grass seeds are to be sown; and thereafter to be kept as a standing calf pasture; and for Ewes (which may require extra: care) at yeaning, or after they have yeaned.  
The other large lot, North East of the Barnlan⟨e⟩ is to be appropriated, always, as a Pasture for the Milch Cows; and probably working Oxen, during the Summer Season.  
The Woodland, and the old field, commonly called Johnstons, are designed for Common Pasture—and to be so applied, always. to which, if it should be found inadequate to the Stock of the Farm, Field No. 8 and the Woodland therein, may be added.  
Meadows  
Those already established, and in train, must continue; and the next to be added to them, is the Arm of the Creek which runs up to the Spring house, &amp; forks; both prongs of which must be  
  
  
  
  
grubbed, and wrought upon at every convenient moment when the weather will permit, down to the line of the Ditch which encloses the lots for clover &amp;ca.  
And as the fields come into cultivation—or, as labour can be spared from other work, and circumstances will permit, the heads of all the Inlets in them must be reclaimed, and laid to grass—whether they be large, or small; &amp; inasmuch as nothing will run on or can tresspass upon, or injure the Grass; no fencing being req[uire]d.  
Mud—for—Compost  
The season is now too far advanced, and too cold to be engaged in a work that will expose the hands to wet: but, it is of such essential importance that it should be set about seriously, and with spirit next year, for the Summers Sun, &amp; Winters frost to prepare it for the Corn, &amp; other Crops of 1801, that all the hands of the Farm, not indispensably engaged in the Crops, should, so soon as Corn planting is compleated in the spring, be uninterruptedly employed in raising Mud from the Pocosons, &amp; even from the bed of the Creek, into the Scow; and the Carts, so soon as the Manure for the Corn &amp; Potatoes in 1800 is carried out is to be incessantly drawing it to compost heaps in the field, which is to be manured by it. What number of hands can be set apart for this all important work, remains to be considered, and decided upon.  
Penning Cattle—&amp; folding Sheep.  
On the fields intended for Wheat, from the first of May, when the former should be turned out to Pasture, until the first of November, when they ought to be Housed, must be practiced invariably: and to do it with regularity &amp; propriety, the Pen for the first, &amp; the fold for the latter, should be proportioned to the number of each kind of Stock; and both these to as much ground as they will manure sufficiently, in the space of a Week, for Wheat; beyond which they are not to remain in a place, except on the poorest spots; and even these had better be aided by litter or something else than to depart from an established rule of removing the Pens on a certain day in every week: For in this, as in everything else, system is essential to carry on business well, &amp; with ease.  
Feeding  
The work horses and Mules are always to be in their Stalls—&amp; well littered &amp; cleaned when they are out of Harness; and they are to be plenteously fed with cut straw, and as much chopped Grain, Meal, or Bran, with a little salt mixed therewith, as will keep them  
  
always in good condition for work; seeing also that they are watered, as regularly as they are fed. this is their winter feed: for Spring, Summer and Autumn, it is expected that Soiling of them on green food—first with Rye, then with Lucern, and next with Clover, with very little grain, will enable them to perform their Work.  
The Oxen, and other horned Cattle, are to be housed from the first of November, until the first of May; and to be fed as well as the means on the Farm will admit. The first (Oxen) must always be kept in good condition. Housed in the Stalls designed for them. and the Cows (so many of them as can find places) on the opposite side—The rest, with the other Cattle, must be in the newly erected Sheds; and the whole carefully Watered every day. The Ice, in frosen weather, being broken, so as to admit them to clean Water.  
With respect to the Sheep, they must receive the best protection that can be given them this Winter; against the next, I hope they will be better provided for.  
And with regard to the Hogs, the plan must be to raise a given number of good ones, instead of an indiscriminate number of indifferent ones—half of which die, or are stolen before the period arrives for putting them up as porkers. To accomplish this, a sufficient number of the best Sows should be appropriated to the purpose; and so many pigs raised from them as will ensure the quantity of Pork the Farm ought to furnish. Whether it will be most advisable to restrain these hogs from running at large or not, can be decided with more precision after the result of those now in close pens are better known. The exact quantity of Corn used by those which are now in Pens should be ascertained, and regularly reported, in order to learn the result.  
Stables—and—Farm Pens  
These ought to be kept well littered, and the Stalls clean; as well for the comfort of the Creatures that are contained in them, as for the purpose of manure; but as straw canot be afforded for this purpose, Leaves, &amp; such spoiled Straw or weeds as will not do for food, must serve for the Stables; and the first, that is leaves and Corn Stalks, is all that can be applied to the Pens. To do this work effectually, let the Corn stalks be cut down by a few careful people with sharp hoes, so low as never to be in the way of Scythes at harvest; and whenever the Wheat will admit Carts to run on it without injury, to bring them off, &amp; stack them near the Farm Pens. In like  
  
manner let the People, with their blankets go every evening, or as often as occasion may require, to the nearest wood and fill them with leaves for the purposes abovementioned; bottoming the beds with Corn Stalks, and covering them thick with leaves. A measure of this sort will be—if strictly attended to, and punctually performed, of great utility in every point of view. It will save food, Make the Cattle lay warm and comfortable, and produce much manure. The Hogs also in pens must be well bedded in leaves.  
Fencing  
As stock of no kind, according to this plan, will be suffered to run on the arable fields, or Clover lots (except Sheep, in the day, on the Rye field, as has been mentioned before) partition fences between the fields until they can be raised of Quicks, may be dispens’d with—But it is of great importance that all the exterior or outer fences, should be substantially good; and those also wch divide the Common, or Woodland Pasture, from the fields and Clover Lots are to be very respectable.  
To accomplish this desirable object in as short a time as possible, and with the smallest expence of timber—the Post &amp; Rail fence which runs from the Negro quarters or rather from the corner of the lot enclosing them up to the division between fields No. 7 &amp; No. 8 may be placed on the Bank (which must be raised higher) that runs from thence (where it was burnt) to the Creek. In like manner the fence from the gate which opens into No. 2, quite down to the River, along the Cedar, hedge Row—as also those Rails which are between No. 1 &amp; 2 and between No. 2 &amp; 3 may all be taken away and applied to the outer fences, &amp; the fences of the lanes from the Barn into the Woodland Pasture, and from the former (the Barn) into No. 5; for the fences of all these lanes must be good, as the Stock must have a free and uninterrupted passage along them, at all times, from the Barnyard to the Woodland Pasture.  
One of the gates near the Fodder house, may be moved up to the range of the lane, by the gate, near that which leads into field No. 2; and the other may be placed at the other end of the lane, by the Negro quarters: and so long as Mr Mason’s old field remains uninclosed the outer gate into Field No. 8 wd stand better in the Fence which runs from the division between fields No. 7 &amp; 8 to the Creek than where it now is.  
All the fen[cin]g from the last mentioned place, (between me  
  
&amp; Mr Mason) until it joins Mr Lears Farm, and thence with the line between him &amp; me, until it comes to the River, will require to be substantially good; at its termination on the river, dependance must be placed in a Water fence—for, if made of common Rails, they would be carried off by boatmen for fire-wood. The fences seperating fields No. 1 and No. 8 from the woodland pasture must also be made good, to prevent depredations on the fields by my own stock.  
Crops &amp;ca—for—1801  
No. 5—Is to be in Corn, and to be invariable in that article. It is to be planted (if drills are thought to be ineligable until the ground is much improved) in Rows 6 feet by 4 or 7 feet by 3½; the wide part open to the South. These hills are to be manured as highly as the means will admit; and the Corn planted every year in the middle of the Rows of the preceeding year; by doing which, and mixing the Manure and Earth by the Plow &amp; other workings, the whole in time, will be enriched.  
The washed and gullied parts of this field should be levelled, &amp; as much improved as possible—or left uncultivated. Although it is more broken than some of the other fields, it has its advantages. 1st it has several Inlets extending into it with easy assents therefrom—2d it is convenient to the Mud in the bed of the Creek whensoever (by means of the Scow) resort is had thereto—and good landing places—and thirdly, it is as near to the Barn as any other (when a bridge and causeway is made over the Spring branch.)—To these may be added, that it is more remote from Squirrels than any other.  
No. 6 &amp; 7—Or such part thereof as is not so much washed &amp; gullied as to render plowing ineligable, are to be fallowed for wheat—One of which, if both cannot, is to have the stubble plowed in and sown with Rye; and the low, &amp; strong parts to have Timothy or Orchard grass-seeds—perhaps both, in different places, sprinkled over them for the purpose of raising Seed. On the Rye pasture the Sheep are to be fed in winter &amp; Spring, and treated in all respects as directed in the case of No. 3 in 1800.  
In the years 1802, 1803, &amp; so on  
The Corn ground, remaining the same, two fields in following numbers, will be fallowed for Wheat; and treated in all respects as mentioned above. And if Pumpkins—Simlins[—]Turnips—Pease—and such like growths are found beneficial to the land, or  
  
useful and profitable for Stock, ground may readily be found for them.  
These are the great out lines of a Plan, and the operations of it, for the next year, and for years to come, for River Farm. The necessary arrangements, and all the preparatory measures for carrying it into effect, ought to be adopted without delay, and invariably pursued. Smaller matters may, and undoubtedly will, occur occasionally; but none, it is presumed, that can militate against it materially.  
To carry it into effect advantageously, it becomes the indispensable duty of him who is employed to overlook &amp; conduct the operations, to take a prospective, and comprehensive view of the whole business which is laid before him, that the several parts thereof may be so ordered and arranged, as that one sort of work may follow another sort in proper Succession, and without loss of labour, or of time; for nothing is a greater waste of the latter, and consequently of the former (time producing labour, and labour money—) than shifting from one thing to another before it is finished; as if chance, or the impulse of the moment, not judgm[en]t and foresight, directed the measure. It will be acknowledged that weather, and other circumstances may, at times, interrupt a regular course of proceedings; but if a plan is well digested beforehand, they cannot interfere long, with a man who is acquainted with the nature of the business, and the Crops he is to attend to.  
Every attentive, and discerning person, who has the whole business of the year laid before him, and is acquainted with the nature of the work, can be at no loss to lay it out to advantage. He will know that there are many things wch can be accomplished in winter as well as in summer—others, that spring, summer and Autumn only are fit for. In a word, to use the Wiseman’s saying “that there is a time, and a season for all things” and that, unless they are embraced, nothing will thrive; or go on smoothly. There are many sorts of Indoors work which can be executed in Hail, rain or Snow, as well as in sunshine; and if they are set about in fair weather (unless there be a necessity for it) there will be nothing to do in foul weather; the people therefore must be idle. The man of prudence &amp; foresight, will always keep these things in view, and order his work accordingly; so as to suffer no waste of time, or idleness. The same observations apply with equal force to frozen  
  
ground; and grounds too wet to work in, or if worked, will be injured thereby. These observations might be spun to a greater length, but they are sufficient to produce reflexion, and reflection with Industry, and proper attention, will produce the end that is to be wished.  
There is one thing however I cannot forbear to add—and in strong terms; it is, that whenever I order a thing to be done, it must be done; or a reason given at the time, or as soon as the impracticability is discovered, why it cannot; which will produce a countermand, or change. But it is not for the person receiving the order, to suspend or dispense with its execution; and after it has been supposed to have gone into effect, for me to be told that nothing has been done in it; that it will be done; or that it could not be done; either of these is unpleasant, and disagreeable to me having been accustomed all my life to more regularity, and punctuality, and know that nothing but System &amp; method is required to accomplish all reasonable requests.

Although I may find myself mistaken, I am inclined to put the other prong of this swamp, running through No. 6 and heading in No. 7 into meadow and have, for this reason, directed already, the mode to be pursued for accomplishing it. Next to this, let as much of the Inlet in No. 2 as can be laid dry enough for Corn, be planted therewith, in order to eradicate the wild growth; when this is effected, lay it to grass.

Crops for the River Farm, and Operations thereon, for the  
Year 1800.  
  
Firip No. 1,—Is now partly in wheat; part is to be sown  
with oats ; another part may be sown with pease, broad cast ;  
part is in meadow, and will remain so; the most broken,  
washed, and indifferent part is to remain uncultivated, but to  
be harrowed and smoothed in the spring, and the worst por-  
tions, (if practicable) to be covered with litter, straw, weeds, or  
any kind of vegetable rubbish, to prevent them from running  
into gullies.  
  
No. 2. — One fourth is to be in corn, and to be sown with  
wheat; another fourth in buckwheat and pease, half of it in  
the one, and half in the other, sown in April, to be ploughed  
in as a green dressing, and by actual experiment to ascertain  
which is best. The whole of this fourth is to be sown with  
wheat also; another fourth part is to be naked fallow for  
wheat ; and the other and last quarter to be appropriated for  
pumpkins, cymlins, turnips, Yateman pease (in hills), and such  
other things of this kind as may be required; and to be sown  
likewise with rye, after they are taken off, for seed.  
  
No. 3,— Is new in wheat, to be harvested in the year 1800;  
the stubble of which, immediately after harvest, is to be plough-  
ed in and sown thin with rye; and such parts thereof as are  
low, or produce a luxuriant growth of grain, are to have grass-  
seeds sprinkled over them. ‘The whole for sheep to run on in  
the day (but housed at night) during the winter and spring  
months. If it should be found expedient, part thereof in the  
spring might be reserved for the purpose of seed.  
  
No. 4,— Will be in corn, and is to be sown in the autumn  
of that year with wheat, to be harvested in 1801; and to be  
treated in all respects as has been directed for No. 3, the pre-  
ceding year. It is to be manured as much as the means will  
permit, with such aids as can be procured during the present  
winter and ensuing spring.  
  
Nos. 5, 6, 7, &amp; 8, — Are to remain as they are, but nothing  
suffered to run upon them; as ground will be allotted for the  
sole purpose of pasturage, and invariably used as such.

Clover Lots.  
  
No. 1, — Counting from the Spring Branch is to be planted  
in potatoes.  
  
No. 2,— That part thereof which is now in turnips is to be  
sown with oats and clover; the other part, being now in clover,  
is to remain so until it comes into potatoes, by rotation.  
  
No. 3, — Is also in clover at present, and is to remain so, as  
just mentioned, for No. 2.  
  
No. 4,—Is partly in clover and partly in timothy, and so to  
be, until its turn for potatoes.  
  
The rotation for these lots invariably is to be, 1. Potatoes,  
highly manured; 2. Oats, and clover sown therewith ; 3. Clo-  
ver; 4. Clover. Then to begin again with potatoes, and pro-  
ceed as before. The present clover lots must be plastered.  
  
All green sward, rough ground, or that which is heavily  
covered with weeds, bottle brush grass, and such things as  
being turned in will ferment, putrefy, and meliorate the soil,  
should in autumn be ploughed in, and at such times in win-  
ter as can be done while the ground is dry, and in condition  
for it.  
  
Pasture Grounds.  
  
The large lot adjoining the Negro houses and orchard, is to  
have oats sown on the potatoe and pumpkin ground; with  
which, and on the rye also in that lot, and on the melon part,  
orchard-grass seeds are to be sown; and thereafter to be kept  
as a standing calf pasture, and for ewes (which may require  
extra care) at yeaning, or after they have yeaned.  
  
The other large lot, northeast of the Barn lane, is to be  
appropriated always as a pasture for the milch cows; and  
probably working oxen during the summer season.  
  
The woodland, and the’ old field commonly called Johnston’s,  
are designed for common pasture, and to be so applied always.  
To which, if it should be found inadequate to the stock of the  
farm, field No. 8, and the woodland therein, may be added.  
  
Meadows.  
  
Those already established and in train must continue, and  
the next to be added to them is the arms of the creek, which  
runs up to the spring-house, and forks, both prongs of which  
must be grubbed up, and wrought upon at every convenient  
moment when the weather will permit, down to the line of the  
ditch, which encloses the lots for clover, &amp;c.

And as the fields come into cultivation, or as labor can be  
spared from other work, and circumstances will permit, the  
heads of all the inlets in them must be reclaimed, and laid to  
grass, whether they be large or small, forasmuch as nothing  
will run on, or can trespass upon, or injure the grass; no  
fencing being required.  
  
Mud for Compost.  
  
The season is now too far advanced, and too cold to be  
engaged in a work, that will expose the hands to wet; but it  
is of such essential importance, that it should be set about  
seriously and with spirit next year, for the summer’s sun and  
the winter’s frost to prepare it for the corn and other crops of  
1801, that all the hands of the farm, not indispensably engaged  
in the crops, should, so soon as corn-planting is completed in  
the spring, be uninterruptedly employed in raising mud from  
the Pocosons, and from the bed of the creek, into the scow;  
and the carts, so soon as the manure for the corn and potatoes  
in 1800 is carried out, are to be incessantly drawing it to the  
compost heaps in the fields, which are to be manured by it.  
What number of hands can be set apart for this all-important  
work, remains to be considered and decided upon.  
  
Penning Cattle and folding Sheep  
  
On the fields intended for wheat, from the first of May, when  
the former should be turned out to pasture, until the first of  
November, when they ought to be housed, must be practised  
invariably; and to do it with regularity and propriety, the pen  
for the former, and the fold for the latter, should be propor-  
tioned to the number of each kind of Stock; and both these  
to as much ground as they will manure sufficiently in the space  
of a week for wheat, beyond which they are not to remain in  
a place, except on the poorest spots; and even these had better  
be aided by litter or something else, than to depart from an  
established rule, of removing the pens on a certain day in every  
week. For in this, as in everything else, system is essential to  
carry on business well, and with ease.  
  
Feeding.

as will keep them always in good condition for work; seeing,  
also, that they are watered as regularly as they are fed; this  
is their winter feed. For spring, summer, and autumn, it is  
expected, that soiling them on green food, first with rye, then  
with lucern, and next with clover, with very little grain, will  
enable them to perform their work.  
  
The oxen, and other horned cattle, are to be housed from  
the first of November until the first of May; and to be fed as  
well as the means on the farm will admit. The first (oxen)  
must always be kept in good condition ; housed in the stalls  
designed for them; and the cows (so many of them as can find  
places) on the opposite side. The rest, with the other cattle,  
must be in the newly erected sheds; and the whole carefully  
watered every day; the ice, in frozen weather, being broken,  
so as to admit them to clean water.  
  
With respect to the sheep, they must receive the best pro-  
tection that can be given them this winter; against the next,  
I hope they will be better provided for.  
  
And with regard to the hogs, the plan must be, to raise a  
given number of good ones, instead of an indiscriminate num-  
ber of indifferent ones, half of which die or are stolen before  
the period arrives for putting them up as porkers. To ac-  
complish this, a sufficient number of the best sows should be  
appropriated to the purpose; and so many pigs raised from  
them as will insure the quantity of pork, which the farm ought  
to furnish.  
  
Whether it will be most advisable to restrain these hogs from  
running at large or not, can be decided with more precision  
after the result of those now in close pens is better known.  
  
The exact quantity of corn used by those, which are now in  
pens, should be ascertained and regularly reported, in order to  
learn the result.  
  
Stabies and Farm Pens.  
  
These ought to be kept well littered, and the stalls clean ;.  
as well for the comfort of the creatures that are contained in  
them, as for the purpose of manure; but as straw cannot be  
afforded for this purpose, Jeaves and such spoiled straw or  
weeds as will not do for fuod, must serve for the stables; and  
the first, that is, leaves and corn-stalks, is all that can be ap-  
plied to the pens. To do this work effectually, let the corn-  
stalks be cut down by a few careful people with sharp hoes, so  
low as never to be in the way of scythes at harvest ; and when-  
ever the wheat will admit carts to run on it without injury, let  
them be brought off and stacked near the farm pens. In like

manner let the people, with their blankets, go every evening,  
or as often as occasion may require, to the nearest wood, and  
fill thous with leaves fur the purposes above mentioned ; bot-  
toming the beds with corn-stalks, and covering them thick with  
leaves. A measure of this sort will be, if strictly attended to,  
and punctually performed, of great utility in every point of  
view. It will save food, make the cattle lie warm and com-  
fortable, and produce much manure, The hogs also in pens  
must be well bedded in leaves.  
  
Fencing.  
  
As stock of no kind, according to this plan, will be suf  
fered to run on the arable fields or clover lots (except sheep  
in the day on the rye fields, as has been mentioned before),  
partition fences between the fields, until they can be raised of  
quicks, may be dispensed with. But it is of great importance,  
that all the exterior or outer fences should be substantially  
good ; and those also which divide the common, or woodland  
pasture, from the fields and clover lots, are to be very respect-  
able.  
  
To accomplish this desirable object in as short a time as  
possible, and with the smallest expense of timber, the post and  
rail fence which runs from the Negro quarters, or rather from  
the corner of the lot enclosing them, up to the division be-  
tween fields Nos. 7 and 8, may be placed on the bank (which  
must be raised higher) running to the creek. In like manner,  
the fence from the gate, which opens into No. 2, quite down  
to the river, along the Cedar Hed: ze Row, as also those rails  
which are between Nos. I and 2, and between Nos. 2 and 3,  
may all be taken away, and applied to the outer fences, and  
the fences of the lanes from the barn into the woodland pas-  
ture, and from the former (the barn) into No. 5; for the fences  
of all these Janes must be good, as the stock must have a free  
and uninterrupted passage along them, at all times, from the  
barn-yard to the woodland pasture.  
  
All the fencing from the last mentioned place (between me  
and Mr. Mason), until it joins Mr. Lear’s farm, and thence with  
the line between him and me, until it comes to the river, will  
require to be substantially good; at its termination on the  
river, dependence must be placed in a water fence; for if made  
of common rails, they would be carried off by boatmen for  
fire-wood. The fences separating fields Nos. 1 and 8 from the  
woodland pasture must also be made good, to prevent depreda-  
tions on the fields by my own stock.

Crops &amp;c. for 1801.  
  
No. 5, is to be in corn, and to be invariably in that arti-  
cle. It is to be planted (if drills are thought to be ineligible  
until the ground is much improved) in rows, 6 feet by 4, or  
7 feet by 34, the wide part open to the south. These hills are  
to be manured as highly as the means will admit; and the  
corn planted every year in the middle of the rows of the pre-  
ceding year; by doing which, and mixing the manure and  
earth by the plough and other workings, the whole in time will  
be enriched.  
  
The washed and gullied parts of this field should be levelled,  
and as much improved as possible, or left uncultivated. Al-  
though it is more broken than some of the other fields, it has  
its advantages. Ist, It has several inlets extending into it,  
with easy ascents therefrom; 2dly, It is convenient to the  
mud in the bed of the creek, whensoever (by means of the  
scow) resort is had thereto, and good landing places; and,  
3dly, It is as near to the barn as any other, when a bridge and  
causeway shall be made over the Spring Branch. ‘To these may  
be added, that it is more remote from squirrels than any other.  
  
Nos. 6 and 7, or such part thereof as is not so much washed  
or gullied, as to render ploughing ineligible, are to be fallowed  
for wheat. One of which, if both cannot, is to have the stub-  
ble ploughed in and sown with rye, and the low and strong  
parts to have timothy or orchard-grass seeds, perhaps both, in  
different places, sprinkled over them, for the purpose of raising  
seed. On the rye pasture the sheep are to be fed in winter  
and spring, and treated in all respects as No. 3 in 1800.  
  
In the Years 1802, 1803, and so on.  
  
The corn ground remaining the same, two fields, in the  
following numbers, will be fallowed for wheat, and treated in  
all respects as mentioned above ; and if pumpkins, cymlins,  
turnips, pease, and such like growth, are found beneficial to  
the land, or useful and profitable for stock, ground may readily  
be found for them.  
  
These are the great outlines of a plan, and the operations of  
it, for the next year, and for years to come, for the River Farm.  
The necessary arrangements, and all the preparatory measures  
for carrying it into effect, ought to be adopted without delay,  
and invariably pursued. Smaller matters may, and undoubt-  
edly will, occur occasionally, but none, it is presumed, that  
can militate against it materially.

To carry it into effect advantageously, it becomes the indis-  
pensable duty of him, who is employed to overlook and conduct  
the operations, to take a prospective and comprehensive view  
of the whole business, which is laid before him, that the sev-  
eral parts thereof may be so ordered and arranged, as that one  
sort of work may follow another sort in proper succession, and  
without loss of labor or of time ; for nothing is a greater waste  
of the latter, and consequently of the former, (time producing  
labor, and labor money,) than shifting from one thing to an-  
other before it is finished, as if chance or the impulse of the  
moment, not judgment and foresight, directed the measure.  
It will be acknowledged, that weather and other circumstan-  
ces may at times interrupt a regular course of proceedings, but  
if a plan is well digested beforehand, they cannot interfere  
long, with a man who is acquainted with the nature of the  
business, and the crops he is to attend to.  
  
Every attentive and discerning person, who has the whole  
business of the year laid before him, and is acquainted with  
the nature of the work, can be at no loss to lay it out to advan-  
tage. He will know, that there are many things which can  
be accomplished in winter as well as in summer ; others, that  
spring, summer, and autumn only are fit for; in a word, to  
use the wise man’s saying, that ‘‘there is a time and a season  
for all things,”’ and that unless they are embraced, nothing will  
thrive or go on smoothly. There are many sorts of in-doors  
work, which can be executed in hail, rain, or snow, as well as  
in sunshine ; and if they are set about in fair weather, (unless  
there be a necessity for it,) there will be nothing to do in foul  
weather ; the people therefore must be idle. ‘The man of pru-  
dence and foresight will always keep these things in view,  
and order his work accordingly, so as to suffer no waste of  
time, or idleness. These same observations apply with equal  
force to frozen ground, and to ground too wet to work in, or  
which if worked will be injured thereby.  
  
These observations might be spun to a greater length, but  
they are sufficient to produce reflection, — and reflection, with  
industry and proper attention, will produce the end that is to  
be wished.  
  
There is one thing, however, I cannot forbear to add, and  
in strong terms; it is, that whenever I order a thing to be  
done, it must be done; or a reason given at the time, or as  
soon as the impracticability is discovered, why it cannot be done,  
which will produce a countermand or change. But it is not for  
the person receiving the order to suspend, or dispense with its

ERS’ CABINET. 115  
  
Feeding.  
  
The work-horses and mules are always to  
be in their stalls, and all littered and cleaned,  
when they are out of harness; and they are to  
be plenteously fed with cut straw, and as much  
chopped grain, meal, or bran, with a little  
salt mixed therewith, as will keep them  
always in good condition for work; seeing  
also, that they are watered as regularly as  
they are fed; this is their winter feed. For  
spring, summer and autumn, it is expected,  
that soiling them on green food, first with  
rye, then with lucern, and next with clover,  
with very little grain, will enable them to  
perform their work.  
  
The oxen and other horaed cattle, are to  
be housed from the first of November until  
the first of May; and to be fed as well  
as the means on the farm will admit. The  
first (oxen) must always be kept in good  
condition; housed in the stalls designed for  
them; and the cows (so many of them as  
can find places) on the opposite side. The  
rest, with the other cattle, must be in the  
newly erected sheds; and the whole care-  
fully watered every day; the ice, in frozen  
weather, being broken, so as to admit them  
to clean water.  
  
With respect to the sheep, they must re-  
ceive the best protection that can be given  
them this winter; against the next, I hope  
they will be better provided for.  
  
And with regard to the hogs, the plan  
must be, to raise a given number of good  
ones, instead of an indiscriminate number of  
indifferent ones, half of which die or are sto-  
len before the period arrives for putting  
them up as porkers. To accomplish this a  
sufficient number of the best sows should be  
/appropriated to the purpose; and so many  
‘pigs raised from them as will insure the  
quantity of pork, which the farm ought to  
furnish.  
  
Whether it will be most advisable to re-  
strain these hogs from running at large or  
‘not, can be decided with more precision after  
the result of those now in close pens is better  
known.  
| The exact quantity of corn used by those,  
| which are now in pens, should be ascertained  
‘and regularly reported, in order to learn the  
result.  
  
Stables and Farm Pens.  
  
These ought to be kept well littered, and  
the stalls clean; as well for the comfort of

To carry it into effect advantageously, it  
mes the indispensable duty of him, who  
s employed to overlook and conduct the op-  
-tions, to take a prospective and compre-  
wansive view of the whole business, which  
= jaid before him, that the several i  
  
beco  
  
»ereof may be so ordered and arranged, as  
nat one sort of work may follow another  
‘t in proper succession, and without loss|  
of Jabor or of time: for nothing isa greater)  
waste of the latter, and consequently of the|  
érmer, (time producing labor, and labor mo-|  
»y,) than shifting from one thing to another|  
here it is finished, as if chance or the im-|  
oyise of the moment, not judgment and fore-|  
sight, directed the measure. It will be ac-  
-,owledged, that weather and other circum-  
stances may at times interrupt a regular  
course of proceedings, but if a plan is well  
divested beforehanc, they cannot interfere  
long, with a man who is acquainted with the  
nature of the business, and the crops he is to  
attend to.  
  
Every attentive and discerning person,  
who has the whole business of the year laid  
before him, and is acquainted with the na-  
ture of the work, can be at no loss to lay it  
out toadvantage. He will know that there  
aremany things which can be accomplished  
a winter as well as in summer; others,  
that spring, summer, and autumn only are  
‘it for: in a word, to use the wise man’s  
saying, that “there is a time and a sea-  
on for all things,” and that unless they  
are embraced, nothing will thrive or go on  
smoothly. There are many sorts of in-doors  
work, which can be executed in hail, rain,  
of snow, as well as in sunshine; and if|  
they are set about in fair weather, (unless  
tere be a necessity for it,) there will be  
nothing to do in foul weather; the people  
therefore must be idle. The man of pru-  
jence and foresight will always keep these  
things in view, and order his work accord-|  
  
tha  
  
-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ingly, so as to suffer no waste of time or],  
  
idleness. These same observations apply},  
with equal foree to frozen ground, and to  
ground too wet to work in, or which if  
worked will be injured thereby.  
  
These observations might be spun to a  
greater length, but they are sufficient to pro-  
cuce reflection; and reflection, with industry  
and proper attention, will produce the end  
that is to be wished.  
  
There is one thing, however, I cannot}  
forbear to add, and in strong terms; it is,  
that whenever I order a thing to be done, it  
must be done; or a reason given at the  
time, or as soon as the impracticability is

Mud for Compost.  
  
“The season is now too far advanced, and  
too cold, to be engaged in a work that will expose  
the hands to wet; but it is of such essential im-  
portance that it should be set about seriously and  
with spirit next year, for the summer&#x27;s sun and the  
winter’s frost to prepare it for the corn and other  
crops of the next year. All the hands of the farm,  
not indispensably engaged in the crops, should, so  
soon as corn-planting is completed in the spring,  
be uninterrupted!y employed in raising mud from  
the swamp and from the bed of the creek, into the  
scow ; and the carts, so soon as the manure for  
the corn and potatoes is carried out, are to be in-  
cessantly drawing it to the compost heaps in the  
fields which are to be manured by it. What num-  
ber of hands can be set apart for this all-important  
work, remains to be considered and decided upon.”  
  
Meadows.  
  
“ Those already established and in train must  
continue, and the next to be added to them is the  
arms of the creek, and forks, both forks of which  
must be grubbed up, and wrought upon at every  
convenient moment when the weather will permit,  
down to the line of the ditch. And as the fields  
come into cultivation, or as labor can be spared  
from other work, and circumstances will permit,  
the heads of all the inlets in them must be reclaim-  
ed and laid to grass, whether they be large or  
small.”

Feeding.  
  
«The work horses and mules are always to be  
in their stalls, and all litered and cleaned, when  
they are out of the harness; and they are to be  
plenteously fed with cut straw and as much chopped  
grain, meal, or bran, with a Tittle salt mixed there-  
with, as will keep them always in good condition  
for work, seeing also, that they are watered as reg-  
ularly as they are fed: this is their winter feed,”
