tte. You ask, in your letter of Apr. 24. details of my sufferings by Colo. Tarleton. I did not suffer by him. On the contrary he behaved very genteelly with me. On his approach to Charlottesville which is within 3. miles of my house at Monticello, he dispatched a troop of his horse under Capt. Mc.leod with the double object of taking me prisoner with the two Speakers of the Senate and Delegates who then lodged with me, and remaining there in vedette, my house commanding a view of 10. or 12 counties round about. He gave strict orders to Capt. Mc.leod to suffer nothing to be injured. The troop failed in one of their objects, as we had notice so that the two speakers had gone off about two hours before their arrival at Monticello, and myself with my family about five minutes. But Captn. Mc.leod preserved every thing with sacred care during about 18. hours that he remained there. Colo. Tarleton was just so long at Charlottesville being hurried from thence by news of the rising of the militia, and by a sudden fall of rain which threatened to swell the river and intercept his return. In general he did little injury to the inhabitants on that short and hasty excursion, which was of about 60. miles from their main army then in Spotsylvania, and ours in Orange. It was early in June 1781. Lord Cornwallis then proceeded to the point of fork, and encamped his army from thence all along the main James river to a seat of mine called Elkhill, opposite to Elk island and a little below the mouth of the Byrd creek. (You will see all these places exactly laid down in the map annexed to my Notes on Virginia printed by Stockdale.) He remained in this position ten days, his own head quarters being in my house at that place. I had had time to remove most of the effects out of the house. He destroyed all my growing crops of corn and tobacco, he burned all my barns containing the same articles of the last year, having first taken what corn he wanted, he used, as was to be expected, all my stocks of cattle, sheep, and hogs for the sustenance of his army, and carried off all the horses capable of service: of those too young for service he cut the throats, and he burnt all the fences on the plantation, so as to leave it an absolute waste. He carried off also about 30. slaves: had this been to give them freedom he would have done right, but it was to consign them to inevitable death from the small pox and putrid fever then raging in his camp. This I knew afterwards to have been the fate of 27. of them. I never had news of the remaining three, but presume they shared the same fate. When I say that Lord Cornwallis did all this, I do not mean that he carried about the torch in his own hands, but that it was all done under his eye, the situation of the house, in which he was, commanding a view of every part of the plantation, so that he must have seen every fire. I relate these things on my own knowlege in a great degree, as I was on the ground soon after he left it. He treated the rest of the neighborhood somewhat in the same stile, but not with that spirit of total extermination with which he seemed to rage over my possessions. Wherever he went, the dwelling houses were plundered of every thing which could be carried off. Lord Cornwallis’s character in England would forbid the belief that he shared in the plunder. But that his table was served with the plate thus pillaged from private houses can be proved by many hundred eye witnesses. From an estimate I made at that time on the best information I could collect, I supposed the state of Virginia lost under Ld. Cornwallis’s hands that year about 30,000 slaves, and that of these about 27,000 died of the small pox and camp fever, and the rest were partly sent to the West Indies and exchanged for rum, sugar, coffee and fruits, and partly sent to New York, from whence they went at the peace either to Nova Scotia, or England. From this last place I believe they have been lately sent to Africa. History will never relate the horrors committed by the British army in the Southern states of America. They raged in Virginia 6. months only, from the middle of April to the middle of October 1781. when they were all taken prisoners, and I give you a faithful specimen of their transactions for 10. days of that time and in one spot only. Expede Herculem. I suppose their whole devastations during those 6. months amounted to about three millions sterling.—The copiousness of this subject has only left me space to assure you of the sentiments of esteem and respect with which I am Sir your most obedt. humble servt.,

destroyed Mr. Jefferson’s crops of corn and tobacco, burned his  
barns containing the crops of the previous year, consumed his cattle,

the most aggravated kind, and fix an indelible stain upon his  
character. For ten days his head-quarters were established  
in a house belonging to Mr. Jefferson, who has left on record  
some reminiscences of this occupation. In a letter to Doctor  
Gordon, dated July 16, 1788, and printed in the second vol-  
ume of his Works, he says, Lord Cornwallis * destroyed all  
my growing crops of corn and tobacco; he burned all my  
barns, containing the same articles of the last year, having  
first taken what corn he wanted; he used, as was to be  
expected, all my stock of cattle, sheep, and hogs, for the  
sustenance of his army, and carried off all the horses capable  
of service ; of those too young for service he cut the throats ;  
he burned all the fences on the plantation, so as to leave it  
an absolute waste. He carried off also about thirty slaves.”  
Mr. Jefferson then goes on to speak of the depredations com-  
mitted on the property of his neighbors, and in order to guard  
against any mistake, he adds: * When I say that Lord Corn-  
wallis did all this, 1 do not mean that he carried about the  
torch in his own hands, but that it was all done under his  
eye; the situation of the house in which he was commanding

I have happened to light on another authority from the Vir-  
ginia of the Revolution, when the Old Dominion had great men,  
George Mason, the grandfather (I believe) of the rebel emis-  
sary now at London, said in the Convention which formed our  
Constitution,  
  
“ The evil of having slaves was experienced during the late war. Had slaves  
been treated as they might have been by the enemy, they would have proved dan-  
gerous instruments in their hands. But their folly dealt by the slaves as it did  
by the Tories.”
