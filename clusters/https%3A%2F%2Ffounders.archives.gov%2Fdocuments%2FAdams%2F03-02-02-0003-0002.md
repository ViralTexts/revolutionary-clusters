Townsend took cold in making the preparations for this ball, and was so unwell, that at about 11 o’clock, he went home and consigned his Lady, Miss L. Knight, to me. She being very agreeable, was upon the whole I believe, more the object of my attentions than another Lady: this cannot now be helped and whatever is, is right.

is a canon of logic which denies us the privi-

admits of two constructions, without show-
