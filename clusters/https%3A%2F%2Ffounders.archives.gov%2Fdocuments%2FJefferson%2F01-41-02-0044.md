Before you recieve this you will have heard thro’ the channel of the public papers, of the cession of Louisiana by France to the US. the terms as stated in the National Intelligencer are accurate. that the treaty may be ratified in time I have found it necessary to convene Congress on the 17th. of October: and it is very important for the happiness of the country that they should possess all the information which can be obtained respecting it, that they may make the best arrangements practicable for it’s good government. it is the more necessary because they will be obliged to ask from the people an amendment of the constitution authorising their recieving this province into the union, &amp; providing for it’s government; and the limitations of power which shall be given by that amendment will be unalterable but by the same authority. I have therefore sent some queries to mr Clarke of New Orleans, to be answered by such persons as he shall think best qualified, and to be returned to me before the meeting of Congress, and knowing that you have turned your attention to many of the subjects, I inclose you a copy of them, and ask the favor of you to give me what information you can in answer to such of them as you shall select as lying within the scope of your information. I am encouraged to propose this trouble to you by a thorough persuasion of your readiness &amp; desire to serve the public cause by whatever shall be in your power: and by the belief that you are one of those who will sincerely rejoice at our success in relieving you by peaceable means from a powerful &amp; enterprising neighbor &amp; establishing on a permanent basis the tranquility, security and prosperity of that interesting country. I tender you my friendly salutations and assurances of my great esteem &amp; respect.

July 18. P.S. Since writing the preceding your favor of June 10. has been recieved. the exchange of a peaceable for a warring neighbor at New Orleans was undoubtedly ground of just and great disquietude on our part: and the necessity of acquiring the country could not be unpercieved by any. the question which divided our legislature (but not the nation) was whether we should take it at once, &amp; enter single-handed into war with the most powerful nation on earth, or place things on the best footing practicable for the present, and avail ourselves of the first war in Europe (which it was clear was at no great distance) to obtain the country as the price of our neutrality, or as a reprisal for wrongs which we were sure enough to recieve. the war happened somewhat sooner than was expected; but our measures were previously taken, and the thing took the best turn for both parties. those who were honest in their reasons for preferring immediate war, will in their candour, rejoice that their opinion was not followed. they may indeed still believe it was the best opinion according to probabilities. we however believed otherwise and they, I am sure, will now be glad that we did.   the letter of yesterday will shew you my desire of recieving information from you, and I shall always be thankful for it. my wish is to hear every thing, compare all together, and to do what on the whole I conscientiously think for the best.

Washington, July 17th, Ifcoj.  
^ Dkak Sir: Before you receive this you wi.I  
have Iveard, through the channel ol the public  
paper!, of the cession of Louisiana by France  
to the U. States, the terms as stated in the Na­  
tional Intelligencer are accurate. That the  
treaty may be ratified in time, I have found it  
necessary to convene Congress on the 17th of  
October: and it is very important for the hap­  
piness of the country, that they should possess  
all the information which can be obtained re­  
specting it, that they make the best arrange­  
ment practicable for its good government; it is  
tlit more necessary because they will be oblig­  
ed to ask from the People an amendment of the  
Constitution, authorizing their receiving the  
prov ince into the Union, and providing for its  
government; and the limitations of power,which  
shall In- given by that amendment, will be unal­  
terable but by the same authority. I have, there­  
fore, sent some queries to Mr. Clark, of New  
Oi leans, to be answered by such person as he  
shall think best qualified, and to be returned to  
me before the meeting of Congress; and know­  
ing that you have turned your attention to nta­  
iy ofthe subjects, I enclose you a copy of them  
and ask the favor of you to give me what infor­  
mation you can in answer to such of them as  
you shall select as lying within the scope of  
your information. I am encouraged to pro­  
pose thus to trouble you by a thorough persua­  
sion of yuur readiness and desire to serve the  
public cause by whatever shall b« in your pow­  
et: and by the belief that you aue one of those  
who will sincerely rejoice at our success in re­  
lit-Mng you,by pi aceable means, from a pow­  
tiful and enterprising neighbor; and establish­  
ing on a permuin m basis the tranquility, secu­  
rity, and prosperity, of that interesting country  
i tender you myt friendly salutations and assur­  
ances of great esteem and respect.  
THOMAS JEFFERSON.  
William Dunbar, Esq.  
P. S. July 18.—Since writing the preceding,  
your favour (4 June 10, has been received. The  
exchange of a peaceable for a warring neigh­  
bour at New Orleans, was undoubtedly ground  
of just and great disquietude on our pari: and  
the necessity of acquiring the country could not  
be unperceived by any. The question which  
divided our Legislature (but not the nation)  
was, whether we should take it at once, and en­  
ter single handed into war with the most pow­  
eil’ul nation on earth, or place things on the  
best footing practicable for the present, and a­  
yail ourselves of the first war in Europe (which  
it was clear was at no great distance) to obtain  
the country as the price of our neutrality, or as  
a reprisal for wrongs which we were sure c­  
nough to receive. The war happened some­  
what sooner than was expected: but our mea­  
sures were previously taken, and the thing took  
the best turn for both parties. Those who  
were honest in their reasons for preferring im­  
mediate war, will, in their candour, rejoice that  
their opiniou was not followed. They may in­  
deed still believe it was the best opinion accor­  
ding to probabilities. We, however, believed  
otherwise, and they, I am sure, will now be  
glad that we did. &#x27;I he letter of yesterday will  
show you my desire of receiving information  
from you, and I shall always be thankful fur it.  
My wish is to have every thing, compare all to­  
get her, ar.d to do what, on the whole, I consci­  
entiously think for the best. I repeat my satis­

tr. 3. JtJijr is.—Since writing the preceding,  
your lavur of June 1U has been received, The ex­  
change ot a peaceable lor a warring neighbor at  
New Oilcans, was undoubtedly ground of just and  
great disquietude on om part : and the necessity of  
acquiring the country could not be unperceived by  
any. 1 he question which divided our LegisJa&#x27;ure  
U,ul not the nation) was, whether we should take  
it at once, and enter single handed into war with the  
most powerful nation on earth, or place things oti  
the best fooling practicable for the present, and a­  
vail ourselves of the first war in Euiope (which it  
was clear was at no great di-lance) to obtain the  
country as the price ot our neutrality, or as a repri­  
sal for wrong* which we were suit entugh to re­  
ceive. 1 ha a ar happened somewhat sooner than  
was expected; but our measures were previou-ly  
taken, and the thing topk the best turn for b&gt;&#x27;b par­  
ti:&#x27;-. Tho-e who were hone-t in their reasons for  
preferring immediate war, will, in their candor, re­  
joice that their opinion waa not followed. They  
may indeed.still believe it wan the best opinion  
according to probabil.ties. We, however, believed  
otherwise, and ihry, I am sure, will not be glad that  
we did The letter of yesterday will show you my  
cieetre of receiving information front you, and I shall  
always be thankful for it. My wish is to have  
every thing, coti)|sreaIJ together, and to do what,  
on ihfe win le, I conscientiously think for ihe best. I
