all thi&#x27;t Mr. Jefferson Buys therein on the  
subject of liquor.  
&quot;I rejoice, ns a moralist, at tho pros­  
pect of a rt dilution of the duties on wine,  
by ;ur national legislature. It is an error  
to view a tax on that liquor as merely a  
tax on the rich. It is u prohibition of its  
use to the middle class of our citizens,  
and a condemnation of them to the  
poison of whisky, which is desolating  
their houses. No nation is drunken  
where wino is cheap; and none hobi r  
where tho deanuss if wine substitutes  
ardent spirits as the common beverage.  
It is iu truth tha only antidote to the  
bane of whisky. Fix but the duty at the  
rate of other merchandise, and  
driuk wiue hero as cheap  
do grog; and who will not  
it? Its extended use will

eularged circle. L&#x27;very one in easy cir­  
cumstances (as the bulk of our citizens  
are) will prefer it, to the poison to which  
they are now driven by their government.  
And the treasury itself will find that a  
peutiy apiece from a dozen, is more than  
a groat from a single one. This infor­  
mation, however, will require time. Our  
merchants know nothing of tho infinite  
variety of cheap and good wines to be  
had in Europe; and particularly in France,  
in Italy aud the Grecian islands.
