				Well My dear son S Carolin has behaved as Your Father always Said She would. the concequence to us personally, is that We retire from public Life: for myself and family I have few regreets; at My  
  
age and with my bodily infirmities I shall be happier at Quincy. neither my habits, or My Education or inclinations, have led Me to an expensive stile of living; So on that score I have little to mourn over; if I did not rise with Dignity, I can at least fall with ease; which is the more difficult task— I Wish Your Fathers circumstances were not So limited, and circumscribed as they must be, because he cannot indulge himself in those improvements upon his Farm which his inclination leads him too, and which would serve to amuse him, and contribute to his Health; I feel not any resentment against those who are comeing into power, and only wish the future administration of the Government may be as productive of the peace happiness and prosperity of the Nation as the two former ones have made it— I leave to time the unfolding of a drama. I leave to posterity to reflect upon the times past—and I leave them Characters to contemplate
