 the House of Representatives of the U. S. and in that august body, produced a most extraordinary diversity of opinion. It came before them at the first session, after the adoption of the federal constitution, on a resolution offered by Mr. Madison in the committee of the whole, “that it is the opinion of this committee that there shall be established, an executive department to be denominated the department of foreign affairs; at the head of which there shall be an officer to be called the secretary to the department of foreign affairs, who shall be appointed by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the senate; and to be removeable by the president.” Immediately on the presentation of this resolution, the words “who shall be appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate,” were stricken out on the ground, that “the constitution had expressly given the power of appointment in the words there used.” The resolution as amended after much debate was carried, with an understanding that an opportunity would be offered for an ample discussion of the power of removal, which was denied to the president, by several members on many grounds. On the 15th of June, 1789, the question came again before the House, on the bill for establishing an executive department, to be denominated the department of foreign affairs. A more interesting animated, and argumentative debate, is not to be found in our congressional annals, than, that which arose on this occasion. The  
  
first clause of the bill after recapitulating the title of the officer and his duties had these words, “To be removeable from office by the president of the United States.”  
The power to remove from office was generally admitted to be lodged, in the gen. gov. but to what br[a]nch it was constitutionally given, was a point, producing great collision of opinion. There were however some gentlemen, who denied, that the power of removal from office, for

 one, and we think it can bear no other name, the inference must not be drawn that Mr. M. is at all times friendly to constructive powers. In the XIIth No. of the Federalist, he combats this doctrine manfully, and on the principles which be there laid down, he in the year 1791 resisted the incorporation of the United States Bank. In addition to the reasons he drew from the specific enumeration of powers in the constitution, he gives one that we would think was conclusive and insurmountable in his own mind at least. On the floor of Congress, Mr. [M.] declared, “That the power to grant charters of incorporation was in the original plan reported by the committee to the convention among the enumerated powers granted by the 8th section of the first article of the constitution; but that after three days consideration and ardent debate in that body, it was stricken out, as a power improper to be vested in the general government.” In the face of this declaration and of this fact, Mr M. as President of the United States sanctioned an act incorporating the Bank of the United States. Again, the Federalist is deemed a text book on the constitution, in the composition of which Mr. M took a considerable part, and is generally supposed to have seen and approved, all communicated to the public under the signature of Publius. The 77th number of that work, treating of the President’s power to appoint, commences thus, “It has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the senate in the business of appointments that it would contribute to the stability of the administration. The consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint.” The Federalist we all know, was written to enforce the acceptance of the Federal constitution by the several states. It was written principally by Messrs. Madison and Hamilton, who were members of the convention which framed that constitution, and therefore the presumption that their exposition of that instrument, was

No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labor for objection than their stooping to such a misconstruction. (Has experience shewn this to be a misconstruction?) What color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to, by these general terms immediately follows; and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?

t of the same sentence be excluded altogether from a share in the meaning; and shall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent, and the clear, precise expressions be denied any signification whatever? For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural or common, than first to use a general phrase, and then to  
  
explain and qualify it by a recital of the particulars. But the idea of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead, is an absurdity which as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection, or on the authors of the constitution, we must take the liberty of supposing, it had not its origin with the latter.”  
Now may we not ask, is there an argument here used against constructive powers in congress, that does not apply with equal force to such power in the President. Is not the passage rel

abilities, had these words:-&quot;To be removable from of.­

moved to strike out these words, and the motion was  
sustained with great ability and vigor. It was insisted  
that the President could not constitutionally exercise  
the power of removal exclusively of the Senate; that

looked as if they were conferring power, which  
was not the case, for the Constitution had ex­  
pressly given the power of appointments in

of removal. The words &quot;who shall be ap­

it shows how largely the element of speculation entered into  
all the discussions, and that while difficult to refute many of  
the theories advanced, the experience of the country has, in  
many respects, modified them.*  
  
The history of the measures introduced, and of the argu-  
ments presented, is as follows:  
  
On the I9th of May, 1789, Mr. Madison introduced into  
the House a resolution looking to the establishment of a  
Department of Foreign Affairs, at the head of which should  
be an officer “ appointed by the President by and with the  
advice and consent of the Senate, and to be removable by  
the President.” The objection was raised that the words  
““who shall be appointed by the President by and with the  
advice and consent of the Senate” were superfluous, as such  
power was expressly given by the Constitution. As all con-  
ceded this, the debate took place on the clause, “to be  
removable by the President.” While before the Committee  
of the Whole an amendment was proposed, adding the  
words, “ by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,”  
but it was lost and the question carried, by a considerable  
majority, in favor of declaring the power of removal to be i

removal and at the debates which have taken place in Con-  
gress in regard to it. The question arose in the first session  
of the first Congress which met after the adoption of the  
Constitution.  
  
On the 19th of May, 1789, in the House of Representatives,  
Mr. Madison moved “ That it is the opinion of this committee  
that there shall be established an executive department, to be

of the whole on the state of the Union, Mr.  
Boudinot, of New Jersey, moved “that an  
office be established for the management of  
the finances of the United States, at the head  
of which shall be an officer to be denominated  
‘the Secretary of Finance.’” After debate,  
the motion was withdrawn at the request of  
Mr. Madison, who moved “that there shall be  
established an Executive Department, to be  
denominated ‘the Department of Foreign  
Affairs,’ at the head of which there shall be  
an officer, to be called the Secretary to the  
Department of Foreign Affairs, who shall be  
appointed by the President, by and with the  
advice and consent of the Senate, and to be  
removable by the President.” The latter  
clause of this resolution was strenuously op-  
posed by Mr. Smith, of South Carolina, and  
others, on the ground that the Constitution  
had not vested the power of removal in  
the President, that Congress had no au-  
thority to confer it upon him, and that the  
only constitutional mode of removing an  
officer is by impeachment. Mr. Bland, of  
Virginia, moved to amend the resolution by  
adding the words, “ by and with the advice
