] July  1803  
I take the Liberty to add a few miscellaneous articles by way of supplement to my last dispatch.  
American Seamen  
As soon as the war appeared to me unavoidable I thought it advisable to renew the attempt to form an arrangement with the British Government for the protection of our seamen: with this view I had several conferences both with Lord Hawkesbury and Mr. Addington who avowed a sincere disposition to do whatever might be in their power to prevent the dissatisfaction on this subject that had so frequently manifested itself during the late war: with very candid professions, I however found several Objections in discussing the subject, with the first lord of the Admiralty: Lord Hawkesbury having promised to sign any agreement upon the subject that I should conclude with Lord St. Vincent, I endeavoured to qualify and remove the Objections he Offered to our project, &amp; finally, the day before I left London Lord St. Vincent consented to the following Regulations—  
1. No seaman, nor sea faring person shall upon the high seas, and without the jurisdiction of either party, be demanded, or taken off any Ship, or vessel, belonging to the Citizens or subjects of one of the Parties, by the public or private armed ships or men of war belonging to, or in the service, of the other party: and strict orders shall be given for the due observance of this Engagement.  
2. Each party will prohibit its citizens, or subjects, from clandestinely concealing, or carrying away from the Territories or colonial possessions of the other, any seaman belonging to such other Party.  
3. These Regulations shall be in force for five years and no longer.  
On parting with his Lordship I engaged to draw up in the form of a convention, and send him these articles in the Course of the Evening, who promised to forward them with his approbation to Lord Hawkesbury. I accordingly prepared and put the Draught to his Lordship, who sent me a letter in the course of the night, stating that on farther Reflexion he was of opinion, that the narrow Seas should be expressly excepted, they having been as his Lordship remarked, immemorially considered to be within the Dominion of Great Britain; that with this correction he had sent the proposed convention to Lord Hawkesbury, who, his Lordship presumed, would not sign it before he should have consulted the judge of the high court of admiralty Sr. William Scott.  
As I had supposed from the Tenour of my conferences with Lord St. Vincent that the Doctrine of the mare clausum would not be revived against us on this Occasion, but that England would be content with the limited jurisdiction or Dominion over the Seas adjacent to her Territories, which is assigned by the Law of Nations to other States, I was not a little disappointed on receiving this communication; and after weighing well the nature of the Principle, and the disadvantages of its admission, I concluded to abandon the negotiation rather than to acquiesce in the Doctrine it proposed to establish.  
I regret not to have been able to put this Business on a satisfactory footing, knowing as I do its very great importance to both Parties, but I flatter myself that I have not misjudged the interest of our own Country in refusing to sanction a Principle that might be productive of more Extensive Evils than those it was our aim to prevent.  
Neutral Flag  
As it is possible that another attempt will be made during the present war to establish the Rule, that free bottoms make free Goods, I ought not to omit the Communication of the following annecdote.
