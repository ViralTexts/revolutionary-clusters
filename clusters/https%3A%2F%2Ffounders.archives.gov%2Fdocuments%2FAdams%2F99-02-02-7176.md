				I am in debt to you for your letters of May 21. 27. &amp; June 22. the first delivered me by mr Greenwood gave me the gratification of his acquaintance; and a gratification it always is to be made acquainted with gentlemen of candor, worth and information, as I found mr Greenwood to be. that on the subject of mr Samuel Adams Wells shall not be forgotten in time and place, when it can be used to his advantage. but what has attracted my peculiar notice is the paper from Mecklenburg county of N. Carolina, published in the Essex Register which you were so kind as to inclose in your last of June 22. and you seem to think it genuine. I believe it spurious. I deem it to be a very unjustifiable quiz, like that of the Volcano, so minutely related to us as having broken out in N. Carolina, some half dozen years ago, in that part of the country, and perhaps in that very county of Mecklenburg, for I do not remember it’s precise locality. if this paper be really taken from the Raleigh Register, as quoted, I wonder it should have escaped Ritchie, who culls what is good from every paper, as the bee from every flower; and the National Intelligencer too, which is edited by a N. Carolinian. and that the fire should blaze out all at once in Essex, 1000. miles from where the spark is said to have fallen. but if really taken from the Raleigh Register, who is the Narrator, and is the name subscribed real, or is it as fictitious as the paper itself? it appeals too to an original book, which is burnt, to mr Alexander who is dead, to a joint letter from Caswell, Hughes and Hooper, all dead, to a copy sent to the dead Caswell, and another sent to Doctr. Williamson, whose memory, now probably dead, did not recollect, in the history he has written of N. Carolina, this Gigantic step of it’s county of Mecklenburg. Horry too is silent in his history of Marion, whose scene of action was the country bordering on Mecklenburg. Ramsay, Marshal, Jones, Girardin, Wirt, historians of the adjacent states, all silent. when mr Henry’s resolutions, far short of independance, flew like lightning thro’ every paper, and kindled both sides of the Atlantic, this flaming declaration, of the same date, of the independance of Mecklenburg county of N. Carolina, absolving it from British allegiance, and abjuring all political connection with that nation, altho’ sent to Congress too, is never heard of. it is not known even a twelve month after when a similar proposition is first made in that body. armed with this bold example, would not you have addressed our timid brethren in peals of thunder, on their tardy fears? would not every advocate of independance have rung the glories of Mecklenburg county in N. Carolina in the ears of the doubting Dickinson and others, who hung so heavily on us? yet the example of independant Mecklenburg county in N. Carolina, was never once quoted. the paper speaks too of the continued exertions of their delegation, (Caswell, Hooper, Hughes) “in the cause of liberty and independance.” now you remember as well as I do, that we had not a greater tory in Congress than Hooper; that Hughes was very wavering, sometimes firm, sometimes feeble, according as the day was clear or cloudy; that Caswell indeed was a good whig, and kept these gentlemen to the notch, while he was present; but that he left us soon, and their line of conduct became then uncertain until Penn came, who fixed Hughes and the vote of the state. I must not be understood as suggesting any doubtfulness in the state of N. Carolina. no state was more fixed or forward. nor do I affirm positively that this paper is a fabrication: because the proof of a negative can only be presumptive. but I shall believe it such until positive and solemn proof of it’s authenticity shall be produced, and if the name of M’Knitt be real, and not a part of the fabrication, it needs a vindication by the production of such proof. for the present I must be an unbeliever in this apocryphal gospel.I am glad to learn that mr Tickner is safely returned to his friends. but should have been much gladder had he accepted the Professorship in our University, which we should have offered him in form. mr Bowditch too refuses us. so fascinating is the vinculum of the dulce Natale solum. our wish is to procure natives where they can be found, like these gentlemen, of the first order of acquirement in their respective lines; but, preferring foreigners of the 1st order to natives of the 2d. we shall certainly have to go, for several of our Professors, to countries more advanced in science than we are.I set out within 3. or 4. days for my other home, the distance of which and it’s cross mails, are great impediments to epistolary communications. I shall remain there about 2. months: and there, here and every where, I am and shall always be affectionately &amp; respectfully your’s.

Moxticello, July 9, 1819-  
Dear Sir I am i;i debt to you for your let­  
ters of May. the 21st, 27b, and June the 22d.  
The first, delivered me by Mr. Greenwood, gave  
me the gratification of his acquaintance ; and a  
gratification it always is, to be made acquainted  
with gentlemen of candor, worth and information,  
as I found Mr. Greenwood to lie. That, on the  
subject of Mr. Samuel Adams Wells, shall not  
be forgotten in time and place, when it can be  
used to his advantage.  
But what Ins attracted my peculiar notice, is  
the paper from Mecklenburg county of North  
Carolina, published in the Essex Register, which  
yon were so kind as to inclose in your last, f  
June the 22d. And you seem to think it genu­  
ine.&#x27; I believe it spurious. I deem it to be u  
very unjustifiable quiz, like that of the volcano,  
so minutely related to us ns having broken out in  
North Carolina, some half dozen years ago, in  
that part of the country, and perhaps in that very  
county of Mecklenburg, for I do not remember  
its precise locality. If this paper bo really taken  
from tho&#x27;Raleigh Register, as quoted, I wonder  
it should have escaped Ritchie, who culls what  
is good from every paper, as the bee from every  
flower&quot;; and the National Intelligencer, loo,  
which is edited by a North Carolinian : and that  
the&#x27;fire should blaze out all at once1 in Essex, one  
thousand miles from where the spark is said to  
have fallen. But if realty taken from the Ba­  
leigh Register, who is the narrator, and is the  
name subscribed real, or is it as fictitious as the  
paper itself? It appeals, too, to an original  
book, which is burnt, to Mr. Alexander, who is  
dead, to a joint letter from Caswell, Hughes  
and Hooper, all dead, to a copy sent to the dead  
Caswell, and another sent to Doctor Williamson,  
now probably dead, whose memory did not re­  
collect, in the history he has written of North  
Carolina, this gigantic step of its county of  
Mecklenburg. Horry, too, is silent in his his­  
tory of Marion, whose scene of action was the  
  
country bordering on Mecklenburg. Ramsay,  
Marsli-.ill, Joies, Girardin, Wirt, historians of  
the adiacent Stales, all silent. When Mr. Hen  
ry&#x27;s &#x27; resolutions, far short of independence,  
flew like lightning through every paper, and  
kindled both sides of the Atlantic, this fla­  
ming declaration of the same date, of tho inde­  
pendence of Mecklc.ibu g county, of North  
Carolina, absolving it from the British allegiance,  
:uid abjuring all political connection with that  
nation, although sent to Congress, too. is never  
heard of. It is not known even a twelvemonth  
after, when a similar proposition is first made in  
that b(Hy. Armed with this bold example,  
would not you have addressed our timid breth­  
ren in peais of thunder, on their tardy fears?  
Would not every advocate ol independence nave  
mnsr the glories of Mecklenburg eouniy, in North  
Carolina in the ears of the doubting Dickinson  
and others, who hung so heavily on us? Yet  
the example of independent Mecklenburg eoun­  
iy, in North Carolina, was never once quoted.  
Tim paper speaks, too, of the continued exer­  
ti.ms of their delegation (Caswell, Hooper,  
H ighes,) in the cause of liberty and indepen­  
dence.&#x27; Now, you remember as well as 1 do,  
that we had not a greater tory in Congress than  
Hooper; that Hughes was very wavering, some­  
times firm, sometimes feeble, according as the  
day was clear or cloudy ; that Caswell, indeed,  
was a good whig, and kept these gentlemen to  
the notch, while he was present ; but that he  
left us soon, and their line of conduct became  
then uncertain until Penn came, who hxed  
IIiktIu s. and the vote of the State. I must not  
be understood as suggesting any doubtfulness in  
th Stati. of North Carolina, rso State was  
more fixed or forward. Nor do I affirm, posi  
tiunh- ihat this nuDer is a tauricdtion : bi -cause  
the proof of a negative can only be presump  
tive. But I sh ill believe it such until positive  
and solemn proof of its authenticity shall be  
produced. And if the name of McKnitt bp  
real, and not a part of the fabrication, it needs  
a vindication by the production of such proof.  
For the present&quot;, I must be an unbeliever in the  
anocrvphul gospel.

MonticEllo, July 9, 1819.  
I am in debt to you for your letters of May the 21st,  
27th, and June, the 224. But what has attracted my pe  
culiar notice is the paper from Mecklenburg County of  
North Carolina, published in the Esser Register, which  
you were so kind as to enclose in your last of June 22  
And you seem to think it genuine. I believe it spurious  
I deem it to be a very unjustifiable quiz, like that of the  
volcano, so minutely related to us as having broken out  
in North Carolina some half dozen years ago, in that part  
of the country, and perhaps in that very county of Meck  
lenburg, for I do not remember its precise locality. If  
this paper be really taken from the Raleigh Reuister, as  
quoted, I wonder it should have escaped Ritchie, who  
culls what is good from evory paper, as the bee from  
ever flower, and the National Intellicencer, too, which is  
dited by a North Carolinian, and that the fire should  
blaze out all at once in Essex IMass.), 1,000 miles from  
here the spark is said to have fallen. But if really  
taken from the Raleigh Register, who is the narrator;  
and is the name subscribed real, or is it as  
fictitions as the paper itself? It appeals, too,  
to an original book, which is burnt, to Mr  
Alexander, who is dead, to a joint letter from Cas.  
well. Hughes, and Hooper, all dead, to a copy sent to the  
dead Caswell, and another sent to Dr. Williamson, now  
probably dead, whose memory did not recollect, in the  
history he has written of North Carolina, this gigantic  
step of its county of Mecklenburg. Horry, too, is silent  
in his history of Genal Marion, whose scene of action was  
the country bordaring on Mecklenburg. Ramsay, Mar  
hall, Jones, Girardin, Wirt, historians of the adjacent  
States, all silent. When Mr. Patrick! Henry&#x27;s resolu  
tions, far short of independence (March, 1775), flew like  
lightning through every paper, and kindled both sides of  
the Atlantic, this flaming declaration of the same date,  
of the independence of Mecklenburg County, of North  
Carolina, absolving it from British allegiance, and ab­  
juring all political connection with that nation, although  
sent to Congress, too, is never heard of. It is not known  
even a twelvemonth after, when a similar proposition  
is first made in that body. Armed with this bold ex  
ample, would not you have addressed our timid breth  
ren in peals of thunder, on their tardy fears? Would  
not every advocate of independence have rung the glorie  
of Mecklenburg County, in North Caroliua, in the ears of  
the doubting Dickinson and others, who hung so heavil  
on us? Yet the examp&#x27;e of Mecklenburg County, in  
North Carolina, was never once quoted. The paper  
speaks, too, of the continued exertions of their delega  
tion, Caswell, Hooper, Hughes UHewesl, &quot;in the cause  
of liberty and independence.&quot; Now, you remember a  
well as I do that we had not a greater Tory in Congres  
than Hooper; that Hughes was very wavering, some  
times firm, sometimes feeble, according as the day was  
clear or cloudy; that Caswell, indeed, was a good Whig,  
and kept these gentlemen to the notch while he was  
present; but that he left us soon, and their line of con  
duct became then uncertain until Penn came, who fixed  
Hughes and the vote of that State. I must not be un  
derstood as suggesting any doubtfulness in the State of  
  
North Carolina. No State was more fixed or forward  
Nor do I affirm positively that this paper is a fabrication  
because the proof of a negative can only be presumptive  
But I shall believe it such until positive and solemn  
proof of its authenticity shall be produced. And if the  
name of Mcknitt be real, and not a part of the fabrica  
tion, it needs a vindication by the production of such  
proof. For the present I must be an unbeliever in the

&quot;Dear Sir : I am in debt ta&#x27;you  
for your letters of May 21st, 27tb,

livered me by Mr.;Grteenw6od,&#x27; fgave

Mr. barauel Adams Wells,1 shall not  
be forgotten in time and place, when  
it can be used t his advantage.  
&quot;But , what . has, attracted, any  
peculiar notice,, .is , tn paper irom  
Mecklenburg county, of North  
Carolina, published in the Essex  
Register, which you. were so kind, as  
tp enclose in your, last, of June (.the  
22nd. j And you seem to - think it  
genuine. I believe it spurious.  
believe it to be a very unjustifiable  
quiz, like that of tho volcano, so  
minutely related to us as having  
broken out in North Carolina, some  
half dozen years ago, in that part  
of the country, and perhaps in that  
very county ot Mecklenburg, for 1  
do not remember its precise locality.  
If this paper be really taken from  
the Raleigh Uegister, as quoted,  
wonder it should have escaped  
Ritchie, who culls what is good  
from every paper, as the bee from

and is the name subscribed real, or

It appeals; too. to an original book

ma,;was never once quoted. The  
paper speaks, too, of the continued  
exertions of the,ir delegation (Cas

iberty and mdependenceJ - Is ow,  
you remember as well as I do, that  
we had not a groater tory in Con  
gress than Hooper; that Hewes was  
very wavering, sometimes farm,  
sometimes feeble, according as the  
day wasjclear or cloudy ; that Cas

kept these gentlemen to the notch,  
while he was present; but that he  
left us soon, and their line of con­  
duct became then uncertain until  
Penn came, who fixed Hewes. and  
the vote of the State. I must not  
be understood as suggestine: any  
doubtfulness in the State of North  
Carolina. No State was more fixed  
or forward. Nor do I affirm, posi­  
tively, that this paper is a fabrica­  
tion, because the proof of a nega­  
tive can only be presumptive. But I  
shall believe it such until positive  
and solemn proof of its autbenticit3T  
shall be produced. And if the name  
ef McKnitt be real, and not a part  
of the fabrication, it needs a vindi­  
cation by . the production of such  
proof. For the present, I must be  
an unbeliever in the apocr3rphal  
gospel. . , , ..  
&quot;I am glad to learn that Mr.  
Ticknor has safely returned to his  
friends ; but should have been much  
more pleased bad he accepted the  
Professorship in our University,  
which we should have offered him  
in form. Mr. Bowditcb, too, refuses  
us ; so fascinating is the vinculum of  
the dulce natale solum. Our wish is  
to procure natives, where they can  
be found, like these gentlemen, of  
the . first order of acquirement in  
their respective lines; but preferring  
foreigners of the first order to  
natives of the second, we shall cer­  
tainly have to go, for several of our  
Professors, to countries more ad­  
vanced in science than we ae.  
&quot;I - set out within three or four  
dajs&quot;for my other home, the dis­  
tance of which, and its cross mails,  
are great impediments to epistolary  
communications. I shall remain  
there abont two months; and there,  
here, and everywhere, I am and  
shall always be, affectionately and  
resnectfully yours, ;
