Gentlemen of the Senate  
February 1797  
  
If, in the general Apprehension of an intention to retire in that most eminent Citizen, to whom all Eyes had been directed and all hearts attended, as the Center of our Union for So long a period; the public opinion had exhibited any clear Indications, of another, in whom our fellow Citizens could have generally united; as Soon as I read that excellent Address which announced the Necessity of deliberation, in the Choice of a President, I should have imitated the Example of a Character, with which I had cooperated, tho in less conspicuous and important Stations, and maintained an uninterrupted Friendship for two and twenty years. But as a number of Characters, appear’d to Stand in the general Estimation, So nearly on a level, as to render it difficult to conjecture, on which the majority would fall; considering the Relation in which I stood to the People of America, I thought it most respectful to them, and most conducive to the Tranquility of the public Mind to resign myself with others, a Silent Spectator of the general deliberation and a passive Subject of public discussions  
Deeply penetrated with Gratitude to my Countrymen in general, for their long continued Kindness to me, and for that Steady and affecting Confidence, with which, those who have most intimately known me from early Life, have on so many great occasions, entrusted to me, the care, of their dearest Interests; Since a majority of their Electors, tho a very Small one, have declared in my favour, and Since, in a Republican Government, the majority tho ever so small must of necessity decide, I have determin’d, at ever hazard of a high but just responsibility tho with much Anxiety and diffidence, once more to engage in their Service. Their Confidence, which has been the Chief Consolation of my Life, is too prescious and Sacred a deposit ever to be considered lightly. As it has been founded only on the Qualities of the heart, it never has been, it never can be, deceived betrayed or forfeited by me.  
It is with reluctance, and with all those Emotions of Gratitude and Affection, which a long experience of your goodness ought to inspire that I now retire from my Seat in this house and take my leave of the members of the Senate.  
I ought not to declare for the last time, your Adjournment, before I have presented to every Senator present, and to very Citizen who has ever been a Senator of the United States, my Thanks, for the candour and favour invariably receivd from them all. It is a recollection of which nothing can ever deprive me and it will be a Source of comfort to me, through the remainder of my Life, that, as on the one hand, in a Government constituted like ours, I have for Eight Years held the Second Situation under the Constitution of the United States, in perfect and uninterrupted harmony with the first, without envy in one, or Jealousy in the other: So on the other hand I have never had the smallest misunderstanding with any member of the Senate.—In all the abstruse questions, difficult Conjunctures, dangerous Emergencies, and animated debates upon the great Interests of our Country, which have So often and So deeply impress’d all our minds, and interested the Strongest feelings of the heart, I have experienced a uniform Politeness and respect from every quarter of the house. When Questions of no less importance than difficulty, have produced a difference of Sentiment (and differences of opinion will always be found in free Assemblies of Men, and probably the greatest diversities upon the greatest questions) When the Senators have been equally divided, and my opinion has been demanded according to the Constitution, I have constantly found, in that Moiety of the Senators, from whose Judgment of have been obliged to dissent a disposition to allow me, the same Freedom of deliberation, and Independence of Judgment which they asserted for themselves.  
Within these Walls for a course of Years, I have been an admiring Witness of a Succession of Information, Eloquence, Patriotism and Independence, which, as they would have done honour to any senate in any Age, afford a consolatory hope (if the Legislatures of the States are equally carefull in their future Selections, which there is no reason to distrust) that no Council more permanent than this as a Branch of the Legislature will be necessary, to defend the Rights, Liberties and Properties of the People, and to protect the Constitution of the United States as well as the Constitutions and Rights of the individual States, against Errors of Judgment irregularities of the Passions, or other encroachments of human Infirmity or more reprehensible Enterprize, in the Executive on one hand or the more immediate Representatives of the People on the other.  
These Considerations will all conspire to animate me in my future Course, with a confident Relyance, that as far as my Conduct Shall be uniformly measured by the Constitution of the United States and faithfully directed to the Public Good, I Shall be Supported by the Senate as well as by the House of Representatives and the People at large; and on no other Conditions ought any Support at all to be expected or desired  
With cordial Wishes for your Honour, Health and Happiness, and fervent Prayers for a Continuation of the Virtues, Liberties, Prosperity and Peace of our beloved Country, I avail myself of your Leave of Absence for the Remainder of the session and request that these Sentiments may be h

IF, in the general apprehenfion of an inten-  
tion to retire, in that moft eminent citizen, to  
whom all eyes had been directed and all hearts  
attracted, as the centre of our union for fo long  
a period; the public opinion had exhibited any  
clear indications of another, in whom our fellow  
citizens could have generally united; as foon as  
I read that excellent addrefs which announced  
the neceflity of deliberation in the choice of  
a Prefident; I fhould have imitated the example  
of a charaéter, with which I had co-operated,  
though:in lefs confpicuous and important ftations,  
and maintained an uninterrupted friendfhip for  
two and twenty years. But as a number of cha-  
racters appeared to ftand in the general eftima-  
tion, fo nearly on a level, as to render it difficult  
to conjecture, on which the majority would fall ;  
confidering the relation in which I ftood to the  
people of America, I thought it moft refpe&amp;ful  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
46  
  
to them, and moft conducive to the tranquillity  
of the public mind, to refign myfelf with others,  
a filent fpe&amp;tator of the general deliberation, and  
a paffive fubje&amp; of public difcuffions.  
  
Deeply penetrated with gratitude to my coun-  
trymen in general, for their long continued kind-  
nefs to me, and for that fteady and affe&amp;ting con-  
fidence, with which thofe who have moft inti-  
mately known me, from early life, have on fo  
many great occafions entrufted to me, the care  
of their deareft interefts; fince a majority of  
their electors, though a very fmall one, have de-  
clared in my favour, and fince, in a republican  
government, the majority, though ever fo fmall,  
muft of neceffity decide, I have determined at  
every hazard of a high but juft refponfibility,  
though with much anxiety and diffidence, once  
more to engage in their fervice—Their confi-  
dence, which has been the chief confolation of  
my life, is too precious and facred a depofit ever  
to be confidered lightly. As it has been found-  
ed only on the qualities of the heart, it never  
has been, it never can be, deceived, betrayed,  
or forfeited by me.  
  
It is with relutance, and with all thefe emo-  
tions of gratitude and affection, which a long ex-  
perience of your goodnefs ought to infpite, that I  
now retire from my feat in this houfe, and take  
iny leave of the members of the Senate.  
  
I ought not to declare, for the laft time, your  
adjournment, before I have prefented to every  
fenator prefent, and to every citizen who has  
ever been a fenator of the United States, my  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
47  
  
thanks, for the candour and favour invariably re-  
ceived from them all. It is a recollection, of  
which nothing can ever deprive me, and it will  
be a fource of comfort to me, through the re-  
mainder of my life, that, as on the one hand,  
in a government conftituted like ‘ours, I have for  
eight years held the fecond fituation under the  
conftitution of the United States, in perfect and  
uninterrupted harmony with the firft, without  
envy in one, or jealoufy in the other: fo, on  
the other hand, I have never had the {fmalleft  
mifunderftanding with any member of the fenate.  
In all the abftrufe queftions, difficult conjun@ures,  
dangerous emergencies, and animated debates  
upon the great interefts of our country, which  
have fo often and fo deeply impreffed all our  
minds, and interefted the ftrongeft feelings of  
the heart, I have experienced an uniform polite-  
nefs and refpect from every quarter of the houfe.  
When gueftions of no lefs importance than diffe  
culty, have produced a difference of fentiment  
(and differences of opinion will always be found  
in free afiemblies of men, and probably the  
greateft diverfities upon the greateft queftions),  
when the fenators have been equally divided,  
and my opinion has been demanded according  
to the conftitution, I have conftantly found, in  
that moiety of the fenators, from whole judgment  
I have been obliged to diffent, a difpofition to al-  
low me the fame freedom of deliberation and  
independence of judgment which they afflerted  
for themfelves.  
  
Within thefe walls, for a courfe of years, I  
have been an admiring witnefs of a fucceflion of  
information, eloquence, patriotifm and indepen-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
48  
  
dence, which, as they would have done honour  
to any fenate in any age, afford a confolatory  
hope (if the legiflatures of the ftates are equally  
careful in their future felections, which there is  
no reafon to diftruft) that no council more per-  
manent than this as a branch of the legiflature  
will be neceffary, to defend the rights, liberties,  
and properties of the people, and to proteét the  
conftitution of the United States, as well as the  
conftitutions and rights of the individual ftates,  
againit errors of judgment, irregularities of the  
paflions, or other encroachments of human in-  
firmity, or more reprehenfible enterprize, in the  
executive on one hand, or the more immediate  
reprefentatives of the people on the other.  
  
Thefe confiderations will all confpire to ani-  
mate me in my future courfe, with a confident  
reliance, that as far as my conduét fhall be uni-  
formly meafured by the conftitution of the Unit-  
ed States, and faithfully direéted to the public  
good, I fhall be fupported by the fenate, as well  
as by the houfe of reprefentatives and the people  
at large; and on no other conditions ought any  
fupport at all to be expected or defired.  
  
With cordial wifhes for your honour, health,  
and happinefs, and fervent prayers for,a conti-  
yuation of the virtues, liberties, profperity and  
peace of our beloved country, | avail myfelf of

In Senatt »f the United States,   
February IJ, 1797- \
On request, the Vice Preftdent of the United «  
States being excufcd from further attendance in Se­  
nate during the feffian, addressed them as follows:  
Gentlemen of the Senate,  
If, in the general apprehension of an intention to ,  
retire in that most eminent citizen, to whom all „  
eyes had been directed and all hearts attracted, as a  
the center of our union for so long a period ; the &quot;

generally united ; as soon as 1 read that excellent t,  
address which announced the neceflity of delibera- J  
tion in the choice of a President, I should hare imi- 1  
tated the example of a chara£ter, with-which I had !&#x27;&#x27;  
co-operated, though in less conspicuous and im- c  
portant stations, and maintained an uninterrupted z  
friendfhip for two and twenty years. But as anum- t  
ber of chara&amp;ers appeared to stand in the general &#x27;  
estimation, so nearly on i level, as to render it dif- L  
ficult to on which the majority would &#x27;j  
fall; considering the relation in which I flood to 1 c  
the people of America, 1 thought it most refpeift- i  
ful ko them, and most conducive to the tranquility J  
•f the public mind to resign mylelf with others, a j &#x27;  
silent fpeftatorof the general deliberation and apis- ■   
five fubjeft of public difeufiions.  
Deeply penetrated with gratitude to my coun- &#x27; I  
trymen in general, for their long continued kind- ! &#x27;  
ness to me, and for that fteadjf and affe£ling con- ; &#x27;  
fidence, with which those who have moll intimately \
known me, from early life, have on so many great &#x27; t  
occasions, entrulled to me, the eare of their dear- &gt;  
eft interests ; since a majority of their ele&amp;ois, tho&#x27;  
a very small one, have declared in my favor, and  
since, in a republican government, the majority  
though ever so small rauft of neceflity decide, I  
have determined at every hazard of a high but just  
Tefpontibility, though with much anxiety and  
diffidence, more to engage in their service.—  
Their confidence which has been the chief consola­  
tion of my life, is too precious and fa-.-red a depo­  
litever to be considered lightly. As it has been  
founded onlv on the t4ie heart, ir never  
has hcep, it never can be, deceived, betrayed, or  
forfeited by me.  
It is with reluctance, and with all those emoti­  
ons of g&#x27;atitude and affeftiun, which a long expe  
rienee i f your goodness ought to inspire that I now  
retire from my feat in this House and take my  
leave of the members of the Senate.  
I ought not to declare, for the last time, your  
adjournment, before 1 have prefented&#x27;to every Sena­  
tor prefeut, and to every ciuzen who has ever been  
a Senator of the United my thanks, for  
the candor and favor invariably received from them  
all. It is a recolledtion, of which nothing can ever  
deprive me, and it will ba a source of comfort to,,  
v«r&gt;e, through the remainder of my life, that, as on  
the one hand, in a government cotrllituted like ours,  
I have for eight years held the second situation un  
der the constitution of the United States, in perfefl  
and uninterrupted harmony with the fii ft, without  
envy in one, or jealoufv in the other : fa un the  
other hand I have never had the fmallelt mifunder­  
-1 Handing with any member of the Senate. In all  
the aullrufe queftt&#x27;ons, difficult conjun&amp;ures, dan­  
gerous emergencies, and animated debates upon the  
great intcrefts of our country, which have so often  
anii.fo deeply impressed all our minds, and interest­  
ed the strongest feelings of the heart, I   
perienccd a uniform politeness and refpe&amp; fro»i  
every quarter of the house. When questions of  
Ho leL importance than difficulty, have produced  
H difference offentiment (and differences of opinion  
will always be found in free affemoiies of men, and  
probably the greatefl diversities upon the grcateft  
questions) when the Senators have been e­  
qually divided, and my opinion has been demand­  
ed according to, the constitution, I have constantly  
found, iw that moiety of the Senators, from whose  
judgment I have been ohliged to uiffent a difpofi  
tioa to allow me the fame freedom of deliberation  
ano independence of judgment which they asserted  
for themfelvei.&#x27;  
Within thtfe walls, for a course of years, I have  
been an admiring witness of a lucceflion of infor­  
mation, eloquence, patriotism and independence,  
which, at they would have done honor t» any Se­  
nate in any age, afford a cbnfolatory (if the  
Legislatures of the States are equally careful in  
their future selections, which there is no reason to  
diftrbfl) that no council morr permament than this  
a« a branch us the Legislature will be necessary, to  
defend the rights, liberties and properties of the  
people, and to protedl the constitution of the Uni­  
ted States as well as the conffituticirs and rights of  
the individual Rates, against errors of judgment, ir­  
regularities of the passions, or other encroachments  
of human infirmity or more reprehensible enter­  
prize, in the executive on on* hand or the more im­  
mediate representatives of the people on the other.  
Tbefe conliderations will all conspire to animate  
me in my future courfj, with a confident teliance,  
tuat as far as my conduct lhall be uniformly measur­  
ed by the Constitution of the United States and  
faithfully diretled to the public good, I (hall be (up­

prcittntiiinei and the people at large; and ea 00 uther  
  
conditions any support at all to be expe&amp;ed  
or deliied.  
With cardial wilhes for your honor, health and u»  
happiness, and fervent .prayers for a continuation tic  
of the virtue*, liberties, prosperity and peace of our ha  
beloved country, I avail myfelf of your leave of *b- m

WHERE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR THIS PAPER; ADVERTISEMENTS, AND ARTICLES OF INTELLIGENCE ARE THANKFULLY RECEIVED, ¢  
  
Vol. XLl.—Numb. 2102.]  
  
.. FEDERAL  
Legislative Sketches.  
Inthe SENATE of the UNITED}  
STATES, Feb. 15, 1797.  
ON request of the Vice-PrEsi­  
pen T of the United States, be­  
ing excused from further, attendance  
in Senate during the feflion, he ad­  
dressed them as follows :— e  
GENFLEMEN OF THE SewvaTeE,  
If, in the general apprehension of  
an intention to retire in that motft e­  
minent citizen, to whom al! eyes had  
been direfted and all hescts attra&amp;ted,  
as the centre of our union for so long  
a period ; the public opinion had  
exhibited any clear indications of a­  
nother, in whom our fellow citizens  
could have generally united ; as soon  
as [ read that excellent address which  
announced the neceflity of delibera­  
tion in the choice of a President, I  
should have imitated the example of  
a charater, with which [ had co­  
operated, tho’ in less conspicuous and  
importar# stations, and maintained  
an vninterrupted friend(hip for two  
and twenty years ; but as a number  
of chara&amp;ters appeared to stand in the  
general estimation so nearly on a le­  
vel, as to render it difficult to con­  
jeture on which the majority would  
fall ; considering the relation in  
which I stood to the people of Ame­  
rica, I thought it most refpe@ful to  
them, and most conducive to the  
tranquility of the public mind to re­  
sign myfelf with others, a silent spec­  
tator of the genral deliberation, and  
a paflive fubje&amp; of public difcuflion.  
Deeply penetrated with gratitude  
to my countrymen in general, for  
their long continued kindness to me,  
and for that steady and affe&amp;ing  
confidence, with which those who  
have most intimately known me from  
early life, have on so many great oc­  
casions, entiufted to me the care of  
their dearer interests ; since a majo­  
rity of their ele®ors, though a very  
small one, have declared in my fa­  
vor, and since, in a republican go­  
vernment, the majority though ever  
so small must of neceflity decide, I  
have determiined at every hazard of a  
high but just responsibility, though  
with much anxiety and diffidence,  
once more to engage in their service.  
~Their confidence which has been  
the chief consolation of my life, is  
too precious and sacred a deposit ev­  
er to be considered lightly. As it has  
been foonded only on the qualities of  
the heart, it never has been, it never­  
can be, deceived, betrayed, or dis­  
united by me. :  
&quot;It is with relutance, and with all  
those emotions of gratitude and af­  
fe&amp;tion, which a long experience of  
your goodness ought to inspire that I  
now retire from my feat in this  
house, ‘and take my leave of the  
.members of the Senate.  
1 ought not to declare, for the last  
time, your adjournment, before I  
have presented to every senator pre­  
sent, and to every senator of the U­  
nited States, my thanks, for the can­  
dor and favorinvariably received from  
them alli’ ‘lt is a recolle&amp;®ion, of  
which nothing can ever deprive me,  
and it will be a source Of‘dcomf(;rt to  
me, throvgh the remainder of m  
liﬁ’,;ghat?gs on the one hand, in i  
government conftitnted like.?lrs,_l  
have for eight years held the second  
situation under the constitution of  
“tHe United States in p’e,q&amp; ‘and un­  
interrupted harmony with the ﬁ&quot;f}’  
without envy in one, or jealousy in  
the other, so on the other hand I  
have never had the smallest misun­  
derstanding with any member of the  
Senate. In all the abstruse questions,  
difficult conjunétures, dangerovs e­  
mergencies, and animated *debates  
» npon the great interests of our coun­  
try, which have so often, so deeply  
imnprefled all our minds, I have ex­  
perienced a uniform politeness and  
refpe@ from every quarter of the  
house. When questions of no less im­  
portance than difficulty, have produ.-  
ced a difference of-fentiment (and  
“differences of apinion will always be  
- found in free assemblies of men, and  
probably the greatest diversities upon  
; g‘.ﬂm*qndﬁom) when the Se­  
nators have been equally divided,  
and my op&#x27;nion has. &#x27;\Qgen. demanded  
‘according to the conflitution, I have  
  
et Hampshive Gasetic.  
  
conftafitly found, in that moiety of  
the Senators, from whose judgment  
I have been obliged to diflent a dis­  
position to allow me the fame free­  
dom of deliberation and indepen­  
dence of judgment which they afler­  
ted for themselves.  
Within these walls, for a course of  
years I have been an admiring witness  
of a fucceflion of information, elo­  
quence, pattiotifm and independence  
wiiich, as they would have done ho­  
nor to any Senate in any age afford  
a consolatory hope (if the legislatures  
of the States are equally careful in  
their future feleétions, which there  
is no reason to distrust) that nocoun­  
cil more permanent than this as a  
branch of the legiflarure will be ne­  
ceflary, to defend the rights, liberties  
and properties of the people and to  
protedt the constitution of the United  
States as well as the constitutions and  
rights of the individual states, againit  
errors of judgment, irregularities of  
the passions, or other encroachments  
of human iafirmity or more repre­  
hensible enterprize, in the executive  
on one hand or the more immediate  
representatives of the people on the  
other.  
These considerations will all con­  
spire to animate me in my future  
courfe,with a confident reliance, that  
as far as my condu&amp; shall be uniform­  
ly measured by the constitution of  
the United States and fsithfully di­  
redted to the public good, I shall be  
supported by the Senate as well as  
by the house of representatives and  
the people at large ; and on no other  
conditions ought any support at all  
to be expeted or desired.  
With cordial wishes for your hon.  
or, health and happiness, and fervent  
prayers for a dontinuation of the vir­  
tues, liberties, prosperity and peace  
of our beloved country, I avail my­  
felf of your leave of absence for the
