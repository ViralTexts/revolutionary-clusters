t this pretended abolition is complete and universal; extending not only to every species of civil, but even to criminal causes. To argue with respect to the latter, would, however, be as vain and fruitless, as to attempt the serious proof of the existence of matter, or to demonstrate any of those propositions which by their own internal evidence force conviction, when expressed in language adapted to convey their meaning.  
With regard to civil causes, subtleties almost too contemptible for refutation, have been adopted to countenance the surmise that a thing, which is only not provided for, is entirely abolished. Every man of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between silence and abolition. But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to support it by certain legal maxims of interpretation, which they have perverted from their true meaning, it may not be wholly useless to explore the ground they have taken.  
The maxims on which they rely are of this nature, “a specificatio

ury in certain cases is an interdiction of it in others.  
A power to constitute courts, is a power to prescribe the mode of trial; and consequently, if nothing was said in the constitution on the subject of juries, the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt that institution, or to let it alone. This discretion in regard to criminal causes is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in all such cases; but it is of course left at large in relation to civil causes, there being a total silence on this head.

.  
Having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made of them, let us endeavour to ascertain their proper use and true meaning. This will be best done by examples. The plan of the convention declares that the power of congress or in other words of the national legislature, shall extend to certain enumerated cases. This specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority; because an affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd as well as useless, if a general authority was intended.  
In like manner, the judicial authority of the federal judicatures, is declared by the constitution to comprehend certain cases particularly specified. The expression of those cases marks the precise limits beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their jurisdiction; because the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, the specification would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of more extensive authority.  
These examples might be sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned, and designate the manner in which they should be used.

 Add to this that admiralty causes, and almost all those which are of equity jurisdiction are determinable under our own government without the intervention of a jury, and the inference from the whole will be that this institution, as it exists with us at present, cannot possibly be affected to any great extent by the proposed alteration in our system of government.  
The friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing else, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury: Or if there is any difference between them, it consists in this; the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty, the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government. For my own part, the more the operation of the institution has fallen under my observation, the more reason I have discovered for holding it in high estimation; and it would be alto

s all are satisfied of the utility of the institution, and of its friendly aspect to liberty. But I must acknowledge that I cannot readily discern the inseparable connection between the existence of liberty and the trial by jury in civil cases. Arbitrary impeachments, arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offences, and arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial despotism; and these have all relation to criminal proceedings. The trial by jury in criminal cases, aided by the habeas corpus act, seems therefore to be alone concerned in the question. And both of these are provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention.

n have no influence upon the legislature, in regard to the amount of the taxes to be laid, to the objects upon which they are to be imposed, or to the rule by which they are to be apportioned. If it can have any influence therefore, it must be upon the mode of collection, and the conduct of the officers entrusted with the execution of the revenue laws.  
As to the mode of collection in this state, under our own constitution, the trial by jury is in most cases out of use. The taxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of distress and sale, as in cases of rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands, that this is essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws. The dilatory course of a trial at law to recover the taxes imposed on individuals, would neither suit the exigencies of the public, nor promote the convenience of the citizens. It would often occasion an accumulation of costs, more burthensome than the original sum of the tax to be levied.

The sheriff who is the summoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks of courts who have the nomination of special juries, are themselves standing officers, and acting individually, may be supposed more accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges, who are a collective body.

There is an appeal of course from one jury to another till there have been two verdicts out of three on one side.  
From this sketch it appears, that there is a material diversity as well in the modification as in the extent of the institution of trial by jury in civil cases in the several states; and from this fact, these obvious reflections flow. First, that no general rule could have been fixed upon by the convention which would have corresponded with the circumstances of all the states; and secondly, that more, or at

Hamilton wrote, ‘ that admiralty causes, and almost all those which are  
of equity jurisdiction, are determinable, under our own government, with-  
out the intervention of a jury ; and the inference from the whole will be,  
that this institution, as it exists with us at present, cannot possibly be af-

ernment.” ‘How far the right to atrial by jury was interfere 1d with, by the

In the 83d number of the Federalist, Mr. Hamilton uses the  
following language: “ In like manner, the authority of the fede-  
ral judic atures is declared by the Constitution to comprehend  
certain cases particularly specified. The expression of those  
cases marks the precise limits beyond which the federal courts  
  
cannot extend their jurisdiction ; because the objects of their cog-

if it did not exclude all ideas of more extensive authority.

The same distinction in respect to the  
utility of the jury trial in civil and  
criminal cases was taken by one of the  
authors of Zhe Federalist: “1 must  
acknowledge that I cannot readily dis-  
cern the inseparable connection between  
the existence of liberty and the trial by  
jury in civil cases. Arbitrary impeach-  
ments, arbitrary methods of prosecuting  
pretended offences, and arbitrary pun-  
ishments upon arbitrary convictions,  
have ever appeared to me to‘be the  
great engines of judicial despotism ; and  
these have all relation to criminal pro-  
ceedings. The trial by jury in criminal  
cases, aided by the Habeas Corpus Act,  
seems therefore to be alone concerned in  
the question.” So likewise De Tocque-  
ville—a warm supporter of trial by  
jury in criminal cases—declares in his  
Democracy in America that “if it was  
my purpose to inquire how far trial by  
jury, especially in civil cases, ensures a  
good administration of justice, I admi
