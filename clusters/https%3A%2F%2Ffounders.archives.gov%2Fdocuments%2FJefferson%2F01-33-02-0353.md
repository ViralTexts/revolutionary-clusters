at home &amp; abroad, and the confidence of my fellow citizens [drawing on us], will be equal to these objects. but there is another branch of duty, which I must meet with courage too, tho’ I cannot without pain; that is the appointments &amp; disappointments as to office. Madison &amp; Gallatin being still absent, we have not yet decided on our rule of conduct as to these. that some ought to be removed from office, &amp; that all ought not, all mankind will agree. but where to draw the line perhaps no two will agree. consequently nothing like a general approbation on this subject can be looked for. some principles have been the subject of conversation but not of determination e.g. 1. all appointments to civil offices during pleasure, made after the event of the election was certainly known to mr A. are considered as nullities. I do not view the persons appointed as even candidates  for the office, but make others without noticing or notifying them. mr A’s best friends have agreed this is right. 2. officers who have been guilty of official mal-conduct are proper subjects of removal. 3. good men, to whom there is no objection but a difference of political principle, practised only as far as the right of a private citizen will justify, are not proper subjects of removal, except in the case of Attornies &amp; Marshals. the courts being so decidedly federal, &amp; irremovable, it is believed that republican Attornies &amp; Marshals, being the doors of entrance into the courts, are indispensably necessary as a shield to the republican part of our fellow citizens, which I believe is the main body of the people. these principles are yet to be considered of, and I sketch them to you in confidence. not that there is objection to your [mooting?] them as subjects of conversation &amp; as proceeding from yourself, but not as matters of executive determination. nay further I will thank you for your own sentiments &amp; those of othe

Hamilton, and all “the Essex men,” and “the desperadoes of the

said  
&quot;But there is another branch of duty  
which I must meet with courage too,  
though I cannot without pain ; that is,  
the appointments and disappointments  
as to offices. Madison and Gallatin be­  
ing stilt absent, we have not yet decid­  
ed ou our rules of conduct as&#x27; to these.  
That some ought to be removed from  
office, and that all ought not, all man­  
kind will agree. But where to draw  
the line, perhaps no two will agree .  
Consequently, nothing like a geueral  
approbation on &#x27; this subject can be  
looked for. Some principles have been  
the subject of conversation, but not of  
determination; e. g. 1. all appoint­  
meutsto civil offices during pleasure,  
made after the event of the election  
was certainly known to Mr. Adams,  
are considered as nullities. I do not  
view the persons- appointed as even  
candidates for the office, but make  
others without noticing or notifying  
them. Mr. Adams&#x27; best friends have  
agreed &quot;US IS right. &#x27;I. (Jmcei&#x27;S who

of a private cilizeu will justify, are not  
proper subjecia of removal, &quot;except in  
the case of attorneys and marshals.  
The courts being so decidedly federal  
and irremovable, it is believed that re­  
publican (democratic) attorneys and  
marshals, being the doors of entrance  
into the courts, are indispensably nee  
essary as a shield to the republican  
(democratic) part of our fellowciti-xen-,  
which, I believe, is the main  
body of the people. These principles  
are yet to be considered of, and I sketch  
them to you in confidence. Not that  
there is objection to your mooting  
them as subjects of conversation, and  
as proceeding from yourself, but not  
as matters of executive determination.&quot;

“The courts being so decidedly federal and irremovable, it  
is believed that republican attorneys and marshals, being the
