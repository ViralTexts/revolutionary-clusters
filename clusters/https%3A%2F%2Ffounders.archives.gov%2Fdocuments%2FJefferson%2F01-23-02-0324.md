the midst of a number of others, every one of which relates to states in their separate capacity. Will not plain common sense then understand it, like the rest of it’s context, to relate to states in their separate capacities?  
But if the phrase of one for 30,000. is only meant to give the aggregate of representatives, and not at all to influence their apportionment among the states, then, the 120 being once found, in order to apportion them, we must recur to the former rule which does it according to the numbers of the respective states; and we must take the nearest common divisor, as the ratio of distribution, that is to say, that divisor which, applied to every state, gives to them such numbers as, added together, come nearest to 120. This nearest common ratio will be found to be 28,858. and will distribute 119. of the 120 members, leaving only a single residuary one. It will be found too to place 96,648 fractional numbers in the 8. Northernmost states, and 105,582 in the 7. Southernmost. The following table shews it:

Whatever may have been the intention, the effect of rejecting the nearest divisor, (which leaves but one residuary member) and adopting a distant one (which leaves eight) is merely to take a member from New York and Pensylvania each, and give them to Vermont and New Hampshire.

, that of the bill incurs many and grievous ones.  
  
1. If you permit the large fraction in one state to chuse a representative for one of the small fractions in another state, you take from the latter it’s election, which constitutes real representation, and substitute a virtual representation of the disfranchised fractions: and the tendency of the doctrine of virtual representation has been too well discussed and appreciated by reasoning and resistance, on a former great occasion, to need development now.  
2. The bill does not say that it has given the residuary representatives to the greatest fractions; tho’ in fact it has done so. It seems to have avoided establishing that into a rule, lest it might not suit on another occasion. Perhaps it may be found the next time more convenient to distribute them among the smaller states; at another time among the larger states; at other times according

es that representatives shall be apportioned among the states according to their numbers, i.e. by some common ratio.  
  
Viewing this bill either as a violation of the constitution, or as giving an inconvenient exposition to it’s words, is it a case wherein the President ought to interpose his negative? I think it is.  
  
1. The Non-user of his negative begins already to excite a belief that no President will ever venture to use it: and consequently has begotten a desire to raise up barriers in the state legislatures against Congress throwing off the controul of the constitution.  
2. It can never be used more pleasingly to the public, than in the protection of the constitution.  
3. No invasions of the constitution are so fundamentally dangerous as the tricks played on their own numbers, apportionment, and other circumstances respecting themselves, and affecting their legal qualifications to legislate for the Union.  
4. The majorities by which this bill has been carried (to wit of 1.  in the Senate, and 2. in the Representatives) shew how divided the opinions were there.  
5. The whole of both houses admit the constitution will bear the other exposition, whereas the minorities in both deny it will bear that of the bill.  
6. The application of any one ratio is intelligible to the people, and will therefore be approved: whereas the complex operations of this bill will never be comprehended by them, and tho’ they may acquiesce, they cannot approve what they do not understand.

whole union. Suppose it may. As a matter of fact,  
what was the idea of the framers of the Constitution?  
What was the common and generally accepted notion from  
the beginning of the debate until it was found that by  
accepting some other idea an advantage could be gotten  
under the scheme of apportionment for certain states and  
sections?  
  
But, even if we allow that the 30,000 is meant to give the  
aggregate of representatives and not at all to influence their  
apportionment, the bill still does not distribute the 120  
according to the constitutional rule; that is, according to  
the numbers of the respective states, for in order to make  
the apportionment we must take the nearest common divisor  
as the ratio of distribution; that is to say, that divisor  
which, applied to every state, gives to them such numbers  
  
as added together comes nearest to 120.*  
This nearest common ratio will be found to be 28,858 and  
  
will distribute 119 of the 120 members, leaving only a single  
residuary one. It will be found to place 96,648 fractional

Whatever may have been the intention, the effect of re-  
jecting the nearest divisor which leaves but one residuary  
member and adopting another one which leaves eight, is  
merely to take a member from New York and Pennsylvania  
each and to give them to Vermont and New Hampshire.

more than that in the other seven states. Moreover, if you  
permit the large fractions in one state to choose a repre-  
sentative for one of the small fractions in another state, you  
take from the latter its election, which constitutes real rep-  
resentation, and substitute a virtual representation of the  
disfranchised fractions. There is still another point which  
ought not to be lost sight of, in that the bill does not say  
distinctly that it gives an additional representative to the  
states having the eight largest fractions, though in fact it  
has done so. It seems to have avoided establishing that  
into a rule lest it might not suit on another occasion. Some

understand. So that if we regard the bill either as a viola-  
tion of the Constitution, which it seems to be, or as giving  
merely an inconvenient and difficult interpretation to its  
words, it is a case wherein the President ought to interpose  
his veto, and that for the following reasons:  
  
1. The non-user of his negative begins already to excite  
the belief that no president will ever venture to use it.  
This has consequently begotten a desire to raise up barriers  
in the state legislatures against Congress throwing off the  
control of the Constitution.  
  
2. The veto can never be used more pleasingly to the  
public than in protecting the Constitution.
