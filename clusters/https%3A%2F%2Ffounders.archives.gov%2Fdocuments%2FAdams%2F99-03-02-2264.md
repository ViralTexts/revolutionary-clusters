Letter 8.  
My Dear Son.  
St: Petersburg 21 March 1813.  
  
I have promised you in my former letters to state the particulars in which I deemed the Christian dispensation to be an improvement or perfection of the Law delivered from Sinai considered as including a system of morality—But before I come to this point, it is proper to remark upon the moral character of the Books of the Old Testament, subsequent to those of Moses. Some of these are Historical—Some Prophetical—Some Poetical, and two may be considered as peculiarly of the Moral Class; one of them being an affecting Dissertation upon the Vanity of human life, and the other a collection of Moral Sentences under the name of Proverbs.  
I have already observed that the great, immovable and eternal foundation of the superiority of Scriptural Morals, to all other morality, was the idea of God, disclosed in them, and only in them—The Unity of God, His Omnipotence, His Righteousness, His Mercy, and the Infinity of all his Attributes, are marked in every line of the Old Testament in characters which nothing less than blindness can fail to discern, and nothing less than fraud can misrepresent—This Conception of God, served as a basis for the Piety of his Worshippers, which was of course incomparably more rational and more profound, than it was possible that Piety could be, which adored “Devils for Deities,” or even than that Piety of Philosophers like Socrates, and Plato and Cicero, who with purer, and more exalted ideas of the Divine Natures than the Rabble and the Poets, still considered the existence of any God at-all as a question upon which they could form no decided opinion—You have seen that even Cicero believed that the only solid foundation of all human Virtue was Piety; and it was impossible that a Piety so far transcending that of all other Nations, should not contain in its consequences, a system of moral Virtue, equally transcendent.  
The first of the Ten Commandants was that the Jewish People, should never admit the idea of any other God—the object of the second, third and fourth Commandments was merely to impress with greater force the obligation of the first, and to obviate the tendencies and temptations which might arise to its being neglected or disregarded—throughout the whole law the same injunction is continually renewed—All the rites and Ceremonies were adapted to root it deeper into the heart and Soul of the chosen People—That the Lord Jehovah was to be forever the sole and exclusive object of Love, Reverence and Adoration, unbounded as His own Nature was the principle that pervaded every letter of the Law, and the whole Bible is but a commentary upon it, and corollary from it.  
The law was given not merely in the form of Commandment from God, but in that of a Covenant, or compact, between the Supreme Creator and the Jewish People—It was sanctioned by the blessing and the Curse, pronounced upon Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, in the presence of the whole People, Men, Women, Children and Strangers, and by the solemn acceptance of the whole People, responding Amen, to every one of the Curses denounced for violation, on their part of the Covenant.  
From that day untill the Birth of Christ, (a period of about 1500 years) the Historical Books of the Old Testament, are no-more than a simple record of the fulfillment of the Covenant, in all its blessings and all its Curses, exactly adapted to the fulfillment or the transgression of its duties by the People.—The Nation was governed first by Joshua under the express appointment of God—then by a succession of Judges, and afterwards by a double line of kings, untill conquered and carried into captivity by the kings of Assyria and of Babylon—Seventy years afterwards restored again to their Country, their Temple and their Laws, and again conquered by the Romans, and ruled by their tributary kings, and by Proconsuls—Through all these vicissitudes and Varieties of Fortune, they never complied with the duties to which they had bound themselves by the Covenant, without being loaded with the blessings promised on Mount Gerezim; and never departed from them without being afflicted with the some of the Curses denounced upon Mount Ebal—The Prophetical Books are themselves Historical; for Prophecy is in the strictest sense no more than History related before the Event. But the Jewish Prophets of whom there was a succession almost constant, from the time of Joshua to that of Christ, were Messengers specially commissioned by God to warn the People of their duty and to foretell the punishments which awaited their Transgressions; and finally to keep alive by unintermitted prediction the expectation of the Messiah, the seed of Abraham, in whom all the families of the Earth should be blessed.  
With this conception of the Divine Nature, so infinitely surpassing that of any other Nation, with this system of moral virtue, so indissolubly blended, as by the eternal Constitution of things it must be blended with Piety; with this uninterrupted series of Signs &amp; Wonders, Prophets and Seers, miraculous interpositions of the omnipotent Creator, to preserve and vindicate the Truth, it is lamentable; but to those who know the Nature of Man it is not surprizing to find that the Jewish History is little else than a Narrative of the idolatries and Corruptions of the Israelites and of their Monarchs—That the very People who had heard the voice of God from Mount Sinai, should within forty days compel Aaron to make a golden calf, and worship that as “the Gods who had brought them out of Egypt”—that the very Solomon, the wisest of mankind, to whom God had twice revealed himself in visions, the sublime dedicator of the Temple, the witness in presence of the whole People of the fire from Heaven, which consumed the offerings upon the altar, and of the glory of the Lord that filled the house; that he in his old age, “beguiled by fair idolatresses” should have fallen from the worship of the ever blessed Jehovah, to that of Ashtoroth, and Mikom, and Chemosh, and Molech; the “Abominations” of all the petty tribes in the neighbourhood of Judea; that Baal, and Dagon, and Miplezeth, and Rimmon, and Nisroch, and the Sun, Moon, Planets and the all the Host of Heaven—That the Mountains and the Plains—Every high-place and every grove should have swarmed with idols to corrupt the hearts and debase the Souls of a People favoured of Heaven so highly, the elect of almighty God, may be among the mysteries of divine Providence, which it is not given to mortality to explain, but is unaccountable only to those who presume to demand why it has pleased the Supreme Arbiter of Events to create such a being as Man?  
Observe however that amidst all the varieties of destiny, which that Nation underwent, amidst the atrocious Crimes, with which they so often polluted themselves, through all their Servitudes, their Dismemberments, their Captivities, and their transmigrations, the divine light which had been imparted exclusively to them was never extinguished. The Law delivered from Sinai was preserved in all its purity—The Histories, which attested its violations and its accomplishments were recorded and never lost—The Writings of the Prophets of David and of Solomon, all inspired with the same idea of the Godhead, and the same intertwinement of religion and Morality, and the same anticipation of the divine Emmanuel, the God with us, survived all the changes of Government and of Constitution which befell the People—the Pillar of Cloud by Day and the Pillar of fire by Night—the Law and the Prophets, eternal in their Nature, followed went before them, unsullied and unimpaired, through all the Ruins, of Rebellion and Revolution, of Conquest and Dispersion, of War—Pestilence and Famine—The Assyrian, Babylonian and Egyptian Empires, Tyre and Sidon, Thenicia, Carthage and  all the other Nations of Antiquity, rose and fell in their Religious Institutions, at the same time as in their Laws and their Governments—It was the practice of the Romans, when they besieged a City to invite its Gods to come over to them—They considered the Gods as Summer Friends ready to desert their votaries in the hour of their Calamity, or as Traitors ready to sell them for a bribe. They had no higher opinion of their own Gods, than of the Stranger Deities, whom as Gibbon said they were always ready to admit to the freedom of the City—All the Gods of the Heathens have perished with their Makers, for where upon the face of the globe, could now be found the human being who believes in any one of them?—So much more deep and strong was the hold which the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob took of upon the Imagination and Reason of Mankind, that I might almost invert the question, and ask where is to be found the human being believing the existence of any God, at all, and not believing in him?  
The Moral Character of the Old Testament then is that Piety to God is the foundation of all Virtue, and that Virtue is inseparable from it—But that Piety without the practice of Virtue is itself a crime, and an aggravation of all iniquity—All the Virtues which were recognized by the Heathens are inculcated not only with more authority but with more energy of argument and more eloquent persuasion in the Bible than in all the writings of the antient Moralists—In one of the apocryphal Books—(Wisdom of Solomon VIII.7.) the Cardinal Virtues are expressly named—“And if a man love righteousness, her labours are virtues: for she teacheth Temperance, and Prudence, Justice and Fortitude; which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in their life”—The Book of Job, whether to be considered as a History or an Allegorical Parable, was written to teach the lessons of Patience under Affliction, of Resignation under divine Chastisement, of undoubting Confidence in the Justice and Goodness of God, under every possible Calamity, and of inflexible adherence to integrity under every temptation or provocation to depart from it—The morality of the Apocryphal Books is generally the same as that of the inspired Writers, excepting that in some of them there is more stress laid upon the minor objects of the Law, and the merely formal ordinances of police, and less continual recurrence to the weightier matters—The Book of Eccliasticus however contains more Wisdom and more useful Instruction than all the sayings of the seven Grecian Sages put together—  
It was upon this foundation, that the more perfect system of Christian Morality was to be raised. But I must defer the Consideration of this to my next Letter. In the meantime, as I have urged that the Scriptural idea of God is the foundation of all perfect Virtue, and that it is totally different from the idea of God, conceived by any other Antient Nation, I would recommend it to you in perusing hereafter the Scriptures, to meditate often upon the expressions by which they mark the character of the Deity, and to reflect upon the duties to him and to your fellow mortals, which follow by inevitable induction from them—That you may have an exact idea of the Opinions of the Antient heathen Philosophers concerning God, or rather the Gods, study Cicero’s Dialogues Da Natura Deorum, and read the Abbé Olivet’s Remarks on the Theology of the Grecian Philosophers, annexed to his Translation

I promised you, in my last letters, to state the  
particulars in which I deemed the Chistian dispen  
sation to be an improvement or perfection of the  
law delivered at Sinai, considered as including a  
system of morality; but before I come to this point,  
it is proper to remark upon the character of the  
books of the Old Testament subsequent to those of  
Moses. Some are historical, some prophetical, and  
some poetical, and two may be considered as pe.  
culiarly of the moral class--one being an affecting  
dissertation upon the vanity of human life, and an  
other a collection of moral sentences under the  
name of Proverbs. I have already observed that  
the great immovable and eternal foundation of the  
saperiority of Scripture morals to all other morali  
ty, was the idea of God disclosed in them and only  
in them: the unity of God. His omnipotence, His  
righteousness. His mercy, and the infinity of His  
attributes, are marked in every line of the Old Tes  
tament in characters which nothing less than blind­  
ness can fail to discern, and nothing less than frand  
can misrepresent. This conception of God serving  
as a basis for the piety of His worshipers, was of  
course incomparably more rational and more pro  
found than it was possible that sentiiment could be  
which adored Devils for deities, or even that of  
philosophers like Socrates, Plato and Cicero, who,  
with purer and more exalted ideas of the Divine na.  
ture than the rabble of the Poets, still considered the  
existence of any God at all as a question upon  
which they could form no decided opinion. You  
have seen that even Cicero believed the only solid  
foundation of all human virtue to be piety; and it  
was impossible that a piety so far transcending  
that of all other nations should not contain in its  
consequences a system of moral virtue equally  
transcendent. The first of the ten cornmandments  
was that the Jewish people should never admit  
the idea of any other God- the object of the second,  
third and fourth was merely to impress with greater  
force the obligation of the first, and to obviate the  
tendencies and temptations which might arise  
to its being neglected, or disregarded. Throughout  
the whole law the same injunctions aris continually  
renewed, all the rites and ceremonies were adapt  
ed to root deeper into the hearts and souls of the  
chosen people that the Lord Jehovala was to be  
forever the sole and exclusive object of love.  
Reverence and adoration, unbounded as His own  
nature was the principle; every letter off the Law,  
and the whole Bible is but a comments ry upon it,  
and corollary from it. The law war given not  
merely in the form of a commandment from God,  
but in that of a covenant or compact b etween the  
Supreme Creator and the Jewish peop le; it was  
sanctioned by the blessing and the curse pronoun.  
ced upon Mount Gerizim and Mount Eb al in the  
presence of the whole Jewish people a nd stran.  
gers, and by the solemn acceptance of te whole  
people responding Amen to every one of the curses  
denounced for violation on their part of the Cove  
nant. From that day untit the birth of Christ, (a  
period of about 1,500 years) the historic al books of  
the Old Testament are no more than a simple  
record of the fulfiflment of the covemant, in all its  
blessings and curses, exactly adapt ad to the fulfill-  
ment or tranagression of its duties I y the people.  
The nation was first governed by Joshua, under  
the express appointment of God, t&#x27; aen by a succes.  
sion of judges, and afterward by a double line of  
kinge, until conquered and carricel into captivity  
by the kings of Assyria and He bylon: seventy  
years afterward restored to their country, their  
temple and their laws, and again conquered by  
the Romans, and ruled by their tribu tary kings and  
proconsuls. Yet, through all their vicissitudes of  
fortune, they never complied with the duties to  
which they had bound themselves by the covenant  
without being loaded with the blos sing promised  
on Mount Gerigim, and never departed from them  
without being afflicted with some off the curses de  
nounced upon Mount Ebal. The praphetical books  
are themselves historical--for p rephecy, in the  
atrictest sense, is no more than hi story related be  
fore the event, but the Jewish Pro phets, tof whom  
there was a succession almost co ustant from the  
time of Joshua to that of Christ,) w ere messengers,  
specially commissioned of God, to warn the people  
of their duty, to foretell the pur ishments which  
awaited their transgressions, and finally to keep  
alive by unintermitted prediction the expectation  
of the Messiah, &quot;the seed of At wraham, in whom  
all the families of the earth shou&#x27; d be blessed.&#x27;  
With this conception of the Divia e nature, so intt­  
nitely surpassing that of any ot er nation-with  
thisaystem of moral virtue, so indi rsolably blending  
as by the eternal constitution of things must be  
blended piety-with this uniater rupted series of  
signs and wonders, prophets and s cers, mtiraculour  
iterpositions of the Omnipotent Cr cator te preserve  
and vindicate the truth, it is lan rentable, but to  
those who know the nature of ma n, it is not sur  
prising to find the Jewish history li ttle else than a  
narrative of idolatries and corruption of the larael­  
ites and their monarchs, that the very people who  
had heard the voice of God fro mr. Momat Sinai,  
within forty days compel Aaron to make a golden  
calf and worship that as the &quot;God who brought  
them out of the land of Egypt,&quot; that the very  
Solomon, the wisest of mankind, to whom God had  
twice revealed himself in visions-the sublime hiee  
tator of the Temple, the witness, is the presence  
of the whole people, of the fire from Heaven which  
conaumed the offerings from the al ar, and of the  
glory of the Lord that filled the not ise-tnat ire, io  
his old age, beguiled by fair idol stresses, shouid  
have fallen from the worship of fI e ever-blessed  
Jehovah to that of Ashtaroth an d Milcom, Ac.  
the abomination of all the petty tri bes of Judea-  
that of Baal, and Dagon, Ae that the Sun, Moon and  
Planets, and all the host of Heaven- the mountains  
and plains, every high place, a o&#x27;l every grave  
should have swarmed with idols, to corrupt the  
hearts and debase the minds of a people so highly  
favored of Heaven--the elect oft he Almigh ty, may  
be among the mysteries of D ivine Pro ridence,  
which it is not given to mortality to explain, but as  
inadmissable only to those who roresume to de,  
mand why it has pleased the Supr eme arbiter of  
events to create such a being as man. Observe,  
bowever, that amid the atrociom a crimes which  
that sation so often polluted the nselves with-  
through all their servitudes, dismen iberments cap  
tivities and tranamigrations--the bit ine light which  
had been imparted exclusively to th sem, was never  
extinguished, the law delivered from sinal was  
preserved in all its purity, the hir ories which at  
tested its violations, and its accomp lishments were  
recorded and never lost. The y rritings of the  
prophets of David and Solomon, w ere all inspired  
with the same idea of the Godhead, the same inter.  
twinement of religion and moralit, o and the same  
anticipations of the Divine &quot;lmm anuel, the God  
with us.&quot; these survived all the o hanges of sov  
ernment and of constitutions which befell the peo,  
pler the pillar of cloud by day t and the pillar of  
fre by night,&quot;--the law and the p rophets, ctemnal  
in their nature-went before the m unsullied and  
unimpaired through all the rul nes of rebellion and  
revolation, of conquest and dist lersion of war, bes­  
mlence and famine. The Ar wyrian, Babylouian,  
and Egrptian empices. Tyre and sidon, Cartt agt  
and all the other nations of a ntiquity rose and sell  
in their religious institutions at the same time as in  
their law and governmer a it was the practice of  
the Romans when they besieged a city to invok e  
ts gods to come over to them; they considered the  
  
gode as Summer friends, ready to desert their vo  
taries in the hour of calamity or as traitors, ready  
to sell themaelves for a bribe, they had no higher es-  
mate of their own than of the stranger deities, whom.  
as Gibbon said- &quot;they were always ready to ad  
mit to the freedom of the city.&quot; All the gods  
the heathen have perished with their makers, for  
where on the face of the globe could now be found  
the being who believes in any one of them? So  
much more deep and strong was the hold which  
the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob took upon  
the imaginations and reason of mankind, that I  
might almost invert the question, and say. Where  
is the human being found believing in any God at  
all and not believing in Him? The moral charac  
ter of the Oll Testament, then, is, that piety to  
God is the foundation of all virtue, and that virtue  
is inseparable from it, but that piety without the  
practice of virtue is itself a crime and the argra  
vation of all iniquity. All the virtues which are  
here recognized by the heathen, are inculcated not  
only with more authority but with more energy  
argument and more eloquent persuasion in the  
Bible than in all the writings of the ancient mor  
alists. In one of the aprocryphal books, (Wisdom  
of Solomon,) the cardinal virtues are expresaly  
named: &quot;If any man love righteousness, her labors  
are virtue, for she teacheth temperance and pra  
dence and justice and fortitude,&quot; which are such  
things as men can have nothing more profitable  
in this life. The book of Job, whether considered  
as history or as an allegorical parable, was written  
to teach the lessons of patience in afflictions, of  
resignation under Divine chastisement, of un  
doubted confidence in the justice and goodness of  
God under every temptation or provocation to de  
part from it. The morality of the apocryphal  
books is generally the same as that of the inspired  
writers, except that in some of them there is more  
stress laid upon the minor objects of the law, and  
merely formal ordinances of police, and less con  
tinual recurrence to &quot;the weightier matters.&quot;  
The book of Ecclesiasticus, however, contains  
more wisdom than all the sayings of the seven  
Grecian Sages. It was upon this foundation that  
the more perfect system of Christian morality was  
to be raised.- But I must defer the consideration to  
my next letter. In the mean time as I have urged  
that the scriptural idea of God is the foundation of  
all perfect virtue, and that it is totally different  
from the idea of God conceived by any ancient  
nation, I should recommend it to you in pursuing  
the Scriptures hereafter to meditate often upon  
the expressions by which they mark the character  
of the Deity, and to reflect upon the duties to Him  
and to your fellow mortals which follow by inevi  
table deductions from them. That you may have an  
exact idea of the opinions of ancient heathen  
philosophers concerning God, or rather the gods  
study Cicero&#x27;s dialogues, and read the Abbe on  
vet&#x27;s remarks on the Theology of the Grecian Phi  
losophers, annexed to his translations

Extract from a letter of John Quincy Adams to his son, on the  
Bible and its teachings.  
  
‘‘T have already observed that the great immovable and eternal  
foundation of the superiority of Scripture morals to all other mo-  
rality, was the idea of God disclosed in them, and only in them ;  
the unity of God, his omnipotence, his righteousness, his mercy, and  
the infinity of his attributes, are marked in every line of the Old  
Testament in characters which nothing less than blindness can fail  
to discern, and nothing Jess than fraud can misrepresent. ‘This con-  
ception of God serving as a basis for the piety of his worshipers,  
was of course incomparably more rational and more profound, than  
it was possible that sentiment could be which adored devils for dei-  
ties, or even that of philosophers like Socrates, Plato and Cicero,  
who, with purer and more exalted ideas of the divine nature than  
the rabble of the poets, still considered the existence of any God at  
all as a question upon which they could form no decided opinion.  
You have seen that even Cicero believed the only solid foundation  
of all human virtue to be piety ; and it was impossible that a piety  
so far transcending that of all other nations, should not contain, in  
its consequences, a system of moral virtue equally transcendent.—  
The first of the Ten Commandments was, that the Jewish people  
should never admit the idea of any other God—the object of the se-  
cond, third and fourth was merely to impress with greater force the  
obligation of the first, and to obviate the tendencies and temptations  
which might arise from its being neglected or disregarded. Through-  
out the whole law the same injunctions are continually renewed; all  
the rites and ceremonies were adapted to root deeper into the hearts  
and souls of the chosen people, that the Lord Jehovah was to be for-  
ever the sole and exclusive object of love. Reverence and adoration,  
unbounded as his own nature, was the principle ; every letter of the  
law, and the whole Bible, is but a commentary upon it, and a co-  
rollary from it. The law was given not merely in the form of a  
commandment from God, but in that of a covenant or compact be-  
tween the Supreme Creator and the Jewish people; it was sanctioned  
by the blessing and the curse pronounced upon Mount Gerizim and  
Mount Ebal, in the presence of the whole Jewish people and stran-  
gers, and by the solemn acceptance of the whole people, responding  
amen to every one of the curses denounced for violation on their  
part of the covenant. From that day until the birth of Christ, (a  
period of about 1,500 years,) the historical books of the Old ‘Testa-

ment are no more than a simple record of the fulfilment of the co-  
venant, in all its blessings and curses, exactly adapted to the fulfil-  
ment or transgression of its duties by the people. ‘The nation was  
first governed by Joshua, under the express appointment of God ;  
then by a succession of judges, and afterward by a double line of ee  
kings, ‘until conquered and carried into captivity by the kings of st  
Assyria and Babylon ; seventy years afterward restored to their coun- .

tiato the teiidencus and temptations;  
which might arise to it - being negircteii. or  
Jisregardud. Throughout the whole law  
the same injunctions are eontinually re­  
newed; all the rites and ceremonies wt re  
adopted to root deeper into the hearts  
and souls of th,&#x27; chosen people that the  
Lord Jehovah was to be forever the sole  
and exclusive object of love. Reverence  
and aduraiion, unbounded as His ow n na­  
ture was tiie principle; every letter of th&quot;  
Law. and the whole Bible is but a com-  
&#x27;mentary upon it, and corollary from it. j  
The law was given not merely in the firm j  
of a commandment from God, but in that !  
of a covenant or compact between the &#x27;  
Supreme Creator and the Jewish people; it  
was sanctioned by the blessing and the  
curse pronounced upon Mount Geri.im  
and Mount Ebal, in the presence of the  
whole Jewish people and .strangers, and  
by the solemn acceptance of the whole  
people responding Amen to everyone of  
the curses denounced for violation on their j  
part of the Covenant. From that day uti- j  
til the birth of Christ, (a period of about  
1.500 years) the historical books of the  
Old Testament are no mote than a simple  
record of the fulfillment or transgression  
of its duties by tho people. The nation  
Was first governed by Joshua, under the  
express appointment of God; then by a  
succession of judges, and afterward by a  
double line of kings, until conquered and  
carried into captivity by the kings of As-  
syna ana Uanyion; seventy years aiter­  
Ward restored to their coUntrj, their tem-  
lc and their laws; and again conquered  
y the Romans, and ruled by their tribu­  
tary kings and proconsuls. Yct.through all  
their vicissitudes of fortune, they never  
Complied with the duties to which they had  
bound themselves by the covenant without  
being loaded with the blessing promised  
on Mount Gcrizim. and never departed  
from them without being atllictcd with  
some of the curses denounced upon Mt.  
Ebal. The prophetical books are them­  
selves historical for prophecy, in tho  
strictest sense, is no more than history re­  
lated before tho event; but the Jewish  
IVaphets, (of whom there was a succes­  
sion almost constant from the time of Josh­  
aato that of Christ.) wero messengers,  
specially commissioned of God, to warn  
tba people oftheir duty.to foretell the pun­  
ishments which awaited their transgres­  
sion, and finally to keep alive by unintcr­  
milted prediction the expectation of the  
Messiah, &quot;the seed of Abraham, in whom  
all the families of the earth should be  
blessed.&quot; With this conception of the  
Divine nature, so infinitely surpassing  
that of any other nation with this system  
of moral virtue, so indissolubly blending  
ts by the eternal constitution of things  
must be blended piety with this uninter

the law delivered at Sinai, considered as includ-  
ing a system of morality ; but beforé I come to  
this point, it is proper to temark apon the char-  
acter of the books of the Old Testament subse-  
quent to those of Moses. Some are historical, |  
some prophetical, and some poetical; and two  
may be considered as peculiarly of the moral  
class—one being an affecting dissertation on the  
vanity of human life, and another a collection  
of moral sentences under the name of Proverbs.  
T have already observed that the great immova-  
ble and eternal foundation of the superiority of  
  
eousness, His mercy, and the infinity of his at-  
tributes, are marked in every line of the Old  
Testament in characters which nothing less than  
blindness car fail to discern, and nothing less  
than fraud can misrepresent, This conception  
of God serving as a basis for the piety of His  
worshippers, was of course incomparably more  
rational and more profound than it was possible  
that sentiment could be which adored Devils for  
Jeities, or even that of philosophers like Soecra-  
tes, Plato and Cicero, who, with purer and  
more exalted ideas of the Divine natare than  
the rabble of the Poets, still considered the ex-  
istence of any God at all as a question upon  
which they could form no decided opinion. You  
have seen that even Cicero believed the only  
solid foundation of all human virtue to be piety;  
and it was impossible that a piety so far tran-  
scending that of all other nations should not  
contain in its consequences a system of moral  
virtue equally transcendent.  
  
The first of the ten commandments was, that  
the Jewish ae should never admit the idea  
  
of any other God—the object of the second,  
  
third and fourth was merely to impress with  
  
greater force the obligation of the first, and to  
  
obviate the tendencies Pe temptations which  
  
unig the to its being néglecied, or disregard-  
  
j ed. Throughout the whole Jaw the same in-  
heart-rending scene before him with as little | junctions are continually renewed ; all the rites  
and ceremonies were adapted to root deeper into  
the hearts and souls of the chosen people that  
  
the Lord Jehovah was to be forever the sole and  
  
I do know, that he justifies slavery and denoun- | exclusive object of love. Reverence and ado-  
ces anti slavery efforts as bitterly as do the most | Tration, unbounded as His own nature, was the  
principle; every letter of the Law, and the  
es whole Bible is but a commentary upon it, an

with this uninterrupted series of signs and won-

who krow the nature of man, it is not surpris-  
ing—to find the Jewish history little else than a  
narrative of idolatries and corruption of the  
  
Israelites and their monarchs; that the very  
people who had heard the voice of God from  
  
Mount Sinai, within forty days compel Aaron  
to make a golden calf and worship that as the  
‘God who brought them out of the land of  
Egypt ;’’ that the very Solomon, the wisest of  
mankind, to whom God had twice revealed him-

Temple, the witness, in the presence of the

consumed the offerings from the altar, and of

he, in his old age, beguiled by fair idolatresses,  
should have fallen from the worship of the ever-  
blessed Jehovah to that of Ashtaroth and Mil-  
com, &amp;c., the abomination of all the petty  
tribes of Judea—that of Baal and Dagon, &amp;c. ;  
that the Sun, Moon and Planets, and ali the  
host of Heaven—the moutcains and plains,  
every high place, and every grave should have  
swarmed with idols, to corrupt the hearts and  
debase the minds of a people so highly favored  
of Heaven, the elect of the Almighty—may be  
amung the mysteries of Divine Providence,  
which it is not given to mortality to explain, but  
as inadmissable only to those who presume to  
demand why it has pleased the Supreme Arbiter  
of events to create such a being as man.  
serve, however, that amid the atrocious crimes  
which that nation so often polluted themselves  
  
Ob-  
  
with—through all their servitudes, dismember-  
  
ments, captivities, and transmigrations —the Di-  
  
vine light, which had been imparted exclusively  
  
to them, was never extinguished ; the law de-  
livered from Sinai was preserved in all its purity;  
the histories which attested its violations and its  
accomplishments were recorded aud never lost.  
The writings of the prophets, of David and  
  
Svlomon, were al! inspired with the same idea  
  
of the Godhead, the same intertwinement of  
  
religion and morality, and the same anticipa-  
tions of the Divine ‘timmanuel, the God with  
us :” these survived all the changes of govern-  
ment and of constitations which befeli the peo- -  
  
ple ; “the pi&#x27;lar of cloud by day and the pillar  
of fire by night,”—the law and the prophets,  
  
eternal in their nature—went before them un-  
  
sullied and unimpaired through all the ruins of  
  
rebellion and revolution, of conquest and disper-  
sion, of war, pestilence and famine. The As-  
  
syrian, Babylonian, and Egyptian empires,  
  
yre and Sidon, Carthage, and all the other  
nations of antiquity rose and fell in their reli-  
gious institutions at the same time as in their  
law and government ; it was the practice of the  
Romans when they besieged a city to invoke its  
gods to come over to them ; they considered the  
gods as Summer friends, ready to desert their  
votaries in the hour of calamity, or as traitors,  
ready to sell themselves for a bribe; they had  
no higher estimate of their own than of the.  
stranger deities, whom, as Gibbon said—&#x27;‘they  
were always ready to admit tothe freedom of  
the city.’ Allthe gods of the heathen have  
perished with their makers; for where on the

“4 more energy of argument and  
ahority but w wasion in the Bible than in  
  
—————  
  
all the writings of the ancient moralists. In  
one of the apochryphal books, (Wisdom of  
Solomon,) the cardinal virtues are expressly  
named: “If any man love righteousness, her  
labors are virtue, for she teacheth temperance  
and pradence and justice and fortitude ;’’ which  
are such things as men can have nothing more  
profitable in this life.” The book of Job, wheth-  
er considered as history or 4s an allegorical para-  
ble, was written to teach the lessons of patience  
in afflictions, of resignation under Divine chas-  
tisement, of undoubted confidence in the justice  
and goodness of God under every temptation or  
provocation to depart from it. The morality of  
the apocryphal books is generally the same as  
that of the inspired writers, except that in some  
of them there is more stress laid upon the minor  
  
objects of the law, and merely formal ordinances  
  
of police, and less continual recurrence to ‘‘the  
  
weightier matters.’’ The book of Ecclesiasti-  
  
cus, however, contains more-wisdom than all the  
  
sayings of the seven Grecian Sages, It was  
  
upon this foundation that the more perfect sys-  
  
tem of Christian morality was to be raised.  
  
But T must defer the consideration to my next  
  
letter. In the mean time aT have urged that  
the aeriptnral idoa of Gud IS the feundetinn of  
  
all perfect virtue, and that it is totally different  
from the idea of God conceived by any ancient  
nation, [ should recommend it to you in porsu-  
ing the Scriptures hereafier to meditate often  
upon the expressions by which they mark the  
character of the Deity, and to reflect upon the  
duties to Him and to your fellow-mortals which  
follow by inevitable deductions from them.  
That you may have an exact idea of the opin-  
ions of ancient heathen philosophers concerning  
God, or rather the gods, study Cicero’s dialogues  
and read the Abbe Olivet’s remarks on the The-  
ology of the Grecian Philosophers, annexed to  
his translations.

I promised you, in my last letter, to  
state the particulars in which I deemed  
the Christian dispensation to be an im­  
provement or perfection of the law deliv  
ia a etana e to t  
e at anal cosed aseding   
system of morality; but before I come to  
this point, it is proper to remark upon the  
 e o at   
character of the books of the Old Tesia  
ment subrequent to those of Moses. Some  
are historical, some prophetical, and some  
poetical; and two may be considered as  
peculiarly of the moral class--one being  
an effecting dissertation on the vanity of  
human life, and another a collection of  
moral sentences under the name of Pro-  
verbs. I have already observed that the  
great immovable and eternal foundation of  
the superiority of Scripture morals to all  
othr morality, was the idea of God dis-  
closed in them, and only in them; the unt-  
  
ty of God, His omnipotence, His righic  
ousness. Hts merey, and the infinity of  
    o  
his attributes, are marked in every line of  
the Old Testament in characters which  
nothing less than blindness can fail to dis-  
cern, and nothing less than frand can mis  
represent. This conception of God serv­  
ing as a basis for the piety of His wor­  
shipers, was of course incomparably more  
rational and more profound than it was  
possible that sentiment could be which a­  
dored Devils for deities, or even that of  
 ae e  
  
phllosophers like Socrates, Plato and Of-  
cero, who, with purer and more exalted  
ideas of the Divine nature than the rabble  
of the Pocts, still considered the existence  
of any God at all as a question upon  
which they could form no decided opin­  
ion. You have seen that even Cicero be­  
lieved the only solid foundation of all hu­  
man virtue to be piety; and it was impos­  
sible that a piety so far transcending that  
of all other nations should not contain in  
its consquences a system of moral virtue  
equally transcendent.  
The first of the ten commandments  
that the Jewish people should never ad  
mit the idea of any other God,-the object  
of the second, third and fourth was mere  
to to legruress with greator force the obli

and the Jewish people; it was sanctioned

by the blessing and the curse pronounced  
oe o  a o e  
upon Mount Gerizim and Monnt Ebal, in  
the presence of the whole Jewish people,  
and strangers, and by the solemn accep­  
tance of the whole people responding A­  
men to every one of the curses denounced  
for violation on their part of the Covenant.  
From that day until the birth of Christ, (a  
period of about 1,500 years) the historical  
books of the Old Testament are no more  
than a simple record of the fulfillment of  
the covenant, in all its blessings and cur  
ses, exactly according to the fufillment or  
transgression of its duties by the people.  
The nation was first governed by Joshua,  
inder the express appointment of God;  
be by a sucession of judges, and ufter-  
  
wald by a double line of kings, antil con­  
quered and carried into captivity by the  
kings of Assyria and Babylon; seventy  
years afterward restored to their country.  
their temple and their laws; and aguin  
conquered by the Romans, and ruled by  
their tributary kings and proconsuls. Yet,  
  
through all their vicissitudes of fortune,  
they never complied with the duties to  
hich they had bound themselres by the  
covenant without being loaded with the  
blessings promised on Mount Gerizim,  
and never departed from them without be  
ing afflicted with some of the curses de-  
  
nounced upon Mount Ebal. The proeof Job, whether considered as history or humanity, kindness, and simplicity of

So much more deep and strong was the
