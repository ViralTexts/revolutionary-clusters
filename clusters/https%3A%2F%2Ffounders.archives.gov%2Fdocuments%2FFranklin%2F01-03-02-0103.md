But lo!—what’s that I see appear?  
It seems far off a pointed flame;  
From Earthwards too the shining Meteor came:  
How swift it climbs th’ etherial Space!  
And now it traverses each Sphere,  
And seems some knowing Mind, familiar to the Place.  
Dame, hand my Glass, the longest, strait prepare;—  
’Tis He—’tis Taylor’s Soul, that travels there.  
O stay! thou happy Spirit, stay,  
And lead me on thro’ all th’ unbeaten Wilds of Day;  
Where Planets in pure Streams of Ether driven,  
Swim thro’ the blue Expanse of Heav’n.  
There let me, thy Companion, stray

Unnumber’d Suns, all Seas of molten Gold,

. 50m. West. Captain Middleton, a Member of the Royal Society, who had made many Voyages thither, and winter’d there 1741–2, when he was in Search of the North-West Passage to the South-Sea, gives an Account of it to that Society, from which I have extracted these Particulars, viz.  
  
The Hares, Rabbits, Foxes, and Partridges, in September and the Beginning of October, change their Colour to a snowy White, and continue white till the following Spring.  
The Lakes and standing Waters, which are not above 10 or 12 Feet deep, are frozen to the Ground in Winter, and the Fishes therein all perish. Yet in Rivers near the Sea, and Lakes of a greater Depth than 10 or 12 Feet, Fishes are caught all the Winter, by cutting Holes thro’ the Ice, and therein putting Lines and Hooks. As soon as the Fish are brought into the open Air, they i

g. Bottles of strong Beer, Brandy, strong Brine, Spirits of Wine, set out in the open Air for 3 or 4 Hours, freeze to solid Ice. The Frost is never out of the Ground, how deep is not certain; but on digging 10 or 12 Feet down in the two Summer Months, it has been found hard frozen.  
All the Water they use for Cooking, Brewing, &amp;c. is melted Snow and Ice; no Spring is yet found free from freezing, tho’ dug ever so deep down. All Waters inland, are frozen fast by the Beginning of October, and continue so to the Middle of May.  
  
The Walls of the Houses are of Stone, two Feet thick; the Windows very small, with thick wooden Shutters, which are close shut 18 Hours every Day in Winter. In the Cellars they put their Wines, Brandies, &amp;c. Four large Fires are made every Day, in great Stoves to warm the Rooms: As soon as the Wood is burnt down to a Coal, the Tops of the Chimnies are close stopped, with an Iron Cover; this keeps the Heat in, but almost stifles the People. And notwithstanding this, in 4 or 5 Hours after the Fire is out, the Inside of the Walls and Bed-places will be 2 or 3 Inches thick with Ice, which is every Morning cut away with a Hatchet. Three or four Times a Day, Iron Shot, of 24 Pounds Weight, are made red hot, and hung up in the Windows of their Apartments, to moderate the Air that comes in at Crevices; yet this, with a Fire kept burning the greatest Part of 24 Hours, will not prevent Beer, Wine, Ink, &amp;c. from Freezing.  
For their Winter Dress, a Man makes use of three Pair of Socks, of coarse Blanketting, or Duffeld, for the Feet, with a Pair of Deerskin Shoes over them; two Pair of thick English Stockings, and a Pair of Cloth Stockings upon them; Breeches lined with Flannel; two or three English Jackets, and a Fur, or Leather Gown over them; a large Beaver Cap, double, to come over the Face and Shoulders, and a Cloth of Blanketting under the Chin; with Yarn Gloves, and a large Pair of Beaver Mittins, hanging down from the Shoulders before, to put the Hands in, reaching up as high as the Elbows.

eventing it but Exercise and stirring Abroad.  
The Fogs and Mists, brought by northerly Winds in Winter, appear visible to the naked Eye to be Icicles innumerable, as small as fine Hairs, and pointed as sharp as Needles. These Icicles lodge in their Clothes, and if their Faces and Hands are uncover’d, presently raise Blisters as white as a Linnen Cloth, and as hard as Horn. Yet if they immediately turn their Back to the Weather, and can bear a Hand out of the Mitten, and with it rub the blister’d Part for a small Time, they sometimes bring the Skin to its former State; if not, they make the best of their Way to a Fire, bathe the Part in hot Water, and thereby dissipate the Humours raised by the frozen Air; otherwise the Skin wou’d be off in a short Time, with much hot, serous, watry Matter, coming from under along with the Skin; and this happens to some almost every Time they go Abroad, for 5 or 6 Months in the Winter, so extreme cold is the Air, when the Wind blows any Thing strong.— Thus

In horrid grandeur haughty Hero reigns,  
And thrives on mankind’s miseries and pains.  
What slaughter’d hosts! What cities in a blaze!  
What wasted countries! and what crimson seas!  
With orphans tears his impious bowl o’erflows;

The fall of Niagara, which Popple’s map lays down in the N-West corner of this province, is, according to Henepin, compounded of two great cross streams of water, and two falls, with an isle sloping along between. The waters fall from a horrible precipice above 600 foot, and foam and boil in an hideous manner, making an outrageous noise, more terrible than thunder; for when the wind blows out of the South, their dismal roaring may be heard more than 15 Leagues off.  
Conrad, the 3d emperor of Germany, besieged Guelph, duke of Bavaria, in the city of Wansburg. The women perceiving the town could not hold out, petitioned the emperor that they might depart only with so much as they could carry on their backs; which the emperor condescended to, expecting they would have laden themselves with silver and gold; but they all came forth with every one her husband on her back; whereat the emperor was so moved that he wept, received the duke into his favour, gave all the men their lives, and extolled the women with deserved praises. Quere, Is this story more to the honour of the wives or of the husbands? My dame Bridget says the first, I think the latter: But we submit our dispute to the decision of the candid reader.
