In the spring of the year 1774. a robbery and murder was committed on an inhabitant of the frontier parts of Virginia by two Indians of the Shawanee nation. Instead of considering this as an individual wrong for which justice on the offenders should have been demanded of the Shawanese the neighboring whites were induced to punish it in a more summary way. Colo. Cresap, a man infamous for the many murders he has committed on those much injured people, collected a party of Whites and proceeded down the river Konhaway in quest of vengeance. Unhappily a canoe of women and children with one man only was seen coming from the opposite shore, unarmed, and expecting nothing less than an hostile attack from the whites. Cresap and his party concealed themselves on the bank of the river, and, the moment the canoe reached the shore, singled out their objects, and at one fire killed every person in it. This happened to be the family of Logan an Indian chief who had long and often distinguished himself as a friend of the whites, but this unworthy and cowardly return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly signalized himself in the war which ensued. In the Autumn of the same year a decisive battle was fought between the collected forces of the Shawanese and their allies, and a detachment of the army of Ld. Dunmore. This nobleman, then governor of Virginia, tho’ conscious of the injustice of the war, had thought it prudent to raise a strong power in order to compel the Indians to accept of peace on reasonable terms. The battle was fought on the banks of the Ohio, from nine o’clock in the morning till darkness came on. The Indians were defeated, and sued for peace. Logan however disdained to be seen among the suppliants, but lest Lord Dunmore should distrust the sincerity of a treaty from which so distinguished a chief absented himself, he sent by a messenger a speech to be delivered verbally, of which the following is a translation. The event was a just and honorable peace.  
  
  
  
I appeal to any white man to say if ever he entered Logan’s cabbin hungry and I he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked and I he cloathed him not. During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabbin, an advocate for peace. Nay such was my affection for the Whites, that those of my own country pointed my countrymen hooted as they passed by and said ‘Logan is the friend of White men.’ I had even thought to have lived with you, but for the injuries of one man. Colo. Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked, cut off all the Relations of Logan; not sparing even my women or childen. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any human creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it; I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country I rejoice at the beams of peace, but do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan?—Not one.

turned to his tent. This Logan is the man  
that thé Secretary of the United States speaks  
of in his notes on Virginia. He says:  
  
“Col. Cressap, a man infamous for the many  
murders he had committed on those much in-  
jured people, collected a party and proceeded  
down the Kanahway in quest of vengeance.  
Unfortunately a canoe of women and children,  
with one man only, was seen coming from  
the opposite shore unarmed, and unsus-  
pecting any hostile attack from the whites.  
Cressap and his party concealed themselves  
on the banks of the river, and the moment  
the canoe reached the shore, singled out their  
objects, and at one fire killed every person in  
it. This happened to the family of Logan,  
long distinguished as the friend of the whites.  
Thisunworthy return provoked his vengeance.  
He accordingly signalized himself in the war  
that ensued. However, it appears the Indians  
were defeated by the Virginians, and sued  
for peace, but Logan disdained to be seen  
among the suppliants. Lest the sincerity of  
a treaty should be disturbed, from which so  
distinguished a chief absented himself, he  
sent by a messenger the following speech to  
be delivered to Lord Dunmore. ‘I appeal  
to any white man to say if he ever entered  
Logan’s cabin hungry, and he gave him not  
meat? If ever he came cold and naked, and  
he clothed him not? During the course of  
the last long and bloody war, Logan remained  
idle in his cabin, an advocate for Peace. Such  
was my love for the whites, that my country-  
men pointed as they passed my cabin and  
said, Logan is the friend of white men. I  
had ever thought to have lived with you, but  
for the injuriesof one man. Col. Cressap, the  
last spring, in culd blood and unprovoked,  
murdered all the relations of Logan; not  
even sparing my women and children. There  
runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of  
any living creature. This called on me for  
revenge. I have sought it, I have killed  
many. I have fully glutted my vengeance.  
For my country I rejoice at the beams of  
peace. But do not harbor the thought that  
mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt  
fear. He will not turn on his heel to save  
his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan ?

“I appeal to any white man to say if ever he entered Logan’s

or naked, and I gave him not clothing.  
  
“During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan  
remained in his tent, an advocate for peace. Nay, such was  
my love for the whites, that those of my country pointed at me  
as they passed and said, ‘Logan is the friend of the white man.’  
I had even thought to have lived among you, but for the injuries  
of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and  
unprovoked, cut off all the relations of Logart, not sparing even  
my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood  
in the veins of any human creature. This called on me for  
revenge. I have sought it. I have killed many. I have fully
