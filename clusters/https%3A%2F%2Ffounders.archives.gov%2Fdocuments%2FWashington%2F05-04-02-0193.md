Gentlemen,  
[Portsmouth, N.H., 2 November 1789]  
  
The affectionate welcome, which you are pleased to give me to the eastern parts of the union, would leave me without excuse, did I fail to acknowledge the sensibility, which it awakens, and to express the most sincere return that a grateful sense of your goodness can suggest.  
To be approved by the praise-worthy is a wish as natural to becoming ambition, as its consequence is flattering to our self-love—I am, indeed, much indebted to the favorable sentiments which you entertain towards me, and it will be my study to deserve them.  
The tribute of thanksgiving which you offer to “the gracious Father of lights” for his inspiration of our public-councils with wisdom and firmness to complete the national constitution, is worthy of men, who, devoted to the pious purposes of religion, desire their accomplishment by such means as advance the temporal happiness of their fellow-men—and, here, I am persuaded, you will permit me to observe that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction. To this consideration we ought to ascribe the absence of any regulation, respecting religion, from the Magna-Charta of our country.  
To the guidance of the ministers of the gospel this important object is, perhaps, more properly committed—It will be your care to instruct the ignorant, and to reclaim the devious—and, in the progress of morality and science, to which our government will give every furtherance, we may confidently expect the advancement of true religion, and the completion of our happiness.  
I pray the munificent Rewarder of virtue that your agency in this good work may receive its compensation here and hereafter.

some explicit acknowledgement of the only true  
God and Jesus Christ whotnhe hath sent, insert­  
ed, somewhere, in the Magna Charta of our  
country.&quot;  
&quot; Under the nurturing hand of a ruler, of  
such virtues, and one so deservedly revered by  
all ranks, we joyfully indulge the hope, that  
virtue and religion will revive and flourifli—that  
infidelity, and the vices ever attendant in its train,  
will be baniflied every polite circle—and that  
national piety will soon become fafhionable there,  
and from thence be diffufed among all ranks in  
the community.&quot;  
Newbury-Port, 0(1. 28, 1789.  
THE ANSWER.  
gentlemen,  
THE affectionate welcome, which you are  
pleased to give ine to the ealtern parts of  
the&#x27;Unioii, would leave me without excuse, did  
I fail to acknowledge the sensibility which itawa­  
kens ; and to exprel&#x27;s them oft sincere return, that  
a graceful sense of your goodness can suggest.  
To be approved by the praise-worthy, is a wish  
is natural to becoming ambition as its confe­  
rence is flattering to our felf-love.  
lam, indeed, much indebted to the favorable  
sentiments, which you entertain towards me, and  
it will be my study to defervc them.  
The tribute of tliankfgiving,which you offer to  
thegracious Kather of lights, for his inspi­  
ration of our public councils with wisdom and  
firmnefs to complete the national constitution, is  
worthy of men, who devoted to the pious purpo­  
ses of religion, desire their accomplifliment by  
such means as advance the temporal happiness of  
their fellow men. And, here, I am persuaded,  
you will perniic me to observe, that the path of  
true piety is so plain as to require but little poli­  
tical direction.  
To this consideration we ought to ascribe the  
ablence of any regulation refpecfting religion  
from the Magna Charta of our country. To the  
guidance of the ministers of the Gospel, this im­  
portant object .is, perhaps, more properly com­  
mitted. It will be your care toinftruifttheignc­  
rant, and to reclaim the devious : And in the  
progrcfj of morality and fcicncc, to which our  
  
[ Publifki+? on Wediisfday and Saturday  
  
government will oive everv furtherance, we may  
~ &quot; 7 •  
confidently expert the advancement of true reli­  
gion, and the completion ot&#x27; our happiness.  
I pray the munificent Rewarder of Virtue, that  
your agency in this good work may receive its  
compensation here and hereafter.
