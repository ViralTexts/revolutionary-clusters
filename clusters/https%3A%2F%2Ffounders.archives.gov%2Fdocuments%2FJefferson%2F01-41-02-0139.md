The inclosed letter, tho’ directed to you, was intended to me also, was left open with a request that, when perused, I would forward it to you. it gives me occasion to write a word to you on the subject of Louisiana, which being a new one, an interchange of sentiment may produce correct ideas before we are to act on them. our information as to the country is very incompleat: we have taken measures to obtain it full as to the settled part which I hope to recieve in time for Congress. the boundaries which I deem not admitting question are the high lands on the Western side of the Missisipi inclosing all it’s waters, the Missouri of course, and terminating in the line drawn from the Northwestern point of the lake of the woods to the nearest source of the Mispi, as lately settled between Gr. Britain &amp; us. we have some claims to extend on the seacoast Westwardly to the Rio Norte or Bravo, and better to go Eastwardly to the Rio Perdido, between Mobile &amp; Pensacola, the antient boundary of Louisiana. these claims will be a subject of negociation with Spain, and if, as soon as she is at war, we push them strongly with one hand, holding out a price in the other, we shall certainly obtain the Floridas, and all in good time. in the mean while, without waiting for permission, we shall enter into the exercise of the natural right we have always insisted on with Spain; to wit that of a nation holding the upper part of streams, having a right of innocent passage thro’ them to the ocean. we shall prepare her to see us practise on this, &amp; she will not oppose it by force. objections are raising to the Eastward against this vast extent of our boundaries, and propositions are made to exchange Louisiana or a part of it for the Floridas. but, as I have said, we shall get the Floridas without, and I would not give one inch of the waters of the Mispi to any nation, because I see in a light very important to our peace, the exclusive right to it’s navigation, &amp; the admission of no nation into it, but as into the Potomak or Delaware, with our consent &amp; under our police. these Federalists see in this acquisition, the formation of a new confederacy embracing all the waters of the Mispi, on both sides of it, and a separation of it’s Eastern waters from us. these combinations depend on so many circumstances which we cannot foresee, that I place little reliance on them. we have seldom seen neighborhood produce affection among nations. the reverse is almost the universal truth. besides if it should become the great interest of those nations to separate from this, if their happiness should depend on it so strongly as to induce them to go through that convulsion, why should the Atlantic states dread it? but especially why should we, their present inhabitants, take side in such a question? when I view the Atlantic states, procuring for those on the Eastern waters of the Mispi, friendly instead of hostile neighbors on it’s western waters, I do not view it as an Englishman would the procuring future blessings for the French nation with whom he has no relations of blood or affection. the future inhabitants of the Atlantic &amp; Mispi states will be our sons. we leave them in distinct but bordering establishments. we think we see their happiness in their union, &amp; we wish it. events may prove it otherwise; and if they see their interest in separation, why should we take side with our Atlantic rather than our Mispi descendants? it is the elder &amp; the younger son differing. god bless them both, &amp; keep them in union if it be for their good, but separate them if it be better. the inhabited part of Louisiana, from Point coupeé to the sea will of course be immediately a territorial government &amp; soon a state. but above that, the best use we can make of the country for some time will be to give establishments in it to the Indians on the East side of the Mispi in exchange for their present country, and open land offices in the last, &amp; thus make this acquisition the means of filling up the Eastern side instead of drawing off it’s population. when we shall be full on this side, we may lay off a range of states on the Western bank from the head to the mouth, &amp; so range after range, advancing compactly as we multiply.   This treaty must of course be laid before both houses, because both have important functions to exercise respecting it. they I presume will see their duty to their country in ratifying &amp; paying for it, so as to secure a good which would otherwise probably be never again in their power. but I suppose they must then appeal to the nation for an additional article to the constitution, approving &amp; confirming an act which the nation had not previously authorised. the constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for incorporating foreign nations into our union. the Executive in siesing the fugitive occurrence which so much advanced the good of their country, have done an act beyond the constitution. the legislature in casting behind them Metaphysical subtleties, and risking themselves like faithful servants, must ratify &amp; pay for it, and throw themselves on their country for doing for them unauthorised what we know they would have done for themselves had they been in a situation to do it. it is the case of a guardian, investing the money of his ward in purchasing an important adjacent territory; &amp; saying to him when of age, I did this for your good; I pretend to no right to bind you. you may disavow me, and I must get out of the scrape as I can. I thought it my duty to risk myself for you. but we shall not be disavowed by the nation, and their act of indemnity will confirm &amp; not weaken the constitution, by more strongly marking out it’s lines.  
We have nothing later from Europe than the public papers give. I hope yourself &amp; all the Western members will make a sacred point of being at the first day of the meeting of Congress; for vestra res agitur. Accept my affectionate salutations &amp; assurances of esteem &amp; respect.

Dear Sir »~The enclused leuer, the’ di­

was lett opes with.a request, that when for­  
warded. I would forward it to you I gives  
e occasion 10 write 2 word to youop (he  
subjeci of Liohisiana, which being 2 vew one,  
an interchange: of seatimenis may p:oduce

Quroformation as to (he coantry s very  
incomplote : we bave taken measures to obtain  
it full as to the settled part, which I hope to re  
ceive in time for Congress, The boundaries,  
which I deem not admitiing question, are the  
high lands on the western side of the Mississip­  
pi inclosing all s waters, the Missovri of  
course, and terminating in ibe line drawn from  
_the porth western poiot of the Liake of the  
- Woods to the nearest source of “he Mississippi,  
as lately setiled beiween Great Biitaio and the  
United States. We hsve some clsimsto ex  
cend oo the sea coawt westwardly to the Rio  
Norte ot Bravo, and béiter; ‘o go eastwardly  
ta the Riu Perd!de, between .Motile aud Pen­  
sucolay the ancient’ bouudary of Lowsiapa.—  
These claiws wiil be a .sgbject -of negotiation  
with Spain, and if. as soun as she 15 at war, we  
- push them strongly withone haud, bolding out  
a pri¢e i the ether, we shall certainly obiaio  
the Floridas, and aill in good time. Ta the  
f me¢an-while, wilhout waiting for permission,

o’ the streams, haviag a right of inne­  
cent passdge through them to the ocean.  
&#x27; We shall prepare her to see her practice on  
t ibie. and she will not oppose it by force.  
Objections are raisiog to the eastward  
against the vast extent of our boundaries, and  
- propositious are made to exchange Louisiana,  
- of a part of it for ihe Floridas. Bui, as-| bave  
eaid, we shall get the Floridas without, aod 1  
~would not give one inch of the waters of the.  
&#x27; Missiseippi 10 any nation, becavse [ sege in a

sive right to its navigation, and the adwmission of  
00 nation ioto il, bu! as into -the Potomac or  
D+laware, with our consent and under our po­  
lice. These federalists sce in this acquisition  
the formation of a new cenfederacy, embrac­  
g all the waters of &#x27;he Miesissippi, on both  
sides of 11, aud » separation of its eastern wa.  
ters from us,. These combinations depend on  
80 many circumstances wnich we caonot fore-.  
see, that I place little reliance oo them. We  
have seliom seep neighborhood produce affec­  
tion awhong onationms. The leverse is alwost  
; the wniversal truth. ~Besides, if it should bes  
i come the great interest of those nations to sep­  
arate frow tus, it theix, bappioess should de­  
pend on it so strongly as to induce them to go  
through that cenvulsion, why should the Atlan­  
tic Statas dread it 3 But ‘especially why should  
we, their present inhabitants, take side in such  
-a questiorr? Whea [ view the, Atlaotic Stafes,  
procuring for those on the eastern waters of  
he Mississippt friendiy . iostead of hostile  
aeighbors on its. western waters, &#x27;I do not  
view it as an Eoglishman would the proeuring  
future blessings for the French neiion, with  
whom be Las no relations of blood or affection.  
The future whabitasts of the Atlantic and  
Mississippt States will be our sons. We - leave  
_them in distinct hut bordering establishments.  
We think we see their happiness ia their u­  
vion, and we wish it. Kreats may prove it  
otherwise; and if they see their interest io  
separation, why shoold we take side with our.  
Atlantic rather than our Mississippi despea-~  
dants? Ttis the elder and the younger son  
diffe ing. God bless them both, aud keep  
tem in amiou, if it be for their good, but sep­  
sra&#x27;e them, if it be better. The inhabited |  
pait of Loaisiana, from Point Coupee to the  
sea, will of cource be immediately a territarial  
goveroment, and soon a Siate. But above  
that, the best use we cao make of the ceuntry  
for some time, will be io give establishmeats in  
it ta the Indians oo the east side of the Missis­  
sippi, &#x27;n exchange for their present couatry,  
ard opeo land offices in the Jast,and thus make  
this acgnisition the means of filling up the eas­  
terv side. insiead of drawing off /s populatien.  
When wo shall be fall oe this sida, we may  
‘ay off a range of States on the weslern bank,  
from-the head so the mouth, and so, range

that time, and long since in the Atlantic States, that the sepa-  
ration of the Mississippi States from the confederacy, was by no  
means improbable; and in commenting on such an event, he  
says, ‘‘we think we see their happiness in their union, and we  
wish it. Events may prove it otherwise; and if they see their  
interest in separation, why should we take side with our Atlantic  
rather than our Mississippi descendants’ It is the elder and  
the younger son differing. God bless them both, and keep them  
in union, if it be for their good, but separate them, if it be  
better.” It was not then perceived that the Western States, in  
addition to those motives to unton which apply to all the States,  
have some that are peculiar to themselves, since the navigation  
of the Mississippi must always be important to their pros-  
perity, and it can be permanently secured to them only by a  
maritime people, which the Atlantic States are, and they never  
can be.

Louisiana, which being a new one, an interchange of sentiment may pro-  
duce correct ideas before we are to act on them. our information as to the  
country is very incompleat: we have taken measures to obtain it full as to  
the settled part which FE hope to receive in time for . the bound-  
aries which | deem not admitting question are the high lands on the West-  
ern side of the Missipi inclosing st its waters, the Missouri of course, and  
terminating in the line drawn from the Northwestern point of the lake of  
the woods to the nearest source of the Mis’pi as lately settled between Gr.  
Britain and us. we have some claims to extend on the seacoast West-  
ward&#x27;y to the Rio Norte or Bravo, and better to go Eastwardly, to the Rio  
Perdido, between Mobile and Pensacola, the antient boundary of Louisi-  
ana. these claims will be a subject of negociation with Spain, and if, as  
soon as she is at war, we push them strongly with one hand, holding out  
a price in the other, we shall certainly obtain the Floridas, and all in good  
time&gt; in the mean while, without waiting for permission, we shall enter  
into the exercise of the natural right we have always insisted on with  
Spain, to wit that of a nation holding the upper part of streams, having a  
right of innocent passage thro’ them to the ocean. we shall eee her  
to see us practise on this, and she will not oppose it by force. objections  
are raising to the Eastwerd against this vast extent of our boundaries,  
and propositions are made to exchange Louisiana ora part of it fur the Flor-  
idas. but, as I have said, we shall get the Floridas without, and I would  
not give one inch of the waters of the Missiysippi to any nation. because  
I see in a light very important to our peace, the exclusive write to its nav-  
igation and the admission of no nation into it, but as into the Potomac or  
Delaware, with our consent and under our police. These Federalists see  
in this acquisition, the formation of a new confederacy embracing all the wa-  
ters of the Mississipi, on both sides of it, and a separation of its Eeastern  
waters from us. these combinations depend on so many circumstances which  
we cannot foresee, that I place little reliance on them. we have seldom  
seen neighborhood produce affection among nations. the reverse is almost  
the universal truth. besides if it should become the great interest of those  
nations to separate from this, if their happiness should depend on it so  
strongly as to induce them to go throu t convulsion, why should the  
atlantic states dread it? but especially why should we, their present inhabit-  
ants, take side in such a question? when J view the Atlantic states procur-  
ing for those on the Eastern waters of the Mis’pi friendly instead of hos-  
tile neighbors on its Western waters, I do not view it as an Englishman  
would the procuring future blessings for the French nation with whom he  
has no relations of or affection. the future inhabitants of the At-  
lantic and Mis’pi states will be our sons. we leave them in distinct but  
bordering establishments. we think we see their happiness in their union,  
and we wish it. events may prove it otherwise; and if they see their in-  
terest in separation why should we take part with our Atlantic rather than  
our Mis’pi desendants? it is the elder and the younger son differing. God  
bless them both, and keep them in union if it be for their good, but sepa-  
rate them if it be better. the inhabited part of Louisiana from Point  
coupee to the sea will of course be immediately a territorial government  
and soon a state. but above that, the best use we can make of the coun-  
try for some time will be to give establishments in it to the Indians on the  
East side of the Mis’pi in exchange for their present country, and open  
land offices in the last, and thus make this acquisition the means of ‘filling:  
up the Eastern side instead of drawing off its population. when we shall  
be full on this side we may lay off a range of states on the Western bank  
from the head to the mouth, and so range after range, advancing com-  
ctly as We multiply. This treaty must of course . laid before both  
souses, because both have important functions to exercise respecting it.  
they I presume will see their duty to their country in ratif ing paying  
for it so as to secure a good which would otherwise prove ly be never

ances,” we thing it cannot be doubted ; and there  
is no just reasons to fear that it will meet with  
general approbation at the South. To say nothing  
of any other objection to the proposition of annexa­  
tion, it is believed to be unconstitutional. Mr.  
Jefferson’s opinion on this point was clearly expres­  
sed in the annexed extract of a letter writen to Mr.  
Breckenridge, dated August 12, 1803, when the  
treaty for the cession of Louisiana was under consid­  
eration. He says—  
“ This treaty must of course be laid before the  
Houses, because both have important functions to  
exercise respecting it. They, I presume, will see  
their duty in ratifying and paying for it, so as to  
secure a good which would otherwise probably be  
never again in their power. But 1 suppose they  
must then appeal to the nation for an additional  
article to the constitution, approving and confirm­  
ing an act which the nation has not previously au­  
thorized. The constitution has made no provision  
for our holding foreign territory, still less for in­  
corporating fot-eign nations in our Union. The  
executive in seizing the fugitive occurrence which  
so much advances the good of their country, have  
done an act beyond the constitution.

Britain. France had nothing to sell but what quustianell Louisiana after the  
cession made to Great Britain in 1763. There was, nevertheless, inserted in  
this treaty of sale, a reference to a perfectly undefined line to the Pacific,  
having no defined point of commencement, and referring to territory hav-  
  
ing no definable boundary either on the north, or the south, or on the east.  
But before the treaty for the purchase was completed, President Jefferson, in  
a letter dated August 12, 1803, wrote thus to Mr. Breckenridge:—‘ The boun-  
dary which I deem not admitting question are the high lands on the west-  
ern side of the Mississippi, inclosing all its waters—the Missouri, of course  
—and terminating in the line drawn from the north-western point, from the  
Lake of the Woods to the nearest source of the Mississippi, as lately set-  
tled between Great Britain and the United States. We have some claims  
to extend on the sea-coast westwardly to the Rio Norte or Bravo—and bet-  
ter to go eastwardly to the Rio Perdido between Mobile and Pensacola,  
the ancient boundary of Louisiana.’ It is evident, therefore, that at this time  
no French title to any line running beyond the mountains on the west was  
known to have existed.  
In 1819, Don Louis de Onis was commissioned, on the part of the gov-  
ernment of Spain, to confer with the government of the United States o

&quot;Objections are raising to the eastward against  
the vast extent of our boundaries, and propositions  
are made to exchange Louisiana, or a part of, for  
the Floridas. But, as I have said, we shall get the  
Floridas without, and I would not give one inch of  
the waters of the Mississippi to any nation, because  
I see in a light very important to our peace the ex­  
clusive right of its navagation, and the admission  
of no nation into it, but as into the Potomac or Del­  
ware, with our consent and under our police.  
These Federalists seein this acquisition the forma  
tion of a new Confederacy, embracing all the  
waters of the Mississippi, on both sides of it, and a  
separation of its eastern waters from us. These  
combinations depend on so many circumstances  
which we cannot foresee, that I place little reliance  
on them. We have seldom seen neighborhood pro  
duce affection among nations. Besides, it should  
become the great interest of those nations to sepa­  
rate from this, if their happiness should depend on  
it so strongly as to induce them to go through that  
a    
conviusion, why should the Atlantic States dread  
it? But especially why should we, their present  
inhabitants, takes sides in such a question?  
&quot;When I view the Atlantie States procuring for  
those on the eastern waters of the Mississippi  
friendly instead of hostile neighbors on its western  
waters, I do not view it as an Englishman would  
the procuring future blessings for the French na  
tion, with whom he has no relations of blood or  
affection. The future inhabitants of the Atlantic  
and Mississippi States will be our sons. We leave  
them in distinct but bordering establishments. We  
think we see their happiness in their union, and we  
wish it. Events may prove it otherwise; and if  
they see their interest in separation, why should we  
take side with our Atlantic rather than our Missis-  
sippi descendants? It is the older and the younger  
son differing. God bless them both, and keep them  
in Union if it be for their good, but sepacate them if  
it be better. The inhabited part of Louisiana, from  
Point Coupee to the sea, will of course be immedi  
ately a territorial government, and soon a state.  
But above that the best use we can make of the  
country for some time will be to give establishments  
in it to the Indians on the east side of the Missis  
sippi in exchange for their present country, and  
open land offices in the last, and thus make this ac­  
quisition the means of filling up the eastern side,

THE INDIAN COUNTRY.  
  
fe E modern idea of an Indian country —a  
scope of territory set apart for the occu-  
pancy of the abosiginal tribes — was first sug-  
gested by President Jefferson. As early as  
1803, referring to the then recent Louisiana  
purchase, he wrote: “ Above all, the best use  
we can make of the country for some time to  
come will be to give establishments in it to  
the Indians of the east side of the Mississippi  
in exchange for their present country, and  
open land-offices in the last, and thus make  
this acquisition a means of filling up the east-  
ern side instead of drawing off the population.  
When we shall be full on this side, we can lay  
off a range of States on the western bank from  
the head to the mouth, and so range after  
range, advancing compactly, as we multiply.”  
It will be observed that he did not recommend  
permanency as a feature of this movement; it  
was to be “ for some time” only, and subjec

&quot;The Constitution has made no provi­

rational than those of an ambitious and capricious nation  
like the French. Spain was destined to lose both of the

ultimately succeed in the acquisition of the Floridas, and  
was fully convinced of the vast importance of the Mississippi  
navigation. In a private letter to Breckenridge under the  
date of August 12, 1803, he wrote as follows: ‘“ Objections  
are raising to the eastward against the vast extent of our  
boundaries, and propositions are made to exchange Louisiana

Rio Norte or Bravo, and, better, to go eastwardly to the Rio
