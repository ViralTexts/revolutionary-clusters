Summary statement of the complaints of the French  
Republic, against the Government of the United States.  
1st Complaint.  
  
The inexecution of the Treaties.  
1. The courts of Justice of the United States have taken cognisance and still take cognisance of the prizes which our privateers conduct into their ports, notwithstanding the express  
  
clause of the Treaty against it. Our ministers have proposed various arrangements for limiting these usurpations. The federal Government had itself proposed measures on this subject—the first propositions were not accepted, and the latter measures fell into disuse. The disgusts, the delays, the losses resulting to our seamen from such a State of things, are palpable. They almost entirely deprive the Republic of the advantages which it should expect from this article of the Treaty.  
2. The admission of English ships of war, even in cases where they are excluded by the 17th article of the Treaty, that is, when they have made prizes on the Republic or on its citizens. The weakness with which the federal Government conceded this point in the first instance has increased the pretentions of Great Britain, and now the ports of the United States have become a station for the squadron of Admiral Murray, who for two years past has there victualled his Ships, in order to cruize on the american Commerce, and to pillage our property. This division carries its audacity even to the conducting thither its prizes.  
3. The Consular Convention, forming a part of our treaties, is equally unexecuted in its two most important clauses. The first granting to our Consuls the right of judging exclusively in disputes arising between frenchmen, is become illusory, for the want of laws giving to the Consuls the means of having their decisions executed. The consequence of this inability tends to annihilate the prerogative of our Consuls, and materially to injure the interest of our merchants. The second gives to our consuls the right of causing our mariners who desert to be arrested. The inexecution of this part of the Convention affects beyond all expression, our maritime service, during the stay of our vessels in the american ports. The Judges charged by the laws with issuing the mandates of arrest, have lately required the presentation of the original Roll of the Crew, in contempt of the 5th article, admitting in the Tribunals of both powers copies certified by the Consul. Local circumstances in a thousand instances oppose the production of the original Roll—and then the seamen are not liable to be apprehended.  
4th The arrestation in the port of Philadelphia, in the month of August 1795, of the Captain of the Corvette the Cassius, for acts committed by him on the high Seas. This is contrary to the 19. article of the treaty of commerce, which stipulates “That the  
  
Commanders of public, and of private vessels shall not be detained in any manner.” Besides it violates the most obvious law of nations, which places the Officers of public vessels under the safeguard of their Flag. The United States have had sufficient proofs of deference on the part of the Republic, to count upon its Justice in this instance. The Captain was imprisoned, notwithstanding the Consul of the Republic produced bail. Scarcely was he set at liberty, when the Corvette, altho’ very regularly armed at the Cape, by General Lavaux, was arrested (and it appears she is still so) under pretext, that, eight months before, she sailed from Philadelphia, suspected of having armed in that port.  
2d Complaint. The impunity of the outrage committed on the Republic in the person of its minister, the Citizen Fauchet by the English ship (Africa) in concert with the vice Consul of that nation.  
The arrestation in the waters of the United States of the Packet boat having Citizen Fauchet on board, the search made in the Trunks of that minister, with the avowed object of seizing his person and papers, merited an example. The insult was committed on the first of august 1795 (old style) the Ship all the rest of the month blocked up the medusa frigate belonging to the Republic at newport, and did not receive orders to depart till after the sailing of that vessel. For a new outrage on the United States by a menacing letter, the Exequatur was withdrawn from the Consul merely for having taken a part in the latter insult.  
3rd Complaint—The Treaty concluded in November 1794 between the United States and Great Britain. It will be easy to prove that the United States in this treaty have knowingly and evidently sacrificed their Connections with the Republic and the most essential and least contested prerogatives of neutrality.  
1st The United States, besides having departed from the principles established by the armed neutrality during the war for their independence, have given to England, to the detriment of their first allies, the most stirling mark of an unbounded condescension, by abandoning the limit given to contraband by the law of nations, by their treaties with all other nations, and even by those of England with the greater part of the maritime powers. Is it not evidently straying from the principles of neutrality to sacrifice exclusively to that power, the objects proper for the equipment and construction of vessels?  
  
2. They have gone still further. They have consented to extend the denomination of contraband even to Provisions. Instead of pointing out particularly, as all treaties do, the cases of the effective blockade of a place, as alone forming an exception to the freedom of this article—they have tacitly acknowledged the pretentions raised by England to create blockades in our Colonies and even in france by the force of a bare proclamation.  
This abandonment of the independence of their commerce, is incompatible with their neutrality. Mr Jefferson has himself acknowledged it in his letter of 7th September to the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London, on the subject of the order of the 8th of June 1793. From this confession—especially from all the tyranical Edicts of the King of Great Britain, from which the commerce of the United States as well as their national honor have suffered so much, a result quite different was hoped from Mr Jay’s negotiation. It is evident by the clause of the treaty limiting the existence of this desertion from neutrality to the duration of the present war, that Mr Jay did not hesitate to sacrifice our Colonies to Great Britain, during the r

6869)  
A ſummary Expoſition off the Complaints of the French Govern-  
ment againſt the Government ef the United States.  
  
Firſt COMPLAINT. The inexecution of treaties.  
  
1. The courts of juſtice in the United States have taken,  
and continue Guy to take, cognizance of prizes, which our  
privateers conduct into their ports, notwithſtanding the ex-  
  
  
ters have propoſed different arrangements to put bounds to  
  
  
meaſures in this reſpect: the firſt propoſitions were not ac-  
cepted, and the laſt meaſures have fallen into diſuſe. The  
diſguſts, the delays and the loſſes which reſult to our ma-  
rine, from a like ſtate of things, are palpable; they almoſt  
deprive the republic of the advantage it ought to derive from.  
this article of the treaty. |  
  
2. The admiſſion of Engliſh veſſels of war into the ports  
of the United States, againſt the expreſs ſtipulation of the  
17th article of the treaty; that is to ſay, when they have  
made prizes upon the republic, or its citizens. The weakneſs  
with which the federal government yielded this point in the  
beginning, tended to increaſe the pretenſions of Great Britain;  
ſo that, at preſent, the ports of the United States have be-  
come a ſtation for the ſquadron of admiral Murray; which  
for two years paſt has ſtationed there, to make excurſions  
thence upon the American commerce, and deſtroy our pro-  
  
  
The conſular convention, which makes a part of our  
treaties, is equally unexecuted in two of its moſt important  
clauſes ; the firſt, which grants to our conſuls the right of  
Judging excluſively all controverſies which take place be-  
tween French citizens, has become illuſory, from a defect  
in the law which gives to our conſuls the means of executing  
their judgments. The conſequences of this defect tend to  
annihilate the prerogatives of our conſuls, and by means  
thereof to injure eſſentially our merchants. The ſecond  
gives to our conſuls the right of arreſting our marine de-  
ſerters. The inexecution of this part of the convention  
affects, beyond all expreſſion, our maritime ſervice, whilſt  
our veſſels are ſtationed in the American ports. The judges  
charged by the law to deliver mandats of arreſt, have lately  
required the preſentation of the original regiſter of the equi-  
page, in deſpite of the 5th article of the treaty, which ad-  
mits in the tribunals of the two powers copies certified by -  
the conſuls. Particular local conſiderations oppoſe, in a  
  
1699 f  
  
thouſand circumſtances, the preſentation of the original re-  
giſter, and, under theſe circumſtances, the ſailors always  
make their eſcape. |  
4. The arreſtation in the port of Philadelphia, in the  
month of Auguſt 1795, of the captain of the corvette Caſ-  
fius, for an act committed by him on the high ſeas. This  
meaſure is contrary to the 19th article of the treaty of com-  
merce, which ſtipulates, © that the commandants of public  
and private veſſels ſhall not be detained in any manner.” It  
violates, moreover, the right of nations the moſt common,  
which puts the officers of public veſſels under the ſafeguard  
of their flag. The United States had ſufficient proof of the  
reſpect which the republic entertained for them, to have  
counted upon its juſtice upon this occaſion, The captain  
has been impriſoned, though the conſul of the republic ſup-  
ported the action, and with difficulty has he been releaſed, /  
The corvette, though regularly armed at the Cape by the  
general Lavaud, has been arreſted. (as it appears ſhe ſtill is)  
under the pretext, that eight months before the ſailed from  
Philadelphia, ſhe was ſuſpected of having been armed in that  
  
port.  
  
Second COMPLAINT. The impunity of the outrage made to  
the republic, in the perſon of its miniſter, the citizen Fau-  
chet, by the Engliſh veſſel the Africa, in concert with the  
vice-conſul of that nation.  
  
The arreſtation, in the waters of the United States, of the  
packet-boat in which the miniſter ſailed ; the ſearch made in  
his trunks, with the avowed object of ſeizing his perſon  
and his papers, merited an example. This inſult was com-  
mitted on the 1ſt of Auguſt 1795, and after which this veſſel  
(the Africa) blocked up the reit of that month, at Newport,  
the frigate Meduſa of the republic; nor was that veſſel or-  
dered to depart till after this frigate had failed, and which  
order was given for a new outrage committed againſt the  
United States by a menacing letter ; and for a participation  
in which laſt infalt, the exequatur of the Engliſh conſul was  
  
withdrawn.  
  
Third comPpLaint. The treaty concluded in November  
1794, between the United States and Great Britain, It  
would be eaſy to prove, that the United States, in that  
treaty, have {acrificed, knowingly and evidently, their con -  
nexion with the republic ; and the rights, the moſt efſen-  
tial and leaſt conteſted, of neutrality.  
  
1. The United States have not only departed from the  
  
  
6860  
  
principles that were conſecrated by the armed neutrality  
during the war of their independence; but they have alſo  
given to England, to the injury of their firſt allies, a mark  
the moſt ſtriking of a conde/cen/ion without limits, in aban-  
doning the rule, which the rights of nations, their treaties  
with all other powers, and. even the treaties of England  
with moſt of the maritime powers, have given to contra-  
band. To ſacrifice excluſively to this power, the objects  
which are neceſſary for the equipment and conſtruction of  
veſſels—is not this to depart evidently from the principles of  
neutrality ? i |  
  
2. But they have even gone further. They have con-  
ſented to extend the denomination of contraband even to  
  
  
only exception to the complete freedom of this article, they  
have tacitly acknowledged the pretenſions of England to  
extend the blockade to our colonies, and even to France, by  
the force of a proclamation alone. This abandonment of  
  
  
their neutrality, as Mr. Jefferſon has acknowledged by his  
letter of the 7th September, to the miniſter plenipotentiary  
of the United States at London, upon the ſubject of the or-  
der of the 8th June 1793. Aſter this confeſſion; after,  
above all, the tyrannical edicts of the king of Great Britain,  
whereby the commerce, as well as the national honour, of  
the United States have ſuffered ſo. much; there was reaſon  
to hope a different reſult from the negotiation of Mr. Jay.  
It is evident, by the clauſe which limits the continuance of  
this deſertion of neutrality to the term of this war, that  
  
  
Britain during the continuance of theſe hoſtilities, by which  
their lot wili be decided. It is ſubmitted ta Mr. Monroe to
