. when my last to you was dated I know not, for truely I can say, that my whole time is so much engross’d that I have scarce a moment (but sleeping ones) for relaxation, or to endulge myself in writing to a friend.  
The anxiety you have been under, on Acct of this Army, I can easily conceive; would to God there had been less Cause for it. or, that our Situation at present, was such, as to promise much from it. The Enemy crossed the Schuylkill—which, by the by, above the Falls (&amp; the Falls you know is only five Miles from the City) is as easily crossed in any place as Potomack Run, Aquia, or any other broad &amp; shallow Water—rather by stratagem; tho I do not know that it was in our power to prevent it, as their Manœuvres made it necessary for us to attend to our Stores which lay at Reading, towards which they seemd bending their course, &amp; the loss of which must have proved our Ruin—After they had crossed, we took the first favourable oppertunity of attacking them—this was attempted by a Nights March of fourteen Miles to surprize them (which we effectually did) so far as reaching their Guards before they had notice of our ⟨co⟩ming, and but for a thick Fog rendered so infinitely dark at times, as not to distinguish friend from Foe at the distance of 30 Yards, we should, I believe, have made a decisive &amp; glorious day of it. But Providence—or some unaccountable something, designd it otherwise; for after we had driven the Enemy a Mile or two, after they were in the utmost confusion, and flying before us in most places, after we were upon the point (as it appeard to every body) of grasping a compleat Victory, our own Troops took fright &amp; fled with precipitation and disorder. how to acct for this I know not, unless, as I before observd, the Fog represented their own Friends to them for a Reinforcement of the Enemy as we attacked in different Quarters at the sametime, &amp; were about closing the Wings of our Army when this happened. one thing indeed contributed not a little to our Misfortune, and that was want of Ammunition on the right wing, which began the Ingagement, and in the course of two hours and 40 Minutes which it lasted, had (many of them) expended the 40 Rounds which they took into the Field.  
After the Ingagement we removd to a place about 20 Miles from the Enemy, to collect our Force together—to take care of our Wounded—get furnished with necessaries again—&amp; be in a better posture, either for Offensive, or defensive operations. we are now advancing towards the Enemy again, being at this time within 12 Miles.

“When my last to you was dated I know not; for truly I can say, that my whole  
time is so much engrossed, that I have scarcely a moment, but sleeping ones, for  
relaxation, or to indulge myself in writing to a friend. The anxiety you have been  
under, on account of this army, I can easily conceive. Would to God there had  
been less cause for it; or that our situation at present was such as to promise much.  
The enemy crossed the Schuylkill (which, by the by, above the Falls is as easily  
crossed in any place as Potomac Run, Aquia, or any other broad, shallow water)  
rather by stratagem; though I do not know, that it was in our power to prevent it,  
as their manceuvres made it necessary for us to attend to our stores, which lay at  
Reading, towards which they seemed bending their course, and the loss of which  
must have proved our ruin. After they had crossed, we took the first favourable  
opportunity of attacking them.  
  
“ This was attempted by a night’s march of fourteen miles to surprise them, which  
we effectually did, so far as to reach their guards before they had notice of our  
coming; and if it had not been for a thick fog, which rendered it so dark at times  
that we were not able to distinguish friend from foe at the distance of thirty yards,  
we should, I believe, have made a decisive and glorious day of it. But Providence  
designed it otherwise; for after we had driven the enemy a mile or two, after they

upon the point, as it appeared to every body, of grasping a complete victory, our  
own troops took fright and fled with precipitation and disorder. How to account  
for this, I know not; unless, as I before observed, the fog represented their own  
friends to them for a reinforcement of the enemy, as we attacked in different quar-  
ters at the same time, and were about closing the wings of our army when this  
happened. One thing, indeed, contributed not a little to our misfortune, and that  
was a want of ammunition on the right wing, which began the engagement, and
