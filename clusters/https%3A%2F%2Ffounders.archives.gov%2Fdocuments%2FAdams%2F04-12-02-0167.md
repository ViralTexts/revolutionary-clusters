paper circulations, that they were in his

statistics occuples a more important place than  
that which exhibits the number, variety, and  
diffusion of newspapers and other periedicals.  
Composing as they do, a part of the reading of  
all, they furnsh nearly the whole of the read-  
ing which the greater number, whether from in  
clination or necessity, permit themselves to en  
joy, and it was in virtue of this fact that the  
ost philosophical British statesman signalized  
&quot;newspaper circulations&quot; as a more important  
instrument of the popular intelligonce than was  
generally imagined in his day. The writers of  
these papers, he added, &quot;are indeed for the  
greater part, either unknown or in contemgt,  
but they are like a battery in which the stroke  
of any ene ball produces no effect, but the  
amount of continued repetition is decisive. Let  
us only suffor any person to tell us his story,  
morning and evening, but for a twelvemonth,  
and he will become our master.
