Whereas GeorgeGuelph King of Great Britain &amp; Ireland and Elector of Hanover, heretofore entrusted with the exercise of the kingly office in this government, hath endeavored to pervert the same into a detestable &amp; insupportable tyranny  
  
by &lt;neg&gt; putting his negative on laws the most wholesome &amp; necessary for the public good  
by denying to his governors permission to pass laws of &lt;the most&gt; immediate &amp; pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation for his &lt;con&gt; assent &amp;, when so suspended, neglecting &lt;for m&gt; to attend to them for many years:  
by refusing to pass certain other laws, unless the persons to be benefited by them would relinquish the inestimable right&lt;s&gt; of representation in the legislature:  
by dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly &amp; continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people:  
when dissolved, by refusing to call others for a long space of time, thereby leaving the political system &lt;[in a state of dissolution]&gt; without any legislative &lt;body&gt; head.  
by endeavoring to prevent the population of our country &lt;by&gt; &amp; for that purpose obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners &amp; raising the conditions of new appropriati&lt;ng&gt;ons &lt;new&gt; of lands:  
by keeping among us in times of peace standing armies &amp; ships of war:  
by affecting to render the military independant of &amp; superior to the civil power:  
by combining with others to subject us to a foreign jurisdiction giving his &lt;con&gt; assent to their pretended acts of legislation &lt;for imposing taxes on us without our consent.&gt;  
for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  
for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:  
for &lt;depriving us of&gt; imposing taxes on us without our consent:  
for depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury:  
for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:  
for suspending our own legislatures &amp; declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever  
by plundering our seas, ravaging our coasts, burning our towns, &lt;des&gt; &amp; destroying the lives of our people:  
by inciting insurrections of our fellow subjects with the allurements of forfeiture &amp; confiscation  
by prompting our negroes to rise in arms among us; those very negroes whom by an inhuman use of his negative he hath &lt;from time to time&gt; refused us permission to exclude by law:  
by endeavoring to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an  undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, &amp; conditions &lt;of life&gt; of existence.  
by transporting at this time a large army of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, &amp; tyranny already begun &lt;in a stile&gt; with circumstances of cruelty &amp; perfidy so unworthy &lt;a&gt; the head of a civilized &lt;people&gt; nation  
by answering our repeated petitions &lt;against this repeated&gt; for redress with a repetition of injur&lt;y&gt;ies: &lt;with an accumulation of new injury&gt;  
and finally by abandoning the helm of government &lt;&amp;&gt; &amp; declaring us out of his allegiance &amp; protection.
