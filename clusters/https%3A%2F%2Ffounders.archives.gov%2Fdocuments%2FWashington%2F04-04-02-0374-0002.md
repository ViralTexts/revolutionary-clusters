Sir,  
Boston January 19th 1787—  
  
You will take the command of the Militia detached in obedience to my Orders of the fourth instant. The great objects to be effected are to protect the Judicial Courts, particularly those next to be holden in  
  
the County of Worcester, if the Justices of said Courts should request your aid; to assist the civil Magistrates in executing the Laws, and in repelling or apprehending all and every such person and persons as shall in a hostile manner attempt or enterprize, the destruction detriment or annoyance of this Commonwealth: and also to aid them in apprehending the disturbers of the public peace, as well as all such persons as may be named in the State Warrants, that have been, or shall be committed to any civil Officer or Officers, or to any other person to execute.  
If to these important ends the Militia already ordered out should in your opinion be incompetent, you will call on the Major Generals for further and effectual aid. If you can rely on their attachment to Government, you will in the first instance call on the Militia in the neighbourhood of your Camp.  
I cannot minutely point out to you the particular line you shall pursue in executing these Orders: but would observe in general, that if to answer the aforesaid valuable purposes you shall judge it necessary to march a respectable force through the Western Counties, you will in that case do it. This would give confidence to the well affected; would aid and protect the civil Officers in executing their duty, and would convince the misguided of the abilities of Government, and its determination to pursue every legal and constitutional measure for restoring peace and order to the Commonwealth.  
You are to consider yourself in all your military offensive operations constantly as under the direction of the civil Officer, saving where any armed force shall appear and oppose your marching to execute these Orders.  
That I may be fully acquainted with all the proceedings of the armed force under your command, and with all matters that respect the great objects to be effected, you will please to give me regular information by every post; and for immediate and necessary intelligence, you will order the Quarter Master General to provide the necessary expences.  
On these attempts to restore system and order, I wish the smiles of Heaven; and that you may have an agreeable command, the most perfect success, and a speedy and safe return; and am with much esteem, Sir, Your most obedient Servant James Bowdoin.

m to move the same night to Amherst about 20 miles North of Springfield. At 3 oClock of the morning of the 29th we moved towards Amherst, where Shays had been joined by Day. On our arrival in the borders of the town the rear of Shays’ force left it; some few fell into our hands. He then took post at Pelham East from Amherst: We filed off to the left, and took post in Hadley and Hatfield, on the River. He had now taken a very strong position. The ground he was well acquainted with, being the town in which he lived. On the morning of the 30th I sent him the following address.  
  
  
  
  
Head quarters Hadley Jan 30th 1787  
  
Whether you are convinced or not, of your error in flying to arms, I am fully persuaded, that before this hour, you have the fullest conviction on your own mind that you are not able to execute your original purposes.  
Your resources are few, your force is inconsiderable, and hourly decreasing from the disaffection of your men. You are in a post where you have neither cover nor supplies, and in a situation in which you can neither give aid to your friends, nor discomfort to the supporters of good order and government. Under these circumstances, you cannot hesitate a moment, to disband your deluded followers. If you should not, I must approach and apprehend the most influential characters among you. Should you attempt to fire upon the troops of government, the consequences might be fatal to many of your men the least guilty. To prevent bloodshed, you will communicate to your privates that if they will instantly lay down their arms, surrender themselves to government, and take and subscribe the oath of allegiance to this Commonwealth, they shall be recommended to the General Court for mercy. If you should either withhold this information from them, or suffer your people to fire upon our approach, you must be answerable for all the ills, which may exist in consequence thereof.  
To Capt. Shays &amp; the other Officers commanding the men in arms against the Government of this Commonwealth.  
  
  
  
  
This was delivered by General Putnam and two other Gentlemen, all of whom were of my family; and brought the same day the following answer.  
  
  
  
  
  
Pelham Jany 30th 1787—  
To General Lincoln Commanding the Government Troops at Hadley  
Sir  
  
The people Assembled in Arms from the Counties of Middlesex, Worcester, Hampshire &amp; Berkshire taking into serious Consideration the purport of the Flag just Received—  
Return for Answer, that however unjustifiable the measure may be, which the people have adopted, in having recourse to Arms, Various Circumstances have induced them thereto, we are Sensible of the Embarrasments the people are under, but that Virtue which truly Charaterises the Citizens of a Republican Government hath hitherto marked our paths with a Degree of Innocence, &amp; we wish &amp; trust it will still be the Case, at the same time the people are willing to lay down their Arms on the Condition of a General Pardon, and Return to their respective homes as they are unwilling to Stain the Land which we in the late war purchased at so dear a rate with the Blood of our Brethren and Neighbours, therefore we pray that Hostilities may Cease on your part untill our united Prayers may be presented to the General Court, &amp; we receive an Answer, as a person is gone for that purpose, if this Request may be complied with, Government shall meet with no interruption from the people, but let each Army Occupy the posts where they now are. Daniel Shays Capt.

, I have felt too sensibly for the distresses of those unhappy men who have been deluded to rise in arms against their Country, in violation of every principle of duty, not to have most seriously contemplated, how they might be reclaimed without bloodshed. Hitherto our men have been restrained from firing. Shays has been notified of his danger, and of the consequences which must ensue should he fire upon the troops of Government. His men have been invited to return to their homes, and lay down their arms. I hope they will attend to the advice.  
I think those Towns which sincerely wish to put an end to this rebellion, might render essential services in effecting so desirable an object. They should by their advice recall their men now in arms, they should aid in apprehending all abettors of them, and all who are yeilding them any comfort and supplies. This would reduce them to submission, and prevent the horrors so much feared.

The Honorable General Lincoln. Sir, as the officers of the People now Convened in Defence of their rights and Priveleges, have sent a Petition to the General Court for the sole Purpose of accomodation of our Present unhappy affairs, we justly expect, that the Hostilities May cease on both sides untill we have a return from our Legislature.

Gentlemen, Your request is totally inadmissible, as no powers are delegated to me which would justify a delay of my operations. Hostilities I have not commenced.  
I have again to warn the people in arms against Government, immediately to disband, as they would avoid the ill consequences which may ensue, should they be inattentive to this caution.

vening of the same day, I was informed that Shays had left his ground, and had pointed his rout toward Petersham in the County of Worcester, where he intended to make a stand as a number of Towns in the vicinity had engaged to support him. Our troops were put in motion at 8 o Clock. The first part of the night was pleasant, and the weather clement; but between two and three o Clock in the morning, the wind shifting to the Westward, it became very cold and squally, with considerable snow. The wind immediately arose very high, and with the light snow which fell the day before and was falling, the paths were soon filled up, the men became fatigued, and they were in a part of the country where they could not be covered in the distance of eight miles, and the cold was so increased, that they could not halt in the road to refresh themselves. Under these circumstances they were obliged to continue their march. We reached Petersham about 9 o Clock in the morning exceedingly fatigued with a march of  
  
thirty miles, part of it in a deep snow and in a most violent storm; when this abated, the cold increased and a great proportion of our men were frozen in some part or other, but none dangerously. We approached nearly the centre of the Town where Shays had covered his men; and had we not been prevented from the steepness of a large hill at our entrance, and the depth of the snow from throwing our men rapidly into it we should have arrested very probably one half this force; for they were so surprized as it was that they had not time to call in their out-parties, or even their guards. About 150 fell into our hands, and none escaped but by the most precipitate flight in different directions.  
Thus that body of men who were a few days before offering the grossest insults to the best

f blood but in an instance or two where the Insurgents rushed on their own destruction. That so little has been shed is owing in a measure to the patience and obedience, the zeal and the fortitude in our troops, which would have done honour to veterans. A different line of conduct which Shays flattered his troops would have been followed, would have given them support, and led them to acts of violence, whilst it must have buoyed up the hopes of their abettors, and stimulated them to greater exertions.
