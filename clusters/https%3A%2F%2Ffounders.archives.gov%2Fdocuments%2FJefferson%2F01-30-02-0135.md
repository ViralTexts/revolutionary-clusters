I have to acknolege the receipt of your two favors of June 21. &amp; July 15. &amp; of several [separate] parcels of the Agricultural reports. these now form a great mass of information on a s[ubject] of all in the world the most interesting to man; for none but the husbandman makes any thing [for him] to eat, &amp; he who can double his food, as your exertions bid fair to do, deserves to rank, [among his] benefactors, next after his creator. among so many reports of transcendent merit, [one is un]willing to distinguish particulars: yet the application of the new chemistry to the subject of manur[es, the] discussion of the question on the [size] of farms, the [treatise on the potatoe, from] their universality, have an advantage in other countries [over] those [which are topographical.] the work which shall be formed as the result of the whole [we shall ex]pect with impatience. Permit me, through you, to make here my acknowlegements to the board of Agriculture for the honor they have  been pleased to confer on me, by [associating me to their institution. in] love for the art which gives bread to man, &amp; virtue [to him] who makes it I am truly their [associate;] but even[ts have co]ntrouled my [predilection for it’s practice,] and denied to me that [uninterr]upted attention which alone can enable [us to advance in it with a sure step. perhaps] I may find opportunities of being useful to you as a centinel [at an outpost], by conveying intelligence of whatever may [occur] here [new &amp; interesting to agriculture. this duty I] shall perform with pleasure; as well in [respectful] return for the notice of the board, [as from] a zeal for improving the condition of human life by an interchange of it’s comforts &amp; of the information which may [increase them].

fit cannot be less than the trouble of mentioning them.  
In a former letter to you I mentioned the construction of the mould board of a plough, which had occurred to me, as advantageous in it’s form, as certain &amp; invariable in the method of obtaining it with precision. I remember that mr Strickland of York, a member of your board, was so well satisfied with the principles on which it was formed that he took some drawings of it; and many others have considered it with the same approbation. an experience of 5. years has enabled me to say it answers in practice to what it promises in theory. the mould board should be a continuation of the wing of the ploughshare, beginning at it’s hinder edge and in the same plane. it’s first office is to recieve the sod horizontally from the wing, to raise it to a proper height for being turned over, &amp; to make in it’s progress the least resistance possible, &amp; consequently to require a minimum in the moving power. were this it’s only office, the wedge would offer itself as the most   
  
* I am aware that, were the turf only to be raised to a given height in a given length of mouldboard, &amp; not to be turned over, the form of least resistance would not be rigorously a wedge with both faces strait, but with the upper one curved according to the laws of the solid of least resistance described by the mathematicians. but the difference between the effect of the curved &amp; of the plain wedge, in the case of a mouldboard, is so minute, &amp; the difficulty in the execution which the former would superinduce on common workmen is so great, that the plain wedge is the most eligible to be assumed in practice for the first basis of our construction.  
  
eligible form in practice. but the sod is to be turned over also. to do this, the one edge of it is not to be raised at all: for to raise this would be a waste of labor. the other edge is to be raised till it passes the perpendicular, that it may fall over with it’s own weight. and that this may be done, so as to give also the least resistance, it must be made to rise gradually from the moment   the sod is recieved. the mould board then, in this second office, operates as a transverse or rising wedge, the point of which sliding back horizontally on the ground, the other end continues rising till it passes the perpendicular. or, to vary the point of view, place on the ground a wedge of the breadth of the ploughshare, of it’s length from the wing backwards, &amp; as high at the heel as it is wide. draw a diagonal on it’s upper face from the left angle at the point to the right upper angle of the heel. bevil the [face] from the diagonal to the right bottom edge which lies on the ground. that half is then evidently in the best form for performing the two offices of raising &amp; turning the sod gradually, &amp; with the least effort: &amp; if you will suppose the same bevil continues on the left side of the diagonal, that is, if you will suppose a strait line, whose length is at least equal to the breadth of the wedge, applied on the face of the first bevil, and moved backwards on it, parallel with itself &amp; with the ends of the wedge, the lower end of the line moving along the right bottom edge, a curved plane will be generated whose characteristic will be a combination of the principle of the wedge in cross directions, &amp; will give what we seek, the mould-board of least resistance. it offers too this great advantage that it may be made by the coarsest workman, by a process so exact, that it’s form shall never be varied a single hair’s breadth. one fault of all other mouldboards is that, being copied by the eye, no two will be alike. in truth it is easier to form the mouldboard I speak of with precision, when the method has been once seen, than to describe that method either by words or figures. I will attempt however to describe it. whatever may not be intelligible from the description may be supplied from the model I send you.  
Let the breadth &amp; depth of the furrow the farmer usually opens, as also the length of his plough-bar, from where it joins the wing to the hinder end, be given; as these fix the dimensions of the block of which the mould-board is to be made. suppose the furrow [9]. Inches wide, 6. Inches deep, &amp; the plough bar 2. feet long. the block Fig. 1. must be 9. I. wide at bottom, (b.c.) 13½ I. wide at top (a.d.) because if it were merely of the same width with the bottom (as a.e.) the sod, only raised to the perpendicular, would fall back into the furrow by it’s own elasticity. I find from experience that the top of the mould-board should over-jet the perpendicular 4½ I. to ensure that the weight of the sod shall preponderate over it’s elasticity. the block must be 12. I. high, because, unless the mouldboard be in height double the depth of the furrow, in ploughing friable earth, it will be thrown in waves over the mouldboard. and it must be 3. feet long, one foot of which is added to form a tailpiece, by which it may be made fast to the plough handle. the first operation is to  give the first form to this tailpiece, by sawing the block (Fig. 2.) across from a. to b. on it’s left side, which is 12. Inches from it’s hinder end, along the line b.c. to c. within 1½ Inch of the right side; &amp; to the corresponding point in the bottom, 1½ Inch also from the side. then saw in again at the hinder end from d.e. (1½ I. from the right side) along the line d.c. the block a.b.c.d.e.f.g. drops out, &amp; leaves the tail-piece c.d.e.h.i.k. 1½ I. thick. the fore part of the block a.b.c.k. l.m.n. is what is to form the real mould-board. with a carpenter’s square, make a scribe all round the block at every inch. there will of course be 23. of them. then from the point k. Fig. 2. &amp; 3. draw the diagonals k.m. on the top, &amp; k.o. Fig. 3. on the right side. enter a saw at the point m. being the left-fore-upper corner, &amp; saw in, guiding the hinder part of the saw along the diagonal m.k. (Fig. 2.3.) &amp; the fore part down the left edge of the block at the fore-end m.l. (Fig. 2) till it reaches k. &amp; 1. in a strait line. it will then have reached the true central diagonal of the block. then [enter the saw at the point o.] being the right fore-bottom corner, &amp; saw in, guiding the hinder part of the saw along the diagonal o.k. Fig. 3. &amp; the fore part along the bottom edge of the fore-end o.l. till it again reaches k.l. the same central diagonal to which you had cut in the other direction. consequently the pyramid k.m.n.o.l. Fig. 4. drops out &amp; leaves the block in the form Fig. 5. you will now observe that if, in the last operation, instead of stopping the saw at the central diagonal k.l. we had cut through the block in the same plane, we should have taken off a wedge l.m.n.o.k.b. Fig. 3. &amp; left the block in the form of a wedge also l.o.k.b.a.p.k. which, when speaking of the principle of the mould board, I observed would be the most perfect form, if it had only to raise the sod. but as it is to be turned over also, the left half of the upper wedge is left on, to furnish on the left side the continuation of the bevil which was proposed to be made on the right half of the bottom edge. we are now to proceed to this bevil; for which purpose the scribes round the block were formed, before the pyramidal piece was taken out; &amp; attention must be used not to mismatch or mistake them now that they are disjoined by the withdrawing of that piece. enter the saw on the two points of the 1st. scribe, where it has been disjoined, which is exactly where it intersected the two superficial diagonals, &amp; saw across the hollow of the block, guiding the saw both  before &amp; behind along the same scribe, till the fore-part of the saw reaches the bottom edge of the right side &amp; the middle of the saw reaches the central diagonal; the hinder part will of course continue the same strait line, which will issue somewhere on the top of the block. then enter the saw in like manner on the two projecting points of the 2d. scribe, &amp; saw in, along the scribe before [&amp;] behind, till it reaches the same bottom edge of the right side, &amp; the central diagonal.  then the 3d. 4th. 5th. &amp;c. scribes successively. after cutting in several of the earlier scribes, the hinder part of the saw will issue at the left side of the block, &amp; all the scribes being cut, the saw will have left strait lines from the bottom edge of the right side of the block across the central diagonal. with an adze dub off all the sawed parts to the bottoms of the saw marks, just leaving the traces visible, and the face of the mouldboard is finished. These traces will shew how the cross wedge rises gradually on the face of the direct wedge, which is preserved in the central diagonal. a person may represent to himself sensibly and easily the manner in which the sod is raised on this mouldboard, by describing on the  ground a parallelogram 2. feet long and 9 inches broad, as a.b.c.d. then rest one end of a stick 27½ I. long on the ground at b. &amp; raise the other 12 I. high at e. which is 4½ I. from d. &amp; represents the overhanging of that side of the mouldboard. then present another stick 12 I. long from a. to b. and move it backwards parallel with itself from a.b. to d.c. keeping one end of it always on the line a.d. and letting the other rise, as it recedes, along the diagonal stick b.e. which represents our central diagonal. the motion of the cross stick will be that of our rising wedge, &amp; will shew how every transverse line of the sod is conducted from it’s first horizontal position, till it is raised so far beyond the perpendicular as to fall reversed by it’s own weight. But, to return to our work. we have still to form the underside of the mouldboard. turn the block bottom up. enter the saw on the 1st. scribe, at what was the bottom edge of the left side, &amp; cut in, guiding the instrument at both ends by the scribe, till it has approached within an inch, or any other distance according to the thickness you chuse, of the face. then cut in like manner all the other scribes, &amp;, with the adze dub out the sawed parts, &amp; the mouldboard is done.It is to be made fast to the plough by resting the toe in the hinder edge of the wing, which must be made double, like a comb case, to recieve &amp; protect the fore-end of the mouldboard. then pass a screw through the mouldboard &amp; helve of the plough-share where they touch each other, and two others through the tailpiece of the mouldboard, and right handle of the plough, &amp; cut  off so much of the tailpiece as projects behind the handle, diagonally, &amp; the whole is done.  
I have described this operation in it’s simplest mode that it might be the more easily understood. but, in practice, I have found some other modifications of it advantageous. thus instead of first forming my block as a.b.c.d. Fig. 7.  where ab. is 12. I. &amp; the angle at b. a right one, I cut a wedge like piece b.c.e. off of the bottom through the whole length of the block, b.e. being equal to the thickness of the bar of the share (suppose 1½ I.) because,  the face of the wing declining from the top of the bar to the ground, were the block laid on the share, without an equivalent bevil at it’s bottom, the side a.b. would decline from the perpendicular, and a.d. from it’s horizontal position. again, instead of leaving the top of the block [13½] I. wide from m. to n. Fig. 8. I cut a wedge from the right side n.k.i.c.p.n. 1½ I. thick at top and tapering to nothing at bottom; because I find that the tail-piece, being by this means made oblique, as c.i. instead of k.i. is brought more advantageously to the side of the handle. the first superficial diagonal is consequently brought from m. to c. &amp; not from m. to k. as in the first directions. these variations will be seen in the models accompanying this, &amp; will be easy to any one after understanding the general principle. the models represent the block in the different stages of the operation, &amp; the mould-board as ultimately formed. While these mouldboards have been under trial, &amp; essays have been making of greater or less projections for the upper right edge of the block, &amp; of different heights in proportion to the depth of the furrow, I have continued to make them of wood. but now satisfied by a sufficient experience that, for a furrow of 9. I. by 6. I. the dimensions I have stated are the best, I propose to have the mould-board made of cast iron.  
I am sensible that this description may be thought too lengthy &amp; elaborate for a subject which has rarely been deemed worthy the application of science. but if the plough be in truth the most useful of the instruments known to man, it’s perfection cannot be an idle speculation. and in any case whatever, the combination of a theory which may satisfy the learned, with a practice intelligible to the most unlettered laborer, will be acceptable to the two most useful classes of society. Be this as it may, from the widow her mite only was expected. I have contributed according to my poverty: others will from their abundance. none so much as yourself who have been the animating principle of the institution from it’s first germ. when I contemplate the extensive good  which the proceedings under your direction are calculated to produce, I cannot but deplore every possibility of their interruption. I am fixed in awe at the mighty conflict to which two great nations are advancing, and recoil with horror at the ferociousness of man. will nations never devise a more rational umpire of differences than force? are there no means of coercing injustice more gratifying to our nature than a waste of the blood of thousands, &amp; of the labor of millions of our fellow-creatures? we see numerous societies of men (the aboriginals of this country) living together without the acknolegement of either laws or magistracy. yet they live in peace among themselves, &amp; acts of violence &amp; injury are as rare in their societies as in nations which keep the sword of the law in perpetual activity. public reproach, a refusal of common offices, interdiction of the commerce &amp; comforts of society are found as effectual as the coarser instruments of force. nations, like these individuals, stand towards each other only in [the] relations of natural right. might they not, like them, be peaceably punished for violence &amp; wrong? wonderful has been the progress of human improvement in other lines. let us hope then that that law of nature which makes a virtuous conduct produce benefit, &amp; vice loss to the agent, in the long run, which has dictated the common principle that honesty is the best policy, will in time influence the proceedings of nations as well as of individuals: &amp; that we shall at length be sensible that war is an instrument entirely inefficient towards redressing wrong; that it multiplies, instead of indemnifying, losses. had the money which has been spent in the present war been employed in making roads, &amp; conducting canals of navigation &amp; irrigation through the country, not a hovel in the remotest corner of the highlands of Scotland, or mountains of Auvergne, would have been without a boat at it’s door, a rill of water in every field, and a road to it’s market town. had the money we have lost by the lawless depredations of all the belligerent powers been employed in the same way, what communications would have been opened of roads &amp; waters! yet were we to go to war for redress, instead of redress, we should plunge deeper into loss, &amp; disable ourselves for half a century more from attaining the same end. a war would cost us more than would cut through the isthmus of Darien; and that of Suez might have been opened by what a single year has seen thrown away on the rock of Gibraltar. these truths are palpable, &amp; must in the progress of time have their influence on the minds &amp; conduct of nations. an evidence that we are advancing towards a better state of things may be gathered from the public patronage of your labors, which tend eminently to ameliorate the condition of man. that they may meet the success they merit I sincerely pray; &amp; that yourself may recieve the patriot’s best reward, the applauding voice of present &amp;  future times. accept, I beseech you, mine, with assurances of the sentiments [of] great &amp; sincere respect &amp; esteem with which I have the honor to be Dear Sir  
Your most obedient &amp; most humble servt.

Dear Sir,  
  
Read Moy | have to acknowledge the receipt of your two fa-  
  
4, 179% A vours of June 21, and July 15, and of feveral  
feparate parcels containing the agricultural reports. Thefe  
now form a great mafs of information on a fubje@, of all  
in the world, the moft interefting to man: for none but the  
hufbandman makes any thing for him to eat; and he who  
can double his food, as your exertions bid fair to do, de-  
ferves to rank, among his benefa¢tors, next after his Crea-  
tor. Among fo many reports of tranfcendent merit, one is  
unwilling to diftinguith particulars. Yet the application of  
the new chemiftry, to the fubje&amp; of manures, the difcuffion  
of the queftion on the fize of farms, the treatife on the po-  
tatce, from their univerfality have an advantage in other  
countries over thofe which are topographical. The work  
which fhall be formed, as the refult of the whole, we fhall  
expect with impatience.  
  
Permit me, through you, to make here my acknowledg-  
ments to the board of agriculture for the honour they have  
been pleafed to confer on me by, affociating me to their in-  
ftitution. In love for the art, I amtruly their affociate:  
but events have controuled my predilection for its practice,  
and denied to me that uninterrupted attention, which alone  
can enable us to advance in it witha fure ftep. Perhaps I  
may find opportunities of being ufeful to you as a centinel  
at an outpoft, by conveying intelligence of whatever may  
occur here new and interefting to agriculture. This duty I  
fall perform with pleafure, as well in refpectful return for the

In a former letter to you I mentioned the conftrution  
of the mould-board of a plough which had occurred to me,  
as advantageous in its form, as certain and invariable in  
the method of obtaining it with precifion. 1 remember  
that Mr. Strickland of York, a member of your board,  
was fo well fatisfted with the principles on which it was  
formed that he took fome drawings of it. and fome others  
have confidered it with the fame approbation. An experi-  
ence of five years has enabled me to fay, it anfwers in  
practice to what it promifes in theory. The mould-board  
fhould be a continuation of the wing of the ploughthare,  
beginning at its hinder edge, and in the fame plane. Its  
firft office is to receive the fod horizontally from the wing,  
to raife it to a proper height for being turned over, and  
to make, in its progrefs, the leaft refiftence pofible; and  
confequently to require a minimum in the moving power.  
Were this its only office, the wedge would offer itfelf as  
the moft * eligible form in practice. But the fod is to be  
turned over alfo. To do this, the one edge of it is not  
to be raifed at all ; for to raife this would be a wafte of  
labour. ‘The other edge is to be raifed till it paffes the  
  
perpendicular,  
  
* Iam aware that were the turf only to be raifed to a given height in a  
given length of mould-board, and not to be turned over, the form of leaft  
refiftence would not be rigoroufly a wedge with both faces ftraight, but with  
the upper one curved according to the laws of the folid of leaft refiftence  
defcribed by the mathematicians. But the difference between the effect of  
the curved and of the plain wedge, in the cafe of a mould-board, is fo  
minute, and the difficulty in the execution which the former would fuperin-  
duce on common workmen is fo great, that the plain wedge is the moft eli-  
gible to be aflumed in practice for the firft element of our conftruction.

perpendicular, that it may fall over with its own weight.  
And that this may be done fo as to give alfo the leaft re-  
fiftence, it muft be made to rife gradually from the mo-  
ment the fod is received. ‘The mould-board then, in this  
fecond office, operates as a tranfverfe, or rifing wedge, the  
point of which fliding back horizontally on the ground,  
the other end continues rifing till it pafles the perpendi-  
cular. Or, to vary the point of view, place on the  
ground a wedge of the breadth of the ploughfhare, of its  
length from the wing backwards, and as high at the heel  
as it is wide. Draw a diagonal on its upper face from the  
left angle at the point to the right upper angle of the heel.  
Bevil the face from the diagonal to the right-bottom-edge  
which lies on the ground. That half is then evidently in  
the beft form for performing the two offices of raifing and  
turning the fod gradually, and with the leaft effort: and  
if you will fuppofe the fame bevil continued acrofs the  
left fide of the diagonal, that is, if you will fuppofea  
ftraight line whofe length is at leaft equal to the breadth of  
the wedge, applied on the face of the farft bevil and  
moved backwards on-it parallel with itfelf and with the  
ends of the wedge, the lower end of the line moving  
along the right-bottom-edge, a curved plane will be gene-  
rated, whofe charateriftic will be a combination of the  
principle of the wedge in crofs dire€tions, and will give  
what we feek, the mou/d-board of leaft refiftence. It offers  
too this great advantage, that it may be made by the  
coarfeft workman, by a procefs fo exa&amp; that its form thall  
never be varied a fingle hair’s breadth. One fault of all  
other mould-boards is that, being copied by the eye, no  
two will be alike. In truth it is eafier to form the mould-  
board I fpeak of with precifion, when the method has  
been once feen, than to defcribe that method either by  
words or figures. I will attempt however to defcribe  
it. Whatever may not be intelligible from the defcrip-  
tion may be fupplied from the model I fend you.

316 DESCRIPTION or a MOULD-BOARD.  
  
Let the breadth and depth of the furrow the farmer  
ufually opens, as alfo the length of his plough-bar, from  
where it joins the wing to the hinder end, be given ; as  
thefe fix the dimenfions of the bleck of which the mould-  
board is to be made. Suppofe the furrow 9g inches wide,  
6 inches deep, and the plough-bar 2 feet long. Then  
the block, Fig. 1. muft be g inches |wide at bottom (4. c.)  
134 inches wide at top, (a. d.) becaufe if it were merely  
of the fame width with the bottom as a. e. the fod, only  
raifed to the perpendicular, would fall back into the fur-  
row by its own elafticity. 1 find from experience, that,  
in my foil, the top of the mould-board fhould overjet the  
perpendicular 44 inches in a height of 12 inches, to  
infure that the weight of the fod fhall preponderate over  
its elafticity. This is an angle of nearly 22°. The block  
muft be 12 inches high, becaufe, unlefs the mould-board  
be in height double the depth of the furrow, in plough-  
ing friable earth, it will be thrown in waves over the mould-  
board: and it muft be 3 feet long, one foot of which is  
added to form a tail-piece, by which it may be made faft  
to the plough-handle. The firft operation is to give the  
firft form to this tail-piece, by fawing the block, Fig. 2.  
acrofs from a. 4. on its left fide, (which is 12 inches  
from its hinder end) along the line 4. ¢. to c. within 14  
inches of the right fide, and to the correfponding point in  
the bottom, 14 inches alfo from the fide. Then faw in  
again at the hinder end from d@. e. (14 inches from the  
right fide) along the line d.c. The block 2. 4c. de. f.  
g. drops out and leaves the tail-piece c. d. ¢. b. 7. . 14  
inches thick. The fore part of the block a. 4. c. 2. 1m. n.  
is what is to form the real mould-board. With a car-  
penter’s {quare make a fcribe all round the block at every  
inch. There will of courfe be 23 of them. Then from  
the point 4. Fig. 2. and 3. draw the diagonals 4. m. on the  
top, and &amp;. o, Fig. 3. on the right fide. Enter a faw bs

guiding the hinder part of the faw along the diagonal o. 2.  
(Fig 3.) and the fore part along the bottom edge of the  
fore end o. /. till it again reaches &amp; /. Fig. 5. the fame  
central diagonal to which you had cut in the other direc-  
tion. Confequently the pyramid &amp; m. n. 0. 1. Fig. 4.  
drops out and leaves the block*in the form Fig. 5. You  
will now obferve that if in the laft operation, inftead of  
ftopping the faw at the central diagonal &amp;. 2. we had cut  
through the block in the fame plane, we fhould have taken  
off a wedge /. m. n.o. k. b. Fig. 3. and left the block in  
the form of a wedge alfo /. 0. &amp;. b. a. p. k. which, when  
{peaking of the principle of the mould-board, I obferved  
would be the moft perfe&amp; form if it had only to raife the  
fod. but asit is to be turned over alfo, the left half of  
the upper wedge is preferved, to furnifh on the left fide,  
the continuation of the bevil which was propofed to be  
made on the right half of the bottom wedge. We are now  
to proceed to the bevil, for which purpofe the fcribes  
round the block were formed before the pyramidal piece  
was taken out; and attention muft be ufed not to mifmatch  
or miftake them, now that they are disjoined by the with-  
drawing of that piece. Enter the faw on the two points  
of the 1ft fcribe where it has been disjoined, which is  
exactly where it interfeted the two fuperficial diagonals,  
and faw acrofs the hollow of the block, guiding the faw,  
both before and behind, along the fame {fcribe, till the  
fore part of the faw reaches the bottom edge of the right  
fide, and the middle of the faw reaches the central oe

the hinder part will of courfe continue the fame ftraight  
line, which will ifflue fomewhere on the top of the block.  
Then enter the faw in like manner on the two projecting  
points of the 2d fcribe, and faw in, along the fcribe, be-  
fore and behind, till it reaches the fame bottom edge of  
the right fide, and the central diagonal. Then the 3d,  
4th, sth, &amp;c. fcribes fucceflively. After cutting in fe-  
veral of the earlier fcribes, the hinder part of the faw  
will iffue at the left fide of the block, and all the fcribes  
being cut, the faw will have left ftraight lines from the  
bottom edge of the right fide of the block, acrofs the cen-  
tral diagonal. With an adze dub off all the fawed parts  
to the bottoms of the faw-marks, juft leaving the traces  
vilible, and the face of the mould-board is finifhed.  
Thefe traces will fhew how the crofs wedge rifes gradually  
on the face of the dire&amp;t wedge, which is preferved in  
trace of the central diagonal. A perfon may reprefent  
to himfelf, fenfibly and eafily the manner in which the fod  
is raifed on this mould-board, by defcribing on the grouad  
a parallelogram 2 feet long and g inches broad, as a. 6. c. d.  
Fig. 6. then reft one end of a ftick 274 mches long on  
the ground at 4..and raife the other 12 inches high at e.  
which is 44 inches from d, and reprefents the overhang-  
ing of that fide of the mould-board. Then prefent  
another ftick 12 inches long from a. to d and move  
it backwards parallel with itfelf from a. 4. to d. c. keeping  
one end of it always on the line a. d. and letting the other  
rife as it recedes along the diagonal ftick 4. e. which re-  
prefents our central diagonal. The motion of the crofs  
ftick will be that of our rifing wedge, and will fhew how  
every tranfverfe line of the fod is condudted from its firft  
horizontal pofition, till it is raifed fo far beyond the per-  
pendicular as to fall reverfed by its own weight. But to  
return to our work. We have ftill to form the under fide  
  
of the mould-board. Turn the block bottom up. Enter  
the

the faw.on the rift fcribe, at what was the bottom edge of  
the left fide, and cut in, guiding the inftrument at both  
ends by the fcribe, till it has approached within an inch,  
or any other diftance according to the thicknefs you choofe,  
of the face. Then cut in like manner all the other {cribes,  
and with the adze dub out the fawed parts, and the mould-  
board is done. It is to be made faft to the plough by reft-  
ing the toe in the hinder edge of the wing, which mutt  
be made double like a comb-cafe, to receive and protect  
the fore end of the mould-board. ‘Then pafs a fcrew  
through the mould-board and helve of the ploughthare  
where they touch eachother, and two others through the  
tail-piece of the mould-board and right handle of the  
plough, and cut off fo much of the tail-piece as projects  
behind the handle, diagonally, and the whole is done.  
  
I have defcribed this operation in its fimpleft mode, that  
it might be the more eafily underftood. But, in prattice,  
I have found fome other modifications of it advantageous.  
Thus, inftead of firft forming my block as a. 4. c. d.  
Fig. 7. where a. 5. is 12 inches, and the angle at 4. a right  
one, I cut a wedge-like piece 4. c. e. off of the bottom  
through the whole length of the block, 4. ¢. being equal  
to the thicknefs of the bar of the thare (fuppofe 11 inches)  
becaufe the face of the wing declining from the top of  
the bar to the ground, were the block laid on the thare,  
without an equivalent bevil at its bottom, the fide a. d.  
would decline from the perpendicular, and a. d. from its  
horizontal pofition. Again, inftead of leaving the top of  
the block 134 inches wide from m. to 7. Fig: 8. 1 cut a  
wedge from the right fide 2. 4.2. ¢. p.m. 14:inches thick  
at top and tapering to nothing at bottom; becaufe I  
find that the tail-piece, being by this means made ob-  
lique, as c. 7 inftead of &amp; i is brought more advan-  
tageoufly to the fide of the handle. The firft fuper-  
ficial diagonal is confequently brought from m, toc and  
not

not from m. to &amp; as in the firft directions. Thefe vari-  
ations will be eafy to any one after underftanding the  
general principle. While thefe mould-boards have been  
under trial, and eflays have been making of greater or lets  
projections for the upper right edge of the block, and of  
different heights in proportion to the depth of the furrow,  
I have continued to make them of wood. But now fatis-  
fied by a fufficient experience, that for a furrow of g by 6  
inches, the dimenfions | have ftated are the beft, I pro-  
pofe to have the mould-board made of caft iron.  
  
l am fenfible that this defcription may be thought too  
lengthy and elaborate for a fubje&amp;t which has hardly been  
deemed worthy the application of {cience. But if the plough  
be in truth the moft ufeful of the inftruments known to  
man, its perfe€tion cannot be an idle fpeculation. And in  
any cafe whatever, the combination of a theory which may  
fatisfy the learned, witha praéfice intelligible to the moft  
unlettered labourer, will be acceptable to the two moft ufe-  
ful claffes of fociety. Be this as it may, from the widow  
her mite only was expected. 1 have contributed according  
to my poverty; others will from their abundance.—None  
{fo much as yourfelf, who have been the animating principle  
of the inftitution from its firft germ. When | contemplate  
the extenfive good which the proceedings under your di-  
rection are calculated to produce, I cannot but deplore every  
pofhibility of their interruption. 1 am fixed in awe at the  
mighty confli€t to which two great nations are advancing,  
and recoil with horror at the ferocioufnefs of man. Will  
nations never devife a more rational umpire of differences  
than force? Are there no means of coercing injuftice more  
gratifying to our nature than a wafte of the blood of thou-  
fands, and of the labour of millions of our fellow-crea-  
tures? We fee numerous focieties of men (the aborigi-  
nals of this country) living together without the acknow-  
ledgment of either laws or magiftracy. Yet they live in  
  
peace  
  
  
  
DESCRIPTION or « MOULD-BOARD, — 321  
  
peace among themfelves, and acts of violence and injury  
- are as rare in their ‘focieties as in nations which keep the  
{word of the law in perpetual activity. Public, reproach,  
a refufalof common offices, interdiction of the commerce  
and comforts of. fociety ,are found as effectual as. the  
coarfer inftrument. of force... Nations, like thefe indivi-  
duals, ftand towards each other only in the. relations of  
natural right. Might they not, like them, be peaceably _  
punifhed for violence and wrong? Wonderful has been  
the progrefs of human improvement in other lines. Let  
us hope then that that law of nature which makes a virtu-  
ous condué&amp; produce benefit, and vice lofs, to the agent in  
the long run, which has fanétioned the common principle  
that honefty is the beft policy, will in time influence the  
proceedings of nations as well as of individuals; and that  
we fhall at length be fenfible that war is an inftrument  
entirely inefficient towards redrefling wrong ; that it mul-  
tiplies inftead of indemnifying lofles. Had the money  
which has been fpent in the prefent war been employed in  
making roads and condu@iing canals of navigation and ir-  
rigation through the country, not a hovel in the remoteft  
corner of the Highlands of Scotland, or mountains of  
Auvergne, would have been without a boat at its door, a  
rill of water in every field, and a road to its market town.  
Had the money we have loft by the lawlefs depredations  
of all the belligerent powers been employed in the fame  
way, what communications would have been opened of  
roads and waters! Yet were we to go to war for redrefs,  
inftead of redrefs, we fhould plunge deeper into lofs, and  
difable ourfelves for half a century more from attaining  
the fame end. A war would coft us more than would  
cut through the ifthmus of Darien; and. that.of Suez  
might have been opened with what a fingle year has feen  
thrown away on the rock of Gibraltar. Thefe truths are  
palpable, and muft in the progrefs of time have their in-

of man. That they may meet the fuccefs they merit, I  
fincerely pray, and that yourfelf may receive the patriot’s

Philadelphia, March 23, 1798.  
Dear Sir,  
Read Moy J have to acknowledge the receipt of your two fa  
4, 1798. A vours of June 21, and July 15, and of feveral  
feparate parcels containing the agricultural reports. Thefe  
now form a great mafs of information on a fubje&amp;, of all  
in the world, the moft interefting to man : for none but the  
hufbandman makes any thing for him to eat; and he who  
can double his food, as your exertions bid fair to do, de-  
ferves to rank, among his. benefactors, next after his Crea-  
tor. Among fo many reports of tranfcendent merit, one is  
unwilling to diftinguifh particulars. Yet the application of  
the new chemiftry, to the fubje&amp; of manures, the difcuffion  
of the queftion on the fize of farms, the treatife on the po-  
tatce, from their univerfality have an advantage in other  
countries over thofe which are topographical. The work  
which fhall be formed, as the refult of the whole, we fhall  
expect with impatience.  
  
Permit me, through you, to make here my acknowledg-  
ments to the board of agriculture for the honour they have  
been pleafed to confer on me by, affociating me to their in-  
ftitution. In love for the art, I am truly their affociate :  
but events have controuled my predilection for its practice,  
and denied to me that uninterrupted attention, which alone  
can enable us to advance in it witha fure ftep. Perhaps I  
may find opportunities of being ufeful to you as a centinel  
at an outpoft, by conveying intelligence of whatever may  
occur here new and interefting to agriculture. This duty I  
fhall perform with pleafure, as well in refpeétful return for the

notice of the board, as from a zeal for improving the condi-  
tion of human life, by an interchange of its comforts, and  
of the information which may increafe them.

In a former letter to you I mentioned the conftruGion  
of the mould-board of a plough which had occurred to me,  
as advantageous in its form, as certain and invariable in  
the method of obtaining it with precifion. 1 remember  
that Mr. Strickland of York, a member of your board,  
was fo well fatisfted with the principles on which it was  
formed that he took fome drawings of it; and fome others  
have confidered it with the fame approbation. An experi-  
ence of five years has enabled me to fay, it anfwers in  
practice to what it promifes in theory. The mould-board  
fhould be a continuation of the wing of the ploughfhare,  
beginning at its hinder edge, and in the fame plane. _ Its  
firft office is to receive the fod horizontally from the wing,  
to raife it to a proper height for being turned over, and  
to make, in its progrefs, rhe leaf refiftence poffible; and  
confequently to require a minimum in the moving power.  
Were this its only office, the wedge would offer itfelf as  
the moft * eligible form in practice. But the fod is to be  
turned over alfo. Todo this, the one edge of it is not  
to be raifed at all; for to raife this would be a wafte of  
labour. ‘The other edge is to be raifed till it paffes the  
  
perpendicular,  
  
* Iam aware that were the turf only ¢o be raifed to a given height in a  
given length of mould-board, and not to be turned over, the form of leaft  
refiftence would not be rigoroufly a wedge with both faces ftraight, but with  
the upper one curved according to the laws of the folid of leaft refiftence  
defcribed by the mathematicians. But the difference between the effect of  
the curved and of the plain wedge, in the cafe of a mould-board, is fo  
minute, and the difficulty in the execution which the former would fuperin-  
duce on common workmen is fo great, that the plain wedge is the moft eli-  
gible to be aflumed in practice for the firft element of our conftruction.  
  
  
  
DESCRIPTION or a MOULD-BOARD. 315  
  
perpendicular, that it may fall over with its own weight.  
And that this may be done fo as to give alfo the leaft re-  
fiftence, it muft be made to rife gradually from the mo-  
ment the fod is received. ‘The mould-board then, in this  
fecond office, operates as a tranfverfe, or rifing wedge, the  
point of which fliding back horizontally on the ground,  
the other end continues rifing till it pafles the perpendi-  
cular. Or, to vary the point of view, place on the  
ground a wedge of the breadth of the ploughfhare, of its  
length from the wing backwards, and as high at the heel  
as it is wide. Draw a diagonal on its upper face from the  
left angle at the point to the right upper angle of the heel.  
Bevil the face from the diagonal to the right-bottom-edge  
which lies on the ground. That half is then evidently in  
the beft form for performing the two offices of raifing and  
turning the fod gradually, and with the leaft effort: and  
if you will fuppofe the fame bevil continued acrofs the  
left fide of the diagonal, that is, if you will fuppofe a  
ftraight line whofe length is at leaft equal to the breadth of  
the wedge, applied on the face of the firft bevil and  
moved backwards on-it parallel with itfelf and with the  
ends of the wedge, the lower end of the line moving  
along the right-bottom-edge, a curved plane will be gene-  
rated, whofe charaéteriftic will be a combination of the  
principle of the wedge in crofs dire€tions, and will give  
what we feek, the mou/d-board of leaft refiftence. It offers  
too this great advantage, that it may be made by the  
coarfeft workman, by a procefs fo exact that its form fhall  
never be varied a fingle hair’s breadth. One fault of all  
other mould-boards is that, being copied by the eye, no  
two will be alike. In truth it is eafier to form the mould-  
board I fpeak of with precifion, when the method has  
been once feen, than to defcribe that method either by  
words or figures. I will attempt however to defcribe  
it. Whatever may not be intelligible from the defcrip-  
tion may be fupplied from the model I fend you.

Let the breadth and depth of the furrow the farmer  
ufually opens, as alfo the length of his plough-bar, from  
where it joins the wing to the hinder end, be given; as  
thefe fix the dimenfions of the bleck of which the mould-  
board is to be made. Suppofe the furrow 9g inches wide,  
6 inches deep, and the plough-bar 2 feet long. Then  
the block, Fig. 1. muft be g inches {wide at bottom (4. c.)  
134 inches wide at top, (a. d.) becaufe if it were merely  
of the fame width with the bottom as a. e. the fod, only  
raifed to the perpendicular, would fall back into the fur-  
row by its own elafticity. 1 find from experience, that,  
in my foil, the top of the mould-board fhould overjet the  
perpendicular 44 inches in a height of 12 inches, to  
infure that the weight of the fod fhall preponderate over  
its elafticity. This is an angle of nearly 22°. The block  
muft be 12 inches high, becaufe, unlefs the mould-board  
be in height double the depth of the furrow, in plough-  
ing friable earth, it will be thrown in waves over the mould-  
board: and it muft be 3 feet long, one foot of which is  
added to form a tail-piece, by which it may be made faft  
to the plough-handle. The firft operation is to give the  
firft form to this tail-piece, by fawing the block, Fig. 2.  
acrofs from a. 4. on its left fide, (which is 12 inches  
from its hinder end) along the line 4 ¢. to c. within 12  
inches of the right fide, and to the correfponding point in  
the bottom, 14 inches alfo from the fide. Then faw in  
again at the hinder end from d. e. (14 inches from the  
right fide) along the line d.c. The block 2. 4¢. def  
g. drops out and leaves the tail-piece c. d.e. b. 7. k. 14  
inches thick. The fore part of the block a. 4. c. &amp;. 1 m. n.  
is what is to form the real mould-board. With a car-  
penter’s {quare make a fcribe all round the ‘block at every  
inch. There will of courfe be 23 of them. Then from  
the point &amp; Fig. 2. and 3. draw the diagonals &amp; m. on the

central diagonal to which you had cut in the other direc-  
tion. Confequently the pyramid 4 m. n. o. 1. Fig. 4.  
drops out and leaves the block“in the form Fig. 5. You  
will now obferve that if in the laft operation, inftead of  
ftopping the faw at the central diagonal &amp;. 7. we had cut  
through the block in the fame plane, we fhould have taken  
off a wedge /. m. n. 0. k. b. Fig. 3. and left the block in  
the form of a wedge alfo 1 0. k&amp;. 6. a... which, when  
{peaking of the principle of the mould-board, I obferved  
would be the moft perfe&amp; form if it had only to raife the  
fod. But asit is to be turned over alfo, the left half of  
the upper wedge is preferved, to furnifh on the left fide,  
the continuation of the bevil which was propofed to be  
made on the right half of the bottom wedge. We are now  
to proceed to the bevil, for which purpofe the fcribes  
round the block were formed before the pyramidal piece  
was taken out; and attention mutt be ufed not to mifmatch  
or miftake them, now that they are disjoined by the with-  
drawing of that piece. Enter the faw on the two points  
of the 1ft fcribe where it has been disjoined, which is  
exadtly where it interfected the two fuperficial diagonals,  
and faw acrofs the hollow of the block, guiding the faw,  
both before and behind, along the fame feribe, till the  
fore part of the faw reaches the bottom edge of the right  
fide, and the middle of the faw reaches the central diagonal ;  
  
the

the hinder part will of courfe continue the fame ftraight  
line, which will ifflue fomewhere on the top of the block.  
Then enter the faw in like manner on the two projecting  
points of the 2d fcribe, and faw in, along the fcribe, be-  
fore and behind, till it reaches the fame bottom edge of  
the right fide, and the central diagonal. Then the 3d,  
4th, sth, &amp;c. fcribes fucceflively. After cutting in fe-  
veral of the earlier fcribes, the hinder part of the faw  
will iffue at the left fide of the block, and all the fcribes  
being cut, the faw will have left ftraight lines from the  
bottom edge of the right fide of the block, acrofs the cen-  
tral diagonal. With an adze dub off all the fawed parts  
to the bottoms of the faw-marks, juft leaving the traces  
vilible, and the face of the mould-board is finifhed.  
Thefe traces will fhew how the crofs wedge rifes gradually  
on the face of the dire&amp;t wedge, which is preferved in  
trace of the central diagonal. A perfon may reprefent  
to himéfelf, fenfibly and eafily the manner in which the fod  
is raifed on this mould-board, by defcribing on the grouad  
a parallelogram 2 feet long and g inches broad, as a. 6. c.  
Fig. 6. then reft one end of a ftick 274 inches long on  
the ground at 4..and raife the other 12 inches high at e.  
which is 44 inches from d, and reprefents the overhang-  
ing of that fide of the mould-board. Then prefent  
another ftick 12 inches long from a. to 4. and move  
it backwards parallel with itfelf from a. b. to d. c. keeping  
one end of it always on the line a. d. and letting the other  
rife as it recedes along the diagonal ftick 4. e. which re-  
prefents our central diagonal. The motion of the crofs  
ftick will be that of our rifing wedge, and will fhew how  
every tranfverfe line of the fod is conducted from its firft  
horizontal pofition, till it is raifed fo far beyond the per-  
pendicular as to fall reverfed by its own weight. But to  
return to our work. We have ftill to form the under fide  
of the mould-board. Turn the block bottom up. Ik “om

the faw.on the rift feribe, at what was the bottom edge of  
the left fide, and cut in, guiding the inftrument at both  
ends by the fcribe, till it has approached within an inch,  
or any other diftance according to the thicknefs you choofe,  
of the face. Then cut in like manner all the other fcribes,  
and with the adze dub out the fawed parts, and the mould-  
board is done. It is to be made faft to the plough by reft-  
ing the toe in the hinder edge of the wing, which muft  
be made double like a comb-cafe, to receive and protect  
the fore end of the mould-board. Then pafs a fcrew  
through the mould-board and helve of the ploughthare  
where they touch each other, and two others through the  
tail-piece of the mould-board and right handle of the  
plough, and cut off fo much of the tail-piece as projects  
behind the handle, diagonally, and the whole is done.  
  
I have defcribed this operation in its fimpleft mode, that  
it might be the more eafily underfiood. But, in praétice,  
I have found fome other modifications of it advantageous.  
Thus, inftead of firft forming my block as a. 4 c d.  
Fig. 7. where a. . is 12 inches, and the angle at 4. a right  
one, I cut a wedge-like piece 5. ¢. e. off of the bottom  
through the whole length of the block, 5. e. being equal  
to the thicknefs of the bar of the thare (fuppofe 11 inches)  
becaufe the face of the wing declining from the top of  
the bar to the ground, were the block laid on the fhare,  
without an equivalent bevil at its bottom, the fide a. d,  
would decline from the perpendicular, and a. d. from its  
horizontal pofition. Again, inftead of leaving the top of  
the block 134 inches wide from m. to #. Fig. 8. 1 cut a  
wedge from the right fide 2. 4.2. ¢. p.m. 14inches thick  
at top and tapering to nothing at bottom; becaufe I  
find that the tail-piece, being by this means made ob-  
lique, as c. 7 inftead of &amp; i. is brought more advan-  
tageoufly to the fide of the handle. The firft fuper-  
ficial diagonal is confequently brought from m, toc. and  
  
not  
  
  
  
320 DESCRIPTION or a MOULD-BOARD.  
  
not from m. to &amp; as in the firft directions. Thefe vari-  
ations will be eafy to any one after underftanding the  
general principle. While thefe mould-boards have been  
under trial, and eflays have been making of greater or lefs  
projections for the upper right edge of the block, and of  
different heights in proportion to the depth of the furrow,  
I have continued to make them of wood. But now fatis-  
fied by a fufficient experience, that for a furrowof g by 6  
inches, the dimenfions | have ftated are the beft, I pro-  
pofe to have the mould-board made of caft iron.  
  
l am fenfible that this defcription may be thought too  
lengthy and elaborate for a fubje€t which has hardly been  
deemed worthy the application of {cience. But if the plough  
be in truth the moft ufeful of the inftruments known to  
man, its perfe€tion cannot be an idle fpeculation. And in  
any cafe whatever, the combination of a theory which may  
fatisfy the learned, witha praétice intelligible to the moft  
unlettered labourer, will be acceptable to the two moft ufe-  
ful claffes of fociety. Be this as it may, from the widow  
her mite only was expected. 1 have contributed according  
to my poverty; others will from their abundance.—None  
{fo much as yourfelf, who have been the animating principle  
of the inftitution from its firft germ. When | contemplate  
the extenfive good which the proceedings under your di-  
rection are calculated to produce, I cannot but deplore every  
pofhibility of their interruption. I am fixed in awe at the  
mighty confli€t to which two great nations are advancing,  
and recoil with horror at the ferocioufnefs of man. Will  
nations never devife a more rational umpire of differences  
than force? Are there no means of coercing injuftice more  
gratifying to our nature than a wafte of the blood of thou-  
fands, and of the labour of millions of our fellow-crea-  
tures? We fee numerous focieties of men (the aborigi-  
nals of this country) living together without the acknow-  
ledgment of either laws or magiftracy. Yet they live in  
  
peace  
  
  
  
DESCRIPTION or 4 MOULD-BOARD. 321  
  
peace among themfelves, and acts of violence and injury  
_ are as rare in their ‘focieties as in nations which keep the  
fword of the law in perpetual activity. Public. reproach,  
a refufal of common offices, interdiction of the commerce  
and comforts of fociety »are found as effectual as the  
coarfer inftrument. of force... Nations, like thefe indivi-  
duals, ftand towards each other only in the relations of  
natural right. Might they not, like them, be peaceably  
punifhed for violence and wrong? Wonderful has been  
the progrefs of human improvement in other lines. Let  
us hope then that that law of nature which makes a virtu-  
ous conduét produce benefit, and vice lofs, to the agent in  
the long run, which has fanétioned the common principle  
that honefty is the beft policy, will in time influence the  
proceedings of nations as well as of individuals; and that  
we fhall at length be fenfible that war is an inftrument  
entirely inefficient towards redrefling wrong ; that it mul-  
tiplies inftead of indemnifying loffes. Had the money  
which has been fpent in the prefent war been employed in  
making roads and condu@ting canals of navigation and ir-  
rigation through the country, not a hovel in the remoteft  
corner of the Highlands of Scotland, or mountains of  
Auvergne, would have been without a boat at its door, a  
rill of water in every field, and a road to its market town.  
Had the money we have loft by the lawlefs depredations  
of all the belligerent powers been employed in the fame  
way, what communications would have been opened of  
roads and waters! Yet were we to go to war for redrefs,  
inftead of redrefs, we fhould plunge deeper into lofs, and  
difable ourfelves for half a century more from attaining  
the fame end. A war would coft us more than would  
cut through the ifthmus of Darien; and that.of Suez  
might have been opened with what a fingle year has feen  
thrown away on the rock of Gibraltar. Thefe truths are  
palpable, and mutt in the progrefs of time have their in-

War is ah instru­  
ment entirely inefficient towards redres­  
sing wrong; that it multiplies, instead of  
indemnifying losses. Had the money  
which has been spent in the present war  
been employed in making roads and con­  
du£Uhg canals of navigation and irrigation  
through the country, not a hovel in the re­  
motest corner of Use highlands of Scotland,  
Or the mountains of Auvergne, would have  
been without a boat at its door, a rill of  
water in every field, and a road to its mar­  
ket tdwti. Had the money we have lost  
by the lawless depredations of all the bel-,  
Hgerenc powers been employed in the  
same way, what communications would  
have been opened of roads and waters 1  
Yet were we to go to war for redress, in­  
stead of redoes*, we would plunge deeper  
into loss, and disable ourselves for half a  
century more from attaining the same end.  
A war would cost us more than would/:ut  
through the Isthmus of Darien ; ami that  
of Suez might have been opened with  
what a single year has seen thrown away  
on the rock of Gibraltar. These truths  
are nalnable. and must in

In a former letter to you, I mentioned the construction  
of the mould-board of a plough which had occurred to me,  
as advantageous in its form, as certain and invariable in  
the method of obtaining it with precision. I remember  
that Mr. Strickland of York, a member of your board, was  
so well satisfied with the principles on which it was formed,  
that he took some drawings of it; and some others have  
considered it with the same approbation. An experiencé  
of five years has enabled me to say, it answers, in prac-  
tice, to what it promises in theory. The mould-board  
should be a continuation of the wing of the pioughshare,  
beginning at its hinder edge, and in the same plane. Its  
office is to receive the sod horizontally from the wing, to  
raise it to a proper height for being turned over, and to  
make, in its progress, the least resistance possible; and,  
consequently, to require a minimum in the moving power.  
Were this its only office, the wedge would offer itself as the  
most eligible form in practice.* But the sod is to be turn-  
ed overalso. To do this, the one edge of it is not to be rais-  
ed at all; for to raise this would be a waste of labour. The  
other edge is to be raised till it passes the perpendicular,

* T am aware, that were the turf to be raised to a given height, in  
a given length of mould-board, and not to be turned over, the form of  
jeast resistance would not be rigorously a wedge with both faces  
straight, but with the upper one curved, according to the laws of the  
solid of least resistance described by the mathematicians. But the  
difference between the effect of the curved and of the plain wedge,  
in the case of a mould-board, is so minute, and the difficulty in the  
execution which the former would superinduce on common workmen,  
is so great, that the plain wedge is the most eligible to be assumed in  
practice of the first element of our construction.

that it may fall over with its own weight. And that this may  
be done, so as to give also the least resistance, it must be  
made to rise gradually from the moment the sod is received.  
The mould-board then, in this second office, operates as a  
transverse, or rising wedge, the point of which sliding back  
horizontally on the ground, the other end continues rising  
till it passes the perpendicular. Or to vary the point of  
view, place on the ground a wedge of the breadth of the  
ploughshare, of its length from the wing backwards, and as  
high at the heel as it is wide. Draw a diagonal line on its  
upper face, from the left angle, at the point, to the right  
upper angle of the heel. Bevil the face from the diagonal  
to the right bottom edge, which lies on the ground. ‘That  
half is then evidently in the best form, for performing the  
two offices of raising and turning the sod gradually and  
with the least effort: and if you will suppose the same  
bevil continued across the left side of the diagonal, that is,  
if you will suppose a straight line, whose length is at least  
equal to the breadth of the wedge, applied on the face of  
the first bevil, and moved backwards on its parallel, with  
itself and with the ends of the wedge, the lower end of the  
line, moving along the right bottom-edge, a curved plane  
will be generated, whose characteristic will be, a combina-  
tion of the principle of the wedge in cross directions, and  
will give us what we seek, the cross board of least resis-  
tance. It offers too this great advantage, that it may be  
made by the coarsest workmen, by a process so exact, that  
its form shall never be varied a single hair’s breadth. One  
fault of all other mould-boards is, that, being copied by the  
eye, no two will be alike. In truth, it is easier to form the  
mould-board I speak of with precision, when the method  
has been once seen, than to describe that method either by  
words or figures. I will attempt, however, to describe it.  
Whatever may not.be intelligible from the description, may  
be supplied from the model I send you.

from the description, may be supplied from the model  
I send you.  
  
* Let the breadth and depth of the furrow the far-  
mer usually opens, as also the length of his plough-  
bar, from where it joins the wing to the hinder end,  
be given; as these fix the dimensions of the block of  
which the mould board is to be made. Suppose the  
furrow 9 inches wide, 6 inches deep, and the plough-  
bar 2 feet long. Then the block, Fig. 1. must be 9  
inches wide at bottom (4. c.) 134 inches wide at top,  
(a. d.) because if it were merely of the same width  
with the bottom as a.e. the sod, only raised to the  
perpendicular, would fall back into the furrow by its  
own elasticity. I find from experience, that, in my  
soil, the top of the mould-board should overjet the  
perpendicular 44 inches in a height of 12 inches, to  
insure that the weight of the sod shall preponderate  
over its elasticity. This is an angle of nearly 22°,—  
The block must be 12 inches high, because, unless  
the mould-board be in height double the depth of the  
furrow, in ploughing friable earth, it will be thrown  
in waves over the mould-board ; and it must be 3 feet  
long, one foot of which is added to form a tail-piece,  
by which it may be made fast to the plough-handle.  
The first operation is to give the first form to this  
tail-piece, by sawing the block, Fig. 2. across from  
a. b. on its left side, (which is twelve inches from  
its hinder end) along the line 4 c. to c. within 14  
inches of the right side, and to the corresponding point  
in the bottom, 14 inches also from the side. Then  
saw in again at the hinder end from d. e. (14 inches)  
from the right side) along the line d. c. The block  
a. be. d. e. f. g. _— out and leaves the tail-piece  
ec. d. eh. i. kk. 14 inches thick. The fore part of the  
block a. 4. c. k. 1. m. n. is what is to form the real  
mould-beard. With a carpenter’s square make  
scribe all round the block at every inch. There will  
of course be 23 of them. Then from the point &amp;  
Fig. 2. and 3, draw the diagonals *&amp;. m. on the top,  
and k. o. Fig. 3. on the right side. Enter a saw at  
the point m. being the left-fore upper corner, and saw  
in, guiding the hinder part of the saw along the dia  
gonal m. &amp;. (Fig. 2. 3.) and the fore part down the  
left edge of the block at the fore-end m. l. (Fig. 2.)  
till it reaches &amp;. and /. in a straight line. It will then)  
  
  
  
  
  
have reached the true central diagonal of the block  
k. . Fig. 5. then enter the saw at the point o. being’  
the right-fore-bottom corner, and saw in, guiding the  
hinder part of the saw along the diagonal o. &amp;. (Fig. 3.)  
  
  
  
althe face. Then cut in like manner all the other scribes,  
  
the 2nd scribe, and saw in, along the scribe, before  
and behind, till it reaches the same bottom edge of|  
the right side, and the central diagonal. Then the  
3d, 4th, 5th, &amp;c. scribes successively. After cuting  
in several of the earlier scribes, the hinder part of the  
saw will issue at the left side of the block, and all  
the scribes being cut, the saw will have left straight  
lines from the bottom edge of the right side of the  
block, across the central diagonal. With an adze  
dub off all the sawed parts to the bottoms of the  
saw marks, just leaving the traces visible, and the  
face of the mould-board is finished. These traces  
will shew how the cross wedge rises gradually on the  
face of the direct wedge, which is preserved in trace  
of the central diagonal. A person may represent to  
himself, sensibly and easily the manner in which the  
sod is raised on this mould-board, by describing on  
the ground a parallelogram 2 feet long and 9 inches  
broad, as a. 5. c. d. Fig. 6. then rest one end ofa stick  
274 inches long on the ground at 4. and raise the  
other 12 inches high at e. which is 44 is inches from d,  
and represents the overhanging of that side of the  
mould-board. Then present another stick 12 inches long  
from a, to d. and move it backwards parallel with itself  
from a. 4. to d. c. keeping one end of it always on the  
line a. d. and letting the other rise as it recedes along  
the diagonal stick 4. e. which represents our central dia-  
gonal. The motion of the cross stick will be that of our  
rising wedge, and will show how every transverse line of  
the sod is conducted from its first horizontal position,  
till it is raised so far beyond the perpendicular as to fall  
reversed by its own weight. But to return to our work.  
We have still to form the under side of the mould-  
board. Turn the block bottom up. Enter the saw on  
the first scribe, at what was the bottom edge of the left  
side, and cut in, guiding the instrument at both ends by  
the scribe, till it has approached within an inch, or any  
other distance, according to the thickness you choose of  
  
and with the adze dub out the sawed parts, and the  
mould-board is done. It isto be made fast to the plough by  
resting the toe in the hinder edge of the wing, which  
must be made double like a comb case, to receive and  
protect the fore end of the mould-board. Then pass a  
screw through the mould-board and helve of the plough-  
share, where they touch each other, and two others  
through the tail piece of the mould-board and right  
handle of the plough, and cut off so much of the tail-  
  
piece as projects behind the handle diagonally, and the|_  
  
whole is done.

“ These variations will be easy to any one after un-  
derstanding the general principle. While these  
mould-boards have been under trial, and essays have  
been making of greater or less projection for the up-  
per right edge of the block, ard of different heights  
in proportion to the depth of the furrow, I have con-  
tinued to make them of wood. But now satisfied by  
a sufficient experience, that for a furrow of 9 by 6 in-

pose to have the mould-board made of cast iron.

be an idle speculation, And in any case whatever, the

“ honesty is the best policy,” will in  
time influence the proceedings of nations as  
well of individuals, and that we shall at length  
be sensible that war is an instrument entirely  
inefficient toward redressing wrongs, that it  
multiplies instead of indemnifying losses.  
  
Had the money which has been spent in the  
past war been employed in making roads and  
conducting canals of navigation and irrigation  
through the country, not a hovel in the high-  
lands of Scotland or the mountains of Auvergne  
would have been without a boat at its door or  
a rill of water in every field and a road to its  
market town. Had the money we have lost by  
lawless depredations of all the belligerent pow-  
ers been employed in the same way, what com-  
munications would have been opened of roads  
and water. Yet were we to go to war for re-  
dress, instead of redress we should plunge deep-  
er into losses and disable ourselves for half a  
century more from attaining the same end. A  
war would cost us more than would cut through  
the Isthmus of Darien ; and that of Suez might  
have been opened with what a single year has  
thrown away on the rock of Gibraltar.
