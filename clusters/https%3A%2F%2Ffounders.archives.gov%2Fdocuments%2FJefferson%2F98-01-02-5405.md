In this faint Eulogium, you will, I doubt not, Sir, have anticipated the name of the Marquis, Major Genl De Chattelux. A Noble man who was proud to call you one of his most distinguished &amp; most highly esteemed Friends—The following brief extracts will warrant the truth of my assertions.—The Marquis, after describing the House at Monticello, proceeds “But it is on himself I ought to bestow my time, Let me describe to you a Man, not yet 40, tall, and with a mild and pleasing countenance, but whose mind and under standing are ample substitutes for every exterior grace. An American, who without ever having quitted his own Country is at once a musician; skilled in drawing; a geometrician, an astronomer, a natural philosopher, a legislator, and a profound statesman, A Senetor of America, who Sat two years in that famous Congress which brought about the Revolution.****A Governor of Virginia, who filled this difficult station during the Invation of Arnold of Phillips and Cornwallis; a philosopher, in voluntary retirement, from the world, and public business, because he loves the world, in as much only as he can be useful to mankind.*****A mild and amiable Wife, charming children, of whose education he himself takes charge, a house to embellish, great provisions to improve, and the arts and Sciences to improve.The Visit which I made him was not unexpected, for he had long since invited me to come and spend some days with him, in the centre of the Mountains; notwithstanding which I found his first appearance Serious, nay even cold; but before I was two hours with him, we were as intimate as if we had spent our whole lives together; walking, books, but above all, a conversation always varied and interesting, always supported by that sweet satisfaction experienced by two persons, who in communicating their sentiments and opinions are invariably in unison, and who understand each other at the first hint; made four days pass away like so many minutes****This conformity of sentiments and opinions on which I insist, because it constitutes my own eulogiums, (and self love must some where shew itself) this conformity, I say, was so perfect, that not only our taste was similar, but our predelictions also; those partialities which cold methodical minds ridicule as enthusiastic, whilst sensible and animated ones cherish and adopt the glorious appellation”******.It would, Sir, be insulting your feelings to suppose, that even after a lapse of 43 years, you would not bring to your memory, the name of the accomplished and amiable De Chattellux. I have written to General De La Fayette, who was held in the highest estimation, by the Marquis De C, to request his name at the head of the list of Subscribers, and in my letter to t

poems of Ossian. It was a spark of electricity  
which passed rapidly from one to the other; we re-  
collected the passages in those sublime poems, which  
particularly struck us, and entertained my fellow

were qualified to judge of their merit, though they  
had never read the poems. In our enthusiasm the  
book was sent for, and placed near the bowl, where

sweeping statement, though not far  
from the truth. Upon entering, he  
met the master of the house; “a man  
not yet forty, tall, and with a mild and  
pleasing countenance”; “an American,  
who, without ever having quitted his  
own country, is at once a musician,  
skilled in drawing, a geometrician,  
an astronomer, a natural philosopher,  
legislator, and statesman ”; “a philos-  
opher in voluntary retirement from the  
world and public business,” because  
“the minds of his countrymen are not  
yet in a condition either to bear the light  
or to suffer contradiction ” ; blessed  
with “a mild and amiable wife, and  
charming children of whose education  
he himself takes charge.” Mr. Jeffer-  
son, he adds, received his invited guest  
without any show of cordiality, even  
with something like coldness ; but be-  
fore they had conversed two hours,  
they were as intimate as if they had  
passed their whole lives together.  
During four days the joy of their inter-  
course never lessened ; for their con-  
versation, “always varied and inter-  
esting, was supported by that sweet  
satisfaction experienced by two per-  
sons, who, in communicating their  
sentiments and opinions, are invariably  
in unison, and who understand one  
another at the first hint.”
