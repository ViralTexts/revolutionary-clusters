e laws laying duties on spirits distilled within the UStates and on Stills, seems to render proper a review of the circumstances which have attended those laws in that scene, from their commencement to the present time and of the conduct which has hitherto been observed on the part of the Government, its motives and effect; in order to a better judgment of the measures necessary to be pursued in the existing emergency.  
The opposition to those laws in the four most Western Counties of Pensylvania (Alleghany Washington Fayette and Westmoreland) commenced as early as they were known to have been passed. It has continued, with different degrees of violence, in the different counties, and at different periods. But Washington has uniformly distinguished its resistance by a more excessive spirit, than has appeared in the other Counties &amp; seems to have been chiefly instrumental in kindling and keeping alive the flame.

on was tarred and feathered—and about day light dismissed—naked wounded and otherwise in a very suffering condition. These particulars are communicated in a letter from the Inspector of the Revenue of the 17th of November, who declares that he had then himself seen the unfortunate maniac, the abuse of whom, as he expresses it, exceeded description and was sufficient to make human nature shudder. The affair is the more extraordinary, as persons of weight and consideration in that county are understood to have been actors in it, and as the symptoms of Insanity were, during the whole time of inflicting the punishment apparent—the unhappy sufferer displaying the heroic fortitude of a man, who conceived himself to be a martyr to discharge of some duty.  
Not long after a person of the name of Roseberry underwent the humiliating punishmt of tarring &amp; feathering with some aggravations; for having in conversation hazarded the very natural and just, but unpalatable remark, that the inhabitants of that County could not reasonably expect protection from a Government, whose laws they so strenuously opposed.  
The audacity of the perpetrators of these excesses was so great that (as appears by a letter from Mr. Nevil of the 22 of December) an armed banditti ventured to seize and carry off two persons, who were witnesses against the rioters in the case of Wilson; in order, as was inferred, to prevent their giving testimony of the riot to a Court then sitting or about to sit.  
Designs of personal violence against the Inspector of the Revenue himself, to force him to a resignation, were repeatedly attempted to be put in execution by armed parties, but by different circumstances were frustrated.  
In the session of Congress, which commenced in October 1791, the law laying a duty on distilled spirits and on stills came under the revision of Congress as had been anticipated. By an act passed the 8th of May 1792, during that session, material alterations were made in it. Among these, the duty was reduced to a rate so moderate, as to have silenced complaint on that head—and a new and very favourable alternative was given to the Distiller, that of paying a monthly, instead a yearly rate, according to the capacity of his Still, with liberty to take a license for the precise term which he should intend to work it, and to renew that license for a further term or terms.  
This amending Act, in its progress through the Legislature, engaged the particular attention of members who themselves were interested in distilleries, and of others who represented parts of the Country in which the business of Distilling was extensively carried on. Objections were well considered and great pains taken to obviate all such as had the semblance of reasonableness.  
The effect has in a great measure corresponded with the views of the Legislature. Opposition has subsided in several districts where it before prevailed; and it was natural to entertain and not easy to abandon a hope that the same thing would by degrees have taken place in the four Western Counties of this State.  
But notwithstanding some flattering appearances at particular junctures, and infinite pains by various expedients to produce the desireable issue the hope entertained has never been realized, and is now at an end, as far as the ordinary means of executing laws are concerne

e first Law had left the number and positions of the Offices of Inspection, which were to be established in each District for receiving entries of Stills, to the discretion of the Supervisor. The second, to secure a due accommodation to Distillers, provides peremptorily that there shall be one in each County.  
The idea was immediately embraced, that it was a very important point in the scheme of opposition to the law to prevent the establishment of Offices in the respective Counties. For this purpose, the intimidation of well disposed inhabitants was added to the plan of molesting and obstructing the Officers by force or otherwise, as might be necessary. So effectually was the first point carried, (the certain destruction of property and the peril of life being involved) that it became almost impracticable to obtain suitable places for Offices in some of the Counties—and when obtained, it was found a matter of necessity in almost every instance to abandon them.  
After much effort The Inspector of the Revenue succeeded in procuring the house of William Faulkner a captain in the army for an Office of Inspection in the County of Washington. This took place in August 1792. The office was attended by the Inspector of the Revenue in person, till prevented by the following incidents.  
Capt Faukner, being in pursuit of some Deserters from the troops, was encountered by a number of people in the same neighbourhood, where Mr. Johnson had been ill treated the preceding year, who reproached him with letting his house for an Office of Inspection—drew a knife upon him, threatened to scalp him, tar and feather him, and reduce his house and property to Ashes, if he did not solemnly promise to prevent the further use of his House for an Office.  
Capt Faulkner was induced to make the promise exacted—and in consequence of the circumstance wrote a letter to the Inspector dated the 20th of August countermanding the permission for using his house—and the day following gave a public notice in the Pittsburgh Gazette that the Office of Inspection should be no longer kept there.  
At the same time, another engine of opposition was in operation. Agreeable to a previous notification, there met at Pittsburgh on the 21st of August a number of persons stiling themselves “A Meeting of sundry Inhabitants of the Western Counties of Pensylvania” who appointed John Canon Chairman and Albert Gallatin Clerk.  
This Meeting entered into resolutions not less exceptionable than those of its predecessors. The preamble suggested that a tax on spirituous liquors is unjust in itself and oppressive upon the poor—that internal taxes upon consumption must in the end destroy the liberties of every country in which they are introduced—that the law in question, from certain local circumstances which are specified, would bring immediate distress &amp; ruin upon the Western Country, and concludes with the sentiment, that they think it their duty to persist in remonstrances to Congress, and in every other Legal measure, that may obstruct the operation of the Law.  
The Resolutions then proceed, first, to appoint a Committee to prepare and cause to be presented to Congress an address, stating objections to the law and praying for it

 appoint Committees of correspondence for Washington Fayette, and Alleghany, charged to correspond together and with such Committee as should be appointed for the same purpose in the County of Westmoreland, or with any Committees of a similar nature, that might be appointed in other parts of the UStates, and also if found necessary to call together either general Meetings of the people, in their respective Counties, or conferences of the several Committees: And lastly to declare, that they will in future consider those who hold Offices for the collection of the duty as unworthy of their friendship, that they will have no intercourse nor dealings with them, will withdraw from them every assistance, withhold all the comforts of life which depend upon those duties that as men and fellow Citizens we owe to each other, and will upon all occasions treat them with contempt; earnestly Recommending it to the People At Large to Follow the Same Line of Conduct Towards Them.  
The idea of pursuing legal measures to obstruct the operation of a Law needs little comment. Legal measures may be pursued to procure the repeal of a law, but to obstruct its operation presents a contradiction in terms. The operation, or what is the same thing, the execution of a law, cannot be obstructed, after it ha

The Supervisor of the Revenue was sent into the opposing survey to ascertain the real state of that survey—to obtain evidence of the persons who were concerned in the riot in Faulkeners case—and of those who composed the Meeting at Pittsburgh—to uphold the confidence and encourage the perseverence of the Officers acting under the law—and to induce if possible the inhabitants

rom various representations supported by satisfactory testimony, that there had been some mistake as to the persons accused—justice and policy demanded that the prosecutions should be discontinued, which was accordingly done.  
This issue of the business unavoidably defeated the attempt to establish examples of the punishment of persons who engaged in a violent resistance to the laws—and left the officers to struggle against the stream of resistance, without the advantage of such examples.  
The following plan, afterwards successively put in execution, was about this time digested for carrying if possible the laws into effect, without the necessity of recurring to force.  
1.   To prosecute delinquents in the cases in which it could be clearly done for non compliances with the laws   2   to intercept the markets for the surplus produce of the distilleries of the non complying counties, by seizing the spirits in their way to those markets, in places where it could be effected without opposition   3   by purchases through Agents for the Government for the use of the army (instead of deriving the supply through contractors as formerly) confining them to spirits in respect to which there had been a compliance with the laws.  
The motives to this plan speak for themselves. It aimed, besides the influence of penalties on delinquents, at making it the general interest of the distillers to comply with the laws, by interrupting the market for a very considerable surplus, and by, at the same time, confining the benefit of the large demand for public service, to those who did their duty to the public, and furnishing through the means of payments in Cash that medium for paying the duties, the want of which, it was alleged, was a great difficulty in the way of compliance.  
But two circumstances conspired to counteract the success of this plan—one, the necessity towards incurring the penalties of non compliance of there being an office of Inspection in each County, which was prevented in some of the counties by the means of intimidation practiced for that purpose—another, the non extension of the law to the territory N West of the Ohio—into which a large proportion of the surplus beforementioned was sent.  
A cure for these defects could only come from the legislature. Accordingly in the session which began in November 1792, measures were taken for procuring a further revision of the laws. A bill containing amendments of these defects was brought in; but it so happened that this object, by reason of more urgent business,

A reply to his application from John Wilkins Junior &amp; John Gibson Magistrates &amp; Militia officers informed him, that the laws could not be executed, so as to afford him the protection to which he was intitled, owing to the too general combination of the people in that part of Pensylvania to oppose the Revenue law; adding that they would take every step in their power to bring the Rioters to Justice &amp; would be glad to receive information of the individuals concerned in the attack upon his house, that prosecutions might be commenced against them and expressing their sorrow, that should the Posse Comitatus of the County be ordered out in support of the civil authority, very few could be g

by interrupting the market for a very considera­  
ble surplus, aud by at the same time, confining  
the benefit of the Inigo demand for ptiblic ser­

want of which w as alledjjed to be a great diffi
