Washington Nov. 24. 1801.  
I had not been unmindful of your letter of June 15, covering a resolution of the House of Representatives of Virginia, and referred to in your’s of the 17th. inst. the importance of the subject, and the belief that it gave us time for consideration till the next meeting of the legislature have induced me to defer the answer to this date. you will percieve that some circumstances, connected with the subject, &amp; necessarily presenting themselves to view, would be improper but for your’s &amp; the legislative ear. their publication might have an ill effect in more than one quarter. in confidence of attention to this, I shall indulge greater freedom in writing.  
Common malefactors, I presume, make no part of the object of that resolution. neither their numbers, nor the nature of their offences, seem to require any provisions beyond those practised heretofore, &amp; found adequate to the repression of ordinary crimes. Conspiracy, insurgency, treason, rebellion, among that description of persons who brought, on us the alarm, and on themselves the tragedy, of 1800, were doubtless within the view of every one: but many perhaps contemplated, and one expression of the resolution might comprehend, a much larger scope. respect to both opinions makes it my duty to understand the resolution in all the extent of which it is susceptible.  
The idea seems to be to provide for these people by a purchase of lands; and it is asked Whether such a purchase can be made of the US. in their Western territory? a very great extent of country, North of the Ohio, has been laid off into townships, and is now at market, according to the provisions of the acts of Congress, with which you are acquainted. there is nothing which would restrain the state of Virginia either in the purchase or the application of these lands. but a purchase, by the acre, might perhaps be a more expensive provision than the H. of Representatives contemplated. questions would also arise whether the establishment of such a colony, within our limits, &amp; to become a part of our Union, would be desireable to the state of Virginia itself, or to the other states, especially those who would be in it’s vicinity?  
Could we procure lands beyond the limits of the US. to form a receptacle for these people? on our Northern boundary, the country not occupied by British subjects, is the property of Indian nations, whose title would be to be extinguished, with the consent of Great Britain; &amp; the new settlers would be British subjects. it is hardly to be believed that either Great Britain or the Indian proprietors have so disinterested a regard for us as to be willing to relieve us by recieving such a colony themselves; and as much to be doubted whether that race of men could long exist in so rigorous a climate. on our Western &amp; Southern frontiers, Spain holds an immense country; the occupancy of which however is in the Indian nations; except a few insulated spots possessed by Spanish subjects. it is very questionable indeed Whether the Indians would sell? whether Spain would be willing to recieve these people? and nearly certain that she would not alienate the sovereignty. the same question to ourselves would recur here also, as did in the first case: should we be willing to have such a colony in contact with us? however our present interests may restrain us within our own limits, it is impossible not to look forward to distant times, when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, &amp; cover the whole Northern, if not the Southern continent with a people speaking the same language, governed in similar forms, &amp; by similar laws: nor can we contemplate, with satisfaction, either blot or mixture on that surface.  Spain, France, and Portugal hold possessions on the Southern continent, as to which I am not well enough informed to say how far they might meet our views. but either there, or in the Northern continent, should the constituted authorities of Virginia fix their attention, of preference, I will have the dispositions of those powers sounded in the first instance.  
The West Indies offer a more probable &amp; practicable retreat for them. inhabited already by a people of their own race &amp; colour; climates congenial with their natural constitution; insulated from the other descriptions of men; Nature seems to have formed these islands to become the receptacle of the blacks transplanted into this hemisphere. whether we could obtain from the European sovereigns of those islands leave to send thither the persons under contemplation, I cannot say: but I think it more probable than the former propositions, because of their being already inhabited more or less by the same race. the most promising portion of them is the island of St. Domingo, where the blacks are established into a sovereignty de facto, &amp; have organised themselves under regular laws &amp; government. I should conjecture that their present ruler might be willing, on many considerations, to recieve even that description which would be exiled for acts deemed criminal by us, but meritorious perhaps by him. the possibility that these exiles might stimulate &amp; conduct vindictive or predatory descents on our coasts, &amp; facilitate concert with their brethren remaining here, looks to a state of things between that island &amp; us not probable on a contemplation of our relative strength, and of the disproportion daily growing: and it is over-weighed by the humanity of the measures proposed, &amp; the advantages of disembarrassing ourselves of such dangerous characters.  Africa would offer a last &amp; undoubted resort, if all others more desireable should fail us. Whenever the legislature of Virginia shall have brought it’s mind to a point, so that I may know exactly what to propose to foreign authorities, I will execute their wishes with fidelity &amp; zeal. I hope however they will pardon me for suggesting a single question for their own consideration. when we contemplate the variety of countries &amp; of sovereigns towards which we may direct our views, the vast revolutions &amp; changes of circumstance which are now in a course of progression, the possibilities that arrangements now to be made with a view to any particular place may, at no great distance of time, be totally deranged by a change of sovereignty, of government, or of other circumstances, it will be for the legislature to consider Whether, after they shall have made all those general provisions which may be fixed by legislative authority, it would be reposing too much confidence in their executive to leave the place of relegation to be decided on by him, &amp; executed with the aid of the Federal executive? these could accomodate their arrangements to the actual state of things, in which countries or powers may be found to exist at the day; and may prevent the effect of the law from being defeated by intervening changes. this however is for them to decide. our duty will be to respect their decision.

Wasutneton, Nov. 2ith, 1801.  
  
Dear Sir:—I had not been unmindful of your letter of June  
15th, covering a Resolution ofthe Houze of Representatives of Vir-  
ginia, and referred to, in yours of the 17th inst. The importance  
of the subject, and the beliefthat it gave us time for considera-  
tion till the next meeting of the Legislature, have induced me to  
defer the answer, to this date. You will perceive, that some  
circumstauces connected witb the subject, and necessarily pre-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
100 Proceedings of the Virginia Legislature { June,  
  
senting themselves to view, would be improper but for your’s  
and the legislative ear. Their publication might have anill ef  
fect in more than one quarter; in confidence of attention to this, I  
shall indulge greater freedom in writing.  
  
Common malefactors, I presume, make no part of the object of  
that Resolution. Neither their numbers, nor the nature of their  
offences, seem to require any provisions, beyond those practised  
heretofore, and found adequate to the repression of ordinary  
crimes. Conspiracy, insurgency, treason, rebellion, among that  
description of persons who brought on us the alarm, and on them-  
selves the tragedy of 1500, were doubtless within the view of ev-  
ery one; but many, perhaps, contemplated, and one expression of  
the Resolution might comprehend, a much larger scope. Res-  
pect to both opinions, makes it my duty to understand the reso-  
lution in allthe extents of which it is susceptible.  
  
The idea seems to be, to provide for these people by a purchase  
of land; and it is asked whether such a purchase can be made of  
the U.S.in their western Territory? A very great extent of coun-  
try north of the Ohio, has been laid off into townships, and is  
now at market, according to the provisions of the acts of Con-  
gress, With which youare acquainted. There is nothing which  
would restrain the State of Virginia, either in the purchase, or  
the application of these lands: but a purchase by the acre might  
perhaps, be a more expensive provision than the House ef Rep-  
resentatives contemplated. Questions would also arise, wheth-  
er, the establishment of sucha colony, within our limits, and to  
become a part of our Union, would be desirable to the state of  
Virginia itself, or to the other states; especially those who would  
be in its vicinity?  
  
Could we procure lands beyond the limits of the United States,  
to form a receptacle for these people? On our northern boun-  
dary the country not occupied by British subjects, is the proper-  
ty of Indian nations, whose titles would be to be extinguished,  
with the consent of Great Britain; and the new settlers would be  
British subjects. It is hardly to be believed that either Great  
Britain or the Indian proprietors have so disinterested a regard  
for us, as to be willing to relieve us, by receiving such acolony  
‘themselves; and as much is it to be doubted whether that race of  
men could long exist in sorigorousa climate. On our Western and

Southern frontiers, Spain holds an immense country; the occupan-  
cy of which, however, is in the Indian natives, except afew in-  
sulated spots possessed by Spanish subjects. It is very question-  
able indeed, whether the Indians would sell—whether Spain  
would be willing to receive these people—and nearly certain  
that she would not alienate the sovereignty. The same question  
to ourselves would recur here also, as did in the first case: should  
we be willing to have such a colony in contact with us? How-  
ever our precedent interests may restrain us within our own  
limits, it is impossible not to look forward to distant times, when  
our rapid multiplication will’ expand itself beyond those limits,  
and cover the whole Northern, if not the Southern Continent,  
with a people speaking the same language, governed in similar  
forms, and by similar laws. Norcan wecontemplate with satis-  
faction, either blot or mixture in that surface. Spain, France  
and Portugal hold possessions on the Southern Continent, as to  
which [am not well enough informed to say, how far they might  
meet our views. But either there orin the northern continent,  
should the constituted authorites of Virginia fix their attention  
of preference, I will have the dispositions of those powers sound-  
ed in the first instance.  
  
The West Indies offer a more probable and practicable retreat  
for them. Inhabited already by a people of their own race and  
colour; climates congenial with their natural constitution, insula-  
ted from the other descriptions of men; nature seems to have form-  
ed these Islands to become the receptacles of the blacks, trans-  
planted into this hemisphere. Whether we could obtain from  
the European Sovereigns of those Islands, leave to send thither  
the persons under contemplation, I cannot say: butI think it more  
probable than the former proposition, because of their being al-  
ready inhabited more or less by the same race. The most pro-  
mising portion of them is the Island of St. Domingo, where the  
blacks are established into a sovereignty, de facto, and have or-  
ganized themselves under regular laws and government. I should  
conjecture that their present ruler, might be willing on many  
considerations, to receive even that description which would be  
exiled for acts deemed criminal by us, but meritorious perhaps  
by him. The possibility that these exiles might stimulate, and  
conduct vindictive or predatory descents on our coasts, and fa

change of sovereignty, of government or of other circumstances,  
it will be for the Legislature to consider whether, after they shall  
have made all those general provisions, which may be fixed by  
legislative authority: it would be reposing too much confidence  
in their executive to leave the place of relegation to be decided  
on by them, and executed with the aid of the federal executive?  
They could accommodate their arrangements to the actual state
