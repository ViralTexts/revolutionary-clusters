. I agreed with you in Sentiments concerning the Old Testament, and thought the Clause in our Constitutions, which required the Members of Assembly to declare their belief that the whole of it was given by divine Inspiration,  
  
had better have been omitted. That I had opposed the Clause; but being overpower’d by Numbers, and fearing more might in future times be grafted on [it, I pre]vailed to have the additional Clause, that no fu[rther or more] extended Profession of Faith should Ever [be exacted. I ob]serv’d to you, too, that the Evil of it [was the less, as no In]habitant, nor any Officer of Government, except the Members of Assembly, were oblig’d to make that Declaration. So much for that Letter. To which I may now add that there [are] several Things in the old Testament impossible to be given by divine Inspiration, such as the Approbation ascrib’d to the Angel of the Lord, of that abominably wicked and detestable Action of Jael the Wife of Heber the Kenite. If the rest of the Book were like that, I should rather suppose it given by Inspiration from another Quarter, and renounce the whole.
