The purchase of arms and military accoutrements by an agent of the french Government, in this Country, with an intent to export them to France, is the subject of another of the memorials. Of this fact, we are equally uninformed, as of the former. Our Citizens have been always free to make, vend, and export arms. It is the constant occupation and livelihood of some of them. To suppress their callings, the only means perhaps of their subsistance because a war exists in foreign and distant countries, in which we have no concern, would scarcely be expected. It would be hard in principle, and impossible in practice. The law of nations, therefore, respecting the rights of those at peace, does not require from them such an internal derangement in their occupations. It is satisfied with the external penalty pronounced in the President’s proclamation, that of confiscation of such portion of these arms as shall fall into the Hands of any of the belligerent powers on their way to the ports of their enemies. To this penalty our Citizens are warned that they will be abandoned, and that even private contraventions may work no inequality between the parties at war, the benefit of them, will be left equally free and open to all.

as to individuals: “Our citizens have al­  
ways been free to make, vend and export  
arms. It is the constant occupation and  
livelihood of some of them. To suppress  
their callings, the only means, perhaps, of  
their existence, because a war exists in for­  
eign and distant countries in which we  
have no concern, would scarcely be expect­  
ed. It would be hard in principle and im­  
possible in practice. The law of nations,  
therefore, respecting the rights of those at  
peace does not require from them such an  
internal derangement of their occupation.  
It is satisfied with the external penalty pro­  
nounced in the President’s proclamation,  
that of confiscation of such portion of these  
arms as shall fall into the hands of the bel­  
ligerent power on their way to the ports of  
their enemies.”  
So, it would seem, the isurgents would  
have the right to purchase here all manner  
of munitions of war and ship them subject  
only to the risk of capture by the Spanish.  
The recognition of belligerency would also  
give to Spain and to Cuba, if it gets a navy,  
the right to hold up American ships when­  
ever they meet them and search them for  
articles contraband of war, and if these ar­  
ticles are destined for the use of the enem
