e Event of this business. I therefore put to your Excellency a Problem. Was the Discovery of Mr. Lawrens’s Papers a Mischief or not?  
Sir J. York does not seem to be in a hurry to go to England. He has been in this Town two days. Perhaps He means to pay court to the Governor, perhaps He has Affairs to arrange with the English resident, Who I suppose will be the Go between of England and Holland—I fancy the Residents Letters are addressed to Mr. Danoot a Banker here.  
I am pleased with the Text of the Sermon preached at Boston on the Choice of Mr. Hancock as Governor “And their Congregation shall be established; and their Nobles shall be of themselves; and their Governor shall proceed out of the Midst of them.” It was an Happy Choice of Words.  
The Answer and Resolves of Congress with respect to the Military will I Hope give Satisfaction.  
  
I am Sir your Excellancys Most Faithful &amp; Obedient Humble Servt.
