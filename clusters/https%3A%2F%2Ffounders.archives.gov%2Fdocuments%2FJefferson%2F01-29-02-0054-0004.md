[2 May 1797]  
  
“Our political situation is prodigiously changed since you left us. Instead of that noble love of liberty, and that republican government, which carried us triumphantly thro the dangers of the war, an Anglo-Monarchico-Aristocratic party has arisen.—Their avowed object is to impose on us the substance, as they have already given us the form, of the British government. Nevertheless, the principal body of our citizens remain faithful to republican principles. All our proprietors of lands are friendly to those principles, as also the mass of men of talents. We have against us (republicans) the Executive Power, the Judiciary Power, (two of the three branches of our government) all the officers of government, all who are seeking offices, all timid men who prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty, the British merchants and the Americans who trade on British capitals, the speculators, persons interested in the bank and the public funds. [Establishments invented with views of corruption, and to assimilate us to the British model in its corrupt parts.]  
“I should give you a fever, if I should name the apostates who have embraced these heresies; men who were Solomons in council, and Sampsons in combat, but whose hair has been cut off by the whore England. [In the original, par la catin Angleterre, probably alluding to the woman’s cutting off the hair of Sampson, and his loss of strength thereby.]  
“They would wrest from us that liberty which we have obtained by so much labor and peril; but we shall preserve it. Our mass of weight and riches is so powerful, that we have nothing to fear from any attempt against us by force. It is sufficient that we guard ourselves, and that we break the lilliputian ties by which they have bound us, in the first slumbers which succeeded our labors. It suffices that we arrest the progress of that system of ingratitude and injustice towards France, from which they would alienate us, to bring us under British influence, &amp;c.”  
Thus far the letter; to which are subjoined, in the French paper, the following remarks:  
“This interesting letter from one of the most virtuous and enlightened citizens of the United States, explains the conduct of the Americans in regard to France. It is certain that of all the neutral and friendly powers, there is none from which France had a right to expect more interest and succours than from the United States. She is their true mother country, since she has assured to them their liberty and independence.—Ungrateful children, instead of abandoning her, they ought to  have armed in her defense. But if imperious circumstances had prevented them from openly declaring for the Republic of France, they ought at least to have made demonstrations and excited apprehensions in England, that at some moment or other they should declare themselves. This fear alone would have been sufficient to force the cabinet of London to make peace. It is clear that a war with the United States would strike a terrible blow at the commerce of the English, would give them uneasiness for the preservation of their possessions on the American continent, and deprive them of the means of conquering the French and Dutch colonies.  
Equally ungrateful and impolitic, the Congress hastens to encourage the English, that they might pursue in tranquility their war of extermination against France and to invade the Colonies and the commerce of England.* They sent to London a minister, Mr. Jay, known by his attachment to England, and his personal relations to Lord Grenville, and he concluded suddenly a treaty of Commerce which united them with Great Britain, more than a treaty of alliance.  
Such a treaty, under all the peculiar circumstances, and by the consequences, which it must produce, is an act of hostility against France. The French government in front has testified the resentment of the French nation, by breaking off communication with an ungrateful and faithless ally, untill she shall return to a more just and benevolent conduct. Justice and sound policy equally approve this measure of the French government. There is no doubt it will give rise, in the United States, to discussions which may afford a triumph to the party of good republicans, the friends of France.  
Some writers, in disapprobation of this wise and necessary measure of the directory, maintain that in the United States, the French have for partizans only certain demagogues who aim to overthrow the existing government. But their imprudent falsehoods convince no one, and prove only what is too evident, that they use the liberty of the press, to serve the enemies of France.”  
[The foregoing letter wears all the external marks of authenticity. And yet it seems hardly possible an American could be capable of writing such a letter. As the letter is circulating in Europe, we deem it just, if a forgery, to give Mr. Jefferson an opportunity to disavow it.]

&quot;The interesting letter from one of the F

Ungrateful children, inttead of abandoning  
her, they ought to have armed in her de- p  
fence. But if imperious circumdances had  
prevented them from openly declaring far the  
Republic of Fiance, they ought at least to a  
have made demonstrations and excited appre-

oi other, they would declare themselves ?  
This fear alone would have been fufficient to a  
foice the Cabinet of London to make peace. 0  
It is clear that a war with the United States v

They sent Ito London a miniller, Mr. Jay,  
known by his attachment to England, and I  
his personal relations to lord Grenville, and  
he concluded suddenly a treaty of commerce  
which united them witb Great Britain, more

our series would be incomplete, if we were to  
leave out n vert&#x27; important document, we beg  
leave to offer to our readers’ consideration an  
extract from the letter to Maz/.ei, which has  
made so ranch noise, and which throws an  
additional light upon the character, the latent  
sentiments and opinions, of the writer. It  
  
made its appearance in May, 1707, about a  
year alter he had eulogized Mr. Adams in the  
Senate, as we have shewn in yesterday’s  
number.  
Mr. yeffersor&#x27;s Letter to JUmzci, first pub­  
lished in the United .States&#x27;, about the 4th Ma:j  
1797.  
‘ Our political situation is prodigiousl}  
‘ changed since you left us. Instead ol&#x27;that  
4 noble love of liberty and that republican go­  
4 vernment which carried us triumphantly  
4 through the dangers of the war, an anglo­  
4 monarehieo-anstoeraiiek party has arisen;  
‘ their avowed object is to impose on i:&gt; the sub­  
1 stance, as they have already given &quot;v the jurat,  
4 of the lirilisn government. Nevertheless the  
4 principal body of our citizens remain i&#x27;aith­  
4 ful to republican principles. All our pro­  
4 prietors ol lands are friendly to those prin­  
4 ciples ; as also the mass of men of talents.  
4 We have against us (republicans) the cx­  
4 lattice power, the judiciary power, (two of  
4 the three branches ol our government), alt  
4 the officers oj government, ail who are seek­  
4 ing offices, all timid men who prefer the  
4 calm ol despotism to the tempestuous sea ol  
4 liberty, the British merchants, and the A­  
4 mericans who trade on British capitals, the  
4 speculators, persons interested in the banks

that at some moment or other they would de-  
clare themselves: This fear alone would  
have been sufficient to force the cabinet of

war with the United States would strike a  
terrible blow at the commerce of the English,  
would give them uneasiness for the preserva-

* Equally ungrateful and impolitic, the  
Congress hastens to encourage the English,  
that they might pursue, in tranquillity, their

to invade the colonies and commerce of  
France. They sent to Londona minister,  
Mr. Jay, known by his attachment to Eng-  
jJand, aud his personal relations to Lord  
Grenville, and he concluded, suddenly, a  
treaty of commerce which united them with  
Great Britian more than a treaty of alli-  
ance.  
  
‘‘ Such a treaty, under all the peculiar  
circumstances, and by the consequences it  
must produce, is an act of hostility against  
France. The French government, in short,  
has testified the resentment of the French na-  
tion, by breaking off communication with an  
ungrateful and faithless ally, until she will re-  
turn to a more just and benevolent conduct.  
Justice and sound policy equally approve this

artiality of  
the first president (Washington) for a  
  
favorite (Hamilton) cast a shade upon  
his iflustrious fame, and produced a  
sertes of calamities to his country  
The same paper of April 13, 1802  
popies from the Paris Monitor of  
January 25, 1798  
Florence, January 1.From Mr  
  
Jefferson, late minister of the United  
States in France, and secretary to the  
department of foreign affairs, to a  
citizen of Virginia  
This letter, literally translated, is ad  
dressed to M. Mazzini, anthor of &quot;Re  
searches, Historical and Political, upon  
the United States of America,&quot; now  
resident in Tuscany.&quot; Says Jefferson  
Our political situation is prodigous  
ly changed since you left us. Instead  
of that noble love of liberty  
and that Re publican government  
  
which carried us through the war, an  
anglo-monarchico-arlstocratic party  
has risen. Their avowed object is­  
to impose on us the substance, as they  
have already given us the form, of the  
British Government. Nevertheless  
the great body of our citizens remain  
faithful to republican principles. All  
our proprietors of lands are friendly to  
those principles, as also the men of  
talents. We have againt us the exee  
utive power, the jud clary, all the offt  
cers of Government, all who are seel  
ing offices, all timid men who prefer  
the calm of despotism to the tem  
pestuous sea of liberty, the British  
merchants and the Americans who  
trade on British capital, the specula  
tors in stocks in the banks and public  
funds, establishments invented with a  
view to corrupting and to assimulate  
us to the British model in its corrupt  
pars  
I should give you a fover if I should  
name the apostates who have em­  
braced these heresies--men who were  
Solomons in council and Sampsons in  
  
conbat, but whose hatr has been ent  
  
off by this whore of England. They  
would wrest from us the liberty which  
we have obtained by so much labor  
and peril; but we shall preserve it­  
Our mass of weight and riches are so  
poweriul that we have nothing to fear  
from any attack against us by force  
It is sufficient that we guard ouselves  
and that we break the Lilliputian ties  
by which they have bound us in the  
first slumbers which succeeded our la  
bors. It suffices that we arrest the  
progress of the system of ingratitude  
and injustice towards France, from  
which they would alienate us, to  
bring us under British influence  
The following paragraph appears in  
the Ballance and Columbian Reposi  
tory, Tuesday, February 23, 18t  
Anthony Haswell, printer of the  
Vermont Gazette, in his paper of the  
8th inst., again asserts that Washing­  
ton never made an introductory com  
munication to congress that was re  
publican in matter and manner, and  
  
adds that his introductory mode was  
disgraced with mon rehical pageantry  
omposity and parade  
It was against this democratic edi­  
tor that the famous alien and sedition  
laws were aimed when passed  
and he was one of the first arrested  
and punished under their provision
