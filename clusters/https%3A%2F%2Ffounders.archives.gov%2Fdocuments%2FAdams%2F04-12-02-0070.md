“Vile Stanhope (Demons blush to tell)

They were never published, till very lately:

In twice three hundred places,

Chesterfield’s reputation now rests  
chiefly on his letters to his son; when he  
lived it was based on what he was, with-  
out them.  
  
Of course it was much mére splendid  
then, than it has been since. It is not  
likely that Chesterfield placed any undue  
stress upon manners, but he had for a  
son a dull-witted, awkward, clumsy  
clown, and undoubtedly few sons ever  
needed more’ the cultivation of graceful  
manners than he. Hence his father’s  
earnest endeavors to force them upon  
him, but all without avail. The follow-  
ing lines are very much to the point:
