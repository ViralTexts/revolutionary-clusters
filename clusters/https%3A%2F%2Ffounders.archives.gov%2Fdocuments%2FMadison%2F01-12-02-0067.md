Mr. Madison. Some gentlemen have seemed to call in question the policy of discriminating between nations in commercial alliance with the United States, and those with whom no treaties exist; for my own part, I am well satisfied that there are good and substantial reasons for making it; in the first place, it may not be unworthy of consideration, that the public sentiments of America will be favourable to such discrimination. I am sure with respect to that part from which I came, it will not be a pleasing ingredient in your laws, if they find foreigners of every nation put on a footing with those in alliance with us. There is another reason which perhaps is more applicable to some parts of the union than to others; one of the few nations with which America has formed commercial connections has relaxed considerably in that rigid policy it before pursued, not so far to be sure as America could wish, with respect to opening her ports to our trade, but she has permitted our ready built ships a sale, and entitles them to the same advantage, when owned by her own citizens, as if they had been built in France, subject

 There are also other considerations which ought to be taken into view. From artificial or adventitious causes the commerce between America and Great Britain exceeds what may be considered its natural boundary. I find from an examination of the accounts of tonnage for the three large states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and South Carolina, that the tonnage of nations in alliance with us holds no proportion with that of Great Britain, or of the United States. This is a proof, that a very small direct commerce takes place between those countries and this; that there is less of direct i

Mr. Madison. I am a friend to free commerce, and at the same time a friend to such regulations as are calculated to promote our own interest, and this on national principles. The great principle of interest is a leading one with me, and yet my combination of ideas on this head, leads me to a very different conclusion from that made by the gentleman from New-York (Mr. Lawrance). I wish we were under less necessity than I find we are to shackle our commerce with duties, restrictions and preferences; but there are cases in which it is impossible to avoid following the example of other nations in the great diversity of our trad

sion of the committee have proved them to be necessary.  
  
I beg leave to remark in answer to a train of ideas which the gentleman last up has brought into view, that although interest will in general operate effectually to produce political good, yet there are causes in which certain factitious circumstances may divert it from its natural channel, or throw or retain in an artificial one. Have we not been exercised on this topic for a long time past? Or why has it been necessary to give encouragement to particular species of industry, but to turn the stream in favor of an interest that would not otherwise succeed? But laying aside the illustration of these causes so well known to all nations, wh

man from New-York, (Mr. Lawrance) what evidence we had that the public sentiments of America were in favor of discrimination? Perhaps it would be improper on this occasion to adduce any other proof of the fact than from the transactions of public bodies, and here I think is abundant proof to be found. The state of Virginia, if I am not mistaken, lays a double duty on tonnage; French and Dutch vessels pay half a dollar per ton, while the vessels of Great-Britain are subjected to one dollar. There are other distinctions in our revenue laws manifesting the same principle; some of them establish a preference to French wines and brandy. In Maryland a similar policy has prevailed; I believe the difference there is about one third in f

an that proposed. The more the subject has been examined the greater necessity there appears for discrimination. If it is expedient for America to have vessels employed in commerce at all, it will be proper that she have enough to answer all the purposes intended; to form a school for seamen, to lay the foundation of a navy, and to be able to support itself against the interference of foreigners. I do not think there is much weight in what has been observed relative to the duty we are about to lay in favor of American vessels, being a burthen on the community, and particularly oppressive to some parts; but if there were, it may be a burthen of that kind which will ultimately save us from one that is greater.  
I consider that an acquisition of maritime strength is essential to this country; if ever we are so unfortunate as to be engaged in war, what but this can defend our towns and cities upon the sea-coast? Or what but this can enable us to repel an invading enemy? Those parts which are said to bear an undue proportion of the burthen of the additional duty on foreign shipping, are those that will be the most exposed to the operations of a depredatory war, and require the greatest exertions of the union in their defence; if therefore some little sacrifice is made by them to obtain this important object, they will be peculiarly rewarded for it in the hour of danger. Granting a preference to our own navigation will insensibly bring it forward to that perfection so essential to American safety; and though it may produce some little inequality at first, it will soon ascertain its level, and become uniform throughout the union.

ed leave to express an idea which he thought would reconcile gentlemen to a more considerable duty than seemed to be contemplated. It was admitted on all hands, that America did not furnish shipping sufficient for the transportation of her own produce, and the apparent quantity would decrease from what it was now represented to be, if gentlemen considered that the American vessels, mentioned in the custom-house reports, may clear three, four, five or six times [a] year, and consequently multiplied the gross amount without its being substantially true. Another circumstance that decreases this apparent quantity is, that foreigners have in some instances, in order to obtain the privileges of our ships, masked their property under the American name. This reduction of our shipping serves only to shew the indispensible necessity of applying means to raise it up to what it ought to be. But in doing this we ought to be careful in avoiding any sudden or violent effect upon our commerce by the rise of freight. Let then the operat

¬´ President Madison is still more explicit upon the subject:‚Äî‚Äò If it is  
expedient for America to have vessels employed in commerce at all, it  
will be proper that she have enough to answer all the purposes intended ;  
to forma school for seamen; to lay the foundation of a navy ; and be  
able to support itself against the interference of fureiguers. I do not  
think thatthere is much weight in the observations, that the duty we are  
about to lay in favour of American vessels is a burden on the communi-  
ty, and particularly oppressive to some parts; but if there were, it may  
be a burden of that kind which will ultimately save us from one that is  
greater. I consider an acquisition of maritime strength essential to this  
country ; should we ever be so unfortunate as to be engaged in war, what  
but this can defend our towns and cities upon the sea coast? Or what  
but this can enable us to repel an invading enemy? Those parts which  
are said to bear an undue proportion of the burden of the additional du-  
ty on foreign shipping are those which will be most exposed to the oper-  
ations of a predatory war, and will require the greatest exertions of the  
Union in their defence. If, therefore, some little sacrifice be made by  
them to obtain this important object, they will be peculiarly rewarded  
for it in the hour of dinger. Granting a preference t¬ª our own naviga-  
tion ,will insensibly bring it forward to that perfection so essential to  
American safety; and, though it may produce some little inequality at  
first, it will soon ascertain its level, and become uniform throughout the  
Union.‚Äô ‚Äù
