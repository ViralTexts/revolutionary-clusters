. The duties mentioned in this Act are upon all ships or Vessels entered in the United States.  
The entry therefore is the circumstance, which regulates the payment of the duty.  
But a doubt has arisen, whether the duty ought to be deemed to accrue on every entry, or only on entries from foreign countries.  
The construction which has been adopted, is, that it accrues on every entry, whether from abroad, or in one part of the United States from another.  
One reason for this construction results from the second Section; which provides, that Vessels built and owned in the United States, whilst employed in the Coasting trade or fisheries, shall not pay Tonnage more than once a year. If the duty w

course of the business will lead to the appointment of a special Committee to prepare a bill for amending the laws under consideration, there are reasons, which, with the permission of the House, would induce him to reserve a more particular communication on this part of the subject for that Committee.  
14. Section V. This Section contemplates a provision of boats for securing the collection of the revenue; but no authority to provide them, is any where given. Information from several quarters, proves the necessity of having them; nor can they, in the opinion of the Secretary, fail to contribute, in a material degree, to the security of the revenue; much more than will compensate for the expence of the establishment; the utility of which will increase in proportion as the public exigencies may require an augmentation of the duties. An objection has been made to the measure as betraying an improper distrust of the Merchants; but that objection can have no weight, when it is considered, that it would be equally applicable to all the precautions comprehended in the existing system; all which proceed on a supposition too well founded to be doubted, that there are persons concerned in trade, in every country, who will, if they can, evade the public dues, for their private benefit. Justice to the body of the Merchants of the United States, demands an acknowlegment, that they have very generally manifested a disposition to conform to the national laws, which does them honor, and authorises confidence in their probity. But every considerate member of that body, knows, that this confidence admits of exceptions, and that it is essentially the interest of the greater number, that every possible guard should be set on the fraudulent few; which does not in fact tend to the embarassment of trade.  
The following is submitted as a proper establishment for this purpose.  
That there be ten boats: two, for the coasts, bays and harbours of Massachusetts and New Hampshire; one, for the Sound between Long-Island and Connecticut; one, for the Bay of New York; one, for the Bay of Delaware; two, for the Bay of Chesapeak; (these of course to ply along the neighboring coasts); one, for the coasts, bays and harbours of North Carolina; one, for the Coasts, bays and harbours of South Carolina; and one, for the Coasts, bays &amp; harbours of Georgia.  
Boats of from thirty six to forty feet keel, will answer the purpose, each having one Captain, one Lieutenant and six mariners, and armed with swivels. The first cost of one of these boats, completely equipped, may be computed at One thousand dollars.  
The following is an estimate of the annual expence  
  
  
10 Captains  
@ 40. dollars per month  
4,800  
  
  
10 Lieutenants  
@ 25. ditto per ditto  
3.000  
  
  
60 seamen  
@ 8. ditto per ditto  
5.760  
  
  
Provision  
3.000  
  
  
Wear and Tear  
 2.000  
  
  
Dollars  
18.560  
  
  
The utility of an establishment of this nature must depend on the exertion, vigilance and fidelity of those, to whom the charge of the boats shall be confided. If these are not respectable characters, they will rather serve to screen, than detect fraud. To procure such, a liberal compensation must be given, and in addition to this, it will, in the opinion of the Secretary, be adviseable, that they be commissioned as Officers of the Navy. This will not only induce fit men the more readily to engage, but will attach them to their duty by a nicer sense of honor.

red, before the duties can be ascertained. The object however of the provision is proper, and it must be construed to admit a gross estimate of the sum in the first instance, subject to after revision. It would, however, be desireable, that a discretion of this sort should be expressed. The Collector, together with the Naval Officer, where there is one, or alone where there is none, may be authorised to determine the amount of the duties to be paid, by an estimate of the same, according to the best of their or his judgment; and the Collector may be empowered in case of an over estimate, either to return the excess, if the money has been paid, or to endorse a credit for it on the bond.  
A discount of ten per Cent is here allowed for prompt payment, on the excess of any sum of dut

t in conjunction and in the presence of each other; among other things jointly administering and certifying all oaths required to be taken at the Custom houses.  
Section XXX. This section provides for the receipt of the duties in gold and silver coin only. The Secretary has considered this provision, as having for object the exclusion of payments in the paper emissions of particular states, and the securing the immediate or ultimate collection of the duties in specie; as intended to prohibit to individuals, the right of paying in any thing except Gold or Silver Coin, but not to hinder the treasury from making such arrangements, as its exigencies, the speedy command of the public resources and the convenience of the community might dictate; those arrangements being compatible with the eventual receipt of the duties in specie. For instance, The Secretary did not imagine, that the provision ought to be so understood, as to prevent, if necessary, an anticipation of the duties by treasury drafts, receivable at the several custom houses. And if it ought not to be understood in this sense, it appeared to him, that the principle of a different construction would extend to the permitting the receipt of the notes of public banks, issued on a specie fund. Unless it can be supposed that the exchanging of specie, after it has been received for bank notes to be remitted to the Treasury is also interdicted, it seems difficult to conclude, that the receipt of them, in the first instance, is forbidden.  
Such were the reflections of the Secretary with regard to the authority to permit bank notes to be taken in payment of the duties. The expediency of doing it, appeared to him still less questionable. The extension of their circulation by the measure, is calculated to increase both the ability and the inclination of the banks to aid the government. It also accelerates the command of the product of the revenues for the public service, and it facilitates the payment of the duties. It has the first effect, because the course of business occasions the notes to be sent beforehand to distant places; and being ready on the spot either for payment or exchange, the first post, after the duties become payable or are received, conveys them to the treasury. The substitution of Treasury drafts, anticipating the duties, could hardly be made without some sacrifice on the part of the public. As they would be drawn upon time, and upon the expectation of funds to be collected and of course contingent, it is not probable, that they would obtain a ready sale, but at a discount, or upon long credit. As they would also be more or less liable to accident, from the failure of expected payments, there would be, continually, a degree of hazard to public credit. And to other considerations it may be added, that the practice of anticipations of this kind is in its nature so capable of abuse as to render it an ineligible instrument of administration, in ordinary cases, and fit only for times of necessity.  
If the idea of anticipation should be excluded, then the relying wholly upon Treasury drafts would be productive of considerable delay. The knowlege that funds were in hand, must precede the issuing of them. Here would of course be some loss of time. And as the moment of demand, created by the course of business, would frequently elapse, there would as frequently be a further loss of time in waiting for a new demand. In such intervals, the public service would suffer, the specie would be locked up, and circulation checked.  
Bank notes being a convenient species of money, whatever increases their circulation, increases the quantity of current money. Hence the payment of duties is doubly promoted by their aid; they at once add to the quantity of medium, and serve to prevent the stagnation of specie.  
The tendency of the measure to lessen the necessity of drawing specie from distant places to the seat of government, results from the foregoing considerations. The slow operation of treasury drafts, would frequently involve a necessity of bringing on specie, to answer the exigencies of the government; the avoiding of which, as much as possible, in the particular situation of this country, need not be insisted upon.  
But convinced as the Secretary is of the usefulness of the regulation; yet, considering the nature of the clause, upon which these remarks arise, he thought it his duty to bring the subject under the eye of the House. The measure is understood by all concerned to be temporary.  
Indeed whenever a national bank shall be instituted, some new disposition of the thing will be a matter of course.

The benefit of it is intended for any person by whom the goods may be exported, whether that person be the importer of them or another, and yet the oath to be taken by the exporter, is of such a nature as must be very difficult to any but the Importer.

the cancelling of the bond is made to depend, among other things, upon the oath or affirmation of the Master and Mate of the Vessel, in which the goods are exported, attesting their delivery: a requisite which it may not always be possible to fulfil. The Master or Mate may die, or may quit the vessel, from different causes, without complying with it. These circumstances seem to require some other modifications. The Secretary has had an eye to them in the draft of the bill accompanying his report of the ninth of January last, to which he begs leave respectfully to refer.  
26. Section XL. This Section provides, that no goods, wares or merchandize of foreign growth or manufacture subject of the payment of duties, shall be brought into the United States otherwise than by Sea, and in ships or vessels of not less than thirty tons burthen, with an exception as to the district of Louisville, and another as to Vessels at the time of the passing of the act on their Voyage.

The entry and the receiving and qualifying to a manifest being joined together by the word and are understood as one service, to which a fee of sixty cents is attached; so that when only either of the two things is performed, and not the other, no fee is taken.  
Hence there is no allowance for swearing the Master to his Manifest, and granting a certificate of its having been done, according to the twenty fifth and twenty sixth sections of this act, because it is not accompanied in either case, with an inward entry.

&quot;This section [-itlih of the revenue act of 17r!&#x27;] pro- J  
I vitles fi r the receipt of the duties in gold and stiver j  
I coin only. The Secretary has considered this provision J

ing the immediate or ultimate collection of the duties in i

eventual receipt of tlie duties in specie. * &quot; &quot;j  
Such were the reflections of the Secretary with regard i  
to the authority to permit hank notes tn be taken in pay- j  
menlof the duties. The expediency of doing it. appear- I  
ed to him to be still less questionable. The extension i  
of their circulation by I lie measure is calculated to in ;  
crease both tlie ability and inclination of the banks to  
aid the Government. * &quot; * Bank notes !  
j being a convenient species of money, whatever inert as- &#x27;  
es their circulation, increases the quantity of current  
money. * ? ? ?jnt convinced as the Sccietnry  
is, of the usefulness of the regulation, vet, considering  
the nature of the clause upon which these re- i  
marks arise, he thought it his duly to bring the subject  
under the eye of the House. The measure is understood j  
by all concerned to be temporary. Indeed, whenever a i  
national bank shall be instituted, some new disposition  
of the thing will be a matter of course.

prevent, if necessary, an anticipation ot duties by  
Treasury diatts, receivable at the several custom  
houses. And if it ought to be understood in this  
sense, it appeared to him that the principle of a dif­  
ferent cons: ruction would extend to the permitting  
the receipt of the notes of public banks, issued on a  
specie lund. Unless it can be supposed that the ex­  
changing of specie, afrer it has b.&#x27;en received, for  
the bank notes to be remitted lo the Treasury, in also  
interdicted, it seems difficult to conclude that the  
receipt of them, in the first instance, is forbidden.  
&quot;Such were the reflections of the Secretary with  
regard to the authority to permit bank notes to be  
taken in payment ol duties. The expediency of  
doing it appeared to him to be still less questionable.  
The extension of their circulation by the measure,  
is calculated to increase bolh the ability and the in­  
clination of the banks to aid the Government. It  
also accelerates the command of the prenlnct of the  
rev-.&#x27;nues for the public service, and it facilitates the  
payment of the duties. It has the first effect, because  
il business occasions the notes to be sent beforehand  
to distant places; and being ready on lhe spot, either  
for payment or exchange, &#x27;he first post after the du­  
ties become payable, or are received, conveys them  
to the Treasury. The substitution of Treasury  
drafts, anticipating the duties, could hardly be made  
without some sacrifice on the part of thenpublic. As  
they would be drawn up n time, and upon the ex­  
pectation of funds to be collected, and, of course, con­  
tingent, it is not prob tble that they would obtain a  
ready sale but at a discount, or upon long credit. As  
they would also be more or less liable to accident,  
frjuri the failure of expected payments, there would  
b_&gt; continually a degree of hazard to public credit.  
And to other considerations il may bi2 added that the  
practice of anticipation ot this kind, is in its nature, so  
capable of abuse, as to render it an ineligible instru­  
ment of administration, in ordinary cases, and fit  
onlv for times of necessity.  
&quot;If the idea of anticipation should be excluded,  
then the relying wholly upon Treasury drafts would  
be productive of considerable delay. The know­  
ledge that funds were in hand must precede the is­  
suing of them. Here would, of couise, be some loss  
of time. And as the moment of demand, created by  
the course of business, would frequently elapse, there  
would as frequently be a further loss of time in wait­  
ing for a new demand. In such intervals, the public  
service would suffer, the specie would be lock d up,  
and circulation checked. Bank notes, being a con­  
venient species of money, whatever increases their  
circulation, increase the quantity of current money.  
Hence the payment of duties is.doubly promoted by  
their aid; they at once add to the quantity of me­  
dium, and serve to prevent the stagnation of specie.  
&quot;The tendency of the measure to les en the ne­  
cessity &lt;&gt;f drawing specie from distant places to the  
seat of Government, results from the foregoing con­  
hid .&#x27;rations. The slow operations of Treasury drafts  
would frequently involve a necessity of bringing on  
specie to answer the exigencies of Government; the  
avoiding of which, as much as possible, in the par­  
ticular situation of this country, need not be insisted  
upon.  
&quot; But convinced, as the Secretary is, of the useful­  
ness of the regulation, yet, considering the nature of  
the clause upon which these remarks arise, he thought  
it his duty u&gt; bring the subject under the eye of the  
House: The measure is understood, by all con­  
cerned, to be temporary.  
&quot; Indeed, whenever &quot;n National Bank shall be- in­  
stituted, some new disposition of the thing will be a  
matter of course.

House of Representatives, in which, referring to this sec-

through his efforts the first vessels bearing the revenue flag were

precisely as were army and navy officers.  
  
The first step relative to the establishment of the revenue marine  
service is found in a communication directed to the House of Repre-  
sentatives under date of April 23, 1790, and headed “Operations of  
the act laying duties on imports.” Section 5th contemplates a “ pro-

Secretary submits his estimate. Ten boats, from thirty-six to forty feet  
keel, were considered amply sufficient to meet the requirements of the  
young republic.  
  
‘Each one to have one captain, one lieutenant, and six mariners, and armed  
with swivels. The first cost of one of these boats completely equipped may be com-  
  
puted at $1000.  
‘‘ The following is an estimate of the amount expended :

“The utility of an establishment of this nature must depend on the exertion,  
vigilance, and fidelity of those to whom the charge of the boats shall be confided.  
If these are not respectable characters, they will rather serve to screen than detect  
fraud. To procure such, a liberal compensation must be given, and, in addition to  
this, it will, in the opinion of the Secretary, be advisable that they be commissioned  
as officers of the navy. This will not only induce fit men the more readily to en-  
gage, but will attach them to their duty by a nicer sense of honor.

This section contemplates a provision of boatgg for secur-

vide them is anywhcre given. Information from several

jection has beev made to the measure, as betraying an im-

Chesapeake (these of course to ply along the neighboring  
coasts); one for North Carolina; one for South lina ;  
and one for Georgia. Boats of from thirty-six to forty feet  
keel will answer the purpose, each baving one capiain, one  
lieutenant, and six marince, and armed with swivels, The  
first cost of one of these boats, completely equipped, may  
be computed at one thousand dollars. The following is an
