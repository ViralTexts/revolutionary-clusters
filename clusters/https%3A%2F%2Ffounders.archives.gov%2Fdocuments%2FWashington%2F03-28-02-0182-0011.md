Sir  
Head Quarters [Tappan] Septemr 30th 1780  
  
In answer to Your Excellency’s letter of the 26th instant, which I have had the honor to receive, I am to inform you, that Major André was taken under such circumstances, as would have justified the most summary proceedings against him. I determined, however, to refer his case to the examination and decision of a Board of General Officers; who have, on his free and voluntary confession and letters, reported—First. “That he came on shore from the Vulture Sloop of War in the night of the twenty first of September [instant] on an interview with General Arnold in a private and secret manner. secondly—that he changed his dress within our lines, and under a feigned name and in a disguised Habit, passed our Works at Stony and Verplanks points the evening of the twenty second of September [instant], and was taken the morning of the twenty third of September [instant], at Tarry Town, in a disguised Habit, being then on his way to New York, and when taken, he had in his possession several papers which contained intelligence for the Enemy. The Board having maturely considered these facts do also report to his Excellency Genl Washington—that Major André Adjutant General to the British Army ought to be considered as a Spy from the Enemy, and that agreeable to the law and usage of Nations it is their opinion he ought to suffer death.”  
From these proceedings it is evident Major André was employed in the execution of Measures, very foreign to the objects of Flags of Truce, and such as they were never meant to authorise or countenance in the most distant degree—and this Gentleman confessed with the greatest candor in the course of his examination “that it was impossible for him to suppose he came on shore under the sanction of a Flag.” I have the honor to be Your Excellency’s Most obt and most humble Servt

Major André to be a spy, and unless these grounds justified the  
conclusion based on them, we are bound to hold that conclusion a

of his authority, had a right to grant.  
But clearly these safeguards were viti-  
ated by the treasonable purpose of the  
commander who granted them, and in  
availing himself of them André, who  
was privy to this treasonable purpose,  
took his life in his hands as completely  
as any ordinary spy would do. André  
himself had already candidly admitted  
before the court “that it was impos-  
sible for him to suppose that he came  
ashore under the sanction of a flag;”  
and Washington struck to the root of  
the matter, as he invariably did, in his

André “ was employed in the execution  
  
of measures very foreign to the objects  
  
of flags of truce, and such as they were  
never meant to authorize or countenance  
in the most distant degree.” The ar-  
gument was conclusive, but it was not  
strange that the British general should  
have been slow to admit its force. He  
begged that the question might be sub-

army and Rochambeau from the other
