					I have an opportunity by Mr. Bethune, who leaves Town Tomorrow, for Falmouth, to embark for the United States in the British Packet; and I cannot omit to take Advantage of it,  
						although I have still nothing conclusive to communicate.  
					The Hope arrived off Falmouth, and landed Mr. Atwater, on the 16th. of last Month; she immediately proceeded on her Voyage to France with a fair Wind. Mr. Atwater arrived in London  
						on the 20th. in the Evening, and delivered your Letter of the 18th. of July.  
					My public Letter, of the 4th. of August, will have apprized you of the Footing, on which my different Interviews with Mr. Canning left the Subject of the British Orders in Council;  
							and my private Letter, of the 2d. of that Month, will have made you acquainted with my Intention to present, in an Official Note, what I had ineffectually suggested in Conference.  
					To such a Course there could not, even in the first Instance, have been any other Objection than that it was calculated to lead to Discussion rather than to Ajustment but, whatever  
						might be its Tendency, it is certain, that I could have no Inducement to resort to it until it was indicated by Mr. Canning as indispensable, nor any Motive to decline it afterwards.  
					At our last Interview, and not before, it was unexpectedly found, that it was in that Mode only that I could obtain a Knowledge of the Light in which this Government thought fit to  
						view the Overture I had been directed to make to it; and I determined, in Consequence, to lay before it in Writing the Intentions of the President, with the same Frankness which had characterized  
							my verbal Communications.  
					I have now the Honour to transmit a Copy of the Note, which, in Conformity with that Determination, I delivered in Person to Mr. Canning on the 26th. of last Month, a few Days after  
						its Date. To this Note no Answer has yet been returned; but it is to be presumed that it will not be much longer withheld.  
					You will perceive that some Time had elapsed, after I had sent off my dispatches by the St. Michael (the 8th. of August) before my Note was presented. The Truth is, that I had  
						employed a Part of that Time in framing a Note of great Length, which, when nearly Completed, I thought it prudent to abandon, in favour of one that held out fewer Invitations to unprofitable  
						Discussions, which,  although I would not shun them if pressed upon me, I did not suppose it proper that I should seek.  
					I believed, too, that a little Delay on my Part would be far from being disadvantageous. There would still be sufficient Time for obtaining a final Answer to my proposal, in Season for the Meeting of Congress; and, as  
						the Temper of the Government, so far as it had been tried had not appeared to be favourable to my Purpose, I believed that I should act in the Spirit of my Instructions, and consult the Honour of my Government by avoiding, under such Circumstances the  
						Appearance of Urgency and Precipitation.  
					Upon the Terms or general Plan of my Note it is not I hope necessary to remark. You will discover that it was prepared under a Persuasion that, whatever might be its Effect, it was infinitely better to make it as conciliatory as, without a Sacrifice of  
						Principle or national Dignity, was possible.  
					The Topics to be embraced by it were such as did not demand, but rather forbade, minute Exposition. While it was difficult to urge in their full Force, without seeming to aim at exciting a Disposition unfriendly to the Object of my  
						Instructions, all the Considerations which justified the United States in remonstrating against the British Orders, it was yet more difficult, without a Degree of Harshness, scarcely suited to the Occasion, and without also  
							the Hazard of Indiscretion, to display in Detail the signal Injustice and Impolicy of persevering in them after what I had proposed. This could be done, and had been done, in Conversation; but it did not, upon Trial, appear to be  
						equally practicable in the more formal and measured Proceeding which I was now called upon to adopt.  
					I considered, besides, that an Overture so highly advantageous to Great-Britain which the United States were not bound to make by any Obligations of Equity although it was wise to make it,  
							did not require, with any View to the Character of my Country, or even to the Success of the Overture itself, to be again recommended by an anxious Repetition of Arguments already fully understood.  
					As soon as my Note was prepared, I called at the foreign office, to arrange an Interview with Mr. Canning, for the Purpose of enabling me to accompany the Delivery of it, with a Communication which I deemed important,  
						as well as of affording him an Opportunity of asking and receiving such Explanations as he might desire. The Interview took place on the 26th. of August.  
					It had occurred to me that it would be proper, (and could not be injurious) to read to Mr. Canning, from your Letter to me of the 17th. of July, a brief Summary of the Instructions  
						under which I was acting. This had not been requested, but it could not be unacceptable; and it was, besides, well calculated to do Justice to the liberal Sentiments by which my  
						Instructions had been dictated, as well as to give Weight to my Efforts in the Execution of them.  
					I was led by the reading of these Passages (without having originally intended it) into a more extensive Explanation than I had before attempted, of the Influence which the Proposal of my Government would have, in Truth  
						as well as in the Judgment of the World, upon the supposed Justice of their new System as it affected the United States. To that Explanation, with the particulars of which I will not, as indeed for Want of Time cannot,

London, Sefit. 6th, 1808.  
  
I have an opportunity of writ-  
ing by Mr. Bethune, who leaves  
town to-morrow for Falmouth, to  
embark for the United States in  
the British packet ; and I cannot  
omit to take advantage of it, al-  
though I have still nothing con-  
elusive to communicate.  
  
The Hope arrived off Fal-  
mouth, and landed Mr. Atwater,  
enthe 16th of last month, and  
immediately proceeded on her  
voyage to Havre, with a fair  
wind. Mr. Atwater arrived in  
London on the 20th, in the even-  
ing, and delivered your letter of  
the 18th of July.  
  
My public letter of the 4th of  
August will have apprised you of  
the footing on which my different  
interviews with Mr. Canning left  
the subject of the British orders  
in council ; and my private letter  
of the 2d of that month, will  
have made you acquainted with  
my intention to present, in an of-  
ficial note, what I had ineffectu-  
ally suggested in conference.  
  
Te such a course there could  
not, even in the first instance,  
have been any other objection  
than that it was calculated to lead  
to discussion, rather than to ad-  
yustment; but, whatever might  
be its tendency, it is certain that  
I could have no inducement to  
resort to it, until it was indicated  
by Mr. Canning as indispensible ,  
nor any motive to decline it, af-  
terwards.  
  
At our last interview, and not  
before, it was unexpectedly  
found, that it was in that mode  
only, that I could obtain a know-  
  
=  
  
ledge of the light in which this  
government thought fit to view  
the overture I had been directed  
to make to it; and I determined,  
in consequence, to lay before it,  
in writing, the intentions of the  
president, with the same frank-  
ness which had characterized my  
verbal communications.  
  
I have now the honor to trans-  
mit a copy of the note, which, in  
conformity with that determina-  
tion, I delivered in person to Mr.  
Canning on the 26th of last  
month, a few days after its date.  
To this note no answer has yet  
been returned ; but it is to be pre-  
sumed, that it will not be much  
longer withheld.  
  
You will perceive, that some  
time had elapsed, after I had sent  
off my dispatches by the St. Mi-  
chael (the 8th of August) before  
my note was presented. The  
truth is, that I had employed a  
part of that time in framing a  
note of great length, which, when  
nearly completed, I thought it  
prudent to abandon, in favor of  
one that held out fewer invita-  
tions to unprofitable discussions,  
which, although I would not shun  
them, if pressed upon me, I did  
not suppose it proper that I should  
seek.  
  
I believed, too, that a little de-  
lay on my part would be far from  
being disadvantageous. There  
would still be sufficient time for  
obtaining a final answer to my  
proposal, in season for the meet-  
ing of congress ; and as the tem-  
per of this government, so far as  
it had been tried, had not appear-  
ed to be favorable to my purpose,  
I believed that I should act in the  
spirit of my instructions, and con-

stances, the appearance of ur-  
gency and precipitation.  
  
Upon the terms or general-  
plan of my note, it is not, I hope,  
necessary to remark. You will  
discover, that it was prepared un-  
der a persuasion that, whatever  
might be its effect, it was infinite-  
ly better to make it as conciliato-  
ry as, without a sacrifice of prin-  
ciple or national dignity, was pos-  
sible.  
  
The topics to be embraced by  
it, were such as did not demand,  
but rather forbade, minute expo-  
sition. While it was difficult to  
urge, in their full force, without  
seeming to aim at exciting a dis-  
position unfriendly to the object  
of my instructions, all the consi-  
derations which justified the U.  
States in remonstrating against  
the British orders, it was yet  
  
- more difficult, without a degree  
  
of harshness, scarcely suited to  
the occasion, and without also the  
hazard of indiscretion, to display  
in detail the signal injustice and  
impolicy of persevering in them,  
after what I had proposed. This  
could be done, and had been done  
in conversation ; but it did not,  
upon trial, appear to be equally  
practicable, in the more formal  
and measured proceeding which  
I was now called upon to a-  
dopt.  
  
I considered, besides, that an  
overture, so highly advantageous  
to Great Britain, which the Unit-  
ed States were not bound to make  
by any obligations of equity, al-  
though it was wise to make it,  
did not require, with any view to  
the character of my country, or  
even to the success of the over-  
ture itself, to be again recom-  
mended, by an anxious repetition  
  
of arguments already fully un-  
derstood.  
  
As soon as my note was pre-  
pared, I called at the foreign of-  
fice to arrange an interview with  
Mr. Canning, for the purpose of  
enabling me to accompany the  
delivery of it with a communica-  
tion, which I deemed important,  
as well as of affording him an op-  
portunity of asking and receiving  
such explanations as he might  
desire. The interview took place  
on the 26th of August.  
  
It had occurred to me that it  
would be proper (and could not be  
injurious) to read to Mr. Can-  
ning, from your letter to me of  
the 18th of July, a brief sum-  
mary of the instructions under  
which I was acting. This had  
not been requested ; but it could  
not be unaeceptable, and it was,  
besides, well calculated to do jus-  
tice to the liberal sentiments by  
which my instructions had been  
dictated, as well as to give weight  
to my efforts, in the execution of  
them.  
  
I was led by the reading of  
these passages, (without having  
originally intended it) into a more  
extensive explanation, than 1 had  
before attempted, of the influence  
which the proposal of my govern-  
ment would have, in truth, as  
well as in the judgment of the  
world, upon the supposed justice  
of their new system, as it affect-  
ed the United States. To that  
explanation, with the particulars  
of which I will not, and indeed,  
for want of time, cannot, at pre-  
sent trouble you, I added a con-  
cise recapitulation of some of the  
prudential considerations which  
had been so often pressed before,  
and there I left the subject.

last in..nth, a few days after its dale. To this note  
no . ova r has yet been returned; but it is to be pre­  
sumed, that it will not be much longer withheld.  
“ You will perceive, that some tune bad elapsed,  
after I had sent ott&#x27;my dispatches by the St. Micha­

ed—The truth is, that I had employed a part of that  
time in framing a note of great length, which, when  
nearly rompleted, I thought it prudent to abandon,  
in favour of one th u held nut fewer invitations to  
unprofitable discussions, which, although I would  
not shun them il pressed upon me, I did not suppose  
it proper that I should seek.  
V 1 believed, too, that a little delay on my part,  
wofld be tar fiom Icing disadvantageous. There  
would still he sufficient time lur obtaining a final  
answer to my proposal, in season for the meetiug  
of rongiess ; and us the temper of this government,  
so lur as it had been tiled, had not appeared to be  
favourable to my purpose, 1 believed that I should  
a t .0 the spirit of mv instructions, a.id cousult the

that it wii prepared under a persuasion that, what­  
ever might be its effect, it was infinitely better to  
make it as conciliatory as, without a sacrifice oi  
, pruinple nr national dignity, was possible.  
“ The topi, s to be embraced by it, were such as  
did uol demand, but r-illier torhade minute exposi­  
tion. While it was difficult to urge, in their lull  
I&#x27;orce, without seeming to aim at exciting a disposi­  
tion unlnendly to the object ot luy instructions, all  
the considerations which justified the Unit&#x27; d States  
in remonstrating against the British oiders, it whs  
yet more difficult, without a degree of harshness,  
scarcely suited to the occasion, and without also  
the baz iru of mdikcrelion, to display in detail the  
signal injustice and impolicy pfrptrsewring in them,  
after what 1 had proposed. This could be dene, and  
had been dene in . omcisation; but it dal not, upon  
trial, appear to be equally practicable, in the more  
hirinal and measured proceeding which 1 was now  
calh d upon to adopt.  
“ 1 considered, besides, that an overture, so high­

I have nn opportunity of writing by Mr.  
Bethunc, who leaves town to-morrow for  
Falmouth, to embark for the United States in  
the British packet, and I cannot omit to take  
advantage of it, although I have still nothing  
conclusive to communicate.  
The Hope arrived o(7 Falmouth, and land­  
ed Mr. Atwater, on the 16th of last month,  
and immediately proceeded on her voyage  
to Havre, with a fair wind. Mr. Atwater  
arrived in London on the 20th, in the even­  
ing, and delivered your letter of tltc 18th  
of July.  
My pnhlie letter of the d*.li August, will  
  
•.lave sip}&gt;rite&lt;J yin nt the toohn* th uh-cti •  
my diacrcnt interviews with Mr. Canning!  
Utt the subject oi the British tut levs in cwui- !  
eil, and my private letter of the 2d of that 1  
month, will have&#x27;made von acquainted with  
my intention to present&quot;, in an official note,  
what I-had ineffectually suggested in confer­  
ence.  
To such a course there could not, even  
in the first instance, have been any other ob­  
jection, than that it was calculated to lead to  
discussion rather than to adjustment ; but,  
whatever might be its tendency, it is cer­  
tain, that i could have no inducement to re­  
sort to it, until it was indicated bv Mr. Can­  
ning as indispensable, nor any motive to de­  
cline it afterwards.  
At our last interview, and not before, it  
was unexpectedly found that it was in that  
mode only that] could obtain a knowledge of  
the light in which this government thought  
lit to view the overture I had been directed  
to make to it ; and 1 determined in conse­  
quence to lay before it in writing the inten­  
tions of the President, with the same frank­  
ness which had characterized my verbal  
communications.  
I have now the honor to transmit a copy of  
the note, which in conformity with that deter­  
mination, I delivered, in person to Mr. Can­  
ning, on the 20th of last month, a few days  
after its date. To this note, no answer has  
Vet been returned ; but it is to be presumed,  
that it will not be much longer withheld.  
^ on will perceive that some time had e­  
lapsed, after Iliad sent ofl&#x27;my dispatches by  
the St. Michael, (the 8th August,) before  
my note was presented. The truth is, that  
I had employed a part of that time in fra­  
ming a note of great length, which, when  
nearly completed, I thought it prudent to a­  
bandon, in favor of one that held out fewer  
invitations to unprofitable discussions, which,  
although, I would not shun tnem if pressed  
upon me, I did not suppose it proper that I  
should seek.  
  
» I lu&#x27;lipvp tnn thnt* n litMp rlplau rn mv I  
I part, would be far from being disadvantage*  
| ons. &#x27;J&#x27;here would still be sufficient time for  
obtaining a final answer to my proposal,  
I in season for the meeting of Congress ; and  
as the temper of the government, so far as I  
it Inti been tried, had not appeared to be fa­  
vorable toP&#x27;y purpose, I believe that I should  
act in thespirit of my instructions, and con­  
sult the honor of my government, by avoid­  
ing, under such circumstances, the appear­  
ance ot urgency and precipitation.  
Upon the terms, or general plan of my  
note, it isnnt, I hope, necessary to remark.  
You will discover that it was prepared un­  
der a persuasion, that whatever might he  
its effect, it was infinitely better to make it  
as conciliatory as. without a sacrifice of prin­  
ciple or national dignity, was possible.  
The topics, to be embraced by it, were  
such as did not demand, but rather forbade,  
j minute exposition While it was difficult to  
(urge, in their full force, without seeming to  
j aim at exciting a disposition unfriendly to  
j the object of my instructions, all the consi­  
; derations which justified the United states  
in remonstrating against the British orders ;  
it was yet more difficult, without a degree  
of harshness, scarcely suited to the occasi­  
on, and without, also, the hazard of indis­  
cretion, to display, in detail, the signal in­  
justice and impolicy of persevering in them,  
after what 1 had proposed. This could he  
done, and had been done in conversation ;  
but it did not, upon trial, appear to be e­  
qiutily practicable in the more formal and  
measured proceeding, which I was now cal­  
led upon to adopt.  
1 considered, besides, that an overture, so j  
highly advantageous to Great- h, itain, which I  
the United States were not hound to make I  
by any obligations of equity, although it was j  
wise to make it, did not require, with any  
view to the character of my country, or e- •  
ven to the success of the overture itself, to!  
be again recommended by an anxious repc-1  
tition of arguments already fully understood. ■  
As soon as my note was prepared, I cal- i  
led at the foreign office, to arrange an inter-;  
view with Mr. Canning, for the purpose of  
enabling me to accompany the delivery of it,  
with a communication, which 1 deemed im­  
portant, as well as of affording him an op­  
portunity of asking and receiving such ex­  
planations as he might desire. The inter- j  
view took place on the 26tii of August.  
It had occurred to me, that it would lie I  
proper, (and could not be injurious) to read  
to Mr. Canning, from your letter to me, of  
the 18th July, a brief summary of the instruc­  
tions under which I was acting. This had  
not been requested ; but it could not be un­  
acceptable ; and it was, besides, well c il­  
culatcd todo justice to the liberal sentiments  
by which my instructions had been dictated,  
as well as to give weight to my efforts in the  
execution of them.  
1 w.is led, by the reading of these passa­  
ges, (without having originally intended it)  
into a more extensive explanation, than 1  
had before attempted, of the influence which  
the proposal of my government would have,  
in truth, as well as in the judgment of the  
world,&quot; upon the supposed justice of their  
new system, as it affected the United States.  
To that explanation, with the particulars of  
which I will not, and, indeed, for want of  
time, cannot, at present, trouble you, I add  
a concise recapitulation of some ot&#x27;the pru­  
dential considerations, which had been so of­  
ten pressed belore, and tlieic 1 left the sub­  
ject.”

Loudon, Sefit ember 6. 1808.  
M You will perceive, that sometime had  
elapsed, after I hads-m off my dispatches  
by the Si. Michael, (the 8th of Angus.)  
before my note was p.csenud— The truth  
is, that i had employed a part of that time  
in framing a note of greut leng h, which,  
when nearly completed, I thought it pru­  
dent to abandon, in favor of one that held  
out fewer invitations to ivprofi.ablo discus­
