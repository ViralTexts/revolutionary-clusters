I am aware that the necessity of a few removals for legal, oppressions, delinquencies and other official malversations, may be misconstrued as done for political opinions, &amp; produce hesitation in the coalition so much to be desired; but the extent of these will be too limited to make permanent impressions. in the class of removals however I do not rank the new appointments which mr A. crouded in with whip &amp; spur from the 12th. of Dec. when the event of the election was known, (and consequently that he was making appointments, not for himself, but his successor) until 9. aclock of the night, at 12. aclock of which he was to go out of office. this outrage on decency, shall not have it’s affect, except in the life appointments which are irremoveable. but as to the others I consider the nominations as nullities &amp; will not view the persons appointed as even candidates for their office, much less as possessing it by any title meriting respect.
