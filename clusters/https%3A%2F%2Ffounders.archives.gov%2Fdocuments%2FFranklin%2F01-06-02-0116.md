[November 25, 1755]  
An ACT for the better Ordering and Regulating such as are willing and desirous to be united for Military Purposes within this Province.  
Whereas this Province was first settled by (and a Majority of the Assemblies have ever since been) of the People called Quakers, who, though they do not, as the World is now circumstanced, condemn the Use of Arms in others, yet are principled against bearing Arms themselves; and to make any Law to compel them thereto against their Consciences, would not only be to violate a Fundamental in our Constitution, and be a direct Breach of our Charter of Privileges, but would also in Effect be to commence Persecution against all that Part of the Inhabitants of the Province: And for them by any Law to compel others to bear Arms, and exempt themselves, would be inconsistent and partial. Yet forasmuch as by the general Toleration and Equity of our Laws, great Numbers of People of other religious Denominations are come among us, who are under no such Restraint, some of whom have been disciplined in the Art of War, and conscientiously think it their Duty to fight in Defence of their Country, their Wives, their Families and Estates, and such have an equal Right to Liberty of Conscience with others. And whereas a great Number of Petitions from the several Counties of this Province have been presented to this House, setting forth, That the Petitioners are very willing to defend themselves and their Country, and desirous of being formed into regular Bodies for that Purpose, instructed and disciplined under proper Officers, with suitable and legal Authority; representing withal, that unless Measures of this Kind are taken, so as to unite them together, subject them to due Command, and thereby give them Confidence in each other, they cannot assemble to oppose the Enemy, without the utmost Danger of exposing themselves to Confusion and Destruction. And whereas the voluntary Assembling of great Bodies of armed Men, from different Parts of the Province, on any occasional Alarm, whether true or false, as of late hath happened, without Call or Authority from the Government, and without due Order and Direction among themselves, may be attended with Danger to our neighbouring Indian Friends and Allies, as well as to the internal Peace of the Province. And whereas the Governor hath frequently recommended it to the Assembly, that in preparing and passing a Law for such Purposes, they should have a due Regard to scrupulous and tender Consciences, which cannot be done where compulsive Means are used to force Men into Military Service; therefore as we represent all the People of the Province, and are composed of Members of different religious Persuasions, we do not think it reasonable that any should, through a Want of legal Powers, be in the least restrained from doing what they judge it their Duty to do for their own Security and the Publick Good; we, in Compliance with the said Petitions and Recommendations, do offer it to the Governor to be enacted, AND BE IT ENACTED by the Honourable Robert Hunter Morris, Esq; with the King’s Royal Approbation, Lieutenant-Governor, under the Honourable Thomas Penn, and Richard Penn, Esquires, true and absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, and of the Counties of New-Castle, Kent and Sussex, upon Delaware, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Representatives of the Freemen of the said Province in General Assembly met, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the Publication of this Act, it shall and may be lawful for the Freemen of this Province to form themselves into Companies, as heretofore they have used in Time of War without Law, and for each Company, by Majority of Votes, in the Way of Ballot, to chuse its own Officers, to wit, a Captain, Lieutenant and Ensign, and present them to the Governor or Commander in Chief for the Time being for his Approbation; which Officers so chosen, if approved and commissioned by him, shall be the Captain, Lieutenant and Ensign of each Company respectively, according to their Commissions, and the said Companies being divided into Regiments by the Governor or Commander in Chief, it shall and may be lawful for the Officers so chosen and commissioned for the several Companies of each Regiment to meet together, and, by Majority of Votes, in the Way of Ballot, to chuse a Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel and Major, for the Regiment, and present them to the Governor or Commander in Chief for his Approbation; which Officers so chosen, if approved and commissioned by him, shall be the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel and Major of the Regiment, according to their Commissions, during the Continuance of this Act. Provided Always, That if the Governor or Commander in Chief shall not think fit to grant his Commission to any Officer so first chosen and presented, it shall and may be lawful for the Electors of such Officer to chuse two other Persons in his Stead, and present them to the Governor or Commander in Chief,

 aforesaid, That as soon as the said Companies and Regiments are formed, and their Officers commissioned, as aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful to and for the Governor, or Commander in Chief, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, and Majors of all the Regiments, being for that Purpose by him called and convened, or by and with the Advice and Consent of a Majority of the said Officers that shall be met and present together on such Call, to form, make and establish Articles of War, for the better Government of the Forces that shall be under their Command, and for bringing Offenders against the same to Justice; and to erect and constitute Courts Martial, with Power to hear, try and determine any Crime or Offences by such Articles of War, and inflict Penalties by Sentence or Judgment of the same on those who shall be subject thereto, in any Place within this Province. Which Articles of War, when made as aforesaid, shall be printed and distributed to the Captains of the several Companies, and by them distinctly read to their respective Companies; and all and every Captain, Lieutenant, Ensign, or other Freeman, who shall, after at least three Days Consideration of the said Articles, voluntarily sign the same, in the Presence of some one Justice of the Peace, acknowledging his having perused or heard the same distinctly read, and that he has well considered thereof, and is willing to be bound and governed thereby, and promises Obedience thereto, and to his Officers accordingly, shall thenceforth be deemed well and duly bound to the Observance of the said Articles, and to the Duties thereby required, and subject to the Pains, Penalties, Punishments and Forfeitures that may therein be appointed for Disobedience and other Offences.  
Provided Always, That the Articles so to be made and established, shall contain nothing repugnant, but be as near as possible conformable to the military Laws of Great-Britain, and to the Articles of War made and established by his Majesty, in Pursuance of the last Act of Parliament for punishing Mutiny and Desertion; the different Circumstances of this Province compared with Great-Britain, and of a voluntary Militia of Freemen, compared with mercenary standing Troops, being duly weighed, and maturely considered.  
Provided also, That nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give any Power or Authority to the Governor or Commander in Chief, and the said Officers, to make any Articles or Rules that shall in the least affect those of the Inhabitants of the Province who are conscientiously scrupulous of bearing Arms, either in their Liberties, Persons or Estates; nor any other Persons of what Perswasion or Denomination soever, who have not first voluntarily and freely signed the said Articles, after due Consideration as aforesaid.  
Provided also, That no Youth, under the Age of Twenty-one Years, nor any bought Servant or indented Apprentice, shall be admitted to enroll himself, or be capable of being enrolled in the said Companies or Regiments, without the Consent of his or their Parents or Guardians, Masters

in our conftitution, and be a direét breach of our  
charter of privileges, but would alfo in effeét be  
to commence perfecution againft all that part of

pel others to bear arms,. and exempt themfelves,  
would be inconfiftent and partial: Yet, foraf-  
much as by the general toleration and equity of  
our laws, great numbeis of people of other reli-  
gious denominations are come among us, who are  
under no fuch reftraint, fome of whom have been  
@ifciplined in the art of war, and confcientioufly  
think it their duty to fight in defence of their  
country, their wives, their families, and eitates,  
and fuch have an equal right to liberty of con-  
{cience with others. And whereas a great number  
of petitions from the feveral counties of this pro-  
vince have been prefented to this houfe, fetting  
forth,. that the petitioners are very willing to de-  
fend themfelves and their country, and defirous  
of being formed into regular bodies for that pur-  
pofe, inftruéted and difciplined under preper offi-

fenting witha], that unlefs meafures of this kind  
are taken, fo as to unite them together, fubject  
them to due command, and thereby give them  
confidence in each other, they cannot affemble to  
oppofe the enemy, without the utmoft danger  
of expofing themfelves to confufion and deftruc-  
tion.  
  
And whereas the voluntary aflembling of great  
bodies of armed men from different parts of the  
province, on any occafional alarm, whether true  
or falie, as of Jate hath happened, without call  
©r authority from the government, and without  
ue order and direCtion athong themfelves, may bz  
attended with danger to our neighbouring Indian  
friends and allies, as well as to the internal peace  
of the province:  
  
And whereas the Governor hath frequently re-  
commended it to the Aijembly, that in preparing  
and paffing a law for fuch purpofes they fhou!d  
have a due regard to fcrupulows and tender con-  
fciences, which cannot be done where compulfive  
means are ufed to force men to military fervice ;  
therefore as we reprefent all the people of the  
province, and are compofed of members of dif-  
ferent seligious perfuafions, we do not think it  
reafonable that any fhould, through a wantof le-

with the faid petitions and recommendations, do  
offer it to the Governor to be enaéted, &amp;c.  
  
By this aét, which is to continue in. force till

An Aé&amp; for the better ordering and regulating  
fuch as are willing and defirous to be united foP  
military Purpofes within the Province of Pen-  
fylvania, paffed Nov. 25, 1755.  
  
HEREAS this province was firft  
  
fettled by (and a majority of the af-  
femblies have ever fince been of) the people  
called Quakers, who, though they do not, as  
the world is now circumftanced, condemn the  
ufe of arms in others, yet are principled againtt  
bearing arms them/felves; and to make any  
liw to compel them thereto, againit their  
  
confciences, would not be only to violate a  
  
fu damental in our conftitution, and be a  
  
direét breach of our charter of privileges,  
  
but would alfo in etfeét be to commence per-  
fecution againft all that part of the inhabi-  
tants of the province: and for them by any  
law to compel others to bear arms, and ex-  
empt themieltes, would be inconfiftent and  
  
partial. Yet forafmuch as by the general to-  
leration and equity of our laws, great numbers  
of people of cther religious denominations are  
come among us, who are under no fuch re-  
ftraint, fome of whom heve been difciplined  
in the art of war, and confciencicufly think it  
their duty to fight in ce‘ence of their country,  
their wives, their families, and eftates, and  
fuch have an equal right to liberty of confci-  
ence with others. And whereis agreat num-  
ber of petitions from the feveral counties of  
this prevince, have been prefented to this  
houfe, fetting forth, that the petitioners are  
very willing to defend themfelves and their  
  
B country, and defirous of being formed into re-  
  
gular bodies for that purpofe, inflruéted and  
difcip ined under proper officers, with fuitable  
and legal authority; reprefenting withal,  
that unlefs meafures of this kind are taken,  
fo asto unite them together, fubject tiem to  
dre command, and thereby give them conft-  
dence in each other, they cannot aflemble to  
  
C oppofe the enemy, without the utmo% Jan-  
  
ger of expofing themfelves to confufion and  
deftruétion,  
  
And whereas the voluntary afiembling of  
great bodies of armed men from different parts-  
of the province on any occafional alarm, whe- _  
ther true or falfe, as of late hath happend,  
without call or authority from the govern-  
ment, and without due erder ani direction  
among themfelves, may be attended with dan-  
ger to our neighbouring Jid:an friends and al-  
lies, as well as to the internal peace of the pro-  
vince.  
  
And whereas the Governor hath frequently  
recommended it tothe Affembly, that in pre-  
paring and pafling a Law for {uch Purpoies,  
they fhould have a due regard to fc:upulous  
  
E and tender confciences, which cannot be done  
  
where compulfive means are ufed to force men  
into military fervice ; ‘therefore, as we repre-  
fent all. the people of the prevince, and are  
compofed -of members of different religious  
perfuafions, we do not think it reafonable that  
any fhould, through a want of legal powers,  
be in the leaft reitrained from doing what they  
judge it their duty to do for their own fecurity  
and the public good ; we in compliance with  
the faid petitions and reco nmendations, do  
offiz it to the governor te be enaéted, And be  
it enacted by the Hon. Robert Hunter Morris,  
Efq; with the king’s royal approb ition lieu-
