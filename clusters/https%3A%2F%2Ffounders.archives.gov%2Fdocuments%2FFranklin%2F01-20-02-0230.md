From a long and thorough consideration of the subject, I am indeed of opinion, that the parliament has no right to make any law whatever, binding on the colonies. That the king, and not the king, lords, and commons collectively, is their sovereign; and that the king with their respective parliaments, is their only legislator. I know your sentiments differ from mine on these subjects. You are a thorough government man, which I do not wonder at, nor do I aim at converting you.

stated therefore in out-of-the-way forms, as most likely to take the general attention. The first was called, Rules by which a great empire may be reduced to a small one; the second, An Edict of the king of Prussia. I sent you one of the first, but could not get enough of the second to spare you one, though my clerk went the next morning to the printer’s, and wherever they were sold. They were all gone but two. In my own mind I preferred the first, as a composition for the quantity and variety of the matter contained, and a kind of spirited ending of each paragraph. But I find that others here generally prefer the second. I am not suspected as the author, except by one or two friends; and have heard the latter spoken of in the highest terms as the keenest and severest piece that has appeared here a long time. Lord Mansfield I hear said of it, that it was very ABLE and very ARTFUL indeed; and would do mischief by giving here a bad impression of the measures of government; and in the colonies, by encouraging them in their contumacy. It is reprinted in the Chronicle, where you will see it, but stripped of all the capitalling and italicking, that intimate the allusions and mark the emphasis of written discourses, to bring them as near as possible to those spoken: printing such a piece all in one even small character, seems to me like repeating one of Whitfield’s Sermons in the monotony of a school-boy. What made it the more noticed here was, that people in reading it, were, as the phrase is, taken in, till they had got half through it, and imagined it a real edict, to which mistake I suppose the king of Prussia’s character must have contributed. I was down at lord Le Despencer’s when the post brought that day’s papers. Mr. Whitehead was there too (Paul Whitehead, the author of Manners) who runs early through all the papers, and tells the company what he finds remarkable. He had them in another room, and we were chatting in the breakfast parlour, when he came running in to us, out of breath, with the paper in his hand. Here! says he, here’s news for ye! Here’s the king of Prussia, claiming a right to this kingdom! All stared, and I as much as any body; and he went on to read it. When he had read two or three paragraphs, a gentleman present said, Damn his impudence, I dare say, we shall hear by next post that he is upon his march with one hundred thousand men to back this. Whitehead, who is very shrewd, soon after began to smoke it, and looking in my face said, I’ll be hanged if this is not some of your American jokes upon us. The reading went on, and ended with abundance of laughing, and a general verdict that it was a fair hit: and the piece was cut out of the paper and preserved in my lord’s collection.

to attract attention by its “ out-of-the-way ”  
form as “most likely to take the general  
attention,” and in this it was an entire suc-  
cess. It was printed in the “Public Adver-  
tiser,” and Franklin wrote a friend that he  
could not send him one, because “though my  
clerk went the next morning to the printer’s  
and wherever they were sold,” the edition of  
the paper had been exhausted. In conse-  
quence, the piece was reprinted by request  
in a subsequent issue, and was generally re-  
printed in other papers and in the magazines.

cozener told a correspondent, “except by  
one or two friends; and we have heard the  
latter spoken of in the highest terms, as the  
keenest and severest piece that has appeared  
here foralong time. Lord Mansfield, I hear,  
said of it, that it was very ABLE and very  
ARTFUL indeed ; and would do mischief by  
giving here a bad impression of the measures  
of government; and in the colonies, by en-  
couraging them in their contumacy. .. .  
What made it the more noticed here, was  
that people in reading it were, as the phrase  
is, taken in, till they had got half through it,  
and imagined it a real edict, to which mis-  
take I suppose the king of Prussia’s character  
must have contributed.” Of this he relate

an incident which must have delighted him:  
  
I was down at Lord le Despencer’s, when the  
post brought that day’s papers. Mr. Whitehead  
was there, too, (Paul Whitehead, the author of  
“Manners,”) who runs early through all the  
papers, and tells the company what he finds  
remarkable. He had them in another room, and  
we were chatting in the breakfast parlor, when  
he came running in to us out of breath, with the  
paper in hishand. “Here!” says he, “here ’s news  
for ye! Here ’s the king of Prussia claiming a  
right to this kingdom!” All stared, and I as much  
as anybody; and he went on to read it. When he  
had read two or three paragraphs, a gentleman  
present said: “Damn his impudence; I dare say  
we shall hear by next post, that he is upon his  
march with one hundred thousand men to back  
this.” Whitehead, who is very shrewd, soon after  
began to smoke it, and looking in my face, said,  
“T’ll be hanged if this is not some of your Ameri-  
can jokes upon us.” The reading went on, and  
ended with abundance of laughing, and a general  
verdict that it was a fair hit; and the piece was  
cut out of the paper and preserved in my Lord’s  
collection.
