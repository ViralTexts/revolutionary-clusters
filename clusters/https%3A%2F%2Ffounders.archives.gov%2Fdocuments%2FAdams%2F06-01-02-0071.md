To the Hon.james otis, andthomas cushing, Esq’rs; Mr.samuel adams, andjohn hancock, Esqr.;  
gentlemen,  
  
After the repeal of the late American Stamp Act, we were happy in the pleasing prospect of a restoration of that tranquility and unanimity among ourselves, and that harmony and affection between our parent country and us, which had generally subsisted before that detestable Act. But with the utmost grief and concern, we find that we flatter’d ourselves too soon, and that the root of bitterness is yet alive.—The principle on which that Act was founded continues in full force, and a revenue is still demanded from America.  
We have the mortification to observe one Act of Parliament after another passed for the express purpose of raising a revenue from us; to see our money continually collecting from us without our consent, by an authority in the constitution of which we have no share, and over which we have no kind of influence or controul; to see the little circulating cash that remained among us for the support of our trade, from time to time transmitted to a distant country, never to return, or what in our estimation is worse, if possible, appropriated to the maintenance of swarms of Officers and Pensioners in idleness and luxury, whose example has a tendency to corrupt our morals, and whose arbitrary dispositions will trample on our rights.  
Under all these misfortunes and afflictions, however, it is our fixed resolution to maintain our loyalty and duty to our most gracious Sovereign, a reverence and due subordination to the British Parliament as the supreme legislative in all cases of necessity, for the preservation of the whole empire, and our cordial and sincere affection for our parent country; and to use our utmost endeavours for the preservation of peace and order among ourselves: Waiting with anxious expectation, for a favorable answer to the petitions and sollicitations of this continent, for relief. At the same time, it is our unalterable resolution, at all times, to assert and vindicate our dear and invaluable rights and liberties, at the utmost hazard of our lives and fortunes; and we have a full and rational confidence that no designs formed against them will ever prosper.  
That such designs have been formed and are still in being, we have reason to apprehend. A multitude of Place men and Pensioners, and an enormous train of Underlings and Dependants, all novel in this country, we have seen already: Their imperious tempers, their rash inconsiderate and weak behaviour, are well known.  
In this situation of affairs, several armed vessels, and among the rest, his Majesty’s ship of war the Romney, have appeared in our harbour; and the last, as we believe, by the express application of the Board of Commissioners, with design to overawe and terrify the inhabitants of this town into base compliances and unlimitted submission, has been anchored within a cable’s length of the wharves.  
But passing over other irregularities, we are assured, that the last alarming act of that ship, viz. the violent, and in our opinion illegal seizure of a vessel lying at a wharf, the cutting of her fasts and removing her with an armed force in hostile manner, under the protection of the King’s ship, without any probable cause of seizure that we know of, or indeed any cause that has yet been made known; no libel or prosecution whatever having yet been instituted against her, was by the express order, or request in writing of the Board of Commissioners to the commander of that ship.  
In addition to all this, we are continually alarmed with rumours and reports of new revenue Acts to be passed, new importations of Officers and Pensioners to suck the life-blood of the body politick, while it is streaming from the veins: fresh arrival of ships of war to be a still severer restraint upon our trade; and the arrival of a military force to dragoon us into passive obedience: orders and requisitions transmitted to New-York, Halifax and to England, for regiments and troops to preserve the public peace.  
Under the distresses arising from this state of things, with the highest confidence in your integrity, abilities and fortitude, you will exert yourselves, Gentlemen, on this occasion, that nothing be left undone that may conduce to our relief; and in particular we recommend it to your consideration and discretion, in the first place, to endeavour that impresses of all kinds may if possible be prevented. There is an act of parliament in being, which has never been repealed, for the encouragement of the trade to America. We mean by the 6th Ann. Chap. xxxvii. Sect. 9. it is enacted, “That no mariner, or other person who shall serve on board, or be retained to serve on board, any privateer, or trading ship or vessel that shall be employed in any part of America, nor any mariner, or other person, being on shore in any part thereof, shall be liable to be impressed, or taken away by any officer or officers of or belonging to any of her Majesty’s ships of war, impowered by the lord high admiral, or any other person whatsoever, unless such mariner shall have before deserted from such ship of war belonging to her Majesty, at any time after the fourteenth day of February 1707, upon pain that any officer or officers so impressing or taken away, or causing to be impressed or taken away, any mariner or other person, contrary to the tenor and true meaning of this act, shall forfeit to the master, or owner or owners of any such ship or vessel, Twenty Pounds for every man he or they shall so impress or take, to be recovered with full costs of suit in any court within any part of her Majesty’s dominions.” So that any impresses of any mariner, from any vessel whatever, appears to be in direct violation of an act of parliament. In the next place, ’tis our desire that you inquire and use your endeavors to promote a parliamentary enquiry for the authors and propagators of such alarming rumours and reports as we have mentioned before; and whether the Commissioners or any other persons whatever have really wrote or solicited for troops to be sent here from New-York, Halifax, England or elsewhere, and for what end; and that you forward, if you think it expedient, in the House of Representatives, resolutions, that every such person who shall solicit or promote the importation of troops at this time, is an enemy to this town and province, and a disturber of the peace and good order of both

We have the mortification to observe one A&amp;

no kind of influence or controul ; to fee the lictle  
circulating cash that remained among us for the  
support of our trade, from time to time transmitted -  
to a distant country, never to return, or what in  
our estimation is worse, if possible, appropriated to  
the maintenance of {warms of Officers and Pen­  
sioners in idleness and luxury, whofs example has  
a tendency to corrupt our morals, and whose ar­  
bitrary dispositions will trample on our rights.  
Under all these misfortunes and afftictions, how­  
ever, it is our fixed resolution to maintain our  
loyalty and duty to our most gracious Sovereign,  
a reverence and due subordination to the Britith

To the Hon. James Otis, and  
&#x27;Thomas Cuffiing^ Ekjrs; Mf  
Samuel Adams, and John Ha^  
cock, F.rq ;  
  
Gentlemen,  
  
Fter the repeal of the latfe A»  
merican Stamp .A^, we were  
happy in the pleafing pfofjHr^ft of  
a redoiaiion of that tranquility  
and unanimity among ourlelves^  
and that haj-mony and affedtion  
betv.&#x27;ecn our parent country and  
us, which had generally lubGffed  
before that deteilable aft. But,  
with the utniolt grief and concern^  
we lindjthat we flattered out (elves  
too foon, and that the root bf  
bitteriielS is yet alive —Thd  
piintiple on which that aiH WaS  
founded continues in full forcCj^  
and a revenue is Hill demanded  
from America.  
  
We have the mortification td  
obferve one aft of parliament af¬  
ter another paffed for the exprefi &#x27;  
porpofe of railing a revenue tront  
uS*. to fee our money continually  
col left ing from us w ithout ou#

lee the little cifculatihp caffi that  
remained among us for the lup-

pcnfioncrs in idtenefs and luxury,  
whole exaiTiidc has a tendency to  
corrupt our morals, and whofe  
arbitrary dirpofitiou will trample  
on our rights.  
  
Under all thefe misfortunes and  
afflictions, however, it U our fixed  
refoluiion to maintain our loyalty  
and duty to our mod gracious So¬  
vereign, a reverence and due fub-  
ordinition to the Britiffl Parlia¬  
ment as the fupreme legiflative in  
all cales of neccllity, for the pre-  
fervation of the whole empire,  
and for our fincere and cordial  
alfeclioii for our parent country,  
and to ule our utmoft endeavours  
to preferve peace and order among  
ouri&#x27;elves, waiting with anxious  
e\pc(dation for a favourable anf-  
wer to the petitions and folicita-  
tioiis of this*continent for relief.  
At the fame time, it is our unal¬  
terable refolution, at all times,  
to afL^t and vindicate our dear  
and invaluable liberties, at the  
iitmod hazard of uur lives and  
fortunes, and we have a full and  
rational confidence that no defigns  
formed againd them will ever  
profper.  
  
That fuch defigns have been  
formed, and are dill in being,  
wc have reafon to apprehend. A  
multitude of placemen and pen-  
lioners, and an enormous train of  
underlings and dependants, all  
novel in this country, we have  
feen already. Their imperious  
tempers, their raOi, inconfiderate,  
and weak behaviour^ are well  
known.&#x27;  
  
In this fituation of affairs, fe«  
reral armed vefTcU, and among  
the red, his Majedy’s fhip of war  
the Kornney, have appeared in  
our harbour, and the lad, as we  
believe, by the exprefs application  
of the Board of Commidioners,

with defign to over-awe&#x27;and ter.  
rify the inhabitants of this town  
into bale compliances, and unli*  
mited fubmillion, has been an¬  
chored within a cable’s length of  
the wharfs.  
  
But palUng over other irregula¬  
rities, we are alTured, that’th#  
lad alarming a&lt;d of that fhip, viz.  
the violent, and, in our opinion^  
illegal feizure of a velTel lying at  
a wharf, and cutting of her  
fads, and removing her with an,  
anned force in a hodile manner,  
udder the prote(dion of the King’s  
fhip, without any probable caul*  
of feizure that we know of, or  
indeed any caule that hat yet been  
made known, no libel or profe*  
cution whatever having yet beea  
indituted againd her, was, by th»  
exprefs order, or reejued in wri¬  
ting of the Board of Commiilion*  
ers to the Commander of that fhip..  
  
In addition to all this, we are  
continually alarmed with rumours  
and reports of new revenue-a^s  
to be pafTed, oew iin^ ortations o£  
officers and penfinners, to fuck tb#  
life-blood of the body-politic  
while it is dreaming from the  
veins ; frefh arrivals of /hips of  
war^ to be a dill feverer refiraint  
upon our trade, and the arrival  
of a military force, to dragooa  
us into paillve obedience : orders  
and requifitlons tranfmitted to  
New-York, Halifax, and to Eng¬  
land, for regiments and troops  
to preferve the public peace.  
  
U nder the diftreiTes arifing from  
this date of things, with the  
highed Confidence in your inte*  
grity, abilities, and fortitude,  
&#x27; you wHl exert yourfelvet, gentle¬
