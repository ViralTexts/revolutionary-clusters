Taylor of Prince George expressive of sentiments similar to those which have been declared by other legislatures of the union on our controversy with France, in the place of which was substituted by a majority of twenty nine a counter proposition termed an amendment which was offered by Colo. Nicholas of Albermarle and which seems calculated to evince to France and to the world, that Virginia is very far from harmonizing with the American government or her sister States.  
The debates on these subjects were long and animated. In the course of them Sentiments were declared and (in my judgment) views were developed of a very serious and alarming extent.

dangerous experiments rather than permit that happiness to be enjoyed which is dispensed by other hands than their own. It is more than ever essential to make great exertions at the next election, and I am persuaded that by making we obtain a legislature, if not federal, so divided as to be moderate.  
I am by no means certain who will be elected for this district. Whatever the issue of the election may be, I shall neither reproach myself nor those at whose instance I have become a candidate, for the step I have taken⟨.⟩ I feel with increased force the obligation of duty to make sacrifices and exertions for the preservation of American Union and independence, as I am more convinced of the reality of the danger which threatens them. The exertions made against me by particular characters throughout this State and even from other states have an activity and a malignity which no personal considerations would excite. If I fail I shall regret the failure more on account of the evidence it will afford of the prevalence of a temper hostile to our government and indiscriminately so to all who will not join in that hostility, than of the personal mortification which would be sustained.

letter of Judge Marshall to General Washington.   
It was written at a time when the Pederaliste And   
anti•Federallste were respectively vehemently eue­  
tatning or bitterly opposing the policy of President   
Adams toward the French (iovernment :   
January 8,1799.   
Gain Sin-: I thank yon for the obeirge of Judge   
Addison. It is certainly well written, and-I wish   
that it, as well as some other publmattons on the   
same subject, could he more generally aced. I be­  
lieve that no argument can moderate the leaders   
of the opposition, but it may be possible to make   
some impression on the mass of the people. For this   
purpose the charge-of Judge Addison seems well   
calculated.   
However I may regret the passage of one of the   
note complained of, I am firmly persuaded that the   
tempest has not been raised by them. Its cause   
lies much deeper, and is not easily, to be removed.   
had they never passed, other measures would have   
boon selected, which would have-been attatikai   
with equal virulence. edifteline Hi, that an   
not, operating on the press in soy manner affords to   
itsopposers arguMents Which so captivate,the   
public ear, &#x27;whieh so mislead the public mind, that   
the efforts of, reason to correct-false impressions   
win often fail of success.   
  
Two very interesting subjects have,  
during the   
present session, particularly engaged the attention   
of the Legislature. The first was a paper intro- ,   
dnoed by OW. TeytorLof Oaraline, and which jon   
must have Boon contenting resolutions which take   
advantage of /fie Irritation excited •by the alien   
and sedition laws to criminate the whole conduct   
of our Administration, end charge it with the de­  
sign of introducing monarchy ; the other was a   
proposition from Mr. George K. Taylor, of Prince   
George, expressive of sentiment similar to those   
which have been declared by other Legislatures   
of the Union on oar controversy with France, in   
the place of whioh was Babetitnted, by a majority   
of twenty-sine, a counter proposition termed en   
amendment, which was offered by 001 Nicholas,   
of Albemarle, and which &#x27;seems calculated to   
evince to Prance and to the world that Virginia is   
very far from harmonizing with the American   
government or her sister States. . &#x27;   
  
The debates on these eubjeotet wore long and ani­  
mated. In the course of them sentiments were de­  
clared and (in my judgment) views were developed   
of a very Berton! and alarming extent. To rne it   
seems that there are men who will hold power by   
any Means rather than not hold it, and who would   
prefer a dissolution of the. Union to the continuance   
of en Administration not of their own party. They   
will risk ell the ills which may result from - the   
moot dangerous experiments rather than permit   
that happiness to be enjoyed which is dispensed by   
other hands than their own. It le more than ever   
essential to make great exertions at the next aloe­  
tiont and I am persuaded that by making them we   
obtain a Legislature, if not Federal, eo divided as   
to be moderate.   
I feel with Increased farce the obligations or   
duty tomato eacrifices and exertions for the pre.   
aervation of American union and independence, ae   
I am more convinced of .the reality of the danger   
which threatens them.   
With the most respectful attachment, I remain,   
sir, your obedient, J. Manastaxi..

Dear Sir: I thank you for tbo charge

tho charge of Judge Addison seems well

However I may regret the passago of  
ono of the acts complained of, I am firm­  
ly persuaded that the tempest has not beer  
raised by them. Its causo lies much deep­  
er, and is not easily to be removed. Had  
they never passed other measures, would  
have been selected which would have been  
attacked with eaual virulence. The mis-  
fortune is, that an act operating on the  
press in any manner, affords to its oppos-  
era arguments wnicn so captivate the pub­  
lic ear, which so mislead the public mind,  
that the efforts of reason to correct false­  
impressions will often fail of success.  
Two very interesting subjects have,  
during the present session, particularly  
engaged thejittention of the Legislature.  
Tho first was a paper introduced by Col.  
Taylor, of Caroline, and which yon must  
have seen, containing resolutions which  
take advantage of the irritation excited  
by the alien and sedition laws to crimi­  
nate the whole conduct of our administra­  
tion, and charge it with tbe design of in­  
troducing monarchy; the other was a  
proposition from Mr. George K. Taylor,  
of Prince George, expressive of sentiments  
similar to those which have been declared­  
by other Legislatures of the Union on our  
controversy with Franco, in tho placo of  
which was substituted, by a majority of  
twenty-nine, a counter proposition termed  
an amendment, which was offered by Col.  
Nicholas, of Albemarle, and which seems  
calculated to evince to France and to the  
world that Virginia is very far from har- &quot;  
monizing with the American government  
or her sister states.  
The debates on theso subjects were long

timents were declared and (in my judg­  
ment) views were developed ofa very se­  
rious and alarming extent. To me it  
seems that there are men who would hold  
power ly any means rather than not hold .  
it, and who would prefer a dissolution of  
the Union than to the continuance of an  
administration not of their own party.  
They will risk all tho ills which may re­  
sult from the most dangerous experiments  
rather than permit that happiness to be-&#x27;  
enjoyed which is dispensed by other  
hands than their own. It is more than  
ever essential to make great exertions at  
the next election, and I am persuaded  
that by making them we obtain a Legis­  
lature, if not federal, so divided as to be-&#x27;  
moderate.  
I feel with increased force the obliga-.
