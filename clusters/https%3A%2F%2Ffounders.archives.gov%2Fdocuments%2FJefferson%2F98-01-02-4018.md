thren there shall fix on. it may be designated by the Governor as the 3d 4th Etc day after the rising of the legislature, which will give it certainty enough.You ask what sum would be desirable for the purchase of books &amp; apparatus? certainly the largest you can obtain. 40. or 50,000.D. would enable us to purchase the most essential books of text and reference for the schools, and such an apparatus for Mathematics, astronomy, &amp; Chemistry as may enable us to set out with tolerable competence, if we can, thro’ the banks or otherwise, anticipate the whole sum at once.I remark what you say on the subject of committing ourselves to any one for the Law-appointment. your caution is perfectly just. I hope, and am certain that this will be the standing law of discretion and duty with every member of our board in this and all cases. you know that we have all, from the beginning, considered the high qualifications of our professors as the only means by which we could give to our institution splendor and preeminence over all it’s sister-seminaries. the only question therefore we can ever ask ourselves,  as to any candidate, will be, Is he the most highly qualified? the College of Philadelphia has lost it’s character of primacy by indulging motives of favoritism and nepotism, and by conferring appointments as if the professorships were entrusted to them as provisions for their friends. and even that of Edinburg, you know, is also much lowered from the same cause.  we are next to observe that a man is not qualified for a Professor, knowing nothing but merely his own profession. he should be otherwise well educated as to the sciences generally; able to converse understandingly with the scientific men with whom he is associated, and to assist in the councils of the Faculty, on any subject of science on which they may have occasion to deliberate. without this he will incur their contempt, and bring disreputation on the institution. with respect to the professorship you mention, I scarcely know any of our judges personally. but I will name, for example, the late judge Roane, who, I believe, was generally admitted to be among the ablest of them. his knolege was confined to the Common law merely, which does not constitute one half the qualification of a really learned Lawyer, much less that of a Professor of  Law for an University. and as to any other branches of science, he must have stood mute in the presence of his literary associates, or of any learned strangers, or others visiting the University. would this constitute the splendid stand we propose to take?  the individual named in your letter is one of the best, and to me the dearest of living men. from the death of his father, my most cherished friend, leaving him an infant in the arms of my sister, I have ever looked on him as a son. yet these are considerations which can never enter into the question of his qualifications as a Professor of the University. Suppose all the chairs filled in similar degree. would that present the object which we have proposed to ourselves, and promised to the liberalities and expectations of our country? in the course of the trusts which I have exercised thro’ life, with powers of appointment, I can say with truth, and unspeakable comfort, that I never did appoint a relation to office, and that merely because I never saw the case in which some one did not offer, or occur, better qualified; and I have the most unlimited confidence that, in the appointment of Professors to our nursling institution, every individual of my associates will look with a single eye to the sublimation of it’s character, and adopt as our sacred motto ‘detur digniori .’ in this way it will honor us and bless our country.I percieve that I have permitted my reflections to run into ge

our Board in this and all cases. You  
know we have all from the beginning  
considered the high qualifications of  
our professors as the only means by  
which we could give to our institution  
plendor and preeminence over all sise  
ter seminaries. The only question,  
therefore, we can ever ask ou  
to any candidate will be, Is he the  
most highly qualified? The college of  
Philadelphia has lost its character of  
primacy by indulging motives of favor-  
itism and nepotism, and by conferring  
the appointments as if the professor.  
ships were entrusted to them as provie  
sions for their friends. And even that  
of Edinbugh, you know, is also much  
lowered from the same cause. We are  
next to observe that a man is not  
qualified for a professor knowing  
nothing but merely his own profession.  
He should be otherwise well educated  
as to the sciences generally; able to  
converse understandingly with the si  
entific men with whom he is associated,  
and assist in the councils of the faculty  
on any subject of science on which  
they may have occasion to deliberate.  
Without this he will incur their con  
tempt and bring disreputation; on the  
institution. With respect to the proe  
fessorship you mention, I scarcely  
know any of our judges personally,  
but I will name, for example, the late  
Judge Roane, who, I believe, was gen-  
erally admitted to be among the a  
of them. His knowledge was confined  
to the common law chiefly, which does  
not constitute one half of the quali-  
fication of a really learned lawyer,  
much less that of a professor of law  
for a university. As to any other  
branches of science, he must have  
stood mute in the presence of his lit-  
erary associates, or of any learned  
strangers or others visiting the Uni­  
versity. Would this constitute the  
splendid stand we propose to take?  
&quot;In the course of the trusts I have  
exercised through life with powers of  
appointment, I can say with truth, and  
with unspeakable comfort, that I never  
did appoint a relation to office, and that  
merely because I never saw the case in  
which some one did not offer or occur  
better qualified; and I have the most  
unlimited confidence that in the ap-  
pointment of professors in our nursling  
institution every individual of my asso-  
ciates will look with a single eye to the  
sublimation of its character, and adopt  
as our sacred motto &#x27;detur digniori.&quot;  
In this way it will honor us and bless  
our country.&quot;  
At the risk of being somewhat  
tedious, I have copied from Mr. Jeffer.­

Although the request that no commitment should be made,  
might at first blush indicate a suspicion that Mr. Jefferson  
had some one else in his mind, I do not think that such a  
suspicion existed, for all of the board regarded Mr. Jefferson  
as the father of the University, and their own votes as merely  
marks of honorable confidence in him. I can discover no  
trace of any self-seeking spirit, certainly not in Cabell or  
Cocke.?  
  
To this letter of Mr. Cabell’s, Jefferson made the following  
answer :  
  
MonTIceLLo, February 23, 1824.  
** *  
  
I remark what you say on the subject of committing our-  
selves to any one for the Law appointment. Your caution is  
perfectly just. I hope, and am certain, that this will be the  
standing law of discretion and duty with every member of  
our Board in this and all cases. You know that we have all,  
from the beginning, considered the high qualifications of our  
professors as the only means by which we could give to our  
institution splendor and pre-eminence over all its sister semi-  
naries. The only question, therefore, we can ever ask our-  
selves, as to any candidate, will be, is he the most highly  
qualified? The College of has lost its character of  
primacy by indulging motives of favoritism and nepotism,  
and by conferring appointments as if the professorships were  
intrusted to them as provisions for their friends. And even  
that of Edinburgh, you know, is also much lowered from the

in the presence of his literary associates, or of any learned  
strangers or others visiting the University. Would this con-  
stitute the splendid stand we propose to take?&#x27;  
  
The individual named in your letter is one of the best, and  
to me the dearest of living men. From the death of his  
father, my most cherished friend, leaving him an infant in  
the arms of my sister, I have ever looked on him as a son.  
Yet these are considerations which can never enter into the  
question of his qualifications as a Professor of the University.  
Suppose all the chairs filled in similar degree, would that  
present the object which we have proposed to ourselves, and  
promised to the liberalities and expectations of our country ?  
In the course of the trusts which I have exercised through  
life, with powers of appointment, I can say with truth, and  
unspeakable comfort, that I never did appoint a relation to  
office, and that merely because I never saw the case in which
