 of that Honorable Body I will not undertake to say, but I think I may venture to assure your Excellency that your generous interposition  
had no small degree of Weight in procuring that decision in favor of Capt. Asgill, which he had no right to expect from the very unsatisfactory measures which had been taken by the British Commander in Cheif to attone for a crime of the blackest dye—not to be justified by the  
practices of War and unknown at this day amongst civilized Nations. I however flatter myself that our enemies have been brought to view that transaction in its true light and that we shall not experience a repetition of the like enormity.

I have no right to assume any particular merit from the lenient manner in which this disagreeable affair has terminated—But I beg you to believe, Sir, that I most sincerely rejoice, not only because your humane intentions are gratified, but because the  
event accords with the wishes of his Most Christian Majesty and his Royal and Amiable Consort who by their benevolence and Munificence have endeared themselves to every true American. I have the Honor to be with most
