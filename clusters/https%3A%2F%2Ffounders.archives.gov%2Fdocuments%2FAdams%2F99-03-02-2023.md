Letter 1.  
N. 4.  
My dear Son.  
St: Petersburg 1. &amp; 8. September 1811.  
  
In your letter of 18. January to your Mama, you mentioned that you read to your Aunt Cranch a Chapter in the Bible, or a Section of Dr: Doddridge’s annotations every Evening—This information gave me great pleasure, for so great is my veneration for the Bible, and so strong my belief that when duly read and meditated upon, it is of all the books in the world that which contributes most to make men good, wise, and happy, that the earlier my children begin to read it, and the more steadily they pursue the practice of reading it throughout their lives, the more lively and confident will be my hopes, that they will prove useful Citizens to their Country, respectable members of Society, and a real blessing to their Parents.  
But I hope that you have now arrived at an age to understand that reading, even of the Bible, is a thing in itself neither good nor bad, but that all the good that can be drawn from it, is by the use and improvement of what you have read, with the help of your own reflections—Young people sometimes boast of how many books and how much they have read; when instead of boasting they ought to be ashamed of having wasted so much time to so little profit—I advise you my Son, in whatsoever you read, and most of all in reading the Bible to remember that it is for the purpose of making you wiser and more virtuous.  
I have myself for many years made it a practice to read through the Bible once every year—I have always endeavoured to read it with the same Spirit and temper of mind which I now recommend to you—That is with the intention and desire that it may contribute to my advancement in Wisdom and Virtue.—My desire is indeed very imperfectly successful, for like you, and like the Apostle Paul, I find a law in my members warring against the law of my mind—But as I know that it is my Nature to be imperfect, so I know it is my duty to aim at perfection—and feeling and deploring my own frailties, I can only pray Almighty God, for the aid of his Spirit to strengthen my good desires, and to subdue my propensities to evil—For it is from him that every good and every perfect gift descends.  
My custom is, to read four or five Chapters of the Bible, every morning immediately after rising from bed. It employs about an hour of my time, and seems to me the most suitable manner of beginning the day. But as other cares, duties and occupations engage the remainder of it, I have perhaps never devoted a sufficient portion of my hours to meditation upon what I have thus read—Even meditation itself is often fruitless, unless it has some special object in view—Useful thoughts arise in the mind, and pass away without being remembered or ever applied to any useful good purpose.—Like seed scattered upon the surface of the ground, which the birds devour; or the wind blows away, or which rots without taking root, however good the soil may be upon which it is cast.  
We are all, my dear George, unwilling to confess our own infirmities, even to ourselves; and when our own Consciences are too honest to conceal them from us, our self love is always busy either in attempting to disguise them to us under false and delusive Colours, or in seeking out excuses and apologies, to reconcile them to our own minds.—Thus, although I am always sensible that I have not derived from my assiduous perusal of the Bible, (and I might apply the same remark to almost every thing else that I do) all the benefit that I might and ought, I am as constantly endeavouring to persuade myself that it is not my own fault—Sometimes I say to myself, I do not understand what I have read—I cannot help it—I did not make my own understanding—There are many things in the Bible, hard to be understood, as St: Peter expressly says of Paul’s Epistles—Some are hard in the Hebrew and Greek, the original Languages in which the Scriptures were written—Some are harder still in the translations. I have been obliged to lead a wandering life, about the world, and scarcely ever have at hand the books which might help me to surmount the difficulties—Conscience sometimes asks the question, whether my not understanding many passages is not owing to my want of attention in reading them—I must admit that it is; a full proof of which is that every time I read the book through, I do understand some passages which I never understood before, and which I should have understood at a former reading had it been effected with a sufficient degree of attention—Then in answer to myself I say, it is true—But I cannot always command at all my own attention; and never can to the degree that I should wish—My mind is oftentimes so full of other things—absorbed in bodily pain, or engrossed by Passions, or distracted by Pleasures, or exhausted by Dissipation that I cannot give to my proper daily employment the attention that I gladly would, and that is absolutely necessary to make it “fruitful of good works.” This acknowledgment of my weakness is just—But for how much of it I am still accountable to myself and to God, I hardly dare acknowledge to myself—Is it bodily pain?—how often was that brought upon me by my own imprudence and folly?—Was it Passion—Heaven has given to every human being the power of controuling his Passions, and if he neglects or loses it, the fault is his own and he must be answerable for it.—Was it Pleasure? What did I indulge it?—Was it Dissipation? This is the most inexcusable of all, for it must have been occasioned by my own thoughtlessness or irresolution—  
It is of no use to discover our own faults and infirmities, unless the discovery prompts us to amendment—I have thought, that if in addition to the daily hour which I give to the reading of the Bible, I should also from time to time and especially on Sundays, apply another occasional hour to communicate to you the reflections which arise in my mind upon its perusal, it might not only tend to fix and promote my own attention to the excellent Instructions of that Book, but perhaps also your advancement in its knowledge and Wisdom—At your age it is probable that you have still greater difficulties to understand all that you read in the Bible, than I have at mine, and if you have as much self-observation as your letters shew, you will be sensible of as much want of attention both voluntary and involuntary as I have acknowledged in myself—I intend therefore, for the purpose of contributing to your improvement and my own, to write you several letters, in due time to follow this, and in which I shall endeavour to shew you, how you may derive the most advantage to yourself, from the perusal of the Scriptures—It is probable that when you receive the letters, you will not on first reading them entirely understand them—If that should be the case, ask your Grandparents, or your Uncle or Aunt to explain them to you, and if you still find them too hard, put them upon file and lay them by two or three years, after which read them again and you will find them easy enough.  
It is essential, my Son, in order that you may go through this life with comfort to yourself, and usefulness to your fellow-creatures, that you should form and adopt certain rules or principles for the Government of your own conduct, and temper—Unless you have such rules and principles there will be numberless occasions on which you will have no guide for your Government but your Passions—In your infancy and youth you have been and will be for some years under the authority and controul of your friends and Instructors, but you must soon come to the age when you must govern yourself—You have already come to that age in many respects—You know the difference between right and wrong—You know some of your duties, and the obligation you are under of becoming acquainted with them all.—It is in the Bible that you must learn them, and from the Bible how to practice them.  
Those duties—are to God—to your fellow creatures,—and to yourself.—“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.” Luke X. 27. Matt. XXII. 40 “On these two Commandments (Jesus Christ expressly says) hang all the Law and the Prophets.”—That is to say that the whole purpose of divine revelation is to inculcate them efficaciously upon the minds of men.  
You will perceive that I have spoken of duties to yourself, distinct from those to God and to your fellow-creatures—while Jesus Christ speaks only of two Commandments—The reason is, because Christ, and the Commandment repeated by him consider self-love as so implanted in the heart of every man, by the law of his Nature, that it required no other Commandment to establish its influence over the heart. And so great do they know its power to be that they demand no other measure for the love of our neighbour than that which they know we shall have for ourselves—But from the Love of God, and the Love of our neighbour result duties to ourselves as well as to them, and they are all to be learnt in equal perfection by searching the Scriptures.  
Let us then search the Scriptures—And in order to pursue our inqueries with methodical order, let us consider the various sources of Instruction that we may draw from in this study—The Bible contains the Revelation of the Will of God—it contains the History of the Creation of the World and of mankind—and afterwards the history of one peculiar Nation—certainly the most extraordinary Nation that has ever appeared upon Earth—It contains a system of Religion and of Morality, which we may examine upon its own merits, independent of the sanction it receives from being the Word of God; and it contains a numerous collection of Books, written at different ages of the world by different authors, which we may survey as curious monuments of antiquity, and as literary compositions—In what light soever we regard it—whether with reference to Revelation—to History, to Morality or to Literature, it is an invaluable and inexhaustible mine of knowledge and virtue.  
I shall number separately those letters that I mean to write you on the subject of the Bible.—And as after they are finished I shall perhaps ask you to read them all together, or to look over them again myself, you must keep them on a separate file. I wish that hereafter they may be useful to your brothers and sister as well as to you—As you will receive every one of them as a token of my affection for you during my absence, I pray that they may all be worthy of being read by them all with benefit to themselves, if it please God that they may live to be able to understand them.  
From your affectionate father.

strong is my veneration for the bible, so  
strong my belief that when daily read and  
meditated upon, it is, of all books io the  
world, that which coatributes must to make  
men good, wise and happy; that the earlier

son, in whatsoever you read, and most of alfin  
reading the bible, to remember, that it is for  
the purpose of making you wiser and more  
virtuous. I have, for myself, for many years,  
made it a practice to read through the bible  
once every year; | have always endeavoured  
to read it with the same spirit and temper of  
mind whichI now recommend to you; that  
is, with the intention and desire that it might  
contribute to my advancement in wisdom and  
virtue ; my desire is indeed very imperfectly  
successful ; for,.like you andthe apostle Paul,  
I find a law in my members warring against  
tie law of my mind. But as! know itis my  
nature to be imperfect, so 1 knowit is my du-

mighty God for the aid of bis spirit to  
strengthen my good desires, and subdue my  
propensities to evil, for it is from him that  
| every good and perfect gift descendeth. My  
custom is, to read tour or five chapters of the

Extracts from Letters of J. Q. Adams to his son, written  
while he was Minister of the United States in Russia.  
  
In your letter of the 10th of January to your moth-  
er, you mention that you read to your aunt a chap-  
ter in the Bible or a section from Dr. Doddridge,  
every day. This information gave me great pleas-  
ure ; for, so strong is my veneration for the Bible,  
so strong is my belief that, when daily read and  
meditated upon, it is ofall books in the world that  
which contributes most to make men good, wise,  
and happy; that the earlier my children begin to  
read it, and the more steadily they pursue the prac-  
tice of reading it, throughout their lives, the more  
lively and confident will be my hopes that they will  
prove useful citizens to their country, respectable  
members of society, and a real blessing to their pa-  
rents.  
  
I advise you, my son, in whatsoever you read,  
and, most of all, in reading the Bible, to remember,  
that it is for the purpose of making you wiser and  
more virtuous. I have, for myself, for many years,  
made it a practice to read through the Bible once  
every year. I have always endeavored to read it  
with the same spiritual temper of mind that I now  
recommend it toyou ; that is, with the intention and  
desire that it might contribute to my advancement  
in wisdom and virtue. My desire is, indeed, very  
imperfectly successful ; for, like you and the apos-  
tle Paul, I find a law in my members warring against  
the lawofmy mind. But, as [know itis my nature  
to be imperfect, so I know it is my duty to aim at  
perfection ; and feeling and deploring my own  
trailties, [can only pray Almighty God for the aid  
of his Spirit, to strengthen my good desires, and sub-  
due my propensities to evil : for it is from him that  
every good and perfect gift descendeth.  
  
My custom is to read four or five chapters of the  
Bible every morning, immediately after rising from  
bed. Itemploys me about an hour ofmy time, and  
seems the most suitable manner of beginning the day

My DEArt Fns: In your letter of the

Meted that you read to -your amit a chapter   
in the Bible, or a section in Dialdlidl2,o,4 An_

contributes most to make.men good, wise,   
and happy—that the earlier my children be,   
ginno read Mlle: more steadily tbry pursue   
the practice of reading it throughout their

.my hope&#x27;s that they will ji-rove good and nee:

- tiers of society, and a real blessing to their.   
parents. lint I hope you have now [mired   
art an age. to tuiderstaud that mailing, even in   
the Bible, is as 1110* iii ifsell neither good   
nor bad; but that all the good -which can. be   
drawn foire . it is by thrrnse and improve­  
lIICIII Of what you have read, well the help   
of your own retlectiom • Young people   
sometimes boast of how many books and   
how much they have read; when, instead of   
rhoasting, they ought to. ho ashamed of ha­  
ving wasted so much time to so little profit.   
I advise you, lily son, in whatevdryOu read   
and most of all in reading the Bible, to re­  
member ilea it is lor the purpose of leaking   
you %visa and more vii mous. I have my­  
self lot many years made it a practice to   
read thiough die bible owe a year. I have   
a 1.% ay s endcavoied to read it with the same   
spirit and temper of -mind which I now rec­  
ce:helmet to you; th.it is. with the intention   
and desiie that it nay contribute to my ad­  
vancement in wisdom and virtue. lily the   
sire is indeed imperfectly successful; tor like   
yon, and I.ke the Apostle -Paul, &#x27;ilfied a law   
m my men hers, waning against the law of   
my rentl.&quot; But as I know that it is my na­  
ture to be impeilect, so I know that it is my   
duty to aim at liellectiati; and feeling and   
deploringmy-OWI/. hailties, I can only pray,   
Almighty God for rile aid of his Spirit to   
Weedier&#x27; thy good desires, and to,. subdue   
my propensities&#x27; to evil; for it is from Min   
that every good curd every perfect gilt de­  
scends. lily custom is to read lour or five   
chapters every morning, immediately alter   
rising from illy lied. it employs about an   
hour of my time, and seems to me the most   
suitable manner of beginning the day. But,   
as other cares,duties :aid occupations engage   
the t-entniirtler iil it, I have perhaps never a   
sufficient ;milieu of my time ill meditation   
upon what I have read. Even meditation   
&#x27;itself is alien flatness, unless it has some,   
special object -in .vtew; useful thoughts often   
arise in the wind; and pass away without   
tieing remembered or applied to any good   
pnrpose—like the seed •scattered neon the   
surface of ihe ground, which the turds devour   
or the winds blow away, or which rot with 7.   
out taking -root, however &#x27;good the soil may   
be upon which they are cast. We are all,.   
,my dear George, unwilling to emiless our   
°Wit faults, even to&#x27;outselves, and when our   
own consciences are too honest to conceal   
them Irmo us, our sell-love is always busy,   
;either in, attempting to disguise them to as­

THE JOURNAL.  
MK. ADAMS&#x27;S LETTERS ON THE EIBLE  
LETTER SO. 1.  
, . Sr. Petersbi-rg, Sept. 1811.  
Mr Deas Sox: In yo-ir letter of the 18th  
of January, to jour mother, jou mentioned  
that you real to your aunt a chapter in the Bi  
ble or a section ot Dodd ridge&#x27;s Auuotations ev­  
ery evening. This information gave rue real  
pleasure., for so great is my veneration for the  
llible, anJ sq strong rav belief that, wh. ncluty  
  
jead and meditated, it is of all books in the I  
world that which contributes most to make&#x27;  
men good, wise, and happy, that the earlier my  
children begin to read it, the more steadily  
they pursue ths practice of reading it throjgh­  
out their lives, the more livel and coufi.leni  
will be my hopes that they will prove useful  
citizens to their country, respectable members  
of society, and a real blessing to their parents.  
But 1 hope you have now arrived at an age to  
understand that reading, even in the Eibie, is  
a &#x27;-Ling in itself neither good nor bad, but thai  
all the good which can be drawn from it is by  
the use and improvement of w hat you have  
read, with thh help of your reflection.  
Young people sometimes boast of how many  
books and how much they have read; when, in  
stead of boasting they ought to b;? ashamed ot  
having wasted so much time in so little profit,  
bavins wasted so much time in so little profit.  
J advise you, my son. in whatever, you read,  
tnd most of all m reading the Bible, to remem­  
ber that it is for ;he purpose of niakiug you wi­  
ser and more virtuous. 1 have myself for manv  
vears made it a practice to read throu h the  
Bible once every year. I have always endeav  
ored to read it with the same spirit and temper  
of mind which I now recommend to you; that  
is, with the intention and desire that it- mav  
contribute to my advancement in wisdom and  
virtue. My desire is indeed very imperfectly  
successful; for, like you, and like the Apostle  
Paul, &quot;1 find a law in my members, warning  
against the laws of my mind.&quot; But as 1 know  
it is my nature to be imperfect, so 1 know that  
it is my duty to aim at perfection; and feeling  
and deploring my own frailties, 1 can only pray  
Almighty God tor the aid of his Spirit to  
strengthen my good desires, and to subdue my  
propensities to evil; for it is from Him that ey­  
ery good and every perf ct gift descends.  
My custom is to read four or five chapters  
every morning, immediately after rising from  
iny bed. It employs about an hour ot my lime  
and seems to trie the most suitable manner &#x27; of  
beginning the day. But as other cares, duties,  
and occupations engage the remainder of it, 1  
have perhaps nevera sufficient portion of my  
time in meditation upon what 1 have read.  
Even meditation itself is often fruitless, unless  
it has some special objects in view; useful  
thoughts often arise in the mind, and pass away  
without being remembered or applied to any  
good purpose like the seed scattered upon  
the surface of the ground, which the birds de­  
vour, or the wind blows away, or which rot  
without taking root, however good the soil may  
le upon which they are cast. .  
We are all, my dear George, unwilling to  
confess our own faults, even to ourselves, and  
when our own consciences arj too . honest to  
conceal them from us, our self-love is always  
busy. either in attempting to disguise them to  
us under false and delusive c.olprs, or in seek­  
ing out excuses and apologies to reconcile them  
to our minds. Thus, although I am sensible  
thatl have not derived from my assiduous per­  
usal of the Bible (and I might apply the same  
remark to almost every thing else than 1 do)  
all the benefit that I might and ought, I am as  
constantly endeavoring to persuade myself  
that it is not my own fault. Sometimes 1 say  
to myself, I do not understand what 1 have  
read; 1 cannot help it; ldkl not make my own  
understanding; there are many things in the Bi­  
ble &#x27;&quot;hard to understand,&quot; as St. Peter express­  
ly says of Paul&#x27;s Epistles, some are hard. in the  
Hebrew, and some in the Greek the original  
languages in which the Scriptures were writ­  
ten, some are harder still in the translations.  
I have been obliged to lead a wandering life  
about the world, and scarcely ever have at  
hand the books which might help me to sur­  
mount these difficulties.  
Conscience sometimes puts the question  
whether my not understanding many passages  
is not owing to my want of attention in read­  
ing them. I must admit that it is; a full proof  
of which is, that every time I read the book  
through I undersland some passages which 1  
never understood before, and which I should  
have done at a former reading had it been ef-  
fjc!el with a sufficient degree of attention.  
Then, in answer to myself, I say it is true;  
but Icanuot always command my own atten­  
tion, and never can to the degree that I wish.  
My mind is oft-times so full of other things,  
absorbed in bodily pain, or engrossed by pas­  
sion, or distracted by pleasure, ot exhausted by  
dissipation, that 1 cannot give to proper daily  
employment the attention which I gladly  
would, and which is absolutely necessary to  
make it &quot;fruitful of good works.&quot;  
This acknowledgement of my weakness is  
just; but for how much of it I am still account­  
able to God. I hardly dare to acknowledge to  
myself. Is it bodily pain? How often was that  
brought upon me bv own imprudence or folly!  
Was it passion? Heaven has given to every  
human being the power of controlling his pas­  
sions, and if he nt-glect3 or loses it, the fault is  
liis own, and he must Iv answerable it. Was it  
pleasure? Why did 1 indulge it? Was it dissi­  
pation? This is the moat inexcusable of all; for  
it must have been occasioned by my own  
thoughtlessness or irresolution. It is of no use  
to disco rer cur own faults and infirmities, un­  
less the discovery prompts us to amendment.  
I have thought it, in addition to the hour which  
I daily give to the reading of the Bible. I should  
also from time totime (and especially on the  
Sabbath) apply another hour to communicate  
to you the reflections that arise in my mind  
upon its perusal, it might not only tend to fix  
and promote my attention to the excellent in­  
structions of that sacred book, but perhaps also  
assist your advancement in its knowledge and  
wis. Ion.  
At your age it is probable that you still have  
greater difficulties to understand all that you  
read in the Bible than I have at mine; and it  
you have so much self-observation as your let­  
ters indicate, you will be sensible of as much  
want of attention, both voluntary -and invol­  
untary, as I here acknowledge in myself. I in­  
tend, therefore, for the purpose of contributing  
to your improvement and my own, to write  
you several letters, indue time to follow this,  
in which I shall endavor to show you h w you  
may derive the most advantage to yourself,  
from the Derusal of the Scriptures.  
It i3 possible, when you receive these letters;  
vou will not, at first reading, entirely under­  
stand them; if that should be the case, ask your  
grand-par?uts, or. your uncle or aunt, to cx  
plain th -in, if you still find them too hard, put  
them en file, and lay them by for two or three  
years, after which read them again, and vou  
will find them easy enough. It is essential,  
my son, in order that you may go through life  
with confort to yourself and usefulness to your  
fellow creatures, that you should form and  
adopt certain rules or principles for the gov­  
ernment of your own conduct and temper.  
Unless you have such rules and principles,  
there will be numberless occasions on which  
you will have no guide for your government  
&#x27;but your passio.is.  
In your infancy and youth you have been  
and will be, for so&#x27;:n years, under the authori­  
ty and control of your friends and instructors;  
but you must soon come to the age when you!  
oovern vourself. You have already come  
to that age in manv respects; vou know the dif­  
ference between right and wrong, and you  
knowsoiiw of your duties, and the obligations  
raa are uaier to twjoms acquainted with them  
  
all. ; It is in the Bible you must learn them,  
and from the Bible how to practice them  
Those duties are to God to yourfellow-creatures,  
arid to yourself. &quot;Thou shall love the  
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all  
thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with  
all thy strength, and thy neighbor as thyself.&quot;  
On these two commandments, Jesus Christ ex­  
pressly says, &#x27;-hang all the law and the proph­  
ets,&quot; that is to say, the whole purpose of Divine  
  
revelation is to inculcate them efficaciously  
upon the minds of men.  
You will perceive that I have spoken ofdu­  
ties to yourself, distinct from, those to God  
and to vour fellow-creatures; while Jesus  
Christ speaks only of two commandments.  
The reason is, because Christ and the command  
ments repeated by him consider self-love as so  
implanted in the heart of every man by the  
law of his nature, that it requires no command  
ment to establish Us influence over the heart;  
and so great do they know its power to be,  
that they demand no other measure for the  
love of our neighbor, than , that which they  
know we shall have for ourselves. But from  
the. Jove of God and the love of our neighbor  
risu&#x27;t duties to ourselves as well as to then),  
and itiey are all to be learned ia equal perfec­  
tion by our searching the Scriptures. - Let us,  
then, search the Scriptures; and in order to pur­  
sue our inquires with methodical order, let us  
consider the various sources of information  
that we may draw from in this study.  
The Bible contains the revelation of the will  
of God. It contains the history of the creation  
of the world and of mankind; and afterward the  
history of one peculiar nation, certainly the  
most extraordinary nation that has ever ap  
peared upon the earth. It contains a system of  
religion, and of morality, which we may ex­  
amine upon its own merits, independent of the  
sanction it receives from being the Word of  
God; and it contains a numerous collection of  
books, written at different ages of the world, by  
different aul .ors, which we may survey as cu­  
rious monuments ot antiquity snd as literary  
compositions. Jn what light so ever we re  
gard it, whether with reference to revelation,  
to literature, to history, or to morality it is  
an invaluable and inexhaustable miueol know­  
ledge and virtue.  
1 shall number separately those letters that I  
mean to write you upon the subject of the Bi  
ble, as, after they are finished, 1 shall perhaps  
ask you to read them altogether, or to look  
over them again myself, you must keep them  
on a separate file. I wish that hereafter they  
may be useful to your brothers, and sisters as  
to you. As you will receive them as a token  
of affection for you during my absence, I pray  
that they may be worthy to be read by them  
all with benefit to themselves, if it please God  
that they should live t be able to understand  
them. From vouraffe.ctioaa te father. ,

Ca ntff L the New York Tribona.  
v?; , LJETTER I.  
&#x27;&#x27; &quot;&#x27;&quot;V j &#x27; St. Pktkjukm, Sspt. 1811.  
&#x27; Mr Dbas 8aj; In your latter of the 18th  
. Jasuary, J01&quot; nlher, you mentioned  
&quot;-&#x27; iji voa read to your aunt a chapter in the  
jXfcfc, or action of Doddridge&#x27;s Aoaota­  
&#x27; lioaa Start evening. Thia information  
&#x27; Mft iM real pleasure; for to groat is my  
veneration (r lha Bbilc, and ao strong my j  
&#x27; belief that, when duly rend and meditated  
a, it ia of all books in tho world, that  
, which eontributea moat to mke men good,  
via and happy that the earlier my chil­  
dren orgin to road it. the more steadily  
lhv puraue the practice of reading it  
tfcrooghout their Uvea, the more lively and  
, confident will be my hope that they wilt  
prove useful citizen to their country, 10­  
. epectabfe members of society, an J a real  
, blessing to their parent. But I hopo you  
,bave now arrived at an age to understand  
that reading, oven in the Bible, is a thing  
via ileolf neither good nor bad, but that all  
the good which can bo drawn from it ia by  
, the use and improvement of what you have  
read, with the help of your own reflection.  
j; Young people so mo times boast of how  
fawny books and how much they have read;  
, when, iiiatead of Donating they ought to he  
. babamed of having wasted ao much time to  
BO little profit. 1 advise you-, my son, in  
whatever you rend, and most of all in roll  
ing tho Bible, that it is for tho purpose of  
baking you wisor and more virtuous.  
&#x27; &quot; 1 have myself for many years made it a  
&#x27; practice to read through tho Bible once  
very year. I have always attompted to  
&#x27;read it with the samo spirit and lorn per of  
laind&#x27; which I now recommend to you; that  
,ls, with the intention and dosiro that it may  
&#x27;contribute to my advancement in wisdom  
and virtue. My desire is Indeed very im­  
perfectly successful; for, liko you. and like  
tne Aposue i aui, &quot;i nnj a law in my  
members, warring agiinst the laws of my  
mind. Hut as 1 know that it is my ni  
.i ... . - . .  
lure to no unporioci, so i Know that it is  
my duty to aim at perfection; and fooling  
and deploring my own frailties, I can only  
E&quot;ray Almighty God for tho aid of his  
piril&#x27; to strengthen my good desires, and  
to subdue my propensities to evil; for it m  
front llim evory good r nd perfect gift  
descends. My custom is, to rend four or  
five chapters every morning, immediately  
htr rising from my bod. It omploys  
bout an hour of my timo, and seems to  
tno the most suitable manner of beginning  
the day. But, as other enres, duties and  
beenpatinns engnge the remnindor of it, I  
have perhaps no or a sufficient portion of my  
timo in meditation upon what I hnvo rend.  
I-Jven meditation itsolf is often fruitless,  
unlets it has some special ohjoct in view;  
useful thoughts often arisa in tho mind, nnd  
bats away without being remembered or  
applied to any good purprao like tho sood  
scattered upon the surface of the ground,  
which the birds devour, or tho wind blows  
away, or which rut without taking root.  
however good the soil may bo upon which  
they are cast.  
We are all, my dear George, unwilling  
to confess our own faults, even to oursolvos;  
snd when our own consciences are too  
honest to conceal them from us, our self­  
love is always busy, oither in attempting  
io disguise them to us under falso an I de­  
lusive colors, or in soaking out excuses and  
apologies to reconcile them to our minds.  
Thus, although I am sensible that I have  
hot derived from my assiduous perusal of  
the Bible, (nnd I might apply the same re­  
mark to almost everything elao that I do,)  
all the benefit thnt 1 might arid oiight, 1 nm  
as constantly endeavoring to persuadn my­  
self that it ia not rhy own fault. Some­  
times 1 eiy to myself, I do not understand  
what 1 have read; I cannot help it; I did  
nottnake my own understanding; there are  
.rnawy thintra in the Bible &quot;hard to under-  
staad.&quot;as St. Petor expressly says of Paul&#x27;s  
fcpistles; somo are hard in the Hebrew,  
and some in tho Greek tho original lan­  
guages in which the Scriptures were writ  
ten; somo are bardor still in the transla­  
tions. I havn been obliged to lead a wan­  
dering life about the world, arid scarcely ever  
have at hand the book which might help me  
to surmount thoso difficulties. Conscience  
sometimes puts thn question whether my  
not understanding many passages is not  
owing t my want of attention in reading  
them. I must admit that it is; a full proof  
or which is, that every timo I read the  
Book through I undorstand some passages  
which I never understood before, end  
which I should have done, at a former read­  
ing, had it been efTectd with a sufficient  
fbgree of attention. Thon. in answer to  
myself, I sav it is true; but I cannot  
always command my own attention, and  
hover can to the degree thnt ( wish.  
My mind is oft-times so full of other  
things, absorbed in bodily pain, or engross­  
ed by passion, or distracted by pleasure, or  
exhausted by dissipation, that I cannot give  
to proper daily empfoment ire attention  
which I gladly would, and which is abso­  
lutely necessary to make it &quot;fruitful of  
good works.&quot; This acknowledgment of  
m weakness is just; but for how much  
of it 1 am still accountable to God, I hard­  
ly dare acknowledge to myself. Is it  
bodily pain? How often was that brought  
upon me by my own imprudence or folly f  
Has it passion Heaven has given to  
every human being the power of controll­  
ing his passions, and if he neglects or lose  
It, the fault is his own. and he must be  
aaawerahte for it. VTaa it pleasure? Why  
did I iedu&#x27;ge it? Was it dissipation? This  
ia the most inexcusable of all; for it must  
have been occasioned by mv own thought  
lessness or irresolution. It is of no use to  
discover oar own fault and infirmities, un­  
let the discovery prompts us to amend­  
meat. 1 have thought if ia addition to the  
fhicn 1 dai,&#x27;r lo the &#x27;ding of  
,h Me hould also from time to time  
(and specially on the Sabbath) apply ano­  
ther hour occasionally to communicate to  
yea the reflection that aria ia my mind  
so ate parusal, it might not only tend to  
t ad promote nty own attention to the  
  
excellent instructions of that sacred Book,  
but perhaps also assist your advancement  
in its knowledge and wisdom.  
At your age, it is probable thnt you  
have atill greater difficulties to understand  
all that you read in tho Bible than I have  
at mine; and if you have so much self­  
observation as your letters indicate, you  
  
will be sensible of as much want of atten  
tion, both voluntary and invo&#x27;untary, as I  
ncknowlcdgo in myself. I intend, there­  
fore, for the purpose of contributing loyour  
improvement and my own, to writo you  
several letters, in duo timi to follow this.  
in which I shall endeavor to show you how  
vou miy derive tho most advantage to  
yourself, from the norusal of tho Scrip  
tures. It is probable, when vou receive  
those letters, you will not. at first reading,  
entirely understand them; if thnt should  
bo the case, ask your grand pironN, or  
your uncle or aunt, to explain them; if vou  
still And thorn too hard, put thorn on file.  
and lay thorn by for two or three- years.  
nftor which read thorn agnin. nnd you will  
find them easy enough. It is essential, mv  
son.-in order that you miy go&quot; through life  
with comfort to yourself nnd usefulness to  
your fellow creatures, that you should form  
nnd adopt certain rules or principles for  
the govnrnmont of your own conduct and  
troper. Unless you have such rules and  
principles, there will be numberless oc­  
casions on which you will hnvo no guide  
for your government but your pissions.  
In your infancy nnd youth, you hnvo  
boon, and will bo for some years, undor  
the authority and control of your friends  
nnd instructors; but you must soon com  
to the age whr-n you must govern yourself.  
You have already come to that ao in  
many respects; you know tho d fferonce  
between right nnd wrong, nnd you know  
some of your duties, nnd tho obligations  
you are under to become acquainted with  
them all. It is in the Bible you must learti  
them; and from tho Biblo how to practice  
them. Those duties nre to God, to vour  
fellow creatures, nnd to yourself. &quot;Thou  
slinlt lovo the Lord thy God, with nil thv  
henrt. and with all thy soul, and with all  
thy mind, and with all thy strength, and  
thy neighbor ns thyself.&quot; On these two  
commandments, Jesus Christ expressly  
says, &quot;hang all the Law nnd the Prophets;&quot;  
thnt is to say, tho whole purposo of Divine  
Kevolntion is to inculcate them efficacious­  
ly upon tho minds of mnn. You will por­  
criv that I hnvo spoken of duties to your­  
self, distinct from those to God nnd to your  
follow creatures; while Jesus Christ speaks  
only of two cornmnndments. The rea­  
son is, bocnuse Christ and the command­  
ments repeated by him, consider solf-lovo  
nsso implanted in thn honrt of every man  
,by&quot;tho law of his nature, thnt it requires  
no commandments to establish its influence  
ovor the heart; and so great do they know  
its power to be, thnt they demnnd no other  
measure for the love of our noighhor, than  
that which thoy know we shall hnve for  
ourselves. But from tho lovo of God. nnd  
the love of dUr neighbor result duties to  
ourselves as well ns to them, nnd they arp  
nil to be learned in equnl perfection by our  
senrching tho Scriptures.  
Lot us, then, search the scriptures; and  
in order to pursue our inquiries with me­  
thodical order, lot us consider the various  
sourcos of information that wo may draw  
from in this study. The Bible contains the  
Revelation of the Will of God. It con­  
tains tho history of the creation of tho  
world, and of mankind; and nfterwnrd the  
history of one peculiar nation, certainly  
the most extraordinary nation that has  
over appeared on tho earth. It contains a  
system of Religion and Morality, which  
we may examine upon its own merit, in­  
dependent of tho snnc;ion it receives from  
boing the Word of God; nnd it contains a  
numerous collection of books, written at  
different ages of the world, by different  
authors, which we may survey as curious  
monunierita of antiquity nnd ns literary  
compositions. In what light soever wo re  
gard it. Whether with reference to Revela­  
tion, to Literature, to llistory; or to Mor­  
alityit is an invaluable and inexhaustible  
mine of knowledge and virtuo.  
1 shall number separately those letters  
thnt I mean to write yod upon the subject  
of the Bible, and as, after they are finish­  
ed, I shall perhaps ask you to road them all  
together, or to look over thorn again my­  
self, you must keep them on separate file.  
I wish that hereafter they may be useful to

As you will receive them as a token of af­

It is true; butI cannot always command

an full of other things, absorhed in hodly  
pain, or engrossed by passion, or distracied  
by pleasure, or exhauisted by dissipation,  
that I cannat give to proper daily employ  
ment the attention which I gladly would,  
and which is absolutely necessary to make

knowledgment of my weakness is just; but  
for how much of it I am still accountable  
to God. I hardly dire acknowledge to  
myself. Is it bodily pain? How often was  
that brought upon me by my own impru­  
dence or folly? Was it passion? Heaven  
has given to every human being the pow­  
er of controlling his passions, and if he  
neglects or loses it, the fault is his own,  
and he must he answerable for it. Was  
dissinatent

ed by my own thoughtlessness or irreso­  
lution. It is of no use to discover our own  
faults and infirmities, unless the discovery  
prompts us to amendment. I have thought  
if in addition to the hour which I daily  
give to the reading of the Bible, I should  
also from time to time (and especially on  
the Sabbath) apply another hour occasion­  
ally to communicate to you the reflection  
that arise in my mind upon us perusal, it  
might not only tend to fix and promote  
my own aftention to the excellent instruc  
tions of that Sacred Bonk, but perhaps  
also assist your advancement in its know

own, to write you several letters, in due  
time to follow this, in which I shall en­  
deavor to show you how you may derive  
the most advantage to yourself from the  
perusal of the Scriptures. It is probable,

aré a great‘many things in the Bible ‘‘hard to  
understand,” as Peter expressly says of Paul’s  
Epistles; some are hard in the Hebrew, and  
some in the Greek—the original languages 1  
which the Scriptures were written; some are  
harder still in the translations, I have been  
obliged to lead a wandering life abot the world,  
and scarcely ever have at hand the books which  
might help me to surmount these difficulties.  
Conscience sometimes puts the question—  
Whether my not understanding many passages  
is not owing to my want of attention in reading  
them. I must admit that it is; a full proof of  
which is, that every time | read the book thro’ I  
understand some passages which I never under-  
stood before, and which I should have done,  
at a furmer reading, had it been effected with a  
sufficient degree of attention. Then in answer  
to myself, I say—li is true; but I cannot always  
command my own attention, and never can to  
the degree that I wish. My mind is oft times  
so full of other things, absorbed in bodily pain,  
or engrossed by passion, or distracted by pleas-  
ure, or exhausted by dissipation, that I cannot  
give to proper daily employment the attention  
which | gladly would, and which is absolutely  
necessary to make it “fruitful of good works.”  
This acknowledgment of my weakness is just;  
bat for how much of it I am still accountable to  
God, | hardly dare to acknowledge to myself.  
Is it bodily paint How often was that brought  
upon me by my own imprudence ér foliy! Was  
it passiont Heaven has given to every huinan  
beg the power of controlling his passions, and  
if he neglects or loses it, the fault is his own,  
and he must be answerable for it. Was it plea-  
sure! Why did I indulge it! Was it dissipa-  
tiont This is the most inexcusable of all; for it |  
must have been occasioned by my own thought-  
lessness or irresolution. It is of no use to dis-  
cover our own faults and infirmities, unless the  
discovery prompts us to amendment. I have  
thought if, in addition to the hour which I daily  
give tothe reading of the Bible, I should also  
from time to time (and especially on the Sab-  
bath), apply another hour to communicate to |  
you the reflections that arise in my mind upon |  
its perusal, it might not only tend to fix and  
promote my own attention to the excellent in- |  
structions of that sacred book, but perhaps also |  
assist your advancement in its knowledge and’  
wisdom.  
At your age it is probable that you have still  
greater difficulties to understand all that you  
read in the Bible than I have at mine; and if  
you have so much self-observation «as your let-  
ters indicate, you will be sensible of as much  
want of attention, both voluntary and involunta-  
ry, as I here acknowledge in myself. I intend,  
therefore, for the purpose of contributing to}

you will not, at first reading, entirely understand |  
them; if that should be the case, ask your grand- |  
parents, or your uncle or aunt, to explain them; |  
if you still find them too hard, put them on file, |  
and lay them by for two or three years, after |  
which read them again, and you will find them  
easy enough. It is essential, my son, in order  
that you may go through life with eomfort to  
yourself and usefulness to your fellow creatures,  
that rou should form and adopt certain rules or!  
principles for the government of your own con-

you must soon come to the age when you tmust

LETTER No. l.  
  
Sr. Pererssure, Sept., 1811.  
  
My Dear Son: In your letter of the 18th of  
January, to your mother, you mentioned that  
you read to your aunt a chapter in the Bible or  
a section of Uoddridge’s Annotations every eve-  
ning. This information gavé me real pleasure;  
for so great is my veneration for the Bible, and  
so strong my beiief that, when duly read and  
meditated, it is of all books in the world that  
which contributes most to make men good, wise  
and happy, that the earlier my children begin to  
read it, the more steadily they pursue the prac-  
tice of reading it throughout their lives, the  
more lively and confident will be my hopes that  
they will prove useful citizens to their cvuatry,  
respectable members of society, and a real bless-  
ing to their pareuts, But | hope you have now  
arrived at an age to understand that reading,  
even in the Bible, is a thing 1m itself neither  
  
ood nor bad, but that all the good which can  
Fe drawn from it is by the use and improvement  
of what you have read, with the help of your re-  
flection.  
  
Young people sometimes boast of huw many  
books and how much they have read; when, in-  
stead of boasting, they ought to be ashamed of  
having wasted so much tine to so little profit.  
I advise you, my son, in whatever you read,  
and most of all in reading the ible, remember  
that itis forthe purpose of making you wiser  
and more virtuous. I have myself for many  
years made it a practice to read through the Bi-  
ble once every year. I have always endeavored  
to read it with the same spirit and temper of  
mind which I now recommend to you; that is,  
with the inteation and desire that it may con-  
tribute to my advancement in wisdom and virtue  
My desire is iadeed very imperfectly successful;  
for, like you, and like the Apostle Paul, ‘I find  
a law in my members, warring against the laws  
of my mind.” But as | know that it is my na-  
ture to be imperfect, so I know that it is my du-  
ty to aim at perfection; and feeling and deplor-  
ing my own frailties, I can only pray Almighty  
God for the aid of his Spirit to strengthen my  
good desires, and to subdue my propensities to  
evil; for it is from Him that every good and ev-  
ery perfect gift descends.  
  
My custom is to read four or five chapters ev-  
ery morning, immediately after rising from my  
bed. It employs about an hour of my time, and  
seems to me the most suitable manner of begin-  
ning the day. But as other cares, duties and oecu-  
  
ations engage the remainder of it, I have per.  
jt never #pent a sufficient portion of my time  
in oreditation of what I have read. Even medita-  
tion itself is often fruitless, unless it has some  
special object in view; useful thoughts often  
arise in the mind, and pass away without being  
remembered or applied to any good purposes—  
like the seed scattered upon the surface of the  
megy- which the birds devour, or the winds  
  
w away, or which rot without taking root,

under to become acquainted with them all. It  
is in the Bible you must learn them, and from  
the Bible how to practice them. Those duties  
are to God, to your fellow creatures and -to  
yourself. ‘*Thou shalt love the Lord thy God  
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and  
with all thy mind, and with all thy strength, and  
thy neighbor as thyself.’’ In these two com-  
mandments, Jesus Christ expressly says, ‘‘hang  
all the law and the prophets;&quot;’ thatis to say,  
the whole purpose of Divine revelation is to in-  
culcate them efficaciously upon the minds of  
men  
Yon will perceive that I have spoken of du-  
ties to yourself, distinct from those to God and  
to your fellow creatures; while Jesus Christ  
speaks only two commandments. ‘The reason  
is, because Christ and the commandments repeat-  
ed by him, consider self-love as so implanted in  
the heart of every man by the law of his nature,  
that it requires no commandment to establish its  
influence over the heart; and so great do they  
know its power to be, that they demand no oth-  
er measure for the love of ovr neighbor, than  
that which they know we shall have for our-  
selves. But fiom the love of God, and the love  
of our neighbor result duties to ourselves as wel]  
as to them, and they are all to be learned in  
equal perfection by our searching the Scriptires.  
Let us, then, search the*Scriptures ; and in or-  
der to pursue our inquiries with methodical order,  
let us consider the various sovrces of informa-  
tion that we may draw from in this study.  
  
The Bible contains the revelation of the will  
of God. It contains the history of the creation  
of the world, and of mankind ; and afterward the  
  
4 most extraordinary nation that has ever appeared  
upon the earth. It contains a system of religion,  
and of morality, which we may examine upon  
its own merits independent of the sanction it re-  
  
different ages of the world, by different authors,  
  
antiquity and as literary compositions.  
light soever we regard it, whether with reference  
  
mine of knowledge and virtue.

^knowledge myself. I« it bodily pain?  
How often was ihal brought upon me by tnjr

Hea ven.has given to every human being  
the power of controlling his passions, and  
if he neglects or lose, it, the fault is his own  
• and he must be answerable foi it. Was it  
pleasure ? This is the most inexcusable of  
all; for it must have been occasioned by  
my own thoughtlessness or irresolution.  
Ii is of no use to discover our own faults  
and infirmities, unless the discovery shall  
prompt us to amendment. I have though1  
if, in addition to the hoot which I daily  
give to the reading of the bible, I should also  
from time to time, (especially on the Sabs  
bath,) apply another hour occasionally to  
communicate to you the reflections that  
rose in my mind upon its perusal, it might  
not only tend to fix and promote my own  
’ attention to the excellent instructions of  
that holv Book, but perhaps also assist your  
advancement in its knowledge and wisdom.  
At your age, it is probable fhat yon have  
still geater difficulties to understand all tnat  
you read in the Bibte than 1 have at mine;  
and if you have as much self examination  
as your letters indicate, yon will, be  
sensible of as much want of attention, both  
voluntary and involuntary, ns I here ac­  
knowledge in myself.  
I intend, therefore, for tl pu’we of eon  
tributiug to your improve: eata d my own,  
to write you several letters m due time to  
follow this in which I shall endeavor to  
show you how you may derive the most ad&#x27;  
vant tge to yourself Irom the pernsalof the  
scriptures. It is probable when yon re­  
ceive these letters you will not on first read­  
ing, entirely understand them; if that  
should be the case ask your grandparents  
or your uncle or aunt to explain them if  
slill find them too hard, put them on file and  
lay them by for two or three yet rs afar  
which read them again, and you will find  
them easvenough I&#x27; isessential my son in  
or del that you may go through life with  
comfort to yourself and usefulness to your  
Ip ow creature, that you should torm and  
adoptcertatu rules and principles for the  
government of your own conduct amltem­  
per. Unless you have such rules and prin­  
ciples there wilt be numberless occasions on  
which you will have no guide for your gov.  
erutnent bin your pass&#x27;ons.  
  
In your infancy ami youth, you have  
been ami will be for some years under the  
authority and control of your friends and  
instructors, but you must soon come tothe  
age when you must govern yourself. Yon  
have altcady come to that age in many re­  
spects, you know the difference right and  
wrong, and you know some of your duties  
and the obligation you are under to become  
acquainted with them all It is in the B.s  
ble you must learn them, and from the Bi­  
ble how to practice them. Those duties  
are to God. to your fellow creatures and to  
yourself. ‘Thou shah love ihe Lord thy  
God with all thy heart and with all thv  
soul and with all thy mind, and thy neigh­  
-- iheself.&#x27; Ou these two command­  
■ ■v •»&#x27;- » p jj p er  
ments, Jesus Christ expressly sa*&quot;’ “  
ail the Law and ,he IVi-m&#x27;*,’ ,hal » 1(9  
say, the whole purpm* of Divine Revela­  
tion is to incubate them efficaciously upon  
the minds of men.  
You will perceive that 1 have spoken of  
duties lo yourself distinct from those to  
God and to your fellow creatures, while Je­  
sus Christ speaks only of two command­  
ments. The reason is, because Christ and  
the commandments repeated by him. con  
sider self love so implanted in the heart oi  
every man by the law of his nature, th at  
requires no commandment to establish its  
influence over the heart; and so gieat do  
they know its power to bo that they demand  
no other measure for the love of our neigh­  
bor than that which we shall have for our­  
selves. But from the love of God and the  
love of our neighbors result duties to our­  
selves as to them, and they aie all lobe  
learned in equal perfection by our search­  
iug the scriptures. Let u» then search the  
scriptures and in order to pursue our in  
quiries with methodical order, let us .con­  
nidcr ill* various sources of information  
thal we may draw from in this study.  
The Bible contains the Revelation of the  
Will of God, It contains the history of the  
world and of mankind; and alterwurds th*  
history of one peculiar nation,certainly the  
most extraordinary uatian that has ever ap­  
peared upon the earth, li contains a sys­  
tem of Religion and of Morality which we  
may examine upon its own merits, inde­  
pendent of the sanciiou it receives from  
being the word of God. and it contains a  
numerous collec’ion of books, written at dif­  
ferent ages of the world by different authors  
which we survey as curious monuments id  
antiquity and asliteiary compositions. In  
what light soever we regard it,whether witli  
reference to Revelation, to Literature, to  
History to Morality.—it is an iuvaluable  
and inexhaustible miue ol knowledge and  
virtue.  
  
I shall number separately those letters  
that I mean to write to you upon the sub*  
ject of the Bible, and as, after they are fin*  
»*hed, 1 shall perhaps ask you to read them  
altogether, or to look over them again my*  
self, you mutt keep them on teparate file.  
I wish:.that hereafter they may be useful  
to y«»l brothers and sisters, as well as to  
you. At you will receive them as a token  
ofaffedigo for during my absence, I pray  
that-they may be worthy to he read by  
them all wish benefit to themselves, if 1  
please God that they should all live to b&lt;  
able to understand them.

LETTER No. 1.  
Sr. Perersevac, Sept., 1811.  
  
My Dear Son: In your letter of the 18th of  
January, w your mother, you mentioned that  
you read to your aunt a chapter in the Bible or  
a section of Doddridge’s Annotations every eve-  
niog. This information gave me real pleasure;  
fur so great is my veneration for the Bible, and  
  
meditated, it is of all books in the world that  
which contributes most to make men good, wise  
and happy, that the earlier my children begin to  
read it, the more steadily they pursue the prac-  
tice of reading it throughout their lives, the  
more lively and confident will be my hopes that  
they will prove useful citizens to their country,  
respectable members of society, and a real bless-  
ing to their pareuts. But I hope you have now

ks and how much they have read; when, in-  
stead of boasting, they ought to be ashamed of  
having wasted so much time to so little profit.  
I advise you, my son, in whatever you read,  
and most of all in reading the Bible, remember  
that itis forthe purpose of making you wiser  
and more virtuous. I have myself for many  
years made ita practice to read through the Bi-  
ble once every year. I have always endeavored  
to read it with the same spirit and temper of  
mind which I now recommend tw you; that is,  
with the intention and desire that it may con-  
tribute to my advancement in wisdom and virtue  
My desire is indeed very imperfectly successful;  
for, like you, and like the Apostle Paul, “1 find  
  
of my mind.” But as ] know that it is my na-  
ture to be imperfect, so 1 know that it is my du-  
ty te aim at perfection; and feeling and deplor-  
ing my own frailties, I can only pray Almighty  
God for the aid of his Spirit to strengthen my  
good desires, and te subdue my propensities to  
evil; for it is from Him that every good and ev-  
ery perfect gift descends.  
  
My custom is to read four or five chapters ev-  
ery morning, immediately after rising from my  
bed. It employs about an hour of my time, and  
seems to me the mest suitable manner of begin-  
ning the day. But as other cares, duties and occu-  
panions engage the remainder of it, I have per-  
haps never spent a sufficient portion of my time  
in meditation of what I have read. Even medita-  
tion itself is often fruitless, unless it has some  
special object in view; useful thoughts often  
arise in the mind, and pass away without being  
remembered or applied to any good purposes—  
like the seed scattered upon the surface of the  
ground, which the birds devour, or the winds  
blow away, or which ret without taking root,  
however good the soil may be upon which they  
are cast.  
  
We are all, my dear George, unwilling to  
confess our own faults, even to ourselves, and  
when our own consciences are too honest to con-  
ceal them from us, our self Jove is always busy,  
either in attempting to disguise them to us under  
false and delusive colors, or seeking out excu-  
ses and apologies to reconcile them to our minds.  
Thus, although | am sensible that I have not de-  
rived from my assiduvus perusal of the Bible,  
(and [ might apply the same remark to almost  
everything -else that I do,) all the benefit that |  
might and ought, fam as constantly endeavor-  
ing to persuade myself that itis not my own  
fault. Sometimes | say to myself, I do not un-  
derstand what I have read; 1 cannot help 1; |  
did not make my own understanding: there are  
are a great many things in the Bible ‘‘hard to  
understand,” as Peter expressly says of Paul’s  
Epistles; some are hard in the Hebrew, and  
some.in the Greek—the original languages in  
which the Scriptures weré written; some are  
harder still in the translations. 1 have been  
obliged to lead a wandering life about the world,  
and searcely ever have at hand the books which  
might help me to surmount these difficulties.  
  
Conscience sometimes puts the question—  
Whether my not understanding many passages  
is not owing to my want of attention in reading  
them. I must admit that it is; a full proof of  
which is, that every time ] read the book thro’ I  
understand some passages which [ never under-  
stood before, and which 1 should have done,  
at a former reading, had it been effected with a  
sufficient degree of attention. Then in answer  
to myself, I say—lIt is true; but I cannot always  
command my own attention, and never can to  
the degree that | wish. My mind is oft times  
so full of other things, absorbed in bodily pain,  
or engrossed by passion, or distracted by pleas-  
ure, or exhausted by dissipation, that pie  
give to proper daily employment the attention  
which I gladly would, and which is absolutely  
necessary to make it “fruitful of good works.”  
  
This acknowledgment of my weakness is just;  
but for how much of it 1 am still accountable to  
God, [hardly dare to acknowledge to myself.  
Is it bodily pain? How often was that brought  
upon me by my own imprudence or folly!) Was!  
it passion! Heaven bas given to every huinan|  
being the power of controlling his passions, and |  
if he neglects or loses it, the fault is his own,  
and he must be answerable for it. Was it plea-

St. Penmaarao, Sept. 1811.  
Jfy Orer Sw—In your letter of (ho 15th January,  
to your mother, you mentioned that you read to  
rsorsunt a chapter in the Bibie, or a section of  
lioiiirilge&#x27;s Annotations every evening. This in­  
&gt;rmstiou gave me real pleasure, lor so great ii my  
narration for the Bible, and *0 strong my beliet  
,iit. when duly read and meditated, it i&lt; of all books  
i me world, that which contributes most to make  
arigood, sin and happy—that the eaiiier iny  
•Si.dren begin to ead it, the more »le»lily they  
jursue the piaclice of reading it throughout their 1  
•vs. the more lively and confident will be my  
tapes that they will prove useful citizens to their  
raaatry. respectable members of society, and a real  
Messing to their parents. But l hope you have now  
imvrd at an age to understand that reading, even  
ibe Bible, is a thing in itself neither good nor  
bad. but that all the good which can be diawn from  
. :■ by the use atd improvement of what you have  
• »t, with the help of your own reflection. Young  
.spile sometime boast of how many books and bow  
: eb they have read; when, instead ol boasting,  
tr.eyr ought to be ashamed of hating wasted so much  
::aie to so little profit. I advise you, my tun, in  
whatever you read, and must of ali in reading the  
Dble, to remember that it is for the purpose of tna  
king you wiser and more virtuous. I hare myself  
fur many years mads it a practice to read through  
the Bible once every jrrur. I hare always endeav­  
ored to read it with the same spiiil and temper of  
tr.ind which 1 uow rrcomaaeod to you; that is, with  
the intention and desire that it may contribute to  
«V si van cement in wiedoin and virtue. My desire  
a indeed very imperfectly suceeeAfui; tor, litr* yww.  
tnd like the Aposile Paul, &quot;I had a law in my mem­  
xn, warring against the laws of my mind.*’ But  
m 1 kuow that it is my nature to be imperfect, *0 1  
mow that it is my duty to aim at perfection; end  
lee ing and deploring iuy own Irailties, l can only  
uy Alm gbty (lou for the aid of his Spirit to  
urea;then my gool desires, and to subdue my pro­  
prn-ui a to evil; lor it is from Him that every good 1  
tad pertr-trail descends. My custom is, to read i  
!»ur or hreCnipter* every morning, immediately af- ,  
&gt;r using |runi iny bed. It emp oys about un hour ■  
si&#x27; my time, and wee-ns to mo the most suitable man- i  
3-r of brginiiing the day. But as other Caret, du- 1  
u-saut occupation* engage the remainder of it, I ]  
tare perhaps never a sutficient portion of my time j  
» meditation upon what 1 have read. Even |  
iriedita&#x27;iou itselt is often frui less, unlesi it his i  
•me sperial object in view; useful thoughts open j  
m* in the minil, and pass away without being re- j  
iremVred or applied to any goo&lt;l purjKiwo—like Hie I  
wed Seaitered upoit^Jic surface of iheground, which j  
tee birds devour, or the winds blow away, or which j  
&#x27; without taking root, however good the suit may I  
t* upon which they are cast.

war own laulls, eveu to ourselves, and when our  
wascietices are too honest to conceal them from us, I  
•ir setl-1 rve is always busy, either in attempting to  
. &lt;iui«e them to us under false and deiu-tve colors,  
w in seeking out excuses and apologies to reconcile  
rem to in»r minds. Thus, at&#x27;ho ugh I am sensible  
t’at I hare not derived from my amdious perusal  
1 the Kible, (and 1 might apply the same remark  
t almost everything else that I do.) all the benefit  
”a! 1 might, and ought, I am us constantly emieav­  
•nrg to persuade inyseif that it is Act my own fault.  
&#x27;■fD-li.&#x27;Des | say to myself, I do not understaud  
slut I have read; I cannot belp&#x27;it; I did not make  
ny own understanding; there are many things in  
the B.hle“har&#x27;t to understand,” as St. Peter express­  
!y says &lt;f PjuI&#x27;s Epistle;—some are bant in the Ife­  
•tr&#x27;w. imi some in the Greek—the original langua­  
r*v in which the Scriptures went written; some are  
harder still In the translation*. I have been obliged  
■n k-id a w undering life about Ihe world, and van e­  
d f,er have al hand the book which might help me  
vrrmeant these difficulties. Conscience some­  
&#x27; :°es pat the question—whether my not under*!an -  
J tnafy passages, is not owing to my want of  
v&#x27;t-ntiin iu reading them. I must admit that i»; a  
13 1 rrP«f of which is that every tune I read the Book

&quot;Young people sometimes boast of how many  
books and how much they have read; when, in­  
stead of boasting, they ought to be ashamed of  
having wasted so much time to so little profit.  
I advise you, my son, in whatever you read, and  
most of all in reading the Bible, remember that  
it is for the purpose of making you wiser and  
more virtuous. I have myself for many years  
made it a practice to read through the Bible  
once every year. I have always endeavored to  
read it with the same spirit and temper of mind  
which I now recommend to you; that is, with  
the intention and desire that it may contribute  
to my advancement in wisdom and virtue. My  
desire is indeed very imperfectly successful;  
for, like you, and the the apostle Paul, &quot;I find a  
law in my members, warring against the laws of  
my mind.&quot; But as I know it is my nature to be  
imperfect, so I know that it is my duty to aim at  
perfection; and feeling and deploring my own  
frailties, I can only pray Almighty God for the  
aid of his Spirit to strengthen my good desires,  
and to subdue my propensities to evil; for it is  
from him that every good and perfect gift de­  
scende  astom is to read four or fve chapters  
every morning, immediately after rising from my  
hed. It employs about half an hour of my time,  
and seems to me the most suitable manner of  
beginning the day.&quot;
