This is the state things are now in at the time of writing this letter; but it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign the preliminaries was motived upon a Note from the king of England to be admitted to the Congress for negociating Peace, which was consented to by the french upon the Condition of an Armistice at Sea, which England, before knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused. From all which it appears to me, judging from Circumstances, that the Emperor is now so compleatly in the hands of the french, that he has no way of getting out but by a peace. The Congress for the peace is to be held at Lunéville a Town in france. Since the

me account of the progress of Iron Bridges.  
  
The french revolution and Mr. Burke’s attack upon it, drew me off from any pontifical Works. Since my coming from England in 92, an Iron Bridge of a single arch 236 feet span, versed sine 34 feet, has been cast at the Iron Works of the Walkers where my Model was, and erected over the river Waer at Sunderland in the County of Durham in England. The two Members in Parliament for the County Mr Bourden and Mr. Milbank were the principal subscribers; but the direction was committed to Mr. Bourden. A very sincere friend of mine Sir Robt. Smyth who lives in france, and whom Mr. Monroe well knows, supposing they had taken their plan from my Model, wrote to Mr. Millbank upon the subject. Mr. Milbank answered the letter, which answer I have by me, and I give you word for word the part concerning the Bridge. “With respect to the Bridge over the river Waer at Sunderland it certainly is a Work well deserving admiration both for its structure […] and utility, and I have good grounds for saying that the first Idea was taken from Mr. Paine’s bridge exhibited at Paddington. But with respect to any Compensation to Mr Paine, however desirous of rewarding the labours of an engenious Man, I see not how it is in my power, having had nothing to do with the bridge after the payment of my subscription, Mr Bourden being accountable for the whole; But if you can point out any Mode by which I can be instrumental in procuring for Mr. P. any compensation for the advantages which the public may have derived from his engenious Model, from which certainly the outlines of the Bridge at Sunderland was taken, be assured it will afford me very great satisfaction.”  
I have now made two other Models, One in pasteboard five feet span and five inches of height from the cord. It is in the opinion of every person who has seen it one of the most beautifull objects the eye can behold. I

A friend of Paine’s wrote to Milbanke sup-  
posing that the constructors of the Sunderland  
bridge had made free with Paine’s model  
which was atthe iron works where the Sunder-  
land bridge was cast. Mr. Milbanke writes,  
“With respect to my bridge over the river  
Wear at Sunderland, it is certainly a work  
deserving of admiration, both from its struc-  
ture and utility. And I have good grounds  
for saying that the first idea was suggested by  
Mr. Paine’s bridge exhibited at Paddington.  
What difference there may be in some part of  
the structure or the proportions of wrought  
and cast-iron I cannot pretend to say, Bour-  
don having undertaken to build the bridge
