m my fast friend Mr. Cooper, Secretary of the Treasury. He desired me by a little note to call upon him there, which I did, when he told me, that the Duke of Grafton had mentioned to him some discourse of Lord Sandwich’s as if the office suffered by my absence, and that it would be fit to appoint another, as I seemed constantly to reside in England: that Mr. Todd the Secretary of the Post Office had also been with the Duke, talking to the same purpose &amp;c. That the Duke had wished him (Mr. Cooper) to mention this to me, and to say to me at the same time that though my going to my post might remove the objection, yet if I chose rather to reside in England, my merit was such in his opinion, as to entitle me to something better here, and it should not be his fault if I was not well provided for. I told Mr. Cooper that without having heard any exception had been taken to my residence here, I was really preparing to return home, and expected to be gone in a few weeks. That however I was extremely sensible of the Duke’s goodness in giving me this intimation and very thankful for his favourable disposition towards me; that having lived long in England, and contracted a friendship and affection for many persons here, it could not but be agreeable to me to remain among them some time longer, if not for the rest of my life; and that there was no nobleman to whom I could from sincere respect for his great abilities, and amiable qualities, so cordially attach myself, or to whom I should so willingly be obliged for the provision he mentioned, as to the Duke of Grafton, if his Grace should think I could, in any station where he might place me, be serviceable to him and to the public. Mr. Cooper said he was very glad to hear I was still willing to remain in England, as it agreed so perfectly with his inclinations to keep me here. Wished me to leave my name at the Duke of Grafton’s as soon as possible and to be at the Treasury again the next board day. I accordingly called at the Duke’s and left my card; and when I went next to the Treasury, his Grace not being there, Mr. Cooper carried me to Lord North, Chancellor of the Exchequer,  who said very obligingly, after talking of some American affairs, I am told by Mr. Cooper that you are not unwilling to stay with us, I hope we shall find some way of making it worth your while. I thanked his lordship, and said I should stay with pleasure if I could any ways be useful to government. He made me a compliment, and I took my leave, Mr. Cooper

was to have been vested with my place; but this is surmise only. We parted very good friends. That day I received another note from Mr. Cooper directing me to be at the Duke of Grafton’s next morning, whose porter had orders to let me in. I went accordingly, and was immediately admitted. But his Grace being then engaged in some unexpected business, with much condescension and politeness made that apology for his not discoursing with me then, but wished me to be at the Treasury at twelve the next Tuesday. I went accordingly, when Mr. Cooper told me something had called the Duke into the country, and the board was put off, which was not known till it was too late to send me word; but was glad I was come, as he might then fix another day for me to go again with him into the country; the day fixed was Thursday. I returned yesterday, should have stayed till Monday, but for writing by these vessels. He assures me the Duke has it at heart to do som

 I can recollect in that country. It has been mentioned in the papers some time, but I have only just now received a letter from Governor Wright, informing me that he had that day given his assent to it, and expressing his desire to correspond with me on all occasions, saying the Committee, as soon as they could get their papers ready, would write to me and acquaint me with their business. We have lost Lord Clare from the Board of Trade. He took me home from Court, the Sunday before his removal, that I might dine with him as he said alone, and talk over American affairs. He seemed as attentive to them as if he was to continue ever so long. He gave me a great deal of flummery; saying that though at my examination I answered some of his questions a little pertly,  yet he liked me from that day, for the spirit I showed in defence of my country; and at parting, after we had drank a bottle and half of claret each, he hugged and kissed me, protesting he never in his life met with a man he was so much in love with. This I write for your amusement. You see by the nature of this whole letter that it is to yourself only. It may serve to prepare your mind for any event that shall happen. If Mr. Grenville comes into power again in any department respecting America,  I must refuse to accept of any thing that may seem to put me in his power, because I apprehend a breach between the two countries; and that refusal will give offence. So that you see a turn of a die may make a great difference in our affairs. We may be either promoted, or discarded; one or the other seems likely soon to be the case, but ’tis hard to divine which. I am myself grown so old as to feel much less than formerly the spur of ambition, and if it were not for the flattering expectation, that by being fixed here I might more effectually serve my country, I should certainly determine for retirement, without a moment’s hesitation. I am as ever, your affectionate father,

 him an Irish peer, first as Viscount  
Clare and afterwards as Earl Nugent; and  
at that prince’s accession he already held  
the valuable sinecure of Vice-Treasurer of  
Ireland.  
  
Asa politician Nugent wasextremely active,  
and not more scrupulous than most of his  
contemporaries. He found it possible to  
hold office under the Pelhams and Pitt in  
the reign of George II., and in that of his  
successor to serve under Grenville, Rocking-  
ham, and Chatham, one after the other. As  
Commissioner of Trade and Plantations he  
had dealings with Benjamin Franklin, who  
on July 2nd, 1768, wrote to his brother :—  
  
‘* We have lost Lord Clare from the Board  
of Trade. He took me home from Court the  
Sunday before his removal, that I might dine  
with him, as he said, alone, and talk over  
American affairs. He seemed as attentive to  
them as if he was to continue for ever so long.  
He gave mea great deal of flummery—saying  
that though at my examination I had answered  
some of his questions a little pertly, yet he  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
liked me from that day, for the spirit I showed  
in defence of my country ; and at parting, after  
we had drunk a bottle and a half of claret each,  
he hugged and kissed me, vowing he had never  
in his life met with a man he was so much in  
love with.”  
  
Nugent represented Bristol for twenty  
years, and was in some respects the worthy  
predecessor of Burke, the liberality of hi

use his own words:  
  
I was extremely sensible of the Duke’s good-  
ness . . . and very thankful for his favorable  
disposition towards me; that, having lived long  
in England, and contracted a friendship and affec-  
tion for many persons here, it could not but be  
agreeable to me to remain among them some time  
longer, if not for the rest of my life; and that  
there was no nobleman to whom I could, from  
sincere respect for his great abilities and amia-  
ble qualities, so cordially attach myself, or to  
whom I should so willingly be obliged for the  
provision he mentioned, as to the Duke of Graf-  
ton, if his Grace should think I could, in any  
station where he might place me, be serviceable  
to him and to the public.  
  
  
  
FRANKLIN AS POLITICIAN  
  
As if this was not a sufficient forgetting  
of his own aphorism that “a ploughman on  
his legs is worthier than a nobleman on his  
knees,” for some weeks he left no stone un-  
turned to cultivate the ministry. Acting on  
advice, “I accordingly called at the Duke’s

after talking of some American affairs, ‘ I
