Gentlemen,  
Philadelphia October 26. 1774  
We give you the strongest proof of our reliance on your zeal and attachment to the happiness of America and the cause of Liberty, when we commit the inclosed papers to your care.  
We desire you will deliver the Petition into the hands of his Majesty, and after it has been presented, we wish it may be made public thro’ the press, together with the list of Grievances. And as we hope for great assistance from the spirit, virtue and justice of the nation; it is our earnest desire that the most effectual care be taken, as early as possible to furnish the trading Cities, and manufacturing towns throughout the united Kingdom, with our memorial to the people of Great-Britain.  
We doubt not but that your good sense and discernment, will lead you to avail yourselves of every assistance that may be derived from the advice and friendship of all great and good men, who may incline to aid the cause of liberty and mankind.  
The gratitude of America expressed in the inclosed vote of thanks, we desire may be conveyed to the deserving objects of it, in the manner that you think will be most acceptable to them.  
It is proposed that another Congress be held on the 10th May next at this place, but in the mean time we beg the favour of you Gentlemen to transmit to the speakers of the several Assemblies the earliest information of the most authentic accounts you can collect, of all such conduct and designs of ministry or Parliament, as it may concern America to know.
