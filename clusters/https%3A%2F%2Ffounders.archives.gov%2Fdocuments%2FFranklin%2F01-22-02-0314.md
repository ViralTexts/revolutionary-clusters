on of Rights,  
  
Brought in by the Committee appointed for that Purpose, and  now under the Consideration of the Convention of the State of Pennsylvania.  
1. That all Men are born equally free and independant, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable Rights, amongst which are the enjoying and defending Life and Liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting Property, and pursuing and obtaining Happiness and Safety.  
2. That all Men have a natural and unalienable Right to worship almighty God according to the Dictates of their own Consciences and Understandings: And that no Man ought or of Right can be compelled to attend any any Place of Religious Worship or erect or support or maintain any Worship, Place or any place of worship or maintain any Ministry, contrary to, or against his own free will and Consent. Nor can any Man who acknowledges the Being of a God be justly deprived or abridged of any Civil Right as a Citizen, on account of his Religious Sentiments or peculiar Mode of religious Worship. And that no Authority can or ought to be vested in, or assumed by, any Power whatever that shall in any Case interfere with, or in any Manner controul, the Right of Conscience in the free Exercise of religious Worship.  
3. That the People of this State have the sole exclusive and inherent Right of governing and regulating the internal Police of the same.  
4. That all Power being originally inherent in, and consequently derived from, the People, therefore all Officers of Government, whether Legislative or Executive, are their Trustees and Servants, and at all Times accountable to them.  
5. That Government is or ought to be instituted for the common Benefit, Protection and Security of the People, Nation or Community,* [in the margin: *And not] and that a Majority of the Community hath an indubitable, unalienable and indefeasible Right to reform, alter or abolish it Government in such a Manner as shall be by that Majority Community judged most conducive to the Public Weal.  
6. That those who are employed in the Legislative and Executive Business of the State may be restrained from Oppression, by feeling and participating the common Burthens, the People have a Right, at such Periods as they may think proper, to reduce their Public Officers to a private Station, return them into that Body from which they were originally taken, and supply the Vacancies by certain and regular Elections: But that the having served in any Office, ought not in all Cases to disqualify the Person from being reelected.  
7. That all Elections ought to be free, and that all free Men having ana sufficient evident, permanent andand common Interest with, and Attachment to, the Community, have a Right to elect Officers, or be elected into Office.  
8. That all private Property, being protected by the State, ought to pay its just Proportion towards the Expence of that Protection; but that no Part of a Man’s Property can be justly taken from him, or applied to Public Uses, without his own Consent, or that of his legal Representatives: Nor are the People bound by any Laws but such as they have, in like Manner, assented to, for their common Good.  
9. That in all Criminal Prosecutions for Criminal Offenses a Man hath a Right to be heard by  himself and hisCouncil, to demand the Cause and Nature of his Accusation, to be confronted with the Accusers or Witnesses, to call for Evidence in his Favour, and a speedy public Trial by an impartial Jury of the Country, without whosethe unanimous Consent of which jury he cannot be found guilty, nor can he be compelled to give Evidence against himself, nor can any Man be justly deprived of his Liberty, except by the Laws of the Land, or the Judgment of his Peers.  
10 That the People have a Right to hold themselves, their Houses, Papers and Possessions free from Search or Seizure, and therefore  
10. That Warrants without Oaths or Affirmations first made, affording a sufficient Foundation for them, and whereby any Officer or Messenger may be commanded or required to search suspected Places, or to seize any Person or Persons his or their Property not particularly described, are contrary to that Right, and ought not to be granted.  
11. That in Controversies respecting Property, and in Suits between Man and Man, the Parties have a Right to Trial by Jury, which ought to be held sacred.  
12. That the People have a Right to Freedom of Speech, and of writing and publishing their Sentiments, therefore the Freedom of the Press ought not to be restrained.  
13. That the People have a Right to bear Arms for the Defence of themselves and the State, and as standing Armies in the Time of Peace are dangerous to Liberty, they ought not to be kept up: And that the Military should be kept under strict Subordination to, and governed by, the Civil Power.  
14. That a frequent Recurrence to fundamental Principles, and a firm Adherence to Justice, Moderation, Temperance Industry and Frugality are absolutely necessary to preserve the Blessings of Liberty, and keep a Government free, the People have therefore a Right to exact a due and constant Regard to these Points from their Legislators or Officers and Representatives in the making and executing such laws as are necessary for the good Govt. of the State.  
15. That all Men have a natural inherent Right ofto Emigratione from one State to any other that will receive them, or for theto Forming a new State in vacant or purchased Countries,vacant Countries, or in such Countries as they can purchase, whenever they find that thereby they may promote their own Happiness.  
16. That an enormous Proportion of Property vested in a few Individuals is dangerous to the Rights, and destructive of the

dent, and having certain natural, inherent and unalien-

ficers of government, whether legislative or executive,  
are their trustees and servants, and at all times accoun-  
table to them.  
  
5th, That government is, or ought to be, instituted  
for the common benefit, protection and security of the  
people, nation or community; and not for the particular  
emolument or advantage of any single man, family or  
set of men who are a part only of that community: And  
that the community hath an indubitable, unalienable  
and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish govern-  
ment in such a manner as shall be by that community  
judged most conducive to the public weal.  
  
6th, That those who are ewployed in the legislative  
and executive business of the state, may be restrained

such as they have in like manner assented to, for their  
common good.  
  
9th, That in all prosecutions for criminal offences, a  
man hath a right to be heard by himself, and his coun-  
sel, to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, to  
be confronted with the witnesses, to call for evidence  
in his favour, and a speedy public trial, by an impartial  
jury ofthe country, without the unanimous consent of  
which jury he cannot be found guilty: Nor c#n he be  
compelled to give evidence against himself: Nor can  
any man be justly deprived of his liberty, except by the  
laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.  
  
10th, That the people have a right to bold themselves,  
their houses, papers and possessions free from search or  
seizure; and therefore, warrants without oaths or affirm-  
ations first made, affording a sufficient foundation for  
them, and whereby any officer or messenger may be  
commanded or required to search suspected places, or  
to seize any person or persons, his or their preey  
not particularly described, are contrary to that right,  
and ought not to be granted.  
  
11th, That in controversies respecting property, and  
in suits between man and man, the parties have a right  
to trial by jury, which ought to be held sacred.  
  
. 12th, Thatthe people have a right to freedom of  
speech, and of writing, and publishing their sentiments;  
therefore the freedom of the press ought not to be re-  
strained.  
  
13th, That the people have a right to bear arms for  
the defence of themselves and the state; and as standing  
armies,in the time of peace,are dangerous to liberty, they  
ought not to be kept up: And that the military should  
not be kept under strict subordination to, and govern-  
ed by the civil power.  
  
14th, That a frequent recurrence to fundamental prin-  
ciples, and a firm adherence to justice, moderation, tem-  
perance, industry and frugality, are absolutely necessa-  
ry to preserve the blessings of liberty, and keep a gov-  
ernment free: The people ought therefore to pay _par
