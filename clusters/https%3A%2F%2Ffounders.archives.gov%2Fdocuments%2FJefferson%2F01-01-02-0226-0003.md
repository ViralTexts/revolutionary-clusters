Whereas from the great extent of the County of Fincastle, many inconveniencies attend the more distant inhabitants thereof on account of their remote situation from the Court house of the said  County, and many of the said inhabitants have petitioned this present General Assembly for a division of the same—Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that from and after the last day of December next ensuing the said County of Fincastle shall be divided into three Counties, that is to say, all that part thereof which lies to the South and Westward of a line beginning on the Ohio at the mouth of great Sandy creek and running up the same and the main or north easterly branch thereof to the great Laurel ridge or Cumberland Mountain, thence south westerly along the said Mountain, to the line of North Carolina, shall be one distinct County and called and known by the name of Kentuckey, and all that part of the said county of Fincastle included in the lines beginning at the Cumberland Mountain where the line of Kentucke county intersects the North Carolina line, thence east along the said Carolina line to the top of the Iron Mountain, thence along the same easterly to the source of the south fork of Holstein river, thence northwardly along the highest part of the high lands, ridges and mountains, that divide the waters of the Tennessee from those of the great Kanhawa to the most easterly source of Clinch river, thence Westwardly along the top of the mountains that divide the waters of Clinch river from those of the great Kanhaway and Sandy creek to the line of Kentucke county, thence along the same to the beginning shall be one other distinct county and called and known by the name of Washington, and all the residue of the said county of Fincastle shall be one other distinct county and shall be called and known by the name of Montgomery.  
And for the Administration of Justice in the said Counties of Montgomery, Washington and Kentuckey after the same shall take place, Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that after the said last day of December a court for every of the said Counties of Montgomery, Washington, and Kentuckey, shall be held by the Justices thereof respectively upon the following days in every Month, to wit, for the County of Montgomery on the first tuesday in every month, for the county of Washington on the last tuesday in every month, and for the county of Kentuckey on the first tuesday in every month in such manner as is by law provided for other counties, and as shall be by their commissions directed.  
Provided allways that nothing herein contained shall be construed to hinder the sheriff of the said county of Fincastle as the same now stands intire and undivided from collecting and making  distress for any publick dues or officers fees, which shall remain unpaid by the Inhabitants thereof, at the time such division shall take place, but such sheriff shall have the same power to collect and distrain for such dues and fees and shall be accountable for them in the same manner as if this Act had never been made, any law, usage, or custom to the contrary thereof in any wise
