Washington June 2. 07.  
  
While Burr’s case is depending before the court, I trouble you from time to time with what occurs to me. I  
observe that the case of Marbury v. Madison has been cited, and I think it material to stop at the threshold the citing  
that case as authority &amp; to have it denied to be law. 1. Because the judges in the outset disclaimed all cognisance of  
the case; altho’ they then went on to say what would have been their opinion had they had cognisance of it. this then was  
confessedly an extrajudicial opinion, and as such of no authority. 2. because had it been judicially pronounced, it would  
have been against law; for to a commission, a deed, a bond delivery is essential to give validity. until therefore the  
commission is delivered out of the hands of the Executive &amp; his agents, it is not his deed. he may withold or cancel it  
at pleasure as he might his private deed in the same situation. the constitution intended that the three great branches of  
the government should be co-ordinate, &amp; independant of each other. as to acts therefore which are to be done by either,  
it has given no controul to another branch. a judge I presume cannot sit on a bench without a commission, or a record of a  
commission: and the constitution having given to the judiciary branch no means of compelling the Executive either to  
deliver a commission or to make a record of it, shews it did not intend to give the judiciary that controul over the  
Executive, but that it should remain in the power of the latter to do it or not. where different branches have to act in  
their respective lines, finally &amp; without appeal, under any law, they may give to it different &amp; opposite  
constructions. thus in the case of William Smith, the H. of R. determined he was a citizen, and in the case of Wm. Duane  
(precisely the same in every material circumstance) the judges determined he was no citizen. in the cases of Callender &amp;  
some others the judges determined the Sedition act was valid under the constitution, and exercised their regular powers  
of sentencing them to fine &amp; imprisonments. but the Executive determined that the Sedition act was a nullity under the  
constitution, and exercised his regular power of prohibiting the execution of the sentence, or rather of executing the  
real law which protected the acts of the defendants. from these different constructions of the same act by different  
branches, less mischief arises than from giving to any one of them a controul over the others. the Executive &amp; Senate  
act on the construction that until delivery from the Executive department a commission is in their possession &amp; within  
their rightful power; and in case of commissions not revocable at will, where (after the Senate’s approbation &amp; the  
President’s signing &amp; sealing, new information of the unfitness of the person has come to hand before the delivery of  
the commission) new nominations have been made, &amp; approved and new commissions have issued. on this construction I have  
hitherto acted, on this I shall ever act, and maintain it with the powers of the government against any controul which may  
be attempted by the judges in subversion of the independance of the Executive &amp; Senate within their peculiar department.  
I presume therefore that in a case where our decision is by the constitution the supreme one, &amp; that which can be  
carried into effect, it is the constitutionally authoritative one, and that that by the judges was coram non judice, &amp;  
unauthoritative, because it cannot be carried into effect. I have long wished for a proper occasion to have the gratuitous  
opinion in Marbury v. Madison brought before the public &amp; denounced as not law: &amp; I think the present a fortunate one  
because it occupies such a place in the public attention. I should be glad therefore if, in noticing that case you could  
take occasion to express the determination of the Executive that the doctrines of that case were given extrajudicially &amp;  
against law, &amp; that their reverse will be the rule of action with the Executive. if this opinion should not be your own,  
I would wish it to be expressed merely as that of the Executive. if it is your own also, you would of course give to the  
arguments such a developement as a case incidental only might render proper. I salute you with friendship and respect.

“WasHiNnGTON, Jure 2,1807. |  
“DeAR Sin : While Burr’s case is depending  
before the Court, I will trouble you from time to  
time with what occars to me. 1 observe that the  
case of Marbury vs. Madison has been cited ; and I |  
think it mateiial to stop at the threshold the citing  
that case as authority, and to have it denied to be  
law. 1. Becausethe judges inthe outset, disclaim­  
ed all cognizance of the case, although they then  
went on to say what would kave been theit opinion,  
hiad they had cognizance of it. This then, was con­  
fessedly an extra-judicial opmion, and,as such,of no  
authority. 2: Because, had it been judically pro­  
nounced, it would have been against law ; for to a  
commission, a deed, or bond, delivery is essential,  
to give validity. Until; therefore, the commission  
is delivered out of the hands of the Executive  
and bis agents, it is not his deed. e may with­  
hold or cancel it at pleasure, as he might his pri­  
vate deed in the same sitnation. &#x27;T&#x27;he Constitation  
intended that the thiree great branches of the Govern­  
ment should be co-ordinate, aud independant of  
each other. As to acts, therefore, which ate to be  
done by either, it has given no control (n another  
branch. A judge, I presumne, cannot sit on a bench  
without a commission, or a record of a commission;  
and the Constitution having given to the Judiciary  
branch no means of compelling the Executive either  
to deliver a commission, or to make a record of it  
shows it did not intend to give the Judiciary that  
control over the Executive, but that it should re­  
wain in the power of the latter to do it or not.  
Where different branches have to act in their re­  
spective lines, finally and without appeal, under  
any law, they may give to it different and opposite  
constructions. Thus, in the case of William Smith  
the House of Representatives determined he was a  
citizen ; and in the case of William Duane, (pre­  
cisely the same in every material circumstance,)  
the judges determined he was no citizen. In the  
cases of Callendar and others, the judges determin­  
ed the sedition act was valid under the Constitution,  
and exercised their regular powers of sentencing  
them to fine and imprisonment. But the Executive  
determined that that the sedition act was a nullity  
under the Constitation, and exercised his regular  
‘power of prohibiting the execution of the sentence  
rather of executing the real law, which protected

‘that ¢ase were given extra-judicially and agninst law  
and that the reverse will be the rule of action - with  
the Execative. If this opinion should not be your  
own, T would wish it to be expressed merely as  
that of the Execative. If it is your own, also, you

* I observe that the case of Marbury v. Madison  
has been cited in the Burr case, and I think it  
material to stop at the threshold the citing this  
case as authority, and to have it denied as law: 1.  
Because the other judges in the court disclaimed  
all cognizance of the case. This, then, was con-  
fessedly an extra-judicial opinion, and, as such, of  
no authority. 2. Because, had it been judicially  
pronounced, it would have been against law. * * *  
I have long wished for a proper occasion to have  
this gratuitous opinion of Marshall in Marbury  
y. Madison before the public and denounced rot  
as law; and the present opportunity is a fortunate  
one, because the case occupies such a high place  
in the public attention. I should be glad, there-  
fore, if, in noticing that case, you could take occa-  
sion to express the determination of the executive  
that the doctrines of that case were given extra-  
judicially, and against law, and that the reverse  
will be the rule of action of the executive.”

“T have hitherto acted; on this I shall ever act,  
and maintain it with the powers of the govern-  
ment.” Here is presented a historical fact of  
great interest, an open collision between two :o-  
ordinate branches of government, the executive  
and the judicial.  
  
Notwithstanding Marshall’s decision; Madison,  
the secretary of state, refused to deliver the com-  
mission to Marbury, under the direction of Jeft-  
ferson, who continued to hold that the opinion cf  
Marshall was coram non judice.
