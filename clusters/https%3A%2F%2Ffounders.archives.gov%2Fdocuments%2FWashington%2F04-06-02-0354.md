Mount Vernon July 20th 1788.  
  
I have received your favor of the 20th of June and thank you heartily for the confidential information contained in it. The character given of a certain great Personage, who is remarkable for neither forgetting or forgiving, I believe to be just. What effect the addition of such an extraordinary weight of power &amp; influence as the arrangement of the East India affairs gives to one branch of the British governmt cannot be certainly foretold: but one thing is certain, that is to say, it will always be wise for America to be prepared for events. Nor can I refrain from indulging the expectation that the time is not very distant, when it shall be more in the power of the United States than it hath hitherto been, to be forearmed as well as forewarned against the evil contingencies of European politics.  
You will have perceived from the Public papers, that I was not erroneous in my calculation that the Constitution would be accepted by the Convention of this State. The majority, it is true, was small; &amp; the minority respectable in many points of view. But the greater part of the minority here, as in most other States, have conducted themselves with great prudence &amp; political moderation; insomuch that we may anticipate a pretty general and harmonious acquiescence. We shall impatiently wait the result from New York &amp; North Carolina. The other State which has not yet acted is nearly out of the question. As the infamy of the conduct of Rhode Island outgoes all precedent, so the influence of her Counsels can be of no prejudice. There is no State or description of Men but would blush to be involved in a connection with the Paper-money Junto of that Anarchy. God grant that the hones

I am happy to hear from General Lincoln &amp; others that affairs are taking a good turn in Massachusetts. But the triumph of  
  
salutary &amp; liberal measures over those of an opposite tendency seems to be as complete in Connecticut as in any State &amp; affords a particular subject for congratulation. Your friend Colo.

Indeed, for myself, since so much liberality has been displayed in the construction &amp; adoption of the proposed general Government, I am almost disposed to be of the same opinion.
