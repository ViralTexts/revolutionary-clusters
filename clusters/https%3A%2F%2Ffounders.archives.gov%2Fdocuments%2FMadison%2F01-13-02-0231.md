United States Decr. 8th. 1790  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives.  
In meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our Country with plenty, and with the means of a flourishing commerce. The progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American Stock abroad as well as at home. And the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes, have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources, but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add, as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our Citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.  
In conforming to the powers vested in me by Acts of the last Session, a loan of three Millions of florins, towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place, has been compleated in Holland. As well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The Secretary of the Treasury has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.  
Since your last Sessions I have received communications by which it appears that the District of Kentucky, at present a part of Virginia, has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that State; in consequence of which the District is to become a distinct member of the Union, in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the Papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties; and the sentiments of warm attachment to the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow Citizens of Kentucky cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you.  
It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the North West side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depridations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such parts of the Neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their voilences [sic] with fresh alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a number of valuable Citizens have thus been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking; whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.  
  
These aggravated provocations render’d it essential to the safety of the Western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the Government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the Act which empowers the President to call out the Militia for the protection of the frontiers. And I have accordingly authorised an Expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such draughts of Militia as were deemed sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.  
The disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we shou’d not overlook the tendency of a War and even of preparations for a War, among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this Country, to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode, it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies, by such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign Bottoms, which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.  
Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranian. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it distressful to us, that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.  
The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a Judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider, in your wisdom, whether improvements, in that system may yet be made; and particularly whether an uniform process of Execution on sentences issuing from the federal Courts be not desireable through all the States.  
  
The patronage of our commerce, of our Merchants and Seamen, has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign Countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them, either by express Convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his Most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases, the aid of the national authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.  
The establishment of the Militia—of a Mint—of Standards of Weights and Measures—of the Post Office and Post Roads, are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course, and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favorite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt funded, but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the Country will permit, to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the Western lands explain your dispositions on this subject: and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt, the more salutary will the measure be to every public interest, as well as the more satisfactory to our Constituents.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives.  
In persuing the various and weighty business of the present Session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom; and animated by the love of your Country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward, if by a successful administration [of] our respective trusts we can make the established Government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow Citizens, and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.  
Go: Washington

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and  
Houfe of Keprefentatives,  
  
IN meeting you again, I feel  
much fatisfaction in being able to  
repeat my congr atulations on the  
fav ourable prot pects which continue  
to diftinguith our public affairs. The  
abundant fruits of another year, have  
blefled our country with plenty and  
with the means of flour ifhing com-  
merce. The progrefs of pub lic cree  
dit is witnefled by a confiderable rife  
of American ftock abroad, as well as  
at home; and the revenues allotted  
for this and other national purpofes,  
have been produétive beyond the  
calculation by which they were re-  
gulated. This latter circumftance  
is the more pleafing, as it is not  
only 4 proof of the fertility of our  
refources, but as it aif res us of a  
further increafe of the national re-  
{pectability and credit; and let me  
add, as it bears an honourable tef-  
timony to the patriotifin and inte-  
grity of the marine part of our citi-  
zens. The punctuality of the former  
in difcharging their engagements has  
been exe mp! ilVe  
  
In conforming tothe powers vefted  
in me by aéts of the laft feffion,  
loan of 2,000,000 OF florins, towards  
which fom proviftonal meafureshad  
pre vioully taken place, has been com-  
pleted in Holland. As well the ce-  
lerity with which it has been filled,  
as the nature of thé ter ms (con(jder-  
ing the more than ordinary demand  
for borrowing, created by the fitu.  
ation of Europe) give a reafonable  
hope that the further execution of  
thofe powers may proc eed with ad-  
vantage and fuccefs, The fecretary  
of the treafury has my diretions to  
communicate fuch further puticu-

lars as may be requifite for more  
precife information.  
  
Since your laft feffions, I have re.  
ceived communication, by which it  
appears, that the diftriét of Ken-  
tucky, at prefent a part of Virginia,  
has concurred tn certain propofitions  
contained in a law of that ftate, in  
confequence of which the diltriet is  
to become a diftinét member of the  
union, in cafe the requifite fanétion  
of congrefs be added. for this fanc-  
tion application is now made. I fhall  
caufe the papers on this very impor-  
tant tranfsction to be laid before vou.  
‘The liberality and harmony with  
which it has been conducted, will be  
found to do great honour to both the  
parties; and the fentiments of warm  
attachment to the union and its pre-  
fent government, expretled by our  
fellow-citizens of Kentucky, cannot  
fail to add an affectionate concern  
for their particular welfare to the  
great national imprefhons on which  
you will decide on the cafe fubmitted  
to you.  
  
It has bcen heretofore known to  
congrefs, that frequent incurfions  
have been made on our frontier  
fettlements by certain banditti of  
Indians, from the north-weft fide  
of the Ohio. Thefe, with fome of  
the tribes dwelling on and near the  
Wabath, have of late been particu-  
larly active in their depredations ;  
and, being emboldened by the im-  
punity of their crimes, and aided by  
fuch part of the neighbouring tribes  
as could be feduced to join in their  
hoftilities, or afford them a retreat  
for thet prifoners and plunder, they  
have, inftead of liftening to the hu-  
mane mivitations and overtures made  
on the part of the United States, re-  
newed their violence with frefh ala-  
erity and greater eff &amp;.  
  
The lives  
of a number of  
  
| valuable citizens  
have thus been facrificed, and fome

of them under circumftances peculi.  
arly fhocking, whilft others have been  
carried into a deplorable captivity,  
  
Thefe aggravated provocations  
rendered it eifential to the fafety of  
the weftern fettlements, that the av.  
greflors fhould be made fenfible thar  
the government of the Union is por  
lefs capable of punifhing their crime  
than it is difpofcd to refpect their  
rights and reward their attachments,  
As this object could not be effected  
by defenfive meafures, it became ne-  
ceflary to put dn force the act which  
empowers the prefident to call out  
the militia for the protection of the  
frontiers: and I have accordingly  
authorifed an expedition, in which  
the regular troops in that quarter  
are combined with fuch drafts of  
militia as were deemed futtcient.  
The event of the meafure is yet  
unknown to me. The fecretary at  
war is direéted to lay before you  
a ftatement of the information on  
which it is founded, as well as an  
eftimate of the expence with which  
it will be attended.  
  
The difturbed fituation of Eu.  
rope, and particularly the critical  
potture of the great maritime pow-  
ers, while it ought to make us more  
thankful for the general peace and  
fecurity enjoyed by the United  
States, reminds us at the fame time  
of the circumfpeétion with which  
it becomes us to preferve thefe  
bleflings. It requires alfo that we  
fhould not overlook the tendency of  
a war, and even preparations fora  
war, among the nations moft con-  
cerned in a¢tive commerce with this  
country, to abridge the means, and  
thereby at leaft enhance the price ot  
tranfporting its valuable productions  
to their proper markets. 1 recom:

mav fail us in the very mBments

obiets. Our aifheries and the trant-  
  
otation of our own produce, offer  
us abundant means for guarding our-  
felves agai! ift this ev il.  
  
Your attention feems to be not  
lefs due to that particular branch ot  
our trade which belongs to the Me-  
diterrancan. So manycircumftances  
unite in rendering the prefent ftate  
of it diftrefsiul to us, that vou will  
not think any deliberations mifem-  
ployed whic h may lead to its relict  
and protection.  
  
The laws you have already pafled,  
for the eftablifament of a judici lary  
fyftem, have opened the doors of  
juftice to all defcriptions of perfons.  
You will confider in your wifdom,  
whether improvements in that fy{-  
tem may yet be made, and particu-  
larly whether an uniform procets of  
execution on fentences iffuing from  
the federal courts be not defirable  
through all the ftates.  
  
The patronage of our commerce,  
of our merchants and feamen, has  
called for the appoint: nent of con-  
fuls in foreign countries. It feems  
expedient to regulate by law the  
exercife of that jurifdi@ien and thofe  
functions which are permitted them,  
either by expres convention, or by  
9 triendly indulgence in the pi. Ices  
of their refidence. The confular  
convention too with his moft Chrif-

cafes, the aid of the national autho-

fures, of the pott office and pott-roads, are fubjeéts which (I prefume) you will  
refume of courfe, and which ave abundantly urged by their own importance,  
  
Gentlemen of the boufe of reprefentatives,  
  
THE ‘uficiency of the revenues you have ettablifhed, for the obje&amp;ts to which  
they ave appropriated, leaves no doubt, that the refiduary provilions will be com-  
menfurate to the other objects, for which the public faith ftands now pledged,  
Allow me, moreover, to hope, that it will be a favourite policy with you, not  
inerely to fecure a payment of the intereft of the debt funded, but as far, and as  
fait, as the growing refources of the country will permit, to exonerate it of the  
principal it(lf. The appropriation you have made cf the weltern lands, ex-  
piains your difpofitions on this fubjet : and J am perfuaded the fooner that va-  
Juable fund can be made to contribute, along with other means, te the actual  
reduction of the public debt, the more falutary will the meafure be, to every  
public intereft, as well as the more fatisfaétory to our conftituents.  
  
Gentlemen of the fenate, and boufe of representatives,  
  
IN puriuing the various and weighty bufinefs of the prefent feflion, I indulge  
the fulleft perfuafion, that your confultations will be equally ma:ked with wal-  
cem, and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my  
duty, you fall have all the co-operation which an undiminifhed zeal for its wel-  
fare can infpire. It wili be happy tor us beth, and our beft reward, if by a  
jucceistul admuutiration of our refpe&amp;tive trufts, we can make the eltablithed  
government more and more inftrumental in promoting the good of our felow-  
citivens, and more and more the objeSt of their attachment and confidence.

Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
and Houfe of Reprejentatives,  
  
ty mecting you again, 1 fee) much fatis-  
faction, in being able to repeat my con-  
gratulations on the favourable profpeéts  
which continue to diftinguifh our publick  
affairs. The abundant freits of another  
year have bieffed our country with plenty,  
and with the means of a flourifhing com.  
merce. The progrefs of publick credit is  
witneffed by aconfiderable rife of American  
ftock abroad, as well as at home; and the  
revenues allotted for this and other national  
purpofes, have been produdtive beyond the  
calculations by which they were regulated.  
This latter circumétance is the more pleaf-  
ing as it is not only a proof of the fertility  
of our refources, tat as it aflures us of a  
further increafe of the national refpedta-  
bility and credit ; and let me add, as it bears  
an honourable teftimony to the patriotifm  
and integrity of the mercantile and marine  
part of our citizens. The punctuality of  
the former in difcharging their engagements,  
  
has been exemplary.  
In conforming to the powers vefted in me  
  
by the aéts of the laft feffion, a loan of  
  
4,000,000 of florins, towards which fome pro-  
vifional meafures had praemy taken place,  
has been completed tn Holland. As well  
the celerity with which it has been filled, as  
the nature of the terms (confidering the  
more than ordinary demand for borrowing,  
created by the fituation of Europe) give a  
reafonable hope that the further execution  
of thofe powers may proceed with advantage  
and fuccefs. The Secretary of the Trea-  
fury has my dire€tions to communicate fuch  
further particulars as may be requifite for  
more precife information.  
  
Sinc’ your laft feffions, 1 have réteived  
eommunications by which it appears, that  
the diftri€t of Kentucky, at prefent a part  
of Virginia, has concurred in certain pro-  
pofitions contained in a iaw of that ftate,  
in confequence of which the diftriét is to  
become a diftin€t member of the Union ;  
in cafe the requifite fanétion of congrefs be  
added. For this fanétion application is now  
made. 1 thal! caufe the — on this very  
important tranfaétion to be laid before you.  
The liberality and harmony with which it  
has been conduéted, will be found to do  
great honour to both the parties ; and the  
fentiments of warm attachment to the U-  
nion and its prefent Government, exprefled  
by our fellow citizens of Kentucky, cannot  
fail to add an affe€tionate concern for their  
particular welfare, to the great national im-  
prefitons under which you wiil decide on the  
cule fubmitted to you.

Ithas been heretofore known to Congrefs,  
that frequent incurfions have been made on  
our frontier fettiements by a certain bandit-  
ti of Indians, from the northweft Gide of the  
Ohio. Thefe, with fome of the tribes  
dwelling on and near the Wabath, have of  
late been particularly active in their depre-  
dations; and, being emboldened by the  
impunity of their crimes, and aided by fuch  
parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be  
feduced to join in their hoftilities, or afford  
them a retreat for their prifoners and plun-  
der, they have, inftead of liftening to the  
humane invitations and overtures made on  
the part of the United States, renewed their  
violences with freth alacrity and greater ef-  
feét. The lives ofa number of valuable  
citizens have thus been facrificed, and fome  
of them under circumftances peculiarly  
fhocking, whilft others have becn carried  
into a deplorable captivity.  
  
Thefe aggravated provocations rendered  
it effential to the fafety of the weftern fet-  
tlement, that the aggreffors fhould be made  
fenfible that the government of the Union  
is not lefs capable of punifhing their crimes,  
than it is difpofed to refpect their rights  
and reward their attachments. As this obs  
jet could not be effected by defenfive mea-  
tures, it became neceflary to put in force  
the at which empowers the PreGdent to  
call out the militia for the prot-€tion of the  
frontiers : And I have accordingly author-  
ifed an expedition, in which the regular  
troops in that quarter are combined with  
fuch drafts of militia as were deemed fuf-  
ficient. The event of the meafure is yet un-  
known to me. The Secretary at War is  
direéted to lay before you a ftatement of the  
information on which it is founded, as  
well as an eftimate of the expenfe with  
which it will be attended.  
  
The difturbed fituation of Europe, and  
particularly the critical pofture of the great  
maritime powers, whilft it ought to make  
us more thankful for the general peace and  
fecurity enjoyed by the United States, re-  
minds us at the fame time of the circum-  
fpeétion with which it becomes us to pre-  
Seve thefe bleflings. It requires alfo that  
we fhould not overlook the tendency of a  
war, and even of preparations for a war a-  
mong the nations mof concerned in active  
cemmerce with this country, to abridye the  
means, and thereby at leaft enhance the  
price of tranfporting its valuable produc-  
tions to their proper markets. J] recommend  
it to your ferious reflections, how far, and  
in whag mode, it may beexpedient to guard  
againft embarrafiments from chefe contin.  
gencies, by fuch encouragements to ovr own  
navigation as will render our commerce and  
agriculture lefs dependant on foreign bor.  
toms, which may fail ve iw the very mo-  
  
ment  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ment mott interefting to both of thefé great  
objects. Our fitheries, and the tranfporta-  
tion of our own produce, offer us abundant  
means ior guarding ourfelyes againft this  
evil.  
  
Your attention feems to be not lefs due  
to that particular branch of our trade which  
belongs to the Mediterranean. So many  
circumftances unite in rendering the prefent  
ftate of it diftrefsful to us, that you will not  
think any deliberations mifemployed which  
may lead to its relief and protection,  
  
The laws you have already paffed for the  
efablithment of a Judiciary Syftem, have  
opened the doors of juftice to all defcrip-  
tions of perfons. You will confider in your  
wifdom, whether improvements in that  
fyftem may yet be made ; and particularly  
whether an uniform procefs of execution  
on fentences iffuing from the Federal  
Courts, be mot defirable through al! the  
tates.  
  
The patronage of our commerce, of our  
Merchants and feamen, has called for the  
appointment of Confuls in foreign countries.  
It feems expedient to regulate by law the  
exercife of that jurifdi€tion and thofe func-  
tions which are permitted them, either by  
exprefs convention, or by a friendly indul -  
oe im the places of their refidence. The  
  
onfular Convention too, with his Moft  
Chriftian Majeity, has ftipulated in certaia  
cafes, the aid of the national authority to  
his Confuls eftablithed here.—Some legif-  
tative provifion is requifite, to carry thefe  
Ripulations into full effect.  
  
The eftablithment of the militiamof a  
mint—of ftandards of weights and mea-  
furesof the pott office and poft roads, are  
fubjeéts which (1 prefume) you will refume  
of courfe, and which are abundantly urged  
by their own importance.  
  
Gentlemen of the Honje of Reprefentatives,  
  
The futhiciency of the revenues you have  
eftablifhed, for the objects to which they  
are appropriated, leaves no doubt, that the  
refiduary provifions will be commenfurate  
to the other objects, for which the.publick  
faith ftands now pledged. Allow me more-  
over to hope, that it wiil be a favourite pol-  
icy with you, not merely to fecure a pay-  
ment of the intereft of the debt funded, but  
as far, and as fatt, as the growing refources  
ofthe country will permit, to exonerate it  
of the principal itfelf.—T he appropriation  
you have made of the Weftern lands ex-  
= your difpofition on this fubjet: And  
  
am pecfuaded, that, the fooner that valu.  
able fund can be made to contribute, along  
with other means, to the actual reduCtion  
of the publick debt, the more falutary will  
the meafure be to every publick interett,  
as well as the more fatisfa@tory to our Con-  
ftituents.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate,  
  
and Houje of Reprejcntatives,  
  
In purfuing the various and weighty bu-  
finets of the prefent feffion, I indulge the  
fullett perfuafien, that your confultations

will be equally marked with wifdom, and  
animated by the love of your ceuntry. In  
whatever, belongs to my duty, you hall  
have ali the cooperation which an undimin-  
ifhed zeal for its welfare can inipire. It  
will be happy for us both, and our beft re-  
ward, if, by a fuccefsful adminiftration of  
our refpective trufts, we can make the ef-  
tablithed government more and more inftru-  
mental in promoting the good of our fellow  
citizens, and more and more the object of  
their attachment and confidence.

United States, in the following words :  
  
Fellow-Gitizens of the Senate,  
and Houfe of Reprefentatives.  
IN meeting you again, | feel much fa-  
tisfaction in being able to repeat my con-

which continue to diftinguifh our public  
affaits.—The abundant fruits of another

Union is not lefs capable of punifhing their  
crimes, than it is difpofed to refpe&amp; their  
rights, and reward their attachments. As  
this object could not he effected by defen-  
five meafures, it became neceffary to pat  
in force the a@, which empowers the Pre-  
fident to call out the militia, for the pro-  
tection of the frontiers. And I have ac-  
cordingly authorifed an expedition, in  
which the regular troops, in that quarter,  
are combined with fuch draughts of mi-  
litia as were deemed fufficient. The e-  
vent of the meafure is yet unknown to

mation on which it is founded, as well as  
an eftimate of the expence with which it

The dilturbed fituation of Europe, and  
particularly the critica pottute of the  
great maritime powers, whilit it ought to  
make us more thankful for the general  
peace and fecurity enjoyed by the United  
States, reminds us, at the fametime, of the  
circum{pedtion with which it becomes us  
to preferve thefe bicilings It requires  
alfo that we fhould not overlook the ten-  
dency of a war, and even of preparations  
for war, among the nations moft con-  
cerned in active commerce with this coun-,  
try, to abridge the means, and thereby, at  
leaft, enhance the price of tran{porting its  
valuable productions to their proper  
markets. I recommend it to your feri-  
ous reficctions, how far, and in what  
mode, it may be expedient to guard a-  
gainft embarrafiments from thefe contin-  
gencies, by fuch encouragements to our

merce and agriculture lefs dependent on  
foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the

thefe great objects. Our fitheries and the  
tranfportation of our produce, offer us a-  
bundant means for guarding ourfelves a-  
gaint this evil.  
  
Your attention feems to be not lefs due

Federal Courts, be not defirable through

The patronage of our commerce,of our

appointment of Confuls in foreign coun-

law the exercife of that jurifdiction, and  
thofe functions which are permitted them,  
cither by exprefs convention, or by friend-  
ly indulgence, in the places of their refi-  
dence The Confular Convention too,  
with his Moft Chrittian Majefty, has fti-  
pulated in certain cafes, the aid of the na-  
tienal authority to his Confuls eftablifhed  
here.—-ome legiflative provifions ate  
requifite, to carry thefe ftipulations into  
tull effect.  
  
The eftablitfhment of the militia—of a  
mint—of ftandards of weights and mea-  
fures—of the Poft-Office and poft-roads,  
are fubjects, which (1 prefume) you will  
refume of courfe, and which are abun-  
dantly urged by their own importance.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives.  
  
The fofficiency of the reventves you  
have eftablifhed, for the objects to which  
they arg apprépriated, leaves no doubt,  
that the refiduary provifions will be com-  
menfurate to the other objets, for which  
the public faith ftands now pledged. Al-  
low me morcover to hope, that it will be  
a favourable policy with you, not mere-  
ly to fecure a payment of the intereft of  
the debtfunded, but, as far and as faft a4  
the growing refources of the country will  
permit, to exonerate it of the principal  
itfelf.—The appropriation you have made  
of the weftern lands eXplains your difpe-  
fitions on this fubject : and I am perfuad-  
ed, that, the fooner that valiable fund  
can be made to contribute, along with o-  
ther means, tothe actual redu“tion of the  
public debt, the more falutary will the  
meafure beto every public intereft, as well  
as the more fatisfactory to our Conftitu-  
ents.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate,  
and Houfe of Reprefentatices,  
  
in purfuing the various and weighty  
bufinefs of the prefent feflion, I indulge  
the fulieft perfuafion, that your confulta-

ty, you fhall have all the co-operation  
which an undiminifhed zeal for its wel-  
fare can infpire. It will be happy for us  
beth, and our bet reward, if, by a fuc-

cefsful adminiftration of our refpective

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and  
  
House of Representatives,  
  
xN meeting you again I feel much fatisfa&amp;ion in being able  
to repeat my congratulations on the favorable profpefts which  
continue to dillinguifh our public affairs.—The abundant fruits of  
another year have blefled our country with plenty, and with the  
means of a flourifhing commerce—The progress of public credit  
is witnessed by a confide rable rife of American Stock abroad as  
well as at home—And the revenues allotted for this and other na­  
tional purposes, have been produttive beyond the calculations by  
which they were regulated—This latter circumstance ts the more  
pleasing, as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources,  
but as it allures us of a further increase of the national refpeftabi­  
lity and credit ; and let me add, as it bears an honorable tefti­  
roony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine  
part of the citizens—The pun&amp;uality of the former in discharging  
  
their engagements has been exemplary  
  
In conform ing to the powers vested in me by the a£ts of the  
lad feflion, a loan of three millions of florins, towards which some  
provisional measures had pievioufly taken place, has been com­  
pleted in Holland, as well the celerity with which it has been  
filled, as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordi­  
nary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe)  
give a reasonable hope, that the further execution of those powers  
may proceed with advantage and success. The Secretary of the  
Treasury, has my direction to communicate such further parti­  
culars as may be rcquifite for more precise information.  
  
Since your last fcilions, I have received communications, by  
which it appears, that the diftrift of Kentucky, at present a part  
of Virginia, has concurred in certain proportions contained in a  
Jaw of th at State ; in conCequence of which the diftrift is to be­  
come a diftinft member of the union, in cafe the requisite fan£lion  
of Congress be added—For this fanflion application &quot;Is now made  
—I shall cause the papers on this Very impoitant tranfaftion to be  
laid before you.—The liberality and harmony with which it has  
been condutted, will be found to do great honor to. both the par­  
ties ; and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its  
present government, expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucky,  
cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular wel­  
fare, to the great national impreflions under which you will de­  
cide on the cafe submitted to you.  
  
It has been heretofore known to Congress, that frequent incur­  
sions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain ban­  
ditti of Indians, from the northwest fide of the Ohio: I hefe,  
with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabafh, have of  
late been particularly active in their depredations ; and being  
emboldened by the impunity of theif crimes, and aided by such  
parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in  
their hostilities, or afford them a retreat for their priloners and  
plunder, they have, instead ©f listening to the humane invitations  
and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed their  
violences with frefti alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a  
number of valuable citizens have thus been facrificed, and some  
of th«m under circumllances peculiarly (hocking, whilst otheis  
have been carried into a deplorable captivity.  
  
These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the fafety  
of the Wettein Settlements, that the aggressors ihould b&lt;* made  
sensible, that the government of the union is not less capable ol  
punifliing their crimes, than it is disposed to refpett their rights,  
and reward their attachments. As this objett could not be effect­  
ed by deienfive measures, it became necefTary to put in force the  
ast, which empowers the President to call out the militia for the  
protedion of the Frontiers. And I have accordingly authonfed  
an expedition, in which the regular troops in that quarter are  
combined with such draughts of militia as were deemed   
The event of the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secietai)  
©f War is directed to lay before you a statement of the informa­  
tion on which it isfounded, as well as an estimate of the expcnce  
with which it will be attended.  
  
The disturbed lituation of Europe, and particularly the ciitical  
posture of the great maritime powers, whilftit ought to make us  
more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the  
United States, reminds us, at the fame time of the circumspec­  
tion with which it becomes us to preserve these bleflings. It re­  
quires also that we should not overlook the tendency ot a war,  
and even of preparations for war among the nations molt, cori  
ecrned in a&amp;ive commerce with this country, to aDiidg- t ie  
means, and thereby at least enhance the price of tranfportmg its  
valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it  
t® your serious reilc£hor»s how far, and in what mode, it mar b  
  
expedient to guard againil embarrafTments from these contingen.  
  
Ie«, by fuel) encouragements to our own navigation as will ren-  
  
der Qur commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bot­  
toms, which may fail us in the very moment most interesting to  
both of thefs great objetts. Our fifheries, and the transportation  
of our own produce, offer us abundant means for guarding our-  
  
Iclves against this evil.  
  
Your altcntion seems to be not less due to that particular branch  
  
of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many cir­  
cumstances unite in rendering the present state of it dillrefsful to  
us, that you will not think any deliberations mifcmployed which  
may lead to its relief and prote&amp;ion.  
  
The laws you have already passed for the eftablilhment of a Ju­  
diciary system, have opened the doors of justice to all defcrip-  
  
ions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom, whether  
  
&#x27;mprovements in that system may yet be made ; and particularly  
whether an uniform process of execution on (entences issuing from  
the Federal Courts, be not desirable through all the States.  
  
The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and feamcn,  
has called tor the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It  
&lt;ems expedient to regulate by law the cxercife of that junfdic-  
  
ion, and those functions which are permitted them, either by  
  
express convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of  
  
ieir residence. The Consular Convention too, with his Most  
  
Christian Majcfty, has stipulated in certaio cases, the aid of the  
national authority to his Consuls eftabli(bed here.—Somelegifla-  
  
ive provision is requisite, to carry these flipulations into full effe£b  
  
The establishment of themilitia—of a mint—of standards of  
weights and measures—os the poft-office and post-roads, are fub­  
je£ts, which (I presume) you wi 11 resume of course. and which  
are abundantly urged bv their own importance.  
  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
  
THE fufficiency of the revenues you have established for the  
objects to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the  
refiduaiy provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for  
which the public faith Hands now pledged. Allow me more­  
over to hope that it will be a favorite policy with you not mere-  
  
to secure a payment of the interest of the debt funded, but as  
  
far, and as fact as the growing resources of the country will per­  
mit, to exonerate it of the principal itfelf. The appropriation  
youhave made of the Western Lands, explains your dispositions  
on this fubjeft, and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund  
can be made, to contribute along with other means, to the actual  
reduction of the public debt, the more salutary will the measure  
be to every Public as well as the more fatisfaftory to our  
  
conftitu^nts.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
  
House of Representatives,  
  
IN pursuing the various and weighty bufincfs of the present  
feflion, I indulge the fulleft pcrfuafion that your confutations will  
be equally marked with wisdom, and animated by the love ot  
your country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you (hall have  
all the co-operation which an undiminifhed zeal for its welfare  
can inlpire. It will be happy for vis both, and our best reward,  
if by a fuccefsful administration of our refpcftive trusts, we can  
make the eftablithed government more and more instrumental in  
promoting the good of our fellow citizcns, and more and more  
theobjcft of their attachment and confidence.

Fervow CrrizeEnsof the SENATE and  
~ Houseof REPRESENTATIVES,  
N meeting you again, I feel much  
I fatisfaltion, in being able to repeat  
my congratulations on the favourable  
profpeéts which continue to distinguish  
our public affairs. The abundant fruits  
of another year have blefled our coun­  
try with plenty, and with the means of  
a flourithing commerce.—The progress  
of public credit is witnefled by a consi­  
derable rife of American stock abroad,  
as well as at home ; and the revenues  
allotted for this and other national pur­  
poses, have been prod uétive beyond the  
calculations by which they were regu­  
lated. This latter circumstance is the  
more pleasing, as it is not only a proof  
of the fertility of our resources, but as  
it aflures us of a further increase of the  
national respectability and credit ; and  
let me add, as it bears an honorable  
  
teftimeny to the patriotism znd integ:  
rity of the mercantile and marine part  
of our citizens.. ‘lhe punétuality of  
the former in discharging tl.eir engage­  
ments, has been cxemplary,  
In conforming to the povers vested  
inine by the aéts of the iai fcffion aloan  
of 3,000,000 of florins, towards which  
some provisional meatures had previoufs  
ly taken place, has been completed in  
Holland. As well the ceieiity with  
which it has been filled as the nature  
of the terms (considering the more than  
ordinary demand tor borrowing, creat­  
ed by the situation, of Europe) give a  
reasonable hope, that the furtier exe­  
cution of those powers may procecd  
with advantage and success. ~ The Se­  
cretary of the Treasury has my direc­  
tions to communicat: such furiher par­  
ticulars as may be requisite for more  
precise information.  
Since your last feflions, I have receiy­  
ed communications by which it appears  
that the district of Kentucke, at piefeut  
a part of Virginia, has concurred in cer­  
tain propositions conrained in a law of  
that state, in consequence of which the  
diftri€t is to become a ¢.flinét member  
of the union ; in case the requisite sanc­  
tion of Congrels be added. For this  
fanftion application is now made. I  
shall cause the papers on this very im­  
portant transaction to be laid before  
you. The liberality and harmony with  
which it has been conduéted, will be  
found to do great honor to both the par­  
ties ; and the sentiments of warm at­  
tachment to the Union and its prefeat  
governmeit, expiefied by our fellow  
citizens of Kentucke, cannot fail to add  
an affect&#x27;onate concern for their parti­  
cular welfare, to the great naiional im­  
pressions under which you will decide on  
the case fubmiited to you.  
It has been heretofore known to Con­  
gress, that frequent incursions have  
been made on our trontier settlements  
by certain banditti of Indians, from the  
north weft fide of the Ohio. Thele,  
with some of the tribes dwelling on and  
aear the Wabath, have of late been parti­  
chlar]y aftive in their depredations ;  
and, being emboldened by tue impunity  
of their crunes, and aided by such parts  
of the neighbouring tribes as could be  
seduced to join in their hostilities oraf­  
ford them retreat for their prisoners &amp;  
plunder, they have, instead of liitening  
to the humane invitations and over­  
tures made on the part of the United  
States, renewed their violences with  
trefh alacrity and greater effe®. ‘The  
lives of a number of valuable citizens  
have thus been facrificed, and some of  
them under circamfances particularly  
shocking, whillt others have been car­  
ried inte a deploruble captivity.  
Thele aggravated provocations ren­  
dered it efiential to the fafety of the  
western settlements, that the aggrefiors  
should be made feifible that the gov­  
ernment of the union, is not less capa­  
ble of punishing their crimes, than itis  
disposed to refpe&amp; their rights and re­  
ward their attachments. As this obje&amp;  
could not be effected by defenfive mea­  
sures, it became neceflary to put in  
force the a&amp; which empowers Tue  
PresipenT to call out the militia for  
the protetion of the {ront&#x27;ers : And I  
have accordingly authorized an expedi­  
tion, in which the regular troops in  
that quarter are comb...ed with such  
drafts of militia as were deemed fuffici­  
ent. The event of the measure is yet  
unknown to me., The Secretary at  
War is dire&amp;ted to lay before yocu a  
statement of the informatiun on which  
it is founded, as well as an (ftimate of  
the expence with which it will be at­  
tended.  
The disturbed situation of Europe,  
&amp; particularly the critical posture of the  
great maritime powers,whilftit ought to  
make us more thankful for the general  
peace and security enjoyed by the Uni­  
ted States, reminds us at the fame time  
of the circumfpe@ion with which it  
becomes us to preserve these bleilings.  
It requires also that we should not o­  
verlook the tendency of a war, and c­  
ven of preparations for a war among  
the nations most concerned in aéive  
commerce with this country, to abridge  
the means, and thereby at least enhance

December 8, 1790.  
  
© Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and  
Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
J N meeting you again, I feel much fa-  
  
tisfaétion in being able to repeat my  
congratulations on the favourable prof-  
pects which continue to diftinguifh our  
public affairs. The abundant fruits of  
another year have bleffed our country with  
plenty, and with the means of flourifhing  
commerce. The progrefs of public cre-  
dit is witnefled by a confiderable rife of  
American ftock abroad, as well as at  
home; and the revenues allotted for this  
  
and other national purpofes, have been -  
  
roduétive beyond the calculation by which  
they were regulated. This latter circum-  
fiance is the more pleafing, as it is’ not  
only a proof of the fertility of our refources,  
but as it affures us of a further increafe of  
the national refpectability and credit ; and  
let me add, as it bears an honourable tef-  
timony to the patriotifm and integrity of  
the marine part of our citizens. The  
punctuality of the former in difcharging  
their engagements, has been exemplary.  
  
‘ In conforming to the powers vefted in  
me by aéts of the laft feffion, a loan of  
4,000,000 of florins, towards which fome  
provilional meafures had previoufly taken  
place, has been completed in Holland. As  
well the celerity with which it has been  
filled, as the nature of the terms (confider-  
ing the more than ordinary demand for  
borrowing, created by the fituation of  
Europe) give a reafonable hope that the  
further execution of thofe powers may  
proceed with advantage and fuccefs. The  
fecretary of the treafury has my directions  
to communicate fuch further particulars as  
may be requifite for more precife informa-  
tion.  
  
‘Since your laft fiffions, I have re-  
ceived communication, by which it ap-  
pears, that the diftrict of Kentucky, at  
prefent a part of Virginia, has concurred  
In certain propofitions contained in a law  
of that ftate, in confequence of which the  
ditri&amp; is to become a diftinét member of  
the union ; in cafe the requisite fanction  
of congreis be added. For this fanGion  
application is now made. I fhall caufe  
the papers on this very important tran{ac-  
tion to be laid before you. ‘Lhe hiberal ry  
aad harmony with which it has been cone  
  
du&amp;ted, will be found to do great honour  
to both the parties ; and the {fentiments of  
warm attachment to the union and its pre-  
fent government, exprefled by our fellow.  
citizens of Kentucky, cannot fail to add  
an affectionate concern for their particular  
welfare, to the great national impreffions  
under which you will decide on the cafe  
fubmitted to you.  
  
© It has been heretofore known to con«  
grefs, that frequent incurfions have been  
made on our frontier fettlements by cer-  
tain banditti of Indians, from the north-  
weft fide of the Ohio. Thefe, with fome  
of the tribes dwelling on-and near the  
Wabafh, have of late been particularly  
aétive in their depredations ; and, being  
emboldened by the impunity of their crimes,  
and aided by fuch part of the neighbour=  
ing tribes as could be feduced to join ir  
their hoftilities, or afford them a retreat  
for their prifoners and plunder, they have,  
inftead a liftening to the humane invita-  
tions and overtures made on the part of  
the United States, renewed their violence  
with frefh alacrity and greater effect. ‘The  
lives of a number of valuable citizens have  
thus been facrificed, and fome of theng  
under circumftances peculiarly fhocking,  
whilft others have been carried into a de-  
plorable captivity.  
  
‘ Thefe aggravated provocations ren=  
dered it effential to the fafety of the weit-  
ern fettlements, that the aggreffors thould  
be made fenfible that the government of  
the Union is not lefs capable of punifhing  
their crimes, than it is difpofed to refpett  
their rights and reward their attachments.  
As this obje&amp; could not be effe&amp;ted by  
defenfive meafures, it became neceflary ta  
put in force the a&amp; which empowers the  
prefident to call out the militia for the pro-  
tection ef the frontiers: and I have ac-  
cordingly authorifed an expedition, in  
which the regular troops in that quarter  
are combined with fuch drafts of militia  
as were deemed fuflicient. The event of  
the meafure is yet unknowntome. The  
fecretary at war is dire€ted to lay before  
you a ftatement of the information on  
which it is founded, as well as an eftimate  
of the expence with which it will be ate  
tended.  
  
‘ The difturbed fituation of Europe,  
and particularly dhe critical pofture of the  
  
Iz great  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
68  
  
great maritime powers, while it cught to  
make us more thankful for the general  
peace and fecurity enjoyed by the United  
States, reminds us at the fame time of the  
circumfpection with which it becomes us  
to preferve thefe bleflings. It requires  
alfo that we fhould not overlook the ten-  
dency of a war, and even of preparations  
for a war among the nations moft con-  
éerned m attive commerce with this coun-  
try, to abridge the means, and thereby  
at leaft enhance the price of tran{porting  
its valuable productions to their proper  
markets. I recommend it to your ferious  
rcfle&amp;ticns, how far and in what mode it  
may be expedient to guard againft embar-  
rafiments from thefe contingencies, by fuch  
encouragements to our own navigation as  
will render our commerce and agriculture  
fefs dependant on foreign bottoms, which  
may fail us in the very moments moft in-  
terefting to both thefe great objects. Our  
fifheries and the tran{portation of our own  
produce, offer us abundant means for  
guarding ourfelves againft this evil.  
  
¢ Your attention feems to be not lefS  
due to that particular branch of our trade  
which belongs to the hi:diterranean. So  
many circumftances unite in rendering the  
  
refent ftate of it diftrefsful to us, that  
vou will not think any deliberations mif-  
apleyes which may lead to its relief and  
protection.  
  
* The laws you have already paffed for  
the eftablifhment of a judiciary fyftem,  
fave opened the doors of juftice to all def-  
criptions of perfons. You will confider  
in your wifdom, whether improvements  
in that fyitem may yet be made, and par-  
ticularly whether an uniform proceis of  
execution on fentences ifuing from the  
federal courts, be not defirable through  
all the States.  
  
‘ The patronage cf our commerce, of  
our merchants and-feamen, has called for  
the appointment of confuls in foreign coun-  
tries. It fcems expedient to regulate by  
law, the exercife of that juritdigtion and  
thofe fun&amp;tions which are pernrtted them,  
either by exprefs convention, or by a  
friendly indulgence in the places of their  
refidence. The confular convention too,  
with his moft chriftian majeily, has itipu-  
lated, in certain cates, the aid of the na-

tional authority to his confuls e@ablifhed  
here. Some leyiflative provifion is requi-  
fite to carry thefe ilipulations in full effect.  
© The eitablithment of the militia, of a  
mint, of ftandards of weights and mea-  
fures, of the poft-office and poft-roads,  
are fubje&amp;ts which, I prefume, you will  
refume of courfe, and which are abun-  
dantly urged by their own importance.  
  
* Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefen-  
tatives,  
  
The fufficiency of the revenues you  
have eftabliihed for the objects to which  
they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that  
the refiduary provifions will be commen-  
furate to the other obje&amp;s for which the  
public faith ftands now pledged. Allow  
me moreover to hope, that it will bea fa-  
vourite policy with you, not merely to  
fecure a payment of the intereft of the debt  
funded, but as far and as faft as-the grow  
ing refources of the country will permit,  
to exonerate it of the principal itfelf. The  
appropriation you have made of the weftern  
lands explain your difpofitions on this fub-  
je€t, and I am perfuaded the fooner that  
valuable fund can be made to contribute,  
along with other means, to the actual re-  
duétion of the public debt, the more fa-  
lutary will the meafure be to every public  
intereft, as well as be more fatisfactory to  
our conftituents.  
  
* Gentlemen of the Senate, and Houfe  
of Reprcientatives,  
  
In perufing the various and weighty  
bufine!s of the prefent feffion,. I indulge  
the fulleft perfuafion that your confulta-  
tions will be equally marked with wifdom,  
and animated by the love of your country.  
In whatever belongs to my dnty, yow  
fhall have the co-operation which an un-  
diminifhed zeal for its welfare can in-  
fpire. It will be happy for us both, and  
our bet reward, if [ a fuccefstul ad-  
miniftration of cur refpeétive truits, we  
can make the eftablifhed government more  
and more inftrumental in promoting the  
good of our fellow-citizens, and more and  
more the obje&amp;t of their attachment and  
eonfidence. Signed)

the more than ordinary demand  
for.borrowing, created by the ftu-  
ation of Europe) give a reafonable  
hope that the further execution of  
thofe powers may proceed with ad-  
vantage and fucccfs. The Sccre-  
tary of the Treafury has my di-  
rections to communicate fuch fur-  
ther particulars as may be requilite  
for more precife information.  
  
** Since your laft feffions, I have  
received communication, by which  
it appears, that the Diitri€t of Ken-  
tucke, at prefent a part of Virginia,  
has concurred in certain propoti-  
tions contained in a law of that  
State, in confequence of which the  
diftriG is to become a diftinét Mem-  
ber of the Union: in cafe the re-  
quifite fanétion of Congrefs be  
added. For this fanftion applica-  
tion is now made. I fhall caife  
the papers on this very important  
tranfattion to be laid loti: you:  
the liberality and harmony with  
which it has been conduéted, will  
be found to do great honour to  
both the parties ; and the fentiment  
of warm attachment to the Union  
and its prefent Government, ex-  
  
refed by our fellow-citizens of  
Reseba, cannot fail to add an  
affe&amp;tionate concern for their par-  
ticular welfare, to the great na-  
tional impreffions under which you  
will decide % the cafe fubmitted  
to you.  
  
* It has been heretofore known  
to Congrefs, that frequent incurfi-  
ons have been made on our fron-  
tier fettlements by certain banditti  
of Indians from the north-weft fide  
of the Ohio. Thefe, with fome  
@ the tribes dwelling on and near  
the Wabafh, have of late been  
particularly aétive in their depre-  
dations ; and being emboldened by  
the impunity ef their crimes, and  
aided by fuch parts of the neigh-  
bouring tribes as could be feduced  
to join in their holtilities, or afford  
them a retreat for their prifoners  
and plunder, they have—in{tead  
  
  
  
1791. an  
  
of liftening to the humane invita-  
tions and overtures made on the  
part of the United States—renewed  
their violence with frefh alacrity  
and greater effect, The lives of  
a number of valuable citizens have  
thus been facrificed, and fome of  
them under circumftances peculiar-  
ly fhocking, whilft others have  
been carried into a deplorable  
captivity.  
  
“ Thefe aggravated provocations  
rendered it eifential to the fafety  
of the weftern fettlements, that the  
aggreflors fhould be made fenfible  
that the government of the Union  
is not leis capable of punifhing  
their crimes, than it is difpofed to  
reipeét their rights and reward their  
attachments. As this obje&amp; could  
not be effeéted by defenfive mea-  
fures, it became neceflary to put in  
force the att which empowers the  
Prefident to call out the militia for  
the proteétion of the frontiers: and  
I have accordingly authorized an  
expedition, in which the regular  
troops in that quarter are combined  
with fuch drafts of militia as were  
deemed fuficient, The event of  
the meafure is yet unknown to me.  
The Secretary at War is dire&amp;ted to  
lay before you a ftatement of the  
information on which it is found-  
ed, as well as an ecftimate of the  
expences with which it will be at-  
tended.  
  
“ The difturbed fituation of Eu-  
rope, and particularly the critical  
pofture of the great maritime  
powers, whilit it ought to make  
us more thankful for the general  
sem aud fecurity enjoyed by the  
  
nited States, remind us at the  
fame time of the circumfpeétion  
with which it becomes us to pre-  
ferve thofe bleflings. It requires  
  
alfo that we fhould not overlook  
the tendency of a war, and even  
of preparation for a war among the

revenues allotted for this and other national pur.­

circumstance is the more pleasing, as it is not

us it assures us of a future increase of the national  
respectability and credit; and let me add, as it  
bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism  
and integrity of the mercantile and marine part  
of our citizens. The punctuality of the former  
in discharging their engagements has been ex.­  
emplary. The sufficiency of the revenues you  
have established for the objects to which they are  
appropriated, leaves no doubt that the residuary  
provisions will be commensurate to the other ob.
