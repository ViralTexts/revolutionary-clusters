Kind Reader,  
By way of preface (for custom says there must be a preface to every almanack) I present thee with an essay wrote by a celebrated naturalist of our country, which, if duly attended to, may be of more service to the publick, than 375 prefaces of my own writing: Take it as follows, viz. An Essay for the improvement of estates, by raising a durable timber for fencing, and other uses.  
By a diligent observation in our province, and several adjacent,

On the 18th of this month, anno 1546 died that famous reformer, Luther: who struck the great blow to papal tyranny in Europe. He was remarkably temperate in meat and drink, sometimes fasting four days together; and at other times, for many days eating only a little bread and a herring.

On the 7th of this month, 1626, died that great little man, Sir Francis Bacon; great in his prodigious genius, parts and learning; and little, in his servile compliances with a little court, and submissive flattery of a little prince. Pope characterises him thus, in one strong line;  
  
If Parts allure thee, think how Bacon shin’d,  
The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind.  
  
He is justly esteem’d the father of the modern experimental philosophy. And another poet treats him more favourably, ascribing his blemishes to a wrong unfortunate choice of his way of Life;  
  
———— Bacon, hapless in his choice,  
Unfit to stand the civil storm of state,  
And thro’ the smooth barbarity of courts,  
With firm, but pliant virtue, forward still  
To urge his course. Him for the studious shade  
Kind nature form’d, deep, comprehensive, clear,  
Exact, and elegant; in one rich soul,  
Plato, the Stagyrite, and Tully join’d.  
The great deliverer he! who from the gloom  
Of cloister’d monks, and jargon-teaching schools,  
Led forth the true Philosophy, there long  
Held in the magic chain of words and forms,  
And definitions void: He led her forth,  
Daughter of Heav’n! that slow ascending still,  
Investigating sure the chain of things,  
With radiant finger points to Heav’n again.  
  
May. III Month.  
O, well begun, Virtue’s great Work pursue,  
Passions at first we may with Ease subdue;  
But if neglected, unrestrain’d too long,  
Prevailing in their Growth, by Habit strong,  
They’ve wrapp’d the Mind, have fix’d the stubborn Bent,  
And Force of Custom to wild Nature lent;  
  
Who then would set the crooked Tree aright,  
As soon may wash the tawny Indian white.  
  
If Passion drives, let Reason hold the Reins.  
  
Neither trust, nor contend, nor lay wagers, nor lend;  
And you’ll have peace to your Lives end.  
  
Drink does not drown Care, but waters it, and makes it grow faster.  
Who dainties love, shall Beggars prove.

y Supplies, and scanty in their Source,  
’Twixt Av’rice and Profusion steer thy Course.  
Av’rice is deaf to Want’s Heart-bursting Groan,  
Profusion makes the Beggar’s Rags thy own:  
Close Fraud and Wrong from griping Av’rice grow,  
From rash Profusion desp’rate Acts and Woe.  
  
A Man has no more Goods than he gets Good by.  
Welcome, Mischief, if thou comest alone.  
Different Sects like different clocks, may be all near the matter, tho’ they don’t quite agree.  
On the 15th of this month, anno 1215, was Magna Charta sign’d by King John, for declaring and establishing English Liberty.  
It was wise counsel given to a young man, Pitch upon that course of life which is most excellent, and Custom will make it the most delightful.

earful Fair,  
One not too stately for the Houshold Care,  
One form’d in Person and in Mind to please,  
To season Life, and all its Labours ease.

Having been poor is no shame, but being ashamed of it, is.  
On the 12th of this month, anno 1712, died Richard the son of Oliver Cromwell, aged 90 years. And on the 13th, anno 1713, was the treaty of Utrecht signed, ending a glorious war by an inglorious peace. The Preliminaries of the new Peace, are copied from those of the old one; ’tis to be hoped the Peace itself will be better.  
  
’Tis raging Noon, and, vertical, the Sun  
Darts on the Head direct his forceful rays.  
All-conqu’ring Heat, oh intermit thy wrath!  
And on my throbbing temples potent thus  
Beam not so fierce! Incessant still you flow,  
And still another fervent flood succeeds,  
Pour’d on the head profuse. In vain I sigh,  
And restless turn, and look around for night;  
Night is far off; and hotter hours approach.  
  
Thrice happy he! that on the sunless side  
Of a romantick mountain, forest-crown’d,  
Beneath the whole collected shade reclines:  
Or in the gelid caverns, woodbine-wrought,  
And fresh bedew’d with ever-spouting streams,  
Sits coolly calm; while all the world without  
Unsatisfy’d and sick, tosses in noon,  
Emblem instructive of the virtuous man,  
Who keeps his temper’d mind serene and pure,  
And every Passion aptly harmoniz’d,  
Amid a jarring world, with vice enflam’d.

Newton, the heat of the sun is seven times as great as it is with us; and would make our Water boil away. For the same person found by experiments, that an heat seven times as great as the heat of the sun in summer, is sufficient to set water a boiling.  
In the machine at Derby in England for winding Italian silk, there are 26,586 wheels, 97,746 movements; 73,728 yards of silk wound every time the water-wheel goes round, which is three times every minute; 318,504,960 yards of silk in one day and night; and consequently 99,373,547,550 yards of silk in a year. One water-wheel communicates motion to all the rest of the wheels and movements, of which any one may be stopped separately, and independent of the rest. One fire-engine conveys air to every individual part of the machine, and one regulator governs the whole work.

In Season grave, in Season, too, jocose.

Abhor to wound, be fervent to defend.  
Aspiring still to know, a Babbler scorn,  
But watch where Wisdom opes her golden Horn.  
  
9 Men in 10 are suicides.  
Doing an Injury puts you below your Enemy; Revenging one makes you but even with him; Forgiving it sets you above him.

born the great Sir Isaac Newton, prince of the modern astronomers and philosophers. But what is all our little boasted knowledge, compar’d with that of the angels? If they see our actions, and are acquainted with our affairs, our whole body of science must appear to them as little better than ignorance; and the common herd of our learned men, scarce worth their notice. Now and then one of our very great philosophers, an Aristotle, or a Newton, may, perhaps, by his most refined speculations, afford them a little entertainment, as it seems a mimicking of their own sublime amusements. Hence Pope says of the latter,  
  
Superior beings, when of late they saw  
A mortal man unfold all nature’s law,  
Admir’d such wisdom in a human shape,  
And shew’d a Newton, as we shew an ape.  
  
  
On Winter.  
  
’Tis done! dread Winter spreads his latest glooms,  
And reigns tremendous o’er the conquer’d year!  
How dead the vegetable kingdon lies!  
How dumb the tuneful! Horror wide extends  
His melancholy empire. Here fond man!  
Behold thy pictur’d life! pass some few years,  
Thy flowering Spring, thy Summer’s ardent strength,  
Thy sober Autumn fading into age,  
And pale concluding Winter comes at last,  
And shuts the scene. Ah! whither now are fled  
Those dreams of greatness? Those unsolid hopes  
Of happiness? Those longings after fame?  
Those restless cares? those busy bustling days?  
Those gay-spent festive nights? those veering thoughts,  
Lost between good and ill, that shar’d thy life?  
All now are vanish’d! Virtue sole survives,  
Immortal, never-failing friend of man,  
His guide to happiness on high. Thompson.  
  
How to get Riches.  
The Art of getting Riches consists very much in Thrift. All Men are not equally qualified for getting Money, but it is in the Power of every one alike to practise this Virtue.  
He that would be beforehand in the World, must be beforehand with his Business: It is not only ill Management, but discovers a slothful Disposition, to do that in the Afternoon, which should have been done in the Morning.  
Useful Attainments in your Minority will procure Riches in Maturity, of which Writing and Accounts are not the meanest.  
Learning, whether Speculative or Practical, is, in Popular or Mixt Governments, the Natural Source of Wealth and Honour.  
Precept I.  
  
In Things of moment, on thy self depend,  
Nor trust too far thy Servant or thy Friend:  
  
With private Views, thy Friend may promise fair,  
And Servants very seldom prove sincere.  
  
Precept II.  
  
What can be done, with Care perform to Day,  
Dangers unthought-of will attend Delay;  
Your distant Prospects all precarious are,  
And Fortune is as fickle as she’s fair.  
  
Precept III.  
  
Nor trivial Loss, nor trivial Gain despise;  
Molehills, if often heap’d, to Mountains rise:  
Weigh every small Expence, and nothing waste,  
Farthings long sav’d, amount to Pounds at last

All-conquering heat, O, intermit thy wrath I  
And on my throbbing temples, potent thus,  
Beam not so fierce! Incessant still you flow  
And still another fervent flood succeeds,  
Pour&#x27;d on the head profhse. In vain I sigh,  
And restless turn, and look around for night;  
Night is far off; and hotter hours approach

Doing an injury puts you below your enemy, revenging one
