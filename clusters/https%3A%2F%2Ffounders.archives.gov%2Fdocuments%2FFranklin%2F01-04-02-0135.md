I. Franklin’s Statement  
Philadelphia, October 19  
As frequent Mention is made in the News Papers from Europe, of the Success of the Philadelphia Experiment for drawing the Electric Fire from Clouds by Means of pointed Rods of Iron erected on high Buildings, &amp;c. it may be agreeable to the Curious to be inform’d, that the same Experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia, tho’ made in a different and more easy Manner, which any one may try, as follows.  
  
Make a small Cross of two light Strips of Cedar, the Arms so long as to reach to the four Corners of a large thin Silk Handkerchief when extended; tie the Corners of the Handkerchief to the Extremities of the Cross, so you have the Body of a Kite; which being properly accommodated with a Tail, Loop and String, will rise in the Air, like those made of Paper; but this being of Silk is fitter to bear the Wet and Wind of a Thunder Gust without tearing. To the Top of the upright Stick of the Cross is to be fixed a very sharp pointed Wire, rising a Foot or more above the Wood. To the End of the Twine, next the Hand, is to be tied a silk Ribbon, and where the Twine and the silk join, a Key may be fastened. This Kite is to be raised when a Thunder Gust appears to be coming on, and the Person who holds the String must stand within a Door, or Window, or under some Cover, so that the Silk Ribbon may not be wet; and Care must be taken that the Twine does not touch the Frame of the Door or Window. As soon as any of the Thunder Clouds come over the Kite, the pointed Wire will draw the Electric Fire from them, and the Kite, with all the Twine, will be electrified, and the loose Filaments of the Twine will stand out every Way, and be attracted by an approaching Finger. And when the Rain has wet the Kite and Twine, so that it can conduct the Electric Fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully from the Key on the Approach of your Knuckle. At this Key the Phial may be charg’d; and from Electric Fire thus obtain’d, Spirits may be kindled, and all the other Electric Experiments be perform’d, which are usually done by the Help of a rubbed Glass Globe or Tube; and thereby the Sameness of the Electric Matter with that of Lightning compleatly demonstrated.  
  
  
II. Priestley’s Account  
To demonstrate, in the completest manner possible, the sameness of the electric fluid with the matter of lightning, Dr. Franklin, astonishing as it must have appeared, contrived actually to bring lightning from the heavens, by means of an electrical kite, which he raised when a storm of thunder was perceived to be coming on. This kite had a pointed wire fixed upon it, by which it drew the lightning from the clouds. This lightning descended by the hempen string, and was received by a key tied to the extremity of it; that part of the string which was held in the hand being of silk, that the electric virtue might stop when it came to the key. He found that the string would conduct electricity even when nearly dry, but that when it was wet, it would conduct it quite freely; so that it would stream out plentifully from the key, at the approach of a person’s finger.  
At this key he charged phials, and from electric fire thus obtained, he kindled spirits, and performed all other electrical experiments which are usually exhibited by an excited globe or tube.  
As every circumstance relating to so capital a discovery as this (the greatest, perhaps, that has been made in the whole compass of philosophy, since the time of Sir Isaac Newton) cannot but give pleasure to all my readers, I shall endeavour to gratify them with the communication of a few particulars which I have from the best authority.  
The Doctor, after having published his method of verifying his hypothesis concerning the sameness of electricity with the matter of lightning, was waiting for the erection of a spire in Philadelphia to carry his views into execution; not imagining that a pointed rod, of a moderate height, could answer the purpose; when it occurred to him, that, by means of a common kite, he could have a readier and better access to the regions of thunder than by any spire whatever. Preparing, therefore, a large silk handkerchief, and two cross sticks, of a proper length, on which to extend it; he took the opportunity of the first approaching thunder storm to take a walk into a field, in which there was a shed convenient for his purpose. But dreading the ridicule which too commonly attends unsuccessful attempts in science, he communicated his intended experiment to no body but his son, who assisted him in raising the kite.  
The kite being raised, a considerable time elapsed before there was any appearance of its being electrified. One very promising cloud had passed over it without any effect; when, at length, just as he was beginning to despair of his contrivance, he observed some loose threads of the hempen string to stand erect, and to avoid one another, just as if they had been suspended on a common conductor. Struck with this promising appearance, he immediately presented his knucle to the key, and (let the reader judge of the exquisite pleasure he must have felt at that moment) the discovery was complete. He perceived a very evident electric spark. Others succeeded, even before the string was wet, so as to put the matter past all dispute, and when the rain had wet the string, he collected electric fire very copiously. This happened in June 1752, a month after the electricians in

39. Any who would be clearly convinced of the  
Nature of Lightning, may make the following Ex-  
periment, Make a fmall Croſs of two thin Strips  
of Wood, the Arms being jult ſo long, as to reach  
the four Corners of a large, thin Silk Handkerchief  
when extended, Tie the Corners of this to the  
Extremities of the Croſs; and fo you have the Bo-  
dy ofa Kite: Add to this a proper Tail, Loop  
and String, and it will riſe in the Air like one SE  
with Paper: But this is fitter to bear the Wind  
and Wet in a Storm without tearing. To the Top  
of the Croſs fix a ſharp pointed Wire, riſing a Foot  
above it. Tie a Silk Ribbon to the End of the  
Twine next the Hand; and where the Silk and  
Twine join, faſten a Key. Raiſe this Kite when  
a Thunder-Storm is coming on: But he that holds  
the String, mult ſtand in a Porch, or under ſome  
other Covering, that the Ribbon may not be wet.  
He muſt likewiſe take particular Care, that the  
T wine do not touch the Top or Side of the Porch..  
As ſoon as the Thunder- Cloud comes over the  
Kite, the pointed Wire draws the Electric Fire  
from it. The Kite and all the Twine are then  
electrified, as plainly appe ers by this, that the looſe  
Filaments of the Twine ſtand out every way, and  
are attracted by an approaching Finger. And when

and was received by a key tied to the extremity of it, that  
part of the string which was held in his hand being of silk,  
that the electric virtue might stop when it came to the key.  
He found that the string would conduct eleciricity when  
nearly dry, but when it was wet, that it would conduct it quite  
freely, so that it would stream out plentifully from the key  
and at the approach of a person’s finger. At this kcy he  
charged phials; and from electric fire thus obtained, kindled  
spirits and performed all other electrical experiments, which  
are usually exhibited by an excited globe or tube.

ning to despair, he observed some loose threads  
of the hempen string rise and stand erect, ex-  
actly as if they had been repelled from each  
other by being charged with electricity. He  
immediately presented his knuckle to the key,  
and to his inexpressible delight drew from it  
the well known electrical spark. It is said  
that his emotion was so great at this comple-  
tion of a discovery which was to make his  
name immortal, that he heaved a deep sigh,  
and felt that he could that moment have wil-  
lingly died. As the rain increased the cord be-  
came a better conductor, and the key gave out  
its electricity copiously. Had the hemp been  
thoroughly wet, the bold experimenter might,  
as he was contented to do, have paid for his  
discovery with his life.

he might extend it, took the opportunity of the first approaching thunder  
storm to walk into a field, where there was a shed convenient for his  
purpose ; but dreading the ridicule which so often attends unsuccessful  
attempts in science, he communicated his design to no one but his son,  
who assisted in preparing and raising the kite.  
  
Having raised his kite, and attached a key to the lower end of the  
hempen string, he insulated it, by fastening it to a post by means of silk.  
As may be supposed, he waited with intense anxiety for the result.  
A considerable time elapsed before there was any appearance of suc-

different and more promising expedient occurred to him, which was, to  
send up the pointed wire upon a kite, by the string of which the light.  
ning might be brought within his reach. He soon succeeded in realizing  
this, the most bold and grand conception which ever presented itself to  
the imagination of an experimental philosopher.  
  
He prepared his kite by making a small cross of two light strips of  
cedar, the arms of sufficient length to extend to the four corners of a  
large silk handkerchief stretched uponthem. To the extremities of the  
arms of the cross he tied the corners of the handkerchief. This being  
properly supplied with a tail, loop, and string, could be raised in the  
air like a common paper kite, and, being made of silk, was more capable  
of bearing rainand wind. ‘To the upright arm of the cross was attached  
an iron point, the lower end of which was in contact with the string by  
which the kite was raised, which was a hempen cord. At the lower  
extremity of this cord, near the observer, a key was fastened; and, in  
order to intercept the electricity in its descent, and prevent it from  
reaching the person who held the kite, a silk ribbon was tied to the  
ring of the key, and

himself. By way of preface, however, it  
may be explained that the kite was made  
out of a large silk handkerchief, using-  
as a frame two light strips of cedar  
across. To the upright stick of the  
cross he fastened a short piece of wire.  
The kite was provided with a tail iu the  
usual way and fastened to a long ball of  
twine. At the end of the twine there was  
attached a silk ribbon, which was to be  
held in the hand, and also to the twine,  
near its point of junction with the  
ribbon, an ordinary door key was  
fastened. Dr. Franklin himself may now  
proceed:— The kite is to be arranged  
when a thunder gust appears to be coming  
on, aud the person who holds the string  
must stand within a door or window, or  
under some cover, so that the silk  
ribbon may not be wet; and euro must foe  
taken that the twine does not touch the  
frame of the door or window. As soon as  
the thunder clouds COUie over the kite  
the pointed wire will draw the electric  
fire from them, and the kite with all  
the twine will be electrified, and the  
loose filaments of the twine will stand  
out every way and bo attracted by an  
approaching finger. &quot; When the rain has  
wet the kite and twine so that it can  
conduct the electric fire freely, you  
find it stream out plentifully from the  
key on the approach of your knuckle.. At  
this key the vial may be charged; and  
from electric fire thus obtained spirits  
may be kindled, and all the other  
electrical experiments be performed  
which are usually done by the help of  
rubbed glass or tubeand thus the  
sameness of the electric matter with  
that of lightning completely  
demonstrated.&quot; Every oue knows that  
Liter the pointed iron wire reaching  
from high, up in the air down to the  
earth came into use everywhere as a  
means of harmlessly drawing off the  
electricity of the clouds to the ground;  
or in other words, of connectin

the first to do so, as no account of Franklin’s early summer experi-  
  
ment could have reached Europe by that date.  
  
In a letter dated Oct. 19, 1752, Franklin gives a description of  
the kite experiment. The letter states that “as frequent mention  
is made in the public papers from Europe of the success of the  
Philadelphia experiments for drawing electric fire from clouds by  
means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings, etc., it may  
be agreeable to the curious to be informed that the same experi-  
ment has succeeded in Philadelphia, though made in a different and  
more easy manner.” A description follows, but written in the pres-  
ent tense in the form of instructions for making the kite and per-  
forming the desired experiment, in this respect being similar to  
the directions given in the Collinson letter for drawing lightning  
from the clouds by means of a high pointed rod. Did Franklin  
himself perform the experiment referred to in the quotation, an

learned of this successful proving of his  
theory with his method by the French  
scientists, he could write them that “the  
same experiment has succeeded in Philadel-  
phia, though made in a different and more

Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar,  
the arm so long as to reach to the four corners of  
a large thin silk handkerchief when extended; tie  
the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities  
of the cross, so you have the body of a kite; which,  
being properly accommodated with a tail, loop, and  
string, will rise in the air, like those made of paper;  
but this being’ of silk is fitter to bear the wet and  
wind of a thunder-gust without tearing. To the  
top of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed  
a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or more  
above the wood. To the end of the twine, next the  
hand, is to be tied a silk ribbon, and where the  
silk and twine join, a key may be fastened. This  
kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears  
to be coming on, and the person who holds the  
string must stand within a door or window, or  
under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not  
be wet; and care must be taken that the twine does  
not touch the frame of the door or window. As

kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire  
from them, and the kite, with all the twine, will  
be electrified, and the loose filaments of the twine  
will stand out every way, and be attracted by an  
approaching finger. And when the rain has wetted  
the kite and twine, so that it can conduct the elec-  
tric fire freely, you will find it stream out plenti-  
fully from the key on the approach of ~your  
knuckle. At this key the phial may be charged;  
and from electric fire thus obtained, spirits may  
be kindled, and all the other electric experiments  
be performed, which are usually done by the help  
of a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the  
sameness of the electric matter with that of light-  
ning completely demonstrated.
