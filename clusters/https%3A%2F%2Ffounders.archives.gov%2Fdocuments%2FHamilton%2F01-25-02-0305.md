The President, as a politician, is in one sense particularly unfortunate. He furnishes frequent opportunities of arraying him against himself—of combating his opinions at one period by his opinions at another. Without doubt, a wise and good man may, on proper grounds relinquish an opinion which he has once entertained, and the change may even serve as a proof of candour and integrity. But with such a man, especially in matters of high public importance, changes of this sort must be rare. The contrary is always a mark either of a weak and versatile mind, or of an artificial and designing character, which, accommodating its creed, to circumstances, takes up or lays down an article of faith, just as may suit a present convenience.  
The question, in agitation, respecting the Judiciary Department, calls up another instance of opposition, between the former ideas of Mr. Jefferson, and his recent conduct. The leading positions which have been advanced as explanatory of the policy of the Constitution, in the structure of the different departments, and as proper to direct the interpretation of the provisions which were contrived to secure the independence and firmness of the Judges, are to be seen in a very emphatical and distinct form in the Notes on Virginia. The passage in which they appear, deserves to be cited at length, as well for its intrinsic merit, as by way of comment upon the true character of its author; presenting an interesting contrast between the maxims, which experience had taught him while Governor of Virginia, and those which now guide him as the official head of a great party in the United States.  
It is in these words—  
“All the powers of government, legislative, executive and judiciary, result to the legislative body. The concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government. It will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots would surely be as oppressive as one. Let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the Republic of Venice. As little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves. An elective despotism was not the government we fought for; but one which should not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits, without being effectually checked and restrained by the others. For this reason that Convention which passed the ordinance of government, laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative, executive and judiciary departments, should be separate and distinct, so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time. But no barrier was provided between these several powers. The judiciary and executive members were left dependent on the legislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their continuance in it. If therefore the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made; nor if made can be effectual; because in that case, they may put their proceedings into the form of an act of assembly, which will render them obligatory on the other branches. They have accordingly in many instances decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy; and the direction of the executive, during the whole time of their session, is becoming habitual and familiar.”  
  
This passage fully recognises these several important truths: that the tendency of our governments is towards a Concentration of the Powers of the different departments in the Legislative Body; that such a Concentration, is precisely the Definition of Despotism, and that an effectual barrier between the respective departments ought to exist. It also, by a strong implication, admits that offices during good behaviour are independent of the Legislature for their continuance in office. This implication seems to be contained in the following sentence: “The Judiciary and Executive members were left dependent on the Legislature for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their continuance in it.” The word ‘some,’ implies that others were not left thus dependent; and to what description of officers can the exception be better applied, than to the Judges, the tenure of whose offices was during good behaviour?  
The sentiments of the President delivered at a period when he can be supposed to have been under no improper bias, must be regarded by all those, who respect his judgement, as no light evidence of the truth of the doctrine for which we contend. Let us, however, resume and pursue the subject on its merits, without relying upon the aid of so variable and fallible an authority.  
At an early part of the discussion in this Examination, a construction of the Constitution was suggested, to which it may not be amiss to return: It amounts to this, that Congress have power to new-model, or even to abrogate an Inferior Court, but not to abolish the office or emoluments of a Judge of such court previously appointed. In the Congressional debates, some of the speakers against the repealing law, appear to have taken it for granted, that the abrogation of the court must draw with it the abolition of the Judges, and therefore, have denied in totality, the power of abrogation. In the course of these papers too, it has been admitted, that if the preservation of the Judges cannot be reconciled with the power to annul the Court, then the existence of this power is rightly denied. But in an affair of such vast magnitude, it is all-important to survey with the utmost caution the ground to be taken, and then to take and maintain it with inflexible fortitude and perseverence. Truth will be most likely to prevail, when the arguments which support it stop at a temperate mean, consistent with practical convenience. Excess is always error. There is hardly any theoretic hypothesis, which, carried to a certain extreme, does not become practically false. In construing a Constitution, it is wise, as far as possible to pursue a course, which will reconcile essential principles with convenient modifications. If guided by this spirit, in the great question which seems destined to decide the fate of our Government, it is believed that the result will accord with the construction, that Congress have a right to change or abolish Inferior Courts, but not to abolish the actual Judges.  
Towards the support of this construction, it has been shewn in another place, that the Courts and the Judges are distinct legal entities, which, in contemplation of law, may exist, independently the one of the other—mutually related, but not inseparable. The act proposed to be repealed exemplifies this idea in practice. It abolishes the District Courts of Tennessee and Kentucky, and transfers their Judges to one of the Circuit Courts. Though the authorities and jurisdiction of those Courts are vested in the Circuit Court, to which the Judges are transferred; yet the identity of the Courts ceases. It cannot be maintained that Courts so different in their organization and jurisdiction, are the same; nor could a legislative transfer of the Judges have been constitutional, but upon the hypothesis, that the office of a Judge may survive the Court of which he is a member: a new appointment by the Executive, of two additional Judges for the Circuit Court, would otherwise have been necessary.  
This precedent in all its points is correct, and exhibits a rational operation of the construction which regards the office of the Judge, as distinct from the Court, as one of the elements or constituent parts of which it is composed: not as a mere incident that must perish with its principal.  
It will not be disputed, that the Constitution might have provided in terms, and with effect, that an Inferior Court which had been established by law, might by law be abolished; nevertheless, that the Judges of such Courts should retain the offices of Judges of the United States, with the emoluments before attached to their offices. The operation of such a provision would be, that when the Court was abolished, all the functions to be executed in that Court, would be suspended, and the Judge could only continue to exert the authorities and perform the duties which might before have been performed, without reference to causes pending in Court; but he would have the capacity to be annexed to another Court, without the intervention of a new appointment, and by that annexation, simply to renew the exercise of the authorities and duties which had been suspended.  
If this might have been the effect of positive and explicit provision, why may it not likewise be the result of provisions, which, presenting opposite considerations, point to the same conclusion, as a compromise calculated to reconcile those considerations with each other and to unite different objects of public utility? Surely the affirmative infringes no principle of legal construction, transgresses no rule of good sense.  
Let us then enquire, whether there are not in this case opposite and conflicting considerations, demanding a compromise of this nature? On the one hand, it is evident that if an inferior court once instituted, though found inconvenient, cannot be abolished, this is to entail upon the community the mischief, be it more or less, of a first error in the administration of the government. On the other hand, it is no less evident, that if the judges hold their offices at the discretion of the legislature, they cease to be a co-ordinate, and become a dependent branch of the government; from which dependence mischiefs infinitely greater are to be expected.  
All these mischiefs, the lesser as well as the greater, are avoided by saying, “Congress may abolish the Courts, but the Judges shall retain their offices with the appurtenant emoluments.” The only remaining inconvenience then, will be one too insignificant to weigh in a national scale, that is, the expence of the compensations of the Incumbents, during their lives. The future and permanent expence will be done away.  
But will this construction secure the benefits proposed by the Constitution from the independent tenure of Judicial Office? Substantially it will. The main object is to preserve the judges from being influenced by an apprehension of the loss of the advantages of office. As this loss could not be incurred, that influence would not exist. Their firmness could not be assailed by the danger of being superseded, and perhaps consigned to want. Let it be added, that when it was understood not to be in the power of the Legislature to deprive the Judges of their offices and emoluments, it would be a great restraint upon the factious motives, which might induce the abolition of a court. This would be much less likely to happen unless for genuine reasons of public utility; and of course there would be a much better prospect of the stability of Judiciary establishments.

nts  
on  
  
them at the same time. But no barrier was pro-  
vided between these several powers. Vie judiciary  
and executive members were left dependent on the  
legislative for their subsistence in office, and some  
of them for their continuance in it. If, therefore,  
the legislative assumes executive and judiciary  
  
powers, no opposition is likely to be made: nor if  
  
made, can be effectual; because, in that case, they  
may put their proceedings into the form of an act of  
assembly, which will render them obligatory on  
the other branches.‘ They have accordingly én  
many instances decided rights, which should have been  
left to judicial controversy; and the direction of the  
executive, during the whole time af their session, is  
decoming habitual and familiar.  
  
This passage fully recognizes these several im-  
portant truths: that the tendency of our govern-  
ments is towards a concentration of the powers of the  
different departments in the /egislative body; that  
  
such a concentration is precisely the definition of  
  
despotism, and that an effectual barrier between the  
respective departments ought to exist. It also, by  
a strong implication, admits that offices during good  
behaviour are independent of the legislature for  
their continuange in office. This implication  
seems to be contained in the following sentence:  
“The judiciary and executive members were left  
dependent on the legislature for their subsistence  
in office, and some of them for their continuance in  
it.” The word * some’ implies that others were  
not left thus dependent ; and to what description  
of officers can the exception be better applied, than  
to the judges, the tenure of whose offices was  
during goad behaviour ?  
  
The sentiments of the president, delivered at a  
period when he can be supposed to have been un-  
der no improper bias, must be regarded by all  
those, who respect his judgment, as no light evi-  
dence of the truth of the doctrine, for which we  
contend. Let us, however, resume and pursue  
the subject on its merits, without relying upon the  
aid of so variable and fallible an authority.  
  
At an early part of the discussion in this exami-  
nation, a construction of the constitution was sug-  
gested, to which it may not be amiss to return. It  
amounts to this, that congress have power to new-  
model, or even to abrogate an inferior court, but  
not to abolish the office or emoluments of a judge  
of such court previously appointed. In the con-  
gressional debates, some of the speakers against  
the repealing law appear to have taken it for grant-  
ed, that the abrogation of the court must draw with  
it the abolition of the judges, and, therefore, have  
denied in totality, the power of abrogation. In the  
course of these papers too, it has been admitted,  
that ifthe preservation of the judges cannot be re-  
conciled with the power to annul the court, then  
the existence of this power is rightly denied. But  
in an affair of such vast magnitude, it is all-im-  
portant to survey with the utmost caution the  
ground to be taken, and then to take and maintain  
it with inflexible fortitude and perseverance.  
Truth will be most likely to prevail, when the ar-  
guments, which support it stop at a temperate  
mean, consistent with practical convenience. Ex-  
cess is alwayserror. ‘There is hardly any theore-  
tic hypothesis, which, carried to acertain extreme,  
does not become practically false. In construing  
a constitution, it is wise as far as possible to pur-  
sue a course, which will reconcile essential princi-  
ples with convenient modifications. If guided by  
this spirit, in the great question, which seems des-  
tined to decide the fate of our government, it is  
believed that the result will accord with the con-  
Struction, that congress have a right to change or  
abolish inferior courts, but not to abolish the actual  
judges.  
  
Towards the support of this construction, it has  
been shewn in another place, that the courts and  
the judges are distinct legal entities, which, in  
Contemplation of law, may exist independently the

one of the other....mutually related, but not inse-  
parable. ‘The act proposed to be repealed exem-  
plies this idea in practice. It abolishes the dis-  
trict courts of Tennessee and Kentucky, and  
transfers their judges to one of the circuit courts.  
Though the authorities and jurisdiction of those  
courts are vested in the circuit court, to which the  
judges are transferred; yet the identity of the  
courts cease. IJt cannot be maintained that courts  
so different in their organization and jurisdiction  
are the samme; nor could a legislative transfer of  
the judges have been constitutional, but upon the  
hypothesis, that the office of a judge may survive  
the court, of which he is a member: A new ap-  
pointment by the executive, of two additional  
judges for the circuit court would otherwise have  
been necessary.  
  
This precedent in all its points is correct, and  
exhibits a rational operation of the construction,  
which regards the office of the judge as distinct  
from the court, as one of the elements or constitu-  
ent parts, of which it is composed; not as a mere  
incident, that must perish with its principal.  
  
It will not be disputed, that the constitution  
might have provided interms, and with effect, that  
an inferior court, which had been established by law,  
might by law be abolished; nevertheless, that the  
judges of such court should retain the offices of  
judges of the United States, with the emoluments  
before attached to their offices. The operation of  
such a provision would be, that when the court  
was abolished, all the functions to be executed in  
that court would be suspended, and the judge could  
only continue to exert the authorities and perform  
the duties, which might before have been perform-  
ed, without reference to causes pending in court ;  
but he would have the capacity to be annexed to  
another court, without the intervention of a new  
appointment, and by that annexation, simply to  
renew the exercise of the authorities and duties,  
which had been suspended.  
  
If this might have been the effect of positive and  
explicit provision, why may it not likewise be the  
result of provisions, which, presenting opposite  
considerations, point to the same conclusion, as a  
compromise calculated to reconcile those consider-  
ations with each other, and to unite different ob-  
jects of public utility? Surely the affirmative in-  
fringes no principle of legal construction, trans-  
gresses no rule of good sense.  
  
Let us then enquire, whether there are not in  
this case opposite and conflicting considerations,  
demanding a compromise ofthis nature? Onthe  
one hand, it is evident that if an inferior court once  
instituted, though found inconvenient, cannot be  
abolished, this is to entail upon the community the  
mischief, be it more or less, of a first error in the  
administration of the government. On the other  
hand, it is no less evident, that if the judges hold  
their offices at the discretion of the legislature,  
they cease to be a co-ordinate, and become a de-  
pendent branch of the government; from which  
dependence mischiefs infinitely greater are to be  
expected.  
  
All these mischiefs, the lesser as well as the  
greater, are avoided by saying, “ Congress may  
aboilsh the courts, but the judges shall retain their of-  
jices, with the apurtenant emoluments.”” ‘The only  
remaining inconvenience then, will be one too in-  
significant to weigh in a national scale, that is, the  
expence of the compensations of the incumbents  
during their lives. The future and permanent ex-  
pence will be done away.  
  
But will this construction secure the benefits  
proposed by the constitution from the independent  
tenure of judicial office? Substantially it will......  
The main object is to preserve the judges from be-  
ing influenced by an apprehension of the loss of  
the advantages of office. As this loss could not be  
incurred, that influence would not exist. Their  
firmness could not be assailed by the danger of be-

ing superseded, and perhaps consigned to want.  
Let it be added, that when it was understood not  
to be inthe power of the legislature to deprive the  
judges of their offices and emoluments, it would  
be a great restraint upon the factious motives,  
which might induce the abolition of a court. This  
would be much less likely to happen, unless for ge-  
nuine reasons of public utility ; and of course there  
would be a much better prospect of the stability of

THE Present, n&lt; a politician, is in one  
fenfe particuhrly unfortunate. He furnilhes  
frequ nt opportunities of arraying him ajainft  
him felt—of combating h&gt;9 opinions it on£y&gt;eri*  
od by his opinions at another. Without doubt,  
a wife and good man m iy. on proper grounds  
relioquifh an op’nion which he has once eater  
taioed, and the change may even ferte as a  
proof of candor and integrity But with foch  
a man, efpccially in matters of high public im  
porta nee, charges of thit fort »ud he rare.  
  
. m..  
The contraryTs always a mark either of a weak  
and verf^tde mind, or of an artifi ial and de  
figning character, which, a^comm »daing its  
creed to ci&#x27;cum dances, takes up or lays down  
an sac kle of faith, juft as may fuit a prefen  
conv&lt;r.:enre.  
The 4 tefti n in ag:ti Ion, refpefling the jti  
di i irv department, calls up ano her inftanceof  
opp&lt;&gt;n »on, between the former ideas of Mr.  
Jtff r !&lt; n and his recent condufl. &#x27;Flu leading  
pofit o is w hich have been advanced as exphtn  
atorjr of ihe policy of the conftitution, in tha  
ftru&amp;ure of the different departments, and as  
proper to died the interpretation of the provi­  
(ions which were contrived to fecure the inJe  
p-mdence *nd firnmefi of tlse judges, are to be  
leeo ia a very emphatical and dilli’ form in  
the No&#x27;ee on Virginia. The paffage in which  
they appear, delerve to be cted at Jet gth, as  
well foi its intrinfic merit, as by w ry bf com.  
ment upon the true eharadcr of its author ;  
prefenting an interfiling c* ntraft between the  
maxims, v hich experience bad taught hint while  
governor of Virginia, and thofe which now  
guide him at the official head of a great pa. ty  
m the Un ted States.  
It is in thefe words :—  
All the powers of government, legiHrive,  
executive and judiciary, relult to the legislative  
body. The cnc ntra ing thef: in the fame  
hands is preckely the definition of defpoiic gov­  
ernment. it will be n&lt;» allevi.*tion that thefe  
powers wdl be exercrfeJ by a plurality rf hand &quot;  
and not by a Angle one. One hundied and  
fevemy three defpots wornd furely be as oppref  
five as f*r,e. Let thofe who doubt it turn their  
e&gt;es on the Republic of Venice. As litt e w ill  
itavbl us thu they arc ih fen By ou feve ..  
An el Piw dtfpQtifm wa* not the govern me t wc  
fough ior ; but onj; which (hould n^t only be  
founded on free principles, but in which the  
pt^ver* of government fhould be lo divided and  
balanced among feverai bodies of magiitracy,  
as that r,o one cotiM tranfeend their legpl 1 mirs,  
  
without being cfteaualiy checked and rejtratnsd  
by ihe others &#x27; For this ie.ifon that conven­  
tion which pifTed the ordinance of government,  
laid its foundation on this bafis, that the legis­  
lative, executive and judicial y departments  
fh&lt; old be feparate and uil\ir.&amp;. fo that no per.  
foo ffinuld exert ife the powers of more than  
o e of them at the lame time. But no barrier  
was provided between thefe fevered powers. Tire  
judiciary and e*e&gt;.uti&#x27;,e members were left de  
per.dcr.; on the legifla.ive lor their fubtilFncc  
in office, and Jninc ot them tor their continu­  
ance in it. If ihercfi re the leg&#x27;adlure au*imes  
rXeuriveand judiciary powers, no opposition  
is likely to he made \ « r il made can be ef  
fV3u »1 ; becaufe in that c -ft, they rnay put  
iheir proceed i gs n o.ihe fo in of an of af­  
fcmbly, which will renderihem obligatory op  
ihe o:her branches. They have accordingly  
in many injlances decided rights which (h ul 1 b ve  
be n left to judiciary controverfy ; and the direction  
cj the executive, during the whole time of their ff  
J;ony is becoming habitual and familiar  
ffoi, paff g: fully recognizes the f.veral i»n  
portant tru hs ; that the tendeh.y of our g&lt; v  
einnvhts is towards a concentration of the poifr  
ers of the diffe ent department* in the legifit  
tive body ; that fuch a concentration is preefe.  
Iy the definition of Jtlpotifm, a -d that an ef­  
textual barrier between the refpeftive depart,  
merits ought to cx‘ft. It aft&#x27;o, by a ftrong Im*  
plication, admits that officers duiitg ;»ood be  
  
haviour are independent ot the te, m ame t ir  
their continuance in c-fiice* Tim implication  
Teems to be contained in the following feu  
tcnce :—4* The judiciary ttnd executive mem  
beis were left dependent on the iegiflature for  
their lu^fiftence in effire, and forne of them for  
their Totowuame in it.” The word ‘Tome/ im­  
plies that others were not left thus dependent ;  
and to what defeription of &lt; fficers can the ex  
ception lie better applied, than to the judges,  
the tenure of whofe office* was during good be­  
haviour ?  
The fentiments of the Prefident, delivered at  
a per’od when he cm be flop &gt;f d ro haVe been  
under no improper b&gt;as mud He regarded by  
all thofe wh * refpc«3 his j.i igmnt, as ijo light  
evidence of the truth ot the cioilrine for which  
we contend. Let u*, however, r funre and  
purfue the fu j &lt;3 on it* m r t , with tit rtlying  
up n the aid of fo fari.toie and fallible auihor­  
ity. ^  
At an early part of the difeoftion in this Ex­  
amination, a coniLu3ion of the conftitution  
was fuggefted, to which it may not be amils  
to Teturn. It amounts to this, that CongreA  
have power to new-model, or even ro abr^gne  
an inferior court, but n-t to abol ih the office  
oremoinments of a judge oi fu.h court pre.  
vioufly appointed. I »the congreifional legates,  
lome 6f the lpcakers againft the repealing law,  
appear to have takm it for granted, that the  
abrogation of the court rauft draw with it the  
abolition ofthejudgsi% and therefore Ipive denied,  
in totality&#x27;, the power of abrogation. In the  
^ourfe of thefe papers too, it has been admit4  
ted, that if the preferTatioa of the judges can  
not be reconciled with the power to annul the  
court, then the exfttence of this power is right,  
ly denied, but io an affair of fu h Taft mag  
n tude, it is all important to furvey wi h tne  
atmoft caution the ground to be taken, and  
then to take tad roainuia it with inflexible  
  
fortitude and perf ve.ance. Truth will he  
nvft like y to prevail, when the arg m-ms  
which fupport it ft.p at a t mj erate m »n, con.  
li tent wuh ptaflic.il cbnveoiei ce. Ex ef if

to puifue a courfe, which wil. rAco; c !e lien,

If guided by th s I pirn, in 4 e vre t qoedi n  
which feems deftfoe J to decide the fa e of our  
govemfiient, :t is betievrd that the refill wi»l  
accord with the c nlliuftivn, th t C ngrefs  
have a right to chat g«cm abolifh i fe. io. couis*  
but not to aholifh the atftuai jud e .  
T wards the lupptut of .his cocftrtifti^n. ie  
has been fhewn in another place, that the c urtf  
and the judges are difti’ a legal entities, which,  
ia contempiabion of law, may ex-ft, indeoend.  
enily, the one of the other—mutudly related,  
but not infeparable. The aft pro; of J to be  
repealed exemplifies this idea in pr. ft ce It  
aboftftics ihe Ji rift courts of Te ne(Tee and  
Ktntucky, anJ transtcH th ir judges to one  
ot the circuit courts. Th ugh the anth &gt;r&lt; ef  
anJ jirifdi&amp;ion of th &gt;fe court* are vefted in the  
circuit court, to w ich the judges are tram,  
ferred ; yet the indemnify of the court rea&lt;’es. It  
cannot be m.iintaiueJ that couiis, fo diff-rent  
in ’heir or &#x27;anU.iim and junffifteen, are the  
fime ; nor could a legifla’ive transfer of the  
judge* h ive been coo ti.u’.iora , but upon the  
hypothefi?, that the cfSce of a judge may fur­  
vive the court of which he is a niv.m er. \

Thi* precedent in ail us p i- corrdft, and  
eihihiis a rational ope-anon of the toa.uiftt li  
which regards the office of ihe ju g , *s dif  
lihft from the court, as one of ihe elements or  
conflitoert parts of which it is compof d : not  
as a mere incident that mult penlh with its  
j brincip.il.  
  
It will not be d fruited, that »he conmtuUon  
might have provided rn term, a d with cffcdt,  
that an tnfenor cr urt which hid been ertab­  
lifliid by law, might hy law be acoltfhed : nrv*  
enbelets that the j idgev of filch cou t fh ulJ  
retain the offices* ot judge&#x27; * f the Cni e i i&gt; ates,  
with the emolum nts before ,ut cued to he r  
cfilces. &#x27;Fhe operati n of futh a pr v lion  
would be, that when th court was abodfhed,  
ali the fun&amp;ior s to be cxe u&lt;ed in that court  
would be fufpendeJ, *nJ &#x27;he judge couid only  
cont nue to ex r &#x27;he author i ie*. a d perform  
the duties which tmght lef re have been per*  
formed, without reierrence to caues fending  
in Cf&#x27;ti&#x27;t ; but he would hive the capac ty to  
be annexed to another o urt, wmhput me in­  
ttfven Ji&gt;n of a new appoi»&#x27;mer&#x27;t, and, by that  
annexa ion, Amply to renew the exercife of he  
authoi ilits and duties which had been iufpcn*  
  
aea.  
If this might have been the effcfl of poHtivt  
and explicit provfion, why may it ndt ike &lt;ift  
be the refulc of provift »ns, which, prefemtog

couitrudboB, tranfgreif-s no ru e ot d f. fe.  
Let u§ then inquire, whether tift. e are not

On the one hand, it is evident that if an i&gt; ferii t  
court Once inftiiuted, though found ii Conve­  
nient, cannot be aboliffi d, this is to entail tip­  
on the com muni y the mifebi F, he it more or

Ad thrfe 5&gt;if hief*, the lefT.r as well as the  
greater, are avoided by lr*yi g, *k Congrc-fs may  
abolifh the courts, but the judges (hall retain

The only remaining inconvenience then, will  
bi one too infignifi aut to weigh in a nati nal  
fcale, that i&#x27;» the expeace of the corapcnfatioos

But will this cnnfimflton feeme the benefits

the powers of government should be so divided and balanced  
among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could tran-  
scend their legal limits, without being effectually checked and  
restrained by the others. For this reason that convention, which  
passed the ordinance of government, laid its foundation on this  
basis, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments  
should be separate and distinct, so that no person should exer-

er which  
concentrating these in the same hands  
is precisely the definition of despotic  
government. It will be no alleviation  
that these powers will be exercised by  
a plurality of hands, and not by a sin­  
gle one. One hundred and seventy­  
three despots would surely be as ag­  
gressive as one.&quot; &quot;As little will it  
avail us that they are chosen by our­  
selves. An elective despotism was  
not the Government we fought for,  
but one which should not only be  
founded on free principles, but in  
which the powers of government  
should be so divided and balanced  
among several bodies of magistracy as  
that no one could transcend their le­  
gal limits without being effectually  
checked and restrained by the others.  
For this reason that convention which  
passed the ordinance of government,  
laid its foundation on the basis that  
the legislative, executive and judicia­  
ry departments should be separate and  
distinct, so that no person should ex­  
ercise the powers of more than one of  
them at the same time. But no bar­  
rier was provided between these sev­  
eral powers. The judiciary and exec­  
utive members were left dependent  
on the legislative for their subsistence  
in it. If, therefore, the legislature  
assumes executive and judiciary pow­  
ers, no opposition is likely to be made;  
nor if made, can be effectual, because  
in this case, they may put their pro­  
ceedings into the form of an act of as­  
sembly, which will render them obli  
gatory on the other branches. They&#x27;  
have, accordingly, in many instances,  
decided rights which should have been  
left to judiciary controversy, and the  
direction of the Executive, during the  
whole time of their session, is becom­  
ing habitual and familliar.&quot;  
In addition to what has been said  
by these distinguished writers, it may  
also be urged that the dominant party  
in each house may, by the expulsion  
tive the wholesome and restraining  
power, which it was intended by the  
framers of the Constitution should be  
exerted by them. This would be a  
practical concentration of all power  
in the Congress of the United States  
this, in the language of the author  
of the Declaration of Independence,  
would be &quot;precisely the definition of  
despotie government.
