&quot;Mr. Gouverneur Morris moved to insert  
fourteen, instead of four years citizenship,

a tincture of illiberality to the constitution;

the nntional legislature, even by special  
nets of naturalization, to confer the full  
r.ink of citizens on meritorious strangers;  
  
and because it will discourage the most  
desirable class of people from emigrating

constitution have the intended effect, of  
giving stability nnd reputation to our gov.
