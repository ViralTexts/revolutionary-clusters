g principle is distressing in reflection to the mind of a freeborn.England is now making the experiment of Peace. All classes cry aloud at the oppresion of the taxes. The Farmer utters bitter complaints at the reduced price of grain. The Landlord cannot collect his Rents. Many Estates are without Tenants &amp; many produce nothing when they are tenanted. In some cases the Landlord has to pay his own &amp; his tenants taxes without receiving anything from his Estates. This state of things I imagine cannot last long. All look to the next Parliament in february for relief. there is an impromptu in the mornings papers paper—“The land was doubly tax’d we thoughtto carry on the War; Now War is to a period brought,Still more our taxes are.Strange conduct this all must allowHush! let your murmurs cease; You pay these double taxes now,To carry on the Peace.”The late paying off of the Navy &amp; the discharge

The very accents scarce out-weigh’d the thought,  
Thus fitted to her fancy’s sportful doom,  
She gave the well-breath’d lightness to the loom.  
Each fibre was some passion&#x27;s tender proof,  
And vpws, and transports, liv&#x27;d along the woof.  
With sunny rays inwove, not such as fall,  
One massy splendour, from the central ball,  
But tints that with divided lustre glow,  
Half bright, half humid, from the watery bow,  
Cay gleam’d the web, with emblems rae$t de­

The cliarms and fates of gentle wowankind.
