ns shall in like manner be free to sell them, paying in both Cases such duties, charges and fees only as are or shall be paid by the most favoured Nation, whose privilege is not the effect of a particular and reciprocal compensation according to Treaties now existing.— Nevertheless, the United States of America reserve to themselves the right where any Nation restrains the transportation of merchandize to the Vessels of the Country of which it is the growth or manufacture to establish against such Nation retaliating regulations:  
And each party reserves the right to prohibit in their respective Countries the exportation or importation of any species of goods or Commodities whatsoever, when reasons of State shall require it. In this case the Subjects or Citizens of either of the Contracting Parties shall not import or export the merchandize prohibited by the other, but if one of the Contracting Parties permits any person of their own or any other Nation to import or export the same merchandize, the Citizens or Subjects of the other shall immediatly enjoy the same Liberty.  
  
  
Art: V  
All Merchants, Commanders of Vessels and other Subjects and Citizens of each Party shall have free Liberty in all places within the dominion or jurisdiction of the other, to manage their own business themselves or to employ whomsoever they please to manage the whole or any part thereof for them, they shall also be free to load or unload their merchandize at such time and in to such Vessels as they shall think most convenient.  
  
  
Art: VI  
That the Vessels of either Party loading within the ports or jurisdiction of the other may not be uselesly harrassed or detained, it is  
  
agreed that all examinations of goods required by the Laws shall be made before they are laden on board the Vessel and that there shall be no examination after; nor shall the Vessel be searched at any time unless articles shall have been laden therein clandestinly and illigally in which case the person by whose order they were carried on board, or who carried them without order, shall be liable to the Laws of the Land in which he is; but no other person shall be molested, nor shall any other goods nor the Vessel be seized or detained for that cause.  
  
  
Art: VII  
Each Party shall endeavour by all means in their power to protect and defend all the Vessels and other effects belonging to the Subjects or the Citizens of the other, which shall be within the extent of their Jurisdiction by Sea or by Land, and shall use all their efforts to recover and cause to be restored to the right owners their Vessels and effects which shall be taken from them within the extent of their said jurisdiction.  
  
  
Art: VIII.  
The Vessels of the Subjects or Citizens of either Party coming on any Coast belonging to the other, where Commerce is not forbidden to all Foreign Nations, but not willing to enter in to Port, or being entered in to port and not willing to unload their Cargoes, or break bulk, shall have liberty to depart and to persue their voyage without molestation, and without being obliged to pay any duties, charges or fees whatever except such port charges as are paid by the most favoured Nations, nor to render any account of their Cargo, but they shall be obliged to receive the usual Guards as practised with the most favoured Nations.  
  
  
Art: IX.  
When any Vessel of either Party shall be wrecked, foundered, or otherwise damaged on the Coasts or within the Dominions of the other, their respective Subjects or Citizens shall receive, as well for themselves as for their Vessels and effects the same assistance which would be due to the Inhabitants of the Country where the damage happens, and shall pay the same charges and dues only as the said Inhabitants would be subject to pay in a like case, and if the operations of repair shall require that the whole or any part of their cargo be unloaded, they shall pay no duties, charges, or fees, on the part which they shall relade and carry away.— The ancient and barbarous  
  
right to wrecks of the Sea shall be intirely abolished, with respect to the Subjects or Citizens of the two Contracting Parties.  
  
  
Art: X  
The Citizens or Subjects of each Party shall have power to dispose of their personal goods within the Jurisdiction of the other by Testament, Donation, or otherwise, and their Representatives being Subjects or Citizens of the other Party shall succed to their said personal Goods, whether by Testament, or ab intestato; and may take possession thereof either by themselves or by others acting for them, and dispose of the same at their will, paying such dues only as the Inhabitants of the Country where in the said goods are shall be subject to pay in like cases, and in case of the absence of the Representative such care shall be taken of the said goods and for so long a time as would be taken of the goods of a Native in like case untill the Lawful owner may take measures for receiving them, and if question shall arise among several Claimants to which of them the said goods belong the same shall be decided finally by the Laws and Judges of the Land wherein the said Goods are. And where on the death of any person holding real estate within the Territories of the one Party, such real estate would by the Laws of the Land descend on a Citizen or Subject of the other were he not disqualified by Alienage, such Subject or Citizen shall be allowed a reasonable time to sell the same, and to withdraw the procceds without molestation.  
  
  
Art: XI  
There shall be a full intire Liberty of Conscience allowed to the Inhabitants and Subjects of each Party and no one shall be molested, in regard to

Art: XII  
If one of the Contracting Parties should be engaged in War with any other Power, the free intercourse and Commerce of the Subjects or Citizens of the Party remaining Neuter with the Belligerent Powers shall not be interrupted, on the Contrary, in that case, as in  
  
full peace, the Vessels of the Neutral Party, may navigate freely to and from the ports, and on the Coasts of the Belligerent Parties, free Vessels making free goods, in so much that all things shall be adjudged free which shall be on board any Vessel belonging to the Neutral Party, although such things belong to the Enemy of the other, except the merchandizes deemed Contraband, namely, Cannons, mortars, fire arms, pistols, bombs, grenades, bullets, balls, fusils, flints, matches, powder, salt-petre, sulphur, cuirasses, pikes, swords, cartouch-boxes, belts, saddles and bridles which shall be adjudged Contraband, and subject to confiscation; excepting nevertheless the quantity which may be requisite for the Defence of the Vessel, and of those who compose the Crew; and the same freedom shall be extended to persons who shall be on board a free Vessel, although they should be Enemies to the other Party, unless they be Soldiers in actual Service of such Enemy; on the other hand, enemy Vessels shall make enemy goods, in so much that whatever shall be found in the Vessels of an Enemy shall be confisca

l deliver out the goods supposed to be of Contraband nature, he shall be admitted to do it, and the Vessel shall not in that Case be carried in to any Port, nor further detained, but shall be allowed to proceed on her Voyage, nor shall any such Articles be subject to be taken or delayed in any case if they be not in greater quantity than may be necessary for the use of the ships, or of the persons in it. But in case the Contraband Merchandizes cannot be all received on board the Vessel of the Captor, then the Captor may notwithstanding the offer of delivering him the Contraband goods, carry the Vessel to the nearest port.  
  
  
Art: XIV  
And in the same Case where one of the Parties is engaged in War with another Power, that the Vessels of the Neutral Party may be readily and certainly known, it is agreed that they shall be provided with Sea Letters, or Passports which shall express the name, the property and burthen of the Vessel, as also the name and dwelling of the Master, which Passports shall be made out in good and due forms, (to be settled by Convention between the Parties whenever  
  
occasion shall require) shall be renewed as often as the Vessel shall return in to port, and shall be exhibited whensoever required as well in the open Sea as in Port—  
But if the said Vessel be under Convoy of one or more Vessels of War belonging to the Neutral Party, the simple Declaration of the Officer Commanding the Convoy, that the said Vessel belongs to the Party of which he is, shall be Considered as establishing the fact, and shall relieve both parties from the trouble of further examination.  
  
  
Art: XV  
And to prevent intirely all disorder and violence in such cases, it is stipulated, that when the Vessels of the Neutral Party sailing without Convoy, shall be met by any Vessel of War, public or private of the other Party, such Vessel of War shall not approach within cannon shot of the said Neutral Vessel, nor send more than two or three men in their boat on board the same to examine her Sea Letters or Passports, and all persons belonging to any Vessel of War public or private who shall molest or injure in any manner whatever the people, Vessels, or effects of the other Party shall be responsable in their persons and property for damages and interest, and more especially the Commanding officer of the Vessel shall be responsable civily for the same in his person and property, by whomsoever of his Crew the injury was done: sufficient security for which shall be given by all Commanders of private armed Vessels before they are Commissioned.  
  
  
Art: XVI.  
It is agreed that the Subjects, or Citizens of each of the Contracting Parties their Vessels and effects shall not be liable to any Embargo or Detention on the part of the other for any Military Expedition or other public or private purpose whatsoever, and in all cases of seisure, detention, or arrest for Debts contracted, or offences commited by any Citizen or Subject of the one Party within the Jurisdiction of the other, the same shall be made and prosecuted by order and autority of Law only, and according to the regular course of proceedings usual in such Cases.  
  
  
Art: XVII.  
If any Vessel or effects of the Neutral Power be taken by an Enemy of the other or by a Pirate, and retaken by that other, they shall be brought in to some port of one of the Parties and delivered in to the Custody of the officers of that port, in order to be restored intire to  
  
the true proprietor as soon as due proof shall be made concerning the property thereof  
  
  
Art: XVIII.  
If the Citizens or Subjects of either Party in danger from tempests, pirates, enemies, or other accident, shall take refuge with their Vessels or effects within the harbours or Jurisdiction of the other, they shall be received, protected and treated with humanity and kindness and shall be permitted to furnish themselves at reasonable Prices with all refreshments, provisions and other things necessary for their sustenance, health, and accomodation, and for the repair of their Vessels

Art: XX  
No Citizen or Subject of either of the Contracting Parties shall take from any Power with which the other may be at War any Commission or Letter of Marque for arming any Vessel to act as a Privateer against the other, on pain of being punished as a Pirate, nor shall either Party hire, Lend, or give any part of their naval or military force to the Enemy of the other to aid them offensively or defensively against that other unless bound thereto by some Treaty heretofore made.

ations as they shall judge necessary for the Conduct of their respective Vessels of War, public and private, relative to the Vessels which they shall take and carry in to the ports of the two Parties.  
  
  
Art: XXII  
Where the Parties shall have a Common-Enemy the Vessels of War of each shall upon all occasions take under their protection the Vessels of the other going the same course, and shall defend such Vessels as long as they hold the same course against all force and violence in the same manner as they ought to protect and defend the Vessels belonging to the Party of which they are.  
  
  
Art: XXIII.  
If War should arise between the two Contracting Parties, the Merchants of either Country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain one year, to collect their Debts and settle their affairs and may depart freely, carrying off all their effects; without molestation or hindrance, and all Women and Children, Scholars of every faculty, Cultivators of the earth, Artizans, Manufacturers and Fishermen, unarmed and inhabiting unfortefied Towns, Villages, or Places, and in general all others, whose occupations are for the common subsistance and benefit of Mankind, shall be allowed to continue their respective employments, and shall not be molested in  
  
their persons, nor shall their Houses, or Goods be burnt or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields wasted by the armed force of the Enemy in whose power by the events of War, they may happen to fall: but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force, the same shall be payed for at a reasonable price. And all merchant and trading Vessels employed in exchanging the products of different places, and thereby rendering the necessary conveniences and comforts of human Life more easy to be obtained and more general shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested, and neither of the Contracting Powers shall grant or issue any Commission to any Private armed Vessel empowering them to take or destroy such trading Vessels or interrupt such Commerce.  
  
  
Art: XXIV  
And to prevent the destruction of Prisoners of War, by sending them in to distant and inclement Countries, or by crowding them in to close and noxious places, the two Contracting Parties solemnly pledge themselves to each other, and to the World, that they will not adopt any such practice. that neither will send the Prisoners whom they may take from the other in to the East Indies or any other parts of Asia, or Africa: but that they shall be placed in some part of their Dominions in Europe or America in wholesome situations; that they shall not be confined in Dungeons, Prisonships nor Prisons, nor be put in to Irons, nor bound, nor otherwise restrained in the use of their limbs, that the officers shall be enlarged on their Paroles within convenient Districts and have comfortable Quarters, and the common-Men be disposed in Cantonments open and extensive enough for air and exercise, and lodged in Barracks as roomly and good as are provided by the Party in whose power they are for their own Troops; that the Officers shall also be daily furnished by the Party in whose power they are with as many rations and of the same articles and quality as are allowed by them, either in kind or by Commutation to Officers of equal rank in their own Army, and all others shall be daily furnished by them with such ration as they allow to a Common Soldier in their own Service, the value whereof shall be paid by the other Party on a mutual adjustment of Accounts for the Subsistance of Prisoners at the Close of the War, and the said Accounts shall not be mingled with, or sett off against any others, nor the Balances due on them be withheld as a satisfaction or reprisal for any other article, or for any other cause real or pretended whatever; that each Party shall be allowed to keep a  
  
Commissary of Prisoners, of their own Appointment, with every separate Cantonment of Prisoners in possession of the other, which Commissary shall see the Prisoners as often as he pleases, shall be allowed to receive and destribute whatever Comforts may be sent to them by their friends and shall be free to make his reports in open Letters to those who employ him.— But if any Officer shall break his parole, or any other Prisoner shall escape from the Limits of his Cantonment after they shall have been designated to him, such individual Officer, or other Prisoner shall forfeit so much of the Benefits of this Article as provides for his enlargement on Parole or Cantonment. And it is declared that neither the pretence that War dissolves all Treaties nor any other whatever shall be considered as annulling or suspending this, and the next preceding Article, but on the Contrary that the State of War is precisely that for which they are provided and during which they are to be as Sacredly observed as the most acknowledged Articles in the Law of Nature or Nations.  
  
  
Art: XXV.  
The Squadrons or Vessels of War of the two Contracting Parties, may enter freely in to the ports, roads or bays of the one or other Dominion where Commerce is permitted, provided nevertheless that they never exceed the number of six Vessels of War, in the great Ports, and of four in the small Ports, without the express permission of the Governor or Commandant of the District, and that they do not make there a Station, with a view to hurt the Commerce of other Nations in Amity or Alliance with either of the two Contracting Parties.  
  
  
Art: XXVI.  
The two Contracting Parties grant to each other the Liberty of having each in the Ports of the other Consuls, Vice-Consuls, Agents and Commissaries of their own appointment; whose Functions shall be regulated by particular Agreement whenever either Party shall chuse to make such Appointment; but if any such Consuls shall exercise Commerce, they shall be submitted to the same Laws and usages to which the private Individuals of their Nation are Submitted in the same place  
  
  
Art: XXVII  
If either Party shall hereafter grant to any other Nation any particular favour in Navigation or Commerce it shall immediatly become common to the other Party, freely where it is freely granted to  
  
such other Nation, or on yielding the Compensation, where such Nation does the same.  
  
  
Art XXVIII  
Her Most Faithful Majesty the Queen of Portugal and the Algarves and the United States of America agree that this Treaty shall be in force during the term of Ten years from the exchange of Ratifications, (and the Ratifications shall be within the space of one year after the signature, or earlier if possible) and if the expiration of that term should happen during the Course of a War between them, then the Articles twenty third and twenty fourth, before provided, for the regulation of their conduct during such a War shall continue in force untill the conclusion of the Treaty, which shall reestablish Peace: and that this Treaty shall be Ratified on both sides, and the Ratifications exchanged within one year from the Day of its signature, or sooner, if possible  
In faith whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have Signed the above Articles, both in the Portuguese and English Languages; and they have thereto affixed their Seals.  
Done at London this Twenty fifth day of April, one thousand seven Hundred and eighty six.
