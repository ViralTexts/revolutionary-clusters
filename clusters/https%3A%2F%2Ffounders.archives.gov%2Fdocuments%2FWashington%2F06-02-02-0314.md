Dear Sir,  
Mount Vernon 13th July 1798  
  
I had the honour on the evening of the 11th instant to receive from the hands of the Secretary of War, your favour of the 7th announcing that you had with the advice and consent of the Senate appointed me “Lieutenant General and Commander in Chief of all the armies raised, or to be raised for the Service of the U. S.”  
I cannot express how greatly affected I am at this New proof of public confidence, and the highly flattering manner in which you have been pleased to make the communication; at the sametime I must not conceal from you my earnest wish, that the choice had fallen upon a man less declined in years and better qualified to encounter the usual vicissitudes of War.  
You know, Sir, what calculation I had made relative to the probable course of events, on my retiring from Office, and the determination I had consoled myself with, of closing the remnant of my  
  
days in my present peaceful abode; you will therefore be at no loss to conceive and appreciate, the Sensations I must have experienced, to bring my mind to any conclusion, that would pledge me, at so late a period of life, to leave Scenes I sincerely love, to enter upon the boundless field of public action—incessant trouble—and high responsibility.  
It was not possible for me to remain ignorant of, or indifferent to, recent transactions. The conduct of the Directory of France towards our Country; their insiduous hostility to its Government; their various practices to withdraw the affections of the People from it; the evident tendency of their acts and those of their Agents to countenance and invigorate opposition; their disregard of solemn treaties and the laws of Nations; their war upon our defenceless Commerce; their treatment of our Ministers of Peace, and their demands amounting to tribute, could not fail to excite in me corresponding sentiments with those my countrymen have so generally expressed in their affectionate addresses to you. Believe me, Sir, no one can more cordially approve of the wise and prudent measures of your Administration. They ought to inspire universal confidence, and will no doubt, combined with the state of things call from Congress such laws &amp; means as will enable you to meet the full force and extent of the Crisis.  
Satisfied therefore, that you have sincerely wished and endeavoured to avert war, and exhausted to the last drop, the cup of reconciliation, we can with pure hearts appeal to Heaven for the justice of our cause, and may confidently trust the final result to that kind Providence who has heretofore, and so often, signally favoured the People of these United States.  
Thinking in this manner, and feeling how incumbent it is upon every person, of every description, to contribute at all times to his Countrys welfare, and especially in a moment like the present, when every thing we hold dear &amp; Sacred is so seriously threatned, I have finally determined to accept the Commission of Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States, with the reserve only, that I shall not be called into the field until the Army is in a Situation to require my presence, or it becomes indispensible by the urgency of circumstances.  
In making this reservation, I beg it to be understood that I do not mean to withhold any assistance to arrange and organise the  
  
Army, which you may think I can afford. I take the liberty also to mention, that I must decline having my acceptance considered as drawing after it any immediate charge upon the Public, or that I can receive any emoluments annexed to the appointment, before entering into a Situation to incur expence.  
The Secretary of War being anxious to return, to the Seat of Government, I have detained him no longer than was necessary to a full communication upon the several points he had in charge. With very great respect and consideration I have the honor to be Dear Sir Your Most Obedt Hble Sert

D f. a r Sir,  
  
I had the honor on the evening of  
the 1 ithir.lt, to receive from the hand  
of the fecretary of war. your favor of  
the 7th, announcing that you had.  
with the advice and confent of rhe fe-  
nate, appointed me &quot; lieutenant-ge-  
neral and commander in chief &quot;of all  
the armies raifed or to be railed foi  
the fsrvice of the United Srate.1.&quot;  
  
I cannot exprefs how greatly aiTecl-  
ed I am at this new proflp&#x27;cf public  
confidence, and the highly flattering  
manner in which yon have been plea-  
fed to make the communication ; at the  
fame time I mult not conceal from yen  
my earnell wiih, that the choice had  
fallen upon .a man lefs declined in  
years, and better qualified to encoun-  
ter the ufnal vfciffitndes of war.  
  
You know, Sir, what calculation I  
had made relative ro the probable  
courfe of events, on my retiring from  
office and the determinarion I had cmi-  
foled myfelf with, of doling the rem-  
nantoftny days in my prefent peace,

treatiesand the laws, of nations ; ihcir  
war upon our detencelels conmieice ;  
their treatment of our minilfers 6E  
peace ; and their demands amounting  
to tribute ; could not fail to excite in  
me correfponding fentiments with,  
thefe my countrymen have fo gene-  
rally exprelled in their affectionate  
uddrefles to you. Believe me, Sir  
no one can more cordially approve of  
the wife and prudent meafures of your  
adminiflratiou. 1 hey ought to inipiro  
univerfal confidence,- and Will, r&gt; 0  
doubt, combined with the Hate 0 f  
things, call from congrefs fuch laws  
and means as will enable you to meet  
the force and extent of ihe ciifts.  
  
Satisfied, therefore, that yon have  
lincerely wilhed and endeavored ro  
^ avert war, and exhaufted, to the lalt  
drop, the cup ot reconciliation, we  
can with pure hearts appeal to Hea-  
en for the juflice of our caufe ; and  
may confidently trull the final 1 efblt to  
hat kind providence who has hereto,  
tore, and lo often, fignally favored the*  
people of thefe United States.  
  
Thinking in tim manner, and feel-  
ing how incumbent it is upon every  
perfon. of every description, to con-  
tiibuteat all times to his Ooontry&#x27;fl  
welfare, and efpecially in a moment  
like rhe prefent, w hen every thing we  
Isold dear and lacred is fo lenoufly  
ilneatened, I have finally dererinined]  
to accept the coinmilfion of Command-  
er in Chief of the Armies of the Unit-  
ed States ; with the referve only, that  
I lhall not be called into the field until  
the army is in a lunation to require  
my pretence, or it becomes indifpen-  
l&#x27;able by the urc,ency of circnmllances.  
  
In making this refervation, I beg it  
to be underltood, that I do not mean  
to withhold any aliillance to arrang©  
and organize the army, which yorj  
may think I can afford. 1 take the li-  
berty alio to mentioit, that I mult de-  
cline having my acceptance conliilered  
as drawing after it any immediate  
charge upon the public ; or that I cam  
receive any emoluments annexed to  
the appointment before entering inco&gt;  
a fituation to incur expence./  
  
The fecretary ot w ar being anxious)  
to return to the feat of government, I  
have detained him no longer than u ae  
neceffary to a full communication up-  
on the feveral points he had in charge.

with General Washington upon the several  
points he had In charge,” he returned to Phila­  
delphia bearing Washington&#x27;s reply to the  
President. In this 1-tter to Mr. Adams Wash­  
ington writes: “Feeling how incumbent it is  
upon every person of every description to con­  
tribute at ali times to his country’s welfare,  
and especially in a moment like tte present,  
when everything we hold dear is so seriously  
threatened, I have finally determined to accept  
the commission of Oommander-in-Chief of tha  
armies of the United States; with the reserve  
only, that I shall not be called into the field  
until the army is in a situation to require my  
pr- sence, or it becomes indispensable by  
the urgency of circumstances.  
“In making this reservation, I beg to be un­  
derstood that I do not mean to withhold any  
assistance to arrange and organize the army,  
which you may think I can afford I take the  
liberty, also, to mention that I must decline  
having my acceptance considered as drawing  
after it any immediate charge upon the pub­  
lic. and that I cannot receive any emoluments  
annexed to the appointment, before entering  
into a situation to incur expense.

FRIDAY, JULY 13.  
  
At Mount Vernon: “I had the honor, on the evening of  
the 11 instant, to receive from the hands of the Secretary  
of War? your favor of the 7th. announcing that you had,  
with the advice and consent of the Senate, appointed me

proof of public confidence, and the highly flattering manner  
in which you have been pleased to make the communication ;  
at the same time I must not conceal from you my earnest  
wish, that the choice had fallen on a man less declined in  
years, and better qualified to encounter the usual vicissitudes  
of war.” — Washington to John Adams, President of the United

In continuing this letter, Washington said, ‘‘ It was not possible for me  
to remain ignorant of, or indifferent to recent transactions. The conduct of  
the Directory of France towards our country, their insidious hostilities to  
its government, their various practices to withdraw the affections of the  
people from it, the evident tendency of their arts and those of their agents  
to countenance and invigorate opposition, their disregard of solemn treaties  
and the laws of nations, their war upon our defenceless commerce, their  
treatment of our minister of peace, and their demands amounting to tribute,  
could not fail to excite in me corresponding sentiments with those, which  
my countrymen have so generally expressed in their affectionate addresses to  
you. Believe me, Sir, no one can more cordially approve of the wise and  
prudent measures of your administration. They ought to inspire universal  
confidence, and will no doubt, combined with the state of things, call from  
Congress such laws and means, as will enable you to meet the full force and  
extent of the crisis.  
  
“Satisfied, therefore, that you have sincerely wished and endeavoured to  
avert war, and exhausted to the last drop the cup of reconciliation, we can  
with pure hearts appeal to Heaven for the justice of our cause, and may  
confidently trust the final result to that kind Providence, which has hereto-  
fore and so often signally favored the people of these United States.  
  
‘‘ Thinking in this manner and feeling how incumbent it is upon every  
person of every description to contribute at all times to his country’s welfare,  
and especially in a moment like the present, when every thing we hold dear  
is so seriously threatened, I have finally determined to accept the commis-
