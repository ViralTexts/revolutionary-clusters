our own Sex first: Let the first Volley of your Resentments be directed against Female Vice; let Female Idleness, Ignorance and Folly, (which are Vices more peculiar to your Sex than to our’s,) be the Subject of your Satyrs, but more especially Female Pride, which I think is intollerable. Here is a large Field that wants Cultivation, and which I believe you are able (if willing) to improve with Advantage; and when you have once reformed the Women, you will find it a much easier Task to reform the Men, because Women are the prime Causes of a great many Male Enormities.

y the Sweat of his own Brows? And if a Man will be so fond and so foolish, as to labour hard himself for a Livelihood, and suffer his Wife in the mean Time to sit in Ease and Idleness, let him not blame her if she does so, for it is in a great Measure his own Fault.  
And now for the Ignorance and Folly which he reproaches us with, let us see (if we are Fools and Ignoramus’s) whose is the Fault, the Men’s or our’s. An ingenious Writer, having this Subject in Hand, has the following Words, wherein he lays the Fault wholly on the Men, for not allowing Women the Advantages of Education.  
“I have (says he) often thought of it as one of the most barbarous Customs in the World, considering us as a civiliz’d and Christian Country, that we deny the Advantages of Learning to Women. We reproach the Sex every Day with Folly and Impertinence, while I am confident, had they the Advantages of Education equal to us, they would be guilty of less than our selves. One would wonder indeed how it should happen that Women are conversible at all, since they are only beholding to natural Parts for all their Knowledge. Their Youth is spent to teach them to stitch and sew, or make Baubles: They are taught to read indeed, and perhaps to write their Names, or so; and that is the Heighth of a Womans Education. And I would but ask any who slight the Sex for their Understanding, What is a Man (a Gentleman, I mean) good for that is taught no more? If Knowledge and Understanding had been useless Additions to the Sex, God Almighty would never have given them Capacities, for he made nothing Needless. What has the Woman done to forfeit the Priviledge of being taught? Does she plague us with her Pride and Impertinence? Why did we not let her learn, that she might have had more Wit? Shall we upbraid Women with Folly, when ’tis only the Error of this inhumane Custom that hindred them being made wiser.”

y truly, if Women are proud, it is certainly owing to the Men still; for if they will be such Simpletons as to humble themselves at their Feet, and fill their credulous Ears with extravagant Praises of their Wit, Beauty, and other Accomplishments (perhaps where there are none too,) and when Women are by this Means perswaded that they are Something more than humane, what Wonder is it, if they carry themselves haughtily, and live extravagantly. Notwithstanding, I believe there are more Instances of extravagant Pride to be found among Men than among Women, and this Fault is certainly more hainous in the former than in the latter.

‘We reproach the sex every day,’ says he, ‘ with folly and impertinence,  
while I am confident had they the advantages of education equal to us,  
they would be guilty of less than ourselves.” He complains that the  
women of his time were taught merely the mechanical parts of knowl-  
edge—such as reading, writing, and sewing—instead of being exalted  
into rational companions ; and he argues that men in the same class of  
society would cut a sorry figure if their education were to be equally  
neglected. ‘The soul,’ he observes, ‘ was placed in the body like a  
rough diamond, and must be polished, or the lustre will never appear.  
And it is manifest, that as the rational soul distinguishes us from  
brutes, so education carries on the distinction, and makes some less

The Education of Women.  
BY DANIEL DEFOE.  
I have often thought of it as one  
of the most barbarous customs in  
the world, considering us as a civil­  
ized and Christian country, that we  
deny the advantages of learning to  
women. We reproach the sex every  
day with folly and impertinence;  
while I am confident, had they the  
advantages of education equal to us,  
they would be guilty of less than  
ourselves.  
One would wonder, indeed, how it  
should happen that women are con­  
versible at all since they are only  
beholden to natural parts for all  
their knowledge. Their youth is  
spent to teach them to stitch and  
sew, or make baubles. They are  
taught to read, indeed, and perhaps  
to write their names or so; and that  
is the height of a woman’s educa­  
tion. And I would but ask any who  
Blight the sex for their understand­  
ing, what is a man (a gentleman, I  
mean) good for that is taught no  
more? I need not give instances

parts, and examine what figure he  
makes for want of education.  
The soul is placed in the body  
like a rough diamond, and must be  
polished, or the lustre of it will nev­  
er appear. And ’tis manifest that,  
as the rational soul distinguishes us  
from brutes, so education carries on  
the distinction, and makes some less  
brutish than others. This is too  
evident to need any demonstration.  
But why, then, should women be de­  
nied the benefit of instruction ? If  
knowledge and understanding had  
been useless additions to the sex,  
God Almighty would never have  
given them capacities ; for he made  
nothing needless. Besides, I would  
ask such what they can see in igno­  
rance that they should think it a  
necessary ornament to a woman ?  
Or how much worse is a wise woman  
than a fool ? Or what has the wo­  
man done to forfeit the privilege of  
being taught? Does she plague us  
with her pride and impertinence ?  
Why did we not let her learn, that  
she might have had more wit ?  
Shall we upbraid women with folly,  
when ’tis only the error of this in­  
human custom that hindered them  
from being made wiser ?

In the last half century this dream  
has taken shape, and become a reali­  
ty; and, among the many retrospects  
called forth by the approaching end  
of the century and the celebration  
of the sixty years’ jubilee, this great  
change in women’s life and educa­  
tion cannot be overlooked.  
Tennyson’s pretty lines are often  
quoted as though they were the first  
suggestion of the kind in literature,  
but that is hardly correct. An ear­  
lier and more serious allusion to the  
subject may be found in Defoe’s  
“Essay on Projects,” where he intro­  
duces his scheme by remarking: “I  
have often thought of it as one of  
the most barbarous customs in the

ish as to labour hard himself fora Livelihood,  
and suffer his Wife in the mean Time to sit  
in Ease and Id!eness, let him not blame her  
if she does so, for it is in a great Measure

fault is “wholly on the Men, for not allow-

Pride: “truly, if Women are proud, it is cer-
