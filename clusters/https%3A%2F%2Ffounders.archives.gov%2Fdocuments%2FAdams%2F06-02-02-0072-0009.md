wise. How then do we New Englandmen derive our laws? I say, not from parliament, not from common law, but from the law of nature and the compact made with the king in our charters. Our ancestors were intitled to the common law of England, when they emigrated, that is, to just so much of it as they pleased to adopt, and no more. They were not bound or obliged to submit to it, unless they chose it.

t our ancestors, when they emigrated, having obtained permission of the king to come here, and being never commanded to return into the realm, had a clear right to have erected in this wilderness a British constitution, or a perfect democracy, or any other form of government they saw fit. They indeed, while they lived, could not have taken arms against the king of England, without violating their allegiance, but their children would not have been born within the king’s allegiance, would not have been natural subjects, and consequently not intitled to protection, or bound to the king.

 get rid of them. He is conscious, that America must be a part of the realm, before it can be bound by the authority of parliament; and therefore is obliged to suggest, that we are annexed to the realm, and to endeavour to confuse himself and his readers, by confounding the realm, with the empire and dominions.  
But will any man soberly contend, that America was ever annexed to the realm? To what realm? When New-England was settled, there was a realm of England, a realm of Scotland, and a realm of Ireland. To which of these three realms was New England annexed? To the realm of England, it will be said. But by what law? No territory could be annexed to the realm of England, but by an act of parliament. Acts of parliament have been passed to annex Wales, &amp;c. &amp;c. to the realm. But none ever passed to annex America. But if New-England was annexed to the realm of England, how came she annexed to the realm of or kingdom of Great-Britain? The two realms of England and Scotland were by the act of union incorporated into one kingdom by the name of Great-Britain: But there is not one word about America in that act.  
Besides, if America was annexed to the realm, or a part of the kingdom, every act of parliament that is made, would extend to it, named or not named. But every body knows that every act of parliament, and every other record, constantly distinguishes between this kingdom, and his Majesty’s other dominions. Will it be said that Ireland is annex’d to the realm, or a part of the kingdom of Great-Britain? Ireland is a distinct kingdom or realm by itself, notwithstanding British parliament claims a right of binding it in all cases, and exercises it in some. And even so the Massachusetts is a realm, New-York is a realm, Pennsylvania another realm, to all intents and purposes, as much as Ireland is, or England or Scotland ever were. The king of Great B

But says this writer, “if that authority was vested in the person of the king in a different capacity, the British constitution and laws are out of the question, and the king must be absolute as to us, as his prerogatives have never been limitted.”—Not the prerogative limited in our charters, when in every one of them all the rights of Englishmen are secured to us! Are not the rights of Englishmen sufficiently known, and are not the prerogatives of the king’s among those rights?  
As to those colonies which are destitute of charters, the commissions to their governors have ever been considered as equivalent securities both for property, jurisdiction and privileges, with charters; and as to the power of the crown being absolute in those colonies, it is absolute no where. There is no fundamental or other law, that makes a king of England absolute any where, except in conquered countries, and an attempt to assume such a power, by the fundamental laws, forfeits the princes right even to the limited crown.

ited, and were actually forfeited, the only consequence would be, that the king would have no power over them at all: He would not be bound to protect the people, nor, that I can see, would the people here, who were born here, be by any principle of common law, bound even to allegiance to the king. The connection would be broken between the crown and the natives of the country.  
It has been a great dispute whether charters granted within the realm, can be forfeited at all. It was a question debated with infinite learning, in the case of the charter of London: it was adjudged forfeited, in an arbitrary reign: but afterwards, after the revolution, it was declared in parliament, not forfeited, and by an act of parliament made incapable of forfeiture. The charter of Massachusetts was declared forfeited too. So were other American charters. The Massachusetts alone, were tame enough to give it up. But no American charter will ever be decreed forfeited again, or if any should, the decree will be regarded no more, than a vote of the lower house of the robbinhood society. The court of chancery has no authority without the realm; by common law, surely it has none in America. What! The privileges of millions of Americans depend on the discretion of a lord chancellor? God forbid! The passivity of this colony in receiving the present charter in lieu of

f he knew nothing of that period. In his attempt to trace the denial of the supreme authority of the parliament, he commits such mistakes, as a man of age at that time ought to blush at. He says, that “when the stamp-act was made the authority of parliament to impose external taxes, or in other words to lay duties upon goods and merchandize was admitted,” and that when the tea act was made, “a new distinction was set up, that parliament had a right to lay duties upon merchandize, for the purpose of regulating trade, but not for the purpose of raising a revenue.” This is a total misapprehension of the declared opinions of people at those times.

This is esteemed a grievance inasmuch as the same are laid, without the consent of the representatives of the colonists. It is esteemed an essential British right, that no person shall be subject to any tax; but what in person, or by his representative, he hath a voice in laying.” Here is a tax unquestionably external, in the sense in which that word is used in the distinction that is made by some between external and inte

r sneers at the distinction between a right to lay the former duty of a shilling on the pound of tea, and the right to lay the three pence. But is there not a real difference between laying a duty to be paid in England upon exportation, and to be paid in America upon importation? Is there not a difference between parliament’s laying on duties within their own realm, where they have undoubtedly jurisdiction, and laying them out of their realm, nay laying them on in our realm, where we say they have no jurisdiction? Let them lay on what duties they please in England, we have nothing to say against that.

“There is no possible medium between absolute independence and subjection to the authority of parliament.” If this is true, it may be depended upon that all North America are as fully convinced of their independence, their absolute independence, as they are of their own existence, and as fully determined to defend it at all hazards, as Great Britain is to defend her independence, against foreign nations. But it is not true. An absolute independence on parliament, in all internal concerns and cases of taxation, is very compatible with an absolute dependence on it in all cases of external commerce.

“To deny the supreme authority of the state, is a high misdemeanor; to oppose it by force, an overt act of treason.” True: and therefore Massachusettensis, who denies the king represented by his governor, his majesty’s council, by charter, and house of representatives, to be the supreme authority of this province, has been guilty of a high misdemeanour: and those ministers, governors, and their instruments, who have brought a military force here, and employed it against that supreme authority, are guilty of  and ought to be punished with .

- It is curious indeed to trace the denial and  
Oppugnation to the supreme Authority of the  
State. When the Stamp-A¢t was made, the  
Authority of Parliament to impose internal  
Taxes was denyed, but their Right to im%cfe  
external ones ;or in other Words, to lay Du­  
ties upon Goods andMerchandize was admit­  
t¢ed. When the A¢t was made imposing Du­  
ties upon Tea, &amp;c. a new Diftinétion was set  
up that theParliament had 2 Right to lay Du­  
ties upon Merchandize for the Purpose of re­  
gulating Trade, but not the Purpofé of raising  
a Revenue : That is, the Pariiament had good  
Right and lawful Authority to lay the former  
Duty of a Shilling on the Pound, but had  
none to lay the present Duty of three Pence.  
et e e Faving got thus far  
fafe, it was only taking one Step more to ex­  
fricate ourselves entirely from their Fangs, &amp;  
become independent States ; that our Patriots  
most heroically resolved upon, and flatly de­  
nied that Parliament had a Right to make  
any Laws whatever, that should be binding  
upon the Colonies. ‘FHlere is no pofiible Me­  
dium between absolute Independance &amp; Sub­  
jeétion to the Authority of Parliament. He  
must be blind indeed that can’t fee our dearest  
Interest in the latter notwithstanding many  
pant after the former, misguided Men ! Could  
they once overtake their With, they would be  
convinced of theMadnefs of the Pursuit. My  
dear Countrymen, it is of the last Importance  
that we fettle this Point clearly in our Minds;  
it will serve as 2 fureTeft, certain Criterion, &amp;  
invariable Standard to distinguish the Friends  
from the Enemies of our Country, Patriotism  
from Sedition, Loyalty from Rebellion. To  
deny the supreme Authority of the State is a 2  
high Misdemeanor to fay no Worse of it ; to  
oppose it by Force is an overt Act of Freafon,  
punifthable by Confifcation of Estate and most

the only consequence would be that the   
king would have no power over us at all.   
The connection would be-broken between   
the &#x27;crown and the,natives of this coun­  
try. The charter df London in an arbi­  
trary reign was decreed forfeited. The   
charter of Massachusetts was declared   
forfeited, also. But no American charter   
will ever be declared forfeited again, or if   
any should, the decree will be regarded   
no more than the lower house of the Ro­

must be a part of the realm in order to be bound by the authority of  
Parliament, must it not ?  
  
Sewall, Certainly.  
  
Adams. I thought so.  
  
But when was America ever annexed tothe realm? Nay, to what  
realm was she ever annexed? When New England was settled a  
couple of centuries ago, there was a realm of England, a realm of  
Scotland, and a realm of Ireland. To which of these three realms  
was New Englandannexed? To the realmof England? Then, by  
what law ?—for no territory can be annexed to England without her  
consent, nor with it without a solemn expression of that consent,  
and a solemn definition of the conditions of annexation ; and all that  
takes an Act of Parliament. Wales was so annexed; but what Act

ever passed to annex America, or any one of the colonies? To the  
realm of Scotland, or to the realm of Ireland? Noone has yet men-  
tioned them, though the absurdity would be no greater. To the  
realm of Great Britain, created since the settlement of New England ?  
But, in the Act of Union, which incorporated England and Scotland  
into one kingdom, by the name of Great Britain, there is not one  
word about America, New England or any colony therein.  
  
Besides, behold the evidence that we are not annexed to the realm  
of England in the Acts of Parliament themselves. If America were  
so annexed, every act of Parliament would extend to her, though  
she were not named in it. But the acts do constantly distinguish be-  
tween the realm and the other dominions of His Majesty—between  
Great Britain and Ireland, between Great Britain and Massachusetts,  
between Great Britain and Pennsylvania, and so on.  
  
Sewall. Then Massachusetts is a realm; New York a realm;  
Pennsylvania a realm !  
  
Adams. Even so; as much as Ireland is a realm now, or Eng-  
land or Scotland ever were. Thus you see that you were not fa
