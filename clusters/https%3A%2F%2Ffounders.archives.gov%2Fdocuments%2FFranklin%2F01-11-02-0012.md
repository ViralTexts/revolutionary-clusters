y and justice. Seldom in his life did Franklin, the rationalist, appeal so little to the reader’s head and so strongly and so warmly to his heart.  
  
A Narrative, &amp;c. [January 30?, 1764]  
These Indians were the Remains of a Tribe of the Six Nations, settled at Conestogoe, and thence called Conestogoe Indians. On the first Arrival of the English in Pennsylvania, Messengers from this Tribe came to welcome them, with Presents of Venison, Corn and Skins; and the whole Tribe entered into a Treaty of Friendship with the first Proprietor, William Penn, which was to last “as long as the Sun should shine, or the Waters run in the Rivers.”  
This Treaty has been since frequently renewed, and the Chain brightened, as they express it, from time to time. It has never been violated, on their Part or ours, till now. As their Lands by Degrees were mostly purchased, and the Settlements of the White People began to surround them, the Proprietor assigned them Lands on the Manor of Conestogoe, which they might not part with; there they have lived many Years in Friendship with their White Neighbours, who loved them for their peaceable inoffensive Behaviour.  
It has always been observed, that Indians, settled in the Neighbourhood of White People, do not increase, but diminish continually. This Tribe accordingly went on diminishing, till there remained in their Town on the Manor, but 20 Persons, viz. 7 Men, 5 Women, and 8 Children, Boys and Girls.  
Of these, Shehaes was a very old Man, having assisted at the second Treaty held with them, by Mr. Penn, in 1701, and ever since continued a faithful and affectionate Friend to the English; he is said to have been an exceeding good Man, considering his Education, being naturally of a most kind benevolent Temper.  
Peggy was Shehaes’s Daughter; she worked for her aged Father, continuing to live with him, though married, and attended him with filial Duty and Tenderness.  
John was another good old Man; his Son Harry helped to support him.  
George and Will Soc were two Brothers, both young Men.  
John Smith, a valuable young Man, of the Cayuga Nation, who became acquainted with Peggy, Shehaes’s Daughter, some few Years since, married her, and settled in that Family. They had one Child, about three Years old.  
Betty, a harmless old Woman; and her Son Peter, a likely young Lad.  
Sally, whose Indian Name was Wyanjoy, a Woman much esteemed by all that knew her, for her prudent and good Behaviour in some very trying Situations of Life. She was a truly good and an amiable Woman, had no Children of her own, but a distant Relation dying, she had taken a Child of that Relation’s, to bring up as her own, and performed towards it all the Duties of an affectionate Parent.  
The Reader will observe, that many of their Names are English. It is common with the Indians that have an Affection for the English, to give themselves, and their Children, the Names of such English Persons as they particularly esteem.  
  
This little Society continued the Custom they had begun, when more numerous, of addressing every new Governor, and every Descendant of the first Proprietor, welcoming him to the Province, assuring him of their Fidelity, and praying a Continuance of that Favour and Protection they had hitherto experienced. They had accordingly sent up an Address of this Kind to our present Governor, on his Arrival; but the same was scarce delivered, when the unfortunate Catastrophe happened, which we are about to relate.  
On Wednesday, the 14th of December, 1763, Fifty-seven Men, from some of our Frontier Townships, who had projected the Destruction of this little Common-wealth, came, all well-mounted, and armed with Firelocks, Hangers and Hatchets, having travelled through the Country in the Night, to Conestogoe Manor. There they surrounded the small Village of Indian Huts, and just at Break of Day broke into them all at once. Only three Men, two Women, and a young Boy, were found at home, the rest being out among the neighbouring White People, some to sell the Baskets, Brooms and Bowls they manufactured, and others on other Occasions. These poor defenceless Creatures were immediately fired upon, stabbed and hatcheted to Death! The good Shehaes, among the rest, cut to Pieces in his Bed. All of them were scalped, and otherwise horribly mangled. Then their Huts were set on Fire, and most of them burnt down. When the Troop, pleased with their own Conduct and Bravery, but enraged that any of the poor Indians had escaped the Massacre, rode off, and in small Parties, by different Roads, went home.  
The universal Concern of the neighbouring White People on hearing of this Event, and the Lamentations of the younger Indians, when they returned and saw the Desolation, and the butchered half-burnt Bodies of their murdered Parents, and other Relations, cannot well be expressed.  
The Magistrates of Lancaster sent out to collect the remaining Indians, brought them into the Town for their better Security against any further Attempt, and it is said condoled with them on the Misfortune that had happened, took them by the Hand, comforted and promised them Protection. They were all put into the Workhouse, a strong Building, as the Place of greatest Safety.  
When the shocking News arrived in Town, a Proclamation was issued by the Governor, in the following Terms, viz.  
“Whereas I have received Information, That on Wednesday, the Fourteenth Day of this Month, a Number of People, armed, and mounted on Horseback, unlawfully assembled together, and went to the Indian Town in the Conestogoe Manor, in Lancaster County, and without the least Reason or Provocation, in cool Blood, barbarously killed six of the Indians settled there, and burnt and destroyed all their Houses and Effects: And whereas so cruel and inhuman an Act, committed in the Heart of this Province on the said Indians, who have lived peaceably and inoffensively among us, during all our late Troubles, and for many Years before, and were justly considered as under the Protection of this Government and its Laws, calls loudly for the

od Save the King.”  
Notwithstanding this Proclamation, those cruel Men again assembled themselves, and hearing that the remaining fourteen Indians were in the Work-house at Lancaster, they suddenly appeared in that Town, on the 27th of December. Fifty of them, armed as before, dismounting, went directly to the Work-house, and by Violence broke open the Door, and entered with the utmost Fury in their Countenances. When the poor Wretches saw they had no Protection nigh, nor could possibly escape, and being without the least Weapon for Defence, they divided into their little Families, the Children clinging to the Parents; they fell on their Knees, protested their Innocence, declared their Love to the English, and that, in their whole Lives, they had never done them Injury; and in this Posture they all received the Hatchet! Men, Women and little Children—were every one inhumanly murdered!—in cold Blood!  
  
The barbarous Men who committed the atrocious Fact, in Defiance of Government, of all Laws human and divine, and to the eternal Disgrace of their Country and Colour, then mounted their Horses, huzza’d in Triumph, as if they had gained a Victory, and rode off—unmolested!  
The Bodies of the Murdered were then brought out and exposed in the Street, till a Hole could be made in the Earth, to receive and cover them.  
But the Wickedness cannot be covered, the Guilt will lie on the whole Land, till Justice is done on the Murderers. The Blood Of The Innocent Will Cry To Heaven For Vengeance.  
It is said that Shehaes, being before told, that it was to be feared some English might come from the Frontier into the Country, and murder him and his People; he replied, “It is impossible: There are Indians, indeed, in the Woods, who would kill me and mine, if they could get at us, for my Friendship to the English; but the English will wrap me in their Matchcoat, and secure me from all Danger.” How unfortunately was he mistaken!  
Another Proclamation has been issued, offering a great Reward for apprehending the Murderers, in the following Terms, viz.

”  
These Proclamations have as yet produced no Discovery; the Murderers having given out such Threatenings against those that disapprove their Proceedings, that the whole County seems to be in Terror, and no one durst speak what he knows; even the Letters from thence are unsigned, in which any Dislike is expressed of the Rioters.  
There are some (I am ashamed to hear it) who would extenuate the enormous Wickedness of these Actions, by saying, “The Inhabitants of the Frontiers are exasperated with the Murder of their Relations, by the Enemy Indians, in the present War.” It is possible; but though this might justify their going out into the Woods, to seek for those Enemies, and avenge upon them those Murders; it can never justify their turning in to the Heart of the Country, to murder their Friends.  
If an Indian injures me, does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all Indians? It is well known that Indians are of different Tribes, Nations and Languages, as well as the White People. In Europe, if the French, who are White-People, should injure the Dutch, are they to revenge it on the English, because they too are White People? The only Crime of these poor Wretches seems to have been, that they had a reddish brown Skin, and black Hair; and some People of that Sort, it seems, had murdered some of our Relations. If it be right to kill Men for such a Reason, then, should any Man, with a freckled Face and red Hair, kill a Wife or Child of mine, it would be right for me to revenge it, by killing all the freckled red-haired Men, Women and Children, I could afterwards any where meet with.  
But it seems these People think they have a better Justification; nothing less than the Word of God. With the Scriptures in their Hands and Mouths, they can set at nought that express Command, Thou shalt do no Murder; and justify their Wickedness, by the Command given Joshua to destroy the Heathen. Horrid Perversion of Scripture and of Religion! to father the worst of Crimes on the God of Peace and Love! Even the Jews, to whom that particular Commission was directed, spared the Gibeonites, on Account of their Faith once given. The Faith of this Government has been frequently given to those Indians; but that did not avail them with People who despise Government.  
We pretend to be Christians, and, from the superior Light we enjoy, ought to exceed Heathens, Turks, Saracens, Moors, Negroes, and Indians, in the Knowledge and Practice of what is right. I will endeavour to show, by a few Examples from Books and History, the Sense those People have had of such Actions.

 Times, supposed to be sent by the Deity to try the Goodness of Men, and that he would avenge the Injuries they might receive, where they ought to have been protected. These Sentiments therefore influenced the Manners of all Ranks of People, even the meanest; for we find that when Ulysses came, as a poor Stranger, to the Hut of Eumaeus, the Swineherd, and his great Dogs ran out to tear the ragged Man, Eumaeus drave them away with Stones; and  
  
  
Unhappy Stranger! (thus the faithful Swain  
Began, with Accent gracious and humane)  
What Sorrow had been mine, if at my Gate  
Thy rev’rend Age had met a shameful Fate?  
------ But enter this my homely Roof, and see  
Our Woods not void of Hospitality.  
He said, and seconding the kind Request,  
With friendly Step precedes the unknown Guest.  
A shaggy Goat’s soft Hide beneath him spread,  
And with fresh Rushes heap’d an ample Bed.  
Joy touch’d the Hero’s tender Soul, to find  
So just Reception from a Heart so kind:  
And oh, ye Gods! with all your Blessings grace  
(He thus broke forth) this Friend of human Race!  
The Swain reply’d. It never was our guise  
To slight the Poor, or aught humane despise.  
For Jove unfolds the hospitable Door,  
Tis Jove that sends the Stranger and the Poor.  
  
These Heathen People thought, that after a Breach of the Rites of Hospitality, a Curse from Heaven would attend them in every thing they did, and even their honest Industry in their Callings would fail of Success.

ut me to Death; Eumaeus rejects the Proposal as what would be attended with both Infamy and Misfortune, saying ironically,  
  
Doubtless, oh Guest! great Laud and Praise were mine,  
If, after social Rites and Gifts bestow’d,  
I stain’d my Hospitable Hearth with Blood.  
How would the Gods my righteous Toils succeed,  
And bless the Hand that made a Stranger bleed?  
No more.——  
  
Even an open Enemy, in the Heat of Battle, throwing down his Arms, submitting to his Foe, and asking Life and Protection, was supposed to acquire an immediate Right to that Protection. Thus one describes his being saved, when his Party was defeated.

My State he pity’d, and my Tears he dry’d;

e that were with him, he commanded the Hands of his own Prisoners to be tied behind them, and then, in a most cruel and brutal Manner, put them to the Sword; but he could not prevail on his Men to massacre their Captives, because in Fight they had laid down their Arms, submitted, and demanded Protection. Mahomet, when the Account was brought to him, applauded the Men for their Humanity; but said to Khaled, with great Indignation, Oh Khaled, thou Butcher, cease to molest me with thy Wickedness. If thou possessedst a Heap of Gold as large as Mount Obod, and shouldst expend it all in God’s Cause, thy Merit would not efface the Guilt incurred by the Murder of the meanest of those poor Captives.  
Among the Arabs or Saracens, though it was lawful to put to Death a Prisoner taken in Battle, if he had made himself obnoxious by his former Wickedness, yet this could not be done after he had once eaten Bread, or drank Water, while in their Hands. Hence we read in the History of the Wars of the Holy Land, that when the Franks had suffered a great Defeat from Saladin, and among the Prisoners were the King of Jerusalem, and Arnold, a famous Christian Captain, who had been very cruel to the Saracens; these two being brought before the Soltan, he placed the King on his right Hand, and Arnold on his left; and then presented the King with a Cup of Water, who immediately drank to Arnold; but when Arnold was about to receive the Cup, the Soltan interrupted, saying, I will not suffer this wicked Man to drink, as that, according to the laudable and generous Custom of the Arabs, would secure him his Life.  
That same laudable and generous Custom still prevails among the Mahometans, appears from the Account but last Year published of his Travels by Mr. Bell of Antermony, who accompanied the Czar Peter the Great, in his Journey to Derbent through Daggestan. “The Religion of the Daggestans, says he, is generally Mahometan, some following the Sect of Osman, others that of Haly. Their Language for the most Part is Turkish, or rather a Dialect of the Arabic, though many of them speak also the Persian Language. One Article I cannot omit concerning their Laws of Hospitality, which is, if their greatest Enemy comes under their Roof for Protection, the Landlord, of what Condition soever, is obliged to keep him safe, from all Manner of Harm or Violence, during his Abode with him, and even to conduct him safely through his Territories to a Place of Security.”  
From the Saracens this same Custom obtained among the Moors of Africa; was by them brought into Spain, and there long sacredly observed. The Spanish Historians record with Applause one famous Instance of it. While the Moors governed there, and the Spaniards were mixed with them, a Spanish Cavalier, in a sudden Quarrel, slew a young Moorish Gentleman, and fled. His Pursuers soon lost Sight of him, for he had, unperceived, thrown himself over a Garden Wall. The Owner, a Moor, happening to be in his Garden, was addressed by the Spaniard on his Knees, who acquainted him with his Case, and implored Concealment. Eat this, said the Moor, giving him Half a Peach; you now know that you may confide in my Protection. He then locked him up in his Garden Apartment, telling him, that as soon as it was Night he would provide for his Escape to a Place of more Safety. The Moor then went into his House, where he had scarce seated himself, when a great Croud, with loud Lamentations, came to his Gate, bringing the Corps of his Son, that had just been killed by a Spaniard. When the first Shock of Surprize was a little over, he learnt, from the Description given, that the fatal Deed was done by the Person then in his Power. He mentioned this to no One; but as soon as it was dark, retired to his Garden Apartment, as if to grieve alone, giving Orders that none should follow him. There accosting the Spaniard, he said, Christian, the Person you have killed, is my Son: His Body is now in my House. You ought to suffer; but you have eaten with me, and I have given you my Faith, which must not be broken. Follow me. He then led the astonished Spaniard to his Stables, mounted him on one of his fleetest Horses, and said, Fly far while the Night can cover you. You will be safe in the Morning. You are indeed guilty of my Son’s Blood, but God is just and good, and I thank him that I am innocent of yours, and that my Faith given is preserved.  
The Spaniards caught from the Moors this Punto of Honour, the Effects of which remain, in a great Degree, to this Day. So that when there is Fear of a War about to break out between England and Spain, an English Merchant there, who apprehends the Confiscation of his Goods as the Goods of an Enemy, thinks them safe, if he can get a Spaniard to take Charge of them; for the Spaniard secures them as his own, and faithfully redelivers them, or pays the Value, whenever the Englishman can safely demand it.  
Justice to that Nation, though lately our Enemies, and hardly yet our cordial Friends, obliges me, on this Occasion, not to omit mentioning an Instance of Spanish Honour, which cannot but be still fresh in the Memory of many yet living. In 1746, when we were in hot War with Spain, the Elizabeth, of London, Captain William Edwards, coming through the Gulph from Jamaica, richly laden, met with a most violent Storm, in which the Ship sprung a Leak, that obliged them, for the Saving of their Lives, to run her into the Havannah. The Captain went on Shore, directly waited on the Governor, told the Occasion of his putting in, and that he surrendered his Ship as a Prize, and himself and his Men as Prisoners of War, only requesting good Quarter. No, Sir, replied the Spanish Governor, If we had taken you in fair War at Sea, or approaching our Coast with hostile Intentions, your Ship would then have been a Prize, and your People Prisoners. But when distressed by a Tempest, you come into our Ports for the Safety of your Lives, we, though Enemies, being Men, are bound as such, by the Laws of Humanity, to afford Relief to distressed Men, who ask it of us. We cannot, even against our Enemies, take Advantage of an Act of God. You have Leave therefore to unload your Ship, if that be necessary, to stop the Leak; you may refit here, and traffick so far as shall be necessary to pay the Charges; you may then depart, and I will give you a Pass, to be in Force till you are beyond Bermuda. If after that you are taken, you will then be a Prize, but now you are only a Stranger, and have a Stranger’s Right to Safety and Protection. The Ship accordingly departed, and arrived safe in London.  
Will it be permitted me to adduce, on this Occasion, an Instance of the like Honour in a poor unenlightened African Negroe. I find it in Capt. Seagrave’s Account of his Voyage to Guinea. He relates that a New-England Sloop, trading there in 1752, left their second Mate, William Murray, sick on Shore, and sailed without him. Murray was at the House of a Black, named Cudjoe, with whom he had contracted an Acquaintance during their Trade. He recovered, and the Sloop being gone, he continued with his black Friend, till some other Opportunity should offer of his getting home. In the mean while, a Dutch Ship came into the Road, and some of the Blacks going on board her, were treacherously seized, and carried off as Slaves. Their Relations and Friends, transported with sudden Rage, ran to the House of Cudjoe to take Revenge, by killing Murray. Cudjoe stopt them at the Door, and demanded what they wanted? The White Men, said they, have carried away our Brothers and Sons, and we will kill all White Men; give us the White Man that you keep in your House, for we will kill him. Nay, said Cudjoe; the White Men that carried away your Brothers are bad Men, kill them when you can catch them; but this White Man is a good Man, and you must not kill him. But he is a White Man, they cried; the White Men are all bad; we will kill them all. Nay, says he, you must not kill a Man, that had done no Harm, only for being white. This Man is my Friend, my House is his Fort, and I am his Soldier. I must fight for him. You must kill me, before you can kill him. What good Man will ever come again under my Roof, if I let my Floor be stained with a good Man’s Blood! The Negroes seeing his Resolution, and being convinced by his Discourse that they were wrong, went away ashamed. In a few Days Murray ventured abroad again with Cudjoe, when several of them took him by the Hand, and told him they were glad they had not killed him; for as he was a good (meaning an innocent) Man, their God would have been angry, and would have spoiled their Fishing. I relate this, says Captain Seagrave, to show, that some among these dark People have a strong Sense of Justice and Honour, and that even the most brutal among them are capable of feeling the Force of Reason, and of being influenced by a Fear of God (if the Knowledge of the true God could be introduced among them) since even the Fear of a false God, when their Rage subsided, was not without its good Effect.  
Now I am about to mention something of Indians, I beg that I may not be understood as framing Apologies for all Indians. I am far from desiring to lessen the laudable Spirit of Resentment in my Countrymen against those now at War with us, so far as it is justified by their Perfidy and Inhumanity. I would only observe that the Six Nations, as a Body, have kept Faith with the English ever since we knew them, now near an Hundred Years; and that the governing Part of those People have had Notions of Honour, whatever may be the Case with the Rum-debauched, Trader-corrupted Vagabonds and Thieves on Sasquehannah and the Ohio, at present in Arms against us. As a Proof of that Honour, I shall only mention one well-known recent Fact. When six Catawba Deputies, under the Care of Colonel Bull, of Charlestown, went by Permission into the Mohawks Country, to sue for and treat of Peace for their Nation, they soon found the Six Nations highly exasperated, and the Peace at that Time impracticable: They were therefore in Fear for their own Persons, and apprehended that they should be killed in their Way back to New-York; which being made known to the Mohawk Chiefs, by Colonel Bull, one of them, by Order of the Council, made this Speech to the Catawbas:  
“Strangers and Enemies,  
“While you are in this Country, blow away all Fear out of your Breasts; change the black Streak of Pain on your Cheek for a red One, and let your Faces shine with Bear’s-Grease: You are safer here than if you were at home. The Six Nations will not defile their own Land with the Blood of Men that come unarmed to ask for Peace. We shall send a Guard with you, to see you safe out of our Territories. So far you shall have Peace, but no farther. Get home to your own Country, and there take Care of yourselves, for there we intend to come and kill you.”  
The Catawbas came away unhurt accordingly.  
It is also well known, that just before the late War broke out, when our Traders first went among the Piankeshaw Indians, a Tribe of the Twightwees, they found the Principle of giving Protection to Strangers in full Force; for the French coming with their Indians to the Piankeshaw Town, and demanding that those Traders and their Goods should be delivered up; the Piankeshaws replied, the English were come there upon their Invitation, and they could not do so base a Thing. But the French insisting on it, the Piankeshaws took Arms in Defence of their Guests, and a Number of them, with their old Chief, lost their Lives in the Cause; the French at last prevailing by superior Force only.

One Hundred and Forty peaceable Indians yet remain in this Government. They have, by Christian Missionaries, been brought over to a Liking, at least, of our Religion; some of them lately left their Nation which is now at War with us, because they did not chuse to join with them in their Depredations; and to shew their Confidence in us, and to give us an equal Confidence in them, they have brought and put into our Hands their Wives and Children. Others have lived long among us in Northampton County, and most of their Children have been born there. These are all now trembling for their Lives. They have been hurried from Place to Place for Safety, now concealed in Corners, then sent out of the Province, refused a Passage through a neighbouring Colony, and returned, not unkindly perhaps, but disgracefully, on our Hands. O Pennsylvania! once renowned for Kindness to Strangers, shall the Clamours of a few mean Niggards about the Expence of this Publick Hospitality, an Expence that will not cost the noisy Wretches Sixpence a Piece (and what is the Expence of the poor Maintenance we afford them, compared to the Expence they might occasion if in Arms against us) shall so senseless a Clamour, I say, force you to turn out of your Doors these unhappy Guests, who have offended their own Country-folks by their Affection for you, who, confiding in your Goodness, have put themselves under your Protection? Those whom you have disarmed to satisfy groundless Suspicions, will you leave them exposed to the armed Madmen of your Country? Unmanly Men! who are not ashamed to come with Weapons against the Unarmed, to use the Sword against Women, and the Bayonet against young Children; and who have already given such bloody Proofs of their Inhumanity and Cruelty. Let us rouze ourselves, for Shame, and redeem the Honour of our Province from the Contempt of its Neighbours; let all good Men join heartily and unanimously in Support of the Laws, and in strengthening the Hands of Government; that Justice may be done, the Wicked punished, and the Innocent protected; otherwise we can, as a People, expect no Blessing from Heaven, there will be no Security for our Persons or Properties; Anarchy and Co

nfusion will prevail over all, and Violence, without Judgment, dispose of every Thing.  
When I mention the Baseness of the Murderers, in the Use they made of Arms, I cannot, I ought not to forget, the very different Behaviour of brave Men and true Soldiers, of which this melancholy Occasion has afforded us fresh Instances. The Royal Highlanders have, in the Course of this War, suffered as much as any other Corps, and have frequently had their Ranks thinn’d by an Indian Enemy; yet they did not for this retain a brutal undistinguishing Resentment against all Indians, Friends as well as Foes. But a Company of them happening to be here, when the 140 poor Indians above mentioned were thought in too much Danger to stay longer in the Province, chearfully undertook to protect and escort them to New-York, which they executed (as far as that Government would permit the Indians to come) with Fidelity and Honour; and their Captain Robinson, is justly applauded and honoured by all

General Gage, too, has approved of his Officer’s Conduct, and, as I hear, ordered him to remain with the Indians at Amboy, and continue his Protection to them, till another Body of the King’s Forces could be sent to relieve his Company, and escort their Charge back in Safety to Philadelphia, where his Excellency has had the Goodness to direct those Forces to remain for some Time, under the Orders of our Governor, for the Security of the Indians; the Troops of this Province being at present necessarily posted on the Frontier. Such just and generous Actions endear the Military to the Civil Power, and impress the Minds of all the Discerning with a still greater Respect for our national Government. I shall conclude with observing, that Cowards can handle Arms, can strike where they are sure to meet with no Return, can wound, mangle and murder; but it belongs to brave Men to spare, and to protect; for, as the Poet says,

HESE Indians ‘were the remains  
  
of a tribe of the Six Nations, fet-  
  
‘tled at Coneflogoe, and thence called &#x27;Co-  
neflocoe Indians.’ On the firft arrival of  
  
the Englifo in, Peunfylvania, meflengers  
  
from this tribe came td welcome them  
  
with prefents of venifon, corn, and  
  
fkins, and the whole tribe entered in-  
  
to a treaty of friendftiip with the firt g  
  
wera Wm Penn, which was to  
alt, ‘as longas thé fun fhould thine,  
** or the waters run in the rivers.”  
This treaty has been fince frequently  
renewed, and the ‘chain brightened, as  
they exprefs it, from time to time, ~ It  
has never heen violated, on their part  
or ours till now. As their lands ‘by  
degrees were moftly purchafed, and the  
fettlements of the white le began  
to furround&#x27;them, the proprietor af-  
figned them lands on the manor of Co-  
neflogoe, which they might not part  
with ; there they have lived many  
years in friendfhip with their white  
neighbours, who loved them for their  
peaceable inoffenfive behaviour.  
It has always been obferved, that  
Indians, fettled in the neighbourhood  
of White People, do not increafe but  
diminith continually, This tribe ac-  
cordingly went on diminifhing till.

From the Saracens this fame cuttomy  
obtained among the Moors of Africa,  
w s by them a into Spam, aud  
there long facredly obierved, The  
Spani/b hittorians record with applaule  
one tamous inftance of it. While the  
Moors governed there, and the Spant-  
ards were mixed with them, a | ge  
cavalier, in a fudden quarrel, flew a  
young Moorifb gentleman and fled. His  
purfuers foon lott fight of him, for he  
had, unperccived, thrown himfe!f o-  
ver a garden wall. The owner, aMoor,  
happening to be in his garden, was  
addrefied by the Spaniard on his knees,  
who acquainted him with his cale, and  
implored concealment. ‘Eat this, faid  
the Moor, giving him half a peach ; you  
now know that you may confide in m  
  
rotefion. He then locked tim up in  
fis garden apartment, tclling him,  
that as foon as it was night, he would  
provide for his efcape to a place of  
more fafety———-T he Moor then went  
into his houfe, where he had fcarce  
feated himfelf, when a great croud,  
with loud lamentations, ¢ame to his  
gate, bringing the corps of his fon,  
that had juft been killed by a Spani-  
ard. When the firtt thock of furprize  
was a little over, he learnt, from the  
deicription given, that the fatal deed  
was done by the perfon then in his  
  
ower. He mentioned this to no one ;  
  
ut as foon as it was daik, retired to  
his garden apartment, as if to gr&#x27;eve  
alone, giving orde:s that none thould  
follow him. There accofting the Spa-  
n urd, he faid, Chriflian, the perfen you  
have killed, is my yon: His body is now in  
my houfe. You ought to fuffer; but you  
bave eaten with me, and I have given  
you my faith, which mufi not be broken.—  
Follow me.—He then led the aftonithed  
Spaniard to his ftables, mounted him  
on one of his fleetett horfes, and faid,  
Fly far while the night can cover you.  
Yiu wil! be fafe inthe morning. You ae  
indeed guilty ri my fon&#x27;s blood, but God is  
  
is _preferved.  
‘The Spaniards caught from the Moors  
  
this puxto of honour, the effects of ,  
  
which remain, in a great degree, to  
this day. Sv that when there is fear  
of a war about to break out between  
England and Spain, an Englifh merchant  
there, who apprehends the connfca-  
tion of his good as the goods of an  
enemy, thinks them fafe, if he can get  
a Spaniard to take charge of them; for  
the Spaniard fecures them as his own,  
and faithfully re-delivers them,or pays  
the value, whenever the Eugli/iman  
can fafely demand it.  
  
Juitice to that nation, though Jately,  
  
our enemies, and hardly yet our cor-  
dial friends, obliges me, on this occa-  
fion, not to.omit mentioning an in-  
ttance of Spani/b honour, which cannot  
be but itiil freth in the memory of ma-  
ny yet living. In 1746, when we were  
in hot war. with Spaz, the Elizabeih,  
of London, Captain William Edwards,  
coming thro’ the Guiph fi. m Jamaica,  
richly laden, met with a moft violent  
ftorm, in v hich the thip fprung a leak,  
that obiiged them, for the faving of  
their lives, to run her into the Ha-  
D wannab. The captain went on fhore,  
directly waired on the governor, to&#x27;d  
the occafion of his putting in, aid  
that he furrendered the fhip as a  
prize, and himielf and his men as  
pritoners of war, only requefting good  
quarter. No, Sir, replied the Spanifh,  
governor, if we badtaken you in fair war  
at yea, or approaching our coafi with bof-  
tue intentions, your foip would then have  
been a prize, and your people prifaners.  
But when difireffed by a tempefl, you come  
into our ports for the fafety of your lives,  
ur, though enemies, being men, are bound  
F as juch, by the laws of humanity. to af-  
Sard relief to diftrefed men, who afk it of  
us. We cannot, even againf our enemits,  
take advantage of an a&amp; of God. You  
have leave therejore to unload your jbip,  
¥f that be neceffary, to flop the at yaw  
may refit bere, and treffak fojar as joall  
be necefjary to pay the charges ; you may  
then depart, and I will give you a pafs,  
to be in gorce till you are beyond Bermuda.  
If after that jou are tuken, you will then  
ea prize, but now you are only a firan-  
ger, and havea flranger&#x27;s right to fafety  
aud proteclion —The thip accordingly,  
departed, and arrived fafe at London.

quaintance during their trade. He re-  
coverd, and the tioop being gone, he  
continued. with his black -friend,): till  
fome vther opportunity fhould offer of  
his getting home. In the mean while,’  
a Dutch fhip came into the road, and  
fome of the blacks going on board her,  
were treacheroully feized, and carried  
off as flaves. Their relations and  
friends, tran{ported with fudden rage,  
ran to the houle of Cudjoe to take re-  
venge, by killing Murray. Cudjoe ttopt  
them at the door, and demanded what  
they wanted? The white men,, lard  
  
they, have carried away our brothers  
and fons, and we will kill all white  
  
men ;—give us the white manthat you  
keep in your houfe, for we wiil kill

that carried away your brothers are bad  
men, kill them wehen you can catch them ;  
  
but this white manis a good man, and you  
  
muft not kill bim.—But he is a white  
  
If. man, they cried; the white men are  
  
allbad; we will kill them all. —Nay,  
fays he, you muft not kill a man that bas  
done no harm, only for being white. This  
man is my friend, my houfe 1s bis fort, and  
and Iam bis foldier.  
You muft kill me, before you can kilt bim.—  
What good man will ever come again un-  
der my roof, if I let my floor be fained with  
agood man’s blood!——The Negroes tee-  
ing his refolutions and being convin-  
ced by his difcourfe that they were  
wrong, went away afhamed. In a tew  
days Murray ventured abroad again  
‘with Cudjoe, when feveral of them took  
him by the hand, and told him they  
were glad they had not killed him;  
for as he was a good (meaning an in-  
nocent) man, their God would have been  
angry, and «would have fpoiled their fifb-  
ing.—I relate this, fays Capt. Seagrave,  
tothew, that fome among.thefe cark  
people have a ftrong’ fenfe. of jutlice  
and honour, and that even the mott  
brutal among them are capable of feel-  
ng the force of reafon, and of being  
influenced by a fear of God (if. the  
knowledge of thetrue God could be  
introduced among them} tince even the  
fear of a falfeGod, when their rage fub-  
fided, was not without its good effect.  
Now Tam about to. mention fome-

: tions, asa body, have kept ‘faith with  
  
the Engli/b ever tince we knew them,  
now nearan hundred years; and that

may be the cafe with the ram-deban- ~  
ched, trader-corrupted vagabonds and  
thieves on Sa/quebannab and the Obio,  
at prefent in arms againft us.——As a: &#x27;  
proof of that honour, I fhall only men-  
tion one well-known recent fact. When  
fix Catawba deputies, under the care  
of Col. Bull of Charlefown, went by .  
permiffion into the Mobawks country,  
to fue for and treat of peace for their  
nation, they foon found the Six Nations  
highly exafperated, and the peace at  
that time impraéticable; They were  
therefore in fear for their own perfuns,  
and apprehended that they fhould be  
killed in their way back to New-York ;  
which being made known to the Mo- .  
hawk chiefs, by Col. Bull. oneof them,  
by order of the council, made this  
fpeech to the Catawhas :-——~  
** Strangers and Enemies,  
  
** Waile you are in this country,  
** blow away all fear out of your  
“ breafts; change the black fhreak of  
paint on your cheek for a red one,  
and let your faces thine with bear&#x27;s-  
‘“* greafe: You are fafer here than if  
s* you were athome. The Six Nations  
will not defile their own Jand with  
the blood of men that come unarmed  
to afk for peace. We thall fenda  
guard with you, to fee you fafe out  
of our territories. ‘So far you fhall  
have peace, but no father. Get  
hone to your Own country, and  
there take care of yourfelves, for °  
there we intend to come and kill :  
s¢ you.”  
  
he Catawbas came away unhurt  
accordingly. It is alfo wel known,  
that juit before the late war broke out,  
when our traders firft went among the  
Piankefbaw Indians, a. tribe of” the  
Twig htwees, they found the principle  
of giving protection to firangers in full &#x27;

the French infifting on it, the Pianke-

Juftice to a Nation, though lately

cordial Friends, obliges one, on this  
Occafion, not to omit mentioning  
an Inftance of Spanifh Honour,  
which cannot but be yet frefh in the  
Memory of many yet living. In  
1746, when we were in hot War  
with Spain, the Elizabeth, of Lon-  
don, Capt. William Edwards, com-  
ing thro’ the Gulph from Famaica,  
richly laden, met with a moft vio-  
Jent Storm,in which the Ship {prung  
a Leak, that obliged them, for the  
faving of their Lives, to run her into  
the Havanna. The Captain went  
on Shore, dire&amp;tly waited on the Go-  
vernor, told the Occafion of his put-  
ting in, and that he furrendered his  
Ship as a Prize, and himfelf and his  
Men as Prifoners of War, only. re-  
quefting good Quarter. * No, Sir,  
: (replsed the Spanifb Governor) if  
we had taken you in fair War at  
Sea, or approaching our Coaft  
with hoftile Intentions, your Ship  
would have been aPrize, and your  
People Prifoners. But when dif-  
trefled by a Tempeit, you come  
into our Ports for the Safety of  
your Lives, we, though Enemies,  
being Men, are bound as fuch, by  
the “ of Humanity, to afford  
Relief to diftrefled Men who afk  
it of us. We cannot, even againit  
our Enemies, take Advantage of  
an Aétof God. You have Leave  
therefore to unload your Ship, if  
that be neceflary, to ftop the Leak ;  
you may refit here, and traffic fo far

till you are beyond Bermuda. If  
after that you are taken, you will  
then be a Prize, but now you are  
only a Stranger, and have a Stran-  
ger’s Right to Safety and Protec-  
tion.’- - The Ship accordingly de-  
parted, and arrived fafe in London.

we will kill all White Men; give

Captain Seacrave, in his account

that a New England Sloop, trading  
there in 175 2, left their fecond mate,  
W ‘iam Murray, fick on fhore, and  
fa:!.d without him Murray was at  
the noufe of a Black, named Cudjoe,  
with whom he had contraéted an ac-  
quain‘an.e during their trade. He  
recovere. and the floop being gone,  
he con inued with his black friend,  
till iome other opportunity fhould

going on board her, were treache-

Their relations and friends, tran-  
fported with fadden rage, ran to the  
houfe of Cudjoe to take revenge, by  
killing Murray. Cudjoe ttopped  
them at the door, and demanded  
what they wanted ? The white men,  
faid they, have carried away our  
brothers and fons, and we will kill  
all white men ; give us the white man  
that you keep in your houfe, for we  
will killhim. ‘ Nay, (faid Cudjoe)  
‘ the white men that carried away  
‘ your brothers are bad men, kill  
‘ them when you catch them ; but  
‘ this white man is a man, and  
* you muft not kill him’ But he is  
a white man, they cried ; the white  
men are all bad; we will kill them  
all. ‘ Nay, (fays he) you muft not  
« kill a man, that has done no harm,  
‘ only for being white. This man  
* is my friend, my houfe is his fort,

‘ for him. You muft kill me, be-  
‘ fore you can kill him. What good  
man will ever come again under  
my roof, if I let my floor be ftain-  
ed with a good man’s blood!’ The  
Negroes feeing his refolution, and  
being convinced by his difcourfe  
that they were wrong, went away  
afhamed. In a few days, Murray  
ventured abroad again with Cudjoe,  
when feveral of them took him by  
the hand, and told him they were  
glad they had not killed him ; ¢ for  
‘ as he was agood (meaning an inno-  
cent man,) * their God would have

captain Seagrive, to fhow, that fome  
among thefe dark people have a ftrong  
fenfe of juftice and honour ; and that  
even the moft brutal among them are  
capable of feeling the force of rea-

Spain, the Elizabeth of London, (captain William  
Edwards) coming thro? the gulph from Jamaica,  
richly laden, met with a moſt violent ftorm, in which

He recovered, and the floop being gone, continued  
with his black friend till fome other opportunity fhou!ld

came into the road, and fome of the blacks going on

fuddea rage, ran to the houlg of Cudjor, to take te-

men, faid they, have carried away our brothers and

ed away your ‘relations are bad men, kill them when  
you can take them: but this white man is a good man,  
and you muft not kill him.”’ ‘ But he is a white man, —  
they cried, and the white men are all bad men; we  
will kill them all.” “ Nay, faid he, you muft not kill  
a man that has done no harm, only for being white.

The negroes being convinced by his difcourfe that  
they were wrong, went away afhamed. In a few days  
Murray ventured abroad again with his friend Cudyoe,  
when feveral of them took him by the hand, and told  
him, “* They were glad they had not killed him ; for

In captain Seagr rave’s account of his voyage to Guinea, he  
relates thata New-England sloop, trading there in 1752,  
left its second mate, William Murray, sick on shore, and  
sailed without him : Murray was at the house of a black,  
named Cucjo, with whom he had contracted an acquaintance  
during their trade. He recovered: and the sloop being  
gone he continued with his black friend, until some other  
  
opportunity should offer for his getting home. In the mean  
while, a Dutch ship came into the road ; and some of the  
blacks going on board of her, were treacherously seized, and  
carried off as slaves. Their relations and friends transport-  
ed with sudden rage, ran to the house of Cudjo, to take re-  
venge, by killing Murray. Cudjo stopped them at the door ;  
and demanded what they wanted? “ The white men (said  
they) have carried aw ay our brothers and sons : and we will  
kill all white men : give us the white man, that you keep in  
your house: for we will kill him.” Nay, (said Cudjo)  
the white men, that carried aw ay your brothers, are bad  
men: killthem, when you can catch them : but this white  
man is a good man : and you must not killhim.” “ But he  
is a white man (cried they) the white men are all bad: we  
will kill them all.” “ Nay (says he) you must not killa  
man that has done no harm, only for being white : this man  
is my friend: my house is his fort ; and I am his soldier ;  
you must kill me, before you can kill him: what good man  
will ever come again under my roof, if Ilet my floor be

stained with a good man’s blood ?”—The negroes, seeing  
his resolution, and being convinced by his discourse, that  
they were wrong, went aw ay ashamed. Ina few days,  
Murray ventured abroad again with Cudjo ; when several  
of them took him by the hand, and told him they were glad  
they had not killed him; for as he was a good (meaning an  
innocent) man, their god would have been angry, and would  
have spoiled their fishing. ‘ I relate this (say S Captain _  
grave) to shew, that some among these black people have  
strong sense of justice and honour, and that even the most  
brutal among them, are capable of fe cling the force of rea-  
son, and of being influenced by a fear of God (if the know-  
ledge of the true God should be introduced among them)  
since even the fear of a fulse god, when their rage subsided,  
was not without its good effects.”

CASE OF CAPTAIN WILLIAM EDWARDS, OF  
THY SHIP ELIZABETH, OF LONDON, IN  
1740.  
  
Iw 1746, when we were in hot war with  
Spain, the Elizabeth, of London, Captain  
Wm. Edwards, coming through the Gulph  
from Jamaica, richly laden, met with a most  
violent storm, in which the ship sprang a  
leak, that obliged them, for the saviag of  
their lives, to run her inte the Havannah.  
The Captain went on shore, directly waited  
on the Governor, told the occasion af his  
putting in, and that he surrendered the ship  
as a-prize, and himself and his mea as pri-  
soners of war, only requesting good quarter.  
** No Sir,” replied the Spanish Governor,  
«© }f we had taken you in fair war at sea,  
Or approaching our coast with hostile inten-  
tions, your ship would then have been a  
prize, and your people prisoners. But when  
distressed by a tempest; yon come into our  
ports for the safety of your lives, we, though  
evemies, being men, are bound as such, hy  
the laws of humanity, to afford relief to dis-  
tressed men, who ask it of us. We cannot  
even against our enemies, take advantage of  
an act of God. You have leave therefore  
to -anload your ship, if that be necessary, to  
stop the leak ; you may refit here, and traf-  
fick so far as shall be necessary to pay the  
charges ; you may then depart, and I will  
give you a pass, to be in foree till you are  
beroud Bermuda. If after that you are taken  
you wilithen be a prize, but now you are  
onlya stranger, and have a stranger’s right to  
safety and protection.” ‘The ship accordingly  
departed, and arrived safe at London.

“ These Indians were the  
remains of a tribe of the Six  
Nations, settled at Conestogoe,  
and thence called Conestogoe  
Indians On the first arrival  
of the English in Pennsylva-  
nia, messengers from this  
tribe came to welcome them,  
with presents of venison, corn  
and skins; and the whole tribe  
entered into a treaty of friend-  
ship with the first Proprietary,  
William Penn; which was to  
last as long as the sun should  
shine, or the waters run into  
the rivers. |  
  
“ This treaty has been since  
frequently renewed, and the

It has never been violated on  
their part, or ours till now.  
  
Vol. VIL No. 8. 29  
  
As their lands by degrees:  
were mostly purchased, and  
the settlement of the white  
people began to surround  
them, the Proprietary assign-  
ed them lands on the manor of  
Conestogoe, which they might  
not part with. There they  
have lived many years in  
friendship with their white  
neighbours, who loved them  
for their peaceable, inoffensive  
behaviour,  
  
“It has always been observ-  
ed that Indians, settled in the  
neighborhood of white people,  
do not increase but diminish  
continually. This tribe ac-  
cordingly went on diminishing,  
till there remained in the town  
or manor, but 20 persons—  
seven men, five women and  
eight children, boys ahd girls.  
  
“ Of these, Shebaes was a  
very old man, having assisted  
at the second treaty, held with

men, from some of our frontier  
townships, who had projected  
the destruction of this little  
commonwealth, came all well  
mounted, and armed with fire-

men and two women aad a  
young boy were found at heme

better security against any  
farther attempts; and, it is  
said, condoled with them on  
the misfortune which had  
happened, took them by the  
hand and promised them pro-  
tection. They were put into  
a work-house, a strong build-  
ing, as the place of greatest  
safety.  
  
“These cruel men again  
assembled themselves; and  
hearing that the remaining 14  
Indians were in the work-house  
at Lancaster, they suddenly  
appeared before the town on  
the 27th of December. Fifty  
of them armed as_ before, dis-  
mounting, went directly to the  
work-house; and by violence  
broke open the door, and enter-

had no protection nigh, nor

of defence, they divided their  
little families, the children

their innocence, declared their  
love of the English, and that

REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF HONOUR.  
A Spanish Cavalier, in a sudden quarrel, slew a  
Moorish gentleman, and fled. His pursuers soon  
  
  
  
perceived over a garden wall. The owner, a  
Moor, happening to be in his garden, was address-

*¢ Mat this,” said the Moor, giving him hait a peach.  
* You now know that you may conttde in my pro-

l apartment, telling him, as soon as it was night, he  
would provide for his escape to a place of greater  
salety. ‘The Moor then went into his house, where  
he had scarce seated himself when a great crowd,  
with loud lamentations, came te his gate bringing  
the corpse of his son, who had just been killed by  
a Spaniard. When the first shock of the surprise  
was a little over, he jearnt, from the description  
given, that the fatal deed was done by the very  
person then in his power. He mentioned this to  
no one; but as soon as it was dark, he retired to  
his garden, as if to -gvieve alone, giving orders  
that none should follow him. ‘Then accosting the  
Spaniard, he said, *“* Christian, the person you haye  
  
  
  
  
  
You ought te suffer; but you have eaten with me,  
and I have giyen you.my faith, which must not be

to his stables, mounted him on one of bis fleetest  
horses, and said, “Fly far while the night can  
cover you; you will be safe inthe morning. “You  
are indeed guilty of my son’s blood; but God is  
just and good; and I thank him, I am innocent of  
yours, and that my faith given is preserved.”

A Spanisn cavalier, in a sudden quarrel,  
slew a Moorish gentleman, and fled. His  
pursuers soon lost sight of him; for he had,  
unperceived, thrown himself over a garden-  
wall. The owner, a Moor, happening to be  
in his garden, was addressed by the Spaniard,  
on his knees, who acquainted him with his  
case, and implored concealment. “ Eat  
this,” said the Moor, “ you now know that  
you may confide in my protection.” He  
then locked him up in his garden apartment,  
telling him, that as soon as it was night, he  
would provide for his escape to a place of  
safety. The Moor then went into his house,  
where he had but just seated himself, when a  
great crowd, with loud lamentations, came to  
his gate, bringing the corpse of his son, who  
had just been killed by the Spaniard. When  
the first shock of surprise was a little over,  
he learnt, from the description given, that the  
fatal deed was done by the very person then  
in his power. He mentioned this to no one;  
but as soon as it was dark, retired to his  
garden, as if togrieve alone, giving orders that  
none should follow him. Then, accosting  
the Spaniard, he said—“ Christian, the pers  
son you have killed is my son, his body is  
now in my house. You ought to suffer;  
but you have eaten with me, and I have given  
you my faith, which must not be broken.’  
He then led the astonished Spaniard to his  
stables, and mounted him on one of his  
fleetest horses, aud said,—“ Fly far while the  
night can cover you, you will be safe in the  
morning. You are indeed guilty of my son’s  
blood: but God is just and good, and I thank  
him I am innocent of yours, and that my  
faith given is preserved !”

an aged man, firm in his integrity, and full of

In the year 1746, when England was at  
war with Spain, the ship Elizabeth, of Lon­  
don, Captain William Edwards, coming  
through the Gulf from Jamaica, richly la­  
den, met with a most violent storm, in  
which the ship sprang a leak that oblige !  
him—to save the lives of hi* crew—to run  
into Havana, a Spanish port.  
The Captain went on shore, ad directly  
waited on the Governor, told the occasion  
of his putting in, and that he surrendered  
the ship as a prize, and himself and his men  
as prisoners of w ar, only requesting good  
quarter.  
“No, sir,” replied the Spanish Gover­  
nor ; “if we had taken you in fair war at  
sea, or approaching our coast with hostile  
i intentions, your ship would then have been  
a prize, and your people prisoners; but  
when, distressed bv a tempest, you come  
into our port for the safety of your lives,  
we the enemies, being men, are bound as  
| such, by the laws of humanity, to afford  
relief to distressed men who ask it of us.  
We cannot, even against our enemies.take  
advantage of an act of God. You have  
leave, therefore, to unload your vessel, if  
| that be necessary to stop the leak ; you  
. may refit here, and traffic so far as neces­  
&#x27; sary to pav the charges; you may then  
i depart, and T will give you a pass, to be in  
force till vou are beyond Bermuda. If af­  
i ter that you are taken, you will then be a  
lawful prize ; but now you are only a stran­  
i ger, and have a stranger’s right to safety  
and protection.”

A Now England sloop, trading to  
New Guinea in the year 1752, left the  
second mate, William Murray, sick on  
shore, and sailed without him. Mur­  
ray was at the house of a negro, named  
Cudjoe, with whom he hod contracted  
an acquaintance during their trade.  
He recovered, and the sloop being  
gone, he continued with his black  
friend till some other opportunity  
should offer of liis getting home. Tn  
the meantime a Dutch ship came into  
the road and some of the negroes com­  
ing on board her were treacherously  
seized and carried off as slaves. Their  
rotations and friends, transported with  
sudden rage, ran to the house of Cud­  
joe to take revenge by killing Murray.  
Cudjoe stopped them at the door, and  
demanded what they wanted ?  
•&#x27;The white men,&quot; said they, &quot;have  
carried away our brothers and sons,  
and we will kill all white men. Give  
us the white man you have in your  
house, for we will kill him.&quot;  
&quot; Nay,&quot; said Cudjoe, &quot; the white men  
that carried away your relations are bad  
men; kill them when you can take  
them ; but this white man is a good  
man, and yon mnst not kill him.&quot;  
&quot; But he is a white man,&quot; they cried,  
&quot;.and the white men are all bad ; we  
will kill them all.&quot;  
  
&quot; Nay,&quot; said he, &quot; you must not kill  
a man that has done no harm, only lor  
being white. This man is my friend ;  
my house is his post; lam his soldier,  
and must fight for him; you must kill  
me before you can kill him. What good  
man will ever come again under my  
roof, if I let my floor be stained with a  
good man&#x27;s blood ?&quot;  
The negroes, seeing his resolution,  
and being convinced that they were  
wrong, went away ashamed ; and after­  
ward declared they were glad they had  
not killed the innocent man, for their  
god would have been very angry.  
  
ELECTRIC SPARK PEN.—A new inven­

WOULD THEY DO IT NOW?  
A Remarkable Instance of Spanish  
Chivalry in the War with England.  
The following story of Spanish chiv­  
alry differs very widely from that of  
any act that Spain has performed in  
the present war:  
In 1746 when England was engaged  
In war with Spain Capt Edwards, of  
the Elizabeth, of London, coming  
through the gulf from Jamaica richly  
laden, met with a violent storm. The  
ship sprang a leak that obliged It to run  
Into the port of Havana. The captain  
went on shore and watted on the Gov­  
ernor and told him of the occasion of  
hie putting in, adding that he surren­  
dered the ship as a prize, as well as  
himself and crew as prisoners of war,  
only requesting good quarters. “No,  
sir,” replied the Governor; “if we had  
taken you In fair sea or approaching  
our own coast with hostile intentions,  
your ship would then be a lawful prize  
and your people prisoners, but when,  
distressed by the hand of Providence,  
you come to our port for safety of your  
lives, we, being men, though enemies,  
are bound toy the laws of humanity to  
afford relief to the distressed who ask  
it of us. We cannot, even against our  
foes, take advantage of the act of God.  
You have leave, therefore, to unload  
your ship, if that be necessary to stop  
the leak. You may fit her here, and  
traffic so far besides as shall be needful  
to pay the charges. When repaired you  
may depart I will give you a pass, to  
he in force till beyond Bermuda. If  
after that you are taken, then you will  
be a lawful prize, whereas now, as you  
are only a stranger, you have a

laden, met with a violent storm. The ship sprang  
a leak that obliged it to run into the port of Ha-
