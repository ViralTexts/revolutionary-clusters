My dear Marquis,  
Mount VernonApril 25th[–1 May] 1788  
  
In reading your very friendly and acceptable letter of the 21st of December 1787, which came to hand by the last mail, I was,  
  
as you may well suppose, not less delighted than surprised to come across that plain American word—“my wife.” A wife! well my dear Marquis, I can hardly refrain from smiling to find you are caught at last. I saw, by the eulogium you often made on the happiness of domestic life in America, that you had swallowed the bate and that you would as surely be taken (one day or another) as you was a Philosopher and a Soldier. So your day has, at length, come. I am glad of it with all my heart and soul. It is quite good enough for you. Now you are well served for coming to fight in favour of the American Rebels, all the way across the Atlantic Ocean, by catching that terrible Contagion—domestic felicity—which time like the small pox or the plague, a man can have only once in his life: because it commonly lasts him—(at least with us in America—I dont know how you manage these matters in France) for his whole life time. And yet after all the maledictions you so richly merit on the subject, the worst wish which I can find in my heart to make against Madame de Chastelux and yourself is, that you may neither of you ever get the better of this same—domestic felicity—during the entire course of your mortal exestence.  
If so wonderful an event should have occasioned me, my dear Marquis, to have written in a stra[n]ge style—you will understand me as clearly as if I had said (what, in plain English, is the simple truth) do me the Justice to believe that I take a heartfelt interest in whatsoever concerns your happiness. And in this view, I sincerely congratulate you on your auspicious Matrimonial connection. I am happy to find that Madame de Chastellux is so intimately connected with the Dutchess of Orleans, as I have always understood that this noble lady was an illustrious pattern of connubial love, as well as an excellent model of virtue in general.  
While you have been making love, under the banner of Hymen—the great Personages in the North have been making war, under the inspiration, or rather under the infatuation of Mars. Now, for my part, I humble conceive, you have had much the best and wisest of the bargain. For certainly it is more consonant to all the principles of reason and religion (natural and revealed) to replenish the earth with inhabitants, rather than to depopulate it by killing those already in existence, besides it is time for the age of Knight-Errantry and Mad-heroism to be at an end.   
  
Your young military men, who want to reap the ha[r]vest of laurels, dont care (I suppose) how many seeds of war are sown: but for the sake of humanity it is devoutly to be wished that the manly employment of agriculture and the humanizing benefits of commerce would supersede the waste of war and the rage of conquest—that the swords might be turned into plough-shares, the spears into pruning hooks—and, as the Scripture expresses it, the nations learn war no more.  
Now I will give you a little news from this side of the water, and then finish. As for us, we are plodding on in the dull road of peace and politics. We, who live in these ends of the earth, only hear of the rumours of war, like the roar of distant thunder. It is to be hoped, our remote local situation will prevent us from being swept into its vortex.  
The Constitution, which was proposed by the fœderal Convention, has been adopted by the States of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Georgia. No State has rejected it. The Convention of Maryland is now setting and will probably adopt it: as that of South Carolina is expected to do in May. The other Conventions will assemble early in the summer. Hitherto there has been much greater unanimety in favour of the proposed government than could have been reasonably expected. Should it be adopted (and I think it will be) America will lift up her head again and in a few years become respectable among the nations. It is a flattering and consolatory reflection, that our rising Republics have the good wishes and of all the Philosophers, Patriots and virtuous men in all nations: and that they look upon us [as] a kind of Asylum for mankind. God grant that we may not disappoint their honest expectations, by our folly or perverseness! With sentiments of the purest attachment and esteem I have the honor to be My dear Marquis Yr most obedient and Most humble Servant  
  
Go. Washington  
  
  
P.S. If the Duke de Lauzun is still with you, I beg you will thank him, in my name, for his kind remembrance of me, and make my Compliments to him.  
May 1st. Since writing the above I have been favoured with a duplicate of your letter in the hand-writing of a lady, and cannot close this without acknowledging my obligations for the   
  
flattering Postcript of the fair Transcriber. In effect, my dear Marquis, the Characters of this interpreter of your sentiments are so much fairer than those through which I have been accustomed to decypher them, that I already consider myself as no small gainer by your Matrimonial connection. Especially, as I hope, your amiable amanuensis will not forget, at sometimes, to add a few annotations of her own to your original text—I have just received information that the Convention of Maryland has ratified the proposed Constitution, by a Majority of 63. to 11.

Mount Vernon, April 25, 1788.  
MY DEAR MARQUIS,  
In reading your very friendly  
  
and acceptable letter, of the 21st’  
  
of December, 1787, which came to  
hand by the last mail, I was, as you  
may well suppose, not less delighted  
than surprised to come across that  
plain American word, ‘My Wife.”  
—A Wife !—well, my dear Marquis,  
I can hardly refrain from smiling to  
find that you are caught at last. I  
saw, by the eulogium you often  
made on the happiness of domestic  
life in America, that you had. swal-  
lowed the bait, and that you would,  
as surely as you are a philosopher  
and a soldier, be taken, one day or  
other. So, your day has at length  
come.—I am glad of it, with all my  
heart and soul. It is quite good  
enough for you :—Now, you are  
well served for coming to fight in  
favour of the American rebels, all  
the way across the Atlantic Ocean,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
by catching that terrible contagion,  
  
which, like the small pox, or the?  
plague, a man can only have once in)  
his life, because it commonly last)  
  
him (at least with us in America—j7  
  
I dont know how you manage these!  
matters in France) for his life time.  
—And yet, after all the maledictions|”  
you so richly merit on the subject,  
the worst wish I can find it in my  
heart to make against Madame de  
Chastellux and yourself, is, that you  
may neither of you get the better o/  
this domestic felicity during the  
course of your mortal existence.

MOUST-VERNON, APRIL 25, 1788.  
My dear Marquis—  
In reading your very friendly and ac­  
ceptable letter, of the 21st of Decem­  
ber, 1787, which came to hand by the  
last mail, I was, as you may well sup­  
pose, not less delighted than surprized,  
to cqme across that plain American  
word—“ My Wife.” A Wife !—well  
my dear Marquis, I can hardly refrain  
from smiling, to find that you are caught  
at last. I saw by the eulogium you of­  
ten made on the happiness of domestick  
life in America, that you had swallowed  
the bait, and that you would, as surely  
as you are a philosopher and a soldier,  
be taken one day or other. So your  
day has at length come—l am glad of  
it with all my heart and soul—it is good  
enough for you. Now you are well  
served for coming to fight in favour of  
the American rebels, all the way across  
the Atlantick ocean, by catching that  
terrible contagion which, like the small­  
pox, or the plague, a man can only have  
once in his life, because it commonly  
lasts him (at least with us in America—  
I don&#x27;t know how you manage the mat­  
ter in France,) for his life-time. And  
yet, after all the maledictions you so  
richly merit on the subject, the worst  
wish I can have in my heart to make a­  
gainst Madame de Chastellux and your­  
self, is, that you may neither of you get  
the better of this domestick felicity du­  
ring the course of your mortal existence.  
If so wonderful an event should have  
occasioned me, my dear Marquis, to  
have written in a strange style, you will  
understand me as clearly as if I had  
said (what in plain English is the simple  
truth) do me the justice to believe that  
I take a heart-felt interest in whatsoev­  
er concerns your happiness ; in this  
view, I sincerely congratul ate you on  
your auspicious matrimonial connexion.  
I am happy to find that Madame de  
Chastellux, is so immediately connecter!  
with the Duchess of Orleans, as I have  
always understood that this noble lady  
was an illustrious pattern of connubial  
love, as well as an excellent model of  
virtue in general.  
While you have been making love  
under the bands of Hymen, the great  
personages of the north have been mak­  
ing war under the inspiration, or rather  
the infatuation, of Mars. Now, for my  
part, I humbly conceive you had much  
the best and wisest of the bargain ; for  
certainly it is more consonant to all the  
principles of reason and religion, (nat­  
ural and revealed) to replenish the earth  
with inhabitants, rather than depopulate  
it by killing those already in existence;  
besides, it is time for the age of knight­  
errantry and mad heroism to be at an end.  
Your young military men, who want  
to reap the harvest of laurels, do not  
care, 1 suppose, how many seeds of war  
are sown; but, for the sake of humani­  
ty, it is devoutly to be wished that the  
manly employment of agriculture, and  
the humanizing benefit of commerce,  
should supersede the waste of war and  
the rage of conquest; that the swords  
might be turned into ploughshares—the  
spears into pruning hooks—and, as the  
Scripture expresses it, “ the nations  
learn war no more.”  
I will now give you little news from  
this side of the Atlantick, and then fin­  
ish :—As for us, we are plodding on in  
the dark road of peace and politicks.—  
We, who live in these ends of the earth,  
only hear of the rumours of war like  
the roar of distant thunder. It is to be  
hoped that our remote local situation  
will prevent us from being -swept into  
its vortex.  
The Constitution, which was propos­  
ed by the Federal Convention, has been  
adopted by the States of Massachusetts,  
Connecticut, Jersey, Pennsylvania, Del­  
aware, and Georgia. No State has re­  
jected it. The Convention of Mary­  
land is now sitting, and will probably a-  
  
dopt it, as that of South-Carolina will do

assemble early in the summer. Hither­  
to there has been much greater unanim­  
ity in favour of the proposed govern­  
ment than could have reasonably been  
expected. Should it be adopted, (and 1  
think it will be) America will lift up her  
head again, and, in a few years, become  
respectable among the nations. It is a  
flattering and consolatory reflection that  
our rising republick has the good wishes  
of all philosophers, patriots, and virtu­  
ous men, in all nations, and that they  
look upon it as a kind of asylum for  
mankind. God grant that we may not  
be disappointed in our henest expecta­

With sentiments of the purest attach­

P. S.—ls the Duke de Lauzun is still

my name, for his kind remembrance of  
me, and make my compliments to him.

Since writing the above, I have been  
favoured with a duplicate of your letter,  
in the hand-writing of a lady, and can­  
not close this without acknowledging  
my obligations to the flattering post­  
script of the fair transcriber. In fact,  
my dear Marquis, the characters of this  
interpreter of your sentiments are so  
much fairer than those through which I  
have been accustomed to decypher them,  
that I already consider myself as no  
small gainer by your matrimonial con­

some times, to add a few annotations  
of her own to your original text.

true, that military inen are laying aside  
the im/ilements of war and of death, and  
are devoting themselves to Agriculture

long ago had an example of this wise

“Mount Vernon, April 25th, 1788,  
“My dear Marquis,—In reading your friendly and acceptable letter of the 21st  
December, 1787, which came to hand by last mail, | was, as you may well suppose,  
not less delighted than surprised, to come across that plain American word ‘my  
wife.’ A wife! Well, my dear Marquis, I can hardly retrain from smiling, to find  
you are caught at last. I saw, by the eulogium you often made on the happiness  
of domestic life in America, that you had swallowed the bait, and that you would,  
as sure as you are a philosopher and a soldier, be taken one day or other. So your  
day has at length come. Iam glad of it with all my life and soul. It is good enough  
tur you: now you are so well served for coming to fight in favour of the American  
vebels all the way across the Atlantic Ocean, by catching that terrible contagion,  
which, like the small-pox or the plague, a man can only have once in his life, be-  
‘ause it commonly lasts him (at least with us in America: I don’t know how you  
manage these matters in France) for his life-time. And yet, after all the maledic-  
tions you so richly merit on the subject, the worst wish I can find it in my heart to  
make against Madame de Chastellux and yourself, is, that you may neither of you  
get the better of this domestic felicity during the course of your mortal existence.  
“If so wonderful an event should have occasioned me, my dear Marquis, to have  
written in a strange style, you will understand me as clearly as if | had said, (what,  
n plain English, 1s simple truth,) do me the justice to believe, that I take heart-  
felt interest in whatever concerns your happiness; and in this view, I sincerely con-  
gratulate you on your auspicious matrimonial connexion.  
“Lam happy to find that Madame de Chastellux is so immediately connected  
with the Duchess of Orleans, as I have always understood that this noble lady was  
an illustrious pattern of connubial love, as well as an excellent model of virtue in  
  
peneral,

“While you have been making love under the banner of Hymen, the great per-  
  
sonages of the north have been making war under the inspiration, or rather the in  
fatuation of Mars. Now, for my part, I humbly conceive you had much the best  
and wisest of the bargain; for certainly it is more consonant to all the principles of  
reason and religion (natural and revealed) to replenish the earth with inhabitants,  
rather than depopulate it by killing those already in existence ; besides, it is time  
for the age of knight-erranury and mad heroisin to be at an end,  
  
“Your young military men, who want to reap the harvest of laurels, don’t care,  
I suppose, how many seeds of war are sown; but, for the sake of humanity, it is

conquest; that the swords might be turned into plough-shares, the spears into  
pruning-hooks, and, as the Scriptures express it, ‘ the nations learn war no more.’  
  
“I will now give you a little news from this side of the Atlantic, and then finish.  
As for us, we are plodding on in the dark road of peace and politics. We, who live  
in these ends of the earth, only hear of the rumours of war, like the roar of distant  
  
thunder. It is to be hoped our remote local situation will prevent us from being  
  
swept into its vortex.  
“The constitution, which was proposed by the federal convention, has been  
  
adopted by the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylva  
nia, and Georgia. No state has rejected it. The convention of Maryland is now  
sitting, and will probably adopt it, as that of South Carolina will do in May. The  
other conventions will assemble early in the summer. Hitherto, there has been  
much greater unanimity in favour of the proposed government than could have  
been reasonably expected.  
  
“Should it be adopted (and I think it will be), America will lift up her head  
again, and in afew years become respectable among the nations, It is a flattering  
and consolatory reflection, that our msing republic bas the good wishes of all philo  
sophers, patriots, and virtuous men, in all nations; and that they look upon it as a

Mount-Vernon, April 25, 1788.  
  
My dear Marquis—In reading your friendly and  
ace.sptable letter of the 2ist December, 1787,  
wihic.h came to hand by the last mail; | was, as  
you niay well suppose, uot less delighted than  
surprised, to come across that plain American  
word * ary wife.” A wife! Well, my dear mar-  
quiis, I can hardly refrain from smiling, to find you  
are caught af last. I saw, by the eulogium you  
often made on the happiness of domestic life in A-  
mcrica, that you had swallowed the bait, and that  
you would, as sure as you are a philosopher and a  
soldiex, be taken one day or other. So your day  
has at Length come. I am glad of it with all my  
life and soul. Itis good enough for you: now  
youare so well served for coming to fight in favour  
of American rebels all the way across the Atlantic  
Ocean, by catching the terrible contagion, which,  
like the sinall pox or the plague, a man can only  
have once in his life, because it commonly lasts  
him (at least With usin Ameri¢a; | don’t know  
how you manag: these matters in France) for his  
life-time. And yet, after all the maledictions you  
so richly merit on the subject, the worst wish I  
can find in my heart to make against Madante de-  
Chastellux and yourself, is, that you may neither  
of you get the better of this domestic felicity dur-  
ing the course of your mortal existence.  
  
If so wonderful an event should have occasioned  
me, my dear Marquis, to have written in a strange  
style, you will understand me as clearly as if I  
had said, (what, in plain English, is simple trath;)  
do me the justice to believe that I take heart-felt  
interest in whatever concerns your happiness ;  
and in this view, I sincerely congratulate you on  
your auspicious matrimonial connexion.  
  
I am happy to find that Madame de Chastellux  
is so immediately connected with the Duchess of  
Orleans, as | have always understood that this no-  
ble lady was an illustrious pattern of connabial  
love, as well as an excellent model of virtue in  
general,  
  
While you have been making love under the  
banners of Hymen, the great personages of the  
north have been making war under the inspiration  
or rather the infatuation of Mars. Now, for my  
part, | humbly conceive you had much the best  
and wisest of the bargain, for certainly it is more  
consonant to all the puiaciples of reason and reli-  
gion, (natural and revealed,) to replenish the earth  
with inbabitants, rather than depopulate it by kil-

MounrT VERNON, April 25, 1788.  
  
My Dear Marguts: In reading  
your very friendly and acceptable  
letter of the 21st of December, 1787,  
which came to hand by the last mail,  
I was, as you may well suppose, not  
less delighted than surprised to come  
across that plain American word,  
my wife! A wife! Well, my dear  
Marquis, I can hardly refrain from  
smiling to find you are caught at  
last. I saw, by the eulogium you  
often made on the happiness of do-  
mestic life in America, that you had  
swallowed the bait, and that you  
would as surely be taken (one day or  
  
Unpublished Letters of General Washington.  
  
another) as you were a philosopher  
and a:soldier. So your day has at  
length come. I am glad of it with  
all my heart and soul. It is quite  
good enough for you. Now you are  
well served for coming to fight in  
favor of the American rebels, all the  
way across the Atlantic ocean, by  
catching that terrible contagion,  
domestic felicity, which, like the  
small-pox or the plague, a man can  
have only once in his life, because it  
commonly lasts him (at least with us  
in America—I don’t know how you  
manage these matters in France) for  
his whole lifetime. And yet, after  
all the maledictions you so richly  
merit on the subject, the worst wish  
which I can find it in my heart to  
make against Madame de Chastel-  
lux and yourself is, that you may  
neither of you ever get the better  
of this same domestic felicity during  
the entire course of your mortal  
existence.  
  
If so wonderful an event should  
have occasioned me, my dear Mar-  
quis, to have written in a strange  
style, you will understand me as  
clearly as if I had said, (the simple  
truth in plain English,) Do me  
the justice to believe that I take  
a heart-felt interest in whatsoever  
concerns your happiness. And in  
this view I sincerely congratulate  
you on your auspicious matrimonial  
connection. J am happy to find that  
Madame de Chastellux is so inti-  
mately connected with the Duchess  
of Orleans, as I have always un-  
derstood this noble lady was an il-  
  
. lustrious pattern of connubial love,  
  
as well as an excellent model of  
virtue in general.  
  
While you have been making love  
under the banner of Hymen, the  
great personages of the North have  
been making war under the inspi-  
ration, or rather the infatuation, of  
Mars. Now, for my part, I humbly  
  
  
  
Unpublished Letters of General Washington.  
  
conceive you have had much the best  
and wisest of the bargain. For cer-  
tainly it is more consonant to all the  
principles of reason and religion  
natural and revealed) to replenish the  
earth with inhabitants, rather than to  
depopulate it by killing those already  
in existence. Besides, it is time for  
the age of knight-errantry and mad  
heroism to be at an end. Your young  
military men, who want to reap the  
harvest of laurels, don’t care (I sup-  
pose) how many seeds of war are  
sown. But for the sake of humanity  
it is devoutly to be wished that the  
manly employment of agriculture, and  
the humanizing benefits of commerce,  
would supersede the waste of war and  
the rage of conquest. Thatthe swords  
might be turned into ploughshares,  
the spears into pruning-hooks, and,  
as the Scripture expresses it, the na-  
tions learn war no more.  
  
I will now give you a little news  
from this side of the water, and then  
finish. As for us, we are plodding  
on in the dull road-of peace and poli-  
tics. We, who live at these ends of  
the earth, only hear of the rumors of  
war, like the roar of distant thun-  
der. It is to be hoped our remote  
local situation will prevent us from  
being swept into its vortex.  
  
The constitution which was pro-  
posed by the federal convention has  
been adopted by the States of Mas-  
sachusetts, Connecticut, Jersey, Penn-  
sylvania, Delaware, and Georgia. No  
State has rejected it. The convention  
of Maryland is now sitting and will  
probably adopt it ; as that of South Ca-  
rolina is expected to do in May. The  
other conventions will assemble early  
in the summer. Hitherto there has  
been much greater unanimity in fa-  
  
155  
  
vor of the proposed government than  
could have been reasonably expect-  
ed. Should it be adopted, (and I  
think it will be,) America will lift up  
her head again, and in a few years  
become respectable among the na-  
tions. It is a flattering and consol-  
ing reflection that our rising repub-  
lic has the good wishes of all the  
philosophers, patriots, and virtuous  
men in all nations, and that they look  
upon it as a kind of asylum for man-  
kind. God grant that we may not  
disappoint their honest expectations  
by our folly or perverseness! With  
sentiments, etc.,  
G. WASHINGTON.  
  
P.S.—If the Duke de Lauzun is  
still with you, I beg you will thank  
him, in my name, for his kind remem-  
brance of me, and make my compli-  
ments to him.  
  
May 1st.—Since writing the above,  
I have been favored with a duplicate  
of your letter in the handwriting of a  
lady, and cannot close this without  
acknowledging my obligations for the  
flattering postscript of the fair tran-  
scriber. In effect, my dear Marquis,  
the characters of this interpreter of  
your sentiments are so much fairer  
than those through which I have been  
accustomed to decipher them, that  
I already consider myself as no sma  
gainer by your matrimonial connec-  
tion. Especially as I hope your  
amiable amanuensis will not forget  
at the same time to add a few anno-  
tations of her own to your original  
text.  
  
I have just received information  
that the convention of Maryland has  
ratified the proposed constitution by  
a majority of 63 to 11

written upon hearing of the Marquis&#x27; marriage  
is one of his happiest jenx d&#x27;esprit:  
&quot;I was, says he, no less delighted than surprised

sorcely refrain from smiling to find you caught  
at last. I saw by the eulogium you often  
made on the happiness of domestic lile in  
America, that you had swallowed the bait, and  
that you would be as surely taken one day or

soldier. So your day has at last come. I am  
glad of it with all my heart. It is quite good  
enough for you. Now you are well served for  
coming to fight in favor of the American rebels  
all the way across the Atlantic Ocean, by catching  
that dreadful contagion, domestic felicity,,
