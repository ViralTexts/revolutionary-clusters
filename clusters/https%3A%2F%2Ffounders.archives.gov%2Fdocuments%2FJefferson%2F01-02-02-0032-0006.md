Reasons to be offered at the conference to be desired of the Senate in answer to their reasons delivered at the last conference.  
The house of delegates not being satisfied with the reasons urged by the Senate in support of their amendments to the resolution for allowing to Thomas Johnson the sum of £15-5-6 have desired this second conference to shew the insufficiency of the said reasons and to propose that some expedient may be adopted by the two houses for reconciling their difference of opinion.  
The resemblance between the constituent parts of our legislature and that of Great Britain is supposed by the Senate so faint that no ground remains for those jealousies which have prompted the commons of Gr. Br. against their house of lords. This might have been, and doubtless was, urged at the time our constitution was formed as a reason why the Senate and delegates should have equal powers over money bills: but the argument having been then overruled, the powers of the Senate as to this point being fixed by the constitution on the same restrictive footing with those of the Lords in the British legislature, it is conceived not to be the proper question of this day whether the resemblance between them in general be faint or strong, well or ill grounded; but whether the constitution has not made them to resemble in this point?  
Had those who framed the constitution, as soon as they had completed that work, been asked, man by man, what a money bill was, it is supposed that man by man they would have referred for answer to the well-known laws and usage of parliament, or would have formed their answer on the parliamentary idea of that term. It’s import at this day must be the same it was then. And it would be as unreasonable now to send us to seek it’s definition in the subsequent proceedings of that body as it would have been for them at that day to have referred us to such proceedings before they had come into existence. The meaning of the term must be supposed compleat at the time they used it, and to be sought for in those sources only which existed at the time. Constructions which do not  result from the words of the legislator, but lie hidden in his breast till called forth ex post facto by [subsequent] occasions are dangerous and not to be justified by ordinary emergencies.  
Nor do we by this set up the parliament of England as the expositor of our constitution, but the law of parliament, as it existed and was evidenced by usage at the time the term in question was inserted in our instrument of government; a law coeval with the common law itself and no more liable as adopted by us to subsequent change from that body than their common or statute law which we have in like manner adopted: to suppose this branch of law not existing in our code, would shake the foundation of our whole legal system, since every legislative proposition which has been passed or rejected since the first establishment of a legislature in this country has been determined to be law, or not law by the forms of parliamentary proceedings.  
With as little justice may it be said that this is referring for the definition of a term to multiplied disputes, which have for ages agitated the parliament of England, and which no time will decide; that it is proving what is clear by what is very obscure, and unsettling what is fixed; since we conceive that researches into parliamentary history will decisively shew that their practice in this matter has been clear, fixed, and antient; and that for ages past it has produced no agitation unless we call by that name some groundless assertions by the lords in the course of the last century. But these assertions they departed from in practice at the very time they advanced them and at all times after, they stand contradicted by the declarations of the commons, and the constant usage of both houses, which agreeing together are supposed to form the strongest evidence what the law of parliament is on this point. To prove this right as uniformly claimed and exercised by the commons and assented to in practice by the lords the delegates will subjoin some proceedings of parliament in addition to the passage cited by the senate.  
That a bill for raising money by way of tax is a money bill, is admitted by the Senate and need not therefore be proved.  
That bills for raising money by rates and impositions on merchandize are also considered as money bills will appear on recurring to the parliamentary proceedings of 1671, in which it is affirmed  
  
  
1 Parl. Deb.147, 153.  
  
‘that there is a fundamental right in the house of commons alone in bills  of rates and impositions on merchandize as to the matter, the measure, and the  time,’ and also by their declaration of 1689. ‘that the commons have  always taken it for their undoubted privilege  (of which they have ever been  tender and jealous) that in all aids given to the king by the Commons the rate or tax ought  not to be any way altered by the lords,’ which is supposed to be the passage cited  by the Senate as of the year 1671.  
That bills for applying forfeitures  
  
  
3. P.D.126  
  
in aid of the public revenue are not amendable by the lords appears by the  proceedings of 1700 on the bill for applying Irish forfeitures to the use of the public, to  which the lords were not permitted to make any amendments.  
The right of levying money in whatever way being thus exercised by the Commons, as their exclusive office, it follows as a necessary consequence that they may also exclusively direct its application. ‘Cujus est dare, ejus est disponere,’ is an elementary principle both of law and reason: that he who gives may direct the application of the gift, or in other words may dispose of it: that if he may give absolutely he may also carve out the conditions, limitations, purposes and measure of the gift, seems as evidently true as that the greater power contains the lesser. Parliamentary usage  
  
  
1 P.D.290  
  
has accordingly approved this reasoning. In July 1678 the commons resolved  ‘that it is their undoubted and sole right to direct, limit, and appoint in all aids and supplies granted to the king the ends, purposes, considerations, conditions, limitations and qualifications of such  grants, which ought not to be changed by the house of lords.’  
  
  
  
[1] P.D. [320, 322]  
  
In December of the same year the commons having directed the payment of money and the  lords proposed an amendment thereto, the former declared ‘that their lordships  never before changed any such disposition made on a supply granted by the  commons.’  
  
  
  
[3] P.D. [182]  
  
In 1701 the lords having amended a bill for stating and examining the public accounts  by inserting a clause for allowing a particular debt, the commons disagreed to the amendment  and declared for a reason ‘that the disposition as well as granting  of money by act of parliament hath ever been in the house of commons; and that the amendment  relating to the disposal of money does entrench upon that right.’  
  
  
  
3 P.D. 251. 254. 255. 256.  
  
And to a bill of the same nature the year following, the lords having proposed an  amendment by adding the names of some commissioners, the commons disagreed to the amendment  and declared ‘that their right in granting, limiting, and disposing public  aids being the main hinge of the controversy they thought it of the highest concern that it  should be cleared and settled.’ They  then go on to prove the usage by precedents and declarations and from these conclude that the  limitation, disposition, and manner of ‘account belongs only to  them.’ In reply the Lords said ‘they declined all arguments  concerning the rights of the  commons in granting, limiting and  disposing public aids and therefore forebore to answer any arguments of that  kind’; but proceeded to insist that the business then depending was of quite  another nature. And at some subsequent conferences between the two houses during the same  session  
  
  
  
[3 P.]D.271 272. 273.  
  
it was repeatedly declared ‘that the lords could not supply any deficiency  or apply any surplusage of the public money in case any should be found’;  and this declaration does not appear to have been contradicted by the Lords either then or at  any time after.  
These precedents are supposed to prove not only that the disposal or application of public money is equally with the raising of it the exclusive office of the commons, but also that it makes no difference whether it be of money then actually in the treasury, or yet to be raised on the people, nor whether the raising and disposing be in the same, or in separate bills.  
Tho the precedents referred to by the Senate in the proceedings of the Council and H. of Burgesses in the years 1771, 1772, and 1773 (the first of which however we suppose to be mistaken for 1772) might perhaps be well accounted for from the nature of the amendments, from the history of the times, or from other causes, and tho’ the delegates might produce from the same records proofs much more decisive in their favor, yet they decline resting it on that bottom, because they do not think that the present determination should be influenced by the practice of those who have themselves only copied from the same original. Both their opinions and yours must be decided by an application of the same common rule. When the delegates therefore in their former reasons mentioned the proceedings of the Council and H. of burgesses they did not think it proper to refer to them as evidence of what the law of parliament was, but only to prove in general that they admitted it to be their law.  
How dangerous it is to appeal to any other authorities from the parliamentary records the true text of decision will appear also by examining the whole passage of which a part only was cited from the commentaries of Judge Blackstone, a writer celebrated indeed but whether most for his attachment to the prerogatives of the crown or to the rights of the people would be worthy of consideration where the question is on one of those rights which have been of the greatest value to the people, the right of giving and disposing of their own money. That writer after the definition cited from his book by the Senate goes on to quote a passage from Judge Hale’s treatise on the jurisdiction of parliament, which is to be  found more at large in Bro[ke’s] abridgement entitled parl. pt. 4.  
  
  
parlmt.4.  
  
There it appears to be a saying of Kirbie a clerk of the parliament who lays down in  express terms or by direct implication these positions as of the law of parliament. 1. That  the Lords may amend a bill for granting aids. 2. That if the amendment be by shortening the  duration of the grant they need not return the bill to the commons for their concurrence. 3.  That the king may alter a bill. Brook indeed adds a quaere to the case; but that judge  Blackstone disapproved of it cannot be inferred from his words. It is therefore submitted to  the consideration of the Senate whether a writer who can cite or refer to such positions  without condemning them in decisive and unequivocal terms may be appealed to as an adequate  and impartial judge of the subject. He refers to no authority whatever for that part of his  opinion which the Senate quote and rely on. But  to waive further examination of the grounds of his opinion, the judges of the common law can  take no cognisance of the law of parliament; it can never come judicially in question before  them. Their sayings or opinions on the subject must be ever extrajudicial. And they have  accordingly always disclaimed a right to give judgment on them. Definitions therefore of  parliamentary law by any other court, by a member of a court, or by a private individual,  must be rejected as inauthoritative in a parliamentary disquisition.  
For these reasons the Delegates still think that the Senate have no authority to amend the vote in question. But open to conviction if it can be shewn they are wrong, and actuated by a strong desire to promote the public service as well as to preserve the constitution entire, they propose to the senate, if they should still adhere to their former opinions, that a select committee may be appointed by each house to meet together in free conference and endeavor to define the office of the two houses in bills, clauses, and votes relating to money, and that such definition, if approved by both houses, may be confirmed by act of assembly

Hensons to be offered at the confer­  
ence to be desired of the Sen ?Jc,  
in answer to their reasons dc/ivsr­  
* cd at the last con fen nee.  
*Thc Hctse of Delegates, not being  
satiSucd with the r*isons urged by the  
Senate in support oi their amendments  
/  
  
t3-&gt;tn&lt;* resolution for alio7.log to Th&lt;*­  
man Johnson the sum of ^ 1J&gt; 5 0,  
| have desired this second conference  
! to shew the insuKcicncy of the said  
reasons, and to propose that some ex­  
pedient may be adopted by the ttro  
houses for reconciling their difference  
of opinion.  
The resemblance between the con­  
stituent parts of our Legislature and  
that of Great-Ilritain is supposed by  
the Senate so faint, that no ground re­  
mains for those jealousies which have  
prompted the Commons of Great Bri­  
tain against their Ho’t&#x27;t of Lords.  
This might have been, and doubtless  
was, urged at the time our Constituti­  
on was formed, as a reason why the  
Senate and Delegates should have o  
qua! powers over money bills. But  
the r.-gument having been then over­  
ruled,- and the powers of the Senate,  
as to this point, being fixed by the  
Consdiu ion, on the same restricted  
Jootin w ith those of the X.ords in the  
British Legislature, it is conceived  
nqt to be the proper question of this  
day whether the resemblance between  
them in general be faint or strong,  
well or ill grounded ; biu whether the  
Constitution has ne t made them to re­  
semble in this point ?  
Had those who framed the constitu­  
tion, as soon as they had completed  
that work, been asked, man by mao*  
what a money bill was, it is supposed &quot;  
that, man by man, they would have re­  
ferred for answer to the wt-il known  
laws t* usage of Parliament, or would  
have formed their answer on the Par­  
liamentary idea of that term- li&#x27;s  
import at this day must be the same it  
was then : And it would be as unrea­  
sonable now to send us to seek its de­  
finition in the subsequent proceeding*  
of that body, as it would have been lor  
i them, at that day, to have referred us  
  
I to sucn proceedings before they had  
j come into existence. The meaning  
j of the term must be supposed com­  
plete at the time they. u»td it, and to  
j or cought for in those resources only  
which existed at the time. Construc­  
tions which do not result from the  
words of the legislator, but lie hidden  
in his breast, till called forth, ex post  
facto, by subsequent occasions, are  
dangerous and not to be justified by  
ordinary emergencies.  
Nor do we by this set up the Pirii­  
i ament of England, as the expositor of  
! our constitution, but the law of Parlia­  
ment, as it existed, and was cvideuced  
; by usage, at the time the term, in ques­  
tioA was inserted in our instrument of  
government ; a law co-eval with the  
common law itself, and no more lia­  
ble, as adopted by us, to subsequent  
change, from that body, than their­  
common or statute law. which wa liava  
in like manner adopted. To suppose,  
this branch of lav/ not existing in our  
code,&#x27; would shake the foundation of  
our whole legal system ; since every  
legislative proposition which has been  
passed or rejected since the first esta­  
blishment of a legislature in this coun­  
try;4ias been determined to be law, or  
; not 1™. by the form of parliamentary  
■ proceeding. With as little justice may  
i it be siid, tnatthis is referring for the  
I definition of a term to multiplied dis~  
I pu.c*-., -vhich have for ages agitated the  
&#x27; parliament of England, anti which no  
I iiaie will decide ; that it is proving  
! what ii clear by what is very obscure,  
anti unsettling what is fixed : since  
| wc conceive that researches into pavli­  
  
; - t— J • v will VI^VX*1TIT1^ HIICW  
i that their practice in this matter ha»  
j been clear, fixed end ancient ; and  
that for ages past, it has produced no  
j agitation, unless we call by that namo  
j some groundless assertions of the  
| bords in the course of the last centu­  
ry. Yet these assertions they depart­  
, cd from in practice, at the very time  
they advanced them, an l at all times  
’ a he r, they stand contradicted bv the.  
! declarations of the commons, and tho  
[constant usage of both houses ; which  
t agreeing together, are supposed t&lt;&gt;  
&#x27;.form the strongest evidence \r hat the  
|law of Parliament is in this point. To  
prove this right aa uniformly claimed  
j and exercised by the commons, and  
i assented to in practice by the Lords,  
the Del* gates will subjoin some pro.  
feedings of Parliament in addition to  
the passage cited by the Senate.  
.That a bill for raising money by­  
way of tax, is a money bill, is ad­  
mitted by the senate, and need not  
; therefore be proved.

tindoubted privilege (of wbicb  
they liave evdr beep tender and jea­  
wus) that in all aids given to the  
King by the Commons, the rate or  
tax ought not to be any way altered  
b}’ the Lords,” which is supposed  
to be the passage cited by the Se­  
nate as of the year 1G71.  
*1 hat bills lor applying forfeiture*  
in aid of the public revenue, are not  
amendable by the Lords, appears  
by the proceedings of 1700, on the  
bill for applying Irish forfeitures to  
the use of the public, to which the  
Lords w ere not permitted to make  
any amendments.  
Tne right of levying money in  
whatever way being thus exercised  
by the Commons as their exclusive  
ce, it follows as a necessary con­  
sequence that they may also exclu­  
sively direct its application “ Cujus  
cst dare ejus est aisponere,” is an e­  
Jementary principle, both of law and  
re?.3on. That he who gives, may 1  
direct the application of tire gift, or I  
in other.words, may dispose of it; J  
tlixi, if he may give absolutely, he 1  
may also carve out the conditions,  
limitations, purposes and measures  
of the gift, seems as evidently trite,  
that the greater power contains  
the lesser. Parliamentary usage has I  
accordingly approved this reason-,  
mg. In July, 1678, the Commons i  
resolved, “ That it is their undoubt- j  
  
c.i u:ui suic ngm to direct, limit  
and appoint, in all aids and sup­  
plies granted to the King, the ends,  
purpo.es, conditions, considerati­  
ons, limitations and qualifications of  
such, grants, vvTucb ought not to he  
changed by the lloicic of Lords.*’  
In December of the_^me year, the  
Onnmons liaving directed the pay.  
ment of money, and the Lords pro­  
posed r.n amendment thereto, the  
former declared, “ That their I.• n d­  
ships never before changed any  
such disposition mv.de on a supply &#x27;  
granted bv the Commons.” in  
1701, the Lords having amended a  
bill for stating and examining the J  
public accounts, by inserting a  
clause for allowing a particular debt,  
the Commons disagreed to the a­  
mendment, and declared for a rea­  
son, That the disposition as well as  
granting of money by act. of Par­  
liament, hath ever been i:s the House  
of Commons, and that the amend­  
ment relating to the disposal of mo­  
ney, dors intrench upon that right.” |  
—And to a hill of trie same nature  
the year following, the Lord-* hav­  
ing proposed an amendment, by ad­  
ding the names ofsome commission* \
era, the Commons disagreed to the !  
amendment, and decided, “ That ■  
their right in granting, limiting and&#x27;  
disposing public aid?, being the  
main hinge of the controversy, they  
thought it of the hiirhcst concern  
  
that it should be cleared and set­  
tled.” They then go on to prove  
the usage, by precedents and decla­  
rations, and from these conclude,  
“ That the limitation, disposition  
and manner of account belongs only  
to them.” In reply the Lords said  
“ They declined all arguments con­  
cerning the rights of the Commons  
in-granting, limiting and disposing  
public aids, and therefore forbore  
to answer any arguments of that  
kind but proceeded to insist that  
tlrr business then depending was of  
quite another nature. And at some  
subsequent conferences between the  
two houses (luring the same sessi­  
on, it was repeatedly declared  
“That the lord* could not supply  
• any deficiency, orapply any surplus  
sage of the public money in case a­  
ny should be found”—And this de-1  
duration does not appear to Live j  
been contradicted by the Lords, j  
either then or at any time after.  
These precedents arc supposed  
to prove not only th it the disposal  
or application of public money ise­  
quallv with the raising of ft, the ex­  
clusive office of the Commons, but  
also that it makes no dilferencc whe­  
ther it be of money tlien actually in  
the Treasury, or yet to be raised on  
the public; nor w bother the raising  
and disposing be in the same or in  
separate bills.  
Though the precedents, referred  
to by the Senate, in the proceedings  
of the Council and House of Bur*  
gesH*s, in the years 1771, 1772,  
*nd 17/.», (the first of which, how­  
57  
  
ever, tVe suppose to be mistaken  
for 1772) might perhaps be wellac­  
counted for from their particular na­  
ture, from the history of the times,  
or from other causes; and though  
| the Delegates might produce, from  
the same records, proofs, much  
more decisive, in their favor, yet  
they dedine resting the matter on  
that Ixjttom : 13ecau.sc they are of  
opinion, that the present determi­  
nation ought not to be influenced  
by the practice of those, who have  
themselves only copied from the  
same original. Their practice,- nd  
our opinions, must be proved bv*  
the same common rule, the law and  
practice of parliament. Their ac­  
knowledgment of the rule, proves  
their submission to it, and that their  
practice should be tried by the law,  
not the law by their practice.  
How dangerous it is to appeal to o­  
ther authorities from the Parliamen­  
tary records, the true text of decisi­  
on, will appear also by examining the ,  
whole passage, of which a part oulv  
was cited from the Commentaries of  
Judge Bluckstone ; a writer, celebrat­  
ed indeed ; but whether most for his  
attachment to the prerogatives of_the  
crown or to the rights of the people,  
would he worthy of consideration,  
where the question isV&gt;n one of those  
rights, which have been of the great­  
est value to the people, the right of  
giving and disposing of their own mo­  
ney, that writer after the definition,  
cited fro in hit br&gt;nl- Kn -__  
  
goes on to quote a ;&gt;assage from Judge |  
Hales’s treatise on the jurisdiction of i  
i ariiamenc, which is to be ioutd more [  
at large in Brooke’s abridgment, un­  
der the title * Parliament/ pi. &lt;k tlxtre  
:t appear, to be a saying of Kerbie, a  
L-ierk of the Parliament, who lays  
down in express terms, cr by direct  
implication, these following positions,  
as cf the law of Parliament. 1st, That  
the Lords may amend a bill for ymt­  
ing ains. £d, rhat if.the amendment  
be by shortening the duration of the  
grant, they need not return the bill to  
the commons for their concurrence.  
3d, 1 hat the king may alter a bill.  
Brooke indeed, adds a auere to the  
cate; but tnat judge lllackstone disap­  
proved of it, cannot be inferred from  
his words. It is therefore submitted  
to the consideration of the Senate,  
whether they would set up as an .arbi­  
ter of Parliamentary law, a writer who  
can cite or refer to such positions  
without condemning them in decisive  
and unequivocal terms, for that part  
of hia book too, which the Serrate  
quote and rely on, he cite-.no authori­  
ty whatever ; are we then to take it  
upon his affirmation, when contradict­  
ed bv the uniform current of Parlia­  
mentary usage ? But waving further  
examination of the legality of his opi­  
nion, it suffices to observe, as a full an­  
swer to it, that the judges of the com­  
mon law can take no cognizance of the  
law of Parliament; it can never come  
judicially in question hefare them,  
/&#x27;heir sayings or opinion* on the suh­  
ject, must be ever extra-judicial and  
they have accordingly always disclaim­  
ed a right to give judgment on them ;  
definitions therefore of Parliamentary  
law, by any other court, bv a member  
  
ot court, or by a private individual,  
must be rejected a3 in authoritative in  
a Parliamentary disquisition.  
For these reasons, the Delegates  
still think that the Senate have no au­  
thority to amenJ the vote in questi-1  
on ; hut open to conviction, If it can ^  
he shewn they arc wrong, and actuat­  
ed by a strong desire to promote the  
public service, as well as to preserve  
the constitution entire, they propose  
to the Senate, if they should still ad­  
here to their former opinions, that a  
select committee may he appointed by  
each house to meet together in free  
conference, and endeavor to define the  
office of the two houses iu bills, clauses  
and votes relating to money, and that  
such definition, if approved by both  
houses, may be confirmed by act of  
Assemble.

January 9th, 177.8.  
Reasons to he uTered at the conference to be de  
.ire&lt;. o. the fetia*e in anfwer to their reafons delivered  
at the la&#x27;t conference.  
The Houle of Delegates, n.* being f atisfied with  
the reafons urged hy the fen;,to in fupport of their a­  
mendments to the refolution for allowing to Thomas  
Johnlon, the fum of £. 15 5 G have defired this fc­  
cond conference to (hew the infitfliciency of the faid  
reafons and to prnpofe that fome expedient n;ay be  
adopted hy the two houfes fur reconciling their diffe­  
rence of opinion.  
The refeinblatice between the conftitucnt part* of  
onr leg-nature and that of Great-Britain is fnppofed  
&#x27;i^ c&#x27;1* ^&#x27;na,e 10 ,n-*t no ground remains for  
thofe jealimiies which have prompted the commons  
of Great-Britain againft their houfe of lords. This  
might have been, and doubt lef* was, urged, at the  
time our conditution was formed, as a reafotr why  
the Senate and delegates ihiuld have eiptal powers  
over money bills. But the argument having been  
overruled, Si the powers of the Senate, as to this  
P&#x27;-int being fi\-d,l&gt;y the conftitucion, on the fame  
redridte-d footing with thofe of the Lords in the Bri­  
tdh legil’ature, it is conceived not to be the proper  
&lt;JueUion of this day whether the refemhlance be­  
tween them in genera1.be faint or flrong, well or ill  
grounded, but whether the conditution has not made  
.them to refembit* in this point ?  
  
Hadthofc who framed the conftitution, a* ft.on as  
they had completed that work, been aiked, man by  
man, what a mnaey bill was, it is fuppofed that,man  
bv man,they would have referred for anfwer to the  
well known laws and ttf.ige of Parliament, or would  
have formed their anfwer on the parliamentary idea  
of that term. Its import at this day tiutft he the fame  
as ir v.as then : &amp;. if would be as unreafonable now ra  
lend us to feck its definition in the fubfequenr pro­  
ceedings of that body, as it would have been for them  
at that day, to have referred u.» to fuel, proceedings  
before they had come into exiftence. The meaning  
of the term n,uft be ftippofed comp&#x27;eat at the time  
they ufed it, and to he fought for in rhofe refources  
only which exifted at the time. Conflruifions which  
do not rrfult from the words or the legiflator, hut lie  
hidden in his bread, till called forth, expoll fatfo, hy  
fuh&#x27;equent occufions, arc dangerous and not to be juf­  
tified hy ordinary emergencies. J  
Nor do we, by this, fet up the parliament of En»­  
laui, as the erpofitor of our conftitution, hut the law  
of parliament, as it exifted and was evidenced bv  
ufige, at the time the term in qiieftion was inferred  
in our iuftrument of government, a lav/ coeval with  
the common law itf-lf, and no more liable, as adopt­  
ed by us.ho fubfequent change, from that body, than  
their common or ftatute law, which we have in like  
manner adopted. To fupyofe this branch of law no&#x27;  
ex.flmg in our Code, would fhake the foundation of  
our whole legal fyftem; line* every legislative rrn­  
&quot;,&#x27;1‘ch has heen or reiecfted tince the  
urll eftabhlhment of of a LegifhtUre in this couu.ry,  
has been determined to be law, or not bw by :he  
by the form of parliamentary proceeding. With as  
httle juftice may it be faid that this is referrin» for  
the definition ofa term to multiplied difrures. which  
i ave .or age* agitated rite parliament of England, and  
which no time will decide ; that it is pr .vin-» what is  
clear hy what is very obfeure, anJ unfettlimr what  
ib fixed: fince we conceive that refe: tch.ts in?., par­  
liamentary hiftory will decifively Ihew that tlvir  
practice in this matter has been char, fix-l ml,,,  
tietit ; and that &#x27;ur ages pa ft, it lias produced noaci­  
lation unlefi we call by that name fame groundlefs  
affertions of the lords in the osurfe of the laft century.  
Ytt thefe affertions, they departed from, in pra&lt;3Ite,  
at the very time they advanced them, and at nil times  
I&#x27;fier. tin y ftatul . omradi »ed by the declarations of  
the commons, and the conflant ufog- „f both houfes •  
which, agreeing together, are fuppofid to form the  
ft rouge ft evidence, what the law of parliament is in  
1 , point. To prove this right as uniformly claimed  
and exercifed by the commons, and affetued •« in pra -  
rice by the lords, the Delegate* will lu! join forr.e  
proceedings of parliament in addition to the rafface  
citecl hy the Senate. 1 h  
Fliaf a hill fur rnifinj* money hy way of tax, is a  
money hill, is admitted hy the Senate and need not  
therefore be proved.  
  
I Put bills for raifinjr money br rate* and ini  
mis on merchandize arc alfo confidcr.-d as money bills,  
will appear on recurring to the parliamentary pro-’  
ceeduig* of 1671, in which it it affirmed “ that there  
“ &#x27;J a fundamental right in the hottfe of Commons  
“ al/&quot;,e in hill* of rates ami impolltlons on tnerchar.­  
“ dize as to the matter, the meaft.re, and the time,”  
and alio hy their declaration of 1680 « rhat the Com­  
“ mom have always taken it for their undoubted pri­  
vilege (of which they have ever been fender and  
jealous) that in all aids given to the Ki.ig by the  
commons,the rate or tax ought not to be any wav  
altered by the Lords.” which is fuppofed to he the  
paiT..ge cited hy the Senate as of the vear hr /1 .  
Thar bilis for applying forfeitures in aid of the pub­  
lic revenue are not amendable by the lords, appears  
V the proceedings of 1700 on th» bill for npjslyfg  
Iriih forfeitures to the ufe of the puhlic to which n»c  
lords v/cre not permitted to make any amendments.  
The right of levying money in whatever way be­  
ing thus exvrcifed hy the commons as their eXclflfive  
office, it follows as a nrceffary confeijucnce that the*&#x27;  
rr.sy alfo exclusively diredf it« application—- Cujus ed
