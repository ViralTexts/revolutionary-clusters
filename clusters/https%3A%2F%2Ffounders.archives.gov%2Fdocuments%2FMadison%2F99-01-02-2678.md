						Department of State February 8th. 1808  
					  
					Your letters and communications by Dr. Bullus were duly delivered on the  day of . The same conveyance brought a copy of the sentence pronounced by the French prize Court in the case  
						of the Horizon, giving a judicial effect to the Decree of Novr. 21. 1806, as expounded in the answer of Mr Champagny to your letter of the .  
					Whilst the French Government did not avow or enforce a meaning of the Decree of Novr. 1806, in relation to the United States, extending its purview beyond the municipal limits, it could not in strictness be regarded as an infraction either of our neutral or  
						conventional rights, and consequently did not authorize more than a demand of seasonable explanations of its doubtful import, or friendly expostulations with respect to the rigor and suddenness of its innovations.  
					The case is now essentially changed: A construction of the Decree is avowed and executed which violates as well the positive stipulations of the Convention of Sept. 30 1800, as the incontestable principles of public law. And the President charges you to  
						superadd, to whatever representations you may have previously made, a formal remonstrance in such terms as may be best calculated either to obtain a recall of the illegal measure, so far as it relates to the United States, or to have the effect of leaving in full force all  
						the rights accruing to them from a failure to do so.  
					That the execution of local laws against foreign nations on the high seas, is a violation of the rights of the former and the freedom of the latter, will probably not be questioned. A contrary principle would in fact imply the same exclusive dominion over  
						the entire ocean as is enjoyed within the limits of the local sovereignty, and a degradation of every other nation from its common rights and equal rank.  
					If it be contended that the Decree, as a retaliation on the other belligerent, at the expence of neutral nations, is justified by a culpable acquiescence in the prior measures of that belligerent operating thro’ neutrals, you will be able to deny such  
						acquiescence, and to urge moreover that, on every supposition, the retaliating measure could not be justly enforced in relation to neutrals without allowing them at least a reasonable time for chusing between due measures against the prior wrong and an acquiescence in both.  
						The copy of the representations to the British Government thro’ its Minister here, on the subject of its orders of Jany. 1807, will at once disprove an acquiescence on the part of the United States, and explain the grounds on which the late extension of the French Decree of  
						Novr. 1806, is an object of just remonstrance.  
					The conduct of the French Government, in giving this extended operation to its decree, and indeed in issuing one with such an apparent or doubtful import against the rights of the sea, is the more extraordinary inasmuch as the inability to enforce it on  
						that element exhibited the measure in the light of an empty menace, at the same time that it afforded pretexts to her enemy for severe retaliations for which ample means are found in her naval superiority.  
					The accumulated danger’s to which the illegal proceedings of the belligerent nations have subjected the commerce and navigation of the United States, have at length induced Congress to resort to an Embargo on our own vessels, as a measure best fitted for  
						the crisis, being an effectual security for our mercantile property and mariners now at home and daily arriving, and at the same time neither a measure, nor just cause of war. Copies of this act were soon after its passage, transmitted to Mr Pinkney, with an authority to  
						assure the British Government that it was to be viewed in this light; and that it was not meant to be the slightest impediment to amicable negotiations with foreign Governments. He was requested to avail himself of an opportunity of communicating to you and Mr Erving this  
						view of the subject, and I hope that you will have been thence enabled to present it to the French Government. Not relying however on that indirect opportunity, I send by this another copy of the act, with an instruction from the President, that you make it the subject of  
						such explanations as will guard against any misconception of the policy which led to it. It is strictly a measure of precaution required by the dangers incident to external commerce, and being indiscriminate in its terms and operation towards all nations, can give no just  
						offence to any. The duration of the act is not fixed by itself; and will consequently depend on a continuance or cessation of its causes in a degree sufficient in the judgment of the Legislature to induce or forbid its repeal. It may be hoped that the inconveniences felt from  
						it by the belligerent nations may lead to a change of the conduct which imposed the inconveniencies of it on ourselves. France herself will be a sufferer, and some of her allies far more so. It will be very agreeable to find in that consideration, and still more in her sense  
						of justice, a sufficient motive to an early manifestation of the respect due to our commercial rights. The example would be worthy of the professions which she makes to the world on this subject.  
					February 18th Since the above was written, I have been under a degree of indisposition which has suspended the proposed continuation of it, and which now will oblige me to be very brief; the more so, as the vessel has been some days detained, which was  
						engaged for the special purpose of conveying public despatches and private letters to Europe.  
					The delay has enabled me to inform you that Mr Erskine a few days ago communicated by instructions from his Government its late Decrees of Novr. 11, and those forming a sequel to them. The communication was accompanied with assurances that much regret was  
						felt by his Britannic Majesty at the necessity which the conduct of his enemy had created for measures so embarrassing to neutral commerce, and that His Majesty would readily follow an example of relinquishing such a course, or even of making relaxations pari passu with his  
						enemy.  
					Whether these intimations have any reference to the distinction between such parts of the French decree as operate municipally on shore, and such as operating on the high seas, violate the rights of neutrals, or to a distinction between the former  
						restriction and the late extension of the Decree with respect to the United States, Mr Erskine did not seem authorized to say. The probability is that neither of these distinctions entered into the views of the British Cabinet. But it is certainly neither less the duty nor  
						the true policy of the Emperor of the French so to vary his decree as to make it consistent with the rights of neutrals and the freedom of the seas, and particularly with his positive stipulations to the United States. This may be the more reasonably expected, as nothing can  
						be more clear, as has been already observed, than that the effect of the Decree, as far as it can be carried into effect, would not be sensibly diminished, by abolishing its operation beyond the limits of the territorial Sovereignty.  
					In remonstrating against the injustice and illegality of the French Decree, I am aware that you may be reminded of antecedent injuries to France and her allies thro’ British violations of neutral commerce. The fact cannot be denied, and may be urged with  
						great force, in our remonstrances against the orders to which Great Britain has given a retaliating character; since the French Decree might on the same ground, be pronounced a retaliation on the preceding conduct of Great Britain. But ought the legitimate commerce of  
						neutrals to be thus the victim and the sport of belligerents contesting with each other the priority of their destructive innovations; and without leaving, either of them, to neutrals, even the opportunity or the time for disproving that culpable acquiescence which is made  
						the pretext by both for the wrongs done to them? And I must repeat that apart from all questions of this nature the French Decree, or at least the illegal extensions of it to the United States remain chargeable with all the impolicy which has been pointed out.  
					I find by accounts from Hamburgh, Bremen, Holland and Leghorn, that the trade and property of our Citizens have been much vexed by regulations subaltern to those of the original Decree of Novr. 21. 1806. How far the complaints are founded on proceedings  
						violating our public rights, or on such as are unfriendly and inequitable towards our Citizens who have placed their property within these jurisdictions, you will be able to decide better than we can do at this distance; and the President refers to your own judgment the kind  
						of representation to the French Government which those and other analagous cases may require.

Whilst the French government  
did not avow or enforce a mean-  
ing of the decree of November,  
1806, in relation to the United  
States, extending its purview be-  
yond the municipal limits, it  
could not in strictness be regard-  
ed as an infraction either of our  
neutral or conventional rights ;  
and consequently did not autho-  
rise more than a demand of sea-  
sonable explanations of its doubt-  
ful import, or friendly expostula-  
tions with respect to the rigor  
and suddenness of its innova-  
tions. |  
  
The case is now essentially  
changed. A construction of the  
decree is avowed and executed,  
which violates as well the positive  
stipulations of the convention of  
  
, September 30th, 1800, as the  
  
incontestible principles of public  
law; and the president charges  
you to superadd to whatever re-  
presentations you may have pre-  
viously made, a formal remon-  
strance in such terms as may be  
best calculated either to obtain a  
recall of the illegal measure, so  
far as it relates to the United  
States, or to have the effect of  
leaving in full force all the rights  
accruing to them from a failure  
to do so.  
  
That the execution of local  
jaws against foreign nations on  
the high seas. is a violation of  
the rights of tne former and the  
freedom of the latter, will proba-  
bly not be questioned. A contra-  
ry principle would in fact imply  
the same exclusive dominion over  
the entire ocean as is enjoyed  
within the limits of the local so-  
vereignty, and a degradation of  
every other nation from its com-  
mon rights and equal rank.  
  
If it be contended that the de-  
  
cree, asa retaliation on the other  
belligerent, at the expense of  
neutral nations, is justified by a  
culpable acquiescence in the pri-  
or measures of that belligerent,  
  
operating through neutrals, you ~  
will be able to deny such acqui- |  
  
escence, and to urge moreover  
that, on every supposition, the re-  
taliating measure could not be  
justly enforced in relation to neu-  
trals, without allowing them at  
least a reasonable time for chus-  
ing between due measures a-  
gainst the prior wrong and an ac-  
quiescence in both. The copy  
of the representations to the Bri-  
tish government through its mi-  
nister here, on the subject of its  
orders of January, 1807, will at  
once disprove an acquiescence on  
the part ofthe United States, and  
explain the grounds on which the  
late extension of the French de-  
cree of November, 1806, is an  
object of just remonstrance.  
  
The conduct of the French go-  
vernment in giving this extended  
operation to its decree, and in  
issuing one with such an apparent  
or doubtful import against the  
rights of the sea, is the more ex-  
traordinary, inasmuch as the in-  
ability to enforce it on that ele-  
ment exhibited the measure in  
the light of an empty menace, at  
the same time that it afforded  
pretexts to her enemy for severe  
retaliations, for which ample  
means are found in her naval su-  
periority.  
  
The accumulated dangers, to  
which the illegal proceedings of  
the belligerent nations have sub-  
jected the commerce and naviga-  
tion of the United States, have at  
length induced congress to resort  
to an embargo on our own ves-  
sels, as a measure best fitted for

the crisis; being an effectual se-  
curity for our mercantile proper-  
ty and mariners now at home and  
daily arriving, and at the same  
time neither a measure nor just  
cause of war. Copies of this act  
were soon after its passage trans-  
mitted to Mr. Pinkney, with au-  
thority to assure the British go-  
vernment that it was to be viewed  
in this light; and that it was not  
meant to be the slightest impedi-  
ment to amicable negociations  
with foreign governments. He  
was requested to avail himself of  
an opportunity of communicating  
toyouand Mr. Erving this view of  
the subject, and I hope that you  
will have been thence enabled to  
present it to the French govern-  
ment. Not relying however on  
that indirect opportunity, I send  
by this another copy of the act,  
with an instruction from the pre-  
  
_sident, that you make it the sub-  
  
ject of such explanations as will  
guard against any misconception  
of the policy which led toit. It  
is strictly a measure of precau-  
tion required by the dangers inci-  
  
-dent to external commerce, and  
  
being indiscriminate in its .erms  
and operation towards all nations,  
can give no just offence to any.  
‘The duration of the act is not fix-  
ed by itself; and will consequent-  
ly depend on a continuance or  
cessation of its causes in a degree  
sufficient in the judgment of the  
legislature to induce or forbid its  
repeal. It may be hoped that the  
inconveniences felt from it by the  
belligerent nations, may lead to  
a change of the conduct which  
im posed the inconveniencies of it  
on ourselves. France herself  
will be a sufferer, and some of  
her allies far more so. It will be  
  
very agrecable to find in that con-  
  
sideration, and still more in  
her sense of justice, a sufficient  
motive to an early manifestation  
of the respect due to our com-  
mercial rights. The example  
would be worthy of the professi-  
ons which she makes to the  
world on this subject.  
  
February 18.  
  
Since the above was written, |  
have been under a degree of in-  
disposition which has suspended  
the proposed continuation of it,  
and which now will oblige me to  
be very brief; the more so, as  
the vessel has been some days  
detained, which was engaged for  
the special purpose of conveying  
public dispatches and private Iet-  
ters to Europe.  
  
The delay has enabled me to  
inform you, that Mr. Erskine, a  
few days ago, communicated by  
instructions from his government,  
its late decrees of November  
llth, and those forming a sequel  
to them. ‘The communication  
was accompanied with assurances  
that much reyret was felt by his  
Britannic majesty, at the necessi-  
ty which the conduct of his ene-  
my had created for measures so  
embarrassing to neutral com-  
merce, and that his majesty would  
readily follow an example of re-  
linquishing such a course, er even  
of making relaxations, pari pas-  
su, with hisenemy,  
  
Whether these intimations  
have any reference to the distinc-  
tion between such paris of the  
French decree as operate muni-  
cipally on shore, and such as ope-  
rating on the high seas, violate  
the rights of neutrals, or to a  
distinction between the former

restriction and the late extension  
of the decree with respect to the  
United States, Mr. Erskine did  
not seem authorised to say. The  
probability is, that neither of  
these distinctions entered into the  
views of the British cabinet. But  
it is certainly neither less the duty  
nor the true policy of the empe-  
ror of the French so to vary his  
decree as to make it consistent  
with the rights of neutrals and  
the freedom of the seas, and  
particularly with his positive sti-  
pulations to the United States.  
This may be the more reasonably  
expected, as nothing can be more  
clear, as has been already observ-  
ed, than that the effect of the de-  
cree, as far as it can be carried in-  
to effect, would not be sensibly  
diminished by abolishing its ope-  
ration beyond the limits of the  
territorial sovereignty.  
  
In remonstrating against the  
injustice and illegality of the  
lrench decree, I am aware that  
you may be reminded of antece-  
dent injuries to France and her  
allies through British violations  
of neutral commerce. The fact  
cannot be denied, and may be  
urged with great force, in our re-  
monstrancesagainst the orders to  
which Great Britain have given a  
retaliating character ; since the  
l’rench decree might on the same  
ground be pronounced a retalia-  
tion on the preceding conduct of  
Great Britain. But ought the  
legitimate commerce of neutrals  
to be thus the victim and the  
  
‘sport of belligerents contesting  
  
with each other the priority of  
their destructive innovations ; and

an acquiescence on the part of the United  
  
the late extension of the French decrees of  
November, 1806, is an object of just re­

The conduct of the French government,  
in giving this extended Operation to its de­

inasmuch as the inability to enforce it on

duced Congress to resort to an embargo on  
our own vessels, as a measure best fitted for  
the erisis, being an eﬀectual security for our  
mercantile property and mariners, now at  
home and daily striving, and, at the same  
tiine, neither a measure nor just cause of  
war.) Copies of this act were, soon after  
its passage, transmitted to Mr. Pinkney,  
with an authority to assure the British go­

be pronounced a retaliation on the preced-si

In remonstrating against the injustice and illegali­  
ty ol the French decree, I am aware that you may be  
reminded ol antecedent injuries to France and her al­  
lies, through British violations of neutral commerce.  
The fact cannot be denied, and may be urged with  
great force, in our remonstrances against the orders  
towhuh Great-Britain has given a retaliating cha­  
racter; since the French decree might, on the same  
ground, he pronounced a retaliation on the preceding  
conduct of Greut-Britain. But ought the legiti­  
mate commerce of neutralfct^ be Shus the victims  
aud the sport of belligerents,JjJntesting with each  
otHfer the priority of their destructive innovations;  
and without leaving, either ol them, to neutrals even  
tbeoppoilunity or the time for disproving that cul­  
pable acquiescence which is made the pretext by  
both, for the wrongs done to them ? And I must re­  
peat, that, apart from all questions of this nature,  
the French decree, or at least the illegal extensions  
of it to the United States, remain chargeable with all  
the impolicy which has been pointed mu.  
I find, by accounts from Hamburg, Bremen, Hol­  
land, and Leghorn, that the trade und property ol  
onr citizens have been much vexed by regulations  
subaltern to those of ihe original dtcice of No vein

“ Vour letters and conmunicuiions by Dr.  
Bulliis werd&#x27;di.lv delivered on the 14th dnv  
of December. The same conveyance brought  
a copv of tlte sentence pronounced by the  
French prize court in the case of the Hori­  
zon, giving a judicial effect to the decree of  
Nov. 21st, 1806, as expounded in the answer  
of Mr. Cbainpagny to your letter of the 12th  
November, 1807.  
U/klla »l,„ V-_1._i j;.» _ _•* _  
---— .. ..... ....i  
vow Or enforce a mraning of the decree of  
Nov. 1806, in relation to the United States,  
extending its purview beyond the municipal  
limits, it could notin strictnesspe regarded  
as an infraction either of our neutral or con­  
ventional rights; and consequently did not  
authorise more than a demand of seasonable  
explanations of its doubtful import, or friend -  
ly expostulations with respect tfi tlie rigor and  
suddenness of its innovations.  
The case now essehtiallv changed. A  
construction ot tlie decree i* avowed and ex­  
ecuted, which violates as well the positive  
stipulations of the convention of Sent. 30th,  
1800, as tlie incontestible principles of pub­  
lic law : and the President charges you to  
stiperadd to whatever representations vou  
may have previously made, a formal remon  
strance in such terms as may be best calcu­  
lated either to obtain a recall of the illegal  
measure, so far as it relates to the U. S. or  
to have the effect of leaving in full force all  
the rights accruing to them from a failure to  
do so.  
That the execution of local laws against  
foreign nations on the lwgh seas, is a violati­  
on of the rights of the former and tlie free­  
dom of the latter, will probably not be ques­  
tioned. A contrary principle would in  
fact imply the same exclusive dominion  
over the entire ocean, as is enjoyed within  
j tlie limits of the local sovereignty, and a  
j degradation of every other nation from its  
j common rights and equal rant,  
i If it be Contended that the decree, rs a re­  
taliation on the other belligerent,.at the ex­  
| pence of neutral nations, is justified by a cul­  
pable acquiescence in tlie prior measures of  
that belligerent, operating through neutrals,  
you will be able, to deny such acquiescence,  
; and to urge moreover that, on every mijimo­  
; sition, the retaliating measure could not lie  
justly inforced, in relation toheutrrds, without  
allowing them at least a reasonable time for  
chasing between due measures against thc  
prior wrong, and an acquiescence in both.  
The copy of tlie representations to the  
| tish government, through its minister here,  
on the subject of its orders of January, 1807,  
will at once disprove an acquiescence on the  
part of the United States, and explain thtf  
grounds on which tlie late extension of the  
French decree of November, 1806, is an ob­  
ject of just remonstrance.  
The conduct of the French government, in  
giving this extended operation to its decree,  
and indeed in issuing one with such an appa­  
rent or doubtful i -.port against the rights of  
the sea, is the mdre extraordinary, inasmuch  
as tlie inability to enforce it on that element  
exhibited the measure in the light of an emp­  
ty menace, at the same time that it afforded  
pretexts to her enemy for severe retaliations,  
for which ample means are found in her na­  
val superiority.  
  
I The accumulated danger*, to wlitcli the il­  
| legal proceedings of the belligerent nations  
have subjected the commerce and navigation  
! of the United States, have at length inriuc­  
etl Congress to resort to an embargo on our  
own vessels, as a measure hest fitted for the  
crisis, tiring an effectual security for our mer­  
cantile property and mariners, now at home  
and daily arriving, and, at the Inme time,  
neither a measure nor just cause of war. Co­  
pies of this act were, soon after its passage,  
I transmitted to Mr. Pinkney, With an autho­  
rity to assure the British government, that it  
was to lie viewo t in this light, and that it waft  
not meant to he the slight-*? impediment to  
amicable negociatiou* whh foreign govern­  
ments. lie was i euuesttd to avail himself,  
of an opportunity of communicating to yob &#x27;  
and Mr. Urvitij this view of the subject, and !  
1 hope that you will have been thence ena­  
bled topresent it to the French government, i  
’sot relying however, on&#x27;that indirect nppor­  
tunity, i send hv this another copy of the art,  
with an instruction from the President, that  
you make it the subject of such explanations  
as will guard against any misconception of  
the policy which led to it. It is strictly a  
measure of precaution, required by the dan­  
ger* incident to external commerce; and, be- ,  
ing indiscriminate in its terms and operation  
towards all nations, can give no just offence to  
any. The duration of the act is not fixed by  
itself ; and will consequently depend on a  
contimianc** or cessation of its causes, In a  
degree sufficient in the judgment of the le­  
gislature, to induce or forbid its repeal. It  
may bfc hoped that the Inconveniences felt  
from it by the bellig■•.rent nations may lead to  
a change of the conduct which imposed the  
incoiivenienc.es of if on ourselves. France  
herself will bra sufrcrer, and f.onie cfher al­  
lies far more so. It will be very agreeable to  
find in that consideration, and still more in  
her Sense of justice, a sufficient motive to  
inearly manifestation of the respect due to  
mr commercial rights. The extunplt* would  
be &quot;urthj of the professions w hich &#x27;.hr makes  
o the world on this subject.’*

In renuinvU-atnig ngiinsi the injustice nmi  
illegality of the Fre.;&lt;h decree, I am’  
aware that von may he reminded of an  
teccdent injuries to France and her al­  
hes, through British violations t»t neutral  
coinfne- ce 1 he f ict Cannot be denied anl  
may be urged with great force, in our remon­  
strances against the orders to which Great  
Hr.tain lijs given a retaliating character :  
•since the French decree might, on the same  
ground, lie pronounced a retaliation outlie  
preceding c.: rtduct of Greet Britain. But  
ought the legitimate commerce of neutrals  
to he tints tiic* victim and the sport of hdllige­  
rents, contesting with each other the prior­  
ity of their destructive innovations; and  
without leaiing, either of them, to neutrals  
even the opportunity or the time tor dixprn­  
\ ing that culpable acquiescence, which is  
made the pretekt by both, for the wrongs  
done to them f And I must repeat, that p­  
nurt from all questions of this nature, the  
trench decree, «»r at least tiic illegal exten­  
sions of it to the I T. States, remain chargeable  
with all the impolicy which has been pointed  
out.  
I find by accounts from Hamburg, Bremen,  
Holland and Leirhorn that it.«» .....i  
property of our citizens have been much  
vexed by regulations subaltern to those of the  
original decree of November 21, 1806. How  
tar the complaints are founded on proceedings  
violating our public rights, or on such as are  
unfriendly and inequitable towards our citi­  
zens, who have placed their property within  
those jurisdictions, you will be able to decide  
better than we can do at this distnnee ; and  
the Bresident refers to your own judgement  
the kind of representation to the French go­  
vernments which those anti other ttnalagous

MYourlctters and communications  
hr Dr. Hullus were duly delivered on  
the 11th dav of December. The  
same conveyance brought a copy o&#x27;  
the sentence pronounced bv the  
French prize court in the case ol the  
Horizon, giving a judicial effect to  
the decree of Nov. 2lst, 1806, ns ex­  
pounded in the answer of Mr. Cham­  
pagnv to your letter of the 12th No­  
vember, 1807.  
Whilst the French government did  
not avow or enforce a meaning of the  
decree of Nov. 1806, in relation to  
the United States, extending its [U •  
view beyond the municipal limits it  
could not in strictness be regarded  
as an infraction either of our neutral  
  
or conventional rights ; and conse­  
quently did not authorise more thar  
a demand of seasonable explanations  
of its doubtful import, or fViendl)  
expostulations with respect to th&lt;  
rigor and suddenness of its innovati  
ons.  
The case is now essentially chan  
ged. A construction of the decree i  
avowed and executed, which violatei  
as well the positive stipulations of th&lt;  
convention of Sept. 30th, 1800, as tin  
incontestihle principles of public law  
and the President charges you to su  
peradd to whatever representation)  
vou mav have previously made, a for  
mal remonstrance in such terms a  
may he best calculated either to obtait  
i recall of the illegal measures, so fa  
as it relates to the If. S.or to have th  
t (T/*ct of leaving in full force all th  
rights accruing to them from a failur  
to do so.  
That the execution of local law  
against foreign nations on the hig  
seas, is a violation of the rights of th  
former, and the freedom of the lattei  
will probably not be questioned, j  
  
contrary principle would in fact imply  
the same exclusive dominion over the  
entire ocean, as is enjoyed within the  
limits of die local sovereignty, and a  
degradation of every other nation  
from its common rights and equal  
rank.  
If it be contended that the decree,  
as a retaliation on the other bcihgir*  
cnl, .it the expense of neutral nations;  
is justified by a culpable acquiescence  
in the prior measures of that belliger­  
ent, operating through neutrals, you  
will he able to deny such acquiescence,  
and to urge moreover that, on every  
supposition, the retaliating measure  
could not be justly inforced, in relati­  
on to neutrals, without aliening them  
atleastarcasoiuble time forchusing be­  
tween due measures against the prior  
wrong, and an acquiescent in both.  
The copy of the representations to the  
British government, through its minis­  
ter here, on the subject of its orders of  
Janutry 1807, will at once disprove an  
acquiescence on the part of the U. S.  
and cXpl tin the g-ounds on which the  
late extension of the French decree of  
November, 180G, is an object of ju.t  
re m ous trance.  
1 lie conduct of the French govern­  
ment, in giving this extended operati­  
on to its decree, and indeed in issuing  
one with such an apparent or doubtful  
• nport against the rights of the sea,  
is the more extraordinary, inasmuch,  
as tile inability to enforce it on that  
element exhibited the measure in the  
light of an empty menace, at ihe same  
time that it afforded pretexts to her e­  
  
■••••V -v.v.w • vituiaiiuiiSf IVI ivmtll  
.uTtpl • means are fouud in hear naval  
superiority.  
The accumulated dangers, to which tho (&#x27;  
illegal proceedings of the belligerent nati­  
ons have subjected the commerce and n u  
/igatiouoi the United States, have at length  
induced congress to resort to an embargo  
°n our own vessels, as a measure best fitted  
for the crisis, being an effectual security  
for our mercantile property and mariners,  
now at home and daily arriving, and, at the  
s line time, neither a measure, nor just caaift  
of war. Copies of this act were, soon af.  
ter its passage, transmitted to Mr P.nkncj,  
with an authority to assure the Hritisli go­  
vernment that it was to be viewed in this  
light, and that it was not meant to be thor  
slightest impediment to amicable negocia...  
tiois with toreign governments, lie wasl  
requ sted to avail himself of an opportunl-r  
ty of communicating to you und vlr. &amp;r+  
viug this view of the subject, and i liopo  
that you will have been thence enabled io&lt;  
present it to the French government Nog  
relying however on that indirect opportu.  
nf&#x27;y, 1 send by this another copy of the act,  
with an inruction from rise president, mat  
vou make it the subject of such explanati­  
has us will guard against any misconception  
of the policy which led to it. It is smc.If *  
a measure of precaution, required by the !  
dangers incident to external commerce,  
anil, being indiscriminate in its terms nd  
operation towards all nations, can give nu  
just offence to any. The duration of the act  
is not fixed by itself; and will consequent­  
ly depend on a continuance or cessation ok4  
, its c«us&lt; s. in a degree sulli lent in th„- pi jg«/  
I nient of the legislature, 10 induce or foroid  
ns repeal. It may be Imped th .t the ns­  
cooveniencies felt from it by the belligerent  
nations may lead to a cha ige of tho con­  
duct which imposed the inconveniences of f  
it on ourselves. France hers ll will be a  
sufferer, and some of her allies far more so.  
It will be very agreeable to find in that con­  
sideration, and still more in her sense of  
justice, a sufficient motive to an early ma­  
nifest ition of the respect due to our com.  
mercial rights. The examp e would be  
worthy of the professions which she makes  
to the world on this subject.”  
“ February 18. Since the above was wrlt­

“ Your letters and communica­

pounded in the answer of Mr.  
Champagny to your letter of the  
12th Nov. 1*07.  
“ Whilst the French govern­  
ment did not avow or enforce n  
meaning of the decree of Novem­  
ber UK&amp;i to relation to the Uni­  
ted States, extending its perview  
beyond (he municipal limits, it  
could not in strictness be regarded  
as an infraction either of ourneu­

consequently - did not authorise  
more than a demand of seasons  
blc explanations of its doubtful  
import, or fricqdly expostulations  
with respect to the rigour and  
suddenness of its innovations.  
  
“ 1 Be CMC is MOW essentially  
changed. A construction of.the  
decree is avowed and executed,  
which violates as well the positive  
stipulations of the convention of  
Sept 30th, 1800, as the iacoo*

“ That tba aaccution of local  
laws against foreign nations on

and a degradation of every other

“If M be contended, jhat the

mini tier here, on the fubjtck of its  
orders of January, 1807, at once  
difprove an acquiefccncc en the. part  
of the United States, and explain the  
grounds on whicn the late extension  
of the French decree of November,  
1806, is an object of juft remon­  
ftrance.  
** 1 he conduct of the French  
government in giving this extended  
operation to its decree, and indeed  
in i(Tiling one with fuch an apparent  
or doubtful import againft the rights  
of the Teas, is the more extraordina­  
ry, inasmuch as the inability to en­  
force it cn that element, exhibited  
the meafure in the light of an empty  
menace, at the fame time that it af•  
forded pretexts to her enemy for fevere j  
retaliations for which ample means 1  
arc found in her naval fuperiority.  
  
The accumulated dangers to  
which the illegal proceedings of the  
belligerent nations have fubje&amp;ed the  
commerce and navigation of the U­  
nited States, have at length induced  
Congress to re fort to an embargo on  
our own veffels, as a measure beft  
fitted for the crifis, being an effectual  
fecurity for our mercantile property  
and mariners, now at home, and dai­  
ly arriving, and, at the fame time, nei­  
ther a mealure, nor juft caule, of war.  
Copies of this a&amp; were, loon after  
it* paft&#x27;agc, tranfmitted to Mr. Pinck­  
ney, with an authority to aflurc the  
Britifh government, that it was to be  
viewed in this light, and that it was  
not meant to be the flighted impedi­  
ment to amicable negociations with  
foreign governments- He was re­  
queftted to avail himfclf of an oppor­  
tunity of communicating to you and  
Mr. Erving this view of the fubjeft,  
and 1 hope that jou will have been  
thenae enabled to prefent it to the  
French government. Not rrly;ng  
however on rhat indirect opportuni­  
ty, I fend by this another copy of the  
acb, with an inftru&amp;ion from the  
Prefident, that you make it the fub­  
jettof fuch explanations as will guard  
agaiwft any misconception of the  
policy which led to it. It is Itri&amp;ly  
a meafure of precaution, required  
by the dangers incident to external  
commerce, and, being indiscriminate  
!  
  
in ns terms ana operation towards an  
nations, can give no juil offence to  
any —The duration of the act is  
not fixed by itfelf ; and will con/e­  
ijuently depend on a continuance or  
ceffation of its causes in a decree fuf­  
ficient in the jinlpm^irof the legis­  
lature, to induce or forbid its repeal.  
It may be hoped, that the inconvenien­  
ces feltfrom it by the belligerent nations %  
may lead to a change of the conduct  
which impofed the inconveniences of  
it on ourfielves. France herfelf will  
be a fufferer, and fome of her allies  
far more fo. It will be very agreeable -  
to find in that conlideration, and Hill  
more in her fenfe of juflice, a fuffi.

of the refpect due to cur commercial  
rights. The example would be worthy

he denied, and may be urged with  
great force in our remonftrances a­  
gainft the ordeis to which Great­  
Britain has given a retaliating char-|  
after j fmee the French decree j  
might, on the fame ground, be pro­  
nounced a retaliation on the preced-;  
ing conduct of Great-Britain. But {  
ought the legitimate commerce of  
  
neutrals to oe tnus tne victim and  
the fport of belligerents, contelting  
with each other the priority of tMr!  
deftru&amp;ive innovations ; and without  
leaving, either of them, to neutrals  
even the opportunity or the time for  
difapproving that culpable acquief­  
cence, which is made the pretext by  
both, for the wrongs done to them ?  
And I mufk repeat, that, apart from  
all queftiona of this nature,the French  
decree, or at lealt the illegal exten­  
fions of it to the United States, re­  
main chargeable with all the impo­  
licy which has been pointed out.  
44 I find, by accounts from Ham­  
burgh t Urcmcn, Holland and Legion:%  
that the trade and property of our  
citizens have been much vexed by  
regulations fubaltern to thofe of the  
original decree e*f November 21,  
1806.—-How far the complaints are  
founded on proceedings violating odf  
public tights, or cnjucb as are un­  
friendly and inequitable t -wards tur  
citizenJ, who have placed their pro­  
perty within thofe jurisdictions, you  
will be able to decide better than  
we can do at this diflance ; and the

12th article, which merely provides for the
