Sirs,  
					Quincy, June 10, 1809  
				  
				IN page 29. Mr. Hamilton says, &quot;when an ordinary  
man dreams himself to be a Frederick,&quot; &amp;c.To this I shall make but a short answer. When a Miss  
of the street shall print a pamphlet in London, and call  
the Queen of England an ordinary woman, who dreams  
herself a Catharine of Russia, no Englishman will have  
the less esteem for his queen for that impudent libel.There is something in the 24th page, of a graver complexion. It is said, “that the session which ensued the  
promulgation of the dispatches of our commissioners was  
about to commence. This was the session of 1798. Mr. Adams arrived at Philadelphia. The tone of his mind  
seemed to be raised.&quot;Let me ask a candid public, how did Mr. Hamilton  
know any thing of the tone of Mr. Adams’s mind, either  
before or at that conference? To make the comparison,  
he must have known the state of Mr. Adams’s mind at  
both these periods. He had never conversed with Mr.  
Adams before, nor was he present at that conference.  
Who was the musician that took the pitch of Mr. Adams’s  
mind, at the two moments here compared together?  
And what was the musical instrument, or whose exquisite  
ear was it that ascertained so nicely the vibrations of the  
air, and Mr. Adams’s sensibility to them? Had Mr. Hamilton a spy in the cabinet? Who transmitted to him,  
from day to day, the confidential communications between  
the President and heads of department? If there existed  
such a spy, why might he not communicate these conferences to Mr. Liston, or the Marquis Yrujo, as well as to  
Mr. Hamilton? He had as clear a right. I believe that  
all the privy councillors of the world but our own, are  
under an oath of secrecy; and ours ought to be. But as  
they are not, their own honor and sense of propriety  
ought, with them, to be obligations as sacred as an oath.The truth is, I had arrived at Philadelphia, from a long  
journey, which had been delayed longer than I intended,  
very much fatigued; and as no time was to be lost, I  
sent for the heads of departments, to consult, in the evening, upon the points to be inserted in the speech to Congress, who were soon to meet.My intention was, in the language of the lawyers,  
merely to break the questions, or moot the points necessary for us to consider; not intending to express any opinion of my own, or to request any opinion of theirs  
upon any point; but merely to take the questions into  
their consideration, and give me their advice upon all of  
them at a future meeting.I observed, that I found, by various sources of information, and particularly by some of the newspapers in  
Boston and New-York, that there was a party who expected an unqualified recommendation of a declaration  
of war against France.These paragraphs, I was well satisfied, were written by  
gentlemen who were in the confidence and correspondence of Hamilton and one of the heads of departments at  
least, though I gave them no intimation of this.I said to the gentlemen, that I supposed it would be  
expected of us, that we should consider this question, and  
be able to give our reasons for the determination, whatever it might be.The conduct of the gentlemen upon this question was  
such as I wished it to be upon all the others. Not one of  
them gave an opinion either for or against a declaration  
of war. There was something, however, in the total silence and reserve of all of them, and in the countenances  
of some, that appeared to me to be the effect of disappointment. It seemed to me, that they expected I should have  
proposed a declaration of war, and only asked their advice  
to sanction it. However, not a word was said.That there was a disappointment, however, in Hamilton and his friends, is apparent enough, from this consideration—that when it was known that a declaration of  
war was not to be recommended in the President’s speech,  
a caucus was called of members of Congress, to see if  
they could not get a vote for a declaration of war, without  
any recommendation from the President, as they had  
voted the alien and sedition law, and the army. What  
passed in that caucus, and how much zeal there was in  
some, and who they were, judge Sewall can tell better  
than I. All that I shall say, is, that Mr. Hamilton’s  
friends could not carry the vote.My second proposition to the heads of departments was  
to consider, in case we should determine against a declaration of war, what was the state of our relations with  
France, and whether any further attempt at negociation  
should be made.Instead of the silence and reserve with which my first  
question was received, Mr. Hamilton shall relate what  
was said.Mr. Hamilton says, &quot;It was suggested to him, Mr.  
Adams, that it might be expedient to insert in the speech,  
a sentiment of this import, that after the repeatedly rejected advances of this country, its dignity required that it  
should be left with France, in future, to make the first  
overture: that if desirous of reconciliation, she should  
evince the disposition, by sending a minister to this government; he would be received with the respect due to  
his character, and treated with, in the frankness of a sincere desire of accommodation. The suggestion was received in a manner both indignant and intemperate.&quot;I demand again, how did Mr. Hamilton obtain this information? Had he a spy in the cabinet? If he had,  
I own I had rather that all the courts in Europe should  
have had spies there; for they could have done no harm  
by any true information they could have obtained there;  
whereas Hamilton has been able to do a great deal of mischief, by the pretended information he has published.It is very true, that I thought this proposition intended  
to close the avenues to peace, and to ensure a war with  
France; for I did believe that some of the heads of departments were confident, in their own minds, that  
France would not send a minister here.From the intimate intercourse between Hamilton and  
some of the heads of departments, which is demonstrated  
to the world and to posterity, by this pamphlet, I now  
appeal to every candid and impartial man, whether there  
is not reason to suspect and to believe, whether there is  
not a presumption, a violent presumption, that Hamilton  
himself had furnished this machine to his correspondent  
in the cabinet, for the very purpose of ensnaring me, at unawares, of ensuring a war with France, and enabling  
him to mount his hobby horse, the command of an army  
of fifty-thousand, ten thousand of them to be horse?Hamilton says, &quot;the suggestion was received in a manner both indignant and intemperate.&quot; This is false. It  
is true, it was urged with so much obstinacy, perseverance  
and indecency, not to say intemperance, that at last I declared I would not adopt it, in clear and strong terms.Mr. Hamilton says, &quot;Mr. Adams declared, as a sentiment he had adopted on mature reflection, that if France  
should send a minister here to-morrow, he would order  
him back the day after.&quot;Here I ask again, where, how, and from whom did he  
get this information? Was it from his spy in the cabinet? Or was it the fabrication of his own &quot;sublimated,  
excentric,&quot; and intemperate imagination? In either case,  
it is an entire misrepresentation.I said that when in my retirement at Quincy, the idea  
of the French government sending a minister here, had  
sometimes occurred to me, my first thoughts were, that I would send him back the next day after his arrival, as a retaliation for their sending ours back; and because the  
affront offered to us had been at Paris, publicly, in the  
face of all Europe the atonement ought to be upon the  
same theatre; and because, as the French government  
had publicly and officially declared that they would receive no minister plenipotentiary from the United States  
until the President had made apologies for his speeches  
and answers to addresses, they ought to be made to retract and take back that rash declaration, on the same  
spot where it had been made. They might send a minister here, consistently with that offensive declaration. This was my first thought; but upon mature reflection,  
I saw that this would not be justifiable; for, to retaliate  
one breach of principle by another breach of principle,  
was neither the morality nor the policy that had been  
taught me by my father and my tutors. Our principle was, that the right of embassy was sacred. I would  
therefore sacredly respect it, if they sent a minister here.  
But I would not foreclose myself from sending a minister  
to France, if I saw an opening for it, consistent with our honor: in short, that I would leave both doors and all  
doors wide open for a negociation. All this refutation  
came from myself, not from the heads of departments.All that he says in this place and in the beginning of  
the next page, of my wavering, is false. My mind never underwent any revolution or alteration at all, after I left Quincy. I inserted no declaration in my speech, that I  
would not send a minister to France; nor any declaration,  
that if France would give assurances of receiving a minister from this country, I would send one. Nothing like  
that declaration was ever made, except in my message to  
Congress, of the 21st of June, 1798, in these words: “I will never send another minister to France, without  
assurances that he will be received, respected and honored, as the representative of a great, free, powerful and  
independent nation.&quot; This declaration finally effected  
the peace.  
Both the doors of negociation were left open. The  
French might send a minister here without conditions—we might send one to France, upon condition, of a certainty that he would be received in character.What conduct did the French government hold, in  
consequence of this declaration? They retracted their  
solemn and official declaration, that they would receive  
no minister plenipotentiary, in future, from the United  
States, without apologies from the President, for his  
speeches and answers to addresses. They withdrew, and  
expressly disavowed all claims of loans and doucœurs,  
which had been held up in a very high tone. They even  
gave encouragement, I might say they promised, to make  
provision for an equitable compensation for spoliations.—They promised to receive our ministers, and they did  
receive them, and made peace with them—a peace that  
completely accomplished a predominant wish of my heart  
for five and twenty years before, which was, to place our  
relations with France and with Great Britain, upon a  
footing of equality and impartiality, that we might be able  
to preserve, in future, an everlasting neutrality in all the  
wars of Europe.I see now, with great pleasure, that England professes  
to acknowledge and adopt this our principle of impartiality, and I hope that France will soon adopt it too. The  
two powers ought to see, that it is the only principle we  
can adopt with safety to ourselves, or justice to them. If  
this is an error, it is an error in which I have been invariably and unchangeably fixed for five and thirty years, in the whole course of which I have never seen reason to  
suspect it to be an error, and I now despair of ever discovering any such reasons.Nevertheless, Mr. Hamilton calls the declaration that  
accomplished all this, &quot;a pernicious declaration!&quot;Pernicious it was to his views of ambition and domination. It extinguished his hopes of being at the head of a  
victorious army of fifty thousand men; without which,  
he used to say, he had no idea of having a head upon his shoulders for four years longer.Thus it is, when self-sufficient ignorance impertinently  
obtrudes itself into offices and departments, in which it  
has no right, nor color, nor pretence to interfere.Thus it is, when ambition undertakes to sacrifice all  
characters, and the peace of nations, to its own private  
interest.I have now finished all I had to say on the negociations  
and peace with France, in 1800—I find I must say something of the peace with England, in 1783.In the meantime, when I look back on the opposition  
and embarrassments I had to overcome, from the faction  
of British subjects, from that large body of Americans  
who revere the English and abhor the French, from some  
of the Heads of Departments, from so many gentlemen in  
Senate, and so many more in the House of Representatives, and from the insidious and dark intrigues as well as  
open remonstrances of Mr. Hamilton, I am astonished at  
the event.In some of my jocular moments I have compared myself to an animal I have seen, take hold of the end of a  
cord with his teeth and be drawn slowly up by pullies,  
through a storm of squibs, crackers, and rockets, flashing  
and blazing round him every moment: and though the  
scorching flames made him groan, and mourn, and roar,  
he would not let go his hold till he had reached the ceiling of a lofty theatre, where he hung sometime, still suffering a flight of rockets, and at last descended through  
another storm of burning powder, and never let go, till  
his four feet were safely landed on the floor.In some of my social hours I have quoted Virgil:Fata obstant, placidasque viri Deus obstruit aures.Ac velut annoso validam cum robore quercumAlpini Boreæ nunc hinc nunc flatibus illincEruere inter se certant; it stridor; et altæConsternunt terram concusso stipite frondes:Ipsa hæret scopulis: et quantum in virtice ad aurasÆtherias, tantum radice in Tartara tendit.Haud secus assiduis hinc atque hinc vocibus herosTunditur, et magno persentit pectore curas.Mens immota manet: lacrimæ volvuntur inanes.Lib. 4. 440.His hardened heart nor prayers nor threatening move;Fate and the Gods had stopp’d his ears,As when the winds their airy quarrels try,Justling from every quarter of the sky;This way and that the mountain oak they bend,His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;With leaves and falling mast, they spread the ground.The hollow vallies to the echo sound:Unmov’d the sturdy plant, their fury mocks,Or shaken, clings more closely to the rocks:Far as he shoots his towering head on high,So deep in earth his deep foundations lie;No less a storm the Trojan hero bears;Thick messages and loud complaints he hears,And bandied words still beating on his ears.Sighs, groans and tears, proclaim his inward pains,But the firm purpose of his heart remains.  
Dryden, B. 4. 186.But this is all levity. There have been sober hours,  
not a few: and I know not that there has been one, in  
which I have not adored that Providence of Almighty  
God, which alone could have carried me safely through,  
to a successful issue, this transaction and so many others,  
equally difficult, and infinitely more dangerous to my life,  
if not to my reputation.

To this I shall make but a short answer.  
When a Miss of the street shall print a g.mo  
phiet in London, and call the Queen of &quot;.

Catharine of Russia, no Englishman. will  
have the léss esteem for his queen for that

here is something in the 24th page, of  
a graver complexion. It is said, * that the  
session which ensued the promulgation of the  
despatches of our commissioners was about  
to commence, This wasthe session of 1798,  
Mr. Adams arrived at Philadeiphia. The  
‘tonie of his mind uo?ed to be n‘god» Ta)iaan b  
Lot me usk a candid publick, how did Mr.  
Hamilton know ary thing of the tone of Mr.  
Adamg® wind, either belore or ¢ that con­  
ference 2 To make the comparisen, he must  
have known the stute of Mr. Adams’ mine:  
at both these periods. He hud never convers­  
ed with Mr, ann before, nor was he pre­  
sent ot thut conference. \i’ho was the nmo  
cian that teok the pitch of Mr. Adamy’  
mind, at thie two moments here compered  
together ! And what fvas the musicul ips  
strument, or whose exquisite ear was it that  
ascertuined o nicely the vibrations of the air,  
and Mr. Adams’ sensibility to them ! Had  
Mr. Hamilton o spy in the cabinet ! Whe  
trensmitted to him, from day to day, the con­  
fidential communcations between the Presi­  
dent und heads of departments { If there ex­  
isted such a spyy, why might he not commu­  
nicate these confercnces to Mr, Liston, or  
the Marquis Yrujo, as well as to Mr. Hamil­  
ton? Je bad as clear a right. I believe  
that all the privy counsellors of the world Lut  
our own, are under an outh of secrecy ; and  
ours ought to be. But as they are noty their  
awn honour wnd sense of propriety ought,  
with them, to be olligations «s sacred asan  
outh.  
  
Uhe truth is, I had arrived at Philadelphioy  
from a long journey, which had been deluyed  
longer than 1 intended, very much fatigued §  
and a 8 no time was to be lost, I sent for the  
heads of departments,to consult, in the even­  
ing, upon the points to be inserted in the  
speech to Congress, who were soon to meet.  
My intention was, in the langusge of the  
lawyers, merely to breek the gquestiens, or  
moot the peints necessary for us to consider ;  
not intending to oxpress any opinion of my  
OWEy 4F to reyuest any opinion of theirs upon  
any point ; but ‘mere ¥ 10 tuke the ¢uestions  
into their considerstion, end gite me thelsy  
advice upon all of them &amp;t a futuie meeting.  
I observed, that 1 found, by verious sour­  
ces of informution, end purticulerly by seme  
of the newspapers in Boston and New York,  
that there was a party who expected an uns  
qualified recommenaation of » declartion of  
war against France, :  
. These paragrapbs, I was well satisfed,  
were written by gentlemen who were in the  
confidence and correspundence of Hamilton,  
und one of the heads of depurtments at least, .  
though I gave them no intimation of this,  
! suid to the gentlemen, that I supposed it  
would be expected of us,y that we should con­  
sider this uestioh, and be able to give ouy  
reasons for the determination, whatever it  
‘might be. :  
&#x27;?’he conduct ef the %clmlemcn upon this  
question ‘was such as 1 Wished it to be upos  
all the others. Not one of them gave an  
opinicn cither for or ugninst a declaration of  
war. There was something, however, in the  
total silence and reserve of wll of them, and in  
the countenance ol some, that appeared to  
me to be the effect of disappointment. It  
seemed to me, that they expected I should  
have proposed a declaration of war,. and only  
usked their advice to sanction it. However,  
pot ‘a word wus said, .  
  
That there wers a cdisappointment, hows­  
ever, in Hamilton aad his friends, is apparent  
enough, from this consilerationethat when  
it was known that a declaration of war was  
not to be recommended in the President&#x27;s  
speechy &amp; caucus was called, of meémbers of  
Congress, to sce if they could not get &amp; vote  
for a declaration of wary without any recom­  
mendation from the President, as they had  
voted the alien and sedition law and the army.  
What pasced in that cautus, and how much  
zeal there wes in somaey ahd whe they were,  
judge Sewal? can tell better than k. All thas  
I shall ¢ay, is, that Mr. Humbleon&#x27;s fricnds  
could not carry Qo vote. Al  
My second proposition to the heads of des  
patuments was to consider in case nﬂu

that all the cdurts in&quot;E&#x27;:kpe should have had

und to ensure a war with France ; for [ did  
‘believe that some of the heads of departments

&quot;~ I&#x27;rom the intimite intercotirss between

¢nd 1o posterity, by this pumphiet, I now ap­  
peal to every candid and impartial man, whe­  
ther there is lot reason to suspect and to be­  
fieve, whether there is not 2 presumption, a  
‘wiplent presumption, that Humilton himself  
&quot;Nad farnished this inachine to his correspon­

rcﬁecti’m, that if France should send a minis­  
ter here to-morrow, he would order him  
back the day after.”  
  
Here 1 ask again, where, how, and from  
whom did he get this information 7 Was it  
{rom bis spy in the cabinet 7 Or was it the  
fubrication of his own ¢ sublimated, excent­

either cade, it is an entire misrepreseintation.  
I said that when in my retirement at Quin­

ding a minister here had sometinmes occured  
to me, my first thoughts were, that I would  
“send himi back the next day aficr his arri­  
val, as a retaliation for their sending ours  
back ; and because the afivont oitered to us  
had been at Puris, publickly, in the face of all  
Eurepe, the atoncment ought to be upon the  
same theatre 3 and because, as the French  
governmant had pubiickly and officially de­  
clared that they would reecive no minister  
plenipoténtiary from the United States until  
the President had made apologies for his  
speeches and answers to addresses, they  
ought to be made to retract and take back that  
rash declaration, on the same spot where it  
had been made. They might send a minis­  
ter here, consistentiy with that oifensive de­  
claration. IT&#x27;his was my first thought ; but  
upen maiuce reflectiony I saw that this would  
not be justifi.ble : for,to retaliate one breach  
of principle by another breach of principle,  
was neither tie morality nor the policy that  
had been taught e by my father and my tu­  
tors. Our priaciple was, that the rignt of  
embuassy was sacred. I would therefore sac­  
rediv respect it, if they sent a minister here.  
But I would not foreciose myselfl from send;  
ing « minister to rance, il I saw an open­  
ing for it, consistent with our honour ; in  
short, that I would leave both doors and ali  
doors open for a negociation. All this reluta­  
tion came from myself not from the heads of  
departments, .  
- All that he says in this place and in the be­  
gining of the next page, of my wavering, is  
salse. My mind never underwent any revolu-  
LJtion or alteration at all, after Ileft Quincy. I  
dnserted no declaration in my speech, that I  
svould not send a miister to France&#x27;; nor any  
declaration, that il France would give assar­  
ances of receiving a minister from this coun­  
try, I would send one. Nothing like that de­  
claration was ever made, except in.my mes­  
sage to Congress, of the 21st June 1798, in  
these words : “ I will never send another  
suninister to &#x27;rance, without assurances that he  
wili be received, m?octed and honoured, as  
the Representative of a great, froe, powerful  
and independent nation,” This declaration  
finally affected the peace. |  
Both the doors of negociation were left  
open. The French might send a minister  
here without conditions—we might send one  
to France upon condition, of a certainty that  
he would be received in character.  
What conduct did the French government  
Jboldy in consequence of this declaration ?  
‘They retracted their solemn and official de­  
claration, that they would receive no minister  
plonipotentiary,in future, from the U.S. with­  
out amogi« from the . Presidenty for his  
speechies and answers to addresses. They  
withdeew, and expressly disavowed all claims  
©! lpans and doucceurs, .‘wts&#x27;fb had been held  
aip in a&#x27;very high tone. They even gave en-  
Wgﬂt, I might say they promised, to  
make provision for an equitable ::ruﬂun  
Jov spoliations. = They vpromi receive  
nu:ﬂdﬁ!cu, and they did receive them, and  
ade peace with them——a peacé that coms  
‘ plished a predominant wish of  
my hpart for five and twenty years before  
which was to place our relations with France  
d with Great Britain, upon a of  
e (wality and impartiality, that we might be «-  
ble to pre in future, an everlasting ncu-  
Lol m grest pleasure, that Fng-  
Jand o acknow&#x27;edoe and adobt this

. ; f. 9t 3  
ers ought to see, that ic is the only priaciple  
rggp,thpt #nb safety to oursclves, or jus­

&quot;::l in whic:xldh;veﬁbm izvn}:-&#x27;\qlﬂy and un--  
cl cabl ed for five and thirty vears, in  
the mymmorm ﬂmvynver seen  
reason to suspect it to he an errourand I now  
despair of ever discovering any such reasons.  
!ye&#x27;venbc!ess, Mr. Hamiltoh calls the de­  
claration that accomplished all this, ¢ a per­  
nicious declaration !” N .  
Pernicigus it was to his views of ambition |  
and dom?atiou. It extinguished his hopes  
of being at the head of a victorious army ol  
fifty thousand men; without which, he gsed  
to say, he had no idea of having a head upon  
his shoulders for four years longer.  
Thus it is, when sclfesufficient igrorance  
impertinently obtrudes itsclf into ofiices and  
departments, in which it has no right nor  
colour, nor pretence to interfere.  
« Thus it is, when ambition undertales to  
sacrifice all characters, and the peace of n.-  
tions, to its own private interest.  
I have now finished all I had to say on the  
negociations and peace with France, i 1800.  
I find I must say scmething of the peace  
with England, in 1783, .  
In the mcantime, when I look back on the ‘  
opp%oition and embarrassments I had to over­  
come, from the facticn of DBritish subjects,  
from that large body of Americans who re- ‘  
vere the English and abhor the Frenchyfrom |  
some of the Heads of Departments, from so.  
many gentlemen in Senate, and so many more  
in the House of Representatives, and from the  
insidious and dark intrigues as well as open  
remonstrances of Mr. Hamilton, T am aston­  
ished at the event. 1  
In some of my jocular moments I have ‘  
compared mysell to an animal I have scen, ‘  
take hold the end of a cord with his teeth and  
be drawn slowly up by pullies through a storm 1  
of squibs, crackers, and rockets, lushing and  
blazing round him every moment and though |  
the scorching flames made him groun, and  
mourn, and roar, he would not let go his hold  
till he had reached the celling of 4 lofty thea­  
tre, where he hung sometime, still suffering  
a flight of rockets, and at lust descended  
through another storm of burning powder and  
never let go, till his four feet were suleiy lan­  
ded on the floor,  
In some of my social hours I hive quoted,  
Virgil :  
  
Fata obstent, placidasgue viri Deus obstruit aures.  
Je velut annoso validam cumrobore giercuwm  
Alpini Boree nune hine nunc fatibus illine  
Eruere inter se certant ; it ctridor ; et akte  
Consternunt terram concusso stipite fronces -  
Ipsa havet scopulis ¢ et quantum in viriic: ad auras  
JEthepias, tantwm radice in Tartara tendit,  
Favd secus assiduis line atque. hine vecilus heros  
Qunditur, et magno persencit pectore curds.  
JMens immota manet } lacrime volwuntur e,  
&#x27; Lib. 4. 440.  
  
His hardened heart nor prayers nor threal’ning move  
Fate and the Gods had stopp’d his ears,  
As when the winds their airy quarrels try,  
Justling from cvery quarter of &quot; the sky ;  
This way and that the mountain oak they bend,  
His boughs they shatter, and his branches rg d ;  
With leawves am{felling mast, they spread the groimd,  
The hollow vallies to the echo sound ,  
Ummnov&#x27;d the sturdy plant, their fury mocks, -  
Or shaking, clings more elosely to the rocks :  
Far as he shoots his towering head on high,  
$o deep in carth bhis deep foundations lie ;  
No less a storm the Trojan hero beaws ; :  
Thick messages and loud comnluints Lic hears,  
And bandied words still beating on his cars.  
Sighs, groans and tears, prockwim his inward pains,  
But the firm purpose of his heart remains.  
Dryden, B. 4. 186.  
  
But this is all levity. *There have been  
sober hours, not a few : and I know not that  
there has been one, in which I have not ador­  
ed that Providence of Almighty God, which  
alone could have carricd me safely through,  
to a successful issue, this transaction and so  
many others, equally difficult, and infinitely  
more dangerous to my life, if not to my rep­  
utation. JOIIN ADAMS

IN page 29, Mr. Hamilton fays,  
“ when an ordinary man dreams him­  
feif to be a Frederick,” &amp;e. =  
- Tothis I shall make but a shore an­  
{wer. When a Miss of the Rreet shall  
print 2 pamphlet in London, and call  
the Queen of Eagland an ordinary  
wortan, who dreams herfelf a Cathar­  
(ine X Ruflia,no Englith man will have  
| the fefs esteem for his queen for that  
iwpndent el  
o Bhwere ifdaigihiing in the. 2t  
page, of a graver complexion. It is  
said, that the feflion which ensued  
rhcewmn%nﬁbﬂ of the dispatches of  
. our commillionets was about to com.  
¥ mence. This&#x27;wasthe feflion of 1798.  
  
Me. Adams arrived at Philadelphia.  
‘ The tone of his mind seemed to be rai.  
fed.” s  
~ Letmealka candid public, how  
- did Mr. Hamilton know any thiog of  
“the wane of Mr. Adams’s mind, &amp;iher  
before or at that conference ? * To  
make the comparison, he ma®t have  
known the Rate of Mr. Adams’s mind  
at both these petiods. e had never  
conversed with Mr. Adams before,  
nor was he present at that conference.  
Who was the musician that took the  
pitch of Mr. Adams’s mind, at the  
two maments Lete compared tégerh­  
er 2 And whatwas the mufiedl infru­  
‘ment, or whife exquisite ear was it  
that efcertained {5 nicely the vibrarions  
of the air, and Mr. Adams’s sensibility  
to them ? Had Mr. Hamilton ‘a spy  
in the cabinet ! Who transmitted g  
him, from day to day, the confidential  
communicationsbetween the President  
and heads of departments ? If there  
existed fuch&#x27;a spy, why might he not  
com@municate thafe conferences to Mr.  
Liston, or the Marqais Yrujo, as well  
as to Mr. Hamilton ?* He had as clear  
a right. &#x27; T believe that all the privy  
councillots of the world But our own  
are vader ‘aff oath” of secrecy ; and  
ours ouzlit to be. &quot;But as they are  
not, their own honor and sense of pro­  
priety ought, wiih them, to be obliga­  
tions as sacred as ah oath. &#x27;  
The-truth i, I had arvived at Fhil­  
adelphia, from a-long journey, which  
had been delayed longer than [ inten­  
ded, very much fatigu=d&#x27;; and asno  
tie &#x27; was to be lofl, I fant for the beads  
of departments, to consult, in the  
evening, upon the poiats ts be inserted  
in the speech to Congrels, who were  
soon to meet. ;  
My intention was, in the lanpiiage  
of the lawyers, merely to break the  
queitions, er moct the points necessary  
for us to confider ; not iatending to  
express any copinion of my own, or to  
repuelt any opinion of theirs upon any  
point 3 but merely to tike the ques­  
tions into their consideration, and give  
me their advice upon ali of thens at a  
future meeting. =  
I observed, that I found, by various  
sources of informatien, and particu.  
larly by some of the newspapers in  
Boston and New-York, that there was  
a party who expe®ed an unquahified  
lecommendation of a declaration of  
war againll France. -.-  
Thele paragraphs, I was well fatif­  
fiel, were written by gentlemen who  
were in the confidence and correfpon­  
of Hamilton and one of the heads of  
departments at lealt, though I gave  
them no intimation of this.  
  
I said to the gentlemen, that I sup.  
poled 1t would be expe&amp;ad of us, that  
we should confider this question, and  
be able to give .oar reafuns for the  
deiermination, whatever it might  
be.  
‘The condud of the gentlemen upon  
this quelflion was such 2s I withed it  
to be upon all the others. Not, one  
of themy gave an opinion either for o 1  
againlt.a declaration of war, There  
was something, however, in the total  
silence and reserve of all of them, and  
in the -countenances of some, that ap­  
peated to me to be the eff:&amp; of difl­  
appointtment. It seemed to me, that  
they expeéted I thould have propoled  
&#x27;a declaration of war and ounly asked  
their advice to fan&amp;ionit. However,  
not a word was {aid. ,  
That there was a difappsintment,  
however, in Hamiltop and his friends,  
is apparent enough, from this consid­  
eration—that when it was known that  
a declaration of war was not ta bere­  
commended in the President’s speech,  
a caucus was called, of members of  
Congress, to fee i¥they could not get  
a vote for a declaration of war, with­  
out any recommendation from the  
Prefident,as they had voted the alien  
and sedition law and the army. What  
pafled in that caucus and. how much  
_zeal there was in some, and who they  
were, jidge Sewall cap tell better than  
I. Allbat I fhallfay, is, that Mr.  
- Hamilwon’s friends could not carry  
the vote. o Tt e  
My second proposition to the be, 4  
~of departments was 1o conf’jier in  
E case we should detcrming againkt a  
- declaration of war, Vilvar was the fiate  
~of our relations, %pith- Franee, and  
- whether any feither attempe at nego­  
-~ ciation fhe%id be made: -  
Infzad of the filencéand reserve  
- with which my sirs question was re­  
- ceived,Mr, Hamilton shall relate what  
w;»ﬁmi. et £O N MR  
&#x27; Mr: Hamilton fays; ¢lt was fug­  
&#x27; gelted to him, Mr. Adams, ;‘h:;g;  
  
; [TWO DOLLS. ?ER ANA’I}M-]  
  
might be expedient to infeit in the  
Ipeech, a fentimerit of this import,that  
after the repeatedly rejeéled advances  
of this country, its dignity required  
that it thould be left with France, in  
tuture, to make the firft overture&#x27;s  
that if desirous of seconciliation, f{he  
ﬂ}ould evince the disposition, by fen­  
ding a minister to this government g  
he would be received with the refpe@  
f!ue te his Chﬁ&#x27;a&amp;r, and treagei{!*hh’  
in the franknefs of a finc &#x27; desire of  
accommodation. frbe fuggemmg  
Feceived A a manuer both indignant  
and intemperate.” 3  
I demand again, how ¢4 Mr.  
Hamiiton obtain&#x27; shis informstion 2  
‘Hag he g spy -in the cabinet 2lf he  
bad, [ own Lhad rather that sll the  
courts in Europe should have had spier

could have obrained thepr§ Whereas  
Hamilton has begn &#x27;ablr&#x27;to do a great  
deal of mifchief, bythe pretended in~  
formation he haspublithed. - !  
It is very true, that I thought this  
proposition intended to close the aves  
nues to peace, and to enfur® 4 war  
with France ; for I did believe that  
some of the heads of departments  
were confident, in their own minds,  
that France would not fend a minister  
here. b Pk  
From the intimaie intercow:fe be­  
tween H.miiton and some of the heads  
of departments, which is demorftra.  
tzd to the world and to posterity, by  
this pamphlet, I now appeal to every  
candid and impartial man, &quot; whether  
there is ot reason to lufpe@d and to  
believe,whether there is not a prefumpa  
tion,a violeot prefumption,that Ham.  
ilton himfelf had furnithed this mae  
chine to his correspondent in the cabe  
inet, for the very purpole of ensnaring  
me, at unawares, of ensuring a war  
with France and enabling him to  
mount Lis liobby horse, the command  
of an army of filty-thoufnd, ten-thou  
sand of them to be horse ?  
- Hamilton fays,* the foggeltion was  
received in @ manner both indignant  
zood mtemperate.” This is falfe. It  
is true, it was urged with so much  
obltinacy, perseverance and indecency,  
not to fay intemperance; that at last L  
declared I would not adopt it, in clear  
and firong terms.  
Mr. Hamilton fiys, ¢ Mr. Adsms  
declared, as a sentiment he had adopt.  
ed on mature refl-&amp;ion, that if France  
should fend 2 minister here to morrow,  
he would order him back the day  
after.”  
  
Heie I ask again, where, how, and  
from whom did he get this infnrmg‘.  
tion ¥ Was it from his spy in the cab-.  
inet.? Or was it the fabrication of %4ig  
own *‘*fublimated, excentric,” /and  
intemperate &#x27; imagiration ? In rther  
case, it is an entire misrepresentation.  
I said that when in my refirement  
at Quincy, the idea of tlfe French  
government fending a mjmifter here,  
had sometimes occurredf to me, my  
firt thoughts were, thg,é‘l would fend  
him back the next djy after his arri­  
val, as a re taliation‘f/gr their fending  
ours back ; and because the affiont  
offered to us hag been at Puris, pube  
licly, in the facé of all Europe, the a­  
tonement oughit to be upon the fame  
theatre ; a;uf because, as the French  
government had publicly and cfficial­  
ly declﬁt‘/cd that they would receive  
no migitter Plenipotentiary from the  
United States until the President had  
made apologies for his speeches and  
answers to addresses, they oupght to  
be made 10 retra@ and take back that  
rash declaration, on the fame spot  
where it had been made. They&quot;ighg  
fend a minilter hete, confiltently wih  
that offenfive declaration. This was  
my firt thought ; but wpspy mature  
refle@tion, Ifaw that ¥is would not  
be juftifiable ; fory, (o retaliate one  
breach of princip’e by another breach  
of pr &#x27;“&#x27;C&#x27;PIC: Was neither the morality  
nor the po¥&#x27;cy that had been taught  
me b}’ “iny father and my tutors. Our  
PtPciple was, that the:right of embaf-  
Fy was sacred. I would therefore sa­  
credly refpeét-it, if they sent a minister  
here. * But I would not forecli fe my­  
{felf from fending a minister o France,  
(if I saw an opening for it, consistent  
‘with our honor ; in short, that I  
would leave both doors and all doors  
wide open for a negotiation. All this  
tefutation came from myfelf; not from:  
_the heads of departments, -  
Al that be fays in this place and  
_in the beginning of the next page, of

inserted no declaration in my speech |  
that I would not fend a minister to  
France ; nor any declaration, tkat if  
France would give afforances of rc.  
ceiving a minister from this country,  
I would fend one. Nothing like that |  
declaration was ever made, except in  
my meflage to Congrets, of the 218  
of June, 1798, in these words: ¢« I 3  
wiil never fend anothcr minilter to  
¥rance, without aflurances that he  
will be received,refpected and hooored,  
as the representative of a great, free, |  
‘powerful and independent natiou.”  
This declaration finally c¢ffc&amp;ed the |  
peace. e  
Both the doors of negotiation were  
left open. The French might fead a  
minister here without conditions—we  
.. gight fend oae to France, upon con­  
_dition, of a certainty that he would be  
- yeceived in charaéter.  
What condu&amp; did the French gov­  
- _ernment hold, in consequence of this  
. declaration? They retra&amp;ed their fol­  
-emn and official declaration, that they  
wouald receive no minißer pienipoten­  
tiary, in’ fature, from the United  
.+ States, without apologics from the  
-+ - President, for his {peeches and answers  
to addreffzss. They withdrew, and  
exprefily disavowed all claims of  
&quot; ¢ loans and €oucceurs, which had been  
  
held vp iz a very ligh tone: They  
-even gzve encouragement, I might  
day they promised, to make provision  
“ P_an. equitable compensation for {po-

. which was, to place ourselations with

. that we might be able to preserve, in  
. Tuture, an everla Ring neutrality in all

I fee now, with great pleasure, that

adopt this our principle of impartiali­  
ty, and I hape that France will too.  
- The two powers ought tofee, that it is  
-the ouly principle we can adopt with

- 4f this ¥s an. error, it is an error lin  
which 1 have been invariably and un­

-1 have never seen reason to fulpe it  
. to be&#x27;an error; and 1 now despair of  
-ever diicovering any such reasons.  
. Nevertheless, Mr. Hamilton calls  
the declaration that accomplithed all  
. this, ¢ a pernicious declaration !  
Peraicious it was to his views of  
ambition and domination. It extin.  
guifhed his hopes of being at the head  
of a vi&amp;orious army of fifty thousand  
men ; without which, he used to fay,  
_he had no idea of having a head  
upon his shoulders for four years lon­  
oer. : : e

ance impertinently obtrudes itfe!f into

Thus it is, when ambition under­  
takes to facrifice alt chara&amp;ers&#x27;and the  
peace of nations, to its own private in­

I had to&quot;?vercome, from the fa&amp;ion  
of Britifh&#x27; fubje@s, from that large  
body of Americans who revere the  
Englith and abhor the French, from  
some cf the Heads of Departments,  
from so many geatlemen in Senate,  
and so many morz in the House of  
Representatives, and form the infidu.  
ous and dark intrigues as well as open  
remonstrances of Mr.. H_amilcon, lam  
altonifhed at the event. &#x27;

have compared myfelf to an&#x27;arimal 1

cord with his teeth and be drawn  
slowly up by pullies, through a fiorm  
of squibs, @ ackers, and rockets, fl:fh.

ment ; &amp; though the {corching flames  
made him groan, and mourn, and  
roar, he woull not let go his hold  
till he had reached the. ceiling of a  
lofty theatre,where he hung sometime,  
ftiil fuff-ring a flight of rockets, .and  
and at last descended through another  
florm of burning powder, and never  
let go. till his four feet were fafcly  
‘landed on the floor. Szt

been sober hours, not a few : and I  
kaow not that there has been one, in  
which I have not adored that Provid­  
ence of Almighty God, which alone  
could have carried me fafely through,  
to a fuccefsful issue, this tranfa&amp;ion  
and so many others, equally difficult,  
.and infinitely more dangerous to my  
life, if not to my reputation.

ss, unconquerable  
courage, Roman magnanimity, were  
what he loved to represent, and in  
which he chiefly excelled. But he had  
more versatility of power than his ma-  
jestic sister. King Lear, Macbeth,  
Othello, were performed by him with  
as much success as Brutus, Cato, or  
Coriolanus. The Stranger was one  
of his greatest pieces. The character  
of Haller, worn down by grief, ema-  
ciated by anguish, firm in resolution,  
but writhing under emotion, suited  
his peculiar and transcendant power.  
He pourtrayed to the life the idea of  
Virgil—  
  
“ Nullis ille movetur
