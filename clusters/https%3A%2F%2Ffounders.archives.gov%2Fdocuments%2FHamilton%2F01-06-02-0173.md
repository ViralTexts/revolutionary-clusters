end of the year, which has been accordingly done, subject to the discretion of the Legislature in respect to compensation.  
Thirdly. As to the interest on loans for the Current service: Those which have been already made were the result of necessity. They have been in great part satisfied, and the residue will shortly be reimbursed out of the product of the duties. But the interest, being an extra expenditure, requires an appropriation. And as a farther anticipation of the receipts into the Treasury, to satisfy immediate demands upon it, will be unavoidable, it is necessary that this, also, should be provided for. Obvious considerations dictate the propriety, in future cases, of making previous provision by law for such loans as the public exigencies may call for, defining their extent, and giving special authority to make them.  
Fourthly. As to the sum for completing the payment of interest on the Dutch Loans to the first of July: The rate of Exchange at the present juncture renders it peculiarly convenient to remit from this Country the sum necessary for that purpose. And it is important to the public Credit, that immediate provision

 In those days tobacco passed  
as currency between the colonies.  
In 1789 Secretary Hamilton, the first Secre-  
tary of the Treasury of the United States, after  
the war of the Revolution found the Treasury  
without funds. On his own responsibility he  
negotiated a loan for $191,608.81. It sold at  
par, with 6 per cent interest. The first issue  
on this loan was Sept 13, 1789, and June s,  
190, was named as the date of final redemp­
