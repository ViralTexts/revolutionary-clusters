—Without disguize or palliation, I will inform you candidly of the discontents which, at this moment, prevail universally throughout  
the Army.  
The Complaint of Evils which they suppose almost remediless are, the total want of Money, or the means of existing from One day to another, the heavy debts they have already incurred, the loss of Credit the distress of their Families (ie. such as are  
Maried) at home, &amp; the prospect of Poverty &amp; Misery before them—It is vain Sir, to suppose that Military Men will acquiesce contentedly with bare Rations, when those in the Civil Walk Of life (unacquainted with half the hardships they  
endure) are regularly paid the emoluments of Office—While the human Mind is influenc’d by the same passions, &amp; have the same inclinations to endulge it cannt be. A Military Man has the same turn to sociability as a person in Civil life—he conceives himself equally called  
upon to live up to his Rank—&amp; his pride is hurt when circumstans restrain him—Only conceive then, the Mortification they (even the Genl Officers) must suffer when they cannot invite a French Officer—a visiting Friend—or travelling acquaintance to a better Repast than  
stinkg Whiskey (&amp; not always that) &amp; a bit of Beef without Vegitable, will afford them.  
The Officers also complain of other hardships which they think might &amp; ought to be remedied without delay, viz. the stopping Promotions where there have been vacancy’s open for a long time, the withholding Commissions from those who are justly entitled  
to them &amp; have Warrants or Certificates of their Appointments from the Executive of their States, and particularly the leaving the compensation for their services in a loose equivocal state, without ascertaining their claims upon the public, or making provisions for the  
future payment of them.  
While I premise, that tho’ no one that I have seen or heard of appears opposed to the principle of reducing the Army as circumstances may require; Yet I cannot help fearing the Result of the measure in contemplation, under present circumstances, when I see  
such a number of Men goaded by a thousand stings of reflexion on the past, &amp; of anticipation on the future, about to be turned into the World, soured by penury &amp; what they call the ingratitude of the Public, involved in debts, without one farthing of Money to carry  
them home, after having spent the flower of their days &amp; many of them their patrimonies in establishing the freedom &amp; Independence of their Country, and suffered every thing human Nature is capable of enduring on this side of death—I repeat it, in these irritable  
circumstances, without one thing to sooth their feelings or brighten the gloomy prospects, I cannot avoid apprehending that a train of Evils will follow, of a very serious &amp; distressing Nature—On the other hand could the Officers be placed in as good a situation as when  
they came into service, the contention, I am persuaded, would be not who should continue in the field, but who should retire to private life.  
I wish not to heighten the shades of the picture, so far as the real life would justify me in doing, or I would give Anecdotes of patriotism &amp; distress which have scarcely ever been paralleled, never surpassed in the history of Mankind—but you may rely  
upon it, the patience &amp; long sufferance of this Army are almost exhausted, and that there never was so great a spirit of Discontent as at this instant; While in the Field, I think it may be kept from breaking out into Acts of Outrage, but when we retire into Winter  
Quarters (unless the Storm is previously dissipating) I cannot be at ease, respecting the consequences—It is high time for a Peace.

ment had made the miserable lot of these war.  
worn veterans came one of the severest tests of  
Washington&#x27;s wonderful power over his com  
patriots. What was the actual condition of  
things in the American camp may be premised  
from the emphatic language in which he repre-  
sented to congress the sufferings and the State  
of feeling in the patriot army. A reduction in  
the military forces, to take effect January I  
was contemplated. &quot;While I premise, said  
Washington, &quot;that no one I have seen or  
heard of appears opposed to the principle of  
reducing the army as circumstances may re-  
quire, yet I cannot help fearing the result of  
the measure in contemplation when I see such  
a number of men, goaded by a thousand stings  
of reflection on the past and of anticipation on  
the future, about to be turned into the world,  
soured by penury and what they call the in-  
gratitude of the public, involved in debts,

circumstances, without one thing to soothe  
their feelings or dispel their gloomy pros

a train of evils will follow, of a very se  
rious and disturbing nature.&quot; The great  
hearted commander who felt so deeply and  
pleaded so earnestly for his soldiers dis  
claimed any purpose unduly &quot;to heighten the  
shades of the picture.&quot; He &quot;could give anec­  
dotes of patriotism and distress which have  
scarcely ever been paralleled, never surpassed in  
the history of mankind.&quot; He warned Congress

the continental officers had been reduced by the failure of Congress for a  
very long time to pay them, to the total want of money or the means of  
existing from one day to another, the heavy debts they had already incur-  
red, the loss of credit, the distress of their families at home, and the pros-  
pect of poverty and misery before them.  
  
“Tt is vain, sir,” said he, “ to suppose, that military men will*acquiesce  
contentedly with bare rations, when those in the civil walk of life, unac-  
quainted with half the hardships they endure, are regularly paid the  
emoluments of office. While the human mind is influenced by the same  
passions and inclinations, this cannot be. A military man has the same  
turn for sociability as a person in civil life. He conceives himself equally  
called upon to live up to his rank, and his pride is hurt when circumstances  
restrain him. Only conceive, then, the mortification they must suffer (even  
general officers), when they cannot invite a French officer, a visiting  
friend, or a traveling acquaintance, to a better repast than bad whiskey  
(and not always that) and a bit of beef without vegetables will afford
