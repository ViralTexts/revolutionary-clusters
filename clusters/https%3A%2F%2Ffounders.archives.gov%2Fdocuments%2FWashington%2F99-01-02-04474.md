Prince Town 8th Jany 1781  
  
Your favor of the 3rd with a poscript dated the 4th at 7 OClock a.m. by Major Fishbourn came to hand last evening, the manner in which your Excellency had been pleased to Approve of the Conduct of the Officers in General, and ours in particular, affords a  
Sensation which words can not express.  
It would have afforded us Infinite pleasure, had fortune put it into our power to Inform you that this Alarming affair, was happily terminated.  
We are fully of Opinion that a total Dissolution of the Pennsa Line—or an Order to Disband the Whole, is more Advisable, than to Admit the Unreasonable Claims of these Mutineers, or even to Adopt the terms herewith sent,  
which you will find rejected upon their part, they have been stimulated to this, by the Inclosed Overtures from the Enemy, which came into our hands in the following manner Vizt.  
About 4 OClock yesterday morning we were waked by two Sergts who produced a letter from the Enemy, Inclosed in a small piece of tea lead—they also brought under Guard two Caitiffs, who undertook to deliver it to the Leaders  
of the mall Contents; One of these Culprits, says he is a Sergt in O’Dells new raised Corps and was promised a Considerable reward on bringing back an answer, The Soldiery in General Affect to spurn at the Idea of turning Arnolds (as they  
express it)—we have used every Address to Inflame their minds against Wretches—who would dare to Insult them by Imagining them traitors—for had they thought them Virtuous, they would not have carried those Overtures.  
They hold them in Mort Main &amp; should they yet agree to Govr Reeds Terms—will probably sacrifice them as a peace Offering to their Country, on the Contrary  
they will be spared and Rewarded however their Conduct on the last Occasion, thus far appears favorable, could we prevail upon them to execute these people as Spies—it would effectually shut the Door against further negociation with the  
Enemy—but whilst they continue to hold them alive, it gives us ground to wish ourselves and the Line in the Vicinity of Trent Town, Notwithstanding any assurances they continue to give us of Opposing the Enemy at every expense of blood under our Conduct, should they Land and  
Attempt to Advance in the Jersey. We have the Honor to be with every Sentiment of Esteem Your Excellency’s Most Obedt &amp; very Huml. Serts

N.B. Genl Irvine is just arrived &amp; now with us—the Enemy have not given over all hopes of succeeding with our people—an other letter of the Same tenor with the Copy you have Inclosed came to hand to day—7 OClock P.M.  
The troops have this moment agreed to move for Trent town agreeable to Govr Reeds proposiels—&amp; to bring the two Caitiffs as prisoners.  
  
  
Enclosure  
  
  
Princetown Jany 7th 1781  
  
His Excellency Joseph Reed Esqr. Governor &amp; the honble Brigadier Genl Potter of the Supreme Executive Council of the State of Pennsa having heard the Complaints of the Soldiers; as represented by the Serjeants, informs them that they are fully  
authorised to redress reasonable Grievances &amp; they have the fullest distinctions to make them as easy and happy as Possible for which end they propose.  
1st that no Non Commissioned officer or Soldier shall be detained beyond the time for wch he freely &amp; Voluntarily engaged, but where they appear to have been in any respect compelled to enter or sign, such Instruments to be deemed void &amp; the  
Soldier discharged.  
2d, To settle who are, or are not bound to stay, three Persons to be appointed by the President &amp; Council, who are to examine into the Terms of enlistment, when the original Inlistments, cannot be found, the Soldiers Oaths to be admited to prove the  
time &amp; Terms of Inlistment, and the Soldier to be discharged when his Oath of the Conditions of Inlistment.   
3rdly Wherever any Soldier has inlisted for three Years or during the War, he is to be discharged unless he shall appear afterwards to have reinlisted voluntary &amp; freely—the Gratuity of 100 dollars given by Congress, not to be reckoned as a bounty,  
or any Man to be detained in Consequence of receiving that Gratuity, The Commissioners to be appointed by the President &amp; Council to adjust any difficulties which may arise on this Article also.  
4th The auditors to attend as soon as possible to settle the depreciations with the Soldiers &amp; give them Certificates—Their Arrearages of Pay to be made up as soon as Circumstances will admit.  
5th A Pair of Shoes overhalls &amp; Shirts will be delivered out to each Soldier, in a few days as they are already purchased &amp; ready to be sent forward, whenever the Line shall be settled.  
Those who are discharged to receive the above Articles at Trenton producing the Generals discharge. The Governor hopes that no Soldier of the Pennsyva line will brake his Bargain or go from the Contract made wth the Public &amp; and they may depend upon  
it that the utmost Care will be taken to furnish them with every necessary fitting for a Soldier—The Governor will recommend to the State to take some favourable Notice of those who engaged for the War.   
The Commissioners will attend at Trenton when the Clothing &amp; the Stores will be immediately brought &amp; the Regiments to be settled with in their order.  
A Field officer of each Regiment to attend during the Settlement of his Regiment, pursuant to Genl Waynes Order of the 2d Instant.  
No Man to be brought to any Tryal or Censure for what has happened on or since New-Years day, but all Matter to be buried in Oblivion.  
  
Signed  
Jos. Reed, President  
Jas Potter.  
  
  
  
  
Enclosure  
  
  
  
c.7 January 1781  
  
  
It having been Reported at New York, that the Penna Troops, and others, having been defrauded by Congress of their pay, Cloathing, and Provisions; are assembled for a Redress of their Grievances, and also, that notwithstanding the terms of their  
Inlistments are Expir’d, they have been forcibly detain’d in the service, where they have suffer’d every kind of Misery, and Oppression.  
They are now offer’d to be taken under the Protection of the British Government, to have their Rights Restor’d, after Pardon for all past offences, and that the pay due Them from the Congress faithfully paid them—without any Expectation of Military  
Service, Except it may be Voluntary.  
Upon their Laying down their Arms, And Returning to their Allegiance, for which purpose if they will send Commissionners Amboy; they will then be met by People impower’d to treat with them, and faith shall be pleg’d for their Security.  
It is recommended to them, for their own Safety, to move behind South River, and whenever they Request it, a Body of British Troops shall protect them.  
It is Needless to Point out the Inability as well as want of Inclination in Congress to relieve them, or to tell them the Severity’s that will be us’d by the rebel Leaders toward them, should they think of returning to their former  
Servitude.  
It will be prov’d to the Commissioners they choose to send, that the Authority from whence this comes, is sufficient to Insure the performance of the above Proposals.  
To the Person appointed by the Penna Troops, to Lead them in the present Struggle, for their Libertys and Rights.

Proposals made to the non-commissioned Officers and  
Soldiers of the Pennsylvania line, at Princeton, Jan  
7th, 1781.  
  
His excellency Joseph Reed, Esq. president, and  
  
the honourable brigadier-general Potter, of the council |  
  
of Pennsylvania, having heard the complaints of the  
soldiers, as represented by the sergeants, inform them,  
that they are fully authorized to redress reasonable griev-  
ances, and they have the fullest disposition to make  
them as easy as possible; for which end they propose.  
  
First, That no non-commissioned officer or soldier  
shall be detained beyond the time for which he freely  
and voluntarily engaged: but where they appear to have  
been in any respect compelled to enter or sign, such en-  
listment to be deemed void, and the soldier discharged.  
  
Secondly, To settle who are and whoare not bound to  
stay, three persons to be appointed by the president and  
council,* who are to examine into the terms of enlist-  
ment; where the original enlistments cannot be found,  
the soldier’s oath to be admitted, to prove the time and  
terms of enlistment, and the soldier to be discharged  
upon his oath of the condition of the enlistment.  
  
Thirdly, Wherever any soldier has enlisted for three  
vears or during the war, he is to be discharged, unless  
he shall appear afterwards to have re-ealisted volunta-  
rily and freely. The gratuity of one hundred dollars  
given by Congress, not to be reckoned as a bounty, or  
any men detained in consequence of that gratuity. The  
commissioners to be appointed by the president and  
council, to adjust any difficulties which may arise on  
this article also.  
  
Fourthly, The auditors to attend as soon as possible,  
to settle the depreciation with the soldiers, and give  
them certificates, ‘Their arrearages of pay to be made  
up as soon as circumstances wid admit.  
  
Fifthly, A pair of shoes, overalls and shirt will be de-  
livered to each soldier ina few days, as they are already  
purchased and ready to be sent forward, whenever the

The president hopes, that no soldier of the Pennsyl-  
vania line will break his bargain, or go from the contract  
made with the public, and they may depend upon it,  
that the utmost care will be taken to furnish them with  
every necessary fitting for a soldier.  
  
The president will recommend to the state to take

war.

pired they have been forceably detained in the service  
where they have suffered every kindof misery and op-  
pression—They are now offered to be taken under the  
protection of the British government tohave their rights  
restored, a free pardon for all former offences and that  
pay due to them from Congress faithfully paid to them  
without any expectation of military service except it  
may be voluntary upon laying down their arms and re-

for their security.  
  
It is recommended to them for their own safety to  
move behind South River, and whenever they reqaest  
it, a body of British troops shall protect them. It is  
needless to point out the inability as well as want of in-  
clination in Congress to relieve them or to tell them the  
severities that will be used by the rebel leaders towards  
them. Should they think of returning to their former  
servitude, it will be proved to the commisssioners they  
choose to send that the authority from whence this

above proposals.

Princeton, 8th January, 1781.  
  
Dear General,—Your favour of the 3d, witha  
postscript, dated the 4th, at 7 o’clock A. M. by  
Mr. Fishbourn, came to hand last evening.—  
The manner in which your Excellency has been  
pleased tu approve of the conduct of the officers  
in general, and ours in particular, afforcs a  
sensation which words cannot express.  
  
It would have given us infinite pleasure, had  
fortune pat it into our power to inform you that  
this alarming affair was happily terminated.—  
We are fully of opinion that a total dissolution  
of the Pennsylvania line, or an order to disband  
the whole is more advisable than to admit the  
unreasonable claims of these Mutineers, or even  
to adopt the terms herewith sent. ‘They have  
been stimulated to this by the enclosed overtures  
from the enemy, which came into our hands in  
the following manner, viz:—About 4 o’clock  
yesterday morning, we were waked by two  
serjeants, who produced a letter fromthe enemy,  
enclosed in a small piece of tea lead; they also  
brought,under guard two caitiffs, who undertook  
to deliver it to the leaders of the malcontents.  
One of these culprits says he is a serjeant in  
0&#x27;Dell’s new raised corps, and that he was pro-  
mised a considerable reward on bringing back  
ananswer. Thesoldiers in general affect to  
spurn at the idea of becoming Arnolds, (as  
they express it.) We have used every address  
to inflame their minds against wretches who  
would insult them by imagining them traitors;

To the person appointed by the Pennsylvania  
troops to lead them in their present struggle for  
their liberties and rights:—  
  
It having been reported at New York that the  
Pennsylvania troops and others, having been  
defrauded of their pay, clothing, and provisions,  
are assembled for redress of their grievances;  
and also that notwithstanding the terms of their  
enlistments have expired, they have been forci-  
bly detained in the service, where they have suf  
fered every kind of misery and oppression:—  
  
They are now offered to be taken under the  
protection of the British Government, to have  
their rights restored, and the pay due from Con-  
gress faithfully paid to them ; without any excep-  
  
tation of military service, (except it may be volum-  
  
tary) upon their laying down their arms, and re-  
turning to their allegiance; for which purpose,  
if they will send commissioners to Amboy they  
will be meet with people empowered to treat  
with them, and faith shall be pledged for their  
security. It is recommended to them for their  
security, to move behind South River, and when-  
ever they request it, a body of British troops  
shall protect them.  
  
It is needless to point out the inability and  
want of inclination in Congress to relieve them,  
or tell them the severities that will be exercised  
by the rebel leaders towards them, should they  
think of returning to their former servitude.  
  
It will be proved to the commissioners they  
choose to send, that the authority from whence  
this comes is sufficient to answer the performr  
ance of the above proposals.
