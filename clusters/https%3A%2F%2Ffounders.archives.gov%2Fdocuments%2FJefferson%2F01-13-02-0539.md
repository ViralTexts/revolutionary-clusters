The day before yesterday the New York packet arrived in fifteen days from Halifax. Having recently come in from a rural excursion I knew it not when Mr. Gardner’s letter was writing at the other end of the town early yesterday morning: I mean the introductory note I gave him to you. And even now I cannot furnish you with any accounts which proceed directly from North Carolina itself. But I believe you may rely upon the authenticity of the following extract, namely “State of North Carolina, In Convention Aug. 2. 1788.” “Resolved, That a declaration of rights, asserting and securing from incroachment the great principles of civil and  religious liberty, and the unalienable rights of the people, together with amendments to the most ambiguous and exceptionable parts of the said Constitution of Government, ought to be laid before Congress, or the Convention of the States that shall or may be called for the purpose of amending the said Constitution, for their consideration, previous to the ratification of the Constitution aforesaid on the part of the state of North Carolina.” Yeas 184. Nays 82. By another account from Virginia, dated Aug. 14th, and which I credit as genuine from its intrinsic probability, it appears that on the opening of the Convention, a motion was made for the question to be put immediately upon the supposition that every member had made up his mind on the subject and therefore an immediate determination wou’d save both expence and debate. This measure it is thought might have been carried, had not one of the principal supporters of the new government in a most animated and excellent speech, proved the extreme indecorum and impropriety of such precepitance in a business so serious and important: whereupon the motion was withdrawn and the Constitution being discussed clause by clause in a Committee of the whole Convention the r

Previous to their dissolution, two recommendations to the state legislature pass’d—the one to make the most speedy and effectual provision for the redemption of the paper money now in circulation, the other to lay an impost for the use of Congress on goods imported into North Carolina, similar to that which shall be laid by the new Congress, on goods imported into the adopting states.

constitution as it was only author­  
ized to amend the confederation.  
All parties admitted the desirability  
of amendments. The opponents of  
adoption urged that staying out  
would compel amendments. Those  
favoring adoption said by adopting  
North Carolina, would make a ma­  
jority of States demanding amend­  
ments, and thus certainly secure  
them. These were some of the  
principal objections to adoption, or  
the ambiguity of the constitution  
on thesn poincs.  
July 30th Mr. Jones moved the  
previous question. Carried,ayes,183;

Mr. Jones offered the following  
resolution :  
Resolved, &quot;That a declaration of  
rights asserting and securing from  
encroachment the great principles  
of civil and religious liberty and  
the unalienable rights of the people
