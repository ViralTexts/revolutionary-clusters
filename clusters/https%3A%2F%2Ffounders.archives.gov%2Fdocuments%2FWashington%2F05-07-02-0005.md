To the great Councillor of the thirteen fires.  
The Speech of the Corn-planter, Half-town and the Great-Tree chiefs of the Senecca Nation.  
Father  
The voice of the Senecca Nation speaks to you the great Councillor, in whose heart, the wise men of the thirteen fires, have placed their wisdom. It may be very small in your ears, &amp; we therefore entreat you to hearken with attention. For we are about to speak of things which are to us very great. When your army entered the Country of the Six Nations, we called you the Town-destroyer and to this day, when that name is heard, our women look behind them and turn pale, and our children cling close to the neck of their mothers. Our Councillors and warriors are men, and can not be afraid; but their hearts are grieved with the fears of our women &amp; children, and desire, that it may be buried so deep, as to be heard no more. When you gave us peace we called you father, because you promised to secure us in the possession of our Land. Do this and so long as the Land shall remain that beloved name shall live in the heart of every Senecca.  
Father,  
We mean to open our hearts before you, and we earnestly desire, that you will let us clearly understand, what you resolve to do. When our chiefs returned from the treaty of fort Stanwix, and laid before our Council what had been done there our Nation was surprized to hear, how great a Country you had compelled them to give up, to you, without paying us any thing for it. Every one said your hearts were yet swelled with resentment against us for what had happened during the war: but that one day you would reconsider it with more kindness. We asked each other what we had done to deserve such severe chastisement.  
Father,  
When you kindled your thirteen fires seperately, the wise men  
  
that assembled at them told us you were all brothers, the children of one great Father who regarded also the red people as his children. They called us brothers and invited us to his protection. They told us he resided beyond the great waters where the sun first rises: That he was a King whose power no people could resist, and that his goodness was bright as that sun. What they said went to the bottom of our hearts: We accepted the invitation and promised to obey him. What the Senecca Nation promise they faithfully perform; and when you refused obedience to that King he ordered us to assist his beloved men in making you sober. In obeying him we did no more than you yourselves had lead us to promise. The men who claimed this promise said that you were children and had no Guns that when they had shaken you, you would submit. We hearkened to them and were deceived until your army approached our towns. We were deceived but your people in teaching us to confide in that King, had helped to deceve us and wnow appeale to your hearts. Is the blame all ours?  
Father,  
When we saw we were deceived and heard the invitation which you gave us to draw near to the fire you had kindled and talk with you concerning peace we made haste towards it. You then told us we were in your hand &amp; that by closing it you could crush us to nothing; and you demanded of us a great Country as the price of that peace you had offered us; as if our want of strength had destroyed our rights. Our Chiefs had felt your power &amp; were unable to contend against you and they therefore gave up that Country. What they agreed to has bound our nation. But your anger against us must by this time be cooled, and altho’ our Strength has not encreased nor your power become less we ask you to consider calmly were the terms dictated to us reasonable and just?  
Father,  
Your commissioners when they drew the line which seperated the land then given up to you, from that which you agreed should remain to be ours did, most solemly promise, that we should be secured in the peaceable possession of the lands which we inhabited, East, &amp; North, of that line. Does this promise bind you?  
Hear now we entreat you, what has since happened, concerning that Land. On the day on which we finished the treaty at  
  
fort Stanwix, commissioners from Pensylvania, told our chiefs, that they had come there to purchase from us, all the Lands belonging to us within the lines of their State, and they told us that their line would strike the river Susquehanna below Tioga branch. They then left us to consider the bargain ’till the next day. On the next day we let them know, that we were unwilling to sell all the Lands within their State, and proposed to let them have a part of it which we pointed to them in their map.  
They told us they must have the whole: That it was already ceded to them by the great King at the time of making peace with you, and was their own. But they said they would not take advantage of that, and were willing to pay us for it after the manner of their Ancestors. Our chiefs were unable to contend at that time, &amp; therefore they sold the Lands up to the line which was then shewn to them as the line of that State. What the Commissioners had said about the land having been ceded to them at the peace our Chiefs considered only as intended to lessen the price, &amp; they passed it by with very little notice; but since that time we have heard so much of the right to our lands which the King gave when you made peace with him that it is our earnest desire you will tell us what they mean.  
Father,  
Our nation empowered John Livingston to let out a part of our lands on rent. He told us he was sent by Congress to do this for us and we fear he has deceived us on the writing he obtained from us: For since the time of our giving that power, a man of the name of Phelps has come among us, and claimed our whole Country northward of the line of Pensylvania under purchase from that Livingston to whom he said he had paid twenty thousand dollars for it. He said also he had bought likewise from the Council of the thirteen fires, and paid them twenty thousand dollars more for the same. And he said also that it did not belong to us for that the great King had ceded the whole of it when you made peace with him. Thus he claimed the whole country North of Pensylvania and west of the Lands belonging to the Cayugas. He demanded it: He insisted on his demand and declared that he would have it all. It was impossible for us to grant him this and we immediately refused. After some days he proposed to run a line at a small distance Eastward of our western boundary which we also refused to agree to. He then threatened us with immediate war if we did not comply. Upon this threat our Chiefs  
  
held a Council and they agreed that no event of war could be worse than being driven with our wives &amp; children from the only Country which we had any right to. and therefore weak as our nation was, they determined to take the chance of war rather than submit to such unjust demands, which seemed to have no bounds. Street the great trader at Niagara was then with us having come at the request of Phelps, and as he always professed to be our great friend we consulted him on this subject; He also told us, that our Lands had been ceded by the King and that we must give them up.  
Astonished at what we heard from every quarter, with hearts akeing with compassion for our women and children, we were thus compelled to give up all our Country North of the line of Pensylvania, and East of the Chenesco river up to the forks, and East of a South line drawn from that fork to the Pensylvania line. For this Land Phelps agreed to pay us Ten thousand dollars in hand and one thousand dollars a year for ever. He paid us two thousand &amp; five hundred dollars in hand part of the Ten thousand, and he sent for us last Spring to come and receive our money; but instead of paying us the remainder of the Ten Thousand dollars, and the one thousand dollars due for the first year, he offered us no more than five hundred dollars, and insisted he had agreed with us for that sum only to be paid yearly. We debated with him six days during all which time he persisted in refusing to pay us our just demand; and he ins[is]ted that we should receive the five hundred dollars, and Street from Niagara, also insisted on our receiving the money as it was offered to us. The last reason he assigned for continuing to refuse paying us was, that the King had ceded the lands to the thirteen fires and that he had bought them from you and paid you for them.  
We could bear this confusion no longer, &amp; determined to press thro’ every difficulty, and lift up our voice that you might hear us, and to claim that security in the possession of our lands which your commissioners so solemly promised us, and we now entreat you to enquire into our complaints and redress our wrongs.  
Father.  
Our writings were lodged in the hands of Street of Niagara, as we supposed him to be our friend; but when we saw Phelps consulting with Street, on every occasion, we doubted of his honesty towards us, and we have since heard, that he was to  
  
receive for his endeavors to deceive us, a peice of land ten miles in width west of the Chenesco river, and near forty miles in length extending to lake Ontario; and the lines of this tract have been run accordingly tho no part of it is within the bounds which limit his purchase. No doubt he meant to deceive us.  
Father,  
You have said we were in your hand, and that by closing it, you could crush us to nothing. are you determined to crush us? If you are, tell us so that those of our nation who have become your children &amp; are determined to die so, may know what to do: In this case one chief has said, he would ask you to put him out of pain: Another, who will not think of dying by the hand of his father, has said he will retire to the Chataughque, eat of the faral root, and sleep with his fathers in peace.  
Before you determine on a measure so unjust, look up to the God who made us, as well as you, we hope he will not permit you to destroy the whole of our nation.  
Father,  
Hear our case, many nations inhabited this Country, but they had no wisdom, and therefore they warred, together. The six Nations were powerful &amp; compelled them to peace: The Lands for a great extent were given up to them, but the nations which were not destroyed, all continued on those Lands and claimed the protecti[on] of the six Nations, as the brothers of their fathers. They were men and when at peace had a right to live on the Earth. The French came among us and built Niagara. They became our fathers, and took care of us. Sr William Johnson came and took that Fort from the French; he became our father and promised to take care of us and did so till you were too strong for his King. To him we gave four miles round Niagara, as a place of Trade. We have already said how we came to join against you. We saw that we were wrong: we wished for peace. You demanded a great Country to be given up to you. It was surrendered to you as the price of peace and we ought to have peace, and possession, of the little Land which you then left us.  
Father,  
When that great Country was given up, there were but few Chiefs present, and they were compelled to give it up. And it is not the Six nations only, that reproach those Chiefs, with having given up that Country; the Chipaways and all the nations who lived on those lands westward, call to us &amp; ask us brothers of  
  
our fathers where is the place which you have reserved for us to lie down on.  
Father,  
You have compelled us to do that which has made us ashamed. We have nothing to answer to the children of the brothers of our fathers. When last Spring they called on us to go to war to secure them a bed to lie upon, The Seneccas entreated them to be quiet until we had spoken to you: but on our way down we heard, your army had gone to the Country which those nations inhabit: and if they meet together the best blood on both sides will stain the ground.  
Father,  
We will not conceal from you, that the great God, and not m⟨a⟩n has preserved the Corn planter from his own nation: for they ask continually, where is the Land which our children and their children after them are to lie down on?  
You told us say they, that the line drawn from Pensylvania, to lake Ontario, would mark it for ever on the East, and the line running from Beaver Creek, to Pensylvania, would mark it on the west; and we see that it is not so. For first one, and then another, come and take it away, by order of that people, who promised to secure it to us. He is silent for he has nothing to answer.  
When the Sun goes down, he opens his heart before God, and earlier than that Sun appears again upon the Hills, he gives thanks for his protection during the night, for he feels, that among men become desperate by their danger, it is God only that can preserve him. He loves peace, and all that he had in store he has given to those who have been robbed by your people, lest they should plunder the innocent to repay themselves: the whole season which others employed in providing for their families, he has spent in his endeavors to preserve peace. And at this moment his wife and children are lying on the Ground in want of food. His heart is in pain for them; but he percieves that the great God will try his firmness in doing what is right.  
Father,  
The Game which the great Spirit sent into our Country for us to eat, is going from among us: We thought he intended we should till the ground as the white people do, and we talked to one another about it. But before we speak to you of this, we  
  
must know from you, whether you mean to leave us, and our children, any land to till. Speak plainly to us concerning this great business. All the Lands we have been speaking of belonged to the Six Nations: no part of it ever belonged to the King of England, and he could not give it to you. The Land we live on our Fathers received from God, and they transmitted it to us, for our Children and we cannot part with it.  
Father,  
We told you we would open our hearts to you. Hear us once more.  
At fort Stanwix we agreed to deliver up those of our people, who should do you any wrong, that you might try them, and punish them according to your Law. We delivered up two men, accordingly. But instead of trying them according to your Law, the lowest of your people took them from your magistrate, and put them immediately to death. It is just to punish murder with death, but the Seneccas will not deliver up their people to men, who disregard the treaties of their own nation.  
Father,  
Innocent men of our nation are killed one after another, and of our best families: But none of your people who have committed the murders have been punished. We recollect that you did not promise to punish those who killed our people, and we now ask, Was it intended that your people should kill the Seneccas, and not only remain unpunished by you: but be protected by you against the next of kin?  
Father,  
These are to us very great things. We know that you are strong and we have heard that you are wise; and we wait to hear your answer to what we have said that we may know that you are just.  
Signed at Philadelphia the first day

TO THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN FIRES.  
  
The fpeech of Cornplant, Half Fown, and Big Tree, chiefs and counfel-  
lors of the Seneca nation.  
Father,  
HE voice of the Seneca nation fpeaks to you--the great counfellor, in  
whofe heart the wile mea of all the thirteen fires have placed their wif.  
dom ; it may be very fmall in your ears, and we therefore mtreat you to  
hearken with attention, for we are about to fpeak of things which are, to us,  
very great.  
* When your army entered the country of the fix nations, we called you the  
town deftroyer ; and to this day, when your name is heard, our women ook  
behind them and turn pale, and our children cling clofe to the necks of their  
mothers. Our counfeilors and warriors are men, end cannot be afraid: but  
their hearts are grieved with the fears of our women and children, and defire  
that it may be buried fo deep, as to be heard no mere.  
  
When you gave us peace, we called you father; becaufe you promifed to  
fecure us in the poffeffion of our lands. Do this, and fo long as the land thail  
‘Femain, that beloved name will be in the heart of every Seneca,  
  
; Father,  
  
We mean to open our hearts before you, and we earneftly defire that you  
will let us clearly underftand what you refoive to do.  
  
When our chiefs returned from the treaty at fort Stanwix, and laid before  
  
* our council what had been done there, our nation was furprifed to hear how  
great a country you had compelied them to give up to you, without your pay-  
ing to us any thing for it. Every one faid that your heart were yet {welled  
with refentment againft us, for what had happened during the war; but that  
one day you would conmfider it with more kindnefs, Weafked each other, what  
bave we done to deferve fuch fevere chaftifement? _  
  
: Fatber,  
  
When you kindled your thirteen fires feparately, the wife men affembfed at  
them told us, that you were all brothers—the ehildren of one great father—-  
whio regarded the red people as his children.— They called us brothers, andin-  
vited us to his protection. They told us that he refided beyond the great wa-  
ter, where the fun firlt rifes—that he was a king whofe power no people could  
refift, and that his goodnefs was bright as the fun——what they faid, went to  
‘our hearts, We accepted the invitation, and promifed to obey him. What the  
Seneca nation promies, they faithtully perform : and when you refufed obedience  
to that king, he commanded us to affitt his beloved men in making you fober.—In  
ebeying him, we did no more than yourfelves had ted us to promife, The men  
  
4 ‘who claimed this promife, told us that you were children and had no guns—that  
” when they had fhaken you, you would fubmit. We hearkened untothem, and were  
deceived until your army approached our towns. We were deceived ; but your  
people teaching us to confiie in that king, had helped to deceive us; and we  
now appeal to your heart—Is all the blame ours? *  
  
Father,  
  
When we faw that we had been deceived, and heard the invitation which you  
gave us to draw near to the fire, which you had kindled, and talk with you con-  
cerning peace, we made halite toward it. Vou then told us you could cruth us te  
nothing, and you demanded from as a great country, as the price of that peace  
which you had Offered to us; as if our want of firength had deftroyed our  
rights, Our chiefs had felt your power, and were unable to contend againft you,

and they therefore gave up that country. What they agreed to, has bound our  
nation; but your anger againft us muft, by this time, be cooled, and although  
our ftrength has not inqweafed, nor your power become leis, we afk you to  
confider ealmly——were the terms dictated to us by your commiffioners reafona-  
bie and juft?  
  
Father, ,  
  
Your commiffioners, when they drew the line which feparated the land then  
given up to you, from that which you agreed fhould remain to be ovrs, did moft  
folemnly promi(e, that we fhould be fecured in the peaceabie poffifion of the  
land which we inlrabited eaft and north of that line. Does th&#x27;s promue bind you ?  
  
Hear now, we intreat you, wiiat has fince happened, concerning that land,  
On the day we finithed the treaty at fort Stanwix, commiffioners from Penn-  
fylvania told our chiefs, that they had come there to purchafe from us, all the  
lands belonging to us within the lines of their ftate ; and they told us chat their  
line would ttrike the riveg Sufquehanna below Tioga branch. They then lert us  
to confer of the bargain until next day. The next day we let them know  
that we were unwilling to fell all the land within their ftate, and propofec to Jet  
them have a part of it, which we pointed out to them in their map, They told  
us that they mult have the whole ; that it was already ceded to them by the  
ope king, at the time of making peace with you, and was then their own ; but  
  
y faid that they would not take advantage of that, and were willing to pay  
us for it, after the manner of their ancettors. Our chiefs were unable to contend  
at that time; and therefore they fold the lands up to the line, which was then  
fhown them, as the line of that ftate.—What the commiffioners had faid about  
the land having been ceded to them at the peace, they coniidered as intended  
only to leffen the price, and they paffed it by with very little notice ; but fince  
thac time, we have heard fo much from others about the right to our lands,  
which the king gave when you made peace with him, that it is our earneit de-  
fire that you will tell us what it means.  
  
Our nation empowered J. L. to let out a part of our lands. He told us that .  
he was fent by congrefs to do this for us, and we fear he has deceived us in  
the writing he obtained from us: for fince the time of our giving that  
power, a man named P » has come and claimed our whole country north-  
ward of the line of Pennfylvania under a purchafe from that L. to whom he  
faid he had paid twenty thoufand dollars for it—he alfo faid, that he had bon ctt  
it from the council of the thirteen fires, and paid them twenty thoufand more  
for the fame—and he alfo faid that it did not belong to us, for that the great  
king had ceded the whole of it when you made peace with him. Thus he claim-  
ed the whole country north of Pennfylvania, and weft of the lands belong-  
ing to the Cayugas. He demanded it—he infifted on his demand, and declared  
to us that he would have it all. It was impoffible for us to grant him this, and  
we immediately refuled it. After fome days, he propofed to run a line a {mall  
diftance ealtward of our weftern boundary, which we alfo refufed to agree to,  
He then threatened us with immediate war, if we did not comply.  
  
Upon this threat, our chiefs held a council: and they agreed, that no event  
of war could be worfe than to be driven, with our wives and children, from the  
only country which we had any right to: and therefore, weak as our nation was,  
they determined to take the chance of war rather than fubmit to fuch unjutt  
demands, which feemed to have no bounds. Mr. Street, the great trader at Ni-  
agara, was then with us, having come at the requeft of P ; and as he had  
always profefled to be our great friend; we confulted him on this fubje&amp;. He  
alfo told us, that our lands had been ceded by the king, and that we muf  
  
ive them up. Aftonifhed at what we heard from every quarter, with

compelled te give up all our country north of the line of Pennfylvania, and  
eaft of the Cheneice river up to the great forks, and eait of 4 fouth tine drawn  
up fron that fork to the Ine of Peanfylvania. For ‘this land P. agreed to:  
psy us ten thoufand dollars in hand, and one thoufand doilars a year forever,  
He paid us two thoufand five hundred dollars; and he fent for us to come lat  
{pring and receive our morfty. But inttead of paying us the remainder of the  
ten thoulfand dollars, and the one thoufand dollars due for the firft year, he  
offered only five hundred dollars, and infitted that he had agreed with us for that  
fun to be paid yearly.  
  
We debaicd with him for fix days, during all which time he perfifted in re.  
fuling to pay us our jut demand: and he infilted, that we thouid receive the  
five hundred Jellars; and Street from Niagara alfo infifted on our receiving the  
money, as it was offered to us. The iait reafon which be affigned for continue  
ing tovefule paying us was—that the king had ceded the lands to the thirteen  
fires, and that he had bought them from you, and paid you for then.  
  
Father, - &#x27;  
  
We could bear this confufion no longer, and determined to prefs threugh  
every cifficulty, and lft upour voice, fo that you might hear us, and to  
ciaim thot fecurity in the poffeffion of our lands, which your commiffioners fo  
folemnly pro.nifed us ; and wemow intreat you to enquire into our complaintg,  
and toredre‘s our wrongs.  
  
Farther,  
  
Our wistings were lodged in the hands of S. of Niagara, as we fuppofed  
him to be our friend ; but when we faw P. confulting S. enevery occafion,  
we doubted of his honefty towards-us: andave have fince heard, that he was  
to receive for his endcavours to deceive us, a pieee of land ten miles in width,  
welt o. tne Cheaelee river, and near forty miles in length, extending to lake On-  
tario: and the lines of this tra&amp; have been rum accordingly, although no pait of  
it is within the bounds which limit his purchase.  
  
Father,  
  
You have faid that we were in your land, and that by elofing it, you could  
erufl: us to nothing. Are you then determined to cruth us? If youare, tell us  
{ , that thofe of our nation, who have become your chiidren, and have detere  
mined to die fo, may know whatto do. In tims cafe, one chief has faid, he  
would ak you to put him out of his pain, Another, who will not think of dy-  
ing by the hand of his futher or of his brother, has faid he will retire to the  
Chataughaque, eatof the fatal root, and fleep with his fathers in peace.  
  
Before you determine on a meafure fo unjuft, look up to God who made us  
as well as you. We hope he will not permit you, te deftroy the whole of our  
pation.  
  
Father,  
  
Hear our cafe. Many nations inhtbited this country; but they had no wif.  
dom ; therefore they warred together—the fix nations were powerful, and com-  
peiled them to peace. The land, fora great extent, was given up to them, but  
the nations waig) were not deftroye.t, all continued on thofe lands, and claimed  
the protection of the fix nations, as brothers of theic fathers. They were men,  
and, when at peace, had a right to live upon the earth.

peace: and we ought to have peace and poflzfhon of the little land which you  
then left us.  
Father,  
  
When that great country was given up to you, there were but few chie’s  
prefent; and they were compelled to give it up. And it is not the fix nations  
enly that repreach thofe chiefs with having given up that couniry. The Chipae  
ways, and all the nations who Jived on thefe lands weftwara, call tous, and  
atk us, brothers of our fathers, where is the piace which you have referved ior  
us 10 lie down upon?  
  
Father,  
  
You have compelled us to do that which makes us afhamed ; we have nothing  
to anfwer to the children of the brothers of our fathers. Waen lait ipring th-y  
éalled upon us to go to war, to fecdre them a bed to tie down upon; the Sene-  
eas intreated them to be quiet, until we had {poken to you; but on our way  
down, we heard that your army had gone towards the country which thoie nae  
tions inhabied, and it they meet togeiuer, the belt blood on voth fides wil dail  
to the ground. a.  
  
Father,  
  
We will not conceal from you, that the great God, and not men, has pre-  
ferved the Corn Plant from the hands of his own nation, For they afk conti-  
Dually, where is the land which our children, and their children after them are  
to lie down vpon? You told us, fay they, that the line drawn from Penolyl-  
Vania to lake Onta:io, would mark it forever on the eaft, and the line running  
from Beaver creek to Pennfylvania, would mak it on the weit; and we tee  
that it is not fo; for firft one and then another comeand take it away, by order  
ef that people which you tell us promised to iccure it to us. He is filent; for  
he has nothing to an{wer.  
  
When the tun goes down, he opens his heart before God, and earlier than  
the un appears again upon the hills, he gives thanks for his protection during  
the night; for he teels, that among men become delperate by the injuries they  
fuitain, it is God only that can preierve him. He loves peace: and ail he had  
in ttore he has given to thofe who hive been robbed by your people, ie they  
fhould piunder the innocent to repay themieives. The whele teafon, which  
others have employed in providing tor their famuics, he has fpent in endea-  
vours to preferve peace: and this moment his wife and children are lying on  
the ground, and in want of food; his heartis in pain for them; but he per-  
ceives that the Great Spirit wall try his firmnefs in doing what is right.  
  
Father,  
  
The game, which the Great Spirit fent into our country, for us to eat, is  
going trom among us. We thought he intended we thouid wil the ground wih  
the plough, as the white people.do; and we talked to one anoiner about it.  
But before we ipeak to you concerning this, we mult know trom you, whether  
you mern to leave us and our children amy land to wll, Speak plainly tous,  
concerning this great bulinels,  
  
Aii the land we have been fpecrking of, belonged to the fix nations. -No

duced among them the arts of civil life, and  
their representations to the general govern-  
ment have commanded attention and will pro-  
bably produce the most salutary measures. }  
  
Father—The voice of the Seneca Na-  
tions speaks to you, the great counsellor,  
in whose heart the wise men of all the  
Thirteen Fires have placed their wis-  
dom; it may be very small in your ears,  
and we therefore entreat you to hearken  
with attention, for we are about to speak  
of things which are to us very great.  
  
When your army entered the country  
of the Six Nations, we called you the  
town-destroyer; and to this day, when  
your name is heard, our women look be-  
hind them and turn pale, and our chil-  
dren cling close to the necks of their  
mothers. Our counsellors and warriors  
are men, and cannot be afraid, but their  
hearts are grieved with the fears of our  
women and children, and desire that it  
may be buried so deep as to be heard no  
more.  
  
‘ather—yYou have said that we were  
in your hand, and that by closing it, you  
could crush us to nothing. Are you then  
determined to crush us? If you are, tell  
us so, that those of our nation who have  
become your children, and have deter-  
mined to die so, may know what to do.  
In this case one chief has said, he would  
ask you to put him out of his pain. Ano-  
ther, who will not think of dying by the  
hand of his father, or of his brother, has  
said he will retire to the Chataughque,  
eat of the. fatal root, and sleep with his  
fathers in peace.

Father—You have compelled us to  
do that which makes us ashamed, we  
have nothing to answer to the children  
of the brothers of our fathers. When  
last spring they called upon us to go to  
war, to secure them a bed to lie down  
upon, the Senecas intreated them to be  
quiet, until we had spoken to yous but  
on our way down, we heard that your  
army had gone towards the countr  
which those nations inhabited; and if  
they meet together, the best blood on  
both sides will stain the ground.  
  
Father—We will not conceal from  
  
ou, that the great God, and not men,  
‘be reserved the Corn Plant from the  
hands of his own nation. For they ask  
continually, where is the land on which  
our children, and their children after  
them, are to lie down upon? You told  
us, say they, that the line drawn from  
Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario, would  
mark it for ever on the east, and the line  
running from Beaver Creek to Pennsyl-  
vania would mark it on the west, and we  
see that it is not so; for first one, and  
then another, come and take it away by  
order of that people which you tell us  
promised to secure it to us: he is silent,  
for he has nothing to answer. When the  
sun goes down, ke opens his heart before  
God, and earlier than the sun appears  
again upon the hills, he gives thanks for  
his protection during the night; for he  
feels, that among men, become desperate  
by the injuries they sustain, it is God  
only that can preserve him. He loves  
peace, and all he had in store he has  
given to those who have been robbed by  
your people, lest they should plunder  
the innocent to repay themselves. T&#x27;he  
whole season, which others have em-  
loyed in proyiding for their families,  
e has spent in endeavours to preserve  
peace, and this moment his wife and  
children are lying on the ground, and in  
want of food: his heart.is in pain for  
them, but he perceives that the Great  
Spirit will try his firmness in doing what  
3 right.  
  
Father—The game which the Great  
Spirit sent into our country for us to eat,  
is going from among us. We thought  
he intended we should till the ground  
  
—— ——  
  
  
  
  
  
with the plough, as the white people do,  
and we talked to one another about it.  
But before we speak to you concerning  
this, we must know from you whether  
you mean to leave us and our children  
any land to till. Speak plainly to us  
concerning this great business.  
  
All the land we have been speaking  
of belonged to the Six Nations; no part  
of it ever belonged to the king of Eng-  
land, and he could not give it up to you.  
The land we live on our fathers received  
from God, and they transmitted it to us  
for our children, and we cannot part  
with it.

it may be very smali in your

youto hearken with attention, for  
we are about to speak of things  
which are tous very great. -  
  
When your army entered the

When you gave us peace we

do.  
  
When our chiefs returned from  
the treaty at Kort Stanwix, and  
laid before our couacil what had  
been done there, oar nation was  
surprised to hear how great a  
country you had compelled them  
9 Sive up to you, without your  
paying ty us any thing for it.  
Every one said, that your hearts  
were vet swelled with resentment  
against us for what had happen-  
ed during the war, but one day  
that you would consider it with  
more kindness. We ask each  
other, what have we done to e-  
serve such severe chastisement?  
  
Faruarr,  
  
When you kindled your Thir-

men assembled at tiem told us,  
that vou were all brothers; the  
children ofone great father, who  
regarded the red peopte as his  
children. They called us  bro-  
thers, and invited us to his pro-  
tection. They told us that he re-  
sided beyond the great water  
where the sun first rises; and that  
his goodness was as bright as the

ing us to coniide in that king,  
had helped to deceive us, and  
we now apnealto your heart, Is  
all the blame ours?  
  
FATHER,  
  
When we saw that we had  
been deceived, and heard the in-  
Vitation which you gave us to  
draw near to the fire which you  
had kindled and talk with you  
concerning peace, we made haste  
towards it. You then told us  
you could crush us to nothing,  
and you demanded from us a  
great country, as the price of that  
peace which you had aiforded to  
uss as ifour want of strength had  
destroyed our rights. Our chiefs  
had felt your power and were  
unable to contend against you,  
and they therefore gave up that  
country. What they agreed to  
has boend our nation; but your  
anger against us must by this  
time be cooled, and although our  
strength has net increased, vor  
your power become less, we ask  
you to consider calmly. Were  
the terms dictated to us by your  
commissioners reasonable &amp; just?  
  
FATHER,  
  
Your commissioners, when  
they drew the line which sepe-  
rated the land thea given up to  
you, from that which you agreed  
should remain to be ours, did  
most solemnly promise, that we  
should be secured in the peacea-  
bie possession of the land which  
we inhabited, east and north of  
that Hine. Does this promise  
bind you? :  
  
Hear now, we extreat you,

what has since happened concer.  
ning that land. On the day we  
finished the treaty at Fort Stan-  
wix, commissioners from Penn.  
sylvania told our chiefs, that  
they had come there to purchase  
from lines of their state; and the  
told us that all the lands helong-  
ing tous within the line, would  
strike the river Susqehannah be-  
low Tioga branch. They then  
left us to cousicer of the bargain  
until next day. The next day  
we let them know, that we were  
unwiliing to sell all the land  
Within their state, and proposed  
to let them have part of it, which  
we poinied outto them in their  
map. ‘Phey told us that they  
must have the whole, that it was  
already ceded to them by the  
great king, at the time of making  
peace Wilh you, and was then  
their own; but they said that they  
would not take advantageof that,  
and were willing to pay us for  
it, after the manner of their an-  
cestors. Our chiefs were unable  
to contend at that time, and there-  
fore they sold the lands up to the  
line, which was then shewn them  
as the line of that state. What  
the commissioners had said about  
the land having been ceded to  
them at the peace, they consider-  
ed only to lessen the price, and  
they passed it by with very little  
notice, but since that time we  
have heard so much from others  
about the rightef our lands which  
the king gave when you made  
peace with him, that it is our  
earnest desire that you will tell  
us What it means.  
  
Our nation empowered J. L.  
to let out a part of our lands; he

Father, we will not conceal from

continually, where is the land which  
our children and their children are to&#x27;

You told us, say they, that a line  
drawn from Pennsylvania&#x27;to Lake On­

nother comes and takes it away by or­

Cornplant is silent, for he has nothing  
to answer.  
  
When the gun goes down, Cornplant  
opens his heart before the Great Spirit;  
and earlier than the sun appears again  
upon the hills, he gives thanks for hiy  
protection during the night; for he  
feels that among men, become des­

you are, tell us so, that those of our nation who have  
become your children, and have determined to die  
|so, may know what to de. In this case, one chief  
has said, he would ask you to put him out of his  
pain. Another, who will not think of dying by the  
hand of his father, or his brother, has said he will  
retire to the Chataughque, eat of the fatal root, and  
she ep with his fathers in peace,  
| Before you determine a measure so unjust, look  
up to God, who made us as well as you; we hope  
he will not permit you to destroy the whole of our  
nation.  
  
“ Father —Hear our case: Many nations inhabited  
\this country, but they had no wisdom, therefore they  
  
warred together; the Six Nations were powerful,  
  
and compelled them to peace. The land, for a great  
extent, was given up to them, but the nations which  
were not destroyed all ntinued on those lands;  
and claimed the protection of the Six Nations, as  
  
brothers of their fathers. They were men, and  
when at peace had a right to live upon the earth.  
“ The French came among us, and built Niagara ;  
jthey became our fathers, and took care of us. Sir  
William Johnson came, and took that fort from the  
| French ; he became our father, and promised to take  
}care of us, and he did so until you were too strong  
for his king. To him we gave four miles around  
Niagara as a place of trade. We have already said  
| how we came to join against you; we saw that we  
| were wrong, we wished for peace, you demanded a  
| great country to be given up to you, it was sur-  
| rendered to you as the price of peace, nc we ought  
| to have peace and possession of the little land which  
you then left us.  
  
|  Father,—When that great country was given up  
  
to you there were but few chiefs present, and they  
  
were compelled to give it up. And it is not the Six  
  
| Nations only that reproach those chiefs with having  
given up that country. The Chipaways, and all the  
|nations who lived on these lands westward, call to  
} us, and ask us, * Brothers of our fathers, where is the  
| place which you have reserved for us to lie down  
upon :  
  
* Father —You have compelled us to do that which  
makes us ashamed. We have nothing to answer to  
ithe children of the | rothers of our fathe rs. When,  
\last spring, they called upon us to go to war to s«  
cure them a bed to lie down upon, the  
treated them to be quiet until we  
  
Senecas en-  
had spoken to  
lyou; but on our w ay down, we heard that your  
army had gone towards the country which, those na-  
tions inhabited; and if they meet ‘tog  
  
blood on both sides wiil stain the gL  
  
* Father —We will not conceal from you that the  
great God, and not men, has preserved the Corn  
jo&quot; 7 a 7 _ &#x27;  
Plant from the hands of his own nation. For they  
}ask continually,‘ Where is the land on which our

on the west, and we see that it is not se: for first  
  
me, and then another, come and take it away by or-  
der of that people which you tell us promised to se-  
cure it to us.’ He is silent, for he  
janswer. When the sun goes down, he opens his  
heart before God; and earlier than the sun appears  
| again upon the hills, he gives thanks for his protec-  
tion during the night; for he feels that among men,  
become desperate by the injuries they sustain, itis  
| God only that can preserve him. He loves peace,  
&#x27;and all he had in store he has given to those who

mory of Mr. Phelps—which has been done. }  
  
The speech of the Cornplanter, Half Town and the Great Tree  
chiefs, and counsellors of the Seneca nation to the great coun-  
sellor of the thirteen fires:  
  
Fatuer: The voice of the Sencea nation speaks to you, the  
great counsellor, in whose heart the wise men of all the thir-  
teen fires have placed their wisdom. It may be very «mali in  
your ears, and we therefore entreat you to hearken with atten-  
tion, for we are about to speak of things which to us are very  
great. When your army entered the country of the Six Na-  
tions, we called you the town destroyer; and to this day, when  
that name is heard, our women look bebind them and torn  
pale, and our children cling ciose to the necks of their mothers.  
Our counsellors and warriors are men, and cannot be afraid;  
  
— — — — ——  
  
  
  
  
  
but their hearts are grieved with the fears of our women and  
children, and desire it may be buried so deep as to be beard no  
more.  
  
When you gave us peace, we called you father, because you  
promised to secure us in the possession of our lands. Do this,  
and, so long as the lauds shall remain, that beloved name will  
live in the heart of every Seneca.  
  
Father: We mean w open our hearts before you, and we  
earnestly desire that you will let us clearly understand what  
you resolve todo. When our chiefs returved from the treaty  
at Fort Stanwix, and laid before our council what you had been  
done there, our nation was surprised to hear how great a coun-  
try you had compelled them to give up to you, without your  
paying to us any thing ferit. Every one said that your hearts  
were yetswelled with resentment against us for what had hap-  
pened during the war, but that one day you would consider it  
with mure kindness. We asked each other, what have we  
done to deserve such severe chastisement?  
  
Father: When you kindled your thirteen fires separately, the  
wise men that assembled at them told us, that you were all  
brothers, the children of one great father, who regarded also the  
red people as his children.  
  
They called us brothers, and invited us to his protection; they  
told us that he resided beyond the great water, where the sun  
first rises; that he was a king whose power no people could re-  
sist, and that his goodness was bright as that sun. What they  
said went to our hearts; we accepted the invitation and pro-  
mised to obey him. What the Seneca nation promise, they  
faithfully perform; and when you refused obedience to that  
king, he commanded us to assist his beloved men in making  
you sober. In obeying him, we did no more than yourselves  
led us to promise. ‘The men who claimed this promise told us  
that you were children, and had no guns: that when they had  
shaken you, you would submit. We hearkened to them, and  
were deceived, until your army approached our towns. We  
were deceived; but your people, in teaching us to confide in  
that king, had helped to deceive, and we now appeal to your  
heart. Is the blame all ours?  
  
Father: When we saw that we were deceived, and heard  
the invitation which you gave us to draw near to the fire which  
you had kindled, and talk with you concerning peace, we made  
haste towards it. You then told us that we were in your  
hands and, that, by closing it, you could crush us to nothing,  
and you demanded from us a great country, as the price of that  
peace which you had offered to us—as if our want of strength  
had destroyed our rights; our chiefe had felt your powers, and  
were unable to contend against you, and thezefore gave up that  
country. What they agreed to, has bound our nation; but your  
anger against us must, by this time, be cooled; and, although  
our strength has not increased, nor your power become less,  
we ask you to consider calmly—Were the terms dictated to us  
by your commissioners reasonable and just?  
  
Father: Your commissioners, when they drew the line which  
  
  
  
separated the land then given up to you from that which you -  
  
agreed should remain to be ours, did most solemnly promise,  
that we should be secured in the peaceable possession of the  
lands which we inhabited east and north of that line. Does  
this promise bind you? Hear now, we beseech you, what has  
since happened concerning that land. On the day in -~which  
we finished the treaty at Fort Stanwix, commissioners from  
Pennsylvania told our chiefs that they had come there to pur-  
chase from us all the lands belonging to us, within the lines of  
their state, and they told us that their line would strike the  
river Susquehannah below Tioga branch. They then Jeft us  
to consider of the bargain till the next day; on the next day we  
jetthem know that we were unwilling to sell all the lands  
within their state, and proposed to let them have a part of it,  
which we poiated out to them on their map. They told us that  
they must have the whole; that it was already ceded to them  
by the great king, at the time of making peace with you, and  
was their own; but they said that they would not take advan-  
tage of that, and were willing to pay us for it, after the manner  
of their ancestors. Our chiefs were unable to contend, at that  
time, and therefore they sold the lands up to the line, which  
was then shewn to them as the line of that state. What the  
commissioners had said about the lands having been ceded to  
them at the peace, our chiefs considered as intended only to  
lessen the price, and they passed it by with very little notice;  
but, since that time, we have heard eo much from others about  
the right to our lands, which the king gave when you made  
peace with him, it is our earnest desire that you will tell as  
what it means.  
  
Father: Our nation empowered John Livingston to Jet out  
part of our lands on rent, to be paid tous. He told us, that he  
was sent by congress, to do this for us, and we fear he has de-  
ceived us in the writing he obtained from us.  
  
For, since the time of our giving that power, a man of the  
name of Phelps has come among us, and claimed our whole  
country northward of the line of Pennsylvania, under purchase  
from that Livingston, to whom, he said, he had paid twen  
thousand dollars for it. He said, also, that he had bought, like-  
wise from the counc!! of the thirteen fires, and paid twenty  
thousand dollars more for the same.  
  
And he said, also, that it did not belong to us, for that the  
great king had ceded the whole of it, when you made peace  
with him. Thus he claimed the whole country north of Penn-  
sylvania, and west of the lands belonging to the Cayugas. He  
demanded it; he insisted on his demand, and declared he would

Upon this threat, our chiefs held a council, and they agreed  
that no event of war could be worse than to be driven with  
their wives and ehildren, from the only country which we had  
any right to, and, therefore, weak as our nation was, they de-  
termined to take the chance of war, rather than to submit to  
such unjust demands, which seemed to have no bounds.  
Street, the great trader to Niagara, was then with us, having  
come atthe request of Phelps, and aa he always professed to  
be our great friend, we consulted him upon this subject. He  
also told us, that our lands had been ceded by the king, and  
that we must give them up.  
  
Astonished at what we heard from every quarter, with hearts  
aching with compassion for our women and children, we were  
thus compelled to give up all our country north of the tine of  
Pennsylvania and east of Genesee river, up to the fork, and east  
of a south line drawn from that fork to the Pennsylvania line.  
  
Por this land, Phelps agreed to pay us ten thousand dollars  
in hand, and one thousand a year forever.  
  
He paid us two thousand five hundred dollars in hand, part  
of the ten thousand, and he sent for us to come last spring to  
receive our money; but instead of paying us the remainder of  
the ten thousand dollars, and the one thousand dollars due  
for the first year, he offered us no more than five hundred  
dollars, and insisted that he agreed with us for that sum, to  
be paid yearly. We debated with him for six days, during  
all which time he persisted in refusing to pay us our just de-  
mand, and he insisted that we should receive the five hundred  
dollars; and Street, from Niagara, also insisted on our receiving  
the money, as it was offered us. The last reason he assigned  
for continuing to refuse paying us, was, that the king had ceded  
the lands to the thirteen fires, and that he had bought them from  
you, and paid you for them.  
  
We could bear this confusion no longer, and determined to  
press through every difficulty, and lift up our voice that you  
might hear us, and to claim that security in the possession of  
our lands, which your commissioners so solemnly promised us.  
And we now entreat you to inquire into our complaints and re-  
dress our wrongs.  
  
Father: Our writings were lodged. in the hands of Street, of  
Niagara, as we supposed him to be our friend; but when we  
saw Phelps consulting with Street, on every occasion, we doubt-  
ed of his honesty towards us, and we have since heard, that he  
was to receive for his endeavors to deceive us, a piece of land  
ten miles in width, west of the Genesee river, and nearly forty  
miles in length, extending to Lake Ontario; and the lines of  
this tract have been run accordingly, although no part of it is  
within the bounds which limit his purchase. No doubt but  
what he meant to deceive us.  
  
Father: You have said that we were in your hand, and that,  
by closing it, you could crush us to nothing. Are you deter-  
mined to crush us? [f you are, tell us so, that those of our na-  
tion who have become your children, and have determined to  
die so, may know what to do.  
  
In this case one chief has said he would ask you to put him  
out of pain. Another, who will not think of dying by the hand  
of his father or of his brother, has said he will retire to the Cha-  
teaugay, eat of the fatal root, and sleep with his fathers, in  
peace. Before you determine on a measure so unjust, look up  
to God, who made us as well as you. We hope he will not  
permit you to destroy the whole of our nation.  
  
Father: Hear our case; many nations inhabited this country;  
but they had no wisdom, and, therefore, they warred together.  
The Six Nations were powerful, and compelled them to peace;  
the lands, fora great extent, were given up to them; but the  
nations which were not destroyed, ali continued on those Jands,  
and claimed the protection of the earth. The French came  
among us, and built Niagaras; they became our fathers, and  
took care of us. Sir William Johnston came and took that fort  
frem the French; he became our father, and promised to take  
care of us, and did so, until you were too strong for his king.  
To him we gave four miles round Niagara, as a place of trade.  
We have already said how we came to join against you; we  
saw that We were wrong; we wished for peace; you demanded  
a great country to be given upto you; it was surrendered to  
you, as the price of peace, and we ought to have peace and  
possession of the little land which you then left us.  
  
Father: When that great country waa given up, there were  
but few chiefs present, and they were compelled to give it up,  
aed it is not the Six Nations only that reproach those chiefs  
with having given up that country. The Chippewas, and all  
the nations who lived on those lands westward, call to us, and  
ask us, brotners of our fathers, where is the place you have re-  
served for us to lie down upon?  
  
Father: You have compelied us to do that which has made  
us ashamed. We have nothing to answer to the children of the  
brothers of our fathers. When last epring, they called upon us  
to go to war, to secure them a bed to lie upon, the Senecas en-  
treated them to be quiet, till we had spoken to you. But on  
our way down we heard that your army had gone toward the  
country which those inhabit, and if they meet together, the best  
blood on both sides will stain the ground.  
  
Father: We will not conceal from you, that the great God,  
  
—  
  
rhis own nation. For they ask continually, where is the land  
which our children, and their children after them, are to lie  
down upon? You told us, say they, that the line drawn trom  
Pennsylvania to Lake Oniario, would mark it forever on the  
east, and the line running from Beaver creek to Pennsylvania,  
would mark it on the west, and we see that it is notso. For,  
first one, and another, come and take it away, by order of that  
people which you tell us promised to secure itto us. He is si-  
lent for he has nothing to answer.  
  
When the sun goes down, he opens his heart before God, and  
earlier than that sun appears again upon the hills, he gives  
thanks for his protection during the night: for he feels that,  
among men, become desperate by their danger, it is God only  
that can preserve him. He loves peace, and all he had in store,  
he has given to those who have been robbed by your people,  
lest they should plunder the innocent to repay themselves,  
The whole season which others have employed in providing for  
their families, he has spent in his endeavors to preserve peace;  
and, at this moment, his wife and children are lying on the  
ground, and in want of food; his heart is in pain for them; but  
he perceives that the great God will try his firmness, in doing  
what is right.  
  
Father: The game which the Great Spirit sent into our coun-  
try for us to eat, is going from among us. We thought he in-  
tended that we should till the ground with the plongh, as the  
white people do, and we talked to one another aboutit. But  
before we speak to you concerning this, we must know from  
you whether you mean to leave us and our children any land  
to till. Speak plainly to us concerning this great business.  
  
All the lands, we have been speaking of belonged to the  
Six Nations; no part of it ever belonged to the king of England,  
and he could not give it to you.  
  
The land we live on, our fathers received from God, and they  
transmitted it to us, for our children and we cannot part with it.  
  
Father: We told you that we would open our hearts to you.  
Hear us once more.  
  
At fort Stanwix, we agreed to deliver up those of our people  
who should do you any wrong, that you might try them and  
punish them according to your law. We delivered np two  
men accordingly, but instead of trying them according te your  
law, the lowest of your people took them from your magistraie  
and put them immedately to death. [tis just to punish merder  
with death; but the Senecas will not deliver up their people to  
men who disregard the treaties of their own nation.  
  
Father: Innocent men of our nation are killed one after  
another, and of our best families; but none of your people who  
have cominitted the murder have been punished.  
  
We recollect that you did not promise to punish those who  
killed our people, and we now ask, was it intended that your  
people should kill the Senecas, and not only remain unponish-  
ed by you, but be protected by you against the revenge of the  
next of kin?  
  
Father: These are to us very great things. We know that  
you are very strong, and we have heard that you are wise, and  
we wait to hear your answer to what we have said that we  
may know that your are just.

and there being no dispute but that they com-|

“Brother, if you white men murdered the  
Son of the Great Spirit, we Indians had noth-

“Father : when we saw that we had been  
deceived, and heard the invitation which you  
gave us to draw near tothe fire which you had  
kindled, and talk with you concerning peace,  
we made haste towards it. You told us you  
could crush us to nothing; and you demanded  
from us a great country as the price of that  
peace which you had offered to us: as if our  
want of strength had destroyed our rights, Our  
chiefs have felt your power, and we are unable  
to contend against you, and therefore gave up  
that country. What they agreed to has bound  
our nation, but your anger against us must by  
this time be cooled, and although our strength  
is not increased, nor your power become less,  
we ask you to consider calmly— Were the terms  
dictated to us by your commissioners reasonable  
and just?  
  
“Father: you have said that we were in your

to nothing. Are you determined to crush us?  
If you are, tell us so; that those of our nation  
who have become your children, and have de-

sorted to for the purpose of deceiving the Indians, and  
compelling them to surrender the great country lately  
given up. He referrec to the part he had himself been  
led-to take in making the treaty, and described the effect  
produced upon the minds of his people towards him, and  
proceeded to say:  
  
“Pather! when that great country was surrendered,  
there were but few chiefs present, and they were com-  
pelled to give it up; and it is not the six nations only  
that reproach these chiefs with having given up that  
country. The Chippewas, and all the nations who lived  
on these lands westward, call to us, and ask us, ‘ Broth-  
ors of our fathers, where is the place you have reserved  
for us to lie down upon 7  
  
“Father! you have compelled us to do that which has  
made us ashamed. We have nothing to answer to the  
children of the brethers of our fathers. When last  
spring they called upon us to go to war, to secure a bed  
to lie upon, the Senecas entreated them to be quiet until  
we had spoken to you. But on our way down we heard  
that your army had gone toward the country which  
those nations inhabit, and if they meet together, the best  
blood on beth sides will stain the ground.  
  
“Father! We will not conceal from you that the  
Great God, and not man, has preserved the Cornplanter  
from the hands of his own nation. For they ask con-  
tinually, ‘where is the land which our children, and  
their children after them, are to lie down upon? You  
  
  
  
  
  
away by order of that people which you tell us promised  
to secure itto us.’ He is silent—fcr he has nothing to  
answer. When the sun goes down, he opens his heart  
before God, and earlicr than the sun appears upon the  
hills, he gives thanks for his protection during the night;  
for he feels that among men, become desperate by their  
danger, it is God alone that can protect him. He loves  
peace, and all that he had in store he has given to those  
who have been robbed by your people, lest they should  
plunder the innocent to repay themselves. The whole  
season while others have have been employed in provid-  
ing for their families, he has spent in his endeavors to  
preservo peace, and at this moment his wife and children  
are lying on the ground, and in want of food ; his heart  
is pained for them, but he perceives that the Great God  
will try his firmness in doing what is right.  
  
“ Father! You have said we are in your hand, and  
that by crushing it you could crush usto nothing. Are  
you determined tocrush us? If you are, tcll us so, that  
those of our nation who Fave become your children, and  
have determined to dio so, may know what to do.  
  
In this ease, one chief has said he would entreat you  
to put him out of pain. Another, who will not think of  
dying by the hand of his father or his brother, has said  
he will: retire to the Chateaugay, eat of the fatal root,  
and sleep with his fathers in peace. .  
  
“ Before you determine on a measure so unjust, look  
up to God, who made ws as well as you. We hope he  
will not permit you to destroy the whole of our na-  
tions.  
  
“ Pather! Innocent men of our nation are killed one  
after another, and of our best families; but none of your  
people who have committed these murders have been  
punished. We now ask you, was it intended that your  
people should kill the Senecas, and not only remain un-  
punished by you, but be protected by you against the re-  
venge of the next of kin?  
  
“ Fatha! These are to us very great things. We  
know that you are very strong, we have heard that you  
are wise, and we now wait tO receive your answer to  
what we have said, that we may know if you are just.”
