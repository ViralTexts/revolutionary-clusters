Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives  
On our present meeting, it is my first duty to invite your attention, to the providential favors which our Country has experienced, in the unusual degree of health dispensed to its inhabitants, and in the rich abundance with which the Earth has rewarded the labours bestowed on it. In the successful cultivation of other branches of industry, and in the progress of general improvement favorable to the national prosperity, there is just occasion also, for our mutual congratulations and thankfulness.  
With these blessings are necessarily mingled, the pressures and vicisitudes incident to the state of war, into which the United States have been forced, by the perseverence of a foreign power in its system of injustice and aggression.  
Previous to its declaration, it was deemed proper, as a measure of precaution and forecast, that a considerable force should be placed in the Michigan Territory; with a general view to its security and, in the event of war, to such operations in the uppermost Canada, as would intercept the hostile influence of Great Britain over the Savages, obtain the command of the Lake on which that part of Canada borders, and maintain co-operating relations with such forces, as might be most conveniently employed against other parts. Brigadier General Hull was charged with this provisional service; having under his command, a body of Troops composed of regulars, and of volunteers from the State of Ohio. Having reached his destination after his knowledge of the war, and possessing discretionary authority to act offensively, he passed into the neighbouring territory of the Enemy, with a prospect of easy and victorious progress. The Expedition, nevertheless, terminated unfortunately, not only in a retreat to the town and Fort of Detroit, but in the surrender of both, and of the gallant corps commanded by that Officer. The causes of this painful reverse, will be investigated by a Military Tribunal.  
A distinguishing feature in the operations which preceded and followed this adverse event, is the use made by the Enemy, of the merciless savages under their influence. Whilst the benevolent policy of the United States invariably recommended peace and promoted civilization, among that wretched portion of the human race; and was making exertions to dissuade them from taking either side in the war; the Enemy has not scrupled to call to his aid, their ruthless ferocity, armed with the horrors of those instruments of carnage and torture, which are known to spare neither age nor sex. In this outrage against the laws of honorable war, and against the feelings sacred to humanity, the British commanders cannot resort to a plea of retaliation: For it is committed in the face of our example. They cannot mitigate it, by calling it a self defence against men in arms for it embraces the most shocking butcheries of defenceless families. Nor can it be pretended that they are not answerable for the atrocities perpetrated; since the Savages are employed with a knowledge, and even with menaces, that their fury could not be controuled. Such is the spectacle which the deputed authorities of a nation, boasting its religion and morality, have not been restrained, from presenting to an enlightened age.  
The misfortune at Detroit was not, however, without a consoling effect. It was followed by signal proofs, that the national spirit rises, according to the pressure on it. The loss of an important post, and of the brave men surrendered with it, inspired every where, new ardor and determination. In the States and Districts least remote, it was no sooner known, than every Citizen was ready to fly with his arms, at once to protect his brethren against the bloodthirsty Savages let loose by the Enemy on an extensive frontier, and to convert a partial calamity, into a source of invigorated efforts. This patriotic zeal, which it was necessary rather to limit than excite, has embodied an ample force from the States of Kentucky and Ohio, and from parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is placed, with the addition of a few regulars, under the command of Brigadier General Harrison; who possesses the entire confidence of his fellow Soldiers, among whom are Citizens, some of them volunteers in the ranks, not less distinguished by their political stations, than by their personal merits. The greater portion of this force is proceeding on its destination, towards the Michigan Territory; having succeeded in relieving an important Frontier post; and in several incidental operations against hostile tribes of Savages, rendered indispensible by the subserviency into which they had been seduced by the Enemy; a seduction the more cruel, as it could not fail to impose a necessity of precautionary severities, against those who yielded to it.  
At a recent date, an attack was made on a post of the Enemy near Niagara, by a detachment of the regular and other forces, under the command of Major General Van Renssalear of the militia of the State of New York. The attack, it appears, was ordered in compliance with the ardor of the troops; who executed it with distinguished gallantry, and were for a time victorious; but not receiving the expected support, they were compelled to yield to reinforcements of British regulars and savages. Our loss has been considerable, and is deeply to be lamented. That of the Enemy, less ascertained, will be the more felt, as it includes among the killed, the commanding General who was also the Governor of the Province; and was sustained by veteran troops, from inexperienced soldiers, who must daily improve in the duties of the field.  
Our expectation of gaining the command of the Lakes, by the invasion of Canada from Detroit, having been disappointed; measures were instantly taken to provide on them, a naval force superior to that of the Enemy. From the talents and activity of the Officer charged with this object, every thing that can be done, may be expected. Should the present season not admit of compleat success, the progress made will ensure for the next, a naval ascendancy, where it is essential to our permanent peace with, and controul over the Savages.  
Among the incidents to the measures of the war, I am constrained to advert to the refusal of the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut, to furnish the required detachments of Militia, towards the defence of the maritime frontier. The refusal was founded on a novel and unfortunate exposition, of the provisions of the Constitution relating to the Militia. The correspondences which will be before you, contain the requisite information on the subject. It is obvious, that if the authority of the United States, to call into service and command the Militia, for the public defence, can be thus frustrated, even in a state of declared war, and of course under apprehensions of invasion preceding war; they are not one nation for the purpose most of all requiring it; and that the public safety may have no other resource, than in those large and permanent military establishments; which are forbidden by the principles of our free Government, and against the necessity of which, the militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark.  
On the coasts and on the ocean, the war has been as successful, as circumstances inseparable from its early stages, could promise. Our public ships and private cruisers, by their activity, and where there was occasion by their intrepedity, have made the enemy sensible of the difference between a reciprocity of captures, and the long confinement of them to their side. Our trade, with little exception, has safely reached our ports; having been much favored in it, by the course pursued by a Squadron of our Frigates under the Command of Commodore Rodgers. And in the instance, in which skill and bravery were more particularly tried with those of the Enemy, the American flag had an auspicious triumph. The Frigate Constitution commanded by Captain Hull, after a close and short engagement, compleatly disabled and captured a British Frigate; gaining for that officer and all on board, a praise which cannot be too liberally bestowed; not merely for the victory actually atchieved; but for that prompt and cool exertion of commanding talents; which giving to courage its highest character, and to the force applied its full effect, proved that more could have been done, in a contest requiring more.  
Anxious to abridge the evils from which a state of war cannot be exempt, I lost no time, after it was declared, in conveying to the British Government, the terms on which its progress might be arrested, without awaiting the delays of a formal and final pacification. And our chargé d’affaires at London was, at the same time, authorized to agree to an armistice founded upon them. These terms required, that the Orders in Council should be repealed as they affected the United States, without a revival of blockades violating acknowledged rules; and that there should be an immediate discharge of American Seamen from British ships, and a stop to impressments from American ships; with an understanding that an exclusion of the seamen of each nation, from the ships of the other, should be stipulated; and that the armistice should be improved into a definitive, and comprehensive adjustment of depending controversies. Although a repeal of the Orders, susceptible of explanations meeting the views of this Government, had taken place before this pacific advance was communicated to that of Great Britain, the advance was declined; from an avowed repugnance to a suspension of the practice of impressment, during the armistice, and without any intimation that the arrangement proposed with respect to Seamen, would be accepted. Whether the subsequent communications from this Government, affording an occasion for reconsidering the subject, on the part of Great Britain, will be viewed in a more favorable light, or received in a more accomodating spirit, remains to be known. It would be unwise to relax our measures, in any respect, on a presumption of such a result.  
The documents from the Department of State which relate to this subject, will give a view also, of the propositions for an armistice which have been received here, one of them from the authorities at Halifax and in Canada, the other from the British Government itself, through Admiral Warren; and of the grounds on which neither of them could be accepted.  
Our affairs with France retain the posture which they held, at my last communications to you. Notwithstanding the authorized expectation of an early, as well as favorable issue, to the discussions on foot, these have been procrastinated to the latest date. The only intervening occurrence meriting attention, is the promulgation of a French Decree, purporting to be a definitive repeal of the Berlin and Milan Decrees. This proceeding, although made the ground of the repeal of the British Orders in Council, is rendered by the time and manner of it, liable to many objections.  
The final communications from our Special Minister to Denmark, afford further proofs of the good effects of his mission, and of the amicable disposition of the Danish Government. From Russia, we have the satisfaction to receive assurances of continued friendship, and that it will not be affected by the rupture between the United States and Great Britain. Sweeden also professes sentiments, favorable to the subsisting harmony.  
With the Barbary powers, excepting that of Algiers, our affairs remain on the ordinary footing. The Consul General residing with that Regency, has suddenly and without cause, been banished, together with all the American Citizens found there. Whether this was the transitory effect of capricious despotism, or the first act of predetermined hostility, is not ascertained. Precautions were taken by the Consul, on the latter supposition.  
The Indian Tribes, not under foreign instigations, remain at peace, and receive the civilizing attentions which have proved so beneficial to them.  
With a view to that vigorous prosecution of the war to which our national faculties are adequate, the attention of Congress will be particularly drawn to the insufficiency of the existing provisions for filling up the military establishment. Such is the happy condition of our country, arising from the facility of subsistance, and the high wages for every species of occupation, that notwithstanding the augmented inducements provided at the last session, a partial success only has attended the recruiting service. The deficiency has been necessarily supplied, during the campaign, by other than regular troops, with all the inconveniencies and expence incident to them. The remedy lies in establishing, more favorably for the private soldier, the proportion between his recompence and the term of his enlistment. And it is a subject which cannot too soon or too seriously, be taken into consideration.  
The same insufficiency has been experienced in the provisions for volunteers, made by an act of the last session. The recompence for the service required in this case, is still less attractive than in the other. And although patriotism alone, has sent into the field some valuable corps of that description, those alone who can afford the sacrifice can be re[a]sonably expected to yield to that impulse.  
It will merit consideration also whether, as auxiliary to the security of our Frontiers, corps may not be advantageously organized, with a restriction of their services to particular districts convenient to them. And whether the local and occasional services of Mariners and others in the seaport-Towns, under a similar organization, would not be a provident addition to the means of their defence.  
I recommend a provision for an increase of the General officers of the Army, the deficiency of which has been illustrated by the number and distance of seperate commands, which the course of the war, and the advantage of the service, have required.  
And I cannot press too strongly on the earliest attention of the Legislature, the importance of a re-organization of the Staff Establishment; with a view to render more distinct and definite, the relations and responsibilities of its several departments. That there is room for improvements which will materially promote both economy and success, in what appertains to the army and the war, is equally inculcated by the examples of other countries, and by the experience of our own.  
A revision of the Militia laws, for the purpose of rendering them more systematic, and better adapting them to emergences of the war, is at this time particularly desirable.  
Of the additional ships authorized to be fitted for service, two will be shortly ready to sail; a third is under repair; and delay will be avoided in the repair of the residue. Of the appropriations for the purchase of materials for ship building, the greater part has been applied to that object, and the purchases will be continued with the ballance.  
The enterprizing spirit which has characterized our naval force, and its success, both in restraining insults and depredations on our Coasts, and in reprisals on the Enemy, will not fail to recommend an enlargement of it.  
There being reason to believe that the act prohibiting the acceptance of British licences, is not a sufficient guard against the use of them, for purposes favorable to the interests and views of the Enemy; further provisions on that subject are highly important. Nor is it less so, that penal enactments should be provided, for cases of corrupt and perfidious intercourse with the Enemy, not amounting to Treason, nor yet embraced by any statutory provisions.  
A considerable number of American vessels which were in England, when the revocation of the orders in council took place, were laden with British manufactures, under an erroneous impression that the non-importation act would immediately cease to operate, and have arrived in the United States. It did not appear proper to exercise on unforeseen cases of such magnitude, the ordinary powers vested in the Treasury Department to mitigate forfeitures, without previously affording to Congress an opportunity of making on the subject such provision as they may think proper. In their decision they will doubtless equally consult what is due to equitable considerations and to the public interest.  
The receipts into the Treasury, during the year ending on the thirtieth of September last, have exceeded sixteen millions and a half of dollars, which have been sufficient to defray all the demands on the Treasury to that day, including a necessary reimbursment of near three Millions of the principal of the public debt. In these receipts is included, a sum of near five millions eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars, received on account of the loans authorised by the acts of the last session: the whole sum actually obtained on loan, amounts to eleven Millions of dollars; the residue of which, being receivable subsequent to the thirtieth of September last, will, together with the current revenue, enable us to defray all the expences of this year. The duties on the late unexpected importations of British manufactures, will render the revenue of the ensuing year, more productive than could have been anticipated.  
  
The situation of our country, fellow Citizens, is not without its difficulties, though it abounds in animating considerations, of which the view here presented, of our pecuniary resources, is an example. With more than one nation we have serious and unsettled controversies; and with one, powerful in the means and habits of war, we are at war. The spirit and strength of this nation are, nevertheless, equal to the support of all its rights; and to carry it through all its trials. They can be met in that confidence. Above all we have the inestimable consolation of knowing, that the war in which we are actually engaged, is a war, neither of ambition nor of vain glory; that it is waged, not in violation of the rights of others, but in the maintenance of our own; that it was preceeded by a patience without example, under wrongs accumulating without end; and that it was finally not declared, until every hope of averting it was extinguished, by the transfer of the British Sceptre into new hands, clinging to former Councils; and until declarations were re-iterated to the last hour, through the British Envoy here, that the hostile Edicts against our commercial rights and our maritime Independence, would not be revoked; nay, that they could not be revoked without violating the obligations of Great Britain to other powers, as well as to her own interests. To have shrunk under such circumstances from manly resistance, would have been a degradation, blasting our best and proudest hopes: It would have struck us from the high rank, where the virtuous struggles of our fathers had placed us, and have betrayed the magnificent legacy which we hold in trust for future generations. It would have acknowledged that on the Element, which forms three fo[u]rths of the globe we inhabit, and where all independent nations have equal and common rights, the American people were not an independent people, but colonists and vassals. It was at this moment, and with such an alternative, that war was chosen. The nation felt the necessity of it, and called for it. The appeal was accordingly made, in a just cause, to the just and all powerful Being, who holds in his hands the chain of events, and the destiny of nations. It remains only, that faithful to ourselves; entangled in no connections with the views of other powers, and ever ready to accept peace from the hand of justice, we prosecute the war with united councils and with the ample faculties of the nation; until peace be so obtained, and as the only means, under the divine blessing of speedily obtaining it.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Fellow citizens of the senate and  
hpuse of representatives.  
  
On our present meeting, it is my  
first duty to invite your attention to  
the providential favours which our  
country has experienced in the unu¬  
sual degree of health dispensed to its  
inhabitants, and in the rich abundance  
with which the earth has rewarded  
the labours bestowed on it. In the  
successful cultivation of other bran¬  
ches of industry, and in the progress  
of general improvement favoura^ to  
the national prosperity, there is just  
occasion also for our mutual congra¬  
tulations and thankfulness.  
  
With these blessings are naturally  
mingled the pressures and vicissitudes  
incidental to the state of war into  
which the United States have been  
foroed by the perseverance of a fo¬  
reign power in its system of injustice  
and aggression. Previous to its de-  
alaration, it was decn)ed proper, as a  
  
measure of precaution and forecast,  
that a considerable force should be  
placed in the Michigan territory, with  
a general view to its security; and,  
in the event of war, to such opera¬  
tions in the uppermost Canada, as  
would intercept the hostile influence  
of Great Britain over the savages }  
obtain the command of the lake on  
which that part of Canada borders }  
and maintain co-operating relations  
with such forces as might be most  
conveniently employed against other  
parts.  
  
Brigadier-General Hull was char¬  
ged with this provisional service, ha¬  
ving under his command a body of  
troops, con^sed of regulars and of  
volunteers from the state of Ohio:  
having reached his destination, after  
his knowledge of the war, and pos¬  
sessing discretionary authority to act  
offensively, he passed into the neigh¬  
bouring territory of the enemy with  
a prospect of an easy and victorious  
progress. The expedition, neverthe¬  
less, teiminated unfortunately, not on¬  
ly in a retreat to the town and fort of  
Detroit, but in the surrender of both,  
and of the gallant corps commanded  
by that officer. The causes of this  
painful reverse will be investigated by  
a military tribunal. A distinguishing  
feature in the operations which pre¬  
ceded and followed this adverse event,  
is the use made by the enemy of the  
merciless savages under their influ¬  
ence. Whilst the benevolent policy  
of the United States invariably re¬  
commended peace, and promot^ ci¬  
vilization amongst that wretched  
portion of the human race, and was  
making exertions to dissuade them  
from takmg either side in the war,  
the enemy has not scrupled to call to  
his aid their ruthless ferocity, armed  
with the horrors of those instruments  
of carnage and torture which are

known to spare neither&gt;age nor sex.  
In this outrage against the laws of  
honourable war, and ag^nst the feel¬  
ings sacred to humanity, the British  
commanders cannot resort to a plan  
of retaliation ; for it is committed in  
the face of our example. They can¬  
not mitigate it by calling it a self-de¬  
fence against men in arms, for it em¬  
braces the most shocking butcheries  
of defenceless families ; nor can it be  
pretended that they are not answera¬  
ble for the atrocities perpetrated,  
since the savages are employed with  
the knowledge, and even with mena¬  
ces, that their fury could not be con¬  
trolled. Such is the spectacle which  
the deputed authorities of a nation  
boasting its religion and morality,  
have not. been restrained from pre¬  
senting to an enlightened age.  
  
The misfortune at Detroit was not,  
however, without a consoling effect.  
It wks followed by signal proofs,  
that the national spirit rises according  
to the pressure on it. The loss of an  
important post, and of the brave men  
surrendered with it, inspired every  
where new ardour and determination.  
In the states tmd districts least re¬  
mote, it was no sooner known, than  
every citizen was eager to fly with  
his arms at once to protect his bre¬  
thren against the blood-thirsty sava¬  
ges let loose by the enemy on an ex¬  
tensive frontier; and to convert a  
partial calamity into a source of invi¬  
gorated efiForts. This patriotic zeal,  
M&#x27;hich it was necessary rather to limit  
than excite, has embodied an ample  
force from the states of Kentucky  
and Ohio, and from parts of Pennsyl¬  
vania and Virginia. It is placed, with  
the addition of a few regulars, under  
the command of Brigadier-General  
Harrison, who possesses the entire  
confidence of his fellow-soldiers ;  
»moilg whom are citizens,—some of  
  
them volunteers in the ranks,—-not  
less distinguished by their political  
stations, than by their personal me¬  
rits.  
  
The grater portion of this force  
is proc^ing oirits destination to¬  
wards the Michigan territory, having  
succeeded in relieving an important  
frontier post, and in several incidental  
operations against hostile tribes of sa¬  
vages, rendered indispensable by the  
subserviency into which they have  
been seduced by the enemy ; a seduc¬  
tion the more cruel, as it could not  
fail to impose a necessity of precau¬  
tionary severities against those who  
yielded to it.  
  
At a recent date, an attack was  
made on a post of the enemy near  
Nicgara, by a detachment of the re¬  
gular and other forces, under the  
command of Major General Van  
Rensselaer, of the militia of the State  
of New York. The attack, it ap¬  
pears, was ordered in compliance with  
the ardour of the troops, who execu¬  
ted it with distinguished gallantry,  
and were for a time victorious ; but  
not receiving the expected support,  
they were compelled to yield to rein¬  
forcements of British regulars and sa¬  
vages. Our loss has been considera¬  
ble, and is deeply to be lamented.  
That of the enemy, less ascertained,  
will be the more felt, as it includes  
among the killed, the commanding  
general, who was also governor of the  
province; and was sustained by vete¬  
ran troops, from inexperienced sol¬  
diers, who must daily improve in the  
duties of the field.  
  
Our expectation of gaining the  
command of the Lakes by the inva¬  
sion of Canada from Detroit, having  
been disappointed, measures were in¬  
stantly taken to provide on them a  
naval force superior to that of the  
enemy. From the talents smd activi-

ty of the officer charged with this  
objectf every thing that can be done  
may be expected. Should the pre*  
sent season not admit of complete  
success, the progress made will ensure  
for the next a naval ascendency where  
it is essential to a permanent peace  
with, and control over, the savages.  
  
Among the incidents to the mea*  
sures of the war, 1 am&#x27;constrained to  
advert to the refusal of the governors  
of Massachusetts and Connecticut to  
furnish the required detachments of  
militia towards the defence of the ma«  
ritime frontier. The refusal was  
founded on a novel and unfortunate  
exposition of the provision of the  
constitution relating to the militia.  
The correspondence, which will be  
laid before you, contains the ret^uisite  
information on the subject. It is ob&gt;  
vious, that if the authority of the  
United States to call into service and  
command the militia for the public  
defence, can be thus frustrated, even  
in a state of declared war, and of  
course under apprehensions of inva¬  
sion preceding war, they are not one  
nation for the purpose most of all re¬  
quiring it, and that the public safety  
may have no other resource than those  
large and permanent military esta¬  
blishments which are forbidden by  
the principles of our free government,  
and against the necessity of which the  
militia were meant to be a constitu¬  
tional bulwark.  
  
On the coasts and on the ocean,  
tlie war has been as successful as cir¬  
cumstances from its early stages could  
promise. Our public ships and pri¬  
vate cruizers, by their activity, and,  
where there was occasion, by their  
intrepidity, have made the enemy sen¬  
sible of the difference between a reci¬  
procity of captures, and the long con¬  
finement of them to their side. Our  
  
trade, with little exception, has safely  
reached our ports, having been much  
favoured in it by the course pursued  
by a squadron of our frigates under  
the command of Commodore Rod¬  
gers ; and in the instance in which  
skill and bravery were more particu¬  
larly tried with those of the enemy,  
the American flag had an auspicious  
triumph. The frigate Constitution,  
commanded by Captain Hull, after a  
close and short engagement, com¬  
pletely disabled and captured a Bri¬  
tish frigate; gaining for that officer,  
and ail on board, a praise which can¬  
not be too liberally bestowed,—not  
merely for the victory actually achie¬  
ved, but for that prompt and cool  
exertion of commanding talents,  
which, giving to courage its highest  
character, and to the force applied its  
full effect, proved that more could  
have been done in a contest requiring  
more.  
  
Anxious to abridge the evils from  
which a state of war cannot be ex¬  
empt, I lost no time after it was de¬  
clared, in conveying to the British  
government the terms on which its  
progress might be arrested, without  
waiting the delays of a formal and fi¬  
nal pacification: and our charge d’¬  
affaires at London was at the same  
time authorised to agree to an armis¬  
tice founded upon them. These  
terms required, that the orders in  
council should be repealed, as they  
affected the United States, without a  
revival of the blockades violating ac¬  
knowledged rules; that there should  
be an immediate discharge of Ameri¬  
can seamen from British ships, and a  
stop to impressments from American  
ships, with an understanding that an  
exclusion of the seamen of each na-  
tion from the ships of the other  
should be stipulated, and that the ar.  
  
S16  
  
EDINBURGH ANNUAL REGISTER, 1812.  
  
mistice should be improved into a de¬  
finitive and comprehensive adjustment  
of depending controversies.  
  
Although a repeal of the orders,  
susceptible of explanations meeting  
the views of this government had ta¬  
ken place before ^is pacific advance  
was communicated to that of Great  
Britain, the advance was declined  
from an avowed repu^ance to a sus¬  
pension of the practice of impress¬  
ment during the armistice, and with¬  
out any intimation that the arrange¬  
ment proposed with respect to seamen  
would be accepted. Whether the  
subsequent communications from this  
government, affording an occasion for  
re-considering the subject on the part  
of Great Britain, will be viewed in a  
more favourable light, or received in  
a more accommodating spirit, remains  
to be known. It womd be unwise to  
relax our measures, in any respect, on  
a presumption of such a result.  
  
The documents from the depart¬  
ment of state, which relate to this  
subject, will give a view also of the  
propositions for an armistice, which  
have been received here^-one of them,  
from the authorities at Halifax and  
in Canada, the other from the British  
government itself, through admiral  
. Warren; and of the grounds upon  
which neither of them could be ac¬  
cepted.  
  
Our affairs with France retain the  
posture which they held at my last  
communication to you.  
  
Notwithstanding the authorised ex¬  
pectation of an early as well as favour¬  
able issue of the discussions on foot,  
these have been procrastinated to the  
latest date. The only intervening  
occurrence meriting attention, is the  
promulgation of a French decree,  
purporting to be a definitive  
of the Berun and Milan decrees. This  
proceeding, although made the ground  
  
of the repeal of the British orders in  
council, 18 rendered, by the time and  
manner of it, liable to many objec¬  
tions.  
  
The final communications from  
our special minister to Denmark, af¬  
ford Further proofs of the good effects  
of his mission, and of the amicable  
disposition of the Danish government.  
From Russia we have the satisfaction  
to receive assurances of continued  
friendship, and that it will not be af¬  
fected by the rupture between the  
United States and Great Britain.  
Sweden also professes sentiments fii-  
vourable to existing harmony.  
  
With the Barbary powers, except¬  
ing that of Algiers, our affairs remain  
on the ordinary footing. The con¬  
sul-general residing with that regen¬  
cy, has suddenly, and without cause,  
been banished, together with all the  
American citizens found there. Whe¬  
ther this was the transitory effect of  
capricious despotism, or the first act  
of predetermined hostility, is not as¬  
certained. Precautions were taken  
by the consul on the latter supposi¬  
tion.  
  
The Indian tribes, not under fo¬  
reign instigations, remain at peace,  
and receive the civilising attentions  
which have proved so beneficial to  
them.  
  
With a view to that vigorous pro¬  
secution of the war to which our na¬  
tional faculties are adequate, the at¬  
tention of congress will tc particular¬  
ly drawn to the insufficiency of the  
existing provisions for filling up the  
military establishment. Such is the  
happy condition of our country,  
ansing from the facility of subsist¬  
ence, and the high wages for every  
species of occupation, that, notwith¬  
standing the augmented inducements  
provided at the last session, a partial  
success only has attended the recruit

ing service. .The deficiency has been  
necessarily supplied during the cam*  
paign by other than regular troops,  
with all the inconveniences and ex*  
pences incident to them. The reme*  
dy lies in establishing more favour^  
ably for the private soldier, the pro*  
portion between his recompense and  
the term of his enlistment: and it is  
a subject which cannot too soon or  
too seriously be taken into considera*  
tion. The same insufficiency has  
been experienced in the provisions for  
volunteers made by an act of the last  
session. The recompense for the  
service required in this case, is still  
less attractive than in the other; and  
although patriotism alone has sent  
into the field some valuable corps of  
that description, those alone who can  
afford the sacrifice, can reasonably be  
expected to yield to the impulse. It  
will merit consideration also, wlie*  
ther, as auxiliary to the security of  
our frontier, corps may not be advan*  
tageously organized, with a restric*  
tion of their services, to particular  
districts convenient to them ; and  
whether the local or occasional servi*  
ces of marines or others in the sea*  
port towns, under a similar organiza*  
tion, would not be a proper addition  
to tlie means of their defence. I re¬  
commend a provision for an increase  
of the geneim officers of the arm^,  
the deficiency of which has been il*  
lustrated by the number and distance  
of separate commands, which the  
cause of the war, and the advantage  
of the service, have required; and I  
cannot press too strongly on the ear*  
liest attention of the legislature, the  
importance of the re*organization of  
the staff establishment, with a view  
to render more distinct and definite  
ffie relations and responsibilities of  
its several departments: that there  
il room for improvementi which will  
  
materially promote both economy and  
success, in what appertains to the ar¬  
my and the war, is equally inculcated  
by the examples of other countries,  
and by the experience of our own.  
  
A revision of the militia laws, for  
the purpose of rendering them more  
systematic, and better adapting them  
to emergencies of the war, is at this  
time particularly desirable. Of the  
additional ships authorised to be fit¬  
ted for service, two will be shortly  
ready to sail; a third is under repair,  
and delay vrill be avoided in the re¬  
pair of the residue. Of the appro¬  
priations for the purchase of mate¬  
rials for ship-building, the greater  
part has been applied to that object,  
and the purchases will be continued  
with the balance. The enterp*‘Uing  
spirit which has characterized our  
naval force, and its success both ia  
restraining insults and depredations  
on our coasts, and in reprisals on the  
enemy, vrill not fail to recommend an  
enlargement upon it.  
  
There being reason to believe, that  
the act prohibiting the acceptance of  
British licenses is not a sufficient  
guard against the use of them, for  
purposes favourable to the interests  
and views of the enemy: further pro¬  
visions on that subject are highly im¬  
portant. Nor is it less so, that penal  
enactments should be provided for  
cases of corrupt and perfidious inter¬  
course with the enemy, not amount¬  
ing to treason, nor yet embraced by  
any statutory provisions.  
  
A considerable number of Ameri¬  
can vessels, which in England, when  
the revocation of the orders in coun¬  
cil took place, were laden with Bri¬  
tish manmactures, under an errone¬  
ous impression that the non.importa-  
tion act would immediately cease ta  
operate, have arrived in the United  
States. It did not appear proper to

exercise on unforeseen cases of such  
magnitude, the ordinary poarers vest*  
«d in the treasury department, to mi-  
tif^te forfeitures without previously  
affording congress an opportunity of  
making on the subject such provi.  
aions as they may think proper. In  
their decisions they will, doubtless,  
equally consult what is due to equi¬  
table considerations, and to the pub¬  
lic interest.  
  
The receipts into the treasury du¬  
ring the year ending on the 30th of  
September last, have exceeded six¬  
teen millions and a half of dollars;  
which have been sufficient to defray  
all the demands on the treasury to  
that day, including a necessary reim¬  
bursement of near three milhons of  
the princij^al of the public debt. In  
these receipts are included a sum of  
near 8,850,000 received on account  
of the loans authorised by the acts of  
last session. The whole sum actual¬  
ly obtained on loan, amounts to ele-  
ven millions of dollars, the residue of  
which being receivable subsequent to  
the 30th of September, will, together  
with the current revenue, enable us to  
defray all the expenses of this year.  
  
The duties on the late unexpected  
importations of British manufactures  
will render the revenue of the ensu¬  
ing year more productive than could  
have been anticipated. The situation  
of our country, fellow-citizens, is not  
without its difficulties, though it  
abounds in animating considerations,  
of which the view here presented of  
our pec uniary resources is an example.  
With more than one nation we have  
serious and unsettled controversies;  
and with one powerful in the means  
and habits of war, we are at war.  
The spirit and strength of this na¬  
tion are, nevertheless, equal to the  
support of all its rights, and to carry  
it tiirough all its trials. They can  
» 2  
  
be met in that con&amp;dence. Above  
all, we have the inestimable consola¬  
tion of knowing that the war in which  
we are actually engaged, is a war  
neither of ambition nor vain glory;  
that it is waged, not in violation of  
the rights of others, but in the main¬  
tenance of our own ; that it was pre¬  
ceded by a patience without example,  
under wrongs accumulating without  
end; and that it was finally not de¬  
clared until every hope of averting it  
was extinguished by the British scep¬  
tre falling into new hands, clinging to  
former councils, and until declarations  
were reiterated in the last hour  
through the British envoy here, that  
the hostile edicts against our com¬  
mercial rights and our maritime inde¬  
pendence could not be revoked, with¬  
out violating the obligations of Great  
Britain to other powers as well as to  
her own interests. To have shrunk,  
under such circumstances, from man¬  
ly resistance, would have been a de¬  
gradation blasting our best &#x27;and  
proudest hopes. It would have  
struck us from the high rank where  
the virtuous struggles of our fathers  
had placed us, aud would have be¬  
trayed the magnificent legacy which  
we hold in trust for future genera¬  
tions. It would have acknowledged,  
that on the element which forms  
theee-fourths of the globe we inhabit,  
and where all independent nations  
have equal and common rights, the  
American people were nut an inde¬  
pendent people, but colonists and vas¬  
sals.  
  
It was at this moment, and with  
such an alternative, that war was  
chosen. The nation felt the neces¬  
sity of it, and called for it. The ap¬  
peal was accordingly made in a just  
cause, to the just and powerful Being,  
who holds in his hands the chain of  
events and the destiny of nations. It

Fellow-Citizen* of the  
Senate Cf House of Pe/iresentatives,  
On our present meeting it is my first duty  
to invite your attention toilie Providential  
favors whiqU our country lias experienced,  
in tlie unusual degree of health dispensed  
to its inhabitants, and in tlie ricli abund­  
ance with which the earth li.ts rewarded  
the labors bestowed oil it. In the success­  
lul cultivation of o.iier branches of indus­  
try, and in the progress of general improve­  
ment favorable to the national prosperity,  
tliere is just occasion, also, for our mutual  
congratulations and thankfulness.  
With tnese blessings are necessarily min­  
gled tlie pressures and vicissitudes in&#x27;eiden­  
t .1 to the state of wrtr, into which the Uni  
ted States have been forced by tlie perse­  
verance of a foreign power, in its system of  
injustice and aggression.  
Previous to its declaration, it was deemed  
proper, as a measure of precaution and  
forecast, that a considerable force should  
he placed in the Michigan territory, with a  
genet al view to its security, and, in the e­  
vent of war, to ouch operations in the up  
pei most Canada as would intercept tlie hos­  
tile influence of G real Britain over the sa­  
vages, obtain the command of the lake on  
which that part of Canada borders, and  
maintain co-operating relations with such  
forces as might be most conveniently em­  
ployed against other parts, brigadier-(re­  
neral Hull was charged with tliis provision­  
al service ; having under liis command a  
body of troops composed of regulars and of  
volunteer* from tile state of Ohio, lluving  
reached his destination after his knowledge  
of the war, and possessing discretionary au­  
thor! iv to act ogeusivelv, he parsed into the  
neighboring terj itc+y of the enemy with a  
prospect ot easy and victorious progress.—­  
/ lie expedition nevertheless terminated  
unfortunately, not only in a retreat to the  
town and tort of Detroit, but in the. surren­  
der of both, and of the gallant corps crhil­  
mr.nded by that officer. Tlie causes of tliis  
p tiiiful reverse will be investigated by  
military tribunal.  
a  
  
A distinguishing feature in the operations  
which preceded and folio ved this adverse  
event, is the use made hy the enemy &lt;&gt;t the  
Merciless s ivages under their h fluence._  
Whilst the benevolent policy of the l/niteh  
■states, invariably recommended pence and  
pr imoted civilisation, among that wretch­  
ed portion of the human race ; and wan ma­  
lting exertions to dissuade them from taking  
• iiher side in the war, t.he enemy has not  
scrupled to call to his aid their ruthless fe­  
rocity. armed with the horrors of those in­  
struments of carnage arid torture, which arc  
kno wn to spare neither ag&lt;: nor sex. In this  
outrage against the lawsof honorable war, 5c  
ujjuast the feelings sacred to lidmanity, tlic  
  
British commanders cannot resort to ft plea  
of&#x27;rctaiiatiou : f.n* it is commuted in the lack  
of our example. They camiot mitigate It,  
by Colling it a self-defence against men in  
arms: for it embraces the most shocking  
butcheries of defenceless families. No;* can  
it be pretended that they are not answera­  
ble lor the atrocities perpetrated; since  
the savages are employed with a koow­  
&#x27;edge, and even with menaces, that their  
luvv could not be Controlled. Such is the  
spectacle which the deputed authorities uf  
a nation, boasting its religion and morality,  
have not been restrained from presenting to  
an enlightened age.  
  
i nc iinstorlnue m Detroit was not, howe­  
ver, without a consoling effect. It was fol­  
lowed by signal proofs,that the national spi­  
rit rises according to the pressure on it.—  
The loss of an important post, at.d of Uie  
brave men surrendered with it, inspired eve­  
ry wliete new ardor and determination. In  
the states and districts least remote, it was  
no sooner known, than every citizen was  
ready to fly with Ins turns, at c.nce to pro­  
tect his brethren against the blood-thirsty  
savages let loose by the enemy oil an ex­  
tensive frontier ; and to convert a paitiut ca­  
lamity into a source of Invigorated .efforts.  
&#x27;1 bis patriotic .real, which it was necessary  
rather to limit than excite, has embodied ;.n  
ample force fro in the states ol&quot; Kentucky ik.  
Ohio, and from parts of Pennsylvania and  
Virginia.&gt;#:lt is placed with the addition of  
w fc&#x27;v regulars, dueler the command of Bri­  
gadier tieneral Harrison, who possesses the  
entire confidence of his fellow soldiers, a­  
mbiig whom ai e citizens, si me of them vo­  
lunteers in the ranks, not los distinguished  
l&gt;V,i their political stations, than by their per- |  
soual merits. The greater portion ot this  
force is proceeding on its destination, to­  
wards the Michigan territory, having sue  
ceedcd in relieving an important frontier  
post, and in several.mcidi i.tui operations a  
gainst hostile tribes of savages, rendeied in­  
dispensable by the subset vhucy into which  
they hud been seduced by the euemv ; a se­  
duction the murveruel, as it multi not fail  
to imptise a necessity of precautionary seve­  
rities, against those who yielded to it.  
At a recent date,an attack was made m  
a post of the enemy near Niagara, by a de  
tachment of the regular and other forces,  
under the c nim-nci of major, general Van  
Kenssalear of the militia of the state of N.  
Vork. I&#x27;lie attack,.it appeals, was older  
ed in compliance with the ar&lt;! r of the  
troops who executed it with • distinguished  
gallantry, and weje fra time victorious;  
but not receiving the.expected support, they  
were compelled to yield to reinforcement*  
of British] egulars ajiil savages. Our loss has  
bten - consul* rahle and is deeply to be lamen­  
ted. . 1 hat ol the enemy, less ascertained  
will be the more felt.,-as \u includes among  
the killed the . commanding general, wh*  
was also the (ifivernor of the Pr, vince ;  
was sustained by veteran troops, fr&lt; in un­  
experiem ed soldiers,, who must duly im­  
prove in the diities of the held.  
Our expectation of gaining the command  
ot the lakes, by the invasion of Canada from  
Detroit, having been disappointed, measures  
were instantly taken to provide, on them, a  
naval force Superior to that of the enemy._  
From the talents and activity of tl&#x27;e officer  
charged with this object, every thing that  
can be done may be expected. Should the  
present season not admit of c« mplete sue­  
cass. the pr gress made will ensure for the  
next a naval ascendancy, where it is essen­  
tial to our permanent peace with, and con­  
trol over&gt; the savages.  
  
/vinong »ne incidents to the measures of  
the war, 1 am constrained to advert to the  
refusal of . the Governors of Massachusetts  
and C m/iecticut to furnish the required dr  
tachments of militia towards the defence of  
the maritime frontier. The refusal was  
founded on a novel and unfortunate exposi­  
tion of tlie provisions of the constitution, i ela­  
ting to the militia. The correspondences  
winch will be before you. Contain the re­  
quisite information on the subject. It is  
obvious, that if the authority of the United  
States to call into service and command the  
militia for the public defence, can be thus  
frustrated, even in a state of declared war,  
tSc of course under apprehensions of invasion  
precedi g war, they are not one nation tor  
the purpose most of all requiring it; &amp; that  
the pu die safety may hat e no otiier resource  
than in those large and permanent military  
establishments which are forbidden by the  
principles of &lt;&gt;ur free government, and a­  
gainsi the necessity of winch the militia  
were mea it to be a constitution d bulwark..  
On the coasts, and on the wean, the war  
has been as .&lt;mcc ssf.d as circhtnstances in  
separable from its early stages could pro  
mise.——Our public ships and private  
cruisers, by their activity, and where there  
was occasion, bv their&quot; intrepidity, have  
made the enemy sensible Of lie difference  
between a icuprocity of captures, and the  
long confinement of them to their side. Our  
t adr, with little exception, has safely rea­  
ched our ports ; having been, much favo. i d  
in it bv the course pursued by a squadron of  
our trig ites&gt; under the command of coin  
rnodoie Rodgers. And in the instance, in  
which skill and bravery were more partic  
ularly tried with those of the enemy* the  
American Hag had an auspicious triumph  
Tne tligate Constitution, commanded by  
capt. Hull, after a close and short engage  
ment, completely disabled and captured a  
British frigate ; gaining for that officer and  
all on Itoavd, a praise which cannot be too  
liberally bestowed ; not merely for the vie  
tury actually achieved, but for th it prompt  
and cool exertion of commanding talents,  
which, giving to courage its highest chai ac­  
! ter, ti.mi to the force applied its full ••h&#x27;-.-cr .

I ( Anxious to abridge the evils from whirl)  
a. state of war cannot be exempt, 1 lost no

terms requited, that the orders in u,„i„r,.|  
should he repealed as they att&lt; ct.ed the 1,7ni  
ted ^States without a revival v\ blockidct  
in at ng iC.-cn nvledged rules ; that there  
should he an immednte discharge of Amer­  
ican seamen front British ships ; &amp; a atop to  
impressments from American ships with an  
understanding that an ex lusion of &#x27;he »ea­  
mrn of each n ition from the ships of ihe o  
tiier should he stipuli tc.l : and that the ar­  
mistice? muld be improved into a definitive  
and comprehensive adjustment of depend­  
ing controversies. A ithough a repeal i f the  
orders vjsccplfijle i f explanations mee&#x27;iny  
the views of this government, had t.ikei  
place b&#x27;tfn&quot;^ this pacific, advance was c&lt;&gt;;n­  
m.in,cased to that ot (treat Britain, the ad  
vance was declined, from an avowed fepug  
nance to a suspension of the practice t»J im  
pressment during the armistice, and with  
Cut any intimation that the. arrangement  
  
proposed uith respect to seamen would be  
accepted.  
Whether the subsequent communications  
from this government, affording an occasion  
for re-considering the subject, oh the part «.1  
Great Britain, will be viewed in a more fa­  
vorable light, or received in a more accom­  
modating spirit, remains to he known. It  
would be unwise to relax our ni easui es, in  
any respect, on a presumption ot such a re­  
sult.  
  
| 1 he documents from the Department • f  
State, Which relate to tlm subject, w]Q  
give a view also ot the proposition* for an  
armistice, which have been received here,  
&#x27; one ot them troin the authorities at Halifax  
‘and in Canada, the other from the Britisli  
j government itaeli, through Ad. Warren ; 3t  
of the grounds upon which neither ot them  
could be accepted.  
| Our affairs with France retain the post­  
uie which they hehl at my last communi­  
cations to you. Notwithstanding the au­  
ithorised expectations of an early an well  
|as favorable issue to the discusstou* on foot ;  
these have been procrastinated to ihe lat­  
est date. The only intervening occurrence]  
&#x27;meriting attention, is the promulgation of aj  
&#x27;French decree, purporting to i&gt;e a definitive I  
[repeal of the Berlin and Milan decrees._ j  
1 his proceeding, although made the ground !  
ol tue itpeal of the British orders in coun­  
cil. is rendered, by the tune v* manner of  
it, liable to many objections.  
1 he final communications from our spe­  
cial Minister to Denmark, afford further  
proofs ot the good eflectsul his mission, and  
of the amicauie dhpostion of tlie Danish  
government. From Russia we have the  
satisfaction to receive assurances of con­  
tinued friendship, and that it will not he  
affected by the rupture between the l\ S.  
dt G. B. Sweden also professes sentiments  
favorable to tlie subsisting harmony.  
With the liarhary powers, excepting that  
of Algiers, our affairs remain on tlie ordina­  
ry, fooling. The Consul General residing  
with that Regency, has suddenly, and with*  
out cause, been banisned, together with all  
the American citizens found there. VVne­  
ther this was tiie transitory effect of capri­  
cious despotism, or the first act of pretie  
• eriuined hostility, is not ascertained. Pre­  
c::nli&lt; ns were taken by the Consul on the lat  
ter supposition. .  
1 lie Indian tribes, per under foreign in­  
stigations, remain at peace and receive the  
civilising attentions, which have proved so  
beneficial to them.  
Witn a view to that vigorous prosecuti­  
oh of the war, to which our national facul­  
ties are adequate, the attention ol  
Congress vfriil be particalarly drawn to the  
insufficiency of the existing provisions for  
tilling up the military establishment, buch  
is the happy condition of our country, .ari­  
sing fn m the facility of subsistence and  
the high wages for every species of occu­  
pation, that notwithstanding t tit augmented  
inducements provided at the last session, a  
partial success only has attended the recrui­  
ting service. The deficiency has been ne­  
cessarily supplied during the campaign, by  
other than regular troops, with all the in­  
conveniences and expenses incident to  
them. The remedy lies, in establishing,  
more favorably for the private soldier, the  
proportion between hi* recompense and the  
term of Ids enlistment. And it is a subject  
which cannot too soon or loo seriously” be  
taken irit &gt; consideration.  
  
J lir stime insufficiency h*s l&gt;e«n experienced in  
the provisions fqr volunteers made by an net ol the  
last seas on. Tlie recommence for tiie s rvite requi­  
red in this case, is still less nt tractive than in illt; ,,  
liter. And although patriotism alone lias sent into  
the field some valuable corps of iliat description,  
those alone who can afford the sacrifice, cm rv asoti­  
ahly he expected to yield t&gt;, that impulse*.  
It will merit eonsuleratibu also whether, as auxili­  
ary to the security ol our frontier, corps inn. not he  
advantageously organized, with a restrict on&#x27;of their J  
services to particular districts convenient to them.  
And whether the local and occasional services of  
manners and others in the sety-purt towns, under a  
similar organisation, wnufl not lie a provi ieut addi­  
tion til the means of their defence.  
1 recomu-ml a prnv si m for at) inorexse of the ge­  
neral officers of the army, the deficiency of winch  
lias been illustrated by the unrulier and distance of  
separate commands, which the course of the war  
and the advantage of the service hare required.  
Awl I cannot press too Strongly, outlie earhest  
attention of the 1.*gisiature, the importance of the  
rc-nrgauizutinu of the slafT establishment; witii u  
view to render more distinct and dcfi..ite the relati­  
ons and responsibilities of it4 aeveivl departments.  
Tint there is room for improvements which Kill ma­  
terially promote both economy Mud success, in what  
appertains to the army ami the war, is equally incut*  
oated lij the examples of other countries, and by the  
experience of .»ur own.  
A revision of the militia laws for the ptfv-ose of  
rendering them morn systematic, and hetirr adapt­  
ing them to emergencies of the war, is . I this time  
particularly desirable.  
Of the additional ships authorized to he fitted for  
service, two will be shortly ready to sail; a third ts  
under repair and del iy will he avoided in the repair  
of the residue. Of the appropriations fur the pur­  
chase of materials for ship-building, tin greater part  
has been applied to that object, and the purchases  
will he- continued with the balance.  
The cuterprixing spirit which lifts characterized  
our naval force, and its success both in restraining  
instill a and depredations on our coasts, and in iepri­  
sals dti the enemy, will not fail to recommend an en­  
largement of it.  
  
1 here hems reason to believe that the act pro­  
lilbiting the acceptance of Hiilish licence*, is not «  
sufficient guard against the uac of them for purposes  
favourable1 to the intemts views of tbe enemy ;  
further provisions on that subject are highly impor­  
tant. Nor is it lets go, that pmal enactments should  
lie provided for ease* of corrupt anil perfidious in­  
tercourse with tin: enemy, not amounting to trea­  
son, nor yet embraced hy any statutory provision*.  
A considerable number of American y( ssels,  
which were in England wln n the revocation of the  
orders in conned took place, were &#x27;a-ten with lintisli  
manufactures, under an erroneous impression (but

/&#x27;elloxv Citizens of the Senate and  
House of Re/irescnta fives.  
On our present meeting.it is mv first du­  
ty to invite your attention to the Providential  
favors which our country has experienced,  
in the unusual degree of health dispensed to  
its inhabitants, and in the rich abundance  
■with which the earth has rewarded die la­  
bors bestowed on it. In the successful cultiva­  
tion of other branches of industry, and in  
the progress of general improvement favor­  
able to the national prosperity, there is just  
occasion, also, for our mutual congratulati­  
ons and thankfulness. &#x27;  
Wivh these blessings are necessarily min­  
gled, the pressures and vicissitudes inciden­  
tal to the state of war, into which the United  
States have been forced, by the perseverance  
ot a foreign power, in its system of injustice  
and aggression.  
Previous to its decIaration.it was deemed  
limner, as a meauntv&gt; r*f n...1 r  
  
r • . i • ~ ... •  
cast, that a considerable force should be  
placed in the Michigan territory, with a  
general view to its security, and,’ in the e­  
■vent of war, to such operations in the upper­  
most Canada as would intercept the hostile  
influence of Great Britain over the savages,  
obtain the command of the lake on which  
that part of Can.»Ja borot rs, and maintain  
co-operating relations with such forces as  
might oe most conveniently employed against  
other parts. Brigadier-General&#x27; Hull* was  
charged with this provision d service; ha­  
ving tinder his command a body of thoops  
composed of regulars and of volunteers  
from the htate of Ohio. Having reached his  
destination after his knowledge of the war  
and possessing discresionarv author tv to act  
offensively, lie passed into the neighboring  
territory of the enemy with a prospect r/rn­  
py anti victorious progress. The expedition  
neverthel* ss terminated unfortunately, not  
only in a retreat to the town and fort of De­  
troit, but in the surrender of both, am! of  
the gallant corps commanded by that officer.  
The causes of this painful reverse will bd  
investigated by a military tribunal.  
A distinguishing feature in the operations  
■which preceded and followed this ndicr»e  
event, is the use made by the enemy, oftiie  
merciless savages under their influence_  
Whilst the benevolent policy of the United  
States invariably recommenced peace and  
promoted civilization among that wretched  
portion of the human race : and was making  
exertions to dissuade them from taking either  
side in the war, theenemy lias not scrupled  
to call to Ills aid their ruthless ft rociry, armed  
with the horrors of those instruinentsef c*ar­  
nngc and torture, which are known to spare  
neither age nor sex. In this outrage against  
the laws of honorahlg war, and ugairist the  
feelings sacred to humanity, tne British com­  
mand! rs cannot resort to a plea of retalia­  
tion : for it is committed in the face of our  
example. They cannot mitigate it, by cal­  
  
.v.. &lt;-v.il uvicuvc against men hi arms:  
for it embraces the most shocking butche­  
ries of defenceless families. Nor can it he  
pretended that they are not answerable for  
the atrocities perpetrated ; since the sava­  
ges arc employed with a knowledge and e­  
ven with menaces, that their fury could not  
be controlled finch is the spectacle which  
the deputed authorities of n nation, boast­  
ing its religion and morality; have not  
been restrained! from presenting to an en­  
lightened age.  
Th’ misfortune at Detroit w*s not howe­  
ver, without a consoling effect. It was fol­  
lowed by signal proofs, that the national  
pp : t rises according to the pressure on it.  
The loss of an important post, and of the  
brave men surrendered with it, inspired ev­  
ery where new ardor and determination. In  
the states and districts least remote, it was  
no sooner known, than every citizen was rea­  
dy to fly with Ids arms, at once to protect  
his brethren against the bloofMlursty savages  
Jet loose by the enemy on an extensive frontier  
and toconvert a partial calamity intoa sourre  
of invigorated efforts. This patriotic zeal,  
v/hich it was necessary rather to limit thuti  
excite, has embodied an ample force from  
the states of Kentucky and Ohio, and from  
parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is  
placed, with the addition of a few regulars  
*inder the command of brigadier general  
Harrison ; who possesses the entire confi- 1  
deuce of his fellow soldiers, among whom  
nre citizens, some of them volunteers in the  
ranks, not less distinguished by their pnliti 1  
C:i stations, than by their personal merits.  
I he great&#x27; r portion of this &#x27;.osec. is procte- ^  
  
ding on its destination, towards the Michi­  
gan territory, having succeeded in relieving  
an important frontier post, and in 6ever.il  
incidental operations against hostile tribes  
of savages, rendered indispensable by the  
subserviency into which they had been sedu­  
ced by the enemy, a seduction the morecruel  
as it could not tail to impose a necessity of  
precautionary severities, against those who  
yielded to it.  
At a recent dale, an attack was made on  
a post of the enemy near Niagara, by a de­  
tachment of the regular and other f,irccs un­  
der the command of maj.gen. Van Renssalaer  
of the militia of the state of N. V. The at­  
tack, it appears, vvasordered in compliance  
with tlie ardor of the troops, who executed  
it with distinguished gallantry, and were for  
a time victorious ; hut not receiving the ex­  
pected support, they were compelled to  
yield to reinforcements of British regulars  
and savages. Our loss has been considera­  
ble and is deeply to be lamented. That of  
the enemy, less ascertained, will be the more  
felt, as it includes among the killed, the  
commanding general, who was also the Cio­  
vernor of the province ; and was sustained  
by veteran troops, from unexperienced s 1­  
dn-rs, who must daily improve in the duties  
of the field.  
Our expectation of gaining the command  
of the lakes, by tin* invasion of Canada from  
Detroit, hav tig been disappointed, measures  
were instantly taken in provide on them a  
naval f-.rce superior to riist of the enemv_  
  
*.- “&#x27;&quot;i ■&gt;&#x27; -m;y or me onicer  
charged with thi* object, e very tiling that  
can be done, may lie expected. Should the  
present season not ad.nit of complete success,  
tlic progress made will ensure for the next  
a naval ascendancy, where it is essential to  
our permanent peace with, and control over  
the savages.  
t Among the incidents to the measures of  
the war, I am constrained to advert to the  
relnsal ot the Cbiveinors of Massachusetts  
and Connecticut, to furnish. the required de­  
tachments of militia towards the defence of  
tiie maritime frontier. The refusal was foun­  
ded on a novel and unfortunate exposition of  
the proviauns of tiie constitution relating to  
the militia. The correspondences which  
will 1).* before yon. contain the requisite in­  
formation on the subject. It is obvious, that  
d t ie authority of the United States to call  
into service and command the militia for the  
public defence, c m be thus frustrated, even  
in a state of declared war, and of course un­  
de apprehensions of invasion preceding war  
—thee are not one nation for the purpose  
most of all requiring it; and that the pub  
nr safety may have no other resource, ihan  
r.; &#x27;.hose large and permanent military csta  
I h-ments which are forbidden by the prin­  
cipi&lt; s of our free government, and against  
the necessity of which the miiitiu were meant  
to be a constitutional bulwark.  
On the coa-r, and cn the ocean, the war  
has been as successlul as circumstances in­  
separable from it it early stages cotiltl pro  
mise. Our publib ship* awl private cruisers  
bv their activity, and- where there was oc­  
casion, by their iiiirupwlhv, have made the  
enemy sensible of the difference between a  
reciprocity ol captures, and the long con­  
finement of them to their side. Our trade,  
with little exception, has safely readied our  
ports; having been much favol-ed in it by  
the course pursued by a squadron of our fri­  
gates, under the command of commodore  
Hodge rs. And in the instance in which skill  
and bravery were more particularly tried  
witil those- of thf PilVmt* fho A n  
  
h.ifl an auspicious triumph. The frigate  
Constitution, commanded by capt. Hull, af­  
ter a close and short engagement, complete­  
ly disabled and captured a British frigate •  
gaining for that officer and all on board a  
p**aise which cannot be too liberally bestow­  
ed; not merely for the victory actually a­  
chieved, but for that prompt and co&lt; l exer­  
tion of commanding talents, which, giving to  
courage its highest character, and to the  
force applied its full effect, proved that more  
could hate been done in a contest reriuirintr  
mere. &amp;  
Anxious to abridge the evils from which  
a st tc of war cannot he exempt, I lost ik&gt;  
time, lifter it was declared, in conveying to  
the British government the terms on which  
its progress might be arrested, without awai­  
ting the delays of a formal and final pacifi­  
cation. And our charge d’affairs at London  
was, nt the same time, authorised to agree  
to an armistice founded upon them. These  
terms required that the orders in council  
should lie repealed as they affected ti c Uni  
ted btates, without a revival of blockades  
violating acknowledged rules ; that there  
should be an immediate discftarge of Ame­  
rican seamen from British ships, and a stop  
to impressments from American ships, with  
an understanding that an exclusion of the  
seamen of each nation fn&gt;m the ships of the  
ot her, should he stipulated ; and that the ar­  
mistice should be improved into a definitive  
ami compre hensive adjustment of depending  
controversies. Although a repeal of the or­  
ders suRcepubie of explanations meeting the i  
  
views of this government, had tal^Bfece  
before tins pacific advance was communica­  
ted to that ot Great Britain, the advance was  
declined, from an avowed repugnance to a  
suspension of the practice of impressment,  
during the armistice, and without any inti  
mation that the arrangement proposed with  
respect to seamen would he accepted. Whe­  
ther the subsequent communications from  
this government, affording an occasion for re­  
considering the subject, outlie part of Great  
Britain, will he viewed in a more favorable  
light, or received in a more accommodating  
spirit, remains to be known. It would be  
unwise torelax our measures, in any respect,  
on a presumption of such a result.  
The documents from the Department of  
State, which relate to this subject, will give  
a view also of the propositions for an armis­  
tice, which ha&#x27;e been received here, one of  
them from the authorities at Halifax and in  
Canada, the other from the British govern­  
ment itself, through admiral Warren ; and of  
the grounds upon which neither of them  
could be accepted.  
. Dur affairs with France retain the posture  
whii h they hold at my last communications  
to you. Not withstanding the authorised ex­  
pectation of an early as well as favorable is­  
sue to the discussions on toot, these have  
been procrastinated to the latest date. The  
only intervening occurrence meriting atten  
11oi 1. ia the promulgation &lt;•{ a Frqnch decree,  
purporting to be a definitive repeal of the  
Berlin Sc IVliiau decrees. , his proceeding.

the British orders i:i council, is rendered, l&gt;y  
the time and manner of it, liable to many ob­  
jections.  
The final comrmini.-.ntions from our spe­  
cial Minister to Denmark, afford further  
proofs of the goo: efvects of his nrissim, and  
of the amicable, disposition ot the Danish  
government. From Russia we have the sa­  
tisfaction to receive av-aranc.es of continued  
friendship, and tiia- ir - i!! not he airected !&gt;v  
the rupture between tue United States an-J  
(»reat Britain. Sweden also professes sen­  
timt nts favorable to the subsisting harmony.  
With the.Barbarv powers, excepting that  
of Algiers, our all&#x27;airs remain on the ordinary  
footing. 1 he Consul C-tentra!, residing iv jth  
that Regency, lias suddenly and without  
cause been banished, together with all the  
American citizens found there. Whether  
this was the transit.irv effect of capricious  
despotism, or the first act of predetermined  
hostility, is not ascertained. Precautions  
were taken by the Consul, on the latter  
supposition.  
•!,c Indian tribes, not under foreign in­  
stigations, remain at peace,and receive the  
civilizing attentions, which have proved so  
beneficial to them.  
With a view to that vigorous pr*secuti­  
nn of the war, to which our national facul­  
ties are adequate, tile attention of Congress  
will la-particularly drawn to the iiisulTicieii­  
cy of the existing provision- for filling up the  
military establishment. Such is the happy  
c mdiiion of our country, arising from the fa­  
cility &lt;■{ subsistence and the high v.nges f,-r  
every species &lt; f occupation, that notwith­  
standing the augmented inducements provi­  
ded at liu: iast session, a partial success only  
has attended the recruiting service. The  
deficiency has been necessarily .supplied, tin­  
ring the cj*. npuign. by other than regular  
troops vi.li all the inconveniences a fid ?x­  
pfences incident to them. The remedy tics  
in establishing, more favorably for the pri -  
vate soldier, the proportion between his re­  
compence and the term of his enlistment —  
  
aiui it is a subject which cannot too soon or  
too seriously be taken into Consideratiou,  
The same insufficiency has been, experi­  
enced in the provisions for volunteers made  
by an act ot the late session. The recoin*  
pence for the sen ice required in this case  
is still less attractive tlum in the other. And  
although patriotism alone has sent into the  
field some valuable corpHot lliat description,  
those alone who can afford die sacrifice, can  
reasonably be expected to yield to that’ im­  
pulse.  
It will merit consideration also, whether  
as auxiliary to the security, of our frontier,’  
corps may not be advantageously organized&#x27;,  
with a restriction of their services to parti­  
lar districts convenient to them. And whe  
ther the local and occasional services of ma­  
riners ami others in the sea-port towns, un­  
der a similar organization, would not be a  
provident addition to the means of their de­  
fence.  
I recommend a provision for an increase  
of rlu; general officers of the army. the dehrj_  
enev of which has been illustrated by the  
number and distance of separate commands  
which the course of the war and the advan­  
tage ot the service have required.  
And 1 cannot press too strongly on the  
earliest attention of the Legislature the im­  
portance of the re-o&#x27;gnnizHtion of t|ie staff  
establishment; with a view to render more  
(jJKtuicl rind definite the relation* and rcK« \
portabilities ot its several departments. That |  
there is room for improvements which will  
materially promote both economy ami suc^  
U  
  
cess, in wlint Appertains to tlie army and,  
th6 war, is equally inculcated by the e xam­  
ples of other countries and by the experience  
of our own.  
A revision (,f the militia laws for the pur­  
pose of rendering them more systematic, and.  
better adapting them to emergencies of the  
war, is at this time particularly desirable.  
additional ships luuli&#x27;iriscil to be  
fitted fur service, two will be shortly ready  
to sail ; a third is under repair ; anil delay&quot;  
\vill be avoided in the repair of the residue.  
Of the appropriations for the purchase ot  
m teviais !&lt;&gt;r ship-building, the greater part;  
has been applied to Hint object, and the pur­  
chases will be continued with the balance.  
rhe enterprising spirit which has charact­  
erized our naval force, and its success botlt  
in i outlining insults and depredations on our  
coasts, and m reprisals oil the enemy, will  
not fail to recommend an enlargement ot it*  
There being reason to believe that the act  
prohibiting the acceptance of British licences,  
is not a sufficient guard against the use of them  
foi purposes favorable to the interests ft views  
ol the enemy ; further provisions on that sub*  
ject are highly important Nor is it less so,  
that penal enactments should be provided for  
cases of corrupt an&lt;l perfidious intercourse  
with the enemy, not amounting to treason, nop  
yet embraced by any statutory provisions  
A considerable number of American vessels,  
which were in England when the revocation of  
the orders in council took place, were laden  
with British manufactures, under an errone­  
ous iimiressini, fl... _  
  
would immediately cease to operate, and have  
arrived in the U. Mates. It did not appear  
proper to exercise, on unforeseen cases ol such  
magnitude, the ordinary powers vested in the  
treasury department to mitigate forfeitures,,  
without ; cviously affording to Congress an  
opportunity ot making on (lie suhjret such pro*  
Vision as they may think proper. In their de­  
cision they will doubtless cquatfy consult what,  
is &#x27; IK* to equitable considerations and to the  
public interest.  
The receipts into the treasury, during the  
y&#x27;hi* ending &gt;.n the 30tl. of September last,  
have exceeded sixteen millions ;.nd a half of  
dollars; which have been sufficient todetiav  
nil the demands «»n the treasury to that day, in­  
cluding a ticces.y.iry reimbursement of near  
three millions of the principal «.f the pu dic  
ilehi. In these receipts is included a sum of  
ifear 55,850.000 received on account ol llie  
lo ins authorised by the actsol the last sessi. ti:  
tlte whole sunt actually obtained on loan a­

in animating considerations, of which thev.vw

J &#x27; ’tuple. Willi more than one nation, wo

“* Anxious to abridge the evils from which a state  
of war cannot be exempt, I lost no time after it was  
declared in conveying to the British Government the  
terms on which its progress might be arrested, with-  
out awaiting the delays of aformal and final pacifica-  
tion. And our Charge d’Affaires at London was, at the  
same time authorized to agree to an armistice founded  
upon them. These terms required, that the orders in  
council should be repealed as they effected the United  
States, without 4 revival of blockades violating acknow-  
jledged rules—that there should be an immediate dis-  
charge of American seamen from British ships ; and  
a stop to impressments from American ships, with an  
understanding that an exclusion of the seamen of each  
nation from the ships of the other should be stipula-  
ted ; and that the armistice should be improved into  
a definitive and comprehensive adjustment of depend-  
ing contr oversies—Although a repeal of the orders  
susceptible of explanations meeting the views of this  
government, had taken place before this pacific ad-  
vance was communicated to that of Great Britain, the  
advance was declined, from an avowed repugnance to  
a suspension of the practice of impressment during the  
armistice, and without any itimation that the arrange-  
ment proposed with respect to seamen would be ac-  
cepted. Whether the subsequent communications from  
this government, affording an occasion for reconsider-  
ing the subject, on the part of Great Britain, will be  
viewed in a more favorable light, or received ih a more  
accommodating spirit, remains to be known, It would  
be unwise to relax our measures, in aby respect, on a  
presumption of such a result.  
  
** The documents from the Departments of State,  
  
which relate to this subject, will give a view also of  
  
the propositions for an armistice, which have been  
received here, one of them from the authorities at Hali-  
fax and in&#x27;Canada, the otherfrom the British govern-  
ment itself, through Admiral Warren; and of the  
grounds upon which neither of them could be ac-  
cepted.  
  
** Our affairs with France retain the posture which  
they held at my last communications to you, Not-  
withstanding the authorised expectation of an carly as  
well as favorable issue to the discussions on foot—  
these have been procrastinated to the latest date. The  
only intervening occurrence meriting attention, is the  
one ofa French Decree purporting to be a  
  
efinitive repeal of the Berlinand Milan decrees. This  
proceeding, although made the ground of the repeal  
of the British Orders in Council, is rendered, by  
the time and manner of it, liable to many ob-  
jections.  
  
** ‘The final communications from our special min-  
ister to Denmark, afford further proofs of the good  
cffects of his mission, and of the amicable disposition  
of the Danish government.. From Russia we have the  
satisfaction to receive assurances of continued friend  
ship, and that it will not be effected by the rupture be-  
tween the United States and Great-Britain. Sweden  
also professes sentiments favorable to the subsisting  
harmony.  
  
** With the Barbary powers, excepting that of Al-  
giers, our affairs remain on the ordinary footing. The  
Consul-General residing with that Regency, bas sud-  
denly, and without cause, been banished, together  
with all the American citizens found there. Whether  
this was the transitory effect of capricious despotism,  
or the first act of pfeitetersniped hostility, is not ascer-  
tained. Precautions were taken by the Consul, on the  
latter supposition. ~  
  
** The Indian tribes not under foreign instigations,  
remain at peace, and receive the civilizing attentions,  
which have proyed so beneficial to them.

Fellaw-citizens of the Senate  
and House of Representatives,  
  
_ Qn our present meeting it is my first duty to in-  
vite your attention to the Providential favors which  
our country has experienced, in the unusual degree  
of health dispensed to its inhabitants, and in the rich  
abundance with which the earth has rewarded the  
Jabors bestowed on it, In the successful cultivation  
of other branclies of industry, and in the progress of  
  
eneral improvement, favorable to the national pros-  
arity, there is just occasion, also, for our mutual  
congratulations and thankfulness,  
  
With these blessings are necessarily mingled the  
pressures and vicissitudes incidental to the state of!  
  
by the perseverance of a foreign power, in its sys-  
tem of injustice and aggression.  
  
Previous to its declaration, it was deemed proper,  
as a measure of precaution and forecast, that a con-  
siderable force should be placed in the Michigan  
territory, with a general view to its security, and in  
the event of war, to such operations in the upper-  
most Canada, as would intercept the hostile influ-  
ence of Great Britain over the savages, obtain the  
command of the luke on which that part of Canada  
borders,and maintain co-operating relation with such  
forces as might be most conveniently employed  
against other parts.-——Brigadier-general Hull was  
charged with this provisional service ; having under  
his command a body of troops, composed of regu-  
lars, and of volunteers from the state of Ohio. Having  
reached his destination after his knowledge of the  
war, and possessing discretionary authority to act  
offensiyely, he passed into the neighboring territory  
of the énemy, with a prospect of easy and victorious  
progress. The expedition, nevertheless, terminated  
unfortunately, not only ina retreat to the town and  
fort of Detroit, but in the surrender of both, and of  
the gallant corps commanded by that officer. ‘The  
causes of this painful reverse will be imvestigated  
by a military tribunal.  
  
A distinguishing feature in the operations which  
preceded and followed this adverse event, is the use  
thade by the enemy of the merciless savages under  
their influence. Whilst the benevolent policy of the  
United States invariably recommended peace, and  
promoted civilization among that wretched portion  
of the human race; and was making exertions to  
dissuade them from taking either side in the war, the  
enemy has not scrupled to call to his aid their ruth-  
less ferocity, armed with the horrors of those instru-  
ments of carnage and torture, which are known to  
spare neither age nor sex. In this outrage against  
the laws of honorable war, and against the feelings  
sacred to humanity, the British commanders cannot  
resort toa plea of retaliation : for it is committed in  
the face of our example. They cannot mitigate it  
by calling it aself defence against men in arms: for  
it embraces the most shocking butcheries of defence-  
less families. Nor can it be pretended that they are  
not answerable for the atrocities perpetrated ; since  
the savages are employed witha knowledge, and  
even with menaces, that their fury could not be con-  
trouled. Such is the spectacle which the deputed  
authorities of a nation, boasting its religion and m o-  
rality, have not been restrained from presenting to  
an enlightened age.  
  
The misfortune at Detroit, was not,however, with-  
owt a consoling effect. It was followed by signal  
proofs that the national spirit rises according to the  
pressure on it. The loss of an important post and of  
the brave men surrendered with it, inspired every  
where, new ardor and determination. In the states  
and districts Jeast remote, it was no seoner Known,  
than every citizen was ready to fly with his arms, at  
once to protect his brethren against the blood thirs-  
ty savages let loose by the enemy on an extensive  
‘frontier, and to convert. a partial calamity into a  
source of invigorated efforts. This patriotic zeal,  
which it was necessary rather to limit than excite,  
has embadied an ample force from the states of Ken-  
tucky and Ohio, and from parts of Pennsylvania and  
Virginia. It is placed, with the addition of a few  
regulars, under the command of brigadier-general  
Harrison, who possesses the entire confidence of his  
fellow-soldiers, among whom are citizens, some of  
them volunteers in the ranks, not less distinguished  
by their political stations, than by their personal me-  
rits. The greater portion of this force is proceeding

having succeeded in relieving an important frontier  
post, and in several incidental operat.ons against hos-  
tile tribes of savages, rendered indispensable by the  
strbserviency into which they had been seduced by  
the enemy ; a seduction the more cruel as it could  
not fail to impose a necessity of precautionary seve-  
rities, against those who yielded to it.  
  
At a recent date, an attuck was made ona post of  
the enemy near Niagara, by a detachment of the re-  
gular and other forces, under the command of ma-  
Jjor-general Van Remnsselaer, of the militia of the  
state of New-York. The attack, it appears, Was or-  
dered in compliance with the ardor of the troops,  
who executed it with distinguished gallantry, and  
were, for a time victorious ; but ‘not receiving the  
expected support, they were compelled to yield to  
reinforcements of British regulars and savages. Our  
loss has becn considerable and is deeply to be 1a-  
mented. That of the’ enemy, less ascertained, will  
be the more felt, as it includes, amongst the killed,  
the commanding general, who was also the governor  
of the province ; and was sustained by veteran troops,  
from unexperienced soldiers, who must daily im-  
prove in the duties of the field.  
  
Our expectations of gaining the command of the  
lakes by the invasion of Canada from Detroit, having  
been disappointed, measures were instantly taken to  
provide, on them, a naval force superior to that of the  
enemy. From the talents and activity of the officer

which, giving to courage its highest character, and  
to the force applied, its full effect, prove that niore  
could have been done, in a contest requiring more.  
Anxious to abridge the cvils from which 3 state of  
war cannot be exempt, I lost no time after it was de-  
clared, in conveying to the British government, the  
terms on which ifs progtess might be arrested, with-  
out awaiting the delays of a formal and final pac fi-  
cation.. And our charge d&#x27;affaires at London, was,  
at the same titne, authorised to agree to an armistice  
founded upon them. These terms required, that the  
orders in council should be repealed as they affected  
the United States,withott a revival of blockades vio-  
lating acknowledged rules; that there should be «n  
inmediate discharge 6f American seanten from Pri-

ships, With an understanding that an exclusion of  
the seamen of each nation, fiom the ships of the  
other, should be stipulated ; and that the armistice  
should be improved into a definitive and comprehen-  
sive adjustment of depending controversies.  Altho’  
a repeal of the orders, susceptible of explanations  
mecting the views of this government, had taken  
place before this pacific advance had heen commun:-

charged with this object,everything that can be done,  
maybe expected. Should the present season not admit  
of complete success, the progress made will insure  
for the next, a naval ascendancy, where it is essential  
to our permanent peace, and control over, the sa-  
vages.  
  
Among the incidents to the measures of the war,  
fam constrained to advert to the refusal of the go-  
vernors of Massachusetts and Connecticut, to furnish  
the required detachments of militia towards the de-  
fence of the maritime frontier ——The refusal was  
founded on a novel and unfortunate exposition of the  
provisions of the constitution, relating to the militia.  
The correspondences which will be laid before you,  
contain the requisite information on the subject. It  
is obvious, that if the authority of the United States  
to call into service and command the militia for the  
public defence, can be thus frustrated,even in a state  
of declared war, and of course under apprehensions  
of invasion preceding war, they are not one nation  
for the purpose most of all requiring it ; and that the  
public safety may have no other resource than in  
those large and permanent military establishments  
which are forbidden by the principte of our free go-  
vernment, and against the necessity of which the mi-  
litia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark.  
  
On the coasts, on the ocean, the war has been as  
successful as circumstances inseparable from its ear-  
ly stages could promise. Our public ships and pri-  
  
ate cruisers, by their activity, and where there was  
oceasion, by their intrepidity, have made the ene-  
my sensible of the difference between a reciprocity  
of captutes, and the long confinement of them to  
their side. Our trade, with little excep-  
tion, has safcly reached our ports; having been  
much favored in it, by the course pui&#x27;stied by a  
“squadron of our frigates under the command of com-  
‘modore Rodgers.  
skill and bravery were more particularly tried with  
those of the enemy, the Amcrican flag had an aus-  
picious triumph. The frigate Constitution, com-  
manded by captain Hull, after a close and short en-  
‘agement, completely disabled and captured a Bri-  
‘tish frigate ; gaining for that officer and all on board,  
a praise which cannot be too liberally bestowed ; not  
merely for the victory actuallyachieved, but for

Whether the subsequent communications from this  
  
government affording an occasion for re-considering  
the subject, on the part of G. Britain, will be viewed  
in amore favorable light,or received in amore accom-  
modating spirit, remains to be known. Tt would he  
unwise to relak our measures, in any respect, on a  
presumption of such aresult.  
  
The documents from the department of state; which  
relate to this subject, will give a view also of the  
propositions for an armistice which have been reteiv-  
ed here, one of them from the authorities’ at Halifax  
and in Canada, the other from the British govern  
ment itself, through admiral Warren ; and of the  
grounds upon which neither of them could be ae-  
cepted. : ms  
  
Our affairs with France tetain the posture which  
they held at my last communications to you. ‘ “‘Not-  
withstanding the authorised expectation of an early  
as Well as favorable issue to the discussions on, foot ;  
these have been procrastinated to the latest date —  
The only intervening occurrence meriting attention,  
is the promulgation of a French decree, purporting  
to be a definitive repeal of the Berlin and Milan de-  
crees. This proceeding, altho’ made the ground of  
the repeal of the British orders in council, is ren-  
dered, by the time and manner of it, liable to many  
objections.  
  
The final communications from our special minis-  
ter to Denmark, afford further proofs of the good ef-  
fects of his mission, and of the amicable disposition  
of the Danish ‘government.’ From Russia we have the  
satisfaction to receive asstirances of continued friend.  
ship, and that it will not be affected by the rupture  
between the U. States and G. Britain. Sweden also  
professés sentiments favorable to the subsisting har-  
mony.  
  
With the Barbary powers, excepting that of Al-  
siers, our affairs remain on the ordinary footing —  
The consul-general residing with that regency, has  
suddenly, and withont catise been banished, together  
With all the American citizens found there. &quot;Whe-  
ther this was the transitory effect of capricious des-  
potism, or the first act of pre-determined hostility,  
isnot ascertained. Precautions were taken by the

The Indian tribes, not, under foreign instigations,  
rein. at peace, and receive the civilising rttentions,  
which have proved so beneficial to them.  
  
With a view to ‘that vigorous prosecution of the  
war, to which our national faculties are adequate,the  
attenuon of congress will be particularly drawn to  
the insuficiency of the existing provisions for filling  
up the existing establishment. Such is the happy  
condition of our country, arising from the facility of  
subsisteace and the high wages for every species of  
occupation, that notwithstanding the augmented in-  
ducementis provided at the last session, a partial suc-  
cess only has attended the recruiting service. The  
deficiency has been necessarily supplied during the  
campaign, by other than regular troops, with all the  
ingouyeniencies and expences incident to them. The  
remedy Jies in establishing more favorably for the  
private soldier the proportion between his recom-  
pense and the term of his enlistment. And it is a  
subject which cannot too soon or too seriously be ta-  
ken inte consideration.  
  
The same insufficiency has been experienced in  
  
he provisions for volunteers made by an act of the  
lust)session. The recompense for the service requir-  
ec in this case, is still less attractive than in the  
other. And aliho’ patriotism alone has sent mto the  
fieid some valuable corps of that description, those  
alone who can afford the sacrifice can reasonably be  
expected tg yield to that impulse.  
  
t will merit consideration also, whether, as auxil-  
jary to the security of our frontier, corps may not  
be advantageously organized, with a restriction of  
their services to particular districts convenient to  
them. And whether the local and occasional servi-  
ces of mariners and others in the seaport towns, un-  
der a similar organization, would not be a provident  
addition to the means of their defence.  
  
1 recommend a proyision for an increase of the  
geneval officers of the army, the deficiency of which  
bas been illustrated by the number and distance of se-  
parate commands, which the course of the war and  
the advantage of the service have required.  
  
And I cannot press too strongly on the earliest at-  
tention of the legislature, the importance of the  
staff establishment ; with a view to render more dis-  
tinct and definite the relations and responsibilities of  
its several departments, That there 1s room for im-  
provements which will materially promote both eco-  
nomv and success, in what appertains to the army  
and the war, is equally inculcated by the examples  
of other countries, and by the experience of our  
Owl.  
  
A revision of the militia laws for the purpose of  
rendering them more systematic, and. better adapt-  
jng them to emergencies of the war, is at this time  
  
ariicularly desirable,  
  
Of the additional ships authorised to be fitted for  
service, two will be shortly ready to sail; a third is  
under repair, and delay will be avoided in the repair  
of the residue, Of the appropriations for the pur-  
chase of materials for ship building, the greater part  
has heen applied to that object, and the purchases  
wi!l be continued with the balance,  
  
The enterprising spirit which has characterized  
our naval force, and its success both in restraming  
insults and depredations on our coasts, and in repri-  
gals on the enemy, will not fail to recommend an en-  
Jargement of jt.  
  
There being reason to believe that the act prohibit-  
ing the aeceptance of British licences, is not a suffi-  
cient guard agajyst the use of them for purposes fa-  
yorable to the interests and views of the enemy ;  
farther provisions on that subject are highly impor-  
tant, Nor is it Jess so, that penal enactments should  
  
tercourse of the enemy not amounting to treason, not  
  
yet embraced by any statutory provisions.  
  
A considerable number of American vessels, which  
were in England when the revocation of the orders  
in council took place, were laden with British manu-  
factures, under an erroneous impression that the non-  
importation act would immediately cease to operate,  
and have arrived in the United States. It did not  
appear proper to exercise, on unforseen cases of such  
magnitude, the ordinary powers vested in the trea-  
sury department to mitigate forfeitures, without pre-  
viously affording to congress an opportunity of mak-  
ing on the subject such provision as they may think  
proper. In their decision they will doubtless equally  
consult what is due to equitable considerations and  
to the public interest.  
  
The receipts into the treasury, during the year  
ending on the 30th of September last, have exceeded  
sixteen millions and a half of dollars : which have  
been sufficient to defray all the demands of the trea-  
sury to that day, including a necessary reimburse-  
ment of near three millions of the principal of the  
public debt. In these receipts is included a sum of  
near $5,850,000, received on account of the loans  
authorised by the acts of last session: the whole sum  
actually obtained on loan amounts to eleven millions.  
of dollars, the residue of which, being receivable  
subsequent to the 30th September last, will, toge-  
ther with the current revenue, enable us to defray  
all the expenses of this year.  
  
The duties on the late unexpected importations of  
British manufactures, will render the revenue of the  
ensuing year more productive than could have been  
anticipated.  
  
The situation of our country, fellow citizens, is  
not without its difficulties ; though it abounds in  
nee considerations, of which the view here  
presented of our pecuniary resources is an example.  
With more than one natjon, we have serious and  
unsettled controversies ; and with one, powerful in  
the means and habits of war, we are at war.  
The spirit and strength of this nation are neverthe-  
less equal to the support of all its rights, and to car-  
ry it through all its trials. They can be met in that  
confidence. Above all, we have the inestimable con-  
solation of knowing, that the war in which we ate  
actually engaged is a war neither of ambition nor of  
vain glory; that it is waged, not in violation of the  
rights of others, but in the maintenance of our own ;  
that it was preceded by a patience without example,  
under wrongs accumulating without end; and that  
it was finally not declared until every hope of avert-  
ing it was extinguished, by the transfer of the Bri-  
tish sceptre into new hands clinging to former coun-  
cils; and until declarations were reiterated to the  
last hour, through the British envoy here, that the  
hostile edicts against our commercial rights and our  
maritime independence would not be revoked ; nay,  
that they could not be revoked, without violating  
the obligations of Great Britain to other powers, as  
well as to her own interests. To have shrunk, un-  
der such circumstances, from manly resistance,  
would have been a degradation blasting our best and  
proudest hopes: it would have struck us fromthe  
high rank, where the virtuous struggles of our fa-  
thers had placed us, and have betrayed the magnifi-  
cent legacy which we hold in trust for future gene-  
rations. It would have acknowledged, that on the  
element, which forms three-fourths of the globe we  
inhabit, and where all independent nations have  
equal and common rights, the American people were  
not an independent people, but colonists and vassals,  
It was at this moment, and with such an alternative,  
that war was chosen. ‘The nation felt the necessity

^*•&quot;5 the incidents toth* ntiiaret it the  
• *B eonstr&amp;iued to advert to the refusal of  
the governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut,  
to furnish the required detachments of toiilitiato­  
&#x27;wards the defetoee of the maritime frontier. The  
refusal was founded on a hovel and unfortunate  
exposition of the provisions of the constitution,  
relating to the militia. - The correspondencies  
! which will be laid before you, contain the requisite  
information on the subject. It is obvious, &#x27;that  
if the authority of the United States to eall into  
service and command the militia for the public  
rfafeuce, can be thus frustrated, even in a state  
ol declared war, and of course under apprehensi­  
ons of invasion preceding war, they are not one  
nation for the pu impose most of all requiring it;  
and that the public safety may have too other re­  
source, than in those large and-permanent mili­  
tary establishments which are forbidden by the  
principles of our free government, and against  
the necessity of which the militia were meaut to  
be a constitutional bulwark.  
On the eoasts, and oh tile ocean, the -war has  
been as successful as circumstances inseparable  
from its early stages could promise. Our pub.  
lie ships and private cruisers,&#x27;by their activity,  
nud, where .there was occasion, by their intrepi­  
dity, have made the enemy sensible of the differ­  
ence between a reciprocity of captures and the  
lone confinement of them to. &#x27;their side.&#x27; Our  
trade, with little exception, ha? safely reach­  
•i Ml 1 having been much favored, in  
I it by the course pursued by a squadron of our  
i frigates, under the command of Com. Rodgers.  
I And in the instance, iu which skill and bravery  
: were more particularly tried with those of the  
j enemy, the American, flag, had an auspicious tri­  
i umph. • The frigate Constitution, commanded  
  
ujr unpu nun, alter a close and short engage­  
ment, completely disabled and captnrdd a Bri­  
tish frigate; gaining for that officer and all on  
j board a praise which canttot be too liberally be­  
j stowed ; not merely for the victory actually a­  
cfyeved, but for that prompt and cool exertion  
or commanding talents, which, giving to courage  
.its highest character, and to the force applied  
its full effect, proved that more could have been  
done in a contest requiring more­  
Anxious to abridge the evils from which a  
sUto of war cannot be exempt, I lost no time  
alter it was declared in conveying to the British  
government the terms on whicli its progress  
might be arrested, without awaiting the delays  
u a *orma^ ®nal Pacification. And oar  
charge d’affaires at London was, at the same  
time, authorised to agree to an armistice found­  
ed upon them. These terms required, that the  
orders m council should be repealed as they af­  
fected the United States, without a revival of  
bioekades violating acknowledged rules;• that  
there should bean immediate discharge of Ame­  
rican seamen from British ships; and a stop to  
.impressments from American ships, with an un­  
derstanding that ah exclusion of the seamen of  
each nation from the ships of the other should be  
stipulated; and that the armistice should be im­  
proved into a definitive and comprehensive ad­  
justment of depending controversies. Although  
A repeal of the orders susceptible of explaua­  
tious meeting th.e views of this government, had  
taken plaeebefore this pacific auvanpe was com­  
municated to that of Great Britain, the kdvance  
was declined, from an avowed repngnanee to a  
.suspension of. the practice of impressment du­  
rmg the armistice, and without any intimation  
that the arrangement proposed with respect to  
seamen would be accepted. Whether the sub­

deficiency has been. neeesarily supplied during  
the campaign, by other than regular 4r«*ps, with  
all the inconveniences mod cipentu&#x27; incident to  
.theta, The remedy lies, inest&amp;blishing, more  
favorably for the private soldier, the&#x27;prbport i on  
between his recompense and tire term of hiseli4*  
listment. And it is a subject w hich cannot too  
soon or too sersiously be taken into- considera­  
tion.  
The same insufficiency has-been&#x27; experienced  
in the provisions for volunteers made by an act  
of the last session.The recompense for the service  
required in this case, isless still attractive than in.&quot;  
the other. And although patriotism alone has  
sent into the held some valuable corps of that  
description, those alone who can afford the sacrir  
fice, ean be expected to yield co that impulse.  
It will merit consideration also whether, as;  
auxiliary to the security of our frontier, corps J  
may not be advantageously organized, with a  
restriction of .their services to particular districts  
convenient to them. And whether,the local  
and occasional services of mariners and others in  
the sea-port towns, under a similar organization,  
would, not he a provident addition to the means  
of their defence.­  
I recommend a provision for an irfrrease of  
the general officers of the army, the deficiency  
of which hks‘ been illustrated l&gt;y the number and  
distance of separate commands, which the course  
ofthe war and the advantage of the service have­  
required. /  
And I cannot&#x27; press too str»rgly on the cailicst  
attention of the Legislature the imp •rtanre of the  
re-organization of the staff establishment; &#x27;with a  
view to render more distinct and definitive the gela­  
tions and responsibilities of its several departments.  
I hat there is room for improvements&#x27;which wilj

• A, considerable -number of American vessels,  
which were in England when the revocation of the  
orders in council took place, were laden with Bn­  
tish manufactures, under ad erroneous impression  
that the non-importation act. would immediately  
cease to operate, and, have arrived in the Uni­

cise, On. unforsern cases of such magnitude, the  
ordinary powers vested in the treasury department  
to mitigate forleitmes, without previously- affording  
to congress an opportunity of making on the sub  
jecVsucb provision as they may think proper. In  
their der ision they will doubtless equally rnnsuli  
what is dee to equitable considerations and loihe  
public interest. . ..  
The receipts into the treasury,&#x27;during the year  
ending on the 30th Sept, last,* have exceeded six­  
teeii millions and a half of dollars—which have

The situation &gt;rf our country, fellow-citizens,is

Lellom-Citizena of the Senate and :  
  
House of Representatives.  
  
On onr present meeting it is my first duty  
to? vite vour attention to the Providential fa-  
your which our country has experienced, in  
the unusual deerce of health dispensed to its  
inhabitants, and in the rich abundance with  
which the earth has rewarded the labors be-  
stowed » it. In the successful cultivation of  
ether branches of industry, and in the progress  
of general improvement favorable to the na-  
tional prosperity, there is just occasion, also,  
for our mutu tl congratulations and thankful-  
ness,  
  
With these blessings are necessarily mingled  
the pressures and vicissitu’es incidental to  
the state of war, into which the United States  
have been forced hy-the perseverance of a  
foreign power, in its system of*injustice and  
ageression.  
  
Previous to its declaration, it was deemed  
proper, as a measure of precaution and fore-  
cast, that a considerable force should . be  
placed in the Michigan teritory, witha general  
view toits security, and, in the event of war,  
tosuch operationsin the uppermost Canada as  
would intercept the hostile influence of Great  
Britain over the savaves, obtain the command  
of the lake on whi h that part of Canada bor-  
ders, and maintain co-operating relations with  
such forces as might be most conveniently em-  
ployed against other parts. Brigadier Gen-  
eral Hull was charged with this provisional  
service ; having under his command a body  
of troops composed of regulars anil of volun-  
teers ane the state of Ohio. Having reached  
his destination after his knowledge of the war,  
and possessing discretionary authority to act  
offensively, he passed into the neighbouring ter-  
vitory of the enemy with a prospect of easy  
and victorious progress. ‘The expedition ne-  
vertheless terminated unfortunately, not only  
ina retreat to the town and fort Detroit,  
but in the surrender ef both, and of the gallant  
corps commanded by that officer. The causes  
of this painful reverse will be investigated by  
a military tribunal.  
  
A distinguishing feature in the operations  
which preceded and followed this adverse  
event, 1s the use made by the enemy of the  
merciless savages under their influence.—  
Whilst the benevolent policy of the United  
States, invariably recommended peace and  
promoted civilization, among that wretched  
portion of the human race; and was making  
exertions to dissuade them from taking either  
side in the war, the enemy has not scrupled  
to call in his aid their rathles; ferocity, armed  
with the horror of those instruments of car-  
nage and torture which are known to spare  
neither age nor sex. In this outrage against  
the laws of honourable war, and against the  
feclings sacred to humanity, the British com-  
imanders cannot resort to « plea of retaliation ;  
for it is committed in the face of cur example.  
They Cannot mitigate it by calling it a self-de-  
  
cnce against Men in arms; for it embraces  
the Most shocking buteheries of defemectess  
families, Nor Can it be pretended that they  
are not answerable for the atrocities perpetrat-  
ed; since the Savares are cmpioyed with  
  
OWiedge, andeyen with inenaces, that their

fury could not be controlled. Suchisthe spec-  
tacle which the deputed authorities of a nation,  
hoasting its religion and m , have not  
been restrained from presenting te an enlight-  
ened age. &quot;  
  
The misfortune at Detroit was not however,  
without a consoling effect. It was followed  
by signal proofs, that the national spirit rises  
according to the pressure on it. The loss of  
ah important post, and of the brave men sur-  
rendered with it, inspired every ~where new  
ardor and determination. In the states and  
districts least remote, it was no sooner.known,  
than every citizen was ready to fly with his  
arms, at once to protect his brethren against  
the blood-thirsty savages let loose by the ene-  
my on an extensive frontier ; and to convert a  
partial calamity into a source of invigorated  
efforts. ‘his patriotic zeal, which it was ra-  
ther necessary to limit than excite, has embo-  
died an ample force from the states of Ken-  
tucky and Ohio, and from parts of Pennsylva-  
nia and Virginia. It is placed, with the ex-  
ception of a few regulars, under the command  
of Brigadier General Harrison, who possesses  
the entire confidence of his fellow soldiers,  
among whom are citizens, some of them vo-  
junteers in the ranks, not less distinguished by  
their political stations, than by their personal  
merits, The greater portion of this force is  
proceeding on its destination, towards the Mi-  
chigan territory, having succeeded in relieving  
an important frontier post, and, in several in-  
cidental operations against hostile tribes of  
savages, rendered indispensable by the sub-  
serviency into which they had been seduced  
by the enemy; a seduction the more cruel,  
as it could not fail to impose a necessity of  
precautionary scverities, against those who  
yielded to it.  
  
Ata recent date, an attack was made ona  
post of the enemy near Niagara, by a detach-  
ment of the. regular and other forces, under  
the command of major general Van Kensse-  
lear of the militia of the state of New-York.  
The attack, it appears, was ordered in com-  
pliance with the ardor of the troops, who ex-  
cuted it with distinguished gallantry and were  
for a time victorious; but not receiving the ex  
pected support, they were compclied to yieid  
to reinforcements of British regulars and sa-  
vages. Ouploss has been considerable and is  
deeply to be lamented. That of of the ene-  
my, less ascertained, will be the more felt, «s  
it includes, among the killed, the commanding  
general, who was also the Governor of the  
Province ; and was sustained by veteran  
troops, from mexperienced soldiers, who must  
daily improve ih the duties of the field,  
  
Our expectation of gaining the command of  
the lakes, by the invasion cf Canada trom De-  
trait, having been disappointed, measures  
were instantly taken to provide, on them, a  
naval force superior to that of the enemy—  
From the talents and activity of the Officer  
charged with this object, every thing that can  
be dene may be expected. Should the present  
season not admit of complete success, the pro-  
gress made will cusure for the next a navai  
ascendency, where it is essential to our per-  
manent peace with, and control over, the sa-  
vares.  
  
Amoxrg the incidents to the measures of the  
war, | am constrained to advert to the refusal  
of the Governors of Massachusetts and Con-  
necticut, to furnish the required detachments  
of militia towards the defence of the maritime  
frontier. The refusal was founded on a reve)  
  
  
  
  
  
the constitution, relating tothe militia. The  
correspondences which will be before you, con-  
tain the requisite information on the subject —  
It is obvious, that if the authority of the U.  
States to’ call into service and command the  
militia for the public defence, can be thus  
frustrated, even in a state of declared war,  
and of course under apprehensions of invasion  
preceding war, they are not one nation for the  
ct most of all requiring it; and that the  
public safety may have no other resource, than  
in those large and permanent military esta-  
blishments which are forbidden by the princi-  
ples of our free government, and against the  
necessity of which the militia were meant to  
act as a constitutional bulwark.  
  
On the coasts, and on the ocean, the war  
has béen as successful as circumstances inse-  
parable from its early stages could promise. .  
Our public ships and private cruisers, by their,  
activity, and where there Was oCcasion, by  
their intrepidity, have made the enemy sensi-  
ble of the difference between a reciprocity of  
captures, and the long confinement of them to  
their side. Our trade, with litthe exception,  
has safely reached our ports; having been  
much favored in it by the course pursued by  
a squadron of our frigates, under the com-  
mand of commodore Rodgers, And jn the  
instance, in which .skill. and bravery were  
more particularly tried with those of the ene-  
my, the American fiag had an auspicious tri-  
umph. The frigate Constitution commanded  
by capt. Hull, after a cicse and short engare-  
ment, completely disabled and captured Bri-  
tish frigate ; gaining for that officer and all on  
board, a praise which cannot be too liberaliy  
bestowed ; not merely for the victory actually  
achieved, but for that prompt and cool exer-  
ton of commanding talents, which, giving to  
courage its highest character, and to the for-  
ce applied its full effect, proved that more  
could have been done in a contest requiring  
more.  
  
Anxious to abridge the evils from’which a4  
state of war cannot be exempt, J lost no time  
after it was declared in conveying to the Bri-  
tish government the terms on which its pro-  
gress might be arrested, without waiting the  
delays of a formal and final pacification. And  
our Charge &lt;d’affaires at London was, at the  
same time, authorised to agree to an armisticc  
founded upon them. ‘These terms required  
that the orders in council should be repealed  
as they affected the United States, without a  
revival of blockades violating acknowledged  
rules; that there should be an immediate dis-  
charge of American seamen fron, British ships ;  
and a stop to impressments from American  
tships, with an understanding that an exclusion  
of the seamen of each nation from ships of the  
other should be stipulated; and that the ar-  
mistice should be improvéd into a definitive  
and comprehensive adjustment of the deren-  
ding controversies. - Although a repeal of those  
orders susceptible of explanations meeting the  
views cf this government, had taken piace be -  
fore this pacific advance was communicated to  
that of Great b, the advance was declined, from  
an avowed repugnance to a suspension of the  
practice of impressment during the armistice  
und Without any intimation that the arrange-  
ment propesed with respect to seamen wouid  
bé accepted. Whether the subsequent com-  
munications from the government, afferding an  
occasion ior re-considering the subject, on the  
part ot Great Britain, will be viewed in a morc  
iavourable light, or received in a more 2ccom.  
  
  
  
and unfcrtunate c»positicn of the previsicns of  
i i  
  
modating spirit, remain to be knowa. It would  
  
  
  
be unwise to relax our measures, in any res-  
pect on a presumption of such a resnit.  
  
The documents from the Department of  
State, which relate to this subject, will give a  
view also of the propositions, for am armistice,  
which have been received here, one of them,  
from the authorities at Halifax &amp; in Canada,  
the other from the British government itself,  
throngh Admiral Warren; and of the grounds  
upen which neither of them could be accep-  
ted.  
  
Our affairs with France retain the posture  
which they held at my last communications to  
you. Notwithstanding the authorised expec-  
tation of an early as well as favourable issue to  
the discussions on foot ; these have been pro-  
crastinated to the latest date. The only in-  
tervening occurrence meriting attention, is the  
promulgation of a French Decree food ages  
to be a definitive repeal of the Berlin and  
Milan decrees.. This proceeding, although  
made the nd of the rovocal of the Briush  
orders in council, is rendered, by the time and  
manner of it, liable to many objcctiwus.  
  
&quot;The final communications from our special  
Minister to Denmark, afford further proofs of  
the effects of his mission, and of the a-  
micable disposition of the Danish government.  
From Russia we have the satisfyction to re-  
ceive assurances of continned friendship, and  
that it will not be affected by the rupture be-  
tween the United States and G. Britain—  
Sweden also professes sentiments favourable  
to the subsisting harniong.  
  
With the Barbary powers, excepting that  
o° Algiers, our affairs remain, on the ordinary  
fo‘tite. ‘The Consul General residing with  
that Regency, has suddenly and without cause,  
been banished, together with all the Ameri-  
can citizens found there. Whether this was  
the transitory efiect of capricious despot.sin,  
or the first act of pre-Cetermined hosiility is  
not ascertained. Précautions were taken by  
the Cousul, on the lattcr supposition. d  
  
The Indian tribes, not under foreign insti-  
gations, remain at peace, and receive the civi-  
li ing attentions, which have proved so beucfi-  
cial to them,  
  
With a view to that vigorous proscd¢ution  
of the war, to which our aational faculties  
are adequate, the attention of Congress will  
  
. be particulariy drawn to the insufficiency of  
the existing ‘provisions for filling up the mili-  
tury establishment, Such is the happy condi-  
tion of our country, arising from the facility of  
subsistence and the high wages for every spe-  
cies of occupation, that, notwithstanding the  
aurmented inducements provided at the last  
session, 2 partial success only has attended the  
recruitme service. The deficiency has been  
necessarily suppried during the campaign, by  
other than regular troops, with all the incou-  
veidences and expences incident to them. The  
remedy lcs, in establishing, more favourably  
for the private soldier, the proportion between  
  
his recompeuse and the teins o« his enlistment.  
  
Aad it is a subject which canact too soou or  
  
1.0 :criously be taken into considc ration.  
  
The same insufficiency has becn experien-  
ccd in the provisions for volunteers made by  
aun act of thedast sessicn. The recompence  
  
for the service required in this case, is stil |  
  
Ic ss attractive ‘than in the other. And al-  
though patriotism alcne las seat imtothe field  
cone*vamuable corps of that description, those  
glone who can afford the sacrifice, can reason-  
ably Be eapected to yiext to that hupuise.  
  
it will merit consideration also whether, as  
auxiliary to the vecursty ofgur lrunticr, corps  
  
[ 100 }  
  
&quot;  
  
may not be advantageously organized, with a  
  
restriction of their services tv particular dis-  
tricts convenient to them. And whether the  
local and occasional] services of mariners and  
others in the sea-port towns, under a similar  
organization, would not be a provident addi-  
tion to the means of their defence.  
  
l recommend a provision for an increase of  
the general officers of the army, the defigency  
of which has been illustrated by the number  
and distance of separate commands, which the  
course of war and the advantage of the ser-  
vice have required.  
  
And I cannot press too strongly, on the  
earliest attention of the Legislature, the im-  
portance of the re-organization of the staff  
establishment; with a view to render more  
distinct and definite the relations and respon-  
sibility of its several departments. That there  
isroom forimprovements which will materially  
promote both economy and success, in what  
appertains to the army andthe war, 15 equally  
inculcated by the examples of other couutries,  
and by the experience of our own.  
  
A reviston of the militia laws for the purpose  
of rendering them more systematic, aud better  
adapting them toemergencies of the war, is at  
tls time particularly desirable.  
  
Of the additional ships authorized to be fitted  
for service, two will be shortly ready to sail;  
athirdisunder repair, &amp; delay will be avoided  
in the repair of the residue. Of the appropri-  
ations for the purchase of materials for ship-  
building, the greater part has been applied to  
that object. and the purchases will be conti-  
nued with the balance.  
  
The enterprising spirit which has charac-  
terized our naval force, and its success both  
in restraiipg insults and depredations on our  
coasts, and in reprisals-on the enemy, will uot  
fuil to recommend an enlargement of it.  
  
‘here being reason to believe thaf the act  
proliibiting the acceptance of British licences,  
is not a Sufficient guard against the use of  
them for purposes favorable to the interests &amp;  
views of the enemy ; further provisions on that  
subject are highly important, Nor is it less  
so, that penal enactments should be provided  
for cases of corrupt and perfidious intercourse  
with the enemy, not amounting to treason, nor  
yet embraced by any statutory provisions.

the 30th of September last, will together with  
the current revenue, enable us to defray aj  
the expences of this year,  
  
The duties on the late unexpected importa.

‘The situation of our country, fellow-citizens,

in animating considerations of which the view  
here presented of our pecuniary resources}s  
an example, With more than one nation, we

with one, powerful in the means and habitsof  
war, we are at war. ‘lhe spirit and strength  
of this nation are nevertheless equal to the  
support of all its rights and to carry it thr  
all its triais. ‘They can be met in that conf.  
dence. Above allwe have the inestimable  
consolation of knowing, that the war. in which  
we are actually engaged is a war neither o  
ambition nor ot vain glory; that it is waged,  
not in Violation of the rights of others, but in  
the maintenance of our own; that it was prece.  
ded by a patience without example, under  
wrongs accumulating without end: and that it  
was finally not declared until every hoped  
averting it was extinguished, by the transfer  
ofthe British sceptre into new hands clinging  
to former councils; and until declaratioss  
were reiterated to the last hour through the  
British envoy here, that the hostile edicts

Fellow Citizans of the Senate, : Y  
- and House of Reprefeniatives, i E  
ON oar present meeting it is my firt duty te invite |  
‘your attention to the Previdential favors which our coun.  
try has experienced, in-the unufoal degree of health dis.  
penfed to its inbabitants, and in the rich abund2nce with -  
which the earth has rewarded the labors beßlowed on it.  
In the fuccelsfu! cultivation of other branches of indufs  
try, aond in the progrels of general tmprovemeat favora­  
ble to the national pro(perty, there is jußt oecafion, also,  
for our mmtaal congratulations and thankfulnefs.  
With these blessings are neceffurily mingled the pres­  
sures and viciffiiudes incidental to the Rate of war, into  
which the. United States have been forced by the perse­  
verance of a foreiga power, in its system of injultice and  
agereflion. ‘ . &#x27;  
.- Previous&#x27;to its declaration, it was deemed proper, as a  
-measure of precaution and forecalt, that a considerable  
~ force thould be plated in the Michigan territory, with 2  
- general view to its security, and in the event of war, to  
-such operations in the uppermost Canada as would inter®  
- cept the hostile influcace of i}reat Britain over the savages,  
- obtain- the comtand of the lake on which that part of  
- Canada borders, and maintain co-operating relations with  
| such forces as might be moR conveniently employed a­  
gainst other parts, Brigadier General Hull was charged  
with this provisional service ; having under his command  
a body of troops composed of repulars and volunteers  
from the Rate of Olio. Having reached his destination  
- after bis knowledge of the war, and poflcfling discretion.  
. ary authority to a&amp; cffenfively, he pafled into the neigh.  
. boring territory of the enemy with 2 profpe&amp; of cafy and  
- vitorious progress. The expedition nevertheless termi­  
nated unfortunately, not osly in a retreat to the town and  
&#x27; fort of Detroit, but in the surrender of both, and of the  
; gatlant corps commanded by that officer The causes of  
. this painfui revesfe will be inveßigated by a military tri­  
&#x27; bunal. &#x27; ; :  
| . A dißtinguifhed feature in the operations which preced­  
. ed and followed this adverse event, is the use made by our  
- enemy of the mercile(s savages under ‘their influence.  
| Whilk the benevolent policy of the U:f?d States, invari­  
| - ably recommended peace &amp; promoted civilization, among  
&#x27; that-wretehed portion of the human race ; and was mak­  
| “ing exertions to dissuade” them from taking either fide in  
! the war, the enemy has not scrupled to call to his aid  
their ruthless ferocity, armed with the horrers of those  
instruments of carnage and torture, which are kaown to  
spare neither age nor sex. In this outrage against the laws  
| of honorable war, and againll the feelings sacred to hu.  
manity, the Britith commanders cannot resort to a plea  
of retaliation ; for it is committed ia the face of our ex­  
ample. - They cannot mitigate it, by calling it a felf de.  
fence against men in arms ; for it embraces the most shock­  
ing butcheries of defencelefs families.. Nor can it be pre.  
tended that they are not answerable for the attrocities per­  
petrated ; since the savages are employed with a knowl.’  
edge, and even with menaces, that thgir fury ‘could not be  
;contro‘led, Such is the {peftacle which the deputed. au.  
thorities of a nation boasting its religion- and morality,.  
have not been restrained from presenting to an ealighten­  
cd age, : Wk A 0 WAL TRO JBEATETOTS SR  
The misfortune at Detroit was not, however, without  
a consoling effed. It was followed by signal proefs, that  
the national fpirjt rises according to the pressure on it.  
‘The loss of an important, pok,.and ;the brave men sur­  
rendered with it, inspired every wheré new ardor and dé­  
termination. .In the fates and difkri@s lealt remete, it  
was ne sooner known, than every citizen was ready to fly.  
with his arms, at once to proteét his brethren against the.  
blood thirty savages let loose by the enemy on an exien­  
five frontier ; and to convert a partial calamity into&#x27;a  
source of invigorated efforts. - - | er DA S  
This &#x27; patriotic zeal; which it was necessary rather to  
limit than&#x27;te excite, has embodied an ample force from.  
the (fates of Kentucky and Oliio, and from parts of Pedn.  
{fylvania and Virgioia. . It is placed, with the dddition eof:  
a few rc%:nlan,.under the command of Brigadier Geners’  
! al Hurrifon, who&#x27;poffé(fes the entire confidence of his fel&lt;’  
| low soldiers, among whom are citizens, some of them vol. .  
t unteers in ifx_e, ranks, not less diltinguithed by their. politi,-  
{ cal Rations, than by their personal merits. The greater  
{ portion of this force&#x27;is proceeding on its destination, to.  
- wards the Michigan territory, having {ncceeded in&#x27;relicy.  
. ing an important frontier poßk, and in several incideptal  
| operations against hostile tribes of savages, rendered in.  
{ dispensable by. the fublerviency into which they had been:  
seduced by-the enemy ; a fedu@ion’ the more cruel, as it  
could aot fail to impose -a necessity of precautionary fe-*  
_verities against those who yielded toir. =~~~ |  
- At a recent date, an attack was made on 2 post of the,  
| enemy near Niagara, by a detachment of the regularand­  
other forces, under the command. of the Major General:  
Van Renflalaer of the militia of the Rtate ofN?wY‘gr:

ceiving the expe@ed support, they were compelled to yield  
to reinforcements, of . British regulars and favifes. Our  
loses has been considerable and is deeply to bz lamented.  
“That of the enemy, less ascertained, will be the more felt,  
~as it includes among. the killed the commanding general,

— Oa the coafls, and on the oceun, rite” war has been ag  
facceliful as circumstances infepsrable from its eady stag­  
es could premise. - Our public ships and private cruisers,  
by their allivity, and, where there was oceafion, by their  
intrepidity, have made the enemy sensible of the difference  
betw¢n a reciprocity of captures, and the long confihe­  
ment of them to their fide. Our trade, with little excep­  
tion, has fafely reached ovur ports—having been much  
favered in it by the course puifusd by a squadron of ofr  
frigates, under the command of Commodore Rodgers.  
And in the instance, in which fkili and bravery were more  
particularly tried with those of the enemy, the American  
- tlag had an auspicious triumph. The frigate Conftitation,  
commanded by Captain Hull, after a close and short en­  
gagement, compleatly disabled ‘and captured a Britith  
frigate ; gaining for that officer and all on board, a praise  
which cannot be too liberally bestowed ; not mercly for  
~ the vitory a&amp;nally achieved, but for that prompt and cool  
- exertion of commanding talents, which giviug to courage  
its highelt charader, and to the force applied its (ull effc&amp;,  
| proved that more cotld have beéd done im &amp; comteft re.  
quiring more. : : Ao ,  
&#x27;i Aunxiows to abridge the ¢vils from which a fate of war  
| eannoc be exempt, I loft no time afte? it was declarsd in  
~ conveying to the Britith government the cerms on which  
its progress might be arrefied, withogtjgwalting the delays  
of a formal and fmal pacification. And oo charge d’af­  
affairs at London was at the (ame time, authorifed to a­  
. gree to an armiltice founded wpon them. Thele terms re-  
I quired, that the orders in: cooncil thould be répealed as  
| they affe@ed the United States, withoot a revival of block.  
. ades violating acknowledged rules 5 that there should be  
!_&#x27; an immediate discharge of American seamen from Brit­  
ith ships; and 2 (op put to imprefimgnts from American  
ships with an understanding that an exclusion of the sea­  
. men of&#x27;each nation from the ships of the other should be  
| ftipuldred , and that the armiltice thould be improved in­  
to a definitive and‘comprehenfive adjustment of ‘depend.  
&amp; ing controvel fies, &#x27;  
- Although a repeal of the orders fulceptible of explarations  
mecting the views of this government, had taken place before  
“ this pacific advance was communicated t&amp;&#x27; Great Britain, the ad­  
vance Was declined, from an avowed repugnance to a fulpenfion  
of the practice of imprefiment during the armistice, and without  
any-iotimation that the arrangement prapofed with relpeéx 1o sea­  
men would be accepted. Whetherthe fuobfcguent comaunications  
from rhis” government, affording an occahion, for re confideriag  
the {ubje. on the part of Great Britain, will be viewed in 2 more  
favorable light, or received in a 2 more accommindating spirit, re­  
maids to be kdown, &quot;It would be unwise to relax our measures,  
in any refpe, on 2 presumption of (uch a result, %

Lellow-Criizens of the Senate, : &quot;  
&quot; and House of Repirescntatives,  
~&#x27;ON our pr. semt meeting it is my fisst duty  
(¢ invite your attention to the va{demial fu­  
vies which our country bas experienced, in  
(he usual degree of bealth dispensed to its in­  
hbigams, and in the rich abundance with  
wiich the earth has rewarded the labors bes­  
tuwved on it. In the successful cultivation of  
other branches of industry, end in the pro­  
gess of genmeral improvement [avorable to  
tbe national prosperity, there is just occasion,  
abo, for our mnutual congratulations and  
tlank fulness, -  
With thése blessings are necessarily ming­  
led the pressures and vicissitudes incideotal  
to thie state of war, into which the United  
*States hiave been forced by the perseverance  
of a foreign power, in s systemn of injustice  
and aggression, |  
Previous to its declaration, it was deemed  
proper, as a aeasure of precaution and fore­  
cast, that a considerable force should be plac-:  
ed in thie Michigan territory, with a general  
view to its secariry, and in the event of war,  
to such operations in the uppermost. Canada:  
as would intercept the hostile influence of G.  
Liritain over the sevages, obtain the command  
of the Luke on which that part of Canada  
borders, and maintain co-operating relations  
with such forces as might be most convenicnt­  
ly employed against other parts. Brigudier-  
General Hull was charged with this provis­  
ionul service ; baving under his command a  
bedy of troops comwposed of regulars and voi­  
‘unteers from the State of Ohiog~Having  
rosched his destination after his-knowledge of  
‘the war, and possessing discretjonary author­  
ity to act offensively, he passed into the neigh­  
boring territory of the enemy with a prospect  
of easy and victovious progress. The expe­  
dition nevertheless terminuted unfortunately,  
not only in a retreat to the town and fort of  
Dettoity but in the surrender of both, and of  
the gallunt corps commanded by that officer.  
T he causes of this painful reverse will be in­  
vestigated by a military tribunal. |  
A distingwished feature in the operations  
which preceded and followed this adverse e­  
vent, is the use tnade by our encmy of ihe  
merciless . savages under their inlluence.  
Whilst the benevolent policy ol the U.States  
invariably recommended peace, and premoted  
civilization among that wretched portion of  
the huaif race ; and was making exertions!  
to dissnada them from taking either side in&#x27;  
the war, the enemy hus not scrupled to call  
to bis aid theiv rathless ferocityy armed with  
the herrors of those instrutnents of carnage  
and torture, which are known to spare ncith­  
“er age nor sex. In this outrage sgainst the  
‘ laws of hunorable wary end ugainst the feel-  
Cings sicred to humanity, the Britith com- |  
manders cannot resort to &amp; piea of retaliation;  
for it is connmitted in the face of our cxam­  
ple. They coiwot mitigate ity by calling it a 1  
sell-defence aguinst men in arms ; for it e«  
bruces the moet shocking butcheries of de­  
fenceless sumilies. Nor can it be pretended  
that they are not answerable for the atrecities  
perpesated ; since the savages are employed  
with a knowledge, and even with menaces,  
that their fury could not be controled. Such  
is the spectacle which the deputed authorities  
of a nation boasting its religion and morality,  
have not Leen restrazined from presenting to  
an enlightened age. -  
The misforiune at Detroit was not, howev­  
er, without a consoling ¢flcet. It was follow­  
ed by signal proofs, that the national spirit ri­  
ses according to the pressuve on it. The  
loss of an important post, and the brave men  
surrendered with it, inspired every where  
new ardor and determination. In the States  
and districts ledst remote, it was no sooner  
known, than every ciiizen was ready to fly  
with his arms, at once to protect his brethren  
against the blood-thirsty savages let lcose by  
the cnemy on an extensive [toutier ; and te  
convert a partial calamily intu a source of in­  
viglvzrntcd efforts.  
his patriotic z&lt;¢al, which it was necessary  
rather to limit than excite, has embodied an  
ample force {rom the States of Kcutucky and  
Ohioy and from parts of Pennsylvania &amp; Vir­  
rinia, It is placed, with the addition of a  
few regulars, under the command of Briga.  
dicr-General Harvison, who possesses the en­  
tire confidence of his fellow-soldiers, among  
whow are citizens, somec of them volunteers  
in the ranks, not less distinguished by their  
rolhical stations, than by their personul mer­  
ts. The greater portion of this forge is pro­  
~ceeding on its destination, towards the Mich­  
igan territory, having succeeded in relieving  
an important frontter post, and in scveral in­  
cidental operations agninst hestile trives of  
savages, rendered indispensable by the sub­  
serviency into which they had been seduced  
by the enemy ; a seduction the more cruelas  
it could net farl 1o impasa a necessity of pre­  
cautionary severities against those who y&amp;l&#x27;!l‘  
ed o it. g  
At a recent date, an attack was made on 8  
post of the enemy ncar Niagara, by a detuch:  
ment of the regular and siber forces, under  
We&#x27;vommand of Maj. Gen. Van Renyseloer,  
a of the State of New-York. The  
*m appe rhﬁa. ordered in compliance  
with the v of the troops, who exceuted  
itwith isaed gallantey, and were [or  
a time vigtorious ; but not recciving the ex­  
pected support, they were compalied to yield  
(o reinforcementy of Britsd regulary and save  
  
&#x27;.%. Our less has been coenusideraile, antl  
is deeply to be lamcented. T hit of the ene­  
my, ess ascertained, will be the moie lelt, us  
it includes smong the Liiled the commandinsg  
general, who was also the Governor of the  
Province : end wus sustatied by veteran  
troops, fiom vepexperienced soldiers, who  
must daily impiove in the dutles of tle field.  
Our expectation of guising the ccmmand  
of the Liakes, by the invasion of Canada from  
Detroit, huving been disappointed, measures  
were instantly teken to provide, on them, a  
naval force superior to that of the enemy.  
From the talents and activity of the cfiicer  
¢harged with this object, every. thing that  
cen be doue may bLe expecied —Shouid the  
present seasen not sdmit of complete suc­  
cess, the progress made will ensure for the  
next a naval ascendancy, where it is essential  
to our permanent peace with, and control .oy -  
er the savages,  
  
. Among ibe incidents to the measures of  
¢ war, | am censtrained to advert to fhe re­  
fusal of the Governurs of Massachusetts end  
Connecticut, to furnish the required detach­  
ments of militia towards the defence of the  
maritime frontier. Y  
The refusal was founded on a novel and  
unfortunate exposition of the provisions of  
the comnstitution relating to the militia.—7 The  
correspondencies will&#x27;be before you, contain  
the recuisite information on the subject. It  
is obvious, that if the authority of the United  
States to call into service and command the  
militia for the public defence, can be thus  
frustrated, even in a state of declared war,  
and of course under apprehensicn of invasion  
preceding war, they are not ene nation for  
the purpose most of all requiring: it ; and  
that the public sufety may have no other re­  
source, than in those large and permanent  
military establishments which are forbidden  
by the principles of our free government,and  
against the necessity of which the militia  
were meant to be a constitutional bulwark.  
On the coasts, and on the ocean, the war,  
has been ss successful as circumstances iu­  
separsble from its eatly stages could promise.  
Our public ships and private cruizers, by  
their activity, and, where there was occasion,  
by their intrepidity, have. mace the enemy  
sensible of the difference between a recipro­  
city of captures, and the long confinement of  
them to their side.—~Qur. trade, with little  
ex€eption, has salely reached our ports—~have  
ing been much favored in it by the conrse  
pursued by a squadron of our fmgates, under  
the command of Commodoreßo&#x27;gers. And  
in the instance, in which skill and brave::-  
were more particulatly tiied with those of  
the enemy, the American flag had an auspic­  
ious triumph. The frigate vnstitution,  
commanded by Capt. Hull, after a close and  
short engagement, completely disabled and  
captured a British frigate ; gaining for that  
ofiicer and all on board, a praise which can­  
nal be 100 liberally bagtowed : not merely for  
the victory actually atchieved, but for thac  
prompt and cool exertion of commanding tal­  
ents, which, giving to courage its highest  
character, and to the force applied its full ef­  
fect, proved that more could have been done  
  
in a contest requiring more. - &quot;  
Anxious to übridge the evils fom which a state 6f  
war cannot be exempt, L ltst no time afierit was  
declared in conveving to the British government the  
terms on which its progress might be arrested, with.  
out awaiting the delays of a formal and final pacifi.  
cation. Ard cur charge d&#x27;.flsirs at London was at  
the same time, authorized to.agree to an armistice  
founded upon them- Tlese terms required, that  
tue orders in council should be repealed us tley afe  
fected the United States, without a revivat of block­  
ades violating acknowledged rules : that there should  
be an immediate discharge of Amcrican seamea from  
British ships ; and a stop put to imprerzsments from  
Awmerican ships, with an understanding that an ex­  
clusion bf the seamen of each nation from the sbips  
of the other should be stipulated ; and that the arm­  
istice should be improved into a definate and com­  
prehensive adjustment of depending controversies.  
Although a repeal of the orders susceptible of ex­  
planations meeting the views of this government, had  
taken place before this pacific advance was com.  
municuted to that of Gireat-Britain, the advance was  
declined, from an avowed repugnance to a suspension  
of the practice of impressment,during the armistice,  
and without any intimation that the arrangement  
proposed with respect to sesmen would be accept­  
ed. Whether the subsequent communicationn from  
this government, aflording an occasion for re-cansid­  
cring the subject, on the part of Great-Britain] will  
be viewed in a more accommodating spirit, remains  
to be known. It would be unwise to relax ourmeas­  
ur‘es, in any respect, on &amp; presumption of such a re­  
sult.  
  
The documents from the Department of State,  
which relate 10 this subject, will give a view also of  
the propositions for an armistice, which hiave been re­  
ceived here, one of them from the authorities st  
Halifax and in Canada, the other from the British  
government, itself, through admical Warren ; and of  
the grounds upon which necither of them could be  
accepted.  
Our affairs with France retain the posture which  
they held at my last communications to you. Not.  
withstanding the authorised expectation of an early  
as well as fuvorable issue to the discussions on {cot,  
these have been procrastinated to the latest date.  
The only intervening occurrence meriting attention,  
is the promul sution of a French decree, purrort’.ng  
to be a definiiive repesl of (he Berlin and Milan de.  
crees. ‘This proceedi g, althougl made the ground  
of the repeal of the British erders in council, is ren­  
dered, by the time anl manner of it, liable to many  
objectivoms.  
The final commanications {rum eur special Minister  
to Denmark, . flord further proofs of the good effects  
~ of his mission, and of the amicable dispo:ition ef the  
Danish government. From Russia we have the  
satisfaction to receive assurr nees of continued friend.  
ship, and that it will not be affected by the ruptuie  
_between the United States and Great Dritain. Swe­

occupation, that notwilhsianding the augmented  
inlucemenis provided at the last session, a parial  
success oaly has attended the recruiting service.  
The deficiency h*s been necessarily supplicd, duiing  
the campaiga, by other than regular troops with all  
the isconvenignces and expenses incident to them.  
The remedy lies in establishing, more favorably for  
the private soldicr, the propertion between his re­  
&#x27;cot:gence and the term of his enljstment. And it is  
a subject which canrnot too soon or tvo seriously be  
takeu into consideration.  
  
The same insufliciency has been experien­  
ced in the provisions for volunteers, mude by  
an act of the last session. The recompense  
for the service required in this cuse, is siiil  
less attractive than in the othér.—~And altho’  
patriotism alone has sent iaté the field some  
valuable corps of that description, those a­  
lone whe can sfford the sacrifice, can reason­  
ably be expected to yield to that impulse.  
It will merit constderation also whether, as  
auxiliary to the security of our-frontier, co:ps  
may not be advantageously organized with a  
restriction of their services to particulor dis­  
tricts convenient to them, And whether the  
local and occasional services of mariners and  
others in the seaport towns, under a similar  
organization, would not be a provident addi­  
tion to the means of their defence.  
I recommend a provision for an increase of  
the generai officers of the army, the deficien­  
cy of which has been illustrated by the num­  
ber and distance of separate commands,which  
the course of the war and the advantage of  
the service have required.  
And I cannot press too strongly, on the  
earliest attention of the Legislature, the im­  
portance of the re-organization of the staff  
cstablishment ; with a view to render more  
distinct and definate the relations and respon­  
sibilities of its several departments.—Thut  
there is room for improvements which®will  
materially promote both e@conomy and suc­  
cess, in what appenain3 to the army and to  
the war, is equally incuicated by the examples  
of other countries, and §y the experience of  
our own.  
A revision of the militia laws for the pur­  
pose of rendering them more systematic, and  
better gdapting them to the emergencies of  
the war, is at this time particularly desirable.  
Of the additional ships authorized to be  
fitted for sea, two will be shortly ready to sail ;  
a third is under repair, and dclay will be  
avoided in the repair of the residue. Of the  
appropristigns for the purchase of materials  
for ship building, the greater part bas been  
apglied to that object, apd the purchases will  
be continued with the balance.  
The enterprizing spirit which has charac­  
terised our naval force, and its success both  
in restraiping insults and depredations on our  
coasts, and in repwisals on the enemy, will  
not fail to recommend an enlargement of it.  
Thove being reason ta hh‘“w the act  
Prohibiting the acceptence of British liccnses,  
s not a sufficient guard against the use Bf  
ghem for purposes favorable to the interests  
#d views of the enemy ; further provisions  
on that subject are highly important. Noris  
it less so, that penal enactments should be  
provided for cases of corrupt and perfidions  
Intercourse with the enemy, not amounting  
to treasom, nor yet embraced by any statuory  
provisions. -  
- A consideruhble number of American ves­  
sels were in England when the revocation of  
the Orders in Council took piace, were laden  
with British manufactures, under an ertcne­  
ous impressioa that the non-imporiation act  
would immediately cease to operate, and have  
arrived in the United States. [t did not ap­  
pear proper to exercise, on unforseen cases  
of such magnitude, the ordinary powers vest­  
ed in the Treasury Department to mitigate  
forfeitures, without previously affording to  
Congress an opportunity of making on the  
subject such provision as they may think pro­  
per.—ln their decision they will doubtiess e­  
quaily consult what is due to equitable con­  
siderations and to the public interest.  
&quot; The receipts into the Treasury during the  
year ending on the 30th of September last,  
have exceeded sixteen millions and a haif  
of dollars ; which have been sufficient to de­  
fray the demands on the I&#x27;reasury to that day;  
including a necessary reimbursement of near  
three millions of the principal of the public  
debt. In these receipts is included a sum of  
near $5,850,000 received on account of the  
loans authorized by the acts of the last session:  
the whole sum actually ebtained on loan, a­  
mounts to $ll millions, the residue of which  
being receivable subsequent to the 30th of  
September last, will, together with the cur­  
rent revenue, cnable us to defray the expen­  
ses of this year. |  
The duues on the late unexpected impor­  
tations of British manufactures, will render  
the revenue of the ensuing ycar more pro­  
ducti:« than could have been anticipated.  
The situation of our country, fellow-citi­  
zens, is not without its difficulues ; though it  
abounds Manimating considerations, of which  
the views herc presenced of our pecuniary  
resources is an example. With more than  
one nation, we have scrious and unsettled  
controversies ; and with one,powerful in th 4  
means and habits of warywe are at war. The  
spiriti&amp;strength of this nation are,nevertheless,  
equal o the support of all its rights; and 1o  
carry it through all its trials. They can be  
met in that coniiden-e. 4 Above all, we have  
the inestimable consolagjon of k y wing, that  
the war in which we are actmally engaged is  
a war neither of ambition nor ol vain glory :  
that it is m &#x27;.gu in violation of the ights  
of others, but in the maintenance o( our own,  
hat it is preceded by a patience without ex­  
amole, tader the wrongs accumulating with­  
ot end ; aed that it was ﬁ.&#x27;nlly. not declared  
until every hope of averting it was gxig- 3  
  
gudibed, by the transfer of the British scep­  
we into new henls clinging to former coun­  
cils ; and vl Jetlarutions were Icitermed  
to the last hour, through the British Envoy  
hers, that the hostile edicts agulast our com­  
mercial mghts, and our maritime mdepen~  
dence would not be revoked, without viela­  
tingy the obligations of Great-Britain to other  
powers 2s Well as 10 her own interests.  
To have shrank, under such clicumstan­  
ces, from manly resistance, would have been  
a degredation blasting our best end proudest  
hopes ; it would bave struck us from the  
high rack, where the virtuous struggles of  
our fathers had placed us, and have betrayed  
the magnificent legacy which we hold in trust  
for future gmr-gom; It would bave ac­  
knowiedged, tlat on the element, which  
forms three fourths of the globe we inhabit,  
and whete all nations have equal and commeon  
rights, the Awerican pevpie wete not an -  
depeadent people, but colonists and vassals.  
1t was &amp;t this moment, and with such an al­  
ternative, thet war was chosen. The nation  
felt the necessity of it, and called for it. The  
appeel was acco:dingly made, in a just cause,  
to a just and all powerful Being, who holds  
in his hands the chain of events and the des­  
tiny of nations. It remains ounly, that faith­  
ful to oursclves, entangled in no connections  
with the vicws of other powers, and ever rea­  
dy ta accept peace from the hands of jusiice,  
we prosecute the war with united councils  
and with the ample faculties of the nation,  
until peace be so obtained, and as the only  
means, under the divine blessing, of speedily  
obtaining it. JAMES MADISON.

Canada from Detroit, having been disap­  
pointed, measures were Instantly taken  
to prov.de, on them, a naval force supe­  
rior to that of the enemy. &#x27; From the  
talents and aenrity of the officer charg­  
ed with this object, every thing that can  
be done may be expected. Should the  
present season not admit of complete  
success the progress made.will ensure  
for the next a nval ascendancy, where  
it is essential to oar permanent peace  
with, and control over, the savages.  
Among the Incidents to the measures  
of the war, I am constrained to advert to  
ths refusal of the Governors of Msssa  
chuactie and Connecticut to furnish the  
required detachments of militia towards  
the defence of the maritime frontier.  
The refusal waa founded on a novel and  
unfortunate exposition of the provisions  
of the constitution, relating to the militia.  
The correspondences which&quot; will be be  
fore you, contain the requisite informa­  
tion on the subject. , It is obvious, that  
if the authority of the Unired.Sfatcs to  
call into service and command the mili­  
tia for the public defence, can be thus  
frustrated, even In a atate of declared  
war, and of course under apprehensions  
of invasion preceding war, they are not  
onemtion for the purpose moat of all  
requiring it ;. andatnat tne puouc aatety  
may have no other resource, than in  
those large and permanent military es­  
tabtiflhmenta which are forbidden by the  
principles &#x27;of our free government, and  
ag&amp;lnst the necessity of which the mH­  
ti4 were meant to be. a constitutional  
bulwark. , .  
-On the coasts, and on the ocean, the  
war has bec&#x27;as successful as circum­  
stances&#x27; inseparable fromits earl- stages  
cnold proraiset Our public &#x27; ships and  
private cruisers, by their activity, and,  
where there wa; occasion: by their in­  
trepidity, have made the enemy sensible  
of th difference between a reciprocity  
cf captures, and the, long confinement of  
them on their side. . Our trade, with  
little exception, has safety reached our  
ports ; havlngbeen muclv favored in.it  
by the course pursued by a squadron of  
our frigates, under &#x27;the: command .ol  
Commodore Hodgers. &#x27;And in the in­  
stance, in which skill. and bravery were  
more particularly tried with those ot the  
enemy, the American flag hatan auv

tion, commanded by capu Holl, aficr a

A Anxious to ahridgej the, rrils from  
which iute of srar cannot bt&#x27;exciipt,  
I lost&#x27; no time after it was declared in  
coatcyioc t the BrUUh QOTcrsmtnrJ  
  
if the terms on whic its progress might  
  
be arrested, without awaiting the delays  
of a formal and final pacification. Apd  
our charge d&#x27;affaires at London was, ai  
the same time, authorised to agree to  
an armistice i founded upon them.-  
These terms required, that the ,ord-ra  
in council should be repealed as they  
affected the United States, without a  
revival of blockades violating acknow­  
ledged rules ; that there should be an  
immediate discharge of American sea­  
men from British ships ; and a stop to  
impressments from American ships,  
with an understanding that an exclusion  
of the seamen of each nation from the  
ships of the other should be stipulated.;  
and that the armistice should be impro­  
ved into a definitive and comprehensive  
adjustment of depending controversies.  
Although a repeal of the orders sus­  
ceptible of explanations meeting the  
views of this government, had taken  
before this pacific advance was commu­  
nicated to that of Great Britain, the ad­  
vance was declined, from an avowed  
repugnance to suspension of the prac­  
tice of impressment during the armis­  
tice, and without any intimation that  
the arrangement proposed with respect  
to seamen would be accepted. Whe­  
ther the. subsequent communications  
from this g6ernment, affording an oc­  
casion for re-considering the subjection  
the. part of Great-Britain, will be viewed  
in a mora favorable light, or received in  
a mere accommodating spirit, remains  
to be known. It would be unwise to  
relax our measures, in any respect, on  
a presumption of such a result.  
The documents from the Department  
of State, ,vhich relate to this subject,  
will give a view also of the propositions  
for -an armistice, whichihave b-en re­  
ceived here, one of them from the au­  
thorities at Halifax and in Canada, the  
other from the British government it­  
self, through admiral Warren; and of  
the grounds upon which neither of them  
could be accepted.  
Our affairs with France retain the  
posture which they&#x27; held at my last  
communications to you. Not withstand  
ing the authorised expectation of an  
early as well as favorable issue to the  
discussions on foot ; Jhes? have been  
procrastinated te the latest date. The  
only intervening occurrence meriting  
attention, is the promulgation of  
a  
French decree purporting to be a defi  
nitive repeal of the Berlin and MiUn  
decrees. This proceeding:- althoueh  
made the ground of the repeal of the  
British orders in. council, is rendered,  
by the time and manner of ir, liable to  
many objections.  
The final communications from our  
special Minister to Denmark, afford  
further proofs of the good effects of his  
mission, a ad of the amicable disposition  
of the Danish government. From Rus  
sia wt have-the satisfaction tp receive  
assurances of continued friendship,&#x27; and  
that it will not be affected by the rup  
ture between the United -b&#x27;ates and  
Great Britain. Sweden also&#x27;professes  
sentiments favorable to the subsisting  
hatmony.  
With the Barbary powers, excepting  
that of Algiers, our affairs remain4 on  
the ordinary foeting. The Consul Ge  
neral residing with that Regency, has  
suddenly, and without cause, been ba­  
nished,, together with all the &#x27;American  
citizens found there. Whether this was  
thes transitory effect of ca primus des­  
potism, or the first act of predetermined  
hostility, is not ascertained. Precau­  
tions were taken by the Consul, oirthe  
latter supposition. &#x27; f :  
The Indian tribes, not under foreign  
instigations, -remaio, at peace, and re­  
ceive the civilising attentions, which&#x27;  
have proved so beneficial to them, j &#x27;  
With a vie w, to .that vigorous prose­

than in the other. And although patri.  
otism alone has sent into the ield some  
valuable corps of that&#x27; description, those  
alone who can, a fForcl the-sacrifice, can  
be expected to yield to that impulse.  
&#x27; It will merit consideration also whe  
  
iher, as auxiliary to the security of our.  
frontier, corps may hxw be advantage­  
ously organised, with a restriction vof  
their services to particular districts ej6n3  
venient to them. And whether the lo­  
cal and occasional. services of mariners  
and others in iie uea-port towns, under  
a similar organization, would not be a  
provident addition to the means of their  
defence. - -  
I recommend a provision for ari tn­  
creasev of the general effict rs of the ar­  
rpsy, theldeficiency of which has been  
illustrated by the number and distance  
of beparute commands, which the course  
of the war and the advantage of the ser­  
vice have required.  
And I can not press top strongly, on  
?be early attention of the Legisla urr  
the importance of the re-orgaoiotton  
of the staff establishment ; with a view  
to render more distinct and definite the  
relations and responsibilities of its seve­  
al departments. That there is room  
for improvements which will materially  
promote both economy and success, in  
what appertains to the army and the  
war, is equally inculcated by the exam  
pies of oihir countries, and by the ex  
perienced &#x27;of our own.,-  
: A revision of the militia taws for the  
purpose of rendering them more sys  
tematic, and better adapting them to  
emergencies of war, is at this time par  
ticularly desirable.  
Of the additional ships authorised to  
be fitted for service, two will be shortly  
ready to sail ; a third under repair  
and delay - will be avoided in the repair  
of the residue. Of the appropriations  
for the purchase of materials for ship-  
uuitaing, cne greater part nas been ap  
plied io that object, and the . purchases  
will be conunued tvith the balance.  
Tne enterpiisiig. spirit which has  
characterised our naval force arid, its  
success both jn restraining insults and  
ucpreoauonb on our-coasis, anu in re­  
prisals on the enemyV will not fail to  
recommend an enlargement of it.  
There being reason to brtieve that  
the act-prohibiting Ihe acceptance;, cf  
priuan licences,, is ayi a sumciem guard  
against the use of them for purposes  
favorable to the interests and views of I  
thetnemy ; further provisions on ihat  
subject; are highly important.!; Nor is  
it less so, i bat penal enactments should  
be provided for cases of con upt and  
pernaious intercourse wun me enemy,  
not amounting to treason, nor yet em  
braced by any statutory provisions.  
A considerable number of American  
vessels, which were in England when  
the revocation of the orders in council  
took place, were laden with British ma  
nufactures, under an erroneous impres­  
sion that the nonimportation act would  
immediately cease to operate, and have  
arrived in : the United States, r Itdid  
not appear proptr to exercise, oh un  
foreseen cases of such magnitude, the  
ordinary powers vested in the &#x27;treasury

fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
and Home of Representatives,  
. On our present meeting it is mv first duty  
to invite your attention to the Providential  
favors which our country has experienced, in  
the unusual degree of health dispensed to its  
inhabitants, and in the rich abundance with  
&quot; Which the earth has rewarded the labours bes­  
&#x27;&#x27; - towed on it. .. In the successful cultivation of  
Other branches of industry, and in the progress  
of general improvement favourable to the na­  
tional prosperity, there is just occasion also,  
for bur mutual congratulations and thankful­  
ness.&#x27; -  
&#x27; With these blessings are necessarily min­  
gled the pressures and vicissitudes incidental  
to the stale of war into which the United States  
havf been forced by the perseverance of a fo­  
reign power, in hs system of injustice and ag-  
. gressioo. . l?f&#x27;;:  
Previous to its declaration, it was deemed  
proper as a measure of precaution and fore  
cast, that a considerable force should be placed  
in the Michigan territory, with a general viejw  
toils security, and, in the event of war, to such  
operations in the uppermost Canada as would  
intercept the hostile influence of Great Britain  
Over the savages,- obtain the command of the  
lake on which that part of Canada borders, &amp;  
maintain co-operating relations with such for-  
- ces as nvghtbe most conveniently en-ployed  
against other parts. Brigadier-General Hull  
Was charged with this provisional service;  
having under his command a body of troops  
composed of regulars and of volunteers fom  
.... the State of Ohio. Having reached his de.  
tination after his . knowledge of the war, and  
possessing discretionary authority to act offen­  
sively, he passed into the neighbouring terri­  
tory of the enemy with a prospect of easy and  
victorious progress. The expedition never­  
theless terminated unfortunately, not only in a  
retreat to the town and fort of Detroit, but in  
the surrender of both, and of the gallant corps  
commanded by that officer. The causes of  
this painful reverse will be investigated by a  
military tribunal.  
A distinguishing feature in the operations  
. &#x27;Which preceded and fallowed this adverse e­  
rent, is the use made by the enemy of the mcr  
ciless savages under their influence. Whilst  
the benevolent policy of the United States,  
invariably recomjnended peace and promoted  
civilization, among that wretched portion of  
the human race ; and was making exertion  
to dissuade them from taking either side in  
the war, he enemy has not scrupled to call to  
h&#x27;s aid thir ruthless ferocity, armed with the  
horrors of those instruments of carnage :.nd  
torture, which are known to spare neither .ng:  
tor s:x. In this outrage against the laws of  
honourable war, and against the feelings sa­  
cred to humanity, the British commanders  
cau: . t resort to a plea of retaliation ; for it is  
Committed in the face of our example. They  
cannot mitigate it, by calling it a self defence  
against men in arms ; for it embraces the most  
shocking butcheries of defenceless families  
Nor can it be pretended that they are not an­  
awerabls for the atrocities perpetrated ; since  
the savages are employed with a knowledge,  
and even with menaces, that their fury could  
rSotbe controlled. Such is the spectaHe which  
,the deputed authorities of a nation, boasting  
hs religion and morality, have not been res­  
1 trained from presenting to an enlightened age.  
The misfortunn at Detroat was not, howe­  
Ver, without a consoling effect. , It was fol­  
lowed by sima! proofs, that the national spirit  
dies according to the prassufe.qn it. , Ths  
  
Ins of an important post, and of the brave men  
surrendered with it, inspired every where new  
arjor and dctermitatkm. In the states and  
  
districts least remotei it was no sooner known,  
  
thaa every citizen was ready to fly with his  
arms, at once -to protect his brethren against  
the blood-thirsty savages let loose by the ene­  
my on an extensive frontier and to convert  
a partial calamity into a source of invigorated  
efforts. This patriotic zeal, which it was ne­  
cessary rather to limit than excite, has embo­  
died an ample force from the states of Ken­  
tucky and Ohio, and from parts of Pennsylva­  
nia and Virginia. It is placed, with the addi  
  
tion of a few regulars, under the command of  
  
lir igad 1 er-Genrral Harrison, whv possesses  
the entire confidence of his fellow soldier, a  
mong whom are citizens, some of them volun­  
teers in the ranks, not less distinguished bv  
their political stations, than by their personal  
merits. The greater portion of this force is  
proceeding on its destination, towards the Mi­  
chigan territory, hiving succeedrd in relieving  
an important frontier post, and in several in­  
cidental operations against hostile tribes of  
savages, rendered indispensable by the subser­  
viency into which they had been seduced by  
the enemy ; a seduction the more cruel, as it  
could not fail to impose a necessity of precau­  
tionary severities, against those who yielded  
to it.  
At a recent date, an attack was made on a  
post of the enemy near Niagara, by a drtach­  
roeat of the regular and other forces, under  
the command of major general Van Renssa­  
lier of the militia of. the state rf Ntw-Yorki  
The attack it appears, was ordered in compli­  
ance with the ardor of the troops who execut­  
ed it with distinguished gallantry, and were  
for a time victorious, but not receiving the ex­  
pected Support they w.re compelled to yield  
10 reinforcements of British regulars and sa­  
vages. Our loss has been considerable and i:t  
deeply to be lamented. That of the enemy,  
less ascertained, will be the more felt, as it in­  
cludes among the killed the commanding ge­  
neral, who was also the Governour of the Pro­  
vince 1 and .was sustained by veteran troops  
from unexperienced soldiers, who roust daily  
improve in the duties of the field.  
Oiirexpectatio&#x27;ft of gaining the command  
of the lakes, by the invasion of Canada fr m  
Detroit, having been disappointed, measures  
were instantly taken to provide, on them, a  
naval force superiour to that of the enemy.  
From the talents and activity, of the officer  
charged with this object, every thing that can  
be done may be expected. Should the pre­  
sent season not admit uf complete success,  
the progress made will ensure for the next a  
naval ascendency, where it is essential to cur  
permanent peace with, and controul over, the  
savages.  
Among the incidents to the, measures of the  
war, I am constrained to advert to the refusal  
of the Governcursof Martachusetts&#x27;and Con­  
necticut, to furnish the required detachment  
tf militia towards the defence of the maritime  
frontier. The refusal was founded on a no­  
vel and ur.f rtunate expositic o of the provisi­  
ons of the constitution, relating to the militia.  
The correspondences which will be b: fore you  
contain the requisite information on the sub­  
ject. It is obvious, that if the authority cf  
ill United States to call into service and  
command the militia for the public defence,  
can be thus frustrated, even in a state cf de­  
clared war, and of course under apprehen­  
sions of invasion preceding war, they are  
ot one nation for the purpose most of all re­  
qur:ng it ; and that the public safety may  
have no other resource, than n those large &amp;  
j.-rmanent military establishments which are  
forbidden by the principles of our free govern­  
ment, a id against the necessity of which the  
militia were meant to be a constitutional bul­  
wark.On the coasts, and on the ocean, the war  
has been as successful as circumstances inse­  
parable from its early stages could promise.&#x27;  
Our pubiic ships and private eruizers, by their  
acciviiy, and, where there was occasion, by  
their intrepidity, have made the enemy sensi­  
ble ol the difference between a reciprocity of  
captures, and the, long confinement .of them  
to their side. Our trade, with little excep­  
tion, has safely reached our ports ; having  
ber-n muchrfavoored in it by the course pur­  
sued by a squadron f our frigates, under the  
command of Commodore Rodgers. Ai d in  
the instance, in which skill and bravery were  
more particularly tried with those of the tnc  
my, the American flag had an auspicious  
triumph. The frigate Constitution, com­  
manded by Captain Hull, after a close and  
short engagement, completely disabled and  
captured a British frigate ; gaining for that of­  
ficer and all on board, a praise which cannot  
be too liberally bestowed ; not merely for the  
victory actually achieved, but for that prompt  
a. d cool exertion of commanding talents,  
which, giving to courage its highest character,  
and to the force applied its full effect, proved  
that more could have been done in a contest  
requiring more.  
Anxious to abridge the evils from which a  
state of war cannot be exempt,, I lost no time  
after it was declared in conveji- gto the Bri­  
tish government the terms on which its pro­  
gress might be arrested, without awaiting the  
delays of a formal and final pacification. And  
our charge d&#x27;affaii es at London was, at the  
same time, authorised to agree to au armistice  
founded upon them. These terms required,  
that the orders in council should be repealed  
as Vhey affected the United States Without a  
  
revival cf. blockade! violating acknowledged  
rules ; that there should be aa ira mediate dis­  
charge; of American seamen from British  
ships ; and a stop to Impressments from A  
merica.i ships, with an understanding that an  
exclusion of the seamen of each nation from  
the ships of the other should be stipulated  
and that the armistice should be improved into  
a definitive and comprehensive adjustment  
of depending controversies. Although a re­  
peal of the orders susceptible of explanations  
meeting the views of this government, had ta  
  
ken place before this pacific advance wis com­  
municated to that of Great-Britain, the ad­  
vance was declined, from an avowed repug­  
nance to a suspension of the practice of im­  
pressment during the armistice, and without  
any intima:ion that the arrangement proposed  
with respect to sramyn would be accepted.  
Wheth.-r the subsequent communications  
from this government, affording an occasion  
for re-considering ths subject, on the part of  
G-eat Britain, will be viewed in a more favor­  
able light, or received in a more accommodat­  
ing spirit, remains to be known. It would be  
unwise to relax our mrasures, in any respect,  
ou a presumption of such a result.  
The documrnts from the Department of  
State, which relate to this subject, will give a  
vtew als ) of the propositions for an atmistice,  
which have been received here, one of them  
from the authoritirs at Halifax and Canada,  
the other from the British government itself,  
through admiral WaTren ; and of the grounds  
upon which neither of them could be accepted.  
Our atuirs with France retain the posture  
whirh they held at my last communications to  
  
you. IN ot withstanding the authorised expec  
  
tation of an early as well as favorable issue to  
the discussions on foot ; these have been pro­  
crastinated to the latest date. The only in­  
tervening occurence meriting attention, is the  
promulgation of a French Decree purporting  
to be a definitive repeal of the Berlin and Mi­  
lan decrees. This proceeding, although made  
the ground of the repeal of the British orders  
in council, is rendered by the time and man­  
ner of it, liable to many objections.  
The final communications from our special  
Minister to Denmark, afford further proofs of  
the good effects of his mission, and of the a­  
miable disposition of the Danish government.  
Vrom Russia we have the satisfaction to re-  
  
c-ive assurances of continued friendship, and  
that it will not be affected by the rupture be­  
tween the U. States and G. Britain. Sweden  
also professes sentiments favorable to the sub­  
sisting harmony. 1  
With the Barbary powers, excepting that of  
Algiersour affairs remain on the ordinary  
footing. The Consul General residing with  
that Ur gehev, has suddenly, and without cause, i  
been baoished, together with all the Ameri­  
can citizens found thejreWhether this as  
the transitory effect of capricious despotism,  
or the first act of predetermined hostility, is  
not ascertained. Precautions were taken by  
the Consul, on the latter supposition.  
The Indian tribes, not under foreign insti­  
gations, remain at peace, and receive the civi­  
lising attentions, which have proved so bene  
ficial to them.  
With a view to that vigorous prosecution of  
tiie war to which our national faculties are  
adequate, the attention of Congress will be  
particularly drawn to the insufficiency of the  
existing provisions for fillirg up the military  
establishment. Such is the happy condition of  
our country, arising from the facility of subsis­  
tence and the high wages for every species of  
occupation,, that notwithstanding the augment­  
ed inducements provided at the last session, a  
partial success only has&amp;ttended the recruit  
ing service. The deficiency has been neces­  
sarily supplied during the campaign, by other  
than regular troops, with all the inconveniences  
and expences incident to them. The remedy  
lies, in establishing, &#x27;more favorably for the  
private soldier, the proportion between his re­  
compense and the term of his enlistment.  
And it is a subject which cannot too soon or  
too seriously be taken into consideration.  
The same insufficiency has beenjexperienc  
ed in the provisions for volunteers made by  
an act of the last session. The, recompence  
for the service required in this case, is still  
less attractive than in the other And al­  
though patriotism alone tias sent into the field  
some valuable corps of that description, those  
alone who can afford the sacrifice, can reason­  
ably be expected to yield, to that impulse  
It will merit consideration also, whether as  
auxiliary to the security of ouf frontier, corps  
may not be, advantageously organised, with a  
restriction of their services to particular dis­  
tricts convenent4to them. ,And whether the  
local and occasional services of mariners and  
others in the seaport towns, under a similar  
organization, would not be a provident addi­  
tion to the means of their defence.  
I recommend a provision for an increase of  
the general officers of the army, the deficiency  
of which has been illustrated by the number  
and distance of separate commands, which the  
course of the war apd the advantage of the  
service have required.  
And I cannot press too strongly, on the  
earliest attention of the Legislature, the im­  
portance of the re-organization of the staff es­  
tablishment with a view to render tnore dis­  
tinct and definite the relations and, responsi­  
bilities of its several departments. That  
there is room for improvements which will  
materially promote both cscononr.&#x27; and success,  
in What appertains to ths army and ths war,  
  
is c anally Inculcated by the exaronU-a , r .  
  
countries, and by ths experience tf cm  
A revision cf the militia laws for ul c -T  
  
pose 01 renaerieg them more systematic -  
better adapting them to emergenciticf 5  
war, is at this time particularly deiirallt.  
Of the additional ships authorised to it t  
ted for service, two will be shortly rei-r L  
sail j a third under repair, and delav I&#x27;m . .  
  
voided in the repair of the residue. Of  
appropriation for the purchase of watrra!,  
for ship-building, the rreater t art hi. YL  
  
applied to that objret, and the purthjts  
be continued with the balance  
The. enterprisirg spirit which fcis charj.  
terized our naval force, and its success both ia  
restraining insults and drpredations on cur  
coasts, and in reprisals on the enemy, m 0t  
fail to recommend an enlargement of it.  
There being reason to believe that the set  
prohibiting the acceptance of British licen:f ?  
is not a sufficient guard against the qseof t!.f  
f r purposes favorable to the interests 81 vi t  
of the enemy i further provisions on thauU).  
j-ct are highly important. Nor is it let sq,  
that penal enactments should be provided for  
casts of corrupt and perfidious , intercourse  
with the enemy, not amounting fc treason, tot  
yet embraced by any statutory provisions.  
A considerable number of American vessck  
which were in hngland when the revocation,  
of the Orders in Council took place, were li.  
den with British manufactures, under an tu  
roneous impression that the non-importa&#x27;aos  
act would immediately cease to operate,&#x27; and  
hive arrived in the U. S. It did not appear  
proper to exercise, on ufiforseen cases of such  
magnitude, the ordinary powers vested ia the  
treasury department to mitigate forfeiture!,  
without previously affording vto Congress aa  
opportunity of making on the subject such  
provision as they may think proper. , To their  
decision they will doubtless equally . cpnsu!t  
what is due to equitable considerations and to  
the public interest.  
The receipts into the treasury, .during ths  
  
year ending on the 30th of September last,  
have exceeded sixteen millions and a half of  
dollars : which have been sufficient to dtfrav  
  
all the demands on the treasury to that day,  
including a necessary reimbursement of sear  
three millions of the principal bf the public  
debt. In these receipts W included a sura of  
near S5 5,850,000, received qn account of the  
loans authorised by the acts f the last session;  
the whole sum actually obtained on loan  
mounts to 11 millions of dollars, the residue  
  
of which, b. ing receivable&#x27; subsequent to tht  
  
30th of September last, will, together with the  
current revenue, enable us to defray all the  
expences of this year. N&quot;,v  
The duties on the late unexpected imports.  
  
uons ot British manufactures, will render the  
  
revenue of the ensuing year more productive  
than could have been anticipated. ;k  
The situation of our country,fellow-citizens,  
is not wi thout its difficultiesthough it  
abounds in animating considerations, of which,  
the view here presented of our pecuniary re.  
  
sources is an example. With more than one  
  
nation, we have serious and unsettled contro­  
versies and with one, poweiful in the means  
and habits of war, we are at war. The spirit  
and strength of this nation are . nevertheless  
  
equal to the support of alt its rights, and to  
carry it through all its trials. ; 1 hey can  
  
met in that eoundence. Above all, we auv&#x27;  
the inestimable consolation of &#x27; knowingi that  
  
the war in which we are actually engaged is  
war neither of ambition nor of vain glory that  
it is waged, not in violation of the frights of  
others, but in the maintenance of euro wu; ;  
that it was preceded by a patience without ex­  
ample, under wrongs accumulating ) Without .  
end and that it was finally not declared until J  
every hope of averting it was extinguished, by ;  
the transfer of the British sceptre into new  
hands clinging to former councils -and until  
declarations were reiterated to the last hour,  
through the British envoy here, that the hostile ;  
edicts against our commercial rights and cut  
maritime independence-, would not be ri vcl  
ed ; nay, that they could not be revoked, with­  
out violating the obligation of Great Britain

and good anchorage ; the banks on both  
  
ed porlien of the human race and was  
making exertions to dissuade them frrm  
taking either side in the war, the enemy  
has not scrupled to Call to his aid their  
ruthless ferocity, armed with the horrors  
of those instruments cf carnage and torture  
which are known to spare neither age nor  
-ex. In this outrage aeainst the laws of  
honorable war, and against the feelings sa-  
cred to humanity, the British commanders  
cannot resort to a plea of retaliation : for  
is committed in the face of our example.  
They cannot mitigate it, by calling it a  
self-defence against men in arms : for it  
embraces the most sht eking butcheries of  
defenceless families Nor can it he pre-  
re tided that thev are not answerable for  
be attrocities perpetrated ; since the sa-  
-ages are employed with a knowledge and  
even w ith menaces, that their fury could  
not be controlled. St-cb is the spectacle  
wtiirh the deputed authorities of a nation,  
boasting its religion and morali-y, have not  
been restrained, from presenting to an en-  
lightened age.  
  
The misfortune at Detroit, was not. how  
ever, without a cotiscl-ng effect. It was  
followed by signal pro r fs. that the national  
-pirit rises according to the pre sure on it.  
The loss of an important post, atid of the  
brave men surrendered with it. inspired  
everv where new ardor and determination.  
In the stales and district least remote, it  
was no sooner known, than every citizen  
was ready to flv with his arms, at once to  
protect his brethren against the blood thirs-  
ty savages let loose bv the enemy on an ex  
tensive frontier ; and to convert a partial  
calamity, into a source of invigorated ef  
Ions. This patriotic zeal, which it was  
necessary rather to limit than excite, has  
embodied an ample force from the states ot  
Kentucky dc Ohio, and from parts of Penn-  
sylvania and Virginia. It is placed, with  
the addition of a few regulars, under the  
command of Brigadier General Harrison ;  
who possesses the entire confidence of his  
feilow soldiers, among whom are citizens,  
,-ome of them volunteers in the ranks, not  
1 less distinguished by their political stations,  
than bv their personal merits. The great-  
j er portion of this force is proceeding on its  
| destination, towards the Michigan territo-  
| rv, having succeeded in relieving an im-  
! putt ant frontier post, and in several inci-  
| dental operations against hostile tribes of  
savages, rendered indispensable by the  
j subserviency into which they had been se  
dttced hy the enemy, a seduction the more  
cruel, as it could not fail to impose a ne-  
cessity of precautionary severities, against  
j those who yielded to it.  
  
At a recent date, an attack was made  
on a post of the enemy near Niagara, by a  
detachment of the regular and other forces  
under the command of major general Van  
Ranssa.laer of the militia of the state of  
New York. The attack, it appears, was  
ordered in compliance with the ardor of  
the troops, who executed it with distin  
guished gallantry, and were for a time vic-  
torious ; but not receiving the expected  
support they were compelled to yield to  
reinforcements of Britirh regulars and sa  
vages. Our loss has been considerable  
and is deeply to be lamented. That of the  
euemy, less ascertained, will be the more  
felt, as it includes among the killed, the  
commanding general, who was also the  
governor of the province ; and was sus-  
tained hy veteran troops, from unexperi-  
enced soldiers, who must daily improve  
in the duties of the field.  
  
Our expectation of gaining the command  
of the lakes, by the invasion of Canada  
from Detroit, having been disappointed,  
measures were instantly taken to provide  
on them a naval forcesnpericr to that of the  
enemy. From the talents and activity cf  
the officer charged with this object, everv  
thing that can be done, mav be expected.  
Should the present season not admit of com-  
plete success, the progress made will en-  
sure for the next a naval ascendancy, where  
it is essential to onr permanent peace with  
and control over the savages.  
  
Among the incidents to the measures of  
the war, I am constrained to advert to the  
refusal of the governors of Massachusetts  
and Connecticut, tn furnish the required  
detachments of militia towards the defence  
of the maritime frontier. The refusal was  
founded on a novel and unfortunate exposi-  
tion of the provisions of the constitution re-  
lating to the militia. The correspondences  
which will be before you, contain the re-  
quisite information nn the subject. It is  
obvious, that if the authority of the United  
States to call into service and command  
the militia for the public defence, can be  
thus frustrated, even in a state of declared  
war, and of course under apprehensions of  
invasion preceding war ; they are not one  
nation for the purpose most of all requiring  
it ; and that the public safety may have no  
other resource, than in those large and per-  
manent military establishments which are  
forbidden by the principles of our free gov-  
ernment, and against the necessity of which  
the militia were meant tobe a constitutional  
bulwark.  
  
On the coast, and on the ocean, the war  
has been as successful as circumstances iu,  
separable from its early stngeis could pr’c in-  
ise. Our public ships and private cruisers  
by their activity, and, where there was  
occasion, by their intrepidity, have made  
the enemy sensible of the diffeicnce between  
a reciprocity of captures, and the long con-  
finement of them totheir side. Our trade,  
with little exception, has safelv rearhed  
our ports ; having been much favored in it  
by the course pursued by a squadron of our  
trigates under the command of com. Hod-  
gers. And in the finance in which skill &amp;  
bravery were n\pre particularly tried tviib  
those of the enemy, the American flag had  
an auspicious triumph. The frigate Con-,  
stitution, commanded hy capt. Hull, afeero  
a close and short engagement. Completely  
disabled and -captured a British frigate;  
gaining for that officer and ail on board a  
prase which cannot be too liberally bestow-  
ed ; not merely for the victory actually a-  
chieved. but for that prompt and &lt;■•«,! exer-  
tion of commanding talents, which, giving  
to courage its highest character, and to the  
force applied its full effect, proved that  
more could have been done in a contest re-  
quiring more.  
  
Anxious to abridge the evils from which a  
state of war cannot be exempt, I lost no time, af-  
ter was declared, in conveying to the British  
government the terms on which its progress  
might be arrested.-without awaiting the delays  
of a formal and final pacification. And our  
charge d’aflau-9 at London wain at the same |  
  
time, authorised to agree dtj an armistice foun-  
ded upon them. These terms required that  
the orders in council should be repealed as  
they affected the United States, without a revi-  
val of blockades violating acknowledged i-ules^  
that there should be an immediate discharge  
of American seamen from British ships, and a  
stop to impressments from American ships,  
with an understanding that an exclusion of die  
seamen from each nation from the ships of the  
other, should be stipulated ; and that the ar-  
mistice should be improved into a definitive  
and comprehensive adjustment ol depending  
controversies. Although a repeal of the orders  
susceptible of explanations meeting the views  
of this government, had taken place before this  
pacific advance was communicated to that of  
Great Britain, the advance was declined, from  
an avowed repugnance to a suspension of the  
practice of impressment, during the armistice^  
and without any intimation tliat the arrange,  
ment proposed with respect to seamen would  
be accepted. Whether tbe subsequent com-  
munications from this government, affording  
an occasion for re considering the subject, ofi  
the part of Great Britain, will be viewed in a  
more favorable light, or received in a moreac,  
oommodating spfi it, remains to be known,  
would be unwise to relax our measures, in any  
respect, on a presumption of such a result.  
  
The documents from the Department of State,  
which relate to this subject, will give a view  
also of the ,Vopositions for an armistice, which  
have neen received here, one of them from the  
authorities at Halifax and in Canada, the other  
from the British government itself, through  
admiral Warren ; and of the grounds upon  
which neither of them could be accepted.  
  
Our affairs with France retain the posture  
which they held at mv last communications to  
you. Notwithstanding the authorised expec-  
tation of an parly as well as favorable issue to  
the discussions on foot, these have been pro-  
crastinated to the latest date. The only inter-,  
vetting occurrence meriting attention, is the  
promulgation of a French decree, purporting  
to be a definitive repeal of the Berlin and Mi-  
lan drcrec-a. This proceeding, although made  
the ground of the repeal of the British order*  
in council, is rendered, by the lime and man-  
ner of it. liable to many objections.  
  
The final communications from our special  
Minister to Denmark, afford further proofs of  
the good effects of h is mission, and the amica-  
ble disposition of the Danish government.—  
From Russia we have the satisfaction to receive  
assurances of continued friendship, and that it  
will not be affected by the rupture between  
the Hnited States and Great Britain. Sweden  
also professes sentiments favorable to the sub-  
sisting harmony.  
  
With the Barbary powers, excepting that of  
Algiers, our affairs remain on the ordinary  
footing. The Consul General, residing with  
the Regency, has suddenly and without cause  
been banished, together with all the American  
citizens found there. Whether this was the  
transitory effect of capricious despotism, or the  
first act of predetermined hostility, is not as-  
certained. Precautions were taken by the Con  
sul, on the latter supposition.  
  
The Indian tribes, not under foreign instiga-  
tions, remain at peace, and receive the civilis-  
ing attentions, which luve proved sr beneficial  
to *hcm.  
  
With a view to that vigorous prosecution of  
the war, to which our national faculties are ad-  
equate, the attention of Congress will be par-  
ticularly drawn to the insufficiency of the ex-  
isting provisions for filling up the military es-  
tablishment. Such is the happy condition of  
our country, arising from tbe facility of subsis-  
tence and the high wages for every&quot; species of  
occupation, that notw ithstanding the augment-  
ed inducements provided at the last session,  
a partial success only has attended the recruit-  
ing service. The deficiency has been necessari-  
ly supplied, during the campaign, by other than  
regular troops with all the inconveniences and  
expenses incident to them. The remedy lies  
in establishing, more favorable for the private  
soldier, the proportion between his rccmnpence  
and the term of his enlistment. And it is a  
subject which cannot too soon or too seriously  
be taken into consideration.  
  
The same insufficiency has been experienced  
in the provisions for volunteers made by n act  
of the last session The recompence for the  
service required in this ease, is still less attrao-  
tive than in the other. And although patriot-  
ism alone has sent into the field some valuable  
corps of that description, those alone who can  
afford the sacrifice can be expected to yield tn  
that impulse.  
  
It will merit consideration also, whether, a?  
auxiliary to the security of our frontier, corps  
may not be advantageously organized, with a  
restriction of their services to particular dis-  
tricts convenient to them. And whether the  
local and occasional services of mariners and  
others in tlie sea-port towns, under a similar  
organization, would not be a provident addition  
to the means of their defence.  
  
I recommend a provision for an increase of  
die general officers of the armv, the deficiency  
of u&#x27;hicli lias bepn illustrated&quot; by the number  
and distance of separate commands, which tlie  
•ourse of the war and the advantage of the ser-  
vice has required.  
  
And I cannot press too strongly on the ear-  
liest attention of the Legislature the impor-  
tance of the re-organization of the staff estab-  
lishment; with a view to render more distinct  
and definitive the relations and responsibili-  
ties of its several departments. That there is  
room for improvements which w ill materially  
promote both economy and success, in what  
appertains to the army and tlie war, is equally  
inculcated by the examples of other countries  
and by the experience of our own,  
  
A revision of the militia laws for the pur-  
pose of rendering them more s_\ nematic, and  
better adapting&#x27; them to emergencies of the-,  
war, is at this time particularly desirable.  
  
Of the additional ships authorised to be fit-  
ted for service, two will be shortly ready to sail ;  
a lliirel is under repair; and delay &quot;will be  
avoided in the repair of the residue. Of the  
appropriations for the purchase of materials  
for ship-building, the greaterpart has been ap-  
plied to that object, and the purchases will be  
continued with the balance.  
  
I lie enterprising spirit w hich has character-,  
i zed our naval force, and its jutetss both if.  
restraining insults and depredations on oui  
coasts, and in reprisals on tlie enemv, will no(-  
tail to recommend an enlargement of it.  
  
There being reason to believe that tlie act  
prohibiting the acceptance of British licences  
is net a sufficient guard against the use of  
them for purposes favorable to the interests  
and views ot tlie enemy ; further provisions on  
that subject are highly important. Nor is it  
less so, that penal enactments should be pro-  
vided for cases of corrupt. and perfidious intciv  
course with the enemy, not amounting to trea-  
son, noryet embraced by any statutory provi-  
sion!.  
  
A considerable number of American vessels,  
which were in Kngland when the revocation of  
tlie orders in council took* place, were laden  
with British manufactures, under an errone-  
ous impression that the non importation act  
would immediately cease to operate, and have  
arrived in tire. U State* J-. did ; u t *{%*/*•

opportunity of making on the subject such pro-  
vision as they may think proper. In their  
decision they will doubtless equally consult  
what s due to equitable considerations and to  
the public interest.  
  
The receipts into the treasury, during the  
year ending on the 3Uth of September last, have  
exceeded sixteen millions and a half of dollars ;  
Winch have been sufficient to defray all tne  
demands on the treasury to that day , including  
a necessary reimbUrsrnent of near three mil-  
lions of the principal of the public debt. In  
these receipts is included a sum of near

versies ; and with one, powerful in the means  
and habits of war, we are at war. The spirit  
and strength of this nation are, nevertheless,  
equal to tne support of all its rights, and to  
carry it through all its trials. They can be  
met m that confidence Above all, we have  
the inestimable consolation of knowing that  
the war in which we are actually engaged, is a  
War neither of ambition nor of vain glory ; that  
it is waged, not in violation of the rights of  
otners, but in the maintenance of our own ;  
that it was preceded by a patience witiiou ex-  
ample, under wrongs accumulating without  
end; and that it was finally not declared until  
every hope of averting it was extinguished,  
by the transfer of tiie British sceptre into new  
builds clinging to former councils , and until  
declarations weic reiterated to the last hour,  
through the British envoy here, that the hos-  
tile edicts against our commercial rights and  
our maritime independence, would not be i evok-  
ed ; nay, that they could not be revoked with-  
•ut violating the obligations of Great-Ui itain  
to otiier powers, as well as to-lierowu interests.  
To have shrunk, under such circumstances,  
from manly resistance, would have been a de-  
gradation blasting our best and proudest  
hopes : It would Lave struck us from the high  
rank, where the virtuous struggles of our fa-  
thers hud placed us, and have betrayed the  
magnificent legacy which we hold in trust for  
future general ions. It would have acknowl-  
edged that on the clement which forms three-  
fourths of tiie globe we inhabit, and where all  
independent nations have equal and common

pendent people, but colonists arid vassals. It  
was at this moment, and with such an alterna-  
tive, that War was chosen. The nation felt the  
necessity ol it and called for it. The appeal  
was accordingly made, ill a just cause, to the  
just and All-powerful Being who holds in his  
hand the chain of events and the destiny of na-  
tions. it remains only, that, faithful to our-  
selves, entangled in no connections with the  
views ol other powers, and ever ready to accept  
peace from the hand of justice, we prosecute the  
war with united councils, and, with the ample fa-  
culties ol the nation, until peace be so obtain-  
ed, and as the only means, under the divine

“ VVith a view to that vigorous prosecu­

gres* wilt be particularly drawn to the in­

from the facility of tub listener und the high

notwithstanding tne augmented inducements

supplied during the campaign, by other

bern restrained from presenting to an enlightened nae  
  
The misfortune at Detroit was not, how ever, without a con.  
soling effect. Lt was followed by signal proofs, that the national  
spirit rises according to the pressure onit, The lass of an im-  
portant post, aud the brave men surrendered with it aspired  
every Where new ardour and determina:ion. 1. the stales and  
distticts most remote, it was no sooner know n, than every ci-  
lizen was eager to fly wéth his arms at once to protect his  
brethren against the blood-thirsty savages let loose hy the ene-  
my on an extensive frontier; ahd w convert a partial calamity  
into a source of invigorated eforts, This patriotic zeal, which  
it was necessary rather to limit than excite, bas embodied au  
umple force from the States af Kentucky and Ohio, and from  
parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia, It is placed, with the ad-  
dition of a few regulars, under the command of Brigadier-Gen.,  
Harrison, who possesses the emire canfidence of his fellow sol-  
diers ; among whom are citizens—some of them valunteers in  
the ranks—not less distinguished by their political stations  
by their personal merits, ’  
  
The greater portion of this force is proceeding on its destina-  
tion towards the Michigan territory, having succeeded in re-  
lieving an iwportant frontier post, and in several incidental  
operations against hostile tribes of savages, rendered indispen-  
sible Wy the subserviency into which they had been seduced by  
the enemy ; a seduction the more cruel, as it could nut fail tw  
impose a necessity of precautionary seveyilies against those who  
yielded to it, |  
  
Ata recent date, .an attack wag made ona post of the ene-  
  
my near Niagora, by a detachmem of the regular and other  
forces, under the command of Major-Gen, Van Reusselacr, of  
the inilitia of the State of New-York, The attack, it pppears,  
was eardered in compliance with the ardour of the troaps, who  
exe ated it with distinguished gallantry, and were for a time  
victorious; but net receiving the expected support, they were  
compelled to yield to reinforcements of British regulars and sae  
wager, Our loss has been considerable, apd is deeply te be la-  
meuted, That of the enemy, less aycertained, will be the more  
felt, as it inclades among the killed the Commanding General,  
who was also Governor of the Province ¢ and was sustained hy  
veleran troops, from inexperienced soldiers, wha myst daily  
improve in the duties of the field,  
: Our expectation of gainipg the command of the Lakes by the  
invasion «of Canada from Detroit, having been disappointed,  
memes were instantly taken to provide on them a naval force  
superior to that of the enemy, From the talents and activity  
of the officer charged with this ohjeet, eyery thing that can be  
done may be expected, Should the pre-ent season not admit of  
complete suceess, the progress made will ensure for the next a  
avast aseendaney where it ig essential, io a permaveht peace  
with and a controul over the savages,  
  
Among the incidents to the measures of the war, | am con-  
straived to advert to the refusal of the Gavernors of the Massa-  
chussetts and Connecticut, to furnish the required detachments  
of militia towards the defence of the maritime frontier, The  
refusal was founded an a novel and yofortugate exposijion of  
the provisions of the Constitution relating to thé militia, The  
votrespondence which will be before you, contain the requisite  
infarmation on the subject, It is obvious, that if the awhority  
ofthe United States to call into service and command the militia  
for the public defence, can be thus frustrated, even ia a state  
of declared war, and of course ynder apprebeusions #f invasion  
preceding war, they.are nat one nation for the purpose most of  
all requiring it, and that the public safety may have nd other  
resource than thase large and permanent “ilitary establishments  
u hich are forbidden by the principles of our free Governmes!,  
and against the necessity of which the militia were meant to be

amd inthe instance in which skill and bravery were more pare  
ticulasty tried with these of the enemy, the American flag had  
an aaspicions triumph. The frigate Constitution, commanded  
thy Capt, Hull, after a close and short engagement, completely  
disabled and captured a British frigate ; gaining for that officer,

be repealed, as they affected the United States,» ithout a revival  
of the blockades viokuing acknowledged rales; thay there should  
bean immediate discharge ofAmericanseamen from British ships,  
and a step to impressments fram / meyicua ships, with an un.  
derstanding that an evelasion of the seamen of each nation from  
the ships of the other should be stipulated, and that the urine  
stice shauld be improved inty a detinitive and comprehensive  
adjustinent of depending Coutroversies,  
  
Although a repeal of the ordeps susceptible of explanations  
meeting the views of this Gaverament bad taken place before  
this pacitic advance was communicated to that of Great Bri-  
tain, the advance was declined from an avowed repugaance to  
a suspeision ef the practice of impresmpnt during the armi-~  
slice, and without avy iwihnation that the yyrangement pro~  
posed wjih respect to seamen would be acer pied, Whether  
the subsequent communications from this Gevernme.t, alerdiag  
an occasion for reconsitlering the sabject on the part of Geeag  
Britain, will be viewed in a more favourable light, an re-  
ceived in a more accommodating spirit, remains to be known,  
It would be unwise to release our measures, |v any respect, on  
a presumption of such a cesult,  @  
  
The decuments from the department of State, which relate  
to this subject, will give a view also of the proposltions furan  
Armistice, which have been received here,-—-éne of them from  
the authorities at Halifax and in Canadh, the ether from the

Notwithstandiag the authorised expectation of an early o»

been procrastinated to the latest date, © The’ only intervening  
occurrence meriting attention is the pramalgation of. a French  
decree, purporting to be a@ deflwitive repeal wf the Kerlin and  
Milan Decrees. This proceeding, although made the ground  
of the repeal of ile British’ (irders in Councit, is remiered, by  
the tune aud manner of it, liable tomany objections,

The Tpdian tribes, not ander foreign instigations, remain ot  
peace, and veceive the civilizing attentions which have proved  
30 bewsficiul to. them,  
  
With.a view to that vigorons proseeation of the war to  
which&quot; ‘our ‘national faculties are adequate, the attention of  
Congress will be particularly drawn ta the insufliciency of the  
existiig provisions for filling up the milifagy establishment,  
Such is the happy condition of ovr cauntry; arising from the  
facility of subsistenc?, and the high wages for every species of  
occupation, that, notwithstanding the augmented inducements  
provided at the‘ast session, a-partial success only has attended  
the recruiting service. The deficiency has heen necessarily  
supplicd during the campaign by other thaq regular troops,  
with all the inconvéniencies aid expences imcident-to them.  
The remedy lies in establishing tmoré favourably for the pri-  
vate soldier, the proportion between his recompence and the  
term of his enlistment: and it is a subject which cannot too  
soon or too seriously be taken into consideration, The same  
insufficiency has been experienced in the provisions for yolan-  
teers made ‘by an act of the last Session, The recompence for  
the service required in this casé, is still less attractive than in  
the other: and although patriotism alone has sent into the field  
some valuable corps of that description, those alone who can  
afford the sacrifice, can reasonably be expected to yield to the  
impulse. ft will merit consideration also, whether, as auxi-  
Jinry to the security of our frovtier, corps may not be advan-  
tageously organised, with, a resiriction: of their services to  
particular districts convenient to them; °and whether the Jocal  
or occasional services of marines of others in the sen port towns,  
under a similar organization, would not bea proper addition  
to the means of their defence, I recommend a provision for  
an increase of the General Officers of the Arnry, the deficiency  
of which has been illustrated by the number and distance of  
separaic commands, which the vanse of the war, and the ad.  
vantage of the service, have required; and 1 cansot press too  
strongky on the carliest attention of the Legislature, the impor-  
tance ofthe re-organigasion of the Staff Establishment, with a  
view to reuder more distinct and definite the relations amt  
responsibilities of its several departments: that there is room  
for improvements which will materially promote both economy  
and suecess, in what appertnins to the army and the war, is  
equally by the exaanples of other countries, and by the expe-  
rience of our own,  
  
A revision of the mae Laws, for the purpose of rendering  
them more systematic, and better adapting them to emergencies  
of the war, is at this time particularly desirable, OF the addi-  
tien! ships nuthorised to be fitted for servicer, two will be  
slorihy ready to sal, a third is under repair, aod delay will be  
avoided in the repair.of the residue. OF the appropriations for  
the purchase ‘of materials for. ship building, the greater part  
has been applied to that object, and the purchases will he con-  
tinued with the balance. The enterprising spirit which cha-  
racterized our naval force, and its success Loth in restraining  
insultsand depredations on eur coasts, and in reprisals onthe  
enemy, will not fail to cecommend an enlargement upon it,  
  
There heing reason to believe, that the Act prohibiting the  
aceeptauce of British licences is not a sufficient guard against  
the use of them, for pergoges favourable to the interests aod  
views of Atie enemy, further provisions on that subject are  
Highly important, Nor is it dess er, that pesal enactments  
should be previded for cases of corrupt nnd perfidions inter-  
course avith the enemy, not amounting to treason, nor yet em-  
braewd hy any statutery provisions,  
  
Aconsiderable namber of American vessels, whichwere in Eag-  
lund when the revocation of the Orders in Council took place,  
were taden with British manafactures, under an erroneous im-  
pression that the Non-binpartation Aet would immedintely cease  
(+ operate, have arrived in the United States. Tt did. vot  
  
appear proper to exercise on unforeseen cases of such magniiude,  
the ordinary powers vested tn the Treasury Department, to  
mitignie® forfeitures without previously affording Congress an  
epportinity of making-on the subject such provisions as they  
may think proper, «Tu their decision they. will, doubtless,

| The receipts in‘o the Treasury during the year ending on the  
| 30th of Sept, last, have exceeded 16 millions and a half dollars ;  
| which have been sufficient to defray all the demants on the  
| Treasury to that day, including a hevessary reimbursement of  
near three milleois of the principal of the public debt, Jp  
these receipts are included a sum of 8,850,000 received on  
acceunt of the loans authorised by the Acis of dast Session.  
The whole sum actually olitained on loan amounts to eleven  
millions of dollars, the residue of which being receivable  
subsequent to the 30th of September, will, together with  
the current revenue, enable us Jo defray all the expenses of this  
  
The duties of the late nnexpected importations of British  
manufactures will render the revenue of the ensiiing year more  
productive than could have been anticipated, The situation af  
our country, fellow citizens, is not with ut its diffcutties,  
though it abounds in animating considerations, of whieh the  
view here presented of our pecuniary resources is an example,  
With more than one nation we have serious aid unsettled  
controversies ; and wilh one, powerful in the means and habits  
  
. war, we are at war, The spirtt and strength of this nation  
kre nevertheless equal to the suppert of all ifs rights, and  
40 carry it through all its trials, They can be met in that  
confidence. Above all, we have the inestimable consolation of  
knowing, that the war in which we are actually engaged, is  
a war, neither of ambition nor vain slory; that it is waged,  
notin violation of the rights of others, but in the maintenance  
  
example, under wrongs accumulating without end 3 and that it  
was finally not declared, until every hope of averting it was  
extinguished by the transfer of the Britisty seeptres into new  
hands, clinging to former Councils, dnd until declarations were  
reiterated in the last hour through the British Eavoy here, that  
the hostile edicts against eur comufércial rights and our mari-  
time independence wowld not be revoked 5 ay, that they could  
not be revaked, without violating the obligations of Great Bri-  
fain to other Powers as well as to Her own Interests, To have  
shrunk under such circumstances from manly resistance, would  
have heen a degradation blasting oar best ‘and. proudest hopes,  
It would have struck us from fhe bigh rank whese the virtuous  
strugeles of our fathers had placed us, and have betrayed the  
magnificentlegaéy which we told in trust for future generation.  
lt would have acknowledged that on the&#x27;element which forms  
  
pendent nations have equul and common rights, the American  
people were not an independent people, but colonists and  
vassals,  
  
It was at thie moment, and with such an alternative, that  
war was chosen, The nation felt the necessity of it, and called  
forit, The appeal was accordingly made in a just cause,

Fellow Citizens of the Senute and House of  
Representatives,  
  
On our present meeting, it is my first  
duty to invite your attention to the provi-  
dential favours which onr country has ex-  
perienced in the unusual degree of health  
dispensed to its inhabitants, and in the rich  
abundance with which the earth has re-  
warded the labours bestowed on it. In the  
successful cultivation of other branches of  
industry, and in the progress of general  
lmproyement favourable to the national

prosperity, there is just occasion also for  
our mutual congratulations and thankful-  
ness. With these blessings are natural-  
ly mingled the pressures and vicissitudes  
incidental to the state of war, into which the  
United States have been forced by the per-  
severance of a Foreign Power in its system  
of injustice and aggression. Previous to  
its declaration, it was deemed proper, as a  
measure of precaution and forecast, that a  
considerable force should be placed in the  
Michigan territory, with a general view to  
its security; and, in the event of war, to  
such operations in the uppermost Ganada,.  
as would intercept the hostile influence of  
Great Britain over the savages; obtain the  
command of the lake on which that part of  
Canada borders; and maintain co-operat-  
ing relations with such forces as might be  
most conveniently employed against other  
parts. Brigadier-Gen. Hull was charged  
with this provisional service, having under  
his command a body of troops, composed of  
regulars and of volunteers from the state of  
Ohio: having reached his destination, after  
his knowledge of the war, and possessing  
discretionary authority to act offensively,  
he passed into the neighbouring territory  
of the enemy with a prospect of an easy  
and victorious progress. ‘The expedition,  
nevertheless, terminated unfortunately, not  
only in a retreat to the town and fort ot  
Detioit, but in the surrender of both, and  
of the gallant corps commanded by that  
Officer. The causes of this painful reverse  
will be investigated by a military tribunal.  
  
A distinguishing feature in the operations  
which preceded and followed this adverse  
event, is the use made by the enemy of the  
merciless savages under their influence.  
Whilst the benevolent policy of the United  
States invariably recommended peace, and  
promoted civilization amongst that wretch-  
ed portion of the human race, and was  
making exertions to dissuade them from  
taking either side in the war, the enemy  
has not scrupled to call to his aid their  
ruthless ferocity, armed with the horrors  
of those instruments of carnage and torture  
Which are known to spare neither age nor  
sex. Inthis outrage against the laws of  
honourable war, and against the feelings  
sacred to humanity, the British Command-  
  
  
  
  
  
ers cannot resort toa plan of retaliation’;  
  
for it is committed in the face of our ex-  
ample. They cannot mitigate it by calling  
it a self-defence against men in arms, for it  
embraces the most shocking butcheries of  
delenceless families; nor cau it be pretend-  
ed that ‘they are not answerable for the

atrocities perpetrated, since the savages are  
employed with the knowledge, and even  
with menaces, that their fury could not be  
controled. Stich is the spectacle which the  
deputed ‘authorities of a nation, boasting  
its religion and morality, have not been re-  
strained from presenting to an enlightened  
age. The ‘misfortune at Detroit was  
not, however, without a consoling effect.  
It was followed by signal proofs that the  
national spirit rises according to the pres-  
sure on it. ~ The loss of an important-post,  
and of the brave men surrendered with it,  
inspired every where new ardour and ce-  
termination. In the states and districts  
least remote, it was no sooner known, than  
every Citizen was eager to fly with his  
arms at once to protect his brethren against  
the blood-thirsty savages let loose by the  
enemy on an extensive frontier; and to  
convert a partiai calamity into a source of  
invigorated eHorts. © This patriotic zeal,  
which it was necessary rather to limit than  
excite, f:as embodied an ample force from  
the states of Kentucky and Ohio, and from  
parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia.

placed, with the addition of a few regulars, |  
  
under  
Harrison, who possesses the entire confi-  
dence’ oi his fellow-soldiers ; among whom  
are cilizeus, some of them volunteers in the  
ranks, not less distinguished by their poli-  
tical stations than by their personal merits.  
The greater portion of this force is  
proceeding on its destination towards the  
  
  
  
‘Michigan territory, having succeeded in  
  
relieving an important frontier post, and in  
several incidental operations against hostile  
  
‘tribes of savages, rendered indispensable by  
  
the subserviency into which they had been  
  
‘seduced by ‘the enemy; a seduction the  
‘more cruel,: as ‘it could not fail to impose a  
  
necessity of precautionary severities against  
those who yielded to it. At a recent  
date an attack was made ona post of the  
enemy near Niagara,’ by a detachment of  
the regular and other forces,’ under the  
command of Major-Gen. Van Renssellaer,  
of the Militia of the State of New York.  
The attack, it appears, was ordered in com-  
pliance with the ardour of the troops, who  
  
  
  
“executed it with distinguished gallantry,  
  
and were for a time victorious ; but not re-  
ceiving the expected support, they were  
compelled to yield to reinforcements of  
British regulars and savages. Our loss  
has been considerable, and is deeply to be

who was also Governor of the province;  
and was sustained by veteran troops, from  
inexperienced soldiers, who must daily im-  
prove in the duties of the field. Our  
expectation of gaining the command of the  
Lakes, by the invasion of Canada from De-  
troit, having been disappointed, measures  
were instantly taken to provide on them a  
naval force superior to that of the enemy.  
From the talents and activity of the Officer  
charged with this object, every thing that  
can be done may be expected. Should the  
present season not admit of complete suc-  
cess, the progress made will ensure for the  
next a naval ascendency where it is essen-  
tial, to a permanent peace with, and a con-  
trol over, the Savages.——Among the in-  
cidents to the measures of the war, I am  
constrained to advert to the refusal of the  
Governors of Massachusetts and Connecti-  
cut to furnish the required detachments of  
militia towards the defence of the maritime  
frontier. The refusal was founded on a  
novel and unfortunate exposition of the pro-  
visions of the Constitution relating to the  
militia. The correspondence which will  
be before you, contains the requisite infor-  
mation on the subject. It is obvious, that  
if the authority of the United States to call  
  
  
  
into service and command the militia for  
the public defence can be thus frustrated,  
  
even in a state of declared war, and of  
course under apprehensions of invasion pre-  
ceding war, they are not one nation for the  
purpose most of all requiring it, and that  
the public safety may have no other re-  
source than those large and permanent mi-  
litary establishments which are forbidden  
by the principles of our free government,  
and against the necessity of which the mi-  
litia were meant to be a constitutional bul-  
wark. On the coasts and on the ocean,  
the war has been as successful as circum-  
stances inseparable from its early stages  
could promise. Our public ships and pri-  
vate cruizers, by their activity, and where  
there was occasion, by their intrepidity,  
have made the enemy sensible of the dif-  
ference between a reciprocity’ of captures,  
and the long confinement of them to their  
side. Our trade, with little exception, has  
safely reached our ports, having been‘much  
favoured in‘ it by the course pursued by’a  
squadron of our frigates, under the com-  
mand of Commodore Rodgers :- and in the  
instance in which skill and bravery were  
more particularly tried with those of the  
enemy, the American flag had an auspict-  
ous triumph. The frigate Constitution,

and short engagement, completely disabled  
and captured a British frigate; gaining for  
that officer, and all on board, a praise  
which cannot be too liberally bestowed,—  
not merely for the victory actually achiev-  
ed, but for that prompt and cool exertion  
of commanding talents, which, giving to  
courage its highest character, and to the  
force applied its full effect, proved that  
more could have been done in a contest re-  
quiring more. Anxious to abridge the  
evils from which a state of war cannot be  
exempt, I lost no time after it was declar-  
ed, in conveying to the British Government  
the terms on which its progress might be  
arrested, without waiting the delays of a  
formal and final pacification: and our  
Charge d’Affaires at London was at the  
same time authorized to agree to an armis-  
tice, founded upon them. These terms re-  
quired, that the Orders in Council should  
be repealed, as they affected the United  
  
  
  
States, without a revival of the blockades  
  
violating acknowledged rules; that there  
should be an immediate discharge of Ame-  
rican seamen from British ships, and a  
stop to impressments from American ships,  
with an understanding that an exclusion of  
the seamen of each nation from the ships of  
the other should be stipulated, and that the  
armistice should be improved into a defni-  
tive and comprehensive adjustment of de-  
pending controversies. Although a re-  
peal of the orders susceptible of explana-  
tions meeting the views of this Govern-  
ment, had taken place before this pacific  
advance was communicated to that of Great  
Britain, the advance was declined from an  
avowed eerugmnee ta a suspension of the  
practice of impressment during the armis-  
tice, and without any intimation that the  
arrangement proposed with respect to sea-  
men would be accepted. Whether the  
subsequent communications from this Go-  
_vernment, affording an occasion for recon-  
sidering the subject on the part of Great  
Britain, will be viewed in a more fayour-  
able light, or received in a more accom-  
modating spirit, remains to be knowa. It  
would be unwise to relax our measures, in  
any respect, on a presumption of such a re-  
sult. The documents. from the depart-  
ment of State, which relate to this subject,  
will give a view also of the propositions for  
an. Armistice, which have been received  
here; one of them from the authorities at  
Halifax and in Canada, the other from the  
British Government itself, through Admi-  
ral Warren ; and of the grounds upon which  
neither of them could be accepted. ——-Our  
  
  
  
  
  
affairs with France retain the posture which  
they held at my last communication to  
you. Notwithstanding the authorized  
expectation of an early as well as favour-  
able issue of the discussions on foot, these  
have been procrastinated to the latest date.  
The only intervening occurrence meriting  
attention, is the promulgation of a French  
decree, purporting to be a definitive repeal  
of the Berlin and Milan Decrees. This  
proceeding, although made the ground of  
the repeal of the British Orders in Coun-  
cil, is rendered, by the time and manner  
of it, liable to many objections. The  
final communications from our special Mi-  
nister to Denmark, afford further proofs of  
the good effects of his mission, and of the  
amicable disposition of the Danish Governe  
ment. From Russia we have the satisfac-  
tion to receive assurances of. continued  
friendship, and that it will not be affected  
by the rupture between the United States  
and Great Britain. Sweden also professes  
sentiments favourable to subsisting harmo-  
ny. With the Barbary Powers, except-  
ing that of Algiers, our affairs remain on  
the ordinary footing, The Consul General  
residing with that Regency, has suddenly,  
and without cause, been banished, together  
with all the American citizens found there.  
Whether this was the transitory effect of  
capricious despotism, or the first act of pre-  
determined hostility, is not ascertained.  
Precautions were taken by the Consul on  
the latter supposition.-—The Indian tribes,  
not under foreign instigations, remain at  
peace, and receive the civilizing attentions  
which have proved so beneficial to them.  
With a view to that vigorous prosecu-  
tion of the war to which our national facul-  
ties are adequate, the attention of Congress  
will be particularly drawn to the insuffi-  
/ciency of the existing provisions for filling  
up the military establishment. Such is the  
happy condition of our country, arising  
from the. facility of subsistence, and the  
high wages for every species of occupation,  
that, notwithstanding the augmented in-  
ducements provided at the last Session, a  
partial success only has attended the recruit-  
ing service. The deficiency has been ne-  
cessarily supplied during the campaign by  
other than regular troops, with all the in-  
conveniences and expenses incident to them.  
The remedy lies, in establishing more fa-  
vourably for the private soldier, the pro-  
portion between his recompense and the  
term of his inlistment: and it is a subject  
which cannot too soon or too seriously be  
taken into consideration, The same insuf

ficiency has been&#x27;experienced in the provi-  
sions for volunteers made by an Act of the  
last Session. The recompense for the ser-  
vice&#x27;required in this case, is still less at-  
tractive than in the other: and aithough  
  
triotism alone has sent into the field some  
valuable corps of that description, those  
alone who can afford the sacrifice, can rea-  
sonably be expected to yield to the impulse.  
Jt will merit consideration also, whether,  
as auxiliary to the security of our frontier,  
corps may not be advantageously organized,  
  
with a restriction of their services to parti-  
  
cular districts convenient to them; and  
whether the local or occasional services of  
marines or others in the sea-port towns,  
under a similar organization, would not be  
a proper addition to the means of their de-  
  
-fence. I recommend a provision for an in-  
  
crease of the General Officers of the army,  
the deficiency of which has been illustrated  
by the number and distance of separate  
commands, which the cause of the war,  
and the advantage of the service, have re-  
quired: and I cannot press too strongly on  
the earliest attention of the Legislature, the  
importance of the re-organization of the  
Staff Establishment, with a view to render  
more distinct and definite the relations and  
responsibilities of its several departments :  
that there is room for improvements which  
will materially promote both economy and  
success, in what appertains to the army  
and the war, is equally inculcated by the  
examples of other countries, and by the ex-  
perience of our own. A revision of the  
Militia Laws, for the purpose of rendering  
them more systematic, and better adapting  
them to emergencies of the war, is at this  
time particularly desirable. Of the addi-  
tional ships authorized to be fitted for ser-  
vice, two will be shortly ready to sail; a  
third is under repair, and delay will be  
avoided in the repair of the residue. Of  
the appropriations for the purchase of ma-  
terials for ship-building, the greater part  
has been applied to that object, and the  
purchases will be continued with the ba-  
Jance. The enterprising spirit which. has  
characterized our naval force, and its suc-  
cess both in restraining insults and depre-  
dations on our coasts, and in reprisals on  
the enemy, will not fail to recommend an  
enlargement upon it. There being rea-  
  
  
  
  
  
son to believe, that the Act prohibiting the.  
acceptance of British licenses is not a suffi-  
‘cient guard against the use of them, for  
purposes favourable to the interests and  
views of the enemy; further provisions on  
that subject are highly important. Nor is  
  
  
  
it less so, that penal enactments should be  
provided for cases of corrupt and perfidious  
intercourse with the enemy, not amounting  
to treason, nor yet embraced by any sta-  
tutory provisions. A considerable num-  
ber of American vessels, which in England  
when the revocation of the Orders in Coun-  
cil took place, were laden with British  
manufactures, under an erronéous impres-  
sion that the Non-Importation Act would  
immediately cease to operate, have arrived  
in the United States. It did not appear  
proper to exercise on unforeseen cases of  
such magnitude, the ordinary powers vest-  
ed in the Treasury Department, to mitigate  
forfeitures without previously affording  
Congress an opportunity of making on the  
subject such provisions as they may think  
proper. In their decision, they will,  
doubtless, equally consult what is due. to  
equitable considerations, and to the public  
interest. The receipts into the Treasur  
  
during the year ending on the 30th of Sept.  
last, have exceeded 16 iillions and an half  
of dollars; which have been sufficient to  
defray all the demands on the Treasury to  
that day, including a necessary reimburse-  
ment of near three millions of the princi-  
pal of the public debt. In these receipts  
are included a sum of near 8,850,000: re-  
ceived on account of the loans authorized  
by the Acts of last Session. The whole  
sum actually obtained on loan amounts to  
11 millions of dollars, the residue of  
which being receivable subsequent to the  
30th of September, will, together with the  
current revenue, enable us to defray all the  
expenses of this year. The duties on  
the late unexpected importations of Britiske  
manufactures will render the revenue of the  
ensuing year more productive than could  
have been anticipated. The situation’ of  
our country, fellow citizens, is not without  
its difficulties, though it abounds in ani-  
mating considerations, of which the view  
here presented of our pecuniary resources ig  
an example. With more than one nation  
we have serious and unsettled controversies ;  
and with one powerful in the ‘means and  
habits of war, we are at war. The-spirit  
and strength of this nation are nevertheless  
equal to the support of all its rights,. and  
to carry it through all its trials.. They can  
be met in that confidence. Above all, we  
have the inestimable consolation of know-  
ing, that the war in which we are actually  
engaged, is a war neither of ambition noe  
vain glory; that it is waged, not in viola-  
tion of the rights of others, but in the

** Among the incidents to the measures of  
the war, Lam coustrained to advert to the  
refusal of the governors of Massachusetts and  
Connecticut to furnish the required detach-  
ments of militia towards the defence of the  
maritime frontier. The refusal was founded  
ov a novel and unfortunate exposition of the  
  
provisions of the constitution relating to the |  
  
militia. The correspondence, which will be  
Jaid before you, contains the requisite infor.  
mation on the subject. Ii is obvious, that if  
the authority of the United States to cali into  
service and command the militia for ihe pub-  
  
lic defence can be thus frusirated,-even in a |  
  
state.of declared war, and of course under  
apprehensions of invasion pending war, they  
are not one nation for the purpose most of

may have no other resource than those large  
and permatent military establishments which  
are forbidden by the principles of our free go-

‘« The duties on the late unexpected impor-

“© With @ view to that vigorous prosecution  
of the war, to which our national faculties  
are adequate, the aiention of Congress will  
be particularly drawn to the insuiliciency of  
the existing provisions for filling up the mi-  
litary establishment. Such is the happy con-  
dition of our country, arising from the facility  
of subsistence, ‘and the high wages for every  
species of occupation, that, notwithstanding  
the augmented inducements provided at  
the last Session, a partial success only has  
attended the recruiting service. The defict-  
ency bas been necessarily supplied during the  
campaign by other than regular troops, with  
all the inconveniences and expences inci-  
dent tothem. The remedy lies in éstablishing  
more favourably for the private soldier, the  
proportion between his recompeuse and the  
term of his enlistment: and it is a subject  
which cannot too soon or too seriously be  
taken into consideration. The same insufli-  
| ckency bis been experienced in the provision  
| for volunteers made by an Act of the last  
| Session. ‘The recompense for the service re-  
| quired in this case, is still less-attractive than  
in the other; and although patriotism alone  
has seat into the ficld some valuable corps of  
| that description, those alone who ean afford  
the sacrifice, can reasonably be expected to

the hostile edicts against our commercial  
rights and our maritime independence would  
not be revoke; nay, that they could not  
be ae violating the obliga-  
tions of Gréat Britain to other Powers as  
well as to her own interests. ‘To have  
shrunk under such circumstances, from  
manly resistance, would have been a de-  
gradation blasting our best and proudest  
hopes. It would have struck us from the  
high rank where the virtuous struggles of  
our fathers had placed us, and have betfay-  
ed the magnificent legacy which we hold in  
trust for future generations. It would have  
acknowledged, that on the element which  
forms three-fourths of the globe we inhabit, |  
and where all independent ‘nations have  
equal and common rights, the American  
people were not an independent people,  
but colonists aud vassals. It was at this  
moment, and with such an alternative, that  
war wes chosen. The nation felt the neces-  
sity of it, and called for it. The appeal  
was accordingly made in a just cause, to  
the just and powerful Being who holds in  
his hands the chain of events and the desti-  
ny of nations. It remains only, that faith-  
ful to ourselves, entangled with no con-  
uexions with the views of other Powers,  
und ever ready to accept peace from the  
hand of justice, we prosecute that war  
with united council, and with the ample  
faculties of the nation, until peace be so  
obtained, and as the only means under the  
divine blessing of speedily obtaining it.

Our expectation of&#x27; gaining the com- I  
maud of the Lakes by the&#x27;invasion of I  
Canada from Detroit, having been disap- I  
pointed, measures were instantly taken fo I  
provide «n them a uaval force superior to I  
that ofthe enemy. From the taietifs and I  
activity of the Officer charged with (hisob- I  
ject, every thing that can be done may be I  
expected. Should the present season not I  
aduiit of complete success, the progress I  
made will ensure for the next&#x27; a naval as- I  
cendancy where ii is essential to a perma- I  
neut peace with, and a comroul over, the I  
Savages. H  
Among (he incidents &lt;o the measures of I  
the war, lam constrained to advert to i!le I  
refusal of ihe Governors of Massachusetts I  
and Conuecficur, (o furnish the required I  
detachments of Militia towards the defence I  
ofthe maritime frontier. The refusal was I  
founded ou a novel and unfortunate expo- I  
sition ofthe provisions of fhe Constitution I  
relating to the militia. The correspon- I  
dence which will be laid before you, I  
contains (he requisite information on the I  
subject. ■  
On the coasts and on the ocean, the war!

Our public ships and private cruizers,B

the enemy sensible ofthe difference between

Anxious to abridge the evils from which  
a state of war cannot be exempt, I lost no  
■ time after it was declared, in conveying to  
■ |he British Government the terms on which  
■ its progress might be arrested, without

■ agree to an amisfice, founded upon ,v.  
■ These terms required, that the Ord in

■ &lt;-&#x27;! the United Slates, without a revi i.l of

■ stipulated, and that the armistice should  
■be improved inlo a definitive and compre­

■ tore this pacific advance was .om-B  
■ muiucatedto that of Great Britain, the I  
■ advance was declined from an avowed B  
■ repugnance to a suspension of the practice I  
■of impressment during fhe armistice, and ■  
■ without any intimation (ha( (he arrange- I

■in any respect, on a presumption of ;ch ■

I Our affairs with France retain the posture I  
■ which thc-y held at my last communication I  
Ito you. ■  
I The final communicaiions from our I  
■special Minister to Denmark, afford fur- I  
■(her proofs ofthe good effects ot his I  
■ mission, and of the amicable disposition H  
■ofthe Danish Government. From H &#x27; _,s;a I  
■we have the satisfaction to receive ;&gt; sur- I  
■arices of continued friendship, and that B  
■it will not be affected by the rup ure I  
between the United States ami-Great &#x27;Bii- I  
tain. Sweden also professes^ sentiments I  
favourable to subsisting harmony. ■  
With the Barbary Powers, éxi ■  
that e f Ugieii, our affairs r._..,.,:..  
ordinary footing. The Consui-Géc.Jral I  
residing with that Regency, has sudd nly, ■  
and wiihout cause, been banished, togciher I  
with all the American citizens found I  
there. Whether this was the transitory   
effect of capricious despotism, or (he first ■  
act of predetermined hostility, is not I  
ascertained. Precautions were (aken by I  
(he Consul on the latter supposition. ■  
The Indian tribes, not under foreign I  
instigations, remain at peace, and receive I  
the civilising attentions which have prov- I  
ed so beneficial to them. ■  
The Message concludes with stating that I  
the receipts into the Treasury during the I  
year ending on the 30th of Sep. last^have I  
exceeded 16 millions and a half of dollars; ■  
which have been sufficient to defray all I  
the demands on the Treasury to that duy,&#x27;^B  
including a necessary reimbursement ofß  
near three millions ofthe principal ot the!  
public debt. In these receipts are in-1  
eluded a sum of near 8,830,000 received I  
on account of the loans authorised by the I  
Acts of last Session. The whole sumß  
actually obtained on loan amounts fo ill  
millions of dollars, the residue of wlnch^B  
being receivable subsequent to the oOihß  
of September, will, together with theß  
current revenue, enable us to defray alll  
(he expenses of this year.   
The duties on the late unexpected im-B  
portations of British manufactures wiilfl  
render (he revenue of the ensuing yearß  
more productive than could have been an-B  
ticipated. The situation of our country,  
fellow citizens, is not without its difficul­  
ties, though it abounds in animating consi­  
derations, of which the view here present-  
wot-°U1 l)ecuni;,ly resources is an example.  
With more than one nation we have seri­  
ous and unsettled controversies; and with  
one powerful in the means and habits of  
war, we are at war. The spirit and strength  
oi this nation are nevertheless equal to the  
support of all its rights, and to carry it  
through all its trials. They can be met in  
that confidence. Above all, we have the  
inestimable consolation of knowing, that  
(he war in which we are aclually engaged,  
is a war neither of ambition not vain glory;  
t.iat it is waged, not in violation of the  
rights of others, but in the maintenance of  
our own ; that it was preceded by a patience  
without example, under wrongs accumulat­  
ing without end; and that it was finally  
not declared, until every hope of averting  
it was extinguished by the transfer ofthe  
British Sceptre into new hands, clinging to  
former Councils, and until declarations  
were reiterated in the last hour through the  
British Envoy here, that the hostile&#x27;edicts  
against our commercial rights and our  
maritime independence would not be re­  
voked : nay, that they could not be revok­  
ed, without violating the obligations of  
Great Britain to other. Powers as well as to  
her own interests. To have shrunk under  
such circumstances, from manly resistance,  
would have been a degradation blasting  
our best aud proudest hopes. Jt would  
have si ruck us from the high rank where  
the virtuous struggles of our fathers had  
placed us, aiid have betrayed the magnifi­  
cent legacy which we hold in trust tor fu­  
ture generations. It would haye acknow­  
ledged, (hal on fhe element which forms  
three-fourths of the globe we inhabit and  
where all independent nations have equal  
and common rights, the American people,  
were not an independent people, but co­  
lonists aud vassals.  
it was at (riis moment, and with such  
an alternative, that war was chosen. The  
nation felt the necessity of it, and called  
for it. The appeal was accordingly made  
in a just cause, io the just and powerful  
being who holds in his hands the chain  
of events and the destiny ol nations. It  
remaius only, that faithful to ourselves,­  
entangled with no connections with (he  
views of other Powers, and ever ready  
to accept peace from the hand of justice,  
we prosecute that war with united council,  
and with (he ample faculties of ths nation,  
until peace be so obtained, and as the only  
means under thediviae blessing of speedily  
obtaining it.

&quot;Among the incidents to the meas­  
ures of the war, I am constrained to ad­  
vert to the refusal of the Governors of  
sachusetts and Connecticut to furnish  
the required detachments of militia to­  
ward the defence of the maritime fron­  
tier. The refusal was founded on a  
novel and unfortunate exposition of the  
provisions of the Constitution relating to  
the militia. The correspondences which  
will be laid before you contain the ro­  
quisite information on the subject. I  
is obvious that, if the authority of the  
United States to call into service and  
command the militia for the publicd  
fence can be thus frustrated, even in a  
state of declared war, and, of course un­  
der apprehensions of invasion precedir  
war, they are not one nation for the pu  
pose most of all requiring it, and the  
the public safety may have no other ro  
source than in those large and permanen!  
military establishments which are for  
bidden by the principles of our free Gov  
ernment, and against the necessity of  
which the militia were meant to be a  
constitutional bulwark.&quot;  
In 1814 the committee of the Senata  
called upon the Executive for his view;  
in relation to the matter. Mr. Monroe  
was then Secretary of War. Like a true  
patriot, he had exchanged the Depart­  
ment of State, where the duties were  
comparatively light, to take, under criti­  
cal circumstances, and at the request of  
the President, the Department of War,  
and I have here his reply to the request  
of the committee of the Senate.  
In that report he states the points  
which have been raised. These poin

Struggle for Control of the Lakes. 45  
  
The expectation of getting command of the lakes by the  
invasion of Canada having been disappointed by the surren-  
der of General Hull at Detroit, measures were now taken by  
the United States Government to get control of these inland  
seas by providing upon them a naval force superior to that  
of the enemy.’ There was no doubt about the quantity of  
water being sufficient to float the largest ships. The storm  
waves upon these watery depths might challenge those of  
the great ocean. The difficulty came in getting vessels ready  
to float. It was no easy matter to create a navy upon these  
inland waters. They were inaccessible to vessels from the  
sea, and there were no large shipbuilding plants upon their  
borders as there are now. Settlements were sparse upon the  
south shores of the lakes, and most supplies had to be  
brought from the seaboard at great expense
