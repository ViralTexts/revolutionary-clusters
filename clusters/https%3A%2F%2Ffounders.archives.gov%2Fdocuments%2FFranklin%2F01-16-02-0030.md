ot say much on that Subject till I see Mr. Foxcroft, whom I now expect daily. I am glad Major Small call’d on you. He is a Man I much esteem, as I do his Brother with whom I am intimately acquainted here. My best Respects to him.  
Your Political Disputes I have no Objection to if they are carried on with tolerable Decency, and do not become outrageously abusive. They make People acquainted with their Rights and the Value of them. But your Squabbles about a Bishop I wish to see speedily ended. They seem to be unnecessary at present, as the Design of sending one is dropt; and if it were not dropt, I cannot think it a matter of such Moment as to be a sufficient Reason for Division among you, when there never was more need of your being united. I do not conceive that “Bishops residing” in America, would either be of such Advantage to Episcopalians, or such Disadvantage to Anti-episcopalians as either seems to imagine. Each Party abuses the other, the Profane and the Infidel believe both sides, and enjoy the Fray; the Reputation of Religion in general suffers, and its Enemies are ready to say, not what was said in the primitive Times, Behold how these Christians love one another, but, Mark how these Christians HATE one another! Indeed when religious People quarrel about Religion, or hungry People about their Victuals, it looks as if they had not much of either among them.
