I lay before Congress copies of a Proclamation of the British Lieutenant Governor of the Island of Bermuda, which has appeared under circumstances leaving no doubt of its authenticity. It recites a British order in Council of the 26 of October last, providing for the supply of the British West Indies and other Colonial possessions, by a trade under special licences; and is accompanied by a circular instruction to the Colonial Governors, which confines licenced importations from ports of the United States, to the ports of the Eastern States exclusively.  
The Government of Great Britain had already introduced into her commerce during war, a system, which at once violating the rights of other nations, and resting on a mass of forgery and perjury unknown to other times, was making an unfortunate progress in undermining those principles of morality and religion, which are the best foundation of national happiness.  
The policy now proclaimed to the world, introduces into her modes of warfare, a system equally distinguished by the deformity of its features, and the depravity of its character; having for its object to dissolve the ties of allegiance and the sentiments of loyalty in the adversary nation, and to seduce and seperate its componant parts, the one from the other.  
The general tendency of these demoralizing and disorganizing contrivances, will be reprobated by the civilized and christian world; and the insulting attempt on the virtue, the honor, the patriotism, and the fidelity of our brethren of the Eastern States, will not fail to call forth all their indignation and resentment; and to attach more and more all the States, to that happy union and constitution, against which such insidious and malignant artifices are directed.  
The better to guard, nevertheless, against the effect of individual cupidity and treachery, and to turn the corrupt projects of the Enemy against himself, I recommend to the consideration of Congress, the expediency of an effectual prohibition of any trade whatever, by Citizens or inhabitants of the United States, under special licences, whether relating to persons or ports; and in aid thereof a prohibition of all exportations from the United States in foreign bottoms; few of which are actually employed; whilst multiplying counterfeits of their flags and papers are covering and encouraging the navigation of the Enemy.

I lay before Congress copies of a pro.  
  
of the Island of Bermuda, which has  
appeared ander circumstances leaving  
no doubt of its auihenticity. It recites  
a British order in Council, of the 26th  
October last, providing for the supply of  
the British W. Indies and other coloni-  
al possessions, by a trade under special  
licences ; and is accompanied by a cir-  
calar instruction to the colonial gover-  
nors, which confines licensed importa-  
tions from ports ofthe U. 8. to the ports  
ofthe eastern states exclusively.  
  
The government of Great Britain has  
  
already introduced into her commerce,  
  
daring war, a system which, at once  
violating the rights of other nations, and  
resting on a mass of forgéry and perjury,  
unknown to other times, was making an  
unfortunate progress in undermining  
those principles of morality and religion,  
which are the best foundation of na-  
tional happiness. ‘The policy, now pro-  
claimed to the world, introduces into  
her modes of warfare a system equally  
distinguished by the deformity of its  
features and the depravity of its charac  
ter; having for its object to dissolve the  
ties of allegiance, and the sentiments of  
loyalty in the adversary nation, and to  
seduce and separate its component parts  
the one from the other. ‘The general  
tendency of these demoralizing contri-  
vances will be reprobated by the civili  
zed and christian world, and the insul-  
ting attempt on the virtue, the honor, the  
patriotism, and the fidelity of our breth-  
ren of the eastern states, will not fail to  
call forth their indignation and resent-  
ment; and toattach more and more all  
the states to the happy union and con  
stitution against which such insidious  
and malignant artifices are directed.  
  
The better to guard, nevertheless, a-  
  
jgainst the effect of individual cupidity  
  
and treachery, and turn the este es  
jects of the eriemy against himself, I re-  
commend to the consideration of Con.  
gress the expediency of an effectual pro-  
hibition of any trade whatever by citi-  
zens or inhabitants ofthe U. 8. under  
special licences, whether relating to per-  
sons or ports; and, in aid thereof, a  
rohibition of ali exportations from the  
Tnited States in foreign bottoms ; few  
of which are actually employed, whilst  
multiplying counterfeits ef their flags  
and papers are covering and encoura.
