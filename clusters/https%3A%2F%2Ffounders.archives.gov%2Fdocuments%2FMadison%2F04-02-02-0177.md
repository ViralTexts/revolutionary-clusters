r attention is respectfully requested to an association of Scholars for the purpose of improving American literature. This association, though yet at its commencement and unknown to the public, has been the subject of an interesting correspondence for some months past; and it is believed will not be deemed unimportant as connected with the best interests of our country.  
To settle at once a point on which some difference might exist, it is not designed, independent of England, to form an American language, farther than as it relates to the numerous and increasing names and terms peculiarly American; but to cultivate a friendly correspondence with any similar association or distinguished individuals in Great Britain, who may be disposed to join us in an exertion to improve our common language.  
The objects of such an institution which directly present themselves, are, to collect and interchange literary intelligence; to guard against local or foreign corruptions, or to correct such as already exist; to settle varying orthography; determine the use of doubtful words and phrases; and, generally, to form and maintain, as far as practicable, an English standard of writing and pronunciation, correct, fixed, and uniform, throughout our extensive territory. Connected with this, and according to future ability, may be such rewards for meritorious productions, and such incentives to improvement, in the language and literature of our country, and in the general system of instruction, as from existing circumstances may become proper.  
  
These objects will not be thought trifling, by those who have spent much time in the cultivation of literature, or attended to its influence on society. Such persons need not be told how directly they are connected with our progress in general knowledge, or our public reputation; or that their influence may extend from social to national intercourse, and to our commercial prosperity. Perspicuity in language is the basis of all science. The philosophy that professes to teach the knowledge of things, independent of words, needs only to be mentioned among enlightened men to be rejected.  
Most of the European nations have considered the improvement of language as an important national object, and have established academies, with extensive funds and privileges, for that purpose. An interference of the government has, perhaps, been omitted in England, from a singular and rather accidental reliance on the acknowledged superiority of a few leading individuals; and so long as all the literature in the English language had its origin and center in London, there was less danger in thus leaving it to the guidance of chance. Science may be comparatively recluse; but literature is social; and American scholars, spread over 2,000,000 square miles, are not to be drawn to a virtual and national association, without the form.  
It is very properly said of France that its literature has frequently saved the country when its arms have failed. The advantages resulting to that nation, from the exertions of a few academicians, have been incalculable, and may serve to show, in some degree, what such a confederacy of scholars is capable of performing. The effect of their influence was not barely to elevate France in the literary world, and to improve its learning within itself; but to extend their language throughout Europe; to introduce, at the expense of other nations, their books, their opinions, and, in aid of other causes, their political preponderance. The Philological Academies of Italy and Spain, though unaided by the same powerful co-operation, have effected very great improvements in the language and literature of their respective countries. The great work now performing by the German scholars, in addition to what they have before done, is a noble example to other nations, and calculated to elevate the condition of our nature. With how much greater force does every consideration connected with this subject, apply, in a free community, where all depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the great body of the people.  
Without dwelling a moment on invidious comparisons between England and the United States, the time appears to have arrived, in reference to ourselves, when, having acquired a high standing among nations, having succeeded in a fair trial of the practicability and excellence of our civil institutions, our scholars are invited to call their convention and to form the constitution of national literature.  
  
We have some peculiar advantages in an attempt to establish national uniformity in language. Happily for us, our forefathers came chiefly from that part of England where their language was most correctly spoken, and were possessed of a good degree of intelligence, according to the learning of that time. Though in a country as diversified as ours, there are, from various causes, many particular corruptions, we hardly find any thing that can properly be called a provincial dialect. We have at present no very inveterate habits to correct, where gross barbarisms, through large districts, are to be encountered. The attempt therefore, seasonably and judiciously made, presents a prospect not only of success, but of comparative facility. Our scattered population seem only to want from a competent tribunal, a declaration of what is proper, to guide them in their practice. The present appearances are more favorable than the most sanguine among the projectors of the plan dared to predict. There is the best reason to expect the general concurrence of our distinguished literary men in favor of a measure which promises so many advantages, so nationally important in its principles and effects, and to which so little can be objected. It is deemed unnecessary at present to dwell minutely on the details of the plan, which probably will not be difficult to settle, if the leading principles are generally approved. It is equally useless to enter upon a train of arguments to prove the advantages of such an association under the present circumstances of our country. The commanding influence of literature upon national wealth and power, as well as morals, character, and happiness, especially in free communities, will not be doubted by those whose minds have been most directed to this interesting branch of civil policy. Perhaps there never has been, and never may be, a nation more open to the influence of moral causes, than the American Republic at the present time. In every country truly free, public opinion is in effect the governing law; and public opinion, and all the complicated interests of society, greatly depend on the state of national literature. That independence which is our boast must consist in the proper independence of the mind. Without contemning the experience of past ages, we ought not too slavishly to follow the path of others. It is enough to respect the Europeans as honorable competitors, without regarding them as absolute masters. American ambition should aspire to noble objects, if we mean to rise to excellence: for, besides that the imitator is almost necessarily inferior to his model, the old world can furnish no model suited to the circumstances and character of our country. We are a world by ourselves. Our privileges, resources, and prospects, are of the highest order. Happily exempt from hereditary despotism or bigoted hierarchies, from jealous and powerful bordering nations; the professed advocates of rational freedom, the world may justly claim from us an example worthy of such a situation and such a cause. Our numbers and wealth are greater than those of England were, when the last of her splendid  
  
colleges was erected; we may have the learning of Europeans in common stock, with an exemption from their burdens, and the highest eminence which others have attained, ought to be the American starting point in the career of national greatness.  
And is there any thing impossible, or even particularly difficult, in reducing these ideas to practice? Without expecting to render human nature perfect, or to fix an unalterable standard for living language and literature, may there not be some regulation which will place the decisions of the wise in preference to the blunders of the ignorant? When can a more favorable time be expected, to correct the irregularities yearly multiplying upon us, and becoming more and more embodied with the literature of our country? Why should chance be expected to accomplish, what, from its nature, can result only from well-regulated system? It would indeed be imprudent to attempt too much. Sound discretion will point out a middle course between a wild spirit of innovation and a tame acquiescence in obvious error. Language is too important an instrument in human affairs to have its improvement regarded as useless or trifling. Of all the objects of national identity, affection, and pride, national literature is the most laudable, the most operative, and the most enduring. It is to the scholars of antiquity we owe all we know of their statesmen and heroes, and even their distinctive national existence. In the long train of ages their tables of brass have mouldered away, and their high-wrought columns crumbled to dust. Cities have sunk, and their last vestige been lost. The unconscious Turk half-tills the soil manured with decayed sculpture: but the monuments of genius and learning, more durable than marble and brass, remain the subject of undecreasing admiration and delight. The fame to which great minds aspire, is, to soar above the local contentions of the day, and live to after ages in the esteem of their fellow men. The thought of this animates the patriot’s hope and nerves his arm, in danger, toil, and want. Shall it not be the ambition of Americans to proclaim the honor of their benefactors, and transmit the glory of their country to the latest age of the world? We are not here to awe the ignorant by the splendor of royal trappings, but to command the respect of the wise and good by moral greatness. These objects are neither above the capacity, nor beneath the attention, of our countrymen. They are interwoven with our individual happiness, our national character, and our highest interests. When we survey this vast assemblage of States, independent, yet united; competitors in useful improvement, yet members of one great body; the world has never prepared such a theatre for the exhibition of mental and moral excellence: and if the men of all ages, whom we most delight to honor, have made it their chief glory to advance the literature of their respective countries, shall it be degradingly supposed, that, in this favored land, either talents or zeal will be wanting in such a cause? If it is said, that Americans have not paid that  
  
attention to education which the subject demanded; it is true; and neither justice nor sound policy requires us to disguise the fact: but has any fatality ordained that the people most interested in diffusing the light of instruction, must be degraded in the republic of letters? Much irritation has been produced by the observations of foreign writers upon the learning and intellect of our countrymen. We ought not to waste time in idle complaint on this subject. Is there not in America enough of genius, of scholarship, and of patriotic spirit, if properly organized and conducted, to raise our literary character above the influence of any combination abroad? Shall our numberless blessings remain an unprized possession? Will foreign pens maintain and elevate American character? Is it not time to make a national stand in the moral world, as the expositors of our own principles, the vindicators of our institutions, and, under a Beneficent Providence, the arbiters of the destiny of unborn millions? Even if, contrary to all human expectation, such an association should fail in its objects, would it not justly be said, ‘magnis tamen excidit ausis’?  
It is not intended to bring the society before the public by a premature and unnecessary parade, but to make it known chiefly by its practical good.  
The following is a general outline of the institution alluded to, subject of course to such variations as may be thought to increase the prospect of its utility.  
  
  
To be called “The American Academy of Language and Belles Lettres.”  
Its prime object is to harmonize and determine the English language; but it will also, according to its discretion and means, embrace every branch of useful and elegant literature, and especially whatever relates to our own country.  
To be located in the city of New-York, where accommodations will be furnished free from expense.  
To commence with fifty members; maximum number, one hundred and twenty. More than that would lessen the credit of membership, and diminish rather than increase its authority.  
Members to be divided into three classes. Resident, who reside in or near New-York; Corresponding, those whose distance prevents their regular attendance; and honorary, those at home or abroad, whom the body may think proper expressly to admit as such: but, perhaps, it will be thought best to make very few honorary members in the United States. The only reason for making a difference between resident and corresponding members, is to give to the latter all practicable privileges and facilities in communicating their opinions, propositions and votes in writing, as a compensation  
  
for the difficulties of personal attendance. In questions requiring a ballot, the written opinions and wishes of distant members are taken as votes on all points to which they directly relate. As most of the questions likely to arise will relate to written language, and as few of them will require haste in the decision, there will be a particular fitness in arriving at a general result through the means of the various opinions in writing.  
It will be a standing request, though not absolutely required, that each member shall, within one year after his admission, deliver personally, or by writing, a discourse upon some subject relating to language or general literature, or to the situation and interests of the United States.  
The Society, when organized, will send a respectful communication to such literary gentlemen in the British dominions as may be thought proper, explaining to them the design of the establishment, and inviting their cooperation. Public policy, as well as general convenience will point out to them the importance of improving our language, facilitating its acquisition to foreigners as well as native citizens, and preserving its uniformity throughout the extensive regions where it now does, or hereafter may prevail.  
The Modus Operandi should be the result of the joint wisdom of the body, when formed; but almost every disputed point in language, and in ours they are very numerous, may be made a case, subjected to rule as far as possible, and brought to a decision, endeavoring to have this decision concurrent between the British and ourselves.  
But besides the acknowledged corruptions which prevail in the language of this country, our peculiar institutions and circumstances; our discoveries and improvements, have given rise to a large class of new words, Americanisms, if the critics please; necessary to express new things. To adopt and regulate these is not to alter the English language; but only to supply its deficiencies. This is particularly a work of our own. It is also important that attention should be paid to the numerous names of places, French, Spanish and Aboriginal, which are daily becoming incorporated with our literature, and concerning which so much diversity at present exists.  
The unprofitable disputes among teachers and the authors of elementary books, who are often very unskilful advocates of their opposing systems, and whose arguments tend only to increase a difference which ought not to exist, would be in a great degree obviated. The professors of Rhetoric and Logick, in our best universities, should at least agree in spelling the names of the important sciences they teach. Our numerous youth would then be left free to pursue the straight course to the knowledge of a language which might be, not only strong and copious, but, to a far greater extent, regular and fixed. In addition to other advantages, there cannot be a rational doubt that such an institution may have a beneficial influence in exciting emulation  
  
and national concert, in our literature in general, and that many might be drawn to this interesting subject, who are now less profitably and less honorably employed in other pursuits.  
The object here contemplated is certainly of sufficient national importance to merit an adequate fund from the public. Should this fail, it would be improper to lay a burdensome expense on the members. Expenditures to any considerable amount are not considered indispensably necessary; for though individuals may not be able to accomplish all that may be desired, much may be done at a moderate actual expense. Twenty-five dollars at the admission of a member, and two dollars a year afterwards, though trifling to some, is considered enough to impose by any imperative rule.  
The only objections which have been made to the proposed plan, are on the ground of its practicability. The difficulties alleged are, the superiority of the British in literature; the contempt with which they will look on our institutions and offers of correspondence; the prejudices of our own people in their favor, and the consequent necessity of waiting for them to lead the way. These difficulties, if correct to the extent that some of our citizens seem inclined to admit, show at least the necessity of trying to produce a favorable change. If in literature and science we are greatly inferior to any other people, it is not because we are deficient in natural, political, or moral advantages, or have not as strong reasons as any nation ever had to encourage letters; but because we have hitherto neglected any general or systematic means for their advancement. The arguments are fallacious which attempt to find in the circumstances or dispositions of our people any disqualification for the highest mental attainments. American genius and enterprise properly directed, may as well be displayed in the highest walks of literature and science as in any thing else. One difficulty is our scholars, as such, have very little intercourse, and have too long been strangers to each other. Homo solus imbecilis.  
Concert will excite a generous emulation. This, upon the plan proposed, will operate upon a vast and highly reputable field; it will be identified with the national character and the dearest interests of a great and rising people, and cannot fail to produce excellence and command patronage and respect. The bare circumstance of exciting attention to the subject is an important point gained. ‘Aude et faciat.’ A colonial servility in literature is as unworthy of our country as political dependence. The necessary limits of this letter forbid a course of reasoning upon the subject: it may be thought proper to give a fuller exposition in a pamphlet form. The general principles explained above are deemed sufficient as the basis of preparatory arrangement.  
Among the respectable persons consulted respecting the proposed institution, the sentiment, as far as ascertained, is very general and zealous in its favor. It is designed to carry it into effect with as little delay as sound  
  
discretion, in refererence to character and advantageous arrangements for a favorable commencement will admit.  
The constitution formed for the Society is purposely a very short one, intended chiefly as the basis for a commencement. A body of scholars, associated for the laudable object of promoting the literature of their country, many of them very familiar with public proceedings, will need fewer legal rules than a bank or a state. Whatever may be the deficiencies of this constitution, experience will be more competent to supply them than any wisdom of anticipation.  
From the peculiar circumstances of our country, the institution will have no guide in any thing which has gone before; but liberal criticism will make some allowance for the difficulties necessarily attendant on first attempts. The same regular progress will not be expected in an untrodden field as on a well travelled road; but in pursuing a noble object with good intention, there is the consolation that those best qualified to judge are least inclined to condemn. If our beginning is a small one, so was that of the Royal Society of London; and we can have no reason to dread more obloquy from the illiberal, than they received.  
Very generous subscriptions, by a number of gentlemen who are not expected to be members, are volunteered, pro patria, and there is an encouraging prospect for funds. If among the variety of character in our country, there is a portion too ignorant, or too grovelling, to depart from their own narrow views of immediate gain, it is hoped that, among ten millions of people, there are enough possessed of talent to estimate, and spirit to maintain, an institution whose aim is to promote the best interests and lasting honor of the United States. In such a cause it is deemed unnecessary for the institution to solicit pecuniary aid, farther than by a fair exposition of its principles and objects. The subscriptions are to be a free-will offering upon the altar of our country: yet it will be no less creditable to the society, than just in itself, to hold in grateful remembrance and transmit to future generations, the names of those generous citizens who, by their donations, become at once, the patrons of learning and the vindicators of the American name. It may be one of the good effects of this society to bring patriotic g

the most operative, and the most enduring. It is to the scholars  
of antiquity we owe all we know of their statesmen and heroes, and  
even their distinctive nationai existence. In the long train of ages  
their tables of brass have mouldered away, and their high-w roucht  
columns crumbled to dust. Cities have’ sunk, and their last ves-  
tige been lost. The unconscious Turk half-tills the soil manured  
with decayed sculpture : but the monuments of genius and learning,  
more durable than warble and brass, remain the subject of undecreas-  
ing admiration and delight. ‘The fame to which great minds aspire,  
is, to soar above the local contentions of the day, and live to after  
ages in the esteem of their fellow men. ‘The thought of this ani-  
mates the patriot’s hope and nerves his arm, in danger, toil, and  
want. Shall it not be the ambition of Americans to proclaim the  
honour of their benefactors, and transmit the glory of their coun-  
try to the latest age of the world ? We are not here to awe the ig-  
norant by the splendour of royal trappings, but to command the  
respect of the wise and good by moral greatness. These objects  
are neither above the capacity, nor beneath the attention, of our  
countrymen. ‘l&#x27;hey are interwoven with our individual happiness,  
our national character, and our highest interests. When we sur-  
vey this vast assemblage of States, independent, yet united ; com-  
petitors in useful improvement, yet members of one great body ;  
the world has never prepared such a theatre for the exhibition of  
mental and moral excellence : and if the men of all ages, whom  
we most delight to honour, have made it their chief glory to ad-  
vance the literature of their respective countries, shal] it be de-  
gradingly supposed, that, in this favoured land, either talents or  
zeal will be wanting in such a cause’ If it is said, that Americans

us to disguise the fact: but has any fatality ordained that the peo-  
  
le most interested in diffusing the light of instruction, must be de-  
  
raded in the republic of letters ? Much irritation has been produ-  
ced by the observations of foreign writers upon the learning and  
intellect of our countrymen. We ought not to waste time in idle  
complaint on this subject. Is not there in America enough of  
genius, of scholarship, and of patriotic spirit, if properly organized  
and conducted, to raise our literary character above the influence  
of any combination abroad ? Shall our numberless blessings re-  
main an unprized possession ? Will] foreign pens maintain and ele-  
vate American character ? Is it not time to make a national stand  
in the moral world, as the expositors of our own principles, the  
vindicators of our institutions, and, under a beneficent Provi-  
dence, the arbiters of the destiny of unborn millions? Even if, con-  
trary to all human expectation, such an association should fail in  
its objects, would it not justly be said, ‘ magnis tamen excidit

It is not intended to bring the society before the public by a  
premature and unnecessary parade, but to make it known chiefly  
by its practical good.  
  
“The following i is a general outline of the institution alluded to,  
subject of course to such variations as may be thought to increase  
the prospect of its utility.  
  
“To be called ‘THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF LAN-

“To be located in the city of New-York, where accommoda-  
tions will be furnished free from expense.  
  
To commence with fifty members; maximum number, one  
hundred and twenty. More than that would lessen the credit of  
membership, and diminish rather than increase its authority.  
  
‘ Members to be divided into three clases. Resident, who reside  
in or near New-York ; Corresponding, those whose distance pre-  
vents their regular attendance ; ; and Honorary, those at home or  
abroad, whom the body may think proper expressly to admit as  
such : but, perhaps, it will be thought best to make very tew hono-  
rary members in the United States. The only reason for making  
a difference between resident and corresponding members, is to  
give to the latter all practicable privileges and facilities in commu-  
nicating their opinions, propositions and votes in writing, asa  
compensation for the difficulties of personal attendance. Tn ques-

tions requiring 2 ballot, the written opinions and wishes of distant  
members are taken as votes on all points to which they directly re-  
late. As most of the questions likely to arise will relate to written  
language, and as few of them will require haste in the decision,  
there will be a particular fitness in arriving at a general result  
through the means of the various opinions in writing.  
  
“Jt will be a standing request, though not absolutely required,  
that each member shall, within one year after his admission, deliver  
personally, or by writing, a discourse upon some subject relating  
to language or general literature, or to the situation and interests of  
the United States.  
  
“The Society, when organized, will send a respectful communi-  
cation to such literary gentlemen in the British dominions as may  
be thought proper, explaining to them the design of the establish-  
ment, and inviting their co-operation. Public policy, as well as  
general convenience will point out to them the importance of im-  
proving our language, facilitating its acquisition to foreigners as  
wellas native citizens, and preserving its uniformity throughout the  
extensive regions where it now does, or hereafter may previ ail.  
  
“The Modus Operandi should be the result of the joint wisdom  
of the body, when tormed ; but almost every disputed point in lan-  
guage, and in ours they are very numerous, may be made a Case,  
subjected to rule as far as possible, and brought to a decision, en-  
deavouring to have this decision concurrent between the British  
and ourselves.  
  
‘But besides the acknowledged corruptions which prevail in  
the language of this country, our peculiar institutions and circum-  
stances; our discoveries and improvements, have given rise to a  
large class of new words—.dmericanisms, if the critics please—ne-  
cessary to express new things. ‘To adopt and regulate these is not  
to alter the English language; but only to supply its deficiencies.  
This is particularly a work of our own. It is also important that  
attention should be paid to the numerous names of places, French,  
Spanish and Aboriginal, which are daily becoming incorporated  
with our literature, and concerning which so much diy ersity at pre-  
sent exists.  
  
‘The unprofitable disputes among teachers and the authors of  
  
elementary books, who are often very unskilful advocates of their  
opposing systems, and whose arguments tend only to increase a  
difference which ought not to exist, would be in a great degree ob-  
viated. The Professors of Ruxroaic and Loaicxk, in our best  
universities, should at least agree in spelling the names of the im-  
portant sciences they teach. Our numerous youth would then be  
left free to pursue the straight course to the knowledge of a lan-  
guage which might be, not only strong and copious, but, to a far  
greater extent, regular and fixed. In addition to other advantages,

there cannot be a rational doubt that such an institution may have  
a beneficial influence in exciting emulation and national concert,  
in our literature in general, and that many might be drawn to this  
interesting subject, who are now less profitably “and less honourably  
employed in other pursuits.  
  
“The object here contemplated is certainly of sufficient national  
importance to merit an adequate fund from the public. Should  
this fail, it would be improper to lay a burdensome expense on the  
  
members. Expenditures to any considerable amount are not con-  
sidered indispensably necessary ; for though individuals may not  
be able to accomplish all that may be desired, much may be done  
at a moderate actual expense. ‘I&#x27;wenty-five dollars at the ad.nis-  
sion of a member, and two dollars a year afterwards, though tri-  
fling to some, is considered enough to impose by any imperative  
rule.  
  
“The only objections which have been made to the proposed  
plan, are on the ground of its practicability. ‘The difficulties al-  
leged are, the superiority of the British in literature ; the contempt  
with which they will look on our institutions and oflers of corres-  
pondence ; the prejudices of our own people in their favour, and  
the consequent necessity of waiting for them to lead the way. These  
difficulties, if correct to the extent that some of our citizens seem  
inclined to admit, show at least the necessity of rryING to produce  
a favourable change. If in literature and science we are greatly  
inferior to any other people, it is not because we are deficient i in na-  
tural, political, or moral advantages, or have not as strong reasons  
as any nation ever had to encourage letters ; but because we have  
hitherto neglected any general or syste: natic means for their ad-  
vancement. ‘The arguments are fallacious which attempt to find  
in the circumstances or dispositions of our people any disqualifica-  
tion for the highest mental attainments. American genius and en-  
terprise properly directed, may as well be displayed in the highest  
walks of literature and science as in any thing else. One difticul-  
ty is, our scholars, as such, have very little intercourse, and have  
too long been strangers to each other. Homo solus imbecilis.  
Concert will excite a generous emulation. This, upon the =  
proposed, will operate upon a vast and highly reputable field ;  
will be identified with the national character and the dearest soe  
rests of a great and rising people, and cannot fail to produce ex-  
cellence and command patronage and respect. The bare circum-  
stance of exciting attention to the subject is an important point  
gained. ‘ Aude et faciat.’ A colonial servility in literature is as  
unworthy of our country as political dependence. The necessary  
limits of this letter forbid a course of reasoning upon the subject :  
it may be thought proper to give a fuller exposition in a pamphlet

AMERICAN ACADEMY OF LANGUAGE  
AND BELLES LETTRES.  
  
In one of our early numbers,  
we extracted from another paper,  
a brief statement of the objects  
  
and probable advantages of this  
  
institution. We have long owed  
  
it to the politeness of the Corres-  
ponding Secretary, who furnished  
us with several documents rela-  
tive to the Academy, to take fur-  
ther notice of its organization,  
and the general scope of its plan.  
The Academy is established in  
New York, where accommoda-  
tions are furnished free of ex-  
pense. Its prime object is to har-  
monize and determine the English  
language ; but it will also, accord-  
ing to its discretion and means,  
embrace every branch of useful  
and elegant literature, and espe-  
cially whatever relates to our own  
country. The maximum number  
of members is 120; to be divid-  
ed into three classes; Resident,  
those who reside in New York and  
its vicinity; Corresponding, an

uals in  
Great Britain, who may be disposed to  
join us in an exertion to improve our  
common language.  
  
“The objects of such an institution  
which directly present themselves, are,  
to collect and interchange literary intel-  
ligence ; to guard against local or fo-  
reign corruptions, or to correct such as  
already exist; to settle varying ortho-  
graphy ; determine the use of doubtful  
words and phrases; and, generally, to  
form and maintain, as far as practicable,  
an English standard of writing and pro-  
nunciation, correct, fixed, and uniform,  
throughout our extensive territory.—  
Connected with this, and according to  
future ability, may be such rewards for  
meritorious productions, and such incen-  
tives to improvement, in the language  
and literature of our country, and in the  
general system of instruction, as from  
existing circumstances may become pro-  
er.”  
  
“ Most of the European nations have  
considered the improvement of language  
as an important national object, and  
have established academies, with exten-  
sive funds and privileges, for that pur-  
pose. An interference of the govern-  
ment has, perhaps, been omitted in En-  
gland, from a singular, and rather acci-  
dental reliance on a few leading indivi-  
duals ; and so long as all the literature  
in the English language had its origin  
and centre in London, there was less  
danger in thus leaving it to the guidance  
of chance. Our scholars are not drawn  
to a virtual and national association,  
without the form. ;  
  
“Itis very properly said of France,  
that its literature has very frequently  
saved the country when its arms have  
failed. The advantages a to that  
nation, from the exertions of a few aca-  
demicians, have been incalculable, and  
may serve to show, in some degree,  
what such a confederacy of scholars is  
capable of performing. The effect of  
their influence was not barely to elevate  
France in the literary world, and to im-  
prove its learting within itself; but to  
extend their language throughout Eu-  
rope ; to introduce, at the expense of  
other nations, their books, their opin-  
ions, and, in aid of other causes, their  
political preponderance. With how  
much greater force does every consider-  
ation connected with this subject, apply  
in a free country, where all depends  
upon the virtue and intelligence of the  
great body of the people? f  
  
“ Without dwelling a moment on in-  
vidious comparisons between England  
and the United States, the time appears  
to have arrived, in reference to our-  
selves, when, having acquired a high  
standing among nations, having succeed-  
ed in a fair trial of the icability and  
excellence of our civil institutions, our  
scholars are invited to call their conven-  
tion and-to form the constitution of na-  
  
onal literature.”  
  
  
  
A few days ago, a large quantity of A-  
  
“ Language %s too important an instri-  
ment in human affairs to have its im-  
provement regarded as useless or tri-  
fling. Of all the objects of national  
identity, affection, and pride, national li-  
terature is the most laudable, the most  
operative, and the most enduring. It is  
to the scholars of antiquity we owe all  
we know of their statesmen and heroes,  
and even their distinctive national exis-  
tence. In the long train of ages, their  
statues and tables of brass have moul-  
dered away, and their high wrought co-  
lumns crumbled to dust. Their monu-  
ments of genius and learning, more du-  
rable than marble and brass, remain the  
subject of undecreasing admiration and  
delight. Shall it not be the ambition of  
Americans to proclaim the honour of  
our patriots, and transmit the glory of  
our country to the latest age of the  
world? We are not heré to awe the ig-  
norant by the splendour of royal trap-  
pings, but to command the respect of  
the wise and good by moral greatness,  
These objects are neither above the ca-  
pacity, nor beneath the attention of our  
countrymen. They are interwoven with  
our individual happiness, our national  
| character, and our highest interests.—  
  
Some irritation has been produced by  
the observations of foreign travellers  
upon the talents and learning of our  
countrymen. We ought not to waste  
time in idle complaint on this subject.  
Is there not in America enough of geni-  
us, of scholarship, and of patriotic spirit,  
| if properly organized and conducted, to  
  
raise our literary character above the in-  
| fluence of any individual abroad? Even  
| if contrary to all human expectation,  
  
such an association should fail in its ob-  
jects, would it not justly be said, ‘ mag-  
nis tamen excidit ausis?’  
  
  
  
It is unnecessary to add any  
comment on the importance of  
the objects which are contemplat
