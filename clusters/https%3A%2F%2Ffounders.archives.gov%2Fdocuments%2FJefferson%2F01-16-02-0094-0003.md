Gentlemen  
  
The testimony of esteem with which you are pleased to honour my return to my native county fills me with gratitude and pleasure. While it shews that my absence has not lost me your friendly recollection, it holds out the comfortable hope that when the hour of retirement shall come, I shall again find myself amidst those with whom I have long lived, with whom I wish to live, and whose affection is the source of my purest happiness. Their favor was the door thro’ which I was ushered on the stage of public life; and  while I have been led on thro’ it’s varying scenes, I could not be unmindful of those who assigned me my first part.  
My feeble and obscure exertions in their service, and in the holy cause of freedom, have had no other merit than that they were my best. We have all the same. We have been fellow-labourers and fellow-sufferers, and heaven has rewarded us with a happy issue from our struggles. It rests now with ourselves alone to enjoy in peace and concord the blessings of self-government, so long denied to mankind: to shew by example the sufficiency of human reason for the care of human affairs and that the will of the majority, the Natural law of every society, is the only sure guardian of the rights of man. Perhaps even this may sometimes err. But it’s errors are honest, solitary and short-lived.—Let us then, my dear friends, for ever bow down to the general reason of the society. We are safe with that, even in it’s deviations, for it soon returns again to the right way. These are lessons we have learnt together. We have prospered in their practice, and the liberality with which you are pleased to approve my attachment to the general rights of mankind assures me we are still together in these it’s kindred sentiments.  
Wherever I may be stationed, by the will of my country, it will be my delight to see, in the general tide of happiness, that yours too flows on in just place and measure. That it may flow thro’ all times, gathering strength as it goes, and spreading the happy influence of reason and liberty over the face of the earth, is my fervent prayer to heaven.  
Feb. 12. 1790.

To which he made the following reply.  
  
Gentlemen,  
T&#x27;HE testimony of esteem with which you are  
to honor my return to my native county,  
fills me with gratitude and pleasure. While it  
that my absence has not loft me your friendly  
recolle&lt;flion, it holds out tlie comfortable hope  
that when the hour of retirement shall come, 1  
(hall again find myfelf amidlt those with whom I  
have long lived, with whom I wi/li to live, and  
whose aftetftion is the fonrce of my present hap­  
piness.--Their favour was the door through which  
I was ufliered on the stage of public life ; and  
while 1 have been led on through its varying  
scenes, I could not be unmindful of those who as­  
signed me my firft part.  
My feeble and obfeure exertions in their service,  
and in the holycaufe of freedom, have had 110 o­  
tlier merit than that they weremybeft. We have  
all the fame. We have been fellow labourers,  
and felJow-fuffcrers ; and Heaven has rewarded  
  
395  
  
us with a happy ifluefrom our druggies. It rests  
now with ourselves alone to enjoy in peace and  
concord the bleflings of felf-govcrnment, so long  
denied to mankind ; to fliew bv example the fuf­  
ficiency of human reason for the care of human  
affairs; and that the will of the majoriry, the na­  
tural law of every fociery, is the only sure guar­  
dian of the rights of man. Perhaps even this  
may sometimes err, but its errors are lioiielt, so­  
litary and short-lived. Let us then iny dear  
friends, for ever bow down to the general reason  
of the society. We are fafe with that, even in  
its deviations, for it soon returns again to the  
right way. These are leflbns we have learnt to­  
gether—we have prospered in their practice ;  
and the liberality with which you are pleafedto  
approve iny attachment to the general rights of  
mankind, allures me we are still together in these  
its kindred sentiments.  
  
Wherever 1 may be flationed by the will of my  
country, it will be my delight to fee in the gene­  
ral tide of happiness, that your&#x27;s too flows 011 in  
just place and ineafure. That it may flow through  
all time, gatheringftrength as it goes, andfpread­  
ing the happy influence of reason and liberty  
over the face of the earth, is my fervent prayer  
to Heaven.

circumstance, he added these words,

warded us with a happy issue from our

alone to enjoy in peace and concord
