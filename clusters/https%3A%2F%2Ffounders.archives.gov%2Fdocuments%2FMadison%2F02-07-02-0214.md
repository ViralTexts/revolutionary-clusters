The explanations, which the government of France, has given to his Catholic Majesty concerning the sale of Louisiana to the United States, and the amicable dispositions on the part of the King my master towards these States, have determined him to abandon the oposition, which at a prior period and with the most substantial motives, he had manifested against that transaction.
