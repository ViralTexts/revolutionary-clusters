It having been found impracticable to employ Majr. Lenfant about the federal city, in that degree of subordination which was lawful and proper, he has been notified that his services are at an end. It is now proper that he should receive the reward of his past services, and the wish that he should have no just cause of discontent suggests that it should be liberal. The President thinks of 2500. or 3000. dollars, but leaves the determination to you.—Ellicot is to go on, the week after the next, to finish laying off the plan on the ground, and surveying and platting the district. I have remonstrated with him on the excess of five dollars a day and his expences; and he has proposed striking off the latter; but this also is left to you, and to make the allowance retrospective. He is fully apprised that he is entirely under your orders, and that there will be no person employed but under your orders.—The enemies of this enterprize will take advantage of the retirement of Lenfant to trumpet an abortion of the whole. This will require double exertions to be counteracted. I inclose you the p

subordinate capacity, his duty being to sur­  
vey and plat the ground in accordance  
with the plan laid down by L&#x27;Enfant. His  
experience and knowledge of the ground  
gave him advantages over other candidates

It was finally determined to employ him,  
and Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State,  
writes them, that &quot;Maj. Ellicott is to go
