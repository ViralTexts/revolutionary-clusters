Monticello Aug. 26. 1808.  
  
In answer to the petition which you delivered me from the officers of merchant vessels belonging to Philadelphia, I must premise my sincere regret at the sacrifices which our fellow citizens generally, and the petitioners in particular, have been obliged to meet by the circumstances of the times. we live in an age of affliction, to which the history of nations presents no parallel. we have for years been looking on Europe covered with blood and violence, and seen rapine spreading itself over the ocean. on this element it has reached us, &amp; at length in so serious a degree, that the legislature of the nation has thought it necessary to withdraw our citizens &amp; property from it, either to avoid, or to prepare for engaging in the general contest. but for this timely precaution, the petitioners &amp; their property might now have been in the hands of Spoilers, who have laid aside all regard to moral right. withdrawing from the greater evil, a lesser one has been necessarily encountered and certainly, could the legislature have made provision against this also, I should have had great pleasure as the instrument of it’s execution. but it was impracticable, by any general &amp; just rules, to prescribe in every case the best resource against the inconveniences of this new situation. the difficulties of the crisis will certainly fall with greater pressure on some descriptions of citizens than on others; &amp; on none perhaps with greater than our seafaring brethren. should any means of alleviation occur within the range of my duties, I shall with certainty advert to the situation of the petitioners, &amp;, in availing the nation of their services, aid them with a substitute for their former occupations.

Sirs, —In answer to the petition which you  
delivered me from the officers in merchants  
vessels belonging to Philadelphia, I must  
premise my sincere regret at the sacrifices  
which our fellow-citizens in general, and  
the petitioners in particular, have been ob-  
liged to meet by the circumstances of the  
times. We live in an age of affliction, to  
which the history of nations presents no  
parellel—we have for years been looking on  
Enrope, covered with blood and violence,  
and seen rapine spreading itself over the  
ocean. On this element it has reached us,

and at length in so serious a degree, that  
the legislature of the nation has thought it  
necessary to withdraw our citizens and pro-  
perty from it, either to avoid or to prepare  
for engaging in the general contest. But  
for this timely precaution, the petilioners  
and their property might now have been in  
the hands of spoilers, who have laid aside  
all regard to moral right. Withdrawing  
from the greater evil, a lesser one has been  
necessarily encountered, and certainly, could  
the Jegislature have made provision against  
this also, I should have had great pleasure,  
as the instrument of its execution, but it  
was it impracticable, by any general and just  
rules, to prescribe in every case the best  
resource against the inconveniences of this  
new situation. The difficulties of the  
crisis will certainly fall with greater pressure  
on some description of citizens than others,  
and on none perhaps with greater than on  
our seafaring brethren. Should any means  
of alleviation occur within the range of  
my duties, I shal] with certainty advert  
to the situation of the petitioners, and in  
availing the nation of their services, aid  
them with a substitute for their former oc-  
cupation. I salute them and yourself with  
sentiments of sincere regard—Tuos, Jer-
