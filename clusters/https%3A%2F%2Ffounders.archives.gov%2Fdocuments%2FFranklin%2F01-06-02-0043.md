]  
It is now near three years since I received your excellent Observations on the Increase of Mankind, &amp;c. in which you have with so much sagacity and accuracy shewn in what manner, and by what causes, that principal means of political grandeur is best promoted; and have so well supported those just inferences you have occasionally drawn, concerning the general state of our American colonies, and the views and conduct of some of the inhabitants of Great-Britain.  
You have abundantly proved that natural fecundity is hardly to be considered, because the vis generandi, as far as we know, is unlimited, and because experience shews that the numbers of nations is altogether governed by collateral causes, and among these none of so much force as quantity of subsistence, whether arising from climate, soil, improvement of tillage, trade, fisheries, secure property, conquest of new countries, or other favourable circumstances.  
As I perfectly concurred with you in your sentiments on these heads, I have been very desirous of building somewhat on the foundation you have there laid; and was induced by your hints in the twenty-first section, to trouble you with some thoughts on the influence manners have always had, and are always likely to have on the numbers of a people, and their political prosperity in general. [I have been prevented executing this by a Disorder on my Spirits that has hitherto made it very uneasy to me to lay my Thoughts together on any Subject; this Obstruction is not removed, tho’ lessened, but I shall endeavour to prepare a few Sheets for your Perusal against Mr. Winslow’s Departure.]  
The end of every individual is its own private good. The rules it observes in the pursuit of this good, are a system of propositions, almost every one founded in authority, that is, derive their weight from the credit given to one or more persons, and not from demonstration.  
And this, in the most important as well as the other affairs of life, is the case even of the wisest and philosophical part of the human species; and that it should be so is the less strange, when we consider that it is, perhaps, impossible to prove, that being, or life itself, has any other value than what is set on it by authority.  
A confirmation of this may be derived from the observation, that in every country in the universe, happiness is sought upon a different plan; and, even in the same country, we see it placed by different ages, professions, and ranks of men, in the attainment of enjoyments utterly unlike.  
These propositions, as well as others, framed upon them, become habitual by degrees, and, as they govern the determination of the will, I call them moral habits.  
There are another set of habits that have the direction of the members of the body, that I call therefore mechanical habits. These compose what we commonly call The Arts, which are more or less liberal or mechanical, as they more or less partake of assistance from the operations of the mind.  
The cumulus of the moral habits of each individual, is the manners of that individual; the cumulus of the manners of individuals makes up the manners of a nation.  
The happiness of individuals is evidently the ultimate end of political society; and political welfare, or the strength, splendour, and opulence of the state, have been always admitted, both by political writers, and the valuable part of mankind in general, to conduce to this end, and are therefore desirable.  
The causes that advance or obstruct any one of these three objects, are external or internal. The latter may be divided into physical, civil, and personal, under which last head I comprehend the moral and mechanical habits of mankind. The physical causes are principally climate, soil, and number of subjects; the civil are government and laws; and political welfare is always in a ratio composed of the force of these particular causes; a multitude of external causes, and all these internal ones, not only controul and qualify, but are constantly acting on, and thereby insensibly, as well as sensibly, altering one another, both for the better and the worse, and this not excepting the climate itself.  
The powerful efficacy of manners in increasing a people, is manifest from the instance you mention, the Quakers; among them industry and frugality multiplies and extends the use of the necessaries of life; to manners of a like kind are owing the populousness of Holland, Switzerland, China, Japan, most parts of Indostan, &amp;c. in every one of which the force of extent of territory and fertility of soil is multiplied, or their want compensated by industry and frugality.  
Neither nature nor art have contributed much to the production of subsistence in Switzerland, yet we see frugality preserves, and even increases families that live on their fortunes, and which, in England, we call the Gentry; and the observation we cannot but make in the Southern part of this kingdom, that those families, including all superior ones, are gradually becoming extinct, affords the clearest proof that luxury (that is, a greater expence of subsistence than in prudence a man ought to consume) is as destructive as a proportionable want of it; but in Scotland, as in Switzerland, the Gentry, though one with another they have not one-fourth of the income, increase in number.  
And here I cannot help remarking, by the by, how well founded your distinction is between the increase of mankind in old and new settled countries in general, and more particularly in the case of families of condition. In America, where their expences are more confined to necessaries, and those necessaries are cheap, it is common to see above one hundred persons descended from one living old man. In England it frequently happens, where a Man has seven, eight, or more children, there has not been a descendant in the next generation, occasioned by the difficulties the number of children has brought on the family, in a luxurious dear country, and which have prevented their marrying.  
That this is more owing to luxury than meer want, appears from what I have said of Scotland, and more plainly from parts of England remote from London, in most of which the necessaries of life are nearly as dear, in some dearer than in London, yet the people of all ranks marry and breed up children.  
Again; among the lower ranks of life, none produce so few children as servants. This is, in some measure, to be attributed to their situation, which hinders marriage, but it is also to be attributed to their luxury, and corruption of manners, which are greater than among any other set of people in England, and is the consequence of a nearer view of the lives and persons of a superior rank, than any inferior rank, without a proper education, ought to have.  
The quantity of subsistence in England has unquestionably become greater for many ages; and yet if the inhabitants are more numerous, they certainly are not so in proportion to our improvement of the means of support. I am apt to think there are few parts of this kingdom that have not been at some former time more populous than at present. I have several cogent reasons for thinking so, of great part of the counties I am most intimately acquainted with; but as they were probably not all most populous at the same time, and as some of our towns are visibly and vastly grown in bulk, I dare not suppose, as judicious men have done, that England is less peopled than heretofore.  
This growth of our towns is the effect of a change of manners, and improvement of arts, common to all Europe; and though it is not imagined that it has lessened the country growth of necessaries, it has evidently, by introducing a greater consumption of them, (an infallible consequence of a nation’s dwelling in towns) counteracted the effects of our prodigious advances in the arts.  
But however frugality may supply the place of, or prodigality counteract the effects of the natural or acquired subsistence of a country, industry is, beyond doubt, a more efficacious cause of plenty than any natural advantage of extent or fertility. I have mentioned instances of frugality and industry united with extent and fertility; in Spain and Asia minor, we see frugality joined to extent and fertility, without industry; in Ireland we once saw the same; Scotland had then none of them but frugality. The change in these two countries is obvious to every one, and it is owing to industry not yet very widely diffused in either.  
  
The effects of industry and frugality in England are surprizing; both the rent and the value of the inheritance of land depend on them greatly more than on nature, and this though there is no considerable difference in the prices of our markets. Land of equal goodness lets for double the rent of other land lying in the same county, and there are many years purchase difference between different counties, where rents are equally well paid and secure.  
Thus manners operate upon the number of inhabitants, but of their silent effects upon a civil constitution, history and even our own experience, yields us abundance of proofs, though they are not uncommonly attributed to external causes: Their support of a government against external force is so great, that it is a common maxim among the advocates of liberty, that no free government was ever dissolved, or overcome, before the manners of its subjects were corrupted.  
The superiority of Greece over Persia, was singly owing to their difference of manners; and that, though all natural advantages were on the side of the latter, to which I might add the civil ones; for though the greatest of all civil advantages, Liberty, was on the side of Greece, yet that added no political strength to her, than as it operated on her manners, and, when they were corrupted, the restoration of their liberty by the Romans, overturned the remains of their power.  
Whether the manners of ancient Rome were, at any period, calculated to promote the happiness of individuals, it is not my design to examine; but that their manners, and the effects of those manners on their government, and publick conduct, founded, enlarged, and supported, and afterwards overthrew their empire, is beyond all doubt. One of the effects of their conquest furnishes us with a strong proof how prevalent manners are, even beyond quantity of subsistence; for, when the custom of bestowing on the citizens of Rome corn enough to support themselves and families, was become established, and Egypt and Sicily produced the grain that fed the inhabitants of Italy, this became less populous every day, and the Jus trium liberorum was but an expedient that could not balance the want of industry and frugality.  
But corruption of manners did not only thin the inhabitants of the Roman empire, it rendered the remainder incapable of defence, long before its fall, perhaps before the dissolution of the Republic: so that without standing disciplined armies composed of men, whose moral habits principally, and mechanical habits secondarily, made them different from the body of the people, the Roman empire had been a prey to the Barbarians many ages before it was.  
By the mechanical habits of the soldiery, I mean their discipline, and the art of war; and that this is but a secondary quality, appears from the inequality that has in all ages been between raw, though well disciplined armies, and veterans, and more from the irresistible force of a single moral habit, Religion, has conferred on troops frequently neither disciplined nor experienced.  
The military manners of the Noblesse in France, compose the chief force of that kingdom, and the enterprizing manners, and restless dispositions of the inhabitants of Canada have enabled a handful of men to harrass our populous, and, generally, less martial colonies; yet neither are of the value they seem at first sight, because, overbalanced by the defect they occasion of other habits that would produce more eligible political good: And military manners in a people are not necessary in an age and country where such manners may be occasionally formed and preserved among men enough to defend the state; and such a country is Great-Britain, where, though the lower class of people are by no means of a military cast, yet they make better soldiers than even the Noblesse of France.  
The inhabitants of this country, a few ages back, were to the populous and rich provinces of France, what Canada is now to the British colonies. It is true, there was less disproportion between their natural strength; but I mean that the riches of France were a real weakness opposed to the military manners founded upon poverty and a rugged disposition, then the character of the English; but it must be remembered, that at this time the manners of a people were not distinct from that of their soldiery, for the use of standing armies has deprived a military people of the advantages they before had over others; and though it has been often said, that civil wars give power, because they render all men soldiers, I believe this has only been found true in internal wars, following civil wars, and not in external ones; for now, in foreign wars, a small army with ample means to support it, is of greater force than one more numerous, with less. This last fact has often happened between France and Germany.  
  
The means of supporting armies, and, consequently, the power of exerting external strength, are best found in the industry and frugality of the body of a people living under a government and laws that encourage commerce, for commerce is at this day almost the only stimulus that forces every one to contribute a share of labour for the publick benefit.  
But such is the human frame, and the world is so constituted, that it is a hard matter to possess ones self of a benefit, without laying ones self open to a loss on some other side; the improvements of manners of one sort, often deprave those of another: Thus we see industry and frugality under the influence of commerce, which I call a commercial spirit, tend to destroy, as well as support, the government it flourishes under.  
Commerce perfects the arts, but more the mechanical than the liberal, and this for an obvious reason; it softens and enervates the manners. Steady virtue, and unbending integrity, are seldom to be found where a spirit of commerce pervades every thing; yet the perfection of commerce is, that every thing should have its price. We every day see its progress, both to our benefit and detriment here. Things that boni mores are forbid to be set to sale, are become its objects, and there are few things indeed extra commercium. The legislative power itself has been in commercio, and church livings are seldom given without consideration, even by sincere Christians, and for consideration not seldom to very unworthy persons. The rudeness of ancient military times, and the fury of more modern enthusiastic ones, are worn off; even the spirit of forensic contention is astonishingly diminished, all marks of manners softening; but Luxury and Corruption have taken their places, and seem the inseparable companions of Commerce and the Arts.  
I cannot help observing, however, that this is much more the case in extensive countries, especially at their metropolis, than in other places. It is an old observation of politicians, and frequently made by historians, that small states always best preserve their manners; whether this happens from the greater room there is for attention in the legislature, or from the less room there is for Ambition and Avarice, it is a strong argument, among others, against an incorporating union of the colonies in America, or even a federal one, that may tend to the future reducing them under one government.  
  
Their power, while united, is less, but their liberty, as well as manners, is more secure; and, considering the little danger of any conquest to be made upon them, I had rather they should suffer something through disunion, than see them under a general administration less equitable than that concerted at Albany.  
I take it, the inhabitants of Pennsylvania are both frugal and industrious beyond those of any province in America. If luxury should spread, it cannot be extirpated by laws. We are told by Plutarch, that Plato used to say, It was a hard thing to make laws for the Cyrenians, a people abounding in plenty and opulence.  
But from what I set out with, it is evident, if I be not mistaken, that education only can stem the torrent, and without checking either true industry or frugality, prevent the sordid frugality and laziness of the old Irish, and many of the modern Scotch, (I mean the inhabitants of that country, those who leave it for another being generally industrious) or the industry, mixed with luxury, of this capital, from getting ground, and by rendering ancient manners familiar, produce a reconciliation between disinterestedness and commerce; a thing we often see, but almost always in men of a liberal education.  
To conclude; when we would form a people, soil and climate may be found, at least sufficiently good: Inhabitants may be encouraged to settle, and even supported for a while; a good government and laws may be framed, and even arts may be established, or their produce imported; but many necessary moral habits are hardly ever found among those who voluntarily offer themselves in times of quiet at home, to people new colonies; besides that the moral, as well as mechanical habits, adapted to a mother country, are frequently not so to the new settled one, and to external events, many of which are always unforeseen. Hence it is we have seen such fruitless attempts to settle colonies, at an immense public and private expence, by several of the powers of Europe: And it is particularly observable that none of the English colonies became any way considerable, till the necessary manners were born and grew up in the county [country], excepting those to which singular circumstances at home forced manners fit for the forming a new state. I am, Sir, &amp;c.

I’ is now near three years fince I re-  
ceived your excelient Obfervations on  
the Increate of Mankind, &amp;c. [See that  
letter inferted in our laft] in which you  
have with fo much fagacity and accuracy  
fhewn in what manner, and by what cau-  
ies, that principal means of political gran-  
deur is beft promoted ; and have fo well  
fupported thofe juft inferences you have oc-  
cafionally drawn, concerning the general  
ftate of our American colonies, and the  
views and conduét of fome of the inhabi-  
tants of Great Britain.  
  
You have abundantly proved that natu-  
ral fecundity is hardly to be confidered,  
becaufe the vis generandi, as far as we  
know, is unlimited, and becaufe experience  
thews that the number of nations is alto-  
gether governed by collateral eAufes, and  
among thefe none of fo much force as  
quantity of, fubfitence, whether arifing  
trom climate, foil, improvement of tillage,  
tiade, fitheries, fecure property, conqueft  
of new countries, or other favourable cir-  
cumftances.  
  
As I perfe&amp;tly concurred with you in  
yoér fentiments on thefe heads, I have been  
very defirous of building fomewhat on the  
foundation you have there laid ; and wasin-  
duced, by your hints in the twenry. fir  
fetion, to trouble you with fome thoughts  
on the influence manners have always had,  
and are always likely to have on the num-  
bers of a people, and pheir political profpe-  
tity in general,  
  
The end of every individua} is its own  
private good. The rules it oblerves in the  
purfuit ot this good, are a fyftem of pro-  
pofitions, almoitevery one founded in au-  
thority, that is, derive their weight from  
the credit given to one or more perfons,  
and not from demonftration.  
  
And this, in the moft important as well  
as the other affairs of tife, is the cafe even  
of the wifeft and philofophical part of the  
human fpecies ; and that it fhould be {o is  
the lefs ftrange, when we confider that it  
is, perhaps, impoffible to prove, that being,  
or lite itfelf, has any other value than  
what is fet on it by authority.  
  
A confirmation of this may be derived  
  
from the obfervation, that, in every coun-  
try in the univerfe, happinets is fought  
upon a different plan; and, ever in the  
fame country, we fee it placed by different  
ages, profcffions, and ranks of men, in the  
attainment of enjoyments utterly unlike.  
  
Thefe propofitions, as well as others,  
framed upon them, become habitual by de  
grees, and, as they govern the determina-  
tion of the wili, I call them moral habits.  
  
There are another fet of habits that  
have the dire&amp;tion of the members of the  
body, that I call therefore mechanical ha  
bits. Thefe compofe what we commonly  
call The Arts, which are more or lefs libe-  
ral or mechanical, as they more or lefs  
partake of affiftance from the operations of  
the mind,  
  
The cumulus of the moral habits of  
each individual is the manners of that in-  
dividual; the cumulus of the manners  
of individuals makes up the manners of a  
nation,  
  
The happinefs of individuals is evi-  
dently the ultimate end of pol:tical fociety 5  
and political welfare, or the ftrength,  
fplendor, and opulence of the ftate,  
have been always admitted, both by politi«  
cal writers, and the valuable part of man-  
kind in general, to conduce to this end,  
and are therefore defirable. j  
  
The caufes that advance or cbftrué any  
one of thefe three objeéts, are external or  
internal, The latter may be divided into  
ee civil, and perfonal, under which  
  
aft head I comprehend the moral and me-  
chanical habits of mankind. ‘The phyfi-  
fical caufes are principally climate, foil,  
number of fubjeéts ; the civil are governs  
ment and laws; and political weitare ig  
always in a ratio compofed of the force o  
  
thefe particular caufes; a multitude of ex  
ternal caufes, and all thefe internal ones,  
not only controul and qualify, but are cone  
ftantly aéting on, and thereby infenfibly,  
as well as fenfibly, altering one another,  
both for the better and the worfe, and this  
not excepting the climate itfelf.  
  
The powerful efficacy of manners in in-  
creaiing a people is manifeft from the inp  
ftance you mention, the Quakers; among

them isduftry and frugality multiply and  
extend the ufe of the neceffaries of life;  
to manners of a like kind are owing the  
populoufnefs of Hoiland, Switzerland,  
China, Japan, moft parts of Indoftan, &amp;c.  
in every one of which the force of extent  
of territory and fertility of foil is multi-  
plied, or their want compenfated by induf-  
try and frugality,  
  
Neither-nature nor art have contributed  
much to the produétion of tubfiftence in  
Switzerland, yet we fee frugality preferves,  
and even increafes families that live on  
their fortunes, and which, in England, we  
call the Gentry ; and the obiervation we  
cannot but make in the fouthesn part of this  
kingdom, that thofe families, including all  
fiperior ones, are gradually becoming ex-  
ting, affords the cleareft proof that lnxury  
(that is, a greater expence of fubliftence  
than in prudence a man ought to eonfume)  
is as deftructive as a proportionable want  
of it ; but in Scotland, as in Switzerland,  
the Gentry, though one with anotner they  
have not one. fourth of the income, increale  
in number.  
  
And here I cannot help remarking, by  
the bye, how wail founded your diftinction  
is between the increafe of mankind in old  
and new fettled countries in general, and  
more particularly in the cafe of families of  
condition. In Americ3, where their ex-  
pences are more confined to neceflaries,and  
thofe neceffaries are cheap, it is common  
to fee above one hundred perfons defcended  
from one living old man. In England it  
frequently happens, where a man has feven,  
eight, or more children, there has not been  
a defcendent in the next generation, occa  
fioned by the difficulties the numberof chil-  
dren has brought on the family, in a luxu-  
rious dear country, and which have pre-  
vented their marrying.  
  
That this is mére owing to luxury-than  
  
mere want appears from what T have faid  
of Scotland, and more plainly from parts  
of England remote from London, in moft  
of which the neceffaries of life are nearly  
as dear, in fome dearer‘than in London,  
yet the people ef all ranks marry and  
breed up children.  
’ Again; among the lower ranks of life,  
none produce fo few children as fervants.  
This is, in fome meafure, to be attributed  
to their fituation, which hinders marriage;  
but it is alfoto be attributed to their lux-  
ury,and corruption of manners, which are  
greater than among any other fet of peovle  
in England, and are ihe confequence of a  
nearer view of the lives and perfons ofa fu-  
@erior rank, than any inferior rank, with-  
‘out a proper education, ought to have.  
  
‘  
  
THE SUPPLEMENT TO  
  
The quantity of fubfiftence in England  
has unqueftionably become greater for  
many ages ; and yet, if the inhabitants are  
more numerous, they certainly are not fa  
in proportion to our imprevement of the  
means of fupport. I am apt tothink there  
are few parts of this kingdom that have  
not been at fome former time more populous  
than at prefent. I have feveral cogent  
reafons for thinking fo, of great part of the  
counties [ am moft intimately acquainted  
with ; but as they were probably not all  
moftt populous at the fame time, and ag  
fome of our towns are vifibly and vaftly  
grown in bulk, I dare not fuppofe, as ju-  
dicious men have done, that England is  
lefs peopled than heretofore.  
  
This growth ofour towns is the effect of  
a change of manners, and improvement of  
arts, Common to all Europe; and though  
It is not imagined that it has leflened the  
country growth of neceffaries, it has evi-  
dently, by introducing a greater confump-  
tion of them, (an infallible confequence of  
a nation’s dwelling in towns) counteragted  
the effeéts of our prodigious advances inthe  
arts.  
  
But however frugality may fupply the  
place of, or prodigality counteract the ef.  
fe&amp;s of the natural or acquired fubfiftence  
of a country, induftry is, beyond doubt, a  
more effiacious caufe of plenty than any  
natural advantage of extent of fertility,  
I have mentioned inftances of frugality  
and induftry united with extent and ferti-  
lity ; in Spain and Afia minor, we fee fru-  
gality joined to extent and fertility, with-  
out induftry ; in Ireland we once faw&#x27;the  
fame; Scotland had then none of them but  
frugality. The change in thefe two coun-  
tries is obvious tq every one, and it is ow.  
ing to induftry not yet very widely diffuf-  
ed in either,  
  
The effeéts of induftry and frugality in  
England are furprifing ; both the rent and  
the value of the inheritance of and depend  
on them greatly more than on nature, and  
this though there is no confiderable dif-  
ference in the prices of our markets. Land  
of equal goodnefs lets for double the rent  
of other land lying in the fame county, and  
there are many years purchafe difference  
between different counties, where rents are  
equally well paid and fecure.  
  
Thus manners operate upon the number  
of inhabitants, but of their filent effects  
upon a civil conttitution, hiftory and even  
our own experience, yield us abundance  
of proofs, though they are notat all uncom-  
monly attributed to external caufes: Their

‘mong the advocates of liberty, that no free  
government was ever diffolved, or over-  
come, before the manners of its fubjetts  
were corrupted.  
  
The fuperiority of Greece over Perfia  
was fingly owing to their difference of  
manners ; and that, though all natural ad-  
vantages were on the fide of the latter, to  
which I might add the civil ones; for  
though the greateft of all civil advantages,  
liberty, was onthe fide of Greece, yet that  
added no political ftrength to her, than as  
it operated on her manners, and, when  
they were corrupted, the reftoration of  
their liberty by the Romans overturned  
the remains of their power,  
  
Whether the manners of ancient Rome  
were, at any period, calculated to promote  
the happinefs of individuals, it is not my  
defign to examine; but that their manners,  
and the effeéts of thofe manners on their  
government, and public condué, founded,  
enlarged, and fupported, and afterwards  
overthrew theirempire, is beyond all doubt.  
One of the effects of their conque(t fur-  
nifhes us with a ftrong proof how preva-  
Jent manners are, even beyond quantity of  
fubfiftence; for, when the cuftom of beftow-  
ing on the citizens of Rome corn enough  
to fupport themfelves and families was be-  
come eftablifhed, and Egypt and Sicily  
produced the grain that fed the inhabitants  
of Italy, this became lefs populous every  
day, and the * Jus trium liberorum’ was  
but an expedient that could not balance  
the want of induftry and frugaiity.  
  
But corruption of manners did not only  
thin the inhabitants of the Roman empire,  
it rendered the rematnder incapable of de-  
fence, long before its fall, perhaps before  
the diffolution of the Republic : So that  
without ftanding difciplined armies com-  
pofed of men, whofe moral habits princi-  
pally, and mechanical habits fecondarily,  
made them d fferent from the body of the  
the people, the Roman empire had been  
a prey to the barbarians many ages before  
it was,  
  
By the mechanical habits of the foldiery,  
I mean their dsfcipline, and the art of war ;  
and that this is but a fecondary quality ap-  
pears from’ the inequality that has in all  
ages been between raw, though well dif-  
ciplined armies, and veterans, and more  
from their refiftible force which a fingle mo-  
ral habit, rel:gion, has conferred on troops  
frequently neither difciplined nor experi-  
enced,  
  
The military manners of the Nobleffe  
in France compofe the chief force of that  
kingdom, and the enterprifing manners  
gad reftlefs di‘pofitions of the inhabitants  
  
35%  
  
of Canada have embled a handful of ment  
to harrafs our populous, and, generally;  
lefs martial colonies; yet neither are of  
the value they feem at firft fight, becaafe  
overbalanced by the deteét they oceafion  
of other habits that would produce more  
eligible political good: And _ military  
maoners in a people are not neceffary in an  
age and country where fuch manners may  
be occafionally formed and preferved a-  
mong men enough to defend the State ; and  
fuch a country is Great Britain, where,  
though the lower clafs of people are by ne  
means of a military caft, yet they make  
better foldiers than even the Nobleife of  
France,  
  
The inhabitants of this country, a few  
ages back, were, to the populous and rich  
provinces of France, what Canada is now  
to the Britifh colonies, It is true, there  
was lefs difproportion between their natu  
ral ftrength ; but I mean that the riches  
of France were a real weaknefs oppofed to  
the military manners founded upon poverty  
and a rugged difpofition, then the charac  
ter of the Engiith ; but it muft be remem-  
bered, that at this time the manners ‘of a  
people were not diftin&amp;t from that of their  
foldiery, for the ufe of ttanding armies has  
deprived a military people of the advar-  
tages they before had over others; ond  
though it has peen often faid, that civil  
parm power, becanfe they render all  
men foldiers, 1 believe this has only beem  
found true in internal wars, following  
civil wars, and not in external ones ; far  
now, in foreign wars,&#x27;a {mall army with  
ample means to fapport it, is of greater  
force than one more numerous, with lef?.  
This lat fa&amp; has often happened betweeta  
France and Germany,  
  
The means of fupporting armies, and,  
confequently, the power of exerting extet-  
nal ftrength, are beft found in the induftry  
and frugality of the body ofa people living  
uader a governshent and laws that encou-  
rage commerce, for commerce is at this  
day almoft the only ftrmulus that forces e-  
very one to.contribute a fhare of labour for  
the public benefit.  
  
But fuch is the human frame, and the  
world is fo confituted, that it is a hard  
matter.to poffefs one’s felf of a benefit, with-  
out laying one felf open to a lois on fome  
other fide; the improvements of man-  
ners of one fort often deprave thofe of an-  
other: Thus we fee indultry and fruga-  
lity under the influence of commerce,  
which I call a commercial fpirit, tend te  
deltroy, as well as fupport, the government  
it flourifhes under. ’  
  
Commesce perfedts the arts, bat more  
  
the  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
352  
the mechanical than the liberal, and this  
fer an obvious reafon; it foftens and  
enervates the manners, Steady virtue,  
and unbending integrity, are feldom to be  
found where a fpirit of commerce pervades  
every thing; yet the perfeétion of com-  
merce is, that every thing thould have its  
rice. We every day fee its progrefs,  
th to our benefit and detriment here.  
Things that ‘ boni. mores’ are forbid to  
pe fet to fale, are become its objects, and  
there are few things indeed ‘ extra com-  
mercium.” The legiflative power itfelf  
has been ¢ in commercio,’ and church liv-  
ings are feldom given without confidera-  
tion, even by fincere Chriftians, and for  
‘\confiderations not feldom to every unwor-  
thy perfons. The rudenefs ancient  
military times, and the fury of more mo-  
dern enthufiattic ones, are worn off ; even  
the fpirit of forenfic contention is aftonifh-  
anely diminifhed, all marks of manners  
fottening 5 but luxury and corruption have  
taken their places, and feem the infepara-  
-ble companions of commerce and the arts.  
  
Icannot helpobferving, however,that this  
  
4smuch more the cafe in extenfive countries,  
-efpecially at their metropolis, than in other  
eplaces. It.is an old obteryation of politi-  
cians, and frequently made by -hiflorians,  
that fmall ftatesalways bet prefegve man-  
ners; whether this happens from the  
greater room, there is for attention in the  
Legiflature, or from the lefs room there is  
for ambition and avarice, it is a ftrong ar-  
gument, among others, againft an incorpo-  
rating union of the colonies in America,  
or even a fedéral one, that may tend  
to the future reducing them under one go-  
.vernment,  
  
Their power, while united, -is lefs, but  
their liberty, as well as manners, is more  
-fecure ; and, confidering the little danger  
of any conqueft to be made upon them, I  
had rather they fhould fuffer fomething  
through difunion, than fee them.undera ge-  
nera] adminiftration lefs equitable. than that  
eoncerted at Albany.  
  
I take it, the inhabitants of Pennfylva-  
  
THE SUPPLEMENT TO  
  
nia are both frugal and induftrious beyond  
thofe of any province in America. If  
luxury fhould fpread, it cannot be extir:  
pated by laws. We are told by Plutarch,  
that Plato ufed to fay, ‘ It was a hard  
thing to make laws for the Cyrenians, a  
people abounding in plenty and opulence,  
ut from what I fet out with it is evi.  
dent, if I be not miftaken, that education  
only can ftem the torrent, and, without  
checking true induftry or frugality, pre-  
vent the fordid frugatity and lazinefs of  
the old Irith, and many of the modern  
Scotch, (I mean the inhabitants of that  
country, thofe who leave it for another be-  
ing generally induftrious) or the induftry,  
mixed with luxury, of this capitalf from  
getting ground, and by rendesing ancient  
manners familiar, produce a reconciliation  
between difintereftednefs and commerce;  
a thing we often fee, but, almoft always in  
men ofa liberal education.  
  
To conclude ; when we would forma  
people, foil and climate may be found, at  
eaft fufficient good : Inhabitants may be  
encouraged to fettle, and even fupported  
for a while; a good government and laws  
may be framed, and even arts may be efta-  
blithed, or their produce imported; but  
many neceffary moral habits are hardly evet  
found among thofe who voluntarily of-  
fer themfelves in times quiet at home, to  
people new colonies ; befides that the mo-  
ral, as well.as mechanical habits, adapted  
to a mother country, are frequently not  
fo to the new fettled one, and to exters  
nal events, many of which are always un-  
forefeen. Hence it is we’ have feen fuch  
fruitlefs attemptsto fettle colonies, at an  
immenfe public and privateyexpence, by  
feveral of the powers of Europe: And it  
is particularly observable: thatmone of thé  
Englifh colonies became any way confider-  
able tll the neceflary manners were born  
and grew up in the country, excepting  
thofe.to which fingular circumftances at  
home forced manners fit for the forming 4

Franklin thus remarks: &quot; The powerful influence  
of manners in increasing a people, is manifest  
from the instance of the Quakers&#x27;, among them  
industry and frugality multiplies and extends the  
use of the necessaries of life. To manners of a  
like kind are owing the populousness of Holland,  
Switzerland, China, Japan, and most parts of  
Hiiulostan, &lt;fcc.; in every one of which, the force  
of extent of territory and fertility of soil is multi­  
plied, or their wants compensated by industry and  
frugality.&quot;  
Now, Sir, the aforegoing opinions of Dr.  
Franklin, in my opinion, are worthy the grave  
consideration of our Legislatures, and is one of  
the strongest arguments that can be advanced in  
support of the cause we advocate?to exclude all  
foreign paupers from our shores, and to procure  
a repeal of the Naturalization Law?as, likewise,  
to exclude all foreigners from a participation in the  
management of our own affairs. The causes  
that advance or obstruct the increase or prosperity  
of a nation, are external or internal?physical,  
civil and personal; under which last head, I com­  
prehend the moral and mechanical habits of a na­  
tion. These causes united, constantly acting on,  
thereby, insensibly, as well a? sensibly, altering  
one another, eilher for the better or worse, no
