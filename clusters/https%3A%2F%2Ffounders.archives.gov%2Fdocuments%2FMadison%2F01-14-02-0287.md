,Mount Vernon May 20th. 1792.  
As there is a possibility if not a probability, that I shall not see you on your return home; or, if I should see you, that it may be on the Road and under circumstances which will prevent my speaking to you on the subject we last conversed upon; I take the liberty of committing to paper the following thoughts, &amp; requests.  
I have not been unmindful of the sentiments expressed by you in the conversations just alluded to: on the contrary I have again, and again revolved them, with thoughtful anxiety; but without being able to dispose my mind to a longer continuation in the Office I have now the honor to hold. I therefore still look forward to the fulfilment of my fondest and most ardent wishes to spend the remainder of my days (which I can not expect will be many) in ease &amp; tranquility.  
Nothing short of conviction that my deriliction of the Chair of Government (if it should be the desire of the people to continue me in it) would involve the Country in serious disputes respecting the chief Magestrate, &amp; the disagreeable consequences which might result therefrom in the floating, &amp; divided opinions which seem to prevail at present, could, in any wise, induce me to relinquish the determination I have formed: and of this I do not see how any evidence can be obtained previous to the Election. My vanity, I am sure, is not of that cast as to allow me to view the subject in this light.  
Under these impressions then, permit me to reiterate the request I made to you at our last meeting—namely—to think of the proper time, and the best mode of anouncing the intention; and that you would prepare the latter. In revolving this subject myself, my judgment has always been embarrassed. On the one hand, a previous declaration to retire, not only carries with it the appearance of vanity &amp; self importance, but it may be construed into a Manœuvre to be invited to remain. And on the other hand, to say nothing, implys consent; or, at any rate, would leave the matter in doubt; and to decline afterwards might be deemed as bad, &amp; uncandid.  
I would fain carry my request to you farther than is asked above, although I am sensible that your compliance with it must add to your trouble; but as the recess may afford you leizure, and I flatter myself you have dispositions to oblige me, I will, without apology desire (if the measure in itself should strike you as proper, &amp; likely to produce public good, or private honor) that you would turn your thoughts to a Valadictory address from me to the public; expressing in plain &amp; modest terms—that having been honored with the Presidential Chair, and to the best of my abilities contributed to the Organization &amp; Administration of the government—that having arrived at a period of life when the private Walks of it, in the shade of retirement, becomes necessary, and will be most pleasing to me; and the spirit of the government may render a rotation in the Elective Officers of it more congenial with their ideas of liberty &amp; safety, that I take my leave of them as a public man; and in bidding them adieu (retaining no other concern than such as will arise from fervent wishes for the prosperity of my Country) I take the liberty at my departure from civil, as I formerly did at my military exit, to invoke a continuation of the blessings of Providence upon it—and upon all those who are the supporters of its interests, and the promoters of harmony, order &amp; good government.  
That to impress these things it might, among other things be observed, that we are all the Children of the same country—A Country great &amp; rich in itself—capable, &amp; promising to be, as prosperous &amp; as happy as any the Annals of history have ever brought to our view. That our interest, however deversified in local &amp; smaller matters, is the same in all the great &amp; essential concerns of the Nation. That the extent of our Country—the diversity of our climate &amp; soil—and the various productions of the States consequent of both, are such as to make one part not only convenient, but perhaps indispensably necessary to the other part; and may render the whole (at no distant period) one of the most independant in the world. That the established government being the work of our own hands, with the seeds of amendment engrafted in the Constitution, may by wisdom, good dispositions, and mutual allowances; aided by experience, bring it as near to perfection as any human institution ever aproximated; and therefore, the only strife among us ought to be, who should be foremost in facilitating &amp; finally accomplishing such great &amp; desirable objects; by giving every possible support, &amp; cement to the Union. That however necessary it may be to keep a watchful eye over public servants, &amp; public measures, yet there ought to be limits to it; for suspicions unfounded, and jealousies too lively, are irritating to honest feelings; and oftentimes are productive of more evil than good.  
To enumerate the various subjects which might be introduced into such an Address would require thought; and to mention them to you would be unnecessary, as your own judgment will comprehend all that will be proper; whether to touch, specifically, any of the exceptionable parts of the Constitu[t]ion may be doubted. All I shall add therefore at present, is, to beg the favor of you to consider—1st. the propriety of such an Address. 2d. if approved, the several matters which ought to be contained in it—and 3d. the time it should appear: that is, whether at the declaration of my intention to withdraw from the service of the public—or to let it be the closing Act of my Administration—which, will end with the next Session of Congress (the probability being that that body will continue sitting until March,) when the House of Representatives will also dissolve.  
’Though I do not wish to hurry you (the cases not pressing) in the execution of either of the publications beforementioned, yet I should be glad to hear from you generally on both—and to receive them in time, if you should not come to Philadelphia until the Session commences, in the form they are finally to take. I beg leave to draw your attention also to such things as you shall conceive fit subjects for Communication on that occasion; and, noting them as they occur, that you would be so good as to furnish me with them in time to be prepared, and engrafted with others for the opening of the Session. With very sincere and Affectionate regard I am—ever Yours  
Go: Washingto

&quot; Moc.nt Ver.non, May 20, 17S9.  
&quot;My Dear Sir?As (here is a possibility, if not a probability,  
that 1 shall not see you on your return home; or,  
if I should see you, it may be on the road, and under cirfcumstnnces,  
which may prevent my speaking to you on  
the subject we last conversed upon, 1 tuke the liberty of  
committing to paper the following thoughts and requests.  
&quot; 1 have not been unmindful of the sentiments e.vI  
pressed by you in the conversations just alluded to.?  
On the contrary I have again and again revolved litem  
with thoughtful anxiety, but without being able to dispose  
my mind to a longer continuation in (lie office I  
have DO\v?fche honor to hold. 1 therefore still look forward  
to my fondest and most ardent wishes to spend the  
remainder of my days, which 1 cannot expect to be long,  
in ease and tranquillity.  
&quot;Nothing but a conviction, that my declining the  
chair of government, if it should be the desire of the  
people to continue me in it, would involve the cousilry  
&quot; ?i;=r.i?i?o rnon.^iimr tl.p Chief Magistrate, and  
  
mnuvu^ u.jr.^.v?r = ...? ? o ,  
the disagreeable consequences which inVjht re?u!t therefrom  
in the floating and divided opinions, which seem  
to prevail at present, ccu&#x27;.c, in anywise, induce me to ieS?  
linquish the determination 1 have formed; and of this  
J do not see how any evidence can be obtained previous  
to the election. My vanity, I am sure, is not of that  
cast as to allow nie to view the subject in this light.  
&quot; Under these impressions, then, permit me to reiterate  
the request 1 made to you at our last meeting, namely,  
to think of the proper lime and the best mode of announcing  
the intention, and that yrtu wouid prepare the  
latter. In revolving this subject myself, my judgment  
has always been embarrassed. Oil the one hand, a pievious  
declaration to retire, not only carries with it the  
appearance of vanity end self-importance, but it may he  
coustrued into a manoeuvre, to he invited to-reinam; and  
on the other hand, to say r.dtliinrr, implies consent, or,  
at any rate, would leave the P.Vifttr/&#x27;rn*-doubt: and to decline  
afterwards might be deemed as baa^riJ-encaiM&#x27;id.  
&quot; I would fain carry my request to you farther than is  
asked above, although i am sensible that your compliance  
with it must add to your trouble. Hut as the recess  
may afford yon leisure, and I flatter myself you have dispositions  
to oblige me, 1 will, without apology, desire, if  
the measure in itself should strike you as proper,-or like­  
  
Jy to produce puonc gonu or private nun..., ...... j. pj^  
would turn your thoughts to a Valedictory Address from  
me to the public, expressing in plain and modest terms,  
that, having been honored with the Presidential Chair,  
and to the hest of my abilities contributed to ti:e organization  
and administration qf the Government; that,  
havingarrived at a period of life, when the private walks  
U&amp;. of it in the shades of retirement became necessary, and  
will be most pleasing to tne; and lite spirit of the Government  
may render a rotation in the elective officers  
of it more congenial with their ideas of liberty and safety,  
that 1 take my leave of them as a public man ; and,  
in bidding thern adieu, retaining no other-concern than  
&gt;&#x27; ouch as will arise from fervent wishes for the prosperity of  
my country, I lake the liberty at my departure from civil,  
as 1 formerly did at my military exit, to invoke a conJ  
tinuation of the blessings of Providence upon it, and upon  
all those who are the supporters of its interests, and  
the promoters of harmony, order, and good Government.  
&quot;That, to impress these things, it might among other  
topics be observed, that we are all the children of the  
same country, a country great and rich in itself, capable,  
and promising to bo as prosperous and happy as any  
which the annals of history have ever brought to our  
view ;?tint our interest, however diversified in local  
und smaller matters, is the same in all the great end essential  
concerns of the nation;?that the exterttof onr  
country, the diversity of our climate and soil, arid the  
various productions of the States consequent of both,tare  
such as to make one part not only convenient, but-pcrlinos  
indispensably necessary to the other part, and may  
render the whole, at no distant period, one of the most  
independent (nations) in the world ; that live established  
government, being the work of our own hands, with the  
vij seeds of amendment engrafted in the Constitution, may,  
by wisdom, good dispositions, and mutual allowances,  
.gy! aided by experience, bring it as near to perfection as  
any human institution ever approximated, and therefore  
the only strife among lis ought to be, who should be foremost  
in facilitating and finally-accomplishing such great  
and desirable objects, by giving every possible support  
and cement to the Union ;?that however necessary it  
may be to keep a watchful eye over public servants and  
public measures, yet there ought to be limits to it; for, suspicions  
unfounded and jealousies too lively, are irritating  
to honest feelings, and oftentimes are productive of more  
~y; evil than good.  
;is;. &quot; To enumerate the various subjects, which might be  
  
introduced into such an address, woutu require mougiu;  
nnd to mention them to you would he unnecessary, as  
,V? y0ur own judgment will comprehend all thut will.be proper.  
Whether to touch specifically any of the exceptionable  
parts of the Constitution, may be doubted. All  
I shall add, therefore, at present is, to beg the favor of  
you to consider; First the propriety of such an address;  
t Secondly, if approved, the several matters which ought  
to be contained in it; Thirdly, the time it should appear;  
that is, whether at the declaration of my intention tc  
withdraw from the service of the public, or to let &quot;it be the  
closing act of my administration, which will end with  
the next session of Congress; the probability being that  
that bod^ will continue sitting until March, when the  
House ot Representatives will also dissolve.  
&quot;Though 1 do not wish to hurry you, (the case not  
pressing,) in the execution of either of the publications  
before mentioned, yet 1 should be glad to hear from you  
generally on both, and to receive them in time, if you  
6hould not come to 1 hiladelphia before ilic session coin*  
mences, in the form they arc finally to take. 1 be* leave  
to draw your attention also to such things as yon shall  
conceive fit subjects for communication on that occasion;  
and, noting them as they occur, that you would be so good&#x27;  
as to furnish me with them in time to be prepared, and  
engrafted with others for the opening of the session.  
, With very sincere and affectionate regards,  
1 am ever yours,  
GEORGE WASHINGTON.

&quot;Mount Vernon, May 20, 1770.  
&quot;My dear tin: As there is a Ml  
fiittilitv. if not a nrobabilit v. that i  
j , , , w .  
shall not sco you on your return homo,  
or it I should seo you, it may bo on  
the road, and under circumstances,  
which may prevent my speaking to  
yob on tho subject wo last conversed  
upon, 1 take the liberty of committing  
to paper tho following thoughts and  
requests.  
&quot;I have not been unmindful of the  
sentiments expressed by you in the  
Conversations just alluded to. On the  
contrary 1 have again and again re­  
volved them with thoughtful anxiety,  
but without being able to dispose my  
,irfind to a longer continuation in the  
office 1 have now the honor to hold. i  
therefore still look forward to my fon  
dest and most ardent wishes to spend  
the remainder ot my days, which 1  
.cannot expect to be long, in ease and  
.tranquility.  
&quot;Nothing but a conviction that my  
declining the chair of government if  
n should be the desire of tho people to  
continue mo in it, would involve the  
country in serious disputes respecting  
the chief magistrate, and the disagreea  
bio consequences which might result  
therefrom in the floating and divided  
opinions, which seem to prevail at  
present, could, in any wise, induce  
me to relinquish the determination 1  
have formed and of this 1 do not see  
how any evidence can bo obtained  
previous to the election. My vanity;  
1 am sure, is not of that east as to allow  
me to view tho subject In this light.  
&#x27;Under those impresssions, then  
permit mo to roitorato tho request 1  
made to you at our last meeting, name­  
ly to think of the proper time and the  
best mode of announcing the inten­  
tion, and that you would prepare the  
letter. In revolving this subject my­  
self, my judgement has always been  
1 embarrassed. On the one hand, a  
provious declaration to retire, not only  
carries with it an appearance of vanity  
and self importance, but it may be  
construed into a manoeuvre, to bo in  
vited to remain; and on the other  
hand, to say nothing, implies consent  
or, at any rate, would leave the matter  
in doubt: and to decline afterwards  
might bo deemed as bad, and uncan  
did.  
&quot;I would fain carry my request to  
you farther than is asked above, at  
though 1 am sensible that your com  
pliance with it must add to your trou  
ble, isut as inc recess may auoru you  
leisure, and I (latter myself you have  
dispositions to oblige me, 1 will, with  
out apology, desire, if the measure in  
itself should strike you as proper, or  
likely to produce public good or pri­  
vale honor, that you would turn your  
thoughts to a valedictory address from  
me to tho public, expressing in plain  
and modes terms, thai, having boen  
honored with tho presidential chair,  
gu4 to the bust of my abilities Boitli  
  
Inited to the organizition and adminis  
(ration of the government; that, hav­  
ing arrived at a period of life, when  
  
the private walks of it in the shades  
of retirement become nec-sary, and  
will be most pleasing to m s and the  
spirit of the government may render  
a rotation in the elective officers of it  
more congenial with their ideas of lib­  
erty and safety, that I take my leave of  
them as a public man; and, in bidding  
them adieu, retaining no other concern  
than such as will arise from fervent  
wishes for the prosperity of my coun­  
try, I take the liberty at my departure  
from civil, as I formerly did at my  
military exit, to invoke a continuation  
of the blessings of 1&#x27;rovideiice upon it,  
and upon all those who are the uup  
porters of its interests, and tho promo­  
ters of harmony, order and good gov­  
ernment.&quot;That, to impress theso things, it  
might among other topics he obsci ved,  
that we are all tho children of the  
same country great and rich in itself,  
capable, and promising to be as pros  
perous and happy as any, which the  
annals of history havo ever brought to  
our view that our interest however  
diversified in local and smaller mat  
ters, is the same in all tho great and  
essential concerns of the nation that  
the extent of our country, the diversi­  
ty of our climate and soil, and the va  
rious productions of the states conse  
quent of both, aro such as to make one  
part not only convenient, but perhaps  
indispensably necessary to the other  
part, and may render the whole, at no  
distant poriod, one of the most inde­  
pendent, (nations), in the world; that  
the established government being the  
work of our own hands, with the seeds  
of amendment engrafted in the consti­  
tution, may, by wisdom, good dispo  
sitions and mutual allowances, aided  
by experience, bring it as near to per  
lection as any human institution ever  
approximated, and, therefore, the only  
strife among us ought to be, who  
should be foremost in facilitating and  
finally accomplishing such groat and  
desirable objects, by giving every  
possible support and cement to the  
union that, however necossary it may  
be to keep a watchful cyo over public  
servants and public measures, yet  
thero ought to be limits of it, for sus­  
picions unfounded and jealousies too  
lively are irritating to honest feelings,  
and oftentimes are productive of more  
evil than good)  
To enumerate the various subjects;  
which might bo introduced into such  
an address, would require thought,  
and to mention them to you would be  
unnecessary, as yoir own judgment  
will comprehend alt that will be prop­  
er. Whether to touch specifically any  
of the exceptionable parts of the con  
stitution may be doubted, All 1 shall

Thirdly, the time it should appear;  
that is, whether at the declaration of  
my intontion to Withdraw from tho

the closing act of my administration;  
which will end With the next session  
of congress; tho probability being ih it  
that body will continue sitting until  
March, when the house of representa­  
tives will also dissolve  
&quot;Though I do not wish to hurry  
you, (the case not pressing), in tho ex  
ecution of cither. of tho publications  
before mentioned, yet I should be  
glad to hear from you generally on  
both, and to rocuvc them in time, it  
is i .. I ii i i i.i&#x27;  
you shouu not come to l nuaueipnia

such things as you shall conceive fit  
subjects for communication on that oc­  
casion; and, noting them as they oti-  
cur, that you would be so good as to

&#x27;Mount Vernon, May 20, 1779.  
&quot;My deorsir, As there is a possibility,  
if not a probability I hat I shall not sec you  
on your return home ; or, if I should see  
you, it may be on the road, nnd under cir­  
cumstances which may prevent my speak­  
ing tu you on&#x27;lho subject we last conversed  
upon, 1 take liberty ofcommitting to paper  
the following thoughts and requests.  
&quot;I have not been unmindful of the sen­  
timents expressed by von in the converse  
lion just alluded to. On the contrary, I  
have again and again revolved them with  
thoughtful anxiety, but without being able  
lo dispose my mind to n longer continuation  
in the office I have now the honor to hold.  
1 therefore still look forward to my fundest  
and most ardent wishes In spend the re­  
mainder of my days which I cannot expect  
to be many, in case and tranquility.  
&quot;Nothing but a conviction, that my de­  
clining the chair of government if it should  
be the desire of the people to continue inc  
in it, would involve the country in serious  
disputes respecting the Chief Magistrate,  
and llie disagreeable consequences which  
might result therefrom in the floating and

dence can be obtained previous to the clec  
lion. My vanity, I nni sure, is not of that  
cast, as to allow mo to view tho subject in  
this light.  
&quot;Under these impressions, then, permit  
me to reiterate the request I made to you  
at our last meeting, viz. to think of the  
proper time and the be.-t mode ofannoun  
cing the intention and that you would pre  
pare the latler. In revolving this subject  
myself, my judgment has always been em.  
barraseed. On the one hand, a previous  
declaration to retire, not only carries with  
it the appearance of vanity andself-importance,  
but it may bo construed into a ma  
nctuvrc to be invited to remain ; and on tho  
other hand, to say nothing, implies consent,  
or, ut any rate, would leave the matter in  
doubt ; and to decline aficrwards might  
be deemed as bad, and uncandid.  
&quot;I would fain carry my request to you  
farther than is asked above, although vour  
compliance with it must add to your trouble.  
But as the recess may afford you leisure,  
end 1 flatter myself you havo dispositions  
to obligo me, I will, without apology, de­  
sire, if the measure in itself should Etrihe  
you as proper, or likely to produce public  
good or private honor, that you wuulil turn  
your thought! to a Valedictory Address  
from me to the public, expressing in plain  
and modest terms, that having been lion  
nred with tho Presidential chair, and to the  
best of my abilities contributed to the or­  
ganization and administration of tho gov  
eminent; that having arrived at a period  
of life, when tho private walks of it in the  
shades of retirement became necessary,  
and will be most pleasing to me; and tho  
spirit of the. government may render a ro&#x27;  
totion in the elective officers of it more  
  
congenial with their ideas of liberty and  
safety, that I lake my leave of them as a  
  
public man; and, in bidding them adieu,  
retaining no other concern than such as  
will arise from tervent wishes lor the pros  
pcrity of my country, I take the liberty at  
my departure from civil, as I formerly did  
at my miliiory exit, to invoke tho blessings  
of Providence upon it, and upon all those  
who are the supporters ot its interests, and  
the promoters&#x27; of harmony, order and good  
government.  
&quot;That, to impress these thing, it might  
among other topics bo observed, that we  
arc all tho children ot the same country, a  
country great and rich in itself, capable  
and promising to bo as prosperous and hap. I  
py as any which the annnls ol history have  
ever brought to our view ; that our inter  
est, However diversified in local and smaller  
mailers, is the same in all the great and  
essential concerns of the nation; that the  
extent of our country, the diversity of our  
climate and soil, and the various produc­  
tions of the states consequent of both, arc  
such as lo make one part not only conven­  
ient, but perhaps indispensably necessary  
to the other part, and may render the whole,  
at no distant period, ono of tho most inde­  
pendent (nations) in the world ; that the  
established government, being tho work of  
our own hands, with the seeds of amend­  
ment cngrnfted in I he constitution, may by  
wisdom, good dispositions, and mutual al­  
lowances, hided by experience, bring it as  
near to perfection as any human institution  
ever approximated, and therefore the only  
strife among us ought to be, who should  
be foremost in facilitating and finally acconi  
plishsuch great and desirable objects, by giv  
ing every possible support and cement to the  
Union ; that however necessary it may be  
to keep a watchful eye over public servants  
and public measures, yet there ought to be  
limits to it, for suspicions unfounded and  
jealousies too lively are irritating lo honest  
feelings, ond oftentimes are productive uf  
more evil than good.  
&quot;To enumerate the various subjects,  
which might bo introduced into such an  
address, would require thought, and to  
mention them to you would be unnecessary,  
as your own imminent will comprehend  
all that will be proper. Whether to touch  
specifically any of the exceptionable parts  
ol the constitution may be doubled. All I  
shall add, therefore at present is, to beg  
the favor of you to consider ; First, the  
propriety of such an address; Secondly, if

L Mount VemoTi, May 20, 1T7?). ! (  
&quot; My Dear Sir:?As there is a possibili- J  
f ty, if not a probability, that 1 shall not see I t  
you on your return home; or, if I should j |  
see you, it may boon the road,and under cir- i v  
cumstances, which may prevent my speak-. *  
ing to you on the subject we last conver- j j  
sed upon, I take the liberty ol committing; r  
to paper the following thoughts and requests.! &#x27;  
*1 have not been unmindful of the scnti-1  
meut expressed by you in the conversation j .  
just alluded to. On the contrary, I have i ,  
again and again revolved them with thought-! J  
ful anxiety, but without being able to dispose j  
my mind to a longer continuation in the j *  
office I have now the liouor to- hold. 1&#x27;  
/ .-M t?i. i- 1 . a- i  
  
tnerejoro suit io&lt;?u imwuiu mj iuuu^c-i v*/  
most anient wishes to spend the remainder;  
of my days, which 1 cannot expect to be ^  
long, in ease and tranquility.  
&quot;Nothiuff but a conviction that my decli- J  
O ? | .  
ning the chuir of government, if it should be! 1  
the desire of the people to continue me in if,: 1  
would involve the country in serious dis-M  
putes respecting the chief magistrate, and !  
the disagreeable consequences which might!  
result therefrom in the floating and divided ; i  
opinions, which seem to prevail at present, j !  
could, in anywise, induce me to relinguish I t  
the determiuution I have formed ; and of i  
this I do not see how any evidence can b?; j i  
obtained previous to the election. My van- i 1  
ity, I am sure, is not of that caste to allow ; i  
me to view the subject in this light. J ?  
&quot;Under these impressions, then, permit j J  
me to reiterate the request I made to you at; t  
our last meeting, namely to think of the i t  
4 ?* - onnnim. 1  
  
proper urne uuu uiu woi ui uuuvuu &lt;.  
cing the intention, and that you would pro-*  
pare the latter. In revolving this subject I 1  
myself, my judgment has always been ern- 1  
barrassed. On the one hand a previous l  
declaration to retire, not only carries with 1  
it the appearance of vanity and self-iinpor- i  
tance, but it may be construe)! into a ma-1 i  
naiuvre to be invited to remain; und on the j &lt;  
other hand, to say nothing, implies consent,, i  
-or, at any rate, would leave the matter in i  
doubt; and to decline afterwards might be i  
deemed as bad, and uucandid.  
&quot;I would fain carry my request to you (  
farther than is asked above, although I am &lt;  
sensible that your compliance with it mast &lt;  
add to your trouble.?But as the recess may t  
H afford you leisure, and I flatter myself you t  
9 k have dispositions to oblige me, I will, with- &lt;  
fl b out apology, desire, if the measure in itself 1  
should strike you as proper, or likely toj&lt;  
produce public good or private honor, that ;

a period of life, when the private walks of it 1

if I should see you, that it may be on the road,  
and under circumstances which will prevent my  
speaking to you on the subject we last convers  
ed upon, 1 take the liberty of committing  
to paper the following thoughts and requests.  
  
1 have not been unmindful of the sentiments  
expressed by you in the conversation just alluded  
to; on the contrary, I have again and again re  
volved them, with thoughtful anxiety, but with-  
out being able to dispose my mind to longer con-  
tinuation in the office 1 have now the honor to  
bold. I therefore still look forward to the ful  
hlmeni of my fondest and most ardent wish to  
spend the remainder of my days (which I do uot  
eipect to be many . in ease and tranquility  
  
Nothing short of conviction that my derelic-  
tion of the chair of government (if it &#x27;should be  
the desire of the people to keep me iu it) would  
involve the country in 6erious disputes respecting  
the Chief Magistrate, and the disagreeable con  
sequence* which might result therefrom in the  
rioatinp and divided opinions which seem to pre-  
vail at present, could, in any wise, induce me to  
relinquish the determination I have formed; and  
&lt;&gt;f this I do not see how any evidence can be ob  
tained previous to the election. My vanity, lam  
- ire. is uot of that cast, as to allow me to view  
die subject in this light.  
  
Under these impressions then, permit me to re-  
iterate the request I made to you at our last  
meeting — namely — to think of the proper time,  
and the best mode of announcing the intentioti,  
and that you would prepare the latter. In re vol v  
ing this subject myself, mv judgment has always  
beeu embarrassed. On the one hand, a previous  
declaration to return, not only carries with it the  
appearance of vanity and self- importance, but it  
may be construed into a mauo&#x27;uvre to be invited  
io remain. And on the other hand, to say noth-  
ing implies consent ;&#x27;or, at any rate, would leave  
the matter in doubt; and to decline afterwards  
might be deemed as bad, and uncandid.  
  
I would fain carry my request to you further  
than is asked above, although I am sensible that  
MB compliance with it must add to your trou-  
ble; but as the recess may afford you leisure, and  
I flatter myself you have dispositions to oblige  
me, I will without apology, desire (if the meas-  
ure in itself should strike you as proper, and  
likely to produce public good, or private honor)  
that you would turn your thoughts to a valedicto-  
ry address from me to the public, expressing in  
plain and modest terms, that having been honor  
ed with the presidential chair and to the best of  
my abilities contributed to the organization and  
administration of the government — that having  
arrived at a period of life when the private walks  
of it, in the shade of retirement, becomes neces-  
sary and will be most pleasing to me — and the  
spirit of the government may render a rotation  
in the elective officers of it more congenial with  
their ideas of liberty and safety, that I take my  
leave of them as a public man — and in bidding  
them adieu retaining no other concern than such  
as will arise from fervent wishes for the prosper-  
ity of my country, I take the liberty at my de-  
parture from civil, as I formerly did at my mili-  
tary exit, to invoke a continuation of the bless-  
ings of Providence upon it— and upon all those  
who are the supporters of iu interests, and  
the promoters of harmony, order and good gov-  
ernment.  
  
That to impress these things it might, among  
v\a &#x27;k^&#x27; f* oh&amp;erred, that we are all the  
children of the same country— a country great  
and rich in itaelf-capable and promising to be,  
as prosperous and happy as any the annals of  
history has ever brought to our view. That our  
interest, however diversified in local and smaller  
matters, is the same in nil the great and essential  
concerns of the nation. That the extent of our  
country— the diversity of our climate and soil—  
and the various productions of the State conse  
quent of both, are such as to make one part not  
only convenient, but perhaps indispensably neces  
sary to the other part— and may render the whole  
(at no distant period) one of the most indeoen  
dent in the world. That the established govern  
ment being the work of our own hands, with the  
seeds of amendment engrafted in the Constitution  
by wisdom, good dispositions and mutual  
, aided by experience, bring it as near  
as any hi  
  
in institution ever ap  
proximaiea; and therefore, the only strife among  
us ought to be, who should be foremost in facili-  
tating and finally accomplishing such great and  
desirable objects; by giving every possible sup  
port, and cement to the Union. That however  
ntcceasary it may be to keep a watchful eye over  
our public servants, and public measures, yet  
there ought to be limits to it; for saspicious un-  
founded, and jealousies too lively, are irritating  
to honest feelings, and oftentimes are productive  
of more evil than good.  
  
To enumerate the various subjects which might  
be introduced into such an Address would require  
thought; and to mention them to you would be  
unnecessary, as your own judgment will compre  
bend all that will be proper; whether to touch,  
specifically, any of the exceptionable parts of the  
Constitution may be doubted. All I shall add,  
therefore, at present is, to beg the favor of yon to  
consider— l»t, the propriety of such an address—  
2nd, if approved, the several matters which ought  
to be contained in it— and 3d, the time it should  
apper: that is, whether at the declaration of my  
&#x27; ~&gt; to withdraw from the service of the pub

As there is a possibility, if not &amp; probability, that I  
shall not see you on your &#x27;return home—cr, If 1 should  
see you that it may be on the road,&#x27; and. under clrcutn­  
fet&amp;nefes which will prevent my speaking to you on the  
suibjtjct we last conversed upon—l take tho liberty of  
committing to paper the following thoughts and re­  
quests. ’  
. I havenot been unmindful of the sentiments expressed  
by yon in the conversation just alluded to; on tho con­  
trary,!&#x27; have again and again revolved them, with  
thoughtful anxiety? but without being able to dispose  
my mind to longer continuation in the office I have now  
tho honor to hold. I, therefore, still look forward to  
ths Fulfllmenfc of my fondest ana most ardent Wish to  
spend the remainder of my days {which I do not expect  
to be many) in’oaso and tranquillity.  
NoUilngshort of conviction that my dereliction of the  
chair of government *if It should he the dealt* of th«  
people to keep me in It) would Involve the oocstry in  
serious disputes respecting &#x27;the Chief Magistrate, and  
the dlsagreeableconsequenccs which might resnittnere­  
from la the floating amt divided opinions which seem to  
prevail at present, could, In any wise, induce me to re.  
linqulsh tho determination X havo formed: and of this  
I do not see how any evidence can bo obtained previous  
to the election. My vanity, lam sure, is not of that  
cast as to allow me to view the subject in this light.  
’ Under these impressions, permit me to reiterate tho  
request I mode to you at our last meeting—namely, to  
‘think of the proppr -time,-and the best mode of an*  
tin anting the Intention, and that you would prepare the  
latter. In revolving this subject myself, my judgment  
lias always been embarrassed. On the one hand, a pre­  
vious declaration to not-only carries with It tho  
appearance of Vanity and self-importance, but it may be  
construed into a manoeuvre to be Invited to remain. And  
on the other hand, to say nothiug, Implys consent; or,  
atany rate, would leave the matter In doubt? and to de­  
cline afterwards might be deemed as bad, and untendld.  
■I would fain carry ray request to you farther than Is  
asked above, although lam sensible that your compli­  
ance with it must add to your trouble; but as tho recess  
may afford yon leisure, and I flatter myself yon havo  
dispositions to oblige me, I will, without apology, de­  
sire (if the inehsure initself should strike you as proper,  
and likely to produce nnbliegood or private honor) that  
you would turn your thoughts to a valedictory address  
from me to the public, expressing in plain and modest  
terms, that having been honored with the Presidential  
chair, and to tho best of my abilities contributed to the  
organization and administration of the Government—  
that having arrived at a period of life when the private  
walks of it, in the shado of retirement, becomes neces­  
sary and wUI be most pleasing to me: and the spirit of  
the Government may render a rotation do the elective  
officers of it more congenial with their Ideas of liberty  
and safety; that’ I take my leave of them as a publio  
manj-and. in bidding them adieu (retaining no other  
concern than such as will arise from fervent wishes for  
the prosperity of my country), I take the liberty at my  
departure from civil, as I formerly did at my military  
cut, to invoke a continuation of the blessings of Provi­  
dence upon it, and .upon-ail those who are the sap­  
porters of its interests, and the promoters of harmony,  
order, and good government.  
&lt; That to Impress those things it might, among other  
■ things, he observed, that we are off the children of the  
same country—.» country groat and rich in itself—capa­  
ble, and promising to be as prosperous and happy as any  
the annals of history hos ever brought to our view. That  
que Interest.-however diversified In local and smaller  
matters, is the same in all the great and essential con­  
cerns of the nation. That the extent of our country,  
the diversity of our climate and soil, and the various  
productions&#x27; bf, the &quot;States,&#x27; consequent of both, are  
-such as to make one part not only convenient, but per­  
haps iudispousably necessary to the other part, and may  
render tho whole (at no distant period) one of tho rnoßt  
independent in the world. That the established Gov­  
ernment being the work of our own hands, with the  
seeds of amendment engrafted in the Constitution, may,&#x27;  
by wisdom, good dispositions, and mutual alliances,  
aided by experience, bring it as near to perfection as any ;  
human institution ever approximated; and, therefore,  
the only strife among us ought to be, who should be  
foremost In facilitating and finally accomplishing such  
great and desirable objects, by giving every possible  
support and cement to the Union. That, however ne­  
cessary it may be to keep a watchful eye over our public  
servants and public measures, yet there ought to be  
limits to ft: for suspicions unfounded, and jealousies too  
lively ere irritating to honest feelings, and oftentimes  
are productive of more evil than good.  
To enumerate the various subjects which might be in­  
troduced into such an Address would require thought  
and to mention thorn to you would. be unnecessary, as

to paper the following thoughts and re­  
quests:I have not been unmindful of the senti­

tion just alluded to; on the contrary, I have  
again and again revolved them with  
thoughtful anxiety, but without being able  
to dispose my mind to longer continuation  
in tho office I have now the honor to hold.  
1 therefore still look forward to the fulfill­  
merit of my fondest and most ardent wish

quences which wight resujt therefrom in  
  
the floating and divided opinions which  
seem to prevail at present, could, in any­

ation I have formed ; and of this I do not  
see how any evidence can be obtained pre­  
vious to the election. My vanity, I am  
sure, is not of that cast as to allow me to  
view the suhject in this light.  
Under these impressions then permit me  
to reiterate the request I made to you at  
our last meeting, namely, to think of the  
proper time and the best mode of announ­  
cing the intention, and that you would pre­  
pare the latter. In revolving this subject  
myself, my judgment has always been em­  
barrassed. On the one hand, a previous  
declaration to return not only carries with  
it the appearance of vanity andself-importance,

noeuvre to be invited to remain. And, on  
the other hand, to, say nothing implies con­  
sent; or, at any rate, would leave the mat  
ter in doubt ; and to decline afterwards  
might be deemed as bad and uncandid.  
I would fain carry my request to you  
further than is asked above, although 1 am  
sensible that your compliance with it must  
add to your trouble; but as the recess may  
afford you leisure, and I flatter myself you  
have dispostions to oblige me, I will with­  
out apology, desire (if the measure in itself  
should strike you as proper, and likely to  
produce public good or private honor) that  
you would turn your thoughts to a valedic­  
tory address from roe to the public, expres­  
ing in plain and modest terms that hav­  
ing been honored with the Presidential  
chair, and to the best of my abilities con­  
tributed to the organization and adminis­  
tration of the Government ; that having  
arrived at a period of life when the private  
walks of it, in the shade of retirement, be­  
comes necessary and will be most pleasing  
to me ; and the spirit of the Government  
may render a rotation in the elective offi­  
cers of it mora congenial with their ideas  
of liberty and safety I take my leave of  
them as a public man ; and, in bidding them  
adieu, (retaining no other concern than such  
as will arise from fervent wishes for the  
prosperity of my country,) I take the liber­  
ty at my departure from civil, and formerly  
did at my military exit, to invoke a contin­  
uation of the blessings of Providence upon  
it, and upon all those who are the support­  
ers of its interests, and the promoters of har­  
mony, order and good government.  
That to impres these things it might,  
among other things, be observed that  
we are all the children of the same  
country a country great and rich in it­  
self capable and promising to be as  
prosperous and happy as any the an­  
nals of history has ever brought to our  
view ; that our interest, however diver­  
sified in local and smaller matters, is  
the same in all the great and essential  
concerns of the nation ; that the extent  
of our country, the diversity of our cli­  
mate and soil, and the;various produc­  
tions of the States consequent of both,  
are such as to make one part not only  
convenient, but perhaps indispensably  
necessary to the other part, and may  
render the whole (at no distant period)  
one of the most independent in the  
world ; that the established Government,  
being the work of our own hands, with  
the seeds of amendment engrafted in the  
Constitution, may, by wisdom, good dis­  
positions, and mutual alliances, added  
by experience, bring it as near to perfec­  
tion as any human institution ever ap­  
proximated ; and therefore the only strife  
among us ought to be who should be  
foremost in facilitating and finally ac­  
complishing such great and desirable  
objects, by giving every possible sup­  
port and cement to the Union ; that  
however necessary it may be keep a  
watchful eye over our public servants  
and public measures, yet there ought to  
be limits to it, for suspicions unfounded  
and jealousies too lively, are irri a i ig &#x27;o  
honest feelings, and oftentimes are pro­  
ductive of more evil than good.  
To enumerate the various subjects  
which might be introduced into such an  
address .would require thought ; and to  
mention, them to you would be unneces­  
sary, as your own judgment will com­  
prehend all that will beproper--wheth-er  
to touch, specifically, any of the ex­  
ceptionable parts of the Constitution may

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Mount Vernon, May 20th, 1792.  
My Dear Sir:—As there is a possibility, if  
not a probability that I shall not see you on  
your return home—or, if I should see you that  
it may be on the road and under circumstances  
which will prevent my speaking to you on the  
subject we last conversed upon—I take the  
liberty of committing to paper the following  
thoughts and requests.  
I have not been unmindful of the sentiments  
expressed by you in the conversation just allud­  
ed to:—on the contrary, I have again and again  
revolved them, with thoughtful anxiety, but  
without being able to dispose my mind to  
longer continuation in the office I have now the  
honor to hold. I therefore still look forward  
to the fulfilment of my fondest and most anient  
wish to spend the remainder of my days, (which  
I do not expect to be many) in ease and tran­  
quility.  
  
Nothing short of conviction that my derelic­  
tiou of tlic chair of government (if it should be  
the desire of the people to keep me in it,)  
would involve the country in serious disputes  
respecting the Chief Magistrate, and the disa­  
greeable consequences which might result there­  
from, in the floating and divided opinions which  
seem to prevail at present, could, in any wise,  
induce me to relinquish the determination 1  
have formed; and of this 1 do not see how anv  
evidence can be obtained previous to the elec­  
tion. My vanity, 1 am sure, is not of that cast  
to allow me to view the subject iu this light.  
Under these impressions, then, permit me to  
reiterate the request I made at our last meeting,  
viz: to consider the proper time and the  
best mode of announcing the intention, and  
that you would prepare tlie latter. In revolv­  
ing this subject myself, my judgment has always  
been embarrassed. On the one band, a previ­  
ous declaration to return, hot only carries with  
it the appearance of vanity and self-importance,  
but it may be construed into a manoeuvre to be  
invited to remain. And on the other hand, to  
say nothing, implies consent, or, at any rate,  
would leave the matter in doubt; and to decline  
afterwards, might be deemed as bad, and un­  
candid.  
1 would fain carry my request to you farther  
than is asked above, although 1 aril sensible  
Unit your compliance with it must add to your  
trouble; but as tire recess may afford vou leisure,  
and I flatter mvself you have dispositions to  
oblige me, 1 will, without apology, desire (if  
the measure in itself should strike you as pro­  
per, and likely to produce public good, or pri­  
vate honor) that you would turn your thoughts  
to a valedictory address from me to the public,  
expressing in plain and modest terms, that  
having been honored with the Presidential  
chair, and to the best of my abilities contributed  
to the organization and administration of the  
government—tiiat having arrived at a period  
of life when the private walks of it, in the  
shade of retirement, becomes necessary and  
will be most pleasing to mo—and the spirit of  
the government may render a rotation in the  
elective officers of it more congenial with their  
ideas of liberty, and safety, that I take my  
leave uf them as a public man—and in bidding  
them adieu (retaining no other concern than  
such as will arise from fervent wishes for the  
prosperity of my country.) 1 take the liberty  
at my departure from civil, as 1 formerly &lt; 1 id  
at my military exit, to invoke a continuation of  
the blessings ot Divine Providence upon it—  
and upon all those who are the supporters of  
its interests, and the promoters of harmonv,  
order and good government.  
1 hat to impress these things, it might among  
other things, be observed that we are all the  
children ol the same country—a country great  
and rich in itsell—capable, and promising to  
be as prosperous and happy as any the annals  
of history lias ever brought to our view. 1’liat  
our interest, however diversified in local and  
smaller matters, is the same in all the great es­  
sential concerns of the nation. That the ex­  
tent of our country—the diversity of our climate  
and soil, and the various productions of the  
•states consequent upon both, are such as to  
make one part, not only convenient, but perhaps  
indispensably necessary to the other part—and  
may render the whole, at no distant period, one  
ot the most independent in the world.  
&#x27;1 lint the established government being the  
work of our own hands, with the seeds of  
amendment engratted iu the Constitution mav  
by wisdom, gimd dispositions, and mutual alli­  
ances, and by experience, bring it as near per­  
fection as any human institution ever approxi­  
mated; and therefore, the only strife among us  
ought to lie, wlm should be foremost in facili­  
tating and finally accomplishing such great  
: and desirable objects; by giving every possible  
I support and cement to the Union. That, how­  
ever necessary it may be to keep a watchful  
eye over our public servants and public mea­  
sures, yet there ought to be limits to it; for  
suspicions unfounded, and jealousies toolivelv,  
are irritating to honest feelings, and oftentimes 1  
are productive of more evil than good.  
lo enumerate the various subjects which  
might be introduced into such an address would  
require thought; and to mention them to you  
would be unnecessary, as your own judgment  
will comprehend all that will be proper; wheth­  
er to touch, specifically, any ot the exception­  
able parts of the Constitution may be doubted.  
All 1 shall add, therefore, at present, is to be1*  
the favor of you to consider—1st, the propriety  
of such an address; 2d, if approved, the several  
matters which ought to bo contained in it; and  
3d, the time it should appear; that is, whether  
at the declaration of my intention to withdraw  
from the service of the public, or to let it bo  
the closing act of my administration, which  
will end with the next session of Congress (the  
probability being that tiiat bodv will continue  
sitting until March,) when the’ House of Rep­  
resentatives will also dissolve.  
Though I do not wish to hurry you (the cases  
not pressing,) in the execution of either of the  
publications before mentioned, vet I should lie  
glad to hear from you generally on both—and  
to receive them in time, if you should not  
come to Philadelphia until the session com­  
mences, in the form they are finally to take.  
I beg leave to draw your attention also to such  
other things as you shall conceive to lie fit sub­  
jects for communication on that occasion, and,  
noting them as they occur, that you would be  
so good as to furnish me with them in time to  
1,(1 prepared, and engrafted with others for the  
opening of the session.  
With very sincere and

“Mount Vernon, May 20, 1792.  
  
“My pear Sir:— As there is a possibility, if not a probability,  
that I shall not see you on your return home, or, if I should see you,  
  
that it may be on the road, and under circumstances which will pre-  
vent my speaking to you on the subject we last conversed upon, I take  
the liberty of committing to paper the following thoughts and _re-  
quests.  
  
“T have not been unmindful of the sentiments expressed by you in  
the conversation just alluded to; on the contrary, I have again and  
again revolved them with a thoughtful anxiety, but without being able  
to dispose my mind to longer continuation in the office I have now the  
honor to hold. I therefore still look forward to the fulfilment of my  
fondest and most ardent wish, to spend the remainder of my days (which  
I do not expect to be many) in case and tranquillity.  
  
“Nothing short of conviction that my dereliction of the chair of  
government (if it should be the desire of the people to keep me in ii)  
would involve the country in serious disputes respecting the chief mag-  
istrate, and the disagreeable consequences that might result therefrom  
in the floating and divided opinions which seem to prevail at present,  
could in any wise induce me to relinquish the determination I have  
formed; and of this I do not see how any evidence can be obtained  
previous to the election. My vanity, I am sure, is not of that east as  
to allow me to view the subject in this light.  
  
“Under these impressions, then, permit me to reiterate the request I  
made to you at our last meeting, namely, to think of the proper time  
and the best mode of announcing the intention, and that you will pre-  
pare the latter. In revolving this subject myself, my judgment has  
always been embarrassed. On the one hand, a previous declaration to  
return not only carries with it the appearance of vanity and self-im-  
portance, but it may be construed into a manceuvre to be invited to re-  
main. And, on the other hand, to say nothing implies consent, or, at  
any rate, would leave the matter in doubt; and to decline afterwards  
might be deemed as bad, and uncandid.  
  
“T would fain carry my request to you farther than is asked above,  
although I am sensible that your compliance with it must add to your  
  
trouble ; but as the recess may afford you leisure, and I flatter myself  
you have dispositions to oblige me, I will, without apology, desire (if  
the measure in itself should strike you as proper, and likely to produce  
public good, or private honor) that you would turn your thoughts toa  
valedictory address from me to the public, expressing in plain and  
modest terms, that, having been honored with the Presidential chair,  
  
and to the best of my abilities contributed to the organization and ad-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
400 ALEXANDER HAMILTON. [ April,  
  
ministration of the government, — that having arrived at a period of  
life when the private walks of it, in the shade of retirement, become  
necessary and will be most pleasing to me,—and the spirit of the  
government may render a rotation in the elective officers of it more  
congenial with their ideas of liberty and safety, that I may take my  
leave of them as a publie man; and in bidding them adieu, (retaining  
no other concern than such as will arise from fervent wishes for the  
prosperity of my country,) I take the liberty at my departure from  
civil, as I formerly did at my military exit, to invoke a continuation of  
the blessings of Providence upon it, and upon all those who are the  
supporters of its interests, and the promoters of harmony, order, and  
good government.  
  
“That to impress these things it might, among other things, be ob-  
served, that we are all the children of the same country, —a country  
great and rich in itself, — capable, and promising to be, as prosperous  
and happy as any which the annals of history have ever brought to our  
view. ‘That our interest, however diversified in local and smaller mat-  
ters, is the same in all the great and essential concerns of the nation.  
That the extent of our country, the diversity of our climate and soil,  
and the various productions of the States consequent on both, are such  
as to make one part not only convenient, but perhaps indispensably  
necessary, to the other part, — and may render the whole (at no dis-  
tant period) one of the most independent in the world. That the es-  
tablished government being the work of our own hands, with the seeds  
of amendment engrafted in the Constitution, may by wisdom, good dis-  
positions, and mutual alliances, aided by experience, bring it as near to  
perfection as any human institution ever approximated; and therefore  
the only strife among us ought to be, who should be foremost in facili-  
tating and finally accomplishing such great and desirable objects, by  
giving every possible support and cement to the Union. ‘That how-  
ever necessary it may be to keep a watchful eye over our public ser-  
vants, and public measures, yet there ought to be limits to it; for suspi-  
cions unfounded, and jealousies too lively, are irritating to honest feel-  
ings, and oftentimes are productive of more evil than good.  
  
“To enumerate the various subjects which might be introduced in  
such an address would require thought; and to mention them to you  
would be unnecessary, as your own judgment will comprehend a/? that  
will be proper. Whether to touch, specifically, any of the exceptional  
parts of the Constitution may be doubted. All I shall add therefore at  
present is, to beg the favor of you to consider, first, the propriety of  
such an address ; secondly, if approved, the several matters which ought  
  
to be contained in it; and, thirdly, the time it should appear; that is,

Mt. Vihxoii. May , 1792.  
Mr De at Sir : Aa there is a possibility.  
if not a probability, that I shall not see  
you on your return borne or if I should  
see you that it may be on the road, and  
under circumstances which will prevent  
my speaking to you en the subject we last  
conversed upon, I take the liberty of  
committing to paper the following  
thoughts and requests:  
I have not been unmindful of the sen­  
timents expressed by you in the conver  
sations just alluded to; on the contrary,  
1 have again and again revolved thorn  
with thoughtful anxiety, but without being  
able to dispose my mind to a longer con­  
tinuation in the oflice I have had the  
honor to hold. I therefore still look for­  
ward to the fulfillmeut of my fondest and  
most ardent wishes, to spend the remain­  
der of my days (which I cannot expect  
will b many) in ease and tranquility.  
Nothing short of coiviction that my  
dereliction of the chair of government (if  
it should be the desire of the people (o  
continue me in it) would involve the  
country in serious disputes respecting  
the Chief Magistrate, and the disagree­  
able consequences which might result  
therefrom in the floating and divided  
opinions which am to prevail at pres­  
ent, could, in any wise, induce me to  
relinquish the determination I have  
formed ; and of this I do not see how any  
evidence can be obtained previous to. the  
election. My vanity, I am sure, is not of  
tnat oast as to aiow me to view me suo-  
ject in this light  
Under these tmressions, then, permit  
me to reiterate the request! made to you  
at our last meeting, namely, to think of  
the proper time and the best mode ef  
announcing tbe intention, and mat you  
would prepare the latter. In revolving  
this subject myself, my judgment has  
always been embarrassed, On the other  
hand, a previous declaration to retire,  
not only carries with it the appearance  
of vanity and self-importance, but it  
may be construed into a maneuver to be  
invited to remain. And on the other  
bead, to sy nothing implies consent,  
or at any rate, would leave tbe matter in  
doubt; and to decline afterwards might  
be deemed as bad and nncandid.  
I would fain carry my request to you  
further thaa is askad ftbove, Although I  
am sensible that your compliance with it  
must add to your trouble; but as tht  
recess may afford y eu leisure, and I flatter  
myself you have a disposition to oblige  
me, I will, without apology, desire (if  
the measure in itself should strike you  
as proper, and likely to produce publio  
ood or private honor), that you would  
turn your thoughts to a valedictory

sing in plain and modest terms, that,  
having been honored with the

ganization and administration of the  
Government that, having arrived at a  
period of life when the private walks of  
it in tbe shad of retirement, becomes  
necessary and will be most pleasing to  
me ; and the spirit of the Gavernmant  
may render a rotation in the election of  
officers of it more congeniel with their  
ideas of liberty and safety, that I take  
my leave of them as a public man) and  
in bidding them adien (retaining no oth­  
er concern than such as will arise from  
former wishes for the pros perity of my  
country), I take the liberty at my de­  
parture from civil, as I formerly did at  
my military exit, to invoke a continua­  
tion of the blessings of providence upon  
it, and upon all those who are supporters  
of its interests, and the promoters of  
harmony, order and good government.  
That to impress these things it might,  
among other things, be observed, that  
we are all the children of the same  
country a country great and rich in  
itself, capable, and promising to be, as  
prosperous and happy as any the annals  
of history have ever brought to cur view.  
That our interests, however diversified  
in local and smaller matters, is the same  
in all great essential concerns of the  
nation. That the extent of onr coun­  
try, the diversity of our climate and  
soil, and the various produotlobs of  
the States consequent of both, are  
such as to make one part not only  
convenient, bnt, perhaps, indispensably  
necessary to the other part, and may  
render the whole (at no distant period)  
one of the most independent in the world.  
That the established government tseing  
tbe work of our own hands, with the  
seeds of amendment engrafted in the  
Constitution, may be wisdom, good dis­  
position and mutual utterances, aided by  
experience, bring it as near te perfec­  
tion a human institution ever ap­  
proximated; and, therefore, the only  
strife among es cnght to be who should  
be fr-emoa in facilitating and finally ao­  
cnmjilisliiog suth great and desirable  
  
objects by giving every possible support

measures, yet tnere ougm to oe mints to  
it, for suspicions uniounuea, ana jeal­  
ousies too lively, are irritating to honest

Mr. VERNON, May. 20, 1792.   
MX. DEAR SIR: As there rs a possibil­  
ity, ilsnot probability. that I shall not see   
you on your return home; or, if I should   
see you, that it. may be on the road and   
under circumstances which m ill prevent   
my speaking to you on the subjective last   
conversed upon, I take the liberty of com­  
mitting to paper the following. thoughts   
and requests.   
. .   
  
I have not been unmindful of the sen­  
timent expressed by you in, the conversa­  
tion just alluded to. On the contrary. I   
have again and again resolved them nith   
thoughtful anxiety; but, without berrig   
able to dispose my mind &#x27;to a longer con­  
tinuation in the office I have now- the   
honor to hold. I therefore still looked fur,   
ward to the fulfillment of my fondest and   
most ardent-wishes to spend-the remain-_   
der of my days (which I cannot expect to   
be many) in ease and tranquility.   
I,;othing short of conviction that •my   
dereliction of the Chair of Government   
(it• it should be the desire of the people   
to continue me in it) would involve the   
country in set ions diepntes respecting the   
Chief Magistrate, and the disagreeable   
consequences which might result there­  
from in the floating and divided opinions   
which seem to prevail at present, could,   
in any wise, induced me to relinquish the   
determination I have formed, and of this   
I do not see how-ally evidence can be ob­  
tained previous to the election. !&#x27;lly Van­  
ity. I am sure, is not of that cast as to al­  
low ins to view the subject in this light.   
Under these impression then, permit   
me to reiterate the request I made to you   
at our last meeting, namely ; to think of   
the proper time, and the best mode of an­  
nouncing the intention, and that you   
would prepare the letter. In revolving   
this subject myself, my judgment has al­  
ways been embarrassed. On the one hand   
a previous declaration to retire, not only   
outcries with it the appearance of vanity   
and self-importance, but it may be •con­  
. strued into a manceuvre to be invited to   
remain, and on the other hand, to say.   
nothing, implvs consent, or, at any rate   
would leave the matter in doubt, and to   
decline afterwards might be, deemed as   
bad and uncandid.   
  
I would fain carry my request farther   
than is asked above, although I am sensi­  
ble that your compliance with it must   
add to your trouble; but as the. recess   
may afford you leisure, and I flatter my­  
self yin have a disposition to oblige me,l   
will without apology desire (if the mews-   
urn in itself should strike you us proper,   
and likely to produce public. good, or pri­  
vate honor.) that you would turn your   
thoughts to a valadietory address from   
ins to the public, expressing, in &#x27;plain and   
modest terms—lhat having beet, honored   
with the Presidential chair, and to the   
best of my abilities contributed to the-or­  
ganization and administration of the   
government—that having arrived at   
period of life, when the private walks of   
it, in the shade of retirement, become   
necessary and will be most pleasing to   
me ; and the spirit- of the government   
may render a rotation in the elective offi­  
cers of it, more congenial with their ideas   
of liberty and safety, that I take my leave   
of them as a public man ; and in bidding   
them adieu (retaining no other concern   
than such as will arise from fervent wish­  
es for the prosperity of my country) I   
take the liberty, at my departure from   
civil, as I formerly did at my military ex­  
it, to invoke a confirmation of the bles­  
sings of Providence upon it, and upon all   
those who are the supporters of its inter­  
ests, and the promoters of harmony, or 7   
der and good government.   
That to impress these things it might,   
among other things, be observed that we   
are ad the children of the same country   
—a country great and rich in itself-cap­  
able, and promising to bo as prosperous   
and as happy as any the annals,of histo­  
ry here ever brought to our view. That   
our interest, however diversiaellin local   
and smaller matters, is the same in•tillLthe   
great and essential concerns of.. the -na­  
tion. That. the extent of our corintey.   
the diversity of our climate and soil, .and   
the various productions of the Stites,   
consequent upon both, are suet] as to   
make one part not only convenient,- &#x27;but   
perhaps indispenlably necessary ;to the   
other part, and may render the whole&#x27; (at   
no distant period) one of the mast inde­  
pendent in the world. That the estab­  
lished government-being the work of our   
own bands., with the seeds of amendment   
engrafted in the constitution. may; by   
wisdom, good dispositions and miitiud   
lowatices, aided by-experience, bring it as   
near to perfection as any linman ipstitu­  
titan; ever aprox ma ted ; and- t herefore,the

The framers of this government entertained no such ideas.  
They made the executive elective, to satisfy the democratic  
principle, and they provided for frequent elections of congress-  
men for the same reason. But it is clear from everything  
which all of them said about change, or rotation, in offices, that  
they had in mind only those which they had thus made elective,  
and the few others which stood in a confidential relation to the  
executive. Washington said :
