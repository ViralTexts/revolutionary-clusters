This is a deception equal to any that has hitherto been entertained. It is indeed a fact, that high taxes are the ostensible cause of the commotions, but that they are the real cause is as far remote from truth as light from darkness. The people who are the insurgents have never paid any, or but very little taxes—But they see the weakness of government; They feel at once their own poverty, compared with the opulent, and their own force, and they are determined to make use of the latter, in order to remedy the former. Their creed is “That the property of the United States has been protected from the confiscations of Britain by the joint exertions of all, and therefore ought to be the common property of all. And he that attempts opposition to this creed is an enemy to equity and justice, and ought to be swept from off the face of the earth.” In a word they are determined to annihilate all debts public and private and have agrarian Laws which are easily effected by the means of unfunded paper money which shall be a tender in all cases whatever.  
The numbers of these people may amount in massachusetts to about one fifth part of several populous counties, and to them may be collected, people of similar sentiments, from the States of Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire so as to constitute a body of 12 o

mpell them to embody for their own safety—once embodied they will be constrained to submit to discipline for the same reason. Having proceeded to this length for which they are now ripe, we shall have a formidable rebellion against reason, the principles of all government, and the very name of liberty. This dreadful situation has alarmed every man of principle and property in New England—They start as from a dream, and ask what has been the Cause of our delusion? What is to afford us security against the violence of lawless men? Our government  
  
must be braced, changed, or altered to secure our lives and property. We imagined that the mildness of our government and the virtue of the people were so correspondent, that we were not as other nations requiring brutal force to support the laws—But we find that we are men, actual men, possessing all the turbulent passions belonging to that animal and that we must have a government proper and adequate to him—The people of Massachusetts for instance, are far advanced in this doctrine, and the men of reflection, &amp; principle, are determined to endevor to establish a government which shall have the power to protect them in their lawful pursuits, and which will be efficient in all cases of internal commotions or foreign invasions—They mean that liberty shall be the basis, a liberty resulting from the equal and firm administration of the laws. They wish for a general government of unity as they see the local legislatures, must naturally and necessarily tend to retard and frustrate all general government.  
We have arrived at that point of time in which we are forced to see our national humiliation, and that a progression in this line, cannot be productive of happiness either public or private—something is wanting and something must be done or we shall be involved in all the horror of faction and civil war without a prospect of its termination—Every tried friend t

** And, in the course of ideas, the same movement, even more rapid, hurried along  
the minds of men and the progress of opinion, far in advance of events. In the  
midst of the most civilized and wisest States, the most radical theories obtained not  
only favor but strength. ‘The properiy of the United States has been protect-  
ed from the confiscation of Britain by the joint exertion of all, and therefore ought  
to be the common property of all; and he that attempts opposition to this creed is  
an enemy to equity and justice, and ought to be swept from the face of the earth.

were received in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, by a conside-  
rable portion of the people ; twelve or fifteen thousand men took up arms in order  
to reduce them to practice. And the evil appeared so serious, that Madison, the  
most intimate friend of Jefferson, a man whom the democratic party subsequently  
ranked among its leaders, regarded American society as almost lost, and hardl

for present instruction that it was a  
rebellion gotten up by the debtor class with a  
view to abolish debts by a forced circulation  
of irredeemable currency. The old Congress  
was in session at the time, and it instructed  
  
General Knox, the Secretary of War, to repair  
immediately to Springfield, ostensibly to pro-­  
tect the federal magazine at that place, but  
really to observe and report upon the rebel­  
lion. After his return he wrote, in a letter to
