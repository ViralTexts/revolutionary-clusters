“Having as yet received and read only the first volume of the History, I cannot form, and consequently cannot express, an opinion of the whole work.—As to the first volume, there are in it certain assertions, representations, and suggestions, of which there are some which I believe to be erroneous, and others which I suspect to be inaccurate. Being too feeble to write or to read much at a time without fatigue, I forbear to enumerate them.—I will nevertheless for your satisfaction, select and notice one of the most important—Viz.—That anterior to the Revolution, there existed in the colonies a desire of Independence.  
The following extracts respect this Topic.  
  
  
Page   
10.   
  
‘The love of the Sovereign and their ancient country, which the first colonists might have retained in their new establishments, gradually diminished in the hearts of their Descendants.’  
  
  
  
  
11.  
‘The greater part of the colonists had heard nothing of Great Britain, excepting that it was a distant kingdom, from which their ancestors had been barbarously expelled.’  
  
  
  
12  
  
‘As the means of constraint became almost illusory in the hands of the Government, there must have arisen in the minds of the Americans the Hope and with it the Desire to shake off the yoke of British Superiority.’  
‘The colonists supported impatiently the superiority of the British Government.’  
  
  
  
  
15.  
‘Such was the State of the English colonies in America, such the Opinions and dispositions of those who inhabited them, about the middle of the eighteenth century. … It was impossible that they should have remained ignorant of what they were capable; and that the progressive development of national Pride should not have rendered the British yoke intolerable.’  
  
  
  
33.  
‘Already those who were the most zealous for Liberty, or the most ambitious, had formed in the secret of their hearts, the resolution to shake off the yoke of England whenever a favorable occasion should present.—This Design was encouraged by the recent cession of Canada.’  
  
  
  
199.  
‘The colonists looked upon (the Congress of 1774.) as a Convention of men who in some mode or other, were to deliver their country  
from the perils that menaced it. The greater part believed that their ability &amp;c. … would enable them to obtain from the government a removal of the evils that oppressed them, and the reestablishment of the ancient order of things.—some others cherished the belief, that they would find means to conduct the American nation to that Independence, which was the first and most ardent of their aspirations—or rather, the sole object of that intense passion, which stung and  
tormented them, night and Day.’  
  
  
  
  
  
  
314.  
‘Both (Putnam and Ward) had declared themselves too openly in favor of Independence. The  
Congress desired indeed to procure it, but withal in a propitious time.’  
  
  
  
388.  
‘Thus ceased, as we have related, the royal authority in the different provinces. It was replaced progressively by that of the People:—that is, by Congresses, or Conventions-extraordinary, that were formed in each Colony.—But this was not deemed sufficient by those, who directed the affairs of America. Their real object being Independence.’  
  
  
Explicit Professions and assurances of allegiance and Loyalty to the Sovereign (especially since the accession of king William) and of affection for the mother country, abound, continues mr Jay, in the Journals of the colonial Legislatures, and of the Congresses and Conventions, from early Periods to the second petition of Congress, in 1775.  
If those professions and assurances were sincere, they afford evidence

s and assurances were factitious and deceptive, they present to the world an unprecedented instance of long-continued, concurrent, and detestable Duplicity in the Colonies.—Our country does not deserve this odious and disgusting imputation. During the course of my life, and until after the second petition of Congress, (in 1775.) I never did hear any American, of any Class, or of any description, express a wish for the Independence of the colonies.  
Few Americans had more or better means and opportunities of becoming acquainted with the sentiments and Disposition of the colonists relative to public affairs than the late Doctr Franklin.  
In a letter to his Son, dated the 22 March 1775. he relates a conversation which he had with Lord Chatham, in the preceding month of August.   His Lordship having mentioned an opinion prevailing in England, that America aimed at setting up for itself as an independent state, the Doctor thus expressed himself. ‘I assured him, that having more than once travelled almost from one End of the continent to the other, and kept a great variety of company, eating, drinking and conversing with them freely, I never had heard, in any conversation, from any Person, drunk or sober, the least expression of a wish for a separation; or a hint that such a thing would be advantageous to America.’   It does not appear to me necessary to enlarge further on this subject.—It has always been, and still is, my opinion and belief, that our Country was prompted and impelled to independence by Necessity and not by Choice. They who know how we were then circumstanced, know from whence that necessity resulted.—It would be indeed extraordinary, if a Foreigner, remote like mr Botta, from the best sources of authentic information, shd in writing such a History, commit no mistakes. That gentleman doubtless believed his narrations to be true. But it is not improbable that he sometimes selected his materials with too little apprehension of error; and that some of his Informers were too little scrupulous. This remark derives a degree of weight from the following passage in the History—viz. ‘General Montgomery left a wife, the object of all his tenderness, with several children, still infants, a Spectacle for their country at once of pity and admiration. The State, from gratitude towards the father, distinguished them with every mark of kindness and protection.’ I have been acquainted with general Montgomery’s widow from my youth—the fact is, that she never had a child.  
In making the Translation attention has doubtless been paid to the Rule that a Translator should convey into his translation with perspicuity and precision the ideas of his author and no others; and express them,  not literally, but in well adapted classical language. How far your Translation is exactly correct I am an incompetent Judge; for, not understanding the language of the original, I cannot examine and compare the Translation with it.  
Of the style and manner of the Translation I think well.”  
Having the intention, in case other Editi

“Few Americans had more, or better means and opportunities of becoming  
acquainted with the sentiments and dispositions of the colonists, relative to  
public affairs, than Dr. Franklin. In a letter to his son, dated the 22d March,  
1775, he relates a conversation which he had with Lord Chatham in the pre-  
ceding month of August. His lordship having mentioned an opinion prevail-  
ing in England, that America aimed at setting up for herself as an independ-  
ent state, the doctor thus expressed himself: ‘I assured him, that having  
more than once travelled almost from one end of the continent to the other,  
and kept a great variety of company, eating, drinking, and conversing with  
them freely, I never had heard in any conversation from any person, drunk  
or sober, the least expression of a wish for separation, or a hint that such a  
thing would be advantageous to America.’  
  
‘“‘ It does not appear to me necessary to enlarge further on this subject. It  
has always been and still is my opinion and belief, that our country was  
prompted and impelled to independence by necessity, and not by choice. They  
who know how we were then circumstanced, know from whence that ne-

men, who, in some mode or other, were to delirei their  
country from the perils that menaced it. The greater  
part believed that their ability, their prudence and

them to obtain from the Government the removal of the  
evils that oppressed them, and to obtain the re-estab­

neous, and others which I suspect to be inaccurate. Being too feeble either  
to write or to read much at a Time without Fatigue; I forbear to enume-  
rate them. I will nevertheless, for your satisfaction, select and notice one  
of the most important—viz&#x27;.  
  
That anterior to the Revolution, there existed in the Colonies a Desire of  
Independence.  
  
The following extracts respect this Topic :—  
  
Page 10. “The Love of the Sovereign and their ancient country, which  
the first colonists might have retained in their new Establishments, gradually  
diminished in the Hearts of their Descendants.”  
  
P.11. “The greater part of the Colonists had heard nothing of Great  
Britain, excepting that it was a distant Kingdom, from which their ances-  
tors had been barbarously expelled.”  
  
P.12. “As the means of Constraint became almost illusory in the  
Hands of the Government, there must have arisen and gradually increased  
in the minds of the Americans, the Hope and with it the Desire to shake  
off the Yoke of English superiority.” “The Colonists supported impa-  
tiently the superiority of the British Government.”  
  
P. 15. “Such was the State of the English colonies in America,  
such the opinions and Dispositions of those who inhabited them, about the  
middle of the Eighteenth century.” “It was impossible that they should  
have remained ignorant of what they were capable ; and that the progres-  
cive Developement of national Pride should not have rendered the British  
Yoke intolerable.”  
  
P. 33. “ Already those who were the most zealous for Liberty, or the  
most ambitious, had formed in the secret of their hearts the Resolution to  
shake off the Yoke of England whenever a favorable occasion should pre-  
sent. This Design was encouraged by the recent cession of Canada.”  
  
P. 199. “The Colonists looked upon (the Congress of 1774) as a con-  
vention of men who in some mode or other, were to deliver their country:  
from the Perils that menaced it. The greater part believed that their-  
ability &amp;* would enable them to obtain from the Government, a Removal  
of the Evils that oppressed them, and the Re-establishment of the aneient  
order of Things. Some others cherished the Belief, that they would find  
means to conduct the American nation to that Independence, which was the  
Jirst and most ardent of their aspirations or rather the sole Object of that  
intense passion, which stung and tormented them, night and Day.”  
  
P. 314.“ Both (Putnam and Ward) had declared themselves too openly  
in favor of Independence. The congress desired indeed to proeure it, but  
Withall in a propitious Time.”  
  
P. 388. Thus ceased, as we have related, the Royal Authority in the-  
different Provinces. It was replaced progressively by that of the People;  
that is by congresses or conventions extraordinary, that were formed in  
each Colony. But this was deemed insufficient by those, who dérected the-  
affairs of America—their real Object being Independence.”

I never did hear any American, of any class, or of any Description, express  
a wish for the Independence of the colonies.  
  
Few Americans had more or better means and Opportunities of becoming  
acquainted with the Sentiments and Disposition of the colonists relative to  
public affairs than the late Doct’ Franklin. In a letter to his son, dated the  
22 March, 1775, he relates a conversation which he had with Lord Chat-  
ham in the preceding month of August. His Lordship having mentioned  
an opinion prevailing in England, that America aimed at setting up for it-  
self as an independent State, the Doct’ thus expressed himself.  
  
“T assured him, that having more than once travelled almost from one  
End of the continent to the other, and kept a great variety of company, eat-  
ing, drinking and conversing with them freely, I never had heard, in any  
Conversation, from any Person, drunk or sober, the least Expression of a  
wish for a Separation ; or a Hint that such a Thing would be advantageous  
to America.”  
  
It does not appear to me necessary to enlarge further on this subject. It  
has always been, and still is, my Opinion and Belief, that our country was  
prompted and impelled to Independence by necessity and not by choice.  
They who know how we were then circumstanced, know from whence that  
necessity resulted.  
  
It would indeed be extraordinary if a Foreigner, remote (like M* Botta)  
from the best Sources of authentic Information, should in writing such a  
History, commit no mistakes. That Gentleman doubtless believed his nar-  
rations to be true. But it is not improbable that he sometimes selected his  
materials with too little apprehension of Error; and that some of his In-  
formers were too little scrupulous. This Remark derives a degree of  
Weight from the following Passage in the History, viz* :  
  
General Montgomery “left a Wife, the Object of all his Tenderness,  
with several children, still Infants—a spectacle for their country, at once of  
Pity and Admiration. The State, from Gratitude towards their Father,  
distinguish’ them with every mark of Kindness and Protection.”  
  
Ihave been acquainted with General Montgomery’s Widow from my  
Youth. The fact is, she never had a child.  
  
In making the Translation, attention has doubtless been paid to the Rule  
that a Translator should convey into his Translation with Perspicuity and  
Precision, the Ideas of his Author, and no others; and express them, not  
literally, but in well adapted classical Language. How far your Trans-  
lation is exactly correct, I am an incompetent Judge ; for, not understand-
