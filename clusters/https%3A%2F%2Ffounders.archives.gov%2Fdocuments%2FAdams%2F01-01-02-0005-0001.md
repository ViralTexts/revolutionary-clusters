 wealthy People who will accept the Trust, and so few of each should be erected, that the Profits may enable them to make the best Provision, at a moderate Price. But at the present Day, such Houses are become the eternal Haunt, of loose disorderly People of the same Town, which renders them offensive and unfit for the Entertainment of a Traveller of the least delicacy; and, it seems that Poverty, and distressed Circum­stances are become the strongest Argument, to procure an Approbation, and for this these assigned Reasons, such Multitudes have been lately licensed, that none can afford to make Provision, for any but the trifling, nasty vicious Crew, that most frequent them. The Consequences of these Abuses are obvious. Young People are tempted to waste their Time and Money, and to acquire habits of Intemperance and Idleness that we often see reduce many of them to Beggary, and Vice, and lead some of them at last to Prisons and the Gallows. The Reputation of our County is ruined among Strangers who are apt to infer the Character of a Place from that of the Taverns and the People they see there. But the worst Effect of all, and which ought to make every Man who has the least sense of his Priviledges tremble, these Houses are become in many Places the Nurseries of our Legislators;— An Artful Man, who has neither sense nor sentiment may by gaining a little sway among the Rabble of a Town, multiply Taverns and Dram Shops and thereby secure the Votes of Taverner and Retailer and of all, and the Multiplication of Taverns will make many who may be induced by Phlip and Rum to Vote for any Man whatever.  
I dare not presume to point out any Method, to suppress or Restrain these increasing Evils; but I think for these Reasons it would be well worth the Attention of our Legislature, to confine the Number of, and retrieve the Character of Licensed Houses; least, that Impiety, and Prophaneness, that abandoned Intemperance, and Prodigality; that Impudence and brawling Temper, which these abominable Nurseries daily propagate, should arise at length to a degree of strength, that even the Legislature will not be able to controul.

were the cause of that prostitution ? The greatest num-  
ber of the travelers which have been accommodated, by  
our modern taverns, have been people of the same  
town, many of them trafeling forty rods; others, one,  
two or three miles perhaps, and traveling many times  
They have been the perpetual haunts of  
loose, disorderly people, of the same town, rendering  
them very offensive, and utterly unfit for the enter-  
tainment of strangers of the least delicacy. The occa-  
sional presence of the village squire, and perhaps, some-  
times, in the last century, of the parson also, gave a  
seeming air of respectability to the place. In these  
places young men were tempted to waste their time,  
inoney and health, and acquired habits of intemper-  
ance and idleness. Many were reduced to beggary  
and vice, to prisons and the gallows. The taverns of  
ollen times also became the nurseries of legislators.  
An artful man, with little moral sense or principle, by  
lending his influence in favor of taverns and tippling  
houses, would obtain the favor of the taverner and the  
Other sellers of drams, and, through them, he would se-  
cure any political office that he might desire. For sev-
