eaty fully justified in the conviction, that when  
they established the point of beginning of the boun-  
daries between the United States and Great Bri-  
tain, at “the northwest angle of Nova Scotia,” they  
were fixing it at a point long known and well es-  
tablished? To render assurance doubly certain,  
however, they describe where it is, in the very lan-  
guage which had been uniformly used by the “ Bri-  
tish government in proclamations, in acts of parlia-  
ment, and in numerous commissions to the gover-  
nors of Quebec and Nova Scotia,” says the treaty,  
«is that angle which is formed by a line drawn due  
north from the source of St. Croix river to the high-  
lands.” To what highlands?—The treaty answers,  
‘the highlands which divide those rivers that empty  
themselves into the river St. Lawrence, from those  
which fall into the Atlantic ocean.” The north-  
west angle of Nova Scotia, then, is to be found in  
these highlands, at the point where the dividing  
due north line between New England and Nova  
Scotia, which commences at the source of the St.  
Croix, meets the southern boundary of the province  
of Quebec. The act of parliament of 1774, was  
doubtless before the commissioners. They use its

treaty is, that “the Atlantic ocean” is substituted  
for “the sea.”” Both are evidently intended to con-  
vey the same meaning. The solicitude of the com-  
missioners. to preserve this highland boundary  
throughout between the two notions is mauifest.—  
Under the act of parliament, the southern extremity  
of this line is described to be *‘a point in forty-five  
degrees of northern latitude, on the eastern bank of  
the river Connecticut.” In the treaty it is “the  
northwesternmust head of Connecticut river.”—  
From thence the treaty line runs “down along the  
middle of that river, to the forty-fifth degree of north  
latitude.”  
  
Thus the British government surrendered that  
small portion of the province of Quebec between  
the northwesternmost head of Connecticut river  
and the forty-fifth degree of north latitude, in order  
to have a continuous highland boundary from the
