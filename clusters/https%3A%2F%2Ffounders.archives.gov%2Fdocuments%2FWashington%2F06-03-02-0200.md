first Observe and dry the teeth. then take a peice of Wax and Cut it into As small peices as you think will fill up the hole. then take a large nail or any other peice of Iron and heat it hot into the fier. then put your peice of wax into the hole and melt it by meanes of introduceing the Point of the Nail to it.

New York December 28, 1798  
  
Sir  
  
I send you enclosed two setts of teeth, one fixed on the old barrs in part, and  
the sett you sent me from Philadelphia which when I received was very black, occa-  
sioned either by your soaking them in port wine, or by your drinking it. Port  
wine being sower, takes off all the polish and all Acid has a tendency to soften  
every kind of teeth and bone. Acid is used in coloring every kind of Ivory,  
therefore it is very pernicious to the teeth. I advise you to either take them out  
after dinner and put them in clean water and put in another sett, or clean them  
with a brush and some chalk scraped fine. It will absorbe the acids which  
collect from the mouth and preserve them longer—I have found another and  
better way of using the sealing wax when holes is eaten in the teeth by acids &amp;c.—  
First observe and dry the teeth, then take a piece of Wax and cut it into small  
pieces as you think will fill up the hole; then take a large nail or any other piece  
  
  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS 295  
  
of iron and heat it hot into the fire, then put your piece of wax into the hole and  
melt it by means of introducing the point of the nail to it. I have tried it and found  
it to consolidate, and do better than the other way and if done proper it will resist  
the saliva. It will be handier for you to take hold of the nail with small plyers than  
with a tongs thus, the wax must be very small not bigger than this. ... If your  
teeth grows black take some chalk and a pine or cedar stick, it will rub it off.  
If you want your teeth more yellow soak them in Broth or pot liquor, but not in  
tea or acids. Porter is a good thing to color them and will not hurt but preserve  
them, but it must not be in the least pricked—You will find I have altered the  
upper teeth you sent me from Philadelphia. Leaving the enamel on the teeth dont  
preserve them any longer than if it was off, it only holds the color better, but to  
preserve them they must be very often changed and cleaned, for whatever attacks  
them must be repelled as often, or it will gain ground and destroy the works. the  
two setts I repaired is done on a different plan than when they are done when made  
entirely new, for the teeth are screwed on the barrs, instead of having the barrs cast  
red hot on them, which is the reason I believe they destroy or dissolve so soon  
near to the barrs.  
  
Sir,  
After hoping you will not be obliged to be troubled very soon  
in the same way,  
I subscribe myself  
Your very humble  
Servant,  
John Greenwood  
Sir,  
the additional charge is fifteen dollars.  
  
P. S. I expect next spring to move my family into Connecticut State. If I do  
I will write and let you know, and whether I give up my present business or not, I  
will as long as I live do anything in this way for you if you require it.

which he sent him from Philadelphia  
was very block, and that it must have  
been discolored by his soaking them  
in port wine or by his drinking too  
much port wine. He warns Washing­  
ten that all -.vines containing Odd arc  
bad for the teeth, and advises him to  
take out his teeth after dinner and  
put them in clean water, and should  
any holes bc eaten in them by the  
acid to hil them with wax and seal  
them tight with a piece of red-hot  
iron, such as a nail. He closes his  
letter as follows:  
&quot;If your teeth grow black, take  
some chalk and a pine or cedar stick;  
it will rub ott. If you want your  
teeth more yellow, soak them in broth  
or pot liquor, hut not in tea or acids.  
To preserve teeth they must he very  
often changed and cleaned, for what­  
ever attacks them must be repelled as  
often, or it will gain ground and de­  
stroy the works. The two sots 1 re­  
paired is done on a different plan than  
when entirely new, for the teeth aro  
screwed on the barrs instead of having  
the barrs cast red-hot on them, which  
is thc reason, 1 believe, they dissolve  
so soon near the barrs.&quot;&#x27;
