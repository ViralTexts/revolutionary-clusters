 to me, but I find as years and infirmities increase my courage and enterprize diminish. “ossian says Age is dark and unlovely” when I look in my glass, I do not much wonder at the story related of a very celebrated painter Zerweis who it is said died of laughing at a comical picture he had made of an old woman. if our glass flatters as in youth, it tells us Truths in Age.

Since “Time was given for use, not waste.” The finer accomplishments such as musick, dancing and painting, Serve to sit off and embellish the picture; but the ground work must be formed of more durable coulours,  
I consider it as an indispensable requisite; that every American wife, should herself know, how to order, and regulate her family, how to Govern her domesticks, and train up her Children. for this purpose, the all wise creator made woman an help meet for Man and she who fails in these Duties; does not answer the end of her creation.  
“Life’s cares are comforts; such by Heaven design’d  
they that have none, must make them, or be wretched  
cares are employments; and without employ,  
The soul is on a rack, The rack of rest;”  
I have frequently said to my friends when they have thought me overburdend with cares; I had rather have too much, than too little, Life stagnates without action—I could never bear to merely vegetate, “waters Stagnate, when they cease to flow”
