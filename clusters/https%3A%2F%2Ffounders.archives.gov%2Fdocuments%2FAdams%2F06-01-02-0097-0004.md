Martis, 2 Die Martii, A.D. 1773 Post-Meridiem  
May it please your Excellency,  
  
In your Speech at the Opening of the present Session, your Excellency express’d your Displeasure at some late Proceedings of the Town of Boston, and other principal Towns in the Province. And in another Speech to both Houses we have your repeated Ex­ceptions at the same Proceedings as being “unwarrantable,” and of a dangerous Nature and Tendency; “against which you thought yourself bound to call upon us to join with you in bearing a proper Testimony.” This House have not discovered any Principles advanced by the Town of Boston, that are unwarrantable by the Constitution; nor does it appear to us that they have “invited every other Town and District in the Province to adopt their Principles.” We are fully convinced that it is our Duty to bear our Testimony against “Innovations of a dangerous Nature and Tendency:” but it is clearly our Opinion, that it is the indisputable Right of all or any of his Majesty’s Subjects in this Province, regularly and orderly to meet together to state the Grievances they labor under; and to propose and unite in such constitutional Measures as they shall judge necessary or proper to obtain Redress. This Right has been frequently exercised by his Majesty’s Subjects within the Realm; and we do not recollect an Instance, since the happy Revolution, when the two Houses of Parliament have been called upon to discountenance or bear their Testimony against it, in a Speech from the Throne.  
Your Excellency is pleased to take Notice of some Things which we “alledge” in our Answer to your first Speech: And the Observation you make, we must confess, is as natural and as undeniably true, as any one that could have been made; that “if our Foundation shall fail us in every Part of it, the Fabrick we have rais’d upon it, must certainly fall.” You think, this Foundation will fail us; but we wish your Excellency had condescended to a Consideration of what we have “adduced in Support of our Principles.” We might then perhaps have had some Things offered for our Conviction, more than bare Affirmations; which, we must beg to be excused if we say, are far from being sufficient, though they came with your Excellency’s Authority, for which however we have a due Regard.  
Your Excellency says that “as English Subjects and agreeable to the Doctrine of the Feudal Tenure all our Lands are held mediately or immediately of the Crown.” We trust your Excellency does not mean to introduce the Feudal System in it’s Perfection; which to use the Words of one of our greatest Historians, was “a State of perpetual War, Anarchy and Confusion; calculated solely for Defence against the Assaults of any foreign Power, but in it’s Provision for the interior Order and Tranquility of Society extremely defective.” “A Constitution so contradictory to all the Principles that govern Mankind, could never be brought about but by foreign Conquest or native Usurpation:” And a very celebrated Writer calls it “that most iniquitous and absurd Form of Government by which human Nature was so shamefully degraded.” This System of Iniquity by a strange Kind of Fatility, “though originally form’d for an Encampment and for Military Purposes only, spread over a great Part of Europe:” and to serve the Purposes of Oppression and Tyranny “was adopted by Princes and wrought into their Civil Constitutions;” and aided by the Canon Law, calculated by the Roman Pontiff, to exalt himself above all that is called God, it prevailed to the almost utter Extinction of Knowledge, Virtue, Religion and Liberty from that Part of the Earth. But from the Time of the Reformation, in Proportion as Knowledge, which then darted its Rays upon the benighted World, increas’d and spread among the People, they grew impatient under this heavy Yoke: And the most virtuous and sensible among them, to whose Stedfastness we in this distant Age and Climate are greatly indebted, were determined to get rid of it: And tho’ they have in a great Measure subdued it’s Power and Influence in England, they have never yet totally eradicated its Principles.  
Upon these Principles the King claimed an absolute Right to and a perfect Estate in all the Lands within his Dominions; but how he came by this absolute Right and perfect Estate is a Mystery which we have never seen unravelled, nor is it our Business or Design at present to enquire. He granted Parts or Parcels of it to his Friends the great Men, and they granted lesser Parcels to their Tenants: All therefore derived their Right and held their Lands, upon these Principles mediately or immediately of the King; which Mr. Blackstone however calls “in Reality a meer Fiction of our English Tenures.”  
By what Right in Nature and Reason the Christian Princes in Europe claimed the Lands of Heathen People, upon a Discovery made by any of their Subjects, is equally mysterious: Such however was the Doctrine universally prevailing when the Lands in America were discovered; but as the People of England upon those Principles held all the Lands they possessed by Grants from the King, and the King had never granted the Lands in America to them, it is certain they could have no Sort of Claim to them: Upon the Principles advanced, the Lordship and Dominion like that of the Lands in England, was in the King solely: and a Right from thence accrued to him of disposing such Territories under such Tenure and for such Services to be performed, as the King or Lord thought proper. But how the Grantees became Subjects of England, that is the Supreme Authority of the Parliament, your Excellency has not explained to us. We conceive that upon the Feudal Principles all Power is in the King; they afford us no Idea of Parliament. “The Lord was in early Times the Legislator and Judge over all his Feudatories,” says Judge Blackstone. By the Struggles for Liberty in England from the Days of King John to the last happy Revolution, the Constitution has been gradually changing for the better; and upon the more rational Principles that all Men by Nature are in a State of Equality in Respect of Jurisdiction and Dominion, Power in England has been more equally divided. And thus also in America, though we hold our Lands agreeably to the Feudal Principles of the King; yet our Predecessors wisely took Care to enter into Compact with the King that Power here should also be equally divided agreeable to the original fundamental Principles of the English Constitution, declared in Magna Charta, and other Laws and Statutes of England, made to confirm them.  
Your Excellency says, “you can by no Means concede to us that it is now or was when the Plantations were first granted the Prerogative of the Kings of England to constitute a Number of new Governments altogether independent of the Sovereign Authority of the English Empire.” By the Feudal Principles upon which you say “all the Grants which have been made of America are founded” “the Constitutions of the Emperor have the Force of Law.” If our Government be considered as merely Feudatory, we are subject to the King’s absolute Will, and there is no Room for the Authority of Parliament, as the Sovereign Authority of the British Empire. Upon these Principles, what could hinder the King’s constituting a Number of Independent Governments in America? That King Charles the First did actually set up a Government in this Colony, conceding to it Powers of making and executing Laws, without any Reservation to the English Parliament, of Authority to make future Laws binding therein, is a Fact which your Excellency has not disproved if you have denied it. Nor have you shewn that the Parliament or Nation objected to it, from whence we have inferred that it was an acknowledged Right. And we cannot conceive, why the King has not the same Right to alienate and dispose of Countries acquired by the Discovery of his Subjects, as he has to “restore upon a Treaty of Peace Countries which have been acquired in War,” carried on at the Charge of the Nation; or to “sell and deliver up any Part of his Dominions to a foreign Prince or State, against the General Sense of the Nation” which is “an Act of Power” or Prerogative which your Excellency allows. You tell us that “when any new Countries are discovered by English Subjects, according to the general Law and Usage of Nations, they become Part of the State.” The Law of Nations is or ought to be founded on the Law of Reason. It was the saying of Sir Edwin Sandis, in the great Case of the Union of the Realm of Scotland with England, which is applicable to our present Purpose, that “there being no Precedent for this Case in the Law, the Law is deficient; and the Law being deficient, Recourse is to be had to Custom; and Custom being insufficient, we must recur to natural Reason,” the greatest of all Authorities, which he adds “is the Law of Nations.” The Opinions therefore, and Determinations of the greatest Sages and Judges of the Law in the Exchequer Chamber ought not to be considered as decisive or binding in our present Controversy with your Excellency, any further than they are consonant to natural Reason. If however we were to recur to such Opinions and Determinations we should find very great Authorities in our Favour, to show that the Statutes of England are not binding on those who are not represented in Parliament there. The Opinion of Lord Coke that Ireland was bound by Statutes of England wherein they were named, if compared with his other Writings, appears manifestly to be grounded upon a Supposition, that Ireland had by an Act of their own, in the Reign of King John, consented to be thus bound, and upon any other Supposition, this Opinion would be against Reason; for Consent only gives human Laws their Force. We beg Leave, upon what your Excellency has observed, of the Colony becoming Part of the State, to subjoin the Opinions of several learned Civilians, as quoted by a very able Lawyer in this Country; “Colonies, says Puffendorf, are settled in different Methods. For either the Colony continues a Part of the Common Wealth it was sent out from; or else is obliged to pay a dutiful Regard to the Mother Common Wealth, and to be in Readiness to defend and vindicate its Honor, and so is united to it by a Sort of unequal Confederacy; or lastly, is erected into a seperate Common Wealth and assumes the same Rights, with the State it descended from.” And King Tullius Tullus, as quoted by the same learned Author from Grotius, says “We look upon it to be neither Truth nor Justice that Mother Cities ought of Necessity and by the Law of Nature to rule over the Colonies.”  
Your Excellency has misinterpreted what we have said, “that no Country by the Common Law, was subject to the Laws or the Parliament but the Realm of England,” and are pleased to tell us that we have expressed ourselves “Incautiously.” We beg Leave to recite the Words of the Judges of England in the beforementioned Case to our Purpose. “If a King go out of England with a Company of his Servants, Allegiance remaineth among his Subjects and Servants, altho’ he be out of his Realm whereto his Laws are confined.” We did not mean to say, as your Excellency would suppose, that “the Common Law prescribes Limits to the Extent of the Legislative Power,” though we shall always affirm it to be true of the Law of Reason and natural Equity. Your Excellency thinks you have made it appear, that “the Colony of Massachusetts-Bay is holden as feudatory of the Imperial Crown of England;” and therefore you say, “to use the Words of a very great Authority in a Case in some Respects analogous to it,” being feudatory it necessary follows, that “it is under the Government of the King’s Laws.” Your Excellency has not named this Authority; but we conceive his Meaning must be, that being Feudatory, it is under the Government of the King’s Laws absolutely; for as we have before said the Feudal System admits of no Idea of the Authority of Parliament, and this would have been the Case of the Colony but for the Compact with the King in the Charter.  
Your Excellency says, that “Persons thus holding under the Crown of England remain or become Subjects of England;” by which we suppose your Excellency to mean, subject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament “to all Intents and Purposes as fully as if any of the Royal Manors, &amp;c. within the Realm had been granted to them upon the like Tenure.” We apprehend with Submission, your Excellency is Mistaken in supposing that our Allegiance is due to the Crown of England. Every Man swears Allegiance for himself to his own King in his Natural Person. “Every Subject is presumed by Law to be Sworn to the King, which is to his Natural Person,” says Lord Coke. Rep. on Calvins Case. “The Allegiance is due to his Natural Body.” And he says “in the Reign of Edward II. the Spencers, the Father and the Son, to cover the Treason hatched in their Hearts, invented this damnable and damned Opinion, that Homage and Oath of Allegiance was more by Reason of the King’s Crown, that is of his politick Capacity, than by Reason of the Person of the King; upon which Opinion they infer’d execrable and detestable Consequents.” The Judges of England, all but one, in the Case of the Union between Scotland and England, declared that “Allegiance followeth the natural Person not the politick;” and “to prove the Allegiance to be tied to the Body natural of the King, and not to the Body politick, the Lord Coke cited the Phrases of diverse Statutes, mentioning our natural liege Sovereign.” —If then the Homage and Allegiance is not to the Body politick of the King, then it is not to him as the Head or any Part of that Legislative Au­thority, which your Excellency says “is equally extensive with the Authority of the Crown throughout every Part of the Dominion;” and your Excellency’s Observations thereupon must fail. The same Judges mention the Allegiance of a Subject to the Kings of England who is out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England; which is perfectly reconcileable with the Principles of our Ancestors quoted before from your Excellency’s History, but upon your Excellency’s Principles appears to us to be an Absurdity. The Judges, speaking of a Subject, say, “although his Birth was out of the Bounds of the Kingdom of England, and out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England, yet if it were within the Allegiance of the King of England, &amp;c. Normandy, Acquitan, Gascoign, and other Places within the Limits of France, and consequently out of the Realm or Bounds of the Kingdom of England, were in Subjection to the Kings of England. And the Judges say, “ Rex et Regnum be not so Relatives, as a King can be King but of one Kingdom, which clearly holdeth not but that his Kingly Power extending to divers Nations and Kingdoms, all owe him equal Subjection and are equally born to the Benefit of his Protection, and altho’ he is to govern them by their distinct Laws, yet any one of the People coming into the other is to have the Benefit of the Laws wheresoever he cometh.” So they are not to be deemed Aliens, as your Excellency in your Speech supposes in any of the Dominions; all which accords with the Principles our Ancestors held. “And he is to bear the Burden of Taxes of the Place where he cometh, but living in one or for his Livelihood in one, he is not to be taxed in the other, because Laws ordain Taxes, Impositions and Charges as a Discipline of Subjection particularized to every particular Nation:” Nothing we think, can be more clear to our Purpose than this Decision, of Judges, perhaps as learned as ever adorned the English Nation; or in Favor of America in her present Controversy with the Mother State.  
Your Excellency says, that by our not distinguishing between the Crown of England and the Kings and Queens of England in their personal or natural Capacities, we have been led into a fundamental Error. “Upon this very Distinction we have availed ourselves. We have said that our Ancestors considered the Land which they took Possession of in America as out of the Bounds of the Kingdom of England, and out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England; and that the King also even in the Act of granting the Charter, considered the Territory as not within the Realm; that the King had an absolute Right in himself to dispose of the Lands, and that this was not dis­puted by the Nation; nor could the Lands on any solid Grounds be claimed by the Nation, and therefore our Ancestors received the Lands by Grant from the King, and at the same Time compacted with him and promised him Homage and Allegiance, not in his publick or politick but natural Capacity only.—If it be difficult for us to show how the King acquired a Title to this Country in his natural Capacity, or seperate from his Relation to his Subjects, which we confess, yet we conceive it will be equally difficult for your Excellency to show how the Body Politick and Nation of England acquired it. Our Ancestors supposed it was acquired by neither; and therefore they declared, as we have before quoted from your History, that saving their actual Purchase from the Natives, of the Soil, the Dominion, the Lordship, and Sovereignty, they had in the Sight of God and Man, no Right and Title to what they possessed. How much clearer then in natural Reason and Equity must our Title be, who hold Estates dearly purchased at the Expence of our own as well as our Ancestors Labour, and defended by them with Treasure and Blood.  
Your Excellency has been pleased to confirm, rather than deny or confute a Piece of History which you say we took from an anonimous Pamphlet, and by which you “fear we have been too easily misled.” It may be gathered from your own Declaration and other Authorities besides the anonimous Pamphlet, that the House of Commons took Exception, not at the King’s having made an absolute Grant of the Territory, but at the Claim of an exclusive Right to the Fishery on the Banks and Sea-Coast, by Virtue of the Patent. At this you say “the House of Commons was alarmed, and a Bill was brought in for allowing a Fishery.” And upon this Occasion your Excellency allows, that “one of the Secretaries of State declared that the Plantations were not annexed to the Crown, and so were not within the Jurisdiction of Parliament.” If we should concede to what your Excellency supposes might possibly or “perhaps” be the Case, that the Secretary made this Declaration “as his own Opinion,” the Event showed that it was the Opinion of the King too; for it is not to be accounted for upon any other Principle, that he would have denied his Royal Assent to a Bill formed for no other Purpose, but to grant his Subjects in England the Privileges of Fishing on the Sea Coasts in America. The Account published by Sir Ferdinando Gorges himself, of the Proceedings of Parliament on this Occasion, your Excellency thinks will remove all Doubt of the Sense of the Nation and of the Patentees of this Patent or Charter in 1620. “This Narrative, you say, has all the Appearance of Truth and Sincerity,” which we do not deny: and to us it carries this Conviction with it, that “what was objected” in Parliament was, the exclusive Claim of Fishing only. His imagining that he had satisfied the House after divers Attendances, that the Planting a Colony was of much more Consequence than a simple disorderly Course of Fishing, is sufficient for our Conviction. We know that the Nation was at that Time alarmed with Apprehensions of Monopolies; and if the Patent of New-England was presented by the two Houses as a Grievance, it did not show, as your Excellency supposes, “the Sense they then had of their Authority over this new-acquired Territory,” but only their Sense of the Grievance of a Monopoly of the Sea.  
We are happy to hear your Excellency say, that “our Remarks upon and Construction of the Words not repugnant to the Laws of England, are much the same with those of the Council.” It serves to confirm us in our Opinion, in what we take to be the most important Matter of Difference between your Excellency and the two Houses. After saying, that the Statute of 7th and 8th of William and Mary favors the Construction of the Words as intending such Laws of England as are made more immediately to respect us, you tell us, that “the Province Agent Mr. Dummer in his much applauded Defence, says that then a Law of the Plantations may be said to be repugnant to a Law made in Great-Britain, when it flatly contradicts it so far as the Law made there mentions and relates to the Plantations.” This is plain and obvious to common Sense, and therefore cannot be denied. But if your Excellency will read a Page or two further in that excellent Defence, you will see that he mentions this as the Sense of the Phrase, as taken from an Act of Parliament, rather than as the Sense he would chuse himself to put upon it; and he expresly designs to shew, in Vindication of the Charter, that in that Sense of the Words, there never was a Law made in the Plantations repugnant to the Laws of Great-Britain. He gives another Construction much more likely to be the true Intent of the Words; namely, “that the Patentees shall not presume under Colour of their particular Charters to make any Laws inconsistent with the Great Charter and other Laws of England, by which the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of Englishmen are secured.” This is the Sense in which our Ancestors understood the Words; and therefore they were unwilling to conform to the Acts of Trade, and disregarded them all till they made Provision to give them Force in the Colony by a Law of their own; saying, that “the Laws of England did not reach America: And those Acts were an Invasion of their Rights, Liberties and Properties,” because they were not “represented in Parliament.” The Right of being governed only by Laws which were made by Persons in whose Election they had a Voice, they looked upon as the Foundation of English Liberties. By the Compact with the King in the Charter, they were to be as free in America, as they would have been if they had remained within the Realm; and therefore they freely asserted that they “were to be governed by Laws made by themselves and by Officers chosen by themselves.” Mr. Dummer says, “It seems reasonable enough to think that the Crown,” and he might have added our Ancestors, “intended by this Injunction to provide for all its Subjects, that they might not be oppressed by arbitrary Power—but—being still Subjects, they should be protected by the same mild Laws, and enjoy the same happy Government as if they continued within the Realm”. And considering the Words of the Charter in this Light, he looks upon them as designed to be a Fence against Oppression and despotic Power. But the Construction which your Excellency puts upon the Words, reduce us to a State of Vassallage, and exposes us to Oppression and despotic Power, whenever a Parliament shall see fit to make Laws for that Purpose and put them in Execution.  
We flatter ourselves that from the large Extracts we have made from your Excellency’s History of the Colony, it appears evidently, that under both Charters it hath been the Sense of the People and of the Government that they were not under the Jurisdiction of Parliament. We pray you again to recur to those Quotations and our Observations upon them: And we wish to have your Excellency’s judicious Remarks. When we adduced that History to prove that the Sentiments of private Persons of Influence, four or five Years after the Restoration, were very different from what your Excellency apprehended them to be when you delivered your Speech, you seem to concede to it by telling us “it was, as you take it, from the Principles imbibed in those Times of Anarchy (preceeding the Restoration) that they disputed the Authority of Parliament;” but you add, “the Government would not venture to dispute it.” We find in the same History a Quotation from a Letter of Mr. Stoughton, dated 17 Years after the Restoration, mentioning “the Country’s not taking Notice of the Acts of Navigation to observe them.” And it was, as we take it, after that Time, that the Government declared in a Letter to their Agents, that they had not submitted to them; and they ventured to “dispute” the Jurisdiction, asserting that they apprehended the Acts to be an Invasion of the Rights, Liberties, and Properties of the Subjects of his Majesty in the Colony, they not being represented in Parliament; and that “the Laws of England did not reach America.” It very little avails in Proof that they conceded to the Supreme Authority of Parliament, their telling the Commissioners “that the Act of Navigation had for some Years before been observed here, that they knew not of its being greatly violated, and that such Laws as appeared to be against it were repealed.” It may as truly be said now, that the Revenue Acts are observed by some of the People of this Province; but it cannot be said that the Government and People of this Province have conceded that the Parliament had Authority to make such Acts to be observed here. Neither does their Declarations to the Commissioners that such Laws as appeared to be against the Act of Navigation were repealed, prove their Concession of the Authority of Parliament, by any Means so much as their making Provision for giving Force to an Act of Parliament within this Province, by a deliberate and solemn Act or Law of their own, proves the contrary.  
You tell us, that “the Government four or five Years before the Charter was vacated more explicitly,” that is than by a Conversation with the Commissioners, “acknowledge the Authority of Parliament, and voted that their Governor should take the Oath required of him faithfully to do and perform all Matters and Things enjoined him by the Acts of Trade.” But does this, may it please your Excellency, show their explicit Acknowledgment of the Authority of Parliament? Does it not rather show directly the contrary? For, what need could there be for their Vote or Authority to require him to take the Oath already required of him by the Act of Parliament, unless both he and they judged that an Act of Parliament was not of Force sufficient to bind him to take such Oath? We do not deny, but on the contrary are fully persuaded that your Excellency’s Principles in Government are still the same with what they appear to be in the History; for you there say, that “the passing the Law plainly shows the wrong Sense they had of the Relation they stood in to England.” But we are from hence convinced that your Excellency when you wrote the History was of our Mind in this Respect, that our Ancestors in passing the Law discovered their Opinion that they were without the Jurisdiction of Parliament: For it was upon this Principle alone that they shewed the wrong Sense they had in your Excellency’s Opinion, of the Relation they stood in to England.  
Your Excellency in your second Speech condescends to point out to us the Acts and Doings of the General Assembly which relates to Acts of Parliament, which you think “demonstrates that they have been acknowledged by the Assembly or submitted to by the People:” Neither of which in our Opinion shows that it was the Sense of the Nation, and our Predecessors when they first took Possession of this Plantation or Colony by a Grant and Charter from the Crown, that they were to remain subject to the Supreme Authority of the English Parliament.  
Your Excellency seems chiefly to rely upon our Ancestors, after the Revolution “proclaiming King William and Queen Mary in the Room of King James,” and taking the Oaths to them, “the Alteration of the Form of Oaths from Time to Time,” and finally “the Establishment of the Form which every one of us has complied with, as the Charter in express Terms requires and makes our Duty.” We do not know that it has ever been a Point in Dispute whether the Kings of England were ipso facto Kings in and over this Colony or Province, the Compact was made between King Charles the First, his Heirs and Successors, and the Governor and Company, their Heirs and Successors. It is easy upon this Principle to account for the Acknowledgment and Submission of King William and Queen Mary as Successors of Charles the First, in the Room of King James. Besides it is to be considered, that the People in the Colony as well as in England had suffered under the Tyrant James, by which he had alike forfeited his Right to reign over both. There had been a Revolution here as well as in England. The Eyes of the People here were upon William and Mary, and the News of their being proclaimed in England was as your Excellency’s History tells us, “the most joyful News ever received in New-England.” And if they were not proclaimed here “by Virtue of an Act of the Colony,” it was, as we think may be concluded from the Tenor of your History, with the general or universal Consent of the People as apparently as if “such Act had passed.” It is Consent alone, that makes any human Laws binding; and as a learned Author observes, a purely voluntary Submission to an Act, because it is highly in our Favor and for our Benefit, is in all Equity and Justice to be deemed as not at all proceeding from the Right we include in the Legislators, that they thereby obtain an Authority over us, and that ever hereafter we must obey them of Duty. We would observe that one of the first Acts of the General Assembly of this Province since the present Charter, was an Act requiring the taking the Oaths mentioned in an Act of Parliament, to which you refer us: For what Purpose was this Act of the Assembly passed, if it was the Sense of the Legislators that the Act of Parliament was in Force in the Province. And at the same Time another Act was made for the Establishment of other Oaths necessary to be taken; both which Acts have the Royal Sanction, and are now in Force. Your Excellency says, that when the Colony applied to King William for a second Charter, they knew the Oath the King had taken, which was to govern them according to the Statutes in Parliament, and (which your Excellency here omits) the Laws and Customs of the same. By the Laws and Customs of Parliament, the People of England freely debate and consent to such Statutes as are made by themselves or their chosen Representatives. This is a Law or Custom which all Mankind may justly challenge as their inherent Right. According to this Law the King has an undoubted Right to govern us. Your Excellency upon Recollection surely will not infer from hence, that it was the Sense of our Predecessors that there was to remain a Supremacy in the English Parliament, or a full Power and Authority to make Laws binding upon us in all Cases whatever, in that Parliament where we cannot debate and deliberate upon the Necessity or Expediency of any Law, and consequently without our Consent, and as it may probably happen destructive of the first Law of Society, the Good of the Whole. You tell us that “after the Assumption of all the Powers of Government, by Virtue of the new Charter, an Act passed for the reviving for a limited Time all the local Laws of the Massachusetts-Bay and New-Plymouth respectively, not repugnant to the Laws of England. And at the same Session an Act passed establishing Naval Officers, that all undue Trading contrary to an Act of Parliament—may be prevented.” Among the Acts that were then revived we may reasonably suppose was that whereby Provision was made to give Force to this Act of Parliament in the Province. The Establishment therefore of the Naval Officers was to aid the Execution of an Act of Parliament; for the Observance of which within the Colony, the Assembly had before made Provision, after free Debates, with their own Consent and by their own Act.  
The Act of Parliament passed in 1741, for putting an End to several unwarrantable Schemes, mentioned by your Excellency, was designed for the general Good, and if the Validity of it was not disputed, it cannot be urged as a Concession of the Supreme Authority, to make Laws binding on us in all Cases whatever. But if the Design of it was for the general Benefit of the Province, it was in one Respect at least greatly complained of by the Persons more immediately affected by it; and to remedy the Inconvenience, the Legislative of this Province pass’d an Act, directly militating with it; which is the strongest Evidence, that altho’ they may have submitted sub silentio to some Acts of Parliament that they conceived might operate for their Benefit, they did not conceive themselves bound by any of its Acts which they judged would operate to the Injury even of Individuals.  
  
Your Excellency has not thought proper to attempt to confute the Reasoning of a learned Writer on the Laws of Nature and Nations, quoted by us on this Occasion, to shew that the Authority of the Legislature does not extend so far as the Fundamentals of the Constitution. We are unhappy in not having your Remarks upon the Reasoning of that great Man; and until it is confuted, we shall remain of the Opinion, that the Fundamentals of the Constitution being excepted from the Commission of the Legislators, none of the Acts or Doings of the General Assembly, however deliberate and solemn, could avail to change them, if the People have not in very express Terms given them the Power to do it; and that much less ought their Acts and Doings however numerous, which barely refer to Acts of Parliament made expresly to relate to us, to be taken as an Acknowledgment that we are subject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament.  
We shall sum up our own Sentiments in the Words of that learned Writer Mr. Hooker, in his Ecclesiastical Policy, as quoted by Mr. Locke, “The lawful Power of making Laws to command whole political Societies of Men, belonging so properly to the same intire Societies, that for any Prince or Potentate of what kind soever, to exercise the same of himself, and not from express Commission immediately and personally received from God, is no better than mere Tyranny. Laws therefore they are not which publick Approbation hath not made so, for Laws human of what kind soever are available by Consent.” “Since Men naturally have no full and perfect Power to command whole politick Multitudes of Men, therefore, utterly without our Consent we could in such Sort be at no Man’s Commandment living. And to be commanded we do not consent when that Society whereof we be a Part, hath at any Time before consented.” We think your Excellency has not proved, either that the Colony is a Part of the politick Society of England, or that it has ever consented that the Parliament of England or Great-Britain should make Laws binding upon us in all Cases whatever, whether made expresly to refer to us or not.  
We cannot help before we conclude, expressing our great Concern, that your Excellency has thus repeatedly, in a Manner insisted upon our free Sentiments on Matters of so delicate a Nature, and weighty Importance. The Question appears to us to be no other, than Whether we are the Subjects of absolute unlimitted Power, or of a free Government formed on the Principles of the English Constitution. If your Excellency’s Doctrine be true, the People of this Province hold their Lands of the Crown and People of England, and their Lives, Liberties and Properties are at their Disposal; and that even by Compact and their own Consent. They are subject to the King as the Head alterius Populi of another People, in whose Legislative they have no Voice or Interest. They are indeed said to have a Constitution and a Legislative of their own, but your Excellency has explained it into a mere Phantom; limitted, controuled, superceded and nullified at the Will of another. Is this the Constitution which so charmed our Ancestors, that as your Excellency has informed us, they kept a Day of solemn Thanksgiving to Almighty God when they received it? and were they Men of so little Discernment, such Children in Understanding, as to please themselves with the Imagination that they were blessed with the same Rights and Liberties which natural-born Subjects in England enjoyed? when at the same Time they had fully consented to be ruled and ordered by a Legislative a Thousand Leagues distant from them, which cannot be supposed to be sufficiently acquainted with their Circumstances, if concerned for their Interest, and in which they cannot be in any Sense represented.

By what Right in Nature an Reaſon tha  
Chriſtian Princes in Europe claimed the Lands  
of Heathen People, upon a Diſcovery made by  
any of their Subjects, is equally myſterious : Such  
however was the Doctrine univerſally prevailing  
when the Lands in America were diſcovered ;  
but as the People of England upon thoſe Prin-  
  
  
from the King, and the King had never granted  
the Lands in America 7 7 it is certain they  
could have no Sort of Claim to them: Upon the  
Principles advanced, the Lordſhip and Dominion  
like that of the Lands in England, was ig the  
King fole&#x27;y : and a Right from thence accrued  
to him of ff (poſing (ach Territories under {uct  
Tenure and for ſuch Services to be performed,

udge Blackſtone. By the Struggles for Liberty  
in England trom the Days of King John to the  
| laſt happy Revolution, the Conſtitution has been  
gradually changing for the better; and upon the  
more rational Principles that all Men by Nature  
are in a State of Equality in Reſpe@ of juriſdic-  
tion and Dominion, Power in England has been  
more equally divided. And thus alfo in America,  
though we hold our Lands agreeably to the Feu-  
dal Principles of the King; yet our Predeceſſors  
wiſely took care to enter into Compact with the  
King that Power here ſhould alſo be equally divi-  
ded agreeable to the original fundamental Princis  
  
les of the Engliſh Conſtitution, declared in  
Magna Charter, and other Laws and Statutes of  
England, made to confirm them,  
  
  
Means concede to us that it is now or was when  
the Plantations were firſt granted the Prerogative  
of the Kings of England to conſtitute a Number  
of new Governments altogether independent of  
the Sovereign Authority of the Engliſh Empire.”  
By the Feudal Principles upen which you ſay  
„all the Grants which have been made of Ame-  
rica are founded” © the Conſtitutions of the  
Empcror have the Force of Law.” If our Go-  
vernment be conſidered as merely Feudatory,  
we are ſubject to the King&#x27;s abſolute Will, and  
there is no Room for the Authority of Parliament,  
zs the Sovereign Authority of the Britiih Em—  
pire. Upon theſe Principles, what could hinder  
  
the  
  
2 Z ˙ 1 — Ä 2 wWHy) s 2  
  
the King&#x27;s conſtituting a Number of independent  
Governments in America? That King Charles  
the Firſt did actually ſet up a Government in  
this Colony, conceding to it Powers of making  
and executing Laws, without any Reſervation to  
the Engliſh Parliament, of Authority to make  
future Laws binding therein, is a Fact which  
your Excellency has not diſproved if you have  
denied it. Nor have you ſhewn that the Par-  
lament or Nation objected to it, from whence  
we have inferred that it was an acknowledged  
Right. And we cannot conceive, why the King  
has not the ſame Right to alienate and diſ-  
poſe of Countries acquired by the Diſcovery of  
his Subjects, as he has te ** reſtore upon a Treaty  
of Peace Countries which have been acquired in  
War,“ carried on at the Charge of the Nation;  
or to ſell and deliver up any Part of his Do-  
minions to a foreign Prince or State, againſt the  
General Senſe of the Nation“ which is“ an Act  
of Power” or Pre rogative which yourExcellency  
allows. You tell us that when any New Coun-  
tries are diſcovered by Engliſh Subjects, accord-  
ing to the gencral Law and Uſage of Nations,  
they become Part of the State.” The Law of  
Nations is or ought to be founded on the Law of  
Reaſon. It was the Saying of Sir Edwin Sandis,  
in the great Caſe of the Union of the Realm of  
Scotland withEngland, which is applicable to our  
prefent Purpoſe, that ** there being no Precedent  
for this Caſe in the Law, the Law is deficient ;  
and the Law being deficient, Recourſe is to be  
had to Cuſtom ; and Cuftom being inſufficient,  
we mult recur to natural Reaſon,” the greateſt  
of all Authorities, which he adds“ is the Law  
  
  
Lt: 0-1  
of Nations.” The Opinions therefore, and De-  
termination of the greateſt Sages and Judges of  
the Law in the Exchequer Chamber ought not  
to be conſidered as decifive or binding in our pre-  
ſent Controverſy with your Excellency, any  
further than they are conſonant to natural Reaſon.  
If however we were to recur to ſuch Opinions  
and Determinations we ſhould find very great  
Authorities in our Favour, to ſhow that the Sta-  
rutes of England are not binding on thoſe who  
are not repreſented in Parliament there. The  
Opinion of Lord Coke that Ireland was bound  
by Statutes of England wherein they were named,  
it compared with his other Writings, appears  
manifeſtly to be grounded upor, a Suppoſition,  
that Ireland had by an Act of their own, in the  
Reign of King John, conſented to be thus bound,  
and upon any other Suppoſition this Opinion  
would be againſt Reaſon ; for Conſent only gives  
human Laws their Force. We beg I.eave, upon  
what your Excellency has obſerved of the Colo-  
ny becoming a Part of the State, to ſubjoin the  
Opinions of feveral learned Civilians, as quoted  
by a very able Lawyer in this Country; “ Colo-  
nies, ſays Puflendorf, are ſettled in Cifferent  
Methods. For either the Colony continues a  
Part of the Common Wealth it was ſet ont  
from; or elſe is obliged to pay a dutiful  
Regard to the Mother Common Wealth, and  
to be in Readineſs to defend and vindicate its  
Honor, and ſo is united by a Sort of uncqual  
Confederacy ; or laſtly, is ereded into a ſeperate  
  
  
with the State it deſcended from.” And King  
Tullius, as quoted by the ſame learned Author

Your Excellency has miſinterpreted what we  
bave ſaid, that no Country by the Common Law,  
was ſubject to the Laws or the Parliament but the Tl  
Realm of England,“ and are pleaſed to tell us that vl  
we have expreſſed ourſelves ** Incautiouſly.”? We ||  
beg Leave to recite the Words of the Judges of Eng - Jl  
land in the beforementioned Caſe to our Purpoſe. Ci  
«« If a King go out of England with a Company I  
of his Servants, Allegjance remaineth among his  
Subjects and Servants, altho&#x27; he be out of his  
  
Realm whereto his Laws are confined,” We did  
  
not mean to fay, as your Excellency would ſup- bl  
poſe, that ** the Common Law preſcribes Limits 4  
to the Extent of the Legiſlative Power,” though  
we ſhall always affirm it to be true of theLaw of  
Reaſon and natural Equity. Your Excellency  
thinks you have made it appear, that the Colony  
of Maſſichuſetts-Bay is holden as feudatory of  
che Imperial Crown of England;“ and therefore  
you ſay, © to uſe the Words of a very great Au-  
thority in aCaſe in ſome Reſpects analogous to it,  
being feudatory it neceſſarily follows, that it is  
under the Government of the King&#x27;s Laws.“  
Your Exceilency has not named this Authority;  
but we conceive his Meaning mult be, that be-  
ing Feudatory, it is under the Government of the  
King&#x27;s Laws a%/5lutely ; for as we have befcre  
ſaid the Feudal Syſtem admits of no Idea ot rae  
Authority of Parliament, and this would have  
  
N been  
  
[ 98 J.  
  
been the Caſe of the Colony but for the Com.  
pa@ with the King i in the Charter.  
  
Your Excellenc y ſays, that Perſons thus hold-  
ing under the Crown of England remain or be-  
come Subjects of England;? by which we ſup-  
poſe your Excellency to mean, fuabject to the Su-  
preme Authority of Parliament “to all Intents  
and Pur poſes as fully as if any of the Royal Ma-  
nors, &amp;c. within the Realm had been Granted  
io them upon the like Tenure,” We apprehend  
with Submiſſion, your Excellency is Miſtaken in  
ſuppoſing that our Allegiance is due to the Crown  
of England. Every Man ſwears Allegiance for  
himfelf to his own King in his Natural Perfon.  
Every Subject is prefumed by Law to be Sworn  
ro the King, which is to his Natural Perſon,”  
fays Lord Coke. Rep. on Calvins Caſe. The  
Allegiance is due to his Natural Body.” And  
he fays in the Reign of Edward II. {Seay  
cers, the Father and the Son, to cover the &#x27;T rea»  
fon hatched in their Hearts, invented this dame  
nable and damned Opinion, that Hemage and  
Oath of Allegiance was more by Reaſon of the  
King&#x27;s Crown, that is of his politick Capacity,  
  
  
upon which Opinion they infer*d execrable and  
deteſtable Con ſequenis.“ The Judges of Eng-  
land, all but one, in the Caſe of the Union be-  
tween Scotland and England, declared that  
« Allegiance followeth the natural Perſon not  
the politicx;“ and “ to prove the Allegtance to  
be tied to the Body natural of the King, and  
not to the Body politick, the Lord Coke cited  
  
  
natural  
  
(9-1  
  
natural liege Sovereign.“ Tf then the Homage  
and Allegiance is not to the Body politick of  
the King, then it is not to him as the Head or  
any Part of that Legiſlative Authority, which  
  
our Excellency ſays © is equally extenſive with  
the Authority of the Crown throughout every  
Part of the Dominion ;” and your Excellency&#x27;s  
Obſervations thereupon muſt fail. The ſame  
Judges mention the Allegiance of a Subject to  
the Kings of England who is out of the Reach  
and Extent of the Laws of England ; which is  
perfectly reconcileable with the Principles of our  
Anceſtors quoted before from your Excellency&#x27;s  
Hiftory, but upon your Excellency&#x27;s Principles  
appears to us to be an Abſurdity. The Judges,  
ſpeaking of a Subject, ſay, © although his Birth  
was out of the Bounds of the Kingdom of Eng-  
land, and out of the Reach and Extent of the  
Laws of England, yet if it were within the  
  
d of the King of England, &amp;c. Nor-  
  
mandy, Acquitain, Gaſcoign, and other Places  
within the Limits of France, and conſequently  
  
  
England, were in Subjection to the Kings of  
England. And the Judges ſay, Rex et Reg-  
num be not ſo Relatives, as a King can be King  
but of one Kingdom, which clearly holdeth not  
but that his Kingly Power extending to divers  
Nations and Kingdoms, all owe him equal Sub-  
jection and are equally born to the Benefit of his  
Protection, and altho&#x27; he is to govern them by  
their diſtindt Laws, yet any one of the People  
coming into the other is to have the Benefit of  
the Laws whereſoever he cometh.” So they  
are not to be deemed Aliens, as your Excelleu—  
  
N 2 cy

ey in your Speech ſuppoſes in any of the Do-  
= Foy all ebich 3 with the Principles  
our Anceſtors held. And he is to bear the  
Burden of Taxes of the Place where he cometh,  
but living in one or for his Liyelihood in one,  
he is not to be taxed in the other, becauſe Laws  
ordain Taxes, . Impoſitions and Charges as a Diſ-  
cipline of Subjection particulatized to every par-  
ticular Nation:“ Nothing we think, can be more  
clear to our Purpoſe than this Deciſion, of Judges,  
peringe as learned as ever adorned the Engliſh  
Nation; or in Favor of America in her preſent  
Controverſy with the Mother State,  
  
Yout Excellency ſays, that by out not diſtin-  
uiſhing between the Crown of England and the  
Kings and Queens of England in their perſonal  
  
  
damental Error.“ Upon this very Diſtinction  
  
  
our Anceſtors conſidered the Land which they  
  
  
Bounds of the Kingdom of England, and out  
ef the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England;  
and that the King alfo even in the Act ef grant-  
ing the Charter, conſidered the Territgry as 261  
within the Realm; that the King had an abſo—  
lote Right in himſelf to diſpoſe of the Lands,  
and that this was not diſputed by the Nation;  
nor could the Lands on any ſolid Grounds be  
claimed by the Nation, and therefore our An—  
ceſtors received the Lands by Grant from the  
King, and at the ſame Time compacted with him

Capacity only. — If it be difficult fœr us  
to ſhow how the King acquired a Title to this  
Country in his natural Capacity, or ſeparate from  
his Relation to his Subjects, which we confeſs,  
yet we conceive it will be equally difficult for  
your Excellency to ſhow how the Body Politick  
and Nation of England acquired it. Our Ance-  
ſtors ſuppoſed it was acquired by neither ; and  
therefore they declared, as we have before quo-  
ted from your Hiſtory, that ſaving their actual  
  
Purchaſe from the Natives, of the Soil, the Do-  
minion, the Lordſhip, and Sovereignty, they  
had in the Sight of Gad and Man, no Right and  
Title to what they poſſeſſed. How much clear-  
er then in natural Reaſon and Equity mult our  
Title be, who bold Eſtates dearly purchaſed at  
the Expence of our own as well as our Anceſtors

and Blood,  
  
Your Excellency has been pleaſed to confirm,  
rather than deny or confute a Piece of Hiſtory  
which you ſay we took from an anonimous Pam-  
phlet, and by which you © fear we have been  
too ealily miſled.” It may be gathered from  
your own Declaration and other Authorities be-  
ſides the ai&#x27;o i nous Pamphlet, that the Houſe  
of Commons took Exception, not at the King&#x27;s  
having made an abſolute Grant of the Territory.  
but at the Claim of an excluſive Right to the  
Filhery on the Banks and Sea Coaſt, by Virtue  
of the Patent. At this you ſy © the i louſe of

the Secretaries of State declared that the Plan-  
tations were not annexed to tlie Crown, and fo  
were not within the Juriſdiction of Parliament,”  
If we ſhould concede to what your Excellency  
ſuppoſes might poſſibly or ** perhaps“ be the  
Cafe, that the Secretary made this Dethration  
* as his own Opinion,” the Event ſhowed that  
It was the Opinion of the King too; for it is not  
to be accounted for upon any other Principle,  
that he would have denied his Royal Aſſent to a  
Bill formed for no other Purpoſe, but to grant  
his Subjects in England the Privilege of Fiſhing  
on the Sea Coaſts in America, The Account  
publiſhed by Sir Ferdinando Gorges himſelf, of  
the Proceedings of Parliament en this Occafion,  
your Excellency thinks will remove all Doubt  
of the Senſe of the Nation and of the Patentees  
of this Patent or. Charter in 1620. © &#x27;ThisNar-  
rative, you ſay, has all the Appearance of Truth  
and Sincerity,” which we do not deny: And to  
us it carries this Con viction with it, that what  
was objccted&#x27; in Parliament was, the excluſive  
Claim of Fiſhing only. His imagining that he  
had fatished the Houſe after divers Attendances,  
that the Planting a Colony was of much more  
Confequence than a ſimple diſorderly Courſe of  
 F&#x27;i/hing, is ſufficient for our Conviction. We  
know that the Nation was at that Lim alarmed  
with Apprehenfions of Mononolies ; and if the  
Patent of New-England was prelunted by the two  
Houſes as a Grievance, it did not , as your  
Excellency ſuppoſes, * the Senſe they then had  
of their Authority over this new-acquired Per-  
ritory,” but only their Senſe of the Grievance of  
a Monopoly of the Sea.  
  
We  
  
1 163 0  
  
We are ha to hear your Exeellency ſay;  
that * our, &quot;robo u 3 Conſtruston t  
the Words not repugnant to the Larus of England,  
are much the ſame, with thoſe of the Council.“ It  
ſerves to confirm us in our Opinion, in what we  
take to be the moſt important Matter of Difference  
between your Excellency and the two Houſes,  
After ſaying, that the Statute of 7th and 8th of  
William and Mary favors the Conſtruction of  
the Words as intending ſuch Laws of England as  
are made more immediately to reſpect us, you  
tell vs, that © the Province Agent Mr. Dummer  
in his much applauded Defence, ſays that then a  
Law.of the Plantations may be faid to be repug-  
nant to a Law made in Great-Britain, when it  
flatly contradiQts it fo far as the Law made there  
mentions and relates to the Plantations,” This  
is plain and obvious to common Senſe, and there-  
fore cannot be denied. But if your Excellency  
will read a Page or two further in that excellem  
Defence, you will ſee that he mentions this as  
the Senſe of the Phraſe, as taken from an Act of  
Parliament, rather than as the Senſe he would  
chuſe himſelf to put upon it; and he. exprefly  
deſigns to ſhew, in Vindication of the Charter,  
that in that Senſe of the Words, there never was  
a Law made in the Plantations repugnant to the  
Laws of Great-Britain. He gives another Con-  
ſtruction much more likely to be the true Intent  
of the Words; namely, that the Patentees ſhall  
not preſume under Colour of their particular Char-  
ters to make any Laus inconſiſtent with theGreat  
Charter and other Laws of England, by which  
the Lives Liberties, and Properties of Engliſt-  
men are ſecured,” This is the Senſe in which

of Trade, and diſregarded them till they n ade  
Proviſion to give them Force in the Colony by a  
Law of their own; ſaying, that “the Laws of  
England did not reach America: And thoſe Acts  
were an Invafion of their Rights, Libertics and  
Properties,” becauſe they were not © repreſented  
in Parliament.“ The Right of being governed  
only by Laws which were made by Perſons in  
whoſe Election they had a Voice, they looked up-  
  
  
the Compact with the King in the Charter, they  
were to be as free inAmerica, as they would have  
  
  
therefore they freely aſſerted that they “ were  
to be governed by Laws made by themſelves and  
  
  
fays, © It ſeems reaſonavle enough to think that  
the Crown,” and he might have added our An-  
ceſtors, „intended by this Injunction to provide  
for all its Subjects, that they might not be op-  
preſſed by Arbitrary Power —but—being ſtill  
Subjects, they ſhould be protected by the ſame  
  
  
ment as if they continued within tne Realm,”  
And conſidering the Words of the Charter in  
this Light, he looks upon them as deſigned to be  
a Fence againſt Oppreſſion and deſpotie Po ver.  
But the Conſtruction which your Exeellency puts  
upon the Words, reduces us to a State of Vaſſal-  
lage, and expoſes us to Oppreſſion and deſpotic  
Power, whenever a Parliament ſhall fee fit ta  
  
make Laws for that Purpoſe and put them in Ex ·  
ecutlon.

We flatter ourſelves that from the large Ex-  
tracts we have made from your Excellency&#x27;s Hi-  
ftory of the Colony, it appears evidently, that  
under both Charters it hath been the Senſe of  
the People and of the Government that they were  
not under the Juriſdiction of Parliament. We  
  
  
our Obſervations upon them: And we wifh to  
have your Excellency&#x27;s judicious Remarks.  
When we adduced that Hiſtory to prove that the  
Sentiments of private Perſons of Influence, four  
or five” Years after the Reſtoration, were E  
different from what your Excellency apprehend-  
ed them to be when you delivered your Speech,  
you ſeem to con cede to it by telling us it was,  
as you take it, from the Principles imbibed in  
thoſe Times of Anarchy (preceeding the Reſto-  
ration) that they diſputed the Authority of Par-  
liament ;” but you add, „ the Government  
would not venture to diſpute it,” We find in  
the ſame Hiſtory a Quotation from a Letter of  
Mr. Stoughton, dated 17 Years after the Reſto-  
ration, mentioning. * rhe Country&#x27;s not taking  
Notice of the Acts of Navigation 9 0b/erve them.“  
And it was, as we take it, after that Time, that  
the Government declared in a Letter to theit  
Agents, that they had not ſubmitted to them ;  
and they ventured to diſpute“ the Juriſdiction,  
aſſerting that they apprehended the Acts to be an  
Invaſion of the Rights, Liberties and Properties  
of the Subjects of his Mzjeſty in the Colony, they  
not being repreſented in Parliament ; and that  
the Laws of England did not reach America.“  
Ic very little avails in Proof that they conceded

telling the Commiſſioners that the Act of Na-  
vigation had for ſome Years before been obſerv-  
ed here, that they knew nat of its being greatly  
violated, and that ſuch Laws as appeared to be  
againſt it were repealed,” It may as truly be  
ſaid now, that the Revenue Acts are obſerved by  
ſame of the People of this Province ; but it can-  
not be ſaid that the Goveryment and People of  
this Province have conceded that the Parliament  
had Authority to make ſuch Acts to be obſerved  
here. Neither does their Declarutions to, the  
Commiſſioners that ſuch Laws as appeared to be  
againſt the Act of Navigation were repealed, prove  
their Conceſſion of the Authority of Parliament,  
by any means ſo much as their making Proviſion  
  
  
this Province, by a deliberate and ſolema Act or  
Law of their own, proves the contrary,  
  
You tell us, that the Government four or  
five Years before the Charter was vacated more  
explicitly,“ that is than by a Converſation with  
the Commiſſoners, ** acknowledged the Autho-  
rity of Parliament, and voted that their Gover-  
nor ſhould take the Oath required of him faith-  
fully to do and pertorm all Matters and Things  
enjoined him by the Acts of Trade.” But does  
this, may it pleaſe your Excellency, ſhow their  
explicit Acknowledgment of the Authority of  
Parliament? Does it not rather ſhow directly  
the contrary : For, what need could there be  
for their Vote orAuthority to require him to take  
the Oath already required of him by the Act of  
Parliament, unleſs both he and they judged that  
an Act of Parliament was not of Force ſufficient  
  
to  
  
[ 107 }  
  
to bind him to take ſuch Oath ? We do not de-  
ny, but on the contrary are fully perſuaded that  
your Excellency&#x27;s Principles in Government are  
ſtill of the ſame with what they appear to be in  
the Hiſtory ; for you there ſay, that © the pafſ&lt;  
ing this Law plainly ſhows the wrong Senſe they  
had of the Relation they ſtood in to England.”  
But we are from hence convinced that your Ex-  
cellency, when you wrote the Hiſtory was of  
our Mind in this Refpe&amp;, that our Anceſtors in  
paſſing the Law diſcovered their Opinion that  
they were without the Juriſdiction of Parliament:  
For it was upon this Principle alone that they  
ſhewed the wrong Senſe they had in your Excel-  
lency&#x27;s Opinion, of the Relation they ſtood in  
to England. |  
  
Tour Excellency in your ſecond Speech con-  
deſcends to point out to us the Acts and Doings  
of the General Aſſembly which relates to Acts  
of Parliament, which you think . demonſtrates  
that they have been acknowledged by the Aſſem-  
bly or ſubmitted to by the People:“ Neither of  
which in our Opinion ſhows that it was theSenfe  
of the Nation, and our Predeceſſors when they

[ 108 }  
  
Time to Time,” and finally * the Ebabliſhment  
of the Form which every one of us has complied  
with, as the Charter in expreſs Terms requires  
and makes our Duty.” We do not know that  
it has ever been a Point in Diſpute whether the  
_ Kings of England were ipſo facto Kings in and  
over this Colony or Province, The Compact  
was made between King Charles the Firſt, his  
| Heirs and Succeſſors, and the Governor and  
Company, their Heirs and Succeſſors. It is eaſy  
upon this Principle to account for the Acknow-  
ledgment of and Submiſſion to King William and  
Queen Mary as Succeſſors of Charles the Firſt,  
in the Room of King james: Beſides it is to  
be confidered, that the People in the Colony  
as well as in England had ſuffered under the  
T&#x27;rxant James, by which he had alike for-  
feited his Right to reign over both. There had  
been a Revolution here as well as iv England.  
The Eyes of the People here were upon William  
and Mary, and the News of their being pro-  
claimed in England was as your Excellency&#x27;s  
Hiltory. tells us, © the moſt joyful News ever  
received in New-Englan!” And if they were  
not ploctaimed here “ by virtue of an Act of  
the Colony.“ it was, as we think may be con-  
cluded from the Tenar of your Hiſtory, with  
the general or univerfal Conſent of the People  
as apparently as if “ ſuch Act had paſſed.” It  
is Cinſent alone, that makes any human Laws binds  
ing; and as a lcarned Author obferves, a purely  
voluntary Submiſſion to an Act, becauſe it is  
bighly in our Favor and for our Benefit, is in  
all Equity and Juſtice to be de. med as not at all  
proceeding from the Right we include in the  
| Levgillators,  
  
[ 109 ]  
Legiſlators, that they thereby obtain an Autlority  
  
over us, and that ever hereafter we mult obey  
them of Duty. We would obſerve that one of  
the firſt Acts of the General Aſſembly of this  
Province ſince the prefent Charter, was an AQ  
requiring the taking the Oaths mentioned in an  
Act of Parliament, to which you refer us: For  
what Purpoſe was this Act of the Aſſembly paſſed,  
if it was the Senſe of the Legiflators that the  
Act of Parliament was in Force in the Province.  
And at the ſame Time another Act was made for  
the Eſtabliſnment of other Oaths neceſſary to be  
taken; both which Acts have the Royal Sunction,  
and are now in Force. Your Excellency ſays,  
that when the Colony applicd to King William  
for a ſecond Charter, they knew the Oath the  
King had raken, which was to govern them ac-  
cording to the Statutes in Parliament, and  
(which your Excellency here omits) % Laws  
and Cuſtoms of the ſame. By the Laws and  
Cuſtoms of Parliament, the People of England  
freely debate and conſent to fuch Statutes as are  
made by themſelves or their choſen Repreſenta-  
tives. This is a Law or Cuſtom which all Man-  
kind may juſtly challenge as their zaSerent Right,  
According to this Law the King has an undoubted  
Right to govern us. Your Excellency upon  
Recollection ſurely will not infer from hence,  
that it was the Senſe of our Predecefſors that  
there was to remain a Supremacy in the Enplith  
Parliament, or a full Power and Authority to  
make Laws binding upon us in all Caſes whatever,  
in that Parliament where we cannot debate and  
deliberate upon the Neceſſity or Expediency of  
any Law, and conſequently without our Conſent,  
  
  
[ 110 ]  
  
and as it may probably happen deſtructive of the  
firſt Law of Society, the Good of the Whole.  
You tell us that „after the Aſſumption of all  
the Powers of Government, by Virtue of the  
new Charter, an Act paſſed for the reviving for  
a limited Time all the local Laws of the Maſſa-  
chuſetts-Bay and New-Plymouth reſpectively,  
not repugnant to the Laws of England. And at  
the ſame Seſſion an AR paſſed eſtabliſhing Naval  
Officers, that all undue Trading contrary to an  
Act of Parliament—may be prevented.” Among  
the Acts that were then revived we may reaſon-  
ably ſuppoſe was that whereby Proviſion was  
made to give Force to this AQ of Parliament in  
the Province. The Eſtabliſhment thereof of the  
Naval Officers was to aid the Execution of an  
Act of Parliament for the Obſervance of which  
  
  
Proviſion after free Debates with their own Con-  
ſent and by their own Act.  
  
The Act of Parliament paſſed in 174, for  
putting an End to ſeveral unwarrantableSchemes,  
mentioned by your Excellency, was deſigned for  
the general Good, and if the Validity of it was  
not diſputed, it cannot be urged as a Conceſſion  
of the 8 Authority, to make Laws binding  
on us in all Ca es whatever : But if the Deſign of  
it was for the general Benefit of the Province, it  
was in one Reſpett at leaſt greatly complained  
of by the Perſons more immediately affected by  
it; and to remedy the Inconvenience, the Le-  
giſlative of this Province paſs&#x27;d an Act, directly  
militating with it. Which is the ſtrongeſt evi-  
  
dence, that altho&#x27; they may have ſubmitt*d {ib

Your Excellency has not thought proper to  
attempt to confute the Reaſoning of a learned  
Writer on the Laws of Nature and Nations, quo-  
ted by us on this Oceaſion, to ſhew that the Au-  
thority of the Legiſlature does not extend fo far  
as the Fundamentals of the Conſtitution. We  
are unhappy in not having your Remarks upon  
the Reaſoning of that great Man; and until it is  
confuted, we ſhall remain of the Opinion, that  
the Fundamentals of the Conſtitution being ex-  
cepted from the Commiſſion of the Legiſlators,  
none of the Acts or Doings of the General Aſ-  
ſembly, however deliberate and ſolemn, could  
avail to change them, if the People have not ia  
very expreſs &#x27;Ferms given them the Power to do  
it; and that much Jeſs ought their Acts and Do-  
ings however numerous, which barely refer to  
Acts of Parliament made exprefly to relate to  
us, to be taken as an Acknowledgment” that we  
are ſubje&amp; to the Supreme Authority of Parlias  
ment,  
  
We ſhall ſum up our own ſentiments in the  
Words of that learned Writer Mr. Hooker, in  
his Eccleſiaſtical Policy, as quoted by Mr. Locke,  
« The lawful Power of making Laws to com-  
mand whole political Societies of Men, belong-  
ing fo properly to the ſame intire Societies, that  
for any Prince or Potentate of what Kind ſoever,

expreſs Comm ſſion immediately and perſonally  
  
  
Laws therefore they are not which publick p-  
robatton hath net made ſo, for Laus human  
of what Kind ſoever are available by Conſent.”  
Since Men naturally have no full and perfect  
Power to command whole politick Multitudes  
of Men, therefore, utterly without our Conſent  
we could in ſuch Sort be at no Man&#x27;s Command-  
ment living. And to be commanded we do not  
conſent, when that Society whereof we be aPart,  
hath at any Time before conſented.” We think  
your Excellency has not proved, either that the  
Colony is a Part of the politick Society of Eng-  
Jand, or that it has ever conſented that the Par-  
Hament of England or Great Britain ſhould make  
Laws binding upon us in all Caſes whatever,  
whether made expreſſy to refer to us or not.  
  
We cannot help before we conelude, ex preſſing  
our great Concern, that your Excellency has  
thus repeatedly, in a Manner inſiſted upon our  
free Sentiments on Matters of ſo delicate a Na-  
ture, and weighty Importance. The Queſtion  
2ppears to us to be no other, than Whether we  
are the Subjects of abſolute unlimitted Power, or  
of a free Government formed on the Principles  
of the Englith Conſtitution. If your Excellen-  
cy&#x27;s Doctrine be true the People of this Province  
hold their Lands „f the Crown and People of  
England, and their Lives, Liberties and Proper-  
ties are at their Diſpoſal ; and that even b  
Compact and their own Conſent. They are ſub—

another People, in whoſe Legiſlative they have  
no Voice or Intereſt. They are indeed ſaid to  
have a Conſtitution and a Legiſlative of their  
own, but your Excellency has explained it into  
a mere Phantom; limitted, controuled, ſuper-  
ceded and nullified at the Will of another, Is  
this the Conſtitution which ſo charmed our An-  
ceſtors, that as your Excellency has informed us,  
they kept a Day of ſolemn Thankſgiving te Al-  
mighty God when they received it? And were  
they Men of ſo liitle Diſcernment, ſuchChildren  
in Underſtanding, as to pleaſe themſelves with  
the Imagination that they were bleſſed with the  
ſame Rights and Liberties which natural born  
Subjects in England enjoyed, when at the ſame  
Time they had tully conſented to be ruled and  
ordered by a Legiſlative a Thouſand Leagues  
diſtant from them, which cannot be ſuppoſed to  
be ſufficiently acquainted with their Circumſtan-  
ces, if concerned for their Intereſt, and in which  
they cannot be in any Senſe repreſented

boston.  
On Turfday tail the H &gt;ufc nf Rcpre&#x27;entauvcs  
ord red tne following MESSAGE to d c  
Governo , and yesterday the Lme was de­  
livered to his Excel ency, in the Council-  
Ctum &#x27;Cr, by Mr. Hancock, Mg Gorham,  
• Mr. Full r, Mr. Greenleaf, Mr.  
Mr. Fhil ips, Mr. Nye, Mr. Brown of W a­  
tertown, and Mg Gardner.  
Mat it pfeafe your  
your speech at the open­  
ing of the present session,  
your Excellency exprefied  
vour difpeafu.e at feme  
la’e proceedings of the  
town of Button and other  
principal towns «« tbe province. And in  
another speech to bo h hcufea, we have  
your repeated exceptions at the PfO  
ceedings as being “ unwarrantable,  
of *• a dangerous nature and tendency,  
against which you thought yourfe f bound  
tn call upon us to join with vnu in bearing  
a proper testimony.” 1 his house have not  
difeovered any principles advanced by the  
town of Boston ihat are unwarrantable by  
the constitution, nnr does it appear to us  
that they have “ invited every other town  
and diftufl in the province to adopt” their  
pri- ciples. We are fully convinced that it  
is our duty to bear our teftimooy againit  
•• innovations of a dangerous nature and  
tendency.” Bui it is dearly our opinion that  
it i‘*he indiTputable light cf ail, or any of his  
Majeftv’s fubjeds, in this province regularly  
and orderly to meet together to hate the  
grievances they labour under, and to propose  
a .d unite in such constitutional mealures as  
they (hall judge neceffaty or proper to ob­  
tain .edrefs I his right has been frequent­  
b xercifed by his Mt jetty’s fubjecEts within  
the rea’-m; and we do not recollect an in  
fiance, since the happy revolution, when  
the two houles of parliament have been cal  
led upon to difcountenancc or bear their tef­  
timmy against it, in a Ipeech from the  
throne.  
Your Excellency is pleased to take, no­  
tice of fnmc th ugs which we “ allcdge” in  
our answer to your firft speech; and the  
obfe vation you make, we mutt confifs, is  
is natural and as undeniably true, as any  
One that could have been made ; that “if  
oui foundation (hou’.d fail us in every part of  
it&#x27; the fabrick we have raised upon it, mutt  
certamiv fall”. You think this foundation  
wi!‘ fail u&gt; ; but we wi(h your Excellency  
had condeicended to a conlideration of what  
we hnt “ adduced in support of our  
principles” We mght then perhaps have  
had fume things offered for our conviction  
more than bare affirmations; which, we  
mutt beg to be excused if we fay, are far  
from being Efficient, though they come  
w’th your Excellency’s authority, for which  
however we have a due regard.  
Your Excellency fays, that “ as Eng­  
lift) fubjeds, and agreeable to the dcCtrine  
of the feudal tenure all our lands are held  
mediately or immediately of the crown.”  
We trust your Excellency does not mean to  
introduce the feudal fyflem in its peiftcli  
on ; which to use the words of one of our  
greatett historians, was ** a state of perpe  
tual war, anarchy and confufion ; calculat­  
ed fulcly for defence against the assaults of  
any foreign power, but in its provision for  
the interior order and tranquility of society  
extremely defective.” •* A constitution so  
contradictory to all the principles that go­  
vern mankind could never be brought about  
but by foreign conquest or native ufui nation  
.And a very celebrated writer calls it “ that  
molt iniquitous and ablurd form cf govern­  
ment by which human nature was so (hame­  
fully degraded.” This system of iniquity,  
by a strange kind of fatality, “ (hough ori­  
gin cily fuimcd for. an encampment and for  
nii itary pur poles only, spread over a great  
pan of Europeand to serve the purposes  
of &gt;ppreffi m and tyranny “ was adopted by  
piioces and wrought into their civil confti­  
tjlions;” and aided oy the canon law, cal­  
c dated by the R &gt;man Pontiff, to exalt him­  
fc&#x27;f above all that is called Gud, it prevailed  
,to the almost utter extinction of knowledge,;  
virtue, rrbgion and liberty from th t  
part of the eai&#x27;h. But from the lime of  
the reformation, in proportion as knowledge  
which ihen darted its rays upon the benight­  
ed world, increased and spread among rhe  
peop’e, tney grew impatient under thi  
heavy yoke; and the moti vinuoua and fen­  
fii e amo‘g them, to whole ftedfaftnris w  
ir this titiant age and climax are greatly  
i cbted, wc.e derermned togetricot it;  
ard though they hsue n» grea’ meafu’e fb­  
c d its power a 1 induanc in Ln? and,  
ih-v h.ve ncvcr c; totally eradicated its  
pr.i.cipies.  
  
U &gt;on the e pr rcip’es the King cUtmev  
an absolute right to and a perfect ettate in ah  
the lands Within his dominions; but how  
he came by ibis absolute right and peifeit  
estate is a myttery which we have never seen  
i unravelled, nor is it our bufmefs or design  
lat present to enquire. He granted parts or  
parcels of it to his friends the great men,  
and they granted letter parcels to their te­  
nants : All therefore derived their right and  
I held their lands upon these principles, me­  
&#x27; diately or immediately of the King ; which  
Mr Blackstone, however caHs “ in reality  
a mere fiction or our Eng&#x27;ilh tenures.  
By what right in nature and reason the  
. chriftian princes in Europe claimed the lands  
of heathen people, upon a difeovery made  
by any of their futy ds, is equally mysteri­  
ous: Such however was the do&amp;rine uni­  
-1 vcrfaPy prevailing when the lands in Arne­  
! rica were difeovered ; but as the people of  
England upon those princip&#x27;es held all the  
lands they piffeftcd by grants from thf King,  
and the King had never granted the lands  
in America to them, it is certain they could  
have no fort of claim to them : Upon the  
principles advanced,the lordship and domini­  
on, like that of the lands in England, was  
in the King (olely; and a right from thence  
accrued to hihn of difpoling such terricones,  
under such tenure and for such services to be  
performed, as the King or Lord thought pro­  
per. But how the grantees become lubjidls  
of England, that is the fupremc authority  
of the parliament, your Excellency has not  
explained to us. We conceive that upon the  
feudal princip&#x27;es all power is in the King ;  
they afturd us no idea of parliament. “ The  
Lord was in early times the legijlator and  
judge over all his feudatories,” fays judge  
B ackttone. By the struggles for liberty in  
England from the days cf King John to the  
lalt happy revolution, the conttitution has  
gradually been changing for thebeter; and  
upon ihe more rational princip’es that all men  
by natu c ate in a state of equally in rcfptd  
of jurildiction and dominion, power in Eng­  
land has been more equally divided. And :  
thus also in America, though we hold our  
lands agreeable to the feudal principles cf  
the King, yet our piedeceflLrs wifely took  
care to enter into compact with the King,  
that power here should also be equally divid­  
ed ; agreeable to the original fundamental  
princip cs of the Eng&#x27;ifh constitution, Ze­  
dared in Magna Charta, and other llW.s  
and statutes of England,made to confir m t  
Your Excellency fays, “ you can by no  
means concede to us that it is now or was  
when the plantations were fiift granted the  
prerogative of the Kings of England to con­  
ttitute a number of new governments altoge­  
ther independent of the sovereign authority  
of the Enghfh Empire.” By the feudal  
principles upon which you fay “ all the grants  
which have been made of America arc foun­  
ded” ** the conttitutions of theEmpeior have  
the force of law.” If our government be  
conliuered as meerly feudatory, we ace fub­  
jett to the King’s absolute will, and there is  
noroom for the authority of parliament, as  
ihe sovereign authority of the Bi itifh empire.  
Upon thete principles, what could hinder  
the King’s constituting a number of inde­  
pendent governments in America ? 1 hat  
King Charles the firft did a&amp;ually set up a  
government in this colony, conceding to it,  
powers of making and executing laws, with­  
out any refervatiun to the English parlia­  
ment, of authority to make futuie laws, bind­  
ing therein, is a fad, which your Excellen­  
cy has not disproved 9 you have denied it.  
Nor have you (hewn that the parliament or  
nation objected to it; from whence we have  
inferred that it was an acknowledged right.  
And we cannot conceive, why the King has  
not the lame right to alienate and dispose of  
countries acquired by the difeovery of his  
fubjedts, as he has to restore upon a trea­  
ty of peace, countries which have been ac­  
quired in war,” carried on at the charge of  
the nation ; or to “ fell or deliver up any  
part ot his dominions to a foreign prince or  
state, against the general ienfe of the nati­  
on ;” which is M an ad of power,” or prero­  
gative which yourExceUency allows. You tell  
us that, “ when any newcountr esaie difeo­  
vered by Engiifh tubjv3s, according to the  
general law and u:age of nations, they become  
part of the Jlate” ihe law of nations is,  
ot ought to be founded on the law of reason.  
It was a faying of Sir Edwin Sandu, in the  
great caie of the union of the realm of Scot­  
land with England, which is applicable to  
our present pur pole, that •* there being no  
precedent for this case in the law, the law is  
deficien: ; and the law being deficient, re­  
course is to be had to custom ; and cuttom  
beicg infufficient we mutt recur to natural  
reaion,” the greatett of all authorities, wfich  
he adds, “is the law of nations.” The opn ,  
  
uions therefore &lt;»nd dcteimimiions the  
greatest sanes and judges ot the law, in the  
Exchequer chamber ought not to be consi­  
dered asdccilveor binding in our present  
controversy with your Excellency, any fur­  
ther than they are consonant to natural ria­  
/on. If however we were to recur to such  
opinions and determinations we ihou&#x27;d find  
many great authorities in our favour,to (hew  
that the statutes of England are not binding  
on those who arc not repiefemed in Parlia  
ment there. The opinion of Lord Coke  
that Ireland was bound by statutes of E g­  
land wherein they were named, if compared  
with his other writings appears manifettly to  
be grounded upon a fuppvfitron that Leland  
had by an act &lt;&gt;f their own, in the reign of  
King John contented to be thus bound; and  
upon any othei supp- fition this opinion wou d  
be against reason ; for conjtnt only giv s hu­  
man laws their force. We big eave upon  
what your Excellency has obfeivcd of the  
colony becoming a part of the state, to sub­  
join the opinions of several learned civilians,  
as quoted by a very able lawyer in this coun­  
try. “ Colonies, fays Puffcndorf, are fettled  
in d fferent methods. For either the co o­  
ny continue! a part of the common wealth it  
was sent out from ; or else is obliged to  
pay a dutiful regard to the mother common  
wealth, and to be in readinefsto defend and  
vindicate its honour and so is united by a  
fort of unequal confederacy ; or lastly, is e­  
reeled into a separate common-wealth and as  
futnes the fame rights with the state it de­  
cended from.” And King I udius, as quo­  
ted by the fame learned author from Giuiius  
fays we look upon it to be neither tiuih  
nor justice that mother cities ought of neces­  
sity and by the law nf nature to rule over the  
colonies.  
Your Excellency has misinterpreted what  
we have fai ’, ’hat no “ country by the com­  
mon law, wasfu jest io the laws or the par­  
liament but the sea m of England,’ and are  
pleased to tell us we have expreflL-d our­  
selves *• iruaudoufl!.&quot; We beg leave to recite  
the words of the Judges of England, in the  
before mentioned caie to our purpose. “ If  
a King go out of England with a company of  
h&gt;s (ervants, allegiance rcmameih among  
his fubjetfis and lervants, although he be out  
of his realm whereto his laws are confined.&quot; We  
dkbnqt mean to fay, as your Excellency  
woutvKppofe, that “ the common law pre  
fcrrbfel&#x27;lunits to the extent of the leg fl &gt;tive  
though we (hall alwavs ami.u it to  
be true of the law of reason and natural equi­  
ty. Your Excellency thinks you have made  
it appear, “ that the colony of. Maffachu  
fctts -Bay isholden as feudatory of the impe­  
rial crown of England”*and therefore you  
fay “ to use the words of a very great au­  
thority in a case in Jome refpefls analogous to  
it” “ being feudatory it neceflarily follows  
that it is under the government of the king’s  
laws.” Your Excellency has not named  
this authority, but we conceive his rmaning  
must be, that being feudatory, it is under the  
government of ibeKmg’s laws abfolutcly ; for  
as we have before said the feudal system ad­  
mits of no idea of the authority of parlia­  
ment: And this would have been the case of  
the colony but for the compad with the  
King in the charier.  
  
Your Excellency fays, that •• Persons thus  
holding under the Crown of England, remain or  
btcome fubjefts of England by which we sup­  
pose your Excellency to mean, fuljeft to tbe su­  
preme tu honty of parliament “ to all intents  
and purpuf s as fully as if any of the royal ma­  
nors, &amp;c. wi hin the realm had been granted to  
them upon the like tenure ” We apprehend,with  
submission, you- Excellency is mistaken in fup­  
pofiog that our allegiance is due to the crown of  
England. Every man (wears allegiance for him­  
(?lf, to his own king in his natural person. “E­  
---very fubjeft is presumed by law to be (worn to  
the King. »hich is to his natural peifon,” fays  
Lord Cuke. Rep on Caivtnt Cate “ The al­  
legiance is due to his natural b dy.” And he  
fays, “ In the eign of Edward IL the Spencers  
the father and (he fon.to cover the (reason hatch­  
ed in (heir hearts, invented this damnable and  
damned opinion, that Htmage and oath of alle­  
giance was more by reason ot the King&#x27;s crown,  
that is of cis politic capacity, than by re .(on of  
the person of the King ; upon which opinion  
they inferred execrable and detestable confe­  
quentr.” The judges of England, allbut one, in  
the case of the union between Scotland ard Eng  
lard, dec&#x27;aredthat&quot; . legiance so loweth the na­  
tural person not the politic,” and “ to prove the  
a legiance to be tied to the bidy natural of the  
King and not to the body politic,the Lo d Coke  
cited the ohrafes of divers fta ute*, mentioning  
cur xaturalhege fove eign ” It then the hom­  
age and allegiance is not to the body politic of  
the King, then it is not to him as the head or  
any part of that legislative authority, which your  
Excellency fays, ** is equally ex.er.five with the  
authority ot the crown throughout every part of  
the dominions,” and your Excellency&#x27;s obfer­  
varion thereupon must fail. Tbe fime judges  
the allegiance of a fubjeft to the Kings  
  
Eng’ar.J ; wh’cli is perf Aly recerc ■»i&gt;:e

your Excellency&#x27;s principles ao( eir» to us to be  
«n abfuHity. The judge-, fpesking of • Lb­

confequer ti; out ■ f the lealm or hounds of the  
Kli giem of Eng&#x27;snd, were in fahjett’on o the

how the Ki g acquired a title to this country iR  
his natural capacity, or fep.rate from his rela­  
tion to his subj fts, which we confefs yet we  
conceive it will be equally difficult for your Ex­  
cellency to show huw the body politic and nati­  
on of England acquired it. Our ancefton fup­  
pufed it was acquired by neither; A d therefore  
they dicl.icd as we have before quoted from  
your History, that laving their aftual purchase  
frem the natives of the foil, the dominion, the  
lordfhio and foveteignty, thev had in the fight  
of G d and man,no right and title to what they  
poflefled How much clearer then in natural  
reaLn ard equity must our title be, who hold  
eHates dea ly purchased at the expence of our  
own as well as our auceftors labour.ar.d cefend­  
ed by them whhtreafure and blood !  
  
Your Excellency has been pie Jed tocorfim rather  
than deny or confute a piece ofhiflo y which ycu  
fay w e took from an anonymous pamphlet,ard by  
j which you fear we have b:en too easily milled,  
; It may be gathered from your own declaration  
, and other authorities bcfi ei the anonymous  
। pamphlet, that the House of Commons took ex­  
ception, not at the King’s having made an ab­  
folutc grant of the terri ory but at the claim of  
an cxclufive right to the filhe-y on the banks  
and sea coafh, by virtue ol the patent. At thia  
you fay “ the Htufe of Commons was alarmed  
and a bill was brought in for al owing a free  
fifhery.&quot; And upon this cccdion year Excellen­  
cy allows, that •• one of the Secretaries of Pate  
declared that the plantations were not annexed  
to the crown, and fd were not within the jurif­  
diflion of parliament.” If we should concede  
to what your Excellency supposes might possi­  
bly, er •• perhaps” be the case, that the Secre­  
tary made this deda-atha “ as his own opin­  
ion,” the even, (h &#x27;wed that it was the opinion  
of the King too; for it is not to be accounted for  
upon any other principle, that he would have I  
denied his royal assent to a bll so med for no  
other pu p fe but to grant his fibje&amp;a in Eng­  
land t if privilege of fifhiog on the sea coasts in  
America. The account published by Sir Fer­  
dinando Gorges himfelf, nf the proceedings of  
parliament •• tbit iteafian, your Excellency  
thinks “ will remove all douu t ofthefenfe of the  
  
nation and of the patentees of thia parent cr  
charter in 1620 ” This narrative you Gy has  
all the appearance of truth anti fincen y, which  
we do not deny : And to us it “ carries thin  
convi&amp;iin with it,” that “ wha&#x27; was ctj:£hd’*  
in parliament was, the exdufive claim of fiih­  
ing only: Hia imagining that he had fatisfi­  
ed the house, after diverse attendances, that  
the planting a cob ny was of much more conse­  
quence than a Simple diitr&amp;rfy twft es f/hingt  
it fuficient for our convtdica. We know that  
the nation was at that time alarmed with sppre­  
herfions of monopolies ; and if the patent cf  
New England was presented by the two houfea  
as a grievance, it did not Ihiw, as ynur Eery! .  
lency fuppofcs, ** the fenfc they then had of  
their suthority over this new acquired territory,**  
but only their fenle as die grievance of a monopo­  
ly of tae lea.

, We are happy tj hear year txce&#x27;fency fay,  
that car remarks upon end conflrufthn of the  
wo de repugnant to tbt /am of England are  
much the fame with those of the council.” It  
serves to co» firm ua in our opinicn, and in  
what we take to be the m &gt;ft important matter of  
difference between your Excellency and the two  
houfec. As er fayir g that the ft.tute of 7th and  
Sth of William and Mary favours the construc­  
tion of the worda ai intending such laws us Eng­  
land at tie mace more immediately to erf cd  
hs, you tell ut that “ the provi-ce Agent Mr.  
Dummer, io hit much applauded deicnee fays,  
th-1 then a law of the plantation may be laid to  
be repugnant to a law made in Great B i’ain  
when it flatly con trad ids it so far at the law  
made there mentions aad relates to the plantati­  
ons.” This it plain and obvious to common  
sense ; and therefore cannot be denied. But il  
your Excellency will read a page or two fur  
tner in that excellent defence yon will fee that  
he mentions this as the sense of the phrase as  
taken from an ad of parliament, rather than  
as the sense he would chufe himfelf to put up­  
on it, and he expressly designs to (hew in vin­  
dicationof the chapter that in that sense of the  
words, there never was a law made in the  
plantations repugnant to the laws • f Great-  
Britain. He giver ano her ernftrudiun much  
mote likely 10 be the true inten of the words,  
namely, •&#x27; that the patentees (hall n6t prefutne  
under colour of their particular charters to  
make any Laws inconfifitnt with the great char  
ter and other lawr of England by which the liver  
libtrtiet and froptrutt of Englijbmtn are fettered”  
This is the feme in which our ancestors un­  
derflood the words and therefore they were  
  
unwilling to conform to the ads of trade, aou  
disregarded them till they made provifi m to  
•.give them force in the colony by a law of  
their own ; faying that “ the laws of England  
did not re-ch America,” and “ those ads were  
an invasion of their rights, liberties and pro­  
perties” because they were not •• reprefemdd  
in parliament.” The right of being governed  
only by laws which were made by persons in  
whole eledion they bad a voice, they looked  
upon as the foundation of liberties,  
By the compad with the King tn the charter  
they were to be aa fee in America, as they  
-would have been if they had remained within  
the realm, and therefore they freely affeited  
that they “ were to be governed by law# made  
by themfelvea and by officers cho fen by them­  
selves.” Mr Dummer fays •* it seems reafon­  
ab&#x27;e enough to think that the crown,” and he  
might have added our ancestors, ii tended by  
  
this injuvftion to provide for all its fubjetts  
that they might not be oppressed by arbitrary  
power—but—being ftili tebjeds, they should  
be protected by the fame mild laws, ’&quot;d enjoy  
the fame happy government as if they conti­  
nued within the realm. And oonfidcring the  
words of the charter in this light he looks up­  
on them as designed to be a knee against op­  
preflion and defpotick power. But the con­  
ftrudion which your Excellency puts upon the  
words reduces us to a Rate of vaff.llage, and  
exposes us to oppreflion and defpotick power  
whenever a parliament (hall fee fit to make  
laws for that purpole and put them in execution.  
We flatter ourselves that from the la ge ex­  
itrafts we have made from your Excellency’s  
hiflory of the colony, it appears evidently that  
under both charters, it hath been the fetife of  
the people and of the government, that they  
were not under the juiifdidion of Parliament.  
We pray you again to recur to those quotati­  
ons and our observations upon them : And  
we wish to have your Excellency’s judicious  
remarks. When we adduced that htftory to  
prove that the sentiments of private persons  
of influence four or five years after the reiter­  
ation were very different from what your Ex­  
cellency apprehended them to be when you  
delivered your fpecch, you teem to concede to  
it by telling us14 it was, ar you tike it, from  
the principlet imbibed in th fe times of anarchy  
(preceding the restoration) that they disputed  
the authority of parliament.” But you add  
«« the government would not venture to dsf­  
pute it.” We find in the fame hirtory a quo­  
tation from a letter of Mr. Stoughton dated fe­  
veateen years after the reiteration, mention­  
ing 44 the country’s not taking notice of the  
ads qf navigation ft ob/erve them. Knd it was  
as we take it, after that time that the govern*  
  
ment declared in a letter to their agent* that  
thev had not submitted to them; and they ♦* ven­  
tured to dispute” the jorifdiflion,afterting that  
they apprehended the ad* to be an invasion ot  
the right*, hbertie* and propei tie* of the fub­  
jed* ot hi* majefly in the colony, they not  
reprejented in parliament ; and that the law* of  
England did not reach America. It very little  
gvi *in proof, that they conceded to the fu­  
premeauthohy of parliament, their telling  
thecommiiTiOGcr* “ that the ad of navigation

hid now that the revenue ad* are observed by  
some of the people of thia province, but it  
cannot be said that the government and peo­  
pie of thia province, have conceded that the  
parliament had authority to make such ads to  
be observed here Ne ther doe* their declar­

their making provision for the giving force to  
an ad of p-rliameui wi.hm this pioviece, by  
  
a lelib late and iblcmn ad or law of their own  
proves the contrary. You te l us th;t 14 the  
government four or fi*e year before the char­

by a converfstton with the commiflincrs,  
“ acknowledged the authority of parliament,  
and voted that their Governor (hould take the

the ads of trade.” But does this may it ।  
plesfe your Excellency, (he v their explicit  
acknowledgment of the authority of parlta

contrary ? For what need coutd there be for  
their vote or authoiity to require him &#x27;o take  
the oath already required of him by the ad of  
patiiarD&#x27; nr, unkfs bo.h he and they judged  
th it an ad of parliament was not of force (us- ;

Your Excellency seems chiefly to rrly up- |  
on our aneeftors after the revolution, pro­  
claiming King William and Queen M try in  
the roonr us K&#x27;Ug James “ and taking the  
oathi to chsm”—-** the alteration of the form  
of oaths from time to time,” and finally “ the  
ettublifliment ot ihc fond which every one of  
us har complied with a* rhe charter in exprets  
terms requires and makes oyr duty.” W&lt; do  
upt know that it has ever been a point&#x27; in dif­  
piice, whether the Kings of England were ip­  
fp fadA K oga in and otter this colony or pro*  
r vince. The compad was made between King  
Charles the fir it. his heirs aud fdcceflax-rtnf  
theGoveri or and company their heirsXdd fuc­  
ceftbrs. It is easy upon this pi incipOel W hfcL  
ccouni for the acknowledgment of Mad. Tub- .  
mission to King William and Queen  
fuc eflors of Charles the fi.it, in the room  
  
of King James. Besides it is to be conftdered,  
that the people in tne co&#x27;ony as well as inEng­  
kud had luffered under t t TYr ANTjamc*,by  
which he had alike forfeited his right to reign  
over both. There had been a revolution here  
as well as in Englan I. The eyes of the peo­  
ple heie were upon William and Mary and  
ths news of their being pioclaimed in England  
was, as your Excellency’s hiltory tells us,  
44 the most joyful news ever ieceived in New-  
E igl a- d.” And if they werenot proclaimed here  
•• oy vin ue of an act of the colony,”it wu.aswe  
thi k may be concluded from the tenor of your  
hillory, with the general or umverfai content  
of the people as apparently as if “ fu*ch ad  
had paired.” 1c i» tonftni alone that makes any  
human laws bindirg, and as a learned author  
observes a purely &#x27;voluntary fubmifion to an  
ad, becaute it is highly in our favour and for  
our ben fit is in ail cqui y and jullice to be  
deemed as not at all proceeding from th: right  
we include in tne legifhto S, that they there­  
by obtain an authority over us, and that ever  
hereafter we ruuit obey them of duty. We  
would oilervc, that one of the firtt ads of the  
  
General afembly of thia province fioce the pre­  
fenc charier, was an ad requiring the taking the  
oith* mentioned in th. ad of parliament to  
which &gt;ou refer u*; For what purpose was  
thia ad of the aftembly p.fLd, if i&lt; was the  
fenfc ot thh Lgrllature, the *d of parlia­  
ment was in force in the province ? And at  
t e fame time another ad was made for thee­  
ftabhlhment of O&#x27;her oaths recefTary to be  
taken ; bo&lt;h which ad* have the royal fandi­  
on, and are now in fo&lt;ce. Your Excellency  
(ayn that when the colony applied to King  
William for a iecond chai ter, they knew the  
orta the King had taken, which was to govern  
them according to the rtatut&gt;* :n parlnment

nut thought proper to attempt to confute the  
reafqoing of a learned writer on the laws of  
  
nature and nations, quoted by ua on this oc­  
cafiin,&#x27; to (hew that the authority of the legif-  
Uturc doet not extend so fur as the fundamen­  
tals of. ihe constitution,, Wc arc unhappy in  
n t having your remarks upon the leafomng of  
that great man ; and until it is confuted we  
shall remain of the opinion, that the funda­  
mentab of the conflitution being excepted from  
the cornmiffion of the legislators, none of the  
ads end doings of the General Aflembly how­  
ever deliberate and folemi,’ could avail to  
change them,&#x27; if the people have not in very  
exprefe terms given them the power to do it;  
and tkatmuch less ought tlr’ nd a and doings,  
however numerous,&#x27; which refer to acts  
of parliament made expressly to relate to u»,  
to b: taken aa an acknowledgment that we are  
Tibjed to the supreme authority of parliament.  
  
rpxwe mamum up our lennments in the  
wrjds of that learned writer Mr. Hooker, in  
A/ecctefntftical policy as quoted byMr.Loike.  
The lawful power of nuking laws to com­  
mand whole politic focietiesof men, belo iging  
so properly to the fame intire focietiv&gt;,that for  
any prince or potentate of m hat kind soever,  
to exercise the fame of himtelf, and not from  
express ccmmiflinn immediately and perten­  
ally received from God, is no better than mere  
tyranny. Laws therefore they are not which  
public approbation hath not made so For  
44 laws human of what kind kever are avail­  
able by c-mfent.” 44 Since men naturally  
have nd full a«.d perfed power to command  
whole politic multitudes ot men, therefore ut­  
terly without our content we could in tech  
fort be at no man’s commandment living.  
And to be commanded we do content, when  
that society whereof we be a part hath at any  
time before con fen ted.” We think your Ex­  
cellency has not proved, either that this co­  
lony is a part of the politic society of England,  
or that it has ever consented that the parlia­  
ment of England orGreat-Britaiu should make  
laws binding upon us io all cates whatever,  
whether made expreflly to refer to us or not.  
We cannot belo before we conclude, ex-  
  
preHing our great Concern that your Excellen­  
cy ha* thus repeatedly in a manner infilled  
upon our free sentiments on matter* of so de­  
licate a nature and weighty importance.  
The quell ion appear* to u* to be no other,  
than whether we are the fubj-.&#x27;d* of absolute  
unlimited power,or of a free give&#x27;nmenc form­  
ed on the principle* of the English conftiu i m.  
If your Excellency’* dod ine be true, the pea­  
pie cf thi* province hold their land* of the  
crown and people of England, and their live*  
hbertie* and proper res me at their difpofai; and  
th*t even by compact and their own consent.  
They are fobjed to the king a* the head aberi­  
ntpefnli, of another people, ia whole legi fl dive  
they have no voice or in erod. They are in­  
deed laid to have a conftiunon and a ieg flation  
of their own, bdt vour Excellency ha* expla n-  
  
ed it into a mere phintom, limited, controlled,  
fjpe ceded and nullified at the will of another
