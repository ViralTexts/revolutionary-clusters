ishes the Fourth dis­  
trict tax kickers is illustrated in their  
claim that one of the purposes of the  
passpge of the new charter was to in­  
crease Mayor Cleveland&#x27;s salary. The  
truth is that the charter says nothing  
whatever about the mayor&#x27;s salary,  
and Mr. Cleveland&#x27;s salary was in­  
creased—very properly—by authority  
of an act that had no relation what­  
ever to the charter.  
When County Superintendent Gan­  
non said he didn&#x27;t want that $3,000  
for the Kearney road, one of the  
Freeholders exclaimed &quot;Great Cœsar.&quot;  
He probably had in mind Marc  
Anthony&#x27;s words:—  
You all did see that on the Lupercal  
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, *  
Which he did thrice refuse

another name for Juno. If they were  
different beings, at least they held certain offices in com-  
mon, both presiding over ceremonies of purification, and  
expiatory sacrifices. Among the Roman festivals held  
in this month was one, the Feralia, in memory of the  
dead ; another, the Lupercalia, in honor of the sylvan  
god Pan, called also Lupercus,—defender from wolves.  
  
It is with the celebration of this feast that Shake-  
speare’s play of Jalias Cesar opens ; it was then that in  
the presence of the people the sovereignty he so desired  
was offered to Cesar,—  
  
“* You all did see that on the Lupercal  
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest,—  
For Brutus is an honorable man,  
So are they all, all honorable men,—  
Come I to speak in Ceesar’s funeral.  
  
He was my friend, faithful and just to me,  
But Brutus says, he was ambitious,  
And Brutus is an honorable man.  
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,  
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:  
Did this in Ceesar seem ambitious?  
When that the poor have cried, Czesar hath wept;  
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:  
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,  
And Brutus is an honorable man.  
You all did see that, on the Lupercal,  
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,  
Which he did thrice refuse. Wasthis ambition ?

In Mark Antony&#x27;s oration over the dead
