ce the Amend­  
ments.1 cannot understand how any intelligent  
Southerner can fail to see that these con­  
sequences would follow the attempt to  
disfranchise the colored race. It is equally

alienate the races and to postpone indefi­  
nitely the era of domestic peace and good  
will between the races.
