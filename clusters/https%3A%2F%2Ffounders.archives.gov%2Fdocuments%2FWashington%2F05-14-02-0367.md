othing more than  
what is absolutely necessary.  
I hope, and do expect, that you will use your best exertions in planting out  
trees—making good the hedges—Keeping the Gardens—the Lawns—and the Vineya⟨rd⟩ in order,  
with such other things as was to have been done last winter but was not then  
accomplished. And as I have desired Mr Pearce to have cuttings of the Lombardy Poplar,  
&amp; the Willows planted along the ditches at the Plantations, for hedges do not trim  
those along the Walks, or elsewhere until they are wanted for this purpose.  
I shall not close this letter without exhorting you to refrain from spiritous  
liquors—they will prove your ruin if you do not. Consider how little a drunken Man  
differs from a beast; the latter is not endowed with reason—the former deprives himself  
of it; and when that is the case acts like a brute; annoying, and disturbing every one  
around him—But this is not all—nor as it respects himself the worst of it; By degrees it  
renders a person feeble &amp; not only unable to serve others but to help himself—and  
being an act of his own he fall from a state of usefulness into contempt and at length  
suffers, if not perishes in penury &amp; want.  
Don’t let this be your case. Shew yourself more of a man, and a Christian, than to  
yield to so intolerable a vice; which cannot, I am certain (to the greatest lover of  
liquor) give more pleasure to sip in the poison (for it is no better) than the  
consequences of it in bad behaviour at the moment, &amp; the more serious evils produced  
by it afterwards, must give pain. I am—Your friend
