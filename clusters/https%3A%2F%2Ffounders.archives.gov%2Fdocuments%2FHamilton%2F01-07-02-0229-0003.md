 the Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
In obedience to the order of the House of Representatives of the ninth day of August last, requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and report on this day such further provision as may, in his opinion, be necessary for establishing the public Credit  
The said Secretary further respectfully reports  
That from a conviction (as suggested in his report No. 1 herewith presented) That a National Bank is an Institution of primary importance to the prosperous administration of the Finances, and would be of the greatest utility in the operations connected with the support of the Public Credit, his attention has been drawn to devising the plan of such an institution, upon a scale, which will intitle it to the confidence, and be likely to render it equal to the exigencies of the Public.  
Previously to entering upon the detail of this plan, he entreats the indulgence of the House, towards some preliminary reflections naturally arising out of the subject, which he hopes will be deemed, neither useless, nor out of place. Public opinion being the ultimate arbiter of every measure of Government, it can scarcely appear improper, in deference to that, to accompany the origination of any new proposition with explanations, which the superior information of those, to whom it is immediately addressed, would render superfluous.  
It is a fact well understood, that public Banks have found admission and patronage among the principal and most enlightened commercial nations. They have successively obtained in Italy, Germany, Holland, England and France, as well as in the United States. And it is a circumstance, which cannot but have considerable weight, in a candid estimate of their tendency, that after an experience of centuries, there exists not a question about their util⟨ity⟩ in the countries in which they have been so long established. Theorists and men of business unite in the acknowlegment of it.  
Trade and industry, wherever they have been tried, have been indebted to them for important aid. And Government has been repeatedly under the greatest obligations to them, in dangerous and distressing emergencies. That of the United States, as well in some of the most critical conjunctures of the late war, as since the peace, has received assistance from those established among us, with which it could not have dispensed.  
With this two fold evidence before us, it might be expected, that there would be a perfect union of opinions in their favour. Yet doubts have been entertained; jealousies and prejudices have circulated: and though the experiment is every day dissipating them, within the spheres in which effects are best known; yet there are still persons by whom they have not been intirely renounced. To give a full and accurate view of the subject would be to make a Treatise of a report; but there are certain aspects in which it may be cursorily exhibited, which may perhaps conduce to a just impression of its merits. These will involve a comparison of the advantages, with the disadvantages, real or supposed, of such institutions.  
The following are among the principal advantages of a Bank.  
First. The augmentation of the active or productive capital of a country. Gold and Silver, when they are employed merely as the instruments of exchange and alienation, have been not improperly denominated dead Stock; but when deposited in Banks, to become the basis of a paper circulation, which takes their character and place, as the signs or representatives of value, they then acquire life, or, in other words, an active and productive quality. This idea, which appears rather subtil and abstract, in a general form, may be made obvious and palpable, by entering into a few particulars. It is evident, for instance, that the money, which a merchant keeps in his chest, waiting for a favourable opportunity to employ it, produces nothing ’till that opportunity arrives. But if instead of locking it up in this manner, he either deposits it in a Bank, or invests it in the Stock of a Bank, it yields a profit, during the interval; in which he partakes, or not, according to the choice he may have made of being a depositor or a proprietor; and when any advantageous speculation offers, in order to be able to embrace it, he has only to withdraw his money, if a depositor, or if a proprietor to obtain a loan from the Bank, or to dispose of his Stock; an alternative seldom or never attended with difficulty, when the affairs of the institution are in a prosperous train. His money thus deposited or invested, is a fund, upon which himself and others can borrow to a much larger amount. It is a well established fact, that Banks in good credit can circulate a far greater sum than the actual quantum of their capital in Gold &amp; Silver. The extent of the possible excess seems indeterminate; though it has been conjecturally stated at the proportions of two and three to one. This faculty is produced in various ways. First. A great proportion of the notes, which are issued and pass current as Cash, are indefinitely suspended in circulation, from the confidence which each holder has, that he can at any moment turn them into gold and silver. Secondly, Every loan, which a Bank makes is, in its first shape, a credit given to the borrower on its books, the amount of which it stands ready to pay, either in its own notes, or in gold or silver, at his option. But, in a great number of cases, no actual payment is made in either. The Borrower frequently, by a check or order, transfers his credit to some other person, to whom he has a payment to make; who, in his turn, is as often content with a similar credit, because he is satisfied, that he can, whenever he pleases, either convert it into cash, or pass it to some other hand, as an equivalent for it. And in this manner the credit keeps circulating, performing in every stage the office of money, till it is extinguished by a discount with some person, who has a payment to make to the Bank, to an equal or greater amount. Thus large sums are lent and paid, frequently through a variety of hands, without the intervention of a single piece of coin. Thirdly, There is always a large quantity of gold and silver in the repositories of the Bank, besides its own Stock, which is placed there, with a view partly to its safe keeping and partly to the accommodation of an institution, which is itself a source of general accommodation. These deposits are of immense consequence in the operations of a Bank. Though liable to be redrawn at any moment, experience proves, that the money so much oftener changes proprietors than place, and that what is drawn out is generally so speedily replaced, as to authorise the counting upon the sums deposited, as an effective fund; which, concurring with the Stock of the Bank, enables it to extend its loans, and to answer all the demands for coin, whether in consequence of those loans, or arising from the occasional return of its notes.  
These different circumstances explain the manner, in which the ability of a bank to circulate a greater sum, than its actual capital in coin, is acquired. This however must be gradual; and must be preceded by a firm establishment of confidence; a confidence which may be bestowed on the most rational grounds; since the excess in question will always be bottomed on good security of one kind or another. This, every well conducted Bank carefully requires, before it will consent to advance either its money or its credit; and where there is an auxiliary capital (as will be the case in the plan hereafter submitted) which, together with the capital in coin, define the boundary, that shall not be exceeded by the engagements of the Bank, the security may, consistently with all the maxims of a reasonable circumspection be regarded as complete.  
The same circumstances illustrate the truth of the position, that it is one of the properties of Banks to increase the active capital of a country. This, in other words is the sum of them. The money of one individual, while he is waiting for an opportunity to employ it, by being either deposited in the Bank for safe keeping, or invested in its Stock, is in a condition to administer to the wants of others, without being put out of his own reach, when occasion presents. This yields an extra profit, arising from what is paid for the use of his money by others, when he could not himself make use of it; and keeps the money itself in a state of incessant activity. In the almost infinite vicissitudes and competitions of mercantile enterprise, there never can be danger of an intermission of demand, or that the money will remain for a moment idle in the vaults of the Bank. This additional employment given to money, and the faculty of a bank to lend and circulate a greater sum than the amount of its stock in coin are to all the purposes of trade and industry an absolute increase of capital. Purchases and undertakings, in general, can be carried on by any given sum of bank paper or credit, as effectually as by an equal sum of gold and silver. And thus by contributing to enlarge the mass of industrious and commercial enterprise, banks become nurseries of national wealth: a consequence, as satisfactorily verified by experience, as it is clearly deducible in theory.  
Secondly. Greater facility to the Government in obtaining pecuniary aids, especially in sudden emergencies. This is another and an undisputed advantage of public banks: one, which as already remarked, has been realised in signal instances, among ourselves. The reason is obvious: The capitals of a great number of individuals are, by this operation, collected to a point, and placed under one direction. The mass, formed by this union, is in a certain sense magnified by the credit attached to it: And while this mass is always ready, and can at once be put in motion, in aid of the Government, the interest of the bank to afford that aid, independent of regard to the public safety and welfare, is a sure pledge for its disposition to go as far in its compliances, as can in prudence be desired. There is in the nature of things, as will be more particularly noticed in another place, an intimate connection of interest between the government and the Bank of a Nation.  
Thirdly. The facilitating of the payment of taxes. This advantage is produced in two ways. Those who are in a situation to have access to the Bank can have the assistance of loans to answer with punctuality the public calls upon them. This accommodation has been sensibly felt in the payment of the duties heretofore laid, by those who reside where establishments of this nature exist. This however, though an extensive, is not an universal benefit. The other way, in which the effect here contemplated is produced, and in which the benefit is general, is the encreasing of the quantity of circulating medium and the quickening of circulation. The manner in which the first happens has already been traced. The last may require some illustration. When payments are to be made between different places, having an intercourse of business with each other, if there happen to be no private bills, at market, and there are no Bank notes, which have a currency in both, the consequence is, that coin must be remitted. This is attended with trouble, delay, expence and risk. If on the contrary, there are bank notes current in both places, the transmission of these by the post, or any other speedy, or convenient conveyance answers the purpose; and these again, in the alternations of demand, are frequently returned, very soon after, to the place from whence they were first sent: Whence the transportation and retransportation of the metals are obviated; and a more convenient and more expeditious medium of payment is substituted. Nor is this all. The metals, instead of being suspended from their usual functions, during this process of vibration from place to place, continue in activity, and administer still to the ordinary circulation; which of course is prevented from suffering either diminution or stagnation. These circumstances are additional causes of what, in a practical sense, or to the purposes of business, may be called greater plenty of money. And it is evident, that whatever enhances the quantity of circulating money adds to the ease, with which every industrious member of the community may acquire that portion of it, of which he stands in need; and enables him the better to pay his taxes, as well as to supply his other wants. Even where the circulation of the bank paper is not general, it must still have the same effect, though in a less degree. For whatever furnishes additional supplies to the channels of circulation, in one quarter, naturally contributes to keep the streams fuller elsewhere. This last view of the subject serves both to illustrate the position, that Banks tend to facilitate the payment of taxes; and to exemplify their utility to business of every kind, in which money is an agent.  
It would be to intrude too much on the patience of the house, to prolong the details of the advantages of Banks; especially as all those, which might still be particularized are readily to be inferred as consequences from those, which have been enumerated. Their disadvantages, real or supposed, are now to be reviewed. The most serious of the charges which have been brought against them are—  
That they serve to increase usury:  
  
That they tend to prevent other kinds of lending:  
That they furnish temptations to overtrading:  
That they afford aid to ignorant adventurers who disturb the natural and beneficial course of trade:  
That they give to bankrupt and fraudulent traders a fictitious credit, which enables them to maintain false appearances and to extend their impositions: And lastly  
That they have a tendency to banish gold and silver from the country.  
There is great reason to believe, that on a close and candid survey, it will be discovered, that these charges are either destitute of foundation; or that, as far as the evils, they suggest, have been found to exist, they have proceeded from other, or partial, or temporary causes, are not inherent in the nature and permanent tendency of such institutions; or are more than counterbalanced by opposite advantages. This survey shall be had, in the order in which the charges have been stated.  
The first of them is, that Banks serve to increase usury.  
It is a truth, which ought not to be denied, that the method of conducting business, which is essential to bank operations, has among us, in particular instances, given occasion to usurious transactions. The punctuality, in payments, which they necessarily exact has sometimes obliged those, who have adventured beyond both their capital and their credit to procure money, at any price, and consequently to resort to usurers for aid.  
But experience and practice gradually bring a cure to this evil. A general habit of punctuality among traders is the natural consequence of the necessity of observing it with the Bank; a circumstance which itself more than compensates for any occasional ill, which may have sprung from that necessity, in the particular, under consideration. As far therefore as Traders depend on each other for pecuniary supplies, they can calculate their expectations with greater certainty; and are in proportionably less danger of disappointments, which might compel them to have recourse to so pernicious an expedient, as that of borrowing at usury; the mischiefs of which, after a few examples, naturally inspire great care, in all but men of desperate circumstances, to avoid the possibility of being subjected to them. One, and not the least of the evils incident to the use of that expedient, if the fact be known or even strongly suspected, is loss of credit with the bank itself.  
The Directors of a bank too, though in order to extend its business and its popularity, in the infancy of an institution, they may be tempted to go further in accommodations, than the strict rules of prudence will warrant, grow more circumspect of course, as its affairs become better established, and as the evils of too great facility are experimentally demonstrated. They become more attentive to the situation and conduct of those, with whom they deal; they observe more narrowly their operations and pursuits; they œconomise the credit, they give to those of suspicious solidity; they refuse it to those whose career is more manifestly hazardous. In a word, in the course of practice, from the very nature of things, the interest will make it the policy of a Bank, to succour the wary and industrious; to discredit the rash and unthrifty; to discountenance both usurious lenders and usurious borrowers.  
There is a leading view, in which the tendency of banks will be seen to be, to abrige rather than to promote usury. This relates to their property of increasing the quantity and quickening the circulation of money. If it be evident, that usury will prevail or diminish, according to the proportion which the demand for borrowing bears to the quantity of money at market to be lent; whatever has the property just mentioned, whether it be in the shape of paper or of coin, by contributing to render the supply more equal to the demand, must tend to counteract the progress of usury.  
But bank-lending, it is pretended, is an impediment to other kinds of lending; which, by confining the resource of borrowing to a particular class, leaves the rest of the community more destitute, and therefore more exposed to the extortions of usurers. As the profits of bank stock exceed the legal rate of interest, the possessors of money, it is argued, prefer investing it in that article to lending it at this rate; to which there are the additional motives of a more prompt command of the capital, and of more frequent and exact returns, without trouble or perplexity in the collection. This constitutes the second charge, which has been enumerated.  
The fact on which this charge rests is not to be admitted without several qualifications; particularly in reference to the state of things in this country. First. The great bulk of the Stock of a bank will consist of the funds of men in trade, among ourselves, and monied foreigners; the former of whom could not spare their capitals out of their reach, to be invested in loans, for long periods, on mortgages, or personal security; and the latter of whom would not be willing to be subjected to the casualties, delays and embarassments of such a disposition of their money in a distant country. Secondly. There will always be a considerable proportion of those, who are properly the money lenders of a Country, who from that spirit of caution, which usually characterises this description of men will incline rather to vest their funds in mortgages on real estate, than in the Stock of a Bank, which they are apt to consider as a more precarious security.  
These considerations serve in a material degree to narrow the foundation of the objection, as to the point of fact. But there is a more satisfactory answer to it. The effect supposed, as far as it has existence, is temporary. The reverse of it takes place, in the general and permanent operation of the thing.  
The capital of every public bank will of course be restricted within a certain defined limit. It is the province of legislative prudence so to adjust this limit, that while it will not be too contracted for the demand, which the course of business may create, and for the security, which the public ought to have for the solidity of the paper, which may be issued by the bank, it will still be within the compass of the pecuniary resources of the community; so that there may be an easy practicability of completing the subscriptions to it. When this is once done, the supposed effect of necessity ceases. There is then no longer room for the investment of any additional capital. Stock may indeed change hands by one person selling and another buying; but the money, which the buyer takes out of the common mass to purchase the stock, the seller receives, and restores to it. Hence the future surplusses, which may accumulate, must take their natural course, and lending at interest must go on, as if there were no such institution.  
It must indeed flow in a more copious stream. The Bank furnishes an extraordinary supply for borrowers, within its immediate sphere. A larger supply consequently remains for borrowers elsewhere. In proportion, as the circulation of the Bank is extended, there is an augmentation of the aggregate mass of money, for answering the aggregate mass of demand. Hence a greater facility in obtaining it for every purpose.  
It ought not to escape without a remark, that as far as the citizens of other countries become adventurers in the Bank, there is a positive increase of the gold and silver of the Country. It is true, that from this a half yearly rent is drawn back, accruing from the dividends upon the Stock. But as this rent arises from the employment of the capital, by our own citizens, it is probable, that it is more than replaced by the profits of that employment. It is also likely, that a part of it is, in the course of trade, converted into the products of our Country: And it may even prove an incentive, in some cases, to emigration to a country, in which the character of citizen is as easy to be acquired, as it is estimable and important. This view of the subject furnishes an answer to an objection, which has been deduced from the circumstance here taken notice of, namely the income resulting to foreigners from the part of the Stock, owned by them, which has been represented as tending to drain the country of its specie. In this objection, the original investment of the capital, and the constant use of it afterwards seem both to have been overlooked.  
That Banks furnish temptations to overtrading is the third of the enumerated objections. This must mean, that by affording additional aids to mercantile enterprise, they induce the merchant sometimes to adventure beyond the prudent or salutary point. But the very statement of the thing shews, that the subject of the charge is an occasional ill, incident to a general good. Credit of every kind (as a species of which only can bank lending have the effect supposed) must be in different degrees, chargeable with the same inconvenience. It is even applicable to gold and silver, when they abound in circulation. But would it be wise on this account to decry the precious metals, to root out credit; or to proscribe the means of that enterprise, which is the main spring of trade and a principal source of national wealth, because it now and then runs into excesses, of which overtrading is one?  
If the abuses of a beneficial thing are to determine its condemnation, there is scarcely a source of public prosperity, which will not speedily be closed. In every case, the evil is to be compared with the good; and in the present case such a comparison will issue in this, that the new and increased energies derived to commercial enterprise, from the aid of banks, are a source of general profit and advantage; which greatly outweigh the partial ills of the overtrading of a few individuals, at particular times, or of numbers in particular conjunctures.  
The fourth and fifth charges may be considered together. These relate to the aid, which is sometimes afforded by banks to unskilful adventurers and fraudulent traders. These charges also have some degree of foundation; though far less than has been pretended, and they add to the instances of partial ills, connected with more extensive and overbalancing benefits.  
The practice of giving fictitious credit to improper persons is one of those evils, which experience guided by interest speedily corrects. The bank itself is in so much jeopardy of being a sufferer by it, that it has the strongest of all inducements to be on its guard. It may not only be injured immediately by the delinquencies of the persons, to whom such credit is given; but eventually, by the incapacities of others, whom their impositions, or failures may have ruined.  
Nor is there much danger of a bank’s being betrayed into this error, from want of information. The Directors, themselves, being, for the most part, selected from the class of Traders are to be expected to possess individually an accurate knowlege of the characters and situations of those, who come within that description. And they have, in addition to this, the course of dealing of the persons themselves with the bank to assist their judgment, which is in most cases a good index of the state, in which those persons are. The artifices and shifts, which those in desperate or declining circumstances are obliged to employ, to keep up the countenance, which the rules of the Bank require, and the train of their connections, are so many prognostics, not difficult to be interpreted, of the fate which awaits them. Hence it not unfrequently happens, that Banks are the first to discover the unsoundness of such characters, and, by withholding credit, to announce to the public, that they are not intitled to it.  
If banks, in spite of every precaution, are sometimes betrayed into giving a false credit to the persons described; they more frequently enable honest and industrious men, of small or perhaps of no capital to undertake and prosecute business, with advantage to themselves and to the community; and assist merchants of both capital and credit, who meet with fortuitous and unforeseen shocks, which might without such helps prove fatal to them and to others; to make head against their misfortunes, and finally to retrieve their affairs: Circumstances, which form no inconsiderable encomium on the utility of Banks.  
But the last and heaviest charge is still to be examined. This is, that Banks tend to banish the gold and silver of the Country.  
The force of this objection rests upon their being an engine of paper credit, which by furnishing a substitute for the metals, is supposed to promote their exportation. It is an objection, which if it has any foundation, lies not against Banks, peculiarly, but against every species of paper credit.  
The most common answer given to it is, that the thing supposed is of little, or no consequence; that it is immaterial what serves the purpose of money, whether paper or gold and silver; that the effect of both upon industry is the same; and that the intrinsic wealth of a nation is to be measured, not by the abundance of the precious metals, contained in it, but by the quantity of the productions of its labor and industry.  
This answer is not destitute of solidity, though not intirely satisfactory. It is certain, that the vivification of industry, by a full circulation, with the aid of a proper and well regulated paper credit, may more than compensate for the loss of a part of the gold and silver of a Nation; if the consequence of avoiding that loss should be a scanty or defective circulation.  
But the positive and permanent increase or decrease of the precious metals, in a Country, can hardly ever be a matter of indifference. As the commodity taken in lieu of every other, it is a species of the most effective wealth; and as the money of the world, it is of great concern to the state, that it possess a sufficiency of it to face any demands, which the protection of its external interests may create.  
The objection seems to admit of another and a more conclusive answer, which controverts the fact itself. A nation, that has no mines of its own, must derive the precious metals from others; generally speaking, in exchange for the products of its labor and industry. The quantity, it will possess, will therefore, in the ordinary course of things, be regulated by the favourable, or unfavourable balance of its trade; that is, by the proportion between its abilities to supply foreigners, and its wants of them; between the amount of its exportations and that of its importations. Hence the state of its agriculture and manufactures, the quantity and quality of its labor and industry must, in the main, influence and determine the increase or decrease of its gold and silver.  
If this be true, the inference seems to be, that well constituted Banks favour the increase of the precious metals. It has been shewn, that they augment in different ways, the active capital of the country. This, it is, which generates employment; which animates and expands labor and industry. Every addition, which is made to it, by contributing to put in motion a greater quantity of both, tends to create a greater quantity of the products of both: And, by furnishing more materials for exportation, conduces to a favourable balance of trade and consequently to the introduction and increase of gold and silver.  
This conclusion appears to be drawn from solid premises. There are however objections to be made to it.  
It may be said, that as Bank paper affords a substitute for specie, it serves to counteract that rigorous necessity for the metals, as a medium of circulation, which in the case of a wrong balance, might restrain in some degree their exportation; and it may be added, that from the same cause, in the same case, it would retard those œconomical and parsimonious reforms, in the manner of living, which the scarcity of money is calculated to produce, and which might be necessary to rectify such wrong balance.  
There is perhaps some truth in both these observations; but they appear to be of a nature rather to form exceptions to the generality of the conclusion, than to overthrow it. The state of things, in which the absolute exigencies of circulation can be supposed to resist with any effect the urgent demands for specie, which a wrong balance of trade may occasion, presents an extreme case. And a situation in which a too expensive manner of living of a community, compared with its means, can stand in need of a corrective, from distress or necessity, is one, which perhaps rarely results, but from extraordinary and adventitious causes: such for example, as a national revolution, which unsettles all the established habits of a people, and inflames the appetite for extravagance, by the illusions of an ideal wealth, engendered by the continual multiplication of a depreciating currency or some similar cause. There is good reason to believe, that where the laws are wise and well executed, and the inviolability of property and contracts maintained, the œconomy of a people will, in the general course of things, correspond with its means.  
The support of industry is probably in every case, of more consequence towards correcting a wrong balance of trade, than any practicable retrenchments, in the expences of families, or individuals: And the stagnation of it would be likely to have more effect, in prolonging, than any such savings in shortening its continuance. That stagnation is a natural consequence of an inadequate medium, which, without the aid of Bank circulation, would in the cases supposed, be severely felt.  
It also deserves notice, that as the circulation is always in a compound ratio to the fund, upon which it depends, and to the demand for it, and as that fund is itself affected by the exportation of the metals, there is no danger of its being overstocked, as in the case of paper issued at the pleasure of the Government; or of its preventing the consequences of any unfavourable balance from being sufficiently felt, to produce the reforms alluded to, as far as circumstances may require and admit.  
Nothing can be more fallible, than the comparisons, which have been made between different countries, to illustrate the truth of the position under consideration. The comparative quantity of gold and silver, in different countries, depends upon an infinite variety of facts and combinations, all of which ought to be known, in order to judge, whether the existence or non existence of paper currencies has any share in the relative proportions they contain. The mass and value of the productions of the labor and industry of each, compared with its wants; the nature of its establishments abroad; the kind of wars in which it is usually engaged; the relations it bears to the countries, which are the original possessors of those metals; the privileges it enjoys in their trade; these and a number of other circumstances are all to be taken into the account, and render the investigation too complex to justify any reliance on the vague and general surmises, which have been hitherto hazarded on the point.  
In the foregoing discussion, the objection has been considered as applying to the permanent expulsion and diminution of the metals. Their temporary exportation, for particular purposes, has not been contemplated. This, it must be confessed is facilitated by Banks, from the faculty they possess of supplying their place. But their utility is in nothing more conspicuous, than in these very cases. They enable the Government to pay its foreign debts, and to answer any exigencies, which the external concerns of the community may have produced. They enable the Merchant to support his credit, (on which the prosperity of trade depends) when special circumstances prevent remittances in other modes. They enable him also to prosecute enterprises, which ultimately tend to an augmentation of the species of wealth in question. It is evident, that gold and silver may often be employed in procuring commodities abroad; which, in a circuitous commerce, replace the original fund, with considerable addition. But it is not to be inferred from this facility given to temporary exportation, that Banks, which are so friendly to trade and industry, are in their general tendency, inimical to the increase of the precious metals.  
These several views of the subject appear sufficient to impress a full conviction, of the utility of Banks, and to demonstrate that they are of great importance, not only in relation to the administration of the finances, but in the general system of the political œconomy.  
The judgment of many concerning them has no doubt been perplexed, by the misinterpreation of appearances, which were to be ascribed to other causes. The general devastation of personal property, occasioned by the late war, naturally produced, on the one hand, a great demand for money, and on the other a great deficiency of it to answer the demand. Some injudicious laws, which grew out of the public distresses, by impairing confidence and causing a part of the inadequate sum in the country to be locked up, aggravated the evil: The dissipated habits, contracted by many individuals, during the war, which after the peace plunged them into expences beyond their incomes: The number of adventurers without capital and in many instances, without information, who at that epoch rushed into trade, and were obliged to make any sacrifices to support a transient credit; the employment of considerable sums in speculations upon the public debt, which from its unsettled state was incapable of becoming itself a substitute: All these circumstances concurring necessarily led to usurious borrowing, produced most of the inconveniencies, and were the true causes of most of the appearances; which, where the Banks were established, have been by some erroneously placed to their account: a mistake, which they might easily have avoided, by turning their eyes towards places, where there were none, and where, nevertheless, the same evils would have been perceived to exist, even in a greater degree, than where those institutions had obtained.  
These evils have either ceased, or been greatly mitigated. Their more complete extinction may be looked for, from that additional security to property, which the constitution of the United States happily gives (a circumstance of prodigious moment in the scale both of public and private prosperity) from the attraction of foreign capital, under the auspices of that security, to be employed upon objects &amp; in enterprises, for which the state of this country opens a wide and inviting field, from the consistency and stability, which the public debt is fast acquiring, as well in the public opinion, at home and abroad, as in fact; from the augmentation of capital, which that circumstance and the quarter yearly payment of interest will afford; and from the more copious circulation, which will be likely to be created by a well constituted National Bank.  
The establishment of Banks in this country seems to be recommended by reasons of a peculiar nature. Previously to the revolution circulation was in a great measure carried on by paper emitted by the several local governments. In Pennsylvania alone the quantity of it was near a million and a half of dollars. This auxiliary may be said to be now at an end. And it is generally supposed, that there has been for some time past, a deficiency of circulating medium. How far that deficiency is to be considered as real or imaginary is not susceptible of demonstration, but there are circumstances and appearances, which, in relation to the country at large, countenance the supposition of its reality.  
The circumstances are, besides the fact just mentioned respecting paper emissions the vast tracts of waste land, and the little advanced state of manufactures. The progressive settlement of the former, while it promises ample retribution, in the generation of future resources, diminishes or obstructs, in the mean time, the active wealth of the country. It not only draws off a part of the circulating money, and places it in a more passive state, but it diverts into its own channels a portion of that species of labor and industry, which would otherwise be employed, in furnishing materials for foreign trade, and which by contributing to a favourable balance, would assist the introduction of specie. In the early periods of new settlements, the settlers not only furnish no surplus for exportation, but they consume a part of that which is produced by the labour of others. The same thing is a cause, that manufactures do not advance or advance slowly. And notwithstanding some hypotheses to the contrary, there are many things to induce a suspicion, that the precious metals will not abound, in any country, which has not mines or variety of manufactures. They have been sometimes acquired by the sword, but the modern system of war has expelled this resource, and it is one upon which it is to be hoped the United States will never be inclined to rely.  
The appearances, alluded to, are, greater prevalency of direct barter, in the more interior districts of the country, which however has been for some time past gradually lessening; and greater difficulty, generally, in the advantageous alienation of improved real estate; which, also, has, of late, diminished, but is still seriously felt in different parts of the Union. The difficulty of getting money, which has been a general complaint, is not added to the number; because it is the complaint of all times, and one, in which imagination must ever have too great scope, to permit an appeal to it.  
If the supposition of such a deficiency be in any degree founded, and some aid to circulation be desireable, it remains to inquire what ought to be the nature of that aid.  
The emitting of paper money by the authority of Government is wisely prohibited to the individual States, by the National Constitution. And the spirit of that prohibition ought not to be disregarded, by the Government of the United States. Though paper emissions, under a general authority, might have some advantages, not applicable, and be free from some disadvantages, which are applicable, to the like emissions by the States separately; yet they are of a nature so liable to abuse, and it may even be affirmed so certain of being abused, that the wisdom of the Government will be shewn in never trusting itself with the use of so seducing and dangerous an expedient. In times of tranquillity, it might have no ill consequence, it might even perhaps be managed in a way to be productive of good; but in great and trying emergencies, there is almost a moral certainty of its becoming mischievous. The stamping of paper is an operation so much easier than the laying of taxes, that a government, in the practice of paper emissions, would rarely fail in any such emergency to indulge itself too far, in the employment of that resource, to avoid as much as possible one less auspicious to present popularity. If it should not even be carried so far as to be rendered an absolute bubble, it would at least be likely to be extended to a degree, which would occasion an inflated and artificial state of things incompatible with the regular and prosperous course of the political œconomy.  
Among other material differences between a paper currency, issued by the mere authority of Government, and one issued by a Bank, payable in coin, is this—That in the first case, there is no standard to which an appeal can be made, as to the quantity which will only satisfy, or which will surcharge the circulation; in the last, that standard results from the demand. If more should be issued, than is necessary, it will return upon the bank. Its emissions, as elsewhere intimated, must always be in a compound ratio to the fund and to the demand: Whence it is evident, that there is a limitation in the nature of the thing: While the discretion of the government is the only measure of the extent of the emissions, by its own authority.  
This consideration further illustrates the danger of emissions of that sort, and the preference, which is due to Bank paper.  
The payment of the interest of the public debt, at thirteen different places, is a weighty reason, peculiar to our immediate situation, for desiring a Bank circulation. Without a paper, in general currency, equivalent to gold and silver, a considerable proportion of the specie of the country must always be suspended from circulation and left to accumulate, preparatorily to each day of payment; and as often as one approaches, there must in several cases be an actual transportation of the metals at both expence and risk, from their natural and proper reservoirs to distant places. This necessity will be felt very injuriously to the trade of some of the States; and will embarrass not a little the operations of the Treasury in those States. It will also obstruct those negociations, between different parts of the Union, by the instrumentality of Treasury bills, which have already afforded valuable accommodations to Trade in general.  
Assuming it then as a consequence, from what has been said, that a national bank is a desireable institution; two inquiries emerge. Is there no such institution, already in being, which has a claim to that character, and which supersedes the propriety, or necessity of another? If there be none, what are the principles upon which one ought to be established?  
There are at present three banks in the United States. That of North America, established in the city of Philadelphia; that of New York, established in the city of New York; that of Massachusetts, established in the city of Boston. Of these three, the first is the only one, which has at any time had a direct relation to the Government of the United States.  
The Bank of North America originated in a resolution of Congress of the 26th of May 1781, founded upon a proposition of the Superintendant of finance, which was afterwards carried into execution, by an ordinance of the 31st of december following, entitled, “An Ordinance to incorporate the Subscribers to the Bank of North America.”  
The aid afforded to the United States, by this institution, during the remaining period of the war, was of essential consequence, and its conduct towards them since the peace, has not weakened its title to their patronage and favour. So far its pretensions to the character in question are respectable; but there are circumstances, which militate against them; and considerations, which indicate the propriety of an establishment on different principles.  
The Directors of this Bank, on behalf of their constituents, have since accepted and acted under a new charter from the State of Pennsylvania, materially variant from their original one; and which so narrows the foundation of the institution, as to render it an incompetent basis for the extensive purposes of a National Bank.  
  
The limit assigned by the ordinance of Congress to the Stock of the Bank is ten millions of Dollars. The last charter of Pennsylvania confines it to two millions. Questions naturally arise, whether there be not a direct repugnancy between two charters so differently circumstanced; and whether the acceptance of the one is not to be deemed a virtual surrender of the other. But perhaps it is neither adviseable nor necessary to attempt a solution of them.  
There is nothing in the Acts of Congress, which imply an exclusive right in the institution, to which they relate, except during the term of the war. There is therefore nothing, if the public good require it, which prevents the establishment of another. It may however be incidentally remarked, that in the general opinion of the citizens of the United States, the Bank of North America has taken the station of a bank of Pennsylvania only. This is a strong argument for a new institution, or for a renovation of the old, to restore it to the situation in which it originally stood, in the view of the United States.  
But though the ordinance of Congress contains no grant of exclusive privileges, there may be room to allege, that the Government of the United States ought not, in point of candour and equity, to establish any rival or interfering institution, in prejudice of the one already established; especially as this has, from services rendered, well founded claims to protection and regard.  
The justice of such an observation ought within proper bounds to be admitted. A new establishment of the sort ought not to be made, without cogent and sincere reasons of public good. And in the manner of doing it every facility should be given to a consolidation of the old with the new, upon terms not injurious to the parties concerned. But there is no ground to maintain, that in a case, in which the Government has made no condition restricting its authority, it ought voluntarily to restrict it, through regard to the interests of a particular institution, when those of the state dictate a different course; especially too after such circumstances have intervened, as characterise the actual situation of the Bank of North America.  
The inducements, to a new disposition of the thing are now to be considered. The first of them which occurs is, the, at least ambiguous, situation, in which the Bank of North America has placed itself, by the acceptance of its last charter. If this has rendered it the mere Bank of a particular State, liable to dissolution at the expiration of fourteen years, to which term the act of that state has restricted its duration, it would be neither fit nor expedient to accept it, as an equivalent for a Bank of the United States.  
The restriction of its capital also, which according to the same supposition, cannot be extended beyond two millions of dollars, is a conclusive reason for a different establishment. So small a capital promises neither the requisite aid to government, nor the requisite security to the community. It may answer very well the purposes of local accommodation, but is an inadequate foundation for a circulation coextensive with the United States, embracing the whole of their revenues, and affecting every individual, into whose hands the paper may come.  
And inadequate as such a capital would be to the essential ends of a National Bank, it is liable to being rendered still more so, by that principle of the constitution of the Bank of North America, contained equally in its old and in its new charter, which leaves the increase of the actual capital at any time (now far short of the allowed extent) to the discretion of the Directors, or Stockholders. It is naturally to be expected, that the allurements of an advanced price of Stock and of large dividends may disincline those, who are interested, to an extension of capital; from which they will be apt to fear a diminution of profits. And from this circumstance, the interest and accommodation of the public (as well individually as collectively) are made more subordinate to the interest, real or imagined, of the Stockholders, than they ought to be. It is true, that unless the latter be consulted, there can be no bank (in the sense at least in which institutions of this kind, worthy of confidence, can be established in this Country) but it does not follow, that this is alone to be consulted, or that it even ought to be paramount. Public utility is more truly the object of public Banks, than private profit. And it is the business of Government, to constitute them on such principles, that while the latter will result, in a sufficient degree, to afford competent motives to engage in them, the former be not made subservient to it. To effect this, a principal object of attention ought to be to give free scope to the creation of an ample capital; and with this view, fixing the bounds, which are deemed safe and convenient, to leave no discretion either to stop short of them or to overpass them. The want of this precaution, in the establishment of the Bank of North America, is a further and an important reason for desiring one differently constituted.  
There may be room, at first sight, for a supposition, that as the profits of a Bank will bear a proportion to the extent of its operations, and as, for this reason, the interest of the Stockholders will not be disadvantageously affected, by any necessary augmentations of capital, there is no cause to apprehend, that they will be indisposed to such augmentations. But most men in matters of this nature, prefer the certainties, they enjoy, to probabilities depending on untried experiments; especially when these promise rather, that they will not be injured, than that they will be benefited.  
From the influence of this principle, and a desire of enhancing its profits, the Directors of a Bank will be more apt to overstrain its faculties, in the attempt to face the additional demands, which the course of business may create, than to set on foot new subscriptions, which may hazard a diminution of the profits, and even a temporary reduction of the price of Stock.  
Banks are among the best expedients for lowering the rate of interest, in a country; but to have this effect, their capitals must be completely equal to all the demands of business, and such as will tend to remove the idea, that the accommodations they afford, are in any degree favours; an idea very apt to accompany the parsimonious dispensation of contracted funds. In this, as in every other case, the plenty of the commodity ought to beget a moderation of the price.  
The want of a principle of rotation, in the constitution of the Bank of North America, is another argument for a variation of the establishment. Scarcely one of the reasons, which militate against this principle in the constitution of a country, is applicable to that of a Bank; while there are strong reasons in favour of it, in relation to the one, which do not apply to the other. The knowlege, to be derived from experience, is the only circumstance common to both, which pleads against rotation in the directing officers of a Bank.  
But the objects of the Government of a nation, and those of the government of a bank are so widely different, as greatly to weaken the force of that consideration, in reference to the latter. Almost every important case of legislation requires, towards a right decision, a general and an accurate acquaintance with the affairs of the state; and habits of thinking seldom acquired, but from a familiarity with public concerns. The administration of a bank, on the contrary, is regulated, by a few simple fixed maxims, the application of which is not difficult to any man of judgment, especially if instructed in the principles of trade. It is in general a constant succession of the same details.  
But though this be the case, the idea of the advantages of experience is not to be slighted. Room ought to be left for the regular transmission of official information: And for this purpose the head of the direction ought to be excepted from the principle of rotation. With this exception, and with the aid of the information of the subordinate officers, there can be no danger of any ill effects from want of experience, or knowlege; especially as the periodical exclusion ought not to reach the whole of the Directors at one time.  
The argument in favour of the principle of rotation is this, that by lessening the danger of combinations among the Directors, to make the institution subservient to party views, or to the accommodation, preferably, of any particular set of men, it will render the public confidence more firm, stable and unqualified.  
When it is considered, that the Directors of a Bank are not elected by the great body of the community, in which a diversity of views will naturally prevail, at different conjunctures, but by a small and select class of men, among whom it is far more easy to cultivate a steady adherence to the same persons and objects; and that those Directors have it in their power so immediately to conciliate, by obliging the most influential of this class, it is easy to perceive, that without the principle of rotation, changes in that body can rarely happen, but as a concession which they may themselves think it expedient to make to public opinion.  
The continual administration of an institution of this kind, by the same persons, will never fail, with, or without, cause, from their conduct, to excite distrust and discontent. The necessary secrecy of their transactions gives unlimited scope to imagination to infer that something is, or may be wrong. And this inevitable mystery is a solid reason, for inserting in the constitution of a Bank the necessity of a change of men. As neither the mass of the parties interested nor the public in general can be permitted to be witnesses of the interior management of the Directors, it is reasonable, that both should have that check upon their conduct, and that security against the prevalency of a partial or pernicious system, which will be produced by the certainty of periodical changes. Such too is the delicacy of the credit of a Bank, that every thing, which can fortify confidence and repel suspicion, without injuring its operations, ought carefully to be sought after in its formation.  
A further consideration in favour of a change, is the improper rule, by which the right of voting for Directors is regulated in the plan, upon which the Bank of North America was originally constituted, namely a vote for each share, and the want of a rule in the last charter; unless the silence of it, on that point, may signify that every Stockholder is to have an equal and a single vote, which would be a rule in a different extreme not less erroneous. It is of importance that a rule should be established, on this head, as it is one of those things, which ought not to be left to discretion; and it is consequently, of equal importance, that the rule should be a proper one.  
A vote for each share renders a combination, between a few principal Stockholders, to monopolise the power and benefits of the Bank too easy. An equal vote to each Stockholder, however great or small his interest in the institution, allows not that degree of weight to large stockholders, which it is reasonable they should have, and which perhaps their security and that of the bank require. A prudent mean is to be preferred. A conviction of this has produced a bye-law of the corporation of the bank of North America, which evidently aims at such a mean. But a reflexion arises here, that a like majority with that which enacted this law, may at any moment repeal it.  
The last inducement, which shall be mentioned, is the want of precautions to guard against a foreign influence insinuating itself into the Direction of the Bank. It seems scarcely reconcileable with a due caution to permit, that any but citizens should be eligible as Directors of a National Bank, or that non-resident foreigners should be able to influence the appointment of Directors by the votes of their proxies. In the event however of an incorporation of the Bank of North America in the plan, it may be necessary to qualify this principle, so as to leave the right of foreigners, who now hold shares of its stock unimpaired; but without the power of transmitting the privilege in question to foreign alienees.  
It is to be considered, that such a Bank is not a mere matter of private property, but a political machine of the greatest importance to the State.  
There are other variations from the Constitution of the Bank of North America, not of inconsiderable moment, which appear desireable, but which are not of magnitude enough to claim a prliminary discussion. These will be seen in the plan, which will be submitted in the sequel.  
If the objections, which have been stated to the constitution of the Bank of North America, are admitted to be well founded, they will nevertheless not derogate from the merit of the main design, or of the services which that bank has rendered, or of the benefits which it has produced. The creation of such an institution, at the time it took place, was a measure dictated by wisdom. Its utility has been amply evinced by its fruits. American Independence owes much to it. And it [is] very conceivable, that reasons of the moment may have rendered those features in it inexpedient which a revision, with a permanent view, suggests as desireable.  
The order of the subject leads next to an inquiry into the principles, upon which a national Bank, ought to be organised.  
The situation of the United States naturally inspires a wish, that the form of the institution could admit of a plurality of branches. But various considerations discourage from pursuing this idea. The complexity of such a plan would be apt to inspire doubts, which might deter from adventuring in it. And the practicability of a safe and orderly administration, though not to be abandoned as desparate cannot be made so manifest in perspective, as to promise the removal of those doubts, or to justify the Government in adopting the idea as an original experiment. The most that would seem adviseable, on this point, is to insert a provision, which may lead to it hereafter; if experience shall more clearly demonstrate its utility, and satisfy those, who may have the Direction, that it may be adopted with safety. It is certain, that it would have some advantages both peculiar and important. Besides more general accommodation, it would lessen the danger of a run upon the bank.  
  
The argument, against it, is, that each branch must be under a distinct, though subordinate direction; to which a considerable latitude of discretion must of necessity be entrusted. And as the property of the whole institution would be liable for the engagements of each part, that and its credit would be at stake, upon the prudence of the Directors of every part. The mismanagement of either branch, miight hazard serious disorder in the whole.  
Another wish, dictated by the particular situation of the country, is, that the Bank could be so constituted as to be made an immediate instrument of loans to the proprietors of land; but this wish also yields to the difficulty of accomplishing it. Land is alone an unfit fund for a bank circulation. If the notes issued upon it were not to be payable in coin, on demand, or at a short date; this would amount to nothing more than a repetition of the paper emissions, which are now exploded by the general voice. If the notes are to be payable in coin, the land must first be converted into it by sale, or mortgage. The difficulty of effecting the latter is the very thing, which begets the desire of finding another resource, and the former would not be practicable on a sudden emergency, but with sacrifices which would make the cure worse than the disease. Neither is the idea of constituting the fund partly of coin and partly of land free from impediments. These two species of property do not for the most part unite in the same hands. Will the monied man consent to enter into a partnership with the landholder by which the latter will share in the profits which will be made by the money of the former? The money it is evident will be the agent or efficient cause of the profits. The land can only be regarded as an additional security. It is not difficult to foresee, that an union, on such terms, will not readily be formed. If the landholders are to procure the money by sale or mortgage of a part of their lands, this they can as well do, when the Stock consists wholly of money, as if it were to be compounded of money and land.  
To procure for the landholders the assistance of loans is the great desideratum. Supposing other difficulties surmounted, and a fund created, composed partly of coin and partly of land, yet the benefit contemplated could only then be obtained, by the banks advancing them its notes for the whole or part of the value of the lands, they had subscribed to the Stock. If this advance was small, the relief aimed at would not be given; if it was large, the quantity of notes issued would be a cause of distrust, and, if received at all, they would be likely to return speedily upon the Bank for payment; which, after exhausting its coin, might be under a necessity of turning its lands into money, at any price, that could be obtained for them, to the irreparable prejudice of the proprietors.  
Considerations of public advantage suggest a further wish, which is, that the Bank could be established upon principles, that would cause the profits of it to redound to the immediate benefit of the State. This is contemplated by many, who speak of a National Bank, but the idea seems liable to insuperable objections. To attach full confidence to an institution of this nature, it appears to be an essential ingredient in its structure, that it shall be under a private not a public Direction, under the guidance of individual interest, not of public policy; which would be supposed to be, and in certain emergencies, under a feeble or too sanguine administration would, really, be, liable to being too much influenced by public necessity. The suspicion of this would most probably be a canker, that would continually corrode the vitals of the credit of the Bank, and would be most likely to prove fatal in those situations, in which the public good would require, that they should be most sound and vigorous. It would indeed be little less, than a miracle, should the credit of the Bank be at the disposal of the Government, if in a long series of time, there was not experienced a calamitous abuse of it. It is true, that it would be the real interest of the Government not to abuse it; its genuine policy to husband and cherish it with the most guarded circumspection as an inestimable treasure. But what Government ever uniformly consulted its true interest, in opposition to the temptations of momentary exigencies? What nation was ever blessed with a constant succession of upright and wise Administrators?  
The keen, steady, and, as it were, magnetic sense, of their own interest, as proprietors, in the Directors of a Bank, pointing invariably to its true pole, the prosperity of the institution, is the only security, that can always be relied upon, for a careful and prudent administration. It is therefore the only basis on which an enlightened, unqualified and permanent confidence can be expected to be erected and maintained.  
  
The precedents of the Banks established in several cities of Europe, Amsterdam, Hamburgh and others, may seem to militate against this position. Without a precise knowlege of all the peculiarities of their respective constitutions, it is difficult to pronounce how far this may be the case. That of Amsterdam, however, which we best know, is rather under a municipal than a governmental direction. Particular magistrates of the city, not officers of the republic, have the management of it. It is also a Bank of deposit, not of loan, or circulation; consequently less liable to abuse, as well as less useful. Its general business consists in receiving money for safekeeping; which if not called for within a certain time becomes a part of its Stock and irreclaimable: But a Credit is given for it on the books of the Bank, which being transferable, answers all the purposes of money.  
The Directors being Magistrates of the city, and the Stockholders in general, its most influential citizens, it is evident, that the principle of private interest must be prevalent in the management of the Bank. And it is equally evident, that from the nature of its operations, that principle is less essential to it, than to an Institution, constituted with a view to the accommodation of the Public and Individuals by direct loans and a paper circulation.  
As far as may concern the aid of the Bank, within the proper limits, a good government has nothing more to wish for, than it will always possess; though the management be in the hands of private individuals. As the institution, if rightly constituted, must depend for its renovation from time to time on the pleasure of the Government, it will not be likely to feel a disposition to render itself, by its conduct, unworthy of public patronage. The Government too in the administration of its finances, has it in its power to reciprocate benefits to the Bank, of not less importance, than those which the bank affords to the Government, and which besides are never unattended with an immediate and adequate compensation. Independent of these more particular considerations, the natural weight and influence of a good Government will always go far towards procuring a compliance with its desires; and as the Directors will usually be composed of some of the most discreet, respectable and well informed citizens, it can hardly ever be difficult to make them sensible of the force of the inducements, which ought to stimulate their exertions.  
It will not follow, from what has been said, that the State may not be the holder of a part of the Stock of a Bank, and consequently a sharer in the profits of it. It will only follow, that it ought not to desire any participation in the Direction of it, and therefore ought not to own the whole or a principal part of the Stock; for if the mass of the property should belong to the public, and if the direction of it should be in private hands, this would be to commit the interests of the State to persons, not interested, or not enough interested in their proper management.  
There is one thing, however, which the Government owes to itself and to the community; at least to all that part of it, who are not Stockholders; which is to reserve to itself a right of ascertaining, as often as may be necessary, the state of the Bank, excluding however all pretension to controul. This right forms an article in the primitive constitution of the Bank of North America. And its propriety stands upon the clearest reasons. If the paper of a Bank is to be permitted to insinuate itself into all the revenues and receipts of a country; if it is even to be tolerated as the substitute for gold and silver, in all the transactions of business, it becomes in either view a national concern of the first magnitude. As such the ordinary rules of prudence require, that the Government should possess the means of ascertaining, whenever it thinks fit, that so delicate a trust is executed with fidelity and care. A right of this nature is not only desireable, as it respects the Government; but it ought to be equally so to all those, concerned in the institution; as an additional title to public and private confidence; and as a thing which can only be formidable to practices, that imply mismanagement. The presumption must always be, that the characters who would be entrusted with the exercise of this right, on behalf of the Government, will not be deficient in the discretion, which it may require; at least the admitting of this presumption cannot be deemed too great a return of confidence for that very large portion of it, which the Government is required to place in the Bank.  
Abandoning, therefore, ideas, which however agreeable or desireable, are neither practicable nor safe, the following plan for the constitution of a National Bank is respectfully submitted to the consideration of the House.  
I. The capital Stock of the Bank shall not exceed ten Millions of Dollars, divided into Twenty five thousand shares, each share being four hundred Dollars; to raise which sum, subscriptions shall be opened on the first monday of april next, and shall continue open, until the whole shall be subscribed. Bodies politic as well as individuals may subscribe.  
II. The amount of each share shall be payable, one fourth in gold and silver coin, and three fourths in that part of the public debt, which according to the loan proposed by the Act making provision for the debt of the United States, shall bear an accruing interest at the time of payment of six per centum per annum.  
III. The respective sums subscribed shall be payable in four equal parts, as well specie as debt, in succession, and at the distance of six calendar months from each other; the first payment to be made at the time of subscription. If there shall be a failure in any subsequent payment, the party failing shall lose the benefit of any dividend which may have accrued, prior to the time for making such payment, and during the delay of the same.  
IV. The Subscribers to the Bank and their successors shall be incorporated, and shall so continue until the final redemption of that part of its stock, which shall consist of the public debt.  
V. The capacity of the corporation to hold real and personal estate shall be limited to fifteen millions of Dollars, including the amount of its capital, or original stock. The lands and tenements, which it shall be permitted to hold, shall be only such as shall be requisite for the immediate accommodation of the institution; and such as shall have been bona fide mortgaged to it by way of security, or conveyed to it in satisfaction of debts previously contracted, in the usual course of its dealings, or purchased at sales upon judgments which shall have been obtained for such debts.  
VI. The totality of the debts of the company, whether by bond, bill, note, or other contract, (credits for deposits excepted) shall never exceed the amount of its capital stock. In case of excess, the Directors, under whose administration it shall happen, shall be liable for it in their private or separate capacities. Those who may  have dissented may excuse themselves from this responsibility by immediately giving notice of the fact and their dissent to the President of the United States, and to the Stockholders, at a general meeting to be called by the President of the Bank at their request.  
VII. The Company may sell or demise its lands and tenements, or may sell the whole, or any part of the public Debt, whereof its Stock shall consist; but shall trade in nothing, except bills of exchange, gold and silver bullion, or in the sale of goods pledged for money lent: nor shall take more than at the rate of six per centum, per annum, upon its loans or discounts.  
VIII. No loan shall be made by the bank, for the use or on account of the Government of the United States, or of either of them to an amount exceeding fifty thousand Dollars, or of any foreign prince or State; unless previously authorised by a law of the United States.  
IX. The Stock of the Bank shall be transferable according to such rules as shall be instituted by the Company in that behalf.  
X. The affairs of the Bank shall be under the management of Twenty five Directors, one of whom shall be the President. And there shall be on the first monday of January, in each year, a choice of Directors, by plurality of suffrages of the Stockholders, to serve for a year. The Directors at their first meeting, after each election, shall choose one of their number as President.  
XI. The number of votes, to which each Stockholder shall be entitled, shall be according to the number of shares he shall hold in the proportions following, that is to say, for one share and not more than two shares one vote; for every two shares, above two and not exceeding ten, one vote; for every four shares above ten and not exceeding thirty, one vote; for every six shares above thirty and not exceeding sixty, one vote; for every eight shares above sixty and not exceeding one hundred, one vote; and for every ten shares above one hundred, one vote; but no person, copartnership, or body politic, shall be entitled to a greater number than thirty votes. And after the first election, no share or shares shall confer a right of suffrage, which shall not have been holden three calendar months previous to the day of election. Stockholders actually resident within the United States and none other may vote in elections by proxy.  
  
XII. Not more than three fourths of the Directors in office, exclusive of the President, shall be eligible for the next succeeding year. But the Director who shall be President at the time of an election may always be reelected.  
XIII. None but a Stockholder being a citizen of the United States, shall be eligible as a Director.  
XIV. Any number of Stockholders not less than sixty, who together shall be proprietors of two hundred shares, or upwards, shall have power at any time to call a general meeting of the Stockholders, for purposes relative to the Institution; giving at least six weeks notice in two public gazettes of the place where the Bank is kept, and specifying in such notice the object of the meeting.  
XV. In case of the death, resignation, absence from the United States, or removal of a Director by the Stockholders, his place may be filled by a new choice for the remainder of the year.  
XVI. No Director shall be entitled to any emolument, unless the same shall have been allowed by the Stockholders at a General meeting. The Stockholders shall make such compensation to the President, for his extraordinary attendance at the Bank, as shall appear to them reasonable.  
XVII. Not less than seven Directors shall constitute a Board for the transaction of business.  
XVIII. Every Cashier, or Treasurer, before he enters on the duties of his office shall be required to give bond, with two or more sureties, to the satisfaction of the Directors, in a sum not less than twenty thousand Dollars, with condition for his good behaviour.  
XIX. Half yearly dividends shall be made of so much of the profits of the Bank as shall appear to the Directors adviseable: And once in every three years the Directors shall lay before the Stockholders, at a General Meeting, for their information, an exact and particular statement of the debts, which shall have remained unpaid, after the expiration of the original credit, for a period of treble the term of that credit; and of the surplus of profit, if any, after deducting losses and dividends.  
XX. The bills and notes of the Bank originally made payable, or which shall have become payable on demand, in gold and silver coin, shall be receivable in all payments to the United States.  
  
XXI. The Officer at the head of the Treasury Department of the United States, shall be furnished from time to time, as often as he may require, not exceeding once a week, with statements of the amount of the capital Stock of the Bank and of the debts due to the same; of the monies deposited therein; of the notes in circulation, and of the Cash in hand; and shall have a right to inspect such general account in the books of the bank as shall relate to the said statements; provided, that this shall not be construed to imply a right of inspecting this account of any private individual or individuals with the Bank.  
XXII. No similar institution shall be established by any future act of the United States, during the continuance of the one hereby proposed to be established.  
XXIII. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Bank to establish offices, wheresoever they shall think fit, within the United States, for the purposes of discount and deposit only, and upon the same terms, and in the same manner, as shall be practiced at the Bank; and to commit the management of the said offices, and the making of the said discounts, either to Agents specially appointed by them, or to such persons as may be chosen by the Stockholders residing at the place where any such office shall be, under such agreements and subject to such regulations as they shall deem proper; not being contrary to law or to the Constitution of the Bank.  
XXIV. And lastly. The President of the United States shall be authorised to cause a subscription to be made to the Stock of the said Company, on behalf of the United States, to an amount not exceeding two Millions of Dollars, to be paid out of the monies which shall be borrowed by virtue of either of the Acts, the one entitled “an Act making provision for the debt of the United States,” and the other entitled “An Act making provision for the reduction of the Public Debt”; borrowing of the bank an equal sum, to be applied to the purposes for which the said monies shall have been procured, reimbursable in ten years by equal annual instalments; or at any time sooner, or in any greater proportions, that the Government may think fit.  
  
The reasons for the several provisions contained in the foregoing plan, have been so far anticipated, and will, for the most part, be so readily suggested, by the nature of those provisions, that any comments, which need further be made, will be both few and concise.  
The combination of a portion of the public Debt in the formation of the Capital, is the principal thing, of which an explanation is requisite. The chief object of this is, to enable the creation of a capital sufficiently large to be the basis of an extensive circulation, and an adequate security for it. As has been elsewhere remarked, the original plan of the Bank of North America contemplated a capital of ten millions of Dollars, which is certainly not too broad a foundation for the extensive operations, to which a National Bank is destined. But to collect such a sum in this country, in gold and silver, into one depository, may, without hesitation, be pronounced impracticable. Hence the necessity of an auxiliary which the public debt at once presents.  
This part of the fund will be always ready to come in aid of the specie. It will more and more command a ready sale; and can therefore expeditiously be turned into coin if an exigency of the Bank should at any time require it. This quality of prompt convertibility into coin, renders it an equivalent for that necessary agent of Bank circulation; and distinguishes it from a fund in land of which the sale would generally be far less compendious and at great disadvantage. The quarter yearly receipts of interest will also be an actual addition to the specie fund during the intervals between them and the half yearly dividends of profits. The objection to combining land with specie, resulting from their not being generally in possession of the same persons, does not apply to the debt, which will always be found in considerable quantity among the monied and trading people.  
The debt composing part of the capital, besides its collateral effect in enabling the Bank to extend its operations, and consequently to enlarge its profits, will produce a direct annual revenue of six per centum from the Government, which will enter into the half yearly dividends received by the Stockholders.  
When the present price of the public debt is considered, and the effect which its conversion into Bank Stock, incorporated with a specie fund, would in all probability have to accelerate its rise to the proper point, it will easily be discovered, that the operation presents in its outset a very considerable advantage to those who may become subscribers; and from the influence, which that rise would have on the general mass of the Debt, a proportional benefit to all the public creditors, and, in a sense, which has been more than once adverted to, to the community at large.  
There is an important fact, which exemplifies the fitness of the public Debt, for a bank fund, and which may serve to remove doubts in some minds on this point. It is this, that the Bank of England in its first erection rested wholly on that foundation. The subscribers to a Loan to Government of one million two hundred thousand pounds sterling were incorporated as a Bank; of which the Debt created by the Loan, and the interest upon it, were the sole fund. The subsequent augmentations of its capital, which now amounts to between eleven and twelve millions of pounds sterling, have been of the same nature.  
The confining of the right of the Bank to contract debts to the amount of its capital is an important precaution, which is not to be found in the constitution of the Bank of North America, and which, while the fund consists wholly of coin, would be a restriction attended with inconveniencies, but would be free from any if the composition of it should be such as is now proposed. The restriction exists in the establishment of the Bank of England, and as a source of security is worthy of imitation. The consequence of exceeding the limit there is, that each Stockholder is liable to the excess, in proportion to his interest in the Bank. When it is considered, that the Directors owe their appointments to the choice of the Stockholders, a responsibility of this kind, on the part of the latter, does not appear unreasonable. But, on the other hand, it may be deemed a hardship upon those, who may have dissented from the choice. And there are many among us, whom it might perhaps discourage from becoming concerned in the institution. These reasons have induced the placing of the responsibility upon the Directors, by whom the limit prescribed should be transgressed.  
The interdiction of loans on account of the United States, or of any particular State, beyond the moderate sum specified, or of any foreign power, will serve as a barrier to executive incroachments; and to combinations inauspicious to the safety or contrary to the policy of the Union.  
The limitation of the rate of interest is dictated by the consideration, that different rates prevail in different parts of the Union; and as the operations of the Bank may extend through the whole, some rule seems to be necessary. There is room for a question, whether the limitation ought not rather to be to five than to six per cent, as proposed. It may with safety be taken for granted, that the former rate would yield an ample dividend; perhaps as much as the latter, by the extension which it would give to business. The natural effect of low interest is to increase trade and industry; because undertakings of every kind can be prosecuted with greater advantage. This is a truth generally admitted; but it is requisite to have analised the subject, in all its relations, to be able to form a just conception of the extent of that effect. Such an analysis cannot but satisfy an intelligent mind, that the difference of one per cent, in the rate at which money may be had, is often capable of making an essential change for the better in the situation of any country or place.  
Every thing, therefore, which tends to lower the rate of interest is peculiarly worthy of the cares of Legislators. And though laws which violently sink the legal rate of interest greatly below the market level are not to be commended, because they are not calculated to answer their aim, yet whatever has a tendency to effect a reduction, without violence to the natural course of things, ought to be attended to and pursued. Banks are among the means most proper to accomplish this end; and the moderation of the rate at which their discounts are made, is a material ingredient towards it; with which their own interest, viewed on an enlarged and permanent scale, does not appear to clash.  
But as the most obvious ideas are apt to have greater force, than those which depend on complex and remote combinations, there would be danger, that the persons whose funds must constitute the Stock of the Bank would be diffident of the sufficiency of the profits to be expected, if the rate of loans and discounts were to be placed below the point to which they have been accustomed; and might on this account be indisposed to embarking in the plan. There is, it is true, one reflection, which in regard to men actively engaged in trade ought to be a security against this danger; it is this, that the accommodations which they might derive in the way of their business, at a low rate, would more than indemnify them for any difference in the dividend, supposing even that some diminution of it were to be the consequence. But upon the whole, the hazard of contrary reasoning among the mass of monied men is a powerful argument against the experiment. The institutions of the kind already existing add to the difficulty of making it. Maturer reflection and a large capital may of themselves lead to the desired end.  
The last thing, which will require any explanatory remark, is the authority proposed to be given to the President to subscribe to the amount of two millions of Dollars on account of the public. The main design of this is to enlarge the specie fund of the Bank, and to enable it to give a more early extension to its operations. Though it is proposed to borrow with one hand what is lent with the other, yet the disbursement of what is borrowed will be progressive, and Bank notes may be thrown into circulation, instead of the gold and silver. Besides, there is to be an annual reimbursement of a part of the sum borrowed, which will finally operate as an actual investment of so much specie. In addition to the inducements to this measure, which results from the general interest of the Government, to enlarge the sphere of the utility of the Bank, there is this more particular consideration, to wit, that as far as the dividend on the Stock shall exceed the interest paid on the loan, there is a positive profit.  
The Secretary begs leave to conclude, with this general observation, that if the Bank of North America shall come forward with any propositions, which have for object the ingrafting upon that institution the characteristics, which shall appear to the Legislature necessary to the due extent and safety of a National Bank, there are, in his judgment, weighty inducements to giving every reasonable facility to the measure. Not only the pretensions of that institution, from its original relation to the Government of the United States, and from the services it has rendered, are such as to claim a disposition favourable to it, if those who are interested in it are willing on their part to place it on a footing satisfactory to the Government, and equal to the purposes of a Bank of the United States; but its cooperation would materially accelerate the accomplishment of the great object, and the collision, which might otherwise arise, might, in a variety of ways, prove equally disagreeable and injurious. The incorporation or union here contemplated, may be effected in different modes, under the auspices of an Act of the United States, if it shall be desired by the Bank of North America, upon terms, which shall appear expedient to the Government.  
All which is humbly submitted

Secondly. Greater facility to the government in obtaining pecu­  
niary aids, especially in sudden emergencies. This is another and  
an undisputed advantage of public banks&#x27;: One, which as air adv  
remarked, has been realized in signal instances, among ourselves.  
The reason is obvious : Thecapitals of a great number of indivi­  
duals are, by this operation, collected to a point, an&#x27;d placed un­  
der one dire6lion. The mass, formed by this union, is in a cer­  
tain sense magnified by the credit attached to it. And while this  
mass is always ready, and can at once be put in motion, in aid of  
the government, the interest of the bank to afford that aid, inde­  
pendent of regard to the public fafety and welfare, is a sure pledge  
for its disposition to go as far in hs compliances, as can in pru­  
dence be dt fired. There is in the na ureof things,as will be more  
particularly noticed in another place, an intimate connexion of  
interest between the government and the bank of a nation.  
Thirdly. The facilitating bfthc payment of taxes. This advan­  
tage is produced in two ways. Tkofe who are i;i a situation to  
have access to the bank, can have the aflifiance of loans to answer  
with punctuality the public calls upon them. This accommoda­  
tion has been sensibly felt in the payment of the duties heretofore  
laid, by those who reside where establishments ot this nature exist.  
This, however, though an exteniive, is not an rriiverfal benefit.  
The other way in which the effe£t here contemplated is produ­  
ced, and in which the benefit is general, is the incrcafihg of the  
quantity of circulating medium,and the quickening of circulation.  
The manner in which the firft happens has already been traced.  
The last may require some illustration. When payments are to  
be made between different places, having an intercourse of busi­  
ness with each other, if there happen to be no private bills at mar­  
ket, and there are no bank notes which have a currency in both,  
the confcquence is that coin must be remitted. This is attended  
with trouble, delay, expcnce and risk. If on the contrary there  
are bank notes current in both places, the tranfiniflion of these by  
the post, or any otherfpeedv or convenient conveyance, answers  
the puipofc ; and these again, in the alternations of demand, are  
frequently returned very soon after to the place from whence they  
•were at firft sent; whence t.ie transportation and re-lranfporta­  
tion of the metals are obviated, and a more convenient and more  
expeditious medium of payment is substituted. Nor is this all :  
The metals, instead ofbeing suspended from their usual fur)6Hons,  
during this prpcefs of vibration from place to place, continue in  
activity, and administer still to the ordinary circulation ; which  
of course is prevented from fuffenng either diminution or stagna­  
tion. These circumstances are additional causes of what, in a  
prattical sense, or to the purpofeuof business, may be called great- i  
er plenty of money. And it is evident, that whatever enhances ,  
the quantity of circulating money adds to the ease with which  
every industrious member of the community may acquire that  
portion of it, of which he (lands in need ; and enables him the  
better to pay his taxes, as well as to supply his other wants. Even  
where the cirlulation of the bank paper is not general, it mufl still  
have the fame effe6l, though in a less degree. For whatever fur­  
nifties additional supplies to the channels of circulation, in one  
quarter, naturallycontributesto keep the streams fuller elsewhere. &#x27;  
This last view or the fubjett serves W&gt;th to illuflrate the position,  
that banks tend to facilitate the payment of taxes ; and to exem­  
plify their utility to business of every.kind, in which money is an  
agent.  
It would be to intrude too much on the patience of the house,  
to prolong the details of the advantages of banks; especially as  
all those, which mighc still be particularized, are readily to be in­  
ferred as consequences from thole which have been enumerated.  
Their disadvantages, real or supposed, are now to be reviewed.  
The most fcrious of the charges which have been brought againll  
them, are—  
  
That they serve to increase usury.  
  
That they tend to prevent other kindl? of lending,  
&#x27;fhattheyfumifli temptations to over-trading.  
  
That they afford aid to ignorant ac-venturers, who disturb the  
natural and beneficial courfe&quot;\f trade.  
  
That thcv give to bankrupt &#x27;and fraudulent traders a fictitious  
crcdit, which enables them to fnaintaiu falfc appearances, and to  
extend their impositions: And lastly,  
That they have a tendency tc banifti gold and silver from the  
country.  
There is great reason to believe, that on a close and candid sur­  
vey, it will be dlfcovercd, that Ihefe charges are either without  
foundation, or that, as far as the evils they suggest have beenfound  
to exist, they have proceeded from other, or partial, or tempo­  
rary cau(cs, arenot inherent in the nature and permanent tendency  
of such institutions, or are more than counterbalanced by opposite  
advantages. This (urvey shall be had in the order in which the  
charges have been stated. The fir It of them is,  
  
That banks serve to increase usury.  
It is a truth, which ought not to be denied, that the method of  
conducing business, which is efTential to bank opeiations, has,  
among us in particular instances, given occasion to usurious tranf­  
aftions. The punctuality in payments, which they neceffanly  
exact, has fomctimes obliged those who have adventured beyond  
both their capital and credit, to procure money, at any price, and  
consequently to resort to usurers for aid.  
  
But experience and practice gradually bring a cure to this evil.  
A general habit of puuttuality among traders, is the natural con­  
fluence of the neceflity of observing it with the bank ; a circum­  
stance which itfelf more than compensates for Sny occasional ill  
which may have sprung from that neceflity, in the particular un­  
der conlideration. As far therefor: as traders depend upon each  
other for pecuniary supplies, they can calculate their expectations  
with greater certainty; and are in proportionably less danger of  
aifappointments, which might compel them to have recoinfe to (o  
pernicious an expedient as that of borrowing at usury ; the mif­  
chiefs of which, after a few examples, naturally inspire great care  
in all but men of desperate circumstances, to avoid the poflibility  
of being fubjf&amp;ed to them. One, and not the least of the evils  
incident to the use of that expedient, if the fa ft be known, or even  
strongly fufpc&amp;ed, is loss of credit with the bank itfelf.  
  
The dire&amp;ors of a bank too, tho&#x27; in order to extend its bufmefs  
and its popularity, in the infancy of an institution, they may be  
tempted to go further in accommodations, than the ftri£t rules of  
prudence will warrant, grow more circumfpeft of course, as its  
affairs become better eftabliflied, and as the evils of too great fa­  
cility are experimentally demonstrated. They become more at­  
tentive to the situation and couduft of those with whom they deal •  
they obfervc more narrowly their operations and pursuits; they  
economize the credit they give to those of suspicious folitjity :  
they refufc it to those whose career is more manifeitly hazardous.  
In a word, in the course of pra&amp;ice, from the very nature of  
things, the interejl will make it the policy of a bank, to&#x27; succour the  
wary and induftnous ; to discredit the rash and unthrifty ; to dis­  
countenance both usurious lenders and usurious borrowers.  
  
There is a leading view, in which the tendency of banks will  
be fecn to be, to abridge rather than to promote usury. This re­  
  
lates to their property of incrcafmg the quantity and quickcning  
the circulation of money. If it be evident, that usury will pre­  
vail or diminifn, according to the proportion which the demand  
for borrowing bears to the quantity of money at market to be  
lent ; whatever has the property just mentioned, whether it be in  
the (hape of paper or Coin, by contributing to render the supply  
more equal to the demand, must tend to countera£l the progress  
of usury.  
  
But bank lending, it is pretended, is an impediment to other  
kinds of lending ; which, by confining the resource of borrowing  
to a particular class, leaves the reft of the community more dcfti­  
tute, zi.d therefore more cxpofed to the extortions ot usurers. As  
the profits of bank stock excced the legal rate of intercft, the pof­  
feflors of money, it is argued, prefer inverting it in that article to  
lending it at this rate ; to which there are the additional motives  
of a more prompt command of the capital, and of more frequent  
and exact returns, without trouble or perplexity in the collection.  
7 his constitutes the second charge which has been enumerated.  
The fatt on which this charge refls is not to be admitted with­  
out several qualifications ; particularly in reference to the Hate of  
things in this country. Firsl—The great bulk of the stock of a  
bank willconfift of the funds of men in trade, among ourselves,  
and monied foreigners; the former of whom could not spare their  
capitals out of their r ach, to be inverted in loans for long periods,  
on mortgages, or perfonalfecurity; and the latter of whom would  
nor be willing to befubjefted to the casualties, delays and embar­  
rafTments of luch a disposition of their money in a distant coun­  
trv. Secondly—There will always be a considerable proportion  
o. those who arc properly the money-lenders of a country, who  
from that spirit of caution which ulually charafterifes this des­  
cription of men, will incline rathei to vert their funds in mortga­  
ges on real cftate, than in the stock of a bank, which they are apt  
to consider as a more precarious security.  
Th fe cor.fiderations fervc in a material degree to narrow the  
foundation of theobjettion, as to the point of- faffc. But there is  
a more fatisfaftory answer to it. The c£Fe£t supposed, as far as it  
hasexiftcnce, is temporary. The reverse of it takes place in the  
general and permanent operation of the thing.

V  
THEcapital of every public bank will of course be reftri&amp;ed  
within a certain defined limit. It is the province of legisla­  
tive prudence so to adjust this limit, that while it will not be too  
contracted for the demand, which the r.ourfc of business may cre­  
ate, and for the security which the public ought to have for the so­  
lidity of the paper which may be ilTued by the bank, it will ftiJl  
be within the compass of the pecuniary resources of the commu­  
nity; so that there may bean easy practicability of completing the  
fubfeription? to it. When this is once done, the supposed etfeft  
of neceflity ceases. There is the#) no longer room for the invert,  
ment of any additional capital. Stock may indeed change hands  
by one perion felling and onother buying : but the money which  
the buyer takes out of the common mass to purchase the stock, the  
ieller receives and restores to it. Hence the future furpluffes  
which may accumulate, mult take their natural course, and lend­  
ing at interest muftgo on as it theie were no such inflitution.  
It rncft indeed floW in a more copious stream. The bank fur­  
nifhes an extraordinary supply for borrowers, within its imme­  
diate fphrre. A larger supply confequentiy remains for borrow­  
ers elsewhere. In proportion as the circulation of the bank is ex­  
tended, there is an augmentation of the aggregate mass of money  
for answering the aggregate mass of demand. Hence greater fa­  
cility in obtaining it for every purpose.  
It ought not to cfcape without a remark, that as far as the ci­  
tizens of other countries become adventurers in the bank, theie  
is a positive increase of the gold and silver of the country. It is  
true, that from this a half yearly rent is drawn back, accruing  
from the dividends upon the (lock. But as this rent arises from  
e employment of the capital, by our own citizens, it is proba­  
&#x27; that &quot; ,s more than replaced by the profits of that employ­  
ment. Itisalfe likely, that a part of it is, in the course of trade,  
converted into the products of our country: And it may even  
prove an incentive, in some cases, to emigration to a country in  
which the tha rafter of citizen is as easy to be acquired, as it is es­  
timable and important. This view of the fubjeft furnifnes an  
answer to anobjeftion which has been deduced from the circum­  
stance here taken notice of; namely, the income resulting ta fo­  
reigners from the part of the stock owned by them, which has  
heen represented as tending to drain the country of its specie.  
In this objection, the original investment of the capital, and the  
conftantufe of it afterwards, seem both ro have been overlooked

mould be a fcauty or dcfe&amp;ive circulation.  
  
Bat the pofirive and permanent incrcafe or decrease of the pre­  
cious metals in a country, can hardly ever be a matter of indiffer­  
ence. A* the commodity taken in lieu of every other, it is a fpe-  
Cies of the molt efFe&amp;ivc wealth; and as the money of the world,  
it is of great concern to the fiate, that it poflefles a fufficiency of  
it to lace any demands which the prote&amp;ion of its external ioter­  
elfs may create.  
  
Tuc obj ftion seems to admit of another and a more Conclulive  
infwer, which controverts the faftitfelf. A nation that has no  
mines of us own, must derive the precious metals from others;  
generally (peaking, in exchange for the produas of its labour and  
indultry. The quantity it will possess will therefore, in the 0r­  
;,7/1 of things, be regulated by the favorable orunfavor­  
t-r &#x27; ancc °f 115 trade ; that is, by the proportion between its  
abilities to .upply foreigners, and its wants of them ; between  
me amount of itsexporutions and that of itsimportations. Hence  
the 1 ate of its agriculture and manufaflures, the quantity and  
tf n lts labour and ituluftry must, in the main, influence  
and determ.nc the incrcafe or decrease ol it* gold and ftlver.  
hank/f ™c&gt;the ,nference seems to be, that well couftituted

THE fuppoit of industry is probably in ♦-Very cafe, of more  
consequence towards corre6ling a wrong balance of trade,  
than any pra&amp;icable retrenchments in the expences of families or  
individuals : and the stagnation of it would be likely to have  
more effedfc in prolonging, than any such savings in ftiortening its  
coutinuance. That stagnation is a natural consequence of an in­  
adequate medium, which, without the aid of bank circulation,  
&quot;would in the cases supposed, be severely felt.  
It also defervcs notice, that as the circulation of a bank is al-  
in a compound ratio to the fund upon which it depends,  
and to the demand for ir, and as that fund is itfelf affe&amp;ed by the  
exportation of the metals, there is no danger of its being over­  
flocked , as in the cafe of paper iflued at the pleasure of the go­  
vernment ; or of its preventing the consequences of any unfavor­  
able balance from being fufficiently felt to produce the reforms  
alluded to, as far as circumstances may require and admit.  
Nothing can be more fallible than the comparisons which have  
been made between different countries, to illustrate the truth of  
the position under confederation. The comparative quantity of  
gold and silver, in different countries, depends upon an infinite  
variety of fa&amp;s and combinations, all of which ought to be  
known in order to judge whether the existence or non-existence  
of paper currencies has any (hare in the relative proportions they  
contain. The majs and value of the productions of thfe labour and  
industry of each, compared with its wants ; thenaturcof its es­  
tablishments abroad : the kind of wars in which it is usually en­  
gaged : the relations it bears to the countries, which are the ori­  
ginal pofTeffors of those metals ; the* privileges it enjoys in their  
trade; these and a number of other circumstances are all to be ta­  
ken into the account, and render the investigation too complex to  
juftify any reliance on the vague and general surmises, which have  
been hitherto hazarded on the point.  
In the foregoing difcuflion, theobjeflion has been conftdered as  
applying to the permanent expulsion and diminution of the metals.  
Their temporary exportation, for particular purposes, has not  
been contemplated. This, it mud be confeffed is facilitated by  
banks, from the faculty they poftefs of fupplyirigtheir place. But  
their utility is in nothing more conspicuous, than in these very  
cases. They enable the government to pay its foreign debts, and  
to anfwerany exigencies which the external concerns of the com­  
munity may have produced. They enable the merchant to sup­  
port his credit (on which the prosperity of trade depends) when  
special circumstances prevent remittances iri other moc!~es. They  
enable him also to profecutc enterprizes, which ultimately tend to  
an augmentation of the fpecics of wealth in question. It is evi­  
dent, that gold and silver may often be employed in procuring  
commodities abroad ; which, in a circuitous commerce, replace  
the original fund, with considerable addition. But it is not to  
be inferred from this facility given to temporary exportation,  
that banks which are so si iendly to tradeand industry, are in their  
general tendency, inimical to the encreafe of the precious metals.  
These several views of the subjeCt appear fufficient to impress a  
fuil conviction of the utility of banks, and to demonstrate that  
they are of great importance, not only in relation to the admini­  
stration of the finances, but in the general system of the political  
economy.  
The judgment of many concerning them has no doubt been per­  
plexed, by the misinterpretation of appearance s, which were to be  
ascribed to other causes. The general devastation of personal  
property, occasioned by the late war, naturally produced on the  
one hand, a great demand for mojiey? and on the other a great de­  
ficiency of it to answer the demand. Some injudicious laws,  
■which grew out of the public diftrcflcs, by impairing confidcnce  
and causing a part of the inadequate sum in the country to be lock­  
ed up, aggravated the evil : The diflipated habits, contra&amp;ed by  
many individuals, during the war, which after the peace plunged  
them into expences beyond their incomes: The number of ad-  
  
venturers without capital, and in many instances without irifor­  
mation, who at that epoch rushed into trade, and were obliged to  
make any facrificcs tofupport a transient credit : The employment  
of confidcrable sums in speculations upon the public debt, which  
from its unsettled state was incapable of becoming itfelf a fubfti­  
tutc : All these circumstances concurring, necefiarily led to usuri­  
ous borrowing, pioduccd most of the inconveniences, and were  
the true causes of most of the appearances ; which, where banks  
were established, have been by some erroneously placed to their  
account; a mistake which they might eaftly have avoided by turn­  
ing their eyes towards places where there were none, and where,  
nevertheless, the fame evils would have been perceived to exist,  
  
even in a greater degree than where those institutions had ob  
tained. .  
  
I hcfe evils have either ceased, or been greatly mitigated. Their  
more complete cxtin&amp;ion may be looked for from that additional  
security to property, which the constitution of the United States  
happily gives (a circumstance of prodigious moment in the scale  
both of public and private prosperity) from the of fo­  
reign capital, under the aufpiccs of that security, to be employed  
upon objects and in cnterprifes, for which the state of this country  
opens a wide and inviting field, from the consistency and stability,  
which the public debt is fact acquiring, as well in the public opi­  
nion at home and abroad, as in fa 61; from the augmentation of  
capital, which that circumstance and the quarter-yearly payment  
of in*ereft will afford; and from the niore copious circulation,  
&quot;which will be likely to be created by a weil-conftituted national  
bank.  
  
The establishment of banks in this country seems to be recom­  
mended by reasons of a peculiar nature. Previously to the revo­  
lution, circulation was in a great measure carried on by paper emit­  
ted by the fevpal local governments. In Pcnnfylvania alone, the  
quantity of it was near a million and a half of dollars. This aux­  
iliary may be said to be now at an end. And it is generally sup­  
posed, that there has been for some trme pad, a deficiency of cir­  
culating medium. How far that deficiency is to be confidcred as  
real or imaginary, is not susceptible of dcmonflratiori ; but there  
are circumstances and appearances, which, in relation to the coun­  
try at large, countenance the supposition of its reality.  
The circumstances.are, besides faftjuft mentioned refpeft­  
mgpaper emissions, the vast traflsof waste land, and the little ad­  
vanced slate of manufactures. The progrefßve fettlcmcnt of the  
former, while it promifesample retribution, in the generation of  
future rcfourccs, diminishes or obftrufls, in the mean time, the  
aSire wealth of the country. It not only draws off a part o&#x27;f the  
circulating money, and places it in a more paflive ftatr, but it di­  
verts into us own channels a portion of that fpec&#x27;es of labour and  
mduftry, which would otherwise be employed in fumifhirig ma­  
terials lor foreign trade, and which by contributing to a favorable  
balance, would a {fill the introduftidn of fpccie. In the early  
periods of new fettlemcnts, the fcttlers not only furnifh no sur­  
plus for exportation, but they confumea part of that which is  
produced by the labour of oLhers. The Curie thing is a cause,  
that manufactures do not advance, or advance/lowly. And not­  
withstanding foroe hypotheses to the contrary, there are many  
  
k in a u^P:cion, that the precious metals will not  
.iQotind in any country which has not mines, or variety of ma­  
nufactures. Tncy have been sometimes acquired by the sword ;  
.&gt;ut the modern fyftern of war has expelled this resource ; and it  
ii one upon which the United States will never be inclined to  
rely.  
  
I he appearances alluded 10, arc, greater prevalcncy of direst  
ja.ttr, in the more interior dillri&amp;s of the country, which how­

rea ritaie, which also have of late diminilhed, but is still feri­  
ouilyle.t in different parts of the Union. The difficulty of get­  
ing money, which has been a general complaint, is not added to  
the number; because it is the complaint of all times, and one in  
appeal&#x27;to •f&quot;&gt;atlon mUst cv&quot; have too gf«t scope to permit an  
If the fuppofitionof such a deficiency be in any degree founded,  
and lome aid to circulation be desirable, it remains lo inquire  
what ought to be the nature of that aid.  
Remitting °f paper money by the authority of government  
i c y prohibited to the individual States, by the national con­  
u ion. And the spirit of that prohibition ought not to bedif­  
&quot;garded by ihe government of the United States. Though pa-

y S emergencies, there is almost a moral certainty of its be­  
&quot;&quot;,n® mifch&#x27;evous. The stamping of paper is an operation so  
nf&#x27; laying of taxes, that a government, in the

The payment of the ifttercfV of the public debt, at thirteen  
different places, is a weighty reason, peculiar to oar imme­  
diate fituaiion, for desiring a bank circulation. Without a pa­  
per, in general currency, equivalent to gold and silver, a consider­  
able proportion of the specie of the country must always be sus­  
pended from circulation, and left tc accumulate, preparatorily to  
cach day of payment; and as often as one approaches, there must  
in several cafcs be an actual transportation of the metals at both  
expence and rifle, from their natural and proper reservoirs to dis­  
tant places. This nect&#x27;ffity will be felt very injuriously to the  
trade of some of the Slates ; and will embarrass not a little the  
operations of the treasury in those States. It will also obftru£l  
those negociations, between different parts of the union, by the  
inftrumcntality of treasury bills, which have already afforded va­  
luable accommodations to trade in general.  
  
Affummg it then as a contequence from what has been said,  
that a national bank is a desirable institution, two enquiries em­  
erge—ls there no such institution, aJready in being, which has a  
claim to that character, and which fupercedes the propriety or  
neceflity of another ? If there be none, what are the principles  
upon which one ought to beeftablifhed ?  
  
There are at present three banks in the United States : That of  
North-America, eftabhihed in the city of Philadelphia; that of  
New-Yoik, eftablilhed in the city ot New-York ; that of Mafla­  
ehufetts, established in the town of Boston. Of these three, the  
firft is the only one which has at any time had a direst relation to  
the government of the United States.  
  
The bank of North America originated in a resolution of Con­  
gress of the 26th of May, 1781, founded upon a proposition of the  
fuperintendant of finance, which was afterwards carried into ex­  
ecution by an ordinance of the 31ft of December following, en­  
titled, u An oidinance to incorporate the fubferibers to the bank  
of North-America.&quot;  
  
The aid afforded to the United States by this institution, during  
the remaining period of the war, was of cffential   
and its conduct towards them since the peaee, has not wrakened&#x27;  
its title to their patronage and favour. So far its pretensions to  
the charatter in question are refpe&amp;able ; but there are circum­  
flances which militate against them ; and confederations which in­  
dicate the propriety of an establishment on different principles.  
The dire&amp;ors of this bank, on behalf of theii*conftituents, have  
fincc accepted and aded under a new charter from the State of  
Pennfylvauia, materially variant from their original one; and  
&quot;which so narrows the foundation of the institution, as to render it  
an incompetent basis for the extensive purpofesofa national bank.  
The limit assigned by the ordinance ofCongrefs to the stock of  
the bank, is ten millions of dollars. The last charter of Penn­  
lylvania confincs it to two millions. Questions naturally arise,  
■whether there be not a dirett repugnancy between two charters so  
differently circumstanced ; and whether the acceptance of the one  
is not to be deemed a virtual surrender of the other. But per­  
haps it is neither advifeabie nor necessary to attempt a solution of  
them.  
  
There is nothing in the a£l* of Congress, which imply an ex­  
clusive right in the institution to which they relate, except during  
the term of the war. There is therefore no:hing, if the public  
good require it, which prevents the eftabliftiment of another. It  
may however be incidentally remarked, that in thegeneralopinion  
of the citizens of the United States, the bank of North-America  
has taken the station of a bank of Pennsylvania only. This is a  
flrong argument for a new institution, or for a renovation of the  
old, toreftore it to the fuuation in which it originally flood, in  
the view of the United States.  
  
But tho&#x27; the ordinance of Congress contains no grant of exclu­  
sive privileges, there may be room to alledge, that the government  
of the United States ought not, in point of candour and equity, to  
cftablifh any rival or interfering institution, in prejudice of the  
one already established ; especially as this has, from services ren­  
dered, well-foundbd claims to protection and regard.  
The justice of such an observation ought within proper bounds  
to be admitted. A new of the fort ought not to be  
made, without cogent and sincere reasons of public good. And  
in the manner of doing it, every facility ftiould be given to a con­  
solidation of the old with the new, upon terms not injurious to  
the parties concerned. But there is no ground to maintain, that  
in a cafe in which the- government has made no condition re­  
ilri&amp;ing its authority, it ought voluntarily to reftrift it, through  
regard to the interests of a particular institution, when thoft* of the  
Sutc di&amp;ate a different course; especially too after such circum­  
ilances have intervened, as chara&amp;erue the adlual fuuation ot the  
bank of North-America.  
  
Th£ inducements to a new disposition of the thing arc now to  
be corifidered. The firft of them which occurs is, the, at least  
ambiguous, situation in which the bank of North-America has  
placed itfclf, by the acceptance of its lalV charter. If this has ren­  
dered it the mere bank of a particular slate, liable to diflblution  
at the expiration of fourteen years, to which term the ast of that  
slate has reftri&amp;ed its duration, it would be neither si». nor expe­  
dient to accept it as an equivalent for a bank of the United States.  
  
The reflri&amp;ion of its capital alfd, which, according to the fame  
iuppofnion, cannot be extended beyond two millions of dollars,  
is a conclusive reason for a different eftabliftiment. So small a ca­  
pital promises neither the requisite aid to government, nor the re­  
quisite fccurity to the community. It may answer ver&quot; well the  
purposes of local accommodation, but is an inadequate foundation  
for a circulation co-exteiifive with the United States; embracing  
the whole of their revenues&#x27;, and affetting every individual into  
whose hands the paper may come.  
  
And inadequate as fiich a capital would be to the eflential ends  
of a national bank, it is liable to b£ rendered still more so, by that  
principle of the constitution of the bank of Nonh-Ameriea, con­  
tained equally in its old and in its new chatter, which leaves the  
mcrcafe of the afilual capital at any time (now far short of the al­  
lowed extent) to the discretion of the directors or stockholders.  
Jt is naturally to be expe&amp;ed, that the allurements of an advanced  
price or stock, and of large may difinclme those who  
are intcrefted, to an cxtenfion of capital; from which they will be  
apt to fear a diminution of profits. And from this circumstance,  
the interest: and accommodation of the public (as well individu­  
ally as collettively) are made more subordinate to the interest,  
real or imagined, of the stock holders, than they ought to be&#x27;. It  
is true, that unless the tatter be confuhed, there can be no bank  
(in the sense at lead in which institutions of this kind, worthy of  
confidence, can be established in this country.) But it does not  
follow, that this is alone to be confultcd, or that it even ought to  
be paramount. Public utility is more truly the object of public  
banks, than private profit. And it is the business of government,  
to con&amp;itute them on such principles, that while the latter will re­  
sult, in a fufficient degree, to afford competent motives to engage  
in them, the former be not made subservient to it. To efFect this,  
a principle object of attention ought to be to give free fcopc to  
the creation of an ample capital ; and with this view, fixing the  
Wounds, which are deemed lafe and convenient, to leave no diC­  
  
crction either to flop fliort of them or to overpass them. The  
want of this precaution, in the establishment of the bank of North-  
America, is a further aud an important reason for desiring one  
differently constituted.  
There may be room at firft fight for a supposition, that as the  
profit* of a bank will bear a proportion to the extent of its ope­  
rations, and as, for this reason, the interell of the stockholders will  
&#x27;not be difadvantageoufly affc&amp;ed by any ncceffary augmentations  
of capital, there is no cause to apprehend that they will be indis­  
posed to such augmentations. But molt men in matters of this  
nature, prefer the certainties they enjoy, to probabilities depend­  
ing on untried experiments ;.efpecially when tbcfc promise rather,  
that they will not be injured, than that they will be benefited.  
From theinfluence of this principle, and a desire of enhancing  
its profits, the dife&amp;ors of a bank will be more apt to overstrain  
its faculties, in an attempt to face the additional demands, which  
the course of bufincft may create, than to set on foot new fubferip­  
t ions, which may hazard a diminution of the profits, and even a  
temporary redu£tiunof the price 6f flock

BANKS arc among the bed expedients for lowering the rate of  
interest in a country ; but to have this effect, their capitals  
must be completely equal to all the demands of business, and such  
as will tend to remove the idea, that the accommodations they af­  
ford, are in any degree favors ; an idea very apt to accompany  
the parsimonious dispensations of contra&amp;ed funds. I* this, as in  
every other cafe, the plenty of the commodity ougV.t to beget a  
moderation of the price.  
7 he want of a principle of rotation, in the constitution of the  
bank, of North-America, is another argument for a variation of  
the eftabliHiment. Scarcely one of the reasons which militate  
agamfl this principle in the conflitution of a country, is applica­  
ble to that of a bank ; while there are strong reasons in favor of  
it, in relation to the one, which no doubt apply to the other.  
The knowledge to be derived from experience is the only circum­  
flance common to both, which pleads against rotation in the di­  
re&amp;ing officers ot a bank.  
  
But the obje&amp;s of the government of a nation, and those of the  
government of a bank, arc so widely different, as greatly to weak­  
en the force of that confider3tion, iu reference to the latter. Al­  
most every important caf; of legislation requires, towards a right  
decision, a general and accurate acquaintance with the affairs of  
the State; and habits of thinking seldom acquired, but from a  
familiarity of public concerns. The adminiilration of a bank, on  
the contrary, is regulated bv a few simple fixed maxims, the ap­  
plication of which is not difficult to any man of judgment, efpe­  
eially if inflru&amp;ed in the principles of trade. It is in general a  
constant fucceflion of the fame details.  
  
But though this be the cafe, the idea of the advantages of ex­  
perience is not to be flighted. Room ought to be left for the re­  
gular tianfmiffion of official information. And for this purpose,  
the head of the direction ought to be excepted from the principle  
of rotation. With this exception, and with the aid of the in­  
formation of the subordinate officers, there can be no danger of  
any ill effe£ls from want of experience, or knowledge ; especially  
«ts the periodical exclusion ought not to reach the whole of the di­  
re£lors at one time.  
  
The argument in favor of the principle of rotation is this, that  
by leflening the danger of combinations among the dirc6lors, to  
make the inflitution subservient to party views,or to the accommo­  
dation, preferably, of any particular set of men, it will render  
the public confidence more firm, stable and unqualified.  
When it is considered, that the diie£lors of a bank are not eie&amp;-  
cd by the great body of the community, in which a diversity of  
views will naturally prevail, at different conjun£tures, but by a  
small and fele6l class of &quot;men, among whom it is far more easy to  
cultivate a steady adherence to the fame peifons and obje£is ; and  
that those dire&amp;ors have it in their power so immediately to con­  
ciliate, by obliging the most influential of this class, it is easy to  
perceive, that without the principle of rotation, changes in that  
body can rarely happen, but as a concession which they may them­  
fclves think it expedient to make to public opinion.  
The continual adminiilration of an institution of this kind, by  
the fame persons, will never fail, with or without cause, from  
their conduct, to excite diflruft and discontent. The necefTarv  
secrecy of their tranfa£lions, gives unlimited scope to imagination  
to infer that fomcthmg is, &lt;;r may be wrong. And this inevitable  
mystery is a lolid rcafon for inserting in the conflitution of a bank  
the nr ceffity of a change of men. As neither the mass of the pai­  
ties intercfted, nor the public in general, can be permitted to be  
■witnefits of the interior management of the,directors, it is rea­  
sonable that both should have that check upon their condu£l, and  
that security against the prevalency of a partial or pernicious sys­  
tem, which will beproduced by the ccrtainty of periodical changes.  
Such too is the delicacy of the credit of a bank, that every thing  
■which can fortify confidence and repel suspicion, without injuring  
its operations, ought carefully to be fought after in its formation.  
  
A further confederation in favour of a change, is the improper  
rule, by which the right of voting for dire&amp;ors is regulated in the  
plan, upon which the bank of North-America was originally  
eonftituted, namely, a vote for each ftiare, and the want of a rule  
in the last charter; unless the silence of it, on that pointy may fig­  
fiify that every stockholder is to have an equal and fir.glc vote,  
-which would be a rule in a different extreme, not less erroneous.  
It is of importance that a rule should be cftablifhed on this head,  
as it is one of those things which ought not to be left to discre­  
tion; and it is consequently of equal importance, that the rule  
should be a proper one.  
A vote for each share, renders a combination between a few  
principal stockholders, to monopolize the power and benefits of  
the bank, too easy. An equal vote to each stockholder, however  
♦rreat or small his interest in the institution, allows not that degree  
cf weight to large stockholders, which it is reasonable they Ihould  
liave, and vvhich perhaps their security and that of the bank re­  
quire. A prudent mean is to be preferred. A convitlion of this  
has produced a bye-law of the corporation of the bank of North-  
America, which evidently aims at such a mean. But ar&lt; flection  
arises here, that a like majority with that which cnatted this law,  
may at any moment repeal it,  
  
The last inducement which shall be mentioned, is the want of  
&gt;recautions to guard against a foreign influence infinuatiug itfelf  
nto the dire&amp;ion of the bank. It fecms fcarccly reconcileable  
vith a due caution, to permit that any but citizens should be eli­  
;ible, as di&#x27;e&amp;ors of a national bank, or that non-resident foreign­  
:rs should be able to influence the appointment of dire&amp;ors, by  
he votestheir proxies. In the event, however, of an incorpo­  
ration of the bank of North-America, in the plan, it mav be ne­  
ceflary to qualify this principle, so as to leave the right of f rsign­  
ers, who now hold (hares of its stock, unimpaired ; but without  
the power of transmitting the privilege in question, v.o foreign  
alienees.  
  
It is to be considered, that such a bank is not a mere matter of  
private property, but a political machine of the greatest. import­  
ance to the state.  
  
There are other variations from the conftitutiori of the bank of  
North-America, not of inconsiderable moment, which appear de­  
arable, but which are not of magnitude enough to claim a preli­  
minary difcuflion. These will be seen in the plan which will be  
submitted in the sequel.  
If the obje&amp;ions which have been stated, to the conflitution ot  
the bank of Worth-America, are admitted to be well founded, they  
-will nevertheless not derogate fiom the merit of the main design,  
or of the services which that bank has rendered, or of the benefits  
■which it has produced. The creation of such an inftirution, at the  
time it took place, was a mcafure d&#x27;ftated by wisdom. Its utility  
has been amply cvinced by its fruits—American independence  
owes much to it—and it is very conceivable, that reasons of the  
moment mav have rendered those features in it inexpedient, which  
a revision, with a permanent view, suggests as desirable.  
  
The order of the fubjett leads next to an inquiry into the prin­  
ciples upon which a national bank ought to be organized.  
&quot;f Jic fituarioni of the United States naturally infpircs a wifli, that  
  
the form of the institution could admit of a plurality of branches.  
But various confederations discourage from pursuing this idea. The  
complexity of such a plan would be apt to inspire doubts, which  
might deter from adventuring in it. And the pra£licabilit)*of a  
fafc and ordtrly adminiflration, though not to be abandoned as  
desperate, cannot be made so manifeft in ncrfpe£tive, ai&#x27;to pro­  
mile the removal of those doubts, or to juflify the government in  
adopting the idea as an original experiment. The most that would  
feein advifeable, on this point, is to insert a provision, which may  
lead f.o it hereafter ; if experience fhali more clearly demonstrate  
i&#x27;s utility, and fatisfy those who may have the dire£lion,that it may  
be adopted with fafety. It is certain, that it would have fomc  
.advantages, both peculiar and important, fides more general  
accommodation, it would lessen the danger of a run upon the  
bank.  
  
The argument against it is, that each branch must be under a  
fiiftinft, though subordinate direttion, to which a considerable la­  
titude of discretion mult of necefluy be entrnfted. And as th&lt;_  
property of the whole inflitupion would be liable for the engage-  
ot each part, that and its cr dit would be at flake, upon the  
prudence of the dire&amp;ors of every&#x27;part. The mismanagement oJ  
either branch might hazard serious dilorder in the whole.  
Another wish, di&amp;ated by t)ie particular fnuation of the coun­  
try, is, that the bank could be so conftitutcd as to be made an im­  
mediate inilrument of loans to the proprietors of land ; but this  
wish alio yields to the difficulty of accomplishing it. Land is  
alone an unfit fund for a bank circulation. If the notes iflued  
upon it were not to be payable in coin, on demand, or at a short  
date, this would amount to nothing more than a repetition of the  
paper emiflions, which are now exploded by the general voice.  
If the notes are to be payable in coin, the.land must firft be con­  
verted into it by sale, or mortgage. The difficulty of effecting the  
latter, is the very th&#x27;ng which begets the desire of finding another  
resource, and the former would not be practicable on a sudden  
emergency, but with facrifices which would make the cure worse  
than the difcafe. Neither is the idea of constituting the fund part­  
ly of coin and partly of land, free from impediments. Thefetwo  
species of property do not, for the most part, unite in the fame  
hands. Will the monied man confeat to enter into a partnership  
with the landholder, by which the latter wi.l lhare in the profits  
which zvill be madefy the money of the former ? The money, it is  
evident, will be the agent or efficient cause of the profits—the land  
can only be regarded as an additional security. It is not difficult  
to forefee, that an union, on iuch terms, will not readily be form­  
ed. If the landholders are to procure the money by the sale or  
mortgage of a part of their lands, this they can as well do, when  
the itock confilts wholly oi money, as if it were Lo be compound­  
ed of money and land.

In obedience to the order of the House of Re­  
presentatives of&quot; the prb Day of August lad,  
requiring the Secretary of the Treasury  
to prepare and report, on this Day, luch fur­  
ther Provision as may, in his opinion, be ne­  
ceflary for establishing the PUBLIC CREDIT  
—the said Secretary further  
Respectfully reports,  
(continued from our last.)  
TO procure for the landholders the afliftance of loans, is the  
great deftderatum. Suppofingother diiSculties lurmounted,  
and a fund created, composed partly of coin and partly of land,  
vet the benefit contemplated could only then be obtained, by the  
bank&#x27;s advancing them its notes for the whole, or part, of the va­  
lue of the lands they had subscribed to the flock. If this advance  
&quot;was small, the relief aimed at would not be given ; if it was  
large, the quantity of notes iflued would be a cause of diftruji, and  
if received at all, they would be likely to return speedily upon the  
bank for payment ; which, after exhausting its coin, might be  
under a neceflity of turning its lands into money, at any price that  
could be obtained for them, tf&gt; the irreparable prejudice of the  
proprietors.  
  
Confiderationsof public advantage fugged a further wifh,wh&#x27;ch  
is, thar the bank could be established upon principles, that would  
cause the profits of it to redound to the immediate benefit of the  
State. This is contemplated by many, who speak of a national  
bank, but the idea seems liable to insuperable obje&amp;ions. To at­  
tach full confidenceto an institution of this nature, it appears to  
be an eflential ingredient in its ftru&amp;ure, that it shall be under a  
private not a public dire&amp;ion, under the guidance of individual in­  
tcrejl, not of public policy ; which would be supposed to be, and in  
certain emergencies, under a feeble or too fauguine administra­  
tion, would really be, liable to being too much influenced by  
public ncccfjity. The suspicion of this would probably be a canker,  
that would continually corrode the vitals of the bank, and would  
be molt likely to prove fatal in those situations, in which the  
public good would require, that they should be moll found and  
vigorous. It would indeed be little less than a miracle, (hould  
the credit of the bank be at the disposal of the government if in a  
longferiesof time, there was not experienced a calamitous abuse  
of it. It is true, that it would be the real interefl of the govern­  
ment not to abuse it ; its genuine policy to husband and cherilh  
it with the moll guarded circumfpeftion, as an inestimable trea­  
lure. But what government ever uniformly consulted its tiue in­  
terests, in opposition to the temptationsof momentary exigencies ?  
What nation was ever bleffec? with a constant fuccellion of up­  
right and wife administrators ?  
  
The keen, steady, and as it were magnetic sense of their own  
interest as proprietors, in the dire&amp;ors of a bank, pointing in­  
variably to its true pole, the prolperity of the institution, is the  
only security that can always be relied upon for a careful and pru­  
dent administration. It is therefore the only basis on which an  
enlightened, unqualified and permanent confidence can be expeft­  
cd to beere&amp;ed and maintained.  
The precedents of the banks eftabiifhed in several cities of Eu­  
rope, Amsterdam, Hamburgh and others, may seem to militate  
against this position. Without a precise knowledge of all the pe­  
culiarities of their refpe&amp;ive constitutions, it is difficult to pro­  
nounce how far this may be the cafe. That of Amsterdam how­  
ever, which we bell know is rather under a municipal than a go­  
vernmental direction. Particulai magillrates of the city, not of­  
ficers of the republic, have the management of it. It is also a  
bank of deposit, not of loan, or circulation; consequently less  
liable to abuse, as well as less ufeful. Its general business con-  
  
fills in receiving money for fafe keeping, which if not called for  
  
within a certain time, becomes a part of its flock, and irreclaim­  
able : But a credit is given for it on the books of the bank, which  
being transferable, anfweis all the purposes of money.  
The dire&amp;ors being magistrates of the city, and the stockholders  
in general its most influential citizens, it is evident, that the prin­  
ciple of private interest mud be prevalent in the management of  
the bank. And it is equally evident, that from the nature of its  
operations, that principle is less essential to if, than to an institu­  
tion constituted with a view to the accommodation of the public  
and individuals, by dire£l loans and a paper circulation.  
As far as may concern the aid of the bank, within the proper li­  
mits, a good government has nothing more to wifli for, than it  
•will always poflefs ; though the management be in the hands of  
private individuals. As the institution, if rightly constituted, mull  
  
depend for its renovation from time to time on the pleasure of the  
  
government, it will not be likely to feel a disposition to render it­  
felf by its condufl unworthy of public patronage. The govern­  
ment too, in the administration of its finances, has it in its power  
to reciprocate benefits to the bank, of not less importance than  
those which the bank affords to the government, and which be­  
sides are never unattended with an immediate and adequate com­  
pensation. Independent of these more particular confederations,  
the natural weight and influence of a good government will al­  
ways go far towards procuring a compliance with its desires; and  
as the directors will usually be compoied of some of the moll dis­  
creet, refpc£lable and well-informed citizens, it can hardly ever  
be difficult to make them sensible of the force of the inducements  
•which ought to stimulate their exertions.  
  
It will not follow from what has been said, that the state may  
not be the holder of a part of the {lock of a bank, and confequerit­  
ly a sharer in the profits of it. It will only follow that it ought  
not to desire any participation in the direction of it, aud therefore  
ought not to own the whole or principal part of the flock ; for if  
the mass of their property fliould belong to the public, and if the  
direction of it should be in private hands, this would be to com­  
mit the interests of the state to persons not interested, or not  
enough interested in their proper management.  
  
There is one thing, however, which the government owes to it­  
felf and to the community ; at least to all that part of it, who are  
not stockholders; which is to reserve to itfelf a right of ascertain­  
ing, as often as may be neceftary, the ftite of the bank, excluding  
however all pretention to controul. This right forms an article in  
the primitive constitution of the bank of North-America ; and its  
propriety stands upon the eleareft reasons. If the paper of a bank  
is to be permitted to insinuate itfelf into all the icvenues and re­  
ceipts of a country ; if it is even substituted for gold and fiJver in  
all the tranfattions of business, it becomes in either view a nati­  
onal concern of the firft magnitude. As such, the ordinary rules  
of prudence require, that the government should poflefs the means  
of ascertaining, whenever it thinks fit, that so delicate a trust is ex­  
ecuted with fidelity and care. A right of this nature is not only  
defirabJe as it refpe£ls the government; but it ought to be equally  
so to all thofc concerned in the institution; as an additional title  
to public and private confidence; and as a thing which can only  
be formidable to practices that imply mismanagement. The pre­  
emption mull always be, that the c.hara6lers who would be en­  
trusted with the exercise of this right on behalf of the govern­  
ment, will not be deficient in the discretion which it may require;  
at least the admitting of this presumption cannot be deemed too  
great a return of confidence tor that very 1 rge portion of it which  
the government is required to place in the bank.  
Abandoning therefore ideas, which however agreeable or desi­  
rable, are neither pra&amp;icable nor fafe; the following plan for the  
constitution of a National Bank, is refpe£tfuiiy submitted to the  
confidcration of the house.

I.&#x27; I IHE capital flock of the bank shall not exceed ten millions

In obedience to the order of the House of Re­  
presentatives of the 9th Day of August last,  
requiring the Secretary of the TrbasurY  
to prepare and report, on this Day, such fur­  
ther Provision as may, in his opinion, be ne­  
ceflary for eftabliftiing the PUBLIC CREDIT  
—the said Secretary further  
Respectfully reports,  
THAT from a conviction (as fuggelled in liij Report No. I,  
herewith prcfented) thai a National bank is an initiation ot  
primary importance to the prosperous admmiftration »f the Fi­  
nances, and would be of the greatcft utility in the operations con­  
nected with the support of the Public Credit, his attention has  
been drawn to devising the plan of such an institution, upon a  
scale which will entitle it to the confidence, and be likely to ren­  
der it equal to the exigencies of the public.  
Previously to entering upon the detail of this plan, he entreats  
the indulgence of the House, towaids some preliminaiy reflec­  
tions naturally arising out of the fubjeft, which he hopes will be  
deemed neither useless nor out of place. Public opinion being  
the ultimate arbiter|ot every measure of government, it can scarcely  
appear improper, in deference to that, to accompany the origina­  
tion of any new proportion with explanations, which the superi­  
or information ot thofeto whom it is immediately addrelTed,  
would render fuperflutras. r j j  
It is a fail well understood, that public banks havu found ad­  
mission and patronage among the principal and most enlightened  
commercial nations. They have successively obtained in Italy,  
Germany, Holland, England and France, as well as in t£e United  
States. And it is a circumftancc which cannot but haveconfider­  
able weight, in a candid eftimateof their tendency, that after an  
experience of centuries, there exists not a question about their  
utility in the countries, in which they have been so long establish­  
ed. Tbeorifls and meu of bufiaefj the acknowledgment  
°f Trade and induftrv, wherever they have been tried, have been  
indebted to them for important aid. And government has been  
repeatedly under the greatest obligations to them, in dangerous  
and diftreOing emergencies. That of the United States, as well  
in some of the most critical conjunctures of the late war, as since  
the peace, has received afliftance from those established among us,  
With which it could not have difpenftd.  
With this two-fold evidence before us, it might be expected,  
that there would be a perfect union of opinions in their favor.  
Yet doubts have been entertained ; jcaloufies and prejudices have  
circulated; and though the experiment is every day dissipating  
them, within the fphercs in which effefls are bed known; yet  
there are fttil persons by whom they have not been entirely re­  
nounced. To give a full and accurate view of the fubjeft, would  
be to make a treatise of a report; but there are certain afpefts in  
which it may be cursorily exhibited, which may perhaps conduce  
toajuftimpreffion of its merits. These will involve a comjjari­  
fon of the advantages, with the disadvantages, real or supposed,  
of such institutions.  
The following are among the principal advantages of a bank :—  
Firjl. The augmentation of the active or produ&amp;ive capital of a  
country. Gold and silver, where they are employed merely as  
the instruments of exchange and alienation, have been not impro­  
perly denominated dead flock; but when dcpofited in banks, to  
become thebafis of a paper circulation, which takes their charadler  
and place, as the signs or representations of value, they then acqui re  
life, or, in other words, an active and productive quality. This  
idea, which appears rather subtil and abftraft, in a general form,  
may be made obvious and palpable, by entering into a lew parti­  
culars. It i« evident, for instance, that the money which a mer­  
chant keeps in his chest, waiting for a favorable opportunity to  
employ it, produces nothing till that oppottunity arrives. But if  
infteafttf locking it up in this manner, he either deposits it in a  
invests it in theftock of a bank, it yields a profit during  
the interval, in which he partakes, or not, according to the choice  
he&#x27;may have made of being adepolitor, or a proprietor; and when  
any advantageous speculation offers, inorderto be able to embrace  
it, he has only to withdraw his money, if a depositor, or if a pro­  
prietor, to obtain a loan from the bank, orto difpofeof his stock;  
an alternative seldom or never attetided with difficulty, when the  
affairs of the institution are in a prosperous train. His money thus  
or invested, is afund npon which himfelf and others can  
borrow to a much larger amount. It is a well established fafl,  
that banks in good credit can circulate a far greater sum than the  
actual quantum of their capital in gold and silver. The extent of  
the poflible excess seems indeterminate ; though it has bc.cu con­  
je&amp;urally stated at the proportions of two and three to one. This  
faculty is produced in various ways. Firjl—A great proportion  
of the notes which are issued and pass current as calh, are indefi­  
nitely suspended in circulation, from the confidence which eech  
holder has, that he can at any moment turn them into gold and  
silver. Secondly—Every loan which a bank makes, is, in itsfirft  
shape, a credit given to the borrower on its books, the amount of  
■which it Hands ready to pay, either in its own notes, or in gold or  
silver, at his option. But, in a great number of cases, no actual  
payment is madein either. The borrower, frequently,by a check,  
or order, transfers his credit to some other perfon,to whom he has  
a payment to make—who, in his turn, is as often content with  
a similar credit, because he is fatisfied that he can, whenever he  
pleases, either convert it into cash, or pass it to some other hand  
as an equivalent for it. And in this manner the credit keeps cir­  
culating, performing in every stage the office of money, till it is ex­  
tinguished by a discount with some person who has a payment to  
make to the bank, to an equal or greater amount. Thus large sums  
are lent and paid, frequently through a variety of hands, without  
the intetvention of a ungle piece of coin. Thirdly—There is al­  
ways a large quantity of gold and silver in the repositories of the  
bank, besides its own stock, which is placed there with a view,  
partly to its fafe-keeping, and partly to the accommodation of an  
institution. which is itfelf a source of general accommodation.  
These deposits are of immense consequence in the operations of a  
bank. Though liable to be re-drawn at any moment, experi­  
ence proves, that the money so much oftner changes proprietors  
than place, and that what isdr3wnout is generally so speedily  
replaced, as to authorize the counting upon the sums deposited,  
as an cjfe£iive fund; which concurring with the stock of the bank,  
enables it to extend its loans, ?nd to answer all the demands for  
coin, whether in consequence ot those loans, or arising from the  
occasional returns of its notes.  
  
These different circumftancesexplain the manner in which the  
ability of a bank to circulate a greater sum than its actual capita!  
in coin, is acquired. This however must be gradual; and rauft  
be preceded by a firm establishment of confidence ; a confidence  
•which taay be bestowed on the irioft rational grounds ; since the  
excess in question will always be bottomed on good (ecurity of  
one kind or another. This every well-condu£ted bank carefully  
requires, before it will consent to advance either its money or its  
credit, and where there is an auxiliary capital (as will be the cafe  
in the plan hereafter fubmilted) which, together with the capita 7  
in coin, define the boundary that (hall not be exceeded by the en  
gagementsof the bank, the security may, confidently with a!  
the maxims of a reasonable circumfpeftion, be regarded as con  
plete.  
  
The famecircumftances illustrate the truth of the position, that  
it is one of the properties of banks to increase the a&amp;ive capital of  
a country. This, in other words, is the sum of them. The mo­  
ney of one individual, while he is waiting for an opportunity to  
employ it, by being either deposited in the bank for fdfe-keep-  
  
ing, or inverted in its stock, is in a condition to adminifler to the  
wants of others, without being put out of his own reach when oc­  
calion prcfents. This yields an extra profit, arising from what is  
paid for the use of his money by others, when he could not him­  
ielf make use of it ; and keeps the money itfelf in a (late of incess­  
ant activity. In the almost infinite vicifiitudes and competitions oi  
mercantile enterprize, there never can be danger of an iotermif­  
fion of demand, or that the money will remain for a moment idle  
in the vaults of the bank. This additional employment given to  
money, and the faculty of a bank to lend and circulate a greater  
sum than the amount of its stock in coin, are to all the purposes  
of trade and industry an absolute increase of capital. Purchases  
and undertakings, in general, can be carried on by any given lum  
of bank paper or credit, as effectually as by an equal sum of gold  
and silver. And thus by contributing to enlarge the fwafsof in­  
duftiious and commercial enterprize, banks become nurseries of  
national wealth : a consequence, as fatisfaftoiily verified by ex­  
perience, as it is clearly cleducible in theory.

Secondly. Greater facility to the government in obtaining pecu­  
niary aids, especially in sudden emergencies. This is another and  
an undisputed advantage of public banks&#x27;: One, which as air adv  
remarked, has been realized in signal instances, among ourselves.  
The reason is obvious : Thecapitals of a great number of indivi­  
duals are, by this operation, collected to a point, an&#x27;d placed un­  
der one dire6lion. The mass, formed by this union, is in a cer­  
tain sense magnified by the credit attached to it. And while this  
mass is always ready, and can at once be put in motion, in aid of  
the government, the interest of the bank to afford that aid, inde­  
pendent of regard to the public fafety and welfare, is a sure pledge  
for its disposition to go as far in hs compliances, as can in pru­  
dence be dt fired. There is in the na ureof things,as will be more  
particularly noticed in another place, an intimate connexion of  
interest between the government and the bank of a nation.  
Thirdly. The facilitating bfthc payment of taxes. This advan­  
tage is produced in two ways. Tkofe who are i;i a situation to  
have access to the bank, can have the aflifiance of loans to answer  
with punctuality the public calls upon them. This accommoda­  
tion has been sensibly felt in the payment of the duties heretofore  
laid, by those who reside where establishments ot this nature exist.  
This, however, though an exteniive, is not an rriiverfal benefit.  
The other way in which the effe£t here contemplated is produ­  
ced, and in which the benefit is general, is the incrcafihg of the  
quantity of circulating medium,and the quickening of circulation.  
The manner in which the firft happens has already been traced.  
The last may require some illustration. When payments are to  
be made between different places, having an intercourse of busi­  
ness with each other, if there happen to be no private bills at mar­  
ket, and there are no bank notes which have a currency in both,  
the confcquence is that coin must be remitted. This is attended  
with trouble, delay, expcnce and risk. If on the contrary there  
are bank notes current in both places, the tranfiniflion of these by  
the post, or any otherfpeedv or convenient conveyance, answers  
the puipofc ; and these again, in the alternations of demand, are  
frequently returned very soon after to the place from whence they  
•were at firft sent; whence t.ie transportation and re-lranfporta­  
tion of the metals are obviated, and a more convenient and more  
expeditious medium of payment is substituted. Nor is this all :  
The metals, instead ofbeing suspended from their usual fur)6Hons,  
during this prpcefs of vibration from place to place, continue in  
activity, and administer still to the ordinary circulation ; which  
of course is prevented from fuffenng either diminution or stagna­  
tion. These circumstances are additional causes of what, in a  
prattical sense, or to the purpofeuof business, may be called great- i  
er plenty of money. And it is evident, that whatever enhances ,  
the quantity of circulating money adds to the ease with which  
every industrious member of the community may acquire that  
portion of it, of which he (lands in need ; and enables him the  
better to pay his taxes, as well as to supply his other wants. Even  
where the cirlulation of the bank paper is not general, it mufl still  
have the fame effe6l, though in a less degree. For whatever fur­  
nifties additional supplies to the channels of circulation, in one  
quarter, naturallycontributesto keep the streams fuller elsewhere. &#x27;  
This last view or the fubjett serves W&gt;th to illuflrate the position,  
that banks tend to facilitate the payment of taxes ; and to exem­  
plify their utility to business of every.kind, in which money is an  
agent.  
It would be to intrude too much on the patience of the house,  
to prolong the details of the advantages of banks; especially as  
all those, which mighc still be particularized, are readily to be in­  
ferred as consequences from thole which have been enumerated.  
Their disadvantages, real or supposed, are now to be reviewed.  
The most fcrious of the charges which have been brought againll  
them, are—  
  
That they serve to increase usury.  
  
That they tend to prevent other kindl? of lending,  
&#x27;fhattheyfumifli temptations to over-trading.  
  
That they afford aid to ignorant ac-venturers, who disturb the  
natural and beneficial courfe&quot;\f trade.  
  
That thcv give to bankrupt &#x27;and fraudulent traders a fictitious  
crcdit, which enables them to fnaintaiu falfc appearances, and to  
extend their impositions: And lastly,  
That they have a tendency tc banifti gold and silver from the  
country.  
There is great reason to believe, that on a close and candid sur­  
vey, it will be dlfcovercd, that Ihefe charges are either without  
foundation, or that, as far as the evils they suggest have beenfound  
to exist, they have proceeded from other, or partial, or tempo­  
rary cau(cs, arenot inherent in the nature and permanent tendency  
of such institutions, or are more than counterbalanced by opposite  
advantages. This (urvey shall be had in the order in which the  
charges have been stated. The fir It of them is,  
  
That banks serve to increase usury.  
It is a truth, which ought not to be denied, that the method of  
conducing business, which is efTential to bank opeiations, has,  
among us in particular instances, given occasion to usurious tranf­  
aftions. The punctuality in payments, which they neceffanly  
exact, has fomctimes obliged those who have adventured beyond  
both their capital and credit, to procure money, at any price, and  
consequently to resort to usurers for aid.  
  
But experience and practice gradually bring a cure to this evil.  
A general habit of puuttuality among traders, is the natural con­  
fluence of the neceflity of observing it with the bank ; a circum­  
stance which itfelf more than compensates for Sny occasional ill  
which may have sprung from that neceflity, in the particular un­  
der conlideration. As far therefor: as traders depend upon each  
other for pecuniary supplies, they can calculate their expectations  
with greater certainty; and are in proportionably less danger of  
aifappointments, which might compel them to have recoinfe to (o  
pernicious an expedient as that of borrowing at usury ; the mif­  
chiefs of which, after a few examples, naturally inspire great care  
in all but men of desperate circumstances, to avoid the poflibility  
of being fubjf&amp;ed to them. One, and not the least of the evils  
incident to the use of that expedient, if the fa ft be known, or even  
strongly fufpc&amp;ed, is loss of credit with the bank itfelf.  
  
The dire&amp;ors of a bank too, tho&#x27; in order to extend its bufmefs  
and its popularity, in the infancy of an institution, they may be  
tempted to go further in accommodations, than the ftri£t rules of  
prudence will warrant, grow more circumfpeft of course, as its  
affairs become better eftabliflied, and as the evils of too great fa­  
cility are experimentally demonstrated. They become more at­  
tentive to the situation and couduft of those with whom they deal •  
they obfervc more narrowly their operations and pursuits; they  
economize the credit they give to those of suspicious folitjity :  
they refufc it to those whose career is more manifeitly hazardous.  
In a word, in the course of pra&amp;ice, from the very nature of  
things, the interejl will make it the policy of a bank, to&#x27; succour the  
wary and induftnous ; to discredit the rash and unthrifty ; to dis­  
countenance both usurious lenders and usurious borrowers.  
  
There is a leading view, in which the tendency of banks will  
be fecn to be, to abridge rather than to promote usury. This re­  
  
lates to their property of incrcafmg the quantity and quickcning  
the circulation of money. If it be evident, that usury will pre­  
vail or diminifn, according to the proportion which the demand  
for borrowing bears to the quantity of money at market to be  
lent ; whatever has the property just mentioned, whether it be in  
the (hape of paper or Coin, by contributing to render the supply  
more equal to the demand, must tend to countera£l the progress  
of usury.  
  
But bank lending, it is pretended, is an impediment to other  
kinds of lending ; which, by confining the resource of borrowing  
to a particular class, leaves the reft of the community more dcfti­  
tute, zi.d therefore more cxpofed to the extortions ot usurers. As  
the profits of bank stock excced the legal rate of intercft, the pof­  
feflors of money, it is argued, prefer inverting it in that article to  
lending it at this rate ; to which there are the additional motives  
of a more prompt command of the capital, and of more frequent  
and exact returns, without trouble or perplexity in the collection.  
7 his constitutes the second charge which has been enumerated.  
The fatt on which this charge refls is not to be admitted with­  
out several qualifications ; particularly in reference to the Hate of  
things in this country. Firsl—The great bulk of the stock of a  
bank willconfift of the funds of men in trade, among ourselves,  
and monied foreigners; the former of whom could not spare their  
capitals out of their r ach, to be inverted in loans for long periods,  
on mortgages, or perfonalfecurity; and the latter of whom would  
nor be willing to befubjefted to the casualties, delays and embar­  
rafTments of luch a disposition of their money in a distant coun­  
trv. Secondly—There will always be a considerable proportion  
o. those who arc properly the money-lenders of a country, who  
from that spirit of caution which ulually charafterifes this des­  
cription of men, will incline rathei to vert their funds in mortga­  
ges on real cftate, than in the stock of a bank, which they are apt  
to consider as a more precarious security.  
Th fe cor.fiderations fervc in a material degree to narrow the  
foundation of theobjettion, as to the point of- faffc. But there is  
a more fatisfaftory answer to it. The c£Fe£t supposed, as far as it  
hasexiftcnce, is temporary. The reverse of it takes place in the  
general and permanent operation of the thing.

V  
THEcapital of every public bank will of course be reftri&amp;ed  
within a certain defined limit. It is the province of legisla­  
tive prudence so to adjust this limit, that while it will not be too  
contracted for the demand, which the r.ourfc of business may cre­  
ate, and for the security which the public ought to have for the so­  
lidity of the paper which may be ilTued by the bank, it will ftiJl  
be within the compass of the pecuniary resources of the commu­  
nity; so that there may bean easy practicability of completing the  
fubfeription? to it. When this is once done, the supposed etfeft  
of neceflity ceases. There is the#) no longer room for the invert,  
ment of any additional capital. Stock may indeed change hands  
by one perion felling and onother buying : but the money which  
the buyer takes out of the common mass to purchase the stock, the  
ieller receives and restores to it. Hence the future furpluffes  
which may accumulate, mult take their natural course, and lend­  
ing at interest muftgo on as it theie were no such inflitution.  
It rncft indeed floW in a more copious stream. The bank fur­  
nifhes an extraordinary supply for borrowers, within its imme­  
diate fphrre. A larger supply confequentiy remains for borrow­  
ers elsewhere. In proportion as the circulation of the bank is ex­  
tended, there is an augmentation of the aggregate mass of money  
for answering the aggregate mass of demand. Hence greater fa­  
cility in obtaining it for every purpose.  
It ought not to cfcape without a remark, that as far as the ci­  
tizens of other countries become adventurers in the bank, theie  
is a positive increase of the gold and silver of the country. It is  
true, that from this a half yearly rent is drawn back, accruing  
from the dividends upon the (lock. But as this rent arises from  
e employment of the capital, by our own citizens, it is proba­  
&#x27; that &quot; ,s more than replaced by the profits of that employ­  
ment. Itisalfe likely, that a part of it is, in the course of trade,  
converted into the products of our country: And it may even  
prove an incentive, in some cases, to emigration to a country in  
which the tha rafter of citizen is as easy to be acquired, as it is es­  
timable and important. This view of the fubjeft furnifnes an  
answer to anobjeftion which has been deduced from the circum­  
stance here taken notice of; namely, the income resulting ta fo­  
reigners from the part of the stock owned by them, which has  
heen represented as tending to drain the country of its specie.  
In this objection, the original investment of the capital, and the  
conftantufe of it afterwards, seem both ro have been overlooked

the enumerated objections. This must mean, that by affordin,

mould be a fcauty or dcfe&amp;ive circulation.  
  
Bat the pofirive and permanent incrcafe or decrease of the pre­  
cious metals in a country, can hardly ever be a matter of indiffer­  
ence. A* the commodity taken in lieu of every other, it is a fpe-  
Cies of the molt efFe&amp;ivc wealth; and as the money of the world,  
it is of great concern to the fiate, that it poflefles a fufficiency of  
it to lace any demands which the prote&amp;ion of its external ioter­  
elfs may create.  
  
Tuc obj ftion seems to admit of another and a more Conclulive  
infwer, which controverts the faftitfelf. A nation that has no  
mines of us own, must derive the precious metals from others;  
generally (peaking, in exchange for the produas of its labour and  
indultry. The quantity it will possess will therefore, in the 0r­  
;,7/1 of things, be regulated by the favorable orunfavor­  
t-r &#x27; ancc °f 115 trade ; that is, by the proportion between its  
abilities to .upply foreigners, and its wants of them ; between  
me amount of itsexporutions and that of itsimportations. Hence  
the 1 ate of its agriculture and manufaflures, the quantity and  
tf n lts labour and ituluftry must, in the main, influence  
and determ.nc the incrcafe or decrease ol it* gold and ftlver.

THE fuppoit of industry is probably in ♦-Very cafe, of more  
consequence towards corre6ling a wrong balance of trade,  
than any pra&amp;icable retrenchments in the expences of families or  
individuals : and the stagnation of it would be likely to have  
more effedfc in prolonging, than any such savings in ftiortening its  
coutinuance. That stagnation is a natural consequence of an in­  
adequate medium, which, without the aid of bank circulation,  
&quot;would in the cases supposed, be severely felt.  
It also defervcs notice, that as the circulation of a bank is al-  
in a compound ratio to the fund upon which it depends,  
and to the demand for ir, and as that fund is itfelf affe&amp;ed by the  
exportation of the metals, there is no danger of its being over­  
flocked , as in the cafe of paper iflued at the pleasure of the go­  
vernment ; or of its preventing the consequences of any unfavor­  
able balance from being fufficiently felt to produce the reforms  
alluded to, as far as circumstances may require and admit.  
Nothing can be more fallible than the comparisons which have  
been made between different countries, to illustrate the truth of  
the position under confederation. The comparative quantity of  
gold and silver, in different countries, depends upon an infinite  
variety of fa&amp;s and combinations, all of which ought to be  
known in order to judge whether the existence or non-existence  
of paper currencies has any (hare in the relative proportions they  
contain. The majs and value of the productions of thfe labour and  
industry of each, compared with its wants ; thenaturcof its es­  
tablishments abroad : the kind of wars in which it is usually en­  
gaged : the relations it bears to the countries, which are the ori­  
ginal pofTeffors of those metals ; the* privileges it enjoys in their  
trade; these and a number of other circumstances are all to be ta­  
ken into the account, and render the investigation too complex to  
juftify any reliance on the vague and general surmises, which have  
been hitherto hazarded on the point.  
In the foregoing difcuflion, theobjeflion has been conftdered as  
applying to the permanent expulsion and diminution of the metals.  
Their temporary exportation, for particular purposes, has not  
been contemplated. This, it mud be confeffed is facilitated by  
banks, from the faculty they poftefs of fupplyirigtheir place. But  
their utility is in nothing more conspicuous, than in these very  
cases. They enable the government to pay its foreign debts, and  
to anfwerany exigencies which the external concerns of the com­  
munity may have produced. They enable the merchant to sup­  
port his credit (on which the prosperity of trade depends) when  
special circumstances prevent remittances iri other moc!~es. They  
enable him also to profecutc enterprizes, which ultimately tend to  
an augmentation of the fpecics of wealth in question. It is evi­  
dent, that gold and silver may often be employed in procuring  
commodities abroad ; which, in a circuitous commerce, replace  
the original fund, with considerable addition. But it is not to  
be inferred from this facility given to temporary exportation,  
that banks which are so si iendly to tradeand industry, are in their  
general tendency, inimical to the encreafe of the precious metals.  
These several views of the subjeCt appear fufficient to impress a  
fuil conviction of the utility of banks, and to demonstrate that  
they are of great importance, not only in relation to the admini­  
stration of the finances, but in the general system of the political  
economy.  
The judgment of many concerning them has no doubt been per­  
plexed, by the misinterpretation of appearance s, which were to be  
ascribed to other causes. The general devastation of personal  
property, occasioned by the late war, naturally produced on the  
one hand, a great demand for mojiey? and on the other a great de­  
ficiency of it to answer the demand. Some injudicious laws,  
■which grew out of the public diftrcflcs, by impairing confidcnce  
and causing a part of the inadequate sum in the country to be lock­  
ed up, aggravated the evil : The diflipated habits, contra&amp;ed by  
many individuals, during the war, which after the peace plunged  
them into expences beyond their incomes: The number of ad-  
  
venturers without capital, and in many instances without irifor­  
mation, who at that epoch rushed into trade, and were obliged to  
make any facrificcs tofupport a transient credit : The employment  
of confidcrable sums in speculations upon the public debt, which  
from its unsettled state was incapable of becoming itfelf a fubfti­  
tutc : All these circumstances concurring, necefiarily led to usuri­  
ous borrowing, pioduccd most of the inconveniences, and were  
the true causes of most of the appearances ; which, where banks  
were established, have been by some erroneously placed to their  
account; a mistake which they might eaftly have avoided by turn­  
ing their eyes towards places where there were none, and where,  
nevertheless, the fame evils would have been perceived to exist,  
  
even in a greater degree than where those institutions had ob  
tained. .  
  
I hcfe evils have either ceased, or been greatly mitigated. Their  
more complete cxtin&amp;ion may be looked for from that additional  
security to property, which the constitution of the United States  
happily gives (a circumstance of prodigious moment in the scale  
both of public and private prosperity) from the of fo­  
reign capital, under the aufpiccs of that security, to be employed  
upon objects and in cnterprifes, for which the state of this country  
opens a wide and inviting field, from the consistency and stability,  
which the public debt is fact acquiring, as well in the public opi­  
nion at home and abroad, as in fa 61; from the augmentation of  
capital, which that circumstance and the quarter-yearly payment  
of in*ereft will afford; and from the niore copious circulation,  
&quot;which will be likely to be created by a weil-conftituted national  
bank.  
  
The establishment of banks in this country seems to be recom­  
mended by reasons of a peculiar nature. Previously to the revo­  
lution, circulation was in a great measure carried on by paper emit­  
ted by the fevpal local governments. In Pcnnfylvania alone, the  
quantity of it was near a million and a half of dollars. This aux­  
iliary may be said to be now at an end. And it is generally sup­  
posed, that there has been for some trme pad, a deficiency of cir­  
culating medium. How far that deficiency is to be confidcred as  
real or imaginary, is not susceptible of dcmonflratiori ; but there  
are circumstances and appearances, which, in relation to the coun­  
try at large, countenance the supposition of its reality.  
The circumstances.are, besides faftjuft mentioned refpeft­  
mgpaper emissions, the vast traflsof waste land, and the little ad­  
vanced slate of manufactures. The progrefßve fettlcmcnt of the  
former, while it promifesample retribution, in the generation of  
future rcfourccs, diminishes or obftrufls, in the mean time, the  
aSire wealth of the country. It not only draws off a part o&#x27;f the  
circulating money, and places it in a more paflive ftatr, but it di­  
verts into us own channels a portion of that fpec&#x27;es of labour and  
mduftry, which would otherwise be employed in fumifhirig ma­  
terials lor foreign trade, and which by contributing to a favorable  
balance, would a {fill the introduftidn of fpccie. In the early  
periods of new fettlemcnts, the fcttlers not only furnifh no sur­  
plus for exportation, but they confumea part of that which is  
produced by the labour of oLhers. The Curie thing is a cause,  
that manufactures do not advance, or advance/lowly. And not­  
withstanding foroe hypotheses to the contrary, there are many  
  
k in a u^P:cion, that the precious metals will not  
.iQotind in any country which has not mines, or variety of ma­  
nufactures. Tncy have been sometimes acquired by the sword ;  
.&gt;ut the modern fyftern of war has expelled this resource ; and it  
ii one upon which the United States will never be inclined to  
rely.  
  
I he appearances alluded 10, arc, greater prevalcncy of direst  
ja.ttr, in the more interior dillri&amp;s of the country, which how­

rea ritaie, which also have of late diminilhed, but is still feri­  
ouilyle.t in different parts of the Union. The difficulty of get­  
ing money, which has been a general complaint, is not added to  
the number; because it is the complaint of all times, and one in  
appeal&#x27;to •f&quot;&gt;atlon mUst cv&quot; have too gf«t scope to permit an  
If the fuppofitionof such a deficiency be in any degree founded,  
and lome aid to circulation be desirable, it remains lo inquire  
what ought to be the nature of that aid.  
Remitting °f paper money by the authority of government  
i c y prohibited to the individual States, by the national con­  
u ion. And the spirit of that prohibition ought not to bedif­  
&quot;garded by ihe government of the United States. Though pa-  
Lm!&quot;1 10nSL&#x27;n?er,a Bcneral authority, might have some ad­

&quot;J&#x27;S &quot; no consequence, it might even perhaps be  
°C, m 3&gt;to, Pfodu&amp;ive of good ; but in great and  
y S emergencies, there is almost a moral certainty of its be­  
&quot;&quot;,n® mifch&#x27;evous. The stamping of paper is an operation so  
nf&#x27; laying of taxes, that a government, in the  
&#x27; , PjP?r C.&quot;J. &gt;ns&gt; would rarely fail in any such cmer­  
g -y&gt; indulge itfelf too far, in the employment of that re­  
to avoid as much as possible, one less aurPicious to prr­

extended to a degree, which would occaf.on an inflated and ar­

The payment of the ifttercfV of the public debt, at thirteen  
different places, is a weighty reason, peculiar to oar imme­  
diate fituaiion, for desiring a bank circulation. Without a pa­  
per, in general currency, equivalent to gold and silver, a consider­  
able proportion of the specie of the country must always be sus­  
pended from circulation, and left tc accumulate, preparatorily to  
cach day of payment; and as often as one approaches, there must  
in several cafcs be an actual transportation of the metals at both  
expence and rifle, from their natural and proper reservoirs to dis­  
tant places. This nect&#x27;ffity will be felt very injuriously to the  
trade of some of the Slates ; and will embarrass not a little the  
operations of the treasury in those States. It will also obftru£l  
those negociations, between different parts of the union, by the  
inftrumcntality of treasury bills, which have already afforded va­  
luable accommodations to trade in general.  
  
Affummg it then as a contequence from what has been said,  
that a national bank is a desirable institution, two enquiries em­  
erge—ls there no such institution, aJready in being, which has a  
claim to that character, and which fupercedes the propriety or  
neceflity of another ? If there be none, what are the principles  
upon which one ought to beeftablifhed ?  
  
There are at present three banks in the United States : That of  
North-America, eftabhihed in the city of Philadelphia; that of  
New-Yoik, eftablilhed in the city ot New-York ; that of Mafla­  
ehufetts, established in the town of Boston. Of these three, the  
firft is the only one which has at any time had a direst relation to  
the government of the United States.  
  
The bank of North America originated in a resolution of Con­  
gress of the 26th of May, 1781, founded upon a proposition of the  
fuperintendant of finance, which was afterwards carried into ex­  
ecution by an ordinance of the 31ft of December following, en­  
titled, u An oidinance to incorporate the fubferibers to the bank  
of North-America.&quot;  
  
The aid afforded to the United States by this institution, during  
the remaining period of the war, was of cffential   
and its conduct towards them since the peaee, has not wrakened&#x27;  
its title to their patronage and favour. So far its pretensions to  
the charatter in question are refpe&amp;able ; but there are circum­  
flances which militate against them ; and confederations which in­  
dicate the propriety of an establishment on different principles.  
The dire&amp;ors of this bank, on behalf of theii*conftituents, have  
fincc accepted and aded under a new charter from the State of  
Pennfylvauia, materially variant from their original one; and  
&quot;which so narrows the foundation of the institution, as to render it  
an incompetent basis for the extensive purpofesofa national bank.  
The limit assigned by the ordinance ofCongrefs to the stock of  
the bank, is ten millions of dollars. The last charter of Penn­  
lylvania confincs it to two millions. Questions naturally arise,  
■whether there be not a dirett repugnancy between two charters so  
differently circumstanced ; and whether the acceptance of the one  
is not to be deemed a virtual surrender of the other. But per­  
haps it is neither advifeabie nor necessary to attempt a solution of  
them.  
  
There is nothing in the a£l* of Congress, which imply an ex­  
clusive right in the institution to which they relate, except during  
the term of the war. There is therefore no:hing, if the public  
good require it, which prevents the eftabliftiment of another. It  
may however be incidentally remarked, that in thegeneralopinion  
of the citizens of the United States, the bank of North-America  
has taken the station of a bank of Pennsylvania only. This is a  
flrong argument for a new institution, or for a renovation of the  
old, toreftore it to the fuuation in which it originally flood, in  
the view of the United States.  
  
But tho&#x27; the ordinance of Congress contains no grant of exclu­  
sive privileges, there may be room to alledge, that the government  
of the United States ought not, in point of candour and equity, to  
cftablifh any rival or interfering institution, in prejudice of the  
one already established ; especially as this has, from services ren­  
dered, well-foundbd claims to protection and regard.  
The justice of such an observation ought within proper bounds  
to be admitted. A new of the fort ought not to be  
made, without cogent and sincere reasons of public good. And  
in the manner of doing it, every facility ftiould be given to a con­  
solidation of the old with the new, upon terms not injurious to  
the parties concerned. But there is no ground to maintain, that  
in a cafe in which the- government has made no condition re­  
ilri&amp;ing its authority, it ought voluntarily to reftrift it, through  
regard to the interests of a particular institution, when thoft* of the  
Sutc di&amp;ate a different course; especially too after such circum­  
ilances have intervened, as chara&amp;erue the adlual fuuation ot the  
bank of North-America.  
  
Th£ inducements to a new disposition of the thing arc now to  
be corifidered. The firft of them which occurs is, the, at least  
ambiguous, situation in which the bank of North-America has  
placed itfclf, by the acceptance of its lalV charter. If this has ren­  
dered it the mere bank of a particular slate, liable to diflblution  
at the expiration of fourteen years, to which term the ast of that  
slate has reftri&amp;ed its duration, it would be neither si». nor expe­  
dient to accept it as an equivalent for a bank of the United States.  
  
The reflri&amp;ion of its capital alfd, which, according to the fame  
iuppofnion, cannot be extended beyond two millions of dollars,  
is a conclusive reason for a different eftabliftiment. So small a ca­  
pital promises neither the requisite aid to government, nor the re­  
quisite fccurity to the community. It may answer ver&quot; well the  
purposes of local accommodation, but is an inadequate foundation  
for a circulation co-exteiifive with the United States; embracing  
the whole of their revenues&#x27;, and affetting every individual into  
whose hands the paper may come.  
  
And inadequate as fiich a capital would be to the eflential ends  
of a national bank, it is liable to b£ rendered still more so, by that  
principle of the constitution of the bank of Nonh-Ameriea, con­  
tained equally in its old and in its new chatter, which leaves the  
mcrcafe of the afilual capital at any time (now far short of the al­  
lowed extent) to the discretion of the directors or stockholders.  
Jt is naturally to be expe&amp;ed, that the allurements of an advanced  
price or stock, and of large may difinclme those who  
are intcrefted, to an cxtenfion of capital; from which they will be  
apt to fear a diminution of profits. And from this circumstance,  
the interest: and accommodation of the public (as well individu­  
ally as collettively) are made more subordinate to the interest,  
real or imagined, of the stock holders, than they ought to be&#x27;. It  
is true, that unless the tatter be confuhed, there can be no bank  
(in the sense at lead in which institutions of this kind, worthy of  
confidence, can be established in this country.) But it does not  
follow, that this is alone to be confultcd, or that it even ought to  
be paramount. Public utility is more truly the object of public  
banks, than private profit. And it is the business of government,  
to con&amp;itute them on such principles, that while the latter will re­  
sult, in a fufficient degree, to afford competent motives to engage  
in them, the former be not made subservient to it. To efFect this,  
a principle object of attention ought to be to give free fcopc to  
the creation of an ample capital ; and with this view, fixing the  
Wounds, which are deemed lafe and convenient, to leave no diC­  
  
crction either to flop fliort of them or to overpass them. The  
want of this precaution, in the establishment of the bank of North-  
America, is a further aud an important reason for desiring one  
differently constituted.  
There may be room at firft fight for a supposition, that as the  
profit* of a bank will bear a proportion to the extent of its ope­  
rations, and as, for this reason, the interell of the stockholders will  
&#x27;not be difadvantageoufly affc&amp;ed by any ncceffary augmentations  
of capital, there is no cause to apprehend that they will be indis­  
posed to such augmentations. But molt men in matters of this  
nature, prefer the certainties they enjoy, to probabilities depend­  
ing on untried experiments ;.efpecially when tbcfc promise rather,  
that they will not be injured, than that they will be benefited.  
From theinfluence of this principle, and a desire of enhancing  
its profits, the dife&amp;ors of a bank will be more apt to overstrain  
its faculties, in an attempt to face the additional demands, which  
the course of bufincft may create, than to set on foot new fubferip­  
t ions, which may hazard a diminution of the profits, and even a  
temporary redu£tiunof the price 6f flock

sed at sales upon judgments which thall  
have been obtained for such debts. .  
VI. The totality of the debts of the  
company, whether by bond, bill, note,  
or other contrat (credits for deposits  
excepted) shall never exceed the amount  
of its capital stock. In case of excess,  
the diretors, under whose administra­

BANKS arc among the bed expedients for lowering the rate of  
interest in a country ; but to have this effect, their capitals  
must be completely equal to all the demands of business, and such  
as will tend to remove the idea, that the accommodations they af­  
ford, are in any degree favors ; an idea very apt to accompany  
the parsimonious dispensations of contra&amp;ed funds. I* this, as in  
every other cafe, the plenty of the commodity ougV.t to beget a  
moderation of the price.  
7 he want of a principle of rotation, in the constitution of the  
bank, of North-America, is another argument for a variation of  
the eftabliHiment. Scarcely one of the reasons which militate  
agamfl this principle in the conflitution of a country, is applica­  
ble to that of a bank ; while there are strong reasons in favor of  
it, in relation to the one, which no doubt apply to the other.  
The knowledge to be derived from experience is the only circum­  
flance common to both, which pleads against rotation in the di­  
re&amp;ing officers ot a bank.  
  
But the obje&amp;s of the government of a nation, and those of the  
government of a bank, arc so widely different, as greatly to weak­  
en the force of that confider3tion, iu reference to the latter. Al­  
most every important caf; of legislation requires, towards a right  
decision, a general and accurate acquaintance with the affairs of  
the State; and habits of thinking seldom acquired, but from a  
familiarity of public concerns. The adminiilration of a bank, on  
the contrary, is regulated bv a few simple fixed maxims, the ap­  
plication of which is not difficult to any man of judgment, efpe­  
eially if inflru&amp;ed in the principles of trade. It is in general a  
constant fucceflion of the fame details.  
  
But though this be the cafe, the idea of the advantages of ex­  
perience is not to be flighted. Room ought to be left for the re­  
gular tianfmiffion of official information. And for this purpose,  
the head of the direction ought to be excepted from the principle  
of rotation. With this exception, and with the aid of the in­  
formation of the subordinate officers, there can be no danger of  
any ill effe£ls from want of experience, or knowledge ; especially  
«ts the periodical exclusion ought not to reach the whole of the di­  
re£lors at one time.  
  
The argument in favor of the principle of rotation is this, that  
by leflening the danger of combinations among the dirc6lors, to  
make the inflitution subservient to party views,or to the accommo­  
dation, preferably, of any particular set of men, it will render  
the public confidence more firm, stable and unqualified.  
When it is considered, that the diie£lors of a bank are not eie&amp;-  
cd by the great body of the community, in which a diversity of  
views will naturally prevail, at different conjun£tures, but by a  
small and fele6l class of &quot;men, among whom it is far more easy to  
cultivate a steady adherence to the fame peifons and obje£is ; and  
that those dire&amp;ors have it in their power so immediately to con­  
ciliate, by obliging the most influential of this class, it is easy to  
perceive, that without the principle of rotation, changes in that  
body can rarely happen, but as a concession which they may them­  
fclves think it expedient to make to public opinion.  
The continual adminiilration of an institution of this kind, by  
the fame persons, will never fail, with or without cause, from  
their conduct, to excite diflruft and discontent. The necefTarv  
secrecy of their tranfa£lions, gives unlimited scope to imagination  
to infer that fomcthmg is, &lt;;r may be wrong. And this inevitable  
mystery is a lolid rcafon for inserting in the conflitution of a bank  
the nr ceffity of a change of men. As neither the mass of the pai­  
ties intercfted, nor the public in general, can be permitted to be  
■witnefits of the interior management of the,directors, it is rea­  
sonable that both should have that check upon their condu£l, and  
that security against the prevalency of a partial or pernicious sys­  
tem, which will beproduced by the ccrtainty of periodical changes.  
Such too is the delicacy of the credit of a bank, that every thing  
■which can fortify confidence and repel suspicion, without injuring  
its operations, ought carefully to be fought after in its formation.  
  
A further confederation in favour of a change, is the improper  
rule, by which the right of voting for dire&amp;ors is regulated in the  
plan, upon which the bank of North-America was originally  
eonftituted, namely, a vote for each ftiare, and the want of a rule  
in the last charter; unless the silence of it, on that pointy may fig­  
fiify that every stockholder is to have an equal and fir.glc vote,  
-which would be a rule in a different extreme, not less erroneous.  
It is of importance that a rule should be cftablifhed on this head,  
as it is one of those things which ought not to be left to discre­  
tion; and it is consequently of equal importance, that the rule  
should be a proper one.  
A vote for each share, renders a combination between a few  
principal stockholders, to monopolize the power and benefits of  
the bank, too easy. An equal vote to each stockholder, however  
♦rreat or small his interest in the institution, allows not that degree  
cf weight to large stockholders, which it is reasonable they Ihould  
liave, and vvhich perhaps their security and that of the bank re­  
quire. A prudent mean is to be preferred. A convitlion of this  
has produced a bye-law of the corporation of the bank of North-  
America, which evidently aims at such a mean. But ar&lt; flection  
arises here, that a like majority with that which cnatted this law,  
may at any moment repeal it,  
  
The last inducement which shall be mentioned, is the want of  
&gt;recautions to guard against a foreign influence infinuatiug itfelf  
nto the dire&amp;ion of the bank. It fecms fcarccly reconcileable  
vith a due caution, to permit that any but citizens should be eli­  
;ible, as di&#x27;e&amp;ors of a national bank, or that non-resident foreign­  
:rs should be able to influence the appointment of dire&amp;ors, by  
he votestheir proxies. In the event, however, of an incorpo­  
ration of the bank of North-America, in the plan, it mav be ne­  
ceflary to qualify this principle, so as to leave the right of f rsign­  
ers, who now hold (hares of its stock, unimpaired ; but without  
the power of transmitting the privilege in question, v.o foreign  
alienees.  
  
It is to be considered, that such a bank is not a mere matter of  
private property, but a political machine of the greatest. import­  
ance to the state.  
  
There are other variations from the conftitutiori of the bank of  
North-America, not of inconsiderable moment, which appear de­  
arable, but which are not of magnitude enough to claim a preli­  
minary difcuflion. These will be seen in the plan which will be  
submitted in the sequel.  
If the obje&amp;ions which have been stated, to the conflitution ot  
the bank of Worth-America, are admitted to be well founded, they  
-will nevertheless not derogate fiom the merit of the main design,  
or of the services which that bank has rendered, or of the benefits  
■which it has produced. The creation of such an inftirution, at the  
time it took place, was a mcafure d&#x27;ftated by wisdom. Its utility  
has been amply cvinced by its fruits—American independence  
owes much to it—and it is very conceivable, that reasons of the  
moment mav have rendered those features in it inexpedient, which  
a revision, with a permanent view, suggests as desirable.  
  
The order of the fubjett leads next to an inquiry into the prin­  
ciples upon which a national bank ought to be organized.  
&quot;f Jic fituarioni of the United States naturally infpircs a wifli, that  
  
the form of the institution could admit of a plurality of branches.  
But various confederations discourage from pursuing this idea. The  
complexity of such a plan would be apt to inspire doubts, which  
might deter from adventuring in it. And the pra£licabilit)*of a  
fafc and ordtrly adminiflration, though not to be abandoned as  
desperate, cannot be made so manifeft in ncrfpe£tive, ai&#x27;to pro­  
mile the removal of those doubts, or to juflify the government in  
adopting the idea as an original experiment. The most that would  
feein advifeable, on this point, is to insert a provision, which may  
lead f.o it hereafter ; if experience fhali more clearly demonstrate  
i&#x27;s utility, and fatisfy those who may have the dire£lion,that it may  
be adopted with fafety. It is certain, that it would have fomc  
.advantages, both peculiar and important, fides more general  
accommodation, it would lessen the danger of a run upon the  
bank.  
  
The argument against it is, that each branch must be under a  
fiiftinft, though subordinate direttion, to which a considerable la­  
titude of discretion mult of necefluy be entrnfted. And as th&lt;_  
property of the whole inflitupion would be liable for the engage-  
ot each part, that and its cr dit would be at flake, upon the  
prudence of the dire&amp;ors of every&#x27;part. The mismanagement oJ  
either branch might hazard serious dilorder in the whole.  
Another wish, di&amp;ated by t)ie particular fnuation of the coun­  
try, is, that the bank could be so conftitutcd as to be made an im­  
mediate inilrument of loans to the proprietors of land ; but this  
wish alio yields to the difficulty of accomplishing it. Land is  
alone an unfit fund for a bank circulation. If the notes iflued  
upon it were not to be payable in coin, on demand, or at a short  
date, this would amount to nothing more than a repetition of the  
paper emiflions, which are now exploded by the general voice.  
If the notes are to be payable in coin, the.land must firft be con­  
verted into it by sale, or mortgage. The difficulty of effecting the  
latter, is the very th&#x27;ng which begets the desire of finding another  
resource, and the former would not be practicable on a sudden  
emergency, but with facrifices which would make the cure worse  
than the difcafe. Neither is the idea of constituting the fund part­  
ly of coin and partly of land, free from impediments. Thefetwo  
species of property do not, for the most part, unite in the fame  
hands. Will the monied man confeat to enter into a partnership  
with the landholder, by which the latter wi.l lhare in the profits  
which zvill be madefy the money of the former ? The money, it is  
evident, will be the agent or efficient cause of the profits—the land  
can only be regarded as an additional security. It is not difficult  
to forefee, that an union, on iuch terms, will not readily be form­  
ed. If the landholders are to procure the money by the sale or  
mortgage of a part of their lands, this they can as well do, when  
the itock confilts wholly oi money, as if it were Lo be compound­  
ed of money and land.

In obedience to the order of the House of Re­  
presentatives of&quot; the prb Day of August lad,  
requiring the Secretary of the Treasury  
to prepare and report, on this Day, luch fur­  
ther Provision as may, in his opinion, be ne­  
ceflary for establishing the PUBLIC CREDIT  
—the said Secretary further  
Respectfully reports,  
(continued from our last.)  
TO procure for the landholders the afliftance of loans, is the  
great deftderatum. Suppofingother diiSculties lurmounted,  
and a fund created, composed partly of coin and partly of land,  
vet the benefit contemplated could only then be obtained, by the  
bank&#x27;s advancing them its notes for the whole, or part, of the va­  
lue of the lands they had subscribed to the flock. If this advance  
&quot;was small, the relief aimed at would not be given ; if it was  
large, the quantity of notes iflued would be a cause of diftruji, and  
if received at all, they would be likely to return speedily upon the  
bank for payment ; which, after exhausting its coin, might be  
under a neceflity of turning its lands into money, at any price that  
could be obtained for them, tf&gt; the irreparable prejudice of the  
proprietors.  
  
Confiderationsof public advantage fugged a further wifh,wh&#x27;ch  
is, thar the bank could be established upon principles, that would  
cause the profits of it to redound to the immediate benefit of the  
State. This is contemplated by many, who speak of a national  
bank, but the idea seems liable to insuperable obje&amp;ions. To at­  
tach full confidenceto an institution of this nature, it appears to  
be an eflential ingredient in its ftru&amp;ure, that it shall be under a  
private not a public dire&amp;ion, under the guidance of individual in­  
tcrejl, not of public policy ; which would be supposed to be, and in  
certain emergencies, under a feeble or too fauguine administra­  
tion, would really be, liable to being too much influenced by  
public ncccfjity. The suspicion of this would probably be a canker,  
that would continually corrode the vitals of the bank, and would  
be molt likely to prove fatal in those situations, in which the  
public good would require, that they should be moll found and  
vigorous. It would indeed be little less than a miracle, (hould  
the credit of the bank be at the disposal of the government if in a  
longferiesof time, there was not experienced a calamitous abuse  
of it. It is true, that it would be the real interefl of the govern­  
ment not to abuse it ; its genuine policy to husband and cherilh  
it with the moll guarded circumfpeftion, as an inestimable trea­  
lure. But what government ever uniformly consulted its tiue in­  
terests, in opposition to the temptationsof momentary exigencies ?  
What nation was ever bleffec? with a constant fuccellion of up­  
right and wife administrators ?  
  
The keen, steady, and as it were magnetic sense of their own  
interest as proprietors, in the dire&amp;ors of a bank, pointing in­  
variably to its true pole, the prolperity of the institution, is the  
only security that can always be relied upon for a careful and pru­  
dent administration. It is therefore the only basis on which an  
enlightened, unqualified and permanent confidence can be expeft­  
cd to beere&amp;ed and maintained.  
The precedents of the banks eftabiifhed in several cities of Eu­  
rope, Amsterdam, Hamburgh and others, may seem to militate  
against this position. Without a precise knowledge of all the pe­  
culiarities of their refpe&amp;ive constitutions, it is difficult to pro­  
nounce how far this may be the cafe. That of Amsterdam how­  
ever, which we bell know is rather under a municipal than a go­  
vernmental direction. Particulai magillrates of the city, not of­  
ficers of the republic, have the management of it. It is also a  
bank of deposit, not of loan, or circulation; consequently less  
liable to abuse, as well as less ufeful. Its general business con-  
  
fills in receiving money for fafe keeping, which if not called for  
  
within a certain time, becomes a part of its flock, and irreclaim­  
able : But a credit is given for it on the books of the bank, which  
being transferable, anfweis all the purposes of money.  
The dire&amp;ors being magistrates of the city, and the stockholders  
in general its most influential citizens, it is evident, that the prin­  
ciple of private interest mud be prevalent in the management of  
the bank. And it is equally evident, that from the nature of its  
operations, that principle is less essential to if, than to an institu­  
tion constituted with a view to the accommodation of the public  
and individuals, by dire£l loans and a paper circulation.  
As far as may concern the aid of the bank, within the proper li­  
mits, a good government has nothing more to wifli for, than it  
•will always poflefs ; though the management be in the hands of  
private individuals. As the institution, if rightly constituted, mull  
  
depend for its renovation from time to time on the pleasure of the  
  
government, it will not be likely to feel a disposition to render it­  
felf by its condufl unworthy of public patronage. The govern­  
ment too, in the administration of its finances, has it in its power  
to reciprocate benefits to the bank, of not less importance than  
those which the bank affords to the government, and which be­  
sides are never unattended with an immediate and adequate com­  
pensation. Independent of these more particular confederations,  
the natural weight and influence of a good government will al­  
ways go far towards procuring a compliance with its desires; and  
as the directors will usually be compoied of some of the moll dis­  
creet, refpc£lable and well-informed citizens, it can hardly ever  
be difficult to make them sensible of the force of the inducements  
•which ought to stimulate their exertions.  
  
It will not follow from what has been said, that the state may  
not be the holder of a part of the {lock of a bank, and confequerit­  
ly a sharer in the profits of it. It will only follow that it ought  
not to desire any participation in the direction of it, aud therefore  
ought not to own the whole or principal part of the flock ; for if  
the mass of their property fliould belong to the public, and if the  
direction of it should be in private hands, this would be to com­  
mit the interests of the state to persons not interested, or not  
enough interested in their proper management.  
  
There is one thing, however, which the government owes to it­  
felf and to the community ; at least to all that part of it, who are  
not stockholders; which is to reserve to itfelf a right of ascertain­  
ing, as often as may be neceftary, the ftite of the bank, excluding  
however all pretention to controul. This right forms an article in  
the primitive constitution of the bank of North-America ; and its  
propriety stands upon the eleareft reasons. If the paper of a bank  
is to be permitted to insinuate itfelf into all the icvenues and re­  
ceipts of a country ; if it is even substituted for gold and fiJver in  
all the tranfattions of business, it becomes in either view a nati­  
onal concern of the firft magnitude. As such, the ordinary rules  
of prudence require, that the government should poflefs the means  
of ascertaining, whenever it thinks fit, that so delicate a trust is ex­  
ecuted with fidelity and care. A right of this nature is not only  
defirabJe as it refpe£ls the government; but it ought to be equally  
so to all thofc concerned in the institution; as an additional title  
to public and private confidence; and as a thing which can only  
be formidable to practices that imply mismanagement. The pre­  
emption mull always be, that the c.hara6lers who would be en­  
trusted with the exercise of this right on behalf of the govern­  
ment, will not be deficient in the discretion which it may require;  
at least the admitting of this presumption cannot be deemed too  
great a return of confidence tor that very 1 rge portion of it which  
the government is required to place in the bank.  
Abandoning therefore ideas, which however agreeable or desi­  
rable, are neither pra&amp;icable nor fafe; the following plan for the  
constitution of a National Bank, is refpe£tfuiiy submitted to the  
confidcration of the house.

any comments, which need further be made, will be both few  
and concise.  
  
The combination of a portion of the public debt in the forma­  
tion of the capital, is the principal thing, of which an explanation  
is requisite. The chief object of this is, to enable the creation of  
a capital fufficientlv large to be the basis of an extensive circula­  
tion, and an adequate security for it. As has been elsewhere re­  
marked, the original plan of the bank of North-America,contem­  
plated a capital of ten millions of dollars, which is certainly  
not too broad a foundation for the extensive operations to which  
a national bank is destined. But to collect such a sum in this coun­  
try in gold and fiber, into one depository, may, without hefita­  
be pronounced impra&amp;icable. Hence the neceflity of an  
auxiliary, which the public debt at once presents.  
This part of the fund will be always ready to come in aid of  
the fpccie : it will more and more command a ready sale ; and  
can therefore expeditioufly be turned into coin if an exigency of  
the bank should at any time require it. This quality of prompt  
convertibility into coin, rendeisit an equivalent tor that neceflary  
agent of bank circulation ; and aiftingniihes it from a fund in  
land, of which the sale would generally be far less compendious,  
and at great difadvantagc. The quarter yearly receipts of interest  
will also be an actual addition to the specie fund during the in­  
tervals between them and the half yearly dividends of profits.  
The objection to combining land with specie, resulting from their  
not being generally in poffeflion of the fame persons, does not ap­  
ply to the debt, which will always be found in confiderablc quan­  
tity among the monied and trading people.  
The debt composing part of the capital, besides its collateral ef­  
!e£fc in enabling the bank to extend its operations, and confe­  
quentiy to enlarge its profits, will produce a direst annual reve­  
nue of fix per centum from the government, which will enter in­  
to the half-yearly dividends received by the Hock-holders.  
When the present price of the public debt is considered, and  
the effe&amp; which its conversion into bank-stock, if corporated with  
a specie fund, would in all probability have to accelerate its rife  
to the proper point, it will eafilv be discovered, that the opera­  
tion presents in its outset a very confidetable advantage to those  
who may become fubferibers; and from the influence which that  
rife would have on the general inafs of the debt, a proportional  
benefit to all the public creditors, and, in a sense, which has been  
more than once adverted to, to the community at largr.  
There is an important fact. which exemplifies the fitnefs of the  
public debt, for a bank fund, and which may fervc to remove  
doubts in some minds on this point. It is this, that the bank of  
England in its firft ere&amp;ion rested wholly on that foundation.  
The fubferibers to a loan to government of one million two hun­  
dred thousand pounds sterling, were incorporated as a bank ; of  
which the debt created by the loan and the interefl upon it, were  
the sole fund. The subsequent augmentations of its capital,  
which now amounts to between eleven and twelve millions of  
pounds sterling, have been of the fame nature.  
The confining of the right of the bank to contrast debts to the  
amount of its capital, is an important which is not to  
be found in the constitution of the bank of North- Ameiica, and  
which while the fund consists wholly of coin, would be a restric­  
tion attended with inconveniences, but would be free fiorn any if  
the composition of it should be such as is now proposed. The rc­  
ftrittion exists in the eftabliftiment of the bank of England, and  
•s a source of security, is worthy of imitation. The consequence  
of exceeding the limit there is, that each stockholder is liable for  
the excess, in proportion to his interest in the bank. When it is  
considered, that the dire&amp;ors owe their appointments to the  
choice of the stockholders, a responsibility of this kind on the  
part of the latter, does not|appear unreasonable. But on the other  
hand, it may be deemed a hardship upon those who may have  
diflented from the choice. And there are many among us, whom  
it might perhaps discourage from becoming concerned in the in­  
stitution. These reasons, have induced the placing of the respon­  
sibility upon the dire&amp;ors, by whom the limit prescribed should  
be tranfgrefled.  
ThG interdiction of loans on account of the United States, or of  
any particular State, beyond the moderate sum fpecified, or of  
any foreign power, will serve as a barrier to cxccutive encroach­  
ments, and to combinations in3ufpicious to the fafety, or con­  
trary to the policy of the Uuion.  
The limitation of the rate of interest is di£lated by the consider­  
ation, that different rates prevail in different parts of the union ;  
and as the operations of the bank may extend through the whole,  
some rule seems to be necessary. There is room for a question,  
whether the limitation ought not rather to be to five, than to fix  
per cent, as proposed. It may with fafety be taken for granted,  
that the former rate would yield an ample dividend ; perhaps as  
much as the latter, by the extension which it would give to busi­  
ness. The natural effect of low interest is to encreafe trade and  
industry ; because undertakings of every kind can be piofecuted  
with greater advantage. This is a truth generally admitted ; jjut  
it is requisite to have analized the i&#x27;ubjeft in all its relations, to be  
able to form a just conception of the extent of that effe£t. Such  
an analysis cannot but fatisfy an intelligent mind, that the differ­  
ence of one per cent, in the rate at which money may be had, is  
often capable of maAing an essential change for the better in the  
(ituation of any country or place.  
Every thing therefore which tends to lower the rate of interest,  
is peculiarly worthy of the cares of legislators. And though laws  
■which violently fink the legal rate of interest, greatly below the  
market level, are not to be commended, because they are not cal­  
culated to answer their aim; yet whatever has a tendency to efFcft  
a reduction, w iihout violence to the natural couife of things, ought  
to be attended to and put sued. Banks are among the means moll  
proper to accomplish this end; and the moderation of the rate at  
which their discounts are made, is a material ingredient towards  
it ; with which their own interest viewed on an enlarged and  
permanent scale, does not appear to clalh.  
But as the mo ft obvious ideas are apt to have greater force than  
those which depend on complex and remote combinations, there  
would be danger, that the persons whose funds must constitute the  
flock of the bank, would be diffident of the fufficiency of the pro­  
fits to be expe&amp;ed, if the rate of loans and discounts were to be  
placed below the poirit to which they have been accuftomcd ; and  
might, on this account, be indisposed to embarking in the plan.  
There is, it is tiue, one reflection, which, in regard to men attive­  
ly engaged in trade, ought to be a security against this danger ; it  
is this—That the accommodations which they might derive in the  
way of the«&#x27;r bufinels, at a low rate, would more than indemnify  
them for any difference in the dividend ; fuppofiug even that some  
diminution of it were to be the consequence. But upon the  
whole, the hazard of contrary reasoning among the mass of mo­  
nied men, is a powerful argument against the experiment. The  
  
institutions of the kind already existing, add to the dw.iculty of  
making it. Mature reflection, and a large capital, may, of them­  
fslves, lead to the desired end. , ,  
The laft&#x27;thing which requires any explanatory remark, is the  
authority proposed to be given to the President to iublcribe to the  
amount ot two millions of dollars on account of the public. Ihe  
main defigu of this is to enlarge the specie fund ot the bank, and  
to enable it to give a more early extension to its operations. Iho  
it is proposed to borrow with one hand what is lent to the other ;  
yet the difbut lement ot what is borrowed, will be piogrellive, and  
bank-notes may be thrown into circulation, inflead of the gold  
and filvcr. Bt fides, there is to be an annual reimbui femcnt of a  
part of the sum borrowed, which will finally operate as an actual  
i niveftment of so much specie. In addition to the inducements  
[ to this measure, which results from the general interest of the go­  
vernment to enlarge the sphere ot the utility of the bank, there is  
j this more particular consideration, to wit, that as far as the divi­  
dend on the flock iliall exceed the interest paid on the loan, there  
is a politive profit.  
The Secretary begs leave to conclude, with this general obser­  
vation—That if the Bank of North-America (hall come forward  
with any propositions, which have for obje£l the ingrafting upon  
that institution the chara&amp;eriftics which shall appear to the legil­  
lature aeceirary to the due extent and falety of a national bank,  
there are, in his judgment, weighty inducements to giving every  
reasonable facility to the measure. Not only the pretensions of  
that institution, from its original relation to the government of  
the United States, and from theferviccs it has rendered, are such  
as to claim a disposition favorable to it, if rhofe who are inteiefted  
in it are willing, on their part, to place it on a footing fatisfa&amp;ory  
to the government, and equal to the purposes of a bank of the  
United States; but its co-operation would materially accelcrate  
j the accomplishment of the great object, and the collision, which  
might otherwise arise, might, in a variety of ways, prove equally  
disagreeable and injurious. The incorporation or union here  
contemplated, may be effctted in different modes, under the au­  
spices of an ast of the United States, if it shall be desired by the  
Bank of North-America, upon terms which shall appear expedient  
to the governmenr  
  
Ail which is humbly fubmitled

It had already been demonttrated that banks always increafed the cuantity, and  
quickened the circulation of money. Hence they had an obvious tendency ta couns  
teract the progreis of ulury, which would be increafed or diminifhed according to the  
proportion which fubfifted between the demand for borrowing, and the quantity of  
money at market.  
  
2. In fupport of the charge that bank-lending was an impediment to other kinds  
of lending, it had been faid, that by confining the refource of borrowing to a particu~  
Jar clafs, the reft of the community were ieft in a more deititute fituation, ‘a which  
they were unavoidably expofed to the extertions of ufurcrs. The profits of banlky  
ftock being generally greater than the legal rate of intereit, men poffleffed of money

quence of retaining it fhould be a feanty circulation  
  
But the fecretary confidered the pofitive increale or decreafe of the precious metals  
in a country, in no fuch indifferent light ; thefe conftituting a {pecies of the moft ef-  
fective wealth—the money of the world—-and a commodity univerfally taken in ex-  
change for every other,—His anfwer therefore was of a more conclufive nature ; and  
controverted the fact itfelf.  
  
As a nation which has no mines, muft obtain the metals from thofe that have, and  
this, generally, in exchange for the products of its labour and induftry, the quantity  
of thofe metals it will poffefs muft be regulated by the favourable or unfavourable  
balance of its trade ; and this again mutt depend on the ftate of its agriculture and  
manufaQures, or the quantity and quality of its labour and indufry. Hence well  
conftituted banks would feem rather to favour the increafe of the precious metals,  
Te had already been fhewn that they augment the active capital of acountry. This  
generates employment, and gives animation to induftry and labour ; and, by increaf-  
ing the produds of both, furnifhes more materials for exportation, produces a more  
favourable balance of trade, and, confequently, promotes the introduction and increafe  
of gold and filver.

The fecretary obferved further, on this head, that the comparitive quantity of gold  
and filver, in different countries, depended on an infinite variety of caules, allof which  
ought to be known, in order to judge, whether the exiftence or non-exiftence of pa-  
per-currencies had any fhare in fixing thofe relative proportions of the metals  
“ The mafs and value of the productions of the labour and induftry of each coun-  
try compared with its wants—the nature of its eftablifhments abroad—the kind of  
wars in which it is ufually engaged—the relations it bears to the countries which are  
the original poffeffors of thofe metalé—the privileges it enjoys in their trade—thefe,  
anda number of other circumftances, are all to be taken into the account, and ren-  
der the inveftigation too complex to juftify any reliance on the vague and general fur-  
mifes, that have been hitherto hazarded on the point.”&quot;—Thus far on the fubject of

p.per thus emitted either hecaxie a mere bubble, or produced an artificial ftate of  
things, incompatible with the regular a: profperous courfe of political economy.—  
A mat-rial difference between a paper currency, iffued by the authority of govern-  
ment, and one iffued by a bank, and payable in coin upen demand, was, that in the  
former cafe there was no ftandard for afcertaining the quantity which would fatisfy or  
furcharge the circulation ; but bank emiffions muft always be in a compound ratio ta  
the fund on which they depend, and the demand for them ;——~hence, if more than  
the neceflary amount were jflued, it would be returned upon the bank—Thus there  
would be a limitation in the nature of the thing itfelf; while the extent of paper me-  
ney emiffions would depend altogether on the difcretion of government. There could  
be no hefitation, therefore, in preferring bank paper to any other.  
  
The quarterly payment of the intereft of the public debt, at thirteen different places,  
was mentioned by the fetretary, as affording a weighty reafon, peculiar to the imme-  
diate ftate of the country, for defiring a bank circulation. “ Without a paper, faid  
he, in general currency, equivalent to gold and filver, a confiderable proportion of  
the {pecie of the country mult always be fulpended from circulation, and left to accu-  
mulate preparatorily to each day of payment ; and, as often as one approaches, there.

Read in the house of refresenta-  
tives; Dec. \3thy 1790.  
  
RESPECTFULLY REPORTS;  
That from a conviction that a  
national bank is an institution of  
primary importance to the pros-  
Von, vir.  
  
perous administration of the fi-  
nances, and would be of the  
greatest utility in the operations  
connected with the support of the  
public credit, his attention has  
been drawn to devising the plan  
of such an institution, upon a  
scale which will entitle it to the  
confidence, and be likely to ren-  
der it equal to the exigencies, of  
the public.  
  
Previously to entering upon  
the detail of this plan, he entreats  
the indulgence of the house, to-  
wards some preliminary reflec-  
tions naturally arising out of the  
subject, which he hopes will be  
deemed neither useless nor out  
of place. Public opinion being  
the ultimate arbiter of every mea-  
sure of government, it can  
scarcely appear improper, in de-  
ference to that, to accompany the  
origination of any new proposi-  
tion, with explanations, which  
the superior information of those  
to whom it is immediately ad-  
dressed, would render superflu-  
ous.  
  
It is a fact well understood,  
that public banks have found ad-  
mission and patronage among the  
principal and most enlightened  
commercial nations: They have  
successively obtained in Italy,  
Germany, Holland, England, and  
France, as well as in the United  
States. And it is a circumstance  
which cannot but have considera-  
ble weight, in a candid estimate  
of their tendency, that after an  
experience of centuries, there  
exists not a question about their  
utility in the countries in which  
they have been so long establish-  
ed. ‘Theorists and men of busi-  
ness unite in the acknowledg-  
ment of it.  
  
Trade and industry, wherever  
they haye been tried, have been

indebted to them for important  
aid. And government has been  
repeatedly under the greatest  
obligations to them, in danger-  
ous and distressing emergencies.  
That of the United States, as  
well in some of the most critical  
conjunctures of the late war, as  
since the peace, has received as-  
sistance from those established a-  
mong us, with which it could not  
have dispensed.  
  
With this two-fold evidence  
before us, it might be expected,  
that there would be a perfect u-  
nion of opinions in their favour.  
Yet doubts have been entertained ;  
jealousies and prejudices have  
circulated; and though the ex-  
periment is every day dissipating  
them, within the spheres in  
which effects are best known;  
yet there are still persons by  
whom they have not been en-  
tirely renounced. To givea full  
and accurate view of the sub-  
ject, would be to make a treat-  
ise of a report; but there are  
certain aspects in which it may  
be cursorily exhibited, which  
may perhaps conduce to a just  
impression of its merits. —These  
will involve a comparison of the  
advantages, with the disadvan-  
tages, real or supposed, of such  
institutions.  
  
The following are among the  
principal advantages of a bank :—  
  
First. The augmentation of  
the active or productive capital  
of a country. Gold and silver,  
where they are employed merely  
as the instruments of exchange  
and alienation, have been, not  
improperly, denominated dead  
stock; but when deposited in  
banks, to become the basis of a  
paper circulation, which takes  
their character and place, as the  
signs Or representatives, of va-  
  
lue, they then acquire life, or,  
in other words, an active and  
productive quality. This idea,  
which appears rather subtile and  
abstract, in a general form, may  
be made obvious and palpable, by  
entering into a few particulars.  
It is evident, for instance, that  
the money which a merchant  
keeps in his chest, waiting for a  
favourable opportunity to employ  
it, produces nothing till that op-  
portunity arrives. But if, in-  
stead of locking it up in this  
manner, he either deposits it in a  
bank, or invests it in the stock of  
a bank, it yields a profit during  
  
_the interval, in which he partakes  
or not, according to the choice  
  
he may have made of being a  
depositor or a proprietor; and  
when any advantageous specula-  
tion offers, in order to be able to  
embrace it, he has only to with-  
  
draw his money, if a depositor; .  
  
or if a proprietor, to obtain a  
loan from the bank, or to dispose  
of his stock ; an alternative sel-  
dom or never attended with diffi-  
culty, when the affairs of the in-  
stitution are in a _ prosperous  
train. His money thus deposited  
or invested, is afund upon which  
himself and others can borrow to  
amuch larger amount. It is a  
well established fact, that banks  
in good credit can circulate a far  
greater sum than the actual  
quantum of their capital in gold  
and silver. The extent of the  
possible excess seems indetermi-  
nate ; though it has been conjec-  
turally stated at the proportions  
of two and three to one. This  
faculty is produced in various  
ways. Tirst—A great propor-  
tion of the notes which are issu-  
ed and pass current as cash, are  
indefinitely suspended in circula-  
ton, from the confidence which

each holder has, that he can at  
any moment turn them into gold  
and silver. Secondly—--Every  
joan which a bank makes, is, in  
its first shape; a credit given to  
the borrower on its books, the a-  
mont of which it stands ready  
to pay, either in its own notes, or  
in gold or silver, at his option.  
But, in a great number of Cases,  
no actual payment is made in ei-  
ther. The borrower frequently,  
by a check or order, transfers his  
credit to some other person, to  
whom he hasa payment to make ;  
who, in his turn, is as often con-  
tent with a similar credit, because  
he is satisfied that he can, when-  
ever he pleases, either convert it  
into cash, or pass it to some o-  
ther hand, as an equivalent for it.  
And in this manner the credit  
keeps circulating, perfor ing, in  
every stage, the office of money,  
till it is extinguished by a discount  
with some person who has a pay-  
ment to make to the bank, to an  
equal or greater amount. ‘Thus  
large sums are lent aad paid, fre-  
quently through a_ variety of  
hands, without the intervention  
of a single piece of coin. Third-  
ly—-There is always a large  
quantity of gold and silver in the  
repositories of the bank, besides  
its own stock, which is placed  
there with a view, partly to its  
safe keeping, and partly to, the  
accommodation of an institution,  
which is itself a source of genc-  
ral accommodation. These de-  
posits are of immense conse-  
quence in the operations of a  
bank. Though liable to be re-  
drawn at any moment, experi-  
ence proves, that the money so  
much oftener changes proprié-  
tors than place, and that what is  
drawn out is generally so specdi-  
ly replaced, as to authorize the  
  
counting upon the sums deposit-  
ed, as an effective fund; which,  
concurring with the stock of the  
bank, enables it to extend its  
loans, and to answer all the de-  
mands for coin, whether in con-  
sequence of those loans, or aris-  
ing from the occasional return of  
its notes.  
  
These different circumstances  
explain the manner in which the  
ability of a bank to circulate a  
greater sum than its actual capi-  
tal in coin, is acquired. This,  
however, must be gradual; and  
must be preceded by a firm esta-  
blishment of confidence; a confi-  
dence which may be bestowed on  
the most rational grounds; since  
the excess in question will al-  
ways be bottomed on good secu-  
rity of one kind or another. This  
every well-conducted bank care-  
fully requires, before it will con-  
sent to advance either its money  
or its credit; and where there is  
an auxiliary capital, (as will be  
the case in the plan hereafter  
submitted,) which, together with  
the capital in coin, define the  
boundary that shall not be ex-  
ceeded by the engagements of the  
bank, the security may, consist-  
ently with all the naxims of a  
reasonable circumspection, be  
regarded as complete.  
  
The same circumstances illus-  
trate the truth of the position,  
that it is one of the properties of  
banks to increase the active capi-  
tal of a country. ‘This, in other  
words, is the sum of them—The  
money of one individual, while  
he is waiting for an opportunity  
to employ it, by being either de-  
posited in the bank for safe-  
keeping, or invested in its stock,  
is in a condition to administer to  
the wants of others, without be-  
ing put out of his own reach.

when’ occasion presents. This  
yields an extra profit, arising  
from what is paid for the use of  
his money by others, when he  
could not himself make use of  
it; and keeps the money itself  
  
-in a state of incessant activity. In  
  
the almost infinite vicissitudes  
and competitions of mercantile  
enterprise, there never can be  
danger of an intermission of de-  
mand, or that the money will re-  
main for a moment idle in the  
vaults of the bank. ‘This addi-  
tional employment given to mo-  
ney, and the faculty of a bank to  
lend and circulate a greater sum  
than the amount of its stock in  
coin, are, to all the purposes of  
trade and industry, an absolute  
increase of capital. Purchases  
and undertakings, in general, can  
be carriedson by any giyen sum  
of bank paper or credit, as effec-  
tually as by an equal sum of gold  
and silver. And thus by contri-  
buting to enlarge the mass of in-  
dustrious and commercial enter-  
prise, banks become nurseries of  
national wealth; a consequence,  
as satisfactorily verified by expe-  
rience, as it is clearly deducible  
in theory.  
  
Secondly. Greater facility to  
the government in obtaining pe-  
cuniary aids, especially in sudden  
emergencies. This is another,  
and an undisputed advantage of  
public banks: one which, as al-  
ready remarked, has been realiz-  
ed in signal instances among  
ourselves. The reason is obvi-  
ous: The capitals of a great  
number of individuals are, by this  
operation, collected to a point,  
and placed under one direction.  
The mass formed by this union  
is, in a certain sense, magnified  
by the credit attached to it. And  
while this massisalwaysready, and  
  
REGISTER.  
  
can at once be put in motion in  
aid of the government, the inter-  
est of the bank to afford that aid,  
independent of regard to the  
public safety and welfare, is a  
sure pledge for its disposition to  
go as far in its compliances, as  
can in prudence be desired.  
There is in the nature of things,  
as will be more particularly no-  
ticed in another place, an intimate  
connexion of interest between  
the government, and the bank, of  
a nation  
  
Thirdly. The facilitating of  
the payment of taxes. This ad-  
vantage is produced in two ways.  
Those who are in a situation to  
have access to the bank, can  
have the assistance of loans to  
answer with punctuality the pub-  
lic calls upon them. This ac-  
commodation has been sensibly  
felt in the payment of the duties  
heretofore laid, by those who reé-  
side where establishments of this  
nature exist. This, however,  
though an extensive, is not an u-  
niversal benefit. The other way  
in which the effect here contem-  
plated is produced, and in which  
the benefit is general, is the in-  
creasing of the quantity of cir-  
culating medium, and the quick-  
ening of circulation. The man-  
ner in which the first happens  
has already been traced. The  
last may require some illustra-  
tion. When payments are to be  
made between different places,  
having an intercourse of business  
with each other, if there happen  
to be no private bills at market,  
and there are no bank notes  
which have a currency in both,  
the consequence is, that coin  
must be remitted. This is at-  
tended with trouble, delay, ex-  
pense, and risk. If, on the con-  
trary, there are bank notes cur

rent in both places, the transmis-  
sion of these by the post, or any  
other speedy or convenient con-  
veyance, answers the purpose ;  
and these again, in the alternations  
of demand, are frequently return-  
ed very soon after to the place  
from whence they were first sent;  
whence the transportation and re-  
transportation of the metals are  
obviated ; and a more convenient,  
and more expeditious medium of  
payment is substituted. Nor is  
this all—The metals, instead of  
being suspended from their usual  
functions, during this process of  
vibration from place to place, con-  
tinue in activity, and administer  
still to the ordinary circulation ;  
which of course is prevented  
from suffering either diminution  
or stagnation. These circumstan-  
ces are additional causes of what,  
in a practical sense, or to the  
purposes of business, may be cal-  
led greater plenty of money. And  
it is evident, that whatever en-  
hances the quantity of circulating  
money, adds to the ease with  
which every industrious member  
of the community may acquire  
that portion of it, of which he  
stands in need; and enables him  
the better to pay his taxes, as well  
  
as to supply his other wants.—  
  
Even where the circulation of the  
bank paper is not general, it  
must still have the same effect,  
though in a less degree. For  
whatever furnishes additional sup-  
plies to the channels of circula-  
tion, in one quarter, naturally con-  
tributes to keep the streams ful-  
ler elsewhere. This last view of  
the subject, serves both to illus-  
trate the position, that banks tend  
to facilitate the payment of taxes ;  
and to exemply their utility to  
business of every kind, in which  
money is an agent.  
  
Bog  
  
It would be to intrude too much  
on the patience of the house, to  
prolong the details of the advan-  
tages of banks; especially as all  
those, which might still be par-  
ticularized, are readily to be in-  
ferred as consequences from those  
which have been enumerated.—  
Their disadvantages, real or sup-  
posed, are now to be reviewed.  
The most serious of the charges  
which have been brought against  
them, are-——  
  
That they serve to increase u-  
sury :  
  
That they tend to prevent other  
kinds of lending :  
  
That they furnish temptations  
to over-trading :  
  
That they afford aid to ignorant  
adventurers, who disturb the na-  
tural and beneficial course of  
trade :  
  
That they give to bankrupt and  
fraudulent traders a fictitious cre-  
dit, which enables them to main-  
tain false appearances, and to ex-  
tend their impositions: _ And  
lastly,  
  
That they have a tendency te  
banish gold and silver from the  
country.  
  
There is great reason to be-  
lieve, that on a close and candid  
survey, it will be discovered, that  
these charges, are cither without  
foundation, or that, as far as the  
evils they suggest have been  
found to exist, they have pro-  
ceeded from other, or partial, or  
temporary causes; are not inhe-  
rent in the nature, and permanent  
tendency, of such institutions ; or  
are more than counterbalanced by  
opposite advantages. This sur-  
vey shall be had, in the order in  
which the charges have been sta-  
ted. ‘The first of them is—  
  
That banks serve to increase  
usury.

It is a truth, which ought not  
to be denied, that the method of  
conducting business, which is es-  
sential to bank operations, has  
among’ us, in particular instances,  
given occasion to usurious trans-  
actions. The punctuality in pay-  
ments, which they necessarily ex-  
act, has sometimes obliged those  
who have adventured beyond both  
their capital and credit, to pro-  
cure money, at any price, and  
consequently to resort to usurers  
for aid.  
  
But experience and practice  
gradually bring a cure to this  
evil. A general habit of punc-  
tuality among traders, is the na-  
tural consequence of the neces-  
sity of observing it with the bank ;  
a circumstance which itself more  
than compensates for any occa-  
sional ill which may have sprung  
from that necessity, in the parti-  
cular under consideration. As  
far, therefore, as traders depend  
on each other for pecuniary sup-  
plies, they can calculate their ex-  
pectations with greater certainty ;  
and are in proportionably less  
danger of disappointments, which  
  
. might compel them to have re-  
  
course to so pernicious an expe-  
dient as that of borrowing at usu-  
ry; the mischiefs of which, after  
a few examples, naturally inspire  
great care in all but men of des-  
perate circumstances, to avoid  
the possibility of being subjected  
to then). One, and not the least  
of the evils incident to the use of  
that expedient, if the fact be  
known, or even strongly suspect-  
ed, is loss of credit with the bank  
itself.  
  
The directors of a bank too,  
though in order to extend its bu-  
siness and its popularity, in the  
infancy of an institution, they may  
be tempted to go further in ac-  
commodation than the strict rules  
  
of prudence will warrant, grow  
more circumspect of course, as  
its affairs become better establish-  
ed, and as the eviis of too great  
facility are experimentally de-  
monstrated. Lhey become more  
attentive to the situation and con-  
duct of those witn whom they  
deal ; they observe more narrow-  
ly their operations and pursuits ;  
they economise the credit they  
give tu those of suspicious solid-  
ity ; they refuse it to those whose  
career is more manifestly hazard-  
ous: Ina word, in the course of  
practice, from the very nature of  
things, the interest, will make it  
the policy, of a bank, to succour  
tue wary and industrious; to dis-  
credit the rash and unthrifty ;  
to discountenance both usuri-  
ous lenders and usurious bor-  
rowers.  
  
There is a leading view, in  
which the tendency of banks will ~  
be seen to be, to abridge, rather  
than to promote, usury. This re-  
lates to their property of increas-  
ing the quantity, and quickening  
the circulation, of money. If it  
be evident, that usury will pre-  
vail or diminish, according to the  
proportion which the demand for  
borrowing bears to the quantity  
of money at market to be lent;  
whatever has the property just  
mentioned, whether it be in the  
shape of paper or coin, by con-  
tributing to render the supply  
more equal to the demand, must  
tend to counteract the progress  
of usury.  
  
But bank lending, it is pretend-  
ed, is an impediment to other  
kinds of lending ; which, by con-  
fining the resource of borrowing  
to a particular Class, leaves the  
rest of the community more des-  
titute, and theretore

d embarrassmenits, of such  
a disposition of their money in a  
distant country. Secondly, There  
will always be a considerable pro-  
portion of those who are properly  
the money lenders of a country,  
who, from that spirit of caution  
which usually characterizes this  
description of men, will incline  
rather to vest their funds in mort-  
gages on real estate, than in the  
stock of a bank, which they are  
apt to consider as a more preca-  
rious security.  
  
These considerations serve in  
a material degree to narrow the  
foundation of the objection, as to  
the point of fact. But there is a  
more satisfactory answer to ic.  
The effect supposed, as far as it  
has existence, istemporary. ‘The  
reverse of it takes place in the  
  
231  
  
general, and permanent opera-  
tion of the thing.  
  
The capital of every public  
bank will of course be restricted  
within a certain defined limit. It  
is the province of legislative pru-  
dence so to adjust this limit, that  
while it will not be too contracted  
for the demand, which the course  
of business may create, and for  
the security which the public  
ought to have for the solidity of  
the paper which may be issued  
by the bank, it will still be within  
the compass of the pecuniary re-  
sources of the community; so  
that there may be an easy prac-  
ticability of completing the sub-  
scriptions to it. When this is  
once done, the supposed effect  
of necessity ceases. There is then  
no longer room for the invest-  
ment of any additional capital.—  
Stock may indeed change hands  
by one person selling and another  
ouying; but the money which  
the buyer takes out of the com-  
mon mass to purchase the stock,  
the seller receives and restores  
to it. Hence the future surplus-  
ses which may accumulate must  
take their natural course, and  
lending at interest must go on as  
if there were no such institution.  
  
It must indeed flow in a more  
copious stream. The bank fur-  
nishes an extracrdinary supply for  
borrowers, within its immediate  
sphere. A larger supply conse-  
quently remains for borrowers  
elsewhere. In proportion as the  
circulation of the bank is extend-  
ed, there is an augmentation of  
the aggregate mass of money for  
answering the aggregate mass of  
demand. Hence greater facility  
in obtaining it for every purpose.  
  
It ought not to escape without  
a remark, that as far as the citi-  
zens of other countries become

adventurers in the bank, there is  
  
a positive increase of the gold  
  
and silver of the country. It is  
  
true, that from this a half-yearly  
  
rent is drawn back, «ccruing from  
  
the dividends upon the stock : but  
  
as this rent arises from the em-  
  
ployment of the capital, by our  
  
own Citizens, it is probable, that  
  
it is more than replaced by the  
  
profits of that employment. It is:  
also likely, that a part of it is, in  
  
the course of trade, converted in-  
  
to the products of our country:  
  
and it may even prove an incen-  
tive, in some cases, to emigration  
  
to a country in which the charac-  
ter of citizen is as easy to be ac-  
  
quired, as it is estimable and im-  
portant. This view of the subject  
furnishes an answer to an objec-  
tion which has been deduced from  
the circumstance here taken no-  
tice of, namely, the income re-  
sulting to foreigners from the  
  
part of the stock owned by them,  
which has been represented as  
tending to drain the country of  
its specie. In this objection, the  
original investment of the capital,  
and the constant use of it after-  
wards, seem both to have been  
overlooked.  
  
That banks furnish temptations  
to over-trading, is the third of the  
enumerated objections. This must  
mean, that by affording additional  
aid to mercantile enterprise, they  
induce the merchant sometimes  
to adventure beyond the prudent,  
or salutary point. But the very  
statement of the thing shows,  
that the subject of the charge is  
an occasional ill, incident to a ge-  
neral good. Credit ofevery kind,  
(as a species of which only can  
bank-lending have the effect sup-  
posed,) must be, in different de-  
grees, chargeable with the same  
inconvenience. It is even appli-  
  
cable to gold and silver, when  
they abound in circulation. But  
would it be wise on this account  
to decry the precious metals ; to  
root out credit; or to prescribe  
the means of that enterprise,  
which is the main spring of trade,  
and a principal source of national  
wealth, because it now and then  
runs into excesses, of which over-  
trading is one?  
  
If the abuses of a beneficial  
thing, are to determine its con--  
demnation, there is scarcely a  
source of public prosperity which  
will not speedily be closed. In  
every cage, the evil is tobe com-  
pared with the good ; and in the  
present case, such a comparison  
will issue in this, that the new  
and increased energies derived to  
commercial enterprise, from the  
aid of banks, are a source of ge-  
neral profit and advantage; which  
greatly outweigh the partial ills  
of the over-trading of a few in-  
dividuals, at particular times, or  
of numbers in particular conjunc-  
tures.  
  
The fourth and fifth charges  
may be considered together:  
These relate to the aid which is  
sometimes afforded by banks to  
anskilful adventurers and fraudu-  
lent traders. These charges also  
have some degree of foundation ;  
though far less than has been pre-  
tended, and they add to the in-  
stances of partial ills, connected  
with more extensive and overba-  
lancing benefits.  
  
The practice of giving ficti-  
tious credit to improper persons,  
is one of those evils which expe-  
rience, guided by interest, spee-  
dily corrects. ‘the bank itself is  
in so much jeopardy of being a  
sufferer by it, that it has the  
strongest of all inducements to  
be on its guard. It may not only

be injured immediately by the  
delinquencies of the persons to  
whom such credit is given; but  
eventually, by the incapacities of  
others, whem their impositions

Nor is there much danger of a

error from want of information :  
The directors themselves being  
for the most part selected from  
the class of traders, are to be ex-  
pected to possess individually, an  
accurate knowledge of the cha-  
racters and situations of those  
who come within that description.  
And they have, in addition to this,  
the course of dealing of the per-  
sons themselves with the bank,  
to assist their judgment, which  
is in most cases a good index of  
the state in which those persons  
are. The artifices and shifts,  
which those in desperate or de-  
clining circumstances, are obliged  
to employ to keep up the coun-  
tenance which the rules of the  
bank require, and the train of  
their connexions, are so many  
prognostics, not difficult to be in-  
terpreted, of the fate which a-  
waits them. Tlence it not unfre-  
quently happens, that banks are  
the first to discover the unsound-  
ness of such characters, and by  
withholding credit, to announce  
to the public that they are not en-  
titled to it.  
  
If banks, in spite of every pre-  
caution, are sometimes betrayed  
into giving a false credit to the  
persons described; they more  
frequently enable honest and in-  
dustrious men, of small, or per-  
haps of no capital, to undertake  
and prosecute business, with ad-  
vantage to themselves and to the  
community ; and assist merchants  
of both capital and credit, who

seen shocks, which might, with-  
out such helps, prove fatal to  
them and to others, to make head —  
against their misfortunes, and fi-  
nally to retrieve their affairs; cir-  
cumstances which form no incon-  
siderable encomium on the utility  
of banks.  
  
But the last, and heaviest  
charge, is still to be examined :  
This is, that banks tend to banish  
the gold and silver out of the  
country.  
  
The force of this objection  
resis upon their being an engine  
of paper credit, which by fur-  
nishing a substitute for the me-  
tals, is supposed to promote their  
exportation. It is an objection,  
which, if ic has any foundation,  
lies not against banks peculiarly,  
but against every species of paper  
credit.  
  
The most common answer  
given to it is, that the thing sup-  
posed is of little or no conse-  
quence; that it is immaterial  
what serves the purpose of mo-  
ney ; whether paper, or gold and  
silver; that the effect of both up-  
on industry is the same; and that  
the intrinsic wealth of a nation is  
to be measured, not by the abun-  
dance of the precious

been  
shown, that they augment, in dif-  
ferent ways, the active capital of  
a country. This it is, which ge-  
nerates employment; which ani-  
rates and expands !abour and in-  
dustry. Everyaddition which is  
made to it by contributing to put  
in motion a greater quantity of  
both, tends to create a greater  
quantity of the products of both.  
  
And by furnishing more materi-  
als for exportation, conduces to  
a favourable balance of trade,  
and consequently to the intro-  
duction and increase of gold and  
silver.  
  
This conclusion appears to be  
drawn solid prer-ises :  
There are, however, objections  
to be made to it.  
  
It may be said, that as bank  
paper affords a substitute for  
specie, it serves to counteract  
that rigorous necessity for the  
metals as a medium of circula-  
tion, which, in the case of a  
wrong balance might restrain, in  
some degree, their exportation ;  
and it may be added, that from  
the same cause, in the same Case,  
it would retard those economical  
and parsimonious reforms in the  
manner of living, which the  
scarcity of money is calculated to  
produce, and which might be ne-  
cessary to rectify such wrong ba-  
lance.  
  
There is, perhaps, some truth  
in both these observations; but  
they appear to be of a nature ra-  
ther to form exceptions to the ge-  
nerality of the conclusion, than to  
overthrow it. The state of things,  
in which the absolute exigencies  
of circulation can be supposed to  
resist with any effect the urgent  
demands for specie which a wrong  
balance of trade may occasion,  
presents an extreme case. And  
a situation in which a too expen-  
sive manner of living of a com-  
munity, compared with its means,  
can stand in need of a corrective,  
from distress or necessity ; is one  
which perhaps rarely results, but  
from extraordinary and adventiti-  
ous causes: such, for example,  
as a national revolution; which  
unsettles all the established ha-  
bits of a people, and inflames the

appetite for extravagance, by the  
illusions of an ideal wealth, en-  
gendered by the continual multi-  
plication of a depreciating cur-  
rency, or some similar cause.  
There is good reason to believe,  
that where the laws are wise and  
well executed, and the inviolabi-  
lity of property and contracts  
maintained ; the economy of a  
people will, in the general course  
of things, correspond with its  
means.  
  
The support of industry, is  
probably in every case, of iore  
consequence towards correcting  
a wrong balance of trade, than any  
practicable retrenchments in the  
expenses of families or individu-  
als; and the stagnation of it  
would be likely to have more ef-  
fect in prolonging, than any such  
savings in shortening, its continu-  
ance. That stagnation, is a natu-  
ral consequence of an inadequate  
medium, which, without the aid  
of bank circulation, would, in the  
cases supposed, be severely felt.  
  
It also deserves notice, that as  
the circulation of a bank is always  
in acompound ratio to the fund  
upen which it depends, and to  
the demand for it; and as that  
fund is itself aifected by the ex-  
portation of the metals, there is  
no danger of its being oversteck-  
ed, as in the case of paper issued  
at the pleasure of the govern-  
ment; or of its preventing the  
consequences of any unfavoura-  
ble balance from being suiliciently  
felt to produce the reforms allud-  
ed to, as far as circumstances  
may require and admit.  
  
Nothing can be more fallible  
than the comparisons which have  
been made between different  
countries, to illustraie the truth  
of the position under considera-  
tion——The comparative quantity  
  
of gold and silver, in different  
countries, depends upon an infi-  
nite variety of facts and combi-  
nations, all of which ought to be  
known, in order to judge whether  
the existence, or non-existence,  
of paper currencies, hasany share  
in the relative proportions they  
contain. The mass and value of  
the productions of the labour and  
industry of each, compared with  
its wants; the nature of its esta-  
blishments abroad; the kind of  
war&#x27;s in which it is usually engag-  
ed; the relations it bears to the  
countries which are the original  
possessors of those metals; the  
privileges it enjoys in their  
trade ; these, and a number of o-  
ther circumstances, are all to be  
taken into the account, and ren-  
der the investigation too complex  
to justify any reliance on the vague  
and general surmises, which have  
been hitherto hazarded on the  
point.  
  
In the foregoing discussion,  
the objection has been considered  
as applying to the permanent ex-  
pulsion and diminution of the  
metals. Their temporary expor-  
tation, for particular purposes,  
has not been contemplated: This,  
it must be confessed, is facilitated  
by banks, from the faculty banks  
possess of supplying their place.  
But their utility is in nothing  
more conspicuous, than in these  
very cases. They enable the  
government to p.y its foreign  
debts, and to answer any exlyen-  
cies which the external concerns  
of the community may have pro-  
duced. They enable the mer-  
chant to support his credit, (of  
which the prosperity of trade  
depends,) when special cireumn-  
stances prevent remittances in  
other modes. They enable him  
also to prosecute enterprises,

which ultimately tend to an aug-  
mentation of the species of  
wealth in question. It is evident,  
that gold and silver may often be  
employed in procuring commo-  
dities abroad ; which, ina circuit-  
ous commerce, replace the origi-  
nal fund, with considerable addi-  
tion. But it is not to be inferred  
from this facility given to tempo-  
rary exportation, that banks,  
which are so friendly to trade  
and industry, are in their general  
tendency inimical to the increase  
of the precious metals.  
  
These several views of the  
subject, appear sufficient to im-  
press a full conviction of the uti-  
lity of banks, and to demonstrate  
  
that they are of great importance, _  
  
not only in relation to the admin-  
istration of the finances, but in the  
general system of the political e-  
conomy.  
  
The judgment of many con-  
cerning them has, no doubt, been  
  
rplexed by the misinterpreta-  
tion of appearances, which were  
to be ascribed to other causes.  
The general devastation of perso-  
nal property, occasioned by the  
late war, naturally produced on  
the one hand, a great demand for  
money ; and on the other, a  
great deficiency of it to answer  
the demand, Some injudicious  
laws, which grew out of the pub-  
lic distresses, by impairing confi-  
dence, and causing a part of the  
inadequate sum in the country to  
be locked up, aggravated the e-  
vil: The dissipated habits, con-  
tracted by many individuals dur-  
ing the war, which after the  
‘peace plunged them into ex-  
penses beyond their incomes ; the  
number of adventurers without  
capital, and in many instances  
without information, who at that  
  
epoch rushed into trade, and  
were obliged to make any sacri-  
fices to support a transient cre -  
dit; the employment of conside-  
rable suins in speculations upon  
the public debt, which from its  
unsettied state was incapable of  
becoming itself a substitute: all  
these circumstances concurring,  
necessarily led to usurious bor-  
rowing ; produced most of the  
inconveniencies, and were the  
true cause of most of the ap-  
pearances, which, where banks  
were established, have been by  
some erroneously placed to their  
account: a mistake which they  
might easily have avoided, by  
turning their eyes towards places  
where there were none; and  
where, nevertheless, the same e-  
vils would have been perceived to  
exist, even ina greater degrec  
than where those institutions had  
obtained. é  
These evils have either ceased,  
or been greatly mitigated. Their  
more complete extinction may  
be looked for from that additional  
security to property, which the  
constitution of the United States  
happily gives; (a circumstance  
of prodigious moment in the  
scale, both of public and private  
prosperity,) from the attraction  
of foreign capital, under the aus-  
pices of that security, to be em-  
ployed upon objects, and in enter-  
prises, for which the state of this  
country opens a wide and invit-  
ing field; from the consistency,  
and stability, which the public  
debt is fast acquiring, as well in  
the public opinion at home and  
abroad, as in fact; from the aug-  
mentation of capital, which that  
circumstance, and the quarter-  
yearly payment of interest will  
afford ; and from the more copi

ous circulation, which will be  
likely to be created by a well-  
constituted national bank.  
  
The establishment of banks in  
this country, seems to be recom-  
mended by reasons of a peculiar  
nature. Previously to the revo-  
lution, circulation was in a great  
measure carried on by paper e-  
mitted by the several local go-  
vernments. In Pennsylvania a-  
lone, the quantity of it was near  
a million and a half of dollars.  
This auxiliary may be said to be  
now at anend. And it is gene-  
rally supposed, that there has  
been for some time past, a defici-  
ency of circulating medium. How  
far that deficiency is to be consi-  
dered as real or imaginary, is not  
susceptible of demonstration ; but  
there are circumstances and ap-  
pearances, which, in relation to  
the country at large, countenance  
the supposition of its reality.  
  
The circumstances are, besides  
the fact just mentioned respecting  
paper emissions; the vast tracts  
of waste land, and the little ad-  
vanced state of manufactures.  
The progressive settlement of  
the former, while it promises  
ample retribution, in the genera-  
tion of future resources, dimin-  
ishes or obstructs, in the mean  
time, the active wealth of the  
country. It not only draws off a  
part of the circulating money,  
and places it in a more passive  
state, but it diverts into its own  
channels, a portion of that species  
of Jabour and industry, which  
would otherwise be employed in  
furnishing materials for foreign  
trade ; and which, by contributing  
to a favourable balance, would as-  
sist the introduction of specie.  
In the early periods of new set-  
tlements, the settlers not only  
furnish no surplus for esporta-  
  
tion, but they consume a part of  
that which is produced by the la-  
bour of others. ‘he same thing  
is a cause, that manufactures do  
not advance, or advance slowly.  
And notwithstanding some hypo-  
theses to the contrary, there are  
many things to induce a suspi-  
cion, that the precious metals will  
net abound in any country which  
has not mines, or variety of ma-  
nufactures. They have been  
sometimes acquired by the sword ;  
but the modern system of war  
has expelled this resource; and  
it is one upon which it is to be  
hoped the United States will ne-  
ver be inclined to rely.  
  
The appearances alluded to,  
are, greater prevalency of direct  
barter, in the more interior dig-  
tricts of the country, which, how-  
ever, has been for some time  
past, gradually lessening; and  
greater difficulty generally in the  
advantageous alienation of im-  
proved real estate; which also  
has of late diminished, but is still  
seriously felt in different parts of  
the union. The difficulty of get-  
ting money, which has been a  
general complaint, is not added  
to the number; because it is the  
compiaint of all times, and onc  
in which imagination must ever  
have too great scope to permitan  
appeal to it.  
  
If the supposition of such a  
deficiency be in any degree foun-  
ded; and some aid to circulation  
be desirable, it remains to inguire  
what ought to be the nature of  
that aid  
  
The emitting of paper money  
by the authority of government,  
is wisely prohibited to the indivi-  
dual states, by the national con-  
stitution; and the spirit of that  
prohibition ought not to be dis-  
regarded by the government of

the United States. Though pa-  
per emissions, under a general  
authority, might have some advan-  
tages not applicable, and be free  
from some disadvantages which  
are applicable, to the like emis-  
  
. sions by the states separately ;  
  
yet they are of a nature so liable  
to abuse, and it may even be af-  
firmed, so certain of being abus-  
ed; that the wisdom of the go-  
vernment will be shown in never  
trusting itself with the use of so  
seducing and dangerous an expe-  
dient. In times of tranquillity,  
it might have no ill consequence ;  
it might even perhaps be manag-  
ed in a way to be productive of  
good ; but in great and trying e-  
mergencies, there is almost a mo-  
ral certainty of its becoming mis-  
chievous. The stamping of pa-  
per is an operation so much easi-  
er than the laying of taxes, that  
a government, in the practice of  
paper emissions, would rarely  
fail in any such emergency, to in-  
dulge itself too far in the em-  
ployment of that resource, to a-  
void as much as possible, one less  
auspicious to present popularity.  
If it should not even be carried  
so far as to be rendered an abso-  
lute bubble, it would at least be  
likely to be extended to a degree  
which wouid occasion an inflated  
and artificial state of things, in-  
compatible with the regular and  
prosperous course of the political  
economy.  
  
Among other material differ-  
ences botween a paper currency,  
issued by the mere authority of  
government, and one issued by a  
bank, payable in coin, is this:  
that in the first case, there is no  
standard to which an appeal can  
be made, as to the quantity which  
  
will only satisfy, or which wiil sur-  
  
charge the circuiation ; in the last,  
  
that standard results from the  
demand. If more should be is-  
sued than is necessary, it will re-  
turn upon the bank. Its emis-  
sions, as elsewhere intimated,  
must always be in a compound  
ratio to the fund and the demand:  
—\Vhence it is evident, that  
there is a limitation in the nature  
of the thing; while the discre-  
tion of the government is the on-  
ly measure of the extent of the  
emissions, by its own authority.  
  
This consideration further il-  
lustrates the danger of emissions  
of that sort, and the preference  
which is due to bank paper.  
  
The payment of the interest of  
the public debt, at thirteen dif-  
ferent places, is a weighty reason,  
peculiar to our immediate situa-  
tion, for desiring a bank circula-  
tion. Without a paper, in gene-  
ral currency, ejuivalent to gold  
and silver, a considerable propor-  
tion of the specie of the coun-  
try must always be suspended  
from circulation, and left to accu-  
mulate, prepariturily to each day  
of payment; and as often as one  
approaches, there must in sevc-  
ral cases be an actual transporta-  
tion of the metals at both expense  
and risk, from their natural and  
proper reservoirs, to distant pla-  
ces. This necessity will be felt  
very injuriously to the trade of  
some of the states ; and will em-  
barrass not a little the operations  
of the treasury in those states.  
It will also obstruct those neo-  
tiations, between different parts  
of the union, by the instrumen-  
tality of treasury bills, which have  
already afforded valuable accom-  
modations to trade in general.  
  
Assuming it then as a conse-

MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES,  
  
—Is there no such institution, al-  
ready in being, which has aclaim  
to thet character, and which su-  
persedes the propriety or neces-  
sity of another? If there be none,  
what are the principles upon  
which one ought to be establish-  
ed?  
  
There are at present three  
banks in the United States; that  
of North America, established in  
the city of Philadelphia ; that of  
New York, established in the ci-  
ty of New York; that of Massa-  
chusetts, established in the town  
of Boston. Of these three, the  
first is the only one which has at  
any time had a direct relation to  
the government of the United  
States.  
  
The bank of North America  
originated in a resolution of Con-  
gress of the 26th of May, 1781,  
founded upon a proposition of the  
superintendent of finance, which  
was afterwards carried into exe-  
cution by an ordinance of the 31st  
of December following, entitled,  
‘¢ An ordinance to incorporate the  
subscribers to the bank of North  
America.”  
  
The aid afforded to the United  
States by this institution, during  
the remaining period of the war,  
was of essential consequence ; and  
its conduct towards them since  
the peace, has not weakened its  
title to their patronage and fivor.  
So far its pretensions to the cha-  
racter in question are respecta-  
ble; but there are circumstances  
which militate against them ; and  
considerations which indicate the  
propriety of an establishment on  
different principles.  
  
The directors of this bank, on  
behalf of their constituents, have  
since accepted and acted under a  
new charter from the state of  
Pennsylvania, materially varient  
  
239  
  
from their original one; and  
which so narrows the foundation  
of the institution, as to render it  
an incompetent basis for the ex-  
tensive purposes of a national  
bank.  
  
The limit assigned by the ordi-  
nance of Congress to the stock  
of the bank, is ten millions of dol-  
lars. The last charter of Penn-  
sylvania confines it to two mil-  
lions. Questions naturally arise,  
whether there be not a direct re-  
pugnancy between two charters  
so differently circumstanced; and  
whether the acceptance of the  
one, 1s not to be dee :ed a virtual  
surrender of the other? But per-  
haps it is neither adviseable nor  
necessary, to attempt a solution  
of them.  
  
There is nothing in the acts of  
Congress, which imply an exclu-  
sive right in the institution to  
which they relate, except during  
the term of the war. There is  
therefore nothing, if the public  
good require it, which prevents  
the establishment of another. It  
may, however, be incidentally re-  
marked, that in the general opi-  
nion of the citizens of the United  
States, the bank of North America  
has taken the station of a bank of  
Pennsylvania only. This is a  
strong argument for a new insti-  
tution, or for a renovation of the  
old, to restore it to the situation  
in which it originally stood, in the  
view of the United States.  
  
But though the ordinance of  
Congress contains no grant of  
exclusive privileges, there may  
be room to allere, that the go-  
vernment of the United States  
ought not, in point of candor and  
equity, to establish any rival or  
interfering institution, in preju-  
dice of the one already establish-  
ed, especially as this has, from  
  
if

services rendered, well-founded  
claims to protection and regard.  
  
The justice of such an observa-  
tion ought, within proper bounds  
to be admitted. A new establish-  
ment of the sort ought not to be  
made without cogent and sincere  
reasons of public good. And in  
the manner of doing it, every fa-  
cility should be given to a con-  
solidation of the old with the new,  
upon terms not injurious to the  
parties concerned. But there is  
no ground to maintain, that in a  
case,-in which the government  
has made no condition restricting  
its authority, it ought voluntarily  
to restrict it, through regard to  
the interests of a particular in-  
stitution, when those of the state  
dictate a different course; espe-  
cially too, after such circumstan-  
ces have intervened, as charac-  
terize the actual situation of the  
bank of North America.  
  
The inducements to a new dis-  
  
sition of the thing are now to  
be considered. ‘The first of them  
which occurs is, the, at least  
ambiguous situation in which the  
bank of North America has pla-  
ced itself, by the acceptance of  
its last charter: If this has ren-  
dered it the mere bank of a par-  
ticular state, liable to dissolution  
at the expiration of fourteen years,  
to which term the act of that  
state has restricted its duration ;  
it would be neither fit nor expe-  
dient, to accept it as an equiva-  
lent for a bank of the United  
States.  
  
The restriction of its capital  
also, which, according to the same  
supposition, cannot be extended  
beyond two millions of dollars, is  
a conclusive reason for a different  
establishment. So small a capi-  
tal promises neither the requisite  
aid to government, nor the re-  
  
quisite security to the communi-  
ty. It may answer very well the  
purposes of local accommodation,  
but is an inadequate foundation  
fora circulation co-extensive with  
the United States; embracing the  
whole of their revenues, and af-  
fecting every individual into whose  
hands the paper may come.  
And inadequate as such a capi-  
tal would be tothe essential ends  
of a national bank, it is liable to  
be rendered still more so, by that  
principle of the constitution of  
the bank of North America, con-  
tained equally in its old, and in its  
new charter, which leaves the in-  
crease of the actual capital at any  
time, (now far short of the allow-  
ed extent,) to the discretion of the  
directors or stockholders. It is  
naturally to be expected, that the  
allurements of an advanced price  
of stock, and of large dividends,  
may disincline those who are t-  
terested, to an extension of capi-  
tal; from which they will be apt  
to fear a diminution of profits. —  
And from this circumstance, the  
interest and accommodation of the  
public, (as well individually as col-  
lectively,) are made more subor-  
dinate to the interest, real or ima-  
gined, of the stockholders, than  
they ought to be. It is true, that  
unless the latter be consulted,  
there can be no bank, (in the sense  
at least in which institutions ot  
this kind, worthy of confidence,  
can be established in this coun-  
try.) But it does not follow, that  
this is alone to be consulted, or  
that it even ought to be para-  
mount. Public utility is more  
truly the object of public banks,  
than private profit. And it is the  
business of government, to con-  
stitute them on such principles,  
  
that while the latter will result,’  
in a sufficient degree, to afford!

competent motives to engage in  
them, the former be not made  
subservient to it. To effect this,  
a principal object of attention  
ought to be, to give free scope to  
the creation of an ample capital ;  
and with this view, fixing the  
bounds which are deemed safe  
and convenient, to leave no dis-  
cretion either to stop short of  
them, or to over-pass them. The  
want of this precaution, in the  
establishment of the bank of North  
America, is a further, and an im-  
portant reason, for desiring one  
differently constituted.  
  
There may be room at first  
sight, for a supposition, that as  
the profits of the bank will bear  
a proportion to the extent of its  
operations ; and as, for this rea-  
son, the interest of the stockhol-  
ders will not be disadvantageous-  
ly affected by any necessary aug-  
mentations of capital; there is no  
cause to apprehend that they will  
be indisposed to such augmenta-  
tions. But most men, in metters  
of this nature, prefer the certain-  
ties they enjoy, to probabilities  
cepending on untried experi-  
ments; especially when these  
promise rather that they will not  
be injured, than that they will be  
benefitted.  
  
From the influence of this prin-  
ciple, and a desire of enhancing  
its profits, the directors of a bank  
will be more apt to overstrain its  
faculties, in an attempt to face the  
additional demands which the  
course of business may create,  
than to set on foot new subscrip-  
tions, which may hazard a dimi-  
nution of the profits, and even a  
temporary reduction of the price  
of stock.  
  
Banks are among the best ex-  
  
)pedients for lowering the rate of -  
  
VOL. VII.  
  
interest in a country; but to have  
this effect, their capitals must be  
completely equal to all the de-  
mands of business, and such as  
will tend to remove the idea, that  
the accon modations they afford,  
are in any degree favours; an  
idea very apt to accompany the  
parsimonious dispensation of con-  
tracted funds. In this, as in eve-  
ry other case, the pienty of the  
commodity ought to beget a mo-  
deration of the price.  
  
The want of a principle of ro-  
tation, in the constitution of the  
bank of North Ameriea, is ano-  
ther argument for a variation of  
the establishment. Searcely one  
of the reasons which militate a-  
gainst this principle in the con-  
stitution of a country, is applica-  
ble to that of a bank; while there  
are strong reasons in favour of it,  
in relation to the one, which do  
not apply to the other. The  
knowlege to be derived from ex-  
perience, is the only circumstance  
common to both, which pleads a-  
gainst rotation in the directing of-  
ficers of a bank.  
  
But the objects of the govern-  
ment of a nation, and those of the  
government of a bank, are so  
widely different, as greatly to  
weaken the force of that consi-  
deration, in reference to the /at-  
ter. Almost every Important  
case of legisiation requires, to-  
wards a right decision, a general  
and aecurate acgucintance with  
the affairs of the state; and ha-  
bits of thinking seldom acaui:ed  
but from a familiarity with public  
concerns. The administration of  
a bank, on the contrary, ts regu-  
lated by a few simpic fixed max-  
ims, the application of which is  
not dificult to any mean of judg-  
ment, especially if instructed in

the principles of trade. It is in  
general a constant succession of  
the same details.  
  
But though this be the case, the  
idea of the advantages of expe-  
rience, is not to be slighted:  
Room ought to be left for the re-  
  
lar transmission of official in-  
ormation ; and for this purpose,  
the head of the direction ought  
to be excepted from the principle  
of rotation. With this exception,  
and with the aid of the informa-  
tion of the subordinate officers,  
there can be no danger of any ill  
effects from want of experience,  
or knowledge; especially as the  
periodical exclusion ought not to  
reach the whole of the directors  
at one time.  
  
The argument in favor of the  
principle of rotation is this; that  
by lessening the danger of com-  
binations among the directors, to  
make the institution subservient  
to party views, or to the accom-  
modation, preferably, of any par-  
ticular set of men, it will render  
the public confidence more firm,  
stable, and unqualified.  
  
When it is considered, that the  
directors of a bank are not elect-  
ed by the great body of the com-  
munity, in which a diversity of  
views will naturally prevail, at  
different conjunctures; but by a  
small and select class of men,  
among whom it is far more easy  
to cultivate a steady adherence to  
ihe same persons and objects;  
and that those directors have it in  
their power so immediately to  
conciliate, by obliging the most  
influential of this class, it is easy  
to perceive, that without the prin-  
ciple of roiation, changes in that  
bedy can rarely happen, but as a  
conccssion which they may them-  
sclves think it expedient to make  
to public opinion.  
  
The continual administratior  
of an institution of this kind, by  
the same persons, will never fail,  
with or without cause, from their  
conduct, to excite distrust and  
discontent. The necessary se-  
crecy of their transactions, gives  
unlimited scope to imagination to  
infer that something is, or may  
be, wrong. And this inevitable  
mystery is a solid reason for in-  
serting in the constitution of a  
bank the necessity of a change of  
men. As neither the mass of the  
  
rties interested, nor the public  
in general, can be permitted to  
be witnesses of the interior ma-  
nagement of the directors, it is  
reasonable that both should have  
that check upon their conduct,  
and that security against the pre-  
valency of a partial or pernicious  
system, which will be produced  
by the certainty of periodical  
changes. Such too is the deli-  
cacy of the credit of a bank, that  
every thing which can fortify  
confidence and repel suspicion,  
without injuring its operations,  
ought carefully to be sought after  
in its formation.  
  
A further consideration in fa-  
  
vour of a change, is the improper |  
rule, by which the right of voting |  
  
for directors is regulated in the  
  
plan upon which the bank of |  
  
North America was originally  
constituted; namely, a vote for  
each share, and the want of a rule  
in the last charter; unless the si-  
lence of it on that point, may sig-  
nify that every stockholder is to  
have an equal and a single vote,  
which would be a rule in a dif-  
ferent extreme, not less errone-  
ous. It is of importance that a  
rule should be established on this  
  
head, as it is one of those things |  
  
which ought not to be left to dis-  
  
cretion ; and it is consequently of

equal importance, that the rule  
should be a proper one.  
A vote for each share, renders  
a combination between a few prin-  
cipal stockholders, to monopolize  
the power and benefits of the  
bank, too easy. An equal vote to  
each stockholder, however great  
or small his interest in the insti-  
tution, allows not that degree of  
weight to large stockholders,  
which it is reasonable they should  
have, and which perhaps their  
security, and that of the bank,  
require. A prudent mean is to  
be preferred. &lt;A conviction of  
this, has produced a by-law of the  
corporation of the bank of North  
America, which evidently aims  
at such a mean. But a reflection  
arises here, that a like majority  
with that which enacted this law,  
may at any moment repeal it.  
The last inducement which  
shall be mentioned, is the want of  
precautions to guard against a  
foreign influence insinuating it-  
self into the direction of the  
bank. It seems scarcely recon-  
cileable with a due caution, to  
permit, that any but citizens  
should be eligible, as directors of  
a national bank, or that non-resi-  
dent foreigners should be able to  
influence the appointment of di-  
rectors, by the votes of their  
proxies. In the event, however,  
of an incorporation of the bank  
of North America, in the plan,  
it may be necessary to qualify  
this principle, so as to leave the  
right of foreigners, who now hold  
shares of its stock, unimpaired,  
but without the power of trans-  
mitting the privilege in question,  
to foreign aliances.  
It is to be considered, that such  
a bank is not a mere matter of  
private property, but a political  
  
machine of the greatest import-  
ance to the state.  
  
There are other variations from  
the constitution of the bank of  
North America, not of inconsi-  
derable moment, which appear  
desirable, but which are not of  
magnitude enough to claim a  
preliminary discussion: These  
will be seen in the plan which  
will be submitted in the sequel.  
  
If the objections which have  
been stated, to the constitution of  
the bank of North America, are  
admitted to be well founded, they  
will nevertheless not derogate  
from the merit of the main de-  
sign, or of the services which  
that bank has rendered, or of the  
benefits which it has produced.  
The creation of such an institu-  
tion, at the time it took place,  
was a measure dictated by wis-  
dom. Its utility has been amply  
evinced by its fruits—American  
independence owes much to it.—  
And it is very conceivable, that  
reasons of the moment, may have  
rendered those features in it in-  
expedient, which a revision with  
a permanent view, suggests as  
desirable.  
  
Tie order of the subject, leads  
next to an inquiry into the prin-  
ciples upon which a national bank  
ought to be organized.  
  
The situation of the United  
States naturally inspires a wish,  
that the form of the institution  
could admit of a plurality of  
branches. But various conside-  
rations discourage from pursuing  
this idea. ‘The complexity of  
such a plan would be apt to in-  
spire doubts, which might deter  
from adventuring in it: And the  
practicability of a safe and orders  
ly administration, though not to  
be abandoned as desperate, can

not be made so manifest in per-  
spective, as to promise the remo-  
val of those doubts, or to justify  
the government in adopting the  
idea as an original experiment.  
The most that would seem ad-  
viseable, on this point, is to in-  
sert a provision, which may lead  
to it hereafter, if experience shall  
more clearly demonstrate its u-  
tility, and satisfy those who may  
have the direction, that it may be  
adopted with safety. It is cer-  
tain, that it would have some ad-  
vantages, botii peculiar and im-  
portant.—Besides more general  
accommodation, it would lessen  
the danger of a run upon the  
bank.  
  
The argument against it is, that  
each branch must be under a dis-  
tinct, though subordinate direc-  
tion, to which a considerable lati-  
tude of discretion must of neces-  
sity be intrusted. And as the pro-  
perty of the whole institution  
would be liable for the engage-  
ments of each part; ‘that, and its  
credit, would be at stake upon  
the prudence of the directors of  
every part. ‘he mismanagement  
of either branch might hazard se-  
rious disorder in the whole.  
  
Another wish, dictated by the  
particular situation of the coun-  
try, is, that the bank could be so  
constituted as to be made an im-  
mediate instrument of loans tothe  
proprietors of land; but this wish  
also yields to the difficulty of ac-  
complishing it. Land is alone an  
unfit fund for a bank circulation:  
If the notes issued upon it were  
not to be payable in coin, on de-  
mand, or at a short date, this  
would amount to nothing more  
than a repetition of the paper  
emissions, which are now explo-  
ded by the general voice. If the  
notes are to be payable in coin,  
  
the land must first be converted  
into it, by sale or mortgage. The  
dificulty of effecting the latter,  
is the very thing which begets  
the desire of finding another re-  
source; and the former would  
not be practicable on a sudden  
emergency, but with sacrifices  
which would make the cure  
worse than the disease. Neither  
is the idea of constituting the  
fund partly of coin and partly of  
land, free from impediments:  
these two species of property do  
not, for the most part, unite in  
the same hands. Will the mo-  
nied man consent to enter into a  
partnership with the landholder,  
by which the latter will share in  
the profits which wiil be made by  
the money of the former? The  
money, it is evident, will be the  
agent or efficient cause of the  
profits—the land can only be re-  
garded as an additional security.  
It is not difficult to foresee, that  
an union, on such terms, will not  
readily be formed. If the land-  
holders are to procure the money  
by sale or mortgage of a part of  
their lands, this they can as well  
do, when the stock consists whol-  
ly of money, as if it were to be  
compounded of money and land.  
  
To procure for the landholders  
the assistance of loans, is the  
great desideratum. Supposing  
other difficulties surmounted, and  
a fund created, composed partly  
of coin and partly of land, yet  
the benefit contemplated could  
only then be obtained, by the  
banks advancing them its notes  
for the whole, or part of the value  
of the lands they had subscribed  
to the stock. If this advance was  
small, the relief aimed at would  
not Le given; if it was large, the  
quantity of notes issued would be  
a cause of distrust, and, if receiy

ed at all, they would be likely to  
return speedily upon the bank  
for payment; which, after ex-  
hausting its coin, might be under  
the necessity of turning its lands  
into money, at any price that  
could be obtained for them, to  
the irreparable prejudice of the  
proprietors.  
  
Considerations of public ad-  
vantage suggest a further wish,  
which is, that the bank could be  
established upon principles that  
would cause the profits of it to  
redound to the immediate benefit  
of the state. This is contem-  
plated by many who speak of a  
national bank, but the idea seems  
liable to insuperable objections.  
To attach full confidence to an  
institution of this nature, it ap-  
pears to be an essential ingredi-  
ent in its structure, that it shall  
be under a private, not a public  
direction, under the guidance of  
individual interest, not of public  
policy ; which would be supposed  
to be, and in certain emergeiicies,  
under a feeble or too sanguine  
administration, would really be,  
liabie to being too much influ-  
enced by public necessity. The  
suspicion of this, would most  
probably be a canker that would  
continually corode the vitals of  
the credit of the bank, and would  
be most likely to prove fatal in  
those situations in which the pub-  
lic good would require that they  
should be most sound and vigor-  
ous. It would, indeed, be little  
less than a miracle, should the  
credit of the bank be at the dis-  
posal of the government, if ina  
long series of time, there was not  
experienced a calamitous abuse  
of it. It is true, that it would  
be the real interest of the govern-  
ment not to abuse it; its genuine  
policy to husband and cherish it  
  
with the most guarded circum-  
spection, as an inestimable trea-  
sure. But what government e-  
ver uniformly consulted its true  
interests, in opposition to the  
temptations of momentary exi-  
eencies ? What nation was evér  
blessed with a constant succes-  
sion of upright and wise adminis-  
trators ?  
  
The keen, steady, and as it  
were, magnetic sense of their  
own interest as proprictors, ia  
the directors of a bank, pointing  
invariable to its true pole, the  
prosperity of the institution ; is  
the only security that can always  
be relied upon fora careful and  
prudent administration. It is,  
therefore, the only basis on which  
an enlightened, unqualified, and  
permanent confidence, can be  
expected to be erected and muin-  
tained.  
  
The precedents of the banks  
established in several cities of  
Europe; Amsterdam, Hamburg,  
and others; may seem to mili-  
tate against this position. With-  
out a precise knowledge of all  
the peculiarities of their respect-  
ive constitutions, it is difficult to  
pronounce how far this may be  
the case. That of Amsterdam,  
however, which we best know, is  
rather under a municipal than a  
governmental direction. Pariicu-  
lar magistrates of the city, not  
officers of the republic, have the  
management of it. Itis also a  
bank of deposit, not of loan, or  
circulation ; consequently, less  
liable to abuse, as well as less  
useful. lis general business con-  
sists in receiving money for safe  
keeping, which if not called for  
within a certain time, becomes a  
part of its stock, and irreclaima-

being transferable, answers all the  
purposes of money.  
  
The directors being magis-  
trates of the city, and the stock-  
hoiders, im xeneral, its most in-  
fluential citizens; it is evident,  
that the principle of private inte-  
rest must be prevalent in the ma-  
  
ment of the bank. And it  
is equally evident, that from the  
nature of its operations, that  
principle is less essential to it,  
than to an institution constituted  
with a view to the accommodation  
of the public and individuals, by  
direct&quot;loans and a paper circula-  
tion.  
  
As far as may concern the aid  
of the bank, within the proper  
limits, a good government has  
nothing more to wish for, than it  
will always possess; though the  
management be in the hands of  
private individuals. As the in-  
stitution, if rightly constituted,  
must depend for its renovation  
from time to time on the plea-  
sure of the government, it will  
not be likely to feel a disposition  
to render itself by its conduct,  
unworthy of public patronage.  
The government too, in the ad-  
ministration of its finances, has  
it in its power to reciprocate be-  
nefits to the bank, of not less  
importance than those which the  
hank affords to the government,  
and which, besides, are never un-  
attended with an immediate and  
a;equate compensation.  Inde-  
pendent of these more particular  
considerations, the natural weight  
and influence of a good govern-  
ment will always go far towards  
procuring a compliance with its  
desires; and as the directors wiil  
~ wsualiy be composed of some of  
the most. discreet, respectuble,  
and well-informed citizens, it can  
hardly ever be difficult to make  
  
them sensible of the force of the  
inducements which ought to sti-  
mulate their exertions.  
  
It will not follow, from what  
has been said, that the state may  
not be the holder of a part of the  
  
stock of a bank, and consequent-  
  
ly a sharer in the profits of it. It  
will only follow, tiat it ought not  
to desire any participation in the  
direction of it, and therefore,  
ought not to own the whole ora  
principal part of the stock ; for  
if the mass of the property should  
belong to the public, and if the  
direcuon of it should be in. pri-  
vate hands, this wonld be to com-  
mit the interests of tie state to  
persons not interested, or not e-  
nough interested in their proper  
management.  
  
There is one thing, however,  
which the government owes to  
itself and to the community ; at  
Jeast to all that part of it who are~  
not stockholders ; which is to re-  
serve to itself a right of ascer-  
taining, as often as may be neces-  
sary, the state of the bank, ex-  
cluding, however, all pretension  
to control. This right forms an  
article in the primitive constitu-  
tion of the bank of North Ame-  
rica, and its propriety stands up-  
on the clearest reasons. If the  
paper of a bank is to be permit-  
ted to insinuate itself into all the  
revenues and receipts of a coun-  
try; if itis even to be tolerated  
as the substitute for gold and sil-  
ver in all the transactions of bu-  
siness ; it becomes, in either  
view, a national concern of the  
first magnitude. As such, the  
ordinary rules of prudence re-  
quire, that the government

III. The respective sums sub-  
scribed, shall be payable in four  
equal parts, as well specie as  
debt, in succession, and at the  
distance of six calendar months  
from each other; the first pay-  
ment to be made at the time of  
subscription. If there shall be  
a failure in any subsequent pay-  
ment, the party failing shall lose  
the benefit of any dividend which  
may have accrued prior to the  
time for making such payment,  
and during the delay of the same.  
  
IV. The subscribers to the  
bank, and their successors, shall  
be incorporated, and shall so  
continue, until the final redemp-  
tion of that part of its stock  
which shall consist of the public  
debt.  
  
V. The capacity of the corpo-  
ration to hold real and personal  
estate, shall be limited to fifteen  
millions of dollars, including the  
amount of its capital or original  
stock. The lands and tenements  
which it shall be permitted to  
hold, shall be only such as shall  
be requisite for the immediate  
accommodation of the institution ;  
and such as shall have been bona  
fide mortgaged to it by way of  
security, or conveyed to it in sa-  
tisfaction of debts previously con-  
tracted, in the usual course of  
its dealings, or purchased at  
sales upon judyments which shall  
have been ebtained for such debts.  
  
VI. The totality of the debts of  
the company, whether by bond,  
bill, note, or other contract, (cre-  
dits for deposits excepted,) shall  
never exceed the amount of its  
capital stock. In case of excess,  
the directors, under whose admi-  
nistration it shall happen, shall  
be liable for it in their private  
or separate capacities. Those  
who may have dissented, may

excuse themselves from this res-  
ponsibility, by immediately giv-  
ing notice of the fact and their  
dissent, to the president of the  
United States, and to the stock-  
holders, at a general meeting to  
be called by the president of the  
bank, at their request. ©  
  
VII. The company may sell or  
demise its lands and tenements, or  
may sell the whole or any part of  
the public debt, whereof its stock  
  
shall consist ; but shall trade in  
nothing, except bills of exchange,  
  
gold and silver bullion, or in the

lent: nor shall take more than  
at the rate of six per centum per  
annum, upon its loans or dis-  
counts.  
  
VIII. No loan shall be made by  
the bank, for the use, or on ac-  
count of, the government of the  
United States, or of either of  
them, to an amount exceeding  
fifty thousand dollars, or of any  
foreign prince or state; unless  
previously authorized by a law of  
the United States.

shall be transferable according  
to such rules as shall be institut-  
ed by the company in that be-  
  
half.  
X. The affairs of the bank shall  
  
be under the management of  
twenty-five directors, one of whom  
shall be the president. And there  
shall be on the first Monday of  
January, in each year, a choice  
of directors, by a plurality of suf-  
frages of the stockholders, to  
serve fora year. The directors,  
at their first meeting after each  
election, shall choose one of their  
number as president.

which each stockholder shall be  
entitled, shall be according to the

not more than two shares, one  
vote: For every two shares, a-  
bove two, and not exceeding ten,

above ten, and not exceeding  
thirty, one vote: For every six  
shares, above thirty, and not ex-  
ceeding sixty, one vote : For eve-  
ry eight shares, above sixty, and  
not exceeding one hundred, one  
vote: and for every ten shares,  
above one hundred, one vote:  
But no person, co-partnership,  
or body politic, shall be entitled  
to a greater number than thirty  
votes. And after the first elec-  
tion, no share or shares shall con-  
fer a right of suffrage, which  
shall not have been holden three  
calendar months previous to the  
day of election. Stockholders,  
actually resident within the U-  
nited States, and none other, may  
vote in elections by proxy.  
  
XII. Not more than three-  
fourths of the directors in office,  
exclusive of the president, shall  
be elegible for the next succeed-  
ing year. But the director whe

an clection, may be always re-  
elected.  
  
XIII. None but a stockholder,  
being a citizen of the United  
States, shall be eligible as a di-  
rector.  
  
XIV. Any number of stock-.  
holders not less than sixty, who  
together shall be proprietors of  
two hundred shares, or upwards,

XVI. No director shall be en-  
titled to any emolument, unless  
the same shall have been allow-  
ed by the stockholders ata gene-

shall make such compensation to  
the president, for his extraordi-

act and particular statement of  
the debts which shail have re-  
mained unpaid, after the expira-  
tion of the original credit, ior a  
period of trebie the term of that  
credit, and of the surplus of pio-  
fit, if any, after deducting losses  
and dividends.

from time to time, as often as he  
may require, not exceeding once  
a week, with statements of the  
amount of the capital stock of  
the bank, and of the debts due to  
the same, of the monies deposited  
therein, of the notes in circula-  
tion, and of the cash in hand; and  
shall have a right to inspect such  
general accounts in the books of  
the bank, as shall relate to the  
said statements ; provided that this  
shall not be construed to imply  
a right of inspecting the account  
of any private individual or indi-  
viduals, with the bank.  
  
XXII. No similar institution  
shall be established by any future  
act of the United States, during

shall think fit, within the United  
States, for the purposes of dis-  
count and deposit only, and upon  
the same terms, and in the same  
manner, as shall be practised at  
the bank, and to commit the ma-  
nagement of the said offices, and  
the making of the said discounts,  
either to agents specially appoint-  
ed by them, or to such persons as  
ivay be chosen by the stockhol-  
ders residing at the place where  
any such office shail be, under  
such agreements, and subject to  
such regulations as they. shall

be authorised to cause a subscrip-  
tion to be made to the stock of  
the said company, on behalf of  
the United States, to an amount  
not exceeding two millions of  
dollars, to be paid out of the mo-  
nies which shall be borrowed by  
virtue of either of the acts, the  
one entitled, “* An act making  
provision for the debt of the Uni-  
ted States,” and the other enti-  
tled, “ An act making provision  
for the reduction of the public  
debt,” borrowing of the bank an  
equal sum, to be applied to the  
purposes for which the said mo-  
nics shall have been procured,  
reimburseable in ten years by  
equal annual instalments; or at  
any time sooner, or in any great-  
er proportions, that the govern-  
ment may think fit.  
  
The reasons for the several  
provisions contained in the fore-  
going plan, have been so far an-  
ticipated, and will, for the most  
part be so readily suggested by  
the nature of those provisions, that  
any comments which need fur-  
ther be made, will be both few  
and concise.  
  
The combination of a portion  
of the public debt, in the forma-  
tion of the capital, is the princi-  
pal thing of which an explanation  
is requisite. The chief object of  
this is, to enable the creation of  
a capital sufficiently large to be  
the basis of an extensive circula-  
tion, and anadequate security for  
it. As has been elsewhere re-  
marked, the original plan of the  
bank of North America, contem-  
plated a capital of ten millions of  
dollais, which is certainly not too  
broad a foundation for the exten-  
‘sive operations to which a nation-  
al bank is destined. But to col-  
lect such a sum in this country  
in gold and silver, into one de-  
  
pository, may, without hesitation,  
be pronounced in.practicable.—  
Hence the necessity of an auxil-  
iary, which the public debt at  
once presents.  
  
This part of the fund will be  
always ready to come in aid of  
the specie. It will more and more  
command a ready sale; and can  
therefore expeditiously be turned  
into coin, if an exigency of the  
bank should at any time require  
it. This quality of prompt con-  
vertibility into coin, renders it an  
equivalent for that necessary a-  
gent of bank circulation ; and dis-  
tinguishes it from a fund in Jand,  
of which the sale would generally  
be far less compendious, and at  
great disadvantage. The quarter-  
yearly receipts of interest, will also  
be an actual addition to the spe-  
cie fund, during the intervals “  
tween them and the half yearly  
dividends of profits. The objec-  
tion to combining land with spe-  
cie, resulting from their not be-  
ing generally in possession of the  
same persons, does not apply to  
the debt, which will always be  
found in considerable quantity a-  
mong the monied and trading  
  
ple.  
  
The debt composing part of the  
capital, besides its collateral effect  
in enabling the bank to extend its  
operations, and consequently to  
enlarge its profits, will produce a  
direct annual revenue of six per  
centum from the government,  
which will enter into the half  
yearly dividends received by the  
stockholders.  
  
When the present price of the  
public debt is considered, and the

be discovered, that the operation  
presents ju its outset a very con-  
siderable advantage to those who  
may beco*e subscribers; and  
from the influence which that rise  
would have on the general mass  
of the debt, a proportional bene-  
fit to all the public creditors, and  
in a sense which has been more  
than once adverted to, to the com-  
munity at large.  
  
There is an important fact,  
which exemplifies tie fitness of  
the public debt, for a bank fund,  
and which may serve to remove  
doubts in some minds on this  
point. It is this, that the bank of  
England, in its first erection, rest-  
ed wholly on that foundation. The  
subscribers to a loan to govern-  
ment of one million two hundred  
thousand pounds sterling, were  
incorporated as a bank ; of which  
the debt created by the loan and  
the interest upon it, were the sole  
fund. The subsequent augmen-  
tations of its capital, which now  
amounts to between eleven and  
twelve millions of pounds ster-  
ling, have been of the same na-  
ture.  
  
The confining of the right of  
the bank to contract debts to the  
amount of its capital, is an im-  
portant precaution, which is not  
to be found in the constitution of  
the bank of North A. erica, and  
which, while the fund consists  
wholly of coin, would be a restric-  
tion attended with inconvenien-  
cies, but would be free from any,  
if the composition of it should be  
such as is now proposed. The  
restriction exists in the establish-  
ment of the bank of Englund,  
and as a source of security, is  
worthy of imitation. ‘The conse-  
quence of exceeding the limit  
there is, that each stockholder is  
  
liable for the excess, in propor-  
tion to his interest in the bank.  
When it is considered, that the  
directors owe their appointments  
to the choice of the stockholders,  
a responsibility of this kind on the  
part of the latter, does not appear  
unreasonable. But on the other  
hand it may be deemed a hard-  
ship upon those who may have  
dissented from the choice. And  
there are many among us, whom  
it might perhaps discourage from  
becoming concerned in the insti-  
tution. These reasons have in-  
duced the placing of the respon-  
sibility upon the directors, by  
whom the limit prescribed should  
be transgressed.  
  
The interdiction of loans on  
account of the United States, or  
of any particular state, beyond  
the moderate sum specified, or of  
any foreign power, will serve as  
a barrier to executive encroach-  
ments, and to combinations in-  
auspicious to the safety, or con-  
trary to the policy of the union.

ave  
analyzed the subject‘in all its re-  
lations, to be able to form a just  
conception of the extent of that  
effect. Such an analysis cannot  
but satisfy an intelligent mind,  
that the difference of one per  
cent. in the rate at which money  
may be had, is often capable of  
making an essential change for  
the better, in the situation of any  
country or place.  
  
Every thing, therefore, which  
tends toe lower the rate of inter-  
est, is peculiirly worthy of the  
cares of jegislators. And though  
laws, which violently sink the le-  
gal rate of interest greatly below  
the market level, are not to be  
commended, because they are not  
calculated to answer their aim ;  
yet, whatever has a tendency to  
effect a reduction, without vio-  
lence to the netural course of  
things, ought to be attended to  
and pursued. Banks are among  
the means most proper to accom-  
plish this end; and the modera-  
tion of the rate at which their  
discounts are made, is a material  
ingredient towards it; with which  
their own interest, viewed on an  
enlarged and permanent scale,  
does not appear to clash.  
  
But as the most obvious ideas  
are apt to have greater force than  
those which depend on complex  
and remote combinations, there  
would be danger, that the per-  
sons, whose funds must consti-  
tute the stock of the bank, would  
be diffident of the sufficiency of  
the profits to be expected, if the  
rate of loans and discounts were  
to be placed below the point to  
which they have been accustom-  
ed; and might, on this account,  
be indisposed to embarking in the

plan. There is, it is true, one re-  
flection, which, in regard to men  
actually engaged ir. trade, ought  
to be a security against this dan-  
ger; it is this, That the accom-  
modations which they might de-  
rive in the way of their business,  
at a low rate, would more than  
indemnify them for any difference  
in the dividend; supposing even  
that some diminution of it were  
to be the consequence. But upon  
the whole, the hazard of contrary  
reasoning among the mass of mo-  
nied men, is a powerful argument  
against the experiment. The in-  
stitutions of the kind already ex-  
isting, add to the difficulty of ma-  
king it. Mature reflection, anda  
large capital, » ay, of themselves,  
lead to the desired end.  
  
The last thing which requires  
any explanatory remark, is, the  
authority proposed to be given to.  
the president to subscribe to the  
amount of two millions of dollars,  
on account of the public. The  
main design of this is, to enlarge  
the specie fund of the bank, and  
to enable it to give a more early  
extension to its operations. Tho’  
it is proposed to borrow with one  
hand what is lent with the other;  
yet the disbursement of what is  
borrowed, will be progressive,  
and bank notes may be thrown  
into circulation, instead of the  
gold and silver. Besides, there  
is to be an annual reimbursement  
of a part of the sum borrowed,  
which will finally operate as an  
actual investment of so much spe-  
cie. In addition to the induce-  
ments to this measure, which re-  
sult from the general interest of  
the government to enlarge the  
sphere of the utility of the bank,  
there is this more particular con-  
sideration ; to wit, that as far as

This is the necessary result of two circumstances. The su-  
perior convenience of paper for the purposes of circulation,  
and the usefulness of coin, in its character of an exportable  
commodity.  
  
As this position is of importance, and has been contested,  
we must dwell on it fora moment.  
  
The first secretary of the American treasury was of opinion,  
that banks had no tendency to prevent the increase of the pre-  
cious metals, or to banish them, in some degree, from the  
country. *“ A nation,” he remarks, “ that has no mines of its  
own, must derive the precious metals from others; generally  
speaking, in exchange for the products of its labour, and in-  
dustry. The quantity it will possess, will therefore, in the or-  
dinary course of things, be regulated by the favourable, or  
unfavourable balance of its trade; that is, by the proportion  
between its abilities to supply foreigners, and its want of  
them; between the amount of its exportations, and that of its  
importations. Hence, the state of its agriculture and manufac-  
tures, the quantity and quality of its labour and industry, must,  
in the main, influence and determine the increase, or decrease  
of its gold and silver.  
  
“If this be true, the inference seems to be, that well con-  
stituted banks favour the increase of the precious metals. It  
has been shown, that they augment in different ways, the ac-  
tive capital of a country. That it is which generates employ-  
ment; which animates, and expands, labour and industry.  
Every addition, which is made to it, by contributing to put in  
motion a greater quantity of both, tends to create a greater

from which, it is presumed the idea of  
making the funded debt a part of the

drawn. The Bank of England, when  
first erected, rested wholly on the foun­

scribers to a loan to the government of  
England, of one million two hundred  
thousand pounds sterling, were incorpo- ,  
rated as a Bank, and the debt created by  
the loan and the interest upon it, were  
the sole fund upon which it was esta­  
blished. The subsequent augmentations  
of its capital, amounting, with the ori­  
ginal sum to between eleven and twelve  
millions of pounds sterling and now  
constituting its capital, have been of tha •

cies, there is almost a moral certainty of its becoming mischie-  
vous. The stamping of paper is an operation so much easier  
than the laying of taxes, that a government im the practice of  
paper emissions would rarely fail, in any such emergency, to  
indulge itself too far in the employment of that resource, to  
avoid, as much as possible, one less auspicious to present po-  
pularity.”’—( Report on the National Bank.)

inr tho attention of the House to them. &quot; Con­  
siderations of public advantage suggest a wish  
that the Bank could be established upon princi­  
ples which would cause the profits of it to re­  
dound to tho immediate benclit of the State.  
This is contemplated by many who speak of a  
National Bank, but the idea seems liable to in­  
superable objections. To attach full confidence  
to an Institution of this nature, it appears to be  
an essential ingredient in its structure, that it  
shall be under a private not a public direction,  
under the guidance ot individual interest, not of  
public policy, which would bo supposed to be,  
and in certain instances under a feeble or too  
sanguine administration would really be, liable  
to bein? too much influeced by public neces­  
sity. The suspicion of this would most proba­  
bly be a canker that would continuidly corrode  
the vitals of the endit of the Buik, and would  
be most likely to prove fatal in those situations  
in which the Public good would requirer that it  
should be tho most sound and vigorous. It  
would indeed be little less than a miracle, should  
the credit of the Bank be at the disposal of the  
Government, if in a long series of time there  
was not exnei iencod a calamitous abuse of it.  
It is true, that it would bo the true interest of  
tho Government not to abuse it, its genuine po­  
licy to husband and cherish it with the most  
guarded circumspection as an inestimable trea­  
sure. But what government ever uniformly  
consulted it true interests, in opposition to the  
temptation of momentary exigences ? What na­  
tion was ever blessed with a constant succession  
of upright and wise administrations?  
44 The keen, steady, and as it were magnetic  
sense of their own interest as proprietors in the  
Directors of a Bank, pointing invariably to its  
  
true pole, tho prosperity of the Institution, is  
the only security that can always &#x27; be relied  
upon for a careful and prudent administration.  
It is therefore the duly basis on which an en­  
lightened, unqualified und permanent confidence  
can be expected to be erected or maintained.

General Hainilton said: «The emitting of paper  
money by the anthority of government is wisely  
prohibited to the individual states by the national  
constitution, and the spirit of that pronibiton onght  
not to be disregarded by the government of the  
United States. Though paper einission, under a  
general authority, might have some advantages not  
applicable, and be free from some disadvantages  
which are applicable to the like ernissions by the  
states separately, yet they are of a nature so liable  
to abuse, and, it may even be affirmed, so certain of  
being abused, that the wisdom of government  
will be shown in never trusting itself with the nse  
of so seducing and dangerous an expedient.” ‘The  
stamping of paper is an operation so much easier  
than the laying of taxes, that a government in the  
practice of paper emissions would rarely fail, in any  
such emergency, to indulge itself too far in the em-  
ploymert of that recourse, to avoid, as much as  
possible, one less auspicious lo present popularity.”  
  
General Jackson said: ‘*I hope no treasury notes  
will beissued. The treasury drafts upon aclual de-  
posites are constitutional, ane do nof partake of pa-

‘If the paper of a bank is permitted to insinuate itself into all the revenues and re-

the principal methods by which:so great a loss was occasioned.  
  
1. The Cotton Speculations. By the fifth section of the  
Act chartering the Bank of the United States under its State  
organization, it was provided,  
  
“The said corporation shall not, directly or indirectly, deal  
or trade in anything except bills of exchange, gold and silver  
bullion, or in the sale of goods really and truly pledged, for  
money lent and not redeemed in due time, or goods which

 or in gold and silver, as it  
may be required. But, generally, no actual payment is made  
in either; the borrower having, by his check or order, trans-  
ferred his credit to another person, who, in his turn, may do  
the same, and thus continue the amount still in the hands of  
the bank, without there having been a dollar removed from  
its first repository; where the sum still remains, until it is  
removed or extinguished by a discount to some person who  
may wish to send it away by draft, or who owes the bank to  
an equal or larger amount. Thirdly.—There is always a  
large amount of gold and silver in the vaults of the bank,  
exclusive of its own stock, which has been placed there by  
persons who are awaiting an opportunity to use it, either in  
their own business, or some other in which they can make a  
profit. These deposits are a great benefit to the operations  
of a bank, although they are liable to be redrawn at a mo-  
ment’s notice ; because, experience has shown that, money  
much oftener changes owners than place, and that what is  
drawn out is generally so speedily replaced, as to authorize  
the counting of such deposits as an efficient fund, to be used  
in connection with the capital of the bank, to extend its  
loans far beyond its capital in gold and silver; and to an-  
swer all demands for coin, whether drawn out in consequence  
of its own loans, or from the occasional return of its notes.  
But all these advantages must rest entirely on the confidence  
which the community entertains in the resources and good  
management of the bank.

a distinction between the emission of bills by the  
Government and the creation of a bank with

&quot;The establishment of banks in the  
country seems to be recommended by  
reasons of a peculiar nature. I&#x27;reviously  
to the Revolution, circulation was in a  
great measure carried on by paper emit­  
ted by the several Iocr.l governments. In  
Pennsylvania alone, the quantity of it  
was near a million and a half dollars.  
This auxiliary may be said to be now at  
an end. And it is generally supposed  
that there has been for some time past  
a deficiency of circulating medium. How  
far that deficiency is to be considered as  
real or imaginary, is not susceptible of  
demonstration ; but there are circumstan­  
ces and appearances, which in relation to  
the country at large, countenance the  
supposition of its reality.  
&quot; If tho supposition of such a deficien­  
cy be in any degree founded, and some  
aid to circulation be desirable, it remains  
to inquire what ought to be the nature  
of that aid.  
t &quot; The emitting of paper money by  
the authority of the Govcrumeut it wide  
a  
  
ly prohibited to the individual States by  
the National Constitution; and the spirit  
of that prohibition ought not to tm disre­  
garded by the Government f the United  
States. Though paper emissious, under  
a general authority, might have some ad­  
vantages not applicable, and be free from  
some disadvantages which are applicable  
to the like emissions by the States, seper­  
ately, yet they are of a nature so liable  
to abuse and it may even be affirmed,  
so certain of bein&quot; abused that the wis  
dom of the Government will be shown in  
never trusting itself .with the use pf so  
seducing and dangerous an expedient.  
In times of tranquility it might have no  
ill consequence ; it might even, perhaps,  
be managed in a way to be productive of  
good ; but in great and trying emergen  
cies there is almost a moral certainty of  
its becoming mischievous.. The stamp  
ing of paper is an operation so much  
easier than the laying of taxes, that a  
government in the practice of paper em  
issions would rarely fail, in any such  
emergency, to indulge itself too far in  
the employment of that resource, to  
.avoid, as much as possible, one less aus­  
picious to present popularity. If it should  
not even be carried so far as to be ten  
dered an absolute bubble, it would at  
least be likely to be extended to a degree  
which would occasion an inflated and ar  
tificial state of things, incompatible with  
the regular and prosperous course of the  
political economy.&quot;

Mr. Hamitton commences by stating that, from a conviction that a  
national bank is an object of primary importance to the prosperous ad-  
ministration of the finances, and would be of the greatest utility in the  
operations connected with the support of the public credit, his attention  
has been drawn to devising the plan of such an institution upon a scale  
which will entitle it to the confidence, and be likely to render it equal to  
the exigencies, of the public.

North America* contemplated a capital of ten millions of dollars, which is certainly  
not too broad a foundation for the extensive operations to which a national bank is  
destined. But to collect such a eum in this country, in gold and silver, into one  
depository, may, without hesitation, be pronounced impracticable. Hence the ne-  
cessity of an auxiliary, which the public debt at once presents,”  
  
At that time the Bank of North America, at Philadelphia, was the  
only moneyed institution established under authority of Congress.

emergencies, there is almost a moral certainty of its becoming mischiev-  
ous. The stamping of paper is an operation so much easier than the  
laying of taxes, that a Government in the practice of paper emissions  
would rarely fail, in every such emergency, to indulge itself too far in  
the employment of that resource, to avoid, as much as possible, one less  
auspicious to present popularity. Jf it should not be carried so fur as  
to be rendered an absolute bubblz, it would at least be likely to be extended  
to a degree which would occasion an inflated and artificial state of things,  
incompatible with the regulur and prosperous course of the political economy.  
Among other material differences between a paper currency, issued by  
the mere authority of Government, and one issued by a bank, payable  
in coin, is this: that in the first case, there is no standard to which an  
appeal can be made as to the quantity which will only justify, or which  
will surcharge the circulation; in the last, that standard results from the  
demand, If more should be issued than is necessary, it will return upon  
the bank. Its emissions, as elsewhere intimated, must always be in a com-  
pound ratio to the fund and the demand, whence it is evident that there  
is a limitation in the nature of the thing; while the discretion of the  
Government is the only measure of the extent of emissions by its own  
authority.”

Alexander Hamilton, in a report to  
Congress as First Secretary of the United  
States Treasury, said of paper money  
emissions by the Government  
The emitting of paper money by the  
authority of the Government, is wisely  
prohibited to the individual States by the  
National Constitution, and the spirit of  
that prohibition ought not to be disre­  
garded by the Government of the United  
States. Though paper emissions under  
the general authority might have some ad­  
vantages not applicable, and be free  
from disadvantages which are applicable  
to like emissions by the States sept rately  
yet they are of a nature so liable to  
  
abuse, and it may even be affirmed, so  
certain of being abused that the wisdom  
of the Government will be shown in never  
trusting itself with the use of so seducing

The debates in the Federal Convention  
that framed, and in the State Conventiom.­  
that adopted the Constitution, are equally  
explicit as to the importance of the sub­  
ect and the sentiments of the members of  
the Conventions. The proposition to  
authorize Congress to emit bills of  
credit,&quot; was rejected in the Federal Cone  
vention. During the debate upon it, Mr.  
Ellsworth said:  
&quot;It is a favorable moment to shut and

**The emitting of paper money by the  
authority of the Government is wisely pro-  
hibited to the individual states by the Na-  
tional Constitution, and the spirit of that  
prohibition ought pot to be disregarded by  
the Government of the United States.  
Though paper emissions, under a geveral  
authority, might bave some advantages not  
applicabie and be free from some disad-  
vantages which are applicable to the like  
emissions by the states separately, yct they  
are of a vature s0 liable to abuse, and it  
may even be affirmed so certain to be  
abused, that the wisdom of the Govern-  
ment will be shown iv never trusting itself  
with the use of so seducing and dangerous  
an expedient. In times of tranquillity it  
might have no ill consequence; it might  
even, perhups, be managed in a way to be  
productive of good; but in great and trying  
emergencies there is almost a moral cer-  
tainty of its becoming mischievous, The  
stampiog of paper is ap operation so much  
easier than the laying of taxes that a Gov-  
ernment, in the practice of paper emissions,  
would rarely fail in any such emergency to  
indulge itself too far iu the employment of  
that resource to avoid, as much as possible,  
one less suspicious to present popularity.  
If it should not even be carried xo far as to  
be rendered an absolute bubble, it would,  
at least, be likely to be extended to a degree  
which would occasion an inflated and arti-  
ficial state of things, incompatible with the  
regular and prosperous course of the political  
economy. Among other material differences  
between a p»per currency issued by the mere  
autbority of Government and one issued  
by a bank, payable in coin, is this: that, in  
the first case, there is no standard to which  
an appeal cxn be made as tothe quantity  
which will only satisfy or which will sur-  
charge the circulation. In the last, that  
standard results from the demand. If  
more should be issued than is necessary, it  
will return upon the bank. Its emissions,  
as eleewhere intimated, must always be in  
a compound ratio to the fund and the de-  
mand, whence tt is evident thet there is a  
limitation in the nature of the thing, while  
the discretion of the Government is the  
only measure of the extent of the emis-  
sions by its own authority.”  
  
The thing recommended by Mr. Hamil-  
ton was the establishment of a national  
bank, invested with the right of issuing its  
own notes, redeemable in coin. That which  
he did not recommend, but strongly op-  
posed, is the issue of paper money by the  
direct authority of the Government. W

Every loan which a bank makes is, in its first shape, a credit given  
to the borrower in its books, the amount of which it stands ready to  
pay, either in its own notes or in gold or silver, at his option. But,  
in a great number of cases, no actual payment is made in either.  
The borrower frequently, by a check or order, transfers his credit to’  
some other person, to whom he has a payment to make; who, in his  
turn, is as often content with a similar credit, because he is satisfied  
that he can, whenever he pleases, either convert it into cash or pass  
it to some other hand, as an equivalent for it. And in this manner  
the credit keeps circulating, performing, in every stage, the office of  
money, till it is extinguished by a discount with some person who  
has a payment to make to the bank to an equal or greater amount.*

ers throughout the United States urged this  
upon the Secretary of the Treasury as the only  
practicable expedient. The leading statesmen  
in both houses of Congress were brought with  
extreme reluctance to the same conclusion. To  
no one was this decision more painful than to  
the Secretary of the Treasury. He agreed with  
the greatest of his predecessors, in that famous  
report which has become a classic in our poli-

The emitting of paper money by the authority of  
the Government is wisely prohibited to the individ-

rohibition ought not to bé disregarded by the Govy-

itself with the use of so seducing and dangerous an  
expedient. . . . The stamping of paper is an op-  
eration so much easier than the laying of taxes, that  
a government in the practice of paper emissions  
would rarely failin any such emergency to indulge  
itself too far in that resource to avoid as much as

to be extended to a degree which would occasion  
an inflated and artificial state of things incompati-  
ble with the regular and prosperous course of the  
political economy.  
  
But in spite of all this reluctance Mr. Chase  
felt that an emergency was upon the Govern-  
ment from which this was the only issue. He  
saw that the corporate institutions of the country  
would not receive the notes of the Government  
unless they were made a legal tender by act of  
Congress.

reads like an extract from a modern author, except, indeed, that  
in clearness and grace of exposition the palm must be yielded to  
Hamilton. ?  
  
Every loan which a bank makes is, in its first shape, a credit given to the  
borrower on its books, the amount of which it stands ready to pay, either in  
its own notes, or in gold or silver, at his option, But, in a great number of  
cases, no actual payment is made in either. The borrower, frequently, by a  
check or order, transfers his credit to some other person, to whom he has a  
payment to make, who, in his turn, is as often content with a similar credit,  
because he is satisfied that he can, whenever he pleases, either convert it into  
cash, or pass it to some other hand, as an equivalent for it. And in this man-  
ner the credit keeps circulating, performing in every stage the office of money,  
till it is extinguished by a discount with some person who has a payment to  
make to the bank, to an equal or greater amount. Thus large sums are lent  
and paid, frequently through a variety of hands, without the intervention of a  
single piece of coin.

‘The emitting of paper money by the authority of Government is wisely pro-  
hibited to the individual States by the national Constitution, and the spirit of that  
prohibition ought not to be disregarded by the Government of the United States.  
  
Though paper emissions, under a general authority, might have some advan.  
tages not applicable, and be free from some disadvantages which are applicable to  
the like emissions by the States, separately, yet they are of a nature so liable to  
abuse—and, it may even be affirmed, so certain of being abused—that the wisdom  
of the Government will be shown in never trusting itself with the use of so seduc-  
ing and dangerous an experiment. In times of tranquillity it might have no ill con-  
sequence ; it might even, perhaps, be managed in a way to be productive of good;  
but in great and trying emergencies there is almost a moral certainty of its becom-  
ing mischievous.  
  
The stamping of paper is an operation so much easier than the laying of taxes  
that a Government in the practice of paper emissions would rarely fail, in any such  
emergency, to indulge itself too far in the employment of that resource, to avoid as.  
much as possible one less auspicious to present popularity. If it should not even  
be carried so far as to be rendered an absvulute bubble, it would at least be likely to.  
be extended to a degree which would occasion an inflated and artificial state of  
things, incompatible with the regular and prosperous course of the political  
economy.  
  
Among other material differences between a paper currency, issued by the mere  
authority of Government, and one issued by a bank, payable in coin, is this: That,  
in the first case, there is no standard to which an appeal can be made, as to the  
quantity which will only satisfy, or which will surcharge the circulation; in the  
last, that standard results from the demand. If more should be issued than is nec-  
essary, it will return upon the bank. Its emissions, as elsewhere intimated, must  
always be in a compound ratio to the fund and the demand; whence it is evident  
that there is a limitation in the nature of the thing ; while the discretion of the  
Government is the only measure of the extent of the emissions by its own author-  
ity. This consideration further illustrates the danger of emissions of that sort, and  
the preference which is due to bank paper.

Gold and silver, when they are employed merely as the instruments of exchange  
and alienation, have been, not improperly, denominated dead stock ; but when de-  
posited in banks, to become the basis of a paper circulation, which takes their char-

* * * Credit of every kind (as a species of which only can bank lending have  
the effect supposed) must be, in different degrees, chargeable with the same incon:  
venience. It is even applicable to gold and silver, when they abound in circulation.  
But would it be wise, on this account, to decry the precious metals, to root out  
credit, or to proscribe the means of that enterprise which is the mainspring of trade,  
and a principal source of national wealth, because it now and then runs into excesses,  
of which overtrading is one ?  
  
If the abuses of a beneficial thing are to determine its condemnation, there is  
scarcely a source of public prosperity which will not speedily be closed. In every  
case the evil is to be compared with the good ; and in the present case, such a com-  
parison will issue in this, that the new and increased energies derived from commer-  
cial enterprise, from the aid of banks, are a source of general profit and advantage,  
which greatly outweigh the partial ills, the overtrading of a few individuals at par-  
ticular times, or of numbers in particular conjunctures.

The positive and permanent increase or decrease of the precious metals in a coun-  
try can hardly ever be a matter of indifference. As the commodity taken in lieu of  
every other, it is a species of the most effective wealth ; and as the money of the  
world, itis of great concern to the State that it possesses a sufficiency of it to face  
any demands which the protection of its external interests may create.
