I arrived safe at this Place on the 3d Instt, after a Journey attended with a good deal of Fatigue, &amp; retarded by necessary Attentions to the successive Civilities which accompanied me in my whole Rout—Upon my Arrival, I immediately visited the several Posts occupied by our Troops, &amp; as soon as the Weather permitted, reconnoitred those of the Enemy.

 the utmost Duty &amp; Respect.  
We labour under great Disadvantages for Want of Tents, for tho. they have been help’d out by a Collection of now useless Sails from the Sea Port Towns, the Number is far short of our Necessities. The Colleges &amp; Houses of this Town are necessarily occupied by the Troops which affords another Reason for keeping our present Situation: But I most sincerely wish the whole Army was properly provided to take the Field, as I am well assured, that besides greater Expedition &amp; Activity in Case of Alarm it would highly conduce to Health &amp; Discipline. As Materials are not to be had here I would beg Leave to recommend the procuring a farther Supply from Philadelphia as soon as possible.  
  
I should be extremely deficient in Gratitude, as well as Justice, if I did not take the first Oppy to acknowledge the Readiness &amp; Attention which the provincial Congress &amp; different Committees have shewn to make every Thing as convenient &amp; agreeable as possible: but there is a vital &amp; inherent Principle of Delay incompatible with military Service in transacting Business thro. such numerous &amp; different Channels. I esteem it therefore my Duty to represent the Inconvenience which must unavoidably ensue from a Dependance on a Number of Persons for Supplies, &amp; submit it to the Consideration of the Congress whether the publick Service will not be best promoted by appointing a Commissary General for these Purposes—We have a striking Instance of the Preference of such a Mode in the Establishment of Connecticut, as their Troops are extremely well provided under the Direction of Mr  Trumbull &amp; he has at different Times assisted others with various Articles—Should my Sentimts happily coincide with those of your Honours in this Subject, I beg Leave to recommend Mr Trumbull as a very proper Person for this Department. In the Arrangement of Troops collected under such Circumstances, &amp; upon the Spur of immediate Necessity several Appointments are omitted, which appear to be indispensably necessary for the good Government of the Army, &amp; particularly a Quartermaster General, A Commissary of Musters &amp; a Commissary of Artillery. These I must earnestly recommend to the Notice &amp; Provision of the Congress.  
I find myself already much embarassed for Want of a military Chest—these Embarassments will increase every Day: I must therefore request that Money may be forwarded as soon as possible. The Want of this most necessary Article, will I fear produce great Inconveniencies if not prevented by an early Attention. I find the Army in general, &amp; the Troops raised in Massachusetts in particular, very deficient in necessary Cloathing. Upon Inquiry there appears no Probability of obtaining any Supplies in this Quarter. And on the best Consideration of this Matter I am able to form, I am of Opinion that a Number of hunting Shirts not less than 10,000 would in a great Degree remove this Difficulty in the cheapest &amp; quickest Manner. I know nothing in a speculative View more trivial, yet if put in Practice would have a happier Tendency to unite the Men, &amp;  
  
abolish those Provincial Distinctions which lead to Jealousy &amp; Dissatisfaction. In a former Part of this Letter I mentioned the Want of Engineers; I can hardly express the Disappointment I have experienced on this Subject: The Skill of those we have, being very imperfect &amp; confined to the mere manual Exercise of Cannon. Whereas—the War in which we are engaged requires a Knowledge comprehending the Duties of the Field and Fortification: If any Persons thus qualified are to be found in the Southern Colonies, it would be of great publick Service to forward them with all Expedition—Upon the Article of Ammunition I must re-echo the former Complaints on this Subject: We are so exceedingly destitute, that our Artillery will be of little Use without a Supply both large &amp; seasonable: What we have must be reserved for the small Arms, &amp; that managed with the utmost Frugality.  
I am sorry to observe that the Appointments of the General Officers in the Province of Massachusetts Bay—have by no Means corresponded with the Judgment &amp; Wishes of either the civil or Military. The great Dissatisfaction expressed on this Subject &amp; the apparent Danger of throwing the Army into the utmost Disorder, together with the strong Represen⟨ta⟩tions of the Provincial Congress, have induced me to retain the Commissions in my Hands untill the Pleasure of the Congress should be farther known (except General Puttnams which was given the Day I came into Camp &amp; before I was apprized of these Uneasinesses). In such a Step I must beg the Congress will do me the Justice I believe, that I have been actuated solely by a Regard to the publick Good: I have not, nor could have any private Attachments; every Gentleman in Appointment, was an entire Stranger to me but from Character. I must therefore rely upon the Candour of the Congress for their favourable Construction of my Conduct in this Particular. General Spencer was so much disgusted at the Preference given to Gen. Puttnam, that he left the Army without visiting me, or making known his Intentions in any Respect. General Pomroy had also retired before my Arrival occasioned (as is said) by some Disappointment from the Provincial Congress.

Upon finding the Number of Men to fall so far short of the Establishment, &amp; below all Expectation I immediately called a Council of the general Officers whose Opinion as to the Mode of filling up the Regiments; &amp; providing for the present Exigency, I have the Honour of inclosing, together with the best Judgment we are able to form of the ministerial Troops. From the Number of Boys, Deserters, &amp; Negroes which have been listed in the Troops of this Province, I entertain some Doubts whether the Number required can be raised here; and all the General Officers agree that no Dependance can be put on the Militia for a Continuance in Camp, or Regularity and Discipline during the short Time they may stay. This unhappy &amp; devoted Province has been so long in a State of Anarchy, &amp; the Yoke of ministerial Oppression has been laid so heavily on it that great Allowances are to be made for Troops raised under such Circumstances. The Deficiency of Numbers, Discipline &amp; Stores can only lead to this Conclusion, that their Spirit has exceeded their Strength.

‘* Upon finding the number of men  
to fall so far short of the establishment,  
and below all expectation, I immediately  
ealled a council of the general officers,  
whose opinion as to the mode of filling  
up the regiments and providing for the  
present exigency I have the honor of  
inclosing, together with the best judg-  
ment we are able to form of the ministe-  
rial troops. From the number of boys,  
deserters, and negroes that have been en-  
listed in the troops of this province, I en-  
tertain some doubts whether the num-  
ber required can be raised here; and all  
the general officers agree that no de-  
pendence can be put on the militia for a  
continuance in camp, or regularity and  
discipline during the short time they may  
stay. The deficiency of numbers,  
discipline, and stores can only lead to  
this conclusion, that their spirit has ex-  
ceeded their strength. It requires  
no military skill to judge of the diffi-  
culty of introducing proper discipline  
and subordination into an army while  
we have the enemy in view, and are in  
daily expectation of an attack; but it is of  
so much importance that every effort will  
be made to this end which time and cir-  
cumstances will admit. In the mean time  
I have a sincere pleasure in observing  
that there are materials for a good army,  
a great number of able-bodied men, act-  
ive, zealous in the cause, and of unques-  
tionable courage.” The infusion of order  
and discipline! into this mob of men,

‘We labour under great Disadvantages for Want  
of Tents, for tho’ they have been help’d out by a Col-  
lection of now useless sails from the Sea Port Towns,  
the number is yet far shortof our Necessities. Thé  
Colleges &amp; Housesof this iown are uecessarily oc-  
cupied by the Troops which atfords another Reason  
for keeping our present Situation: But | most sin-

would highly conduce to Health and Discipline. As

“T should be extremely deficient in Gratitude, as

knowledge the Readiness &amp; Attention which the  
provincial Congress &amp; different Committees have  
shewn to make every Thing as convenient &amp; agreo-  
able as possible: but there is a vital &amp; inherent  
Principle of Delay incompatible with military serv-  
ice in transacting Business thro’ sdch numerous &amp;

Money may forwarded as soon a&amp; Possible. The

duce great Inconvenicacies if not prevented by an

@ speculative view more trivi yet if put in  
Practice would have a happier dency to unite

which lead to Jealousy &amp; Dissatisfaction.

not, nor could have any private Attachments; every
