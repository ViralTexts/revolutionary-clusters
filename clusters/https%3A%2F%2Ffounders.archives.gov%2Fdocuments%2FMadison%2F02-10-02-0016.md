Sir  
On board the U States Frigate ConstitutionSyracuse Harbour July 5th. 1805  
  
Since I had the honor of addressing You under date of the 3d. of November, I have thought it my duty to remain in the Vicinity of Tripoli, that I might be at hand for entering into a negociation with the Bashaw; whenever he Shd. give evidence of his disposition to do so on proper terms; and I accordingly took up my residence in Malta; being well assured that nothing would occur to make my presence necessary: at Algiers during the Winter, and knowing that the Dey was perfectly satisfied as to the cause of my extended absence from his dominions.  
On the 28th. of Decr. I received a letter from Don Gerardo Joseph De Souza, the Spanish Consul at Tripoli, stating, that on the 17th. of Decr. he had a private audience with the Bashaw of Tripoli on the business of his Nation, which being over, the Bashaw introduced the Subject of this War with the U.States, and expressed his willingness to conclude it, if the Americans were disposed to come forward on proper grounds. The Sp. Consul answered that he presumed they would have no objections to finish the war upon honorable terms. There, he says, the Subject was droped; and he took the liberty of making this communication to me, having heard that I was in Malta; adding, as his own opinion, that if I would come over to Tripoli, in a Flag of Truce, he had no doubt but a peace might soon be concluded on honorable &amp; satisfactory terms. As I had reason to believe that this communication was made to me with the knowledge; if not the express desire of the Bashaw, I felt in no haste to reply to it, as I was persuaded that, if he then discovered a desire to terminate the business, he would be more anxious to do so when the Season for active operations Shd. approach. On the 28th of March Commodore Barron sent a Small Vessel to Tripoli with Cloathing &amp;c. for our Captive Countrymen, and by that occasion, I acknowledged the receipt of the Sp: Consul’s letter; and observed to him that as we had last year made several overtures to the Bashaw for peace, which had been rejected, he might be assured that we Should never make the first advance again on that Subject. But that, notwithstanding our Force in this Sea was very considerable, and would, at the proper Season, act with decided vigour; Yet we Shd. be ready to receive and consider any propositions which might come from the Bashaw before that Season arrived; provided such propositions were compatable with the dignity and rising character of our Nation, and tending to an honorable and permanent peace.  
On the 21st. of Apl. I received by the return of the same Vessel from Tripoli, another letter from the Sp: Consul, saying that he had communicated to the Bashaw the contents of my letter of the 28th. of March, who had directed him to inform me, that to shew his disposition to end the War he would make a proposition Viz. That the U.S should pay him 200,000 for peace &amp; ransom and deliver up to him, gratis, all his subjects in their power, and make full restitution of the property taken from them. The Sp: Consul added, that he considered the propositions of the Bashaw rather intended to form the basis for opening a negociation, than made with an expectation of being granted—At the Same time he mentioned the mode of communication which might be pursued, if I shd. think proper to come off Tripoli with a view to open a negociation. These propositions were so completely inadmissable that after communicating them to Commodore Barron, I thought no more of them, fully expecting further advances either through the same, or some other channel; as it evidently appeared to be the wish of the Bashaw to open a negociation.  
Between the time last mentioned, and the 18th. of May, there were intimations made, in various ways, of the disposition of the Bashaw to treat; but none in a direct or official manner. On that day Commodore Barron wrote me the letter No. 1. to which on the 19th. I returned the answer No. 2. And on the 22d, he informed me he had relinquished the command of the Squadron to Captn. Rodgers. On the 24 I embarked on bd. the U.S. Frigate Essex, Captn. James Barron to proceed to Tripoli. On the 26th. in the morng. we saw the Town of Tripoli distant about 10 miles, &amp; at the same time the U.S. Frigates Constitution &amp; President. At 10 A M. Captn. Barron &amp; myself went onboard the former when Captain Rodgers received the letter of Commodore Barron relinquishing to him the command of the Squadron &amp;c. He returned with us to the Essex, when we stood in for the Town, and within a short distance from the Battery hoisted the white flag, which was immediately answered by the same from the Bashaw’s Castle. In half an hour a boat came off with the Spanish Consul and an Officer of the Bashaw. I informed the Sp: Consul that I had, agreeably to the desire of the Bashaw to treat, come for that purpose; but that the propositions which had been made through him (the Sp: Consul) were totally out of the question, and must be relinquished before I wd. consent to move one step in the business; and that if I had not the most unequivocal evidence that they would be put a side in toto, I would not go on Shore, and told him he had better return with my determination, and come off again the next day, if the Bashaw was desireous of having peace on terms which we could admit. He left the Ship, and the Wind during the night blew so heavily on shore that the Ships were obliged to Stand off; and were not able to come in near the Town again untill the 29th. when at 9 AM the Sp: Consul came on board bringing the Tiscara or Commission of the Bashaw to treat on his part, on the principal points of accommodations. We now removed from the Essex to the Constitution. The Bashaw relinquished all pretentions to a paymt. for peace or any future demand of any nature whatever; but demanded the Sum of 130,000 dollars for the ransom of our Countrymen, and the delivery of his subjects gratis. To this I objected as Strongly as to the first propositions; and after some time spent in discussing the subject I told the Sp: Consul, that to prevent unnecessary delay &amp; altercation I would give him in writing my ultimatum which must be at once decided upon. Viz—That there Should be an exchange of Prisoners, man for man so far as they would go—that the Bashaw Should Send all the Americans now in his power on board the Squadron now off Tripoli—that his Subjects should be brought over from Syracuse, and delivered to him with all convenient speed and as he had 300 Americans more or less—and We 100 Tripolines more or less, I would engage to give him for the balance in his favour 60,000 Dollars. That a treaty of peace should be made upon honorable and mutually beneficial terms. With this he went on shore in the Evening; but apparently without any expectation of its being accepted.  
On the 30th. At 11 A.M the Sp: Consul came again on bd. the Constitution, and urged me very strongly to go on Shore, where everything, he said, Should be Satisfactorily arranged; but as I had determined not to deviate from the ground I had taken, I declined, Stating to him that it now depended on the Bashaw to terminate the business by a single word and that very little time more would be given for that purpose. He requested permission to send a letter on shore, to which he would await an answer. This was granted; and on receiving an answer to his letter he again urged my going on Shore in the Strongest terms. This I Steadily refused to do.The Wind increasing obliged the Ship to Stand off, and prevented the Sp: Consul from going on shore this night.  
At 8 AM. on the 31 of May, the Sp. Consul went on shore, promising to come off again in a few hours with the Bashaw’s answer. At noon he came off again, and said that the Bashaw had at length agreed to the sum of 60,000 dollars for the balance of the prisoners; but that he could not think of delivering up the Americans until his Subjects were ready to be delivered to him, and again urging me to go on shore. I told him, in one word, that the business had already been protracted beyond what I conceived a reasonable time; but as the weather yesterday would not admit of our Countrymen being sent on board, I would allow the Bashaw 24 hours, from this time, to agree to my propositions in toto, or reject them. He begged for further time; but without effect; and left the Ship at 5 P.M.  
At 11 A.M. June 1st. our unfortunate Countryman, Capt. Bainbridge came on board, who had been permitted to come off, under the guarantee of the Danish Consul and Sidi Mahomet Dghies, the Minister of foreign affairs. He assured me that the Americans would not be delivered up until a treaty of peace should be made with the Bashaw, as peace was more his object than the sum he might get for the Captives; and as it was our intention to conclude a treaty, it would be cruel to let our Countrymen languish in Captivity merely on the punctillio of negociating the treaty before or after their delivery; as whatever related to them was already understood. I informed him of all which had passed between the Sp. Consul and myself; and told him that as the Sp. Consul had come on board as the Commissioner of the Bashaw, with his credentials, which he had delivered to me, I considered the business as now brought nearly to a close, and that a very short time remained for the Bashaw to make up his mind. However, as I shd. make no difference in the terms of the treaty, whether it shd. be drawn up before or after the delivery of the Prisoners, I would enter into an immediate negociation for that purpose, with any proper Character whom the Bashaw might send on board duly authorized; but I would have nothing more to do with the Sp. Consul. But the Americans Should be sent on board without waiting the arrival of the Tripolines from Syracuse. Captain B. left us in the Evening and went onshore.  
In the forenoon of the 2d. of June, M. Nissen, His Danish Majesty’s Consul at Tripoli, came off to the Constitution, bringing a Commission from the Bashaw to negociate with me on the articles of the Treaty. As I had a sketch prepared I communicated it to Mr. Nissen, who observed that there were some articles more favourable to us than were to be found in any treaty which the Bashaw had with any other nation; yet he would take them on shore and submit them to the Bashaw. He did so, and returned on board again about 4 PM. saying that the Bashaw had consented to the Articles; but was very desireous of having an article expressive of our determination to withdraw our forces &amp;c. from Derne, and that we should endeavour to persuade his brother to leave his dominions. To the first I could have no objection, as it would be a natural consequence of peace; but I insisted that if his brother should leave his territory, he should have his wife and children restored to him. Mr. Nissen thought this latter clause would meet objection. However, he took it on shore.  
On the morning of the 3d of June Mr. Nissen came off again, and declared that the Bashaw would not agree to deliver the Wife and Children of his brother. I Adhered to that part of the Article, and after some little time he return’d on shore. When Mr Nissen had left the Ship, I told Commodore Rodgers, and Captn. Smith of the Vixen, who was on board, that if the Bashaw should persist in his opposition to that article, I would not suffer the business to be broken off and leave our Countrymen in Slavery; but would, at all hazards, take a boat and go on shore, if the white flag should be haul’d down, which Mr. N. said would be the signal, if the Bashaw persisted in his determination. At 4 P. M. Mr. Nissen came off again with the seal of the Bashaw to the preliminary Articles; but with a condition that time should be allowed for the delivery of the wife and family of his Brother. I consented to it, and we went on board the Vixen to stand in near the harbour. When we were close to the Town, we fired a gun and hauled down the white flag. A salute of 21 Guns was fired from the Batteries, and answered by the Constitution. I went into the harbour in the Constitution’s barge with the flag of the United States display’d, and was received at the landing place by the American officers who had been in captivity, with a sensibility more easily to be conceived than described. An immense concourse of people crowded the shore and filled the streets, all signifying their pleasure on the conclusion of the peace.  
This, I beleive, is the first instance where a peace has been concluded by any of the Barbary States on board a ship of war. I must here pay a tribute of Justice to Commodore Rodgers, whose conduct, during the negociation on board, was mixed with that manly firmness and evident wish to continue the war, if it could be done with propriety, while he display’d the magnanimity of an American in declaring that we fought not for conquest, but to maintain our just rights and national dignity, as fully convinced the negociators that we did not ask, but grant peace. You will pardon me if I here introduce a circumstance evincive of the spirits of our Countrymen. At Breakfast this morning, Commodore Rodgers observed, that if the Bashaw would consent to deliver up our Countrymen, without making peace, he would engage to give him 200,000 dolls. instead of 60,000, and raise the difference between the two sums from the officers of the Navy, who, he was perfectly assured, would contribute to it with the highest satisfaction.  
  
In the Evening I visited Sidi Mahomet Dghies, whom I found a sensible, liberal and well informed man. He is a great friend of our’s, and has always been opposed to the War with us.  
On the 4h of June, at 11 AM. the Flag staff was raised on the American House, and the Flag of the United States display’d, which was immediately saluted with 21 Guns from the Castle and Forts, and was returned by the Constitution; and all our unfortunate Countrymen sent off on board their Ships. At noon I had an Audience of the Bashaw, by Appointment, and was received with every mark of respect and attention. He paid me many compliments, and expressed himself on the peace with much manliness. He is a man of a very good presence, manly &amp; dignified, and has not in his appearance so much of the Tyrant as he has been represented to be. His Court was much more superb than that of Algiers. We spoke but little on the subject of the Treaty &amp;c. He observed that he had given stronger evidences of his confidence in us than he had ever before given to any nation. He had delivered our people before he had received his own; and as to the money he was to receive it was merely nominal—the sum was nothing; but it was impossible to deliver them without something. The other articles of the Treaty I might form as I pleased; being convinced I would not insert anything which was not just. I returned his Compliments, and assured him he would find our nation as just as he had found them brave and persevering.  
On the 6h of June the Constitution sailed for Malta and Syracuse, to return to Tripoli with the money and the Tripoline prisoners. The Constellation sailed also for Derne, to bring off the few of our Countrymen who might be there. I remained in Tripoli’till the return of the Constitution to establish an Agent and make a final settlement of our business there. Dr. John Ridgely of Maryland, late Surgeon of the Philadelphia was strongly recommended as a proper person to reside at Tripoli till the pleasure of the President was Known, and I accordingly appointed him, as will be seen by the inclosed power and letter of instructions.  
On the 10th. I sent to the Bashaw two Copies of the Treaty, with translations in the Arabic language, to be signed by him and his Divan. He requested me to attend the Divan &amp; see the form of business there; and as this was a favour never before granted to a Christian he gave it as an evidence of his respect &amp;c. I accordingly attended, and was seated on the same seat with the Bashaw, on his right hand. Great order and solemnity were observed. I presented the Treaty to the Bashaw, who delivered it to his first Secretary to read, article by article. Some observations and short debates took place on several of the Articles; but the Bashaw appeared to explain them satisfactorily. After the whole was read, the form of its presentation and acceptance was written by the Secretary, and the Seals of the Bashaw and Members of the Divan affixed to the two Copies, one of which the Bashaw delivered to me in a solemn manner, and with many expressions of friendship; (He speaks good Italian).  
On the 17th. the Constitution arrived; but the wind was too high to admit of her landing the Tripolines or money. On the 18th. both were sent on shore; but instead of 100 Tripolines there were only 48, and 41 Blacks. Seven had been carried to the U.S. by Commodore Preble, and I could never obtain an accurate account of the whole number. I had the Bashaws Tiscara respecting those who had been taken by Commo. Dale, which had been left in hands of Mr. Nissan, which I found expressed 21 Tripolines &amp; Turks, for whom, and their goods, 7 Americans were to have been delivered. I was therefore obliged to make it appear that the Blacks were his Subjects, and were to be included in the exchange. I found no difficulty in the case, tho’ I am sure he was not convinced of the propriety of it. Those in the U.S. I assured him would be returned by the first opportunity. The 60,000 Dollars were paid, and a receipt therefor given on the treaty left with Dr. Ridgely, and a duplicate therefor which is enclosed. No Consular Present is mentioned in the Treaty; but that it is understood will be given as is usual with all Nations when a Consul shall be sent, it does not exceed 6,000 Dollars, and the particulars I shall send in my next, as I shall also my accounts, which can not yet be adjusted, as our quarantine at Malta did not admit of my having that communication with Mr Higgins which was necessary for settling, as I had given him Bills on the House of Sir Francis Baring &amp; Co. in London for the money sent to Tripoli &amp;c.  
On the 20th Commodore Rodgers came on shore, and had an audience of the Bashaw, where the assurances of friendship &amp;c were repeated by the Bashaw.  
On the 21st. in the Evening we sailed for Malta and Syracuse; arrived on the former on the morning of the 24th., where we remained two days, and sailed for this place.  
I shall, in a future letter, give a more particular account of Tripoli &amp;c. At present I confine myself to the subject of the negociation &amp; Treaty. As I have always been opposed to the Egyptian &amp; Derne expedition, I shall say nothing on that subject, especially as I presume there will be full communications respecting it from other quarters.  
On the 5th. of March last we were indebted to Algiers for one years annuity, deducting the Cargo of Timber &amp;c. which had been sent. I had learned that they were in great want of wheat at that place, and it struck me that if a Cargo of that Article was sent to them on account of our Annuity, it would be received with gratitude, and be a great saving to the U.S. I therefor⟨e⟩; purchased a Cargo of about 12.000 bushels at Malta, which cost, with charges about 32,000. Dollars, and sent it to Algiers with a proper letter on the occasion; And I am happy to inform you that it arrived in good time, and in fine order, and was more valuable, as it relates to the U.S., than a cargo of money would have been at that time. It was received, as intended, as a proof of friendship, and an evidence of good faith; and will settle our accounts for one year at least.

that :] treaty of peace should be made upon  
hot-zorablsiess and mutually bent-{idal terms.  
W&#x27;ith this he went on short-&quot;in the evening;  
but apparently Without any expectation of  
its being accepted.

now depended on the Bashaw to terminate  
the business by&#x27;n single word, and that ve­  
rv little time more would be give: for  
that purpose. He requested permisw&#x27;n -t.&gt;.

date of the 3d of November, I have thought it ,my  
duty to remain in the vicinity of Tripoli, th« I  
might be at hand for entering into a neeociation with  
the bashaw, whenover he should give evidence of  
his disposition to do so on proper terms; and I accru&#x27;d  
inglv took up my residence in Malta ; being well as­  
sured that nothing would occur to make my pre­  
sence necessary at Algiers during, the winter, and  
knowing that the Dey was perfectly satified as  
to the cause of my extended absence from his do­  
minions.  
On the 28th of December I received a letter from  
Don Gerardo Joseph De Tauza, the Spanish consul at  
Tripoli, stating, that on the lrth of December he  
had a private audience with the Bashaw of Tripoli  
on the business of his nation, which being pver, the  
Bashaw introduced the subject of the war with the *  
United States, and expressed his willingness to con­  
clude it, if the Americans were disposed to come  
forward on proper grounds. The Spanish consul  
answered that he presumed they would have no ob­  
jections to finish the war upon honourable terms.  
There he says the subject was dropped ; and he took  
the liberty of making this communication to rne  
having heard that I was in Malta; adding as his  
own opinion, that if I would come over to Tripoli  
in a (lug of truce, he had no doubt but a peace might  
soon be concluded on honourable and satisfactory  
terms. As I h id reason to believe that this commu­  
nication was made to me w ith the knowledge, if not  
by the expi ess desire of tlie Bashaw, I felt in no  
haste to reply to it, as I was persuaded that, if he  
then discovered a desire to terminate the business  
he would be more anxious to do so when the season  
for active operations should approach. On the 28th  
of March commodore Barron sent a small vessel to  
Tripoli with cloathing, &amp;c. for our captive country­  
men, and by that occasion I acknowledged the re­  
ceipt of the Spanish consul’s letter ; and observed to  
  
Him, tnat as we naa hist year made several over*  
tures to the Bashaw for peace, which had tjeen re­  
jected, he might be assured that we shoqTd never  
make the first advance again on that subject. But  
! notwithstanding our force in tliis sea was very consi*  
1 derable, and would at the proper season, act with  
decided vigor ; yet we should be ready to receive  
and consider any propositions which might come  
from the Bashaw before that season arrived; pro­  
vided such propositions were compatible with the  
dignity and rising character of our nation, and tend­  
ing to an honourable and permanent peace.  
On the 21st of April, 1 received by the return of  
the same vessel from Tripoli, another letter from  
the Spanish consul saying that lie had communicated  
to the Bashaw the contents of my letter of the SStii  
March, who had directed him to inform me, that to  
shew his disposition to end the war he would make a  
proposition, viz. That that the United States should  
pay him 200,000 dollars for peace and ransom, and  
deliver up to him gratis, all his subjects in theirpow­  
er and make full restitution of the property taken  
from them. The Spanish consul added, that h* con­  
sidered the proposition of the bashaw rather intend­  
ed to form the basis for opening a negotiation, than  
made with an expectation of its being granted. Atthe  
same time he mentioned the mode of communication  
which might be pursued, if I should think proper to  
conic off Tripoli with a view to ojpening a negotiati­  
on. These propositions weic so completely inadmis­  
sible that after communicating them to commodore  
Barron, 1 thought no more of them, fully expecting  
further advances either through the same or some &#x27;  
other channel; as it evidently appeared to be the  
wish of the Bashaw to open a negotiation.  
Between the time last mentioned, and the 18th  
May, there were intimations made in various ways  
of the disposition of the Bashaw to treat; but none  
in a direct or official manlier. On that day commo­  
dore Barron wrote me the letter No. 1, to which on  
the 19th, 1 returned the answer No. 2, and on the  
2„&#x27;d he informed lie had relinquished the command  
of the -.qadron to capt. Rogers. On the 24th I em­  
barked on board the United States’ frigate Essex,  
capt. James Barron, to proceed to Tripoli. On the  
26th in the morning we saw the town of Tripoli  
distant about ten miles, and at the same time the U­  
nited States’ frigates Constitution and Presidents  
At ten o’clock A. M. capt. Barron and myself went  
on hoard the former, when captain Rodgers received  
the letterof commodore Barron relinquishing to hint ‘  
the command of the squadron, Sic. He returned with *  
us to the Essex, when we stood in for the town, and  
within a short distance from the battery hoisted the  
white flag, which was immediately answered by the  
same from the Bashaw’s castle. In half an hour *

&quot;boat came off with dhe Spanish consul nnd an officer  
of the Bashaw. I informed the Spanish consul that  
I hail, agreeably to die desire of the Bashaw, to  
treat, come lor tliht purpose ; but that the proposi­  
tions which hod been made through him (the Spa­  
nish consul) were totally out of the question, and  
must be relinquished before I would consent to move  
one step in the business ; and that if I hud not the  
most unequivocal evidence that they would be put  
aside in toto, I would not go on shore, and told him  
he had better return with my determination, and  
come off again the next day, if the bashaw was de­  
sirous of having peace on terms which we could ad­  
mit. He left the ship, and the wind during the night  
blew so heavily on shore that, the ships were obliged  
to stand off, and were not able to come in near the  
town again until the 29ih, when at 9 A. M. the Spa­  
nish consul came on board, bringing the tiscava or  
commission of the Bashaw to treat on his part, on  
the principal points of accommodation. Wc now  
removed bum the Kssex to the Constitution. The  
Bashaw relinquished all pretensions to a payment  
for peace or any future demand of any nature what­  
ever ; but demanded the sum of 130.000 dollars for  
the ransom of our cnuntrvmen, and the delivery of  
his subjects gratis. To this I objected as strongly as  
to the first proposition ; and after some time spent  
injdiscussing the subject, I told the Spanish consul,  
that to prevent unnecessary delay and altercation I  
■would give him in writing my ultimatum, which must  
heat once decided upon, viz. That there should be  
an exchange of prisoners man lor man, so far as  
they would go—that the Bashaw should send all the  
Americans in his power on board the squadron now  
off 1 ripoli—that his subjects should he brought over  
from Syracuse, nnd delivered to him with all conve­  
nient speed, and as lie had three hundred Ameri­  
cans, more or less, and we cne hundred Tripolitans,  
moie or less, 1 would engage to give hint for the ba­  
lance in his favour 60,000 dollars—that a treaty of  
peace should be made upon honourable and mutually  
beneficial terms. W ith this, tie went on sh&lt; re in the  
evening ; but apparently without any expectation of  
its being accepted.  
On tlie 30th, at 11 A. M. the Spanish consul came  
again on board the Constitution ; and urged me very  
strongly to go on shore, where every tiling, he said  
should be satisfactorily arranged ; but as I had de­  
termined not to deviate from the ground I had taken,  
1 declined ; stating to him that it now depended on  
the bashaw to terminate the business by a single  
■word, and that very little time more would be pivrn  
  
for that purpose. He rcrpiested permission to send  
a letter on shore, to which he would await an an­  
swer ; this was granted, and on receiving an an­  
swef to this letter, he again urged my going on shore  
in the strongest terms. This i steadily refused to  
do. The wind increasing, obliged the ship to stand  
tff, and prevented the Spanish consul from going on  
thorothis night.  
At o A. .*1. on the 31st of May, the Snanish con­  
sul went on shore, promising to come off again in a  
few hours with the Bashaw&#x27;s answer. At noon he  
came off, and said that the B ashaw had at length a­  
breed to the sum of sixty thousand dollars, for the  
balance of the prisoners ; hut that he could not  
think of delivering up the Americans until his sub­  
jects were ready to be delivered to him, and again  
urging me to go on shorc^ I told him, in one word,  
that the business had been protracted beyond what I  
conceived to he a reasonable time ; but as the wea­  
ther yesterday would not admit of our countrymen  
being sent on hoard, I would allow the bashaw twen­  
four hours, from this time, to accept my propositions  
in toto, orto reject them. lie begged forfurthertime,.  
but without effect; and left the ship at 5 I*. M.  
* At 11 A. M. June 1st, our unfortunate country­  
man, captain Bairibridgq came on hoard, who had  
• been permitted to come off, under the guarantee of  
the Danish consul, find Sadi Mahomut Dighies, the  
minister ot ioreign affairs. He assured me that the  
Americans would not lie delivered up until a treaty  
of peace should be made with the Bashaw, as peace  
vas more his object than the sum he might get for  
the captives; and as it was our intention to conclude  
n treaty ; it would be cruel to let our countrymen  
languid! in captivity merely on the punctilio of ne­  
gotiating the treaty before or after their dtlivery ;  
as whatever related to them was already understood.  
1 informed him of all which had passed between the  
Spanish consul and myself; and told him that as the  
Spanish consul had come on board as the commissi­  
oner of the Bashaw, with his credentials, which he  
had delivered to me, I considered the business as  
now brought nearly to a close, and that a very short  
time remained for the Bashaw to make up his mind.  
However, as I should make no difference in the  
terms of the treaty, whether it should be drawn up  
before or after the delivery of the prisoners, I would  
enter into an immediate negotiation for that purpose,  
vrjth any proper character, whom the bashaw might  
send on board duly authorised ; but I would have  
nothing more to do with the Spanish consul. But  
the Americans should be sent on board without wait­  
ing the arrival of the Tripolines from Syracuse.  
Captain B. left us in the evening and went on share.  
In the forenoon of the 2d of June, Mr. Nissen, his  
Danish majesty’s consul at Tripoli, came off-to the  
Constitution, bringing a commission from the Ba­  
*Uaw, to negociate with me on the articles of the  
treaty. As 1 had a sketch prepared I communicat­  
ed it to Mr. Nissen, who observed that there were  
some articles more favourable to us than were to be  
found in any treaty which the Bashaw had with anv  
other nation ; &gt;et he would take them on shore and  
submit them to the Bashaw, lie did so, and return­  
  
wii i«mui ciUvJII l **  
. . . « ,- -.wuug matine Ua­  
»Imw had consented to the articles ; hut was very  
desirous of having an article expressive of our tie­  
termination to withdraw our forces, he. from Dome,  
and that we should endeavour to persuade his bro­  
ther to leave Ills dominions. To the first I could have  
no objection, as it would he a natural consequence of  
peaqe ; hut I insisted that if his brother should leave  
his territory, he should have his wife and children  
restored to him. Mr. Nissen thought the latter  
clause would meet objections. However he took it  
on shore.  
On Urn morning of the 3d of June, Mr. Nissen  
came off again, and declared that the Bashaw would  
not agree to deliver the wife and children of his bro­  
ther. I adhered to that part of the article, and af­  
ter some little time he returned on shore. When  
Mr. Niasen had left the ship, I told commodore Rod­  
gers, and captain Smith of the Vixen, who was on  
hoard, that if the Bashaw should persist hi his onno  
ct.on to this article, I would not suffer the business  
to be broken off, a„d leave our countrvmcn in slwe!  
ry i but would at all hazards take l boat and go on  
shore, .fine white flag should he hauled down which  
Mr. N. said would be the signal, if the Bashaw per­  
sisted in lus determination. At 4 p. m. Mr N  
came off again with the seal of the Bashaw to the  
preliminary articles ; hut with a condition that time  
should he allowed for the delivery of the wife and  
family of his brother. I consented to it, and we  
went on Imard the Vixen to stand in near the har  
hour. When we were dose to the town, wc fired a  
gun and hauled down the white flag. A salute of 21  
guns was fired from the batteries, and answered bv  
• the Constitution. 1 went into the harbour in the C.oh  
slitulion&#x27;s barge with the flag of the United States  
displaved, and was received at the landing place bv  
the American officers, .who had been in captivitv  
with a sensibility more easily to he conceived than  
described. An immense concourse o£people crowd­  
ed the shore and filled the streets, all signifying their  
pleasure on the conclusion of the peace. * 6  
  
This, 1 believe, is‘the first instance, where a peace  
has been concluded by any of the Barbary states on  
Iioard a sliip cjf war. I must here pay a tribute ol  
justice to commodore Rodgers, whose conduct dur­  
ing the negotiation on board, was mixed with that  
manly firmness and ev ident wish to continue the war,  
if it could be done with propriety, while lie display­  
ed the magnanimity of an American, in declaring  
that wc fought not fop conquests, but to maintain our  
just rights and national dignity, as fully convinced  
the negotiators that we did not ask, but grant peace.  
jou will pardon me if I here introduce a circum­  
stance evincive of the spirit of our countrymen_At  
breakfast this moining. commodore Rodgers observ­  
ed, that if the Bashaw would consent to deliver up  
our countrymen without making peace, he would eu­  
gnge to give him 260,000 dollars instead of 60,000,  
and raise the difference betwen the two sums from  
tiie officers of the navy, who, he was perfectly as­  
sured, would conti ibute to it with the highest satis­  
faction.  
In the evening I visited Sidi Mahomet Dighies,  
whom I fount! a sensible, liberal, and well informed  
man. He is a great friend of curs, and lias always  
been opposed to the war with us.  
On the 4ih of June, at 11 a. m. the flag staff was  
raised on the American house, and the flag of the  
United States displayed, which was immediately sa­  
luted with 21 guns from the castle and forts, and was  
returned by the Constitution, and all our unfortunate  
countrymen sent oh on board their ships. At neon I  
hail an audience of the Bashaw, by appointment, aud  
was received with every mark of respect and atten­  
tion. He paid me many compliments and express­  
ed himsell on the peace with much manliness. He  
is a mail of very good presence, manly and dignifi­  
ed, and has not in his appearance so much of the  
tyrant as he has been represented to be.—His court  
was much more superb than that of Algiers. We  
spoke but little on the subject of the treaty, 5cc.—  
He observed that he had given stronger evidences of  
his confidence in us than he had ever before given  
to any nation. lie had delivered our people before  
he had received his own ; and as to the money he  
was to receiv e, it was merely nmninal—the sum was  
nothing, but it was impossible to deliver them with­  
out something. 1 he other articles of the treaty I  
might form as I pleased ; being convinced I would  
not insert any thing which was not just. I returned  
Ins compliments, and assured him he would find our  
nation as just as he had found them brave and per­  
severing. r  
  
wn nit. 0111 or June the Constitution sailed for Mai­  
tn anil Syracuse, to return to Tripoli with the mo­  
ney and the Tripolinc prisoners. The Constellati­  
on sailed also for Derne, to bring off the lew of our  
countrymen who might be there. 1 remained at  
1 ripoli ’till the return of the Constitution, to esta­  
u.ish an agent and make a final settlement of our  
buoincss there. Dr. John Kidgelv, of Maryland,  
late surgeon of the Philadelphia, Was strongly re­  
commended as a proper person to reside at Tripoli  
till the pleasure of the President was known, and 1  
accordingly appointed him, as will lie seen bv the en­  
closcii power and letter of instructions.  
On the 10th, I sent to the Bashaw two copies of  
the treaty, with translations, in the Arabick lan­  
BU ISC» to be signed by him, and his divan. He re­  
quested rne to attend the divan and to see the form of  
business there ; and as this was a favour never bc­  
nire granted to a Christian, he gave it as an evidence  
e. his respect, See. I accordinrb- attended, and  
was seated on the same seat with the Bashaw, on his  
light hand. Great order and solemnity were ob­  
served.—I presented the treaty to the Bashaw, who  
delivered it to his fi&quot;st secretary to read article bv  
.,i!icie. Some observations nnd short debates took  
place on several of the articles, hut the Bashaw ap­  
peared to explain them satisfactorily. After the  
whole was read, the form of its presentation and ac­  
ceptance, was written by the secretary, and the  
seals ot the Bashaw, and members of the divan affix­  
e:. to the two copies ; one of which the Bashaw de­  
livered to sue in a solemn manner, and with many ex­  
pressions of friendship. (He speaks good Italian.)  
On the 1&lt; th the Constitution arrived, hut the wind  
was too high to admit ot her landing the Tripolincs  
or money—on the 18th, both were sent on shore ; but  
instead of 100 Tripolincs there were only 48, and 41  
b.acks. Seven had been carried to the United States  
bv commodore Preble, and I could never obtain an  
accurate account of the whole number. I had the  
Bashaw’s tiscara respecting those who had been tak­  
eu by commodore;Dale, which had been left in hands  
ot Mr. Nissen, which 1 found expressed 21 Tripo­  
lines and Turks, for whom, and their goods. 7 Ame­  
ricans were to have been delivered. I was there­  
fore oohgcd to make it appear that the blacks were  
his subjects, and were to be included in the exchange.  
1 found no difficulty in the case, though I am sure he  
was tint convinced of the propriety of it. Those in  
the G mted States, I assured him would he returned  
bv lhe first opportunity. The 00,000 dollars were  
paid, and a receipt therefore given on the trea­  
ty left with Dr. Uidgely, and a &#x27;duplicate therefor  
wlucn is enclosed. No consular present is mention­  
ed &#x27;■* the treaty ; but that, it is understood, will be  
given as usual with all nations w hen a consul shall be  
sent ; it does not exceed 0,000 dollars, and the parti­  
rulars 1 shall send in my next, as I shajl also, my ac­  
counts, which cannot yet be adjusted, as our quaran­  
tine at Malta did not admit of my having that com­  
munication with Mr.. Higgins which was necess.m  
tor settling, as I had given him bills on the house of  
sir Francis Baring and co. in London, for the mo­  
ney sent to Tripoli, &amp;c.  
  
&#x27;Jn ine **utn commodore Rodgers came on shore,  
ami had an audience of the Bashaw, where the as­  
surancesof friendship See. were repeated by the Ba­  
shaw.  
On the 21st in the evening, we sailed for Malta Sc  
Syracuse ; arrived at the former on the morning of  
the 24th, where we remained two days, and sailed  
tor this place.  
i shall in a future letter, give a more particular  
account ut Tripoli, See. At present I confine myself  
to the subject of the ncgociation and treaty. As I  
h ivc always been opposed to the Egyptian &amp; Derne  
expedition, I shall say nothing on that subject, espe­  
cially, ns I presume, there w ill be full communica­  
te.us respecting it from other quarters.  
On the 5th March last, we were indebted to Al­  
giers for one year’s annuity, deducting the cargo of  
timber, See. which had been sent. I had learned  
that they were in great want of wheat at that place,  
and it struc k me that if a cargo of that article was  
sent to them on account of our annuity, it would he  
received with gratitude, and be a great saving to the  
United States ; I therefore purchased a cargo of a­  
bout 12,000 bushels at Malta, which cost with char­  
ges, about 32,000 dollars, and sent it to Algiers with  
a proper letter on the occasion ; and I am happy to  
inform you that it arrived in good time, and in fine  
order, and was more valuable as it relates to the U.  
States, than a cargo of money would have been at  
that tune. It was received as intended, as a proof  
of friendship and an evidence of good faith : and will  
settle our accounts for one year at least.

At noon he C3itte off, &amp; fait! that the ftafhaw had  
AC length agreed to the fum of flxty thmifand  
dollars, foV the balance of the prifoners ; but  
that he could not think of delivering up  
Americans until his fuhjcdls veei’waKmUy.to^  
w oe dtlTv!*rflv to Wm, ,anu again urging me to  
go on fhore. I told him, in one word, that  
the bufinefs had been protradled beyond what  
I conceived to be a reafonhle time ; but as the  
weather veflerday would not admit of our  
countrymen being fent on board, I would allow  
the Bafliaw twenty-four hours, from this time,  
to agree to my propofitions in toto, or rejcifl  
them. He begeed for further time, but without  
effefl; and left the fhip at 5 r. m.  
At 11 a. M. June 111, our unfortunate coun­  
tryman, captain Buinhridge came on board, who  
had been permitted to come off, under the  
guarantee of the Danifh conful, and Sidi Maha­  
mut Dghies, the minifter of foreign affairs. He  
allured me that the Americans would not he  
delivered up until a treaty of peace fhould be  
marie withthe Bafliaw, asneaee was morehisob­  
jett than the fum he might get for the captives ;  
and as it was our intention to conclude a trea­  
ty, it would be cruel to let our countrymen lan­  
guifli in captivity merely on the punJlillio of  
ncgociating the treaty before or after their deli­  
very ; as whatever related to them was already  
underflood. I informed him of all which had  
pallid between the Spanifh conful and myfelf ;  
and told him that as the Soanifh conful had  
come on board a3 (he como.ifhoner of the Bi­  
fhaw, with his credentials, which he had deli­  
vered to me, I confidercd the bufinefs as now  
brought nearly to a clofe, and that a vtry fhort  
time remained for the B.lhaw to make up his I  
mind. However, as l fhould make no differ­  
ence in the terms of the treaty, whether it  
fhould he drawn up before or after the deli­  
very of the prifoners, I would enter into an im­  
mediate negociation for that purpofe, with any  
proper character whom the Balhaw might fend  
on board duly authorifed ; but I would have  
nothing more to do with the Spanifh conful.  
But the Americans Ihould be fent on board with­  
out waiting the arrival of the Tripolines from  
Syracufe. Captain B. left us in the evening and  
went on fhore.  
  
Jo the forenoon of the 2d of June, Mr. NT­  
fen, his Danish tmjefty’s c &gt;nful at Tripoli,  
eatne off to the Conflitution, bringing a com- &#x27;  
million from the B ifliaw, to negotiate with me j  
on the articles of the treaty. As I had a ft etch ,  
prepared I communicated it to Mr. NiiTto, I  
who ohferved th &lt;t there were feme articles more i  
favorable to us than were to be found in j  
any treaty which the Bifbaw had with any o-I  
tlu r nation; yet he would take them on (bore  
and fubmit them to the Bafhaw. He did fo, j  
and returned on hoard again about -1 r. m. fay- !  
jug that the Batltaw had confented to the arti- |  
clcs; but was very delirous of having an arti- j  
cie exp-eBive of our determination to withdraw  
our forces, See. from Derne, and that we &gt;  
fhould endeavor to perfuade his brother to leave !  
his dominions. To the firfl I could have no oh- j  
jrdion, as it would Ire a natural confequence I  
of peace ; but I infilled that if his brother fhould ;  
leave his territory, he fhould have his wife and  
children reftored to him. Mr. Nitfen thought I  
the latter claufe would meet objections. Howe-:  
ver he took it on fhnre.  
Cn the morning of the t of June, Mr. Nif­  
fen came off again, and declared that the Ba-&#x27;  
fiaw would not agree to deliver the wife and j  
children of his brother. I adhered to that part j  
of the article, and after fome little time he re­  
turned on fhorc. When Mr. Nr Ten had left;  
the flop, I told commodore Rodgers, and cap­  
tain Smith of the V xen, who was on hoard, that I  
if the Bafliaw fl.ould pe.Tiflin his r.ppofition to &#x27;

nefs. He is a man of very good pi-, fence, manly  
Sc dignified, and haiuotinhis appearance fo  
much of the tyrant as he has hern repreftnted  
to he.—His court was much mure fuiK-rb than  
that of Algiers. We fpoke but little on the  
fuhjeet of the treaty, &amp;c. He ohferved that he  
ha&lt;l given llronger evidences of his confidence  
in us than he had ever lwf«»re given to any nati­  
on. He had delivered oor people before he had  
received his own ; and as to thr money he was  
‘ tmmWl,Ahe fum  
waTWbthmg, but it was impoilihle t»»tdeliver  
them without fomething. The other articles  
of the treaty I might form as ] pie ift*d ; being  
convinced I would not infert any thing which  
i vyas not juft. I returned his compliments, and1  
J allured him he would find onr nation as juft as  
he had found them brave and per fevering.  
On the 6th of June, the Conllitution failed  
for Malta and Syracufc, to return to Tripoli  
with the money and the Trlpoline p-iimers.  
t&#x27;uc C&#x27;onfteUation failed alfo for Derne, fo bring  
&#x27; off the ft w of our countrymen who might be  
there. I remained at Tripoli’till the return&#x27;r.f  
the Conftitution, to eftablifh an agent and make  
a final fettlcment of our bufbtefs there. Dr.  
To’w R&#x27;dgelg, oLMarvland, Ul^fiirgwn brrhc&#x27;  
rhilanelpnia, was ftrivF?JftT“4eeom mended as a  
proper perfon to relide at Tripoli ’till the plea­  
sure of the Prefident was known, and l accor­  
dingly appointed him, as will he feen by the en­  
clofed power and letter of inftrultions.  
On the loth, I fent to the Baftiaw tw O CO­  
pies of the treaty, with tranihtions, in the A­  
rabic language, to be figiied by him, and his  
divan. He requefted me to attend the divan  
and fee the form of bufiuefs there ; and as this  
was a favor never before granted to a Chriftian,  
he gave it as an evidence of his refpoft, &amp;c. I  
accordingly attended, and was feated on the  
fame feat with thcBtlhaw, on his right hand.—  
Great order and foiemnity were ohferved. I 1  
prefented the treaty to the Bafhaw, who deli- I  
vered it to his firft fecretary to read article by |  
article. Some obferVatior.s and (hurt debates !  
took place on feveral of the articles, but the 3a- J  
(haw appeared to explain them fatisfaitorily. j  
After the whole was read, the form of its prr- I  
fentation and acceptance, was written by the  
fccretary, and the feals of the Bafhaw and mem- j  
f.tra of tile divan affixed to the two copies; one j  
of which the Baftiaw delivered to me in a folemn !  
manner Sc with many expretfions of friendfhip. !  
(He fpcaks good Italian.)  
On the 17th the Conftitution arrived, hut the  
wind was too high to admit of her landing the  
Tripolines or money—on the 19th, both were  
firnt on tliore ; hut inftoad of 100 Tripolities  
there were only 4S, and H hlarks. Seven had  
been carried to the United States, by commo­  
dore Preble, and I could never obtain an accu­  
rate account of the whole number. I had the  
Bafttaw’s tifeara refpeifting thofe who had been  
taken by commodore Dale, which had been  
left in the hands of Mr. Niflen, which 1 found!  
exprefled 21 Trjpolines and Turks, for whom, I  
and their goods, 7 Americans were to have i  
been delivered. I whs therefore obliged to make i  
it appear that the blacks were his fubjeifts, and |  
were to be included in the exchange. I found  
no difficulty in the cafe, though I am fare he  
is not cnnvinreA of the propriety of it. Tiiofe  
in the United States, I allured him would be  
returned by the lirft opportunity. The 60,000  
dollars were paid, and a reccpt therefor given !  
on the treaty left with Dr. Ridgely, and a du- I  
plicate therefor which is endofed. No confu- !  
Iir prefent is mentioned in the treaty; but that, j  
  
it is understood, will be given a* ul&#x27;mi «-;cs „lt  
nations when a conful fhall be fent; it does not  
exceed 6,000 dollars, and the particulars I (hall  
fend in my next, a* 1 (hall alfo, my accounts,  
which cannot yet be adjufted, as our quarantine  
at Malta did not admit of my having that com­  
munication with Mr. Higgins which was necef­  
fary for fettling, as ] had given him biils on the  
houfe of hr Francis Bearing and co. in London  
for the money fent to Tripoli, Sic.  
On the 20th commodore Rodgers came on  
fhore, and had an audience of the Bafhaw, where  
the aHurancts of frendlhip &amp;c. were repeated  
by the Bafhaw.  
On the &quot;lit, in the evening, we failed for Mai- l  
ta and Syracufe ; arrived at the former on the j  
morning of the 24th where wc remained two  
days, and failed for this place.  
i fhall in a future letter, give a more particu­  
lar account of Tripoli, &amp;c. At prefent I con­  
tine inyielf to the fuhjelt of the negociatiou aiul  
treaty. As I have always been oppofed to the  
Egyptian and Derne expedition, I ilia!! fay no­  
thing on that fubjeft, efpeciaily, as I prefume,  
there will be full communications refpetfirig it  
from other quarters.  
On the 5th of March lalf, wc were indebted  
to Algiers for one year’s annuity, deducting the  
cargo of timber, See. which had been fent. I  
had learned that they were in great want of  
wheat at that place, and it (truck me that if a  
cargo of that article was fent to them on ac­  
count of our annuity, it would be received with  
gratitude, ami be a great faving to the United

however, be abandoned before he would, “ consent to move one  
step in the business;” that if the most unequivocal evidence  
of their having been relinquished, were not afforded, he would  
not go on shore. Not being authorized to state explicitly, whe-  
ther the Bashaw would abandon those propositions, or not,  
the consul left the ship for the purpose of consulting with him,  
on the subject.—The wind blowing heavily on shore, the ships  
were obliged to stand off, and were not able to regain their  
positions near the town until the 29th; when at 9, A. M. the  
Spanish consul went on board, taking with him the Bashaw’s  
tiscara or commission, to treat. The negotiators having re-  
moved from the Essex to the flag ship, the Constitution, the  
Spanish consul, in behalf of the Bashaw, “ relinquished all pre-  
tensions to a payment for peace, or any future demand of any  
nature whatever; but demanded the sum of one hundred and  
thirty thousand dollars for the ransom of our countrymen, and  
the delivery of his subjects gratis.” This was immediately

rejected by colonel Lear, who gave his wtimatum in writing,  
desiring an immediate decision upon it, viz: “ that there should  
be an exchange of prisoners, man for man, so far as they  
would go; that the Bashaw should send all the Americans in  
his power, on board the squadron now off Tripoli: that his  
subjects should be brought over from Syracuse, and delivered  
to him with all convenient speed; and as he had three hundred  
Americans, more or less, and we one hundred Tripolitans,  
more or less, he would engage to give him for the balance in  
his favor, $60,000—-and that a treaty of peace should be made  
upon honorable and mutually beneiicial terms.”  
  
With this ultimatum, the Spanish consul went on shore—  
and returned on board on the SOth, when he urged colonel!  
Lear very strongly to go on shore, where, he said, every thing  
should be satisfactorily arranged. ‘This was declined, and to  
the consul it was observed, “ that it now depended on the Ba-  
shaw to terminate the business bya single word, and that very  
little time more would be given for that purpose.” The ship  
being obliged to stand off, in consequence of the wind blowing  
high, on shore, the Spanish consul was unavoidably detained  
on board, till the morning of the Sist. when he went on shore  
again, but returned at noon, and said, “ that the Bashaw had at  
length agreed to the sum of $60,000 for the balance of the pri-  
soners; but that he could not think of delivering up the Ameri  
cans until his subjects were ready to be delivered to him’”’—  
and again urged colonel Lear to go onshore. ‘To which colo-  
nel Lear replied, that the business had been unreasonably pro-  
tracted--but as the weather did not admit of our countrymen  
being sent on board the previous day, he would allow the  
Bashaw twenty-four hours (from noon of Sist,) to agree to

A salute of twenty one guns was fired from the batteries of  
Tripoli, and answered by the Constitution.--Thus closed our  
war with ‘Tripoli.  
  
Colonel Lear in his despatches tothe Secretary of State, da-  
ted 5th July, 1805, observes:  
  
«This, I believe, 1s the first instance where a peace has been  
concluded by any of the Barbary States on board a ship of  
war! I must here pay a tribute of justice to commodore  
Rodgers, whose conduct during the negotiation on board, was  
mixe ad with that manly Girmness, and evident wish to continue  
the war, if it could be done with propriety, while he displayed  
the magnanimicy of an American, in declaring that we fought  
not for conquest but to maintain our just rights and national  
dignity, as fully convinced the negotiators, that we did not ask,  
hut grant, peace.”

Omitting other indications of a wish, existing before the cap-  
ture of Derne, on the part of the Bashaw to make peace with  
us, it will be sufficient to mention the following—Four months  
prior to the capture of Derne, (viz. 28th December, 1804,)  
colonel Lear received from Don Gerardo Joseph de Pauza,  
the Spanish consul at Tripoli, a letter, stating that on the 17th  
December, “he had a private audience with the Bashaw of  
Tripoli, on the business of his nation, which being over, the  
Bashaw introduced the subject of his war with the United
