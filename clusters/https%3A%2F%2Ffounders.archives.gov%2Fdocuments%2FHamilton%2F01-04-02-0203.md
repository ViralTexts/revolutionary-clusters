To the People of the State of New-York.  
THE next view which I shall take of the House of Representatives, relates to the apportionment of its members to the several States, which is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct taxes.  
It is not contended that the number of people in each State ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion of those who are to represent the people of each State. The establishment of the same rule for the apportionment of taxes, will probably be as little contested; though the rule itself in this case, is by no means founded on the same principle. In the former case, the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of the people, with which it has a natural and universal connection. In the latter, it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of which it is in no case a precise measure, and in ordinary cases a very unfit one. But notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the States, it is evidently the least exceptionable among the practicable rules; and had too recently obtained the general sanction of America, not to have found a ready preference with the Convention.  
  
All this is admitted, it will perhaps be said: But does it follow from an admission of numbers for the measure of representation, or of slaves combined with free citizens, as a ratio of taxation, that slaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of representation? Slaves are considered as property, not as persons. They ought therefore to be comprehended in estimates of taxation which are founded on property, and to be excluded from representation which is regulated by a census of persons. This is the objection, as I understand it, stated in its full force. I shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning which may be offered on the opposite side.  
We subscribe to the doctrine, might one of our southern brethren observe, that representation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation more immediately to property, and we join in the application of this distinction to the case of our slaves. But we must deny the fact that slaves are considered merely as property, and in no respect whatever as persons. The true state of the case is, that they partake of both these qualities; being considered by our laws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects, as property. In being compelled to labor not for himself, but for a master; in being vendible by one master to another master; and in being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty, and chastised in his body, by the capricious will of another, the slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and classed with those irrational animals, which fall under the legal denomination of property. In being protected on the other hand in his life &amp; in his limbs, against the violence of all others, even the master of his labor and his liberty; and in being punishable himself for all violence committed against others; the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a member of the society; not as a part of the irrational creation; as a moral person, not as a mere article of property. The Fœderal Constitution therefore, decides with great propriety on the case of our slaves, when it views them in the mixt character of persons and of property. This is in fact their true character. It is the character bestowed on them by the laws under which they live; and it will not be denied that these are the proper criterion; because it is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property, that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers; and it is admitted that if the laws were to restore the rights which have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants.  
This question may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all sides, that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation, as they are the only proper scale of representation. Would the Convention have been impartial or consistent, if they had rejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants when the shares of representation were to be calculated; and inserted them on the lists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted? Could it be reasonably expected that the southern States would concur in a system which considered their slaves in some degree as men, when burdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider them in the same light when advantages were to be conferred? Might not some surprize also be expressed that those who reproach the southern States with the barbarous policy of considering as property a part of their human brethren, should themselves contend that the government to which all the States are to be parties, ought to consider this unfortunate race more compleately in the unnatural light of property, than the very laws of which they complain!  
It may be replied perhaps that slaves are not included in the estimate of representatives in any of the States possessing them. They neither vote themselves, nor increase the votes of their masters. Upon what principle then ought they to be taken into the fœderal estimate of representation? In rejecting them altogether, the Constitution would in this respect have followed the very laws which have been appealed to, as the proper guide.  
This objection is repelled by a single observation. It is a fundamental principle of the proposed Constitution, that as the aggregate number of representatives allotted to the several States, is to be determined by a fœderal rule founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, so the right of choosing this allotted number in each State is to be exercised by such part of the inhabitants, as the State itself may designate. The qualifications on which the right of suffrage depend, are not perhaps the same in any two States. In some of the States the difference is very materia

ence however to this principle is waved by those who would be gainers by it. All that they ask is, that equal moderation be shewn on the other side. Let the case of the slaves be considered as it is in truth a peculiar one. Let the compromising expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as inhabitants, but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the slave as divested of two fifths of the man.  
After all may not another ground be taken on which this article of the Constitution, will admit of a still more ready defence. We have hitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to persons only, and not at all to property. But is it a just idea? Government is instituted no less for protection of the property, than of the persons of individuals. The one as well as the other, therefore may be considered as represented by those who are charged with the government. Upon this principle it is, that in several of the States, and particularly in the State of New-York, one branch of the government is intended more especially to be the guardian of property, and is accordingly elected by that part of the society which is most interested in this object of government. In the Fœderal Constitution, this policy does not prevail. The rights of property are committed into the same hands with the personal rights. Some attention ought therefore to be paid to property in the choice of those hands

 very frequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his choice; and through this imperceptible channel the rights of property are conveyed into the public representation. A State possesses no such influence over other States. It is not probable that the richest State in the confederacy will ever influence the choice of a single representative in any other State.

&quot; immediately to property; and we join in the applica­

we must deny the fact that slaves are considered ;

a?ain Mr. Madison continues, &quot;The Federal Constitu­

BY JAMES MADISON.  
  
All this is admitted, it will perhaps be said: but does it follow  
from an admission of numbers for the measure of representation, or  
of slaves combined with free citizens as a ratio of taxation, that  
slaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of representation ?  
  
Slaves are considered as property, not as persons. They ought  
therefore, to be comprehended in estimates of taxation, which are  
founded on property, and to be excluded from representation, which  
is regulated by a census of persons. This is the objection as I un-  
derstand it, stated in its full force. I shall be equally candid in stating  
the reasoning which may be offered ov the opposite side. We sub-  
scribe to the doctrine, might one of our Southern brethern observe,  
that representation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation  
more immediately to property; and we join in the application of  
this distinction to the case of our slaves.

with the principle of equality.  
  
Kindred to this statement of Mr. Madison is  
that other contemporary testimony, which will  
be found 1n the Federalist, where the irrepealable  
rights of citizens are recognized without distinc-  
tion of evier. This explicit language cannot be  
too often quoted. Here it is:—  
  
“Ltis only under the pretext that the laws have  
transterred the negroes into subjects of property  
that a place is disputed them in the computation  
ot numbers; and it is admitted that if the laws  
  
} were to restore the rights which have been taken  
away the neyroes could no longer be refused an equal  
share of representation with the other inhabitants.’’—  
The Federalist, No. 54.

and to remove the objection that, in gad-  
justing a system of representation between  
the States, regard should be had to their  
relative wealth, since those who were to  
be most heavily taxed ought to have a pro-  
portionate influence in the Government.  
  
Observations by Madison,  
  
The compromise, in embracing the pow-  
er of direct taxation, consisted not simply  
in including part of the slaves in the enu-  
meration of the population, but in providing  
that as between State and State, such taxa-  
tion should be proportioned to representa-  
tion. The establishment of the same rule  
for the apportionment of taxes, as for  
  
regulating the proportion of representatives,  
observed Mr. Madison in No. 54 of the  
Federalist, was by no means founded on  
the same principle; for, as to the former, it  
had reference to the proportivn of wealth,  
and although in respect of that it was in  
ordinary cases a very unfit measure, it  
“had too recently obtained the general  
sanction of America not to have found a  
ready preference with the convention,”’ whil
