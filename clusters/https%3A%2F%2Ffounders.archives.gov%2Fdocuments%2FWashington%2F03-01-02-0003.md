y Dearest,  
Philadelphia June 18th 1775.  
  
I am now set down to write to you on a subject which fills me with inexpressable concern—and this concern is greatly aggravated and Increased when I reflect on the uneasiness I know it will give you—It has been determined in Congress, that the whole Army raised for the defence of the American Cause shall be put under my care, and that it is necessary for me to proceed immediately to Boston to take upon me the Command of it. You may beleive me my dear Patcy, when I assure you, in the most solemn manner, that, so far from seeking this appointment I have used every endeavour in my power to avoid it, not only from my unwillingness to part with you and the Family, but from a consciousness of its being a trust too great for my Capacity and that I should enjoy more real happiness and felicity in one month with you, at home, than I have the most distant prospect of reaping abroad, if my stay was to be Seven  
  
times Seven years. But, as it has been a kind of destiny that has thrown me upon this Service, I shall hope that my undertaking of it, is designd to answer some good purpose—You might, and I suppose did perceive, from the Tenor of my letters, that I was apprehensive I could not avoid this appointment, as I did not even pretend ⟨t⟩o intimate when I should return—that was the case—it was utterly out of my power to refuse this appointment without exposing my Character to such censures as would have reflected dishonour upon myself, and given pain to my friends—this I am sure could not, and ought not to be pleasing to you, &amp; must have lessend me considerably in my own esteem. I shall rely therefore, confidently, on that Providence which has heretofore preservd, &amp; been bountiful to me, not doubting but that I shall return safe to you in the fall—I shall feel no pain from the Toil, or the danger of the Campaign—My unhappiness will flow, from the uneasiness I know you will feel at being left alone—I therefore beg of you to summon your whole fortitude &amp; Resolution, and pass your time as agreeably as possible—nothing will give me so much sincere satisfaction as to hear this, and to hear it from your own Pen.  
If it should be your desire to remove into Alexandria (as you once mentioned upon an occasion of this sort) I am quite pleased that you should put it in practice, &amp; Lund Washington may be directed, by you, to build a Kitchen and other Houses there proper for your reception—if on the other hand you should rather Incline to spend good part of your time among your Friends below, I wish you to do so—In short, my earnest, &amp; ardent desire is, that you would pursue any Plan that is most likely to produce content, and a tolerable degree of Tranquility as it must add greatly to my uneasy feelings to hear that you are dissatisfied, and complaining at what I really could not avoid.  
As Life is always uncertain, and common prudence dictates to every Man the necessity of settling his temporal Concerns whilst it is in his power—and whilst the Mind is calm and undisturbed, I have, since I came to this place (for I had not time to do it before I left home) got Colo. Pendleton to Draft a Will for me by the directions which I gave him, which Will I now Inclose—The Provision made for you, in cas⟨e⟩ of my death, will, I hope, be agreeable; I have Included the Money for which I sold my own Land (to Doctr Mercer) in the Sum given you, as  
  
also all other Debts. What I owe myself is very trifling—Cary’s Debt excepted, and that would not have been much if the Bank stock had been applied without such difficulties as he made in the Transference.  
I shall add nothing more at present as I have several Letters to write, but to desire you will remember me to Milly &amp; all Friends, and to assure you that I am with most unfeigned regard, My dear Patcy Yr Affecte

Philadelphia, June 18, 1775.  
Mi Drarrst—l atn now set down to write  
to you on a subject which fills me with inex­  
pressible concern, and this concern is greatlv  
aggravated and increased, when I reflect upon  
the uneasiness I know it will give you. It has  
been determined in Congress, that the whole  
Army raised for the defence of the American  
cause shall he put under my care, and that it is  
necessary for me to proceed immediately to  
Boston to take upon me the command of it.—  
You may believe me, my de r P itsy, when I as­  
sure v«u m the most solemn manner that so far  
from seeking this appointment, I have used ev­  
ery endeavor in my power to avoid it, not only  
from my unwillingness t» pait with you 8c the  
family, but Irom a consciousness &lt;*f its being a  
•rust too great for my capacity, and that I shall  
enjoy more real happiness in one month with  
you at home, than 1 have the most distant  
pi ospect of Ending abroad, if my stay was to  
be seven times seven years. But as it has been  
a kind of d&#x27;-stiny that has thrown me upon  
this service, 1 shall hope ihat my undertaking  
nfit is designed to answer some good purpose.  
You might, and I suppose did perceive, from  
the tenor of my letters, that l whs apprehrnsive  
I could not avoi I this appointment, as 1 did not  
pretend to intimate wh*n Ij-di tuld teturn. That  
was the cr.se. It wav utterly out of my power  
to refuse this appointment without exposing  
my character to sut h censures as would ha*e  
reflected dishonor upon mvself, a id gi*en pain  
to my ft lends. This, I nm sure, could not and  
ought not, to he pleasing to you, and must have  
less&#x27;-ned me considerably in mv own esteem.  
  
I shall rely, then fore, confidently in 11*at Prov­  
idence which ha&gt; heretofore preserved and  
been bourn iff 1 to ntr, not doubting but that I  
shall return safe to yo i in the Fall. I shall feel  
no pain front the toil or the danger of the Cain  
paign; my unhappiness wrl flow fiom the un­  
easines- I know you will fee; from being left a*  
lone. I t rrtf. ii&#x27; beg !n»t you will summon  
your wh le fortitude, anil pass your time as a­  
greeablv as possible Nothing will give me  
so much smi ert sativfa. tion as to h-a&#x27; it from  
your own pen. My • jrucs and ardent desire  
is, ’hat you would put sue any plan that is most  
likeiy o produce content, and a olerable de­  
gret of tr.nxj tlity: as it mu si add greatly to  
my ••• fjsv teel.ngs, to heat that you arc dissat*­

My Deanest—I am now set down to write

LETTER.  
Philadelphia, Jc?e 18th, 1775  
Mv PeaxeKt ;  
I am mw set down to write to you on a sub­  
ject which fills me with inexpressible concern,  
:tnd this concern is greatly aggravated and in­  
creased, wlien I refl. ct upon the uneasiness I  
know it will give you. It h:s been determined  
in Congress, that the whole Army raised tor the  
defence of the American cause shall be put un­  
der my care, and that it is neces.ry for me to  
proceed immediately to Bos&#x27;on to take upon me  
the command of it. You may believe me, mv dear  
Patsy, when I assure you in the most solemn  
manner, that, so far from seeking this appoint­  
ment, I have&#x27; used every endeavor in my power  
,t.o avoid it, not only from my unwdlingness to  
part with yon and the family, but from a con­  
sciousness of its beinf1 a trust too great for my  
capacity, and that I should enjoy more real hap­  
piness in one month with you at home, than 1  
have the must distant prospect of finding abroad,  
if my s&#x27;ay wa. to be siven times seven years.  
Hut as it. h s been a kind of destiny that has  
thiown me upon this serv.ee, I shall hope that  
my und. rt tking of it is designed to answer some  
ood purpose. You mi.ht, and I suppose did  
perceive, from the tenor of my letters, that I was  
apprehensive I could not avoid this appointment,  
as 1 did not pretend to intimate when I should  
rertirn. That was the case. It was utterly out  
of my power to refuse this appointment without  
exposing my character to such censures as would  
have reflected dishonour upon myself, and given&quot;  
pain to my friends. This, f am sure, could not,  
and ought not, to be pleasing to you, and must  
1-avt lessened me considerably in my own esteem.

LETTER.  
Philadelphia, June 18th, 1775.  
My dearest: Lam now set dowa to write to you on  
a subject which fills me with inexpressible concern, and  
this concern is greatly aggravated aud increased, when I  
reflect upon the uneasiness I know it will give you. It has  
been determined in congress, that the whole army rais-  
ed for the defence of the American cause shall be put  
under my care, and that itis necessary for me to proceed  
immediately to Boston to take upon me the command of  
it. You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when I assure  
you in the most solemn manuer, that, so far from seek-  
ing this appointment, I Lave used every endeavor in my  
power to avoid it, not only from my unwillingness to part  
with you and my family, but from a consciousness of its  
beiag a trust too great for my capacity, and that 1 should  
enjoy more real happiness in one month with you at  
home, than [ have the most distant prospect of finding  
abroad, if my stay wasto be seven umes °°ven years.  
Butas it has been a kind of destiny that has thrown me  
upon this service, I shall hope that my undertaking of it  
isdesigned to answer some good purpose. You might,  
and I suppose did perceive, from the tenor of my letters,  
and I was apprehensive I could not avoid this appoint-  
ment, as I did not pretend to intimate when I should re-  
turn. That was the case. It wasutterly out of my pow-  
er to refuse this appointment without exposing my char-  
acter to such censuresas would have reflected dishonor  
upon myself, and given pain to my friends. This,1 am  
Sure, could not, and ought not, to be pleasing to you,  
  
——  
  
  
  
  
  
and must have lessened me enpaeeety  
teem. I shallrely, therefore, confi  
  
dence which has heretofore !  
to - not doubting but that 1 shall return safe to you in  
the fall.  
of the campaigi; my unhappiness will flow from the un-  
easioess | know you fell from being left alone. 4t

and pass your time a

Philadelphia, June 18, 1775.  
My Dearest—I am now sit down to write  
to you on a subject which fills me with inex­  
pressible concern, and this concern is greatly  
aggravated and increased, when I reflect up  
on the uneasiness I know it will give you. It  
has been determined in Congress, that tho  
whole Army raised for the defence of tho A­  
inerican cause shall be put under my care,  
and that it is necessary for me to proceed to  
Boston to take upon me the command of It.  
You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when I  
assure you in the most solemn manner that  
so far from seeking this appointment, 1 have  
used every endeavour in my power to avoid  
it, not only from my unwillingness to part  
from you and the family,hut from u conscious­  
ness of its being a trust too great for my capa­  
city, and that 1 Shall enjoy more real happi­  
ness in one month with you at home, than I  
have theemost distant prospect of finding n­  
broad, if my stay was to be seven times seven  
years. But as It has been a kind of destiny  
that has thrown me upon this service, I shall  
hope that my undertaking of it is designed to  
answer some good purpose. You might, and  
I suppose did perceive, from the tenor of my  
letters, that I was apprehensive I could not  
avoid this appointment, as I did not pretend  
to intimate when I should return. This was  
the case. It was utterly out of my power to  
refuse this appointment without exposing my  
character to such censures rb would have re­  
flected dishonor upon myself, and given pain  
to my friends. This, I am sure, could not  
and ought not, to be pleasing to you,and must  
have lessened me considerably in my own es­  
teem. I shall rely, therefore, confidently on  
that Providence which has heretofore preser­  
ved and been bountiful to me, not doubting  
but that I shall return sale to you in the Fall.  
I shall feel no pain from the toil or the dan­  
Kr of the campaign; my unhappiness will  
w from the uneasiness I know you will feel  
from being left alone. I therefore beg that  
you will summon your whole fortitude, and  
Kiss your time as agreeably as possible.—  
othlng will give me so much sincere satis­  
faction as to hear it from your own pen. My  
earnest and ardent desire is, that you wopld  
pursue any plan thatls most likely to produce  
content, and a tolerable degree of tranquility;  
ns it must add greatly to my uneasy feelings,  
to hear that you are dissatisfied or complain­  
ing at what I really could not avoid.  
As life is always uncertain, and common  
prudence dictates to every man the necessity  
of settling his temporal concerns while it is in  
his power, and while the mind is calm and un­  
disturbed, I have, since I came to this place,  
(for I had not time to do it before I left home,)  
Sot Col. Pendleton to draft a will for me, by

Philadelphia th June, 1775.  
My Dearest- i am now Isit down to  
write to you on a subject. Which fills me  
with inexpressible -concern, and this con­  
cern is greatly &#x27;aggravated, and increased,  
when I reflect upon the uneasiness I know  
it will give you. It has been determined  
in Congress, th-at the whole army raided  
for the defence of the American caue  
shall be put under my care, and that it is  
necessary lor me to proceed -immediately  
f Boston, to take upon me the command  
of it. You may believe me, my dear Patsy,  
when I assure you, in the most solemn  
manner, that so far from seeking this .ap­  
pointment, I have used every endeavor  
in my power to avoid it, not only from  
my unwillingness to part With ypu and  
the family, but from a &#x27;Consciousness of its  
being a trust too greator my capacity,  
and that I &#x27;should enjoy more real happi­  
ness in one month with you at home,, than  
I have the mo,t distant prospect of fitufx  
ing abroad, if my stay was to be seveii  
times seven years. But as&#x27;it has been a  
kind of destiny, that has thrort?n me upou  
this service, I &#x27;shall hope that my under­

pleasing to you, and must have lessened  
me considerably in my ovvnt esteem.&#x27; I  
shall ily, therefore, confidently on that  
Providence which has heretofore preserv­

the fall. I shall feel no pain from the  
toil or the danger of the campaign ; niy

I know vou will feel from being left alone.

PHILADELPHIA, 18 JUNE, 1775.  
  
My Dearest,—I am now set down to write to you ona  
subject, which fills me with inexpressible concern, and  
this concern is greatly aggravated and increased, when  
I reflect upon the uneasiness I know it will give you.  
It has been determined in Congress that the whole  
army raised for the defense of the American cause  
shall be put under my care, and that it is necessary  
for me to proceed immediately to Boston to take upon  
me the command of it.  
  
You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when I assure  
you in the most solemn manner, that, so far from seek-  
ing this appointment, I have used every endeavor in  
my power to avoid it, not only from my unwillingness  
to part with you and the family, but from a conscious-  
ness of its being a trust too great for my capacity, and  
that I should enjoy more real happiness in one month  
with you at home, than I have the most distant pros-  
  
  
  
pect of finding abroad, if my stay were to be seven  
times seven years. But as it has been a kind of des-  
tiny that has thrown me upon this service, I shall hope  
that my undertaking it is designed to answer some good  
purpose. You might, and I suppose did, perceive, from  
the tenor of my letters, that I was apprehensive I  
could not avoid this appointment, as I did not pretend  
to intimate when I should return. That was the case.  
It was utterly out of my power to refuse this appoint-  
ment, without exposing my character to such censures  
as would have reflected dishonor upon myself, and  
given pain to my friends. This, I am sure, could not,  
and ought not to be pleasing to you, and must have  
lessened me considerably in my own esteem. I shall  
rely, therefore, confidently on that Providence which  
has heretofore preserved and been bountiful to me, not  
doubting but that I shall return safe to you in the Fall.  
I shall feel no pain from the toil or the danger of the cam-  
paign; my unhappiness will flow from the uneasiness  
I know you will feel from being left alone. I there-  
fore beg that you will summon your whole fortitude,  
and pass your time as agreeably as possible. Nothing  
will give me so much sincere satisfaction as to hear  
this, and to hear it from your own pen. My earnest  
and ardent desire is, that you would pursue any plan  
that is most likely to produce content, and a tolerable  
degree of tranquillity; as it must add greatly to my  
uneasy feelings to hear that you are dissatisfied or com-  
plaining at what I really could not avoid.  
  
As life is always uncertain, and common prudence  
dictates to every man the necessity of settling his  
temporal concerns while it is in his power, and while  
the mind is calm and undisturbed, I have, since I came  
to this place—for I had no time to do it before I left  
home—got Col. Pendleton to draft a will for me. by  
the directions I gave him, which will I now inclose.  
The provision made for you, in case of my death, will,  
I hope, be agreeable.  
  
I shall add nothing more, as I have several letters  
to write, but to desire that you will remember me to  
your friends, and to assure you that I am, with the  
most unfeigned regard, my dear Patsy,  
  
Your affectionate GEORGE WASHINGTON.

necessary for me to proceed immediately

You may believe me, my dear Patsy,  
when I assure you, in the most solemn  
manner, that, so far from seeking this  
appointment, I have used every endeavor  
in my power to avoid it—not only from  
ny unwillingness to part with you and  
the family, but from a consciousness of  
its being a trust too great for my Capacity,  
and that I should enjoy more real happi­  
ness in one month with you at home than  
I have the most distant prospect of finding  
abroad, if my stay were to be seven times  
seven years. But as it has been a kind of  
destiny that has thrown me upon this  
service, I shall hope that my undertaking  
it is designed to answer some good pur­  
pose. You might, I suppose did, per­  
ceive, from the tenor of my letters, thai, I  
was apprehensive I could not avoid this  
appointment, as I did not pretend to inti­  
mate when 1 should return. That was the  
case. It was utterly out of my power to  
refuse this appointment, without exposing  
my character to such censures as would  
have reflected dishonor upon mvself and  
given pain to my friends. This, I am  
sure, could not, and ought not, to  
be pleasing to you, and must have lessened  
me considerably in my own esteem. I  
shall rely, therefore, confidently on that  
Providence which has heretofore preserved  
and been bountiful to me, not doubting  
but that I shall return safe to you in the  
fall. 1 shall feel no pain from the toil or  
the danger of the campaign my unhap­  
piuess will flow from the uneasiness&#x27; I  
know you will feel from being left alone.  
  
I therefore beg that you will summon your  
whole fortitude, and pass your time as  
agreeably as possible. Nothing will give  
me so much sincere satisfaction as to hear  
this, aud to hear it from your own pen.  
My earnest and ardent desire is, that you  
would pursue any plan that is most likely  
to produce content and a tolerable degree  
of tranquillity, as it must add greatlv to  
my uneasy feelings to hear that you are  
dissatisfied or complaining at wliatl really  
|could not avoid.  
  
As life is always uncertain, and com­  
mon prudence dictates to every man the  
necessity of settling his temporal concerns  
while it is in his power and while the  
mind is calm and undisturbed, I have,  
since I came to this place—for I had not  
time to do it liefore I left home—got Col.  
Pendleton to draft a will for me, by the  
directions I gave him, which will I now  
enclose. The provision made for you in  
case of my death, will, I hope, be agreea­  
ble.  
  
I shall add nothing more, as I have sev­
